        "text": "Webinar: Leading the Way towards a Just Green Transition: Using Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a Guiding Compass\n\nGI-ESCR, in co-sponsorship with the Geneva Climate Change consultation group (GeCCco) and International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific (IWRAW-AP), organized an online event held in light of the 50th session of the Human Rights Council called “Leading the Way towards a Just Green Transition: Using Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a Guiding Compass”.\n\nThe event took place on 23 June 2022. Here is the recording:\n\nIn light of on-going negotiations on the UN resolution on climate change and human rights and the presentation of the first report of the newly elected UN Special Rapporteur on the subject, this event convened a group of policymakers, experts, and representatives of civil society organizations to explore the challenges and opportunities in using the international human rights framework as a guiding compass for the just green transition. It will provide a space for key stakeholders to voice concerns on how the green transition may blindside economic, social and cultural rights and gender issues and to share initiatives and case studies that have been successful in incorporating a human rights compass to guide the green transition so that people are at the center of new policy and decision-making. In light of the annual discussion on women’s rights, the panel will specifically adopt a gender-lens to its thematic focus.\n\nPanellists\n\nAstrid Puentes Ria?o – has co-directed AIDA for 18 years, a regional organization recognized globally for their groundbreaking work on human rights, the environment and climate change. A staff of two, today has more than 30 people representing communities and working in over ten countries in the Americas. Under her leadership they trained hundreds of lawyers and community leaders on human rights, the environment and climate; produced reports on international standards; implemented strategic casework resulting on key jurisprudence, as the Colombian Constitutional Court recognizing for the first time regionally, that States should consider climate change on projects and planning. She also lead collaboratively global efforts, like the one for the recognition of the human right to a healthy environment at the Human Rights Council. For a decade she has worked to strengthen the climate justice movement, working with leading environmental and human rights organizations, such as the Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights Network, contributing a deeper understanding of climate change impacts to all human rights, threats to achievements, and advising on effective collaboration. Most recently, she has been short-listed to become the first UN Special Rapporteur on Climate Change.\n\nRodrigo Echecopar - is an economist devoted to securing social rights and supporting post-neoliberal policies. During the 2011-2012 Chilean student movement, he was a student leader and, since then, has worked with various social, political, and third sector organizations. Rodrigo was previously Deputy Director of Fundaci?n Ciudadan?a Inteligente, an NGO focused on promoting democracy and citizen participation, and was also the founder and first Director of Nuestra Am?rica Verde, a movement advocating for a Latin American green transition with social justice. He has also worked with the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, founded by economist Mariana Mazzucato, in aligning fiscal policy with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Rodrigo studied an MPA in Innovation, Public Policy, and Public Value at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at University College London (UCL). He also holds a degree in economics from the Pontificia Universidad Cat?lica de Chile.\n\nNatalia Gomez Pe?a - is EarthRights’ Climate Change Policy Advisor. Originally from Bogot?, Colombia, and a lawyer by training, Natalia has worked on human rights and environmental protection with a particular focus in Latin America for the past nine years. Before joining EarthRights, Natalia led CIVICUS’s advocacy around civic space in Latin America and environmental rights. She also supported the secretariat of the Vuka! Coalition for Civic Action working to fight back the closing of civic space. Prior to joining CIVICUS, Natalia coordinated the environmental democracy program at Asociaci?n Ambiente y Sociedad, a Colombian human rights and environment NGO. Later, she worked with RFK Human rights and the Interamerican Commission on Human rights in Washington, D.C. Natalia holds an LL.M. degree in International Legal Studies with a specialization in international human rights law and international environmental law from American University Washington College of Law.\n\nKayinga Muddu Yisito - is Network Coordinator of Community Transformation Foundation Network (COTFONE), a community network based in Greater Masaka focused on access to basic social services; youth unemployment; oil and gas management; human rights protection; child protection and land/property ownership. The development of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) is currently one of their focal issues given that many households in Greater Masaka are affected by this project. Kayinga has been instrumental in raising voices of local communities. The past year, Kayinga has been particularly active on advocating on behalf of people affected by EACOP and is an active and outspoken member of the global Stop EACOP coalition. As a result of his human rights work, he has faced a number of risks. In late February 2022, the offices of COTFONE and Kayinga’s home were broken into by unknown individuals and equipment and data, including that related to their EACOP work, was stolen."
