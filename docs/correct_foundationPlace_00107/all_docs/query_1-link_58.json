Right away, it's easy to see what makes the new Dell System 316 different from the Compaq* 386s* While they both utilize Intel’s new 386SX\" chip, the System 316 is a full featured system designed to give you uncompromising 386SX/16 MHz performance* But for a price that's some¬ where in the neighborhood of a 286-based system. Now, cynics might be inclined to think we achieved this at the expense of expandability* Obviously these people own the 4-slot Compaq, The System 316 has a total of seven open slots. Leaving you enough room to add modems or network cards, fax boards, high- performance graphics cards or tape backups. Not to mention all the hells and whistles that’ll be coming out next year* And the year after that. And the year after that. Fbint is, the Dell System 316 was designed for the long haul* Not as a passing lad. IT'S YOUR CALL. If the System 316 is beginning to sound like the perfect business computer, it’s because it is. How perfect though is entirely up to you. Because every 316 is custom configured* To give users exactly what they need* For example, the System 316 comes standard with your choice of 1 MB or 2 MB of RAM. If you’d like more, we can add as much as 8MB to die system hoard* Okay, we am add another 8MB by installing a memory expansion board* What about storage ? We can set your 316 up with a 40,100,150 or 322 MB hard drive* And a 40 or 150 MB tape drive* Tell us, what type of monitor do you prefer? VGA mono with paperwhite screen, or VGA Color Plus for high resolution colors displayed on a larger screen? Or perhaps you’d like even larger monitors, capable of displaying 1024 by 768 pixel resolution? You’ve got your choice* You’ve got your choice of operating systems, too* The 316 can run MS-DOSfOS/2, or UNIX® systems* Making it extremely versatile, as well as extremely powerful Once you’ve told us what you want, we’ll make sure what you want works, by burning-in the system unit. And even though each and every 316 we build is individually configured, they’re all guaranteed dependable just the same. DON'T GET Have you noticed how most computer retailers seem to know far too much about sales techniques and far too little about computer technology ? Ask even the simplest of questions and the answer will undoubtedly involve the highest margin item in the store* And heaven forbid you should ever have to go back there for service* Well, when you huy from us, you never set foot in a store. Because weVe eliminated it. Along with the retailer. Instead, you talk directly with a computer expert. Someone who can help you configure a system diat not only meets your needs, hut meets them for about 35% less than you'd pay a retailer. One of die things that very clearly sets a Dell system apart from other computers is not just how they're sold but how they re supported. Overkill was one description used in a PC Week article. Perhaps. But then, we think you'll agree, when something goes wrong, you want as much help as possible, right? Which is why every Dell system comes with self- diagnostic software and a toll- free technical support line. We're able to solve 90% of all problems right over the phone. The other 10% receive next-day, deskside service. Thanks to our new alliance with Xerox Corporation. And you get all this help for a full year—whenever you need it—at no extra charged You’ve probably guessed mart by now, one of the things AyfiyjW that drives us most is customer satisfaction, l So we'd like to give you the ultimate guarantee Try a System 316 in your office for a month. Run your toughest applications. Put it through its paces, at your pace. If you're not completely satisfied, send it back anytime within 30 days. And well refund your money. No questions asked. No matter how many reasons we give you to buy a Dell system, sometimes it makes more _ sense to lease one instead. Whether you need a single computer, or an entire office full, a leasing plan is just like 100% financing. So you don't tie up working capital. Or credit lines. Of course, there can also be tax advantages as well And just as we can custom configure your computers, we can see to it you get a custom designed lease plan to fit the exact needs of your business.! Maybe that explains why over half the companies in the Fortune 500 now own or lease Dell computer systems. And why in the last four PC Week polls, corporate buyers rated Dell number one in overall customer satisfaction, by a landslide. Because we give people exactly what they want. No more. No less.

EDITORIAL ■ Fred Langa The SPEC group and the BYTE Lab have both been busy creating a new suite of Unix benchmarks Y ou probably haven't heard a lot about SPEC* the Systems Per¬ formance Evaluation Coopera¬ tive, but you shouldn’t feel bad. It's a pretty exclusive club* fea¬ turing companies like IBM, Apollo* Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment Corp., Data General, Motorola, and other “heavies” in the field of workstations and high-perfor- mance personal computers. SPEC is at¬ tempting to standardize and improve Unix benchmarking. Why New Unix Benchmarks? Dhrystones, Whetstones, and the old benchmarks still used by many computer publications can’t accurately measure the performance of high-end personal com¬ puters and workstations. These ma¬ chines increasingly take advantage of mainframe and supercomputer design concepts like instruction pipelining, multiple execution units working in par¬ allel, large caches, fast memory systems, and optimizing compilers—things these old benchmarks just weren’t designed to test. Also, test suites that seek to isolate and benchmark the individual system components and subsystems, or (on the other extreme) the entire system as a “black box,” give you incomplete and misleading results. Most benchmarks in use today fail on at least one of these counts; several of the most heavily promoted computer maga¬ zine benchmarks fail on all counts. Tests originally designed for small systems simply are inadequate for today’s hard- New Unix Benchmarks ware and software. SPEC’s new bench¬ marks will be decidedly heavy-duty, aimed at machines using processors like the 68030/68040 and 80386/80486 and equipped with 16 megabytes of system memory. The SPEC tests combine low-level and applications-level evaluations. The low- level tests will show the strengths and weaknesses of individual elements in the system; the high-level elements of the suite will give a profile of the entire sys¬ tem working as an integrated unit for dif¬ ferent applications. The only major problem with the SPEC benchmarks is that they are very large and complex. The source code of the entire suite will likely exceed 100 megabytes; many of these benchmarks simply won't run on smaller or less- powerful machines. BYTE’s Unix Benchmarks The SPEC benchmarks are conceptually almost identical to the second-generation BYTE benchmarks we've been using for about a year now. (BYTE's benchmarks were the first second-generation bench¬ marks in the industry; the first bench¬ marks to work across different operating systems and platforms; and the first to combine both high- and low-level testing for a truly complete picture of system performance.) BYTE Lab’s new Unix benchmarks were designed and built on a smaller and more manageable scale than SPEC's; ours can be used to benchmark not only pricey, uHrahigh-performance ma¬ chines, but also the kinds of machines most of us (and most of our businesses) can afford to use every day. Some specifics: Our low-level Unix benchmarks are carefully designed not to be defeated by some of the tricks used by new compilers. Our high-level tests are actually custom versions of real data¬ base engines and fully implemented standard Unix programs (e.g., editors and compilers). And our benchmarks are designed explicitly to test both single- user and multiuser systems. For multiuser testing* we adapted techniques from the latest version of the internationally accepted Monash Univer¬ sity Suite for Benchmarking Unix Sys¬ tems (MUSBUS), developed in Austra¬ lia. The benchmarks feed interactive applications clocked streams of activities from simulated users on each port. The system is then exercised with an increas¬ ing load of simulated concurrent users. This lets you see how system perfor¬ mance is affected by an ever-increasing concurrent workload. For your convenience and ease of use, our new Unix benchmarks (like all our benchmarks) are in the public domain. The new Unix benchmarks should be available for downloading about the time you read this. You can get the bench¬ marks from BIX or BYTEnet. Informa¬ tion on accessing both systems appears under “Program Listings” in the table of contents. With our new Unix benchmarks in place* we’ll soon be benchmarking new systems on every appropriate major oper¬ ating system: We’ll test new 80386 and 80486 machines, for example, under DOS and OS/2 and Unix. We'll test new high-end Macs under the Mac operating system and A/UX. And so on. The idea is to multiply your options. Today’s mixed computing environment means that each of us has to know more about more machines than we ever did before. BYTE is committed to giving you the comparative, unbiased information that you will need to sort through the welter of options and to make solid deci¬ sions about whatever new hardware and software comes down the pike—regard¬ less of brand* architecture* or operating system. In a nutshell: Single-platform and sin¬ gle-operating-system solutions are passe. —Fred Langa Editor in Chief (BIX name 'flanga ”) 8 BYTE * JULY 1989 Circle 302 on Reader Service Card Why pay more for a 100% autorouter? 100% autorouting Wouldn’t it be great to delegate your routing?

They're working on some¬ thing they call Optimul (Optical Interconnect for Multiprocessor Systems), which makes use of \"‘wireless” lasers and a special coating for computer chips* The UCD team thinks its design can solve problems caused by memory contention in shared-memory systems and network bottlenecks in separate-memory systems. With sufficient funding, a crude working prototype of Optimul could be built “in about six months,” says Steven Kowel, a materials scientist on the UCD team* Optical computers would overcome the ultimate speed limits faced by tra¬ ditional computer designs. But people who have tried to build more or less completely optical computers (as Kowel says, “no silicon except maybe the input/output components”) have encountered “startlingly difficult” hardware problems, he adds. Systems that are mostly optical remain “primi¬ tive” and expensive, he says* Within the last five years, though, research has shifted toward a focus on hybrid systems. These systems handle logic, memory, and I/O electronically but use ostensibly faster optical fibers for interconnecting chores. “People have taken chips and glued them board-to-board via fiber” Kowel says. At the far reaches of this approach, some scientists are attempting “intra¬ chip” optical connections using A pple Computer has been promis¬ ing a new operating system that will swing the Macintosh into the 1990s, but some Mac users have wondered if they'd be left behind in the 1980s when the new System arrives* Based on information dispensed by Apple officials at the spring edition of the developers' holographic techniques* Kowel and cohorts Norman Matloff and Charles Eldering think their idea is more practical than “holographic interconnects,” Basically, they want to coat memory chips with a thin polymer film treated for sensitivity to electrical charges and light, producing a result somewhat like an LCD, says Kowel * A Laser beam illuminates the coated memory chip and “broadcasts” a picture of the entire contents of memory at that instant* The broadcast can be picked up by multiple proces¬ sors at once, and the beam demodu¬ lated back into electrical charges and stored as such. This constitutes a kind of “double parallelism ” according to Kowel, “across processors and across bits in memory” In a tightly coupled or shared- memory system, a wireless broadcast solves the problem of contention for memory access, Kowel says. Another kind of bottleneck arises with networked systems where there is no central memory. Even with high- bandwidth channels like fiber optics in place, a limited number of data pins feed memory contents to the optical channel; Optimul bypasses that con¬ straint by broadcasting rather than channeling data, Kowel says. Writing to memory in Optimul would still be done, at least initially, using electron¬ ics, so a data bus would remain part of the overall system* It will likely be many years, the USD designers admit, before coated Qptimul-type intercon¬ nects might be a standard part of the backplane. conference, the company is trying to maintain continuity in the Mac family* System 7.0 will have some impressive capabilities, but perhaps its most important characteristic is that it's supposed to run on everything from a Mac Plus to a Mac Ilex (as long as they have at least 2 megabytes continued NANOBYTES If OS/2 had a theme song, it could possibly be the old Sam and Dave number, “Hold on, 'Cause I’m Coming ” Even Microsoft officials admit that the operating system lacks applications to lure users. “Today, there isn't a truly compel¬ ling reason to go to OS/2, espe¬ cially if you want to run a single DOS application,\" said Microsoft vice president Scott Oki during the recent IBM PS/2 Forum in Boston. “But there will be in the next few months.\" Oki said the public doesn't see the development going on in corporations, which are con¬ verting their own mainframe programs to run under OS/2 on PS/2s* A lot of companies are de¬ veloping full-blown Presentation Manager versions of in-house applications, using the Common User Access (CUA) interface, which is the name of the “look” that IBM wants across all its systems, from mainframes to microcompu¬ ters, via the Systems Application Architecture. IBM, like any huniongous corpora¬ tion, has gotten a reputation for being somewhat inflexible. But during the PS/2 road show, Big Blue executives said the company is now taking a different approach. “We recognize that, in order to meet your needs, we need to become much more flexible ” said Paul Palmer, New England regional vice president for IBM, during a session with computer dealers. Asked to translate, another IBM official said, “It means that we're going to become even more market- driven; weTe going to go out and ask our customers what they want, and then deliver that.” Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio) is calling for the U.S. to establish the Advanced Civil Technology Agency to coordinate commercial science and technology projects* \"The time is right for the creation continued Virtual Memory, “Hot Links” Coming to the MacOS JULY 1989 -BYTE 17 MICROBYTES NANOBYTES of a civilian counterpart” to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Glenn told Microbytes Daily* Glenn stressed that ACTA is not meant to “step on the toes” of private industry; instead, the agency would augment “projects not adequately addressed by the private sector” Glenn's bill calls for three-year, $300 million funding of a “lean” agency staffed by about 35 “top- level” researchers, scientists, and engineers* Currently, about 100 congressional committees deal with science and technology issues, Glenn said* The Object Management Group has formed to promote a standard object-oriented environment* The OMG environment, which will be based on Hewlett-Packard's NewWave, will run on DOS, OS/2, and Unix systems, and, according to the backers, it will allow new applications from diverse hardware platforms to work together easily, Members of the OMG, based in Westborough, Massachusetts, include HP, Sun, Unisys, Prime, Data General, 3Com, and Gold Hill Computers* National Instruments (Austin, TX) has a new specification for a 32-bit instrumentation bus inter¬ face that it says is foster and more flexible than the GPIB (IEEE-488) spec, which some users say is poky. MXI (Multisystem Exten¬ sion Interface) is a bus-on-a-cable, a protocol extender that will allow systems using the VXI (VMEbus Extensions for Instrumentation) bus to be connected to microcom¬ puters, National has released the spec and hopes it will become a standard. Toshiba (Irvine, CA) is now sampling a new line of 256K-bit CMOS static RAM chips that offer access times of 20, 25, or 35 ns* Toshiba also has a new video RAM that it claims will “spur development of next-generation high-resolution graphics systems.” The VRAMs will be offered in 4- and 8-bit-wide versions with continued of memory). “There is no break or discontinuity in our System software,” said Apple Products president Jean-Louis Gassee* Apple said its new System will include virtual memory management, an improved Finder, “hot links” between applications, a new but backwardly compatible type and font model, a new Communications Toolbox, and a Database Access Toolbox for accessing host mainframe databases. In other words, System 7.0 will be Apple's answer to OS/2 and Unix. Virtually all current Mac applica¬ tions will run under System 7*0, Apple said. Those “ill-behaved” applications that have used the upper 8 bits of the Motorola 680x0 32-bit address space may not run under System 7.0 (these are applications that are not “32-bit dean”)* The only feature of System 7*0 that will not work on the 68000’based Mac SE and Mac Plus is the virtual memory capability, which will allow a portion of the hard disk to appear as an extension of the machine's system memory (RAM). The virtual memory capability will require the paged memory management unit (PMMU) that’s built into the 68030 or can be installed on the logic board of the 68020-based Mac II * For Mac users, one of the big break¬ throughs in System 7*0 will be the Interapplications Communications Architecture (IAC), which will support interprocess communications similar to what will be offered by Hewlett-Packard’s NewWave environ¬ ment. I AC’s “live copy/paste” will allow multiple applications to share data and dynamically link and update the data. For example, you might use a chart from a charting program in a desktop publishing package. By specifying a “live copy/paste” link, the desktop publishing document will automatically include any subsequent changes you make to the chart using the charting program. This capability is often called “hot links” or “dynamic linking” While live copy/paste is something for Mac users to look forward to, existing applications will have to be modified to take advantage of it. Most developers of new applications will certainly build in the live copy/paste function* The live copy/paste feature will also work across an AppleTalk network, Apple said, so that data can be shared and hot-linked among multiple machines. Part of System 7.0 will be Apple's new font format, which will give the Mac a WYSIWYG imaging model comparable to that of Display Post¬ Script (used on the NeXT computer)* However, Apple's new font model is in some ways better than Display PostScript—it doesn’t require a license, and it will be an open, pub¬ lished specification. Apple's new type fonts simply replace the current QuickDraw bit-mapped fonts with a new library of fonts represented mathematically using a quadratic equation algorithm. Since the new fonts are represented mathematically rather than by bit maps, they are completely scalable from one resolution to another. They will work on any output device from screens to printers to typesetters* Current Macintosh bit-mapped fonts will still be supported under System 7*0. But new applications will take advantage of the new fonts, which appear crisp even on an Imagewriter printer* Adobe Systems announced that it will offer a utility that converts Apple's new fonts to PostScript so that PostScript printers (e.g*, the Apple LaserWriter NT and NTX) will be able to print the new fonts. How¬ ever, the new fonts are independent of PostScript and will therefore also print well on less-expensive laser printers that don’t support PostScript (the LaserWriter SC, for example). Like System 6*0, System 7*0 will support the MultiFinder multitasking system, which allows multiple tasks to execute simultaneously (e*g., a com¬ munications program running in the background and a word processor in the foreground). Because System 7*0 will offer virtual memory, the current memory limitations on MultiFinder will disappear since you'll be able to allocate additional memory on the hard disk* However, System 7.0 will not support memory protection or preemp¬ tive execution of applications. These features, which are offered by Unix and OS/2, protect simultaneously executing applications from interfer¬ ing with each other or causing the entire system to go down if one application crashes. Without these protection features, there is some risk involved in using MultiFinder, and this risk will remain in System 7.0. Some of System 7.0’s other features include an improved Finder with file continued 18 BYTE* JULY 1989 NcfwQuickPascal makes this software go even faster. \\ !lti M dl QlILkRH^I Even the quickest minds tend to brake suddenly when confronting new languages.

Mousetrap intercepts the mouse interrupt calls before they reach the application program and directs them to the touchscreen driver, according to an Elographics engineer A new survey indicates that Japan is not the utopian high-teeh-auto- mation society depicted by some people on this side of the Pacific. According to the latest survey by the Japan Institute for Office Automation, there's been a drop since 1987 in the number of Japanese workers who think that office automation is making them more efficient at their jobs. The JIOA questionnaire results were more negative than in the past, with fewer respondents saying that personal computers and word processors were “creating a richer work environment” or making them more interested in their jobs.

Collins (Colo¬ rado) Workstation Laboratory. “Many of these benchmarks simply won't run on 80286-based machines because some images are 15- to 30-megabyte images” The porting of the first benchmarks onto other popular operating systems will be encouraged, SPEC members said. “But the more systems-oriented things we get, the harder it will be to move away from Unix ” according to John Mashey, a steering committee Network Innovations last year). While Apple officials provided a lot of technical details, they wouldn't say when System 7.0 will be ready. The company told developers they would see beta software sometime this fall. Randy Battat, Apple's vice president of product marketing, said the company hopes to ship final versions of System 7.0 a few months after the release of the beta software. Apple declined to release prices but indicated that there would be a “nominal fee.” require many software changes. “There never will be an application that's '486-specific,” he said. Gates predicted that a high percent¬ age of DOS machines, “80 to 90 percent ” will become Windows machines. Despite his assurances that Microsoft will continue to support DOS, Gates made it dear that he feels the direction of desktop computing is in graphical applications. In fact, Microsoft decided not to endorse DOS extenders primarily because “Ifs like telling people to write more character-based applications ” Gates said. member and vice president of systems technology at MIPS Computer Systems. Most of the SPEC benchmarks will measure performance in engineering and scientific applications, but the group expects to also someday release business application benchmarks as well as multiuser, multiprocessing, and parallel processing benchmarks. Dhrystones and Whetstones don't accurately measure workstation performance, SPEC says, because today's high-performance microcom¬ puters often lake advantage of mainframe and supercomputer design concepts. “Today's workstations and servers deliver high performance by using heavy instruction pipelining, multiple execution units working in parallel, large caches, fast memory systems, and optimizing compilers ” said Nelson.

A modem pooler allows users on a LAN to share asynchro¬ nous devices, such as modems, without each personal computer needing to have its own modem card. The basic ACS software will support as many as four serial devices and sell for $795, said Jeff Garbers, director of software development, at the recent CITEX show in Atlanta, At that time, the software was in final beta testing. Asked for his reaction to Hewlett- Packard’s acquisition of Apollo Computer, which would make HP the world’s biggest vendor of Unix workstations, Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said, “That's one less OSF member. It’s kind of a nonevent.\" Both HP and Apollo are members of the Open Software Foundation, which hopes to chal¬ lenge AT&T and Sun with its own rendition of Unix. McNealy specu¬ lated that the merger came about because “one company couldn’t go it alone, and the other couldn’t catch up.\" Speaking of OSF, the group’s schedule for releasing components of OSF/I is as follows: The Vendor Kit, for members to port the OSF kernel to their platforms, is sup¬ posed to be ready in October; the Application Kit, which will provide software developers with the OSF application environment, is slated for March 1990; the University Platform, which will be a functional ly complete OSF/1, will be given to universities and other beta sites for testing starting in May 1990; and the Commercial Platform, the OSF/1 for the rest of us, is slated for July 1990.

Weitek Pushing Its Own Math Chip for Intel’s 80486 I ntel’s 80486 chip will have its own built-in version of the 80387 math coprocessor, so some industry watchers say there won’t be much of a market for add-on math coproces¬ sors for the 80486* But that’s not so, according to Weitek (Sunnyvale, CA), maker of high-speed FPUs, Weitek has developed its own math coproces¬ sor for the 80486, called the Abacus 4167, that the company claims offers two to three times faster numeric per¬ formance than that offered by the 80486. Despite the built-in 80387 coproces¬ sor on the 80486, Weitek hopes to convince OEMs to provide the 142- pin socket on their 80486 logic boards* Such a socket is required to accommodate the new 4167 coprocessor. According to Weitek product manager Mauro Bononxi, Weitek already has lined up several OEMs to support the new chip. The 4167 offers foil binary compatibility with Weitek’s 3167 coprocessor, which can be used in several major 80386-based systems, including the Compaq Deskpro 386, the HP Vectra, and the 5un386i. Compatibility with the older 3167 coprocessor is important because it will allow the chip to run a growing number of applications that support the 3167, These applications include VersaCAD, CADKE Y, Mathematica, Ansys, the HOOPS graphics package, and many other products for scientific, engineering, and statistical analysis. Several major vendors of DOS and Unix compilers offer C, FORTRAN, and Pascal compilers for the 3167 (Green Hills, Silicon Valley Software, MetaWare, Lahey, and MicroWay). The new Weitek chip could fill a need in the market, but industry observers see good news and bad news ahead. The good news is that the 80387 is probably inadequate for some serious number-crunching applica¬ tions; ifs simply not in the same league as RISC processors like the i860 or R3000* This is where Weitek sees an opportunity. The bad news is Intel’s i860, a RISC chip that not only is a fast math coprocessor but also contains an on- chip graphics engine. This is signifi¬ cant since most number crunchers will probably be used in some way with graphics, which basically kills two birds with one stone* Add to that the fact that IBM seems firmly planted behind the i860 (it already has shown an experimental graphics card based on the i860), and you see some rough going for the Weitek chip* The existing base of software that will work with the 4167 will give that chip at least a temporary advantage over the i860; software that works with the Intel RISC chip is at least a year away. And, according to Bonomi, the 4167 compares favorably to the i860 in scalar numeric opera¬ tions. Although the i860 is optimized for vector operations, most applica¬ tions are still designed to perform scalar numeric computations, (Vector calculations involve a scheme in which multiple calculations are performed simultaneously, rather than sequentially as in the scalar computa¬ tional model*) The Weitek 4167 will be priced at $565 in 1000-unit quantities, adding between $1000 and $1500 to the retail cost of 80486 systems that include the 4167* The new Weitek chip is sup¬ posed to ship in sample quantities in September* continued 26 BYTE - JULY 1989 PC EXPERTS AGREE: Proteus offers the fastest for the least, and supports them the most.

JULY 1989 * BYTE 29 MICROBYTES ATs Get Boost from NT’s New Coprocessor NANOBYTES window that puts source and edited material onto the screen. The basic Avid/I sells for about $50,000 with an 8-megabyte Mac Hx and a 600-megabyte hard disk drive, which can hold about 25 minutes of video. Meta-Software (Campbell, CA) has ported its HSPICE program for simulating analog circuits to 80386-based personal computers. The $4000 software requires an 80387 coprocessor and at least 4 megabytes of RAM. Microsoft has started shipping version 5.0 of its FORTRAN Opti¬ mizing Compiler. This one will support OS/2’s 16-megabyte ad¬ dressing capability and dynamic link libraries. It’s also designed to support a wide variety of VAX and VS syntax, the company said. Besides a new graphics library, the $450 compiler package comes with a new version of CodeView for working with OS/2 programs as big as 128 megabytes. The Instrument Society of America (Research Triangle Park, NC) has a new quarterly magazine, Industrial Computing, covering the use of computers on the factory floor. Informix (Lenexa, KS) says it will develop a version of WingZ, the very graphical spreadsheet program that runs on the Mac, for Apollo’s line of Unix-based workstations. The program will use OSF/Motif as its user inter¬ face, a spokesperson said. Database for chemists; The National Institute of Standards and Technology is offering a new database of 2000 chemical reactions and more than 5000 data entries compiled by MST scien¬ tists. The agency says the database (NIST Standard Reference Database 17, Gas Kinetics) is a good tool for modeling combus¬ tion systems or chemical processes taking place in the atmosphere. (Contact the Office of Standard Reference Data, NIST, A320 Physics Building, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (301) 975-2208.) O wners of AT-type systems who rely on a math coprocessor are in for a boost, and it isn’t coming from Intel, A young company called Integrated Information Technology (Santa Clara, CA) plans to start shipping a chip that will serve as a direct, and speedier, replacement for Intel’s 80287 FPU. The IIT chip, which can run at up to 20 MHz, will plug into sockets that are designed for the Intel 80287, and it is designed to work with exactly the same software. IIT officials told Microbytes Daily that they plan to match their chip’s pricing with that of Intel’s (80287s currently average on the street in the $200 to $250 range) while offering several improvements. The IIT chip is virtually a superset of the Intel 80287, but it differs in several important ways. The company says its chip can run all current software that works with the Intel 80287 but also has special matrix instructions, which speed up certain kinds of math operations, including A dvances in miniaturization and electronic packaging have yielded the first truly hand-held workstation. The new Agilis System, designed by engineers formerly with GRID, 3Com, and NeXT, is a modu¬ lar, battery-powered, 8088- or 80386- based computer that’s about the size of a notebook and weighs from 4 to 10 pounds. It has a touch-screen interface connected to Microsoft Windows, which allows the user to operate the system with one hand. There’s also built-in Ethernet and an optional radio Ethernet module, which allows wireless Ethernet networking at a range of up to 1 kilometer. The Agilis System, made from mggedized plastic, is built on the concept of modular slices, with each slice providing a component of the system. There’s a CPU component, or manipulating three-dimensional graphics. (These instructions, how¬ ever, won’t be useful unless software developers design their programs to make use of them.) Perhaps most important, the IIT chip, even at the same dock speed, performs floating¬ point math “two to three times as last” as Intel’s 80287, IIT officials said. If you have an 80287 in your computer, you could pull it out, pop an IIT 80287 into the socket, and get better perfor¬ mance, DT engineers claimed. According to Chi-Shin Wang and Y. W. Sing, the engineers who cofounded the company, they’ve been able to come up with a faster chip by completely redesigning the coproces¬ sor. Instead of trying to “reverse engineer” Intel’s chip, ITT took Intel’s specifications and designed the new chip from the ground up, they said. As a result, the IIT chip has a much larger percentage of its area devoted to actually performing floating-point math, and four times as many registers as the Intel chip. “processor slice,” a communications slice, a data storage slice, and a battery-power slice. Data can be stored on memory cards, floppy disks, or the new Prairie Technology 2 J ^-inch hard disk drives. An adapter allows the system to run on 12-volt direct current. The device is designed spe¬ cifically for use in the field. The wireless networking capability allows the user (say an airplane mechanic) to connect to a host mainframe to retrieve maintenance proce¬ dures, for example. An 80C88 processor slice with display and battery power will cost over $4000. An 80386 system starts at about $8000 and goes up from there depending on the configuration.

Michael Vose showed in his review of The First Electronic Computer: The Atanasoff Story by Alice R, Burks and Arthur W. Burks (Septem¬ ber 1988), A reviewer, especially in the pages of BYTE, should acknowledge that this “story” is not just a deeper look at an interesting machine but also a concerted effort to discredit my father. Dr. John W. Mauchly* who is the coinventor of the ENIAC. In their book, Alice and Arthur Burks make two huge claims—first, that J- V. Atanasoff invented “the first electronic computer/* and second, that John Mauchly stole the idea of the computer from him. Both are false, as virtually the entire computer history community agrees. Why didn’t Vose question these claims? As a typical BYTE reader, I am well versed in computer architecture, and it is obvious to me that Atansoff s machine was not “the first electronic computer.” You can examine each word, one at a time, to see if the description fits. To be the “first” machine means to be the first machine that actually worked. Surely “the first airplane” is the one that flew, not the one that could have flown had all the bugs been worked out.
