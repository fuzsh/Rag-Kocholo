Perhaps a new program has begun to load, or the program you were using just crashed. Your eyes start to adjust, and you begin to see a multitude of dim points of light in the distance, spread out like stars across a moonless sky. You gaze into the distance and wonder where this galaxy has come from. After a few seconds, you realize what lies before you. The screen is blank. VR has trained you to look off into the virtual distance. But what floats before your eyes is just the interior back wall of the headset, a few centimeters away. The moment you recognize the speckled darkness as part of the interface, the night sky before you violently contracts.1 You cannot see a VR headset while you wear it. As soon as you put the display against your face, the stereoscopic imagery forces your visual perspective through to the other side of the screen. Because you cannot move your head independently of the headset, it is impossible to put some perspectival distance between you and the medium. This interface comes far closer to the head than a cinema screen at the end of an auditorium, a television positioned opposite a couch, or even a smartphone at arm’s length. The proximity of the head-mounted display makes it impossible to see the screen as a screen.2 The same goes for VR headphones positioned over the ears. The binaural audio pulls your auditory focus away from the interface itself and\n\n2INTRO D U C TIO N\n\ninto a larger virtual space that surrounds you on all sides. In most contemporary commercial VR interfaces, plastic controllers keep your hands full as well. Vision, hearing, and touch are all routed away from the local environment and focused instead on the sensory inputs coming from the device. Never entirely, of course: sometimes you can look out through the gap around the nose bridge and catch a glimpse of a wall, person, or piece of furniture—often just before you crash into them. But for the VR interface to function at all, it must first reroute most of the audio, visual, and (often) tactile cues humans use to locate themselves in the world. The device overwhelms humans’ primary means of spatial localization. Immersion is often just another word for enclosure. Once you strip away the claims to immediacy and presence that are made for VR, what’s left is a device that blocks perceptual access to the proximate world. Most industry and critical discourse about VR focuses on the worlds made vivid within the headset. But what if the key to VR’s cultural significance was not the seemingly three-dimensional spaces that eventually load, but this initial move to voluntarily sever sensory connections with the local environment? To understand the cultural politics of VR means to grasp the politics of perceptual enclosure. What draws people to stand alone in a room with a brick-sized monitor strapped to their face? Why stare into the glass and plastic in search of deeper meaning? What calls people to hand over almost all their spatial cues about their physical place in the world to a computer? To find an answer to these questions demands a step back from the fixation on bringing users “through the screen” into a virtual space. The focus shifts instead to historicizing the emergent split between “real” and “virtual,” and to understanding why people would want to leave their awareness of this world behind in the first place. Approaching the VR headset as a perceptual enclosure rather than an immersive gateway clarifies the interface’s critical position in media history, both during the initial turn to interactive fantasy worlds in the 1980s and 1990s, and more recently as part of the contemporary era of “walled garden” networked internet platforms. In both periods, the headset manifested the most extreme instance of a broader transformation in the everyday media environment. The first was the move toward what I call (after Nango Yoshikazu) the “one-person space.” The second, more\n\nINTRO D U C TIO N3\n\nrecently, is the campaign to shift embodied social interaction onto a more fully computational—and thus more fully controllable—virtual platform.\n\nPERCEPTUAL ENCLOSURE\n\nThe concept of enclosure has long been debated by historians and political theorists. I invoke that lineage quite deliberately here. Enclosure discourse initially coalesced around analyses of the English enclosure movement of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where individual owners claimed parcels of land once available for common use. Karl Marx famously took an interest in the social and economic ramifications of this transition as an example of “primitive accumulation” by agricultural capital.3 Media theorists working from this tradition have sought to update Marx’s focus on the rearrangement of labor relations through land privatization. They point to how new media technologies now play a key role in the exploitation of once-public space. What Mark Andrejevic calls “digital enclosure,” for example, marks the use of ubiquitous computing technologies in “an attempt to compel or entice entrance into a monitored space that helps rearrange relations of consumption and production.”4 If earlier modes of enclosure sought to limit movement through physical barriers and legal contracts, digital enclosure instead allows for surveillance and behavioral manipulation without obvious interference in a person’s freedom of movement. Rather than draw a firm boundary line between domains, digital enclosure sinks into the background and follows individuals wherever they go. This more indirect and environmental intervention allows supervisory control to extend far beyond the workplace and into an ever-wider range of everyday spaces. The VR headset is one of a range of interfaces extending the reach of the digital enclosure into the space directly adjacent to the body. Others include augmented reality (AR) glasses, other so-called wearables like the Apple Watch, and a wide range of internet-connected appliances and smart digital assistants taking up residence in every room of the house. Much recent critical VR discourse rightfully focuses on the headset’s potential for new levels of invasive tracking and surveillance. This includes the potential use and abuse of biometric data from eye, head, and hand\n\n4INTRO D U C TIO N\n\nmovements, as well as an ever-larger number of onboard sensors focused both inward at a user’s body and outward at the surrounding space.5 Yet the cultural politics of perceptual enclosure go far beyond these concerns with the capture of biometric and environmental data. This was already clear from Mark Weiser’s early attempt to distinguish his notion of “ubiquitous computing” from the then-ascendent concept of “virtual reality” in 1991. Ubiquitous computing’s attempt to blend computational interfaces seamlessly into the existing landscape was set out in direct opposition to the VR headset’s rejection of the environmental surround. Whereas ubiquitous computing, Weiser envisioned, works on “invisibly enhancing the world that already exists,” VR “focuses an enormous apparatus on simulating the world.”6 Or to rephrase this in perceptual terms: whereas ubiquitous computing aims to remain in the attentional background, the VR interface works to computationally commandeer the entirety of a person’s perceptual horizons, both background and foreground. As it moves into the space right around the body, VR remakes how people perceive and locate themselves within the broader worlds they inhabit. Unlike the largely impersonal sensor networks of ubiquitous computing, VR is entirely organized around a first-person perceptual logic.7 VR positions a user at the very center of the apparatus and builds out a simulated world relative to their perspective and orientation. If legal enclosure now focuses on concepts like intellectual property and copyright, and digital enclosure seeks to control space through data surveillance, what I call perceptual enclosure accrues spatial power through an intervention at the very moment humans encounter their surrounding environment. VR appears to offer a world focused entirely on an individual’s perception, while in the process enclosing their every perspective on the world.\n\nTHE AMBIENT POWER P LAY\n\nHistories of VR traditionally lump the head-mounted interface together with larger architectures aimed at sensory immersion, like Robert Barker’s eighteenth-century panoramas or, more recently, big-screen cinemas.8 Like VR, panoramas and large-format screens can reach deep into a human’s sense of spatial awareness, sometimes enough to make a person\n\nINTRO D U CTIO N5\n\ndizzy.9 And all media take up some portion of a person’s perceptual field. But there is a qualitative difference in how the VR interface latches onto the head and hands as it simultaneously strips away the local environment. This difference is in the way VR leverages both bilateral sense perception and movement tracking to locate a person more completely within a virtual space. The term ambient is often applied to media that slip into the atmospheric background. As I argued in Ambient Media, however, the word can be understood more precisely to refer to media that directly seek to interface with the bilateral organization of the human senses.10 The literary critic Leo Spitzer’s classic essay on the history of the word notes how the Latin prefix ambi- emphasizes the use of “both sides (right and left)” by a subject that encounters or acts on an environment, such as the “both hands” of the ambidextrous.11 Drawing out this distinction further, the Italian studies and comparative literature scholar Karen Pinkus notes that while much scholarship on ambience positions it as something that “surrounds,” the word’s etymology reveals how ambience is in fact “perceived, written about, and comprehended by a subject whose senses function in right/left pairs (eyes, ears, hands). Given that the human subject is or can be ambisensorial, binaural, binocular, it is possible that ambi-, when involved with the subject rather than with what surrounds him or her, cedes some of its general fuzziness to a more strictly binary directionality.”12 Rather than focus on a shared spatial background (or atmosphere), an ambience becomes immersive only once it passes through “both sides” of the human body and is composited by human perception into a full three-dimensional space. In this sense, VR is a deeply ambient interface. The headset relies not just on bilateral sense perception but also the near-continual pivoting of the eyes, head, and torso. VR triangulates the perceptual gap between the two sides of the body to position the user at the center of their own individualized three-dimensional space. While binaural audio, stereoscopic visuals, and physical movement tracking each have a longer history, VR emerges when all three are combined to mediate spatial awareness more fully. VR usurps both focused and peripheral audiovisual perception in every direction and updates these stereo fields every time VR users shift their perspective. This means upwards of sixty to ninety times per second with current-generation headsets.\n\n6 INTRO D U CTIO N\n\nThink of this as a kind of ambient power play. Rather than fade into the atmospheric background like ubiquitous computing, VR disappears into the space immediately around the head. VR’s much touted immediacy works by hiding the mediation just above a person’s nose, or, more precisely, the interface hides in the gap between the left and right sides of the perceptual body. A person is then given no choice but to rely on the headset’s own stereo images and sounds to piece the perceptual world back together again.13 In practice, the immediacy of VR is belied by how awkward and even painful the headset experience can be when it doesn’t match with your body or with the immediate space. While more comfortable than in decades past, current-generation headsets can be hard to forget. They slide down your forehead, interfere with your hairstyle, and slip out of focus. While in VR you might trip on cables, bump into unseen furniture, or find yourself low on power. When you remove the headset, you might find yourself with eye strain and neck pain or with motion sickness from a mismatch between actual and simulated movement.14 It is almost as if these physical signals are offering a warning: be careful when the virtual world and the physical world start to fall out of sync.15\n\nJAPAN’S EMBRACE OF PERCEPTUAL ENCLOSURE\n\nAmerican VR discourse has leaned heavily on a rhetoric of immediacy as an immersive ideal. Despite engineers’ self-deprecating jokes about “face-sucking goggles,” popular VR discourse in the United States has long been eager to draw attention away from the machinations of the device itself.16 Assertions of VR as a “medium-less medium” dominated the English-language discourse in the 1990s, situating the headset as nothing less than “a medium whose purpose is to disappear.”17 The goal was to distract from VR’s role as a media interface by equating it instead with the immediacy of everyday perception. This was exactly Jaron Lanier’s strategy when he popularized the phrase “virtual reality” in the late 1980s, claiming “it’s not even a medium. It’s a new reality.”18 Prominent American VR proponents today rely on the same rhetorical strategies to situate VR as a functional substitute for real-world situations.\n\nINTRO D U C TIO N7\n\nStanford VR researcher Jeremy Bailenson’s 2018 book uses almost identical language: “VR technology is designed to make itself disappear. When VR is done right, all the cumbersome equipment—the goggles, the controller, the cables—vanishes.”19 The market for VR as a training, design, and experimental psychology device with “ecological validity” relies heavily on these frequent assertions of virtual-real equivalency. This extends into the development and marketing of consumer-facing VR games and software. Facebook’s “Oculus Best Practices Guide,” for example, suggests that developers “not remind users that their virtual world is constructed.”20 The rhetoric of immediacy draws attention away from the fact of enclosure. But this is not the only approach. Japanese VR developers often adopt a different strategy: the embrace of perceptual enclosure as key to what the headset offers. In Japan, the headset’s ability to block out the world becomes a primary feature rather than something to be disavowed. VR promises not just entry into another world but a way to perceptually bracket out the current one—and a user’s place within it. In both the United States and Japan, VR has been shaped by the cultural imagination around the technology as much as by the interface itself. For example, Facebook’s “Go Virtually Everywhere” campaign in the United States for their Oculus Go headset contained a clear echo of Microsoft’s famous mid-1990s “Where Do You Want to Go Today?” campaign for the Windows 95 operating system. Invoking a Platonic divide between matter and spirit, both promised the ability to transcend physical limitations and render the whole world virtually for a user. Media scholar Ken Hillis argues that this aspect of VR is tied to a specifically American fantasy: “the notion of a sense of individual renewal coupled to encountering a spatial frontier.”21 In contrast, Japanese advertisements for early internet-enabled phones from companies like NTT Docomo and KDDI focused on how the devices could help a person arrange meetings on the fly and get more done while out and about in the city. Early 1990s Japanese VR demonstrations like Matsushita’s popular order-made kitchen studio similarly focused less on individual freedom and more on selling enhanced control over the local environment. Today, titles like Comolu (Dentsū, 2018) maintain this focus on VR as a way to perceptually rework the local space. VR is understood as a way to carve out a more personalized and controllable realm from within the existing world.\n\n8 INTRO D U CTIO N\n\nComolu is a homonym for the Japanese verb komoru, meaning “to withdraw.” Presented as a reflective, three-dimensional mood-board for those who want to brainstorm in virtual space, the Comolu campaign featured the tagline Atama ni komotte, kangaeyō (“Let’s withdraw inside our heads and think”).22 The hooded robes from designer label HATRA released in tandem with the application further situate VR use as part of a monastic, retreat-from-the-world scenario (figure 0.1). Game director Kashiwakura Haruki of Tokyo-based VR developer MyDearest similarly approaches VR as an isolated environment for media consumption, where all distractions can be eliminated in favor of enhanced focus on a virtual narrative: I want to read in VR. Because I’m the type of guy where when I read, information from the edge of my visual perception and sounds from my surroundings are too much of an interruption. I want to shift both into VR, where I can relax and focus only on the book’s content.23\n\nFIGURE 0.1 The Comolu Wear outfit designed by Nagami Keisuke of HATRA for the Comulu VR software.

See http://comolu.info/.\n\nINTRO D U C TIO N9\n\nFrom this perspective, the most important attribute of the headset is its ability to offer a diminished reality, a tool that brackets out all but the task at hand.24\n\nTHE TURN TO OTHER WORLDS\n\nThis approach to VR enclosure extends to how VR has been taken up by Japanese consumers, often to the surprise of the devices’ American manufacturers. While the relatively limited motion tracking of Facebook’s Oculus Go headset was derided in the American press as “a step backward,” in Japan the portability and small scale of the device was readily understood as part of a long tradition of personal media technologies offering to carve out a private imaginative space in rather tight quarters.25 The Japanese approach to VR has focused less on the realistic simulation of actual environments and more on what the head-mounted interface helps a person to bracket out perceptually: the immediate spatial, social, and historical contexts in which they might otherwise be stuck. Japan’s more direct embrace of head-mounted perceptual enclosure points toward a different way of understanding the VR interface. While the technology that came to be recognized as virtual reality was initially developed in the United States, Japan is where VR was first repackaged as a consumer technology. And from the early days of the Walkman up through the more recent stand-alone headsets, Japan is where the social and cultural ramifications of the one-person virtual space have been explored most deeply. In The Immersive Enclosure: Virtual Reality in Japan, I build from these Japanese perspectives to present a new approach to the VR interface, focusing on the ambient power play and the headset’s contentious demands for perceptual enclosure. In the process, I use this approach to launch a broader examination into the cultural politics of the new media environments emerging in Japan across this period. The high-growth decades of the 1950s and 1960s promised Japanese citizens—especially men—unprecedented levels of control over their local environment in exchange for hard work and personal sacrifice to the company and the nation. This period saw a shift away from shared public entertainments and toward material goods and\n\n10 INTRO D U C TIO N\n\ntechnologies focused on domestic life: the family home (ideally with a room for each child), a family car, a television set, and a hi-fi stereo.26 While the student political activism of the 1960s had initially pushed against this retreat into the private sphere of consumption, these collective movements largely collapsed inward by the early 1970s. The 1973 oil shock demonstrated how the previous high-growth trajectory of the Japanese economy was no longer so assured. Evidence of industrialization’s toxic effects on Japan’s physical landscape became more pronounced, and the “natural” environment could no longer be considered an endlessly exploitable resource.27 The middle-class promise of spatial control and self-determination via the domestic sphere also started to fray with the emergence of new lifestyles and identities less beholden to the traditional family structure. For individuals faced with a decline in economic, environmental, and social power, media technologies emerged as one area where personal control over space could still be achieved: if not in the real world, then in virtual domains.28 By the latter part of the 1970s, the focus began to shift from broader movements for social and political transformation to the more private space of personal media. The family-oriented interfaces that had dominated the high-growth years started to be bent to more individual ends.29 Media devices like the Walkman moved closer to the body, isolating the individual in privatized perceptual bubbles and promising people more direct control over their own virtually mediated horizons. Individuals set out in search of new sensory experiences and projects of self-experimentation on the personal rather than the collective level.30 Concurrently, the era heralded what Japanese cultural critics have described as a mass turn away from concern with existing Japanese social conditions and political legacies in favor of immersion in the alternative “virtual histories” presented in genre fiction, manga, and anime.31 By the end of the 1980s, a new era of interactive role-playing games placed the individual resolutely at the heart of these alternate pasts. Media users could now move into and take control over vast imaginary worlds provided by a computer. In many cases, what the new interfaces offered was less a new ideology or identity and more a new perceptual and experiential space within which a desired self could be generated and sustained. While rarely considered in tandem, the turn to virtual spaces (in the new media technologies) and to virtual histories (in the new media narratives)\n\nINTRO D U C TIO N11\n\nwere fully intertwined. Each were part of a turn away from the given social situation in favor of more fully mediated, first-person worlds. When virtual reality crossed the Pacific to reach Japan in the early 1990s, it was quickly understood as part of this broader shift to personally mediated fantasy environments. VR promised Japanese consumers even more immersive first-person perceptual horizons. Often steeped in a rhetoric of colonial conquest, the emergent consumer VR imaginary tapped directly into the desire for personal spatial control. Launched off the momentum of video games and other interactive media, the new VR users were imagined as no less than master and commander of their own virtual domain. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the Japanese government and consumer electronics industries saw in VR an opportunity to regain ground lost to the United States in the shift to computer-based consumer electronics. Entrepreneurial Japanese engineers and bureaucrats were eager to compete with the United States over the next high-tech market and quickly staked out a central role in the first VR boom of the early 1990s, spurring the VR hype to ever-greater heights. By 1991, Japan was already home to more VR systems than anywhere else in the world—albeit at a time when the global total was still only about 400.32 While consumer VR was still in its infancy, the ideas behind the technology exercised a strong pull over the popular imagination, catalyzing a growing desire for mediated virtual alternatives to everyday Japanese life. By the mid-1990s, the major Japanese video game console and home electronics manufacturers would each launch ambitious, if mostly ill-fated, attempts at a consumer VR product. The collapse of Japan’s asset price bubble and the slide into a major recession in the 1990s soon slammed the brakes on this early VR market, but the subsequent economic uncertainty only intensified the desire for alternate virtual worlds. While VR development retreated into university and corporate research laboratories during the long “VR winter” that followed, Japanese storytellers in a wide range of media continued to produce a steady stream of VR-themed narratives. These in turn helped shape VR’s image when it reemerged as a consumer device in the mid-2010s. The precise reasons for this reemergence are beyond the scope of this book, but a major factor was access to small, inexpensive, high-resolution screens for use in VR displays, made available thanks to the explosion of the smartphone market in the intervening years.33 There are now tens of\n\n12INTRO D U C TIO N\n\nmillions of VR headsets in circulation as opposed to hundreds, and Japan has quickly reemerged as one of the biggest consumer VR markets. After the mid-2010s revival, Japanese video game and software developers swiftly dove back into the medium, while the Japanese tech hobbyist community immediately began to take apart the headset and imagine new uses for it.34 With 2016 widely touted in Japan as the “first year of the VR era” (VR gannen), the headset emerged as a new consumer-facing platform for fictional narratives, games, social events, education, pornography, real estate, therapy, tourism, and more. Location-based VR arcades sprouted up in media consumption hubs like Shinjuku’s Kabukichō neighborhood and Ikebukuro’s Sunshine City, while stand-alone headsets sparked a growing Japanese market for at-home VR.35 The fantasy worlds of anime, manga, video games, and light novels now served not just as a place to imagine a VR future but also as source material for actual VR titles. There are now essentially two overlapping VR scenes in Japan. One consists of labs at elite universities and research centers that have quietly continued their hardware interface research since the 1990s, largely detached from broader cultural trends. The other consists of commercial and hobbyist VR software developers who draw heavily on Japan’s existing popular media to build out alternate worlds within the new VR platforms.\n\nMEDIA MIX AS MEDIA ENCLOSURE\n\nJapanese VR thus emerged directly out of transformations in the Japanese media environment, intensifying the late 1970s turn to fictional worlds. Today Japanese consumer VR is fully integrated with the broader Japanese media industries that first took shape in the last decades of the twentieth century, focused on a mix of anime, manga, light novels, video games, idol singers, and other popular texts that offer alternative fantasy worlds set apart from everyday social concerns. There is a strong recognition within the domestic VR scene that if Japan is to maintain a position in an increasingly global VR industry, it will be by leveraging the audiences and aesthetics of these already popular media. The country is now home to one of the most distinctive markets for VR entertainment software. In\n\nINTRO D U CTIO N13\n\n2020 Facebook decided to start a separate Oculus VR store just for Japan, in acknowledgment of the country’s highly active VR developer and hobbyist community and its distinct consumer tastes.36 As Japanese VR entrepreneur and developer Shin Kiyoshi describes it, “while the VR business in Europe and America aims at ‘building a space around humans that is essentially the same as the real world,’ in Japan attention often goes instead to ‘building imaginary worlds full of lively characters.’ ”37 Mizutani Kyōhei of Tokyo-based VR platform STYLY similarly observes how “Western countries view VR as a real-life simulator whereas Japanese people use VR to become something different from their real-life selves,” drawing on the anime, manga, and game industries’ focus on an “escape to an imaginary world.”38 The focus here is on a departure from rather than a replication of actual places. In this context, the perceptual enclosure of the headset becomes a key means to bracket out existing social contexts and escape more fully to another realm. The VR enclosure reveals a new side of the broader Japanese media mix focused on anime-styled fictional environments. Pioneered by the publisher Kadokawa in the 1990s, this marketing strategy gave consumers many different access points to a fictional universe through light novels, manga, anime, video games, toys, and magazines. No single piece of media would give the whole story, and audiences would move deeper into the fantasy world as they collected the different component parts and interacted to create new additions of their own.39 Most analyses of this anime-centered media mix point to the local affective bonds between fans and fictional characters as the glue that holds the whole system together.40 More recent “media ecology” approaches diagram the broader circulation of media objects across technological infrastructures and distribution networks.41 VR suggests instead a more basic strategy is at work between these two scales: the use of media to perceptually block out existing social and physical spaces and thus center the consumer in a more controllable virtual realm instead. While these other approaches tend to flatten media circulation into abstract two-dimensional diagrams, I focus here on the interface between perceiving bodies and media technologies as they encounter each other in everyday three-dimensional space. Media scholar Marc Steinberg notes the “environmental diffusion” of character merchandise as part of the media mix strategy; I understand this quite literally as a quest to remake the\n\n14INTRO D U CTIO N\n\nlocal perceptual environment by pasting over the given landscape with the alternate horizons of a more desirable virtual world.42 The media mix promises consumers the ability to circulate continuously within the same immersive media universe without the need to face back out toward a nonvirtual reality. At the same time, corporations can reap the profits not just from the occasional media diversion but from an entire perceptual supply chain. The VR headset takes this strategy of personalized environmental immersion up a notch, offering not just life-sized, three-dimensional renditions of imaginary characters but entire 360-degree worlds to become perceptually situated within. While early studies of the Walkman and related personal media environments in Japan often emphasized their tendency toward atomism and isolation,43 the more explicitly interactive and networked spaces of contemporary VR suggest the turn to media enclosure is not driven by antisocial or anticommunicative desires, but rather by the promise of alternate social worlds that allow end users more direct control over their appearance and their ambient surroundings. While the emotions and ideologies that course through the VR imagination remain important in the analysis that follows, the VR enclosure points toward a more fundamental question: How do media determine what becomes perceptible as part of a given “world,” and what—often quite deliberately—gets bracketed out?44 This history of mediated perceptual enclosure suggests it is not enough to consider how gender, race, disability, and other dimensions of social subjectivity function at the level of representation or affect. Nor is it satisfactory to simply ignore the end user to focus on deeper infrastructures at work behind the scenes. The VR enclosure instead points to how media technologies work to render certain parts of social life imperceptible in the first place. A VR user can acoustically and visually bracket off their surrounding domestic space, the people they live with, and even their own body while simultaneously opening up menus to choose (for example) their virtual appearance, virtual environment, and who else may or may not approach them within that virtual space. VR promises escape from situatedness in the given environment, even as it grants new powers of perceptual manipulation to those privileged enough to control the virtual realm. This in turn lays the groundwork for the emerging “walled garden” immersive platforms of the current century, most notably Facebook’s\n\nINTRO D U CTIO N15\n\nquest to build the next big social media platform inside VR via their own Oculus hardware.45 The ambient power play here operates simultaneously at the level of VR user and VR developer. Consumer VR grants users enhanced control over the world as it appears to their senses. Simultaneously, the headset hands access to a person’s spatial awareness to the companies controlling the VR platforms. As I explore in this book, the tension between these two modes of control is key for understanding the perceptual politics of the head-mounted interface. At both levels, the VR enclosure favors those with both the technological skills and media literacies to navigate and shape these computational spaces.\n\nSITUATIN G THE INTE R FAC E\n\nWhile recognized as a major site of VR history and development, Japan has long been sidelined in VR discourse. The country haunts the margins of most English-language VR studies, never entirely absent but never fully present either. Japan reliably makes a brief cameo appearance in English-language trade books about 1990s VR, but only as a poorly understood, peculiar sidebar to what becomes a mainly Euro-American narrative.46 Language barriers and a general unfamiliarity with the country among American and European VR researchers remains an obstacle, despite the best efforts of VR researchers and journalists (largely but not exclusively from Japan) traveling extensively back and forth between continents. Through my focus on how VR intersects historically with broader transformations in Japan’s media environment, I aim to challenge the presentation of VR in both industry and academic contexts as either uniquely American (as in Hillis’s work), or, more commonly, as a placeless and contextless “universal” technology.47 This latter kind of universalism, implicit in much English-language technology discourse, simply assumes a North American or European context can stand in as the default setting for the rest of the world. This approach to VR as inherently placeless is common even in studies closely focused on questions of perception. Media theorist Mark B. N. Hansen’s phenomenological approach to VR set out in Bodies in Code, for example, productively foregrounds the possibilities that VR offers to\n\n16 INTRO D U C TIO N\n\nexperiment with perception, but almost entirely brackets off the social and historical contexts surrounding VR use.48 Attempts to understand “the virtual” at a purely philosophical level end up obscuring how and why the virtual/reality binary became attractive in the first place. By locating how VR emerges out of a particular cultural and historical context, I aim to challenge all such attempts to situate VR in a vacuum. I also hope to inspire other researchers to address the local specificity of how VR takes shape in other parts of the world.49 My research methods here aim to capture “both sides” of VR as a media phenomenon, considering both fictional and nonfictional contexts. I find it methodologically productive to cross-reference materials documenting actual VR technologies (including journalism, advertising, industry publications, and research papers) with fictional portrayals of how people relate to VR in practice. The former helps me situate VR’s tumultuous emergence as a consumer-facing technology historically, while the latter offers a much more nuanced way to trace the shifting and often conflicted emotions swirling around VR as an idea. I draw on both approaches to track how Japanese attitudes toward VR and media enclosure have transformed over time. While my focus here is on the VR hardware interface rather than any specific VR software, my analysis is grounded in a broad exploration of VR titles from Japan and elsewhere, as well as their associated development platforms like Unity and Unreal Engine. Along the way I attended many VR-related events in Japan and the United States, starting from the early days of the mid-2010s VR revival. I spoke with commercial and indie VR developers, academic VR researchers, and everyday VR users while closely tracking day-to-day developments in the Japanese VR scene both in person and online. While not always explicitly marked on the page, these broader contexts inform my textual and archival analyses throughout the book. The chapters are loosely chronological, moving from the initial emergence of the one-person media space up through recent developments in the consumer VR scene. Overall, the first three chapters focus more on the research and technology context, while the latter two turn toward VR as a form of popular culture. Through these combined perspectives, The Immersive Enclosure sets out a historical and theoretical framework for understanding the cultural politics of immersive perceptual control.\n\nINTRO D U C TIO N17\n\nChapter 1, “Acoustics of the One-Person Space,” tracks the emergence of head-mounted ambient mediation back into the realm of spatial audio. I focus on the history of headphone listening and the initially rocky cultural reception of this more private perceptual space. I am particularly interested here in what had to happen to the broader built environment for people to start to want to isolate themselves within a one-person perceptual enclosure. I emphasize the central role of sound in the history of immersive media, using Japanese audio-engineering debates over the “sound in the head problem” to draw out a sonic prehistory for the later head-mounted space of VR. Chapter 2, “Translating the Virtual into Japanese,” tracks the emergence of VR as a technology and as a concept in the United States and Japan as part of the popular VR boom of the early 1990s. I explore how the valence of Lanier’s term virtual reality transforms as it is taken up and translated into Japanese. This Japanese understanding of the term shifts VR away from both the American military history and the West Coast techno-utopian context, and toward a reimagining of the technology as a more personal medium for accessing fictional worlds. Chapter 3, “VR Telework and the Privatization of Presence,” focuses on Japanese projects using VR to drive telepresence robots for rehabilitation—first as a way to take care of the country’s aging population and more recently as a way to bring the elderly, persons with disabilities, and foreign overseas workers back into the workforce to do VR-enabled physical labor. I position these approaches to VR labor alongside Facebook’s larger project to build VR into an embodied social infrastructure capable of replacing the need for physical transit and in-person communication. The chapter shows how these promises of greater worker mobility, in practice, tend to fix these already precarious workers ever more firmly in place. Shifting to a popular culture context, chapter 4, “Immersive Anxieties in the VR Isekai,” turns to fictional Japanese VR narratives to analyze desires and fears surrounding the possibility of complete enclosure in headset-based fantasy worlds. I focus on the spectacular popularity of isekai (“other world”) VR fantasy narratives where characters become trapped in a headset and must conquer the virtual world in order to get out alive. While isekai stories are often written off as a form of low-brow escapism, I draw on Japanese media theory to examine how the convergence of VR\n\n18 INTRO D U CTIO N\n\nand the isekai fantasy allows for a colonialist reimagining of the other world as a virtual alternative to existing Japanese social contexts. The final chapter, “VR as a Technology of Masculinity,” examines VR as a highly gendered space emerging from what has historically been a male-dominated field. Building off early feminist VR criticism as well as more recent Japanese debates over the gendering of virtual characters, I show how VR in Japan often serves as a technology of masculinity promising control over both virtual environments and virtual teenage girls. I examine how the gendering of VR is never simply about what appears within the virtual world, but also about who assumes the first-person perspective, who controls the perceptual space, and how all this intersects with the broader social environments surrounding VR use. With this book I hope to push media studies to focus more on the perceptual politics of immersive media platforms. As the Japanese context helpfully makes clear, VR offers a powerful ambient means to manipulate humans’ everyday social and spatial situatedness. If the rapidly expanding VR industry is to lead somewhere other than the further consolidation of algorithmic control over everyday interactions, a crucial first step is to understand the simultaneously social and spatial power dynamics that have shaped the VR enclosure thus far.\n\n1 ACOUSTICS OF THE ONE-PERSON SPACE\n\nW\n\nhile head-mounted visual media like the stereoscope are most frequently mentioned as predecessors of the virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display, head-mounted audio technologies like headphones offer a more direct precursor. As the digital media scholars Steven Jones and Frances Dyson noted during the first VR boom, popular virtual reality discourse often emphasizes the visual, but much of the 360-degree immersion promised by VR was first achieved in sound.1 These sonic precedents for virtual immersion were not lost on some of the central players in VR history. Novelist William Gibson’s notion of “cyberspace” was inspired in part by his experiences with the Sony Walkman.2 Inventor Jaron Lanier came to VR after a career in music and introduced his company VPL Research’s pioneering “Eye-phone” headmounted displays as “the visual equivalent of audio headphones.”3 In more recent years John Carmack, until recently the most prominent engineer of the contemporary VR scene as chief technology officer at Oculus, continues to describe the VR head-mounted display as “headphones for your eyes.”4 Long before the era of consumer VR, audio engineers aimed to produce the “illusion of reality” and the experience of “really being there.”5 But the path to the cultural acceptance of headphone use would be a rocky one. This chapter traces the tumultuous history of spatial audio\n\n2 0 ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nand headphone listening to demonstrate how head-mounted virtual space first achieved cultural acceptance in the acoustic realm. The history of headphone listening and spatial audio reveals a shift in cultural attitudes toward media interfaces that fix the head in place and block out the broader environment. It was only with the turn toward personal listening enclosures that the head-mounted interface began to achieve more mainstream traction as a consumer product. The gradual cultural acceptance of head-mounted audio set the stage for the VR headsets to come. As with immersive visuals, the history of immersive audio can be understood as a series of attempts to replace a user’s immediate perceptual environment with more malleable media alternatives. By the early twentieth century “good sound” came to be associated with dry or spaceless sound that could be tailored more precisely to the listening situation. Much like mid-twentieth-century cinemas would seek to create an “optical vacuum” where no other visuals would distract from the screen, modern listening aimed to deliver sound stripped of its local spatiality that could thus be deliverable to audiences in forms more flexible, mobile, and self-contained.6 This development in turn led music producers to deploy the now-malleable spatial signature of a sound recording (such as its reverb and echo) as an expressive material.7 A single pop song began to mix many different acoustic spaces. For example, a vocal track may sound like it is recorded up close, while the guitar accompaniment is drenched in reverb and thus sounds more distant. From an early twentieth-century perspective, this kind of bricolage might be expected to result in a perceptually fragmented experience, a sense of discombobulation on hearing so many different acoustic spaces layered together. Yet contemporary listeners are not the least bit confused.8 Sound scholar Jonathan Sterne explains this development through reference to what he calls speaker culture, or how contemporary listeners are accustomed to hearing the embedded space of musical recordings come out of different kinds of speakers and blend with the acoustics of the immediate listening environment. He notes that if we define augmented reality (AR) as virtual spaces layered on top of existing ones, this speaker-based layering of audio spaces has produced augmented realities for a long time now. Sterne uses this observation to caution against claims\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE21\n\nthat AR marks a radical break with prior media forms because humans immersed in speaker culture appear to have adjusted to a world of layered virtual spaces just fine.9 Yet by focusing on the “overlay of physical and mediatic space” as his archetypal case for an encounter with recorded sound, Sterne’s analysis stops just short of engaging with the more profound spatial reconfiguration that occurs when an audio interface bypasses the local space entirely, as with headphones that place speakers directly against the listener’s ears. Even as the plastic reverb of modern audio production enabled sound that was “outside space” and thus “brackets its own historicity and situatedness,” the overlayed sonic space of room-scale speaker setups was still shaped in the final instance by the acoustics of the immediate listening environment.10 An air gap remained between listener and speaker so that the acoustics of the surrounding physical space conditioned any sound that passed through it. While Sterne proposes contemporary listeners have simply become adept at listening to a mix of overlayed spaces, research on head-mounted spatial audio suggests that the acoustic mediation of the immediate physical location provides a crucial element of integration, grounding the various sonic layers through the more invariant acoustics of the built environment. No matter how complex and layered the virtual space on a recording may be, the sounds reach the ears sutured together into a “coherent sonic text” by the reassuringly familiar spatial signature of the local listening space.11 Headphone use, in contrast, bypasses the filter of the local environment. Like the later head-mounted interfaces of VR, headphones produce virtual acoustic spaces that perceptually seem to wrap around the perceiver’s body but in fact only coalesce within the perceiver’s head. By isolating left and right ears, headphones can reproduce a three-dimensional virtual space without the need to pass the sound through an existing physical location. Sterne locates what he calls the “detachable echo”—the variable relationship between any given sound and its spatial signature—as a phenomenon of the recording studio. Binaural audio over headphones, however, enable the detachment—the virtualization—of even the spatiality of the local listening environment. This chapter explores the emergence of this new space of listening, or what I will identify as the arrival of detachable ambience.\n\n2 2ACO U STIC S O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nSound and media scholars have long emphasized how headphone listening creates a more private and enclosed auditory space. Judith Williamson noted already in 1986 how the Walkman “turns the inside of the head into a mobile home.”12 In his mid-2000s study of iPod listeners, Michael Bull described how Apple headphones allowed listeners to become “enclosed” in “pleasurable and privatized sound bubbles,” while the white cables signaled a desire to be left alone.13 More recently, Mack Hagood has examined how Bose’s noise-canceling headphones allow users “to construct an on/off interface with the aural environment and the space one shares with others.”14 While they differ in whether to understand this privatization as empowering or alienating, these studies each situate headphone listening as part of a broader trajectory toward privatized media consumption, one that promises individual control over a personalized sound environment. Often inspired by Henri Lefebvre’s approach in Rhythmanalysis, much of this work focuses on how the use of headphones promises listeners the ability to transform their emotional or energetic states via the rhythmic resources of portable, private music. Despite frequent references to urban space, however, these studies situate the social interface with sound recordings as primarily temporal: musically organized time intersects, intensifies, or flattens out the broader rhythms of contemporary capitalism. For example, cultural studies scholar Iain Chambers describes the Walkman as part of a transformation of the city from an “organizer of space” to a technological realm focused on the “organization of time.”15 With a few notable exceptions, sound studies scholarship is nearly silent on the spatiality of headphone sound and only rarely attends to the acoustics of physical spaces where headphone listening occurs. Approaches to headphone culture have remained, until now, essentially monophonic, neglecting to consider the role of stereo sound spatialization in the history of headphone listening.16 This spatially flattened approach has led sound and media scholars to overlook the historical importance of debates over stereo and binaural recording in the history of headphone use and in immersive media more broadly. In this chapter, I attempt to rectify this by listening simultaneously to the history of virtual sonic space produced through headphones and the broader acoustic environments in which headphone listening takes place. At issue here is the precise way these two spaces become composited\n\nACO U STIC S O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE23\n\nwithin the listener’s head. Finally, I turn to the transformation in social attitudes toward headphone listening following the market success of the Walkman to find clues about how the head-mounted media interface began to go mainstream. Thanks to VR and AR, three-dimensional spatial audio has once again become a central focus for new headphone technologies.17 At the same time, the current cultural reception of VR and AR headsets was preceded and shaped by long-running debates over the cultural politics of headphone use. At first, these debates largely played out in the pages of audio engineer and audiophile publications in countries like the United States, Germany, and Japan, only to spill over into more mainstream cultural contexts as headphone listening became popular globally in the postWalkman era. While I draw on scholarship focused on the United States and Germany in what follows, I emphasize Japan’s crucial but often neglected role in spatial audio history. The European and North American studies mentioned above often frame their work within a specifically Western trajectory, yet the Japanese discourse reveals a great deal of transnational continuity (even as specific developments occurred at slightly different times in each place).18 While hard to imagine today, headphone use was frequently stigmatized throughout much of the twentieth century. Like the early consumer VR headsets, headphones were associated with spatial disorientation, physical discomfort, and feelings of isolation, while their public image was shaped by broader discourses around gender and disability. I propose that it was only once the built environments of everyday life also became organized around a virtual acoustics that the headphone stigma began to fall away.\n\nA HISTORY OF HEA DPHO N E ST I G MA\n\nFrom their invention in 1881, headphones were quickly understood to transport a person elsewhere, removing listeners from their immediate sensory environment. Headphones were used initially as specialist equipment in telecommunications contexts.19 Early switchboard operators at Bell Telephone Company, for example, used a workplace model complete with shoulder supports to help prop up the over six-pound headset across long shifts.\n\n24 ACO U STIC S O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nTelephone service was the primary context for headphone use in Japan as well through the early twentieth century, for example, in scenes with Murai Ayako wearing headphones while at work as a switchboard operator in Mizoguchi Kenji’s Osaka Elegy (Naniwa erejī, 1936).20 Like phone booths more generally, the switchboard operators’ headphones (and the larger enclosure of the operator’s booth) served to isolate them from their immediate surroundings. As Sterne writes of this early headphone context, “not only was hearing to be separated from the proximal auditory environment, but the act of communication itself was to be separated from the surrounding physical environment.”21 In one alternate history of cinematic immersion, audiences could have been listening to Mizoguchi’s film on headphones as well. In the early days of Hollywood’s conversion to sound film in the 1920s and 1930s, engineers at Bell Telephone Labs developed a sound system for cinema halls built around binaural audio provided through headphones, what media scholar Steve J. Wurtzler calls the “logical outcome of developing sound technology on the model of the human body.”22 Bell Labs is where the idea to position microphones on artificial dummy heads to capture “auditory perspective” more accurately first emerged. Rather than strip away the acoustic detail of the original recording space, this binaural method aimed to capture it more accurately by including a model of the would-be listener’s head for incoming sounds to reflect against. The dummy head technique attaches two monaural microphones to each side of a mannequin (usually just a head or head and upper torso) built to the dimensions of an “average” human body. Microphones at the time were too large to be situated within the dummy’s ears, so Oscar—Bell Labs’ name for their dummy—had microphones on his cheeks instead.23 When recordings made in this way are played back over headphones placed on the listener’s own head (in approximately the same position as Oscar’s original microphones), the listener’s brain registers the subtle ambient distortions produced by the dummy head as if they were produced by their own body instead. This enabled an enhanced sense of where recorded sounds are situated spatially in relation to a listener’s body. Researchers at Philips Research in Eindhoven, who developed a similar artificial head (what they called a Kunstkopf) recording technique by the end of the 1930s, noted that sounds recorded in such a manner were “so real that listeners had to turn their heads to reassure themselves that nobody was standing behind.”24\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE25\n\nYet when Bell Labs presented binaural headphone listening to movie theaters as a means to achieve better sound localization in films, the idea was quickly rejected in favor of more standard loudspeaker systems. While partly due to the cost of equipping each cinema seat with its own pair of headphones, theater owners were also skeptical that audiences would be willing to isolate themselves perceptually in this way. As Wurtzler writes in his history of the era, Such a binaural acoustic system would have posed a drastic contrast to preexisting theatrical filmgoing experiences. Would audiences watch and listen to a live theatrical presentation and then at some cue from the theater reach beneath their seats and put on their telephone headsets? Would they sing along, following an on-screen bouncing ball, aurally isolated by their personal acoustic reproduction device, not even able to hear the sound of their own voice? And what of the construction of the cinema as a live, group-based social experience?25\n\nHeadphones would ultimately find a home in the cinema hall but only for one specific demographic: the hearing impaired. The subsequent longterm association between disability and headphones would underwrite, in part, a social stigma associated with headphone use that continued all the way until the 1970s. The isolation of headphone listening was figured as an option of last resort, reserved for the minority of audience members with hearing impairments. The privileged immediacy of not needing headphones in the theater became the default position, masking how the movie theater itself was already built with these normative hearing bodies in mind. Headphones for use with home record players were also offered in the 1920s and 1930s, but they raised similar concerns about their isolating influence on the domestic scene. This silencing was particularly acute for those not in direct control of media technologies in the home. The editors of the Living Stereo anthology note how headphones in the United States at this time were often perceived “to silence conversation in the home and exclude others from the radio experience,” even giving rise to gendered figures like the “wireless widow.” One 1924 letter to the editor of Radio Broadcast describes the writer’s struggle on being forced to “sit mum” while her husband was occupied by his headphones, “consoling herself with a book, or solitaire, having at least the chill comfort of his physical presence, though his soul go marching on.”26\n\n2 6ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nThe overwhelmingly male-gendered space of both sound engineering and home audio intersected and in some ways muffled how the headphone stigma played out in the domestic context. In the private sphere, headphone listeners were also usually the head of the household and tried (not always successfully, judging by the audio magazine commentary) to bend domestic space to their will and to their hobby. One response to this domestic tension was to offset the isolation through equipment for simultaneous group headphone use. Home listening in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century offered accessories for multiple family members to listen “alone together” to the same recording simultaneously through separate headphones.27 Yet much like group headphone use in the theater, it never really caught on. When binaural reemerged in the postwar 1950s, it was a loudspeakerdriven phenomenon. Emory Cook, an audio engineer from New Jersey, kicked off the new binaural boom in 1952 with his invention of a two-channel stereo record system. Rather than print a two-channel signal in a single groove (technologically impossible at the time), Cook’s system used a special two-pronged record arm to pick up sounds simultaneously from two grooves at once. Echoing the contemporaneous three-dimensional film boom, he promoted his new system widely as an innovation in “three-dimensional sound” and presented his own field recordings of passing trains and other mobile sound sources in ways that emphasized spatial depth. A series of public events in Japan this same year introduced the Japanese public to binaural speaker broadcasts based on Cook’s system. These included a three-dimensional sound broadcast via speakers on multiple buses set up in Hibiya Park in Tokyo, as well as indoor demonstrations at the International Radio Center. In late 1953, national broadcaster NHK launched a special binaural radio broadcast once a month where the left binaural channel was broadcast on one frequency and the right channel on another. This system had the advantage of remaining accessible to owners of only one radio (who could listen in mono) while also promoting the purchase (or at least the borrowing) of a second radio set to enable the full binaural experience.28 The broadcasts were a popular success. Cook’s binaural records were also available as imports for purchase, but they were expensive for average Japanese consumers at the time (priced around 3,000 yen or $89 USD in 1955 prices). As Shin denki (New electronics) magazine complained at the time, it was still far cheaper to simply go to a live concert if you wanted to experience three-dimensional sound.29\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE27\n\nMeanwhile, proponents of listening to binaural recordings on headphones in the United States and Japan in the 1950s continued to face the stigma attached to headphone use. Audio engineers like Cook acknowledged the superior “fidelity” and “realism” of binaural headphone listening, but they argued that the available “earphones” were “both uncomfortable and anti-social.” Promoting three-dimensional sound through loudspeakers instead, Cook believed, could turn binaural “from a tinkerer’s hobby into a potentially popular medium.”30 Through the mid-1970s, headphones remained limited to either bulky high-end headsets for audiophiles or simple monaural earbuds with poor sound quality. A July 1976 article in Rajio gijutsu (Radio technology) magazine notes that headphones capable of better-quality sound reproduction tended to be heavy, meaning they were difficult to use for long periods, and could even make a listener sweat in summer. Smaller earbud-type headphones could not achieve good enough audio quality for music listening.31 As with cinema headphones, the latter were, by this point, popularly associated primarily with hearing aids, adding another dimension to the ableist headphone stigma.32\n\nD EBATES OVER HEA DPHO N E SOUN D\n\nResearchers and audiophiles in Japan and West Germany were reluctant to give up on headphone listening entirely, however. Japanese hi-fi enthusiast magazines in the 1950s and 1960s featured numerous articles breaking down the relative merits of mono, stereo, and binaural recordings, as well as speaker versus headphone playback. Writing in 1955, sound researcher Iguchi Seiji called binaural recording a “revolution in the audio world,” but he noted many technical issues remained to be solved. While the engineers’ aspiration was still toward better sound reproduction for music playback, binaural researchers were clear that three-dimensional binaural spatialization lent itself best to radio dramas and sound effects (like the steam trains and ping pong sounds on Cook’s records).33 The Sutereo haifai seisaku dokuhon (Guidebook to building a stereo hi-fi), released amid the Japanese consumer hi-fi boom of 1962, sets out to illustrate the different effects of monaural, stereo, and binaural audio for Japanese home listeners. As depicted in figure 1.1, the authors note how a single-channel\n\n2 8ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Illustration from Guidebook to Building a Stereo Hi-Fi showing the perceptual difference in sound localization between (1, left) monaural, (2, center) stereo, and (3, right) binaural recording and playback. Sutereo haifai seisaku dokuhon (1962), 14.\n\nmonaural recording creates a sound stage where the listener perceives all the sounds to be clumped together in one spot. Recording in stereo with two microphones at least 1 to 3 meters apart creates a two-dimensional sound field; thus, the different performers sound as if they were arranged in a line between the two speakers. In contrast, binaural recording uses two microphones placed only 20 to 30 centimeters apart (based on an inter-ear distance of twenty-three centimeters for the average human). A recording produced in this way and listened to on headphones creates a more intimate threedimensional sound stage in close proximity to the listener’s head.34 While the text doesn’t mention it, the Guidebook to Building a Stereo Hi-Fi illustrator switches from the all-male quartets portrayed in the first two panels to a female vocal trio for the binaural illustration. For the implied male listener (seen in rear profile here), the greater intimacy of binaural sound appears to bring with it a different set of gender expectations. Historian Stefan Krebs notes how the primarily male recordists, trade journalists, and radio professionals in the 1970s recording world readily assumed that a male head would “represent an average listener.”35 But notice the shift in representational strategies when binaural moves the soundstage up close. Rather than pull other men inside the male listener’s head, the premise shifts to a promise of close physical proximity with (virtual) women. This gendering is further reflected in the preponderance of female voices and vocalists on binaural demonstration records from the 1950s through the 1970s. For example, Teichiku’s Invitation to Binaural Sounds (figure 1.2), released in coordination with Matsushita in\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE29\n\nFIGURE 1.2 Cover and advertisement sleeve of Teichiku’s vinyl record Invitation to Binaural Sounds (Bainōraru e no shōtai, 1976). The white text just above the track list in the lower right says, “Please listen on headphones. The sense of perspective, movement, and presence are outstanding.”\n\n1976 as part of the research developments detailed below, includes “narration” by voice actress Suzuki Hiroko and ends with her “Love Talk” (ai no katarai) whispered into the listener’s ears.36 In Japan, as elsewhere, control over home-listening technology has long been primarily a male domain (as evidenced by the wireless widows of decades past), even as the gendering of binaural performance skews heavily female.37 The switch to an ostensibly less threatening gender (for the implied male listener of the time) attempts to short-circuit what otherwise might be felt as an uncomfortable degree of homosocial intimacy and immediacy manifested in binaural listening—perhaps even a challenge to the spatial authority of the male home listener. As prices dropped and incomes rose, stereo record players for home use became a key part of the Japanese leisure boom of the early 1960s.38\n\n3 0 ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nHeadphones (heddo-hon or heddo-fon, also called earphones/iyāfon) for consumer use emerged as part of the boom, particularly for use with transistor radios, but they were again not without their detractors. Writing in Rekōdo geijutsu (Record art) magazine in 1961, audio technology reporter Wakabayashi Shunsuke differentiates the virtual acoustics of headphone listening for his readers like this: In the case of listening to stereo sounds through earphones, sounds go directly into the ears. There is no mediation. In contrast, when listening to stereo recordings on speakers, sounds pass through the medium of air before reaching the ears. Because sounds coming from speakers pass briefly through the room before arriving at the ears, the sound includes reverberation off the surrounding walls. Depending on the power, sounds from the left speaker may also be audible to the right ear. Compared with sound passing through space like this, with headphone use sounds instead reverberate directly from the outer ear into the eardrum. There is a big difference in sound.39\n\nFor Wakabayashi, speaker listening includes the interference of the reflective surfaces of the listening space (walls, floor, and windows, for example), giving stereo sound its “unique feeling of presence” (sutereo dokutoku no rinjōkan). He details this in an accompanying diagram (figure 1.3) that envisions sounds ricocheting off walls and floor on their way to the listener. As I noted above, headphone listening in contrast effectively bypasses the local acoustics of the listening space by collapsing the distance between ears and speakers, isolating the sound coming into each ear. Wakabayashi cautions that if recordings designed for stereo speakers are listened to with headphones, some unfortunate effects occur. For example, if someone listens to a standard stereo recording of an orchestra over speakers, they are acoustically positioned as if they were in the concert hall audience. If a person listens to the same recording over headphones, however, the “sound image” suddenly comes much closer, placing the listener right in the middle of the orchestra pit. For sound recordings produced with speaker playback in mind, headphones tend to give the impression that the sounds are simply moving around inside the listener’s head.40 For this reason, Wakabayashi notes, headphone listening is “not well suited to real music appreciation.” Many\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE31\n\nFIGURE 1.3 Illustration from Wakabayashi, “Iyāfon!?” (1961). The original Japanese cap-\n\ntion reads: “Sounds coming out of the speaker reflect off walls, the floor, and other places before reaching the ears.”\n\nrecord producers at the time strongly advised against using headphones to listen to their recordings. Wakabayashi’s article concludes that speaker listening generally provides a better experience, particularly in the case of music. Echoing Iguchi’s earlier comments from the 1950s, Wakabayashi argues that headphone listening is the best choice only for the binaural reproduction of “real sounds” (genjitsu-on) like steam trains and jet engines or for the more accurate localization of discreet sound sources like opera soloists or actors in a radio drama. Wakabayashi’s article ends with a shift away from these concerns with pure audio fidelity, however, pivoting to a separate set of issues that would\n\n3 2ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nprove decisive for headphone use in subsequent decades. Here he admits the real appeal of headphone listening may lie elsewhere: Despite all this, when thinking about the current situation in Japan, it’s true most ordinary Japanese rooms are not very large, and moreover insulation between neighboring rooms is bad, so it is easy to hear sounds from next door. From this perspective, we can say that earphones offer a really easy way to listen to stereo recordings. It’s difficult to overlook the appeal of being able to enjoy recordings on your own, without bothering other people.41\n\nWakabayashi explicitly warns readers that, from a fidelity perspective, listening to stereo recordings on headphones raises the “extremely dangerous” (kiwamete kiken na) possibility of producing a poor balance between the different instruments. He suggests listeners compare for themselves by using the same recording for both speaker and headphone playback. Yet he admits “late night stereo listening on headphones by yourself can also be fun.”42 The appeal of headphones here is ultimately less about sound quality and more about the provision of a solitary media space. Electronics historian Heike Weber notes a similar emphasis on “listening without bothering anyone” in West German headphone advertisements from the time. As in Japan, this was in part due to the poor sound insulation in German homes.43 As Wakabayashi’s comments reveal, by the 1960s, headphones’ ability to provide a more private listening enclosure began to register not as a liability but as a primary part of their appeal. The 1960s was also the decade when headphone use for film audiences finally found popular acceptance, albeit only in a very specific context: the in-flight movie. In the airplane cabin, the alienating potential of headphones was transformed into an asset for the solo traveler. The headphone enclosure offered a perceptual escape not just from plane noise but from the discomforts of the newest air travel innovation: the reduction in personal space known as economy class seating. In-flight headphones enabled what media scholar Stephen Groening calls the “separated spectator” in the skies.44 Even as passengers were seated ever closer together, the virtual space provided by the headphones ensured they were perceptually apart. As Wakabayashi’s article hints, headphone use at home was in the midst of a similar, if more staggered transformation. Headphone listening\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE33\n\noffered a chance to bypass home acoustics by piping the virtual space of a recording directly into a listener’s ears. But the sound perspective issues persisted. If recordings were designed for speakers and thus recorded with microphones placed several meters apart, this larger sound stage would effectively be compressed into the smaller space between a listener’s ears when played back on headphones. This resulted in what came to be known around this time as the sound-in-the-head problem. For example, a stereo recording of piano music heard over headphones would sound as if you had placed your head directly inside the performer’s instrument (figure 1.4).\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Illustration\n\nfrom Rajio gijutsu (Radio technology) magazine (July 1976) showing the problem with listening to stereo recordings on regular headphones.

Attempts to solve the sound-in-the-head problem would drive an increasing separation between binaural and stereo recordings in the decades to follow. While Cook’s binaural records were intended for speakers and recorded with a pair of microphones placed several meters apart, the new binaural recording practices instead took a cue from Bell Labs’ earlier dummy-head approach: spacing the microphones roughly the width of a human head. A breakthrough came in 1972, with an updated artificial head microphone (Kunstkopf) designed by Berlin-based researchers Georg Plenge, Ralf Kürer, and Henning Wilkens. Microphones could be made small enough by this point to place them inside the ear canals of an artificial head, making it possible to capture the auditory perspective provided by the outer ears as well.45 This new form of binaural was first introduced to the West German public at Berlin’s International Broadcasting Fair in September 1973, followed by the broadcast of the first German binaural radio drama. This kicked off a small boom in binaural headphone listening in West Germany that lasted through the end of the decade, at which point most home audio equipment would include headphone jacks as a standard feature.46 As Krebs notes, while many daily newspapers in West Germany were enthusiastic about the new three-dimensional sound, and binaural was popular with listeners, the audio engineer trade journals were less enthusiastic. As with the Japanese engineers, a range of technical and infrastructural compatibility concerns emerged, such as how binaural recordings were effective in locating sounds on a left-right horizontal axis but had much more difficulty positioning sounds in front of or behind the listener.47 Krebs notes headphones at the time were still “associated with the early years of radio broadcasting, and thus their use was perceived as a step backwards in technical terms.” The necessity of listening to binaural broadcasts over headphones remained a sticking point. As one trade author asks rhetorically in 1973, “who is willing to submit themselves to these restrictions?”48 Unable to secure larger institutional support, the 1970s West German binaural boom faded by the end of the decade.\n\nACOUSTICS OF THE ONE-PERSON SPACE35\n\nIn a striking parallel with the earlier Japanese sound magazine discourse, binaural headphone experiences even led some German audio experts to question the implicit assumption that greater three-dimensional access to “objective reality” would inherently lead to better or more satisfying listener experiences. For example, Peter Reinecke, director of the Berlin Institute of Musicology, declared at a 1969 conference the “need to question the ideological position of ‘high fidelity’ ” because “music is not sound.”49 This is precisely where the long-standing binaural principle of fidelity to the original recording space bumped up against the parallel trajectory I described above, where audio engineers sought to detach recorded sound from any existing physical space. Krebs quotes Wilhelm Schlemm of Radio Free Berlin in 1974, who notes how more and more popular music was now recorded in acoustically “dry” studios, creating a “roomless” effect. At odds with this trend, “Kunstkopf stereophony has come at an untimely moment, leading to the following paradox: previously the history of electro-acoustical transmission was always driven by the desire for highest fidelity . . . now, just as the aim of perfect illusion can be achieved, it is no longer valued and desired.”50 To complicate the situation further, as Krebs notes, the idea of perfect binaural fidelity to the original performance space also seemed to threaten the role of the audio engineers themselves, who, in the new era of postproduction spatial control, had come to see their work as an active and integral part of the larger creative process of crafting musical recordings. While the quest for increased fidelity and realism had long led audio engineering rhetoric, in practice the space of recorded sound had already moved far away from the original recording environment, to be placed under the control of both studio engineers and home listeners instead. Having grown accustomed to controlling the acoustics virtually, both parties were not about to sacrifice this flexibility in deference to the fixed “realism” of the original recording space. Debates over headphone listening would similarly captivate Japanese audio hobbyists in the mid-1970s. Audio journalist Yamamoto Shūhei observes in a 1975 article for Radio Technology that headphone listening had finally emerged as a “quiet boom” (shizuka na būmu) among audio enthusiasts, yet the sound-in-the-head problem, the weight and discomfort of high-quality headphones, and the market dominance of stereo recordings intended for speaker playback all remained as obstacles.\n\n3 6 ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nJapanese audio engineers threw themselves at these problems in the years to follow, hoping to create an acoustic architecture that could retain the privacy and convenience of headphone use while “more naturally incorporating the atmosphere of the surrounding room.”51 Early experiments included a head-mounted speaker system designed to project a stereo recording to sound as if it were emerging from directly in front of the listener—a kind of audio-only head-mounted display (figure 1.5).\n\nFIGURE 1.5 Caption:\n\n“Headphones that can position sound in front of the head.” Excerpted from Okahara Masaru, “Saikin no bainōraru,” Hōsō gijutsu (January 1977): 112.\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE37\n\nDETACHA BL E A MBIEN C E\n\nFurther developments along this line came from the Acoustic Research Laboratory at Matsushita, which came up with a different approach to what they called “outer head localization.”52 This research ultimately resulted in a consumer product released in 1977 on their Technics label: the Ambience Phone (anbiensu-hon). Explicitly marketed as a solution to the sound-in-the-head problem, the Ambience Phone used a four-channel audio processor to mix additional artificial echo and reverb into any stereo recording sent through the device. Instead of squeezing a stereo recording into the space between the ears, it would sound instead like it was coming from a pair of (virtual) speakers situated somewhere across the room.53 The Ambience Phone component box has just three controls: an on/off button, a button to turn the ambience function on and off, and a dial for the user to set the desired amount of ambience to add to the original signal (figure 1.6). By shifting the choice of sound placement from the producer to the consumer, the device sought to present a workaround to the distribution and infrastructure issues binaural recordings had repeatedly faced. The Ambience Phone approximated the acoustics of room-scale speaker playback within an individual, head-mounted space. Moving beyond the detachable echo of the recording studio, the Ambience Phone aimed to place an entire detachable ambience under the control of home listeners. Via the on-board “ambient controller,” every listener was in effect put in charge of their own virtual dummy head. The push of a button would bring the virtual dummy head to life, and the turn of a dial would move the dummy’s auditory perspective forward and back in virtual space. The Ambience Phone was just one of a wide range of private acoustic enclosures to emerge globally around this time. One year later, Amar Bose would come up with the idea for noise-canceling headphones while commuting by plane.54 That same year Brian Eno coined the term ambient music to describe a genre that aimed to provide self-selected emotional environments for private listeners, often by means of cavernous reverbdriven spaces within the recordings themselves.55 And in 1979, Sony released the Walkman, a device that didn’t solve the sound-in-the-head problem directly but effectively displaced it by introducing new possibilities for mobile headphone use.\n\nFIGURE 1.6 Cover\n\nof the owner’s manual for the Technics Ambience Phone (1977).\n\nACOUSTICS OF THE ONE-PERSON SPACE39\n\nHeadphone histories generally point to the Walkman’s combination of lightweight, over-the-ear headphones with a portable cassette stereo as the moment when headphone use finally goes mainstream.56 Yet this precise combination of features was far from a foregone conclusion. Independent research groups at Sony had been working separately on lightweight headphones and portable cassette players. The cassette player group had originally planned to release the device with a pair of much larger, heavier headphones on the assumption that sound quality would be the most important criterion for their customers. It was already late in the development process when Sony cofounder Ibuka Masaru recommended the two products be combined.57 The lightweight, foam-covered headphones that were eventually used employed a patent Sony had licensed from Sennheiser but miniaturized the design even further.58 Ibuka was prescient to realize that, for most consumers, better fidelity was no match for convenience and comfort.59 The second unexpected development for the Walkman occurred after the device was released to the public. Sony president Morita Akio had initially believed, based on his wife’s input, that using the device alone in public would be considered rude. For this reason, a second headphone jack was included with the first release, much like the multi-headphone setups of home record players in the 1920s and 1930s. Early Walkman ads emphasized how the device could be shared, for example, by a “very tall American woman and an old Japanese gentleman,” or two lovers on a tandem bike.60 While later Walkman studies often present this as a historical curiosity, Morita’s wife’s concern was grounded in decades of stigma against the isolation of solitary headphone use. After the Walkman was put on the market, however, it became clear listeners were using the device primarily to listen alone. As Morita later wrote, “buyers began to see their little portable stereo sets as very personal.”61 Musicologist Shūhei Hosokawa later dramatized this isolation in his widely read 1984 essay on the Walkman: “The listener seems to cut the auditory contact with the outer world where he really lives: seeking the perfection of his ‘individual’ zone of listening.”62 To Sony’s surprise, listeners began to treat the Walkman as a private extension of their own sound environment and to enjoy the freedom it provided to ignore—or at least remediate—the surrounding perceptual world. Walkman users too were subject to the headphone stigma early\n\n4 0 ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\non, often envisioned as rude young people purposefully refusing to attend to the larger social atmosphere.63 Following the device’s release, however, the social acceptance of public headphone use in Japan steadily increased. Weber notes a similar trend in the early Walkman reception in West Germany, as does personal stereo scholar Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow in the United States.64 The Walkman also allowed the isolation offered by headphone listening to be more accessible across gender lines, as African American studies and technology theorist Alexander Weheliye notes in his reading of the device as an “autonomous sonic space” for women who may otherwise have difficulty gaining control over space either at work or at home.65 As noted above, scholarship on the Walkman has often focused on how the listener’s newfound mobility allowed private music to intersect with and reconfigure the embodied experience of movement through a city. What has yet to be recognized is how the Walkman normalized the practice of strapping stereo recordings directly to the head. By repositioning music listening back into the surrounding environment, both the Ambience Phone and the Walkman sought to offset the perceptual isolation of headphone use. The former used audio signal processing to fabricate a virtual space directly within the device, while the latter relied on live, on-location sound to surround the mobile listener and blend with the stereo recording, distracting them from the sound-in-the-head effect. The Ambience Phone and the Walkman offered a sonic prelude to virtual reality and augmented reality, respectively (minus the movement-tracking sensors that would only arrive a decade later).\n\nT H E EM ERGENCE OF THE ONE -P ERSON SPAC E\n\nJust as new sound technologies were making ambient control more accessible to the individual listener, the built environment itself was becoming more oriented toward privately mediated sound. Wakabayashi, remember, noted in the early 1960s that home headphone use was fun in part because it allowed for late-night listening where speaker playback would otherwise be bothersome (meiwaku) for neighbors and family members in adjoining rooms. Record numbers of Japanese relocated to urban environments at this time, often to live in wooden housing with notoriously\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE41\n\nthin walls and in close proximity to neighboring homes. While these noise concerns were not exactly a novel phenomenon—the problem of noisy neighbors was even the central conceit of Japan’s first sound film, The Neighbor’s Wife and Mine (Madamu to nyōbō, Gosho Heinosuke, 1931)—these porous urban acoustics clearly impinged upon the promised freedoms of the 1960s leisure boom, among them the ability to make full use of your home hi-fi as you saw fit. As Sterne traces in The Audible Past, from the early days of sound reproduction technologies, emergent middle classes have often sought to claim individual acoustic spaces as a form of private property.66 For the rapidly expanding middle class of high-growth Japan, this first meant a shift to American-style, one-room-per-child family homes, an unheard-of level of personal space for most Japanese kids at the time.67 Weber notes a similar trend in 1970s West Germany, where domestic media consumption would similarly become increasingly atomized, more about the pursuit of individual media spaces than collective family-oriented consumption. Headphone advertisements shifted in parallel to promote an ideal of isolated, concentrated listening, even associating it with relaxation and meditation practice.68 This trend was later taken to its logical extreme with the rise of concrete apartment blocks of one-room studios, or what in Japanese is called the wan rūmu manshon (“one-room mansion”). As urban studies scholar Nango Yoshikazu describes in Hitori kūkan no toshiron (Urban theory of the one-person space), when these single-occupant dwellings first emerged in the mid-1970s, they were initially intended as weekday places to sleep for urban workers who would return to their families in the suburbs on weekends. But they soon began to cater to the rising number of one-person households ready to give up a larger home to secure a space all their own in the city. The one-room mansion was advertised as a pathway to what in Japanese is known as mai pēsu (“my pace”)—a life lived in your own way and at your own speed, even if it must take place within rather tight quarters.69 A crucial element enabling this personal isolation was the one-room mansion’s extremely effective sound insulation, which made it almost impossible to hear what was going on in the unit next door.70 As Nango notes, while these micro-apartments were derided as rabbit hutches by the American and European press, much like the Walkman, they ended up attracting an unexpectedly wide range of ages, income\n\n4 2ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nlevels, and occupations. Rather than bemoan the small space, Japanese media coverage at the time recognized the distinct appeal of the oneroom lifestyle. Photobooks like Tsuzuki Kyōichi’s Tokyo Style (1993) presented the one-room mansion as a kind of “cockpit” (kokkupitto) for the solo dweller: occupants could lie in bed and still have everything necessary to control their media environment within easy reach.71 During the one-room mansion’s heyday, from 1975 to 1985, this personalized cockpit might have been furnished with a television, a stereo, and perhaps later in the decade a video cassette deck or video game console.72 As the oneroom mansion demonstrates, the arrival of “electronic individualism” was as much architectural as it was mediated.73 Media scholar Thomas Lamarre notes how, around this time in Japan, the private television set began to serve as a pivot for “switching between media functions” so that “the personal bedroom begins to look like a broadcast-relay station.”74 While Lamarre’s analysis captures the infrastructural side of this emergent personal media cockpit, the history I’ve presented here points to the three-dimensional virtualization of ambient perception that manifested in tandem with the establishment of these new media networks. The detachable ambience of the one-person space reimagined perception along the lines of a VR flight simulator, blocking out the perceptual determinants of the physical environment to allow for greater immersion into virtual realms. The arrival of the one-room mansion’s acoustically sealed yet perceptually expansive media enclosure can be understood as a further step in the mainstreaming of the individual ambient space initially sought out through headphone use.\n\nA HEA D-TRACKED ACOU ST I C S\n\nEven as urban architecture shifted to accommodate the one-person space, audio engineers continued to try and find ways to use virtual acoustics to transcend the immediate physical environment. Binaural reemerged in the post-Walkman 1980s in a few scattered experiments in North America like Norman Durkee’s binaural opera Oxymora (complete with headphones provided to the audience), and a binaural recording of Steven King’s short story The Mist produced by ZBS radio in upstate New York (both in 1984).\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE43\n\nA brief hype also emerged around Argentinian inventor Hugo Zuccarelli’s “holophonic” binaural system. In a 1983 article in the New Scientist, Zuccarelli claimed the human auditory system emitted a steady sound that could be used as a reference tone for enhanced audio spatialization. He sought to market the idea through a closely guarded proprietary binaural technique he dubbed “holophonics,” a riff on the global popularity of three-dimensional holograms at the time. The system was deployed in early 1980s albums by Psychic TV, Paul McCartney, and Pink Floyd, and on demonstration recordings focused on close-to-the-head sound effects, like scissors heard around the ears during a haircut. Media scholar Takemura Mitsuhiro published two articles crafted to build anticipation for holophonics in Japan around the time of the demonstration record’s Japanese release in the summer of 1987. But even these articles note the system was shrouded in “mystification,” with Zuccarelli suspiciously reluctant to let outsiders verify his claims. In retrospect, it appears likely this secrecy was to avoid further scrutiny of the questionable science behind the system, as several responses to the New Scientist article had quickly pointed out.75 As Takemura notes, even in the post-Walkman years, the fact that binaural systems like Zuccarelli’s demanded headphone use to achieve the promised three-dimensional auditory perspective remained an obstacle to their popular adoption.76 In the meantime, however, three-dimensional spatial sound produced via binaural methods quietly made further inroads into audio production pipelines. Systems like the 1991 Roland Sound Space Processor promised audio engineers the ability to position recorded sounds within a virtual 360-degree sound field. The system would then computationally calculate the appropriate spatial acoustics to match the programmed features of the virtual environment.77 On the consumer side, the outer head localization of the Ambience Phone lived on as features in higher-end Japanese headphones, which today come with an ever-larger set of ambient controls. For example, Sony’s current premier line of noise-canceling headphones, the WH-100XM series, includes a smartphone app with “ambient sound control” options for listeners to select (or have automatically chosen for them based on onboard sensors). The app includes settings for listening while stationary, walking, running, and in transit; the option to apply various concert hall and arena acoustics; and, closest to the original Ambience Phone function, a set of\n\n4 4 ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nFIGURE 1.7 Menu settings in the iOS app for Sony’s WH-100XM2 headphones to virtu-\n\nally reposition the perceived sound origin in relation to the listener’s head. The current selection situates the sound in front of where the listener is facing (captured October 20, 2018).\n\nsound position control options that virtually displace the source of the sound to one of five locations further away from the head (figure 1.7). While they increase the amount of ambient control available to sound engineers and headphone users, each of these systems positionally fix the virtual space to the headphones’ own orientation. If a person turns to face a different direction, the entire soundstage rotates with them. In contrast, when such a system is combined with head-tracking technologies, the three-dimensional sound field can be updated in real time in precise alignment with the position of the listener’s ears. This means that a virtual space will seem to stay fixed in place even as a listener moves within it. This is achieved computationally by rotating or shifting the soundstage in real time in the exact inverse direction and degree of any movement or reorientation of the listener’s head.78 For example, if a listener turns their head left, the sound field produced by the headphones almost instantly pivots an equal and opposite degree to the right to give the impression the virtual ambient space hasn’t shifted at all. In parallel with research on head-tracked visual displays (discussed in chapter 2), the first\n\nACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ERS ON SPACE45\n\nhead-tracked binaural audio was realized in 1988. Head-tracked three-dimensional audio and visuals combined serve as the basis for VR and AR headsets today.79 Extending the strategy used by the Ambience Phone, head-tracked audio effectively collapses the binaural dummy head with the listener’s own. The listener’s movements directly guide auditory perspective within virtual space. From a computational perspective, the listener’s ears become just two more objects to position within a virtual sound field. Conversely, from a first-person listening perspective, the virtual sound environment seems to exist independently in three-dimensional space. Ambience now becomes detached not just from the local physical environment but also from the listener’s own position within it. Steven Jones notes how the spatial persistence of the virtual audio field independent of a listener’s movements plays a crucial role in VR immersion, offering a way to “further distract the user’s attention from the nonvirtual world, to solidify the technology’s ‘authority over the observer.’ ”80 By providing a virtual space seemingly independent of the user, the headset becomes even more completely “a cockpit that the pilot wears,” as VR researcher Thomas Furness once described it.81 Detachable ambience allows a person to locate themselves perceptually “in” a virtual space, even as it remains strapped directly to their head.\n\nEPILOGUE: ACROSS THE CHASM?\n\nEchoing the trajectory of headphone listening, today social attitudes toward VR headsets continue to transform in tandem with the physical environments accompanying their use. Writing in the mid-1980s in one of the earliest cultural studies of the Walkman, Judith Williamson predicted that “personalized mobile viewing would be the logical next step,” given moving image media consumption had already, like sound, moved from the public theater to the private home. “Imagine people walking round the streets with little TVs strapped in front of their eyes,” she writes, essentially predicting that the head-mounted display would follow the Walkman out into the city. A few years later Sony’s Morita Akio, of Walkman fame, similarly declared VR “the next big thing after camcorders.”82\n\n4 6 ACO U STICS O F TH E O NE- P ER SON SPACE\n\nCompared with the Walkman, however, VR still had a range of obstacles to overcome before it could shake the stigma attached to head-mounted media. As I discuss in chapter 2, when VR headsets were first introduced to the general public, a head-mounted display (with a glove interface) cost somewhere between $90,000 to $200,000 USD and weighed five to ten pounds—replicating both the cost and discomfort of early headphones to an even more extreme degree.83 After the recent emergence of stand-alone consumer VR headsets, however, VR as a mobile one-person space has finally emerged as a possibility. People are already testing the cultural acceptability of VR in shared public spaces. In Tokyo, some early adopters of Facebook’s Oculus Go headset have ventured out in public with the device. One such group is the Discord-based Oculus Go o t"
