        "text": "Once upon a time there lived a leader who cared deeply about education. He wanted everyone â not just the children of moneyed elites â to have access to schooling. He understood that the true power of education lay in the learning outcomes in the lives of girls and boys â that their ability to read, write, and count, as well as to analyze and think critically, was more important than schooling inputs, such as desks, textbooks, and classrooms.\n\nâ\n\nThe leader was an education expert, and got to work on his mission, not letting himself get distracted by people who did not share his passion. He wrote a proposal explaining the case for education for all. He marshaled evidence of what worked. He made a detailed plan that included activities, timeframes, and budgets.\n\nâ\n\nArmed with this document, he went to see the Minister for Education. The minister listened and promised to share the proposal with his senior staff.\n\nâ\n\nAnd then, nothing much changed.\n\nâ\n\nTalking Ainât Change\n\nTo be fair, there were speeches, conferences, and policies that said all the right things. But the government officials seemed to be keener about tangible things such as school buildings than children learning. Some of them even brought computers to schools, which were stored in the headmasterâs offices to keep them safe.\n\nThe leader was disappointed but did not give up. He gathered like-minded friends together. They researched more, they wrote more, and they spoke more. They created newsletters, graphics, and policy briefs and disseminated them widely. They formed an Education Sector Working Group to channel ideas to policymakers at local, national, and international levels. They garnered coverage in the education section of leading newspapers. Eventually, the leaderâs work earned him a prestigious award from an international agency.\n\nâ\n\nBack home, however, little had changed in education.\n\nâ\n\nHow Influence Works\n\nOne year, a young intern joined his organization. She was assigned to edit research reports and write policy briefs, and asked to conclude her assignments with a list of clear recommendations and a plea to the government to heed the evidence.\n\nâ\n\nOne day she came to the leader to suggest that instead of the recommendations, they quote Shakespeare. âWhy would you want to do that?â asked the leader. âWe do education policy, not literature.â She explained that the Minister for Education is crazy about Shakespeare. He asked how she knew that. She told him that she was in a book club with the ministerâs daughter. The club meets at his house, where he frequently regales the group with quotes from the bard. The leader was unconvinced but let the intern quote Shakespeare.\n\nâ\n\nTo the leaderâs surprise, soon after publication the minister called. He wanted to discuss the brief and asked him to come to his house for tea. The leader happily agreed and asked the intern to help him prepare. âWe need to summarize all the data and action points,â he said. But the intern suggested a different approach: instead of restating our goals, which the minister already knows, how about trying to connect with him, to understand what he cares and worries about?\n\nâ\n\nA fool thinks himself to be wise,\n\nbut a wise man knows himself to be a fool.\n\nShakespeare\n\nâAs You Like Itâ\n\nâ\n\nAt the ministerâs house, the leader remembered that the minister had been a professor of literature and a playwright. They traded stories and discovered they had mutual friends and that they both loved roasted cassava with tons of lime and chili. Just when it seemed like they would never get to talk about education reform, the minister unexpectedly remarked: âYou must be frustrated that we donât implement your recommendations. I am sorry, but the fact is that the Minister for Mining wonât let me.â The leader realized that the minister understood the evidence well, but that his cabinet colleague held an inordinate amount of power in cabinet, and sought to maintain traditional roles for women, to which progressive education was a threat.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAll that Glitters is Not Gold"
