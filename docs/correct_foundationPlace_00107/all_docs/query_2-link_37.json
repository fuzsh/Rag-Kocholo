Justsystems also exhibited last year at the conference, which is the world's largest Java developers' conference.\n\nOne of the major features of xfy is its ability to dynamically handle multiple pieces of XML data simultaneously on the same screen, thus providing a user-friendly visualization environment. This feature of xfy is useful not only in the XML document handling, but is also a powerful expansion of mashup functionality.\n\nMashup is the capability of culling from much of the information from the Web and combining that data in new ways to create information with new value. However, the means have only existed for implementing this on the server side. The xfy technology extends these capabilities, enabling the valuable mashup features to be used on the client side.\n\nAt the JavaOne Conference, Justsystems is exhibiting concrete examples of a quick XML application development platform for enabling a service oriented architecture (SOA), which is a basic xfy capability, as well as the first demonstrations of a Mashup Platform for the Web2.0 era, as an application example.\n\nJustsystems will also unveil a demonstration of xfy middleware solution technology making use of Asynchronous JavaScript + XML (Ajax), which makes it possible to effectively use XML data even in today's browsers.\n\nJustsystems is promoting the linkage of xfy Enterprise Solution 1.0 and next-generation XML databases. Last November, Justsystems announced the development, in partnership with IBM Corporation, of a comprehensive solution for native XML applications. The next version of IBM's DB2, code-named Viper, fully integrates native XML text storage with relational databases (RDBs). The combination of Viper with Justsystems' xfy front-end application platform enables a groundbreaking ease-to-use client-friendly environment and provides native support for XML content processing and business intelligence, thus ushering in a new world of IT.\n\nThis March, Justsystems announced a solution that combines xfy with Oracle Database 10g to enable higher levels of service through the introduction of SOA without the need to rebuild existing RDB systems. This solution also provides for speedy IT deployment, regardless of the skill level of engineers or users. These products will begin shipping in the third quarter of 2006.\n\nNotes:\n\n* The information mentioned or described in this news release is subject to change without notice due to improvements.\n\n* Names of companies and products mentioned are trademarks or registered trademarks of the respective companies.\n\nAbout Justsystems, Inc.\n\nJustsystems, Inc., based in Palo Alto, CA, is a sub-subsidiary of Justsystems Corporation (JASDAQ: 4686).
