        "text": "Ashish Mishra\n\nSchalk Cronjé\n\nWhat is CP-AAT?\n\nCP-AAT stands for “Certified Practitioner –AutomationAgile Testing” certification prepared and honored by “Agile Testing Alliance” & “University Teknologi Malaysia(UTM)”.CP-MAT is the prerequisite for this next level of certification called CP-AAT. Alternatively you should be having at least 3years of relevant experience in Testing and at least one year in an Agile project.The course is applicable for all roles and not just “testers”. Knowledge, experience & certification is consciously designed to focus on “agile testing” and noton “agile testers”.\n\nHow is it useful?\n\nCP-AAT prepares you for utilizing automation effectively in anagile project. It helps you realize the tester’s role in planning and strategizing for Test Automation in an agile project.It gives you insight into the cost-benefit analysis, the opportunities and risks and the Agile team approaches to let the test-first strategy drive the quality goals of the projects. The course covers ATDD and TDD in an hands-on fashion using pairing techniques of XP.It also covers the real-life challenges that a tester would face while applying the strategies. All the concepts are driven using the case studies and actual test automation tasks involved in any live agile projects. The course introduces you to the automation tools such as JUnit, FitNesse and Selenium.\n\nAshish Mishra\n\nMasa K Maeda\n\nWhat is CP-SAT?\n\nCP-SAT stands for “Certified Professional – Selenium Automation Testing” certification prepared and honored by “Agile Testing Alliance” & “University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)”. Having basic knowledge of Java Programming and Manual Testing is the only prerequisite for this training.\n\nThe course is applicable for all roles and not just “testers”. Knowledge, experience & certification is consciously designed to focus on “agile testing” and not on “agile testers”.\n\nHow is it useful?\n\nCP-SAT is designed to train agile professionals with the basics of testing web applications using Selenium leading to advanced topics. You can build, enhance, and maintain scripts in the Eclipse IDE Editor and port Selenese scripts to execution in RC and Selenium 2.x (WebDriver). The training is combination of theory as well as hands-on execution of scripts using the features of Selenium with ample time given to practice until you have mastered the concepts. The Selenium IDE plug-in builds effective and resilient test scripts using a wide variety of current programming languages. The focus is on the practical application of Selenium to resolve common web automated testing challenges. This course focuses on Selenium IDE with RC/Selenium 2.x configuration and execution related concepts using JUnit and TestNG. There is an extensive coverage on Selenium Reporting mechanism, Data Driven Testing, getting started Grid concepts, Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins/Ant.\n\nMasa Kevin Maeda, Founder and CEO of Valueinnova LLC, an Agile Project Management mentoring, coaching, consulting and training company based in Silicon Valley, and with of Offices in 4 countries.

One specific library he can recall is still in daily usage and is used in scanning millions of emails world-wide, yet the customer defect rate is less than one per year, all which can be attributed to TDD. He has been responsible for many a complex product roll-outs where continuous integration and continuous deployment have been the key. He does not consider TDD to be a useful technique, but the absolute key to competitive and agile delivery in this age of globalization.\n\nHe believes that both software engineering and craftsmanship is important for the industry and that both disciplines should be taught to achieve holism in technology delivery. He also understands that there is a strong relationship between the modern software techniques that are used and the signature skills of people and these should be aligned for effective delivery. He holds two engineering degrees and an MBA in technology management.\n\nParimala Hariprasad spent her youth studying people and philosophy. By the time she got to work, she was able to put those learnings to help train skilled testers.
