What does it take to center racial equity in foundations’ investment strategies?

The answer, according to leaders and practitioners in the field, is intentionality. “Going slow to go fast,” as Katherine Pease, Managing Director of Pathstone put it.

Katherine Pease is one of five leaders who joined us in a rich discussion moderated by Senior Advisor, Rosalie Sheehy Cates, on the journey of aligning investment strategies with foundations' racial equity goals and missions. Altogether we sat down with:

Duane Carter, Ed.D (Board Chair, Northwest Area Foundation)

Dan Chu (Executive Director, Sierra Club Foundation)

Erika Seth Davies (Chief Executive Officer, Rhia Ventures)

Timothy O’Donnell, CAIA (Senior Vice President, Fund Evaluation Group, and financial advisor to Sierra Club Foundation)

Katherine Pease (Managing Director, Pathstone)

The discussion was hosted by our friends at RBC Global Asset Management and you can access a full recording here: https://institutional.rbcgam.com/en/us/us/article/navigating-your-new-role/detail

In the video above we highlight some key takeaways from the webinar:

Investment committees sit in a powerful place to work on racial equity

A non-profit fiduciary is obedient to the mission and to just systems.

Investment Policy Statements can reflect core foundation values.

Foundations are important players for systems change

You are not alone!

We're here to support you in this work and look forward to learning with you as we reimagine foundation investing together.
