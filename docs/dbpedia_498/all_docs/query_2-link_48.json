        "text": "Where were you when Apollo 11 landed on the moon 50 years ago?\n\nWe asked our readers that question – there are some common threads in the responses.\n\nMost people watched it on small, portable, black and white televisions or listened to it on the radio.\n\nSoldiers were fighting in Vietnam but listened and watched as they could.\n\nAnd everyone reports being excited by American astronaut Neil Armstrong becoming the first man to walk on the moon.\n\n“One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” he said.\n\n‘I thought Walter Cronkite was going to have a cow’\n\nI was babysitting my younger siblings and watched it on TV in Port Trevorton, PA. It was exciting. I thought Walter Cronkite was going to have a cow right there on national television!\n\n- Carol Long\n\n‘Americans are brave’\n\nI was pulling guard duty in an armored tank park in Amberg, West Germany, at the time. It was a full moon and I looked up and couldn’t believe there were people walking on the moon.\n\nThe following weekend I went into downtown Amberg. Because of my haircut, everybody know I was an American in the military. Everybody came up to be to shake my hand saying, ‘Americans are brave!’\n\nNeedless to say, I was proud to be an American.\n\n- John F. Wydra, Harrisburg\n\nWorked for NASA\n\nWhen man first stepped on the moon, I was watching him on TV at Cocoa Beach in Florida near the Space Center. I worked for NASA and had seen the launch from the top of the VAB (vehicle assembly building)! Awesome!\n\n-- Dr. Anne E. Daniels-Severs, Palmyra\n\n‘Out of this world’ experience\n\nJuly 20, 1969, was also my birthday. My husband and I, with our 1-year old daughter, Lisa, traveled to an Ashtabula, Ohio, restaurant to meet our college friends. The occasion created a “surreal” contradiction that, in this quaint setting, we would witness the “out of this world” reality of a televised Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\nI recall the wide expanse of the room’s wooden floor, echoing footsteps of busy activity but then, there on the TV screen, an image captured the eerie silence as astronaut, Neil Armstrong, descended down the ladder to the dusty floor of the moon – leaving his footprint to forever commemorate, “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nWe were transfixed. It was such a hypnotic moment in time. My focus was only interrupted by my daughter impatiently kicking her wooden highchair and now, as I reflect on the legacy of Apollo 11 50 years later, the challenge continues to dedicate our future generations “to dream the impossible dream” and “to reach for the stars” for our universe is ours to explore.\n\n-- Donna Finnucan, Camp Hill\n\nA road trip to Kennedy Space Center\n\nMy dad loved to take our family on long car trips for our summer vacation. In July of 1969, when I was 14, we drove from our hometown of Erie to Florida to see the moon launch. On July 16, we were standing on a bridge 11 miles from the Kennedy Space Center watching the launch of Apollo 11. From that distance it was a small flame heading up into the sky but it was still very exciting. Later in the week we came back to tour the space center and watched the moon landing on a video monitor. It is my favorite childhood vacation memory.\n\n-- Cindy DeMuth, Hummelstown\n\nA camper’s perspective\n\nI was 15 years old. We were a camping family and were on our way back home to Lemoyne, from a campers' convention in South Carolina. We stopped for the night at Daniel Boone State Park in Kentucky, where we met up with other campers. There were about 30 of us gathered under a dining canopy, and we all watched the moon landing on a 12\" B&W TV. Then we had freshly churned ice cream.\n\n-- Jim Rudy, Hampden Township\n\nRented a hotel room for the TV\n\nOn that day, July 20, 1969, I had recently graduated from Law School, and was working as a deputy district attorney in Philadelphia, under the late Arlen Specter, who was the district attorney, his first elected position. I intentionally planned a very light day -- no court -- so I could spend the day watching the entire landing on the moon. There already were those, even then, who were doubting we were really on the moon, and thought the entire landing was really done in some secret federal government staging area somewhere in the United States. I thought then, if it was what they say, how could they possibly keep that a secret, when many thousands of people around the world were involved. Yes, we had conspiracy “nut-cases” back then, as well. However, we did not yet have big screen TV sets, and certainly not flat screen, high definition television sets. So, some of my friends, rented a room in the then Bellevue-Stratford Hotel on Broad Street, had room service for food and drink, and stayed there all day. We also asked for two other TVs. We were so excited, and did not realize we even had the technical abilities to make this journey to the moon, and then land perfectly on the moon. It seemed like a dream. When they started to come down the stairs from the Lunar Module, with Neil Armstrong (The Commander of Apollo 11) in the lead coming down the stairs, when he first stepped onto the moon’s surface, and said words I will never forget: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” I had tears in my eyes. We watched them leave five U.S. Flags, two or three golf balls (we really laughed at that). We left after that, even though they were still on the moon. I never thought that would happen in my lifetime. When I was leaving that room, I also remember feeling so badly that President John Kennedy, who had really inspired this moon landing, was no longer alive.\n\n-- Corky Goldstein, Harrisburg\n\nRushed out of work\n\nI was the only person in the family who had to work on that day in 1969. My whole family was at my Aunt Jane's house in Columbia, Pennsylvania. As soon as work ended I got in my car and rushed to Columbia. Made the trip from Harrisburg in about 35 minutes - door to door. I missed the actual moon landing but got there in plenty of time to see Neil Armstrong take the first steps, of any human being, on the surface of the moon. On a black and white TV, of course. Quite a thrill!\n\n-- Michael S. Tucci Jr., Harrisburg\n\nOn our honeymoon\n\nAs a combined college graduation and wedding present, my in-laws gave my wife, Ann, and me a six-week honeymoon tour of Europe. We got married on the 22nd of June, one week after Ann graduated from Goucher College, so we are celebrating our 50th anniversary. We both had found jobs teaching school, so we had the summer available!\n\nOn the 20th of July 1969, we were on a bus tour of Vienna, Austria. Since it was our honeymoon, we had many other things that kept us occupied, so we were fairly unaware of what was happening back in the USA. Our tour guide announced to our group that the Americans had landed on the moon, and then distributed roses to every American on the bus. That evening, back at the hotel, we watched the telecast of the moonwalk on a small black and white television, with the narration in German, but we were able to follow the presentation with no trouble.\n\nIt's interesting what you remember, even after 50 years!\n\n-- Tom Ebersbach, Hershey\n\nExpert play-by-play\n\nOn July 20, 1969, my wife and I hosted a moon landing party at our home. Included among the guests was Phil Z., an engineer from Grumman Aerospace on Long Island, New York, who worked on and was given significant credit for the development of the Apollo 11 landing plate which provided the soft landing for the structural legs of the spacecraft.\n\nWe watched the landing on our television set and heard the immortal words of Astronaut Neil Armstrong while Phil narrated the entire process from retro-rockets to landing, from planting the American flag to walking on the moon.\n\nIt was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for everyone that night.\n\n-- Jay E. Laff, Annville\n\nWorking on the railroad\n\nWhat’s not to remember. I had turned 21 a few weeks before. It was summer and I was working as a switchman on the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, my “sort of full-time job” which was putting me through the University of Minnesota. I remember we were working in a switching yard in St. Paul that evening, and I remember I carried a transistor radio so I could listen to the radio and keep track of what was happening. I was on the ground switching rail cars at night with a radio in one hand and a lantern to signal the locomotive engineer in the other. I don’t think we were all that busy that night, so the three of us on the crew, the engineer in the locomotive and my foreman and I were spending more time listening to our radios than actually working.\n\nEventually, the shift ended. It must have been 11 p.m. in Saint Paul, and I quickly got in my car and headed back to my apartment to watch the rest of the evening on our black and white TV. I don’t recall anyone else in the apartment that night, but it was 50 years ago, so who knows how much of what I remember was actually how it happened, but the radio part I am certain about. I wonder what happened to the radio.\n\n-- Stephan (Steve) Vegoe, Lebanon\n\nIn Vietnam\n\nI was a U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant and adviser to a South Vietnamese infantry company in Quang Tri Province. We were arrayed in and around a cemetery late at night when a South Vietnamese soldier came up to me to report, “Americans are walking on the moon.” As a precaution, I took the news lying down -- just in case someone else was listening. I was struck by the irony that I was involved in one of the oldest lines of work in history while two others were engaged in the newest.\n\n-- Wayne A. Silkett, retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Boiling Springs\n\nWatched with students\n\nOn Sunday, July 20, 1969, 9th grade Lower Dauphin Junior High School civics teachers Paul Shirk and Bill Minsker, as student council advisors, were completing the third day of a 3-day junior high school student council planning retreat for the coming academic year with a group of future LDJHS student council officers and members. The retreat was held on a farm close to McAlisterville (Juniata County). On the floor of the farm house, all of us sat huddled around a small portable red television, watching in amazement the live moon landing and first walk as it occurred. Having access to no cable or antenna, we crafted a TV antenna from a coat hanger, so as to improve the televised image. As Paul and Bill continue to remain in contact with some of these students during eventual high school graduation class reunions, the image of these events remains forever strongly imbedded within our memories.\n\n-- Bill Minsker, Linglestown\n\nOn a plane\n\nMy wife and I, along with our newborn son and year-old daughter, were flying to Bismark, North Dakota, to begin my two-year military service. I was staring out the window at a gorgeous full moon when the pilot announced with great excitement that the lunar landing was successful. All on board were cheering and shaking hands with total strangers. Imaginations ran wild with many passengers certain they could actually see the lunar module. Spontaneously most of the passengers got up to look out the right-side windows which caused a little panic with the flight attendants and caused the pilot to make a course adjustment for a better view. I remember how proud and excited all of the passengers were because our country was going through some difficult times and we all needed a little positive news and this certainly lifted our spirits.\n\n-- Ray Perry, Hershey\n\nWatched from Panama\n\nI witnessed man’s first steps on the moon from the Panama Canal Zone while participating in jungle training there as a member of a U.S. Navy and Marine Amphibious Group on a deployment to the Caribbean area. I was a Marine helicopter pilot with the Amphibious Group and training for imminent deployment to Vietnam. We were operating ashore from Albrook AFB on the Atlantic end of the canal at the time, while our embarked Marine Battalion Landing Team trained at Fort Sherman on the Pacific end. As I recall, the moon walk occurred sometime during the evening. I watched the event with several other pilots on a black and white TV in the lounge of the Visiting Officers’ Quarters after supper following a full day of flying. I think the celebrating that occurred at the time was probably a loud cheer and an enthusiastic toast to our astronauts since I’m sure all of us would have had cans of beer in our hands at that time of day and Neil Armstrong was also a Naval aviator – one of our own.\n\n-- Larry Smith, Middletown\n\nA party and a curfew\n\nThere was cake, ice cream, sweet sixteen kisses from the girls, and Walter Cronkite on TV!\n\nOn July 20, 1969, during the moon landing, I was celebrating my 16th birthday! My parents had invited about 20 of my friends and classmates to my birthday party. Because of a curfew due to racial unrest in my home town of York, the party time had to be moved earlier to late afternoon. Also, due to the unrest, some of my friends were not allowed to come to the party. A day that I’ll never forget. I remember it all like it was yesterday!\n\n-- John Scarpato, New Cumberland\n\nStationed in Germany\n\nWhile my husband, Jim, was with the U.S. Army, we both went to Wildflecken, Germany, that is located in a rural, mountainous area of Bavaria about 2 1/2 hrs south of Frankfurt. There was no American TV (only stations in German language) in that area at that time, but a huge antenna was installed after we went back to the U.S. in 1970. We were at the NCO Club on July 20, 1969, and walked into a back room where their TV was covering the Apollo 11 moon landing. At that very moment, Neil Armstrong hopped down on the surface of the moon, saying “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” We were thrilled that we could actually view the event “live!” I will never forget it!!\n\n-- Janet Williams, Mechanicsburg\n\nThey nearly crashed\n\nIn July 1969, I was an 11-year-old on a lake-cabin vacation at one of Minnesota’s 10,000 lakes. I loved following the space program, and the one small TV in the lodge would have to do to watch Apollo 11 developments. I was alone in the lodge by the TV that afternoon, tracking the landing on the moon, which I found much more interesting (and, as it turns out, dramatic) than a couple guys walking around collecting samples. The warm, sunny day and allure of swimming and water skiing on Lake Kabekona kept everyone else outside. Frankly, I was disgusted there weren’t more (or anyone?) interested in the moon landing –- right up there with the Wright brothers’ 1903 first flight as far as I was concerned.\n\nAfter the breath-taking landing, I reported back to my dad on the lakeside dock “they nearly crashed” (almost true). That drama was overlooked that night as 100+ vacationers gathered in the lodge to watch the deliberate procedures Armstrong and Aldrin went through to finally set foot on the moon. It was painfully warm in the lodge that night (no A/C), but everyone stayed until the “... one giant leap for mankind.”\n\n-- Rich Krampe, Harrisburg\n\nNo better gift\n\nI could not have asked for a better gift. The first person ever to set foot on the moon was going to do it on MY birthday! This Baltimore boy who loved science and science fiction, whose hobby was astronomy, would celebrate his 14th birthday watching a man step onto another world. What could be better? But, in the midst of this thrilling adventure, there was a major setback – not for NASA, but for me. After the Eagle had landed, the astronauts changed the plan. They decided to skip their scheduled sleep time and go moon-walking first. Who could blame them? How could they sleep? But I was crushed. My birthday gift was being taken back. The first lunar excursion was not going to happen on July 21, 1969, but on the night before, missing my birthday by hours. Selfishly, I chafed at this change, that is, until Neil Armstrong began descending the lunar ladder of history. I quickly forgot my birthday disappointment and watched with the rest of the world a live television broadcast from the moon. It was still the greatest birthday ever!\n\n-- Dennis Gerkin, Enola (originally from Baltimore)\n\nLong hours paid off\n\nMy husband, Frank, our three sons, and I were glued to our black and white television just waiting for the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) to land on the moon, like the rest of the world. It meant a lot more to us, as Frank worked for Grumman Aerospace on Long Island who made the LEM.\n\nWe were in a “cold war” and race to the moon with Russia. Our astronauts had gone to outer space, but the Russians Cosmonauts had actually circumvented the globe. The race was on.\n\nIn 1960, President Kennedy challenged us to put a man on the moon in ten years. Due to their experience with fighter planes during WWII, Grumman was the logical choice to build the LEM. On this mission, the LEM was named Eagle.\n\nA hard charging group of men and women at Grumman often worked 16 hours a day and 13 straight days to meet deadlines -- I know, because Frank was one of them.\n\nUnfortunately, President Kennedy didn’t live to see our lofty dreams come to fruition, when the world heard those memorable words, “THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.”\n\n-- Ellen Bagatta, Hummelstown\n\nInfluenced my studies\n\nThe summer of 1969 was memorable in so many ways. I had just graduated from high school. My father, being a minister, had accepted a new pastoral position so our family was preparing to move to a new town. I had been accepted to the college of my choice. My life was changing.\n\nOn July 20, my father was installed as minister of his new church. The reception was scheduled for the same evening as the first moon landing. Everyone at the church wanted to get home to watch this momentous event. Since we lived in the parsonage, which was a short distance from the church, we were able to run home as soon as the reception was over. We all gathered around the TV to hear “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”\n\nWith all the exciting space events during my public school years, it is no wonder that I studied earth science and mathematics in college.\n\n-- Linda F. Hagenbuch, Dillsburg\n\nCar was stolen\n\nI have two memories from July 20, 1969. First is the landing of the Lunar Module on the moon and man setting foot on the moon’s surface for the first time. My second memory is that of our family car being stolen while we watched the landing. My father worked at the Lebanon Steel Foundry. We lived only four blocks away. My father was due to be at work at 11 p.m., so he had put everything in the car, including the keys and came back into the house to watch the moon landing. When the landing was successful, he left to go to work. When he got to the front door he saw the car was gone, someone had stolen it. The car was found two days later in Reading. From that point forward my Dad parked the car in the backyard, never on the street again.\n\n-- Ray Heberling, Myerstown\n\nA puppy named Apollo\n\nOur family had just moved from Virginia to Pennsylvania, and we have good reasons to remember where we were when Apollo 11 landed. Our doberman, Bonnie, was giving birth to pups and we were excited. We also were eager to see the moon landing. Each time a new puppy arrived we dashed into the house to watch TV. The 11th puppy arrived just after Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon. This one we named Apollo.\n\n-- Ruth E. Smith, Silver Spring Township\n\nTwo reasons to be excited\n\nOn July 19, 1969, my wife, Marilyn, our children, Tonya, 6, David, 5, and Dawn, 2 ½, and I watched the Apollo 11 TV events with great anticipation as our daughter Tonya’s 7th birthday was also on July 20. She tried to stay awake past midnight just in case she’d see the landing, but Tonya fell asleep just before midnight. On the 20th, while preparing for her birthday party around 4 p.m., we got to see the actual landing on the moon and watch Neil Armstrong be the first to walk on the moon and later Buzz Aldrin. Tonya understood, and we were thrilled it happened on her birthday but David and Dawn were just excited because lots of other kids were coming to our house to play.\n\n-- Wayne Sponic, Millersburg\n\nFuzzy memories\n\nThough I was only 4 years old at the time, I remember watching the Apollo 11 landing on TV because when my mom called me into the living room, she told me this was a historic event, and that I needed to remember it. And it was unusual – watching fuzzy black and white images and trying to understand that they were walking on the moon! A few days later, I remember us watching their module being fished out of the ocean and the astronauts emerging on the deck of the ship.\n\n-- Pam Bennett, Colonial Park\n\nBinge watching\n\nLong Beach, California, was having a warm summer. We had moved into our first home, a tiny 950 square foot, two-bedroom, with no air conditioning. I was 8 months pregnant with our first baby.\n\nIn the small living room the sofa was a pull-out bed, so this also served as our “guest bedroom.” Most folks we knew had only one TV, and that’s where ours sat. With my advancing pregnancy and the heat, we were likely to take it easy when we got home from work. The lift-off and travel of Apollo 11 was dominating the news. We often pulled out the sofa-bed and, propped up with pillows, dinner balanced on our laps, binge-watched this almost hard-to-believe journey.\n\nSometimes our new Saint Bernard puppy, Phoebe, joined us when we couldn’t pull ourselves away from the Apollo coverage. Along with Americans and people around the world we cheered Neil Armstrong’s first step, and all the efforts of so many that allowed this momentous event to happen.\n\nOne month later our son, Ernie, was born. In August, he will celebrate his 50th birthday. As long as we are still able to remember his birth year, we will not forget that 1969 was the year we landed on the moon!\n\n-- Lynda Thomason, Chambersburg\n\nGood Morning, Pennsylvania"
