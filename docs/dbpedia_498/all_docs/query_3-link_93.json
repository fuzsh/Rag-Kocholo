        "text": "About the Species\n\nHarbor seals in Chatham MA - Photo: NOAA Fisheries\n\nHarbor seals are one of the most common marine mammals along the U.S. West and East Coasts. They are commonly seen resting on rocks and beaches along the coast and on floating ice in glacial fjords with their head and rear flippers elevated in a “banana-like” position.\n\nState-financed bounty hunters once hunted harbor seals in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Maine because they were considered competitors of fishermen. This hunting program ended in 1960.\n\nHarbor seals, like all marine mammals, are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nPopulation Status\n\nIn the United States, NOAA Fisheries has identified 16 stocks of harbor seals. Twelve of these stocks are in Alaska,and the other 4 are the California, Oregon-Washington coastal, Washington inland waters, and the western North Atlantic stocks. In Alaska, there are the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands, Bristol Bay, North Kodiak, South Kodiak, Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet/Shelikof Strait, Glacier Bay/Icy Strait, Lynn Canal/Stephens Passage, Sitka/Chatham Strait, Dixon/Cape Decision, and Clarence Strait stocks. The Bristol Bay stock in Alaska includes a small population of freshwater harbor seals that live in Iliamna lake, located in Southcentral Alaska.\n\nEach stock has experienced different population trends over the past 30 years. Along the West Coast, stocks are stable or unknown and the population in New England appears to be stable. Individual breeding and molting colonies can number in the thousands in some of these areas. While most of the 12 harbor seal stocks in Alaska are stable or increasing over the past 8 years, seals in the Aleutian Islands, Glacier Bay, and Icy Strait regions have likely declined. There is a small but apparently stable population of less than 500 harbor seals in the Pribilof Islands.\n\nLearn more about our estimates for population size in our stock assessment reports\n\nAppearance\n\nHarbor seals are part of the true seal family. All true seals have short forelimbs, or flippers. They also lack external ear flaps and instead have a small hole (opening to the ear canal) on either side of their head.\n\nHarbor seals weigh up to 285 pounds and measure up to 6 feet in length. Males are slightly larger than females, and seals in Alaska and the Pacific Ocean are generally larger than those found in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHarbor seals have short, dog-like snouts. The color of each seal’s fur varies but there are two basic patterns: light tan, silver, or blue-gray with dark speckling or spots, and a dark background with light rings. Harbor seals molt (shed hair) in the mid to late summer for 1-2 months, spending more time out of the water.\n\nBehavior and Diet\n\nHarbor seals haul out (rest) on rocks, reefs, beaches, and drifting glacial ice when they are not traveling and/or foraging at sea. They haul out to regulate their body temperature, molt, interact with other seals, give birth, and nurse their pups. These seals also haul out in groups to avoid predators and spend less time being watchful for predators than those that haul out alone.\n\nHarbor seal pelvic bones are fused, preventing them from moving their hind flippers under their pelvis to walk on land like sea lions. Instead, they move by undulating in a caterpillar-like motion. This behavior does not mean they are injured.\n\nHarbor seal pups can swim at birth. They can also dive for up to 2 minutes when they are only 2 to 3 days old and by the end of their first month of life embark on journeys of over 100 miles from their natal area. Mother harbor seals sometimes raise their pups in nurseries—groups of mothers and their young—that help protect the seals from predators.\n\nThe harbor seal’s diet consists mainly of fish, shellfish, and crustaceans. Harbor seals complete both shallow and deep dives while hunting, depending on the availability of prey. They can sleep underwater and come up for air once every 30 minutes.\n\nWhere They Live\n\nHarbor seals live in temperate coastal habitats along the northern coasts of North America, Europe, and Asia. They occur on the U.S. East and West coasts. On the East Coast, harbor seals are found from the Canadian Arctic to the Mid-Atlantic. Harbor seals are found all along the West Coast of North America, from Baja California, Mexico to the Bering Sea. They have long been considered non-migratory and typically stay within 15 to 31 miles of their natal area, but tracking data have shown they sometimes travel 62 to 486 miles from their tagging location, often to exploit seasonally available food or give birth to pups.\n\nLifespan & Reproduction\n\nHarbor seals reach sexual maturity between 3 and 7 years old. While females usually give birth during the spring and summer, the pupping season varies by location. Along the West Coast, pups are born earlier in the south than in the north. The only exception is harbor seals in the inland waters of Washington, which are born 2 months later than seals along the outer coast of Washington.\n\nHarbor seals mate in the water. Females are pregnant for about 10 months. Pups weigh about 24 pounds at birth and are ready to swim within minutes. They nurse for 4 to 6 weeks on milk that is 50 percent fat. Like adults, seal pups haul out to rest and regulate their body temperature. Adult females forage during lactation.\n\nThreats\n\nEntanglement\n\nHarbor seals can become entangled in fishing gear and other types of marine debris, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. They can become entangled in many different fishing gear types, including gillnets, trawls, purse seines, or weirs. Once entangled, seals may drown if they cannot reach the surface to breathe, or they may drag attached gear for long distances as they swim, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or serious injury, all of which may lead to reduced reproductive success and even death.\n\nIllegal Feeding and Harassment\n\nIllegal feeding of harbor seals can lead to many problems including habituation, aggression, negative impacts to fisheries, entanglement, injury, and death. Harassment, including repeated exposure to vessel traffic and other disturbance, can degrade important nursery, molting, and haul out areas for harbor seals. Increased vessel traffic can also cause altered behavior, increased energetic expenditures, and increased exposure to stress. For example, in Alaska, vessel traffic can displace seals from ice floes, putting pups at risk from increased time spent in cold water and separation from their mothers.\n\nLearn more about the Alaska harbor seal approach guidelines in glacial fjords (PDF, 2 pages)\n\nHabitat Degradation\n\nHarbor seals are susceptible to habitat loss and degradation. Physical barriers, which may include shoreline and offshore structures for development (e.g., for oil and gas, dredging, pile driving), can limit access to important migration, breeding, feeding, molting, or pupping areas. Oil and gas development, commercial and recreational development (including resort development), and increased vessel traffic may displace seals or their prey that would normally use those areas.\n\nChemical Contaminants\n\nContaminants enter ocean waters from many sources, including oil and gas development, wastewater discharges, agricultural and urban runoff, and other industrial processes. Once in the environment, these substances move up the food chain and accumulate in top predators such as harbor seals. These chemicals do not degrade. Harbor seals accumulate contaminants, which threaten their immune and reproductive systems, in their blubber, blood, and organs (for example, liver or brain). These chemicals can be passed on to their pups during pregnancy and in milk.\n\nVessel Collisions\n\nInadvertent vessel collisions can injure or kill harbor seals. Harbor seals are vulnerable to vessel collisions throughout their range, but the risk is much higher in some coastal areas with heavy vessel traffic.\n\nScientific Classification\n\nKingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Carnivora Family Phocidae Genus Phoca Species vitulina\n\nNOAA Fisheries is committed to the protection of harbor seals. Targeted management actions taken to secure protections for these seals include:\n\nReducing Contaminants\n\nHarbor seals are vulnerable to chemical contaminants because they are near the top of the food chain. NOAA's Damage Assessment, Remediation, and Restoration Program, which cleans up existing contamination, has several active projects in the Pacific Northwest and California.\n\nEducating the Public\n\nSome harbor seals haul out in public areas. Together with the West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network, we have developed programs to educate the public about how to “Share the Shore” with harbor seals, as well as prohibitions against capturing, harming, or harassing them.\n\nLanugo Harbor Seal Pups Frequently Asked Questions (PDF, 2 pages)\n\nShare the Shore: Habor Seals on the West Coast\n\nShare the Shore with Seals in New England/Mid-Atlantic\n\nSharing Seal Space by the Seashore\n\nImplementing Oil Spill Response Plans in the Event of a Spill\n\nHarbor seals are at risk of harm in the event of an oil spill. To reduce the risk of a spill, Washington’s Department of Ecology created the Spill Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Program. To minimize the effect of a potential spill on harbor seals more broadly, NOAA developed the Marine Mammal Oil Spill Response Guidelines.\n\nOverseeing Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response\n\nWe work with volunteer networks in all coastal states to respond to marine mammal strandings including all pinnipeds. When stranded animals are found alive, NOAA Fisheries and our partners assess the animal’s health and determine the best course of action. When stranded animals are found dead, our scientists work to understand and investigate the cause of death. Although the cause often remains unknown, scientists can sometimes attribute strandings to disease, harmful algal blooms, vessel strikes, fishing gear entanglements, pollution exposure, and underwater noise. Some strandings can serve as indicators of ocean health, giving insight into larger environmental issues that may also have implications for human health and welfare.\n\nLearn more about the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program\n\nMarine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events\n\nThere is an ongoing Harbor Seal Unusual Mortality Event (UME) on the East Coast, and the species has experienced unusual mortality events in the past. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, an unusual mortality event (UME) is defined as \"a stranding that is unexpected; involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population; and demands immediate response.\" To understand the health of marine mammal populations, scientists study unusual mortality events.\n\nGet information on active and past UMEs\n\nGet an overview of marine mammal UMEs\n\nReducing Vessel Disturbance and Strikes\n\nThe most effective way to reduce vessel disturbance is for vessels to stay away from seals. If this is not possible, the second-best option is for vessels to follow voluntary approach guidelines. Both have the added benefit of also reducing risk of vessel strikes.\n\nIn Alaska, for example, we have issued voluntary approach guidelines to reduce the disturbance of harbor seals in glacial fjords. Tidewater glacier areas provide essential habitat for harbor seals, especially when nursing pups and molting. Scientific research indicated that previous marine mammal approach measures (voluntary guidelines to avoid approaching within 100 yards) were not adequately protecting harbor seals from disturbance in Alaska’s glacial fjords. Because glaciers in Alaska are experiencing unprecedented rates of ice loss, harbor seals are already coping with reduced ice cover at some tidewater glaciers, which makes them more sensitive to other impacts.\n\nFor these reasons, NOAA developed the Alaska Harbor Seal Approach Guidelines in Glacial Fjords. The guidelines suggest that all vessels (from kayaks to cruise ships) should:\n\nStrive to maintain 500 yards from seals without compromising safe navigation\n\nMake an approach plan to avoid surprising seals\n\nBe equally as cautious to reduce disturbance when departing the fjord as arriving\n\nMinimize wake, avoid abrupt changes in course or engine pitch, and avoid loud noises (such as collisions with ice) near seals\n\nTry to avoid traveling through thick ice, as the absence of seals on the ice does not mean the area is not being used\n\nTime visits when feasible to minimize overlap with the peak numbers of seals hauled out midday and minimize the chances of disturbance\n\nAlaska Harbor Seal Approach Guidelines in Glacial Fjords brochure\n\nFrequent Questions: Alaska Harbor Seal Approach Guidelines in Glacial Fjords\n\nProviding Sustainable Harbor Seal Subsistence\n\nAs the primary consumptive users of Alaska harbor seals, Alaska Natives are committed to a long-term, sustainable harvest of harbor seals for food and handicrafts. Their long history of self-regulation coupled with a rich oral tradition and day-to-day contact with Alaska harbor seals gives them special insights into and knowledge of this important marine mammal. There are currently two Alaska Native Organizations/tribes that hold harbor seal co-management agreements with NOAA Fisheries under Section 119 of the MMPA, the Aleut Marine Mammal Commission and the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island. Additionally, the Traditional Council of St. George works collaboratively with the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island and NOAA Fisheries to conduct harbor seal surveys to better understand the size and distribution of the Pribilof Islands harbor seal stock.\n\nLearn more about the subsistence harvest of harbor seals in Alaska"
