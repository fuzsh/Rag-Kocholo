        "text": "Q: Can I change my event?\n\nA: Yes. If you signed up for the actual race and now can't make it, that's ok. You can Transfer to the Virtual Run. Perhaps you signed up for the actual run but want to change your race distance (usually people get more realistic about their training and want to switch from the 10K to the 5K or to the 1 Mile) That's ok. You can switch distance. Find your registration confirmation email (search \"RUNSIGNUP\") and go to Manage Registration. From the webpage you land on look at the bottom area and Transfer Event. Then you can do the switch you want at no charge.\n\nQ: For Virtual Runners that paid for shipping when are the packets mailed?\n\nA: We receive the runner premiums during race week, and our volunteers assemble the packets on Thursday and Friday so we can ship out beginning on Monday after the race.\n\nQ: What is the plan in case of inclement weather?\n\nA: On race day, if thunderstorms and lightning are present the event will be delayed up to 2 hours. In the case of a lengthy delay, the 10K event will be cancelled and runners will only run 5K.\n\nQ; I have a medical condition and I am in a high risk group that is susceptible to infection. May I come to the race?\n\nA: No. If you have a medical condition please take advantage of our Virtual race option so you are not exposed to hundreds of other runners.\n\nQ: How will we get our medals?\n\nA: Runners at the actual race: Medals will be handed out at the finish line. Runners for the Virtual Race: Medals will be included in their packets.\n\nQ: Are there age group awards?\n\nA: Yes, there are age group awards for the 5K and 10K for runners in the actual (not virtual) race.\n\nQ: If I signed up for the Virtual race, do I submit my time?\n\nA: We don't require a time submission from Virtual runners. We trust that they will run at a time and place that is convenient.\n\nQ. How do I contact you if I have questions?\n\nA: There is a RACE CONTACT INFO form on this website with a green button that says QUESTIONS?\n\nSEE YOU AT THE MOON! :)\n\nHow a Virtual Run Works:\n\nIf you have a conflict with the race date or you feel more comfortable not running at the actual race, or if we must switch the actual race to a virtual race due to government directives or health concerns you can still get all of the great race bling. You will pick up your materials at the regular packet pickup locations. We will notify you of these dates. If you paid Shipping & Handling then we will mail your packet to you the week after the race.\n\nComplete your run/walk anytime after the pick up dates, as convenient for you. This can be outside, or on a treadmill. We do not require you to submit your race times to us. We trust you.\n\nWe will keep all race participants informed through email, and updates on this webpage.\n\nFormer NASA Astronaut Carl Walz will help kick off the 2024 Run to the Moon on July 20, 2024, at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum on the 55th anniversary of the Apollo 11 historic moon landing and first steps on the moon by Astronaut Neil Armstrong.\n\nWalz, a Cleveland native and retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force, spent 231 days in space on four space flights, including as crew during the 196-day Expedition-4 aboard the International Space Station.
