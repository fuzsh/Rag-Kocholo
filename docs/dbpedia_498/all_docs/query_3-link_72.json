        "text": "The Cold War space race began with the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. The United States responded with the launch of Explorer 1, which discovered the Van Allen radiation belts, and ultimately developed the rockets and spacecraft needed to carry astronauts to the surface of the moon and bring them safely back home.\n\nIt was one of the most remarkable periods in United States history, especially given the moon program's extraordinary cost and technical difficulty. Here are the major events on the road to the Apollo 11 moon landing â€” along with some significant moments in history along the way.\n\n1957:\n\nOct. 4: The Soviet Union launches Sputnik, the first artificial satellite.\n\n1958:\n\nJan. 31: Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite, is launched; discovers Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nJuly 29: The National Aeronautics and Space Act is signed, creating the civilian space agency.\n\nOct. 7: NASA starts the Mercury program, leading to development of one-man space capsules designed to prove humans can live and work in space.\n\n1959:\n\nJan. 3: Alaska becomes the 49th state.\n\nJan. 4: The Soviet Union's Luna 1 becomes the first spacecraft to reach the moon's vicinity.\n\nFeb. 16: Fidel Castro becomes prime minister of Cuba.\n\nApril 9: Seven astronauts are selected for the Mercury program: Alan Shepard, Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper and Donald \"Deke\" Slayton.\n\nDecember: NASA begins development of Saturn rockets.\n\n1960:\n\nJuly: Apollo is selected as the name for NASA's advanced manned space flight program.\n\nNov. 8: John F.

Under this scheme, two spacecraft will be launched to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, one will descend to the surface and later rejoin the other for the trip back to Earth. This concept evolves into the three-man Apollo capsule and lunar landing module.\n\nSept. 12: JFK speech at Rice University: \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\"\n\nOct. 16-28: Cuban missile crisis.\n\n1963:\n\nAug. 28: Martin Luther King gives \"I have a dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.\n\nSeptember: JFK urges space cooperation with Soviet Union. Premier Nikita Khrushchev does not respond.\n\nNov. 16: JFK visits Cape Canaveral for the final time and comes away with renewed enthusiasm for the Apollo program.\n\nNov. 22: JFK assassinated in Dallas.
