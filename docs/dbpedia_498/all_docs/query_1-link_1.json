        "text": "Locally known alternative pop heroes, Walk the Moon, will be coming back to their hometown to play at the Bunbury Music Festival on Friday on the Sawyer Point stage at 7:30!\n\nThe band consists of Nicholas Petricca on lead vocals/synths, Kevin Ray on bass/vocals, Sean Waugaman on drums/vocals, and Eli Maiman on guitar/vocals.\n\nSince the release of “Shut Up and Dance” from their latest album, Talking is Hard, the band made appearances on NBC’s The Voice, Ellen DeGeneres, The Today Show, and Jimmy Kimmel Live to name a few. Along with that, they also have been on Billboard’s top 20 pop songs list for 14 weeks and have been at number 3 for three weeks.\n\nPrior to all of that, Petricca formed the band in 2008 with the original members, but when 2010 hit the band went through some changes where some members left and Waugaman and Ray were added to the band. As the years went by, Walk the Moon started building a huge fan base in their hometown. With their eccentric live shows and their ability to illustrate their talent with everyone, the band became much bigger than anyone would have expected.\n\nJust after four full length albums, the band started to become well known throughout the U.S. and other countries.\n\nThey started appearing on late night T.V. and started touring with Panic At the Disco. The band played a sold-out show at Bogart’s on April 1, where Mayor John Cranley declared that day to be Walk the Moon Day.\n\nWith their high energy and their eccentric performances, there is no doubt that Walk the Moon will put on an amazing show on Friday."
