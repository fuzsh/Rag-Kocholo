        "text": "Congratulations Iowa! We're all a bunch of filthy-mouthed individuals! Okay...maybe not all of us.\n\nI'll be the first to admit that I have no problem letting a few choice words rip on a daily basis. If I'm talking with my buddies, hanging out with a group of friends, or I'm on the golf course with my wife, I can get pretty creative with the foul language.\n\nThat's probably not something to be proud of exactly but I'm only using the gifts I was born with. What I do know is it can be an extremely satisfying way to express yourself! Whether you're happy/excited about something or you're angry/frustrated, it can feel good to let a curse word out.\n\nWhen it comes to swearing I was always taught that there is a time and a place. I never swore in front of my grandmothers, I try to never swear in front of my mother, I keep the swear words to a whisper so only those around me can hear when I'm in public, and I try to never swear around my young nieces and nephews.\n\nYou also don't need to swear AT someone. Swearing WITH someone is completely different. Once you start throwing insults with curse words at somebody, you're pretty much asking them to get mad at you.\n\nThe great news is that here in Iowa...I'm not alone!\n\nStates That Swear The Most\n\nThrillist has done a study on which states swear the most and Iowa has cracked the top 5! Once again...I'm not sure if that's something we should be proud of but I'm taking it as a win.\n\nA company called LivePerson provides companies with \"live customer chat and messages services for nearly 20,000 companies.\" They analyzed the conversations from 500 different brands and counted the frequency of swear words used in those conversations vs words that are associated with politeness.\n\nIowa was ranked as the state that swears the 4th most in the country! The top 5 states that use the most curse words are\n\n5 - Utah\n\n4 - Iowa\n\n3 - Alaska\n\n2 - Utah\n\n1 - Virginia\n\nLivePerson divided the swear words into two separate categories. There were \"hard\" swear words and \"soft\" swear words. Hard swearing would include words such as f***,s***,b****,a**, etc. Soft swearing would include words like stupid, shoot, suck, and crap.\n\nThe 5 states that use the least amount of curse words are Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, and South Carolina.\n\nOther Interesting Findings\n\nSorry guys, I hate to call us out here but in the least surprising news of all time, men are 16.5% more likely to curse during a customer service interaction than women are, according to Thrillist. I'm sure all of us could've seen that coming. The study also found people were more likely to be polite if their name was used during one of these exchanges and our likely hood of swearing changed depending on who we were talking to.\n\n\"People were most polite when interacting with service pros in the pharmaceutical, consulting, banking, energy, and financial services industries. Conversely, it found industries you might expect to encounter more friendly people -- charities, foundations, and nonprofits -- had the least polite customers.\"\n\nIf you're talking to a customer service representative, it's almost never their fault for the issue you may be trying to resolve. You can be frustrated and upset but it's most likely not that persons fault. Do you really have to take it out on them?\n\nWhen it comes to swearing...there's a time and a place for it. That lesson has helped keep me out of a lot of trouble in my life."
