        "text": "For more than 130 years, the National Geographic Society has invested in and elevated the work of explorers, educators and storytellers. On Thursday, eight other inspiring pioneers were honored with National Geographic Awards, given annually to the world’s most innovative trailblazers who have made incredible contributions in science, education, technology, storytelling, and conservation.\n\nRolex National Geographic Explorer of the Year: Corey Jaskolski\n\nEngineer Corey Jaskolski, recipient of the explorer of the year award, was honored for his innovative imaging techniques which have helped redefine exploration and conservation. A National Geographic Fellow, engineer and inventor, Jaskolski designs, builds and deploys technologies for exploration and conservation missions in some of the world’s most unique and unforgiving environments.\n\nEliza Scidmore Award for Outstanding Science Media: Erika Larsen\n\nAs an award-winning photographer and storyteller, Larsen creates intimate essays about cultures that maintain close ties with nature. The Eliza Scidmore Award recognizes her inclusive, visionary, and conservation-focused storytelling.\n\nFurther Award: Jimmy Chin & Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi\n\nThrough their daring and captivating work, Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi have given us a front-row seat to astonishing physical feats and triumphs and a spellbinding look at hard-to-reach places that few have seen in person. Among their groundbreaking films is the award-winning Free Solo, which follows climber Alex Honnold as he becomes the first person to ascend Yosemite’s El Capitan without a rope. They received the Further Award for their achievements as boundary-pushing filmmakers and storytellers.\n\nGilbert M. Grosvenor Educator of the Year: Jennifer Chavez-Miller\n\nAs a full-time educator at Central New Mexico Community College, Jennifer Chavez-Miller creates unique opportunities for her students to develop global competence and connect with the world. Her commitment to inspiring a new generation of empowered, curious, and engaged lifelong learners and global citizens is the reason educator Jennifer Chavez-Miller was selected for the Gilbert M. Grosvenor Educator of the Year award.\n\nNational Geographic Society/Buffett Awards for Leadership in Conservation: Jeannie Raharimampionona & Angela Maldonado\n\nConservationist Jeannie Raharimampionona was awarded the National Geographic Society/Buffett Award for Leadership in Conservation in Africa for her dedication over the last two decades to protecting and bringing awareness to the massive destruction of the Malagasy flora. Through her work, Jeannie has created 11 — soon to be 12 — protected areas that will help conserve the extraordinary diversity of plants only found in Madagascar.\n\nConservationist Angela Maldonado was awarded the National Geographic Society/Buffett Award for Leadership in Conservation in Latin America for her dedication to reducing the illegal wildlife trade in the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon. Her efforts have resulted in a hunting ban on night monkeys and an open investigation into this illegal market, dramatically reducing the trafficking of night monkeys captured and sold for use in laboratory experiments.\n\nPlanetary Leadership Award: Justin Trudeau\n\nJustin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, received the Planetary Leadership Award in recognition of his efforts to protect Canada’s land and waters. Trudeau has increased Canada’s protected marine areas from less than one percent in 2015 to 14 percent today. Though the award is being given to the Prime Minister, it also recognizes Canada’s partnership with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Government of Nunavut to invest almost $200 million to establish Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area and Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area. This transformative partnership with Indigenous peoples will help protect more than 425,000 square kilometers of ocean."
