        "text": "A SEESAW BALANCED WITH MOONS: This concept can be made more dramatic by actually sketching the 81½ moons stacked opposite the Earth on a seesaw (balance) scale. Since the children are now aware of the small size of the moon when compared to Earth, virtually everyone will concede that the Earth must be heavier than the moon. But how much heavier...? Many moons would be needed on one side of the scale to balance the Earth on the other side. Survey the class, using the answers of five or six students to establish an opinion. A typical numerical range might be 8, 20, 50, 75, 120, and 500. A response of 50 is almost assured. This limits some of the more absurd statements which elementary children are prone to give under such circumstances. The number 50 also acts like a barometer indicating the successfulness of the approach. It certainly is reasonable to assume that if it requires 50 moons to equal the volume of the Earth, then the Earth should weigh 50 times more than the moon--a nice piece of deductive reasoning for an elementary pupil. Next, sketch a seesaw on the blackboard and proceed to tell the class several childhood experiences related to seesaws. Bill Cosby's Fat Albert routine is a good one to get the kids going. \"What if Fat Albert (Hey, Hey, Hey) sat on the one end of the seesaw? Why it might take everyone in his class, piled up on the other side of the seesaw, just to lift him off the ground! You'd be calling all of your friends and they'd be jumping on the seesaw screaming and yelling, and Fat Albert would be sitting there across from you with that funny little smile on his face saying, \"Hey, Hey, Hey...\" Well, we're going to pretend that the Earth is Fat Albert, and I want to see how many moons it's going to take to lift Fat Albert-- I mean the Earth-- off the ground.\" Sketch a large Earth on one side of the seesaw and begin to draw and count moons on the opposite side of the seesaw, using voice inflections to make it appear as if you have come to the end of the exercise at each one of the numbers that the students have suggested. Ask the opinion of the class concerning each number. The first is usually mixed, while the rest up to 49 are usually no. Everyone always feels that 50 is the magic number, with many of students showing disbelief as the counting continues upward. When completed, the children are presented with an easy-to-understand visual concept of the size and weight (mass) of the moon as compared to the Earth.\n\n4. THE MOON HAS GRAVITY, but it is much less than the amount of gravity which the Earth possesses. Generally speaking, larger planets and moons have more gravity than smaller planets and moons.\n\na. GRAVITY IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE EARTH: An opinion poll generally establishes the fact that the majority of elementary students feel that the moon does not possess gravity. Note the number of gravity believers and gravity nonbelievers on the blackboard. Even if the nonbelievers win, side with the majority decision, specifically telling the children who believe in the gravity theory that they may not participate in the next question. Then address yourself to the nongravity believers and ask them to explain how the astronauts could possibly have walked on the moon if the moon did not possess any gravity. Here are a sampling of their imaginative answers:\n\n1. The astronauts had lead in their boots.\n\n2. Their spacesuits held them down.\n\n3. They wore suction cups on the underside of their boots.\n\n4. The astronauts took rope and tied it to their spaceship.\n\n5. The astronauts' boots were equipped with sharp spikes.\n\n6. They brought gravity (in cans) with them.\n\nb. PROVING THAT THE MOON HAS GRAVITY: As these statements are being made, contradict their ideas by showing pictures, if possible, of various Apollo missions and pointing out the fallacies. \"Look at those footprints. Do you see any spike marks or suction cup marks where the astronauts walked? Are the astronauts carrying any rope? Do you see any bottles of gravity lying about? Yes, the astronauts boots were weighted, but would this weigh anything if there was no gravity?\" On and on it goes until finally someone from the nonbelieving side says in a sheepish voice, \"I think the moon has a little gravity. Your response could be one of disbelief--\"WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?!! We have a person who is changing sides. Are you sure you want to do it?\" Erase a mark on the \"no\" side of the board and change it to the \"yes\" column. Several more hands will probably go up with changes of opinion. The concept that the moon has gravity has been born. Have the class applaud the several pupils who were originally aware of the gravity concept, as well as the first individual who had the courage to change his or her mind. Stress that because the moon is smaller and lighter (less massive) than Earth, it does not possess as much gravity as our planet, but that a little bit of gravity goes a long, long way. All stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, etc. have gravity. \"And what about that cow--did it really jump over the moon?\"\n\nc. MORE ON GRAVITY: The gravity concept concerning the moon is frequently so misunderstood that it can be given added emphasis with several participatory demonstrations.\n\n1) HOW FAST DO OBJECTS FALL ON THE MOON? An object, such as an eraser, dropped from a height of four feet will require an interval of one-half second before it strikes the floor. The moon's gravitational force is approximately one-sixth that of Earth's attraction, so an eraser dropped from the same height on the moon would require three seconds of time before striking the lunar surface. This can be easily demonstrated for Earth by dropping an eraser (penny, pencil, ball) from four feet and then repeating the procedure for the moon. The major exception is that for the moon, the teacher or student must hold onto the object as it \"falls\" towards the floor. To estimate three seconds, count briskly, one thousand-one, one thousand-two, one thousand-three. Do not use items which may be affected by air resistance, such as a sheet of paper, a tissue, or a balloon. These would work admirably if the Earth did not possess an atmosphere, but because it does, the descent of these objects is considerably slowed by the molecules of air which must be pushed away from the path of the falling article.\n\n2) LUNAR LYMPICS: Here is a superb way of combining astronomy, mathematics, and athletic prowess all into one of several fast-paced lessons with everybody looking like a winner. Sponsor an athletic competition with events comprised of throwing or kicking balls and calculate their lunar equivalents if the games were held on the moon. Measure the straight-line ground distance from where the event initiated (the ball was thrown) to where it landed. Multiply this number by six for the moon. If some estimate of height can be made, this number can generally be multiplied by six also. Other interesting competitions are the broad jump or the running broad jump, as well as a contest to see how high a student can jump from a standing position. In the latter case, measurements should be made from the tops of the students' heads, since they have a tendency to lift their feet in the jumping process. Beware of Frisbee and high jump contests, for they will not give accurate results when translated into the lunar environment. Air currents will affect the path of a Frisbee, and, of course, the moon has no air. In the high jump, the individual may elevate himself or herself five or six feet before clearing the bar. This does not accurately reflect the true height that the person has been lifted off the ground. It is the elevation of the center of mass, the balance point of the various parts of the body, that is of concern. The center of mass for the human body corresponds to the pelvic area which is already elevated about two and a half to three and a half feet above the ground for an adult. When a successful jump is made, the athlete clears the bar in a horizontal position, lifting his or her center of mass from the three foot level to just slightly above the height of the bar. If the bar was at the six foot level, and an athlete had his or her center of mass at three feet, the lunar equivalent would place the bar at 21 feet, not at 36 feet, as might be expected from the other examples--(3 x 6) + 3 = 21. Mrs. Ruth Erie of Ritter Elementary provided the inspiration behind this idea.\n\nFirst Lunar Olympics: With only 1/6th the gravity of Earth, you would have to divide your weight by 6 to see what you would weigh on the moon. On the moon most third graders would probably weigh between 8 and 15 pounds. Could you imagine what it would be like to play in the first lunar olympics? Drawing by NASA-public domain image\n\n3)YOUR WEIGHT ON THE MOON: This is a good exercise especially for our weight-conscious society, because again, everyone wins. Simply divide the students' weights by six to obtain an excellent approximation of their lunar equivalents. Even the Dimensions Magazine heavyweight would tip the scales at a mere 267 pounds. How much did she weigh on the Earth? It should be brought to the attention of the class that even though everyone would weigh less on the moon, physical appearances would remain unchanged.\n\n5. THE MOON SHINES BY REFLECTING SUNLIGHT INTO OUR EYES. Planets shine by the same process. Stars, on the other hand, make their own heat and light by changing (fusing) hydrogen gas into helium, deep within their interiors. DEMONSTRATING REFLECTION: In a darkened room, illuminate a child with a flashlight to demonstrate how we can observe objects by reflected light. Most children will be able to understand the concept of reflection through the analogy of a mirror. Mime a shaving routine, the combing of your hair, the application of makeup or the tying of a tie with a comment such as, \"Oh, do I look great today!\" The children will quickly \"reflect\" that you are looking at yourself in a mirror and, with ease, a definition for reflection can be quickly ascertained. The demonstration of reflection with a flashlight can be easily enhanced if the teacher, with his or her hand, traces the beam of light to the child's face and gently ricochets it to the eye of another class member. The moon, of course, is not a mirror, but the principle of light reflecting from its surface remains the same.\n\n6. THE MOON HAS NO ATMOSPHERE (AIR): The moon does not possess a sufficient amount of gravity to hold down an atmosphere.\n\na. ALL STUFFED UP--BREATHING ON THE MOON: To emphasize the difficulty of living on a world without air, have your pupils close their mouths, pinch their noses shut, and try to breathe.\n\nb. A BREATH HOLDING CONTEST: The teacher requests a male and female volunteer for the next part of the lesson without specifying the exact nature of the request. When the \"victims\" are chosen, try to weave them into a story which is told something like this. \"John and Marie were chosen by NASA, the space people, to be the first kids from Earth to fly to the moon with their parents. They boarded their rocket at Cape Canaveral in Florida last Sunday and spent the last three days in space cruising to the moon. You can imagine how excited and eager they were to play on Earth's nearest neighbor, because they had studied in school that the moon had less gravity than Earth. \"Come on, John! Let's go out and see what the moon is really like,\" Marie shouted. They both ran over to the air lock chamber. Marie took her new electric bike with her and John grabbed his ball and bat. The blue air lock door swiftly closed behind them, and Marie excitedly ran over to the exit door that would let her out onto the moon's surface. John pressed the red button and almost instantly the big gray aluminum exit door began to slide upward. As sunlight came streaming through the opening, a look of horror flashed across John's face. \"The spacesuits, Marie! We forgot to put on our spacesuits!\" Because of the lack of air, Marie could hardly hear the last few words that John was shouting. Quickly they tried to take one last deep breath, but it was difficult because most of the air had already escaped from the room. John pushed with all of his might on the switch that would close the door behind him, but he knew that it would be at least two minutes before the door could be reactivated and they could seal off the room. Would they survive their ordeal or would they be the first dead space kids on the moon?\" Of course they would not live! You haven't even told them that the sudden decompression would render our hero and heroine unconscious, and certainly sweep them out of the air lock and onto the moon's rocky surface. You must remember those horrible decompression scenes in all of the Airport movies many years ago. There was always someone being sucked screaming out a window at 30,000 feet. Such trivial matters, however, can be left for eighth grade discussions. Marie and John now hold their breath for as long as they possibly can to see if they will survive. Most of the students successfully hold their breath for about 30 seconds, although 45 seconds is not that uncommon. One student maintained his composure for just under two minutes. The teacher was in the midst of dialing 911 when he exhaled. The concept that the moon has no atmosphere is aptly portrayed through this \"life-threatening\" participatory skit. Some other related suggestions follow:\n\nc. DOES IT EVER GET WINDY ON THE MOON? Because wind is really air in motion, and because the moon has no air, it could never get windy on the moon. The instructor can inflate a balloon, then deflate the balloon in the faces of several students. As the air rushes out of the balloon, the students will be able to feel a gentle breeze against their faces.\n\nd. WHY DOES IT APPEAR THAT THE AMERICAN FLAG IS BLOWING IN THE WIND? The flags are braced by a horizontal support at the top of their poles to give them the appearance that they are rippling in the wind.\n\ne. IF AN ASTRONAUT, WHILE ON THE MOON, FILLED A BALLOON WITH HELIUM GAS, WOULD THE BALLOON RISE, FALL, OR STAY EXACTLY WHERE THE ASTRONAUT LEFT IT? Lead into this question by filling a balloon with helium from an unmarked can. Explain to the class that you have great difficulty in inflating balloons, and that the air can is of great help. When inflated and tied, hold the balloon at arm's length and leave it go. The reaction of the class to the rising balloon is worth the effort of tracking down a supplier. Next offer the balloon as a prize to the first individual who can correctly give the proper explanation to the question. The balloon containing helium gas will rise on Earth, only because its combined density (mass/volume of the balloon and helium gas) is less than the density of a comparable volume of air. You could substitute weight for density in this explanation. Since there is no air on the moon, the helium-filled balloon will simply fall to the moon's surface. An acceptable response from a student might proceed like this: \"The balloon rises on Earth because it is lighter than the air. It will fall on the moon because there is no air on the moon, so the balloon cannot be lighter than the air.\""
