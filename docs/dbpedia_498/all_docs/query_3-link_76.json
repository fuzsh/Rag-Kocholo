The tour includes a drive-by of the Vehicle Assembly Building and other operational facilities. All bus tours conclude at the Apollo/Saturn V Center, featuring an actual Saturn V moon rocket and real moon rocks along with other Apollo program artifacts and attractions.

Please allow at least two hours for the full bus tour, the visit to the Apollo/Saturn V Center and the return bus ride back to the main visitor complex.

The new Gateway: The Deep Space Launch Complex® also houses numerous genuine spacecraft.\n\nHow can I see a rocket launch?\n\nThe visitor complex offers the closest available public viewing opportunities for rocket launches lifting off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center. Learn how to see a launch and check the launch calendar to see all upcoming, confirmed launches. Please note that the launch date, time, and viewing opportunities are subject to approval by NASA or the U.S. Space Force based on safety requirements. Launch schedules can be affected by technical and mechanical issues as well as range operations and weather, either in advance or at the last minute. We do not schedule rocket launches, nor are we responsible for delays or scrubs.\n\nWhy is there a charge for admission? Aren’t these artifacts funded by U.S. taxpayers?\n\nKennedy Space Center Visitor Complex is operated for NASA by contractor Delaware North. The complex is supported entirely by revenue generated from parking, admission, food service and merchandise. The complex does not receive any government funding from U.S. tax dollars. The ongoing stewardship of priceless NASA artifacts on display at the visitor complex, as well as its ongoing operation, development and maintenance, are funded solely by visitor-generated revenue. As a Smithsonian Affiliate, the visitor complex participates in a certified outreach program that allows venues across the country to share Smithsonian collections. We have 50 objects on long-term loan from the National Air and Space Museum, including items in the Treasures Gallery at Apollo/Saturn V Center.\n\nA member of my group may need special assistance. Where can I pick up a Guest Accessibility Pass?\n\nThe Guest Accessibility Pass (GAP) helps our crewmembers know you and your family/group may require assistance with sensory sensitivities while at the visitor complex. It can be picked up at the Information center, to the left of the main entrance. While the GAP will not guarantee immediate or priority bus/attraction entrance, it will help you obtain assistance from staff should you need it.\n\nAre wheelchairs, Electric Convenience Vehicles (ECV), strollers or double strollers available for rent?\n\nWheelchairs, Electric Convenience Vehicles (ECV), strollers and double strollers are available for rent online and at the visitor complex.

The agreement includes contact information and the acknowledgement that the renter understands how to operate the vehicle. These are equipped with a chair for one person only and young children may not operate the vehicle.\n\nAre animals allowed in the visitor complex?\n\nAll animals that qualify as service animals are welcome at the visitor complex. A service animal is defined as a dog or miniature horse that is trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. Guests who use service animals must retain control of their animals at all times. View the park map during your visit for dog walking locations throughout the park. For guests with pets, the visitor complex offers a free on-site, air-conditioned pet kennel. Learn more about the pet kennel before your visit.\n\nWhat does a “Phase 2” for inclement weather mean?\n\nYou may hear the visitor complex call a “Phase 2,” meaning lightning is present or imminent in the immediate area. In the event of inclement weather at the visitor complex, including cloud to ground lightning, all guests will be asked to seek shelter or remain indoors until the storm passes. For your safety, please respect all weather warnings and the recommendations of our associates while touring the visitor complex.\n\nWhat is the best way to dress for a visit to Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex?\n\nKennedy Space Center Visitor Complex is a family-friendly environment. Proper attire, which includes a shirt and shoes, is required for admittance. We ask that guests refrain from the following attire:\n\nClothing with objectionable material, including obscene language or graphics\n\nClothing that exposes tattoos depicting obscene or objectionable content\n\nClothing that exposes inappropriate portions of skin or areas of the body\n\nMasks worn by any age, unless for medical purposes\n\nGuests who do not adhere to these guidelines or cannot modify their clothing may be refused entry into and/or removed from Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n\nWhat will the new admission options for Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex be?\n\nWith the addition of several new attractions over the past few years, more and more guests schedule two days for their visit.

Also, two-day passes will be available for $89 per adult and $79 per child. Single-day admission will be $75 per adult, $65 per child.
