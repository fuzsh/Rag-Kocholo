One thing you could do is to turn Sync Library off and then turn it back on.\n\nCan you remove one of the songs from the Library and then add it back to the Library again?\n\nDelete music, movies, and TV shows from your device\n\n\"On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\n\nGo to Settings > Music.\n\nTurn on Sync Library. \"\n\nTurn on Sync Library with Apple Music\n\n\"If a song isn't available in Apple Music\n\nSome songs or albums might be grayed out because they're not currently available in Apple Music. Here are some reasons why:\n\nArtists and content providers might release some songs from an album in advance, but not all of them. If you add the entire album to your library, the songs will become available as they're released.\n\nArtists and content providers might change or remove music from the Apple Music catalog. Search Apple Music to see if that song is available under a different name or file. If it is, add the song to your library so it's no longer grayed out.\n\nThe song might not be available in your country or region and will appear in gray text when you search for it in Apple Music.\n\nIf an explicit song is grayed out, you might have restrictions turned on for your device. You can use Screen Time on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or Screen Time on your Mac to turn off restrictions. You can also add the clean version from Apple Music to your library.\"\n\nIf your songs are grayed out\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: mario49\n\nUser level: Community Specialist\n\nHey Gonnaburndishousedown,\n\nIf we understand correctly, you are trying to play a song, but you received a message saying that it was not available in your region.\n\nWere these songs previously able to be played?\n\nHave you changed regions in the past?\n\nWas the other Apple ID associated with a different region?\n\nAre you part of a family group?\n\nChange your Apple ID country or region\n\nThank you for using Apple Support Communities. Have a good one.\n\nLink"
