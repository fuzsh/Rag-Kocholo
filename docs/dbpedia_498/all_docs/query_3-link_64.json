With a drop of 215 feet (66 meters), it's 33 feet higher than Niagara Falls, but with a much smaller volume of water.\n\nDon't miss the view of Taughannock Falls from the Falls Overlook - the gorge creates a natural amphitheater that holds in the dense spray that rises from the bottom of the falls and shrouds the lower part of the cataract in mist—it will inspire a hike down the Gorge Trail and provide the setting for the perfect photo of the falls.\n\nIf you want to experience the shore of Cayuga Lake without being surrounded by bathing suits, head to the quieter shore line at our North Point area. There is a lovely view of the lake from there.\n\nIn the spring, check out the wildflowers that bloom along the Gorge Trail. Flowers thrive there because deer rarely wander into the gorge.\n\nThe hemlock forests surrounding the Taughannock ravine are mixed with other hardwood trees, including sugar maple, white oak, and striped maple. It's also home to many species of woodland birds.\n\nThe shoreline at Taughannock Falls State Park drops off sharply, making this area a great congregating space for many different species of Lake Cayuga fish. Lake trout, yellow perch, and landlocked Atlantic salmon are all common species.\n\nWhat will you see? Plan your visit today!\n\nLook and listen for these birds at our Park:\n\nEveryone is a Steward: Be a Taughannock Falls State Park Hero!\n\nKnow the rules and concerns for the area you'll be visiting.\n\nLeave all natural objects as you find them.\n\nRespect other visitors and their experience. Avoid excessive noise.\n\nShare the trail. Keep to the right except to pass. When in doubt, give the other user the right of way. Warn people when you are planning to pass.\n\nRespect wildlife and observe from a distance.\n\nProtect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash securely.\n\nAvoid using trails when they are excessively muddy.\n\nDo not litter.\n\nFor more information, please read our Trail Tips!\n\nWhen you enter or leave Cayuga Lake:\n\nClean and remove all visible plants, animals, fish and mud from boat, trailer and other equipment and dispose of it in a suitable trash container or on dry land.\n\nDrain water from bilge, live wells, ballast tanks, and any other locations with water before leaving the launch. Disinfect when possible.\n\nDry your boat, trailer and all equipment completely. At least 5 days of drying time is recommended. Drying times may vary depending on weather and material.\n\nAsk a Naturalist!\n\nQ: Where have all the rocks gone that were once in the gorge?\n\nA: They have become Taughannock Point, the eastern part of the park where the park office, swimming area, concession stand and playground is. As the gorge erodes the park gets bigger!\n\nQ: Why does the streambed look remind me of the surface of the moon?\n\nA: The streambed at Taughannock is made up of limestone. The limestone is susceptible to chemical erosion so if the water becomes acidic (like when rain water puddles dry) the acid reacts with the stone and creates solution pits and ripples in the rock.\n\nQ: After the water from Taughannock creek enters Cayuga Lake where does it go?\n\nA: The water in the lake flows north into the Seneca River, then the Oswego River, then the eastern end of Lake Ontario, into the St. Lawrence River and into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nQ: Are there any invasive species in Taughannock Falls?\n\nA: Unfortunately, yes. Some of the hemlock forest in the park has been infested with Hemlock Wooley Adelgid, an invasive insect which is deadly to hemlock trees. Parks' specialists are keeping a close eye on our forests to limit the spread of this exotic species.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nGeography:\n\nAt 38.2 miles long, Cayuga Lake is the longest of the Finger Lakes.\n\nCayuga Lake goes down to about 435 feet at its deepest point. It's one of the deepest lakes in North America and its bottom is 35 feet below sea level.\n\nThe arresting landscape of lakes, hills, gorges and waterfalls in Taughannock Falls State Park and throughout the Finger Lakes region was formed by Devonian Era rocks, which accumulated in a warm shallow sea over 360 million years ago, as well as by the action of massive ice sheets that shaped the rocks over the last 2 million years. The Finger Lakes themselves, long, narrow parallel bodies of water, were gouged out by the movement of glaciers in the Ice Age, between 2 million and ten thousand years ago. The flowing water continues to shape and cut the gorges that dominate this region.\n\nHistory:\n\nIn 1879, a 10-foot tall, petrified \"man\" was unearthed at the former Taughannock House Hotel site. To learn more about \"Taughannock Man\" listen to stop 11 on the Taughannock cell phone tour, 607-216-6062.\n\nIn the 19th century scholar William H. Bogart determined Taughannock, or Taghanic, to mean \"the great fall in the woods\" in a combination of Algonquin and Iroquois languages. However, D.H. Hamilton, another scholar of the same era, contended that word was of Delaware origin. In Hamilton's version, Taughannock was the title of a young Delaware chief who defied the more-powerful Iroquois and was defeated at the falls.\n\nThe Finger Lakes Environmental Education Department offers scheduled gorge tours and educational programs at Buttermilk Falls, Robert H. Treman, Taughannock Falls and Watkins Glen State Parks. All park programs are free and open to the public, no registration required, although a parking fee may be charged.\n\nIf you have a group (10 or more) that is interested in scheduling its own gorge tour or other educational program at a Finger Lakes State Park, please email regional Environmental Educator Elijah Kruger (Elijah.Kruger@parks.ny.gov). Please include the name of your group, number of participants, age or grade level of participants, requested program topic(s), and requested program date(s) in your email.\n\nThe Finger Lakes Story\n\nSparkling lakes, breathtaking waterfalls and rolling pastoral land dominate the landscape of the Finger Lakes Region. Over thousands of years, gigantic glaciers and coursing streams have carved this landscape. The most recent glacier moved through shallow river valleys leaving in its place deep, steep-sided troughs. When the glaciers receded north 10,000 years ago, water filled these new troughs, creating the 11 Finger Lakes. Since that time water has flowed down glacially steepened hillsides carrying debris that cut away at soft sedimentary rock to form our beautiful and unique gorges.\n\nGorge Tours provide information and insights about individual park history, ecology, gorge formation and geology. Tours last approximately one and one half hours.\n\nThe Taughannock Falls Gorge Tour - Experience a spectacular stone amphitheater and 215-foot vertical waterfall at the end of the wide and wooded ¾-mile gorge trail. The trail is relatively flat making it a very accessible and beautiful hike for all ages.\n\nEducational Programs are offered about a variety of topics.\n\nBirds ● Fossils ● Reptiles and Amphibians ● Insects ● Invasive Species ● Mammals ● Trees● Park Histories ● Animal Tracks ● Wilderness Survival\n\nIf don't see a specific topic please call or email us with your questions."
