        "text": "The Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969 is woven into the lives of everyone through its technological leaps, expanded understanding of the universe and its inspirational value.\n\nIt's humanity's story. It's a story Montanans help tell.\n\nMontana is home to the only woman who was in the flight room for the Apollo 11 mission. That's JoAnn Morgan of Bigfork. The oldest living astronaut, Frank Borman, 91, of Apollo 8, ranches near Hysham. Helena's Dava Newman helped set a course for Mars as NASA's deputy administrator. In March, Livingston astronaut Christina Koch followed Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and generations of astronauts into space.\n\nKoch, a Michigan native who most recently resided in Livingston according to her NASA bio, launched into space on the Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan at around 1:15 p.m., according to a NASA press release.\n\nThe space program also shaped the lives of Missoula's Bryan von Lossberg, who helped put the first rover on Mars, and Glasgow's Phil Weber, whose work will lead to a woman walking on the moon.\n\nGene Marianetti of Black Eagle brought astronauts to Great Falls and had a front-row seat to the Apollo missions. Physicist Jennifer Fowler's work in Missoula aims to help NASA make accurate Martian weather predictions.\n\nThey help us tell the story of what the moon landing means 50 years later.\n\n***\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\"\n\n— The first man to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong tells NASA's Mission Control that the Eagle landing module reached the moon's surface\n\nMAKING CONNECTIONS: Fifty years ago, Gene Marianetti of Black Eagle was in Cocoa Beach lining up porta-potties, security and drinking water for the crowd anticipated for the launch of Apollo 11.\n\nMarianetti, a Great Falls High School graduate and the author of the new book “Astronauts On Parade,” worked in NASA’s public affairs office from 1967 to 1994.\n\nHe helped organize the guest list for the Apollo 11 launch, aiming for a broad cross-section of the country. NASA bused about 12,000 people to the launch pad to watch the liftoff and issued another 6,000 or so car passes, with as many as a million people gathered outside the space center to watch.\n\nThe launch that fateful day Apollo 11 left for the moon was Marianetti’s third liftoff after Apollo 4 and 10.\n\n“You see the ignition of the main engines, and then it seems like it just sits there. There’s anticipation. It’s building up thrust – 7 ½ million pounds of thrust. Then the clamps release. It lifts off so slowly. You get the sound like a deafening shock wave when it’s already 400 feet up. It’s a beautiful sight, hard to describe,” he said. “Twelve-million parts and everything worked perfectly. But we’re doing this for the first time. Everything else was in simulations. They’d never actually done this.”\n\nThe crowd was in awe, Marianetti said. They clapped. They whistled. They cheered. NASA set up bleachers, but nearly everybody stood in that incredible moment until the last of the exhaust faded in the sky.\n\nWhen the astronauts returned to earth and left quarantine (no one knew if they’d bring back a crazy moon virus), Marianetti traveled with them to ticker-tape parades in New York City and Chicago and a state dinner – the first held outside D.C. – in Los Angeles. All in one day.\n\n“To see that many people lining the streets and throwing confetti was amazing,” he said. “I was just a cog in the machinery, but I felt good. The responsibility was on our shoulders, but we had a good team.”\n\nMarianetti also helped organize Armstrong’s visit to the astronaut’s hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio.\n\n“I was very close to him. We had a good relationship, professional and personal. He was a humble individual and thought the crew got too much attention. He always emphasized it was a team effort,” Marianetti said.\n\nNASA was “success-oriented” and quickly moved on to the next mission, even as the country basked in the glory of the moon landing.\n\n“We knew we were going to land on the moon. We did,” he said. “By the time you launched, you were on to the next step.”\n\nApollo 12 was in November and then Apollo 13 soon after.\n\nBut amid the celebration of Apollo 11, Marianetti's mind turned back to his first days with the agency.\n\nMarianetti was ready for a change after six years working for KMON and KRTV, so he took an internship with Sen. Lee Metcalf in Washington, D.C. After his year and a bit extra were up, Marianetti saw NASA was looking for a person with his skills. His job would be to get astronauts on the road speaking with people.\n\nNASA still was recovering from the 1967 Apollo 1 fire, which killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee on the launch pad at Cape Kennedy, Fla.\n\n“With the space race, we started behind, as we did in World War II,” he said. “The Soviets were way ahead, and we had a lot of catch up to do.”\n\nIn the year before the moon landing, the country suffered the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. The Tet Offensive was on in Vietnam, and 16,592 American soldiers died in the Vietnam War that year. Rioting broke out at the Chicago Democratic Convention. The Soviet Union crushed the Prague Spring. North Korea captured the USS Pueblo and its crew of 83.\n\nBut then came Christmas Eve 1968.\n\nOn that day, Apollo 8 orbited the moon 10 times with Jim Lovell, Bill Anders and Frank Borman aboard. They were the first people to orbit the moon and read for the largest television audience to the date from the Book of Genesis, signing off: “And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas – and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth.”\n\n***\n\n​​​​​​“I just cannot tell you how proud we all are of what you have done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of their lives.\"\n\n— President Richard Nixon congratulates the astronauts of Apollo 11\n\nThe headlines in March 1973 help set the scene.\n\n\"US military folds colors in 'Nam\" as the Vietnam War ended, \"Hotel has 4th arson attempt\" as a teenager set a blaze in an elevator shaft, \"Indian negotiations fizzle\" at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, \"67 POWs free today\" in Hanoi, North Vietnam and \"McCord gives senators Watergate information.\"\n\nBut at the center of the dour page in the Tribune archive was a picture of Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan.\n\n\"Do I look like I landed on the moon?\" the astronaut asked a child.\n\n\"No,\" the boy said.\n\n\"It must be the hat that makes me look different,\" he quipped, in a cowboy hat.\n\nApollo 17 was the last Apollo mission, and the last man to walk on the moon, Cernan was in Great Falls thanks to Marianetti.\n\nMarianetti called up the owner of the Heritage Inn and said, “I have a free night. Would you like to have the astronauts in Great Falls?”\n\nUh, yes!\n\nSo the goodwill tour looped into Great Falls. The astronauts attended a dinner at the Meadow Lark Country Club, and their wives went to Marianetti’s mom's house for a homemade Italian dinner.\n\nCrowds greeted the astronauts. What a thing to shake the hand of someone who has walked on the moon.\n\n“Getting to the moon is not an easy thing,” Marianetti said. “It was a great period in American history. I hope we never forget it, and I was proud to be part of the moon landing.”\n\n***\n\n“We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.\"\n\n— Astronaut Neil Armstrong broadcasts from space, July 23, 1963\n\nROCKET MAN: With their parents, six-year-old Phil Weber and his eight siblings gathered around a black-and-white television in their farmhouse south of Glasgow to watch the moon landing.\n\n“It was amazing. It almost didn't seem real,” he said. “I was all about rockets after that, figuring out how to use firecrackers to launch soup cans, then building model rockets – trying for bigger and better.”\n\nAfter graduating from Glasgow High School, Weber went to Montana State University to study mechanical engineering. His senior year he took a fateful spring break trip to Cocoa Beach, Fla., for some fun in the sun in 1985.\n\n“It was beyond a fantasy when I was a freshman in Bozeman to work at NASA on the launch pad,” he said. “Most of my classmates got jobs with Boeing or oil companies.”\n\nWeber saw an add in the newspaper that a NASA contractor needed 300 engineers. He interviewed in the jeans he’d brought with him on vacation. By the end of the day, he had five job offers. That’s how hungry they were for engineers – even those who had to go back to Montana for one last quarter of college.\n\n“Two weeks after graduation, I walked into the vehicle assembly building and started my job,” he said. “It was a dream but so impossible.”\n\nThis is Weber’s 32nd year with NASA (after two years with the contractor). He's the senior technical integration manager for the Exploration Ground Systems Program at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\n***\n\n\"Here Men From The Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace For All Mankind.\"\n\n— The inscription on a plaque left behind on the surface of the Moon\n\nEven as NASA celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, the agency focused on Artemis and returning astronauts to the moon.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo. It’s also the name of the mission that Weber is working on now.\n\n“The moon is really a great proving ground. There’s a lot of science we can do on the moon,” Weber said. “It’s inhospitable. There is no atmosphere, but there is a lot of ice on the moon’s south pole. We could create a permanent base at the south pole and have access to this ice water to convert into rocket fuel and oxygen. This would be to create a sustainable program, to stay.”\n\nIt’s a three-day trip to the moon, compared with the nine and a half months it takes to get to Mars. Weber likened it to testing out camping gear with a quick trip to the nearest campground for some car camping before trekking into the wilderness.\n\n“It’s a dress rehearsal for the deeper space exploration we have in our future,” he said.\n\nWhile the Apollo mission was directly tied to the Cold War and US-Soviet rivalry, Artemis shows how far we’ve come.\n\nMore: NASA’s Artemis mission will put first woman, next man on the moon\n\n“We’ll go back to the moon with international partners and private companies, which brings more talent and resources so it’s more likely to be successful for a long-term mission,” Weber said.\n\n“We’re tasked by the president to put the first woman and the next man on the moon in five years,” he said. “We’re moving swiftly to execute that, to have people back on the moon’s surface in 2024. To do that, there will be an international partnership.”\n\nThe international partnership still means high-tech jobs in the United States creating new technology we’ll someday wonder how we ever lived without.\n\n“The cellphone in your hand has its roots in the technology needed for the space program. That drove innovation,” Weber said. “NASA gets credit for Velcro and Tang, but that’s almost a joke when you think of all the spin-off technologies from the space program.”\n\nWith NASA’s big, bold projects, people think they have a massive budget. It’s $20 billion a year, not even half a penny of every dollar in the federal budget.\n\nWeber recently was in France, where he saw people in NASA T-shirts.\n\n“It’s a cultural icon,” he said. “People all over the world are into it.”\n\n“I’m excited about us launching human beings from U.S. soil again. It’s going to happen likely within the next year,” he said. “We’re really getting close to getting the first launch put together.”\n\nJust think about it. This former Glasgow rocket geek is working toward sending astronauts farther into space than any human being has ever been with the orbit they’ll be on. At 18,000 miles an hour.\n\n“Having a permanent presence at the moon’s south pole is a huge thing,” he said. “I liken it to building a cathedral. You know people will continue to build after you’re gone. It won’t be finished for generations, but you’re getting it underway and laying the foundation. The goal is to send people throughout the whole solar system.”\n\n***\n\n\"I got to help put 12 people to walk on that moon.”\n\n— JoAnn Morgan of Bigfork, Apollo 11 instrumentation controller\n\nWEATHER FORECASTING ON MARS: Jennifer Fowler, a UM/MSU physicist based in Missoula, was born a few years after the moon landing so it was easy for her to take for granted that of course we got to the moon. Of course it worked out. Of course the space program was a grand American achievement.\n\nA recent documentary brought home to her how easily the story could have gone differently, how complex the process was. Congress considered spiking the program after the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Nixon had a speech ready for if the mission killed the astronauts on the moon.\n\n“The space program was always around, just a part of life – and maybe that’s the legacy when you grow up after the moon landing,” she said. “Everybody around the world knows what NASA is. They see the symbol and know.”\n\nMost girls fall out of science as an eighth grader, but that’s when Fowler started diving deeper.\n\n“I didn’t have women I was following into this field, but I had great male mentors who didn’t tell me I couldn’t do it,” she said. “Women were training for the space program. They were lighter. They did better in the isolation chamber. But they were ultimately not considered seriously. The Russians were more open to women in their space program.”\n\nThe future of NASA is more diverse than its past. Now girls can grow up seeing the female face of space exploration.\n\n“NASA has made great strides. Half the astronaut class is female. The more diversity you have, the better you are at meeting your goals. The more creative you are,” Fowler said. “We can do even better than we’ve done with a mix of genders and races.”\n\nFowler is just back from Chile and a NASA project studying waves in the atmosphere. She launched weather balloons to try to measure waves caused by a solar eclipse.\n\nThe waves go from the thermosphere 620 miles up to the atmosphere at the surface. Understanding them is fundamental to accurate weather and climate forecasting.\n\nShe focused on the level of the atmosphere at about 21 miles up.\n\n“These waves are going in every direction all the time,” she said. “It makes it really difficult to model.”\n\nThe waves also happen on Mars and certain moons of Jupiter, and no doubt other places, too.\n\n“They’re an extraterrestrial phenomenon, and we don’t even have them fully understood on earth,” she said. “Forecasting the weather on Mars is important for future space missions.”\n\nLike the mission to the moon, the mission to Mars can be a great scientific leap and something that unites the country.\n\n“The mission to Mars is one of the most exciting things to think about,” Fowler said. “This is a great reminder that when we come together as a country and focus on something that’s not politics but science, we can do great things. It’s teams of people accomplishing the impossible. We have great things to strive for.”\n\n***\n\n“We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\"\n\n— President John F. Kennedy at Rice University, September 12, 1962\n\nBryan von Lossberg, Missoula’s city council president, was a babe in arms in 1969. His parents pointed up at the moon and told him people were walking around on it.\n\n“I apparently mumbled something about broke-y moon. They repeated that phrase endlessly, so if there was a hashtag in our family, that would be it,” he said.\n\nAs a boy, von Lossberg had NASA wallpaper in his bedroom showing the moon landing sequence. It was no surprise when he ended up working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory outside Pasadena.\n\nVon Lossberg went to work for NASA around the time the agency was the butt of jokes for many a late-night talk after the newly launched $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope sent back to earth blurry pictures because the primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape.\n\nJet Propulsion Lab engineers went to work on a fix. Von Lossberg’s role was in the design group, updating the optical schematics. He found a flaw in a piece of hardware called a baffle and designed a new titanium baffle for the new camera system. And then that piece, along with the rest of the upgrade, blasted into space and is helping send back the gorgeous/fascinating Hubble images we all know.\n\n\"When I was watching the shuttle mission that took up the camera, I was proud of my little titanium piece,” he said. “As a young engineer straight out of college, I got to design this titanium baffle.”\n\nThat’s fitting. The average age of NASA engineers during the Apollo 11 mission was 28 (now it’s nearly 50). Bold young engineers didn’t have the sense to be cowed by the challenge.\n\nFor the Mars Pathfinder mission, von Lossberg was a cognizant engineer, like a project manager, for a particular assembly within the mission focusing on the inflated structural assembly. They couldn’t have come up with a more boring name for it, but the engineering was actually really cool.\n\nHe designed something that is ON MARS.\n\n“Mind-blowing,” he said.\n\nIn fact, in the Matt Damon film “The Martian,” the piece is prominently visible in the scene in which Damon, stranded on Mars, unearths the long-dead Pathfinder and brings it back to his base, where he uses it to re-establish communication with Earth. Von Lossberg’s piece is the big white structure with the JPL logo and the American flag.\n\n“The peak existence of my life was helping save Matt Damon’s life in a movie in the future,” he said.\n\nThe space program wasn’t generating a lot of excitement in the early 1990s. The Cold War was over. We’d long since planted a flag on the moon. But the Hubble repair mission – and the excitement its newly crisp photos generated – was a great prologue to the rest of his space career.\n\n“Hubble was a laughing stock, a national embarrassment,” he said. “Restoring the imaging capacity – there’s no way to overstate how critical that was to NASA’s reputation.”\n\nWith the Hubble repaired, the next big achievement in von Lossberg’s career was working on the Mars Pathfinder, which landed on the red planet in 1997.\n\n“The whole team recognized it was a radical concept. NASA had a new administrator who brought in an era of ‘Better, faster, cheaper,” he said. “Pathfinder was in that mold.”\n\nInstead of the complex and expensive controlled landings on Mars, Pathfinder would rocket to Mars and slow down with a parachute, a rocket firing and giant airbags. Instead of an exact landing, it would bounce around on the surface before deploying a rover about the size of a laptop computer for 90 days of research.\n\n“People would look at you like, are you serious? Or they were excited because it’s the craziest landing they’d ever heard of,” he said. “It was an insane idea.\n\n“And it worked – thank God.”\n\nThe methodology has evolved but the Pathfinder proved the possibility of getting to Mars and landing useful science equipment in a far less expensive fashion.\n\n“One of the things that’s fascinating when you look back at those leaps and breakthroughs – and there’s great stuff from the Apollo program to today – there’s a sense in the public that when we undertake these ambitious missions we know how to get from A to Z if Z is landing on the moon. It’s actually a lot more inspiring. Any time the country has set these ambitious goals, like Kennedy and the moon landing, we probably know how to get from A to C. Then then best and brightest minds in the country figure out the rest of the steps. Necessity is the mother of invention. You have to take a leap of faith that you’ll be able to solve the problems in the course of doing the mission.”\n\nThat was the spirit that animated the Pathfinder mission, too. When it came time to test the Kevlar airbags, engineers designed a giant upside-down slingshot to test it. The guy brought into a meeting a VCR tape of the test.\n\n“They shot this thing straight down onto a plywood surface with ‘representative Martian rocks,” he said. “The very first portion of the first airbag that touched the first rock was a catastrophic failure. Ripped a giant hole.”\n\nThat moment could have been the end of the mission — the idea written off as a failure.\n\n“I was sitting there speechless,” he said. “And the rest of the meeting was a phenomenal brainstorming session. What came out of that meeting flew on the mission.”\n\nBill Layman, a senior engineer, seemed to be almost excited by the failure, treating it as an opportunity to get creative.\n\n“Every mission has several of those moments,” von Lossberg said. “If you can embrace failure, you can really open the door to incredible innovation.”\n\nLayman had zero ego. You’d walk into his office with a problem and leave with a solution you thought was your own.\n\n“We’re often faced in life with the choice between setting goals we know are attainable versus setting targets we don’t know if we can reach,” von Lossberg said. “It’s critically important we don’t limit ourselves. If we only set goals we know are attainable, we’re shortchanging ourselves and future generations.”\n\nHe carried that lesson into parenting, teaching his daughter making mistakes is OK.\n\n“It works at the individual level and collectively to humanity in general,” he said. “You don’t experience opportunities to fail if you don’t stretch yourself beyond what you know is doable.\n\n“We face monumental challenges today on a number of fronts,” he said. “Look back to the Apollo mission. Do we know how we’re going to solve this? No, we don’t know every step of the way, but we need to give ourselves the opportunity to have these breakthroughs.”\n\nCelebrate the moment: The Montana Historical Society is hosting a screening of the Smithsonian Channel's \"The Day We Walked on the Moon\" on the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. It’s a story that ranges from the deeply personal to the grand and historic, an in-depth look at one of the most important twenty-four-hour periods in history.\n\nScreenings are 11:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 20 and will be preceded by a slideshow about Montana in 1969 by MHS historian Christine Brown. Moon rocks brought back to earth by Apollo 11 will be on display."
