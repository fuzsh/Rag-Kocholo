They're with BMG now.\n\nPost by No Brake$ on\n\nThis is a bad song and I can’t understand why anyone would invest in sending something like this to radio. The lyrics are awful.\n\nPost by narp on\n\nThis either sounds like something that spends one week on the alt chart and falls off or the alt crossover that gets sent to pop and spends way too much time on the chart and at #1. That’s how generic it is.\n\nPost by maine on\n\n\"Now's the Time\" was really solid; I don't know why they didn't sent that. It sounded very radio friendly.\n\nThis is really meh, as most of their material has been for the past couple of years. Shame because I really liked them at a point, but they kinda lost me with this past album.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nthe SiriusXM jam band station is playing this for whatever reason\n\nPost by No Brake$ on\n\nMoon Taxi has had some decent songs, they are based out of Nashville and pretty much AAA Pop. There is no way even the band thinks this song is good, for them, this is complete garbage.\n\nPost by thirddegree50123 on\n\nNo reason for this not to be huge lol\n\nPost by Doc Indie Party Rock on\n\nThis song made me laugh, but not in a good way.\n\nPost by American Idiot on\n\nBesides that background noise that I don't even know what it is, but I feel like Walk The Moon used it in \"One Foot,\" I enjoyed that song. That chorus is damn catchy and reminds me something from like Vance Joy or The Head and the Heart.\n\nPost by maine on\n\nFor such a poppy song, the lack of rhymes stick out like a sore thumb to me. Normally this doesn't bother me, but on this one it does.\n\nI don't think this is that bad, but it's a far cry from a solid chunk of their discography.\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 50 on AAA:\n\n65 49 MOON TAXI Hometown Heroes 82 49 33 0.051\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 40 on AAA:\n\n42 39 MOON TAXI Hometown Heroes 118 92 26 0.106\n\nThis is lame.\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 30 on AAA:\n\n39 30 MOON TAXI Hometown Heroes 160 118 42 0.101"
