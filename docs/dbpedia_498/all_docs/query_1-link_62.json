        "text": "If you haven't caught on, I am a travel-addicted, coffee drinking, plane catching junkie with a love for planning and creating new experiences. My personality is EXTRRA sarcastic, I speak directly & I'm a sucker for a good partayyy!\n\nI was born & raised in Northern California, called the bay area home for over 20 years and have planted my roots in the Napa Valley. I'm a city girl living in a small (ish)town, & I never say no to an adventure. If i'm being honest, nothing gets me more excited than experiencing something or somewhere new (Hence why i'm literally down to travel anywhere to help you plan your wedding!!)\n\nI'm 29 years young & and living my very best life with my locked in travel partner//husband & our 2 love bug pups... dottie & scout! As of May 2023, I planed my first destination wedding, that just so happened to be my own!\n\nHometown Gatherings was created to be a safe space for couples when seeking guidance after getting engaged. It's important to me, when working with my forever new friends (that’s you!), that they feel 110% comfortable, confident & at ease walking into their wedding week, during the big day & feel over the moon pumped after the wedding!\n\nI'm here to help you navigate through the messy, fun & real wedding planning experiences. I'm not joking when I say, this is about to be your best adventure yet & I can't wait to be a part of your wedding planning journey! With me by your side I promise you will feel calmer than you have ever felt.. & thats saying a lot!\n\nHiring Marissa As Our Planner Was One Of The Best Decisions We Made For Our Wedding! We Worked With Marissa In The Last Months Leading Up To Our Wedding Weekend To Bring Her Up To Speed On All Our Plans And Help Firm Up Final Details. We Were So Impressed With How Marissa Seamlessly Integrated With Both The Staff At Our Venue And Worked With Each Of The Vendors. She Is A Natural And Confident Leader, But Also Quickly Jumped In To Assist Whenever Someone Across The Wedding Team Needed An Extra Hand. Overall, She Is Fantastic.\n\nMarissa Was The Best To Work With! I Hired Her As A Month Before/ Day Of Coordinator For My Wedding In San Diego & It Was The Best Decision!She Was Accessible And Easy To Work With. She Is The Reason I Was Able To Genuinely Enjoy My Day & Not Stress About Anything!!! She Made My Vision Come To Life And Everything Went Better Than I Could Have Imagined. She Made Sure Vendors Were Where They Needed To Be And When They Needed To Be there. If You Are Looking To Hire Someone I Couldn’t Think Of Anyone Better Than hometown gatherings!\n\nMarissa Is Amazing. An Absolute Pro Start To Finish. Our Wedding Was Perfect And Had The Perfect Flow. Some Minor Changes Happened During The Event And Marissa Set It All Into Place Seamlessly. She Was Such A Great Guide. We've Never Done This Before And We Needed Someone Add Clarity To Decisions & She Was There For all of it. We Hired Her For The 3 Months Plus Day Off And It Was A Key Investment. No Way We Could Have Done It Without Her!! She Was Instrumental In Making The Best Day Of Our Lives Come True."
