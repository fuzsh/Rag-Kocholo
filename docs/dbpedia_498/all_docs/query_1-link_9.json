        "text": "Thanks to the ten's of thousands of visitors who came to Wapakoneta on Monday, April 8, 2024 to experience the total solar eclipse!\n\nThe weather was perfect and the grounds of the Armstrong Air & Space Museum was teeming with folks and their telescopes, cameras and eclipse glasses to take part in that incredible celestial phenomenon. Visitors also spent time in downtown Wapakoneta and enjoyed the Ring of Fire Festival at the Auglaize County Fairgrounds.\n\nIt’s meant to surprise, delight and spark conversation and the new Giant Roadside Mural: Tribute to Apollo 11, in west central Ohio, certainly does all that and MORE! ​\n\nEach year famous roadside muralist, artist John Cerney chooses a topic or theme and donates one of his works of art to a community or organization. Last year’s 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing got him thinking about that feat and the man who took those first steps onto the moon. Cerney of Salinas, California, contacted the Wapakoneta Chamber of Commerce early in 2020 and offered to donate one of his murals if the right location could be found. The local group, First on the Moon, took on the project and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n​Cerney painted the various components in his studio in California and then traveled cross-country to deliver and construct it on site. The mural is located about three miles east of Wapakoneta on US 33. It is viewable from the westbound lane. Cerney’s giant works of art can be found in 28 states and Canada, this is Ohio’s first Cerney mural and it is a great excuse for a fun road trip.​\n\nAfter checking out the giant roadside mural, you will want\n\nto continue into Wapakoneta and visit the Armstrong\n\nAir & Space Museum. While there, be sure to take a selfie\n\nwith the two bronze statues of Neil Armstrong. One\n\ndepicts him as a youth dreaming of someday becoming\n\na pilot and the other as an adult in flight gear, having\n\naccomplished that long held dream.​\n\nComplete your road trip with a visit to historic downtown\n\nWapakoneta. It is filed with wonderful, unique shops\n\nand great places to grab a snack or a meal. There is a\n\nthird bronze statue of Neil Armstrong, downtown. This one depicts him waving to the crowds as he did during a huge Homecoming Parade following his trip to the moon. For more information on these and other fun thingsto see and do in west central Ohio check out SeeMore.org\n\nFirst on the Moon, inc. has been busy working on projects that not only beautify the community but also enhance the link between Wapakoneta and its heritage as the home town of Neil Armstrong, first man on the moon.​\n\nWorking with Riverside Art Center and Wapakoneta City Council to bring public art to the historic downtown area, two street side utility boxes now showcase the artwork of Ayla Webb & Jennifer Sowders. These boxes are located at the intersection of Auglaize and Hamilton Streets. Sowders and Webb won their divisions in the “50 years of Space” art contest that took place at Riverside Art Center in 2019 during the 50th anniversary celebration of theApollo11 mission to the moon.​\n\nA third utility box, located on Willipie Street near Auglaize Street, is now sporting a vibrant tie-dye rendition of the First on the Moon logo on its street side. The backside of eye-catching design features five fun facts about Neil Armstrong and Wapakoneta.\n\nA special thank you to IC Signs for their designand workmanship on these challenging projects.\n\nOn February 29, 2020 more than 300 “Astronauts” gathered in Wapakoneta for the One Giant Leap Day Celebration. First on the Moon, Inc. put out the call for people to come to Wapakoneta, costumed as astronauts, to help set a new Guinness Book World Record for the “Most People Dressed like an Astronaut in One Location”.​There were strict criteria for the attempt and the effort had to be recorded and reported including sworn testimony from local judges. The current record to beat was 257, more than 300 showed up in Wapakoneta on that frigid February day. They came from all over Ohio and eastern Indiana. We believe that our attempt was successful and a new record was set. The application is still in the hands of the World Record Book team and we are awaiting their determination on our apparent victory."
