        "text": "Upcoming Programs\n\nWe do programs on Friday and Saturday nights from March through November, weather permitting.\n\nBecause we have limited space for cars, free parking passes are required on program nights.\n\nSpace is infinite, our parking area is not.\n\nhttps://registration.jgap.org/\n\nIf the date you wish to go is marked “full” when you go to reserve a spot, check at the bottom of the list. There we will post a limited number of ADDITIONAL PASSES a few days before the program starts to allow “last minute” folks a chance to attend. Once those are gone, we are fully booked.\n\n(The JGAP grounds are open for individual stargazing on non-program nights. Please feel free to come on in. Parking passes are not required. You may bring chairs, telescopes, cameras and tripods if you wish.)\n\nAugust 9-10 The Perseid Preview. Come learn about meteor showers and get info about the peak of the Perseid Meteor Shower, which peaks during the morning hours the following Monday. Also, a rugged crescent moon. Program starts 8:45 PM\n\nAugust 16-17 My favorite Crater, Gassendi. The not-quite-full moon reveals one of its most compelling craters, which tells the story of the Moon’s History. Program starts 8:30 PM\n\nAugust 23-24 More marvelous Milky Way! Cygnus the Swan, Aquila the Eagle, Scutum the Shield, and Sagittarius the Archer are arcing high overhead as soon as it is dark tonight. Program Starts at 8:15 PM\n\nAugust 30-31 Cygnus the Swan. A stellar nursery, star clusters, a marvelous colorful double star, and the remnants of a supernova blast, the Celestial Swan has it all! Program Starts 8:00 PM\n\nSeptember 6-7 Celestial Recycling Rings. Stars like our sun blow huge, donut shaped “smoke rings” when they finally die. Come learn about the fate of our home star, and see a few examples of the stellar recycling that they do. Program Starts 8:00 PM\n\nSeptember 13-14 Lunar Craters. Great craters like Copernicus, Plato, and Tycho are in stark relief this weekend. Come learn how huge they are and how they formed. Saturn is also high enough to see by around 10:30. Program starts 7:30 PM\n\nSeptember 20-21 Summer’s End. The last days of summer present us with dark skies after sunset, and the Milky-Way. Stick around until 10:30 the see Saturn rising in the east. Program starts at 7:30 PM\n\nOn the night if May 10, from around 9:30 to about 11:00 the sky at JGAP (and pretty much everyone else in the USA) was filled with pink, red and green lights, from high energy particles getting trapped in Earth's magnetic field and slamming into the atoms in our upper, tenuous, atmosphere.\n\nThe auroral activity stemming from the mega-sunspot AR 3446 has died down as the sunspot as rotated away from our view. So we will not be seeing any more aurorae until it comes back around again- if it comes back around again.\n\nHere's some recommendations if you want to see an aurora in the future:\n\nGo to Spaceweather.com and read the forecast. This will give you an idea of what is coming up and what activity is probable. When conditions are particularly favorable I’ll post updates on our Facebook page and here on this website.\n\nFor up-to-the-minute forecasts, check out this graph- the “auroral oval” of predicted activity regularly (refreshing the page each time), and, if you, you see that giant green and red blob has reached down to at least northern Ohio (assuming you're in Ohio) then something is going on and you should go out and look.\n\nHere's the link: https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/.../aurora-forecast...\n\nNote that auroral forecasts in the media are often given for events that will produce aurorae only for regions that are far north of Ohio. In other words, they are often overly optimistic. It is best to watch the auroral oval and go out when the forecast is good for your particular region.\n\nBright aurorae in Ohio are very rare, with dramatic displays occurring only a few times per decade, on average. The good news is that the strong displays that we see at our latitude are often the most colorful.\n\nWhere to go:\n\nFind a place away from direct lights. Away from the city is best. JGAP might work, but we often get very, very crowded when events like this take place (Sorry.) Do not come during the program time (8:00 PM - 11:00 PM or so) unless you have a parking pass for the show or you will be squeezing out people who have already reserved spots. (Space is infinite, our parking is not.)\n\nIf the moon is half-full to fully-full (somewhere between first quarter and full moon on your calendar) then going far into the country will not get you much improvement, as the bright moon itself is a source of light pollution.\n\nWhen to go:\n\nThe intense displays of auroae do not always last a long time (The May 10 display was strong for about 90 minutes. or so). If you get in the car and drive a long way (say, to JGAP) by the time you arrive things may have calmed down and you may miss the best part of the show. Get out as soon as you can, find a place that is as nearby as possible, but still dark,\n\nImportantly, take driving time into consideration . Literally >hundreds< of people arrived at JGAP after 11:30 on May 10, having set out an hour before, and missed the show because it had died down by the time they arrived.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nSurprisingly many modern cell phones (especially the ones that have \"night photography mode\" do a great job with displays like this, and might actually reveal color when your eyes see only a diffuse grey blob. (Turn the screen brightness way down, though). This is one astrophotography situation in which they work great! Other than that, just your eyes and maybe some warm clothes and a folding chair are all you’ll need.\n\nDo not bring:\n\nA flashlight. That will ruin your night vision and you won't see it as well.\n\nGood luck aurora chasing!"
