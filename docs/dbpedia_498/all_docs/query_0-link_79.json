All photos from NASA.gov.\n\nFun facts about the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969:\n\n-- The moment that Neil Armstrong actually set foot on the moon happened with four minutes left in \"prime time,\" at 10:56 p.m., just like the climaxes of most television shows\n\n-- An estimated half billion viewers around the world witnessed the moon walk on their televisions.\n\n-- Over the eight-day mission, network telecasts totaled 230 hours.\n\n-- Stepping onto the moon's surface, Armstrong commented, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind.\"\n\n-- The longest long-distance telephone call in man's history, between President Nixon and the astronauts on the moon's surface, included this from Nixon: \"As you talk from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to double our efforts to faring peace and tranquility to earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this earth are truly one.\"\n\n-- The temperature on the parts of the moon illuminated by the sun was 180 degrees F. Where there was no sun, the temperature was -16 F.\n\n-- An estimated 1 million people came to Brevard County to watch the launch. They included more than 3,000 journalists from 55 countries besides the U.S. More than 100 correspondents were sent from Japan."
