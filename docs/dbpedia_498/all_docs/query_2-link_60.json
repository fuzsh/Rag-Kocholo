        "text": "Major Jennings was standing on Bloomfield Avenue, blocks away from a Kresge’s five-and-dime store.\n\nHe remembers how crowded it was, like the town’s annual Fourth of July parade, except it was September. He remembers the red, white and blue flags emblazoned with the words: “Montclair’s Man on the Moon.”\n\nAnd, even as a then as a 12-year-old kid, he remembers the feeling.\n\n“I knew it was something big,” he said.\n\nAnd then he saw him. The man for whom the whole town of Montclair had swarmed the streets: Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin Jr.\n\nAfter the success of the Apollo 11 mission, Aldrin had returned home to a parade of lavish proportions. Everyone wanted a glimpse of the moon man.\n\n“It was prestigious to have somebody from our community be the second person to walk on the moon,” said Jennings.\n\nIndeed, the mayor of Montclair then, Matthew Carter, declared it “the greatest day in the life of our town.”\n\nAldrin’s imprint on his hometown of 38,000 remains. There’s the plaque marking the home he grew up in on Princeton Place. There’s the collection of newspaper clippings celebrating his missions neatly tucked away at the library.\n\nThen, there are the stories.\n\nThe executive who grew up a quarter-mile from Aldrin and went on to work at the company credited with sending U.S. flags to the moon. The police officer who played high school football with Aldrin and later escorted him down the mile-long parade route.\n\nAnd Jennings, who 50 years after watching Aldrin wave down Bloomfield Avenue, is now the assistant principal at Buzz Aldrin Middle School (renamed from Mount Hebron in 2016).\n\n“The greatest example for our students is here; you have a person from our township who probably exceeded everyone’s expectations. Kids can identify with that,” Jennings said. Both he and Aldrin attended the school.\n\n“When you can identify with someone who has done something great and they’ve sat in the same classrooms, walked the same halls, used the same lavatories, ate in the same lunchrooms, you feel good about that and you say, ‘if he did it, why not me?’”\n\nInside the school, a generation of teachers and administrators, many who have lived in Montclair their entire lives, remember gathering around small TVs (mostly black-and-white) to watch a local hero land on the moon on July 20, 1969. But a new generation of students, who weren’t alive during the moon landing, are learning about Aldrin 50 years in hindsight – and in a whole new way.\n\n“He pretty much changed humanity,” said Sylvie Wurmser, 14, an eight-grader at Buzz Aldrin Middle School. “It’s really impactful that he went to our school and we can know that someone so local made such a big difference.”\n\n“It says a lot about us, too,” said fellow eighth-grader Edie Koehlert, 14.\n\n‘Montclair put Buzz on the moon’\n\nAldrin was born in 1930 in Montclair, where he attended Edgemont and Mount Hebron schools (now Buzz Aldrin Middle) and graduated from Montclair High in 1947. He has previously credited Mount Hebron school for sparking his interest in science and technology.\n\nMontclair at the time was very much suburban with a lot more open space, history professor Leslie Wilson said. While it held on to its size, diversity and tree-lined streets, Montclair has become a lot more liberal, a lot more developed and a haven for Manhattan and Brooklyn transplants.\n\n“It became a much more cosmopolitan town but it became a frontrunner in New Jersey in terms of leading the way for other towns,\" said Wilson, a history professor at Montclair State University.\n\nBefore there was astronaut Aldrin, there was Aldrin, the star student and athlete. Voted “most likely to succeed” in high school, Aldrin is remembered for his achievements in pole vaulting and football. He eventually went on to West Point and joined the Air Force. He flew 66 combat missions in Korea, earned a Ph.D. and was later accepted to the space program.\n\nHe walked in space as an astronaut aboard Gemini 12 in 1966, and three years later stood on the moon, famously stepping onto its surface just after the mission’s commander, Neil Armstrong, and marveling at the “magnificent desolation” of the lunar landscape.\n\nIn many ways, Aldrin’s return to Earth turned out to be the start of a more difficult mission. Minus the structure of the military and NASA, Aldrin has said, he contended with depression and alcoholism, and a loss of direction. His struggles to overcome those demons — he achieved sobriety in the late 1970s — were chronicled in a 2010 autobiography, “Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home From the Moon.”\n\nThese days, Aldrin, who is 89, lives in Florida and champions the cause of space travel, particularly to Mars. Representatives for him did not return repeated requests for an interview.On the day of Montclair’s parade in 1969, though, it was all about the triumph of Apollo 11. Even amid that fame and glory, Aldrin didn’t forget where he’s from.\n\nIn press accounts from his 1969 return to Montclair, Aldrin, responding to a sign thanking him for putting Montclair on the moon, said, “You’ve got that wrong. Montclair put Buzz on the moon.”\n\n‘A celebrity astronaut’\n\nDays before the start of summer vacation, students at Buzz Aldrin Middle gathered inside the school’s auditorium to watch the 90-minute documentary, Apollo 11, about the mission led by Armstrong and pilots Aldrin and Michael Collins.\n\nStudents were intrigued. They asked about fuel calculations, spaceship sizes and what G-forces (the force of gravity) felt like.\n\n“Lift off is pretty intense,” Daniel Taylor, the school’s STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) coordinator explained. “G-forces are what you feel when you’re on a roller coaster and it’s going around in a circle and you feel like you’re squished against your chair. These guys at lift off were probably really smushed and couldn’t move any part of their body.”\n\nTaylor, who has been teaching at the school for 10 years, says talking about Aldrin’s contributions gets students excited.\n\n“It gets them more interested in how the heck you get to the moon? And how do you even space travel? And to recognize that science, and technology and engineering and math are behind it. Without one of those you can’t do it,” he said.\n\nFor Sylvie, the real world connection is tangible. She met Aldrin in sixth grade when he toured the school during the renaming ceremony.\n\n“We were like shocked at being in this school and even more shocked at being in the room with a celebrity astronaut,” she said. “It’s sounds so cool just to be a pioneer for civilization.”\n\nGrowing up in a politically divisive and technology-driven time, it’s hard for some of the students to imagine the unity brought by Aldrin’s space missions and the idea of captivated crowds gathering around small TVs around the nation.\n\n“We’re so divided right now. Back then people would go out of their houses to watch or they would crowd around a TV to watch. We have multiple devices at any given time so there wouldn’t be a place where would all be parading and all together which is sad,” said Edie.\n\nMaddox Camacho said he didn’t know much about Aldrin until watching the film.\n\n“It makes me feel a little bit special going here,” he said.\n\nLiftoff to the summer\n\nFor some longtime residents, renaming the school -- or anything -- after Aldrin took way too long.\n\n“The inspiration among individuals didn’t translate to action among town leaders,” said Mark Porter, the former editor of the Montclair Times. Porter long advocated for the town to name something after Aldrin.\n\nBut even without the titles, Aldrin’s legacy was still felt.\n\n“For lots of young people it was a point of aspiration,” Porter said.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, Montclair is planning a Buzz Aldrin Day proclamation, a spokeswoman said. Buzz Aldrin Middle School said it wanted the kids to learn about Aldrin and Apollo 11 before summer break.\n\n“When they go home from the summer, they’re going to hear it on the news and I want them to have a frame of reference for what that meant,” said principal Jill Sack. The school wants to push more space education in the years to come.\n\nFor many of the kids, though, their best resource may be among the staff, some of whom still remember that day clearly.\n\nJim Zarrilli, a paraprofessional at the school, said he listened to the moon landing on the radio when he was a 21-year-old at down at the Shore.\n\n“Time marches on and people who remember that become fewer and far between,” Zarrilli said. “There’s not too many people who have lived here for 71 years. As it gets further from the event, less and less people have a recollection of it.”\n\nKaren Yi may be reached at kyi@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter at @karen_yi or on Facebook."
