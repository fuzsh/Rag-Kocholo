        "text": "To the moon and beyond with Jake Turner\n\nWALSENBURG — You know that old adage, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life”? Well, every now and then you get to meet someone who really embodies that. Enter our hometown hero, Dr. Jake Turner.\n\nTurner is a Walsenburg boy, raised here and graduating from John Mall High School in 2007. A cute boy (a claim backed up by photos his grandmother Wynnelle Turner shared with me), he was always an intelligent and hardworking student. By the time he was a preteen he was living with his dad, brother, uncle, and cousins out at Navajo. His bedroom walls were plastered in pictures from the Apollo lunar missions, as well as Star Wars and Star Trek posters. Growing up in the country meant he didn’t have access to the fledgling internet, so he was forced to — gasp — turn to the Huerfano World newspaper for ideas on what to do.\n\nIn the begining\n\nOne evening in the early summer of 2002 he was skimming the pages of the paper looking for something to alleviate the boredom of the summer doldrums. His eyes chanced upon a star party to be held out at Lathrop, sponsored by the Southern Colorado Astronomical Society out of Pueblo. While not particularly interested in space at the time, it did seem like a good way to kill the evening, so he convinced his dad to take him.\n\nOut at the lake, the society had set up a variety of telescopes and helped the folks who came to party watch the sunset and the emergence of the evening planets and stars. By the end of the night, Turner was hooked.\n\n“It was just like once I started looking through it, I was like, ‘wow, this is so incredible.’ And it’s just so expansive. It created a spark inside me. And I knew then that this was what I wanted to do, you know? I wanted to continue stargazing,” Turner gushed.\n\nAs luck would have it, his uncle had purchased a backyard telescope at a garage sale several years prior, and never got around to unboxing it. Laughing, Turner remembers “Yea, it was a scrappy thing. A yard sale telescope, held together by duct tape and wire.” He spent the next few months trying and failing to figure out how to make it work, working each day to twist knobs and dials with no success. But then, a second lucky break — the astronomical society was hosting another star party at Lathrop at the end of the summer. Turner packed up his scrappy telescope and trundled it on over. The society members were happy to help, explaining the ins and outs and how to actually find targets in the sky. From there, Turner was unstoppable.\n\nHe remembers his first breakthrough on his own, having written down the time and date of the experience so he’d never forget it. On September 6, 2002, at 7 p.m., he used his telescope to find his first object in the sky on his own: Venus.\n\nHe went out with his telescope every night as soon as his homework was finished. The astronomical society in Pueblo had a phone line you could call each day that would tell you what upcoming events you could watch for that evening and where in the sky to point your telescope to catch them. Turner called daily. His Christmas gifts morphed into books about astronomy and he memorized all the constellations.\n\nTurner spent summers working for his grandfather’s construction company, something he says informed his strong work ethic for the rest of his life. His money was all saved up for a new telescope. “I still have that one,” he grins.\n\nSet a course\n\nIt wasn’t really until his junior year of high school however that the prospect of ever being more than an amateur astronomer occurred to him. That year, he applied for and was accepted to an astronomy camp at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Arriving on a full-ride scholarship, he was trotted up to one of the mountains in Arizona, the summit dotted with telescopes.\n\nIt was two weeks of getting to live the life of a pro, attending talks and lectures about space and the science behind their explorations. Campers were tasked with proposals to test, running them past committees, and then, once approved, using the university’s telescopes to gather data needed to test their proposals and make sense of the findings. While at camp, he got to observe an exoplanet transit, his first experience with the phenomenon. The idea of exoplanets lodged in his brain from there, and he knew he wanted to turn this into a career.\n\nWith this new direction in mind, Turner relied on his teachers to help him accomplish his goals. Eva Benine had known Jake since he was a fresh-faced fourteen-year-old freshman in 2003. Turner was in her advanced math class, and his group quickly excelled beyond even that marker, necessitating Benine and the school district had to scramble to add ever-higher math classes to the curriculum. By 2006, the class was taking AP Calculus. She ended up teaching Turner every math and physics course he took in school, and emphasized to him the importance of getting as much of that under his belt as possible before heading off to university to ensure his competitiveness in a science-based field.\n\nBenine recalls “Jake was so very intelligent. His eyes just sparkled with excitement when he was learning a new topic. He struggled initially with the way I wanted them to show their work, he would often put both hands up toward his paper and say, “But why? I got the right answer!” I would explain to him that he had to be able to “prove his work” especially in Physics. Once he got past the why, he was on it! He often offered to help tutor other students in his math and science classes. Mainly because he didn’t want to have to wait for everyone to get done before we would move on.”\n\nWhile Benine fostered Turner’s science side, Lynn Baker was handling his creative streak. As he puts it, “Miss Baker was the art teacher and she encouraged the exploration of my other side, of my repertoire of being a human, not just math and science, but the rest of me too.”\n\nTurner came by his artistic tendencies naturally — his grandmother is a keen photographer, a habit he picked up from her. “I do a lot of every kind of photography. I do astrophotography, taking images of space. Every time I would go observing at a telescope, like on a mountain in Arizona or Hawaii, I’d also set up my camera outside to take photos at the same time.” But he doesn’t limit himself to shots of the sky — Turner also loves taking photos of landscapes and portraits, especially while he’s out on his travels.\n\nBaker remembers him fondly. “Jake was a kind and thoughtful student, creative and interested in so many things. We talked a lot about his passion for astronomy. My favorite memory of his excitement was while we were on a walk after dinner in the countryside of Ireland. Jon Waugh, the English teacher, and I were with a group of students and friends on an EF tour of Ireland. Out between the hedgerows, Jake started pointing out constellations to all of us in the dark and unusually clear sky that night. I think everyone was entranced by his knowledge and enthusiasm and it became one of those enchanted experiences for all of us. My friend, Tammy, commented at the time that she could see him shuffling down a college hallway in a lab coat with his Doctorate degree! A mere dream at the time, but one he’s achieved!”\n\nReach for the stars\n\nUpon graduating high school, Turner enrolled at the University of Arizona in Tucson, the same place he’d attended astronomy camp. He actually became a counselor for that camp, fostering a love of the cosmos in the next class of up-and-coming scholars.\n\nDuring his first year at university, he took a seminar covering different aspects and fields of astronomy. Students were to present on different topics, and Turner, remembering that exoplanet transit he’d seen at camp, chose to read a paper on the magnetic field of planets, with the point that by the early 2010s a new telescope was expected to be complete, that would be capable of detecting the magnetic fields of exoplanets in radio. The article cited the work of a French scientist at the forefront of the discipline, and Turner was certain that was the direction he wanted to go with his own research. He just hadn’t figured out a way to get to France yet. So it stuck in the back of his mind as he progressed through school working on a variety of research topics both within our solar system and without.\n\nRadiation 101\n\nBacking up, Turner was kind enough to give a broad overview of what his field of study includes. The really short layman’s version is thus: radiation is energy that comes from a source and travels through space at the speed of light. This energy has an electric field and a magnetic field associated with it. Everything from the light you see to the heat you feel to the x-rays your doctor takes to the gamma rays that turn Bruce Banner into the Hulk are all forms of radiation, moving at different wavelengths.\n\nOur sun is one such source of radiation, and is constantly emitting waves of it in a relentless onslaught we call the solar wind. The solar wind bombards everything in its path with particles and radiation unless it’s stopped by something like a competing atmosphere, magnetic field, or both. Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are what protects us from the wind, without them we’d be a lifeless chunk of rock.\n\nWhile we’ve known about Earth’s magnetic field for centuries, it wasn’t until 1955 that we were sure other planets could have them too, when astronomers accidentally discovered the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter, by using a telescope designed to pick up radiation frequencies in the radio range and got a big unexpected ping. Basically, electrons from the solar wind were being caught in the magnetic fields around the planet and were being tossed around back and forth, creating light in the radio spectrum that the telescope could then pick up. Once we had our first spacecraft up and away from Earth, we realized Earth does it too, which is why we get the auroras borealis and australis, or the northern and southern lights.\n\nThe technique of looking for radio waves coming off planets as they interact with solar wind was again demonstrated when looking at Saturn and Neptune, giving astronomers ample reason to believe it could be a ubiquitous phenomenon on planets, assuming there is a source of electrons (radiation) around. The hope was then to look at planets outside our own solar system for evidence of similar radio waves, which astronomers can use to decipher clues about the planet’s atmosphere and magnetosphere and about the stars emitting the radiation. The technique could also be used to find more planets in the future.\n\nAu revoir, America\n\nTurner’s big break came his first year of graduate school when he went to a conference at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. There he met the man whose paper he’d read his freshman year, the French astronomer who was working with exoplanets, soon to be his PhD advisor. The doctor was looking for graduate students, so if Turner could find a way to France, he was in. Turner managed to obtain the NSF Graduate Fellowship, which would allow him to do whatever research he wanted, and he was off to Europe.\n\nOf course, he had more obstacles to overcome upon his arrival, namely that he did not speak a word of French, and had to learn it on the fly. “That was probably one of the most difficult things I’ve ever tried doing,” he laughs. “I don’t recommend learning your first foreign language when you’re in your mid-twenties. But yea, by the time I left, I was able to get by with a degree of broken French.”\n\nThere was one other big hurdle to life abroad: the lack of peanut butter. The delicious nutty schmear is actually a pretty American thing, and Turner couldn’t find it anywhere in France. His grandmother was recruited to try and send him some from overseas. She recalls, “He was sad because it was his favorite. I was going to buy a massive jar and send it over, but it would’ve cost $34 in shipping alone, so he just had to deal without it!”\n\nDespite that downside, Turner found his time in France to be incredibly valuable, and it kickstarted his career.\n\nClaim to fame\n\nTurner was the lead author on the first study to detect potential radio waves from an exoplanet. In 2020, he and his team pointed their telescopes at the Tau Bootis system, which is relatively close to our own, as far as things light years away can be ‘close’. Using the Low Frequency Array, the team was looking for radio emissions from the exoplanet known to be in the system. By looking at the strength and polarization of the emission, and comparing it to what was hypothesized to be there, the team found the signals they detected to be in line with what is expected from the planet. The planet they detected is what astronomers refer to as a ‘hot Jupiter’, a gas giant like Jupiter, but much, much closer to the host star, heating it up far beyond what Jupiter, which has a mean temperature of -166oF, experiences.\n\nIt wasn’t just luck that they got here though — the team had spent 100 hours poring over radio observations and scaling up Jupiter’s measurements to figure out what sort of signal they should be looking for. All that math with Benine paying off!\n\nTurner adds “This planet was discovered in 1997, it was actually one of the first exoplanets we’ve ever discovered. It’s really well characterized, lots of people have studied it with almost every instrument we have, so we were quite confident that we had the best system to try to test this new idea on.”\n\nBack to the moon\n\nSo what’s next for Turner? For those of you who’ve been paying attention, the US has just gone back to the moon for the first time in 50 years. The mission was a joint operation between NASA and private commercial investment. The instruments on board were NASA, but the shuttle was from SpaceX. Turner explains we’re going to see more of that in the future, as underfunded scientists trying to gather more data end up working with politicians and businessmen keen to expand their footprints into the stars.\n\nThe mission that landed on February 22 included an instrument called the Radiowave Observations at the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath, or ROLSES. It has the ability to detect and monitor the dynamic radio energy of the near-lunar surface, helping us determine both characteristics about the moon as well as what our own impact on those radio waves may be. It’s important to get those baselines so we can understand how they’ll impact future science done there. And Turner is a science advisor for the mission, as well as for the upcoming followup launch of another ROLSES array, set to depart in 2026.\n\nTurner is also an exoplanet science advisor for the anticipated FarView observatory, which is currently under development and hoped to launch in the 2030s. The goal of this observatory is to land on the far side of the moon, which will give the telescope the rare opportunity to look out into the cosmos without being bombarded by solar wind or the radio waves we here on Earth emit all the time. Since our moon is tidally locked, with the dark side always facing away from us, the far side of the moon is always shielded by the moon itself from our interference.\n\nBut wait, there’s more\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there’s more to Turner than a groundbreaking space genius and an artist. He’s also a man who loves his family, his friends, and his own planet.\n\nBenine recalls Jake was always fascinated with the stars, the planet, and the environment. He started riding his bike to school every day and absolutely refused to “get a license and drive” like the other students. When I asked him why, he said, “We need to save the planet. I’m doing my part.” He never did get his license while in school and as far as I know he never did. He is not one to preach about his beliefs, he is one to practice them. Jake is a genuine, kind, and caring man, who just happens to be a brilliant scientist. It is my honor to have been a part of his education and to continue to be a part of his life.”\n\nBaker adds to that: “We’ve stayed in touch all these years and he’s my go-to to explain things to me when I have astronomical questions. He kindly answers in ways that make things so understandable for me. Jake is one of the most extraordinary humans I’ve ever met!”\n\nHis grandmother echos the sentiment. “He and I are really close. He gets his red hair from me, and we’ve gone on several trips together. He loves, loves, loves his family. He’s very attached to his nieces and nephews, and they all love him too. He’s very good with them, he brought his telescope home one summer to set it up for them and showed them how to use it.”\n\nGrinning as she shuts the scrapbook she brought for me to look at, Wynette closes out the conversation, “We always knew he was going to do something nerdy.”\n\nBut nobody says it better than Turner. “What I’m doing is on the forefront of human knowledge, and it’s not easy. It’s not simple. We don’t really know where we’re going, but if you keep working at it and you’re determined, eventually you’re going to find something interesting. You’ll discover something about yourself that you otherwise wouldn’t know, and hopefully, you know, discover something more about our place in the universe.”"
