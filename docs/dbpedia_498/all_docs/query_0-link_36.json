        "text": "The museum this month broke ground on an expansion and renovation, which will double the size of classroom space, plus update numerous exhibits, according to museum marketing coordinator Olivia Nelson. The work will be completed in time for the anniversary.\n\nThe museum is also planning events and activities to commemorate the moon landing next year, though Nelson said details were still being finalized.\n\nNumerous communitywide events are in the works, as well, including an art show, stargazing events, hot air balloon rally, a flower garden competition, cooking contest and the annual Summer Moon Festival.\n\nThe community commemoration will culminate in a week of back-to-back activities, leading up to the anniversary on Saturday, July 20.
