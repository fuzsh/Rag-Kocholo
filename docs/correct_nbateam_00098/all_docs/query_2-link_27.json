        "text": "Charley Rosen\n\nBest all-time point guards\n\nHere's the initial installment of a continuing series where I try to select the best all-time players at each position, best sixth men and best coaches.\n\nNumbers are just a marginal guide. More important in my reckonings are a candidate's off-the-ball play, dominance of his peers and the overall success of his team(s).\n\nOf course, comparing players from radically different eras is always a risky business. George Mikan, for example, would be severely drubbed in one-on-one battles versus the likes of Shaq, Wilt and Kareem. Despite that fact, Mikan can arguably be seen as the most influential player of his time, and his Minneapolis Lakers were the NBA's first dynasty. So the intent here is more mindful of the total NBA historical continuum than dependant on today's existential realities.\n\nIt's likewise important to note the variances in styles of play over the last 60 seasons — pre-shot-clock and post-shot-clock, the twin-towers concept and small-ball strategies, as well as the different demands made on players by their respective teams. Despite these inexact specifications, the players in each category will be competitively ranked.\n\nPOINT GUARDS\n\n1. — OSCAR ROBERTSON\n\nThe Big O was equally as versatile as Magic and nearly as strong. Indeed, Robertson's talents covered the entire scope and possibilities of the game. He could do everything at the highest level — rebound, pass, set picks, dribble, box out, run and shut anyone down on defense. In 1961-62, Robertson averaged a triple-double — 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists. He wasn't boasting when he said, years later, \"If I had known it was such a big deal, I would've averaged a triple-double for my entire career.\" He understood every nuance of the game and demanded the same perfection from his teammates. Robertson was also a fierce and ruthless competitor.\n\nWhat did he lack?\n\nThree-point range, only because the 3-ball hadn't been instituted. And according to Nate Thurmond, \"Oscar couldn't fly, but he did everything else better than Michael Jordan.\"\n\nWhatever the position, whatever the standards of the era, Oscar Robertson was the most perfect basketball player ever.\n\n2. — MAGIC JOHNSON\n\nMagic was a rarity. At 6-foot-9, 235 pounds, he was a legitimate triple-threat — inside, outside and on the run. His sheer size advantage allowed him to have an unobstructed view of the entire court and effectively prohibited opponents from contesting any pass he chose to throw. In addition to his remarkable size and strength, Magic had an incomparable handle (his high rate of turnovers was a function of the inordinate time the ball was in his hands), made excellent decisions with the ball, was an incredible finisher and was absolutely the best fast-break trigger man ever.\n\nWhat else could he do?\n\nPost-up and fill the net with hook shots. Eat up space in rapid fashion with his long strides. Blast his way through traffic. Rebound. Shoot free throws. Maximize the abilities of his teammates. Rise to virtually every clutch situation. And win.\n\nWhat couldn't he do?\n\nHis drive-and-dish capabilities were severely restricted by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's being ensconced in the pivot. Not until his latter years did Magic develop an effective outside shot — an old-timey shot-put-one-hander. And throughout his career his defense was shamefully poor.\n\nJohnson also had a magic touch with the media. The bright smile, the up-beat comments, the total availability. But when the red light was switched off, Magic often had another agenda.\n\nLike the first time Magic met with the Lakers' new coach, Mike Dunleavy, at a players association meeting back in 1990. Dunleavy sought out Magic for a pre-season confab, and as they strolled along the beach, he handed Johnson the playbook he planned to implement for the upcoming season. Magic proceeded to toss the playbook into the ocean, point to his head and say, \"The playbook is in here.\"\n\n3. — JERRY WEST\n\nWest was one of the most deadly pull-up jump shooters of all time. He rarely went left, simply because he never had to (the official NBA logo with West dribbling left-handed must be a negative image). But he'd move to his right at full speed, execute one hard-and-last dribble that would propel him skyward and the ball was shot and gone in a jiffy. He was a good, if not exceptional passer, and his long arms and quick-hops made him a surprisingly effective finisher.\n\nJerry West's number was always called whenever a game was on the line. (Wen Roberts / Getty Images)\n\nThose same long arms (fastened to high-shoulders) likewise made West an outstanding defender. Indeed, opposing players were warned not to attempt a pass whenever West was the lone defender in a 2-on-1 fast-breaking situation — simply because his reach and hand-speed would get a piece of all but the most precise passes.\n\nWhile acknowledging his authentic greatness, several of his peers still insist that West was also cast by the media as a white hope who was therefore given much more credit than he truly deserved. And because he was never satisfied with his own or his teammates' play in any given game, West was never a popular figure in the locker room. But his coaches all loved him for playing all out all the time, and they made sure that \"Mr. Clutch's\" number was called whenever a game was on the line.\n\n4. — JOHN STOCKTON\n\nStockton was a point-guard in the classic mold. Primarily a passer, Stockton shot the ball only when necessary. He was a master at changing speeds off his dribble, at jumping into his defender while releasing a shot and thusly drawing fouls, at moving without the ball, at hitting open shots (especially in the clutch) and a sneakily effective offensive rebounder. His decision-making in screen/roll situations was impeccable, and he also relished setting screens himself — usually with elbows flashing, a characteristic that moved opponents to call him a border-line dirty player. (Stockton was a nasty character, both on and off the court.) Although he'd gamble on steals, chase the ball too much and overreact to ball-penetration, Stockton's defense was surprisingly effective.\n\nStockton rarely got to orchestrate fast breaks in Jerry Sloan's grind-it-out offenses. But when the Jazz did get out and run, Stockton's exceptional judgment was likewise in evidence.\n\nToo bad the prime of Stockton's career coincided with the Bulls' Jordanian dynasty. He did, however, propel the Jazz into back-to-back finals appearances. Some could say that Stockton made Karl Malone appear to be a much better player than he may have actually been.\n\n5. — WALT FRAZIER\n\nClyde's cooler-than-thou demeanor masked his fiercely competitive nature. He could muscle and/or slick his way to the basket, and was a high-percentage jump shooter who rarely forced a shot. Frazier could also rebound like a big guy, hit the open man and, above all, he could defend. Indeed, overlooked in Willis Reed's courageous performance in Game 7 of the 1970 Knicks-Lakers championship go-round, were Frazier's 36 points, 19 assists and smothering defense on Jerry West. Steals were his specialty, as were big-time jumpers.\n\nWalt Frazier was the ultimate \"team player\" for the Knicks. ( / Getty Images)\n\nUnder the tutelage of coach Red Holzman, Frazier learned the value of the team game and was willing to sacrifice numbers for rings. He also learned that freedom unchecked by structure led to chaos, and that only within a system could freedom become a bountiful creativity. And despite his casual game-face, Frazier played with a precision that was based on an intricate understanding of Xs and Os.\n\nFrazier was never a jet and was most comfortable with the ball in his hands, but he was a winner.\n\n6. — DENNIS JOHNSON\n\nForget about his scoring prowess (14.1 ppg over his 14-year career, with a high of 19.5 for Phoenix in 1981-82), forget about his three championship rings (one with Seattle in 1979, two with Boston in 1984 and 1986), Dennis Johnson was simply the best big-time defensive guard in league history. In fact, DJ was the only defender who could force Magic to turn his back on the Lakers' offense in order to protect, and maintain possession of, the ball.\n\nJohnson also proved that nice guys can finish first.\n\n7. — LENNY WILKENS\n\nMister Smooth glided through a ball game in total control of every situation. Did his team need a pop shot, a slick pass, or even an occasional rebound? Wilkens could deliver. How about a steal, or the rescue of a loose ball? Wilkens would get it done.\n\nHe wasn't strong or flashy, and his defense was merely adequate. But like John Wesley Harding, Wilkens was never known to make a foolish move, with the notable exception of agreeing to coach the Knicks!\n\n8. — RALPH BEARD\n\nNever heard of him? That's because Beard played only two seasons in the league — 1949-51 with the Indianapolis Olympians. In his rookie season, Beard was named to the All-NBA Second Team, and for an encore, he was voted to the First Team. Unfortunately, he was subsequently banned from the NBA when it was discovered that during his All-American career at the University of Kentucky, Beard (along with several other teammates) had taken money from gamblers to alter the score of ball games. Beard did indeed take the money, but only because doing so was a time-honored tradition at UK. Still, he was such a ferocious competitor that he never even tried to rig a score.\n\nHis game featured error-free passes, headlong drives to the rim and shut-down defense. According to Adolph Rupp, the only flaws in Beard's game were an erratic left hand, and inconsistency at the foul line. (During Beard's brief tenure in the NBA, his free throw accuracy was 77 percent.) Otherwise, the notoriously hard-to-please Rupp believed that Beard was \"an almost perfect basketball player.\"\n\nIn the long history of the NBA, no one ever played with more intensity than Ralph Beard.\n\nOther candidates — Slater Martin, Dick McGuire, Bob Cousy, Guy Rodgers, Bob Davies, Jason Kidd and Isiah Thomas.\n\nAll-time best shooting guards\n\nThe job descriptions of role players cover every aspect of the game — from setting screens to boxing out, from making the pass that leads to an assist pass to filling a lane on a fast break, and so on. But every offensive set is designed to get the ball into the hands of a player whose expertise is to fill the basket.\n\nBy definition, then, shooting guards have to be able to shoot. Close behind this requirement is the ability to create their own shots. Also critical is knowing how to use screens, differentiating between good shots and bad ones, and executing plays with precision.\n\nBeing able to play acceptable defense is another necessary. What advantage would be gained by his team should a shooting guard register 25 points while his opposite number scored 25 or more?\n\nNo. 1 — MICHAEL JORDAN\n\nThis pick is a layup.\n\nMost go-to scorers tend to coast on defense to conserve energy for their ball-time responsibilities. Jordan was the rare exception whose unyielding defense allowed him to win ball games with clutch plays at either end of the court.\n\nBesides his transcendent talents, the X-factor in Jordan's success was his incredible competitive edge. MJ would practice with more intensity than most of his peers demonstrated during games. And if a team's superstar practiced with all his might, then the last scrub on the bench was motivated to do the same.\n\nThe most amazing single basketball play that I've ever witnessed was performed by Michael Jordan: In October 1989, when I was coaching the Rockford Lightning in the Continental Basketball Association, I happened to be at the Deerfield Multiplex for Chicago Bulls' initial training camp session of the season. Since the Bulls were Rockford's NBA \"affiliate,\" I had dibs on every draft choice and free agent who would eventually be cut by the Bulls. The player I was looking hardest at was Matt Brust, a 6-4 tough guy signed as camp fodder out of St. John's.\n\nBesides having incredible talent, Michael Jordan possessed intense competitiveness.\n\nFor the first few days of any training camp, the protocol is traditional: The important veteran players cruise through the drills and scrimmages, while everybody else busts their hump from baseline to baseline. That's why, in an otherwise lukewarm scrimmage, Jordan came sashaying to the basket in a semi-break situation, casually gearing up to amuse the in-crowd with his first slam-bang dunk of the new season. But Brust, hustling like his pants were on fire, caught up with Jordan and proceeded to His Airness on his royal keister.\n\nBAM! Jordan went down and didn't move for a few moments. Suddenly the gym was hushed as the trainers scurried onto the court. The only sound was Jerry Krause choking on one of his breakfast donuts ...\n\n... until Jordan finally climbed to his feet, shook off the ministrations of the trainers, and motioned for the scrimmage to resume. But the fearsome look in MJ's eyes foretold a revenge that would be both devastating and creative.\n\nOn the very next sequence Jordan pilfered a careless pass and was once again headed hoopward-and there was Brust, chasing the ball and intent on a command performance.\n\nThe first hint of trouble was when Jordan slowed down somewhat to allow Brust to catch him. Then, as before, Jordan elevated to the basket, palming the ball in his right hand. This time, just as Brust launched another audacious attack on Jordan's august person, MJ made a preemptive strike, smashing his left elbow into the rookie's forehead. Then, while still levitated, Jordan switched the ball to his left hand, reached around to the far side of the rim, and shivered the entire gym with a thunderous dunk.\n\nFor Jordan, score two points and a KO.\n\nFor Brust, a mild concussion and an early retirement.\n\nNo. 2 — BILL SHARMAN\n\nSharman rates just behind Jordan as the best scorer-defender at his position. Renowned for his deadly one-hander, and his faultless execution of whatever plays Red Auerbach had scripted, Sharman was an incredibly gifted athlete. (He sat on the Brooklyn Dodgers' bench during the 1951 stretch run, and was also an outstanding tennis player and golfer.)\n\nIn addition to his scoring heroics, Sharman was a scrappy rebounder, a diligent passer, as well as a reliable ball-handler and caretaker.\n\nSharman's tenacious defense went unnoticed by most fans and the media. But among his contemporaries, his strength, quickness and sheer will-power were proverbial. In the hey days of the Cousy-Russell dynasty, it was Sharman who was entrusted with taking the win-or-lose shot, and also for defending the opponents' most explosive backcourtsman.\n\nHis world-class talent and his indomitable work ethic certainly contributed to Sharman's success, but he also paid attention to every detail and every nuance of the game. During his 11-year NBA career (that featured being named the MVP of the 1955 All-Star game, as well as four Celtic championships), Sharman's voluminous post-game notes to himself were legendary.\n\nMoreover, he was one of the few championship-caliber players who later became successful coaches (Sharman was the NBA's Coach of the Year when his Lakers won the title in 1972). As a player, coach, general manager, and consultant (his current job with the Lakers), Sharman always was a winner.\n\nNo. 3 — SAM JONES\n\nThe scoring half of the Celtics' fabled Jones Boys, Sam's bank shots were guaranteed by the FDIC. For a designated shooter, Jones was a passable passer and rebounder, and his ambushing of the passing lanes (to say nothing of Bill Russell forever lurking in the paint) made him an effective defender. Nobody utilized screens better than S. Jones, and nobody (with the notable exception of Drazen Petrovic) had a quicker release.\n\nFrom 1962-1968, Jones was Boston's dreadnaught scorer, reaching a highwater mark of 25.9 ppg in 1964-65. But Jones always saved his best shots for playoff competition — if he tallied over 20 ppg for only four regular seasons, he topped that in seven championship runs.\n\nJones was smart, tough, and a relentless practitioner of the Celtics' vaunted fast break--invariably ignited by a rebound and outlet pass from Russell. Everybody knows that Number Six won eleven championship rings, but guess who's second in that department. Sam Jones, with ten.\n\nNo. 4 — KOBE BRYANT\n\nFor sheer talent, only MJ can outshine Kobe Bryant. Still only 26 years old, Kobe excels at nearly every aspect of the game — creativity, shooting (especially with a game on the line), rebounding, passing, defense, rebounding, and competing. His only deficiency is his rampant narcissism, a character flaw that has had serious on- and off-court consequences.\n\nShould Kobe ever mature to the point where he can play (and live) with an abiding sense of discipline, he might conceivably challenge Jordan for the top of the heap.\n\nHal Greer (15) was a clutch shot-maker on one of the best teams in NBA history.\n\n(George Kalinsky / Getty Images)\n\nNo. 5 — HAL GREER\n\nAt 6-2, Hal Greer was an undersized shooting guard, yet his strength allowed him to play much bigger. He was a dead-eye jump shooter, a surprisingly good rebounder, an accurate passer, and an earnest defender. But it was Greer's high-powered scoring prowess whenever a game was up for grabs that set him above his peers.\n\nDuring Philadelphia's awesome championship season of 1966-67, Greer was the team's second-leading regular season scorer-his 22.1 ppg was surpassed only by Wilt Chamberlain's 24.1. But come the playoffs, Greer's output of 27.7 eclipsed Wilt's point-production by 6.0 ppg. Wilt always garnered the headlines, but Hal Greer was the money man on what was arguably the best NBA team ever.\n\nNo. 6 — CLYDE DREXLER\n\nAnother multi-dimensional performer, Drexler rarely lost his composure. Gliding effortlessly through a game, Drexler could score points by the dozen, make snappy passes, and also rebound with the bigs.\n\nIf his shot was somewhat streaky, and his iffy defense had to be augmented by gambling for steals, Drexler knew how to maximize his considerable strengths and minimize his weaknesses. Drexler was also reputed to be a divisive presence in the locker room-a back-biter, who was zealous of his own shot-opportunities-but once the lights were switched on, he was the consummate team player.\n\nNo. 7 — EARL MONROE\n\nEarl Monroe was a dynamic scorer — a whirling, spinning flash of elbows, hips, and unexpected shots. It was Earl the Pearl who made the individualistic brilliance of the inner-city black game acceptable in the NBA. Every shot, every venture into the lane, was an exercise in excitement and daring-do. Monroe-watchers could depend on his showing them something they'd never seen before during each and every game.\n\nSure, his passes were of the dipsy-doo variety, most of his rebounds were purely accidental, and he didn't concentrate on playing defense until Baltimore dealt him to the Knicks in 1971. But the excitement he generated easily overshadowed his shortcomings.\n\nIf Walt Frazier, his running mate in New York, was regarded with awe and profound respect by Knick partisans, Earl Monroe was beloved.\n\nNo. 8 — SIDNEY MONCRIEF\n\nThis was another do-everything guard. Although he was more of a slasher than a spot-up shooter, and his handle was sometimes problematic, Moncrief could put numbers in the book. A terrific passer and rebounder, Moncrief excelled at playing shut-down defense. Moncrief was a low-profile, crunch-time guy who seemed to peak at just the right times.\n\nNo. 9 — GEORGE GERVIN\n\nThis guy was a scoring machine. He led the NBA in scoring four times, and his unpredictable shot releases were impossible to defend. Long-distance shooting was definitely not his forte-neither was passing, rebounding or playing defense.\n\nGranted that Gervin's game was strictly one-dimensional, and that his Spurs teams were always pretenders rather than legit contenders. But the Iceman could certainly heat up a scoreboard.\n\nOther candidates — Reggie Miller, Dave Bing, Lou Hudson and Walter Davis.\n\nAll-time best small forwards\n\nThis category is the toughest to rate simply because small forwards are arguably the NBA's best all-around athletes. They must be able to handle and rebound, drive and spot-shoot, play inside and outside, run and bang—and also guard each other.\n\nNo. 1 - LARRY BIRD\n\nCompared to the other top-flight small forwards, Larry Bird certainly wasn't much of an athlete. He was an inconsistent perimeter shooter, except when a ballgame was racing toward the final buzzer. And if he wasn't an exceptional man-to-man defender, Bird compensated by playing smart team defense. Although he was rather slow afoot, he seemed to always be in the right place at the right time. Bird was also an incredibly alert passer, a sure-handed rebounder, and a resourceful scorer.\n\nHis competitive edge was unparalleled, as was his toughness. But Bird's biggest plus was his ability to anticipate the unfolding of every critical play a heartbeat ahead of everybody else.\n\nNo. 2 - JOHN HAVLICEK\n\nHondo could run for days at a time. He never showed a sign of weariness, not even when the Celtics were routinely scheduled for back-to-back playoff games — usually Saturday night in New York, and the following afternoon at home. During the latter years of the Celtics' Russellian dynasty (and continuing into the Cowens era), it was Havlicek who personified Boston's game plan: Run, run, and keep on running, until the bad guys lost their will to win — then run them off the court.\n\nLarry Bird was an inconsistent perimeter shooter, except when a ballgame was racing toward the final buzzer. (Jon Soohoo/NBAE / Getty Images)\n\nAlways dangerous in the clutch, Havlicek was a threat to score off the dribble or off a stop-and-pop. He was lightning in a bottle without the ball, but his first step with the rock in hand was too fast to defend. An unofficial poll of his contemporaries revealed that Havlicek was the one small forward nobody wanted to guard.\n\nHis perpetual hustle was just as effective on the uphill end of the court. He was an All-NBA First Teamer from 1971-74, and voted to the All-Defensive Team from 1972-76. Nobody was quicker into the passing lanes, and nobody could get over screens more consistently than Havlicek. Throughout his 16-year Hall of Fame career, Havlicek was also the NBA's perennial leader in floor burns.\n\nNo. 3 - SCOTTIE PIPPEN\n\nPippen was a dynamic scorer in half-court situations and also an accomplished finisher on the run. He could play big and he could play small; there was no aspect of the game he didn't master. He was as comfortable in the triangle offense as Brer Rabbit was in the briar patch. But what sets Pippen above the rest is his ability to play suffocating defense at any of the skill positions (point guard, shooting guard, and small forward). Indeed, the only flaw in his game was a tendency to shoot impulsive 3-pointers when the shot-clock was still in the high-teens.\n\nWhile Pippen was usually aloof with civilians, he was the player that the other Bulls turned to for advice and solace. (They were all much too afraid of MJ's caustic and insulting remedies for their comparatively inferior talent.) Moreover, it was Pippen who orchestrated the Bulls' stingy defense — making on-the-spot adjustments, and instructing his teammates (including MJ) when to double, when to rotate, when to sag, when to go over and when to go under screens.\n\nOn the defensive end of Chicago's six championships, Pippen was Phil Jackson's surrogate coach-on-the-court.\n\nNo. 4 - JULIUS ERVING\n\nNot only was Erving the best finisher of all time, fans, coaches and players all held their breath when he approached the rim with a full head of steam. What would Doc do next? Eyewitnesses were seldom disappointed, because at least once a game Erving did something nobody had ever seen. An acrobatic layup in a crowd. A soaring dunk over a clutch of high-jumping big men. A swirling flip shot from another dimension of time and space.\n\nBeyond his ability to stun and entertain, Julius Erving was a winner. (Walter Looss Jr./NBAE / Getty Images)\n\nBut beyond his ability to stun and entertain, Erving was a winner. He was a high-flying rebounder (especially on offense), a creative shot-maker and passer, as well as an inspirational and supportive teammate.\n\nWhat couldn't he do?\n\nShoot from long range. (His 3-point accuracy in the ABA& #151; 32.2 percent — was mostly due to the lightweight ABA ball. In the NBA, he shot only 26.1 percent from downtown.) Play solid position defense. (He tried to compensate by ambushing the passing lanes.) And shoot with his left hand.\n\nEven though Doc played 11 stellar seasons in the NBA (1976-87), his knees were worn down by carrying the entire league during his previous five-year stint in the red-white-and-blue ABA. I was fortunate enough to see him play several times with the Virginia Squires-as well as the New York Nets — and he did things back then he couldn't do once his wheels started wobbling. Like cut sharply without the ball; play energetic deny-defense in the post and on the wings; jump five times after the same rebound; dunk from a flat-footed takeoff against guys like Artis Gilmore.\n\nBut even when his knees were sore and aching, the Doctor was always IN.\n\nNo. 5 - RICK BARRY\n\nA self-proclaimed basketball gypsy, Rick Barry spent four primetime years playing (plus one season sitting out his NBA option) in the ABA. Wherever he went, scoring was his bag — he led the NBA with 35.6 ppg in 1966-67. Quick and relentless on the break, accurate from any distance on the move or with his feet set, Barry was virtually unstoppable whatever a game's pace.\n\nHe was also a record-breaking — and underhand-shooting — performer at the free throw line. Six times leading the NBA in that department and finishing his NBA career with a lifetime mark of 90 percent.\n\nBarry was also an NBA pioneer — the first-ever point-forward. He disdained showboating and his basic bounce- and two-hand chest-passes were usually right on the mark. As the fulcrum of the Warriors offense, Barry led Golden State to an NBA title in 1975.\n\nHis defense was also fundamentalist. Blocked shots were not in his repertoire, nor was he a board-hound, but his hungry hands were always quick to gobble up any careless dribble or pass. Credit his incredible anticipation for leading the league in steals (2.85) in 1975-75.\n\nOkay, he could be unbearably arrogant, and he always believed he knew more about basketball than did any of his coaches. But Barry was a gamer.\n\nNo. 6 - ELGIN BAYLOR\n\nElgin Baylor was the most dynamic scorer at his position. With his hang-in-the-air prestidigitations, the \"Man of a Thousand Moves\" finished his 14-year Hall-of-Fame career averaging an even 27 ppg. He had a chronic facial tic that gave him a built-in head-fake, but it was Baylor's powerful right-handed drives (he would have starved to death if forced to eat with his left hand) that broke down putative defenders. Play him soft and he'd knock down fifteen-footers all night long.\n\nNor did Tick Tock mind passing the ball, but only when he couldn't find a shot for himself. And he was a bear on the boards — a lifetime average of 13.5 per game in the rebounding department.\n\nHis defense, however, was pathetic.\n\nBaylor would always put points in the book, but several opponents remember having career games against his casual defensive efforts. Another fly in Baylor's ointment was his lackadaisical attitude toward practice. Immediately after being forced into retirement early in the 1971-72 season, the L.A. Lakers went on a record-breaking consecutive win streak that lasted 33 games. Among other reasons for the run (namely the presence of Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Gail Goodrich), teammates credited the ferocity of the team's practice sessions.\n\nBut whatever his failings, Baylor could always make the net dance to his own tune.\n\nNo. 7 BILLY CUNNINGHAM\n\nThe Kangaroo Kid was a rookie with Philadelphia in 1965, and throughout his 11-year pro career (including two in the ABA), he never lost his enthusiasm. He was the most prolific rebounding small forward of his generation—especially on the offensive boards.\n\nShooting was a weakness, and it wasn't until late in his career that he mastered a dependable mid-range jumper. Even so, his left-handed swoops to the hoop were virtually unstoppable and he was a lifetime 21.2 ppg scorer. And whenever a game was in the balance, Billy C. would find a way to score.\n\nHis defense was earnest and depended, mostly on his vertical and lateral quickness. Yet he was far from being a stopper.\n\nDominique Wilkins could power his way through, up and over the best bigs. (Nathaniel S. Butler / Getty Images)\n\nIn the final tally, it's Cunningham's clutch scoring and board-work that sets him above other prolific scorers at the No. 3 slot.\n\nNo. 8 - DOMINIQUE WILKINS\n\nThe Human Highlight Film could put the ball through the hole on a regular basis. With his two-footed takeoffs, Wilkins could power his way through, up and over the best bigs. His shooting was erratic, but when he was in the zone he seemed to be playing one-on-none.\n\nDefense? So-so. Screen/rolls always left him befuddled.\n\nRebounding? Ordinary.\n\nPassing? Below average, and only effected under duress.\n\nBall handling? Atrocious. His lifetime assist-to-turnover ratio was 1:1.\n\nWilkins was a superb scorer on mostly pedestrian teams. But oh those spine-tingling rim-rattlers!\n\nNo. 9 - JOE FULKS\n\nIn the summer of 1946, just prior to the NBA's initial season (before the 1949 merger, the league was officially the Basketball Association of America), owners of the 11 new franchises were desperate to sign capable ballplayers. There was no draft so everybody who could shoot a basketball and chew gum at the same time was a free agent.\n\nEddie Gottlieb was in charge of the Philadelphia Warriors, and he decided to take a chance on an obscure 6-foot-5, 190-pound player from Murray State, a small-time college in Kentucky. Joe Fulks was that player, and before enlisting in the Marines he averaged 13.2 ppg over two varsity seasons.\n\nIn those days, any player regularly registering double-figures was deemed an outstanding scorer, and a twenty-point outburst called for celebratory headlines. But Murray State was No-wheres-ville. But Gottlieb saw Fulks play for a Marine Corps team and was impressed with a revolutionary aspect of \"Jumping Joe's\" game: His deadly jump shot.\n\nThis was a time when players mostly took hook shots, layups or two-handed set shots. Radicals like Hank Luisetti employed one-handed sets. But jumpers were out of the question. How could a player shoot accurately with both feet off the floor? Gottlieb, however, saw that jumpers were unblockable and could easily be unleashed against much taller players. So Gottleib took a chance and signed Fulks to the highest salary in the league, a whopping $6,000!\n\nGottlieb instructed Fulks to shoot first and never ask questions. (He averaged a mere 0.4 assists per game as a rookie.) And, from start to finish, Fulks was the BAA's leading point-maker and top gate attraction. (Time called him \"the Babe Ruth of basketball.\") Fulks finished the season averaging an astounding 23.2 ppg, while the runner-up, Bob Feerick, only tallied 16.8. In an early season game against Toronto, Fulks astounded the sports world by scoring 41 points! No wonder the Warriors were the first-ever BAA/NBA champs.\n\nThe following season, Fulks suffered various injuries but still led the league with 22.1 ppg. Then in 1948-49, George Mikan assumed control of the individual scoring heroics — but Fulks still managed 26.0 ppg.\n\nAfter the BAA absorbed the National Basketball League and formed the NBA (1949), the competition got tougher, the small forwards got bigger, and more players employed the jump shot. Fulks remained an effective scorer (14.2 ppg in 1949-50, then 18.7, 15.1, 11.9, before retiring on the heels on another injury plagued season in 1953-54.)\n\nNo other small forward ever dominated as did Joe Fulks in the fledgling years of the NBA.\n\nOther candidates — Alex English and Bernard King—both one-dimensional, defenseless scorers. Paul Arizin and George Yardley—scorers, rebounders, and defensive duds.\n\nBest all-time power forwards\n\nThey used to be called hatchet men.\n\nThe blunt edges of their talents hewed out rebounds, screens, defense and the kind of selective brutality essential to any contact sport. They were later referred to as enforcers. However, in today's game, the skills and duties of power forwards cover the entire spectrum of the game.\n\nNo. 1 TIM DUNCAN\n\nSince the retirement of David Robinson, Tim Duncan has become just a part-time power forward because come crunch-time, Robert Horry plays the four, while TD is the Spurs' center.\n\nIn any case, Duncan's virtues are well known: Nifty post-up moves (with his right-handed jump hook being his supreme weapon), sure-handed rebounding, long-armed defense, alert passes and somewhat overrated jump shooting. Although he uses his elbows as grappling hooks, the Big Fundamental plays with more finesse than actual power. Despite that fact, his ability to deliver in the clutch, resourcefulness and above all, his will to win, put him at the top of this list.\n\nNo. 2 KEVIN McHALE\n\nKevin McHale had the most effective variety of low-post moves of any power forward or center. Drop-steps, spins, hooks, duck-unders, face-ups, back-downs, fadeaway and turn-around jumpers — as well as some improvised moves that were beyond categorizing. His unstoppability was evidenced by McHale's leading the league in field goal percentage twice (1986-88, with identical percentages of 60.4).\n\nHe was also an OK passer, great offensive rebounder and adequate presence on the defensive glass. And McHale's defense was every bit as outstanding as his offense. He was listed at 6-foot-10, but with his long arms and high shoulders, McHale played at least five inches taller.\n\nBob Pettit was a two-time MVP and All-NBA First Team selection. (NBA PHOTOS / Getty Images)\n\nThe Larry Bird-Robert Parrish-Kevin McHale front line is generally considered to be the most dominant of all time — and it was McHale who did most of the heavy lifting that enabled the Celtics to win three championships (1981, '84, '86) during his 13-year tenure in Boston. Indeed, all of McHale's pertinent numbers were higher during the playoffs.\n\nAlthough partially hidden in Bird's shadow, McHale was a legitimate franchise player in his own right.\n\nNo. 3 BOB PETTIT\n\nThis guy rendered most of his opponents' numbers powerless. His honors included two MVPs, (1956, '59), one championship ('58), and he was selected to the All-NBA First Team from 1955-64.\n\nBob Pettit was a savage rebounder — his career-high was 20.3 per game in 1960-61, and he concluded his 11 seasons (with the Milwaukee/St. Louis Hawks) averaging 16.2. He scored with one-handed sets, mid-range springers, put-backs and hard-nosed drives to the rim. Put Pettit down for a lifetime mark of 26.4 ppg. He was a dependable (if not prolific) passer and a ferocious (if foul-prone) defender.\n\nThe bigger the game, the bigger he played.\n\nNo. 4 KARL MALONE\n\nWhy such a low rating for a two-time MVP and the second-leading scorer ever?\n\nBecause Karl Malone was a choke artist. In the clutch, he'd miss free throws and take ill-advised shots. For example, instead of pounding his way into the lane from his customary station on the left box, Malone would spin baseline and uncork a low-percentage jumper.\n\nAnd don't pay any attention to his being named three times to the NBA's All-Defensive Team (1997-99). In truth, he was strong enough to move any low-post player several feet from his favorite spot. But his lateral movement was always poor, meaning any opponent who could turn and face would always wind up with a clean look. Also, Malone's pet ploy was to swipe at the ball while his opponent was preparing to shoot. Sometimes Malone was successful, but more often than not, his gamble would be futile, and he would be left exposed and off balance, placing his teammates in jeopardy.\n\nMalone was never anything more than a good player. John Stockton's crafty passes are responsible for turning Malone into a cinch Hall-of-Famer.\n\nNo. 5 DAVE DeBUSSCHERE\n\nYeah, he was a terrific spot-shooter with incredible range. He could rebound, pass and drive. But Dave DeBusschere gained entry into the Hall of Fame (1983) mostly on the basis of his Velcro-chested defense.\n\nHe wasn't fond of switching on defense. He'd take care of his man and thought his teammates should take care of theirs. And his single-minded resolve to shut down his opponent (usually the other team's high scorer, often even at the small forward position) disrupted the bad guys' game plan more than if DeBusschere went out and scored 30 points.\n\nNo player was tougher, and no guy worked harder. DeBusschere was the unsung hero of both of New York's championships.\n\nNo. 6 DOLPH SCHAYES\n\nDolph Schayes' rough-and-tumble game was made for the pros, and indeed he was a much better player with the Syracuse Nationals than he ever was at New York University.\n\nHe put up points (18.2 over 16 seasons) with a high-arcing, two-hand set, with fearless drives into the lane and superb marksmanship at the foul line. Schayes led the NBA in free throw percentage in 1957-58, 1959-60 and 1961-62. He was also a savvy passer and determined rebounder (pacing the league in 1950-51 with 16.4 per game). Schayes may have been a belligerent (and slow-footed) defender, but most of his fouls left opponents with bruises.\n\nAs mild-mannered as he was off the court, Schayes played in a fury once the lights were switched on, How tough was he? He once broke his right arm during the prime of his career and proceeded to shoot left handed, using the cast to club his way to the basket.\n\nSchayes was an All-NBA First Team selection six times over, and was the primary reason why the Nationals were NBA champs in 1955. He was also one of the few players who had All-Star seasons both before and after the installation of the 24-second shot clock.\n\nDennis Rodman proved that defense wins championships. (Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images)\n\nNo. 7 DENNIS RODMAN\n\nDespite his zany lifestyle, Dennis Rodman was the ultimate role player. Defense, rebounding and running the court were his contributions to a slew of championships with Detroit and Chicago. For sheer athleticism, no other power forward could compare with Rodman.\n\nUnbeknownst to many casual basketball fans, Rodman was also an incredibly intelligent player. Whereas Karl Malone could never absorb even the most basic elements of the triangle offense, Rodman mastered every intricacy in his first training camp with Chicago.\n\nNot as physically strong as DeBusschere, and (besides put-backs and fast-break flashes) never being a scoring threat, Rodman was a more versatile defender than the Knicks' Hall of Famer in that he could throw a net over shooting guards, small forwards, power forward and centers.\n\nLike Bill Russell before him, Rodman proved that defense wins championships.\n\nJust missing the cut:\n\n# Bobby Jones\n\n# Jerry Lucas\n\n# Vern Mikkelsen\n\n# James Worthy\n\n# Gus Johnson.\n\nMissing in action:\n\n# Kevin Garnett — hasn't been there, hasn't done that.\n\n# Charles Barkley — only played defense when the spirit moved him. He routinely came into training camp grossly overweight, and then chastised his teammates for being out of shape.\n\n# Elvin Hayes — awful defense, awful fundamentals, awful attitude.\n\n# Bob McAdoo — soft, selfish and defenseless.\n\nBest all-time centers\n\nThe biggest of the bigs are (or should be) always in the middle of the action.\n\nThey are the most dangerous offensive forces simply because defenses are usually most vulnerable in direct proportion to how close the ball is to the basket. Conversely, centers provide the last line of defense for their teams. That's why they are typically the most dominant and important players on their teams.\n\n#1 — BILL RUSSELL\n\nBill Russell was so good that he revolutionized the game. Even the most casual NBA fans know that Russell was an outstanding rebounder and shot-blocker. He led the NBA five times in the former category and finished with a lifetime per game average of 22.5 rebounds. Unfortunately, the NBA didn't officially record blocked shots until 1973-74, four seasons after Russell retired. But what first-hand witnesses can testify to, however, is that Russell's timing and quick-lift were so uncanny that he could keep his feet on the court until the ball left the shooter's hand and still deflect the shot. At the same time, Russell had the knack of hitting the ball so that it remained in bounds and could therefore be recovered by the defense. That's how he turned layups into short-jumpers, short-jumpers into mid-range jumpers and mid-range jumpers into long-range jumpers.\n\nIn half-court sets, he scored with an accurate lefty hook, numerous put-backs and an occasional low-flying, wrist-snapping cross between a jumper and a one-handed set shot. During his 13 seasons with Boston, Russ tallied 15.1 ppg. But Russell was also one of the most fleet-footed centers of his time. Indeed, if his defensive rebounds and accurate outlet passes ignited Boston's famous running game, Russell's speed enabled the Celtics to run a five-man fast break. Accordingly, many of his points came via dunk shots on the trail end of the breaks.\n\nBefore every season, Wilt Chamberlain would establish his own overriding priority. (Wen Roberts-NBA Photos / Getty Images)\n\nHe was much stronger than his 6-foot-10, 220-pound frame suggested. He had great hands, an unconquerable will to win, thorough understanding of every nuance (physical and psychological) and a willingness to sublimate his ego for the sake of team goals.\n\nRussell's five MVP trophies (1958, 1961-63, 1965) and 11 rings proved for all time that defense wins championships.\n\n#2 — KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR\n\nPutting the ball through the orange ring was always Kareem's specialty, as evidenced by the fact that he's the NBA's all-time leading scorer — a 20-year total of 38,387 that averages out to 24.6 ppg.\n\nHe was an active rebounder and shot-blocker when he was young, but defense wasn't really his forte. Despite his being named to five NBA All-Defensive teams, his lateral movement wasn't terrific and he rarely ventured too far from the shadow of the basket. With his dreadnaught sky-hook as his primary weapon, however, Kareem shot a fantastic 55.9 percent over his entire career! He could also spin and bank angle-jumpers, as well as turn offensive rebounds into dunkers.\n\nAn opponent's only hope was to be physical in defense of Kareem (always making sure to avoid being pronged by his sharp, aggressive elbows), and hope that he'd be weary in the end-game. He was an effective passer, so double-teaming wasn't much of an option, and was, in fact, an illegal tactic until late in Abdul-Jabbar's career. The only other effective strategy was to counter him with a hot-shooting center — which were scarce in those days — and attack Kareem with high screen/rolls. But whatever measures were taken to try to control his high-altitude offense, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was always the \"center\"-piece of the action.\n\nHis Hall-of-Fame resume includes a record six MVP awards (1971-'72, '74, '76-'77, 1980) and a like number of NBA championships. He was playing championship basketball at age 42 and could have continued for a few more years — but the league's referees were tired of Kareem and started to whistle him for charging fouls, hacks, traveling and palming violations that they'd been excusing for so long.\n\nIf Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's intense pride bordered on arrogance, his on-court excellence could only inspire admiration and awe.\n\n#3 — SHAQUILLE O'NEAL\n\nHis Bigness (including his mouth, girth, intelligence, sense of humor and accomplishments) is still on the scene. For sure, he's slow off the floor, a limited rebounder, and a mostly stationary defender — but Shaq remains one of the best ever. Aside from Kevin McHale, Shaq has more moves at his disposal in the pivot than anyone else in the record book.\n\nRussell was better on defense and infinitely more dominant. Abdul-Jabbar could score more points more efficiently. And, although Shaq has spent many seasons out of shape, struggling with injuries, and/or giving in to his own ennui, he's still more consistently competitive than was Chamberlain.\n\n#4 — WILT CHAMBERLAIN\n\nThe only aspect of his game that prevented Chamberlain from leading the big man parade was his gargantuan ego. Before every season, Wilt would establish his own overriding priority, which was usually to lead the NBA in scoring (which he did from 1959-66), or rebounding (1959-63, '65-'69, '70-'73). One year (1967-68), the Big Dipper decided he'd be the NBA's leading passer. Therefore, instead of simply dunking unopposed offensive rebounds, Chamberlain would pass the ball out to Hal Greer — a reliable sharpshooter. And when all the numbers were tabulated at season's end, Chamberlain had accumulated a league-best 8.6 assists per game.\n\nThe trouble was that Chamberlain rarely focused on winning championships. He did win with the 1966-67 Philadelphia Warriors, but only after coach Alex Hannum shoved Wilt against a locker and threatened to smash his face if he didn't play the game the right way. Wilt's other title, with the 1971-72 L.A. Lakers, was motivated by coach Bill Sharman's slick psychology. \"I'd just keep asking him questions about strategy,\" says Sharman, \"until Wilt came up with the right answer. Then I'd tell him how smart he was and what a great idea he'd come up with. Thinking that every important strategy was his, Wilt played championship ball.\"\n\nBill Walton's heart, talent and understanding of the game were always in tip-top condition, even if his ankles weren't. (NBA Photos / Getty Images)\n\n#5 — GEORGE MIKAN\n\nThe Babe Ruth of the NBA, Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers were the league's first dynasty, winning titles in 1949, '50 and '52-54 (plus two previous championships in the NBL). Big George was bigger, stronger, smarter, meaner and more fundamentally sound than his peers. He scored with right- and left-handed hooks and pivot shots (an extinct art form that was midway between an authentic hook and a jump hook), step-back one-handed flips and put-backs. From 1946-54, Mikan was scoring in the mid- to upper 20s at a time when a player's scoring 15 points was deemed to be a heroic effort. Mikan was his league-of-the-moment's leading point-maker in six of his nine pro seasons.\n\nThe NBA revised its rules on several occasions to hinder Mikan — including widening the lane, raising the basket to 12 feet, granting defensive players both inside lane spots on free throws and outlawing offensive goal tending. It was the 24-second shot clock (mandated for the 1954-56 season) that finally terminated Mikan's effectiveness and his career (except for a part-time comeback to play with his brother Ed in 1955-56).\n\nDuring his short-lived hey day, Mikan was as dominant in his own fashion as were Russell and Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n#6 — HAKEEM OLAJUWON\n\nHakeem Olajuwon was easily the most athletic of the top-ranked centers. In truth, he was a power forward successfully masquerading as a center.\n\nWhen he first came into the league in 1984, Olajuwon relied mostly on a super-swift drop-step to generate his scoring opportunities. Then he learned to fake the drop-step and make a counter move — the turnaround jumper. From there, his offensive repertoire expanded in quantum leaps — face-up jumpers, drives and spins, jump hooks. Eventually, he became a virtually unstoppable scorer who concluded 19 seasons averaging 21.8 ppg.\n\nAnd his defense was even better. Hakeem was incredibly quick to the ball. He led the NBA three times in blocked shots with a high of 4.59 per game in 1989-90, and is the NBA's career leader in that area. With his long arms and explosive hops, Olajuwon was also a dynamic rebounder — twice leading the league. But it was his incredible speed and single-minded desire to get a piece of every shot taken in his vicinity that also got him into chronic foul trouble.\n\nWhat couldn't he do? Make accurate passes on a regular basis and dribble the ball in traffic.\n\nHakeem paced the Houston Rockets to back-to-back championships from 1994-95. Through it all, Olajuwon never cut a corner, never gave less than his best and was always a responsible citizen on and off the court.\n\n#7 — NATE THURMOND\n\nThis guy was simply a monster on defense. At 6-foot-11, 245 pounds, he was big, strong, active and intense. He could also score — mostly on offensive rebounds, jump hooks and backboard-rattling bank shots from 10 feet and in. But forget about the several seasons where Thurmond averaged 20-plus points a game (1967-72), his focus was on shutting down his opponents' numbers.\n\nHis battles with Chamberlain were legendary. Thurmond was the only defender who could get his hands on and totally negate Chamberlain's trademark finger-roll. Thurmond was just as determined to snare every missed shot. He finished his injury-wracked 14-year career averaging 15.0 rebounds per contest — and twice he averaged more than 20 caroms.\n\nThurmond played in an almost forgotten age where giants roamed the paint. Not only did he hold his own against the likes of Chamberlain, Abdul-Jabbar and Bob Lanier, he made them sweat for every shot and dispensed a bruise for every score.\n\n#8 — BILL WALTON\n\nThe redhead was fully healthy for only 2 3/4 seasons: In 1976-77, when he keyed the Trail Blazers to a championship, and in '86, when he contributed valuable sixth-man-minutes to Boston's title run. In 1977-78, Walton played in only 58 games but was still honored as the league's MVP. During his entire career (1974-88), Walton missed four complete seasons with foot and ankle injuries.\n\nWhen his wheels were sound, Walton could run, rebound and block shots (he led the league in both categories in 1976-77). He was totally committed to a team concept and, although he could score on jump hooks, bank shots and a variety of sudden drives and twisting moves, he scored only when he had to. In his best offensive season (1978-79), Walton scored 18.9 ppg, and finished his career with an impressive field goal accuracy of 52.1 percent.\n\nHe was a talented, and an unselfish ball distributor. Moreover, his defense was routinely outstanding whether throwing a bag over his individual opponent or rotating to help-spots in Jack Ramsay's crafty schemes.\n\nWalton's career was blighted, however, when he signed a free-agent contract with the San Diego Clippers in 1979. At the time, the Clips were strictly an individualistic ball club, so Walton was forced to show his new teammates what he could do in one-on-one situations. This just wasn't enough to either make a difference or find his own comfort zone.\n\nDespite the fact that Walton is the NBA's all-time leader in foot-and-ankle surgeries, his heart, talent and understanding of the game were always in tip-top condition.\n\nSlightly off-center\n\n# David Robinson — too soft and too clutchless to succeed without being carried by Tim Duncan.\n\n# Moses Malone — a tireless rebounder who was disinclined to pass, play defense or let any teammate take more shots than he did.\n\n# Bob Lanier — no defense to speak of.\n\n# Neil Johnston — the real deal as long as he lasted.\n\n# Wes Unseld and Willis Reed — courage and toughness personified.\n\n# Jerry Lucas — great hands, shooting range and perhaps the most intelligent practitioner of the art and science of playing the five-spot.\n\nAll-time best sixth men\n\nThe concept of the sixth man was hatched in the mid-1950's and blossomed in the 1960's. The progenitor was one of pro basketball's greatest innovators — Red Auerbach.\n\nBefore Auerbach got his brainstorm, teams used to start their best players and then relieve them with players of lesser ability. Auerbach changed the protocol so that at least one of his best players would be playing against the opponents' bench players. But this \"extra starter\" couldn't start the game lest his playing time become too burdensome.\n\nFrank Ramsey, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound jackrabbit from the University of Kentucky was Auerbach's experimental model. Ramsey was a clutch shooter who also drew an extraordinary number of fouls. First, Auerbach had to convince Ramsey that finishing a game was more important than starting it. Then, he had to pay Ramsey as much as a starting player.\n\nSince then, the sixth man has become a necessary weapon in every team's arsenal — an impact player who could twist a game with a pass, a jumper, a drive, or a steal. Most specialize in immediate offense, while others focus on defense.\n\nBecause the league's overall talent is periodically diluted by expansion, many sixth men eventually become full-time starters.\n\nNo.1 — JOHN HAVLICEK\n\nThere were no holes in Hondo's game. He could change from a whippet playmaker to a steel-beam shouldered presence in the paint as quick as a wish. When he was playing only 30 or so minutes per game, he didn't have to worry about foul trouble or fatigue — so he was even more frenetic than he was as a starter. Off the bench, Havlicek could spark the Celtics' running game into overdrive.\n\nJohn Havlicek had the complete game, and he didn't mind coming off the bench to show it off. ( Rich Pilling/NBAE/ / Getty Images)\n\nIrresistible, relentless, resourceful, dependable — John Havlicek was all these and more.\n\nNo. 2 — KEVIN McHALE\n\nMcHale spent the first six years of his Celtic career as the team's featured substitute. He'd simply be plugged into the pivot and fed the ball. McHale was literally unstoppable when matched against the league's second-stringers.\n\nNo. 3 — FRANK RAMSEY\n\nA win-place-and-show trifecta for the Celtics. From 1954 to 1964, Ramsey averaged 13.4 points per game for Boston. He played on seven championship teams, and in virtually every category his numbers were better in the playoffs than in the regular season.\n\nA pioneer who set the standard.\n\nNo. 4 — BILLY CUNNINGHAM\n\nBilly C. was Philadelphia's sixth man for four seasons (1965-68), and his high-flying energy helped propel the team to a championship in 1967.\n\nNo. 5 - MICHAEL COOPER\n\nMC was a defensive stopper during the glory years (1978-90) of the Showtime Lakers. He eventually became an adequate long-range bomber (34 percent lifetime from downtown), a clever ball-handler and excellent passer. But tough, scampering defense was his specialty. At 6-foot-7, 170 pounds, Cooper could be sicced on point guards, shooting guards and small forwards.\n\nIn all, Cooper started only 94 of the 873 games he played with Los Angeles. As a starter, he played about 30 minutes and could control the man he was assigned to defend. As a sub, Cooper's playing time was limited to 20 minutes per game, and he could absolutely lock his man up.\n\nCooper's comparative successes as a starter and a sub illustrates the trickiest aspect of properly utilizing a sixth man — the more he plays the more he is apt to lose sight of his designated specialty.\n\nNo. 6 — VINNIE JOHNSON\n\nThe Microwave could heat up in an instant. He was a sturdy 6-foot-2, 200-pounder with muscles on his muscles. Indeed, he was strong enough to make even big men back off. Johnson was an incredibly talented one-on-one player equipped with accurate springers, powerhouse drives, and an occasional 3-pointer. For his size, Johnson was also a dangerous offensive rebounder.\n\nVinnie \"The Microwave\" Johnson could get hot in a hurry and provide instant offense for the Pistons. (Tim Defrisco/NBAE/ / Getty Images)\n\nWhile VJ was hard at work, his teammates were mostly relieved of the pressure to score and could catch an on-the-job breather. True, they often had to cover for Johnson's defensive lapses at the other end. But the formula worked well enough for the Pistons to cop back-to-back championships (1990-91) during Johnson's part-time reign of terror.\n\nNo. 7 — RICKY PIERCE\n\nPierce was instant points for several teams during his 16-season tenure in the NBA. Forget about rebounds, passes, and anything more than an obligatory effort on defense. Pierce shot first and never asked questions.\n\nIn his prime (1989-1991), Pierce averaged well over 20 points per game off the bench for Milwaukee and Seattle. He measured 6-foot-4 and a mighty 220 pounds. He used screens to perfection, and his quick release made his catch-and-shoot response an awe-inspiring weapon. Pierce could also use his strength to venture into the paint for fun and profit — he was always among the league leaders in free-throw percentage.\n\nPierce's career exemplifies the modern-day sixth man — almost strictly a point-maker with little aptitude for defense.\n\nNo. 8 — BOBBY JONES\n\nAt 6-foot-9 and 205 pounds, Bobby Jones seemed frail and hunched. His features were sharp, his smile humble. Yet in very subtle ways, Jones' presence could rule a ball game. He covered up for his teammates' mistakes on defense. He boxed out so well that the other big men could release downcourt. He filled a lane on the break as though Dean Smith's stare was still on his back.\n\nNot that Jones was a chump on the offensive end. He was a high-percentage jump shooter (55 percent for his NBA career, 59.2 percent in the ABA). He was also a swooper and a dunker. Playing for Denver (in both leagues) and Philadelphia, Jones's 12-year career produced nearly 13 points per game.\n\nNo. 9 — DETLEF SCHREMPF\n\nThis guy could score in bunches (14.1 ppg for 15 seasons), and, given his slender physique (6-10, 230) was a surprisingly effective rebounder. His defense was limited to an occasional steal and blocked shot. But he was a runner, a post-feeder, and a facilitator.\n\nMaking an entry pass into the pivot is a rather arcane skill, but a vital one. In fact, Schrempf always knew where and when the big men wanted the ball. He could read slight shifts in balance and detect widening and narrowing angles — so much so that his incoming passes frequently signaled the recipients exactly in which direction they should attack the rim. That's why bigs loved to team up with him.\n\nSchrempf also made sure that whatever offensive or defensive set was supposed to be run was executed to perfection. Sure, he could fill a scorebook with admirable numbers, yet Detlef Schrempf's most significant contributions occurred were much more esoteric.\n\nAlmost there — Bill Walton had one spectacular year as Boston's sixth man in 1986. Calvin Murphy was a superb stop-and-pop scorer, but was too vertically challenged to play adequate defense. Phil Jackson majored in defense, execution, and a lefty hook. Junior Bridgeman, Antawn Jamison, Corliss Williamson, Cazzie Russell. Toni Kukoc was pretty much defenseless, but was also one of the great all-time clutch shooters.\n\nNBA's top all-time coaches\n\nContrary to popular belief, NBA coaches are miles ahead of their undergraduate brethren.\n\nThe huge difference in the level of talent alone creates unique complications and possibilities: The playbook of the average NBA team is at least five times thicker.\n\nNBA scouting reports and game videos also breed unparalleled familiarity. NBA players often remain with the same team longer than do college players. There's less practice time in the pros. More traveling. Better officiating. Fewer patsies on the schedule. Much more money (most of it guaranteed). More publicity.\n\nThe wonderful world of the NBA also has its share of knuckleheads, criminals and narcissists. To be a successful NBA coach is an incredible accomplishment, while most NBA coaches could probably coach college games from a rocking chair.\n\nAside from an abiding technical knowledge of the game, the superior NBA coach must be able to communicate with his players without creating undue stress. If he never lies to them (because players always know when their coach is fibbing, and vice versa), he must be able to deliver only as much of the truth as is useful. He must respect his players and be respected by them. He must understand that fans pay to see players play, not coaches coach. And he must push himself harder than his hardest-working player.\n\nGood coaches can make a difference and so can bad coaches. But even the best coaches can be stymied by having inferior players. Despite that fact, the good coaches tend to get the best jobs, and bad coaches usually wind up with the worst jobs. So the following ratings are not totally dependent on playoff appearances or championships won.\n\nNo. 1 — PHIL JACKSON\n\nOne of the most difficult tasks for any coach is to win when he's supposed to win. There is minimal pressure on coaches of sad-sack and mediocre teams to win championships, but woe to the favorite who flops before the finish line.\n\nPhil Jackson realizes the coach is essentially an outsider, a civilian who comes to games dressed in a jacket and necktie. (Lisa Blumenfeld / Getty Images)\n\nWhy?\n\nOutstanding teams generally feature players who possess the most colossal egos because even the league's lowliest teams get up to play an elite opponent. And because players with talent to spare often tend to play light-switch basketball — thinking they can cruise through major portions of a game and then turn on their star-power in the end.\n\nPhil Jackson has surmounted these front-running difficulties at least nine times. But to say that he won only because he had the likes of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Shaq and Kobe is far from the truth. The telling statistic here is that Shaq and MJ had each been ring-less in the league for six years prior to PJ coming to town. In truth, Jackson is the best closer ever — the Mariano Rivera of the NBA.\n\nHe succeeds because his system, the triangle, is flawless when the players are in synch. And because he can convince the vast majority of his players that the personal sacrifices necessary for the triangle to succeed will benefit everyone. The only players who have resisted Jackson's geometric arguments have been Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice.\n\nBut there's much more than Xs and Os involved in Jackson's stunning successes. He also realizes that the coach is essentially an outsider, a civilian who comes to games dressed in a jacket and necktie. That's why discipline and motivation must ultimately be generated by the players themselves. And that's Jackson's game plan — to create an environment where the players can form and police their own community.\n\nAnd that's why critics who say that Jackson is a do-nothing coach can't tell a speed cut from pinch-post.\n\nNo. 2 — RED AUERBACH\n\nRed Auerbach owed much of the credit for his coaching achievements to the ministrations of Red Auerbach in his other guise as the Celtic in charge of basketball operations. Indeed, it was Auerbach's trading of Cliff Hagen and Ed Macauley for Bill Russell in 1956 that ignited the Celtics' unsurpassable mastery of the NBA — 11 championships in the next 13 seasons. Auerbach was also the prime mover in the Celtics' trading Joe Barry Carroll for Robert Parish, in drafting John Havlicek and Kevin McHale and in picking Larry Bird when he was draft-eligible after his junior year at Indiana State.\n\nRed Auerbach's genius emerged when he stole Bill Russell from the St. Louis Hawks. (Neil Leifer / FOXSports.com)\n\nMotivating players was much easier in Auerbach's Boston tenure (1950-1966) only because if they missed out on playoff dividends, players had to find tiresome summer employment. Even so, he was always concerned with team chemistry, and Auerbach always did a masterful job of finding the perfect player to fit whatever role the Celtics required to maintain their dynasty.\n\nHis Redness also made it quite clear exactly what each player was supposed to accomplish. From setting picks, filling fast break lanes, playing rugged defense, rebounding, passing, delivering sternum smashes to being in the right place at the right time. Every aspect of the game had its designated practitioner.\n\nBut Auerbach's genius emerged totally after stealing Russell from the St. Louis Hawks: The 24-second shot clock was installed for the 1954-55 season, but none of the contemporary coaches knew what adjustments should be made. For the most part, the procedure was to run the same offenses (and defenses) that preceded the clock, and some players would hurry up and launch shots whenever the clock was set to detonate.\n\nAuerbach, however, instituted the modern game — on defense, that meant funneling the ball into Russell, then turning the resultant blocked shots, steals and rebounds into up-tempo offense.\n\nSure, Auerbach was obnoxious, with his victory cigars, incessant baiting of the refs and clogged toilets in the visitors' locker rooms prearranged to annoy and distract opponents. But he created advantages out of nothing.\n\nThere'll never be another coach quite like Auerbach.\n\nNo. 3 — RED HOLZMAN\n\nRed Holzman practiced what he preached — teamwork, trust, the accumulation of details and resourcefulness in the clutch. Even when the Knicks' game plan was to always hit the open man, Holzman was forever undercover. He never said anything meaningful to create any kind of ruckus in the media. He took no credit, but assumed all the blame.\n\nHolzman's Knicks played ferocious defense, frequently played topsy-turvy basketball (posting the guards, Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe, while Dave DeBusschere and Jerry Lucas fired away from the next time zone), led the league in three-quarter-court presses and pioneered the utilization of a pressing-trapping second unit. Holzman also believed that role players were extremely valuable. He went so far as to use Mike Riordan as the team's designated fouler.\n\nDuring timeouts, Holzman routinely asked his players what was going on out there and what plays they thought would be appropriate. However, only the Knicks' veterans dared to voice their opinions. Holzman never did trust rookies.\n\nA master psychologist, Holzman also knew when to kick a butt and when to pat a back. He was a wizened, shabbily-dressed and vastly underrated genius who shunned the spotlight. In his own quiet and self-deprecating fashion, Holzman inspired the unbridled respect of his peers and the run-through-a-wall loyalty of his players.\n\nNo. 4 — PAT RILEY\n\nIn addition to being one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, Pat Riley was also one of the most flexible. His teams were always immaculately prepared for every ball game, and in Los Angeles, he just wound his guys up and let them go. His strategies never got in the way of the likes of Magic, Kareem, Big Game James and Silk. But the Showtime Lakers' early offense was the most intricate and explosive in the league.\n\nDespite that fact, Riley's colossal ego insisted on taking more credit for the Lakers' perpetual successes than the players were willing to yield. The result was an exit stage left for Mister Hollywood Slick.\n\nWhen he moved on to New York, Riley changed his game plan and the Knicks were fashioned in the image of the Detroit Bad Boys. Smash-mouth defense. Hard fouls delivered early, late and always. Mayhem in the paint. And a tongue-lashing and $2,000 fine for any Knick who lent a hand to help a fallen foe to his feet!\n\nRiley likewise changed his look in the Big Apple, filling his closets with Armani suits, and he was more dapper and sophisticated than thou.\n\nIn Miami, Riley inherited a ball club that couldn't score with a pencil. So he slowed the game down to a painful crawl, had his players assault both backboards and play vicious defense. The rumor out of Miami is that Riley has also taken to wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, calf-high support-hose and frequenting only those restaurants that offer early-bird specials.\n\nNo. 5 — LENNY WILKENS\n\nLenny Wilkens coached the way he played — suave, dignified and effective. (Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images)\n\nLenny Wilkens coached the way he played — suave, dignified and as effective as a silent stiletto. In his hey day with Seattle and Cleveland, Wilkens' offenses were things of beauty. The spacing discouraged double-teams. The off-the-ball movement was crisp and productive. His players' talents were maximized and their deficiencies were minimized. But Lenny's strategies required a certain degree of sophistication from his players. That's why green-horns were always glued to the bench. But as the league became younger it seemed the players' basketball IQs weren't up to par. Wilkens struggled to maintain the required level of necessary communication. The very last resort in his wonderfully orchestrated offenses was usually some kind of screen-and-roll. In Atlanta, however, his young charges habitually went to the S/R as their first option.\n\nFrom that point on, Wilkens was mostly reduced to being a relic of the NBA's glory days. In Toronto, he tried motivating his players by using Bob Pettit as an example of toughness and grit. But some Raptors may not have even known who Wilkens was talking about. The only \"Pettitte\" many of them had probably ever heard of pitched for the New York Yankees. By the time Wilkens arrived in New York, he'd totally lost his edge.\n\nAh, but in the blessed springtime of his coaching career, Lenny Wilkens was the cream of the crop.\n\nNo. 6 — GREGG POPOVICH\n\nTough love is Pop's modus operandi. Not to mention recognizing and nurturing talent that fits his system. Planning for the future. Making uncanny between and in-game adjustments. Walking the fine line between being passionately involved in the action and maintaining an objective distance. And never getting trumped in game-time matchups.\n\nNor does Popovich suffer fools gladly. Yes, he can be patient with young bucks like Tony Parker, but an overly prolonged apprenticeship results in bench-time and face-to-face scoldings.\n\nHis teams showcase the quickest defensive rotations in recent memory, along with the ability to play any kind of tempo. Moreover, his players hang on his every word and are always willing to go to war for him.\n\nThat's because honesty is Popovich's only policy.\n\nNo. 7 — BILL SHARMAN\n\nBill Sharman's influence is still felt in the NBA. His development of the game-day shoot around was directly responsible for improving the overall quality of play. By having to get out of bed, running up and down the court to work up a light sweat and be able to walk through the scouting report for the upcoming opponent, players have generally been more focused, alert and more familiar with the hows and whys of their next matchup. Also, by making gross adjustments during the shoot around, coaches were able to make much more subtle adjustments during the subsequent game.\n\nBesides this radical innovation, Sharman forced his players to pay meticulous attention to every detail, every play and every possibility. He led the decidedly mediocre San Francisco Warriors into the finals in 1967, then did a masterful job with the 1971-72 L.A. Lakers — a team whose most recent coach (Joe Mullany) had been dismissed as being old and selfish.\n\nSharman, however, forced Elgin Baylor into retirement and convinced the rest of the over-the-hill-gang to run all season long. The Lakers proceeded to run their way to a record 33-game win streak and a championship.\n\nSharman's prowess as a master psychologist was demonstrated by his being able to somehow convince the 35-year-old Wilt Chamberlain to play like Bill Russell.\n\nJack Ramsay was always able to get the best out of his players. (Jim Cummins / Getty Images)\n\nNo. 8 — JACK RAMSAY\n\nDr. Jack's 1976-77 Portland Trail Blazers were perhaps the most disciplined NBA team ever. Bill Walton, Maurice Lucas, Lionel Hollins, Bobby Gross, Larry Steele, Dave Twardzik, Herm Gilliam, Johnny Davis and Lloyd Neal teamed up like they'd been playing together all their lives. Every move was perfectly choreographed by Ramsay. Every player was eager to sublimate his own personal glory for the good of the team.\n\nThroughout his coaching career, Ramsay was always able to get the best out of his players. And he proved again and again that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nNo. 9 — ALEX HANNUM\n\nDuring his nine-year playing career, Hannum was a tough guy. He valued setting devastating screens more than he valued scoring points. Defense was more important than offense. And all-out hustle was the norm.\n\nThe teams he coached — St. Louis, Syracuse, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and San Diego — were fashioned in his image. His championship 1966-67 Sixers were arguably the best of all time, but they were certainly the most powerful: Wilt in his prime, Lucious Jackson, Chet Walker, Dave Gambee. They made every foul a painful experience, loosened opponents' dental filings with their hearty screens, and savagely attacked the basket.\n\nIt was Hannum's killer-eyed toughness that settled Chamberlain — by shoving Wilt into a locker and threatening to kick his butt unless he played the game according to Hannum's dictates. Forget about Hannum's successful seasons, any coach who could back down the Biggest Dipper deserves to be ranked among the elite.\n\nNo. 10 — LARRY BROWN\n\nLarry \"Get Out of Town\" Brown is the Billy Martin of NBA coaches. A quick fix whose incessant yipping, nagging, hogging of the spotlight and yearning to venture into greener pastures sooner rather than later manages to alienate his players.\n\nThere's no questioning Brown's ability to rev up a team and to devise a game plan that perfectly fits his personnel. But his I-won-they-lost attitude also undercuts his relationships with his players. On the technical side of the game, Brown tends to be so stubborn as to make poor game-to-game adjustments in playoff situations.\n\nHe wonders why no one ever believes his latest pronouncements about his intentions. Larry, it's because you've told too many lies for too many years.\n\nStill, if he's here today and gone tomorrow, while he's in town, Larry Brown always makes a difference.\n\nOn the cusp:\n\n# Dick Motta\n\n# Chuck Daly\n\n# Gene Shue\n\nNBA's greatest all-time teams Nos. 13-9\n\nDuring the 59 years since the NBA first began play, many teams have totally dominated their competition.\n\nThere have been five repeat champs — Minneapolis 1949-50; Boston 1968-69; LA Lakers 1987-88; Detroit 1989-90; Houston 1994-95. Four three-peat champs — Minneapolis 1952-54; Chicago 1991-93, 1996-98; LA Lakers 2000-02. And the Celtics had an unparalleled run from 1959 to 1966.\n\nAll of these teams (and more) are obviously among the most elite squads in NBA history. How, then, to evaluate which of them are the best of the best? The only way is to project how they would fare against each other — and that's exactly how the following rankings have been determined.\n\nAfter studying the rosters, the records, the styles of play, as well as the available competition, this initial installment includes the lowest tier of the thirteen most powerful ball clubs in NBA history.\n\nNo. 13 1949-50 MINNEAPOLIS LAKERS\n\nRECORD 51-17, OFFENSE – 84.1 PPG (2nd in league), DEFENSE – 75.7 (1st)\n\nThe bulwark of the team was George Mikan — 27.4 ppg (1st) — the most unstoppable pivot-man of the pre-shot-clock era. Rebounds were not recorded until the following season, but Mikan was also a big-time board-man.\n\nThe power-forward was Vern Mikkelsen (11.6 ppg) another powerhouse force in the shadow of the basket. In addition to his scoring prowess, Mikkelsen was also a top-notch rebounder and defender.\n\nJim Pollard manned the other frontcourt spot (14.7 ppg, 3.8 assists). Noted for his leaping ability, Pollard was the Lakers' most electric player — and one of the few in the pioneer days of the NBA who could have succeeded in the modern game.\n\nThree guards received the important playing time: Slater Martin (4.0 ppg), Arnie Ferrin (5.4 ppg) and Herm Schaefer (5.1 ppg). They were all smart and swift, possessed of accurate shots and trustworthy entry passes into the Big Man.\n\nThe most noteworthy substitutes were whichever guard didn't start, plus Bob Harrison (4.5 ppg), Don Carlson (4.7ppg) and Tony Jaros (3.9 ppg). A rarely used bench player was Bud Grant (2.6 ppg) who was destined to become an outstanding coach in the NFL.\n\nThe Lakers' game plan was simple: Play head-banging defense, control the boards, then feed the rock to Mikan. With Mikan and Mikkelsen, Minneapolis simply out-sized and over-powered their opponents. (Only one opponent could contain Mikan — 6-foot-5 Nat \"Sweetwater\" Clifton of the Knickerbockers.) Sure, their guards (and Pollard) were quick, but fast breaks were verboten.\n\nThere's no way this team could have kept up with today's up-tempo game. Also, Mikan and Mikkelsen were the only big men on the roster — the next tallest player was Pollard at 6-foot-5.\n\nToo small, too slow, and not enough depth to compete with the other outstanding teams.\n\nNo. 12 1993-94 HOUSTON ROCKETS\n\nRECORD – 58-24, OFFENSE – 101.1 (13th), DEFENSE – 96.8 (5th)\n\nThe Rockets were essentially a one-man team, and Hakeem Olajuwon's talents covered every aspect of the game — 27.3 ppg (3rd); 11.9 R (4th); 3.71 BS (2nd); .528 FG% (10th); and he was also Houston's third-leading playmaker. A unique blend of strength and quickness, Olajuwon also had the heart of a lion.\n\nOtis Thorpe manned the power-forward slot and averaged 14.0 points a game and 10.5 rebounds. Active and tough, Thorpe never took bad shots and always played hard.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon had all the right moves for the Rockets, who beat the Knicks in the 1994 NBA Finals. (Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via / Getty Images)\n\nIn those days, Robert Horry (9.9 ppg) was considered to be a softie who took too many 3s, and could be overwhelmed in the low post. Still, he was quick, smart, and a big-play guy.\n\nKenny Smith (11.6 ppg) was a clever passer and an outstanding long-ball shooter (.405 3-PT%). He had quick feet and quick hands. But it was his 3-balls that made opponents pay for double-teaming Olajuwon.\n\nVernon Maxwell (13.8 ppg) would rather shoot than pass or defend. Good shots, bad shots, they were all the same. He was a streak shooter who could shoot the Rockets into, and out of, any game.\n\nThe most important subs were Mario Elie (9.3 ppg) a solid defender, and improving 3-point shooter; and Sam Cassell (6.7 ppg) who couldn't defend, but could create his own shots.\n\nThis team could run and rebound, but depended more on finesse than on muscle. Also on the debit side of the ledger was the erratic play of Maxwell, Cassell's lack of defense, and the lack of frontline depth. There's no way this edition of the Houston Rockets could quick-and-slick their way to more than a modest share of wins against the NBA's upper-echelon teams.\n\nNo. 11 1970-71 MILWAUKEE BUCKS\n\nRECORD 66-16, OFFENSE – 118.4 (1st), DEFENSE – 106.2 (3rd)\n\nThe Bucks had been called \"the greatest team in history\" by a prominent sports magazine, and the primary source of the team's greatness was its young center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (31.7 ppg (1st); 16.0 R (4th); .577 FG% (2nd)). With his incomparable sky-hook, Abdul-Jabbar was a monster in the middle. If, in his second NBA season, Kareem lacked the bulk of Wilt Chamberlain or the coiled reflexes of Bill Russell, he played with an effortlessness that bordered on contempt for his opponents.\n\nWhat, then, did Kareem lack? Power and endurance.\n\nThe second of Milwaukee's dual carburetors was Oscar Robertson (19.4 ppg; 8.3 A (3rd); .496 FG% (11th); .850 FT% (2nd)). At age 34, the Big O was on the downside of a fantastic career, yet he could still do everything at the highest level. Rebound. Pass. Set picks. Dribble. Box out. Run. Create, and make, his own shots. Shut anybody down on defense. Play virtually errorless ball. O was so strong that his teammates called him \"Horse.\" He could do everything but jump and touch the sky.\n\nAt one forward position was Bobby Dandridge (18.4 ppg; .507 FG% (7th)). Tricky, tough, a deadly mid-range shooter, and an above-average defender.\n\nThe other half of Milwaukee's pint-sized brace of forwards was Greg Smith (11.7 ppg; .512 FG% (6th)). Smith provided speed and defense.\n\nWorking beside Robertson was Jon McGlocklin (15.8 ppg; .535 FG% (4th))the Bucks' only perimeter threat, but slow afoot and defensively challenged.\n\nOff the bench came Lucius Allen (7.1 ppg) whose forte was quick slashes into the paint. Unfortunately, Allen's favorite real estate was usually occupied by Abdul-Jabbar, so Allen was reduced to wild shots and reckless gambles.\n\nBob Boozer (9.1 ppg) was a rock-steady power forward and deadly shooter from either baseline. Defense was Boozer's main problem.\n\nThe coach was Larry Costello, a nagging, always intense presence who inspired loathing on the part of his players. Precision was Costello's constant theme, and the team had over fifty ways in which to get the ball inside to Kareem. Costello shunned the running game. His way was to hold the ball and wait for Abdul-Jabbar to settle into the pivot.\n\nRobertson's strength notwithstanding, this was another finesse team. When faced with an opposing center who could bang and lean on Kareem, the youngster would inevitably be so exhausted come crunch-time as to be virtually useless. Smith and Dandridge were grossly undersized, and the Bucks' frontcourt could too easily be overpowered.\n\nNo. 10 1986-87 LOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\nRECORD – 65-17, OFFENSE – 117.2 (2nd), DEFENSE – 108.5 (12th)\n\nThe Showtime Lakers were led by Magic Johnson (23.9 ppg (10th); 12.2 A (1st)) the team's do (almost) everything point guard. Magic was irresistible in a broken field. He could also penetrate and post, rebound and run, and even overpower most of the league's big men. What he couldn't do was shoot from the perimeter, and play a lick of defense.\n\nMagic Johnson was in total control of the 1986-87 Lakers team that beat the Celtics in the NBA Finals. (Rick Stewart / Getty Images)\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar manned the middle (17.5 ppg, .564 FG% (5th)). With his sky hook intact, abetted by an increasingly effective arsenal of turnaround jumpers, Kareem remained a potent scorer. Even so, Magic triggered such an effective fast break that the Lakers had a thick playbook full of early offense — innumerable options for shots on the run before Abdul-Jabbar crossed the time line. Only when the break was unavailable did Kareem become the focus of LA's offense.\n\nJames Worthy was the small forward and averaged 19.4 ppg. He could scoot, shoot, and make big baskets. Defense and rebounding were his main weaknesses.\n\nA.C. Green was the only above-average defender in the starting five and averaged 10.8 ppg. He couldn't shoot, run or handle, but he did all the up-front dirty work. Setting picks. Boxing out. Diving for loose balls.\n\nByron Scott was the resident outside shooter (17.0 ppg; .436 3FG% (4th)). He was smooth, jet-footed, and high-stepping on offense. Knowing that Abdul-Jabbar had his back, Scott routinely gambled for steals on defense.\n\nThe only effective backcourt defender came off the bench. Michael Cooper (10.5 ppg; .385 3FG% (8th)) was, in fact, a quick-handed, lock-down defender. He could also ride the crest of a fast break, jump, pass, and take care of the ball. The bonus in Cooper's game was his ability to stroke 3-balls. Cooper was the X-factor in the team's success.\n\nKurt Rambis (5.7 ppg) was quicker than Green, but had the same game plan. Mychal Thompson (10.1) was a substitute big man with scoring on his mind.\n\nThis outfit was one of the best running teams ever. Their team-wide unselfishness was likewise admirable — their total of 2,428 assists led the league. In the current rarified competition, however, their problems would be magnified whenever their fast break couldn't get rolling. With the notable exceptions of Green, Cooper and Rambis, their individual defense was poor. Also, since Magic was their only power-player, the Lakers would be pounded from baseline to baseline by the better-balanced squads that top the list.\n\nNo. 9 1969-70 NEW YORK KNICKS\n\nRECORD – 60-22, OFFENSE – 115.0 (10th), DEFENSE – 105.9 (1st)\n\nMost veteran NBA-watchers agree that this was the most intelligent team ever. They were resourceful, unselfish, and by virtue of their savvy were able to control the tempo of most games.\n\nThe heart of the Knicks was Captain Willis Reed (21.9 ppg (15th), 13.9 R (5th); .507 FG% (11th)). In the pivot he could swing his lefty-hooks into the middle or split the net with fadeaway jumpers. His mid-range jumper was also a deadly weapon. In addition, Reed was an accurate (and willing) passer for a center. His crushing screens (especially along the baseline) were instrumental in creating the corner jumpers that were such a significant part of Bill Bradley's offense. At the other end of the court, Reed used his big chest and long arms to great advantage.\n\nDave DeBusschere was the power forward and averaged 14.6 ppg. He was an uncanny shooter from long-range, he could run the court like a guard (which he actually was during an earlier incarnation with the Pistons), and his rare drives to the hoop were accomplished with surprising power. But DeBusschere earned his paycheck with his Velcro defense. He was ornery, persistent, and incredibly strong — so much so that he could totally disrupt an opponent's offensive schemes.\n\nBill Bradley was the small forward and averaged14.5 ppg. Always in motion, his all-out hustle wore out even the most determined defenders. He wasn't very strong, or very fast, or very big — but he rarely missed open shots, was an incredible passer, and could anticipate the unfolding of a play a heartbeat before anybody else. His defense was relentless and clever. An argument could be made that Bradley was the smartest player the NBA has ever seen.\n\nWalt Frazier was the bellwether of the backcourt and averaged 20.9 ppg (20th); 8.2 A (2nd), .518 FG% (8th). If Reed was the heart of the Knicks, Clyde was the team's soul man. He was strong, quick enough, was deadly from 18-20 feet, was a creative driver and finisher, and an overwhelming defender. (Frazier was the only player who could shut down Jerry West.) When Frazier dribbled, the ball flashed in his hands like a golden coin. But, more than being capable of making astounding passes, Frazier was also a facilitator.\n\nDick Barnett (14.9 ppg) was a much more complete player than he was ever given credit for. He scored most of his points with a driving lefty hook and his renowned Fall-Back-Baby jumper. But Barnett could also pass and defend. Mark him as the team's unsung hero.\n\nCazzie Russell (11.5 ppg) provided instant points off the bench. He was a powerhouse swing man and a dynamic streak shooter. The only drawback in his game was his poor defense.\n\nDave Stallworth (7.8 ppg) was quick, long, and a hustle-player behind DeBusschere. Mike Riordan was a spare guard (7.7 ppg) a robust defender and heady passer with an afflicted jumper. Nate Bowman (2.9 ppg) was Reed's backup. Nate \"The Snake\" was one of the fastest big men in the league and a valuable rebounder.\n\nCoach Red Holzman's mantra became famous — \"Hit the open man.\" That's why the Knicks were such a cohesive ball club, the whole being greater than the sum of their parts. The Knicks were also smart enough to understand that the Russellian Celtics proved that an outstanding defense could generate enough offense to win a championship.\n\nWhat did the Knicks lack? Overwhelming speed. Size up front. And power players off the bench.\n\nNBA's greatest all-time teams Nos. 8-5\n\nHere's the mid-level grouping of the NBA's most outstanding teams, none of which were one-season wonders. All of them, in fact, played at either the beginning or the end of mini- or maxi-dynasties.\n\nNo. 8 — 2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers\n\nRecord: 56-26\n\nOffense: 100.6 (3rd)\n\nDefense: 97.3 (23rd)\n\nThis team showcased a pair of mega-superstars, a roster full of role players and a system that harmonized and maximized everyone's skills.\n\nDuring the Lakers' recent championship runs, Shaquille O'Neal was the biggest star in the NBA heavens. (Jeff Haynes/AFP / Getty Images)\n\nThe biggest star in the NBA heavens was Shaquille O'Neal — 28.7 ppg (3rd); 12.7 rpg (3rd); .572 FG percentage (1st); 2.76 bpg (4th) — the mightiest, most intimidating center in the league. What couldn't he do? Make free throws. Rotate quickly on defense. Launch himself off the floorboards quickly enough to beat spring-legged bigs to rebounds.\n\nA shade behind Shaq was Kobe Bryant — 28.5 ppg (4th) — the best non-center in the game. An MJ-like combination of strength, shooting range, hops, ability to pass, defend, run, rebound and take over clutch situations. Kobe's only drawback was his rampant narcissism, an aspect of his character that caused unnecessary disharmony. Credit Kobe, however, with putting a lid on his selfishness once the money games commenced.\n\nRick Fox — 9.6 ppg — was an outstanding defender, tough to shake with a screen or on even the trickiest of solo moves. Fox could also nail big-time 3-pointers whenever a game was on the line. He was a model of unselfish play and understood every nuance of the offense. What couldn't he do? Maintain a game-to-game focus.\n\nEven in his declining years, Horace Grant — 8.5 pgg — was still one of the league's best post-up defenders. Mid-range jumpers and flawless execution were also highlighted in his repertoire.\n\nDerek Fisher — 11.5 ppg — was a sturdy, right-minded, left-handed point guard, who recovered from an injury to be a major factor (replacing the injured Ron Harper) in the playoffs. If he lacked the lateral quickness to contain his opposite numbers, Fisher's uncanny anticipation allowed him to draw charging fouls. A clutch shooter and excellent teammate, Fisher totally understood and accepted the requirements of the triangle offense.\n\nOf the subs, Brian Shaw — 5.3 ppg — was a long-limbed defender and clutch 3-point shooter off the bench. As usual, Robert Horry — 5.2 ppg — was Mister Big Shot.\n\nThere are three main reasons why this edition of the L.A. Lakers is shut out of the ultimate winners' circle. Shaq's miserable free-throw shooting rendered him useless in the clutch. Plus, the team's failure to play consistent defense and the overall lack of team speed that kept them from scoring easy hoops.\n\nThe 2000-01 Lakers and the 1970-71 Bucks are similar in that each had a dreadnaught center as well as an incredibly talented guard and that each was basically a half-court team. Why, then, are the Lakers rated higher? Because a mature Shaq would have worn out a young Jabbar. Because a young Kobe would have been more than Dandridge, Smith or even an aging Oscar could have handled. Because the Bucks offense was as predictable as the triangle was unpredictable.\n\nNo. 7 — 1988-89 Detroit Pistons\n\nRecord: 63-19\n\nOffense: 106.6 (16th)\n\nDefense: 100.8 (2nd)\n\nThe Bad Boys were bad indeed. Late hits by Bill Laimbeer and Dennis Rodman. Surreptitious undercuttings by Isiah Thomas. The selective brutality of Rick Mahorn and John Salley. Their tactics may have been brutal and over-the-line dirty, but they were also highly effective.\n\nZeke was the ostensible leader of the pack —18.2 ppg; 8.3 apg (9th). If his shooting range was somewhat limited (only 27.3 percent from beyond the arc), Thomas was a terrific finisher in an open court and a great pull-up jump shooter. On defense, he was lavish in the use of his elbows. He also infuriated opponents by stepping on their feet as they tried to elevate for a shot. Zeke would, could and did do anything to win.\n\nJoe Dumars — 17.2 ppg — provided stability, clutch shooting and ferocious defense. Credit Dumars with being the mainspring of the Pistons' triumphs.\n\nMark Aguirre — 18.9 ppg — was the weakest defender on the starting five. But at 6-foot-6, he was the team's best low-post scorer. Aguirre was also a beast on the offensive glass.\n\nBill Laimbeer — 13.7 ppg; 9.6 rpg (9th) — was the meanest and nastiest of the crew. He couldn't block shots or keep up with quick bigs who could face up and go, but he compensated by being a cheap-shot artist. He was also adept at hitting long-range jumpers and hitting defensive players with moving picks. Laimbeer was a beloved teammate and a detested opponent.\n\nVinnie Johnson — 13.8 ppg — was called The Microwave, because he could heat up a scoreboard in a hurry. Powerfully built at 6-2 and 200 pounds, VJ was fearless in the paint, and his ability to stop-and-pop could always ignite the Pistons' offense. Johnson's defense was belligerent but less than average.\n\nThe team's best defender (and one of the best in the NBA) was Dennis Rodman — 9.0 ppg; 9.4 rpg (12th); .595 FG percentage (1st). He was simply an incredible offensive rebounder. He could run like a sprinter, and his pants-pulling-late-hitting-relentless defense infuriated his opponents. He shot only layups and put-backs, and was a perfect role player.\n\nJames Edwards' role was even more specific — 7.3 ppg — assume the proper position in the low post (usually the left box) and score (usually with fadeaway jumpers). Too bad Edwards' defense wasn't up to par. Both Rick Mahorn and John Salley were vicious enforcers who picked up where Laimbeer left off.\n\nA notoriously arrogant and physical bunch to say the least. The Pistons had great depth (especially up front), were loaded with outstanding perimeter shooters and had several awesome one-on-one scorers.\n\nHowever, fast teams that refused to be intimated by the Pistons' mean-spirited tactics could triumph. But some times the bad guys do win.\n\nNo. 6 — 1983-84 Boston Celtics\n\nRecord: 62-20\n\nOffense: 112.1 (3rd)\n\nDefense: 105.6 (5th)\n\nThe team earned high grades for intelligence, unselfishness, discipline, rebounding power (they led the league with 3,697 total rebounds) and an incredible front line.\n\nLeading the Celtics' honor roll was Larry Bird — 24.2 ppg (7th); 10.1 rpg (9th); .888 FT percent (1st); and the team leader in assists. He could do everything but run fast, jump high and play man-to-man defense. Instead, he read the court like it was an ABC primer, mastered team defense and he had a sixth sense for anticipating where the ball would wind up on any given sequence. There has never been a better clutch player before or since. Bird was a one-in-a-generation player — a non-point guard who made his teammates better.\n\nKevin McHale — 18.4 ppg — could do everything but pass. He had the most effective variety of inside moves since Gypsy Rose Lee. He could rebound and was an excellent defender.\n\nRobert Parish — 19.0 ppg; 10.7 rpg (7th) — did most of his scoring in the initial 40 minutes of a game. He scored with his high-release jumper, and his long arms also helped him control the boards. Parish was good, mind you, but never as good as either Bird or McHale.\n\nDennis Johnson — 13.2 ppg — could do everything but shoot from long range. He was one of the finest defenders of his time. Rebounding, passing, free throws, big plays at the right time — Johnson did all of these as good as any of his peers.\n\nGerald Henderson — 11.6 ppg — took the ball-handling pressure off Johnson, was a dead-eye shooter and a pesky defender.\n\nCedric Maxwell was the top scorer off the bench —11.9 ppg — and perhaps the worst defender on the team. But Cornbread could fill the basket, handle the ball (sometimes overhandle) and clean the offensive glass.\n\nDanny Ainge — 5.4 ppg — played hard both ways, hit open shots and moved the ball.\n\nScott Wedman — 4.8 ppg — was a one-time All-Star, a sharpshooter and ace defender.\n\nQuinn Buckner — 4.1 ppg — mostly played husky defense.\n\nBird was stronger than he looked, but McHale was the only real power player. Yet Bird was the wild card — he would rise to every occasion and give the team whatever it needed to get straight As.\n\nNo. 5 — 1964-65 Boston Celtics\n\nRecord: 62-18\n\nOffense: 112.8 (1st)\n\nDefense: 104.5 (1st)\n\nDEE-FENSE!!! That was the cry that kept the leprechauns in the Boston Garden awake. Since the Celtics shot a combined 41.1 percent from the field (second worst in the league), they absolutely relied on their defense to create easy shots via fast breaks and turnovers. And that's exactly what happened.\n\nIt was Bill Russell's foot-speed that gave the Celtics a legitimate five-man fast-break. (Nathaniel S. Butler/ NBAE / Getty Images)\n\nBill Russell guarded the basket — 14.1 ppg; 24.1 rpg (1st); 5.3 apg (5th). Blocked shots weren't tallied back then, but Russ must have registered from 7-10 per game, plus an equal number of \"scares.\" Timing was his secret — he could hold his ground until the ball left the shooter's hands and still blast off, reach out and touch the shot. Russell also had the knack of keeping virtually all of his blocked shots in play where they could be recovered by his teammates. What else could he do? Play sinewy-strong mano-a-mano defense, hit an occasional left hook and foul line jumper. Throw a nifty outlet pass. Compete like his life was at stake. And it was Russell's foot speed that gave the Celtics a legitimate five-man fastbreak, which proved to be an enormous advantage.\n\nSam Jones was the designated scorer — 25.9 ppg (4th); .820 FT percent (6th). The bank was always open when Sam pulled up on the edge of a break and unloosened his jumper. He was an unselfish passer and an adequate defender.\n\nJohn Havlicek — 18.3 ppg (14th) — played as though he had three lungs. If his outside shooting was streaky, he ran himself into easy shots and had a killer instinct in the clutch. One of the league's finest defenders, he also led the NBA in floorburns. Watch Hondo run and run and run and ...\n\nTom \"Satch\" Saunders — 11.8 ppg — scored with a squatty jumper, but earned his paycheck playing suffocating defense.\n\nTom \"Tommy Gun\" Heinsohn — 13.5 ppg — was the Celtics' most inefficient shooter (38.3 percent from the field). But his line-drive hook shots from along either baseline, and his bully-boy work on the boards made him a valuable performer.\n\nWillie \"The Whale\" Naulls — 10.5 ppg — was a fine midrange shooter for a rather round big man. Larry Siegfried — 6.3 ppg — was Hondo lite. And the most important sub was K.C. Jones — 8.3 ppg; 5.6 apg (3rd). K.C. couldn't shoot his way out of a paper bag (39.6 percent), but he could rebound, hustle, and, above all, play killer defense.\n\nWith K.C., Havlicek, Saunders and Russ, the Celtics could field four defensive stoppers — and this was their transcendent advantage.\n\nWhy would the 1964-65 Celtics beat the 1983-84 version? Quickness, the confidence born of eight championships in nine seasons (and one more to come in 1965-66) and DEE-FENSE.\n\nHere they are. The four teams that stand above the rest. The teams that establish the standard for true greatness.\n\nNo. 4 1991-92 CHICAGO BULLS\n\nRECORD — 67-15, OFFENSE — 109.9 (4th), DEFENSE — 99.5 (3rd)\n\nThis was the second consecutive Bulls championship under the direction of Phil Jackson. By then, all the players were familiar with, and accepted the necessity of, the triangle offense. This wasn't the case in the previous season, in which assistant coach Johnny Bach undermined Jackson's game plan, and Michael Jordan didn't embrace the offense until the championship series against the Lakers.\n\nM.J., of course, was the apex of the triangle, averaging 30.1 ppg (1st) and 2.28 spg (6th). He was at the top of his game, and at the top of the league. There was nothing he couldn't do on a basketball court.\n\nMichael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the perfect one-two punch for the 1991-92 Bulls. (Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images)\n\nJordan's main sidekick was Scottie Pippen (21.0 ppg) an incredible defender and facilitator. With his length and athleticism, Pippen could excel at every position except center. Like a middle linebacker in the NFL, it was Pippen who called the defensive signals. While he seemed arrogant to the fans and the media, his teammates appreciated his encouragement and his help. His only flaw was his habit of taking one or two hasty perimeter shots per game.\n\nHorace Grant (14.2 ppg; .578 "
