        "text": "Mike Hopkins to become an assistant for Phoenix\n\nFormer University of Washington coach Mike Hopkins — a two-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year — has agreed to a deal to become an assistant for the Phoenix Suns, sources told ESPN. After seven seasons with the Huskies and 30-plus overall in college basketball, Hopkins joins Mike Budenholzer’s new coaching staff, which will include David Fizdale and Chad Forcier, sources said. Hopkins, 54, had a 122-110 (.526) record with Washington, including a 2019 conference title and NCAA tournament bid.\n\nJovan Buha: The Lakers had previously looked at uh Terry Stotts as potentially an offensive coordinator so I think maybe he’s a name that gets floated. I think they will look into having a more experience staff after Darvin Ham had a staff with no head coaching experience, and kind of compared to looking at the the staff under Frank Vogel with Jason Kidd, who had previously been a head coach a couple times, David Fizdale who had been a head coach and Phil Handy who had obviously been a 10-year assistant and was was beloved across the league, especially with stars.\n\nDavid Fizdale yet to accept Suns’ front office job\n\nDavid Fizdale has been offered a front office position with the Phoenix Suns, but he hasn’t accepted the job yet, sources informed The Republic. The longtime NBA coach was an assistant this season under Frank Vogel, who was fired last week after one season as head coach in Phoenix. The Suns didn’t retain anyone else on the staff, sources said. They hired former Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer to a five-year deal for $50 million-plus last weekend. Fizdale was an assistant general manager with the Utah Jazz in the 2022-23 season before the Suns lured him away to coach again as he agreed to a deal for more than a million dollars a year when he was hired in June of 2023.\n\nSuns expected to offer lead assistant David Fizdale a front office role\n\nThe Phoenix Suns plan to hire Milwaukee Bucks champion Mike Budenholzer as their coach on a deal expected to approach eight figures per year, league sources said Friday. The Suns are expected to offer lead assistant David Fizdale a new front office role, but a source briefed on Fizdale’s thinking indicated he is currently not expected to accept it."
