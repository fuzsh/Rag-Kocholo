        "text": "Dave Clawson, who was named Wake Forest University’s 32nd head football coach on Dec. 10, 2013, has set a new standard for Wake Forest football as he heads into his 11th season in Winston-Salem in 2024.\n\nClawson, who was named as an American Football Coaches Association Board of Trustee member on Jan. 10, 2022, signed a multi-year contract extension with Wake Forest on Nov. 26, 2021 and has achieved unparalleled success as the leader of the Demon Deacons football program.\n\nSpecifically, since the start of the 2016 season, the Deacs have the third-most wins in the ACC not counting the COVID-shortened 2020 season. Additionally, the Demon Deacons are in the winningest stretch of football in their program's history with Clawson’s teams owning five the program’s top-five win totals in program history over a five-year span.\n\n1. 38 Wins (2017-21)\n\n2. 37 Wins (2018-22)\n\n3. 36 Wins (2004-08 & 2006-10)\n\n5. 35 Wins (2019-23)\n\n6. 34 Wins (2016-20)\n\n7. 33 Wins (2015-19)\n\n8. 31 Wins (1944-48)\n\n9. 30 Wins (1940-44)\n\nAll that winning has led to record-setting crowds, multiple sellouts and the best student attendance in school history, which has given the Demon Deacons a huge edge when playing at home inside Allegacy Stadium. Wake holds a 23-7 (.767) record in home contests since the start of the 2019 season, which included a program-record 11-game winning streak spanning from the 2020 to 2022 seasons. With that, the Deacs’ 76.7 percent win rate ranks third in the ACC during that time period (2019-23).\n\nThat aforementioned win streak featured a perfect 6-0 record at home in 2021, which was Wake Forest’s first undefeated home record since 1979 and that fall marked just the third time since the Deacs’ 1970 ACC Championship team to go unbeaten inside Allegacy Stadium. Meanwhile, six home wins in 2021 tied the program record that Clawson’s 2019 squad had previously set.\n\nOver the last eight seasons since 2016, the Demon Deacons have found a winning formula in one-score ball games by capturing multiple more wins by one score in six of those seasons with a total of 21 victories in 38 such games. Coach Clawson’s squads hold the fourth-best winning percentage in the ACC in those games during that span.\n\nIn the stands, Wake Forest has sold out nine home games since 2021 and over the course of its six home games during the 2023 season, Allegacy Stadium hosted an average of 3,511 students and 30,498 fans – both tallies are the highest on record.\n\nAll the aforementioned victories are due to having great players who perform well each week. The Deacs 54 All-ACC honors is the fifth most overall in the ACC since the 2019 season and Wake Forest is one of just six schools to have more than 50 honorees in that time span.\n\nOver the course of his tenure at Wake Forest, Coach Clawson’s staff has had six student-athletes (Cam Serigne, TE: 2014, 2015, 2016); Dom Maggio, P: 2016, 2017, 2019; Greg Dortch, 2017: All-Purpose, 2017: Return Specialist, 2018: All-Purpose, 2018: Return Specialist; Essang Bassey, CB: 2017, 2018, 2019; Nick Sciba, K: 2019, 2020, 2021; Michael Jurgens, OL: 2021, 2022, 2023) earn All-ACC honors at least three times during their careers. While Greg Dortch is the only four-time honoree in program history. Overall, there are only 15 players in program history who have ever accomplished this feat of at least three all-conference accolades.\n\nDuring the Deacs run of seven-straight bowl appearances from 2016-22, which was the second-longest streak in the ACC, tied for the 10th longest in the country, and was the longest in Wake Forest lore with the previous best at just three-consecutive years, Coach Clawson’s program defeated two SEC teams (Texas A&M, 2017; Missouri, 2022) and a Big Ten program (Rutgers, 2021) across those postseason games. Overall, Clawson has earned five bowl victories at Wake Forest, which is the most in school history, and is tied for fifth in ACC history for postseason wins. He ranks behind Bobby Bowden (Florida State, 11), Dabo Swinney (Clemson, 11), Frank Beamer (Virginia Tech, 6) and Danny Ford (Clemson, 6). Meanwhile, Clawson enters the 2024 season tied with Jimbo Fisher (Florida State, 5) and Ralph Friedgen (Maryland, 5).\n\nOverall during his decade in Winston-Salem, Clawson is a perfect 4-0 against teams from the SEC. Additionally with a pair of victories against Vanderbilt and Mizzou in 2022, he led the Deacs to a pair of victories over Southeastern Conference foes in the same season for the first since 2008 and the second time in program history.\n\nThe 2021 and 2022 campaigns in Winston-Salem featured a number of program firsts and records. Specifically during that two-year span, Wake Forest went 19-8 and that win total over two seasons was the second-highest in program history (21, 2006-07) and it was tied for the ninth-best mark in all of the Power 5. After climbing into the top 10 of the Associated Press and Amway Coaches Poll in 2021 and 2022, Wake Forest was one of just 17 programs to achieve a top-10 ranking in each of those campaigns. The Deacs climbed to ninth in 2021 and ranked 10th in 2022, both the highest rankings in program history. Additionally, the Deacs were tabbed No. 9 in the country by the College Football Playoff Poll on Nov. 2, 2021. Also, Wake Forest ended the 2021 season ranked No. 15 in the Associated Press Poll, which marked the highest ranking to end a season in program history.\n\nA 6-1 start to the 2022 season, including three-straight home sellout crowds inside Allegacy Stadium and a top-10 ranking, highlighted Wake Forest’s season that fall. The three sellouts marked Wake Forest’s longest-consecutive run since 2011 and the first time since 2006 that the Decs hosted a capacity crowd during the month of September. Additionally, quarterback Sam Hartman was named the ACC’s Brian Piccolo Award winner as he set the ACC record for career touchdown passes late that season and the Demon Deacons had 12 players earn All-ACC honors.\n\nIn 2021, the Demon Deacons won the Atlantic Coast Conference Atlantic Division title and the 2021 TaxSlayer Gator Bowl Championship. After leading the Deacs to a program-record tying 11-3 record, including a school-best 7-1 mark in ACC play, Clawson was named the 2021 ACC Coach of the Year by the ACC and the Associated Press. It marked the ninth time a Wake Forest head coach has been honored as the ACC Football Coach of the Year and the first since 2006. Clawson was the seventh Wake Forest head coach to win the award. Others who won the award were Jim Grobe (2006), Bill Dooley (1992 and 1987), John Mackovic (1979), Cal Stoll (1970), William Tate (1964) and Paul Amen (1959 and 1955).\n\nIndividually, the Coach of the Year honor marked his fifth-career accolade. Clawson was the Patriot League Coach of the Year in 2001 and 2002 at Fordham and was awarded the 2005 Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year award and 2007 Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year honor at Richmond.\n\nNationally in 2021, Clawson was a semifinalist for George Munger Collegiate Coach of the Year and a finalist for the Paul “Bear” Bryant and Bobby Dodd National Coach of the Year awards. Prior to earning those accolades, Clawson was the 2002 Schutt Sports/American Football Monthly I-AA Coach of the Year and a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Award. In 2005, Clawson earned National Coach of the Year from I-AA.org and was again a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Award.\n\nAdditionally during his tenure at Wake Forest, Clawson led the Deacs to their eighth Big 4 Championship in 2019. Clawson has the third-most wins in school history and is 63-61 in his decade-long tenure with the Demon Deacons. He is one of just five head coaches in program history to have a winning record in his coaching career at Wake Forest and the first since D.C. “Peahead” Walker (77-51-6; 1937-50).\n\nClawson and offensive coordinator Warren Ruggiero have engineered an offense that has rewritten the record books at Wake Forest. The Deacons have set nearly 400 school records including marks for points scored, points per game, total offensive yards, first downs and passing yards from 2017-22. Also, the Deacs were the only football program in the ACC to average at least 30 points per game each year during that aforementioned six-year span. That run ranks as the fourth longest in ACC history.\n\nSpecifically in 2021, Wake Forest scored a program-best 574 points and averaged a school-record 41.0 ppg. That point total ranks 43rd in modern FBS history and the fourth-most in ACC history. Additionally, Wake Forest became just the 20th ACC team in the college football modern era (Post-WWII) to cross over the milestone of 500 points scored in a single season. Individually, the Deacons topped 35 points in a game 12 times during the 2021 campaign. In the College Football Playoff Era, Wake Forest is one of seven teams (2014 Oregon, 2018 Alabama, 2018 Oklahoma, 2019 Alabama, 2019 LSU, 2020 Alabama) to accomplish that feat in a single season.\n\nIndividually on offense under Ruggiero and Clawson’s tutelage, three quarterbacks at Wake Forest have earned All-ACC honors when they were a starter (John Wolford, 2017; Jamie Newman, 2019; Sam Hartman, 2021 & 2022).\n\nUnique due to the tremendous leadership of Clawson and his staff, Wake Forest is the only school in the country to score at least a 990 on the latest Academic Progress Report, Graduation Success Rate and play in a bowl game in seven of the last eight years under the same head coach. Additionally, Wake Forest is one of only six (Duke, Northwestern Stanford, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt) FBS schools with an overall GSR of greater than 96 in each of the past four reports.\n\nAcademically in the fall 2023 semester, his squad recorded a combined 3.2 grade point average - the highest in program history. Additionally, Wake Forest had 29 Academic All-ACC honorees, which was tied for the most in the conference. Not to be outdone, the Deacs have totaled 59 honors over the past two seasons and that tally is the highest-mark for a two-year stretch in program history.\n\nFinally, Wake Forest football has undergone a facilities transformation following the tremendous success of the Demon Deacons football program over the last 10 years as $150 million has been invested into the Deacs’ world class facilities.\n\nThe latest investment was a $38 million dollar facility, the McCreary Football Complex. This facility is 60,000 new square feet adjoining the existing McCreary Football Field House and Sutton Sports Performance Center. It includes locker space for 130 student-athletes, player lounge with a nutrition station, recovery area, entertainment area, football athletic training/treatment space, equipment center and loading dock and a multipurpose space seating up to 200 for team meals, meetings, functions and other activities.\n\nOther new facilities during Coach Clawson’s tenure include the opening of the aforementioned Sutton Sports Performance Center in the fall of 2019 and the McCreary Football Field House in 2016. The SSPC gave Wake football a state-of-the-art facility that features a world-class strength and conditioning complex to go with 16,000 square feet of space for coaches’ offices, recruiting space and team meeting areas as well as a specialized nutrition center. Meanwhile, the McCreary Football Field House is an 80,000-square foot structure that features a 120-yard football field and adjoins the Doc Martin Practice Fields.\n\nClawson came to Winston-Salem after five seasons as the head coach at Bowling Green State University where he led the Falcons to the 2013 Mid-American Conference championship with a 47-27 win over No. 16 Northern Illinois.\n\nIn his 24 years as a head coach, Clawson has delivered a conference championship at each of his first three stops. Prior to the 2013 MAC title, Clawson helped Richmond to a pair of Colonial Athletic Association titles in 2005 and 2007. His first championship as a head coach came in 2002 when he led Fordham to the Patriot League title.\n\nClawson is the only active Division I head coach to win four conference championships in four different Division I leagues. Overall, he has compiled an impressive 153 wins in his head coaching career, which ranks 14th amongst active FBS head coaches.\n\nA 1989 graduate of Williams College in Massachusetts, Clawson earned a degree in political economy and played defensive back.\n\nClawson and his wife, Catherine, are the parents of two children, Courtney and Eric.\n\nWake Forest (2014-Present)\n\nOverview:\n\nDave Clawson has continued the success of former head coach Jim Grobe (2001-13) as Wake Forest has been the top program in the state of North Carolina this century.\n\nSince the turn of the century, the Demon Deacons boast a record of 32-26 against UNC, NC State and Duke. In addition during that time, Wake Forest is 46-26 against all in-state opponents. The Deacs lead the Big Four in winning percentage against each other during that period.\n\nWake Forest, who won the 2006 ACC Championship title, holds the unique distinction of being the only North Carolina school to claim the title in the Championship era. Additionally, the Demon Deacons and Tar Heels are the only program from the state to qualify for multiple league title games (WF: 2006, 2021; UNC: 2015, 2022) and the Deacs are the only North Carolina school to win the now defunct Atlantic Division.\n\nWake Forest is the only Big Four school to record 11 wins in a single season twice (2006, 2021) this century. The Demon Deacons are one just seven Atlantic Coast Conference programs to achieve this mark as a member institution of the league.\n\nSpecifically, since the start of the 2016 season, the Deacs have the third-most wins in the ACC not counting the COVID-shortened 2020 season. Additionally, the Demon Deacons are in the winningest stretch of football in their program's history with Clawson’s teams owning five the program’s top-five win totals in program history over a five-year span.\n\n1. 38 Wins (2017-21)\n\n2. 37 Wins (2018-22)\n\n3. 36 Wins (2004-08 & 2006-10)\n\n5. 35 Wins (2019-23)\n\n6. 34 Wins (2016-20)\n\n7. 33 Wins (2015-19)\n\n8. 31 Wins (1944-48)\n\n9. 30 Wins (1940-44)\n\nAll that winning has led to record-setting crowds, multiple sellouts and the best student attendance in school history, which has given the Demon Deacons a huge edge when playing at home inside Allegacy Stadium. Wake holds a 23-7 (.767) record in home contests since the start of the 2019 season, which included a program-record 11-game winning streak spanning from the 2020 to 2022 seasons. With that, the Deacs’ 76.7 percent win rate ranks third in the ACC during that time period (2019-23).\n\nOver the last eight seasons since 2016, the Demon Deacons have found a winning formula in one-score ball games by capturing multiple more wins by one score in six of those seasons with a total of 21 victories in 38 such games. Coach Clawson’s squads hold the fourth-best winning percentage in the ACC in those games during that span.\n\nIn the stands, Wake Forest has sold out nine home games since 2021.\n\nAll the aforementioned victories are due to having great players who perform well each week. The Deacs 54 All-ACC honors is the fifth most overall in the ACC since the 2019 season and Wake Forest is one of just six schools to have more than 50 honorees in that time span.\n\nIndividually on offense under Ruggiero and Clawson’s tutelage, three quarterbacks at Wake Forest have earned All-ACC honors when they were a starter (John Wolford, 2017; Jamie Newman, 2019; Sam Hartman, 2021 & 2022).\n\nDuring the Deacs run of seven-straight bowl appearances from 2016-22, which was the second-longest streak in the ACC, tied for the 10th longest in the country, and was the longest in Wake Forest lore with the previous best at just three-consecutive years, Coach Clawson’s program defeated two SEC teams (Texas A&M, 2017; Missouri, 2022) and a Big Ten program (Rutgers, 2021) across those postseason games.\n\nOverall, Clawson has earned five bowl victories at Wake Forest, which is the most in school history, and is tied for fifth in ACC history for postseason wins. He ranks behind Bobby Bowden (Florida State, 11), Dabo Swinney (Clemson, 11), Frank Beamer (Virginia Tech, 6) and Danny Ford (Clemson, 6). Meanwhile, Clawson enters the 2024 season tied with Jimbo Fisher (Florida State, 5) and Ralph Friedgen (Maryland, 5).\n\nOverall during his decade in Winston-Salem, Clawson is a perfect 4-0 against teams from the SEC. Additionally with a pair of victories against Vanderbilt and Mizzou in 2022, he led the Deacs to a pair of victories over Southeastern Conference foes in the same season for the first since 2008 and the second time in program history.\n\nThe 2021 and 2022 campaigns in Winston-Salem featured a number of program firsts and records. Specifically during that two-year span, Wake Forest went 19-8 and that win total over two seasons was the second-highest in program history (21, 2006-07) and it was tied for the ninth-best mark in all of the Power 5. After climbing into the top 10 of the Associated Press and Amway Coaches Poll in 2021 and 2022, Wake Forest was one of just 17 programs to achieve a top-10 ranking in each of those campaigns. The Deacs climbed to ninth in 2021 and ranked 10th in 2022, both the highest rankings in program history. Additionally, the Deacs were tabbed No. 9 in the country by the College Football Playoff Poll on Nov. 2, 2021. Also, Wake Forest ended the 2021 season ranked No. 15 in the Associated Press Poll, which marked the highest ranking to end a season in program history.\n\nIn 2021, the Demon Deacons won the Atlantic Coast Conference Atlantic Division title and the 2021 TaxSlayer Gator Bowl Championship. After leading the Deacs to a program-record tying 11-3 record, including a school-best 7-1 mark in ACC play, Clawson was named the 2021 ACC Coach of the Year by the ACC and the Associated Press. It marked the ninth time a Wake Forest head coach has been honored as the ACC Football Coach of the Year and the first since 2006. Clawson was the seventh Wake Forest head coach to win the award. Others who won the award were Jim Grobe (2006), Bill Dooley (1992 and 1987), John Mackovic (1979), Cal Stoll (1970), William Tate (1964) and Paul Amen (1959 and 1955).\n\nAdditionally during his tenure at Wake Forest, Clawson led the Deacs to their eighth Big 4 Championship in 2019. Clawson has the third-most wins in school history and is 63-61 in his decade-long tenure with the Demon Deacons. He is one of just five head coaches in program history to have a winning record in his coaching career at Wake Forest and the first since D.C. “Peahead” Walker (77-51-6; 1937-50).\n\n2023:\n\nWake Forest only returned 11 starters from its bowl champion 2022 squad and rode the highs and lows with many student-athletes playing major roles for the first time in their careers. The team persevered throughout the season and won three home games during the season and earned a road victory at Old Dominion.\n\nThe Deacs opened the 2023 season with a 37-17 win over Elon.\n\nDating back to 2000, Wake Forest has won its last 18 games and has gone undefeated against non-Power-5 North Carolina schools since 2000.\n\nWith the 36-20 win over Vanderbilt in Week 2, the Deacs have five wins over the Commodores since the start of the 2007 season.\n\nWake Forest won at Old Dominion in Week 3 with a 27-24 comeback win.\n\nThe victory marked the Deacs’ seventh-straight over a program from the state of Virginia dating back to the 2020 season. Over that win streak, the Demon Deacons have outscored Virginia teams 247-142.\n\nThe win over ODU also clinched Wake Forest’s 12th-straight non-conference victory. That tally was the second-longest in the country at the time before the streak was snapped at Notre Dame on Nov. 18, 2023.\n\nWake Forest trailed by 17 points in its win at Old Dominion. With that, the Demon Deacons second-half comeback marked the program's largest since Nov. 11, 2017 at Syracuse.\n\nIn that contest, Wake Forest also trailed by 17 points and went onto win, 64-43.\n\nThe 17-point come-from-behind win was tied for sixth in Wake Forest history and tied with the aforementioned 2017 contest at Syracuse for the second-largest in the Dave Clawson era.\n\nThe Deacs downed Pitt 21-17 at home on Oct. 21, 2023 and that win marked Wake Forest’s first victory over the Panthers in program history.\n\nSix Wake Forest football players earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors following the 2023 season. The 2023 season marked the seventh-consecutive season the Demon Deacons have had six or more players make the All-ACC teams.\n\nThe Deacs 54 All-ACC honors is the fifth most overall in the ACC since the 2019 season and Wake Forest is one of just six schools to have more than 50 honorees in that time span.\n\nRedshirt senior offensive lineman Michael Jurgens and junior defensive back Malik Mustapha both earned Second Team All-ACC Honors. This was the third time in his Wake Forest career that Jurgens has been named an All-ACC honoree. Junior defensive lineman Jasheen Davis was named Third Team All-ACC. Additionally, redshirt junior offensive lineman DeVonte Gordon, redshirt junior defensive lineman Kevin Pointer and sophomore running back Demond Claiborne all earned honorable mention recognition from the voters.\n\nJasheen Davis recorded at least 0.5 tackles-for-loss in the 20 of his last 21 games to end the 2023 season. Over the last two seasons, Davis has collected 30.0 tackles for loss and 14.5 sacks. With 7.5 sacks in 2023, Davis has now tallied 20.0 sacks in his career and that ranks fifth in program history:\n\n1. Mike McCrary (1989-92) 30.0\n\n2. Calvin Pace (1999-02) 29.0\n\n3. Duke Ejiofor (2014-17) 23.5\n\n4. Carlos Basham, Jr. (2017-20) 20.5\n\n5. Jasheen Davis (2020-Present) 20.0\n\nWake Forest hosted four sellout crowds and a total of 182,990 fans across the Deacs six home contests. Overall with an average crowd of 30,498 in attendance at each home game inside Allegacy Stadium, the 2023 season marked the first time since 2011 that Wake averaged that many fans per contest. Additionally, Wake Forest’s student attendance for the season was above 21,000 and multiple games featured at least 80 percent of the student body in attendance.\n\nThe Demon Deacons started three quarterbacks under-center during the 2023 season.\n\nRedshirt junior Michael Kern started the final two games of the season at Notre Dame and Syracuse.

The pair has combined for 27 touchdowns, which is tied for the second most in ACC history.\n\nRyan Smenda, Jr., who Clawson named as a captain prior to the season, had a career-high 117 tackles in 2022 and it marked the most in a single season by a Demon Deacon since 2006. He finished his career ranked eighth all-time in program history (355).\n\nAllegacy Stadium hosted a total of 210,350 fans across the Deacs seven home contests last fall and a school-record 23,643 students attended games this past fall.\n\nWeek-By-Week Notes:\n\nIn Week 1 on Sept. 1 vs. VMI, 3,752 Wake Forest students attended the Demon Deacons seismic win.

It marked the ninth time a Wake Forest head coach has been honored as the ACC Football Coach of the Year and the first since 2006.\n\nClawson is the seventh Wake Forest head coach to win the award.

The total is the most since 2008 when Wake Forest tallied 37 turnovers.\n\nThe Deacs 15 interceptions are the most by a Wake Forest team since 2008 (18).\n\nOverall, 10 different Demon Deacons recorded an interception this season. Wake Forest totaled six multi-interception games in 2021.\n\nSixteen different defenders forced a turnover during the season.\n\nWake Forest’s 38 sacks this fall set a Clawson-era record and it ranks second in program history behind 1992 when the Deacs totaled 46.\n\nThe Deacs 223 yardage lost by their 38 sacks was the highest mark since at least 1996.\n\nFAN ATTENDANCE:\n\nBehind Wake Forest’s first back-to-back sellouts (Duke on Oct. 30; NC State on Nov. 13) since 2006, Allegacy Stadium hosted a 6.4 percent increase in average game attendance this fall compared to the 2019 season. That is the seventh-largest increase rate among Power 5 schools and ranks second in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\n172,326 fans attended the Demon Deacons six home games in the fall of 2021, which is an average of 28,721 per contest.\n\n20,305 students attended Wake Forest football games at Allegacy Stadium in 2021, with an average of 3,384 per contest.

Wake Forest boasted a 1,000-yard rusher in Cade Carney and a 1,000-yard receiver in Greg Dortch, marking the first time since 1979 a Deacon team had accomplished that feat.\n\nThat season marked Wake Forest’s third-consecutive bowl invitation despite breaking in two first-year starting quarterbacks. Clawson maintained a steady hand at the controls as the Demon Deacons navigated a dozen season-ending injuries to win four of the last six games of the season including the Jared Birmingham Bowl.\n\nThe bowl win gave Clawson his third bowl win and made him the fastest Deacon coach to three bowl victories.\n\n2017:\n\nThe Demon Deacons set 105 records in 2017, tied another 15 marks, and became one of the nation’s most efficient and productive offenses. Wake Forest set major records for points scored in a season, obliterating the record by 97. The offense set new marks for total offense yards in a game and in a season, yards per carry, most touchdowns scored and most TD passes in a season.
