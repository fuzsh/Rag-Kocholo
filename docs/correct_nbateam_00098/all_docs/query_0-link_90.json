        "text": "Derrick Rose had 18 points and 11 assists, leading the Chicago Bulls to a 77-64 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night.\n\nRose keyed a seven-point burst to open the fourth period, assisting on three straight field goals. John Lucas III hit a 3-pointer and Taj Gibson scored twice, opening up an 11-point lead for Chicago.\n\nCarlos Boozer added 17 points and Luol Deng had 14 points for Chicago, which won its fifth straight and improved to a league-best 12-2. Taj Gibson scored nine of his 11 points in the fourth.\n\nThe Bulls are 5-0 at home for the first time since opening the 1996-97 season with seven straight wins at the United Center. Chicago has held its opponents to just 66.8 points game on its home court.\n\nDeMar DeRozan and Leandro Barbosa scored 15 points each for Toronto, which dropped its fourth straight.\n\nChicago was played its ninth game in 12 days, something the Bulls hadn’t done since 1972. Chicago is 8-1 over that span.\n\nToronto played for the seventh time in nine nights.\n\nChicago led by four entering the fourth quarter, an unusually close game for a team that had won all four of its home games by an average of 20 points per game.\n\nRose took over with his playmaking, scoring just two points but notching five assists in the final period as Chicago went on a 19-6 run to start the period.\n\nThe Raptors didn’t score from the foul line until Linas Kleiza made a free throw with 7:14 to go in the fourth. Toronto was just 1 for 7 from the line in game and was whistled for 15 fouls to only seven for Chicago.\n\nChicago shot 55 percent and led by 13 points in the opening period, but fell flat in the second, shooting just 30 percent from the floor.\n\nFormer Bulls player James Johnson capped a 10-2 second quarter surge with a jumper, putting Toronto ahead. Johnson scored 10 points in the first half, surpassing his season high of eight points for a full game.\n\nRose scored seven points in the first quarter and keyed a nine-point run with a pullup 3-pointer in transition as Chicago jumped out to a 23-14 lead.\n\nThe game was tied 37-all at the break and the pace didn’t pick up much in the third. Rose scored seven points in the period, but both teams shot under 40 percent."
