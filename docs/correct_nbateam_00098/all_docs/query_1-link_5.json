        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have reportedly made a new addition to their evolving coaching staff. According to Dave McMenamin of ESPN, the organization has hired former NBA players John Lucas III to their staff following several departures this offseason.\n\nJason Kidd and Lionel Hollins left the front bench staff this summer and were replaced by David Fizdale and Mike Penberthy who was promoted from within the organization. They are joined by Phil Handy as Frank Vogel’s top three assistants.\n\nGreg St. Jean was a back bench staffer who joined Kidd in Dallas (alongside former Lakers player Jared Dudley) while Miles Simon has left the parent team to be the head coach of the South Bay Lakers. Lucas will likely take a role similar to them in player development, scouting, and game prep."
