        "text": "Seneca East Races Past Lucas\n\nSeneca East held Lucas to just one point for the final 6:25 of the second quarter and the Tigers downed the Cubs (76-66) in a district semifinal in division IV on Tuesday night at Willard High School.\n\nThey return to House that Haas Built on Friday night to play Colonel Crawford again in the district final. The Eagles beat Mansfield Christian (63-59) in the lid lifter on Tuesday night.\n\nBlake Foos exploded out of the gate Tuesday night as he scored eight of his team night 20 points, on four field goals, in the games first 3:27 and the Tigers had a (10-9) lead.\n\nSeneca East coach Anthony Langhurst says the athletic Foos always plays with a lot of energy. I need some of that magic on some of my other players for next game, but again you can kind of tell he's always playing at 100 mph. Sometimes it's not good, sometimes it gets us in trouble, but you want kids like that that just play as hard as they can. So, it's just been fun watching him play, he said.\n\nFoos finished with 20, Luke Mason added 15, and Aiden Hines and Lucas Bordner both had 13 for the Tigers.\n\nLanghurst says that kind of balance has been a positive all season for the Tigers. That's the way it's been all year. It's one of those things where guys aren't looking for themselves. Theyre looking for that extra pass. It's just fun watching this group of guys. They trust each other and that's something that we preach. It's the same thing on defense. You have got to trust your teammate on defense. So, it's just been a total team effort the whole way through, said Langhurst.\n\nSeneca East outscored Lucas (20-5) in that second quarter and Cubs coach Taylor Iceman says that has kind of been what their season has been about this year. We talked about it, we've kind of done a lot this year. We come out and play well, we get a little tired and then lose focus on defense and they had a big quarter. I think we probably played being fairly even the rest of the way, but put yourself in a hole like that, you can't come back from that at this juncture, he said.\n\nLucas (19-6) put together a nice run to the first quarter, outscoring the Tigers (7-0) over the last 1:45 of the quarter to take a (21-14) advantage.\n\nYou dont win seven straight sectional titles by mailing it in and the Cubs would battle. They got with six at (63-57) after an Aiden Culler three, but it was not to be.\n\nLanghurst says they expected that Cubs will ponce and attempt to get themselves back in it. That was another talking point, Lucas is not going to roll over you know what I mean. They've been here and they've have a great tradition. I told Coach (Taylor) Iceman since I've been at Monroeville, a long time ago, just to watch him, the way he's done with that program is impressive, he told Swankonsports.com after the win Tuesday night, If our kids play as hard as his kids you're going to be in a lot of games. So, it's impressive to watch those guys. We have got a resilient group. They're competitors, so I knew that when push came to shove, we'd be able to attack back.\n\nSeneca East (20-5) runs a non-typical 1-3-1 zone with match-up principles in it and Iceman says that made it difficult for them. It's not like a traditional 1-3-1. We've seen everything this year. Its essentially the same type of deal, they are just going to pack the paint and try and keep you out of there. It's not a traditional 1-3-1, so you can't do a lot of things that you would normally do against a 1-3-1, but it's a zone so you can't run a lot of your offensive sets. Again, it forces you to change what you do. Obviously, if we got to pick, wed say we want you to play man and we will run our stuff, he told Swankonsports.com in the locker room after the game, Early we may jump shots and you know it would give us a lead and then we quit making jump shots and against a zone, especially when they're packing like that you have got to be able to make some jump shots to bring them out, so that you can get to the rim. We knew we weren't going to shoot it well all night. I'm glad we shot it well for at least a portion of the night and that gave us a chance. When you're not shooting then you got to sustain it on the defensive end that much more. We chose a bad time to do both, not shoot it and not play real great defense.\n\nLogan Toms, the Cubs all-time leading scorer, had 24 on Tuesday night. Fellow senior Aiden Culler added 17.\n\nSeneca East shared the Northern 10 Athletic Conference title Colonel Crawford and two others and they beat the Eagles twice, (46-40) December 29 at Crawford and (53-44) on February 9 in Attica.\n\nLanghurst says this one will be tougher. To me the boys looked like they even got bigger than the last time we saw them. So, we're going to let the boys enjoy tonight and kind of get to work (Wednesday). Rest a little bit of legs, watch a little bit of film on the first couple games and just try to put a game plan together and see if we can stop some of their athletes, he said.\n\nPublished 3/06/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nDont miss a special Out of Bounds\n\nThis Saturday night 10 PM to 11 PM\n\nYour First Source for All Things Sports\n\nLucas Has to Handle the Ball\n\nLucas returns to Willard again this year as they will play Seneca East in a division IV district semifinal on Tuesday night.\n\nIts their seventh straight district appearance.\n\nThey beat Monroeville (49-40) to win a sectional last Friday.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they had to do some good things because Monroeville played well. I thought Monroeville played really well. They didn't have a great season by their standard. They didnt have a great record coming in, but they played really well. They played a little bit of zone against us. The (Gabe) Howell kid played really well. They have decent size and I thought they played really well. We played good enough to win and we played pretty good in spurts. I don't think we played horrible, but I thought they played really well. So, I give a lot of credit to coach (Paul) Roeder and their staff and their team for getting ready and playing a pretty good game the other night, said Iceman.\n\nLucas (19-5), the Mid-Buckeye Conference champ, meets Seneca East (19-5), the co-winner of the Northern 10 Athletic Conference. The Tigers walloped South Central (74-33) to claim their first sectional title in quite a while.\n\nIceman says they cause a lot of turnovers that lead to scores. They are just athletic. They have got three good guards and then some good size inside. They play a 1-3-1 and get a lot of deflections and just cause a lot of tips and turnovers and then they go score in transition. Offensively, they get a lot of shots up. If they're open, they'll pull the trigger and then they go offensive rebound and score that way and then turn around and play that 1-3-1 on you, so it makes it difficult. You have got to take care of the ball and then rebound. So, they've had a good year for a reason. They have got a really good team this year and they're playing really well right now, he said.\n\nAgainst that zone, Iceman believes its important to attack gaps and not throw a lot of long passes that are easily intercepted. I think it's really important that you attack the gaps. You can't make long passes over the top. They've got three guards that are pretty athletic, pretty quick and if you throw long passes they're going to run them down and get layups out of it. You can't give them easy points like that. You have got to keep them in front of you and make them work for their offense and then rebound, he told Swankonsports.com, They pull the trigger quick, so if you force them into a tough shot you have got to make sure you go rebound it. Then get the ball back and possess it and take care of it. Its just really important to take care of the ball against them. That's going to be a huge point of emphasis for us. Like I said, they've had a good season, but they're playing really well right now that's kind of that's what scares me a little bit.\n\nPublished 3/05/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nDont miss a special Out of Bounds\n\nThis Saturday night 10 PM to 11 PM\n\nYour First Source for All Things Sports\n\nLucas Wants to Do Their Stuff\n\nLucas, the Mid-Buckeye Conference champ, will be home for a sectional final in division IV on Friday night against the Monroeville Eagles of the Firelands Conference.\n\nOn Wednesday night, they hammered Crestline (79-41) in a semifinal game.\n\nThey trailed after the first quarter and coach Taylor Iceman says they just couldn't get anything going early. We came out a little slow. We've been working on some things with our defense trying to make some changes for some potential opponents down the road. We kind of backed off of a little bit of our pressure defense. We just came out and werent very aggressive and it carried over from our defense to our offense. Give Crestline a lot of credit, they came out and played really hard right from the start and they couldn't miss. They were knocking down shots. I think they hit four three pointers in the first quarter, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, It just kind of took us a little bit to get going. Ive talked about this this. It is one of the reasons why I don't like taking the buy in the first round. I always choose to play because it's just a different setting, especially this year playing at home in the first round. There's no JV game in front of your game. So, it's just kind of a different setting and different feeling. Sometimes it takes you a second to adjust to that. We were trying to do a few things differently and just wasn't a good start for us. Fortunately, we were able to ratchet our defense back up and get some life going and then we played a little bit more like ourselves the last three quarters.\n\nLucas (18-5) hosts Monroeville (8-15) on Friday night. The Eagles also won a semifinal (65-57) in overtime over Sandusky St. Marys on Wednesday.\n\nIceman admits before this week they didnt know much about Monroeville. We played them last year in the tournament in the district semifinals, but they graduated a lot from that team, really only just a few kids that played last year for them are on this team this year. To be honest, we haven't seen them a whole lot. We didn't plan this year or anything like that. We did see a little bit of film with them against some of our opponents that we watch. So, we were a little bit familiar with them, but we've watched a lot of film on them. I just had the team over to my house here, we had dinner and watched them, said Iceman.\n\nIceman says a lot times these games with short turnarounds are more about your execution. It's tournament basketball, you get basically a day and half after you just played. So, you flipped to a new opponent. Sometimes it's not so much about the opponent, but kind of what you do. So, we're going to come out and be us. We get to play home again this week, so hopefully we handle the situation a little better than we did the other night and it should be a little bit more comfortable and be ready to go right from the start in this one, he said.\n\nPublished 3/01/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nDont miss a special Out of Bounds\n\nThis Saturday night 10 PM to 11 PM\n\nYour First Source for All Things Sports\n\nLucas to be Tested by Ontario\n\nLucas wraps up the regular season with a game at Ontario on Saturday night.\n\nThe Cubs have won eight of their last nine games and coach Taylor Iceman likes what he sees from his team with the postseason starting next week. I think we've been playing pretty well lately. We've won a few big games in there and lost a tough one to a really good Willard team, but I thought we played pretty decent in stretches even in that game. So, we're hoping we're headed in the right direction you want to be playing well at this time of the year. The one thing with this team I think our role player guys have really grown a lot and they're starting to come into their own. We're fortunate we've got two really good players in Aiden Culler and Logan Toms. We've kind of said all year we would go as our role players went. As they've gotten better, we've certainly grown as a team and we're happy with where we're at right now, said Iceman.\n\nLucas (17-4) plays at Ontario (5-15) on Saturday night. The Warriors have lost five of their last six and have only one win over a plus .500 team this year.\n\nHowever, Iceman expects the Warriors to be inspired for this game. It'll be interesting to see we actually scrimmaged them as part of a three-way scrimmage early this year. We never really set up scrimmages due to our football success, we don't really know when we're going to get the basketball. So, we hopped in a scrimmage with them, so we got to see them early. We keep an eye on people that are on our schedule and we're preparing for them this week. So, it'll be interesting to see you know their growth from where they were at the beginning of season where they're at now, he told Swankonsports.com on Wednesday night, Its another big school that's going to be big out to get us. Similar to Clear Fork last week you know school that maybe didn't have the season that they wanted coming into it, but when they see a successful small school on their schedule at the end of the season and that's a chance for them to kind of right the ship and maybe end the season with on a on high note by you know beating a smaller school that's got a pretty good record. So, we know they're going to be hungry for us.\n\nLucas opens tournament play against Crestline next Wednesday and Iceman feels this is a good game for them to be playing. It's a big school, they play some bigger, stronger, faster opponents throughout the course of the season. So, we expect to see a bigger, stronger, faster brand of basketball, which is great for us at this time of year. That's we want to see so that we're prepared and just playing a little quicker than we're comfortable as we get ready to head to the tournament that just prepares you for the type of games that we're going to see hopefully in the district when we get there, he said.\n\nPublished 2/22/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nDont miss a special Out of Bounds\n\nThis Saturday night 10 PM to 11 PM\n\nYour First Source for All Things Sports\n\nLucas Wants to Send Message\n\nMid-Buckeye Conference champion Lucas hosts Crestline in a conference game on Friday night.\n\nThey have Plymouth in a non-league game on Saturday.\n\nLast week, they claimed their sixth straight conference title with a (61-58) win over Mansfield Christian.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they played well in what was a tough game. We're playing pretty good. I'd say started with a good win against Mansfield Christian. It was really good high school game, good high school atmosphere, a lot of people there and just a fun night for us to kind of close out the conference. It was a good win right before the draw, he said.\n\nLast Saturday, they lost (72-55) to Willard of the Bay Division of the Sandusky Bay Conference.\n\nIceman says Willard is a good team and they kind of ran out of gas. Then bounce back Saturday night and play a really good Willard team. We knew we were going to have our hands full, but at this time of the year we want to be playing good teams. They're going to challenge us even if we get beat there's not a whole lot lost there. You get to play one of the better teams in the area and a bigger school. They just play bigger, faster, stronger, and it's good for us at this time of year. We played with them for probably two and half quarters. They stretched out a little in the third and we played even the rest of the way. Id be lying if I didnt say we werent a little wore out from the night before. We had some kids out sick last week and we kind of had a big game Friday night. We honestly, we just got tired there in the third and they're really good and they made some shots and stretched out on so we just weren't able to come back on a team like that, said Iceman.\n\nThey added a (71-57) non-league win over Clear Fork on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Cubs (15-4,9-0) play at home against Crestline (3-17,2-6) on Friday night. The Bulldogs beat Loudonville (60-53) in a MBC game last Friday. They lost (76-41) to Bucyrus in a non-league game on Tuesday.\n\nLucas won (69-44) when they played January 12.\n\nIceman says they want to send a message on Friday. They played us pretty decent over there at their place the first time we played. Again, I'd be lying if I would tell you we were completely ready for them. We had Colonel Crawford the next night, so we were maybe kind of looking past that one a little bit. Now, we are going to finish out the league schedule and then it becomes the bigger game because they chose to play us in the tournament, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, It can go one of two ways, we can play like we're supposed to and kind of send a message that probably shouldn't know picked that slot there. If we don't go out and play very well, we are going to give them some hope and they're going to be coming in ready to go trying to upset us in the tournament and we certainly don't want that. So, where going to go out and play our brand of basketball and hopefully get through it and finish out the conference season with a good win.\n\nPublished 2/16/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOur scoreboard updated every five minutes\n\nOn Friday night at www.swankonsportshosting247.com\n\nLucas Needs Everyone to Play Well\n\nLucas can win an outright title in the Mid-Buckeye Conference with a win at home against Mansfield Christian.\n\nIf the Flames win, the two schools would share the lead.\n\nLucas has dominated the conference in recent years and coach Taylor Iceman says they look forward to playing in games like this. We talk about it every year. It's always our first goal to win our league. We've been fortunate in the last few years to do that. The group we have this year they just don't want to be the guys that that that turn that over and don't win the league. So, there's some extra fuel there. You play all season and we've put ourselves in a great spot. We were able to beat them over there the first time. So, now we have got to finish it off and beat him again at home on Friday night. It's a huge game for them and it's a big game for us for our league and then also the tournament draw is Sunday. We're both in the top four and this will help for seeding purposes there as well. So, hopefully playing well at this time of the year and it's cool to have a big game like that makes for a fun atmosphere and we're looking forward to it, said Iceman.\n\nLucas (13-3,8-0) plays host to Mansfield Christian (15-3,7-1) on Friday night. In their first meeting, the Cubs rallied to beat Christian (64-62) to take first place in the league back on January 5.\n\nIceman says the Flames are very athletic and are going to pressure them. They're super athletic. They want to pressure and turn you over and score that way. We did a good job of handling their pressure over there early and then then we didn't and they stretched a little bit of a lead out on us and then we slowed things back down a little bit and played even with them and then was able to eventually get over the hump. It was a really good game over there. We're happy that we're at home. A little bit more spacing on our floor as opposed to their gym over there. It's tough, they just have athletes and especially playing in that little gym it's tough to take care of the ball. We're hoping we can handle the ball a little better this time and impose our will on them, he said.\n\nSeniors Logan Toms and Aiden Culler have been the Cubs leading scorers all year, but Iceman says they are going to continue to need their roles players to do good things. We're fortunate we've got two guys that do a lot of our scoring, but to be honest here lately with some of our wins and some of our growth this season, our role players have really stepped up. Early on we talked about how we would go as far as our role players would take us this year. We've had some games where Logan (Toms) and Aiden (Culler) have just won the game for us with what they're able to do, but here lately some of our bigger games, and even Saturday night with Central Christian, which was a big game for us, seniors Gabe Porter and Keaton Day stepped up and filled their roles, he told Swankonsports.com on Tuesday night, They're playing with more confidence and they've kind of found their role. Those guys are huge, especially when you have got two guys that get as much attention as Logan and Aiden. Theyre going to need them to play well no matter who we're playing for us to have a chance to win, but again the thing that's kind of put us over the hump here lately has been our other guys playing well.\n\nPublished 2/07/2024\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Needs to Take Care of Business\n\nLucas will be at home for the Kidron Central Christian Comets in a game in the Mid-Buckeye Conference on Friday night.\n\nThe Cubs lead the conference standings by one over Mansfield Christian. Central Christian is two games back.\n\nLucas lost (43-31) to Colonel Crawford in a non-conference game on Saturday night.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they learned a lot. I won't say it was a butt whoopin, but they just took it to us. It was so crazy, we had six points at halftime, and usually at that point you would say well you're done, but they only had 12. So, we weren't out of it. The way both teams play defense six points was more like being up 15 in that game. We lost the game, but I think we're going to learn a little bit more from that. We're still kind of beat up. Zach Diehl, one of our seniors, one of our returning guys, he's dealing with a back injury and he's trying to get that figured out. We held him out Friday night then he tried to go Saturday and he played the first few minutes and just wasn't able to do anything. So, we're trying to get him figured out. Then Zach Winters, our big guy, our junior, he's been dealing with an ankle injury as well. So, we're a little beat up and we don't have as many bodies as we've had in years past as it is. So, it's been a challenge with even practices. I mean we've been practicing with seven guys and it makes it tough. So, we're figuring it out. I told the guys in the locker room, I think we take a lot more from that game getting beat there than we do in the district when I hope to see them again. I think that kind of opened our eyes up a little bit and we'll know what to expect next time we're playing because I think there'll be a lot more on the table, said Iceman.\n\nLucas (9-2,5-0) will welcome Kidron Central Christian (5-6,3-2) on Friday night. The Comets lost (68-56) to Mansfield Christian in a league game last Friday.\n\nIceman says this is an important game for them. They're tough, they have got five or six guys they can play. We went over there earlier this year. Its a place we always struggle to play and we played fairly decent over there. I remember that game Bobby Grover made some outside shots for us, which helps playing against their 2-3 zone. When you can extend them out a little bit and then open up some lanes for our other guys to get to the basket. So, it's a big game for us within our league. Mansfield Christian knocked them off last weekend. So, we can kind of almost knock them out of the race from our standpoint if we're able to take care of business on Friday. They're tough, they always give us fits, and we know this is a big game for us, he said.\n\nOn Monday, the Cubs travel to unbeaten Crestview, the Firelands Conference leader.\n\nIceman says they are looking forward to the challenge. These are the games that we want on our schedule. These non league games against bigger, better opponents. They are going to push us and force us to be better. Just the fun atmosphere that we want. They're having a great year, coach (John) Kurtz always does a great job with his teams. It's going to be a fun environment just because theyre 15-0 and they're fan base is pumped about it, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, We talk a lot about always us having the target on our back and we have got to show up every night and play. It'll be nice to go over there and just kind of play the underdog a little bit. We were able to get them at our place last year. We're just going to kind of take that same attitude into it and go over there. We would like to win, but even if you lose that one there you get a lot more out of just playing in that environment and in a in a big game. That just helps our team grow towards our goals that we still have in front of us with our conference and then ultimately the tournament.\n\nPublished 1/19/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOur scoreboard updated every five minutes\n\nOn Friday night at www.swankonsportshosting247.com\n\nLucas Works Hard\n\nLucas, the Mid-Buckeye Conference Leader, travels to Crestline to face the Bulldogs in a conference game on Friday night.\n\nThey plat at Colonel Crawford in a non-conference game on Saturday night.\n\nLast Friday, Logan Toms scored 32 points on a bad ankle and the Cubs beat Mansfield Christian (64-62) to take sole possession in the conference.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they battled through adversity to get that win. Logan Toms got going real hot there early and was kind of carrying us a little bit and then he rolled his ankle and he had come out of the game. We turned it over and kind of put ourselves in a hole and then he came back. Zach Diehls been dealing with some injuries and we had another one of our starters Zac Winters go down with an ankle injury. So, we were deep into our bench. It was just a good team win. Everybody kind of sold their role and then Aiden (Culler) and Logan obviously did a big chunk of the scoring for us, but a lot of kids did a lot of good things that that don't show up in the in the stat book. Ultimately, it was a great win for us there beating them at their place the first time around in in conference play, said Iceman.\n\nIceman says they work hard and that pays off for the Cubs. We don't have a ton of experience, but Aiden Culler and Logan Toms I've said it 100 times, I think they're good enough to play or start at any school in the area, big or small. They were the two guys handling the ball at the end of the game and making free throws and just doing winning things, he told Swankonsports.com on Monday night, We talked after the game and then tonight even at practice and just said I think we won that game last week during practice. We had some rough practices last week and I don't know anything about Mansfield Christians practices last week, but I would find it hard to believe that they worked harder than us last week. When you can do that and then go in and win a good game and feel good about it, it just helps the kids buy in that much more and hopefully that can kind of jumpstart us set the tone for our season.\n\nLucas (8-1,4-0), #5 in the Swankonsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in eh small school division, is at Crestline (1-9,1-3) on Friday night. The Bulldogs lost (83-68) to Loudonville in a conference game last Friday.\n\nIceman says they have to have a business like attitude. This is one thing that we've you know dealt with this season and over the years really. You can't overlook anybody and on any given night anybody can get beat. We've seen this year that we're capable of being pretty good and we're capable of being very bad. So, you have got to go out and just play one way all the time and then we have a big game Saturday night. So, it's not like we can go out and do a bunch of bad things. We just want to play well Friday night, get the win, pick up another conference win and feel good about it and then you know get ready for a tough test on Saturday night, he said.\n\nPublished 1/09/2024\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Must Handle Christian Pressure\n\nLucas and Mansfield Christian, the co-leaders in the Mid-Buckeye Conference, square off on Friday night at the Furnace.\n\nThe Cubs (7-1,3-0), #5 in the Swankonsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in the small school division, lost for the first time this season to division II Galion (61-41) last Friday.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says hopefully they learned a lesson. It was similar to what I thought could possibly happen. Like I said, we played some teams where we were able to make some mistakes and still win. We have kind of been telling our kids you know we can't do that kind of stuff when we're playing good teams. Going over to Galion, we played a decent first half. A good first quarter, we came out and played really well from the start and it was kind of downhill from there. We did not have a good second half. Galions got some good players and made some shots and put a little run together and then we just couldn't make up the ground. Just wasn't a very good showing by us. I thought that we had the potential to have that in us just with the way our schedule was set up, said Iceman.\n\nIceman says the loss to Galion is going to make them a better team. It's not a bad thing. Obviously, you want to win them all, but I think we needed to be humbled a little bit. Nothing's lost by losing a non conference game early in the season. If you handle it the right way, it can help you down the road. We don't want to lose anything. We want to win every time we go out there, but it wasn't a bad thing completely. We're going to take some things from it and hopefully we're better because of it, he said.\n\nMansfield Christian (6-2,3-0) also lost a non-conference game, (63-53) to Nothmor, in their last outing on Saturday.\n\nIceman says the Flames will be ready for them. He says they have to handle the press. It started with Galion, but we've got a tough little stretch of games here. Mansfield Christian is one of the better teams in our league and we've been fortunate to win our league for the last handful of years. Everybody else is sick and tired of us winning it. So, we expect to get their best shot. We have to go over to their gym. It's a tough place to play, its just small and there's not much spacing and just makes things more difficult over there, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, It's going to be a challenge. We didn't play real great when we went over there last year. So, they're going to be fired up. This is the first time around with them. We get them twice this year. It's at their place. They're going to want to knock us off, so we have got to be ready to go. We've been preparing. We have got to take care of the ball. They want to pressure you and turn you over and score that way, so you have got to take care of the ball. I think that's the most important thing when playing Mansfield Christian this year.\n\nPublished 1/05/24\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOur scoreboard updated every five minutes\n\nOn Friday night at www.swankonsportshosting247.com\n\nLucas Finds a Challenge in Galion\n\nLucas will be over at Galion to take on the Tigers out of the Mid-Ohio Athletic Conference on Friday night.\n\nIt will be one of the Cubs toughest challenges so far this season.\n\nThey smoked Loudonville (66-39) in a Mid-Buckeye Conference game last Friday.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they got a little better in the process. Not too bad, we had some good moments and some not so good moments, but overall I think we improved on some things. We talked about this stretch of games where we were favored and we were supposed to win. We talked about that in the locker room after that game that we're learning some things about ourselves. Sometimes, it's nice to be able to go out and do that and you can mess around with some things, do some different things, see some different groups on the floor together and not have to worry about the outcome of the game and whether it's going to cost you the game. So, we're trying to be positive and take good things from those games, he said.\n\nLucas (7-0), #3 in the Swankonsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in the small school division, is at Galion (4-2) on Friday night. The Tigers beat Marion Pleasant (52-43) last Saturday.\n\nIceman says the Tigers offer up the kind of challenge they havent seen in a while. We've been talking about this one for a little bit here kind of knowing that we had that stretch of games and knowing you're going to come out of the Christmas break. We've played some opponents that we were supposed to win and we haven't had to put in a ton of effort. So, we knew now you come out of the break you go over to Galion and play on a little bit bigger floor against the bigger school, he told Swankonsports.com on Wednesday night, When you play the bigger schools it's just a faster paced game, more physical and it just makes it that much more of a challenge. Sometimes you can make mistakes and get away with it against some of the opponents that we have been playing, but that's not going to be the case Friday night. They're pretty good, they have got good players, some good shooters. I know Tyler's (Sanders) excited to try and get a little revenge. He was over at Crestline for a long time and now he's over at Galion and he's ready to knock us off.\n\nIceman says Galion is hard to guard, but they pride themselves in their defense. They certainly go as they shoot it. The Kent kid, he shoots as well as anybody in the area and if you let him get going, he'll put up some big numbers real quick. That's kind of how they want to play. They have got a couple other guys, the Chapin kid can get to the rim and create and kicks it outside and finds those shooters. That's what makes them challenging. Fortunately for us, we hang our hat on the defensive end and we've been preparing for them. We're going to do our best to try and keep them in check and make them take tough shots and then hopefully those tough shots lead to rebounds and transition for us. That's how we like to play, said Iceman.\n\nPublished 12/28/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Must do Little Things\n\nLucas plays at home against Loudonville in a Mid-Buckeye Conference game on Friday night.\n\nLast week, the Cubs took care of business in beating Mansfield St. Peters (67-21) in a conference game and South Central (75-48) in non-league play.\n\nHowever, coach Taylor Iceman says there are still some things that need to be cleaned up. We did we what we needed to. We still weren't real happy. One thing I've been harping on the kids as I look back through our scorebooks and we've only won one fourth quarter. Thats kind of a challenge to some of our guys that are substitutions and some of our key guys that come in. They're going to be playing in the games and I think they should win those games at the end of the game, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, Its not time to get in there and screw off because we're up by a bunch, its time to get in and work and get better. It's only going to help us down the road and continue to make us a better team. So, we won and that's the important thing, but like I said, we still want to take good things out of those games when we're winning by good margins there.\n\nLucas (6-0,2-0), #3 in the Swankonsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in the small school division, entertains Loudonville (1-4,0-2) on Friday night. The Redbirds lost (51-44) to Kidron Central Christian in a league game last week.\n\nIceman says again this week its about focus. Its another game we think we should win, so we can't go in with the mindset well just show up and go through the motions. We have got to go out and play and execute and again continue to work to get better and just do the little things. That's one thing we've really been harping on this season because like I said sometimes in these games you can go out and you can get away with playing you know a little sloppy or a little lazy and when we get into some bigger games down the road or later in the season you're not going to be able to do those types of things, so you can't create bad habits and things like that, said Iceman.\n\nIceman says they have to always be at their best because their name is circled. It's a focused thing we're really, really harping on those type of small things here as we hopefully head into the break here with a with a conference win. Everybody wants to beat Lucas, especially in our league, they're sick of seeing us win and so we know we're going to get everybody's best shot. If you go in and you overlook somebody that could be the night you get knocked off, he said.\n\nPublished 12/22/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOur scoreboard updated every five minutes\n\nOn Friday night at www.swankonsportshosting247.com\n\nLucas Wants to Feel Good About Winning\n\nLucas plays host to Mansfield St. Peters in a game in the Mid-Buckeye Conference on Friday night.\n\nThey are at home for South Central in a non-conference game on Saturday night.\n\nOn Tuesday night, they dumped Danville (70-46) in non-conference play.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they pretty well for the most part. Yeah, not too bad. We went up there and we did what we needed to do early and kind of jumped out on them and then we kind of coasted a little bit. This stretch of games we have here it's going to be a great opportunity for us to really work on things. For some those guys that we had talked about that don't have a ton of varsity experience give me a great chance for them to just to get in there and learn some things and get better. These are games we should win. These are some teams that are in transition and they're trying to figure things out and we should be heavily favored, but we still have to be able to find ways to take things out of those games, he told Swankonsports.com on Wednesday night, We can't just show up and not play very good and win. You don't want to do that. You want to still play well and win and get better. Sometimes these games can be tough because it's hard to get things out and the kids sometimes don't get up for it. Then all you can do is just not play good and it just is bad. So, we've really been focused on that. We watched a lot of film (Wednesday) night and just kind of tried to look at the little things that we need to improve upon so when we get into the meat and the bones of our schedule we have got to do those things to be able to win games and this is a great opportunity for us to work on those things and try and get better.\n\nIceman says right now they are trying to make sure that everybody is on the same page. This group's got to get used to playing with each other. It doesn't work if you get two or three guys doing the right thing and then two or three guys not doing it. Everybody's got to be in sync. We've got to all be working together. We're going to be communicating, rotating and doing all those things that we've done and seen that make us successful in the in the past. We practice it and you work on it, but again it's always nice to be able to go out and do it against another team. A group that doesn't know your plays. Just things like that make a big difference. It's challenging that was a conversation that we had (Wednesday) night. It's hard to go out there when you get to the second half and you're up by 15-20 points. Sometimes it's easy to lose focus and just kind of go out and go through the motions, but in the process of doing that you're just creating bad habits. We always want to play one way no matter who we're playing. We're never going to be disrespectful to an opponent, but we have got to go out and get better each night. We need to learn how to go about that so again these games are important. We can't control who we play, all we can control is how we play, said Iceman.\n\nLucas (4-0,1-0) hosts Mansfield St. Peters (1-4,0-1) on Friday night. The Spartans won their first game of the season Monday night when they beat Mansfield Temple Christian (45-40).\n\nIceman knows they will be favored to win and if they do he wants the Cubs to enjoy it. The only thing we can do is go out and not play good or just create bad habits and things like that and that's obviously not something we want to do. We're all aware of the situation over there and what's going on and they're trying to figure things out as well, but again it's another opportunity for us. I always tell our kids it's one of 22 that you're guaranteed. We've been extremely fortunate in years past to win a lot of games and the one thing that I've kind of learned, again we spoke about this (Wednesday) night is sometimes our kids just expect to win and we win and we in the locker room and we just kind of go through the motions, he told Swankonsports.com, I think sometimes we take that for granted. I told them I want to celebrate winning. I want to have fun in the locker room after we win not just come in and say hey well we won, but we did this, this and this wrong. We have got to fix that because when we play the good teams, we can't do that. Then you feel bad about winning. You don't want that. We want to have fun when we win because we've been fortunate to do it a lot, but it's not easy. We put a lot of hard work and time and effort into it, so you have got to go out and enjoy winning and still take something out of these games that we should be favored and we should win, but we have got to go out work hard and feel good about it.\n\nPublished 12/14/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Must be in Top Gear\n\nLucas, traditionally one of the best small school basketball programs in this area, opens the season on Saturday night by hosting the Mohawk Warriors of the Northern 10 Athletic Conference.\n\nThe Cubs have some seniors with a lot of basketball experience, but coach Taylor Iceman says they need to be at their best on Saturday. We've got three starters back from last year that we will certainly rely on. It's a little different for us this year. Weve not, as I thought back of my career here, I don't know that we've played a team out of the gate as good as Mohawk. So, we have got to be ready to play and they say usually the first couple games you kind of feel things out. You play it and you see and you learn about what you have got to improve on and then you go get better through film and practice. We don't have any time to figure things out, we have got to go out and play because we have got to play a pretty good team right out of the gate. So, we'll learn a lot about ourselves on Saturday night, said Iceman.\n\nMohawk was the runner-up in the N10 last year and Iceman says they hare going to be tough to handle. We've prepared a little bit for that. We've never played them in the regular season, but we see them in the summertime and then obviously we watch a lot of Colonel Crawford film the last couple of years, so I've seen them that way and they're just a good team and program. Coach (Paul) Dunn does a great job with them and it's going to be interesting to see you know what they do, he said.\n\nMohawk has traditionally been a 2-3 match-up zone team, but they played a lot of man last season. Iceman says the need to be ready for both. I expect to see a lot of zone this year, but they've got some athletes and they do want to get up and pressure you. It'll be interesting to see you know what they do against us. We've prepared for both. We'll be ready to handle whatever. We get to play Central Christian two times a year forever and they run a really good 2-3 zone, so we do get to see quite a bit of that, he told Swankonsports.com on Wednesday night, I think our kids will be prepared for that. They play really hard and really aggressive and do a lot of good things. They have got a lot of kids back from last year, so we're going to have to be like I said focused and ready to go right out of the gate.\n\nPublished 11/30/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas to be Good Again\n\nLucas has been one the better small school basketball programs in this area over the last more than half decade and that should continue this year.\n\nHowever, coach Taylor Iceman says they do have a different mix of players than they have had in recent years. I'm excited, we've been practicing for couple weeks now. We went over and scrimmaged Madison last Saturday. We're starting to get after a little bit. It was good to go against somebody different. You sometimes get tired of going against a team that knows all your plays and everything that you do in practice, so it was good to go against somebody different. I'm excited, we've got some guys back, we've got some new guys. Weve got some guys that haven't played varsity basketball before. So, we have got a little bit of everything. A little bit different group than that I've had for the last few years. I've been really fortunate to have a lot of experience and a lot of guys that have played a lot of basketball. So, it's going to be a little bit of a different group, but I'm excited about it. I think we could have another successful year, said Iceman.\n\nLucas plays its first game at home against Mohawk on December 2. They open play in the Mid-Buckeye Conference on December 8 at Kidron Central Christian.\n\nIceman says he knows what to expect from his seniors, from his veteran players, but it will be the other players that will determine how good the Cubs can be. I fully intend to lean on them a lot at the entire year, but I know what I've got in those three guys because they started for me last year. I told the other guys that I fully believe that a lot of our success and failure is going to depend on our other guys, the role players, and some guys that haven't done it before. So, it's kind of up to them to really buy in and try and maximize their potential and we're working at that. It's just it's a little bit different than what we've had in years past, but I'm excited about it because it's nice to sometimes be able to see growth and things like that whereas in the last few years it was kind of like don't screw it up because we had a lot of talent, we had a lot of expectations and things like that. So, it's a different group this year, but our expectations aren't going to change and I honestly think we can have a really good year, he said.\n\nIceman adds that he doesnt need those guys to become superstars, he just needs them to be as good as their talent dictates. I tell them all the time, Logan Toms is our best player and that wouldn't matter what school he was at with exception of a few in the area. I mean hes really good. I tell our kids, I don't need you to be Logan, fortunately for us we have one of those. I don't need you to be Aiden Culler, because again he's another one of our guys thats going to do a ton for us this year. I know what I have got and what those guys can bring. I just need you to be the best version of you and to be able to fulfill your role. I don't need them to come out and score 25 points and I'm not going to ask them to do something that they're probably not capable of doing, he told Swankonsports.com on Tuesday night, I do need them to you know take care of the ball, make good decisions, play good defense and just play as hard as you can. They're doing a good job of that. I think the next part of that now is actually going out and doing it and that kind of reaping the benefits from it. They're probably tired of hearing me screaming and hollering and telling them they have got to work hard, got to play hard, got to do this and got to do that and not getting to see the good stuff. Going out and doing all that is why we do it. They're ready to experience a little bit of that and I'm excited too.\n\nPublished 11/22/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Must Control Trenches\n\nLucas meets Dalton, the Wayne County Athletic League champion, at Orrville Red Rider Stadium on Friday night in a division VII regional quarterfinal.\n\nLast week, the Cubs (8-3) dumped another team out of the WCAL in Hillsdale (28-14) in their first playoff game.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says they were able to win at the point of attack. I thought we came out and we controlled the line of scrimmage offensively and defensively for the whole game. When we can do that good things are going to happen for us and they did. We were able to get out of there with the victory and move on to week 12, he said.\n\nDalton (9-1) rocked Conotton Valley (54-12) in the opening round.\n\nSpitler says they score a lot points and dont give up much because they are so good in the trenches. I think it starts for them on the offensive and defensive lines. They have got great size and athleticism. Offensively, they move people, do a nice job of getting off the ball and blocking to the whistle. Defensively, their defensive line does a nice job of controlling their gaps and freeing up their linebackers to do their job, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, They've got great team speed at all of the skilled positions both offensively and defensively. A veteran team, several of these guys were sophomores when we played them in 21 and now they're seniors. You could tell they're just a very well disciplined, well coached, physical football team and it's going to be a tremendous challenge for our guys.\n\nDalton beat Lucas in a playoff game two years ago. Spitler this edition of the Bulldogs is more balanced. I think their systems are the same as they were in 21. I think they're more balanced as a team, especially offensively this year. In 21 they were led by you two tremendous athletes and while they don't have just two individuals, I think collectively as a group offensively that they're more balanced and dangerous in what they can do. The quarterback is a great athlete and does a great job of running their offense and being a threat both running and passing and then like I said they're sideline to sideline players defensively, said Spitler.\n\nSpitler says in many ways, the keys are the same as they always are, win up front. For us it's always how well we play in the trenches on both sides of the ball and this week would be no different. We've worked all week with our kids about this is going to be one of those heavyweight bout type battles. They're going to land punches and we've got to land our punches and keep moving forward and staying disciplined and playing to our game plan.

When you're independent you dont have a league championship to play for anything like that. So, the mindset is earning the opportunity to get in the postseason and then be playing your best football when you get there and I think we're heading in the right direction towards doing that.\n\nLucas (7-3) is at Hillsdale (8-2) on Friday night. The Falcons beat Lucas (21-17) on week two when quarterback Jack Fickes scored with 1:57 to play. Fickes ran for 120 yards and three touchdowns that night.\n\nSpiter says Fickes is the engine that runs the Falcons offense. They have just improved every week since we played in week two. They're very well coached, coach (Trevor) Cline does a great job and we have tremendous respect for their staff. They play sound defense and we've had trouble moving the ball on them because they're disciplined, they read their keys really well and they tackle well, he told Swankonsports.com on Monday night, Offensively, everything runs through Jack Fickes, he's a dangerous weapon that can put it in the end zone anytime he touches the ball. When he's the guy running the ship, as far as the captain of their offense, he's touching it on every play. So, he just stresses you so much and then they've got great skill at their running back position, the wide receiver position. So, they're playing a lot of young kids and then they've grown up now and playing really good football.\n\nFickes has run for 401 yards and 10 scores. He has thrown for 952 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nSpitler says as is usually the case, they have to control the point of attack if they are going to win the game. We have to have a good night up front. Both teams are very similar. They do it a different way than us, but we both want to run the ball and play good defense. It's going to come down to who can control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball.

The Red Devils beat Van Buren (28-6) in BVC game last week.\n\nSpitler says this is another team, like them, that likes to run the ball. Its a very similar mindset that we have. They want to run the football like we do. They do it out of an option package, triple option, veer option. So, it might be one of those quick high school football games with two teams that want to control the line of scrimmage and run the football. They're extremely talented. They have got great speed and athleticism at their skilled positions and nice size and up front in the trenches on both sides of the ball, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, We're expecting a physical battle. This will be the third time we've played them and they've gotten us the last two times we've played them in tight ballgames. So, we've got a tremendous challenge and we want to finish strong on senior night in the regular season.\n\nSpitler says they would really like to beat these guys and if they do there are some other pluses too. We have a lot to play for Friday night. First and foremost, we want our seniors to get a victory on their last regular season home game. Then we want to be able to earn the right to host a playoff game at Bob Wine. Then just the opportunity to maybe get off the snide and get one against them because like I said we haven't got a victory against them the last two times.

The varsity guys did exactly what we wanted them to do and got out early and impose their will early. Then the ability to get some of our younger kids in for pretty much a little over a half. From about the mid second quarter on we were playing a lot of our JV and young kids. So, that's important, especially this time of year you are still trying to work and continue to build depth and get them experience and stuff, especially on Friday night. It was a just a good evening for our entire team, said Spitler.\n\nThe Lucas coach says an additional benefit was they didnt get anyone hurt. That's always a plus as well, especially this late in the season.

So, anytime that you can this late in the season and get out of a game healthy, that's a plus, he said.\n\nLucas (5-3) hosts Fort Loramie (5-3) on Friday night.

A lot of length and height. Very similar to what you get in a MAC school. A lot of 62 to 64 guys, 200 to 225, very athletic. They have a three year starter at running back, who stretches you vertically and horizontally and good size up front, he told Swankonsport.com on Wednesday night, Defensively, they get after it really well. I think they move sideline to sideline with their speed pretty good. They have the same record as us, their losses have come to some very good football programs, just like ours have, so we expect a very tough game Friday night.\n\nPublished 10/12/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Plays Similar Plymouth\n\nLucas plays host to Plymouth in high school football action on Friday night.\n\nThe Cubs took Lima Central Catholic to the end last week before losing (34-37) to the Thunderbirds last Friday.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says it really did come down to the end. We knew we were going to be in a battle. They're very talented offensively. It was kind of back and forth all night and came down to they stopped us twice and we only stopped them once and fell short there at the end. We told our kids all week it was going to be tremendous challenge and it was going to be like you're playing in the playoffs where two teams were going to have heavyweight bout and you're just going to have to keep throwing body blows and give yourself a chance to be there. We were there, they just happened to make one more stop than we did and that was the difference in the game, said Spitler.\n\nSpitler believes they are still improving and that is their goal again this week. We had a nice little run there four straight and things were getting better and we're still getting better as a football team. We played a pretty good football game Friday night against a very good football team and came out on the short end. We learned a lot, we got into film and saw where we had deficiencies and that's where we're focusing on this week. Were trying to work to continue to play our best football as the season goes on, which is where we want to be, he said.\n\nLucas (4-3) plays at home against Plymouth (2-5), a (57-6) loser last week to Crestview in Firelands Conference play.\n\nSpitler says it is kind of weird this week preparing for a team that does a lot of what they do because usually it is quite the opposite. On the practice field (Tuesday) some of our kids were talking about how weird it was preparing for a team that does some similar things that that that we do. While they don't have the roster size right now, they've got some really tough, hardnosed kids that play hard. Layne Bushey at running back is a tremendous athlete and dangerous every time he touches the ball for them on offense. The Keefe brothers they have good talent and speed, he told Swankonsports.com on Tuesday night, I saw them play live in their scrimmage versus Smithville earlier this season when I was scouting Smithville. The one thing I came away from even though they're roster size is not big is their kids play extremely hard and theyre physical and they have got a good size. So, it's going to be a nice task for us kind of eerily similar as far as our attacks and everything, but it's going to be a nice challenge for our kids this week.\n\nPublished 10/04/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Faces Tough Running Monroeville\n\nFor the Lucas Cubs its another team from the Firelands Conference as they are at Monroeville to tangle with Eagles on Friday night.\n\nThey were at Crestview last week and beat the Cougars (26-6) on Friday night.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says they made some quality adjustments. We came out strong and then I thought we got a little complacent late in the first quarter. You can't do that against good football teams. Crestview tightened things up there and it was 7-6 at halftime. I thought we did a nice job of making some adjustments and our kids put the pedal down and took care of the football in the second half. We were able to get out of there with a good win, he said.\n\nLucas (3-2) is at Monroeville (4-1) on Friday night. The Eagles thrashed South Central (41-6) in a Firelands Conference game last week. Their only loss comes to unbeaten Tiffin Calvert by a point.\n\nSpitler says they have a tremendous running game that is hard to stop. They are a dangerous football team that's playing good football right now. Offensively, they put up over 40 points against Crestview the week before we played Crestview, so they definitely get your attention. They're led by tremendous athlete at quarterback in Evan Benfer. He does it all. Hes a passing threat, hes a tremendous runner from the quarterback position. When you get the quarterback that involved in the run game, that's plus one in the run game, so that's concerning, he told Swankonsports.com on Wednesday night, They have got great size up front and they get off the ball well. His running mate in the backfield Landon Roeder at running back is dangerous as well. Then they have got a 65 wide receiver that does a great job of going up after the ball. So, they're going to be a tremendous challenge for our defense. Then defensively, they're just extremely aggressive get down get downhill really well at the linebacker position and are very physical.\n\nSpitler says the Monroeville running game can be very deceptive too. Their run game is very potent and where he stresses you on the edge he looks like he's passing the ball while he's eating up yardage attacking the line of scrimmage with the run game. So, he does a nice job of selling what looks like a pass and that turns into being a quarterback run on the sweep or an off tackle power. So, they have got a very potent attack and it's going to be a tremendous challenge for us. Then vice versa on the other side now their defense has done a nice job at the line of scrimmage. We're going to have to bring it and it's going to be a four quarter battle, said Spitler.\n\nPublished 9/21/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas and Crestview in Physical Battle\n\nLucas is up at Crestview to play the Cougars in a non-conference game on Friday night.\n\nBoth teams base their offensive success on running the ball and the play action pass.\n\nThe Cubs (2-2), however, did not throw a single pass in their (49-14) romp over Warrensville Heights last week at Bob Wine Field.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says they executed their game plan. I thought we did a good job of executing our game plan and forcing them to play our game. The guys up front did a nice job and then Logan Toms had a really good night for us, he said.\n\nLogan Toms ran for 210 yards and four touchdowns last week.\n\nSpitler says they got great blocking up front and Toms was able to take advantage. We got a really good job from our wing back and our fullback doing a nice job of setting the edge and kicking out for us. They were overloading them on one side of the front for us and so we had to take advantage of the side where they weren't and our guys did a nice job of that, he said.\n\nCrestview (2-2) was outscored (46-34) by Monroeville in a Firelands Conference game last Friday.\n\nSpitler says the Cougars are a good football team that does a solid job in the trenches. I think they have played some good football games and they've lost a couple close ones against good football teams similar to us there at the beginning of the season. When you're playing good competition you don't have a very big area for mistakes and they come back and haunt you. They they've lost a couple games just like we have, but this is one thing I do know, they've got a very good program, they're well coached, coach (Steve) Haverdill and his staff do a great job, he told Swankonsports.com on Tuesday evening, They've got tough, physical kids that that do a nice job and they have got a lot of experience back on their offensive line that's evident in the points that they're putting up offensively. I think they're averaging a little more than 30 points a game right now offensively. I think it has a lot to do with the guys up front for them led by Caleb Cunningham.\n\nThis could be a big game for both teams in terms of possible playoff seeding. Spitler says they have to win at the point of attack. I think both teams will definitely be ready to play on Friday night. We're back in their house after playing there last year and taking it on the chin. So, we know what we're getting into, we know they're good football team and we have got to be ready to play. Again, it's another week where we've got to be really good up front on both sides of the ball, said Spitler.\n\nPublished 9/13/2023\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nJoin us this week at the\n\nBellville Street Fair\n\nCome say hi at our booth\n\nLucas Hurting Themselves\n\nIts time for the home opener for the Lucas Cubs as they host the Smithville Smithies on Friday night.\n\nHillsdale scored a touchdown with under 2:00 to play last week and beat Lucas (21-17) in the end.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says Hillsdale is a very good team, but they were their own worse enemy again last week. It was another week where we felt like we were in a position to get out of there with a win and then came up short. Taking nothing away from the two teams we've played because they're darn good football teams, but I'm not sure we have anymore bullets left in the chamber so to speak because we've done a pretty good job the first two weeks of shooting ourselves in a foot at inopportune times. We've really focused this week on trying to clean that up and not put ourselves in that situation anymore, said Spitler.\n\nOf course, the Cubs offense is old school and run based and Spitler says big penalties and mistakes really hurt them. When you play the competition and the schedule that we play you dont have the room for error to do those type of things. We're not built to play behind the sticks with penalties and things like that. So, that's stuff that we've just got to get cleaned up or we're just going to continue to put ourselves in these bad situations, he said.\n\nSmithville (2-0) destroyed Louisville St. Thomas Aquinas (51-8) last week in game two action.\n\nSpitler says the Smithies have the look of a very good football team. They are physical and put some athletes on the field. They are a typical Wayne County Athletic League team. They're big, they're physical, they play good football and you can tell they're well coached. They have got a good athlete at quarterback and a nice stable running backs that can stress you in so many ways. Some good length at wide receiver, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, Defensively, they play downhill and are aggressive. It's going to be another battle. It's going to be won in the trenches and the turnover battle. So, we've got to do a better job up front on both sides of the ball controlling the line of scrimmage. We have got to be clean, like I said, no penalties no turnovers.\n\nPublished 9/01/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOur scoreboard updated every five minutes\n\nOn Friday night at www.swankonsportshosting247.com\n\nLucas Needs to be Better up Front\n\nLucas hopes to rebound for a tough loss to Clear Fork on week one as they travel to Hillsdale to meet the Falcons out of the Wayne County League on Friday night in non-conference play.\n\nClear Fork edged the Cubs (17-14) in double overtime last week.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says it was a great game, they just came up a play short on the road. Obviously, you would like to have a different outcome, but Im pleased with the effort of the kids going two overtimes. I thought we played pretty good defensively. Actually, it ended up being a battle of two pretty solid defenses. They just happened to make one more play than we did. We did get out of there healthy, which is a good thing. We definitely have things that we have go to improve on this week to get ready for a quality Hillsdale program, said Spitler.\n\nLucas prides itself in how good they are in the trenches and Spitler says they have to get better there. I just think consistency in the trenches. While we did some really good things and we played with a good motor and effort. Just some fundamental technique things like attacking the correct shoulder or things like that, pushing the double team the correct way, just a few things. It just seemed like we were just too inconsistent in our execution to sustain drives and you can't have that when you're playing a good defense, he said.\n\nHillsdale smoked Black River (34-8) in their first game last Friday.\n\nSpitler describes them as a typical Falcons team that going to physical and has a quarterback that can make plays. They are a typical Hillsdale team, very well coached. They graduated Hoverstock at quarterback, who was a tremendous dangerous weapon with his athleticism. What do they go and do. They move (Jack) Fickes from wide receiver in the quarterback to get the same type of weapon. He stresses you with his arm, he stresses you in their option game. They have got great size up front, so we'll be undersized again this week, he told Swankonsports.com, Then they just play very sound defense. So, it's going to be a tall task for us. Our games have always been close with them. The last two games it was a one point and a two point game, so we know they're well coached, their kids are hard, tough and physical and it's going to be a four quarter war Friday night.\n\nPublished 8/22/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas to Face Talented Clear Fork\n\nLucas meets Clear Fork at the Corral in the annual Hall of Fame game on Friday night in non-league action.\n\nBoth had very successful seasons last year.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says the Cubs are ready for it to not be preseason anymore. Well they're excited for it to be finally game week, but they understand the challenge that they have in front of them with the quality Clear Fork program. So, they're focused and their intensity of practice this week so far has been really solid, he said.\n\nClear Fork was (10-2) and outright champions of the Mid-Ohio Athletic Conference last year. They edged Lucas (21-20) at Lucas last fall.\n\nSpitler says this is another very good Colt team they will be facing. Another solid Clear Fork team. They always play a tough, physical brand of football. They expect success. Obviously, with the coaching change and they're running new offensive and defensive schemes, but you could tell they're well coached. They have got great size and athleticism on both sides of the ball. I think it's going to come down to are we going to be able to handle their size and athleticism in the trenches come Friday night because they're really strong looking on both sides of the ball in the trenches. Then at the second level defensively they got great speed. Their tailback (Luke) Schlosser is a danger to take to the house on any play. So, we have got to play really well and win the winners ratio speak, said Spitler.\n\nThat means win the turnover battle.\n\nClear Fork has a new coach in Aaron Brokaw, so there is some mystery as to what they will do, but Spitler expects a power attack. When you've got the size they have up front now and the running back that they have in Schlosser you want to establish the last scrimmage and run the football and that's what they were showing in their scrimmages. You can't sleep on the pass game, they've got a tremendous amount of skill at the tight end and receiver positions, he told Swankonsports.com on Tuesday evening, They've been rotating a couple quarterbacks that not only can hurt you with their arm, but as a dual threat as runners too. So, they've got a complete attack with what they do. They're big tight end is always a mismatch problem and then with (Joe) Stupka at receiver, you're talking about a state qualifier and state placer or in the sprint events. So, they don't lack skill and they don't lack size, so it's going to be a tall task for us.\n\nPublished 8/16/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas With a Veteran Lineup\n\nLucas, a traditional small school powerhouse, looks like they are set for a very good season this year.\n\nThey open on August 18 at Clear Fork in non-conference play.\n\nCoach Scott Spitler says they have a lot kids back that have experience on the gridiron. I think we've got a good mix of experience coming back. We were young last year on our offensive and defensive line, so we got pretty much all of our guys back there in the trenches for us. Obviously, we have got to replace a three-year starter quarterback in Andrew Smallen, but we have got a young man that's been a three-year starter for us moving into that spot from running back to quarterback, so he's got Friday night experience it just hasn't been at the quarterback position in Grayson Jackson. We have to replace Corbin Toms defensively and then offensively, but the Aiden Culler who started for us as a tight end his sophomore year, but last year just played DB and kicked and punted for us, will move back over to tight end there and replace Corbin, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, Then we return our entire backfield, both wingbacks, both fullbacks, so we got pretty good experience. We return eight of 11 on defense and ten of 11 on offense, so I like where we are experience wise, but the problem is our depths is not where I want to be and we need to find a few more bodies to provide some depth because it's going to take more than just the starting group to get through our schedule and the type of football that we play.\n\nWhen they have new kids at the varsity level, Spitler says it helps that they run their unique system with younger kids too. What helps us is our systems are being run from our youngest peewee team all the way up to the high school level, so our kids have the foundation. So, even though they're young as far as on Friday night experience and stuff their experience in our system is there, so the learning curve goes a little bit quicker. Also having the postseason runs that we have that's two or three weeks of extra practice that not every team gets, so that gives you an opportunity for those younger kids to kind of mature in the postseason as well in practice. So, our kids are working really hard. We've got good numbers, we've got a roster of 41 guys out this season and they're working their tails off and we're excited about the season getting started here, said Spitler.\n\n41 guys at the division VII level is outstanding and Spitler says that allows them to do some things in practice. It was interesting the couple COVID years and stuff where some of our younger because we didn't have peewee football during those two COVID years and things like that so it kind of affected some of our lower grade numbers, but we're starting to get that resurgence back. It really makes things a lot nicer practice wise and preparation wise when you have that many kids because we're getting a lot of work done and running a lot of reps. So it helps us in developing that depth as well that we're going to need for the season, he said.\n\nPublished 8/04/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds every Friday night 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday every week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nYour First Source for Everything Sports\n\nSeneca East Outlasts Lucas\n\nSeneca East scored one in the first and one in the seventh and held off Lucas (2-1) on Wednesday night in a division IV district semifinal at Hiese Park in Galion.\n\nThey will play Colonel Crawford (15-12) for a district title on Friday evening in Galion. The Eagles beat Mohawk (4-2) on Wednesday.\n\nLucas starter Andrew Smollen walked Aiden Hines to start the game, Nicolas Parks got a sacrifice bunt to move him to second, there was a passed ball and then a sacrifice fly by pitcher Caden Fritz to score the run. There was no scoring until the top of the seventh when the Tigers Cody Heibertshausen was hit by a pitch, Graham Gibbs bunted for a hit when no one covered first base and Heibertshausen scored when the Cubs made an error on a ball hit by Parks.\n\nIt was (2-0) Tigers, but the Cubs wouldnt go quietly. With one out, Conner Rice reached on an error, moved to third on another error and scored on a wild pitch, but Fritz got the final out to secure the win.\n\nFritz went all seven, as did Smollen. Fritz allowed only two hits and he struck out only three. However, the Cubs only hit the ball out of the infield only four times.\n\nSeneca East coach Rick Bowerman says Fritz gets a lot of soft contact. He's able to mix his pitches, hit his spots, he doesn't throw a lot of meat fastballs, so he gets that weak contact. This is district baseball, it's low scoring you have got to make plays, he said.\n\nSmollen permitted only three hits while striking out three.\n\nLucas coach Courtney Church says they have had some issues with good pitching and that continued on Wednesday. We know over the past couple of years the problems we have had. Thats what I reiterated to everybody when we started this journey. I told them our bats have to pick up. Youre going to start to see better pitching and you are going to have to square baseballs up and doing the little things. (Seneca East) found a way there in the first inning. We had that little bumble there and in the seventh and the ball goes through his legs. At the end of the day, (Bobby) Grover is a hot mess right, but this this doesn't fall back on Grover shoulders. You have to square baseballs up and I mean we have one in there we have the runner on and I mean you don't see too often the pitcher makes three outs, said Church.\n\nBowerman says they didnt get many hits, or guys on base, but they executed when hey did. I know we did a great job the first inning. We get a walk, a SAC bunt, passed ball and then we scored a SAC fly. That's how you manufacture runs. Same thing there in the last inning for the last run, we get a walk and we get a base hit blunt and I got a guy who I am very confident, so with two strikes I'm telling him, hey, you are bunting anyway and he places it perfect, he told Swankonsports.com after the win on Wednesday night, I didn't even see what happens next, a bad bounce base hit or an error under the legs. I was watching our guy coming from second to third and the ball gets by the shortstop and we were scoring. So, I'm very proud of the kids.\n\nOf course, Seneca East (15-12) and Colonel Crawford are in the same league. The Tigers won both meetings, (8-7) on April 18 and (4-0) the next day.\n\nBowerman says he expects a battle. We played them twice in the regular season. We were lucky enough to beat them both times. They are definitely a very dangerous team. I anticipate a low scoring game. Both games we won were close.

You know sitting here tonight watching Lex and Shelby and Mansfield and Sandusky just kind of gets you excited again just to get back in that big game atmosphere. The first time around both teams made runs throughout that game. Early we were up on them some and then they got up on us and then we kind of came back, but they were able to get us there early. I can say it now because we lost to him the first time around, but I think we probably took a little bit more out of it losing that game maybe we would if we would have won looking back on it now. Again, I would have taken the win at the time, don't get me wrong, but that's how we feel right now, he said.\n\nLucas beat Monroeville (49-37) on Tuesday night in a semifinal after leading only (18-14) at the half and Colonel Crawford also pulled away down the stretch to beat Norwalk St. Paul (64-51) on Tuesday.\n\nBraxton Baker had 28 points Tuesday and Jacob Maddy added 25 for the Eagles and Iceman says almost everything they do is with the intention of getting one of those guys the ball. They run everything through those two and the majority of its inside. A lot of their action and sets that they run it's inside. They're both big kids and they're effective in the paint, but then Baker he's able to step out and knock down threes and that's why he averages 20 points a game he can get you inside and outside. They run a lot of that action inside and then they'll drift out to the three-point line and get lost every once in a while. You're trying to pay attention so much to the paint that they can hurt you there as well. I've been watching film and been watching them ever since we lost to them because we knew this was probably coming. We've prepared ourselves for this game, so we're going to go out and be confident. I'm excited for (Friday) night, said Iceman.\n\nLike Lucas, Crawfords program is built on defense. Lucas likes to drive the ball hard to the basket and that is going to be hard, according to Iceman. When you watch us play defense, we're out in the passing lanes, put a lot of pressure on the ball trying to turn you over that way. They kind of pack it in a little bit, they're not going to be out in there denying passing lanes, it's going to be easy to move the ball around the perimeter side to side, but then it's tough to go north and south towards the basket, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, So, shooting the ball from the outside is something you have got to have against them. Then they rely on that size on the back end to protect the basket. If they keep you in front and you take tough shots they're in good positions for a rebound. They've got two big kids to rebound the ball as well. So, they dont do a ton of pressure or anything like that and they don't force a ton of turnovers, they're just going to make you take tough shots and then rebound and end the possession that way.\n\nPublished 3/03/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nThere will be a special Out of Bounds\n\nSaturday from 10 to 11 PM\n\nFirst Source for All Things Sports\n\nLucas Knows the Assignment\n\nLucas faces Monroeville in a division IV district semifinal on Tuesday night at Willard High School.\n\nFor the Cubs (20-4) they are coming off winning a sectional title in easy fashion over New London (59-26) on Friday night. Meanwhile, the Eagles beat Seneca East (64-56) to win their second straight sectional title. They lost to Margaretta, now in division III, in a district semi last year.\n\nLucas coach Taylor Iceman says Monroeville has two excellent players in Aidan Goodwin and Jimmy Clingman. It was nice last week getting to see them play twice with us playing on Tuesday and then they played Wednesday and then Friday night after our game. So, it was good to be able to see them live twice. Obviously, you can get about any game film or you can find games on live streams pretty easily now, so I mean we've seen a lot of their games, but it was just nice to see them in person last week. They've got two really good players that do a lot of their scoring and we know who they are and we know who we have got to stop, he told Swankonsports.com on Monday night, They do have a little bit of size as well. That was the big difference between them and Seneca East. I thought Seneca East just wasn't as big. Monroeville was going to be a little bit bigger. When you talk about them offensively they have got two guys that do the majority of their scoring. So, we have to know where Clingman and Goodwin are at. Its going to be a tough game. They've played a good schedule this year, won some big games, lost some close ones to good teams as well, so they're going to be a good team.\n\nBoth teams have played physical basketball this year and having been in the district tournament five years in a row, Iceman says they know to expect it is going to a physical game. We've been fortunate to play in a handful of districts here in the last few years and our kids have been exposed to that, but that's how those games are usually officiated, which is good. We're a physical team, we're used to playing that way. The couple games we got to see them play their big and physical as well. So, I expect it to be a physical game. That's what you expect at this level. There are no bad teams left at this point. They're here for a reason, they're solid, said Iceman.\n\nIceman says they to come out and do what they do in order to be successful. We're going to have to come out and play well.

We say to ourselves, well we can't overlook them we have got to come out and play, so we look at it from that standpoint. Then heck we were saying before if we were the six or seven seed and we had to play somebody pretty solid, we say man we wish we were playing the 13 and 14 seeds. So, this is kind of how you look at it, but we always talk about we want to go out and win, but feel good about it after the game regardless of who we're playing, said Iceman.\n\nIn the win over St. Peters, Iceman say they accomplished their secondary goal. We were able to beat St. Pete's pretty handily the other night, but we did some good things and we were able to feel good about that one after the fact. We've won some games this year and not played very well and not felt real good about it. So, it's always just about going out playing, winning, and then feeling good about it, he said.\n\nNew London (2-20) finished in the basement of the Firelands Conference this season and the Wildcats are coming off a (76-31) thrashing at the hands of South Central in a conference game last Friday.\n\nIceman says they will be at size disadvantage, but again they want to play their game. They have got a little bit of size. We didn't play him this year, but we've played him in years past, so we're familiar with some of those kids, they've been around for a couple years. They do have some size, which we're not very big, so we've been preparing for that, he told Swankonsports.com on Thursday night, We expect to probably see some zone like we we've seen from a lot of teams this year. So, we've kind of been preparing for that kind of stuff. St. Petes did that the other night, so it's been nice from that standpoint it isn't like we have to change things up a whole lot from Tuesday to Friday. Again, it's just about us going out and playing our game and if we play well, I don't know that it matters who we play I think we have a pretty good shot at winning. So, we just try and focus on ourselves and go out and play well.\n\nPublished 2/24/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nThere will be a special Out of Bounds\n\nSaturday from 10 to 11 PM\n\nFirst Source for All Things Sports\n\nLucas With Test Versus Clear Fork\n\nLucas, the Mid-Buckeye Conference champion, wraps up the regular season on Tuesday night with a non-conference game at Clear Fork against the Colts.\n\nLast week, they won two non-conference games with a win at home over Mt. Gilead (63-48) on Friday and at Plymouth (40-30) on Saturday.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says Friday night they got off to a slow start and Saturday they looked like they were tired. Friday night with senior night for us, so a little bit different. We started five different starters, five seniors and it that can kind of affect you a little bit and then we made our steps back, got our regular guys in and we played pretty well and made a good run to give us a little bit of a lead and then we just kind of coasted the rest of the night. It was up and down at times, but like I said we were able to get a win we got everybody in. We took care of business on senior night and that's kind of what you got to do there, he told Swankonsports.com on Monday night, Then Saturday night went over to Plymouth and we just struggled, didnt shoot the ball well, missed some layups, missed some free throws, just kind of tired and I don't know. It was Saturday night, second game of the weekend and it was just kind of ugly, so we'll leave it at that. We were happy to get the win and just get out of there at that point.\n\nLucas (17-4), #4 in the Swankonsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in the small school division, is at Clear Fork (6-14) on Tuesday night. The Colts lost to Mid-Ohio Athletic Conference leader Shelby (76-63) on Friday night.\n\nIceman says the Colts have been getting better as the season has unfolded. They're a little deceiving. They don't have a great record right now, but they are playing better. It's a rivalry, we're pretty close in proximity, they're the bigger school. They're playing pretty good right now. So, they definitely want to beat us. We played them in football and it was a really good game and they were able to beat us there, so we know we're going to get their best shot. It'll be their senior night as well, so again nobody wants to lose on senior night in their final home game. We're going to have to play well, but again that's what we want going into the tournament here. We want to play good teams and push ourselves. So, we have to show up and play well to get a win and close out the season on a high note and get ready for the tournament, said Iceman.\n\nLucas is preparing for what should a physical division IV tournament and Iceman says Clear Fork will help them do that. They have got a couple bigger kids that'll be good for us. We anticipate or hope to get another shot at Colonel Crawford and we kind of struggled with their size a little bit. The Maddy kid hurt us, so it's going to be good for us to kind of have to play a bigger team and work on some things. We just don't always get to see that with our schedule, so that's going to be a good thing for us. Again, they're going to be a hungry team. They don't want to lose us. Nobody around here wants to lose to Lucas, especially the bigger schools. This is always a good game, it seems like always a big crowd, it's two communities that are pretty close in proximity and it should be a good game and hopefully our guys are up for it and we can go over and pick up a good win to close out the season, he said.\n\nPublished 2/14/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds after Friday night games 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday each week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nWe are Your First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Faces Mt. Gilead\n\nLucas, the Mid-Buckeye Conference champion, plays at home against Mt. Gilead in a non-conference game on Friday night.\n\nThe Cubs (15-4,10-0), #4 in the Swankonsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in the small school division, smoked Mansfield Christian (80-56) last Friday to earn the outright title. We played petty well that night. We accomplished what we wanted and went 10-0 in our league. It was a pretty good night. We got everybody in the game and we played pretty well and came out and accomplished what we wanted. I wish we could have played a little better over at Willard the next night because they're pretty good team and we almost beat them, but we kind of shot ourselves in the foot early in that one, he said.\n\nWillard beat Lucas (60-57) last Saturday night in a non-league game.\n\nIceman says they didnt play well early in that game and it cost them. We came out slow and just kind of not like us. I don't know if there was a little bit of hangover from the night before, but Willard is a really solid team. They have got two really good players. We proved it to ourselves again you can't just show up and go through the motions, he told Swankonsports.com on Wednesday night, That was a great test for us. That's what we need to play games like that that's what we're going to see ultimately in the tournament. You have got to learn how to win big games like that. It was another one against a good team and down the stretch we couldn't find a way, so it was good for us. It's always good to go over there late in the season and play at Willard where the district tournaments is held. We took some positives away from it and again it's good to win and do all those things, but it's also good to be brought back to earth every once in a while.\n\nMt. Gilead (10-9) will be at Lucas on Friday night and Iceman says the Indians will offer a challenge. We played them last year for the first time in a few years. We went down there and it was a pretty good game we were able to beat them. They've got a really good point guard in the (Matt) Bland kid. He can score and do a lot for them. He plays really hard and then they got they got a few other guys as well that that are pretty tough. Again, if we don't show up and play we'll have a shot at losing one. It's senior night for us so we're excited about that. We're going to start some different guys and like I said that'll be a different dynamic so again it's just a different setting, different atmosphere for the kids. Ultimately you have got to go out and take care of business. They're not a bad team and we're going to have to show up and play to be able to get another win, said Iceman.\n\nPublished 2/09/23\n\n© Swankonsports.com\n\nOut of Bounds after Friday night games 10 to midnight\n\nSports Saturday each week 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nWe are Your First Source for Everything Sports\n\nLucas Wants it All\n\nLucas can take the Mid-Buckeye Conference title to themselves on Friday night by beating Mansfield Christian at the Cub Cave.\n\nThey lead the Flames (12-4,7-1) by a game, so a Mansfield Christian win creates a tie for first. The Flames still have a conference game with Kidron Central Christian next week.\n\nCoach Taylor Iceman says they really arent in a sharing mood. We've talked about that all week. We've come this far and we've had a pretty good year and you just have to go out and finish it off. It'd be different if we were playing a team that wasn't very good, but we have got to play the second place team right now. They're pretty good. They gave us some trouble over their place the first time around, so it's not just show up and we'll get through it and it'll be over with and we'll have the undefeated conference championship. We're going to have to play. They've got a really good player and like I said last game over there we did not play well and we had to come back and win that one late, he said.\n\nAmarr Davis is the Flames best player and one of the better players in North Central Ohio.\n\nIceman says they cant allow Davis to get to the basket. He's just such a good athlete, hes a lot to deal with. He just gets to the rim and even when he shoots and misses sometimes he's just such a good athlete at going and getting it and then putting it back up and in. So, he's got to always know where he is. We're fortunate that we have some pretty good defenders that will do a good job, but it's going to take more than one to stop him. We've got to play good defense and have got to have good help side behind whoever's guarding him and you have to finish it off by boxing him out. Sometimes him just firing one up there and then him going and getting it is good offense for them. So, it's just a matter of keeping him in front of you and then boxing him out and trying to keep him away from the basket. The further away you can keep from the basket the better your chances are going to be. So, that's kind of our game plan that we've had with him and in his years over there and he he's still a junior, so we have got to deal with him again next year, said Iceman.\n\nLucas (14-3,9-0), #4 in the Swanknsports.com boys basketball coaches poll in the small school division, beat Mansfield Christian (71-66) on January 17, but Iceman did not feel they played very well in that game.\n\nIceman says they need to make more perimeter shots, but they need to get to the basket too. For whatever reason over there at Mansfield Christian, it's a really small gym, we don't ever shoot the ball very well in that gym. It's just a different setting. It's small and spacing is tough. We're athletic and we like to space the floor and beat our man off the dribble and go score and in that gym over there it just makes it that much harder because you can kind of pack it in and it just makes it harder to get to the rim. Our gym is not huge, but we do have some more spacing. They're going to, I would"
