        "text": "Brock Ungricht was officially announced as the fourth head coach in San Diego baseball history on July 3, 2021, as Associate Vice President and Executive Director of Athletics Bill McGillis retained a dynamic leader and the architect of one of the West Coast's top college baseball offenses in Alcala Park to lead the Toreros. He will enter his third season as USD’s head coach in 2024.\n\n\"Brock Ungricht is a positive, inspirational leader and gifted communicator who players believe in and want to play for,” said McGillis. “He has made immense contributions to our program since joining our staff, and he embraces our vision of Winning in the Classroom, Winning on the Playing Field and Winning in the Community. I believe Coach Ungricht's diverse experiences gained as a player, college coach and professional scout, when combined with his outstanding people skills, expertise and ability to teach the game, will result in great success for Torero baseball.”\n\nUngricht was elevated to head coach after spending the previous three seasons (2019-2021) as USD’s assistant coach (hitting) and recruiting coordinator, helping the Toreros to a West Coast Conference-best 77-37 (.675) record in that span.\n\nA San Diego native, Ungricht was a Southern California Area Scout for the Saint Louis Cardinals organization in 2017 and 2018. Prior to that, he spent six seasons at Stanford University; the final two as a full-time assistant coach under longtime Cardinal skipper Mark Marquess.\n\nYEAR TWO (2023)\n\nUngricht steered the Toreros to a 17-10 West Coast Conference record (24-25-1 overall) in 2023, securing his team a tied-for-second place finish in the league standings and a WCC Tournament appearance in back-to-back seasons. The 2022 and 2023 campaigns under Ungricht marked the first time in program history that the Toreros had qualified for the WCC Tournament in consecutive years. After a challenging non-conference slate that saw San Diego travel to eventual 2023 NCAA Super Regional host Oregon and take a game from eventual 2023 College World Series participant TCU, Ungricht’s squad won four consecutive WCC series to finish its 2023 regular season schedule and prevailed in 10 of its last 13 regular-season conference contests despite losing several key players to injuries down the stretch. On April 6, 2023, Ungricht earned his 50th win as head coach with a nationally-televised 8-1 decision at Gonzaga, making him the fastest coach in San Diego baseball history to reach that milestone.\n\nUnder his guidance in 2023, USD led the WCC with a .975 fielding percentage, a mark that ranked 36th nationally, and also paced the league in walks (232), hit by pitches (80), and triples (13).\n\nSan Diego ranked second in the WCC that year in runs scored (345), home runs (55), RBIs (322), and stolen bases (68) while ranking third in on-base percentage (.381).\n\nHeadlined by All-WCC First/Academic Team selection Angelo Peraza, the Toreros took home 11 all-conference honors in 2023, including four total academic recognitions. On February 27, utility player Jack Costello was named the NCAA National Player of the Week.\n\nA RETURN TO GREATNESS IN YEAR ONE (2022)\n\nUngricht’s first year as head coach saw San Diego return to heights not seen in Alcala Park in nearly a decade. The Toreros went 37-20 (17-10 WCC) with him at the helm, placing tied for second in the West Coast Conference’s regular-season standings before completing a rousing run through the WCC Tournament bracket at Banner Island Ballpark to take home the team’s second-ever WCC Tournament Championship. San Diego began the stirring run with a comeback win over San Francisco, then demolished two-seed Portland by a 22-8 margin to set the stage for a rematch with rival Gonzaga. The conference showdown saw the Toreros win both games against the top-seeded Zags in decisive fashion, first beating them 5-3 before completing a thrilling extra-innings comeback for a 15-12 win in the championship game.\n\nThe victory advanced USD to the NCAA Corvallis Regional, where Ungricht’s squad opened the event with a signature win over perennial powerhouse Vanderbilt, beating the Commodores 3-2 before a packed crowd at Goss Stadium and a national audience watching at home on ESPNU.\n\nWhen the dust settled, the strides made under Ungricht were more than clear. In his first year as head coach, the Toreros achieved:\n\nUSD’s most wins since 2013 (37)\n\nUSD’s first WCC Tournament Championship since 2013\n\nUSD’s first NCAA Regional Appearance since 2013\n\nUSD’s first NCAA Regional win since 2013\n\nUnder Ungricht’s guidance in 2022, San Diego baseball paced the West Coast Conference in nearly every offensive category, leading the league in runs scored (390), hits (565), home runs (57), runs batted in (359), batting average (.286), on-base percentage (.384), and slugging percentage (.437) while striking out the second-least (375 times) of the WCC’s 10 teams.\n\nThis excellence at the plate was paired with elite defense — San Diego’s .980 fielding percentage in 2022 led the WCC and ranked 15th nationally.\n\nUngricht’s mentorship also helped a Torero win the WCC Player of the Year award for the second consecutive season, with junior catcher Caleb Ricketts earning the league’s top honor after fellow Ungricht mentee Thomas Luevano did so in 2021. With Ungricht’s coaching, Ricketts’ 2022 campaign proved to be among the most accomplished in San Diego baseball history as he led the WCC in hits (85), home runs (16), batting average (.373), and slugging percentage (.658) and was named a Collegiate Baseball Third-Team All-American, a semifinalist for the Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year Award, an All-WCC First Team Selection, the 2022 WCC Tournament Most Outstanding Player, and a member of the 2022 Corvallis Regional All-Tournament Team in addition to a WCC Player of the Week Award and a selection to the ABCA West All-Region Second Team.\n\nHis big year complemented All-WCC selections for seven other Toreros, including three to the First Team (Brycen Mautz, Chase Meidroth, and Kevin Sim), one to the Second Team (Ian Churchill), two Honorable Mentions (Ryan Robinson and RJ Teijeiro), and one to the All-Freshman Team (Ryan Kysar).\n\nAT USD PRIOR TO TAKING OVER AS HEAD COACH (2019-2021)\n\n2021, Ungricht’s final year as USD’s hitting coach and recruiting coordinator before being promoted to head coach, saw USD again compile the most productive offense in the WCC, leading the conference in batting average (.299), runs batted in (300), on-base percentage (.383), and runs scored (329) while striking out the least of the league's ten teams and finishing second in total hits, doubles, and slugging percentage.\n\nSan Diego finished with a 33-12 (19-8 WCC) record, placing USD second in the West Coast Conference as it finished the season just a game behind first-place Gonzaga. Despite not earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, San Diego had the best record of any team not in the postseason, and put together a better record than 56 of 64 teams in the field.\n\nUnder Ungricht’s guidance in 2021, Torero hitters captured a WCC Player of the Year award (Thomas Luevano), an All-WCC First Team honor (Luevano), an All-WCC Second Team honor (Cody Jefferis), an All-WCC Freshman Team honor (Jack Costello), three All-WCC Honorable Mentions (Costello, Adam Lopez, Shane McGuire, and Tora Otsuka), a Third Team All-American (Luevano), a Freshman All-American (Costello), and an ABCA/Rawlings West All-Region Second Team honor (Luevano).\n\nThe 2020 season looked promising for USD, but was cut short on Mar. 12 due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. San Diego finished 12-4 with a top-25 RPI ranking and ranked second in the WCC in on-base percentage (.370) and fourth in team average (.278). Shane McGuire ranked 2nd in the WCC and 7th nationally with a .469 batting average, while Thomas Luevano (.356) also ranked top-10 in the conference.\n\nIn 2019, Ungricht coached the Toreros to a first-place WCC ranking and top-60 national ranking in both team average (.286) and on-base percentage (.382). Ripken Reyes (1st, .366) and Jeff Houghtby (2nd, .341) finished with the top two batting averages in the conference.\n\nA PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF DEVELOPING TALENT\n\nJunior utility player Kevin Sim's selection in the fifth round of the 2023 MLB Draft (148th overall pick) by the Arizona Diamondbacks marked the ninth USD player Ungricht has coached to be drafted and the 28th overall player he has mentored to be selected to play at the next level after guiding 19 MLB Draftees at Stanford.\n\nSan Diego’s four MLB Draft picks in 2022, which also included left-handed pitcher Brycen Mautz (St. Louis Cardinals, second round, 59th overall pick), infielder Chase Meidroth (Boston Red Sox, fourth round, 129th overall pick), and catcher Caleb Ricketts (Philadelphia Phillies, seventh round, 212th overall pick), were the most Toreros to be taken in the first two rounds of the draft since 2010. Mautz’s selection was the highest by a USD player since 2015.\n\nIn his time with the Cardinal, Ungricht coached two first-round draft picks (Stephen Piscotty and Alex Blandino), two All-Americans, two freshmen All-Americans, eight All-Pac-12 honorees and a Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. The 2011, 2012 and 2014 Stanford teams each reached the Super Regionals, as Ungricht worked with the team's hitters and catchers.\n\nLOCAL TIES\n\nIn 2009, Ungricht began his coaching career up the street from USD at San Diego's Kearny High, leading the Komets to their first league title in 28 years. He spent three seasons as a student-athlete at San Diego State, batting .373 as a freshman All-American with 48 RBI over 63 games. The corner infielder and catcher finished his Aztec career with a batting average of .318 with 44 doubles and 117 RBI, leaving among the all-time leaders in hits, RBI and total bases.\n\nUngricht was picked in the 30th round of the 2006 draft by the New York Yankees, spending a season playing for the Gulf Coast League Yankees before playing for Chico of the Golden Baseball League in 2007. A three-time All-CIF selection as a prep, Ungricht was inducted into the Mission Bay High School (San Diego) Hall of Fame in 2008. Ungricht's father, Dan Ungricht, was inducted into the San Diego High School Coaches Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nHe resides in San Diego with his wife (Taylor), daughter (Ava), and son (Ben)."
