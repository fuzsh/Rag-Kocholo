        "text": "MONACA – In the annals of the National Basketball Association, there are regions in America that have been considered basketball hotbeds.\n\nNamely, there is New York City’s Holcombe Rucker Playground, the many asphalt courts of Sonny Hill’s Philadelphia summer league, the Connie Hawkins League in Pittsburgh, the roundball gatherings of Maryland’s PG County, Baltimore’s Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School courts, south side Chicago hardcourts and even today, the Drew Summer League of Los Angeles. The game has even reached the far corners of international waters.\n\nIt’s a strong bet, the city swimming pool courts of Monaca, Pa., would not be considered a round-ball hotbed ― notable for producing three NBA products.\n\nMaybe not, but that does not discount the fact that a trio of Monaca High School products, and family members, found their way to the greatest basketball league in the world.\n\nNotably, William Charles “Billy” Zopf Sr., Edward “Mickey” Davis Jr. and Bradley Ernest Davis, credit their developmental foundational years as having occurred at the hoop courts on Washington Avenue ― near what was then known as Monaca’s City Swimming Pool.\n\nAll three men agree it was the Washington Avenue asphalt hoop courts that provided common grounds in helping them initiate and ultimately complete their road to basketball success, which ended at the pinnacle, with NBA franchises.\n\nHoliday fun:Christmas bars pop up in White Township, Monaca, New Brighton & Zelienople\n\nZopf, 74, and the eldest of the threesome, graduated from Monaca High in 1966. He, too, has nothing but fond memories of the downtown hoop court next to the now-defunct swimming pool.\n\n\"It's a different time now. Then, we played all the time ― we had the court in Monaca, and on a summer night, they came from all over ― New Brighton, Rochester, Aliquippa, Midland. We had a real nice court down by the swimming pool and if you lost, you might not get back on the court for hours.\n\n“It’s where you learned how to play ― none of this organized stuff like today ― we officiated ourselves and we played on concrete ― with hoops that had a pole. We played from 6p to 9p, with no lights. We played Sunday through Thursday ― Friday and Saturdays were our hangout nights,” said Zopf with a smile.\n\n“When I was in high school, there were probably 20 kids from our part of western Pa. that went on to Division I schools ― we were a hotbed at that time ― the difference between then and now, you’ve got all the school mergers. And we all played more than one sport. I played baseball, too, and loved the game. I now live in the Pine-Richland (Pa.) school district area. Here, they definitely want you to focus in on one sport and it should be the sport that’ll take you the furthest,” said Zopf, who like the Davis’ grew up on the hill in Monaca Heights.\n\nAs a 6-2 point guard in high school, Zopf enjoyed a stellar high school career, which attracted notice from several Division 1 colleges. According to the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame, Zopf led the 1965-66 Monaca Indians to a 21-1 record, earning a Section 8 title. They were ousted by a strong McKeesport team in a WPIAL playoff thriller. Zopf continued his college career after choosing the downtown Pittsburgh institution, Duquesne University, where he played for three years.\n\nWhy Duquesne? \"Back then, they had a great basketball tradition. The Ricketts brothers, Willie Somerset ― so they had a great hoop tradition. And my folks wanted to see me play and Durham, N.C., was a bit far away, so I made my choice to stay local,” Zopf recalled\n\n“It was either Duke or the Dukes,” he added.\n\nAfter enjoying a fruitful college career at Duquesne, Zopf was drafted in the second round of the 1970 NBA Draft. The southpaw was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks. There he had a chance to play alongside NBA greats Kareem Abdul Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor) and the veteran Oscar “Big O” Robertson, the Indianapolis (Crispus Attucks High School) native whose Pittsburgh connections ran deep with a University of Cincinnati roommate from nearby Braddock.\n\nZopf said he left college early to help mitigate personal family financial issues.\n\nFortunately, he was able to earn an NBA title with the 1971 Bucks squad. Zopf said he was unable to complete his first and only NBA season because he was drafted into the U.S. Army’s Selective Services unit ― disqualifying him from participating in the playoffs that spring. However, the team still provided him with a championship ring ― honoring his regular season-long contributions.\n\nFollowing his cousin’s lead, Mickey Davis, like Zopf, chose Duquesne University after a scintillating high school career. According to the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame, Mickey Davis was a three-year, dominating center at Monaca High School, where he stood 6-7 and weighed a solid 205 pounds.\n\nAfter earning his way to the prestigious 1972 Pittsburgh Dapper Dan Roundball Classic at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, Davis joined Duquesne’s hoop program, where he led the Dukes in scoring both his sophomore and junior seasons.\n\nDavis chose to forego his senior season and signed with the fledgling American Basketball Association’s (ABA) Pittsburgh Condors. He was eventually picked up in the 7th Round by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1972 NBA Draft. Davis, now 72, spent five years with the Bucks, then got married and had a family after his hoop career ended. He enjoyed a long and successful career as a regional sales manager for the Miller Brewing Co. in Milwaukee before retiring.\n\nUpon recalling NBA salaries of that era compared with today's million-dollar contracts, Davis noted his one-year rookie deal was good for $18,500. He recalls his father joking that he'd pay him $5,000 more to return home and work at Jones & Laughlin Steel’s (J&L) Aliquippa Works. His father, the late Ed Davis Sr., worked in J&L production management.\n\nLocal business:Biz in the Valley: Millions awarded to kickstart development, Shell cracker plant ramps up & more\n\n\"Back then Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) was making about $256,000 annually and Oscar (Robertson) was at about $134,000. Bobby Dandridge made 80 grand,\" Mickey Davis vividly recalls.\n\n\"It was a different time. The dollars just weren't there as they are now,\" he said.\n\nMickey’s younger brother, Brad Davis, enjoyed the longest NBA stint of the Monaca trio. He was initially drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1977 after a highly successful three-year college career with the University of Maryland. Brad Davis also played for the Utah Jazz and the Indiana Pacers before eventually completing a 15-year NBA career with the Dallas Mavericks in 1992.\n\nAccording to the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame, at Monaca High, Brad Davis was first-team Pa. All-State and averaged 27 points and 14 rebounds his senior season. His floor leadership, defensive tenacity and complete offensive skills, propelled him onto MVP honors in the 1974 Roundball Classic in a tightly contested nod over General Braddock High legend Hosea Champagne.\n\nDavis, now 66, is currently a play-by-play TV/radio analyst for the Mavericks. His jersey has been retired by the Mavs. He noted that he and Mav’s owner Mark Cuban, another Pittsburgh native, often talk shop about Steelers’ and Pirates’ 1970s glory days. Monaca is about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.\n\nBrad Davis also fondly recalls playing those local games at the swimming pool courts that included some of the top talents in Beaver County.\n\n“We’d get the best players from the area; Albert Davis, Ron “Po” James, the Coleman brothers (Stan and Lee) from New Brighton; the Midland players like George Green and the Slappy brothers; the Lassiters (Cicero and Jimmy) from Freedom. Our court was definitely the place to be on a summer’s evening,” said Davis who enjoyed star status with the Terrapins, before going pro. There, at College Park, Md., he mixed it up with teammates like John Lucas, Tom McMillen Mo Howard and head coach Charles “Lefty” Driesell.\n\nJohnny Slappy Jr., 62, of Beaver Falls, is a 1979 Midland High graduate and recalls visiting the Monaca courts with his uncles, the late Larry “Dub” Slappy and Donnie “Bee” Slappy.\n\nLocal stars honored:Four former Beaver Valley basketball stars to be honored at Pgh. hall of fame ceremony\n\n“No doubt, the competition was tremendous and you never wanted to lose, or you’d lose your spot for upcoming games,” said Johnny Slappy, who played on Midland’s 1979 WPIAL Class 2A boys basketball title squad with Roosevelt “Boo” Kirby.\n\n“I also played against the Davis’ youngest brother, Scott Davis, who went on to play at Wake Forest University,” said Slappy, who finished his career at Point Park University. Scott Davis is currently a banker in Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nZopf recalls Mickey Davis as a sophomore during his senior year of high school. “He really improved over the summer.” He also reflected on his younger brother and point guard, Jeff Zopf, another talented local kid who graduated from Monaca in 1973 and played at the University of Toledo and Indiana University of Pa.\n\nThe younger Zopf died at age 47, of a rare Melanoma skin cancer, said his older brother.\n\nEvery July, Brad Davis holds an annual golf tourney near Ellwood City in honor of Jeff Zopf and a Monaca football player named Bobby Philips. Both men died young, in their prime, said Billy Zopf. Scholarships are named in honor of both men at the Fox Run Golf Course.\n\nZopf said his college exploits at Duquesne from 1967-70, were full of excitement and they played several of the top-name players of the NCAA Division 1 era.\n\n“We lost to North Carolina’s Tarheels and Charlie Scott ― we were ranked No. 6 in the country my junior year. We beat St. Bonaventure and Bob Lanier ― in fact, we beat them twice. We beat St. Johns twice that year and beat LaSalle with Kenny Durrett (the Pittsburgh Schenley High School legend). We lost to Detroit and Spencer Haywood; beat Western Kentucky and Jim McDaniel at the Civic Arena; beat St. Francis and (Midland/Chicago Bulls legend) Norm Van Lier ― twice,” he said.\n\nFour years after his cousin Billy Zopf graduated from high school, Mickey Davis became the shining star of Monaca’s Class of 1970 hoop squad. And he fondly recalls his developmental days of growing up in the heart of Beaver County.\n\n“Growing up in Beaver County, especially Monaca, was an ideal place to be raised,” he said. “It was ideal; easy access to other towns; and the school systems were great. It was a great place to grow up and a great place to be raised. We all had strong blue-collar ethics and played with a lot of the kids. The respect all the kids learned, it was from that type of environment ― coal and steel ― it was a tough environment, but we learned. And we played all types of sports ― I absolutely loved baseball.”\n\nRetired New Pittsburgh Courier Sports Editor, Eddie Jefferies said the race factor is relevant with these Monaca players. \"Three white guys from the same high school talented enough to make the NBA, that's definitely significant. And they're cousins!\" added Jefferies.\n\nTraditionally, since the 1970s, the NBA has statistically been dominated by a 70 percent rate of African-American players, according to NBA Statisca.com. Zopf said the league was about 70 percent black during his era, prior to the current influx of African and European players, including the Mav’s Slovenian superstar, Luka Doncic.\n\nLike Jefferies, John Giammarco, owner/founder of the Pittsburgh Basketball Club, is likewise impressed with the Monaca cousins.\n\n\"Beaver County basketball, as a whole, was so strong during this era. The fact that three future professionals would arise from this one small school, speaks volumes of the programs occurring at Monaca during those times. So many generational reputations were made in WPIAL and PIAA playoff competition, but back then, so many great teams did not even make the playoffs because you had to win your section in order to qualify for tournament action back then,\" he added.\n\n\"Billy Zopf, Mickey Davis and Brad Davis were truly three of the best players to come not only from Western Pa., but from the entire state of Pennsylvania. And all three played pickup hoops on the same outdoor courts? Wow!\"\n\nAs one of Monaca's more popular men of God, Kevin Draganac also vividly recalls visiting his grandparents’ house on Washington Avenue, across the street from the City Courts at the swimming pool.\n\n“In those days, there was hardly anywhere to park ― and the entire park was bustling with young kids and especially the many guys who gravitated to the two basketball courts,” said Pastor Draganac.\n\n“Obviously, it played an important role in developing positive young men,” he said. Like the Davis brothers and Zopf, he, too, played sports and swam at the park near his grandparents’ house. These days, Draganac, 57, works as a regional manager of a UPMC Cancer Center in addition to leading the non-denominational The Road to Emmaus Church in Monaca, founded by his father, the Rev. James Paul Draganac, 43 years ago.\n\nAlthough Monaca High School no longer exists, following a 2009 merger with Center High School to become Central Valley High School, Draganac said he’s also helped mentor two current NFL athletes formerly of Central Valley High ― Robert Foster (New York Giants) and Jordan Whitehead (New York Jets).\n\nWhitehead giving back:'They mean so much to me': Jordan Whitehead inspires local kids with youth football camp\n\n“We’re so very proud of the accomplishments of all of our Monaca men. They have truly shed a positive light on our small city,” Draganac said.\n\nEditor’s notes: Billy Zopf, a North Hills Pittsburgh resident, has been married for 40 years to Patty Gillooly Zopf.
