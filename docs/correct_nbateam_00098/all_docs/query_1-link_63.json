        "text": "(WSCR)In this shortened NBA season, the Bulls have dealt with a variety of injuries.\n\nDerrick Rose, Rip Hamilton, Luol Deng and C.J. Watson have all missed time due to injuries, but still, the team owns the best record in the NBA.\n\n\"We think (our depth) is one of the strengths of our club,\" Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau told The McNeil and Spiegel Show. \"We like the make up of our guys. We think we have great character. Everyone has been ready. We've had a number of bench players who have stepped up and become starters and have handled that extremely well. The guys who were at the end of the bench, like John (Lucas III) and Jimmy Butler and (Brian Scalabrine,) they've been thrown into the rotation. Whenever that has happened, they've handled that extremely well.\"\n\nLISTEN: Tom Thibodeau on The Mully and Hanley Show\n\nFor the rest of this interview and other 670 The Score interviews click here.\n\nIn last night's Bulls-Heat game, after news broke that Rose wouldn't play with a strained groin muscle, the team had an unlikely hero, as Lucas scored 24 points to help Chicago take down Miami.\n\n\"That's the NBA by nature,\" Thibodeau said. \"There is constant change. I think being ready for those changes is critical. When you go into a game, you don't know, in many cases, who is going to be playing, both your own team and your opponent. You have to have your plans in place, and when someone else is out for your own team, you have to know who the next guy is. That next guy has to be ready and has to step up.\""
