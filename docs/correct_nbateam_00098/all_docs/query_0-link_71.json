        "text": "The Chicago Bulls have a decision to make on C.J. Watson's $3.4 million option as they look to bridge the gap during Derrick Rose's recovery from surgery to repair his ACL, but they could also turn to the free agent market this summer. HoopsHype has released 2012 NBA Free Agent Rankings at the point guard position, and some potential veteran targets found their way into the middle of the pack behind stars like Deron Williams (No. 1) and Steve Nash (No. 2).\n\nFormer Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich may be a nice fit for the team, and he comes in at No. 16 on the list. Hinrich probably he won't command anything close to the $5.48 million he banked last season, but his NBA experience and familiarity with the organization could be an asset early next year. John Lucas III drops in at No. 22, behind guys like Keyon Dooling (No. 19) and Gilbert Arenas (No. 20).\n\nHere are the top-16 available free agent point guards, according to HoopsHype:\n\nDeron Williams (UFA)\n\nSteve Nash (UFA)\n\nLouis Williams (UFA)\n\nJeremy Lin (RFA)\n\nGoran Dragic (UFA)\n\nJason Kidd (UFA)\n\nChauncey Billups (UFA)\n\nGeorge Hill (UFA)\n\nAaron Brooks (RFA)\n\nRamon Sessions (UFA)\n\nAndre Miller (UFA)\n\nJameer Nelson (Player Option)\n\nD.J. Augustin (RFA)\n\nRaymond Felton (UFA)\n\nNate Robinson (UFA)\n\nKirk Hinrich (UFA)"
