        "text": "Bill Walton (born November 5, 1952, La Mesa, California, U.S.—died May 27, 2024, San Diego) was an American collegiate and professional basketball player who is considered one of the best all-around players in the sport’s history.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Walton embarked on an outstanding collegiate career at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), leading his team to a pair of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championships under legendary coach John Wooden in 1972 and 1973. Walton was selected as the Most Outstanding Player of both tournaments and established an NCAA tournament career record for field goal percentage at 68.6 percent (109 of 159 field goals) from 1972 to 1974. He also set the single-tournament mark by shooting 76.3 percent (45 of 59) in 1973. Arguably the most impressive feat of his collegiate career was the key role he played in UCLA’s NCAA-record 88-game winning streak, as he led the team to the final 73 victories of that run during his first two and a half years at the school. Walton was named the NCAA player of the year in three consecutive seasons (1972–74).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers selected Walton with the first pick in the first round of the 1974 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft. After steadily improving his game, he led the Trail Blazers in 1977 to their first NBA championship. He fully realized his potential during that season, averaging nearly 19 points, 14.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 3.2 blocks per game. Walton led the league in blocked shots and rebounding, was named to the NBA all-defensive team, and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the 1977 play-offs.\n\nWalton continued to display his dominance during the 1977–78 campaign, ultimately winning the NBA’s MVP award after tallying 18.9 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.2 blocks per game that season. In addition to making the All-NBA first team and the All-NBA defensive team, Walton was honored as the play-off MVP for the second consecutive year even though the Trail Blazers failed to repeat as champions.\n\nThroughout his career, nagging injuries continually slowed Walton. In 1978, following the two most impressive seasons of his young career, he suffered the first of several serious injuries; he developed chronic foot and knee problems that forced him to sit out the entire season. Portland, concerned that Walton was injury-prone, traded him to the San Diego Clippers after the 1978–79 season. After appearing in just 14 games in his first year with San Diego, Walton sat out the entire 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons because of more foot problems. He spent three more quiet seasons in San Diego before being traded to the Boston Celtics in 1985. Staying relatively healthy, Walton became an integral component of an already talented Celtics team and, in a reserve role, helped Boston win the NBA title in 1986. His efforts were rewarded with the NBA’s Sixth Man Award for the 1985–86 season.\n\nHaving played just 468 games over 10 seasons, Walton retired after the 1986–87 campaign. A famous free spirit, he was known for his social activism, outspoken opinions, and devotion to the Grateful Dead rock band. Viewed by many as the best-passing big man of all time, Walton was honored as one of the NBA’s 50 all-time greatest players in 1996.\n\nFollowing his retirement, he became an outspoken analyst on NBA television broadcasts. In 2009, however, after undergoing surgery because of chronic back problems, he briefly stepped away from his second profession. However, he returned to broadcasting the following year, and he continued calling games until 2024.\n\nWalton wrote the memoir Back from the Dead (2016). He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993."
