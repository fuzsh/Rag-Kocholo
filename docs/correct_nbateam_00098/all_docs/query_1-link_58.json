        "text": "When Tom Thibodeau took the Timberwolves job in the summer of 2016, the jokes and speculation immediately started that he would try to get the whole Bulls band back together to prove that he could make it work.\n\nJimmy, Derrick, Taj, Noah, Luol, maybe even role players like John Lucas, E’Twaun Moore or C.J. Watson. Every time a former Bull hit the market, it seemed like they were rumored to have interest from Thibodeau and the Wolves.\n\nAs Thibodeau’s second regular season in control of the basketball operations heads down the home stretch, the TimberBulls are becoming a reality.\n\nHe traded for Butler and signed Gibson and Aaron Brooks this summer. He brought in John Lucas III first as a player last year and then an assistant coach this season. And now Derrick Rose is here as well.\n\nThe Wolves signed Rose on Thursday — a move first reported by ESPN — to try to bolster the team’s firepower with Butler sidelined by a torn right meniscus. It gives the Wolves a logjam at point guard, but does bring in yet another player steeped in the Thibs system as they try to stay in the playoff field in the crowded Western Conference.\n\nHe did not play on Thursday night against Boston, a 117-109 loss to the Celtics. But with two days before the next game against Golden State, Sunday would appear to be a real possibility for his debut.\n\n“He’s been around, been in a lot of games,” Thibodeau said. “He’s seen a lot of different things. He’s familiar with what we’re doing. He’s played with some of the guys that we have. So that’s a plus.”\n\nThe Timberwolves have been exploring a union with Rose for weeks — years, really — but appeared to table the idea until Butler went down with his knee injury. They bought out Shabazz Muhammad last Thursday and moved to get a deal done after dropping two straight road games to the Trail Blazers and Jazz.\n\nRose and Alaina Anderson had a baby earlier this week, and he said on Thursday morning that he was delaying signing with any team until the child arrived. By the time the team left Utah on Friday night, the Wolves were preparing to bring Rose aboard, sources said.\n\n“Thibs gave me time to get that situation taken care of and to come out here whenever I had time, so I respect him for that,” Rose said.\n\nThe Wolves also explored trade possibilities for Rose when he was with the Knicks in February of 2017 and again had talks with him this summer about adding him as a free agent. Wolves owner Glen Taylor was believed to initially be reluctant to add such a polarizing player to the roster, but ultimately signed off on it after Butler’s injury.\n\nBefore joining the Wolves, Rose wanted, and received, assurances that Taylor was supportive of the move, sources told The Athletic.\n\nThe losses to the Blazers and Jazz dropped the Wolves (38-28) from third in the West to sixth. Perhaps feeling a sense of urgency to add some scoring and size to their backcourt in the wake of Butler’s injury, the Wolves are hoping Rose can rekindle some of the success he had with Thibs in Chicago.\n\nHe was an MVP with the Bulls, one of the most dynamic players in the league and a point guard for the next generation before knee injuries derailed his career. He bounced around to New York and Cleveland before he was traded to the Jazz last month and immediately waived.\n\n“I’m big on the eye test,” Jamal Crawford said. “I don’t know what the numbers say, but my eyes tell me how good he is. This is just about him being comfortable, and that’s that.”\n\nAbout those numbers. He has a career true shooting percentage of .521 and his three-point percentage of .297 does little to address the Wolves’ desperate need for long-range shooting.\n\nRose has not played in a game since Feb. 7, his final one with the Cavaliers before being traded. He also missed more than two months earlier this season while dealing with an ankle injury and doing some soul-searching about his future in basketball.\n\n“I’ve been working out the entire time I’ve been out, just learning my routine, being a pro,” Rose said. “The only thing I’m missing now is the opportunity. Talking to Thibs, he sounds like he’s going to give me the opportunity, so it’s all about learning the guys and fitting in at the right time.”\n\nHe averaged 9.8 points in 16 games this season, but did average 18.0 points and shot 47 percent from the field in 64 games for the Knicks last season.\n\nRose will not be a focal point in Minnesota. Jeff Teague is the starting point guard and the Wolves also have Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns as primary scorers in addition to fan favorite Tyus Jones as the backup point guard. Thibs has been reluctant to play two point guards for much of this season — Jones and Teague have shared the court for just nine minutes — but said that the versatility that all three point guards have is a strength.\n\n“Jeff can play both positions, Derrick can play both positions and Tyus can play both positions,” Thibodeau said. “I think that’s the way of our league now. You want guys that can play multiple positions. It’s really position-less.”\n\nIf Rose can put his injuries behind him and avoid some of the soap operas that plagued him in New York and Cleveland, he could give the second unit a little more scoring punch. And he still garners a lot of respect from players around the league, including in the Wolves locker room.\n\n“He’s a dynamic player,” Teague said. “We definitely need that.”\n\nComing to Minnesota also allows Rose to be close to his hometown of Chicago, an important factor for him.\n\nThe move was met with doubt, skepticism and derision in some corners of the Timberwolves fan base, a group that has a strong allegiance to backup point guard Jones, a Minnesota native who has seen his minutes dwindle over the last month.\n\nIn addition to his injuries, Rose has been a mercurial presence with the Knicks and Cavaliers, having abruptly left both franchises in the middle of seasons. Add to that a highly publicized civil trial that ended in 2016 with a federal jury finding that a woman’s rape allegations against Rose and two friends lacked credibility, and the former MVP has become a lightning rod figure in the league.\n\n“I’m still here,” Rose said on Thursday. “That shows everybody about my character and all that. I’m still here playing, I still love the game. I can sit here and tell you all this by expressing it with words, I want to do it with action, with me here playing the way I want to play, and playing the way that’s going to help this team win.”\n\nWhen asked if he needed to do any due diligence on the trial, Thibodeau said, “I know who Derrick is. I know who he is. I spent a lot of time with him.”\n\nThat theme has defined Thibodeau’s tenure in Minnesota to this point. After a bitter split with the Bulls that was marked by distrust with the front office, he has surrounded himself with confidants in the front office, the coaching staff and on the court.\n\nIt all comes from a strong inner belief that he has the right blueprint to take the Timberwolves from a perennial lottery team to the playoffs for the first time since 2004, as long as he has the right people around him to execute it.\n\nNow here comes another former Bull from the Thibodeau heyday in Chicago to try to help him get there. The only thing that remains to be seen is how quickly, and how significantly, Rose enters the team’s game plan.\n\n“When Thibs got the job, for one,” Rose said when asked about first starting to look at Minnesota. “Him even being here. And you throw in Taj, Jimmy, and the coaching staff, I’ve been knowing them and been in battle with them for years, so it’s comfortable. I’m very comfortable here. Usually when I’m comfortable, I play well.”\n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated with the results of the game and reaction from Wolves players to Rose’s addition.\n\n(Top image: Ken Blaze/USA TODAY Sports)"
