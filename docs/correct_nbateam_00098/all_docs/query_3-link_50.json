        "text": "John Lucas III has kept up with the rehabilitation of Derrick Rose, his former Chicago Bulls teammate and close friend. In Lucas’ mind, Rose could return from his torn ACL as dominant as Adrian Peterson did for the Minnesota Vikings this NFL past season. “I think he might come back better than AP,” Lucas told RealGM. Ultimately, Lucas is hoping for Rose to make a full recovery, both physically and mentally. When Rose does come back, however, Lucas is confident in the 2011 NBA MVP being a better all-around player – with elevated athleticism.\n\nESPN.com’s Marc Stein first reported the talks, which a source told the Tribune were initiated by the Bulls and initially dismissed because of the Raptors’ desire to land the Lakers’ Pau Gasol. Though talks are not currently active, a source said the Raptors know the trade is available and could expand to include Nate Robinson and John Lucas III. Another source suggested it’s unlikely the Raptors would take on Boozer’s contract, which has $9.1 million more than Bargnani’s over the next two seasons."
