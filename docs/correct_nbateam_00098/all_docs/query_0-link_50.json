        "text": "The Toronto Raptors are getting close to signing Chicago Bulls point guard John Lucas III to a multi-year contract.\n\nAfter arriving in Toronto on Wednesday, Lucas tweeted about being in the city for the first time.\n\nLucas will join Jose Calderon and newly acquired front man Kyle Lowry as the team’s third point guard. However, with the season still months away, these is still the possibility that Calderon won’t be suiting up for the Raptors in the fall, making Lucas their No. 1 backup in that position.\n\nLucas was a lesser known player in the league during his stints with the Houston Rockets and the Chicago Bulls, but he drew attention last season filling in for an injured Derrick Rose.\n\nAfter entering the NBA through the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Summer League team, Lucas bounced around before landing with the Bulls in 2010. He averaged over seven points per game for Chicago last season."
