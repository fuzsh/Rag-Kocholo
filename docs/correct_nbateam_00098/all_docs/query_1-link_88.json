        "text": "The Detroit Pistons today signed point guard John Lucas III to a 10-day contract.\n\nLucas, listed at 5-feet-11, is being brought in as insurance behind new starter D.J. Augustin and rookie Spencer Dinwiddie, after starter Brandon Jennings suffered a season-ending left Achilles tear eight days ago in Milwaukee.\n\nOne source told the Free Press on Sunday that Lucas would sign and be at practice as soon as today.\n\nLucas, 32, has bounced around the NBA since his rookie year in 2005, playing with Houston, Chicago, Toronto and Utah, and having stints in Italy, Spain, China and the NBA D-League. He began this season with the Fujian Sturgeons in China.\n\nLast season with the Jazz, he played 42 games, averaging 3.8 points and 1.0 assists. He's also credited for being a mentor to then-rookie Jazz point guard Trey Burke (Michigan).\n\nLucas is the son of John Lucas, the former NBA No. 1 overall draft pick and coach."
