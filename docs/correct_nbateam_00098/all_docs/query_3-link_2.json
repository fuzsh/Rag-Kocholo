        "text": "CHICAGO — When LeBron James jumped over John Lucas III to dunk home an alley-oop in late January, Lucas' father called to say, “Our family just joined the witness protection program and changed its name.”\n\nWhen Lucas filled in for the injured Derrick Rose and C.J. Watson to score a career-high 25 points on 28 shots in mid-January, his father — who was the No. 1 pick in the 1976 draft and a coach of three NBA teams — called again.\n\n“I told him I'd send him two bags of ice for his head — so it wouldn't get too big,” John Lucas II said from Houston, before roaring with laughter.\n\nPerhaps getting waived by three NBA teams and spending three seasons between NBA stints playing overseas and in the Development League isn't so tough after all.\n\nLucas, who played at Oklahoma State, did his perseverance thing again Wednesday, scoring all of his 13 points in the fourth quarter of the Bulls' comeback victory in Toronto.\n\nBut if you think his father is all about tough love, think again.\n\nHe's also Lucas' biggest fan.\n\n“I'm most proud of him as a teammate,” Lucas II said. “He is always up and enthusiastic about his teammates. That is infectious. My son epitomizes being an NBA pro. It's not whether he plays. It's the fact he's there for his team in any and every capacity.”\n\nThat quality is also why coach Tom Thibodeau has so staunchly supported Lucas, whom he coached at the point guard's other NBA stop in Houston. This support, though, came under odd scrutiny on Nov. 26, 2010.\n\nWhen Rose awoke in Denver with a stiff neck, the Bulls signed Lucas, who flew from Houston, entered the game and missed two critical free throws with 12.9 seconds left. Carmelo Anthony promptly buried a buzzer-beating game-winner after the Bulls failed to rebound Anthony's first miss.\n\nLucas admitted to hearing some say he was signed merely because of his relationship with Thibodeau.\n\n“But I knew I was an NBA player then, and I know it now,” Lucas said, more matter-of-factly than boastfully. “And that didn't get me down, other than me feeling I let my team down. I just told myself I wouldn't miss game-winning free throws again. Free throws are supposed to be free points. I used that situation to learn.”\n\nThis perspective is what has helped Lucas not only survive, but also thrive. With Rose out indefinitely, he has scored more points in 37 games this season than in his 62 games of previous experience over three seasons.\n\n“That goes back to 6 a.m. before school, going to the gym, making 500 shots,” Lucas II said. “I told him: ‘Basketball is your job. And if you're not going to make shots, you're not going to make it.' ”\n\nThe elder Lucas also was an accomplished tennis player, appearing in professional tournaments. His son acquired that love but one day came home to announce he was quitting to focus on basketball. Listed at 5-foot-11, Lucas heard this advice from his father.\n\n“Don't disrespect the game,” Lucas II said. “Because of your size, always work on it because there is always somebody in front of you and somebody coming up behind you. For him, it was always about fighting, not being given anything. You have to respect that.”\n\nEven when playing overseas, Lucas never gave up on his belief to return to the NBA.\n\n“I knew I could play at this level,” he said. “I just needed an opportunity to show what I could do. And I always knew when I got an opportunity, I could take advantage of it.\n\n“My father taught me and my brother to never give up on yourself. Don't listen to outside voices. ‘Can't' shouldn't be in your vocabulary.”\n\nMCT Information Services"
