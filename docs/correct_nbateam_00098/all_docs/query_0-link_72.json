        "text": "This time, the score was 96-89 Chicago.\n\nThis time, the Bulls’ pest off the bench was Nate Robinson, rather than the departed John Lucas III, with Robinson scoring 13 points and even taking a charge against Ray Allen.\n\nThis time, Carlos Boozer was a determined force, tallying 27 points after averaging 10.4 against Miami in four contests last season.\n\nThis time, 6-foot-7 Jimmy Butler, who wasn’t part of previous Bulls rotations in this series, gave Dwyane Wade a little trouble late with his length.\n\nThis time, some of that stuff was different from previous losses to Chicago, different even than the loss last season to a Bulls squad that, like Friday night, was missing Derrick Rose.\n\nBut something was the same.\n\nThe Bulls beat the Heat on the scoreboard mostly because they beat the Heat to the boards, 48-28.\n\n“We’ve got to get better,” Erik Spoelstra said. “They’re just pounding us on the second chance. They’re just throwing the ball up there and playing volleyball against us.”\n\nBoozer, not exactly a high-flyer, had one fewer rebound (12) than the entire starting Heat front line, which was also one fewer than Chris Bosh has had over the past three games.\n\nChicago got to almost as many of the caroms (19) on the Heat’s defensive end as Miami did (24). LeBron James, playing with a knee contusion that left him a bit more tentative than usual, led the Heat in rebounds … with six.\n\n“If I’m not mistaken, the main players outside of Ray (Allen) that played in our rotation last year during the playoffs were the same as this year,” Spoelstra said. “It’s not rotation.”\n\nThat implies that, in his view, the issue is effort. It’s not clear that all the Heat players share that view. Privately, some have spoken of the risks of Pat Riley’s offseason strategy to add to a strength — long-range shooting — rather than shore up the interior weakness.\n\n“We’ve got to fix it,” said Wade, who scored 22 points. “We’re not going to get bigger overnight. We’ve got to find a way to fix it or we’re going to keep losing those games.”\n\nActually, this was the fifth time this season that an opponent outrebounded Miami by at least 15, and the first time the Heat had lost.\n\nThe solution?\n\n“Go get the ball,” Wade said.\n\n“You’ve got to stick your nose in there,” forward Shane Battier said. “And after a while, you understand where they’re coming from after taking shots. And it didn’t seem like we made the adjustments.”\n\nEven with its rebounding issues, Miami had a shot, down just one point at the half and within 87-81 with 4:35 left in the fourth quarter. But, with all the extra opportunities Chicago was securing, the Heat stars needed to be perfect down the stretch, and none was.\n\nJames stepped over the sideline before storming down the floor, and twice missed free throws. After Battier passed on an open look, Bosh was a foot short on one jumper — and later was stripped by Luol Deng before getting a chance to take another. Wade blew a layup and committed an offensive foul.\n\nAnd so the Bulls got the Heat again, perhaps proving that they are the East team most worthy of being taken seriously, and especially so after Rose returns.\n\n“We understand how important rebounding is, and it showed tonight,” Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nSpoelstra will be sure to show his team Saturday."
