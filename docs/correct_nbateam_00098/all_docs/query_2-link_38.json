        "text": "One of the worst messages to receive is the passing of a loved one or a friend. This happened to me yesterday. My friend Jeff, fellow USC alum, of which we golfed, his son goes to school with my son and we both coached our sons in T Ball together. The email read: San Juan Hills Golf Club Members, It is with a heavy heart that I share the sad news of the recent passing of our beloved bartender, Jeff Reeves. Jeff was more than just a bartender; he was a cherished friend, a confidant, and a beloved member of our San Juan Hills family‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs the hard part. He was of the first people I reached out to when I took this job. I asked if I could be a resource and help with financial planning, or insurance or estate planning. He declined and said timing wasn‚Äôt right. I followed up a few times and he said he knows he should but was to busy. Last month I saw him at the golf club and I told him I‚Äôm here for him. Two weeks ago, unexpectedly he was on life support. Then he passed away. I often tell people financial planning is usually number 49 of 50 on the list of important things to do. It almost always becomes number one for the wrong reasons. He left behind his wife Amy and son Caden. They have nothing in place and are hoping for donations from their friends and family. People may not want to have these conversations but I can 100% gurrentee that when it becomes a priority, it‚Äôs because a problem has already occurred. Jeff was loved by all of us, but he was just to busy to have these conversations and to busy to plan for his family. It both breaks my heart and pisses me off. If you pass tomorrow, do you know exactly what happens to your family? Or are you to busy to take care of them? Hit‚Äôem straight Jeff! You‚Äôll be missed.\n\nOur network weekly report came out and I found myself number 1 in the network office of all Advisors leading in new clients for last week. For all Advisors under 5 years, I took two of three and finished number one in lives written and new clients. I also took top three in weekly earnings and number two overall for lives written of the entire Irvine office. I don't often post about the \"look at me\" when it comes to what I do, but in this case, and to hide the actual numbers out of respect for my clients, it comes with a great feeling of gratitude and accomplishment. If you are in this business, you get how difficult in can be at times, especially in a society where it seems nobody wants a Financial Planner in their corner, yet 67% of America NEEDs a Financial Planner. The smartest people I know. The most talented and successful people I know, all have a Financial Planner. Most people work for someone else, because they should. In this business working for yourself, your best needs to be better. I have learned to understand and enforce my least acceptable client which means I represent Northwestern Mutual because we work with the top 3 to 5% of the market, period. My Advisor told me once, that in this business, the first five years feels like the sky is falling. But, in the second five years, things fall from the sky. Here's to catching things!\n\nThere has been many new connections recently, and since my Virtual Assistant team and I spend so much time reaching out, I wanted to introduce myself and share a little more about me. First, the unique stuff: No, I don‚Äôt have a Doctorate in Finance, it‚Äôs in Organizational Change and Leadership Development. Yes I always back into my parking spaces and also tuck my shoelaces in. All of my clothes are color coded and hung on the exact same style of hangers. Yes I own over a 100 pair of shoes and they each are individually stored in their own shoe bin and I clean them after each use. It‚Äôs true I always wipe my iPhone screen and my car screens so that there are no finger prints or smudging. I use shirt stays to keep my bed sheets tight and I still do the Marine Corps Boot Camp 45 degree angle‚Ä¶and on my kids beds too. Now the normal stuff: I love Christmas üéÑ and count down the days all year. It‚Äôs very common for me to randomly tell somebody how many days their are until Christmas üéÖüèª. I was born in VT and grew up in New England (that‚Äôs why I have an 857 Boston number). After an attempt at college, I decided to join the Marine Corps in 2000. This was supposed to be for four years and done. Instead I had a mix of active duty, reserves and time with the Dept of Defense lasting almost two decades. I started with Amazon in early February 2020 and after 3.5 years did a career change. I wanted to follow the steps of my Financial Advisor and I came over to Northwestern Mutual as I know as a client and from experience they are the best company by far. I want to do for others what my Advisor has done for me. Although I‚Äôm not married, I raise my kids with an even 50/50 co-parent split with their Mom who is amazing. I‚Äôm dating one remarkable individual of which we have a pretty fun life and enjoy travel and Netflix. My kids are eight and ten and do everything from equstrian to acting (my son starred in serval TV shows and one movie) and to the ocean and the beaches! I‚Äôm an alumni of University of Southern California and very active in their Alimni community. Favorite foods: Pizza, California burrito and Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi). Favorite car: Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio Favorite music with artist: 1) Rap (2Pac, Eazy E and Run DMC) 2) Alturnitive (Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins) 3) Rock (AC/DC, Rob Zombie and Pantera) 4) other: Frank Sinatra, Bob Marley and Taylor Swift (love me some Tay Tay!) Reach out, say hi and I‚Äôm always open for coffee and a handshake.\n\nI get asked often, \"Lucas, you have been to combat multiple times, lived to write about and share your stories and yet you seem...normal. How?\" It's a variation of questions which align to the underlying aspect of how do I function day to day and seem to be \"normal\". I can tell you 100% how, and it is strongly attributed to the mental health and spiritual alignment work I have put in over the past decade with my acupuncturist, Dr. Angela Kung and her team at ANGELA KUNG WELLNESS CENTER, INC. From signature acupuncture, to facial acupuncture, to cupping, massage therapy, and a lot of cognitive therapy and spiritual alignment, I am literately walking and moving around day to day both in the moment, and emotionally available to those who need me becuase of this. NOW I HAVE AN OPPERTUNITY TO GIVE BACK! and I am asking for your support. This past Saturday morning Angela and I sat down and talked which she shared her upcoming journey to not only run, but win the Mrs. Asia USA Crown Pageant this November 16th. I asked if I could open up my network to help and here we are. I would love to have a community from all walks come together and share her story, reach out for support, or come and watch as she takes the stage. First, I am asking Misa Chien, founder of the amazing The Authentic Asian, helping Asian Women find their true selves, and break through their barriers. I believe Dr. Kung would be a great connection mutually benefiting both of you as well as an addition to your community. Judy Tsuei, nobody on this platform shares stories and markets the way you do and I think your time and introduction could be a worthwhile opportunity to connect with Dr. Kung. Second, Huber Bongolan although Dr. Kung is not a USC Alum, she's in my family and perhaps we could use her story and inspiring message to be shared at one of our meetings / events and rally some support for her journey as a guest speaker. Lastly, Sandra Gonzalez, the amazing Coach, could we leverage your network and perhaps connect Dr. Kung to your friend, a former Miss Asian USA, Siray Kong? PS: I am giving up USC vs Nebraska, HOME game to attend this event and I hope to see so many of you there as well! If you would like to support, you can find the event information here https://lnkd.in/gGhXRnBu If you want to message her directly, DM me and I will leverage the introduction with her personally. Thanks!\n\nHow I lost $15,063 on an investment that was supposed to be the next best thing as a DIY \"stock investor\". People will tell me \"I manage my own investment accounts and do my own stock trading.\" I ask them if they understand how taxes work with their accounts, capital gains vs ordinary income with short or long term holdings and realized vs unrealized gains/loses and I get silence. I ask them how they respond to volatility and what‚Äôs their long stance? Still, silence. A personal story about investing. I used to think I was a DIY \"investor\", meaning I did my own research and bought/sold/traded my own stocks without any advice from a professional. I used various aspects of market research and watched Squawk on the Street . After all, how hard can it be...buy low sell high they say. Duh... Years ago, before I had a Financial Advisor, I was following a stock that was due to \"explode\" based on what I could tell. So I put some money in on an emotional basis, BUY IT NOW! Sure enough, the dream happened and it did. It went up and up a lot. Much like the short term success we saw with Game Stop or currently with Nvidia...and then...weeks later at an all time high it did what they called a \"reverse 7 to 1 split\". But hey, I was an expert right? I was a DIY and I knew that a split was good. And it spilt. But rather then my shares multiplying by seven, they reduced by multiples of seven and then the company delisted right after. As did my $15,063, of which I never saw again. Never again will I be a DIY when it comes to my finances. This isn't investment advice, but note within various investment accounts I own (speaking only to equities), the past year from June 2023 to June 2024, these accounts have seen a rate of return of: +125.82+ (all crypto) +57.15% (large cap) +57.08 (large cap + small cap) +9.21% (large+medium+small cap+international) And they have all continued to grow over the past 14 years. What used to be driven by emotion, is now very well controlled with logic and time. The stock market averages about a 10% return year over year. The S&P 500 averaged about 22.70% over the last year, and usually around 14.6% each year over the last 5 years. The Nasdaq averaged 31.83% return over the past year and over the past 40 years averages about a 13% ROI. Maybe a I had a lucky past year. Maybe I picked all winners. Maybe I got lucky. But when my average return is at 62.3% over the last year and beats all of the above, maybe...it's a combination of everything. Or maybe, I just listened to my Advisor and took his advice. The moral of this story is if you want to be a DIY investor, enjoy the losses. But if you want to have someone who can help you navigate a good decision vs a bad one, or an emotional one vs a logical one, sit down with a professional.\n\nLinkedIn Network, I need your support. My ask: I have room to take on five new clients this month and would love to offer my services and resources to be of service. My give: I had five clients fall off last month due to various health reasons (all declined for insurance). I‚Äôm looking to do insurance planning for five new potential clients no matter their need. There are three areas of interests or needs and I‚Äôm asking for help to fill these gaps. If you have been dragging your feet to get this going, let‚Äôs set that up now and solve this need. It‚Äôs the right thing to do. 1) Life insurance: comes in all shapes and sizes but anyone who is married or has young kids should 100% have the appropriate amount of life insurance. Group benefits through your employer DO NOT count. They are not yours and you don‚Äôt own them. This is the only tax free asset that I can think off that takes care of your family when you pass. 2) Income Protection or disability income: almost all W2 employers offer around 60% coverage and that‚Äôs taxed. There is about a 50% shortage if/when you become injured or an illness takes over and you can‚Äôt work. Almost all people I meet with need additional coverage. Also, if you own a business and you don‚Äôt have your own plan, someone guided you in the wrong direction and I‚Äôm sorry for that. It‚Äôs an inexpensive solution to an expensive problem. 3) Long term care: many of my clients that get this either are in a position to provide or oversee care for their family or a loved one. The other half have a special needs person and they need the money provided from the LTC to help with care and needs. Nobody wants to talk about insurance, I get it. But almost everybody needs it at some point and that was yesterday for many of you. Message me or call and let‚Äôs see how my team and I can help. I became a Financial Advisor because of what my Advisor was able to do for me over the last decade. I started with insurance, and built my planning with additional investments and more insurance over the years. I want to give that opportunity to as many as possible that want to be better for their family and their children. I can help you achieve that. The only catch‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt make you. You have to want this and you have to act!\n\nI see messages like this often, and being in the Veteran Community, I see them more often then one should, almost always followed by a GoFundMe account to help the families with their finances. FOLKS!!! That is exactly what life insurance is for. I have never donated to a GoFundMe and I never will. My goal is to put them out of business. If you pass (could be today, cold be in 40 years) it doesn't matter if your kids are young or grown and out of the house, you need life insurance when you die. Please don't be the person who says, \"my spouse will figure it out...\" or \"she can just sell our rental property...\" I have followed Sheryl J. Moore for a while and she knows the business inside and out. Thank you for sharing and for being such an advocate in the financial planning world."
