        "text": "Back in the day, guard Derrick Rose was one of the best players in the NBA, not to mention one of its most irresistible forces.\n\nIn fact, John Lucas III and C.J. Watson, who were both teammates of Rose, said that opponents would pretend to be injured or ill so that they wouldn’t have to compete against him.\n\nIn recent years, Rose has been a backup for several teams, and it is therefore easy to forget how great a player he was just over a decade ago.\n\nHe was the first player chosen in the 2008 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, and he quickly helped uplift a franchise that had struggled to maintain any growth after Michael Jordan’s retirement.\n\nRose won the Rookie of the Year award, and just two seasons later he was named the regular season MVP for averaging 25.0 points and 7.7 assists per game while leading Chicago to the best record in the league.\n\nThe team also had the best record the following season (along with the San Antonio Spurs), but its big playoff aspirations went up in smoke when Rose suffered a severe knee injury early in the postseason. Since then, he has struggled to remain healthy.\n\nBut before that knee injury, he was an athletic freak who was able to explode and throw down monstrous dunks, and he also possessed outstanding speed in the open court.\n\nThere is a parallel to be made between a young Rose and Ja Morant, who has displayed many of the same qualities over his first four seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies."
