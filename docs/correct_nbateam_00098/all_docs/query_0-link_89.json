        "text": "The D.C. area is where John Lucas became a star. Now, he’s being honored for his contributions to the city’s sports scene.\n\nLucas will be one of eight people inducted into the Washington D.C. Sports Hall of Fame, the organization announced Tuesday, and it was meaningful for the former Maryland star point guard.\n\n“I was excited,” Lucas told The Athletic. “The first thing I did was call my two boys. They both coach. I told them, ‘I just wanted y’all to know just how good your dad was.’ The Last Dance was going on. I said, ‘That was me! I was Michael Jordan then.’ They said, ‘Yeah right, Dad.'”\n\nLucas, a standout in College Park from 1972 to 1976, was the first starting freshman in the school’s history. He averaged 18 points to go with five assists during a four-year collegiate career that included acclaimed former teammates, like Len Elmore and Tom McMillen. He made three All-American teams as a basketball player, two of them as a member of the first-team. He was an All-American tennis player as well, and won the ACC singles championship in 1974 and in 1976.\n\nThe Houston Rockets selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1976 NBA Draft, kickstarting a 14-year NBA career. He returned to D.C. from 1981 to 1983 to play for the then-Bullets.\n\n“(Making the D.C. Sports Hall of Fame) is a really, really big honor for me,” he said. “You hope that you’re never overlooked. I tried to be the best athlete. And D.C. is very, very special to me, because that’s where I had my drug problems, and that’s where I came back from them. And that’s where I love because I owe them so much.”\n\nThe drug problems will be part of Lucas’ legacy as much as the athletic accolades.\n\nHe struggled with alcoholism and cocaine addiction that he started to acknowledge privately during his time with the Bullets. Troubles followed him from Washington to the Spurs, then the Rockets, to whom he returned for a second stint in 1984. In 1985-86, with the NBA starting to crack down the league-wide prevalence of cocaine (teammates of Lucas’ and others around the league had been banned for drug use), he twice tested positive for the narcotic. Instead of fighting it, he volunteered to go into rehabilitation.\n\nIt changed his life — and thus, the lives of many others.\n\n“I’ve been sober 35 years,” he said. “I was in Houston (in ’86). I was with the Rockets. But when I admitted to having a problem (was) when I was in D.C. And it took me six years to get sober … We had no rules or anything in place when I admitted my problem with the Bullets. Nothing was in place. We had no substance-abuse, none of those programs. And I started those with (former NBA commissioner) David Stern once I got sober.”\n\nThe Rockets released him shortly after the two positive tests. He signed with the Bucks midway into the next season and ended up playing another few years in the league before retiring in 1990. He has since cemented his legacy with John Lucas Enterprises, a substance abuse recovery center for athletes.\n\n“The worst effect on my life was that I lost me,” he said. “Like what’s going on in our country, everybody has to have a born-again moment. And when I finally accepted my problem, I had a born-again moment. I had a point of clarity.”\n\nLucas, just like the rest of the country, has followed the U.S.’s “born-again moment” closely. The Black Lives Matter protests in response to the killing of George Floyd were a frequent topic during his conversation with The Athletic if only because they remind him of times he hoped were done.\n\nThe 66-year-old grew up in Durham, N.C. His father was the principal of a predominantly black school that became integrated while he was a child. Anti-integration protesters used to picket outside his childhood window.\n\n“I see today that the country is right back where we were,” Lucas said. “I never used to believe it, but history does repeat itself — only this time it’s in a different fashion … I faced it as (I was) playing tennis in the south, where I couldn’t use the bathroom at the country clubs because of who I was. I couldn’t play on the courts, because of my color. So, I’ve faced it. I’ve seen crosses being burned … That’s always been common in my community growing up. We had to be two times better to be equal.”\n\nHis hope is for people here to take a leadership position in times of change.\n\n“D.C. is where our government is, and as much as New York and other parts of the country give us their lead, everything starts with the center,” he said. “And the spiritual center of our country is Washington, DC. And we take their lead. … The whole world is watching how you lead us.”\n\nLucas has spent a post-career molding younger generations. He’s currently a player development coach with the Rockets, the same team that drafted him in 1976 and that he went on to play for a second time, but he’s held higher roles for NBA franchises. He was the head coach of the Spurs, 76ers and Cavaliers for two years apiece, and was the general manager of the Sixers for a couple of seasons, as well. He is still active in helping athletes in multiple sports overcome addiction.\n\nThe hall’s 2020 class also includes four-time Pro Bowl receiver Gary Clark; local high-school basketball star and NBA standout Austin Carr; former T.C. Williams High School football coach Herman Boone, who was portrayed in the movie, “Remember the Titans;” U.S national soccer team coach Jill Ellis; high school basketball coach Bob Dwyer; talk radio personality Ken Beatrice; former UDC basketball coach Wil Jones; and two championship teams, the 2019 Washington Mystics and 2019 Washington Nationals.\n\n“I always felt I was in the D.C. hall of fame for sports,” Lucas said. “I was an All-American in two sports, athlete of the year, an All-American for three years in basketball and then a two-time All-American in tennis. So for me, that wasn’t ever an issue. … But Maryland has always been special to me. The D.C. area has always been special to me. So every time I come to D.C. as a coach, as a player, it’s always a sense of pride.”\n\n(Top photo by Maryland/Collegiate Images via Getty Images)"
