        "text": "[jwplayer RwVfsh9w]\n\nIt was a turbulent end to the 2019-20 season for Houston Rockets forward Danuel House Jr., who exited the playoffs and the NBA’s Disney World “bubble” early due to a violation of campus rules.\n\nBut the 27-year-old is under contract with the Rockets for two more seasons, and he appears to have a preference regarding his next coach.\n\nOn Monday morning, House quote tweeted a story referencing the growing candidacy of Rockets assistant coach John Lucas. House tagged Lucas in his message, which included several “praying” emojis.\n\nAfter listing Lucas as an emerging candidate, Marc Stein of The New York Times cited “strong working relationships” between Lucas and All-Star guards James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Based on House’s tweet, it certainly seems that there’s a good relationship there, as well.\n\nPrior to his bubble exit, House averaged 11.4 points (35.8% on 3-pointers) and 5.8 rebounds in 31.0 minutes per game during the playoffs. At 6-foot-6, he’s also among the longest and most athletic options for the undersized Rockets in their versatile and switch-heavy defense.\n\nNow 66 years old, Lucas hasn’t been an NBA head coach since 2003. But starting in 2016, he began working for Mike D’Antoni as Houston’s director of player development. That could give Lucas a leg up with regards to understanding the team’s roster and its preferred playing style, and he’s already built relationships with key personnel.\n\nBesides Lucas, other reported candidates for the Rockets include recent Los Angeles Clippers assistants Ty Lue and Sam Cassell; former Brooklyn head coach Kenny Atkinson; Dallas assistant Stephen Silas; Denver assistant Wes Unseld Jr.; Minnesota assistant David Vanterpool; and former coach Jeff Van Gundy, who led the Rockets from 2003 until 2007."
