        "text": "Several 76ers are excited that former NBA players Chuck Hayes and John Lucas III recently met with coach Brett Brown as the team possibly looks to add much-needed veteran leadership.\n\n\"I think that will be good for us to have any type of veterans,\" Nerlens Noel said. \"I think [general manager] Sam [Hinkie] is looking into that a little more. . . . You know Chuck Hayes is a big man and I think it's going to help us.\"\n\nTony Wroten would also welcome the additions.\n\n\"We are just trying to do whatever we can to help the team get better and better in the future and the present. So what's best for the team is what needs to be done.\"\n\nHayes, 32, played power forward and center for 10 seasons combined with the Houston Rockets, Sacramento Kings, and Toronto Raptors. He participated in the Los Angeles Clippers' training camp this fall before being waived Oct. 24. The former Kentucky standout then re-signed with the Rockets on Nov. 1 before being released a week later.\n\nLucas, 33, was a point guard during his seven-year career with the Rockets, Raptors, Chicago Bulls, Utah Jazz, and Detroit Pistons. He signed with the Miami Heat for training camp and was waived Oct. 24.\n\n\"It's our job to find players. . . . We owe this city,\" Brown said. We owe this program. It's our best effort to find ways to move it forward. And that's part of it.\"\n\nAsked if Hayes and Lucas would join this team, Brown responded, \"We are looking at a lot of things. To say that they will join the team at this stage is not true.\"\n\nThough he declined to give names, Brown said the team is not talking just to Hayes and Lucas.\n\nThe Sixers acquired Nik Stauskas in a trade with the Sacramento Kings in June because of the guard's shooting ability.\n\nStauskas, however, didn't attempt a shot while playing a total of 32 minutes in the three games leading into Tuesday.\n\n\"Sometimes when I'm out on the floor, I just feel like my job is to space the floor and create space for other people,\" he said. \"A lot of times that means I'm in the corners. If other people can be in the pick-and-rolls and post-ups and they're busy scoring, a lot of times that means I'm not going to be getting the ball.\n\n\"I've just got to find ways to be more aggressive and be more involved. That's really all I can do.\""
