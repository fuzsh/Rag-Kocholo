        "text": "Free agency is all but over in the NBA, yet there are still a few players out there trying to find a home before the start of training camp. Among them is Andray Blatche, who is in Houston working out with John Lucas as he prepares for his next NBA gig. His most recent meeting was with the Brooklyn Nets. Blatche talks with HOOPSWORLD about his breakup with the Washington Wizards, how John Lucas is helping him, his chances of landing with the Nets and more in this exclusive interview:\n\nTo that end, Blatche’s mother, Angela Oliver, helped facilitate a connection with John Lucas, who is based in Houston. Lucas, the former NBA guard, coach and general manager, has built a reputation for resuscitating ailing NBA careers. Lucas said he looked at Blatche and saw a familiar reflection. “That was me,” he said, “26 years ago in the league.”"
