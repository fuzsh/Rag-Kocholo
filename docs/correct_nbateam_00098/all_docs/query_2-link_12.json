        "text": "[jwplayer 4FUs8oVk-z6KDnl0B]\n\nThe Houston Rockets are close to reaching an agreement with John Lucas to be an assistant on the staff of new coach Stephen Silas, as first reported by Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nSince 2016, Lucas has worked with the Rockets as the director of player development for previous head coach Mike D’Antoni. The 66-year-old veteran coach was reportedly one of three finalists in Houston’s recent search for the lead job, alongside Silas and Jeff Van Gundy.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, Lucas was a head coach with San Antonio, Philadelphia, and Cleveland. His age and extensive experience could be a good fit with the 47-year-old Silas, who is becoming an NBA head coach for the first time. Lucas also has existing relationships with current Houston players like All-Star guards James Harden and Russell Westbrook, which is part of why he was a finalist for the main job.\n\nBesides Lucas, other names reportedly in consideration for Silas’ staff had included former NBA head coaches Jeff Hornacek and Nate McMillan. However, Marc Stein of The New York Times reported Wednesday that McMillan was nearing an agreement with Atlanta, instead.\n\nThere is no clear timetable for Silas’ complete staff to be named."
