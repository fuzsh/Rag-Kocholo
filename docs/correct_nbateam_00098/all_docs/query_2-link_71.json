        "text": "Deep down, Phil Martelli probably didn’t think he’d get another one of these. Most lifers in college basketball don’t get one chance to go to a Final Four, let alone two. In those immediate years after Saint Joseph’s cosmic 2004 season, the images would flash in his mind’s eye. They’d usually appear during his drive down City Line Avenue, the four-lane dividing line between West Philadelphia and the city suburbs, as he’d head to work at Saint Joseph’s. His imagination would take over. He’d see John Lucas III’s shot. He’d see Jameer Nelson’s miss. Then he’d press his eyes closed and see the ball go in.\n\n“I would just get this vision — like, what would that have been like?” Martelli says. “For a really long time, it was every day. I’d see it every day.”\n\nHere is Martelli on Monday. He’s inside his room at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis, watching film of UCLA. On Tuesday, Michigan will play those 11th-seeded Bruins for a chance to stay in Indy for another week. The Wolverines are looking for their third Final Four appearance since 2013. Juwan Howard is looking for his first trip to college basketball’s holy land as the program’s coach, but played in two as a star forward in 1992 and ’93. Six players on the Michigan roster — three scholarships players and three walk-ons — got to experience the Wolverines’ 2018 trip to the Final Four. So did assistant coach Saddi Washington, strength coach Jon Sanderson and multiple other personnel members in the program.\n\nMartelli? He has been a college basketball coach since 1985.\n\nHe has attended, he guesses, 30 Final Fours.\n\nHe has coached in zero.\n\nAnd for most of his career, even though it was a dream to get there, it was reasonably accepted he’d probably never do so. But that was before Martelli’s tenure at St. Joe’s was terminated in the spring of 2019 and he, through a bizarre string of events, landed at, of all places, the University of Michigan as associate head coach and consigliere to Howard. He took the job, in part, because it afforded him — a man who’d spent 34 years at a cash-strapped Catholic school from the Atlantic 10 — a chance to see how the other side lives and compete for an actual national championship.\n\nBack when Martelli accepted Howard’s offer, he couldn’t have anticipated things ever going this well (minus the pandemic), but, all the same, here he is. Michigan, the No. 1 seed in the East Region, is one win away from the Final Four. A victory over Florida State in the Sweet 16 advanced these Wolverines to the Elite Eight. Next up, it’s UCLA. Forty minutes.\n\n“My bucket list has been my bucket list for a long time — and near the top has been having the chance to get to a Final Four,” Martelli said Monday. “That’s what flashed into my head (Sunday) when I was sitting on the bench. This was why. This is why I’m here. I don’t want that to come off as selfish, but know what that chance meant to the ’03-04 (St. Joe’s) team. College basketball is meant to create lifetime memories for people. This is the chance for a certain special memory for this group.“\n\nSo that’s Martelli today.\n\nHere was Martelli back then.\n\nFirst, start in 1997. At 43, Martelli was in his second year as the coach at Saint Joseph’s. (His prior career consisted of 10 years as an SJU assistant, some high school coaching in Philly and owning a bar.) He took the Hawks to the NIT finals in his first season, but Year 2 was a damn fever dream. St. Joe’s came from nowhere to climb the national rankings, win the Atlantic 10 and go to the NCAA Tournament as a No. 4 seed. As it often does, March brought celebrity. Martelli went from a nobody to somebody overnight. He was a megawatt of personality — some kind of spiritual descendant of Al McGuire, Jim Valvano and Rick Majerus. The guy could talk. TV loved him. Writers loved him. He paired jokes the national media could get with parochial quips as a wink-and-a-nod to the Philly crowd. He made fun of his own hairline, but warned that his team was no joke. Everyone ate it up. The Hawks went to the Sweet 16 and lost to some team coached by Rick Pitino.\n\nA few years later, in 2001, the Hawks were back and those CBS cameras were thrilled to see Martelli again. St. Joe’s played the part of the perfect little underdog. Before a second-round game against top-seeded Stanford, star Casey Jacobson said he didn’t know where the school was and or who opposing star Marvin O’Connor was. The Hawks responded by scaring Stanford to death behind 37 points from O’Connor, who left to a standing ovation from both fan bases. Martelli said afterward, “College basketball was served well by that game.” Every March, he has always had a way with words like that.\n\nBy the time 2004 rolled around, though, everything was different. Everyone knew where Saint Joseph’s was located. A 27-0 regular season led the Hawks to an absurd No. 1 national ranking. Jameer Nelson was on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Martelli was bigger, larger. A known commodity. Not just the funny Italian guy with “The Sopranos” jokes. He had some weight to him — figuratively. People cared what he had to say, and he obliged with plenty to say. Most famously, after Billy Packer continually knocked Saint Joseph’s credentials as a No. 1 seed on CBS, Martelli told thousands of gatherers at a school Selection Sunday party: “Billy Packer can kiss my ass.” Cameras were rolling. It was gold.\n\nThat year changed everything. St. Joe’s was everywhere. Nelson was everywhere. Martelli was everywhere. The season ended with Lucas hitting a soul-sucking 3-pointer with 6.9 seconds remaining in the Elite Eight. The shot gave Oklahoma State a 64-62 lead. Taking the ensuing inbounds pass, Nelson glanced over to Martelli. The coach pocketed his remaining timeout and told the national player of the year to make a play. Nelson drove down the middle of the floor, crossed the 3-point line, pulled up for a jumper and …\n\nThat game, that day. They’re frozen. They have been for 17 years.\n\n“It’s come up in my mind that …” Martelli said Monday, starting, stopping, hesitating and continuing … “I know that if you say my name, people of a certain age, they think, ‘Man, that team, that game.’ As soon as they say it, I know what they’re talking about.”\n\nThere were, of course, so many other games, so many other teams. Martelli’s 2014 Hawks, a No. 10 seed in the tournament, lost in overtime to eventual national champion UConn. His 2016 team, a No. 8 seed, led top-seeded Oregon by seven points with under five minutes to go in the second round before falling victim to a late rally.\n\n“But no one ever mentions those games,” Martelli said. “Those games never, ever come up.”\n\nMartelli made it to the Elite Eight once. And lost. And that’s where, he admits, his history has felt forever tethered. That is, oddly, until now.\n\nAs associate head coach at Michigan, Martelli is two years into his role as confidant to Howard. When he took the job after 24 years in charge and another 10 seasons as an assistant, he saw it as an opportunity to “coach a coach,” lending some experience to a first-time head coach navigating the college waters. It has become a role more endearing and rewarding than he ever managed. It helps that the Wolverines have won a lot.\n\nThe job has brought Martelli back here — back to March, back to this stage, except in a very different light. It used to be about him, and he didn’t exactly shy away. Now it’s not about him. It’s about Howard. The funny guy America fell for all those years ago? He’s there, but he’s not there.\n\nAnd he’s OK with that.\n\n“I didn’t just get a job at Michigan,” Martelli said. “I got an opportunity. I needed to go somewhere to work and where I’d have value. I was hoping I could make an impact and not just be the proverbial old guy sitting on the bench. I found that.”\n\nHow?\n\n“The biggest angst coming in was wondering when do I speak up, when do I interject,” he went on, that Philly accent still thick after two years away from home. “Whether it’s basketball or organizationally or scouting, how do I blend? I had to figure that out. Because I knew that in this role, not everybody is going to want to hear my voice all the time. So it was toes-in-the-wooder (water), trying to find my way.”\n\nIt should be said here that the guy Martelli was back in the day — he’s still that guy. He’s just programed differently these days. He knows this job is not that job.\n\nThere are moments of self-actualization. Early on in this tournament, for instance, Martelli passed Hartford coach John Gallagher in a hallway at the Indianapolis Convention Center. Gallagher was a walk-on on St. Joe’s 1997 Sweet 16 team and this year was a first-time head coach in the NCAA Tournament. He’s also a fast talker from Delaware County and a world-class talker. That’s why he did every interview imaginable before his Hartford team bowed out to Baylor in the first round.\n\nSeeing Gallagher in the hallway, Martelli said: “Look, a little piece of advice — be sure to leave enough oxygen in Indianapolis for everyone to breathe. Give it a rest!”\n\nThe two shared a laugh. A lot has happened since ’97.\n\n“I felt like I was talking to myself,” Martelli said.\n\nNow, in many ways, Martelli has a chance to write himself a different chapter. The game against UCLA is about Michigan, not Martelli, but it’s not every day you get to see a man get a second chance at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\n“The guys on this team, this staff — it’s incredible,” Martelli said. “I was just daydreaming the other day, thinking that, you know, here we are on the brink of this, and I’m already honestly able to say that I’ve gotten more than I given. And it’s not like I’ve shorted anybody. I’ve given all that I have. “\n\nFor the record, Martelli has never rewatched that 2004 game. He’s never seen a replay of Nelson’s missed shot. He won’t relive it, but he will use the experience. Back then, on the day before the Elite Eight game, UConn women’s coach Geno Auriemma called Martelli with some sage advice that still echos today.\n\nHe told Martelli: “No matter what, you cannot let those players think that this is the biggest game of their lives.”\n\n“So that’s the way I’m going to approach this game,” Martelli said. “It’s a big game, but it’s still just the next game.”\n\nIt is. But it isn’t.\n\nEither way, Martelli will do what he would do before any game: “Maybe a little food, get my exercise in and get my prayers in … “\n\nHe paused. “Well …\n\n“You know, I might slip in one extra prayer.”\n\n(Top photo: Courtesy of Nolan Bona / Michigan Sports Television)"
