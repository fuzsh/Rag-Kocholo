        "text": "Kevin Porter Jr. is a controversial player. Since his arrival in the NBA three seasons ago --when the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the 30th pick in the draft--, the forward has not stopped adding explosive chapters like the one he played in the game between the Houston Rockets and the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAccording to reports, the player came to the locker room at halftime of the game and had a heated discussion with John Lucas, assistant coach of the Rockets. The coach blamed the player for his poor performance during the first half against the Colorado franchise (eight points, three assists, and a block), which made Porter angry.\n\nAfter throwing several objects in the locker room, the shooting guard left the pavilion before the second half.\n\nThe discussion had a third protagonist: team star Christian Wood, who did not start after refusing to pass an antigen test. Wood confronted his coach and refused to come out in the second half, although, unlike Porter, he did remain on the bench.\n\nWood was late to warm up, according to sources. After starting all 34 games earlier this season, he came off the bench. He played 8 minutes in the first half on Saturday and hit 0-of-4 shots from the field.\n\nPorter's scandals\n\nKevin Porter's talent has been overshadowed by several chapters of indiscipline, such as when he was arrested for possession of weapons and marijuana and posted certain cryptic messages that raised suspicions about his mental health.\n\nEspecially during the pandemic, when he set off alarm bells within the Cavaliers with a post in which he asked his followers, \"Have you ever wished to see the end of your time?\".\n\nMonths later, the relationship between the player and the Ohio franchise went up in smoke. The 20-year-old shooting guard came to the Rockets and seemed to forget his disciplinary problems.\n\nHowever, he was soon fined $50,000 for violating the competition's health and safety protocols after going out with Rockets teammate Sterling Brown to a nightclub in Miami in early April.\n\nHis escapade also resulted in a severe incident, as Brown was attacked by several assailants outside the club. He received several blows to the back of the head with a bottle and ended up drenched in blood.\n\nOn the court, the shooting guard scored a career-high 50 points, including nine three-pointers, and dished out 11 assists in his best NBA game."
