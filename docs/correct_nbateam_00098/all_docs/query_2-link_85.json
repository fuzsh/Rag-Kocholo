        "text": "Heat 101, Nets 90\n\nLeBron James returned to the lineup and scored 22 of his 32 points in the first quarter, and the Miami Heat rolled to a 101-90 victory over the New Jersey Nets on Saturday night despite playing without Dwyane Wade.\n\nWade missed his third straight game with a bruised left foot, but James had the game under control by the time his all-star teammate arrived at his seat on the bench.\n\nJames made his first seven shots, leaping high for dunks, lobs and blocked shots and showing no effects from the sprained left ankle that forced him to miss a game. The NBA's leading scorer added nine assists and seven rebounds.\n\nChris Bosh added 16 points after a slow start for the Heat, who won their third straight and ran the NBA's best record to 8-1. They hope to have Wade back when they move to the West for the final three games of a five-game trip.\n\nKris Humphries tied a career high with 25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for the Nets, who shot just 33.7 per cent in front of a sellout crowd of 18,711. Deron Williams had 10 points and 10 assists but was just 4 of 16 from the field.\n\nJames took part in the morning shootaround, but the Heat didn't decide he would play until shortly before tipoff in order to see how he felt after warming up.\n\nHe was fine.\n\nJames quickly proved it, taking a hit but converting the basket for a three-point play barely a minute into the game during the Heat's 10-0 start. He hung on the rim as the backboard shook for a couple of seconds after one dunk, appearing to motion to someone near the court.\n\nHawks 109, Bulls 94\n\nJosh Smith scored 25 points, Joe Johnson and Vladimir Radmanovic each added 17 and the Atlanta Hawks beat Chicago 109-94 Saturday night to snap the Bulls' six-game winning streak.\n\nJohn Lucas III had 14 of his team-high 16 points in the fourth quarter for Chicago, which never led. The Bulls, who dropped to 7-2, had been off to their best start since going 12-0 in 1996-97.\n\nDerrick Rose, last season's league MVP, scored eight points for Chicago — his lowest total since the Bulls took a 17-point victory at Toronto on Dec. 15, 2010. He did not return to the game after leaving with 2:29 left in the third quarter.\n\nBoth teams used mostly reserves in the fourth before Atlanta coach Larry Drew had starters Smith, Johnson and Al Horford enter the game for a few minutes late in the final period.\n\nKyle Korver finished with 13 points for the Bulls, and Carlos Boozer and Jimmy Butler each had 12. Omer Asik pulled down a game-high 13 rebounds.\n\nThe outcome was in stark contrast to last Tuesday at Chicago, where the Hawks blew a 19-point lead in the third quarter and allowed the Bulls to outscore them 34-18 in the final period for a 76-74 loss.\n\nKnicks 103, Pistons 80\n\nAmare Stoudemire scored 22 points and Mike Bibby added 16 to lead the New York Knicks to an easy 103-80 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night.\n\nCarmelo Anthony scored 13 points in three quarters for New York, which led 64-42 at halftime and by 29 after three. The Detroit fans had little to cheer about — except when highlights of Lions touchdowns from their playoff game in New Orleans were shown on the big screen.\n\nBrandon Knight led the Pistons with 19 points.\n\nBibby has scored 27 points in his last two games after scoring seven through New York's first six.\n\nDetroit guard Rodney Stuckey sat out with a groin injury, and the Pistons were also without forwards Austin Daye and Charlie Villanueva, who had sore ankles.\n\nPacers 99, Bobcats 77\n\nRoy Hibbert scored 20 points to help the Indiana Pacers beat the Charlotte Bobcats 99-77 on Saturday night.\n\nHibbert, who briefly left the game with a sprained right ankle, also had eight rebounds and three blocks. Tyler Hansbrough scored 15 points, Darren Collison had 14, and Danny Granger and George Hill each added 13 for the Pacers (6-2), who improved to 3-0 at home. Indiana was coming off an 87-74 win at Boston on Friday night.\n\nD.J. Augustin scored 20 points, Gerald Henderson had 14 points and 10 rebounds, and Byron Mullens added 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Bobcats (2-6).\n\nIndiana shot 51 per cent and held the Bobcats to 33-per cent shooting — the fifth time the Pacers have held an opponent under 40 per cent.\n\nThunder 98, Rockets 95\n\nKevin Durant hit a jumper with 22 seconds left and nailed two free throws to give the Oklahoma City Thunder a 98-95 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night.\n\nDurant finished with 27 points and six rebounds, Russell Westbrook added 25 points and six assists, and reserve Nazr Mohammed had a season-high 17 points and six rebounds for the Thunder. Oklahoma City won its second straight over Houston and plays its final game of a back-to-back-to-back stretch Sunday in San Antonio.\n\nLuis Scola had a season-high 28 points and seven rebounds, Goran Dragic had a season-best 20 points and eight assists, and Kevin Martin had 16 points to lead the Rockets (2-6), who have lost four straight games.\n\nAfter Durant put the Thunder on top 96-95 with 22 seconds left, Chandler Parsons missed a three-point attempt, but the ball went out of bounds off the Thunder. Dragic missed a running jumper with seven seconds left, and Durant grabbed the rebound and was fouled.\n\nSpurs 121, Nuggets 117\n\nDanny Green scored a season-high 24 points to help the San Antonio Spurs beat the Denver Nuggets 121-117 on Saturday night.\n\nGreen hit two free throws with 3.6 seconds left to ice it for the Spurs (6-2), who won their sixth straight home game and third in a row overall.\n\nDanilo Gallinari tied his career high with 31 points as the Nuggets (6-3) snapped a four-game winning streak.\n\nWith former Nuggets coach Doug Moe in the building, the game had the feeling of an old ABA matchup, with both teams scoring seemingly at will. San Antonio hit 49 of 89 shots, while Denver shot even better, knocking down 46 of 81 from the floor.\n\nGallinari hit a three-pointer with 7.6 seconds left to pull Denver to 119-116, but Green followed with his two free throws and the Spurs held on.\n\nMavericks 96, Hornets 81\n\nVince Carter and Ian Mahinmi had 13 points each to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 96-81 victory over New Orleans on Saturday to hand the depleted Hornets their sixth consecutive loss.\n\nCarter and Mahinmi led a balanced scoring attack for the Mavericks (4-5), who won their fourth straight at home and had six players scoring in double figures.\n\nAl-Farouq Aminu had 15 points and 12 rebounds to lead New Orleans, which was without three players who are in its regular rotation. Hornets post player Jason Smith missed the game to be with his family after the death of his grandmother Friday night. Guard Eric Gordon (bruised right knee) and forward Trevor Ariza (groin strain) were also out.\n\nThe Hornets played their second of three consecutive games in three days. They lost at home against the Nuggets on Friday, and play in Denver on Sunday.\n\nJazz 88, Warriors 87\n\nGordon Hayward made a go-ahead free throw with 11 seconds remaining, lifting the Utah Jazz past the Golden State Warriors 88-87 on Saturday night for their fourth straight victory.\n\nHayward finished with 18 points, six rebounds and four assists, and Al Jefferson added 15 points and eight rebounds for the Jazz, who shot just 39.5 percent.\n\nMonta Ellis had 32 points and six assists but had a costly turnover that led to Hayward's free throw and missed a running bank shot at the buzzer to send Golden State to its fifth straight loss. Stephen Curry and starting center Andris Biedrins sat out for the second straight game with sprained right ankles for Golden State.\n\nClippers 92, Bucks 86\n\nBlake Griffin had 22 points and 14 rebounds, Caron Butler scored 20 points against the team he suffered a season-ending injury against last January, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the severely undermanned Milwaukee Bucks 92-86 on Saturday night.\n\nChauncey Billups added 19 points for the Clippers in a chippy game that resulted in a combined 54 fouls, including a flagrant 1 against Milwaukee's Larry Sanders for his hard takedown of Butler on an attempted layup with 1:38 left in the third quarter. Chris Paul had nine points and seven assists.\n\nBrandon Jennings scored 21 points and had seven assists for the Bucks, who have lost four straight. They played their third in a row without center Andrew Bogut, who is in Australia attending to personal matters with his family."
