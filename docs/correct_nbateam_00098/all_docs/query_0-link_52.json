        "text": "The newest assistant coach of the Los Angeles Lakers should be plenty familiar to LeBron James and vice versa.\n\nESPN’s Dave McMenamin reported on Saturday that the Lakers have hired former NBA guard John Lucas III to join coach Frank Vogel’s staff. The 38-year-old had a journeyman career, both in the NBA and overseas, before becoming an assistant for the Minnesota Timberwolves in recent years.\n\nYou might also remember Lucas for another reason. He was unfortunately on the receiving end of a memorable James dunk back in 2012. James, who was then with the Miami Heat, jumped cleanly over Lucas, a member of the Chicago Bulls, to convert an alley-oop slam."
