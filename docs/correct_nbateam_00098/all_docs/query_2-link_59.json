The Hawks won 102-93. Mandatory Credit: Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have a myriad of needs to address following a mediocre 2016-17 campaign. Here are my predictions discussing which direction they will go during the offseason.\n\nFrom a totally objective point of view, the 2016-17 Chicago Bulls were an average team at best. The only thing that was consistent about this group during the past year was the level of inconsistency with which they played at.\n\nBut thanks to a very soft schedule down the stretch, the Bulls clinched the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race anyway, thus fooling everyone into thinking they were worthy of a postseason berth.\n\nThe facade continued as they won the first two games of their first round series against the top-seeded Boston Celtics. As is the case with most postseason matchups, as the series progressed, the better team emerged, and the Bulls were eliminated in six games.\n\nNow that the season has ended, the Bulls have several needs that need to be addressed. For starters, the backup point guard spot became an issue of concern after Rajon Rondo missed Games 3-6.\n\nOn top of that, the Bulls do not have a lot of athletic players who can create their own shots. Let's not forget about three-point shooting — a category in which the Bulls finished in the bottom third of the league.\n\nTaking those factors into consideration, will the Bulls stand pat with the roster they have right now, or will there be drastic changes prior to the start of next season?\n\nHere is a look at my five bold offseason predictions.\n\nNov 18, 2015; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Chicago Bulls forward Nikola Mirotic (44) reacts on the court in the NBA game against the Phoenix Suns at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The Bulls won 103-97. Mandatory Credit: Jennifer Stewart-USA TODAY Sports\n\n5. Marriage between Bulls and Nikola Mirotic will continue\n\nSince joining the Bulls back in 2014, Nikola Mirotic's career has been a roller coaster ride of sorts. The good news is he has been a double-digit scorer in each of his three seasons in Chicago.\n\nAt the same time, though, there are long stretches in which Mirotic has little or no impact on the game when he's on the court. In other words — as was the case with Tony Snell — Mirotic is not playing with the kind of consistency the Bulls had hoped for.\n\nTo make matters worse, Mirotic hasn't performed all that well during the postseason either. Back in 2014-15, his averages included 5.7 points and 2.7 rebounds per game on 30 percent shooting from the field.\n\nIn the 2017 NBA Playoffs, Mirotic averaged 8.7 points and 5.0 rebounds per outing, but shot just 34 percent overall and a forgettable 29 percent from beyond the arc. These weren't exactly the kind of numbers the Bulls expected when they acquired his draft rights back in 2011.\n\nAlthough there were reports about the front office fielding offers for Mirotic prior to the trade deadline back in February, the Bulls now seem open to giving him one more opportunity to shine, even if his shooting numbers (41 FG% and 35 3P%) don't indicate that a drastic improvement is on the horizon.\n\nApr 18, 2017; Boston, MA, USA; Chicago Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo (9) is guarded by Boston Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas (4) during the first quarter in game two of the first round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY Sports\n\n4. Bulls have no choice but to bring Rajon Rondo back\n\nRajon Rondo certainly had his fair share of memorable moments during the 2016-17 campaign. First, there was the one-game suspension he was served following a verbal altercation with assistant coach Jim Boylen.\n\nThen, there was the infamous Instagram post in response to Wade and Butler's critical comments about the younger players on the roster after the Bulls coughed a double-digit lead in a 119-114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in late January.\n\nLet's not forget about the fact that he met with the front office about not being satisfied with a reduced role, as well as the five-game stretch in which he was removed from the rotation altogether.\n\nThese events could have soured his attitude and resulted in Rondo potentially distancing himself from his teammates and the coaching staff. Instead, he remained professional for the most part and performed at a high level when he returned to the lineup.\n\nIn those two wins against the Celtics, Rondo posted averages of 11.5 points, 10.0 assists, 8.5 rebounds and 3.5 steals per game. Even more important, the Bulls offense produced 108.5 points per contest.\n\nAfter he went down with an injury towards the end of Game 2, though, the wheels fell of the wagon sort to speak. Not only did the Bulls lose the next four games, they averaged just 90.5 points per outing.\n\nThe lack of production from the other quartet of point guards — along with standing up for his younger teammates — dramatically boosted Rondo's stock within the organization. At this point, it would be shocking if he was not in a Bulls uniform next season.\n\nJan 7, 2017; Chicago, IL, USA; Chicago Bulls guard Dwyane Wade (3) dunks the ball as Toronto Raptors center Lucas Nogueira (92) defends during the second half at the United Center.

Dwyane Wade will pick up second-year option\n\nThe feel-good story from a year ago was the Bulls and Wade agreeing to terms on a two-year deal with $47.5 million. While Wade did play a career-low 29.9 minutes per game this season, his numbers (18.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists per contest) were comparable to his production in his final season as a member of the Miami Heat (19.0 points, 4.6 assists and 4.1 rebounds).\n\nAdditionally, Wade provided Bulls fans with a few memorable moments as well.\n\nNo, Wade's addition to the roster wasn't enough to transform the Bulls into a top-4 team in the conference. At the very least, though, his presence gave Chicago another clutch scorer who is still very capable of taking over in late-game situations.\n\nWade may be on the fence about deciding if he will return next season. However, being that other teams are not likely to offer him more than the $23.8 million currently on the table, it is foreseeable that he picks up his second-year option with the Bulls even if it means playing more minutes with the second unit — something he would not be totally opposed to doing if it's best for the team.\n\nJun 25, 2015; Brooklyn, NY, USA; Bobby Portis (Arkansas) greets NBA commissioner Adam Silver after being selected as the number twenty-two overall pick to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft at Barclays Center.

A year ago, they selected Denzel Valentine out of Michigan State at No. 14.\n\nValentine finished his senior season at MSU with impressive averages of 19.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.5 assists per contest en route to named both AP Player of the Year and Big Ten Player of the Year as well.\n\nUnfortunately, he never found his footing during his rookie campaign with the Bulls largely because of injuries. As a result of being in and out of the rotation, Valentine averaged just 5.7 points per contest on 35 percent shooting from the field.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I discussed five options that may be available for the Bulls with their first selection. If these two players are still on the board, the Bulls should take a hard look at Josh Hart from Villanova or Luke Kennard from Duke.\n\nHart averaged 18.7 points per contest on 51 percent shooting from the field overall and 40 percent from distance. It is also worth noting that Hart converted at least 50 percent of his attempts during his four-year career with the Wildcats.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennard is a capable scorer as well. Following a freshman season in which he averaged 11.8 points per contest, Kennard increased that average to 19.2 points per outing — the second highest mark in the ACC.\n\nIn addition to that, Kennard buried 44 percent of his attempts from beyond the arc. His ability to be a perimeter threat — along with a quick shot release — will make him a difficult cover for opposing teams.\n\nSo again, if the Bulls are looking at grabbing an impact player, these two should be at the top of their list.\n\nApr 16, 2017; Boston, MA, USA; Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler (21) goes to the basket past Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart (36) and center Kelly Olynyk (41) during the third quarter in game one of the first round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs at TD Garden.

During his rookie season, the six-year veteran played just 8.5 minutes while averaging just 2.6 points per contest.\n\nSince that time, however, not only has Butler been the team's top scoring option in each of the last three seasons, he has also become one of the best two-way players in the league. Despite those accomplishments, though, his name has been mentioned in several trade rumors over the past two years.\n\nWhat has made the situation even worse was the unwillingness of the front office to address those rumors. But a day after being non-committal about Butler's long-term future with the Bulls, general manager John Paxson sang a different tune on the subject during a radio interview with ESPN 1000.\n\nTaking those comments into consideration, Paxson is conceding that the higher-ups realize just how much Butler brings to the table.\n\nBeing that he nearly singlehandedly carried the Bulls to the playoffs while posting career-highs across the board, the focus should now shift to putting the right pieces around him rather than exploring various trade scenarios with other teams.\n\nMore from Hoops Habit\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
