You could say he got lucky: Lucas Giolito and Max Fried were underclassmen at the school, and Jack Flaherty soon joined them in the rotation. Or, you could say the pitchers got lucky, as everybody involved in that story has since found glory in the major leagues. Katz’ ascent to the highest level took a bit longer than his three first rounders’ did. As he once put it, “I’ve done every single coaching job there is from the start of high school, except Triple-A.” By the time he got his first big-league assignment in 2019, as an assistant pitching coach with the San Francisco Giants, he was widely seen as a rising star. The White Sox hired him to be their pitching coach after the 2020 season, a position he still holds.\n\nEhsan Bokhari is the Assistant General Manager of the Chicago Cubs. For the Houston Astros, he was previously the Senior Director, Strategic Decision Making, Senior Director of Player Evaluation, and Director of R&D, and entered the baseball industry as Senior Analyst for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In addition to his work in the front office, Turkenkopf has been active in the public analysis space since 2008, writing for Baseball Prospectus, The Hardball Times and Beyond the Box Score. Outside of baseball, Turkenkopf has held positions as senior director of strategic research for Apprenda, a cloud software startup, and as a solutions architect with IBM. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2001 with bachelor’s degrees in economics and mathematics.\n\nKatie Krall is a Senior Product Manager of Baseball Strategy at Hawk-Eye Innovations, a division of Sony Sports Business.

After graduating from Northwestern University, Krall worked for a year and a half at Major League Baseball in the Commissioner’s Office in New York City as a League Economics & Operations Coordinator.

He hopes to grow the college game by using data as a tool for player development and evaluation.\n\n2018 Speakers\n\nOn June 13, 2013, Nate Freiman hit a line drive to left field, becoming just the 20th—and final—major leaguer in history to knock a walk-off base hit against Mariano Rivera. He retired last year with a career 100 OPS+ in the majors, but this lefty-mashing first baseman was anything but average: Besides being, at 6-foot-8, the tallest position player of his era, he is also one of the most inquisitive. The Duke graduate taught himself R and, as he pursues an MBA, is publishing his own research at the FanGraphs Community blog.\n\nDr. Elizabeth (Lizzie) Hibberd, PhD, LAT, ATC is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Science at The University of Alabama. Her research focuses on assessment of shoulder dysfunction using neuromuscular and biomechanical measurement models and injury prevention in overhead athletes.

In order to accomplish this goal, Dr. Hibberd conducts research in overhead athletes of all ages, while emphasizing the dissemination of this research through peer-reviewed publications and presentations, community engagement and interactions with clinicians.​\n\nFernando Perez, the first Latino Ivy-leaguer in MLB history, managed to hitch a ride on Tampa Bay’s first World Series team, which was the highlight of his cafe venti MLB career.

He lives in Northern Virginia with his wife Marilyn (who still wears her pink Sox hat proudly), son Logan (who is very excited by BALL! BALL!

He spent five seasons pitching in the major leagues, most notably with the Kansas City Royals, where he finished third in Rookie of the Year voting in 2007. He was a right-hander with an underwhelming fastball in a sport that lusts for hard-throwers and lefties, and his ability to succeed was attributed as much to his brain (and stubborn perseverance) as to his arm. “He tinkers and analyzes and studies and plots and creates and destroys and invents and experiments,” the writer Joe Posnanski once said of him. By a certain type of baseball fan, Bannister will be remembered as the first ballplaying sabermetrician, a student of advanced statistics who saw information as valuable, not threatening. His public embrace of the brainy side of sports helped bridge the divide between baseball’s jocks and nerds.\n\n2017 Speakers\n\nRick Hahn, who is in his fifth season as the White Sox general manager, has been with the club since October 2000 and helped build the 2005 World Series Champion and 2008 postseason teams.

She earned her law degree at the University of San Francisco and soon after met Don Nomura, who represented Japanese baseball players seeking to play in the major leagues. She used a loophole to help Hideo Nomo sign in the United States and, after Hideki Irabu’s turbulent negotiations with major-league teams, helped create the posting system governing teams’ purchases of Japanese players’ rights. “She was as tough and smart and quick and as unafraid of George (Steinbrenner) as anyone,” Yankees GM Brian Cashman once told the San Francisco Chronicle. “I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to have her on this side of the fence?'” She has been with the Yankees since 2001.\n\nTyler Tumminia Cherington formerly served as Senior Vice President of the Goldklang Group.

In 2014, she was named Top 25 Most Influential Women In Sports, by Bleacher Report and received the Game Changer award by Sports Business Journal as a Female Owner in Baseball.\n\nDr. Glenn Fleisig, Ph.D., grew up in New York as a big baseball fan with an aptitude for math and science. While attending MIT (across the Charles River from this seminar), he discovered the field of sports biomechanics for combining his interests. After graduating from MIT, Fleisig volunteered as a research intern at the U.S. Olympic Training Center, where he met up-and-coming sports medicine doctor Jim Andrews. The two men shared a passion to understand and prevent injuries in baseball and other sports. Fleisig earned graduate degrees from Washington University and UAB. In 1987, Dr. Andrews opened the American Sports Medicine Institute and hired Dr. Fleisig to head up the research. During the past 25 years, Dr. Fleisig has published over 100 scientific articles, worked with thousands of athletes including from 20 Major League Baseball teams, appeared in countless television, print, and online stories, and presented his work all over the world.

He lives in close proximity to the Cascadia Subduction Zone.\n\nEno Sarris has edited children’s books, written about beer, and taken pictures of pitcher’s fingers for a living, so he’s living the dream(s). At his best, he combines ham-fisted analytics and random findings from the liberal arts wing with barely structured interviews on tiny topics.\n\nJason Benetti is a TV play-by-play announcer for ESPN and the Chicago White Sox, currently in his second season with the Sox.

He also provides a regular column featuring PITCHf/x based scouting and analysis. As the founder of Pitch Info and previously a founding partner of Complete Game Consulting, Harry has been providing professional services related to the handling and analysis of baseball tracking data since 2009. Harry is a graduate of Syracuse University with more than fifteen years experience in developing online and mobile applications–for things not even related to baseball, too.\n\nJason Rollison is the co-owner and managing editor of piratesbreakdown.com, an analytics-heavy site and mobile app focused on the Pittsburgh Pirates. In addition to covering the Bucs, Rollison is a featured writer at SB Nation’s Beyond the Box Score, freelances for several newspapers and serves as a beat writer for the State College Spikes.

In this role – newly created by the organization – he is responsible for all baseball matters for the club. A distinguished and experienced baseball executive, Dombrowski arrived in Boston with nearly 40 years of service in Major League Baseball. In addition to his extensive accomplishments relating to on-field baseball performance, Dombrowski has also been involved in areas off the field around the game. In April of 2013, former Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig named him chairman of the Commissioner’s On-Field Diversity Task Force, which addresses the talent pipeline that impacts the representation and development of diverse players and on-field personnel in Major League Baseball, particularly African-Americans.
