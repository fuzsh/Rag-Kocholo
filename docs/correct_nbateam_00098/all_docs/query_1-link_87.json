        "text": "Not all Chicago Bulls fans will remember how beastly Derrick Rose was in his prime. After all, it's been more than 10 years since the hometown hero tore his ACL late in an NBA Playoff game, after which he was never the same again.\n\nBut former Bulls teammate CJ Watson, who played with Rose for two seasons, still remembers how formidable Derrick was on the court â€” and, apparently, some opponents were so intimidated by his athleticism that they even resorted to faking sickness to avoid playing against him.\n\nThe \"Rose Flu\"\n\nIn January 2021, John Lucas III and Gilbert Arenas spoke of the unique sickness called the \"Rose Flu.\" A few years later, Watson confirmed its presence, saying he regularly saw opposing players take the night off whenever Rose was on the schedule.\n\n\"When I signed with Chicago, I've never seen players run from other players or guard certain players. Like Lucas said, having the flu and is supposedly sick because they don't wanna guard D-Rose. It definitely happened; he was playing at an unbelievable clip that year,\" shared Watson.\n\nAnother level\n\nAlready a fantastic player in his first two campaigns, winning Rookie of the Year before becoming an All-Star the following year, the Memphis product took it to a whole new level in his third season.\n\nDuring the 2010-2011 season, Rose averaged superb numbers of 25 points, 4.1 rebounds, 7.7 assists, and 1 steal per game and was later named the regular season MVP, becoming the youngest ever to win the award.\n\nThe Bulls also finished with a 62-20 record and made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in five games.\n\nThough Rose is still in the league, the peak of his career was during this period, as he would suffer injuries that would limit his abilities and ultimately bring an end to his reign as one of the most explosive point guards in the NBA.\n\nDerrick Rose's highlights from these incredible three seasons will live on forever, and he will always be remembered for being a cornerstone of the Bulls' success during those years. He brought an incredible amount of energy and enthusiasm to the court, and his signature athleticism will forever live in the minds of basketball fans everywhere."
