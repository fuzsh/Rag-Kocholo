        "text": "The Houston Rockets are nearing an agreement to hire John Lucas as an assistant on head coach Stephen Silas' staff, sources told The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nLucas has been the head of player development for the Rockets since June 2016. He was reportedly a top candidate to succeed Mike D'Antoni as Houston's head coach before the franchise ultimately hired Silas last week.\n\nThe 67-year-old last worked as a head coach during the 2002-03 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He owns a career 173-258 record across stints with the Cavaliers, Philadelphia 76ers, and San Antonio Spurs. He was also an assistant with the Los Angeles Clippers and Denver Nuggets.\n\nBoth Lucas and his son John Lucas III suited up for the Rockets during their respective playing careers. The elder Lucas was drafted first overall by the franchise in 1976. His son went undrafted in 2005 but spent the first two years of his career with the team before stints at a handful of other clubs, including the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors."
