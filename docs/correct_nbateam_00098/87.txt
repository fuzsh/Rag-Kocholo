The Los Angeles Lakers recently announced the hiring of John Lucas III as an assistant coach on Frank Vogel’s staff, and he has familiarity with some members of the team.

Lucas III played eight seasons in the NBA for six teams, but he had the most success with the Chicago Bulls in 2011-12. In that season, Lucas averaged 7.5 points per game off the bench.

However, he had an encounter in one game against LeBron James and the Miami Heat that has been brought up since the Lakers hired him.

In a game between the Bulls and Heat on Jan. 28, 2012, James climbed the ladder and threw down a seamless dunk on Lucas’ head.

Now that Lucas will be coaching James, Lucas joked on Instagram about that moment:

“Man it just hit me that I will be coaching @kingjames the very man who jumped over me in a game. He going to have to do extra laps in practice for this. 🤣🤣🤣”

Lucas III is expected to help with player development and guide the locker room with his experience, but this will definitely be a moment the team also jokes about in the locker room.
