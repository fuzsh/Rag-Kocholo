Veteran actor SIR Ben Kingsley was flabbergasted when he saw photographs published on the internet proving his ex-wife was having an affair, because he had no suspicions at all.

The 61-year-old actor married ALEXANDRA CHRISTMANN, 30, in October 2003. Their divorce has just been finalised.

And Kingsley admits he was devastated when the images showing German Christmann kissing estate agent SAMMY BRAUNER in a Berlin nightclub whisked around the world in January (05).

He says, "It came at a very vulnerable time for me and I was deeply, deeply shocked because until then I had no idea.

"It's very difficult for a man to learn on the internet that his wife has a boyfriend."
