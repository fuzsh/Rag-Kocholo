Proceeds from the sale of this card benefit The AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\n\t\n\tChameleon-like British actor Sir <b>Ben Kingsley</b> CBE (1943) won more than 25 film awards, including the Best Actor Oscar for <i>Gandhi</i> (1982). He also received Oscar nominations for his roles in <i>Bugsy</i> (1991), <i>Sexy Beast</i> (2001) and <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> (2003).\n\t\n\tBen Kingsley was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England,  in 1943. He grew up in the Pendlebury area of Salford, a borough of Manchester. He is the son of Harji Bhanji, an Indian doctor from Kenya, and Anna Lyna Mary, a model and actress. He later moved to Lancashire. Kingsley started his acting career when he performed regularly as a stage actor at his school, Manchester Grammar School. Kingsley initially followed his father's career aspirations as a chemical laboratory technician, but at the same time joined an amateur theatre company. He finally decided to become an actor after seeing Ian Holm as Richard III in a performance by the Royal Shakespeare Company. He studied at the University of Salford and Pendleton College and appeared in his first theatre productions. After an unsuccessful audition, he adopted his stage name Ben Kingsley at the age of nineteen on the advice of his father, as he suspected that his Indian name might put him at a disadvantage. His subsequent audition was successful. In 1966, he made his London stage debut as the narrator of 'A Smashing Day' produced by The Beatles manager, Brian Epstein. Kingsley wrote the music for the production as well as sang and played guitar. After one performance, John Lennon and Ringo Starr came backstage and told him that he should go into music and that if he didn't, &quot;he would regret it for the rest of his life.&quot; He was subsequently offered a deal by Dick James who handled The Beatles and promised to mould Kingsley into a pop star. He declined James' offer and instead joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1967. He played under Peter Hall and Peter Brook starring roles in such productions as 'As You Like It' (his West End debut for the company at the Aldwych Theatre in 1967), 'Much Ado About Nothing', 'Richard III', 'The Tempest', 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', 'Hamlet' and 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'. Het devoted himself almost exclusively to stage work between 1967 and 1982 but also played a supporting role in the action thriller Fear Is the Key (Michael Tuchner, 1972). It was Kingsley's film debut. He also appeared in smaller roles on television, including a year in the popular soap opera Coronation Street. In 1975, he starred as Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the historical drama The Love School (Piers Haggard, John Glenister,  Robert Knights, 1975) and appeared in the TV miniseries Dickens of London (Michael Ferguson, Marc Miller, 1976). In 1982, the 39-year-old Kingsley became world-famous when he starred in the demanding title role of the biopic Gandhi (Richard Attenborough, 1982). He played Mohandas K. Gandhi between the ages of 23 (in 1893) and 78 (in 1948). Critic Roger Ebert: &quot;This is the sort of rare epic film that spans the decades, that uses the proverbial cast of thousands, and yet follows a human thread from beginning to end: “Gandhi” is no more overwhelmed by the scope of its production than was Gandhi overwhelmed by all the glory of the British Empire.&quot; The film picked up eight Oscars and Kingsley received the Oscar for Best Actor. He also won the BAFTA award and a Grammy for his recording of Gandhi's speeches. \n\t\n\tRefusing to recycle the same roles, Ben Kingsley spent the next decade playing a wide spectrum of characters. Among his more notable parts were an Arab potentate in Harem (Arthur Joffé, 1985), an introverted bibliophile and 'social rebel' in Turtle Diary (John Irvin, 1985), a spy of little import in Pascali's Island (James Dearden, 1988), an incorruptible American vice president in Dave (Ivan Reitman, 1992), and New York gangster Meyer Lansky in Bugsy (Barry Levinson, 1992). He appeared in  Steven Spielberg's Holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993) and Roman Polanski's mystery drama Death and the Maiden (Roman Polanski, 1994) alongside Sigourney Weaver, but also in the comedy Without a Clue (Thom Eberhardt, 1988). In this parody of the Sherlock Holmes films, it is not Sherlock Holmes (played by Michael Caine) but his assistant Dr Watson (played by Kingsley) who turns out to have sleuthing skills. Other roles included the fool in Twelfth Night (Trevor Nunn, 1996) and a brutal gangster in Sexy Beast (Jonathan Glazer, 2000), for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Though Kingsley had retained the variety in his career that he had so diligently pursued, the ever-sharp actor remained as focused as ever heading into the new millennium. In 2001, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for his great achievements in film. He received another Oscar nomination for as Colonel Behrani in House of Sand and Fog (Vadim Perelman, 2003). Then followed the romantic drama Elegy (Isabel Coixet, 2008) with Penélope Cruz, and the adventure film Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (Mike Newell, 2010). He acted twice for Martin Scorsese in the psychological thriller Shutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and in the family film Hugo (Martin Scorsese, 2011), in which he played the film pioneer Georges Méliès alongside Asa Butterfield. Roger Ebert: &quot;Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about — movies. That he also makes it a fable that will be fascinating for (some, not all) children is a measure of what feeling went into it. In broad terms, the story of his hero, Hugo Cabret, is Scorsese's own story.&quot; Kingsley played the villain Trevor Slattery in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in Iron Man 3 (Shane Black, 2013) and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (Destin Daniel Cretton, 2021).  In between, he played the Hebrew slave Nun in Ridley Scott's biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings (Ridley Scott, 2014). Last year, Kingsley appeared in Wes Anderson's The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar (2023), a film adaptation of a short story by Roald Dahl, and starred opposite Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel and Benedict Cumberbatch. Ben Kingsley has been married four times and he has four children, Thomas and Jasmine Bhanji by actress Angela Morant, his first wife, and Edmund and Ferdinand Kingsley by director Alison Sutcliffe, his second wife. The latter two are both also actors. In 2005, Kingsley divorced German Alexandra Christman; since 2007, he has been married to Brazilian actress Daniela Lavender. These days, Sir Ben lives in the English town of Spelsbury.\n\t\n\tSources: Roger Ebert (RogerEbert.com), AllMovie, Wikipedia (Dutch, German and English) and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
