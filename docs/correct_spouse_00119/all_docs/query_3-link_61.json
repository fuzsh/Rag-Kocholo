        "text": "Sir Ben Kingsley, CBE, (born December 31, 1943) is a British actor. He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi in Richard Attenborough’s 1982 film Gandhi, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n\n1.2 Film and television career\n\n1.3 Honours\n\n1.4 Personal life\n\n2 Filmography\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nKingsley was born Krishna Bhanji in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, the son of Ann Lyna Mary (née Goodman), an actress and model, and Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji, a medical doctor.[1] Kingsley’s father, an Ismaili Muslim,[2] was born in Kenya of Indian Khoja Gujarati descent, as Kingsley’s paternal grandfather was a spice trader who had moved from India to Zanzibar, where Kingsley’s father lived until moving to England at the age of fourteen.[3][4][5] Kingsley’s mother, born out-of-wedlock, was “loath to speak of her background”; she was of partial Russian Jewish descent, though Kingsley has said that he is “not absolutely certain” about his maternal ancestry.[6][7] Kingsley grew up in Pendlebury, Salford, where he studied at University of Salford. He then moved to Lancashire, where he studied at Pendleton College, which later became home to the Ben Kingsley Theatre.\n\nKingsley began his acting career on the stage at Manchester Grammar School, alongside Robert Powell, but made a transition to film roles early on. Despite this focus on film, he continued to act on the stage, playing Mosca in Peter Hall’s 1977 production of Ben Jonson’s Volpone for the Royal National Theatre. It was at this time in his life that he changed his name from Krishna Bhanji to Ben Kingsley, fearing that a foreign name would hamper his career.[8]\n\nFilm and television career\n\nKingsley’s first film role was a supporting turn in Fear Is the Key, released in 1972. Kingsley continued starring in bit roles in both film and television, including a bit part on the soap opera Coronation Street and regular appearances as a defence counsel in the long-running British legal programme Crown Court. He found fame only years later, starring as Mohandas Gandhi in the Academy Award-winning film Gandhi in 1982, his best-known role to date. Kingsley was critically acclaimed; the majority of film critics were agreed in their scepticism that no other actor could have acted out the role with any conviction. [citation needed] The audiences were agreed with the critics, and Gandhi was an unqualified box-office success. The AMPAS was agreed with the critics and the audiences, and Kingsley won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal.\n\nKingsley deftly avoided typecasting and, in his on-screen appearances, acted in a variety of roles. His credits included the films Turtle Diary, Maurice, Pascali’s Island, Without a Clue (as Dr. Watson alongside Michael Caine’s Sherlock Holmes, Suspect Zero, Bugsy–which led to an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Sneakers, Dave, Searching for Bobby Fischer, Schindler’s List, Silas Marner, Death and the Maiden, Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story, Sexy Beast, for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and House of Sand and Fog, which led to yet another Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He won a Crystal Globe award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2001.\n\nIn 1997, he provided voice talent for the video game Ceremony of Innocence. In July 2006, he received an Emmy nomination for his performance in the made-for-TV film Mrs. Harris, in which he impersonated famed cardiologist Herman Tarnower, who was murdered by his jilted lover, Jean Harris. In 2007, Kingsley appeared as a Polish American mobster in the Mafia comedy You Kill Me, and was also slated to act out a Middle East oil minister to be assassinated in War, Inc.. An Indian Express story reported that Kingsley would appear as the sex guru Osho in a film, of then-unknown title, due to be released in 2008.[9] In August 2007, it was rumoured that he will play the role of Davros, creator of the Daleks in the 2008 season of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who.[10] The BBC has yet to confirm or deny this.\n\nHonours\n\nKingsley was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000. He was knighted in the 2001 New Years Honours list. On promotional material for the 2006 film Lucky Number Slevin, Kingsley was referred to as “Sir Ben Kingsley.” At first, the actor was singled out for some criticism, as such titles had generally come to be omitted from professional credits by that time. It was claimed that the inclusion of “Sir” was a mistake by a studio executive.\n\nPersonal life\n\nKingsley had four children as of the summer of 2007: Thomas Bhanji and Jasmine Bhanji by actress Angela Morant, and Edmund Kingsley and Ferdinand Kingsley by theatrical director Alison Sutcliffe, both of whom became actors themselves. In 2005 he divorced German-born Alexandra Christmann, after pictures of her kissing another lover surfaced on the internet.[11]\n\nHe currently lives in Spelsbury, England, where he has lived for over ten years.[12]\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Title Role Notes\n\n1982 Gandhi Mohandas Gandhi Academy Award Win for Best Actor\n\n1983 Betrayal Robert the film version of Harold Pinter’s play\n\n1985 Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe Silas Marner\n\nHarem Selim\n\n1986 Turtle Diary William Snow screenplay by Harold Pinter\n\n1987 The Secret of the Sahara (TV) Sholomon\n\nMaurice Lasker-Jones\n\n1988 Pascali’s Island Basil Pascali\n\nWithout a Clue Dr. John Watson\n\nTestimony – The Story of Shostakovich Dmitri Shostakovich\n\n1989 Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story Simon Wiesenthal\n\n1990 The 5th Monkey Cunda\n\n1991 Bugsy Meyer Lansky Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor\n\n1992 Sneakers Cosmo\n\n1993 Searching for Bobby Fischer Bruce Pandolfini\n\nDave Vice President Nance\n\nSchindler’s List Itzhak Stern\n\n1994 Death and the Maiden Dr. Roberto Miranda\n\n1995 Species Xavier Fitch\n\nJoseph Potiphar\n\n1996 Twelfth Night Feste from the play by William Shakespeare\n\n1997 Weapons Of Mass Distraction (TV) Julian Messenger\n\nThe Assignment Amos\n\n1999 Alice in Wonderland (TV) Major Caterpillar\n\nThe Confession Harry Fertig\n\n2000 What Planet Are YOU From?
