        "text": "Linda Joy Christman Voorhies, 67, passed away December 15, 2021 at Logan Health in Kalispell. She was born on April 23, 1954 in Longview, Washington to Patricia and Walter Christman. They resided there for 6 months before moving to Libby, Montana. She then later moved to Troy, Mont. To her that was home.\n\nShe married Mike Voorhies in Feb 27, 1971 in Troy, Montana and married for 50 years. She was preceded in death by her mother Patricia Elizabeth Hurley Christmas and her father Walter Charles Christman.\n\nShe gave birth to two lights of her life Alena Gay Voorhies Gostnell (Joe Gostnell) and Cory Alen Voorhies (Elizabeth Dotson Voorhies); 5 grandchildren: Ashley Taylor Gostnell, Mathew Brandon Gostnell, Hannah Katlyn Gostnell, Alexandra Swan Voorhies and Dominic Wayne Voorhies. She loved them all with all her heart. Linda was one of five sisters Geneva LaCount, Sue Duve, Karen Horton and Lori Camprose. When they would all get together it was laughter, food and games until your belly hurt.\n\nThere will be a spreading of her ashes on the farm this spring. It is the place she always wanted to be. Arrangements are by Schnackenberg Funeral Home in Libby. Online condolences and memories may be shared at www.schnackenbergfh.com."
