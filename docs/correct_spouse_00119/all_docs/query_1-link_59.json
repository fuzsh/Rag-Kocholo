        "text": "Superstar actor Ben Kingsley has a bit of a reputation for pomposity and it’s ringing more than faintly true. It’s rumoured that on set he demands to be called “Sir Ben” and his fellow knight of the realm Jonathan Miller once said he was “a little twerp” because of his fondness for his title.\n\nHe’s not helping his case with lines such as: “I do have wonderful companions amongst the same society of knights – and they are philanthropic, generous, intelligent, outward looking, dignified, chivalrous people. To keep that kind of company is quite wonderful.”\n\nBut the actor who made his name in 1982 in the late Lord Attenborough’s Oscar-winning blockbuster Gandhi, says there is a poignant reason he treasures the knighthood he won in 2002.\n\nIt made him feel loved and accepted in a way his own mother, actress and model Anna Goodman, never did. In fact their relationship was so strained he says that rather than feel pride towards him, she felt only jealousy.\n\n“My mother refused to acknowledge my knighthood, which I found bitterly hurtful,” says Sir Ben, 69.\n\n“The wonderful woman who is the Queen and who is almost like a mum had said, ‘We accept you and love what you do’. But my mother refused to acknowledge it had taken place. She was embarrassed and bitter and jealous.”\n\nHe adds: “She had a circuit missing and that made her distant and somewhat baffled by her four children, two girls and two boys. Thinking perhaps it would all go away. Adulthood? Whoa. She couldn’t handle it.”\n\nHis pride in his knighthood was also heightened by the “steady stream” of racism he suffered over the years.\n\nSir Ben was born Krishna Bhanji in the East Riding of Yorkshire, son of a Kenyan-born doctor of Indian descent who moved to the UK to study medicine. His “smoking, drinking” father died aged 54 and his mother at 96 in 2010.\n\nHe has said: “I know that people think I’m prone to pomposity and isolation. But I am hugely fragile, which goes back to my past. I’ve always been proud of the title, but I’ve learnt to be quietly proud. I think it’s a reflection of how an uncomfortable childhood can lead to high achievement. I hope it will inspire other people. Racism, in any form, is f***ing awful.”\n\nFor Sir Ben, his knighthood was the “embrace” he never got from his mother or society. And every detail of the official letter and the ceremony still burns brightly in his memory.\n\n“I was completely surprised,” he says. “The phrase used is, ‘It has been decided that you should be dignified by the title of Knighthood’.\n\n“So it’s quite a lot to live up to and one mustn’t trivialise it.\n\n“When Her Majesty knighted me, the sword that she used was the one that her father wore ceremonially as Commander in Chief of the British Forces during World War II. I was aware how much she loved her father so I found had huge resonance.\n\n“We chatted very briefly about what was happening in my life and I left the Palace feeling embraced. But my mother, far from being proud, was very jealous of my success.”\n\n“The whole phenomenon of the knighthood is a very strangely English thing. On the one hand you have a total indifference to, almost con­tempt for, success. Destroying and lamp­ooning successful personalities and politicians is very much part of the English approach.\n\n“But at the other end of the scale... the government and the Queen say, ‘We rather like you’, so there’s the most ­delicious balance.”\n\nGandhi director Lord Attenborough, who died last month, was one of Sir Ben’s true friends. “He placed in me an absolute trust and in turn I placed an absolute trust in him and grew to love him,” he said afterwards. “I, along with millions of others whom he touched through his life and work, will miss him dearly.”\n\nIt was his mesmerising role as Gandhi that won him the Oscar for best actor and propelled Sir Ben into the A-list.\n\nAfter he went to Manchester Grammar School his family had wanted him to be a doctor. But he began to get other ideas after a visit to the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford. He failed to get into elite drama college RADA but won a job with a professional company.\n\nThen in 1966 he took up a part in Coronation Street, playing Ron Jenkins, who had a fling with Ken Barlow’s first wife Val.\n\n“Coronation Street takes place in Salford and I was brought up five miles from there and it’s very much in my background and my territory, so to be part of that iconic series very early on in my career was wonderful,” he says.\n\n“It was like live theatre. We ran from one part of the studio to the other to keep the tapes rolling. We had huge great cameras and great big thick tapes. Quite marvellous.”\n\nWithin a year he was invited to join the RSC and changed his name to Ben Kingsley, fearing that his Asian real name would hinder his career.\n\nHis film debut came in a a small role in 1972’s Fear Is The Key and over the next 40 years he won the Oscar as well as a Grammy, BAFTA, and two Golden Globes while starring in movies as diverse as Bugsy, Schindler’s List and Sexy Beast.\n\nHis personal life has been no less action-packed. Sir Ben lives in a country mansion in Oxfordshire with fourth wife Daniela Barbosa de Carneiro, 40, from Brazil. His first marriage to actress Angela Morant ended in 1972 after 10 years and two children together.\n\nNext he married theatre director Alison Sutcliffe and had two sons, but he left her in 1993 for actress Kate Townsend. And in 2002 he fell for the blonde German socialite Alexandra Christmann and installed her at his manor house. They were married in 2003 but separated after 15 months.\n\nBut Sir Ben appears close to his children, three of whom are also actors.\n\nUnlike his own mum, he says he couldn’t be prouder of them. He says: “When they finish a piece of work and I’m in the same building, their ribs are in danger of being crushed.”\n\nSir Ben has seven films in the pipeline, the most recent of which is an animation called The Boxtrolls. He voices the villain, Archibald Snatcher.\n\nHe has admitted he “nodded off occasionally” during filming – but explains there was a good reason for it. “I did most of my recordings lying down on a sofa bed – I wanted his voice to come from his belly,” he has said.\n\nHe is currently filming a new version of The Jungle Book, providing\n\nthe voice of the panther Bagheera.\n\nIt all goes to show, he insists, that despite the rather high-falutin’ company he keeps, he’s not above a bit of fun.\n\n“I don’t live in that serious actor bubble. It’s a myth,” he says. “I am called a serious actor and I don’t quite know what it means.\n\n“But it’s just a beautiful, joyful privileged position to be in this profession.”"
