        "text": "Posh-voiced, Shakespeare-trained Ben Kingsley is describing his creative process, which, it turns out, involves accessorizing. When the 66-year-old Oscar winner takes on a role, he often insists on handpicking his character’s wardrobe — down to the shoes.\n\nThat may be one reason why the venerable Sir Ben — he was knighted for his acting chops — has such an uncanny knack for embodying wide-ranging characters from head-to-toe.\n\n“It’s like painting a portrait of somebody. I always start from the inside and then the outer skin starts to appear,’’ the affable Kingsley says in his upper-crust British accent.\n\nLong before filming began on Martin Scorsese’s gothic thriller “Shutter Island,” Kingsley figured out the “outer skin” of his Dr. Cawley, the eerily enigmatic psychiatrist who harbors secrets when two U.S. marshals (Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) come looking for an escaped murderess at a mental hospital for the criminally insane.\n\nSure, with all the macabre madness and gore, moviegoers might not realize that Kingsley took great pains to give Cawley an “affable silhouette” — an olive green tweed suit (“it’s a very benign look”), bow tie (“a little tiny touch of narcissism”), gold signet ring (“as if he were affiliated with some special club”), a pipe whose smoke adds to the mystery when it enshrouds Cawley (“Marty loved that pipe”), and brown leather Oxford brogues meant to convey the shrink is well-grounded. Kingsley’s footwear barely gets screen time, but soles are crucial in his elaborate world of pretend.\n\n“See, when I’m acting, if I glance down at my feet behind my desk or hear the sound they make on those prison corridors, it’s very important,’’ Kingsley explains. “I don’t want to glance down and see sneakers — it’ll just destroy it for me.”\n\nWhile he’s on the self-costuming topic, he “loved those tight gray trousers” and “almost military boots” he had a designer round up for his Oscar-nominated turn as a vicious gangster in “Sexy Beast.” And when the four-time-married Kingsley portrayed a sex-crazed professor in “Elegy,” he recalls nixing the producer’s idea for his wardrobe (“I said, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no!’”) and instead chose outfits similar to those that hung in his closet at home.\n\n“And when I played ‘Gandhi,’ I decided to wear big diapers and a sheet,’’ he says with gravitas. Then he bursts into laughter.\n\nKingsley grabbed an Oscar in 1982 for channeling the famed nonviolent Indian leader, a breakthrough performance that launched his prolific film career and led to three more Academy Award nods (supporting actor nominations for “Bugsy” and “Sexy Beast,” best actor nomination for “House of Sand and Fog”).\n\nThe dark plot of “Shutter Island” intertwines Cold War paranoia, hurricane-force rain and “therapeutic” lobotomies at a fortresslike mental asylum. “Absolutely exhausting,” Kingsley delightedly says of the shoot. Oddly, he predicts the audience will find it “ultimately a healing film.”\n\nEarly on, to help the cast understand his vision, Scorsese had the actors watch select black-and-white films from the ’40s and ’50s “to look at the body language, the costumes, the sets, the lighting, the rhythm of how people spoke and interacted,” Kingsley says. The Academy Award-winning director also screened the harrowing 1967 documentary “Titicut Follies,” which exposed inmate-patients stripped naked, chained to walls, and left in their own feces at the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane in Massachusetts.\n\nKingsley’s character is loosely based on noted psychiatrist James Gilligan, who as a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty, led efforts to reform the Massachusetts institution. An expert on the violent mentally ill, Gilligan acted as a psychiatric adviser on “Shutter Island.”\n\n“His presence there was an enormous help. He didn’t say a lot unless he was asked and then he’d give very modest, loving answers,’’ says Kingsley, over the phone from New York. “Dr. Gilligan took 25 years with one patient to get that patient to speak. Absolute dedication. So once you reduce it to that — and I always like to reduce a character so I can have a phrase I can put in my pocket.”\n\nBesides having a handy slogan that sums up his character, Kingsley’s acting secret is simple, whether he’s morphing into a legendary mob boss in “Bugsy,” a Jewish accountant in “Schindler’s List,” or a goofy cross-eyed spiritualist in “The Love Guru.”\n\nBefore every take, “I go to zero. Then I’m ready to receive all the energy of the set, the lighting, especially completely open to the other actors, uncluttered, no preconceptions, know my dialogue backwards. I find that a very gratifying and joyful way to work.”\n\nHis marquee dreams date back to when he was 5 years old and captivated by a movie featuring a boy who strongly resembled him. “I decided it was me and I decided I was also being followed around by a film crew everywhere I went,” he muses.\n\nIn those days, the native Brit went by his birth name: Krishna Bhanji. His father was a Kenyan-born physician of Indian descent and his mother, an English actress. Later, at the urging of his dad, who thought an Anglo-sounding name might open audition doors, Krishna Bhanji became Ben Kingsley. The last name comes from his paternal grandfather, a Zanzibar spice trader known as the “Clove King.”\n\nHard to imagine, but the bald thespian might’ve been a rock ’n’ roller had he not joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967. Months earlier, after making his stage debut in a musical produced by Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein, he was urged by John Lennon and Ringo Starr to pursue a singing career. But Kingsley says he “found Shakespeare when done properly is utterly thrilling” and never looked back.\n\n“I’m still alive. If I had been a rock star in the ’60s, I might be a ghost pacing around the hotel room now.”\n\nWhen not on the road, the father of four grown children (two are stage actors in Britain) prefers to putter around his English countryside manor. “The domestic nourishing things of life for me are the best way to enjoy my time. It would include cooking something and spending a lot of time with my wonderful wife.”\n\nHe’s referring to his fourth bride, the Brazilian-born Daniela Barbosa de Carneiro. Thirty years his junior, she was a part-time actress when they wed in 2007. That was two years after he divorced his third wife, German socialite Alexandra Christmann, after seeing photos on the Internet of her kissing another man.\n\nAsked how he and the latest Lady Kingsley like to relax, Sir Ben playfully replies, “I’m not telling you.” Then he demurs, “We love each other. She’s great.”\n\nHis time at the homestead, however, is limited. He’s a workhorse — this month he also appears as a genius mathematician in the Bollywood movie “Teen Patti,” and in May, he’ll be seen as the evil ruler in the fantasy epic “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.” He’s also trying to raise money for “Taj,” a pet project that would have him back in India playing the 17th century emperor who erected the Taj Mahal.“It’s perfect as a building, therefore it must’ve been built by an obsessive perfectionist. I want to explore that portrait of that man,” says the international star, who, from head-to-toe, could also be called obsessive about his craft."
