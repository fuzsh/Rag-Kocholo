        "text": "After more than four decades in the entertainment industry, we wouldn’t be entirely wrong in calling Ben Kingsley a legend at his best. Since joining the company, he has given his best in every role he has been in, earning multiple awards and nominations for his efforts. He had blown his trumpet after being featured in the film, Gandhi (1982). There is more to this amazing actor, read the article below for more details.\n\nBen Kingsley’s Bio (Ethnicity)\n\nHis success in the entertainment world can be largely attributed to his family’s deep foundation in the film industry. Ben Kingsley was born into a family that understood the ins and outs of the entertainment industry. His mother was the famous drama queen Anna Lyna Mary, whose days on Earth were dedicated to her acting and modeling career. Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji worked as a doctor in the health sector on his father’s side. Tracing Ben’s ethnicity was one such work. His mother was forbidden to speak of her roots because she was born illegitimate while his father is of Gujarat descent and a native Kenyan. In addition, we established that his parental home is related to a Russian-Jewish descent.\n\nBorn on December 31, 1943, Ben spent his early childhood days in Pendlebury. He was a scholar at Manchester Grammar School and Pendleton College. However, he graduated from De La Salle College after joining from Pendelton. At De La Salle College, he began promoting his acting career while on the school team. Even as a beginner he impressed his audience.\n\nFew know that Ben Kingsley was originally born as Krishna Bhanji. He adopted the former because he never wanted anything, including his background, to stunt his growth in showbiz. After graduating from college, he turned his passion into his own boss and began organizing various plays and stage works exclusively for fifteen years. He later created his first theatrical stage named Broadway , launched in 1971. That same year he had a role in the comedy, Volpone and A Midsummer Night ‘s Dream .\n\nBen Kingsley had acted in a number of drama series and played roles in films. Later in 1982, he made one of the standout performances in the film, Death of a Salesman . He starred in the film Fear is the Key (1972), meanwhile he still played perfect roles in drama series. Despite all his works, the actor had to wait until he appeared as Mohandas Gandhi in the film, Gandhi (1982) to get the worldwide recognition he deserved. The film won the Oscar that year and named him best actor of the year."
