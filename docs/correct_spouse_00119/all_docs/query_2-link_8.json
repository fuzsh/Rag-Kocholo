        "text": "Sir Ben Kingsley has a reputation both for terminal luvviness - a dreadful condition that is apt to make me titter - and for being clam-like in interviews. So, not exactly my dream date. Then again, to use a bit of theatre parlance myself, I do love the work. He is an amazing actor, of this there can be no doubt. To see Kingsley in action is not to watch a performance; rather, it is as if he simply became the person he was asked to play long before the camera began to roll. Acting can be embarrassing: the self-consciousness, the mannerisms, the tics. But he has an unnerving, ready-made quality that makes pretty much anyone who happens to be standing next to him look as if they're in the middle of a drama school audition. I am a fan, then. The trouble is that this, too, fills me with a feeling of doom. The greater the actor, the more you wonder if there is anyone inside. Who is Ben Kingsley? No one who has written about him seems to know.\n\nWhen we meet in the set of draughty Soho rooms where he is to have his picture taken, I confront him with all this, straight off. All right, not the luvvie bit. Nor the empty-vessel bit. But I do suggest that he doesn't like interviews, which might make the next hour seem rather long for both of us. He stares at me, a gaze of lover-like intensity, then his beady eyes widen, all innocence. He looks like a meerkat about to dart down a hole. \"Where on earth did you hear that?\" he says. \"Forgive me, but it is all a matter of perception. It may be that, erm, I deliberately chose a kind of reticence or reluctance because I feel that you can only give information to a person that they're capable of computing or dealing with.\" So it's all down to the interviewer: to how sympathetic they are, or how clever? He nods at me encouragingly. \"Totally. Between you and me, I enjoy the process very much. Which is not to say that I like every interview, or that I don't sometimes have to say: 'Whoa! I'm on the back foot here.'\" We grin at each other. Charity oozes from our pores. I feel optimistic. Is the clam preparing to open?\n\nKingsley is promoting a new movie, Fifty Dead Men Walking, in which he plays a British Special Branch officer in 1980s Belfast. The film is based on the book of the same name by Martin McGartland, a former IRA informer. McGartland is played with wide-boy aplomb by Jim Sturgess; Kingsley is his handler, Fergus, a reticent Lancashireman who, in the absence of his own son, to whom he no longer talks, comes to feel unexpectedly paternal about his young, paid sneak. On paper, this sounds suspiciously sentimental; on screen, it is anything but. The film is very violent, with several long torture scenes. When I watched it, I spent a lot of time with my eyes closed. And then there is Kingsley, who turns in a performance so stubbornly low-key that he renders Fergus almost invisible - an incredibly brave thing for an actor to do. \"Yes, invisible,\" says Kingsley, solemnly. \"My wife said that. 'Baba!' she said. 'You've made him invisible.' But that is what he is; that is what he has to be.\" Baba? Oh dear. But anyway... Did it feel courageous, making Fergus so very quiet? The risk is that one's work might not be noticed. He says not. \"What I despise is when I read scripts, and it says: 'Enter Derek' and then in brackets: 'You gotta love this guy.' I'm not interested in the audience finding me likable. Gandhi is extremely un-likable. A fucking stubborn bugger. David Kapesh [his character, a philandering academic, in Elegy, from the novel by Philip Roth], he won't suffer fools. I want my character to be seen, understood, not loved.\" Still, a lot of actors - most, probably - long to be loved; that's why they became actors in the first place. \"You may be right. But I don't want having to love me getting in the way of my story.\"\n\nKingsley has long been marked out by his willingness to work with relatively inexperienced, even first-time, directors (Jonathan Glazer, who made Sexy Beast, in which Kingsley played the maniacal Don Logan, was a first-time director; as was Vadim Perelman, who directed House of Sand and Fog; both films earned Kingsley Oscar nominations). Kari Skogland, director and writer of Fifty Dead Men Walking, now joins this line-up. This is not her first feature, but still, she is not exactly a household name. So how does Kingsley know which offers to accept? What is the secret of his often excellent judgment? \"Well, she came to me, and I realised: my goodness, you're a warrior. Kari is an equal. It's good to work with equals, but equals can take many forms. If you're lucky, the world will say: your equal is over there. In an unlikely place. It's a risk, but thank God you're taking it with an equal.\" So it's merely intuition then? \"Yes. Though many of our intuitive faculties can be buried for life unless opportunity brings them to the fore. We have this saying: I didn't know I had it in me. And it is literally in you. Acting has put me in touch with intuition.\" Does it work the other way? Can he tell when a person is rubbish? \"Yes.\" His expression, hitherto brightly animated, now moves into more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger. \"And I still did the job. And it was awful. Awful. But an actor has to keep working. I've got many dependants. There has to be cash flow going towards Ben! Sometimes it was irresponsible not to take the money, but the director was a dog. A dog.\" Though he will not give me names, I am guessing that the directors of Thunderbirds and The Love Guru might well be down among the canines.\n\nBy now it is clear that, at least in part, Sir Ben certainly does live up to his reputation. Actors despise the word luvvie, but it works for him whether he likes it or not: the breathless, over-delicate delivery; the passion for euphemism and talking in riddles; the grandness; the habit of referring to himself in the third person. When we discuss his success, he immediately attributes it to - who else? - Shakespeare. \"It is dependent on my versatility, and that was born of the challenges of [my time at] the Royal Shakespeare Company: day after day, week after week, year after year, going through the canon of that glorious man's work.\" And yet, as one of his screenwriters might put it: you've got to love him. Who knows why, but his silliness and self-regard only endear him to me. At least he cares, even if it is hard to buy his idea that actors are sages delivered to us by some higher power that we might learn by their example: \"There's a communality between us. If we lose sight of it, it will leave us limping; if we keep it in sight, it will nourish our soul. That's what I would call our tribal mythology. And if our mythology is hijacked by the advertising industry, trivialised in order to sell something, rather than to teach something, we're fucked. The young are not a market to whom you sell commodities, but a seedbed to whom you say: have you heard this? Thank God my boys [his two younger sons, Edmund and Ferdinand]... one went to Rada, the other is at Guildhall, and it's completely sustaining. They both have a love of myth, and a completely uninhibited love of Shakespeare.\"\n\nWhat can it be like, I wonder, being the son of Ben Kingsley, and an actor? \"That is a question you would have to put to my lads. We have the most lovely conversations, when appropriate, about work. People who share the same myth are people who probably couldn't go to war.\" Really? Surely the opposite is true. \"Well, they see how much joy it brings me.\" So would he say that acting has made him happy? Not exactly. \"It has given me voice. We are, by nature, expressive human beings. To be unexpressed is the road to unhappiness. It has been a long and wonderful journey towards being in this room and being able to say yes, but it is not that simple. Creative people are making a pearl. What's in the middle of that pearl? Something that's really scratching it. A grain of sand, and it has to cover it, to smooth it. We all have our grain of sand, and we find a way of smoothing it.\" He'd better tell me all about these grains of sand then. But no. He raises one hand feebly. \"Oh, I can't. They are born of my childhood, and my experiences, and there are people alive who mustn't have them discussed in public.\" So they're ancient? \"They are. But you find yourself repeating patterns of behaviour until the gods say to you: 'We will not tolerate you doing this any more.' And something happens. The gods send us things if we are open and on a journey towards healing. But it can be a jolly long slog. I've had moments of immense joy with work, and then gone back to personal chaos. I will leave it at that.\"\n\nThis, I am guessing, is a veiled description of his somewhat complicated private life. Kingsley has been married four times. His first marriage, to actor Angela Morant, with whom he had a son and a daughter, lasted for 10 years; his second, to the director Alison Sutcliffe, the mother of Ferdy and Ed, lasted for 14. In 2003 he married Alexandra Christmann, a German ad executive, only to divorce her two years later after seeing pictures of her kissing a younger man on the internet (Kingsley had wooed Christmann by text message; at the time he was living with someone else). And now there is \"an ancient mythological princess\", Lady Kingsley, aka Daniela Barbosa de Carneiro, a Brazilian-born actor and former waitress; they \"connected\" in Hollywood and married in 2007 at his Oxfordshire home. She is 30 years his junior. So I have to ask: was it to her that he was referring when he talked of equals? Another look. This one says: naughty! \"If I could just briefly say: she's totally an equal, and she makes me feel really safe, and I hope I make her feel safe. And adventurous. It's level. Of course, it's male-female, too, but the fulcrum about which it rocks is level.\"\n\nI suppose this means that she gives as good as she gets? Or maybe not. We now arrive at a \"whoa!\" moment. \"Erm, I think... I'm really struggling, talking about my personal life. Will you forgive me?\" He emits a theatrical splutter - Romeo sucking on a draught of poison - and frantically reaches for a Fisherman's Friend, one of a range of throat-related products he has ready in a Ziploc bag. \"There was a full stop way back there,\" he says, sucking hard. \"Equals! Whatever you make of the word equal.\" I try to placate him. All I meant was that, as he is in his 60s, she might find him a little... set in his ways. \"Oh no. It's in constant flux, Rachel. It can't be set. The play has got to remain movable... I can't do anything with a play that is dehydrated and brittle. It has to remain plastic.\n\nI've chosen a way of life that makes that imperative. A painter can't always put yellow next to magenta. Sometimes it has to go next to blue.\" Will this marriage last? \"Yes. And now you're peeling off the layers with great skill.\" Hardly. And why does he sound so solemn? Why is he practically whispering? \"Because it's a very serious question you've asked, Rachel dear, so I'm giving you a serious answer.\"\n\nBen Kingsley was born Krishna Bhanji in Scarborough in 1943. His father, Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji, was a doctor; his mother, Anna Lyna Mary, was an actress and model, and Ben attended Manchester Grammar School expecting that he would go to medical school like his father and older brother. \"Out of four children, the child has to find his ecological corner, and usually it's what is left by the others.\" MGS is notoriously academic and competitive. Did that suit him? \"I was a bit uncomfortable because I realised, too late, that I had chosen the wrong course. I only scraped through the sixth form.\" What was his ecological corner, then? \"I was the song-and-dance man. Keep 'em smiling. Keep 'em happy. Danny Kaye.\" Were his parents worried when he decided to become an actor? \"'This acting lark,' my father used to say. Though I think they were just posturing as parents.\" His father is dead. But his mother must be proud of him now. \"I haven't a clue. You can't... you can't go there.\" But I only asked if his mother was proud of him. \"Yes.\" What about his siblings? \"I don't think we can go there. It's part of the grain of sand.\" I see. And will he ever talk about this stuff? \"I doubt it. But it will be in my work. It's fully expressed in my work. Schindler's List [in which he played Schindler's accountant, Itzhak Stern]... How did you know about that degree of suffering? Well, I did. It cannot be expressed without creative translation.\" So I can take it his childhood was not happy? \"It would be fair to say that. What lies behind that, I leave to anyone who has their own struggle. If you dam up the creative impulse, you can have a mad person on your hands. It has to be expressed. If I wasn't acting, I dread to think what state I would be in.\"\n\nKingsley did not go to drama school, though he did audition for Rada. Instead he joined a Theatre in Education group. \"At 16, plodding through A-levels, me and my friend Bruce went to a party and held 50 people in a room utterly spellbound with our improvisation. It was so empowering. No one telling me: 'Sshhh!' I hate the interruption of children. You never know what delicate molecules are lining themselves up as a gift to the future. But later I joined an amateur dramatic society, the Salford Players, and one of the ladies, Irene, a strange white witch, said [adopts perfect Mancunian]: 'You've got to go professional.' She had a copy of Stage and Television Today, and she had drawn a circle round an ad: 'Young actors wanted for TIE tour'.\" Off he went. \"We were like paratroopers.\" Eventually he joined the RSC, and in 1980, when Kingsley was 36 and appearing in a production of Nicholas Nickleby, Richard Attenborough asked him to screen-test for Gandhi. He won an Oscar for the role, became internationally famous, and has only once returned to the stage since. Would he have kept going as an actor had this amazing thing not happened? \"Impossible to answer. Probably. I can't divorce my ambition as a young actor from where it got me.\" But he must enjoy being a star. \"Well, I really like being me, and I don't mean that in a complacent way. Loads of stuff needs fixing and altering - the lump of clay that is me. But I daren't go back [into the past] and fiddle with anything.\"\n\nWhy, I wonder, does he think that film suits him so well? On this subject, at least, he makes (almost) perfect sense. \"I know that the camera is interested in behaviour and allergic to acting. Film allows me to recognise characters in a way that a portrait painter might. Whereas the stage is like landscape painting - four hours of Nicholas Nickleby, and you were just a shrub. Once I have that recognition, I have that urgency: I want to share it, and that helps me not to end up auditioning in front of the camera - and we have to stop auditioning as actors. God has given us the role of actor on earth, and it's a beautiful role, and thank you - but now stop auditioning, boys and girls.\" And when he looks in the mirror, what does he see? \"Stubble.\" Yeah, right. I make a face. \"Seriously. When I arrive at work, I sit with Ann [his make-up artist] and I close my eyes, and I go under. She doesn't talk. I open my eyes. I glance in the mirror, I see my character, and then I walk away, and my face is changing. I don't pull faces; my face changes. Something inside needs to be expressed.\"\n\nAll this time - we are approaching the end of our hour together - I have avoided addressing Kingsley by name. I am not the kind of person who uses titles - I'm practically Cherie Blair! - and I have read the story about how, once, he insisted that he always be referred to as Sir Ben Kingsley, even on a movie poster (even fellow actors hooted at this). I realise that I cannot let him go without asking him about it. So I do. Hmm. On the one hand, he is moderately embarrassed about that little episode, if a little too plaintive. \"It didn't come from me,\" he says. \"I'm the victim. It's so upsetting. I remember telling the producers never to use my title. It's as if I had said I was allergic to shellfish and then this had somehow come out as: he loves shellfish.\" On the other, he could not love the fact of his knighthood more if he tried. \"A lovely official letter from Number 10, and then from the Palace!\" So he didn't think twice about accepting it? \"No! I'll tell you why it is a joy. We Brits are very reluctant to enthuse. There is a reticence which at times is endearing. But... in LA everyone shouts when I cross the road. Whereas here I am invisible.\" He does an impression of a British diner seeing him in a restaurant and then pretending not to see him. It is quite good. \"They don't love me!\" He catches sight of my face. \"Not that one wants to be loved. But of course, it's there... and the thing that is beautiful about the honours list is that it is the government and the sovereign on behalf of the public saying: 'OK, we do love you, very much.' And it's extraordinary, that feeling.\" He closes his eyes, blissed out at the thought, and I breathe deeply, the smell of Max Factor and Fisherman's Friends heavy in the air.\n\nFifty Dead Men Walking is released on 10 April\n\nThis article was amended on Wednesday 1 April 2009. Ben Kingsley's marriage to Angela Morant lasted 10 years, not six as we originally said in the article above. This has been corrected.\n\nThis article was amended on Sunday 5 April 2009. Above reported that Ben Kingsley did not return to the stage after winning an Oscar in 1982. But he played Othello in the RSC's 1985 production. This has been corrected."
