        "text": "LONDON, ENGLAND: 'Sexy Beast' fame Ben Kingsley and Daniela Lavender will clock in their 16th wedding anniversary this year. After three failed marriages, Kingsley had a secret wedding with Barbosa in 2007 and the news raised several eyebrows.\n\nDespite speculations regarding its success and longevity, his fourth marriage was the longest of all.\n\nWho is Daniela Lavender?\n\nDaniela Lavender, 49, was born and raised in Brazil. She moved to London for education and took odd jobs to meet her expenses. While working as a waitress at a bar, she pursued her interest in acting.\n\nDaniela was previously married to Ben Lavender, a successful system analyst. The duo legally ended six of marriage in 2003.\n\nThe struggling actress has played small roles in films such as 'Night Hunter' (2018) and 'Backstabbing for Beginners' (2018).\n\nDaniela Lavender is 30 years younger than Ben Kingsley\n\nAt 63, 'Gandhi' star Kingsley married 32-year-old Daniela Lavender in front of a handful of guests at a country house in Oxfordshire, England.\n\nDaniela was never bothered about the age gap between both.\n\n\"You don’t see Ben’s age. The sexual chemistry is very active. I don’t live with the Ben Kingsley of ten years ago; I was very attracted to this Ben from the moment we met,\" she was quoted in a 2011 report by Daily Mail.\n\nGossipers wondered the fate of Kingsley's fourth marriage, given his poor past record and the enormous age gap with his current wife.\n\nHowever, their marriage stood the test of time and shut down all negative speculations.\n\nWhen Ben Kingsley's third wife cheated on him\n\nKingsley was married thrice before he found love in Daniela, his current wife. His first marriage was to 'Brookside' fame Angela Morant. Married in 1966, the couple was blessed with two children. They ended their decade-long marriage in 1976.\n\nHe then tied the knot with prolific theatre director Alison Sutcliffe, with whom he has two children. They were together for 14 years and legally parted ways in 1992.\n\nKingsley's third marriage was quite short and scandalous. In 2003, he married German-born socialite Alexander Christmann.\n\nThings seemed to be picture-perfect until it wasn't anymore. 15 months into the marriage, Kingsley was left heartbroken when he saw Christmann's photo of her kissing Sammy Brauner, a real estate agent, published in a newspaper, according to the Irish Examiner.\n\nKnowing about his wife's affair via media reportedly caused him humiliation. However, he didn't stop believing in love and went on to marry Daniela Lavender two years later.\n\nBen Kingsley starrer 'Sexy Beast' is getting a spin-off series\n\nKingsley most recently appeared in Wes Anderson's 'The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar' (2023).\n\nMeanwhile, his critically acclaimed film 'Sexy Beast', which also earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, is getting a spin-off series with the same name.\n\n'Paradox' fame Emun Elliott has stepped into Kingsley's shoes to play Don Logan. It is set to premiere on Paramount+ on January 25, 2024."
