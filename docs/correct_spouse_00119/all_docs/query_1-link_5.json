        "text": "Oh, dear. We”ve made Ben Kingsley cross.\n\nThe phone interview had been going well. We”d been careful to address the Oscar winner as “Sir Ben.” We”d asked him about each of his many new films. But now we were trying to steer him toward the topic of his fourth marriage, this time to Daniela Barbosa de Carneiro, a Brazilian actress 30 years his junior.\n\nWe saw our opening when he mentioned that he was calling from his estate in Oxfordshire. Well, we said, we”d just read a newspaper story about …\n\n“I don”t read anything about me in print,” Kingsley interrupted. “It”s not written for me. It”s written for people who are curious about me.”\n\nWe were happy to fill him in. What this article said was .. .\n\n“I”m being dead-serious,” he interjected. “I don”t read them. So is this a good idea?”\n\nIt wasn”t a bad article …\n\n“I”m saying I don”t read them,” he said firmly, “and you”re holding a newspaper under my nose! I”m trying to be polite, but . . .”\n\nNow we interrupted him. Leaving out “newspaper,” we said we”d heard that locals in his Cotswold village were finding Sir Ben much nicer since he”d married that young bird. One taxi driver said the “b—” was even tipping better.\n\nKingsley laughed delightedly. “I hope they”re talking about the right person,” he said. “Am I happier? I”m in a very good place. I have the most amazing partner. So many things will conspire to upset the balance. But right now life is good.”\n\nBetter, certainly, than when a German tabloid published pictures of his third wife, Alexandra Christmann, also three decades younger than Kingsley, kissing another man. The couple ended their 15-month marriage last year. Shortly thereafter, Kingsley met Barbosa. They wed 18 months later. Did his last marriage give him any doubts that this one would work?\n\n“I have signed a legal document whereby I am absolutely forbidden from making any reference to any previous marriage,” he replied. “So I can only talk about the present.”\n\nWhatever happened before hasn”t stopped him from setting up a production company with Barbosa, a former waitress and sometime journalist.\n\n“We”d love to find a project together,” said the 63-year-old “Gandhi” star, who has a half dozen films of his own on the way, including “Elegy,” “The Wackness” and “The Love Guru.” “We”re both moved by similar things. We”re both looking for truth.”\n\nHe”s unbothered by their age difference — or the fact that her ex-husband lives a few miles away from their manor house.\n\n“We all mature at different stages in our lives,” he said. “It”s taken me a longer journey to be equal to her. We see each other as equals. People can chat away, but that”s how it is.”\n\nTyson happy in rehab|\n\nMike Tyson has gone from an Arizona prison camp straight back to an L.A. rehab facility — but he”s happy in his confinement.\n\nLast week, “America”s toughest sheriff” Joe Arpaio trotted out his famous inmate for a sideshow where every photographer got a shot of the handcuffed champ in his striped prison uniform and pink socks. Tyson”s lawyer called the spectacle “appalling.” Tyson himself said nothing.\n\n“He”s not going to complain about anything now,” says director James Toback, who for the past year has been interviewing Tyson for a major documentary. “It”s part of his rehabilitation not to blame anyone. In my film, the only person he still complains about is Don King.”\n\nHaving pleaded guilty to cocaine possession, the 41-year-old Tyson hit rehab with the dedication he showed as a young fighter. He passed 29 drug tests. Impressed, the judge sentenced him to one day in jail.\n\n“I was waiting for him to fall off the wagon,” says Toback. “But he never did.”\n\nToback”s film shows a previously unimaginable Tyson — articulate, reflective, prone to tears. Key to Mad Mike”s turnaround is his devoted ex, Monica. “We were terrible as husband and wife,” Tyson tells Toback, “but we”re great as friends.”\n\nThough he”s done his time, the retired boxer still feels most secure at the Wonderland Center, where he has spent a year. “He”s in great shape. He”s become a kind of inspirational star on the AA circuit. But he wants to continue the program.”\n\nTyson”s handlers are now fielding TV and speaking offers from people who want to hear how the prizefighter KO”d his demons. “The movie is like a Greek tragedy,” Tyson told Toback, whose film is due out next year. “The only bad thing is that I”m the subject.”\n\nSide dish: Tara Reid gets ”scrubbed”|\n\nDon”t look for Tara Reid on another episode of “Scrubs.” Appearing at the New York Comedy Festival, show creator Bill Lawrence said Reid was his least favorite guest star — “not because she wasn”t a nice person,” but because she allegedly stank of booze and smokes. (Reid”s rep didn”t return an e-mail.) Meanwhile, the New York Daily News” Sean McCarthy reports that network censors have nixed a fantasy sequence in which Donald Faison”s character, Turk, loses a testicle. Said “Scrubs” star Zach Braff: “The fantasy was that Donald and I went testicle shopping at Ball-Mart.” …\n\nBritish and rock royals turned out for the 1993 wedding of Ringo Starr”s sister-in-law Marjorie Bach to Lord Alexander Rufus-Isaacs. But now we hear that the Eagles” Joe Walsh has become Marjorie”s front man. Walsh and Bach turned up arm-in-arm at the Hollywood party for legendary rock photographer Henry Diltz”s new opus, “California Dreaming.” Also there were Ringo, wife Barbara, Olivia Harrison (George”s widow), Brian Wilson, Graham Nash, Michelle Phillips and Mickey Dolenz. …\n\nAndrew McCarthy has more than survived his Brat Pack days. Check him out in “The Spiderwick Chronicles,” “Camp Hope” and “Lipstick Jungle.” And thank you, Andrew, for finding our cell phone. …\n\nDustin Hoffman, who stars in the tongue-twisting “Mr. Magorium”s Wonder Emporium,” remains grateful to his mother for sticking him with an embarrassing nickname. “She used to call me her Tootsie Wootsie,” Hoffman tells Baird Jones of East Village nightspot Webster Hall. And so his Oscar-winning film, “Tootsie,” got its name. …\n\nTodd Haynes has directed Julianne Moore, Toni Collette and Cate Blanchett, among other gorgeous actresses. But it was Charlotte Gainsbourg who made him question his sexual identity. “Seriously,” Haynes told guests at the Tribeca Cinema Series screening of “I”m Not There.” “When she came on the set, I never wanted to be straight more in my life.” …\n\nChef John Villa went through 50 pounds of lamb chops, 20 pounds of sea bass and 60 pounds of Kobe beef at his seventh annual TAO Tailgate party in the parking lot of Giants Stadium. …\n\nLooks like Ian Somerhalder has “Lost” his identity. Photogs on the red carpet of the Totally Tisch benefit kept calling him “Chace,” mistaking him for “Gossip Girl” star Chace Crawford. …\n\nNew York neighbors of First Daughter Barbara Bush have noticed more Secret Service agents on the block. One resident suspects the extra beef may have to do with Janeane Garofalo”s blabbing on “Real Time with Bill Maher” that Barbara “lives on my street.” Bush-bashing Garofalo did thank the agents for stopping drunken NYU students from fighting outside her window."
