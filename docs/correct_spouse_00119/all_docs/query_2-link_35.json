        "text": "Sir Ben Kingsley’s long career has seen him win two Oscars, and marry four women.\n\nNow, however, he has spoken of how his career has been driven by the \"vacuum” of a loveless upbringing which he felt was finally healed when he was knighted by the Queen.\n\nSir Ben, 69, was born Krishna Bhanji in Scarborough and brought up in Salford. His father Rahimtulla Harji Banjhi, was a doctor of Gujurati descent; his mother, Anna Lyna Mary, was an English model and actress.\n\nHowever in an interview to be published in next week’s Seven magazine, he said that he was brought up without a feeling of love and that it was only through acting that he began to heal those wounds.\n\n“I had always been the song-and-dance man of the family,” he says. “I remember my father referring to me as ’our little Danny Kaye’ when I was about seven. That was the only remotely positive comment I remember from them. They never praised me or acknowledged a gram of talent in me at all.\n\n“Their way was to mock — ’when are you going to finish with this acting lark,’ that sort of thing. My mother, far from being proud, was very jealous of my success.” Kaye was a Hollywood actor and comedian known mostly for his physical comedy, dancing and nonsense songs.\n\nSir Ben’s father died aged 54, and his mother in 2010, aged 96.\n\nThe investiture ceremony was carried out at Buckingham Palace by the Queen, and he said that it made him feel that he had received approval and affection for the first time. His mother was not present at the investiture.\n\n“I told you about my parents, and the fact that any kind of embrace was totally absent from my life,” he said.\n\n“So to be embraced by Her Majesty...I felt like stopping people in the street, saying my mum loves me, you know. Because that’s what it felt like, to me. The filling of a vacuum in the universe.” Sir Ben had previously spoken of his father’s heavy drinking and his difficult relationship with his mother, but had never told in full of his loveless childhood.\n\nThree years ago he said of her: “She had a circuit missing. That made her distant. And somewhat baffled by her four children, two girls and two boys.”\n\nSir Ben’s older brother became a doctor, while Sir Ben himself did not attend university or drama school.\n\nInstead he was given work by Sir Trevor Nunn at the Royal Shakespeare Company, which he said began to make up for his childhood.\n\n“That became my family, my education, my university, my language, my embrace, my tribe,” he said.\n\n“In Shakespeare, we see archetypal patterns of human behaviour that are flawlessly rendered, which comfort us, provoke us, offer us explanations, and which I’ve been attempting to pass on in every role that I do since.”\n\nSir Ben has been married four times: first to Angela Morant, whom he married in 1966 and divorced in 1976 and with whom he has a daughter, Jasmine, and a son, Thomas; then to Alison Sutcliffe, the theatre director, with whom he has two sons; thirdly to Alexandra Christmann, whom he divorced in 2005 after pictures emerged of her kissing another man; and finally to Daniela Lavender, a Brazilian-born actress who is 30 years his junior.\n\n“One’s just had a huge season at the National, the other at the RSC,” he said.\n\n“In contrast to the attitude of my own parents, when they finish a piece of work, and I’m in the same building, their ribs are in danger of being crushed. It was a huge relief to me to see they had the gift, and they have a genuine appetite for it.”\n\nSir Ben also uses the interview to deny a long-standing rumour that he insists on the use of his title."
