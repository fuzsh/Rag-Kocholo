He is a stickler for grammar and can be tetchy with interviewers. Only the foolhardy would forget for a second that this 71-year-old doctorâ€™s son, who was brought up in Manchester, is a knight of the realm.\n\nRight now, his shaven head is bent over a tea tray that has been sent up to the 38th-floor suite. He examines the trio of teabags, leaves contained in expensive-looking silken sachets. There is honey, lemon, milk, sugar and a silver flask of water. He pours the latter into a cup, dunks one of the sachets"
