Sir Ben Kingsley has split up with his wife Alexandra Christmann because a German newspaper published a picture of her kissing another man.Â

BZ printed a picture of Christmann with Sammy Brauner, son of German movie producer Atze Brauner.

Kingsley, who played Mahatma Gandhi [Images] in Richard Attenborough's [Images] film,Â married Christmann in October 2003.

"I've split from Ben. Sammy is my new boyfriend now. We are a couple and we are really happy," theÂ tabloid quoted Christmann as saying, while holding hands with Brauner at a party.

Kingsley, who was born Krishna Bhanji, has decided to file for divorce. This was his third marriage.
