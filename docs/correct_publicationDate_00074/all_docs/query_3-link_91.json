        "text": "After Such Knowledge, by Eva Hoffman (Vintage, £7.99)\n\nEva Hoffman's concern is with the aftermath of the Holocaust, particularly as it has worked through the sons and daughters of survivors, the \"hinge generation in which received, transferred knowledge of events is transmuted into history, or even myth\". This generation includes Hoffman herself, whose Polish parents were forced to survive by hiding for months in a narrow ditch dug out of the soil. Drawing on the current academic interest in memory studies, the book places these experiences in broader psychosocial context, picking through various relationships towards the atrocity - including the awed fear of children named after those killed, the \"psychic hardening\" of deniers, and the attention-seeking of those suffering from \"significance envy\" - with eloquent sensitivity. Such an intelligent work is only marred by a rushed final chapter on September 11, which lacks the complex analysis that is the hallmark of the rest of the book.\n\nJL\n\nThe Earth: An Intimate History, by Richard Fortey (Harper Perennial, £9.99)\n\nThis is a big book about an even bigger subject, but palaeontologist Richard Fortey is up to the challenge. Part travelogue and part pop science, Fortey's book takes the reader on a \"pilgrimage to the foundations of comprehension about our planet\". Beginning in the Bay of Naples and the infernal landscape around Vesuvius \"where the science of geology started\", he travels up the Alps and down the Bohemian mines, where both the dollar and the atom bomb had their earthy origins. Fortey lays bare \"the character of the earth\" and shows how we can read the runes of the landscape with plate tectonics: \"The rocks beneath us are like an unconscious mind beneath the face of the earth, determining its shifts in mood and physiognomy.\" Fortey's vivid prose breathes life into the rocks and shakes the dust off \"the driest of the sciences\". Geology has never been so exciting.\n\nPDS\n\nSpice: The History of a Temptation, by Jack Turner (Harper Perennial, £8.99)\n\nNothing, Turner shrewdly writes, is more lost to us than the taste of the past. Given a larder inventory we can attempt to remake a dish, but never the appetite it satisfied, especially when the emptiness was not gut hunger but a desire for status, immortality, or \"money on a plate\". Turner has really original insights on the departed desires, carnal and even spiritual, that spices stimulated, and on their trade - the way that worlds unknown to each other were long-distance-linked by passages of peppercorns and corridors of cloves. He perhaps underrates the geopolitical position of Persia, and the widespread influence of its resultant cuisine; but he's completely persuasive and fresh when disposing of encrusted rubbish about spice disguising the flavour of tainted medieval meat. What rot, Turner rightly says. Spices deliciously and expensively pepped up a dull and narrow list of available ingredients.\n\nVR\n\nPower, Politics and Culture: Interviews with Edward Said (Bloomsbury, £8.99)\n\n\"In many ways,\" wrote Edward Said in the preface to this wide-ranging and invigorating collection, \"interviews are sustained acts of discovery, not only for the person being interviewed but even for the well-prepared interviewer.\" And for the readers: for everyone who thought they knew what to expect from Said, whether they knew him as cultural theorist, political activist or music critic, will find something surprising or interesting in this wonderful collection. Spanning 24 years of his life, the range of interviewers provoke explanations of his ideas across an array of contexts, whether discussing the shared roots of Orientalism and European anti-Semitism or the pleasures and pains of teaching. What shines through is Said's generous, pluralistic approach to interrogating power relations (\"I felt it important to work through a number of genres, critics, voices\") which both provides satisfying answers and generates new questions.\n\nJL\n\nScience Fiction, by Roger Luckhurst (Polity, £19.99)\n\nIn the year that Quatermass and Dr Who are resurrected on television, Luckhurst's survey of SF seems timely. Unfortunately he limits himself to literature; but he dissects skilfully the literati's snobbery towards SF (real writers only do speculative fiction), and neatly plots the very different trajectories of SF in America - the land of the \"technological sublime\" - and Britain, where \"scientized ideologies\" like eugenics appealed. He concludes that SF \"has always been a mixed, hybrid, bastard form\". Luckhurst's book is part of a series of cultural histories, and so I would have liked a bit more context with my text. But as a scholarly study of SF from 1880 to the present day it's a solid, if rather pricey, piece of work. Luckhurst rightly praises Mordecai Roshwald's \"superbly mordant\" apocalyptic novel Level 7, but fans will be pleased to know that it has not been \"buried\" after all: it was reissued last year by Wisconsin University Press.\n\nPDS\n\nThe Oxford Book of Exploration, edited by Robin Hanbury-Tenison (£16.99)"
