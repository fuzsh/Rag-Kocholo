        "text": "I have had the privilege of working on the DVD commentaries for the forthcoming BFI box set of Classic BBC sci-fi anthology series Out Of The Unknown. With about 8 weeks to turn things round and a minuscule budget, producer John Kelly and I managed to accrue a pretty decent roster of talent which I am delighted to be able to reveal now.\n\nAll commentaries moderated by me.\n\nNo Place Like Earth\n\nWith Mark Ward (Out Of The Unknown expert) and Dan Rebellato (playwright, lecturer and John Wyndham expert).\n\nThe Dead Past\n\nWith John Gorrie (director) and Brian Hodgson (Special Sounds).\n\nTime In Advance\n\nWith Peter Sasdy (director), Wendy Gifford (Polly), Philip Voss (Police Officer) and Danvers Walker (Dan).\n\nSucker Bait\n\nWith Clive Endersby (Mark), Roger Croucher (Fawkes).\n\nSome Lapse Of Time\n\nWith Roger Jenkins (director), John Glenister (PA), Jane Downs (Diana Harrow) and Delena Kidd (Dr Laura Denville).\n\nThe Midas Plague\n\nWith Peter Sasdy.\n\nThe Machine Stops\n\nWith Philip Saville (director), Kenneth Cavander (adaptor), Michael Imison (story editor).\n\nLevel 7\n\nWith Mordecai Roshwald (author), Michael Imison (story editor).\n\nThis Body Is Mine\n\nWith John Carson (Allen).\n\nWelcome Home\n\nWith Moris Fahri (writer), Bernard Brown (Bowers Two).\n\nThe Man In My Head\n\nWith Peter Cregeen (director), Tom Chadbon (Brinson), Jeremy Davies (designer).\n\nSome of the commentaries spend some time with one participant then switch over to another as it wasnâ€™t always practical to get people at the same time: indeed Roshwald and Cavander (for example) live in the USA so we did them by Skype. Others we visited at home to minimise disruption to them. So some are a bit of a mix and match, but we wanted as many participants as possible."
