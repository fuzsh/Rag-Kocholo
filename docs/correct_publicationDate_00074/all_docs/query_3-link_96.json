He is an English author of novels, short films, audio theater, graphic novels, comic book, and films. He is popularly known for his notable works, such as the comic book series The Sandman and his novels American Gods, Stardust, The Graveyard book, and Coraline, which is now an animated motion picture. He has also won a number of accolades, specifically the Nebula, Hugo, and Bram Stoker awards, and also the Newbie and Carnegie medals, making him the very first author to win it both with his work, The Graveyard Book.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIn his early days, Neil was raised and born in Hampshire, specifically Portchester. His lovely father, David Bernard Gaiman, worked in a grocery chain stores that his grandfather established. While her mother, Sheila Gaiman, was employed as a pharmacist. David also has two sisters, Lizzy and Claire.\n\nGaiman\n\nGaiman can already read books at the early age of four years old, and he said “I was born a reader. I relly loved reading. Reading always gave me happiness. I was excelling in my classes, not because I had a particular expertise or interest at them, but because basically on the very first school day, they give you schoolbooks, and I’d eventually read them—which meant that I know what to expect because I read it.”\n\nSome books that Gaiman had a particular impression as a kid were J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, which he consistently read. Also, C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia series (which is now also a major motion picture) And recalled that “I really loved the way or his usageof parenthetical statements. It is as if he’s like talking to you. I’d think. “Oh, that is so cool! I would love to do that myself! And I said when I become an author someday, I want to do things exactly the way he does.’ I really liked the perspective of things being expressed using parentheses.” He also gained interest in Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, which he considered as a favourite.\n\nGaiman studied at various Church of England schools. Some of these schools are Ardingly College from 1970 to 1974, Fonthill School, and Whitgift School (1974-1997). Gaiman was prohibited from attending a boys’ school because his father is a public relations official of the Church of Scientology. Therefore, he was forced to stay at the school he had been previously attending. He settled in East Grindstead from 1965 to 1980, and again from 1984 to 1987. Gaiman met his first love, Mary McGrath, while she was studying Scientology. They tied the knot in the year 1985 after giving birth to their first child.\n\nCareer\n\nGrowing up, Gaiman was influenced by many authors, then later become a big fan of science fiction. He read the books of Samuel R. Delany, H.P. Lovecraft, Roger Zelazny, Thorne Smith, Robert A. Heinlein, Alan Moore, and Gene Wolfe.\n\nGaiman went to pursue Journalism in the early 1980’s. He would conduct interviews and write reviews of books, as a means to learn and to make or gain some connection that in later time, would assist and help him in getting published. Extensively, he reviewed and wrote for the British Fantasy Society. His first-ever professional short story work and publication was Featherquest, a fantasy story that was published in Imagine Magazine in the year 1984. Gaiman was 24 years old at that time.\n\nAlso, in 1984, Gaiman worked on his very first book. It was a biography of theGhastly Beyond Belief, which is a quotations book and the late band Duran Duran, with fellow author Kim Newman. Gaiman thought that he really did a terrible-job, but the book’s first edition was sold out. When he went to claim his right for the book, he found out that his publisher had gone bankrupt. After this, Penthouse (a men’s magazine) offered Gaiman a job, but he refused.\n\nGaiman also wrote articles and interview for various British magazines, even Knave magazine. During this time, he used pseudonyms like Richard Grey, Gerry Musgrave, and other more “house names”. Gaiman finally ended his Journalism career in the year 1987 because of the mere fact that British newspapers use untruths as facts. He wrote Don’t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy-Companion in what he considers asa Classic-English-Humour style. Following that, he worked on the opening of what became his collaboration with fellow author, Terry Pratchett. It wasGood Omens, the comic novel which tells about the impending-apocalypse.\n\nGraphic Novels and Comics\n\nGaiman formed a friendship bond with Alan Moore, who is a comic book writer. Prior to this, Gaiman started to write comic-books, selecting Marvelman after Moore ended his run on the series. Gaiman made more collaborations, including Mark Buckingham and close friend Dave McKean. Some of their works are The Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch, Signal to Noise , and Violent Cases. After some time, DC Comics hired Gaiman, and wrote the limited series Black Orchid. Karen Berger, who became the head of DC Comics’s Vertigo, asked Gaiman a job to rewrite a character. One of the most notable works of Gaiman started here, The Sandman.\n\nFilm and Screenwriting\n\nGaiman wrote the television series Neverwhere. Also, he co-wrote the screenplay for the movie MirrorMask again with Dave McKean for McKean to direct. He is also the author of the localised English translation script to the anime movie Princess Mononoke, which is based on the Japanese translation script. Additional to this, he co-wrote the script for Robert Zemeckis’s Beowulf with Roger Avary, In which their collaboration had been proved effective and productive for both writers. Gaiman also expressed his interest in collaboration on a film-adaptation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nFilm Adaptations\n\nSome of Gaiman’s works have been greenlighted for film adaptations. The most notable was Stardust, which premiered on August 2007, starring Robert De Niro, Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer. The director was Matthew Vaughn. Coraline also became a major motion picture, and was released on February 6, 2009. Henry Selick directed the movie, wit Teri Hatcher and Dakota Fanning as the lead voice-actors. Also, Gaiman announced that he would begin making the screenplay for the feature film Death: The High Cost of Living and that he would also direct it for Warner Independent. Producers are Susan Montford and Don Murphy while Guillermo del Toro is the executive producer.\n\nPresent Time\n\nGaiman now settles new in Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States and has been there since 1992. Gaiman decided to move there so that he can be close with his family. Gaiman has three children with then-wife Mary McGrath. As of 2013, he also resides in Cambride, MA.\n\nGaiman is now married to Amanda Palmer, a songwriter and performer. The couple announced on June 2009 that they were officially dating, and announced their engagement on Twitter on January 1, 2010. They were married legally on January 2 2011. He took MacKinnon as his middle name."
