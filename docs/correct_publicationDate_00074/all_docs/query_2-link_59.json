It was designed to protect important government figures from the radioactive wasteland created in the aftermath of an atomic war. A computer technician known only as X127 (or \"H\") and his colleague are assigned the duties of manning the console that arms Level 7's nuclear arsenal. Despite their defenses, the staff fear the effects of the radiation that is slowly seeping down into the bunker.\n\nCast[]\n\nPrincipal Cast[]\n\nActor Role Anthony Bate General Keith Buckley X127 Michele Dotrice R747 David Collings X117\n\nGuest Stars[]\n\nActor Role Tom Criddle Doctor Jane Jordan Rogers Woman commandant David Cargill Radio man One Raymond Hardy Radio man Two Michael Bird Colonel\n\nCo-Stars[]\n\nActor Role Sean Arnold New man Anthony Sweeney Air supply officer Glenn Williams Man Patricia Denys Woman\n\nNotes & Trivia[]\n\nMany sources erroneously identify this episode by the spelling \"Level 7\", but it is actually fully spelled out \"Level Seven\".
