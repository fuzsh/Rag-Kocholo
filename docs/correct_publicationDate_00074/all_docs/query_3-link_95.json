        "text": "Dr. David Brin is an American author of science fiction novels and stories. He is the creator of the Uplift universe. Brin graduated from the California Institute of Technology with a B.S. in astrophysics and also got his M.S. in applied physics and Ph.D in space science from the University of California, San Diego. As an author of hard science fiction, most of his stories are plausible, to the point that there is a website that keeps track of his predictions. He is a Hugo, Locus, Campbell and Nebula award winner. David lives in Southern California with his wife and children.\n\nDavid Brin became a published novelist in 1980 with the novel Sundiver, which began his Uplift universe.
