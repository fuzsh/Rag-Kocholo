        "text": "Abstract\n\nJust as the Cold War impacted upon all corners of the world, so the literature that responded to events appeared in all nations, regions and continents. The writing engaged with the processes of the conflict (propaganda, intelligence, nuclearism, militarism, authoritarianism) and with the lived experiences of individuals and societies affected by such processes. More specifically, Cold War literature was a global current that not only shared particular concerns, but also developed through transnational patterns of contact, exchange, influence and allegiance that broke down national categories of literature. After setting out the focus and scope of the volume, the introduction summarises its 33 chapters—arranged in sections on themes, genres and regions—and calls for further research into this vital but understudied field.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.\n\nAccess this chapter\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\nChapter\n\nEUR 29.95\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\neBook\n\nEUR 181.89\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nHardcover Book\n\nEUR 235.39\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nPurchases are for personal use only\n\nInstitutional subscriptions\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nNotes\n\nAuthor information\n\nAuthors and Affiliations\n\nSchool of Humanities, University of Brighton, Brighton, UK\n\nAndrew Hammond\n\nAuthors\n\nCorresponding author\n\nCorrespondence to Andrew Hammond .\n\nEditor information\n\nEditors and Affiliations\n\nSchool of Humanities, University of Brighton, Brighton, UK\n\nAndrew Hammond\n\nRights and permissions\n\nReprints and permissions\n\nCopyright information\n\n© 2020 The Author(s)\n\nAbout this chapter\n\nCite this chapter\n\nHammond, A.
