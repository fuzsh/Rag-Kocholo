        "text": "The 2023 TV series Silo seems to trace one woman’s heroic uprising against an evil oppressor. But in reality her foolish belief threatens everyone.\n\nIn June 2023 I immersed myself reading, again, the slow moral and physical decay of what’s left of humanity in an underground bunker during and following atomic war in Ukraine-born writer Mordecai Roshwald’s 1959 novel Level 7. It inspired me, among other thoughts, to pen a private letter to the machine intelligence that is likely to succeed us, offering one small perspective on what may be necessary for both our species moving forward.\n\nAnd then, as ironic backdrop to all this, I caught the TV series Silo, a series that seemed unaware even of the vacuity of its own message. But let’s put it into context here, and I warn that of necessity spoilers will follow.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes and pocket universes go together in science fiction. Humans are trapped in confined spaces where our worst nature asserts itself: greedy bigots rise to power, vital secrets are withheld from the populace, abuses meted out, the lesser turned to chattels for the aggrandizement of the greater. Our world, only smaller.\n\nGeorge Orwell, of course, provided a template for this kind of work in Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the genre has refracted it in endless ways. We see it in movies from THX 1138 to The Matrix. In novels and stories of all kinds, from nuclear bunkers to multi-generational spaceships. (I’ve written lots of this stuff myself.) In TV series, too, perhaps most notably in The Prisoner.\n\nThere are two kinds of story that are told in this sub-genre. In every case a protagonist, our hero, begins to question their environment. They may be triggered by something unexpected, for example by Truman Burbank’s falling spotlight in The Truman Show, or simply by a need to explore as in Brian Aldiss’s novel Non-Stop. This leads to a moment of conceptual breakthrough — the protagonist discovers something paradigm-shattering about the world they seem to inhabit.\n\nAnd now their fortunes diverge. In the Nineteen Eighty-Four strand, their bid fails, the regime wins, the vice tightens still further on what’s left of humanity. But in the other the truth unlocks the prison, topples corrupt leaders, brings freedom. Here’s Truman at the end of his odyssey, standing grinning at the door that will lead him outside.\n\nIn either case, the battle is hard fought. The protagonist strives against entrenched positions and hacks at insurmountable obstacles. We feel their defeat acutely, or applaud their triumph rapturously. We win or lose alongside them: that’s the definition of a hero.\n\nSilo gives us something quite different, something that is either incompetently plotted or willfully fraudulent. Given the failings in Hugh Howey’s original stories, first published in 2011, I’d lean towards the former. But for a TV series produced in the wake of MAGA and the Covid-19 pandemic, it must certainly be the latter. And that’s a real problem.\n\nI’m going to ignore Howey from now on. Much more happens in the original Wool cycle after we leave this first season of Silo, but nothing that might excuse what we have. Few watchers, for sure, will have read the books. An intelligent TV adaptation is just that — an adaptation, meaning that it will diverge at will as producers begin to stamp their own presence on the work. We couldn’t guarantee that Silo will follow Wool forward, and personally I cannot see how it could. So let’s stick with what we have on the screen.\n\nSilo is set in a post-nuclear bunker where thousands of survivors are locked up to endure not just the long-passed war but the radioactive wasteland that followed. It’s a multi-generational spaceship stuck underground. For all we know in the series, it’s unique, the very last of humanity. Its only purpose is to survive at all costs, perhaps for hundreds more years until the Earth becomes habitable again.\n\nWe have what is presented to us as the typical evil regime, doing all the nefarious murderous things it must to keep itself in power. It has Orwellian secret spy cameras everywhere, including inside people’s private chambers. It has jack-booted thugs who prowl up and down its many levels. It has figurehead leaders who are actually powerless tokens. It has an ugly, duplicitous, almost comically unpleasant true leadership (personified by a scene-chewing Tim Robbins) which rules with an iron claw.\n\nAnd into this falls our Truman Show spotlight in the form of a mysterious hard disk, centuries old, that holds evidence that seems to suggest that the world outside has long recovered and that in fact, in an age-old science fiction trope, the authorities are simply continuing to imprison and enslave humanity down in this bunker because they like the power it gives them. You bastards.\n\nNow, putting aside the fact that I can’t seem to keep a HDD alive for more than a handful of years before it starts playing up, corrupting my data, and becoming unplayable (and this one has been bashed around a lot over its centuries), we appear to have here an emissary from the truth. That is certainly how its latest owner, lowly deep-level manual worker Juliette Nichols, receives the thing. She finds a file in which she appears to see paradise outside, something at odds with the grime-swept lifeless wasteland that is visible through the silo’s one and only external camera mounted way up top on its surface hatch.\n\nNichols is thus galvanized to begin her own quest for conceptual breakthrough, to tear down the regime, to awaken her fellow inmates. She even manages to broadcast the paradise clip to them all, sowing discord.\n\nBut here’s the thing of it: the outside world really is a grime-swept lifeless wasteland. It is toxic with poisons or radiation. The file is a lie, Nichols is believing a lie, Nichols is promulgating a lie, Nichols is fighting for a lie all the way up to the, oh let’s say the Capitol riot of her misguided beliefs.\n\nTear down the institutions! Open the hatch!\n\nShe’s a fool or a dupe. And yes, the analogy I just made is an obvious one. She’s the equivalent of a Trump follower blindly believing his birther lies, collusion lies, election fraud lies, and whatever else he’s been spouting since I wrote this. It even seems, as it seems in the warped MAGA mindset, that the authorities are attempting to silence her because they don’t want people to know the truth.\n\nLet me repeat it: the tape is a lie. Nichols is roused to rebellion by a lie. And it’s a lie even more pernicious and damaging than, let’s say, that the Covid-19 vaccine contains some kind of government microchip or that human aggravated global warming is a hoax.\n\nAnd yet until the very last frame of Silo this truth-detached sucker remains our hero. She never achieves wisdom from the recognition of her folly, and the series never presents it all as satire. We’re supposed to end the season somehow believing that she is right.\n\nLet’s circle back to the reality of the silo. Human beings are volatile, easily misled. We all know this. So the authorities in this bunker, teetering for centuries on the brink of extinction, must somehow keep their chaotic population alive. There has already been one rebellion which almost succeeded in killing everybody. So perhaps this does mean heavy-handed authoritarian responses to threats, such as stifling rebellion harshly. Even murder. So be it. These are grim times, and humanity must adopt grim measures if it is to prevail.\n\nAnd let’s be clear, once again. The world outside is lethal. It is exactly what the authorities say it is. And yet there are always likely to be fools like Nichols who want to fling the doors open and the authorities must remain vigilant against them. We should never be on Nichols’s side.\n\nNot that I want to make the rest of Silo some kind of paragon of good genre scene-setting. It’s a nonsensical scenario, and anybody unburdened by indoctrination into lies should have realized it from the start.\n\nIn all those pocket universe and conceptual breakthrough stories I mentioned, our protagonist fights to break free. What does breaking free mean for people like Nichols? It means battling their way to the outside world. But in Silo you can go outside simply by saying that you want to go outside.\n\nIf the outside world were a paradise, this would make no sense. The authorities punish those who want to go outside by shoving them out into paradise? Ridiculous! Nichols should have known this. And that solitary camera lens showing (correctly) the toxic wasteland outside needs a periodic wipe to clean it of the grime that has banked against it. Where does the grime come from, if the outside is a paradise? Just listen to yourself, Nichols. Take the fricking cap off and listen.\n\nWhat then this tape? Here’s where the concept gets really stupid. For reasons best known to its author, the entire story hinges around the idea that when you are indeed banished to the outside world (which you think is a paradise) you’re not just shoved naked out of the hatch, as would make logical sense. You’re dolled up in spacesuit-type hazmat protection.\n\nWhat? This is a society that is cruelly isolated. Everything it owns it must horde carefully for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. There’s a whole subtext in the TV series about the scavenging and recycling of waste. And yet it seemingly has an endless supply of spacesuits which it can afford to cast aside on its dissidents! And what’s more, these are high-tech spacesuits, much higher tech than anything this decaying technological community can still afford.\n\nYou want to know how high-tech these spacesuits are? They have VR units built into their helmets.\n\nYou heard me. Sophisticated, computer-driven VR units that present their wearers with a false impression that the world they’re banished into is a paradise rather than the wasteland it really is. They step out of the hatch and seem to see a wonderland of nature around them. And then, elated by this realization that they were right, they go over and wipe the toxic grime off the lens!\n\nThe VR helmets are one thing. But the spacesuits themselves are poorly manufactured overall, or purposefully faulty, since their wearers head off into their pretend paradise only to soon succumb to the all-too-real poisons or radiations leaking into their suits. They die within a minute or so. But in one of the series’ silliest conceits, when it’s her turn to step outside, Nichols is somehow dolled up in a perfectly working spacesuit (there’s a recurring MacGuffin about sealant tape) so she alone survives.\n\nThe tape she found on that ancient hard drive would seem to be part of this VR program squirted into the helmets of those who are punished into leaving the silo. The VR is ridiculous and so Nichols finding the footage is ridiculous and yet this is her triggering event.\n\nIt ought to be satire, like the murderous regime in my own novel The Mael. Nichols stepping out onto the surface, and having the VR program handily fail on her to reveal the truth, ought to have been a grim moment of revelation in which our world spins upside down and we realize, alongside her, just what a prick she’s been. But it is presented as nothing of the kind. She heads off across the wasteland having apparently repented not a jot of her stupidity which would, had it succeeded, have cast all of humanity into oblivion.\n\nEven her final act is one of betrayal of common reason. She walks confidently out of the sight of the lens as if the outside is indeed survivable, and those inside watch her and think: wow, maybe she was right all along.\n\nNo. She wasn’t. But you can be absolutely sure that there will be mutterings and a loss of trust in the authorities and rebellions and even, eventually, extinction for us all.\n\nSilo should have ended with Nichols’s repentance and an ugly death right there in plain view on the surface. She should have died hideously, knowing just what a chump she was. That she did not, for a series produced at this point when our own political divisions are greater than ever and our adherence to reality is shakier than ever, means its makers shirk even a passing responsibility to their viewers. The series seems to believe that it’s heroic to spread harmful disinformation without consequence — and then throws in a slingshot in the closing moments to try to distract us from thinking about it.\n\nWhat an empty-headed response to good story-telling this is. And what an insane dereliction of duty to truth.\n\nHeader collage by Robert Maas."
