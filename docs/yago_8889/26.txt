Biography

America's first female newspaper editor. Upon the death of her husband James, she inherited his newspaper, the Rhode Island Almanac. They had only one child; she died when just a couple of years old. Ann's brother-in-law was Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

They had five children while in Newport, including daughters Mary and Elizabeth, and son James Jr. (c.1730-1762). James Jr. attended Philadelphia Academy with his cousin William, Benjamin's son, before James Jr. apprenticed in the printing trade with his Uncle Benjamin. After a long illness, James died in Newport in 1735, leaving Ann a widow, aged 39, with three young children to support, one child having preceded him in death.
