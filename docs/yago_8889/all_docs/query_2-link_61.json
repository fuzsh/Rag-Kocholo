        "text": "ROCHESTER — The Franklin Gallery at Ben Franklin Crafts, 60 Wakefield St., will feature works by five local artists during the month of March: Sally Allen, Marilyn Price, Anne Smith, Rose Sielian Theriault, and Grace Youngren. These five artists have been meeting and creating together for many years. They are all members of Art Esprit, a group of artists, writers, and art appreciators.\n\n“We are all in the upper years of life… We get together on Monday mornings and may draw, paint, print, create sculptures or goof off. We may work individually or on a group project,” said Allen, who has been a member of this particular group of artists for more than six years. “We are a support to each other. It’s meaningful and fun.”\n\nAllen studied art at the University of New Hampshire and Lesley University, then taught art for many years in the Seacoast area. Since then she has enjoyed working at her studio at the Rollinsford Mill and conducting workshops in and beyond New England as the proprietor of Gentle Journey, which she describes as “a beautiful blend of art, mind-body and breath, all focused to enhance [one’s] self discovery process.”\n\nPrice has no formal art school background. Everyday living was her classroom. Then an opportunity to hang paintings at the Rochester Fair led her to discover what was good and what to avoid. She is a juried member of the New Hampshire Art Association, Coordinator of NHAA Prescott Park Art Show, Art Superintendent of Rochester Fair, member of Kittery Art Association and Art Esprit.\n\nSmith graduated from UNH and taught high school art for many years. She has been a part of Art Esprit and has contributed to the public art in Rochester events. She works in various media, but focuses most on collage using subjects from nature as well as “ideas from my own imagination.” Currently, Anne runs a cartoon and drawing club at the Hill Library in Strafford.\n\nTheriault graduated from UNH with a BFA and BA in Art with a minor in Education. She has taught art in many schools including Spaulding High. She is a founding member and board member of Art Esprit. She is also a member of the Ogunquit Art Association, NH Art Association and Durham Art Association. Her art has been featured in many solo and group shows throughout Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\n\nYoungren studied at UNH, Sanctuary Arts, at private studios and a gallery located in Eliot, Maine with many other artists. She is a long time resident of Rochester, and a member of the New Hampshire Art Association, Great Bay Art Association and Art Esprit. She works in a variety of media but her lifelong choice has been oils.\n\nThe Franklin Gallery and Ben Franklin Crafts are open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. To learn more about this month’s and future Franklin Gallery exhibits, write to Kris, the Franklin Gallery manager, at kebbeson@metrocast.net."
