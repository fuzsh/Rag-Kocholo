        "text": "Kernan Robson Professor of Politics & Government; Department Chair\n\nEducation\n\nB.A., Auburn University\n\nPh.D., Texas A&M University\n\nAbout\n\nJames Franklin is a Professor of Politics and Government. He teaches a wide variety of courses, such as Latin American Politics, Comparative Political Issues, and topical courses on Democratization and on Protest and Political Violence. His primary research interests are political repression, political protest, and democratization. He has published articles in a variety of social science journals, including Comparative Political Studies, International Studies Quarterly, and Political Research Quarterly, where one of his articles was named the best paper of the year in 2009. He is currently pursuing a new research project examining the causes and consequences of democratic revolutions around the world. He has also been part of a research team that traveled to Mexico to examine ongoing economic and political changes.\n\nHis research interests stem from his interests in human rights and developing countries. His interests in human rights grew from participation in Amnesty International in college and then interning with the organization. His interest in developing countries was enhanced by service trips to Mexico to work with local community members to build houses.\n\nOutside the classroom, he enjoys listening to and playing music. He is a drummer and has played in a variety of bands. He also enjoys spending time with his wife (also a political scientist) and two children."
