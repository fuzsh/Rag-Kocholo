        "text": "Editor’s note: This story is part of the Secrets of the Coaching Carousel series exploring unique aspects of college football coaching changes and more.\n\nAs he walked through Vanderbilt’s hotel ahead of the 2014 BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Ala., James Franklin couldn’t help but feel like everyone was watching him. They might’ve been.\n\nHis clothing was still black and gold, his Commodores on the cusp of going 9-4, but as he walked, rumors swirled about the next job for one of college football’s most intriguing head coaching candidates. For the man who once entered fraternity houses to drum up fan support and who later pitched a new football stadium to university brass and project architects, the very thing he hoped wouldn’t happen started to permeate through Vanderbilt’s bowl game headquarters.\n\nSuddenly, Franklin was rumored to be a finalist for the head coaching job … at Texas.\n\n“It was crazy,” said Brent Pry, who joined Franklin’s Vanderbilt staff in 2011 and has been with him for the entirety of his run at Penn State. “You’re trying to get guys ready to play a good Houston team and news breaks that James will be the next head coach at Texas. We had to call a team meeting. It might’ve even been the night before the game. We had to talk through it and calm everybody down.”\n\nWith a bowl game that wasn’t played until Jan. 4, Franklin and his wife, Fumi, couldn’t avoid the rumors. If what was scrolling on ESPN’s ticker linking Franklin to Texas was worrisome for players and their families, just imagine Franklin’s concern the next day when Penn State’s six-person search committee arrived at the same hotel after Vanderbilt’s bowl game. They had previously arranged to interview him there.\n\n“It was one of those hotels where the rooms are all kind of open and you walk through,” Franklin told The Athletic this summer as he looked back at the search. “There were too many eyes in there, too many Vanderbilt people in the hotel. That wasn’t a great situation. For the second phase of it, they actually flew to Florida and met me and Fumi in Florida. … Usually you’re meeting at somebody’s home to keep things as private as possible.”\n\nFranklin wasn’t the only candidate Penn State interviewed in Florida during that time. Wally Richardson, a former Penn State quarterback and the current director of the Football Letterman’s Club, was part of the search committee. He wouldn’t name names but did confirm he was in someone else’s home in Florida for an interview.\n\nAl Golden, a former Penn State captain who was then the head coach at Miami, was rumored to be among Penn State’s finalists. Mike Munchak, the Penn State alum and NFL Hall of Famer, had become available after being fired as the Tennessee Titans’ head coach. Greg Roman, then the 49ers’ offensive coordinator and now the Ravens’ offensive coordinator, was also reported to be in the mix. However, even now, Penn State’s former search committee members won’t say anything about any of the candidates they didn’t hire. It’s not polite to “kiss and tell,” as one former search committee member put it.\n\n“We prided ourselves on our confidentiality and trying to protect those who had reached out to us,” said former Penn State athletic director Dave Joyner. Joyner’s tenure included hiring both Bill O’Brien and Franklin within two years of one another. “Even if somebody on a rumor was correct, we wouldn’t acknowledge it. … Now with James Franklin, I couldn’t blame anyone for postulating that because the guy comes into Vanderbilt (and turned it around).”\n\nFranklin, a Pennsylvania native, coached Vanderbilt to its only two ranked finishes since 1948 in just three seasons in Nashville, making him one of the hottest coaching candidates at the time and an obvious target for Penn State. Now, it’s been almost eight years since Penn State underwent the search that brought him to State College.\n\nFor some, the days still blur together and details can be a bit fuzzy.\n\n“I remember, the process took too long and there were so many people involved,” Franklin said. “They were trying to do it like searches for other jobs on a college campus and it doesn’t work like that.\n\n“I remember it became too public, because then you get put in a position where you’re being asked, and now you’re in a no-win situation. If you say you’re not interested, then you’re out of that job. But then, you’re put in a position where you’re not being honest and truthful with the people in the job and the fan base you currently have. You’re really put in a no-win situation.”\n\nIn the 11 days between when O’Brien left to coach the Houston Texans and when Franklin was introduced at Penn State, trajectories changed at several places.\n\nPenn State, aided by several of Franklin’s one-time Vanderbilt verbal commits like quarterback Trace McSorley, won a Big Ten title in 2016. Under Franklin, the Nittany Lions rebounded from NCAA sanctions and have appeared in three New Year’s Six bowl games. Despite last Saturday’s loss to Iowa, they’re ranked in the top 10 this season with a chance to add to that New Year’s Six total.\n\nTexas hired Charlie Strong on Jan. 5, 2014, shortly after Franklin was rumored to be a finalist. They parted ways after three years. Texas has also hired and fired Tom Herman and hired Steve Sarkisian since then.\n\nVanderbilt, meanwhile, lost Franklin and all the momentum he built for the football program. The Commodores are 29-60 with appearances in two bowl games (both losses) and zero winning seasons since Franklin’s departure.\n\n“I was bummed personally because I didn’t want to see him go anywhere,” said Vanderbilt baseball coach Tim Corbin, a close friend of Franklin. The two still talk weekly. “There was talk of a new stadium, there was talk of a lot of different things, and I wanted that to come to reality for him. And I wanted it to come to reality for the school, because the school was in a place of success from a football standpoint.”\n\nFranklin has continued to appear on reported head coaching wish lists in the years since then. To always be mentioned for premier jobs means he’s doing something right, as athletic director Sandy Barbour put it in 2019. Franklin has gotten more money for his assistant coaches at Penn State, and the facilities continue to be upgraded. Nobody will be surprised if USC, seemingly this year’s top suitor after firing Clay Helton in September, makes a push for Franklin.\n\n“I’ve also found and tracked this over time that, really no matter what you say, people aren’t happy with (it),” Franklin said last month when asked about USC. “So, I decided I’m going to handle this internally. I talked to our team. It happens every single year. I’m not worried about distractions in the media and with the fans. I’m worried about my team.”\n\nFranklin estimated this past offseason that only 50 percent of what gets reported during a coaching search is accurate. During any search, flights are tracked by folks who try to connect tail numbers to schools and boosters. Speculation runs rampant, and those who have the best pulse on what’s transpiring behind closed doors and inside undisclosed interview locations usually are the coaching agents. Once one school narrows its list, it creates a domino effect.\n\nOne notable detail about the search that brought Franklin to Penn State? It almost didn’t work out.\n\nIn the moments after Vanderbilt’s bowl win against Houston, one person in the locker room that day, someone who spent countless hours around Franklin, still remembers the gist of Franklin’s postgame speech.\n\n“It was like take a look at everyone around you because we could never be in the same room again,” the source said. “Now, he could’ve meant the seniors, this team or anything, but it’s foreshadowing when you think about it now.”\n\nSpeculation about that game being Franklin’s last with Vanderbilt was nothing new, as it had become a common occurrence in previous offseasons. In his first season, Franklin went 6-7, two more wins than the Commodores had in the previous two seasons combined. In 2012, they leaped to 9-4, their most wins in nearly a century, and finished ranked in the Top 25. In 2013, they did it again.\n\nThis time, those close to Franklin wondered if he was ready for a new challenge, a fresh start someplace else.\n\n“I felt like it would be a surprise if he stayed,” said Corbin. “But I felt like there was a big part of him that wanted to stay because he wanted to see it through. But there was also a big part of him — this was a very emotional time, because Vanderbilt was coming off of an unfortunate incident (a rape case involving Vanderbilt football players) and that really hit him hard.”\n\nCorbin attended the BBVA Compass Bowl but also wanted to give Franklin space to think through the search. The two first met shortly after Franklin arrived at Vanderbilt when, as Corbin tells it, Franklin walked into his office, sat down and told him he needed him and his wife, Maggie, aboard the General Jackson Showboat several weekends in a row that winter.\n\nIf football recruiting was going to improve, Franklin needed the dynamic baseball coach to talk to prospects during the river cruise portion of their official visits.\n\n“He was that type of guy that was edgy,” Corbin said. “He had unbelievable personality and aggressiveness. And it just hit this program in a way that I think few others could have hit it.”\n\nIt might be how meticulous the two are that helped them bond. Corbin arranges books in his office by descending height and his players had to rehearse how to stand for the national anthem and how to board flights for away games. If ever Franklin’s desk wasn’t neatly organized and he wasn’t writing with a specific kind of pen, something was wrong. Franklin had a handyman in the football facility to tend to the chipped paint and squeaky hinges. He was detailed and demanding, but that’s what it took to turn the doormat of the SEC into a Top 25 team.\n\nCorbin knew if Franklin was seriously considering leaving, he’d already be thinking about who on staff he’d take with him. The man’s mind never stops, Corbin said. The football coach needed to think through this decision without Corbin.\n\nOne of the things Franklin wanted at Vanderbilt, an indoor facility, had already been built. Vanderbilt athletic director David Williams, who became a close friend to Franklin and his family, had opened the check book in previous offseasons to further show the school’s commitment to Franklin and to football. Williams attended grandparents day at school for Franklin’s daughters. He and his wife even helped the head coach find a house after he arrived in Nashville.\n\nWith Texas and Penn State pursuing Franklin, Vanderbilt made another push to keep Franklin.\n\n“They were prepared to offer him far more money than a Vanderbilt program could probably justify in a normal budget,” said the Vanderbilt source. “People who were in the room when they were giving Franklin I guess the financial pitch said that he seemed sincere and was listening. … Nine wins here is like 14 elsewhere.”\n\nStill, Vanderbilt isn’t Texas or Penn State.\n\n“It’s really an interesting dynamic the way those things take shape,” said Pry, who has been in the mix for head coaching jobs himself in recent years. “You really don’t know and at some point they start moving really fast and guys are eliminated and new guys are in the fold pretty quickly. You can go from being the No. 3 or No. 4 to the No. 1 just like that. You really can. James has done such a great job that he gets overtures every year. … It’s good to obviously be aligned with him.”\n\nFranklin discussed his plans openly with Pry, who said he was “fortunate” to be involved. Going to Penn State, however, was not guaranteed, as Franklin grew frustrated with how long it took the school to get through the process of vetting, interviewing and extending him an offer.\n\n“I remember there becoming a point,” Franklin said, “where I literally was going to walk away from the job because it was taking too long and I was involved in a couple jobs.”\n\nWhen conversations between Penn State and Bill O’Brien about continuing beyond the 2013 football season halted, Joyner quickly realized he would need to hire Penn State a football coach for the second time after the school previously had gone nearly half a century without a coaching change.\n\nUnlike the six-week search after the 2011 season — a timeline impacted by Penn State dealing with the fallout from the Jerry Sandusky scandal — Joyner vowed to move swiftly.\n\n“Bill was very respectful when he left and I appreciated that very much,” said Joyner, who now works in Florida as president of the Andrews Institute and senior vice president of Baptist Health Care. “It was his time, the right time for him to go to the pros, and I was not happy for us, but I was happy for him. … It was like, ‘Here we go again.’”\n\nCoaching searches are grueling for those tasked with finding the coach. Hiring a football coach means all other tasks except for emergencies are off the table, Joyner said. It’s also about fielding phone calls from intermediaries, some of whom have legitimate interest, some of whom don’t.\n\n“You do what you need to do to make it work and that’s kind of how things went,” Richardson said. “When you get the person that you want, you really got to go out there and do what you need to do to get it done.”\n\nSome applicants send handwritten letters to express interest. Joyner once received an application from a high-schooler who wanted to apply for O’Brien’s job. Unsure if he should be impressed by the forwardness or concerned about the lack of qualifications, Joyner wrote the teen back on Penn State stationary thanking him for his interest.\n\nFor however long it takes to make a hire, it’s like operating out of a bunker while denying any and all rumors of potential candidates and interviewees, Joyner said. When a woman whose son was friends with Joyner’s son reached out to offer an unsolicited endorsement of Franklin — the woman knew one of Franklin’s college teammates at East Stroudsburg — Joyner didn’t crack.\n\n“There are rumors floating around in the newspapers at that point,” Joyner recalled. “She said, ‘I can tell you he’s a fine man and he’s a great person, if you are talking to him.’ … I didn’t reveal anything.”\n\nWhen Penn State started forming a list of top candidates, it wanted to be sure to abide by what Joyner called an “unwritten rule” in the Big Ten. Penn State would first reach out to the athletic director to ask permission to speak to coaches — in this case, Williams to speak with Franklin. It was a formality, but it also showed respect for the other school.\n\nThat’s why when Joyner, Richardson and the rest of the search committee arrived at the hotel — careful not to wear anything with Penn State logos on it — Vanderbilt administrators at least knew of Penn State’s interest in Franklin.\n\n“It was not your typical football search,” Franklin said. “Typically with football searches, there’s a small group of people that are involved because you’re doing everything you possibly can to keep it quiet. Typically the people you want currently have jobs. … The schools that do a better job of keeping the process quiet are the schools that usually have the best chance of getting the best candidates.”\n\nSaid Joyner: “They always want us to work faster. I will offer this up: We were very careful about even when we had decided on James, we were very careful to protect Vanderbilt, and his players in particular. James wanted to be the one to tell them, which is much to his credit.”\n\nNevertheless, with television cameras on his lawn and Vanderbilt boosters and Williams, the athletic director, inside his home making one final push to keep him, Franklin’s exit from Nashville became a spectacle.\n\n“That entire week, because it became public, the media was stationed outside of our house,” Franklin said. “And then, I remember our staff going to the airport, the private airport, and there was media everywhere.”\n\nFranklin made up his mind around 7 p.m. that Friday and called Williams, like the head coach promised he’d do, and told the athletic director he was taking the Penn State job.\n\nFranklin wasted no time assembling his coaching staff. Within hours, Vanderbilt staffers were called to Franklin’s home.\n\n“All the staff was in the bottom and he would call ‘Joe Blow’ or whoever and then that person would walk up the stairs,” the source within Vanderbilt athletics recalled. “And he’d say something to the effect of, ‘I’m offering you the offensive line job. Here’s whatever. There’s going to be two planes at our airport tomorrow morning. I’m on one of them. And there’s another one and you’re either on it, or you’re not coming.’\n\n“We had a couple of assistant coaches who asked if they had any chance to stay at Vandy. But, of course, at that time it’s like, ‘Well, we can’t tell you that because we don’t know who the next coach is going to be.’”\n\nThere’s no easy way to part with a program, players and fans. As word traveled about a Vanderbilt football team meeting scheduled for Saturday morning and Penn State announced it would have a “major announcement” later that day, Franklin’s departure wasn’t a well-kept secret.\n\nFranklin said he saw Vanderbilt fans lined up outside the football facility as players filed in that Saturday morning. He wanted to go out and thank the fans but said he was advised not to.\n\n“If one or two fans don’t handle it well, it could get ugly,” Franklin said he was told. “I remember leaving without doing that and that left a bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths that I didn’t come out, because I do think most of the people were out there being supportive.”\n\nWithin hours, he was off to State College, where a new set of fans waited in the rain to greet him at the University Park Airport. This time, unlike days prior when Penn State fans waited at the private terminal late at night for a flight arriving from Destin, Fla. — one that contained only Joyner, Penn State president Rodney Erickson and a few search committee members, but not Franklin — Franklin stepped out of the aircraft. Joyner pumped his fist in the air.\n\nSurely exhausted from the previous week and from saying goodbye, Franklin pushed through and shook hands with the fans who waited to meet him. He met with the media later that day.\n\nBack in Nashville, his departure happened so quickly that Corbin didn’t even get to say goodbye to the man with whom he shared countless laughs during those three years. Shortly thereafter, a moving truck — decked out with Penn State signage on it — rolled into Franklin’s neighborhood. The big, bold Penn State logo was like twisting the knife for some Vanderbilt fans.\n\nCorbin was certain he and Franklin would remain close, and they have. A few weeks later, as Franklin lived in his office while putting his program together, the two talked on the phone. Corbin has been in State College several times since then, and Franklin is a regular at the College World Series, supporting his friend’s team in the offseason too.\n\n“It happened really quick,” Corbin said. “It’s not one of those things that you get emotionally scarred over because with him it’s like you pick up right where you left off. We both understand each other, and I certainly understood his situation because his world was about to get turned upside down.”\n\n(Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic)"
