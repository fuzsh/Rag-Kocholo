        "text": "Eight years ago, I met that one person that means the world to me. Our love story began April 2011 when James found my profile on an internet dating site and decided to email me. We emailed back and forth for a couple of days and then he finally called me. I felt like I was back in grade school and the guy that I liked finally talked to me. I was smiling from ear to ear the entire time we were talking on the phone. By the end of our phone conversation, he finally asked me out on a date. I can still to this day remember how nervous I was driving to his house to pick him up. However as soon as I pulled into his parentâ€™s driveway and he was standing there waiting to meet me, all my nervousness and butterflies in my stomach went away. From the very first hug he had ever gave me, I instantly felt safe and loved.\n\nJames surprised me with an entire weekend down in Clearwater, FL. He planned for us to have a private jet ski tour around Clearwater. I was so excited for this adventure because I had never been on a jet ski before. We spent the majority of the day exploring the gulf and seeing different islands collecting the best seashells. We were having the time of our lives. Later on that evening, James and I were back at the hotel getting ready to go out to dinner when I decided to be \"stupid\" and play the trust game. Now the trust game is when you have someone face away from you and fall backwards without any hesitation and the other individual is supposed to catch you. I started out and of course James caught me. Now it was James' turn to fall back and have me catch him. So I was waiting to have him fall backwards, but instead he turns around and gets down on one knee. He says to me \"Why do I want to show you that I trust you for a split second, when I want to show you I trust you for the rest of my life\". This is when he asked me to marry him. Of course I said YES!!!! He had originally planned to ask me later on in the evening, but he found this to be the perfect opportunity."
