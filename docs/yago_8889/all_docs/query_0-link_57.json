        "text": "When Sarah Josepha Hale looked back on her long life, she saw successful female leadership and profound energy. Through her role as an editor of The Ladies' Magazine and Godey's Lady's Book, she exerted influence over women’s education and political consciousness throughout the U.S.1 Audiences today may perceive her ideology as culturally or socially conservative. Nonetheless, in her time, her authority and her ideas broke down barriers for middle class women.\n\nSarah Josepha was born in Newport, New Hampshire, a small, productive riverside town. Her father, Captain Gordon Buell, served as an officer in the American Revolution before marrying Martha Whitilesey and becoming a tavern keeper. Gordon and Martha Buell believed in gender equality in education. Therefore, Sarah Josepha received home schooling not only from her brother Horatio, a graduate of Dartmouth College, but also from her mother. She then became a teacher. At 25 years old, Sarah Josepha married David Hale, a Newport attorney whose family helped found New Hampshire's Dartmouth College. The couple continued Sarah Josepha's parents' tradition, discussing academic questions between themselves and encouraging the curiosity of their five children.2\n\nBy 1822, the year David Hale died, Sarah Josepha had become a skillful writer. In 1823, her first collection of poems, The Genius of Oblivion, was published, thanks to financial support from David's Masonic Lodge. In 1827, her abolitionist novel, Northwood: Life North and South, so entranced the Rev. John Lauris Blake of Boston that he asked her to become editor for his new Ladies' Magazine. Her most famous book, Poems for Our Children, first published in 1829, included \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" still a popular nursey rhyme today.3\n\nHale used the Ladies' Magazine as a platform for socio-cultural editorials and advice columns, design and fashion critiques, and recipes and housekeeping advice. As the first female editor – or \"editress,\" as she preferred – of an American magazine,4 she became a national arbiter of good taste, manners, family life, and \"domestic science.\"5 This job kept her in Boston from 1828 to 1841. There, she published two further works, Traits of American Life (1835) and Sketches of American Character (1838),6 both of which featured the \"New Republic's\" ideals of American men and women's equality.7\n\nHale also engaged in local civic work. In 1833, she helped establish the Seaman's Aid Society in Boston's North End. This auxiliary to the Boston Port Society developed job training, financial opportunities, and social support for impoverished wives and children of sailors. It gave women the opportunity to keep their families fed, clothed, and housed.8 In the summer of 1840, a Boston women’s sewing circle of Seaman's Aid Society members, led by Sarah Josepha Hale, conceived of using a women’s fair to generate the $30,000 necessary to complete the Bunker Hill Monument. Through newspaper articles and letters, they contacted women's networks throughout New England and down the Atlantic coast.9 Six weeks later, the Bunker Hill Monument Fair successfully raised more than its $30,000 goal.\n\nAt mid-century, Sarah Josepha’s stance shifted to \"Victorian\" gendered territory. She had never been an advocate of women's involvement in political processes.10 While she belonged to a generation that could not stomach the progressive suffrage movement, she continued to support female education.11\n\nIn 1841, Hale's position as editor of Godey's Lady's Book (merged with the Ladies' Magazine in 1837)12 brought her to Philadelphia. As editor for the next 30 years, she influenced women across the U.S. and empowered them as agents distributing American national identity and culture. Hale encouraged women to write for Godey's and paid them well.13 Her extraordinary 900-page Women's Record: Sketches of Distinguished Women from the Creation to A.D. 1850 first appeared in 1853. This 'tour de force' demonstrated that women were intellectually equal to men. All they needed was education and a female sphere of independence.14\n\nHale crusaded for many years to make Thanksgiving, a symbol of national unity, a federal holiday. Started in 1846, this long-term trek finally reached its goal in October 1863, when President Lincoln released a proclamation. He declared the last Thursday in November Thanksgiving, as \"in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, the American people should take some time for gratitude.\"15\n\nSarah Josepha Hale retired from Godey's Lady's Book in December 1877 at the age of 89. She died in 1879, having made a huge impact on American middle-class culture and gender identity.\n\nContributed by: Polly Kienle, Park Guide\n\nFootnotes:"
