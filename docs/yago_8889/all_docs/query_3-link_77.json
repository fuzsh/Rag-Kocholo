        "text": "A Patriot of the American Revolution for VIRGINIA with the rank of CORPORAL.DAR Ancestor #: A041746\n\nPilot Knob, Sumner County, Tennessee\n\nJames Franklin came to Tennessee originally as a Long Hunter. These men were very much like the Mountain Men of the great Rocky Mountains in that they would go out to hunt and trade for a year (or longer) at a time. Hence, the name 'Long Hunter.'\n\nOn 640 acres land grant pre-emption on the West Fork of Station Camp Creek is where in 1788 James Franklin would build Pilot Knob, which is recorded to be the first brick home in Sumner County. It is there in 1789 that son Isaac is born and 4 more children would follow. (Sara, William, Betsy & Albert)\n\nJames Franklin could not read or write but he could farm and breed horses. These things he did successfully until his death in 1825. James Franklin is recorded as one of the first white settlers that helped found Sumner County. His marked grave still lies 300 yards south of his Pilot Knob home: the now Golden Era Plantation. His children and grand children would go on to make Sumner County one of the richest counties in the State of TN prior to the Civil War, becoming doctors, merchants and business men or in the case of the daughters, marrying the same. Their homes and farms still dot the Nashville Pike to this day on the West side of Gallatin, having been subdivided and some stripped of their historic designation.\n\nNotes\n\nDAR Vol 44 p230: James Franklin 1750-178? 5th VA reg 1778 born MD married in VA died in TN vol 76 p255 same James Franklin but says 1750-1819 died Sumter County, TN\n\nFamily\n\nMary3 Lauderdale (James Lauderdale2 Sr., James1 Lauderdale) was born Abt. 1762 in Botetourt County, VA., and died Bef. 1828 in Franklin, Sumner County, TN..

Martin, published by Silver Goblet Press, 2018.\n\n\"Restored in 2016 by the General Jethro Sumner Chapter of the DAR, the grave of James Franklin (1755-1828) resides in shadow. Patriarch of the Franklin family, James arrived in Middle Tennessee in 1779 after serving in Lord Dunmore's War and the Revolution. One of the Immortal Seventy, he defended Mansker's Station and other frontier sites from Indian attacks. With his wife Mary, from the eminent Lauderdale family of Virginia, he sired ten children in addition to one Franklin-surnamed son from a woman not his wife. Very close to the gravesite, their home \"Pilot Knob\" was heavily damaged in its long history by two tornado hits, and though portions of it are original, otherwise with newer construction it resembles little the house of James and Mary. It is now referred to as \"Golden Era Plantation,\" and until recently was the home of William Lee Golden of the Oak Ridge Boys.\"\n\nLinks"
