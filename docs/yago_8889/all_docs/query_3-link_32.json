        "text": "Is this a make-or-break year for James Franklin?\n\nWith a contract through 2031, and a team capable of winning double-digit games this fall, you wouldn’t think so.\n\nBut last week’s verdict in a lawsuit that awarded a fired Penn State team doctor $5.25 million in damages may have dealt Franklin a blow that hangs over him.\n\n(Unless, of course, he beats Ohio State, and good luck with that.)\n\nFranklin and Penn State were dismissed as defendants in the suit in 2020 due to the statute of limitations, and Franklin was not called to testify.\n\nBut his alleged actions were at the center of the case.\n\nFranklin was accused by Dr. Scott Lynch for meddling into medical decisions before Lynch was relieved of his duties as the Nittany Lions’ orthopedic surgeon and director of sports medicine in 2019.\n\nLynch and two other members of Penn State’s medical team at the time — Dr. Peter Seidenberg, the team’s primary care physician, and former head trainer Tim Bream — testified that Franklin pressured the medical staff to release players and tried to influence decisions.\n\nPenn State Health sided with Franklin and Sandy Barbour, who was then PSU’s athletic director, and fired Lynch.\n\nThe jury disagreed.\n\nPenn State Health said it was “extremely disappointed” in the decision and is considering an appeal.\n\nFranklin has said and is likely to say nothing, and it would be absolutely stunning if Penn State Health follows through on its mild threat to appeal.\n\nThat would drag the whole case up again and damage the reputations of Franklin and Penn State even further.\n\nOnce it gets to court, even more unflattering information could come out.\n\nSuch as when Franklin allegedly tried to pull the scholarship of a player who attempted suicide in 2017. Or that he hung up on Lynch during an attempted conversation about an injury to Rob Windsor, who testified that he felt pressured to play sooner than he was ready.\n\nThe defense rolled out two of Penn State’s biggest stars, Saquon Barkley and Trace McSorley, and neither felt Franklin exerted undue influence.\n\nAgain, though, the jury did — and that’s all the matters.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that, after Lynch’s dismissal, Penn State conducted an internal review in 2019 and found evidence of “friction” between Franklin and Lynch, a former PSU national champion wrestler.\n\nThe review could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions.\n\nNow there’s a shock because an in-house determination against Franklin could have been grounds for discipline, even a suspension.\n\nRegardless, rest assured those who govern Penn State can be none too pleased about what is a pretty awful look.\n\nIf you thought the fourth-and-5 call against Ohio State that sealed a 27-26 come from ahead loss in 2018 or — just as bad — with a 3-0 lead in 2021 against Michigan, at home, having the holder try to hit placekicker Jordan Stout with a pass on fourth-and-goal from the 1, this is worse.\n\nFranklin needs to stay in his own lane and concentrate on doing a better job on the field.\n\nHe’s 4-16 against the two teams he’s paid handsomely to beat — Ohio State, which is 9-1 against him with only a fluke loss via the blocked field goal, and Michigan.\n\nTo restore some public confidence, and considering a $700 million Beaver Stadium renovation looms, it would behoove Franklin to make sure the Nittany Lions’ record in big games starts matching all the talent he keeps shipping off to the NFL.\n\nThat might — might — help take some focus off the Dauphin County Court proceedings, announced last week.\n\nAnd though the $5.25 million won’t come out of his pocket — not that he can’t afford it — it’s an expensive stain on Franklin’s Penn State tenure.\n\nRudel can be reached at nrudel@altoonamirror.com."
