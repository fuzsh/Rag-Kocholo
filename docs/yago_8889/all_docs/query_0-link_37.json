        "text": "In 1845, Frederick Douglass published Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, and it received so much publicity his friends urged him to flee the country. He had put himself in danger by naming the names of people who abused him, with places and dates. On Aug. 16, 1845, he set sail for Ireland.\n\nDouglass was born a slave in Talbot County, Maryland, sometime in February 1818. By 1836 he was working in the Baltimore shipyards, turning over his wages to his master. At 20 he disguised himself as a sailor and escaped to New York by train. He married the free black woman who helped him to freedom, Anna Murray. They settled in New Bedford, Mass., and within three years he was lecturing across New England on behalf of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.\n\nFrederick Douglass in Exile\n\nHe spent two years in Great Britain and Ireland, lecturing about American slavery to packed houses. On April 16, 1846, he was in Glasgow, Scotland, and he wrote to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Though he starts out on a positive note, he quickly starts venting about his former master:\n\nMy health is good, my spirit is bright, and I am enjoying myself as well as one can be expected, when separated from home by three thousand miles of deep blue ocean. I long to be at home—”home, sweet, sweet home! Be it ever so humble, there is no place like home.” Nor is it merely to enjoy the pleasure of family and friends, that I wish to be at home: it is to be in the field, at work, preaching to the best of my ability salvation from slavery, to a nation fast hastening to destruction. I know it will be hard to endure the kicks and cuffs of the pro-slavery multitude, to which I shall be subjected; but then, I glory in the battle, as well as in the victory.\n\nBe It Ever So Humble\n\nDouglass then told Garrison that people had urged him to stay.\n\nI have been frequently counselled to leave America altogether, and make Britain my home. But this I cannot do, unless it shall be absolutely necessary for my personal freedom. I doubt not that my old master is in a state of mind quite favorable to an attempt at re-capture. Not that he wishes to make money by selling me, or by holding me himself, but to feed his revenge. I know he feels keenly my exposures, and nothing would afford him more pleasure than to have me in his power.\n\nHe has suffered severe goadings, or he would not have broken the silence of seven years, to exculpate himself from the charges I have brought against him, by telling a positive lie. He says he can put his hand upon the Bible, and, with a clear conscience, swear he never struck me, or told any one else to do so! The same conscientious man could put his hand into my pocket, and rob me of my hard earnings; and, with a clear conscience, swear he had a right not only to my earnings, but to my body, soul and spirit! We may, in this case, reverse the old adage—”He that will lie, will steal”—and make it, “He that will steal, will lie”—especially when, by lying, he may hope to throw a veil over his stealing.\n\nStaggered at First\n\nDouglass then described his shock at hearing his former master’s denials.\n\nThis positive denial, on his part, rather staggered me at the first. I had no idea the gentleman would tell a right down untruth. He has certainly forgotten when a lamp was lost from the carriage, without my knowledge, that he came to the stable with the cart-whip, and with its heavy lash beat me over the head and shoulders, to make me tell how it was lost, until his brother Edward, who was at St. Michael’s, on a visit at the time, came forward, and besought him to desist; and that he beat me until he wearied himself. My memory, in such matters, is better than his.\n\nOne would think, from his readiness to swear that he never struck me, that he held it to be wrong to do so. He does not deny that he used to tie up “a cousin of mine, and lash her, and in justification of his bloody conduct quote, ‘He that knoweth his master’s will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.’ ” He finds fault with me for not mentioning his promising to set me free at 25. I did not tell many things which I might have told. Had I told of that promise, I should have also told that he had never set one of his slaves free; and I had no reason to believe he would treat me with any more justice and humanity, than any other one of his slaves. But enough.\n\nRead the whole letter here.\n\nThis story updated in 2022.\n\nThe Boston Bruins brought the Stanley Cup – also known as “Lord Stanley’s Mug” – to Boston on April 16, 1939 after an absence of 10 years. It was the year the NHL introduced the best-of-seven playoff series, and the league was no doubt glad it did.\n\nThat 1938-39 Bruins team included Frank Brimsek at goaltender, nicknamed “Mr. Zero” for the number of goals he gave up. In 1939 he was Rookie of the Year, and he would be the first American inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nAt the other end of the age spectrum was veteran Eddie Shore, a bruiser famed for his defensive skill and his on-ice violence.\n\nThe Bruins had last won the Stanley Cup in 1929, having been eliminated from the playoffs seven times during the 1930s.\n\nThe Bruins luck changed in 1939, when they won the first three games of the playoffs. Then the Rangers came back to tie it up. The final game went into triple overtime and Mel Hill finished off the Rangers with a sudden-death goal. It was his third in the series, and earned him the nickname “Sudden Death Hill.”\n\nThe Bruins split the next two games with the Toronto Maple Leafs, but then beat them in three straight games. Bill ‘Cowboy’ Cowley, the Bruins star, led all playoff players with nine goals.\n\nThis story last updated in 2022.\n\nAnn Smith Franklin was actually one of two Franklins who left Boston for another coastal city to start up a newspaper and an almanac. The other was her brother-in-law, Benjamin Franklin.\n\nWidowed with four small children, she began publishing the Newport, R.I., Mercury. She also printed an almanac series, the laws of Rhode Island and the colony’s paper money, election ballots, legal forms and popular books.\n\nAnn Smith Franklin\n\nShe was born October 2, 1696 in Boston to Samuel and Anna Smith. Not much is known about her childhood, except she had a good education and she was a Puritan. At 26, she married James Franklin in Boston on February 4, 1723.\n\nJames had traveled to England in 1717 and brought back a printing press. He established the first independent New England newspaper, the Courant, with the help of Ann. His younger brother and indentured servant Benjamin also helped.\n\nThe New England Courant got James into trouble. He criticized the Puritan theocracy, and in 1722 he was imprisoned for a month for printing ‘scandalous libel.’ He continued to print ‘wicked’ articles, which continued to get him in trouble, and so in 1727 he and Ann took their printing press to Newport, R.I. His brother John Franklin, a tallow chandler, lived there.\n\nJames and Ann Franklin had five children while living in Newport, three of whom lived to adulthood. Together they launched the Rhode Island Gazette, the colony’s first newspaper, on Sept. 27, 1732. Ann helped James in his print shop. She set type, ran the press and sold their newspapers, books and James’ Rhode Island Almanack by Poor Robin.\n\nAnn Takes Over\n\nJames died in 1735 after a long illness. Ann took over the printing business, but didn’t make enough money to support her family. In 1736, she asked the General Assembly of Rhode Island for a contract:\n\nWhereas your petitioner being left with several small children which is a great charge to her, and having not sufficient business at the printing trade, humbly prays hour Honors will grant her the favor to print Acts of the Colony and what other things shall be lawful and necessary to be printed, in order for your Petitioner’s support and maintenance of her family, she having no other way to support herself.\n\nShe got the job.\n\nAs the official printer to the colony, she printed election ballots, legal forms and the colony’s charter. She revived the Rhode Island Almanack, though she gave it up after five years and instead sold her brother-in-law’s Poor Richard’s Almanack.\n\nIn 1745 she received her biggest commission: 500 copies of a folio edition of the Acts and Laws of Rhode Island, ‘Acts and Laws, of his Majesty’s Colony of Rhode-Island, and Providence-Plantations, in New-England, in America, Newport, Rhode-Island: Printed by the Widow Franklin, and to be Sold at the Town-School-House.’ She also printed sermons to supplement her income, and broadsides of private quarrels.\n\nThe Newport Mercury\n\nAnn’s son James went to Philadelphia to apprentice with his Uncle Benjamin. Meanwhile, her two surviving daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, helped her set type in the print shop. When James returned from Philadelphia in 1748, he ran the business, called ‘Ann and James Franklin.’ Ten years later they started a newspaper, The Newport Mercury.\n\nAs Ann approached her 60s, she turned more of the business responsibility over to her children, but all three died early. After James died in 1762, Ann went back to the printing press. She became the sole editor of The Mercury on Aug. 22, 1762, never missing an issue. She took on a partner, Samuel Hall, late in 1762, but then she died on April 16, 1763.\n\nHer obituary appeared in The Mercury. It described her as someone whose ‘economy and industry … supported herself and her family, and brought up her children in a genteel manner.’\n\nIn 1985, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Journalism Hall of Fame.\n\n* * *\n\nComing soon from The New England Historical Society.

This story was updated in 2024.\n\nTo the New England sports fan, the phrase ‘Havlicek stole the ball!’ is as profound and as personal as ‘Ask not what your country can do for you’ is to Irish Democrats.\n\n‘Havlicek stole the ball!’ was the most famous radio call in basketball history. The lore about it is as much about the colorful radio announcer Johnny Most as it is about the Boston Celtics’ all-time high scorer, John Havlicek.\n\nMost was the radio voice of the Celtics during the team’s golden era, from 1953 to 1990. Many fans would watch the game on television with the sound turned down and Johnny Most turned up.\n\nHigh Above Courtside\n\nJohnny Most was born on June 15, 1923 in New York City and named after his grandfather, Johann Most, an anarchist newspaper editor. After Most served with distinction as an aerial gunner in World War II, he went into broadcasting.\n\nHe established himself high above courtside in the old Boston Garden, back in the day when fans could run into players on the way to their seats. He called games in a voice that sounded like a cheese grater. His explanation: he gargled with Saniflush.\n\nNewspaper reporters who sat beneath Most had to dodge his long cigarette ashes that fluttered down through the floorboards. He once dropped a cigarette into his lap and set his pants on fire while on the air.\n\nHe was a notorious homer who — according to one referee — could cause a riot at High Mass. To Most, the game was a morality play in which his beloved Celtics were the good guys and the opposing players were thugs and cheats.\n\nHe didn’t like Lakers star Wilt Chamberlain one little bit. In 1969, the Lakers were favored to win the NBA championship. When the Celtics arrived at the Lakers’ Forum for the final game, they found thousands of victory balloons tied to the ceiling, the USC Trojan Marching band on the sidelines and cases of champagne stacked outside the Lakers’ locker room. During the game, Chamberlain famously left the court with a knee injury, but wanted back in when his replacement started producing. The Celtics won that game, and the championship. Most was not gracious:\n\nWe busted their balloons! The USC Band is packing their instruments and all the champagne has suddenly gone flat. And then there’s poor Wilt, who probably is icing his boo-boo right now while picking up a crying towel.\n\nJohnny Most was also a poet who published a volume of poetry called Feelings: Private Thoughts and Poems.\n\n‘Havlicek Stole the Ball’\n\nIt was on April 15, 1965 that Havlicek stole the ball, during the closing seconds of Game 7 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics’ lead had melted away to one point. Philadelphia had the ball out of bounds and a good chance to win. Philadelphia guard Hal Greer tossed the ball to Chet Walker, but Havlicek tipped the ball to Celtic Sam Jones in one of the greatest NBA plays ever.\n\nFrom his perch high above courtside, Most screamed over the WHDH airwaves:\n\nGreer is putting the ball in play. He gets it out deep and Havlicek steals it! Over to Sam Jones! Havlicek stole the ball! It’s all over. It’s all over! Johnny Havlicek is being mobbed by the fans!\n\nThe Celtics won, 110-109, and delirious fans carried Havlicek off the court. The Celtics went on to win their seventh consecutive championship.\n\nLater in his career Most was notorious for nicknaming opposing players. Magic Johnson was ‘Crybaby,’ Isiah Thomas was ‘Little Lord Fauntleroy’ and Washington Bullets players Rick Mahorn and Jeff Ruland were interchangeably ‘McFilthy’ and ‘McNasty.’ Most especially hated Detroit Pistons player Bill Laimbeer, a ‘dirty rotten player’ he nicknamed ‘Big Baby.’ (Watch Most trash the opposing teams here.)\n\nHe retired in 1990 due to failing health. Johnny Most died on Jan. 4, 1993, in Hyannis, Mass. John Havlicek died on April 25, 2019, having suffered from Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThis story was updated in 2023.

He stayed on in his remote beachfront cottage until autumn. Then he returned for an entire year, writing down his observations of the wind in the grass, the voice of the surf, the glittering stars, the faded bloom of the beach pea, the webbed impressions of a gull in the sand.\n\nIt was 1926, and Henry Beston was 38 and single. He would meld his notes into a literary classic when he returned, a book called The Outermost House. It would influence generations of nature writers such as Rachel Carson and lead to the creation of the Cape Cod National Seashore. It is still in print.\n\nHe was born Henry Beston Sheahan on June 1, 1888, in Quincy, Mass., to a middle-class family. His mother was French, and he eventually identified with his French heritage and dropped ‘Sheahan’ from his name. He graduated from Harvard and volunteered with the civilian ambulance corps in World War I.\n\nOutermost House\n\nAfter the war he bounced around, taking jobs as a teacher in France, a journalist, a fairy tale writer and a magazine editor. In 1925, he bought 50 acres on the coast in Eastham, Mass., and built a two-room cottage on the sand dunes two miles south of the Coast Guard station at Nauset.\n\nHe left the beach in the fall of 1927 with sheafs of notes but nothing publishable. He suggested to Elizabeth Coatsworth that they set a wedding date. She insisted he first write a book about his year on Cape Cod. “No book, no marriage,” she said. He published the book in the fall of 1928. They were married the following June.\n\nThe couple wrote books for the rest of their lives. Henry Beston died on April 15, 1968.\n\nHere is how he described an April morning:\n\nAn April morning follows, spring walks upon the dunes, but ocean lingers on the edge of winter. Day after day the April sun pours an increasing splendour on the ocean plain, a hard, bright splendour of light, but the Atlantic mirror drinks no warmth. A chance cloud upon the sun, a shadow, and the sea of an instant returns to February. No shadow of cloud may do the same upon the dunes. Under this April light the mound and landward slopes of the great wall have put on a strange and lovely colour which lies upon them with the delicacy of a reflection in the pool. This colour is a tint of palest olive, even such a ghost of it as one may see in spring on the hillsides of Provence, and it is born of the mingling of pale sand, blanched grass, and new grass spears of a certain eager green.\n\nThis story last updated in 2022.\n\nCelia Thaxter found solace, friendship and fame on the Isles of Shoals, a tiny archipelago off the coast of New Hampshire and Maine. She had grown up on one of the larger islands, White, the daughter of a lighthouse keeper. Her poems and stories about the island captivated her readers. And her island garden, which contained 57 flowers, inspired her artist friends.\n\nA letter to her friend Rose Lamb on August 29, 1889, typifies her island-inspired prose.\n\nTo-night there is the most delicious slender red crescent sinking slowly in the west, throwing a mysterious glimmer on the calm sea; there isn’t a whisper of wind, and it is balmy and beautiful; windows and doors all open; a most heavenly night. Now people begin to come and I must stop.\n\nCelia Thaxter, Early Life\n\nShe was born Celia Laighton on June 29, 1835, in Portsmouth, N.H. Her father, Thomas Laighton, was appointed lighthouse keeper on White Island. Celia only had her two brothers, Cedric and Oscar, to play with. Of her island life, she once wrote,\n\nOne of the first things a settler on the Isles of Shoals has to learn is to live as independently as possible.\n\nAt 16, she married her tutor, Levi Thaxter, a Harvard graduate 11 years her senior. He had come to the islands hoping to make money from the hotel Thomas Laighton was building on Appledore Island. Soon he tired of island life and persuaded Celia to move to the mainland.\n\nThey moved to Newtonville, Mass., and immersed themselves in Boston’s literary circles. At 17 Celia gave birth to her son Karl, who was injured during delivery. He was bright, but nervous, temperamental and dependent. Soon she gave birth to another son, John, and then her youngest, Roland, who became a prominent mycologist.\n\nLevi took the boys on long hunting trips, which Celia resented. She also hated living in Newtonville. She called her home ‘a household jail’ and complained of the ‘hideous ironing. ..the trinity of the soapkettle, the ashcan and the cookstove.’ She wrote a poem called Landlocked, which Levi discovered and took to publisher James T. Fields. He published the poem, and many others by Celia, in the Atlantic. Celia became friends with his wife, Annie Adams Fields, who ran a literary salon on Beacon Hill.\n\nBack to Appledore\n\nIn 1866, Celia’s father died and she spent more time on Appledore Island, helping her family with the hotel. Her growing literary fame attracted artists, writers and intellectuals, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Sarah Orne Jewett, James and Annie Fields.\n\nJohn Whittier showed her special kindness. The artist William Morris Hunt, a close family friend, visited the Isles frequently — and died there.\n\nHis student, portrait painter Rose Lamb, became a friend of Celia Thaxter’s. After her death, Lamb and Annie Fields compiled a book of her letters. In the introduction, they wrote, “Her “parlor,” as it was called, was a milieu quite as interesting as any of the “salons” of the past.”\n\nIn one letter to Lamb, on April 15, 1894, Celia Thaxter wrote,\n\nI cannot tell you how beautiful it is to be here, and I wish for you every day. It is so still and heavenly and fresh and full of promise. I work all day long, mostly out of doors, and there are so many pleasant things to do. Not easy, there is a great deal of hard work, but I love it all.\n\nChilde Hassam painted several pictures of her in her garden, which had its own celebrity. Its flowers filled the rooms at Appledore House. She wrote a book about it called An Island Garden, which Hassam illustrated. The Shoals Marine Laboratory, now on Appledore, has recreated the garden.\n\nCelia Thaxter and Birds\n\nCelia Thaxter grew outraged by the slaughter of birds for ladies’ hats, which she called “funeral pyres they carry on their heads.” She took the post of secretary of the Audubon Society of Waltham, Mass., in 1886. The next year she wrote an article for the first issue of Audubon Magazine called ‘Women’s Heartlessness.’\n\nShe also struck up a correspondence with Bradford Torrey, an ornithologist who published a popular book, Birds in the Bush. “I am all the time vexed at my ignorance, and wish somebody were here to tell me the different birds and recognize those delicious voices,” she wrote in a letter to him in 1890.\n\nHeavenly and Fresh\n\nBy 1893 she had grandchildren. “I don’t think I ever realized what “fun” was until I became a grandmother!” she wrote to her friend, Feroline W. Fox. “Isn’t it delightful?”\n\nCelia Thaxter died suddenly on Aug. 25, 1894 at the age of 59. Four months before her death she wrote to Rose Lamb.\n\nI cannot tell you how beautiful it is to be here, and I wish for you every day. It is so still and heavenly and fresh and full of promise. I work all day long, mostly out of doors, and there are so many pleasant things to do. Not easy, there is a great deal of hard work, but I love it all; and Karl is so good and helps me with the heaviest, and we have such a good time together.\n\nThe garden is a wilderness of sticks and stalks and rubbish from last year, and it is a job to begin, after pruning the roses, to clear all this away, to dig up the hollyhock roots that have sowed themselves outside and transplant in the inside of the fence, to fork over and manure all the earth, etc.\n\nI have my mother’s big, sunny room, with one opening out of it for Karl; and the large bay window is full of tables, and boxes of seeds that I am watching with as much delight as if I had never done it before. It is such a pleasure.\n\nI am busy every instant, so glad and thankful to be here. No tongue can tell it; just to be here, it is all I ask. Sometimes I am afraid I enjoy it too much, and wonder what ever would become of me if I had to be away.\n\nFlowers from her garden covered her coffin.\n\nThis story was updated in 2022.
