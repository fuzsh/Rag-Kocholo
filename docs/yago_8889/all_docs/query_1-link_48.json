        "text": "Margaret Ann “Margie” Franklin, age 78 FL passed away, October 10th after an 11 year battle with Alzheimer's . Born in Wilmington, NC, daughter of Broadus & Pauline Smith. She moved to Orlando in 1957 and was a graduate of Edgewater High School, Class of 1959. She attended F.S.U. and was an Alpha Gam Sorority member. Margie married Merrill Franklin in August 11, 1962. She was preceded in death by her parents and her husband, Merrill. Survived by her sons, Neil (Janet) & Chris (Felicia) and two grandchildren, Jennah & Noah.\n\nShe loved 7-11 Slurpees, Coffee Ice Cream, Subway sandwhiches and Chocolate Chips. She always had a small bowl of chocolate chips that she sometimes tried to hide but the grandkids always found. She was an avid gardener with a green thumb. She especially loved planting flowers that attracted Humming Birds. She played tennis for many many years and loved the game and the community of friendships that it brought. She loved FSU and was part of the Alpha Gam Sorority. She was thrilled when her granddaughter decided to attend FSU. She made the best Rum Cake and Corn bread. Although she will be missed, she is whole again in mind and body and with her husband. A service will be held November 9th 11:00 a.m. at First Baptist Orlando (Marie Williams Chapel).\n\nDonations made in her honor to adrccares.org. www.morrisfuneralchapel.com"
