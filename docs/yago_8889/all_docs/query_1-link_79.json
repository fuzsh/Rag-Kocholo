She was born in Winchester, Mass. on Sept. 3, 1945 the daughter of Norman and Eleanor (Rose) Harlow.\n\nAfter her family moved to Maine, Carolyn attended Edward Little High School in Auburn where she graduated in 1963. She married Stanley F. Maxwell and they began their life together on a small farm in South Livermore where they raised their children, many head of cattle over the years and always had a very large family garden.\n\nCarolyn worked various jobs when she wasn’t raising her children, including packing apples and being a Retail Clerk at JC Penney. She was also involved in the Boy Scouts when her sons were little, loved making crafts with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren and always enjoyed making her famous sugar cookies at Christmas.\n\nCarolyn loved to travel, especially with her friend, Joni Piepkorn and sister-in-law, Doreen Maxwell. Together they sailed aboard Princess Cruise ships to all parts of the Caribbean, Hawaii, Alaska and even Europe. They also took many bus trips together to places like Myrtle Beach, Kentucky, Prince Edward Island and the National Parks in the Midwest.\n\nCarolyn was predeceased by her parents; brothers David Harlow and Clayton Harlow and sisters Mary Harlow, Janet Smith and Cindy House.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Stan, of Livermore; her brother, Robert and wife Rosanne of Turner, her sister, Elaine and husband Lance of New York and her sister, Sandra and husband Phil of New Hampshire. She is also survived by her daughter, Sue Wheeler and husband Bill of Rome, and her sons Scot of East Livermore and John and his wife Shari of Leeds; grandchildren Christopher Wheeler and his significant other Anna Faulkner of Pittsfield, Danika Craig and her husband Colby of Manchester, Christina Dustin-Crocker and her husband Ron Crocker of Monmouth, Richard Dustin and his wife Danalea of Gardiner, Amanda Maxwell of Monmouth, Jamie Bilodeau of Fairfield and Richard Bilodeau and his wife Emily of Monmouth; many great-grandchildren; nieces and nephews.\n\nIn lieu of flowers,\n\nCarolyn requested that donations be made to the Dempsey Center in Lewiston."
