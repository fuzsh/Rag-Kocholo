James came back to the states after six months and he and Tommie enjoyed many fine years of travel and fun until she became ill and died in 1996. Finally, thanks to Janette Zukowski and Robert Dienelt, Jim met Marilyn Hostetler Dienelt whom he married in 1999. They too had many years of travel and fun until her passing in March of 2023.\n\nJames was an avid photographer, lover of music, taught Sunday School, ministered to Harrison County inmates, became a Deacon, sang in the choir at First Baptist Church of Long Beach and was an amateur wood worker.
