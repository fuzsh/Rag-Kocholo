        "text": "In this edition of Off Topic, we hit up James Franklin to discuss something apart from his job. For the uninitiated, the ground rules of Off Topic interviews are: No references to the sport, the employer, or anything else to do with the subject’s position. It must be a topic wholly unrelated to what the subject does for a living – in this case, head football coach at Penn State.\n\nWhen he expressed interest in doing an Off Topic, to be completely honest, Franklin’s suggestions were pretty lame. The man is a football freak to the point that he acknowledges having few outside interests or hobbies. So, his list of suggested topics consisted of:\n\n• Sickle Cell Disease (his younger daughter Addison is so afflicted)\n\n• Raising daughters (he and wife Fumi have two – Addy, 13, and Shola, who just turned 14.\n\n• Binge-watching Netflix shows (he has enjoyed The Queen’s Gambit, Peaky Blinders, Ozark, Lupin, Last Kingdom and A Handmaid’s Tale).\n\nWhile I didn’t regard watching TV as qualifying for a topic, I did think maybe if, say, The Queen’s Gambit spawned or rekindled an interest in chess, that could be perfect. Nope.\n\nI kept probing. Did any of the other shows generate an outside interest? Nope.\n\nThis sort of fascinated me, because Franklin is an inquisitive and clearly intelligent man, a lively conversationalist who can speak extemporaneously on a number of subjects. He just doesn’t have any intense outside interests or hobbies.\n\nSo, we settled on the topic of raising daughters. The interview took place on the evening of March 23 and has been slightly edited for brevity and clarity. My questions are in bold. Franklin’s answers are in normal typeface. My addendums are in italic.\n\nFor background, tell us about your family and those you grew up with.\n\nI was pretty much raised and surrounded by all women: My sister Debbie who actually lives in the house we grew up in [in Langhorne]. My mom has passed away. My mom was from Manchester, England. So, all my family in the U.S. are all my dad’s family, although my dad wasn’t around a great deal. The interesting thing is, my mom still stayed close with all the women on my dad’s side of the family. So, all my Thanksgivings and Christmases and holidays and summers were either in the Hill District in Pittsburgh or in Silver Spring, Md. With relatives – my Aunt LaWanda, my Aunt Romaine, my Aunt Malbadene, my Grandma Leoda, my mom Jocelyn and my sister Debbie. So, it was kinda all these women who stayed together.\n\nAll were your father’s family, with your mom and sister, then?\n\nMy dad was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Manchester, England and he met my mom, they eloped to Ireland, and then he brought her back to Pittsburgh. And they lived with my grandma. So, my mom comes and that’s sort of her experience.\n\nThen, my dad gets a job working for General Motors in Trenton, New Jersey. Then they move just outside of Philadelphia on the way to Trenton. So, literally everybody I was raised with in the US is on my dad’s side of the family. All my mom’s family’s in England.\n\nWhen my mom and dad didn’t work out, my mom was pretty much here on her own. Because she didn’t have any family here in the States.\n\nAnd what explains why she remained connected with your dad’s side of the family? She needed help, or what?\n\nWell, I hate to say this, but all the relationships in my family were divorced. So, all the women kind of stayed together. And I’d be sitting there at Thanksgiving and they’d all be sitting there, and my mom’d be smoking and they’d all be bashing the husbands. Then, they’d remember that I was sitting there, and they’d turn and go, ‘… but not you, baby. You’re gonna be just fine.’\n\nWhen you describe that, it reminds me of the scene in Jerry Maguire with all the women separated and divorced and generally contemptuous about the men in their lives and men in general, in the discussion group in the living room. I don’t want to put words in your mouth but was that what it was like?\n\nCorrect. Now that you say that, in some ways, for sure.\n\nAround how old are you then during those times?\n\nWell, it’s kind of a blur, because every Thanksgiving we’d spend in Pittsburgh with that whole crew. Or in Maryland with that whole crew. They’d travel together. They’re my dad’s cousins. And they all grew up on a cotton farm in Rocky Mount, N.C. We still have a family cemetery there. You can trace our family to there. We used to have a reunion on my dad’s side of the family. And in that cemetery, you can trace all the way back to the first free slave in our family.\n\nActually, my Aunt LaWanda moved back to the family property. She was the assistant dean of the engineering school at Howard [University]. My Aunt Romaine was administrative assistant at Howard for 35 years. Malbedene worked in admissions at Howard and then was a guidance counselor at Maryland.\n\nThey’ve all lived within a few miles of each other their entire lives and they all grew up picking cotton on this farm in North Carolina. Two got Masters degrees and one got her PhD. So, they were a big influence on me growing up.\n\nIt sounds like they were strong women. How do you think that affected your perceptions of women in general?\n\nI think it had a huge impact. I was the only person in my family to go to college. Though, my mom wasn’t formally educated, she was extremely strong. Because remember, she came here and then things didn’t work out with my dad for the most part; that’s a whole other story. But she was here on her own and kind of had to figure it out with no support system or anybody to fall back on. So, yes, I had strong women all around me. My sister, my mom, my aunts, all of them.\n\nI gave you the option of a topic, as I do all Off Topic participants. Why did you choose raising daughters?\n\nI think the biggest thing for me is that it’s all-consuming. I have my job and I have my family and I really don’t have any other interests or hobbies. For me, there’s really no other topic. I know, for instance, a lot of people like to golf, and I get that. But I really can’t justify the amount of time I spend at the office and then going to do something that takes four hours.\n\nFor me, that’s my sole responsibility is to be the best father I can be to two daughters, two African American daughters growing up in central Pennsylvania in a very complex world, probably more complex than ever. It’s very different than the one we grew up in.\n\nThe Social Dilemma is a documentary that taught us a lot about how social media platforms collect data on, groom and prompt users – especially middle-school-age kids – in sinister ways. They engineer the computer algorithms to keep feeding your kids whatever they respond to.\n\nIt’s scary for us. Our daughters are the only kids I know that don’t have cell phones at 13.\n\nTremendous. You’re brave. Why?\n\nBecause we’re trying to control as many variables as we possibly can.\n\nWell, obviously. But no one’s got the cojones to do that. You did it. Did Fumi do it or did you do it?\n\nWe both did it. The internet scares us. There’s just so much out there. You hear so many horror stories. Kids playing games. And even through the games, they can play someone else, and they don’t know who that person is.\n\nYeah, but the really scary stuff is manipulating your kids’ minds based on them wanting to be liked. And that is the addictive part of it.\n\nWell, the other thing that’s scary is the predator that’s online.\n\nYeah, well, that’s a whole other thing. I’m talking about kids wanting to be liked so much and having this quantifiable figure, these numbers of ‘likes.’ Sinister is the only word to use for me.\n\nOur kids, the staff, the players, I have 18-to-22-year-old males who can’t handle it. So, for us, we just made the decision we were going to go as long as we possibly could without it.\n\nWell, they must be flipping out. Aren’t they flipping out on you?\n\nNo.\n\nGreat. Why aren’t they? Everyone’s got cellphones but them.\n\nI think what helps is, Fumi and I, we’re not like these parents who say: ‘Wait ‘til your mother gets home.’ Or she’s: ‘Wait ‘til your father gets home.’ We’re both pretty strong. We’re both aligned with what we talk about. We did want to be able to call them. So, we were able to get these watches that we can program and set so they can only call us on them.\n\nWait a minute. How did you get them to go along with this?\n\nThey’re 13 and 14. Why should they go along with it?! I guess that’s my point. I just feel like, as a society, and as a country, we have started to become our children’s friends rather than their parents.\n\nWe’re very comfortable making decisions that they won’t be happy with. Like, I think a lot of parents don’t want their kids upset with them. Even though they know it’s the right thing to do.\n\nFumi’s been outside the house since she was 13 years old. We both come from what I guess you would call somewhat challenging backgrounds – family dynamics, financial issues, things like that. One of our strengths is, we’ve both been kind of resilient and have had to kind of overcome. And we’ve worked really hard to provide a lifestyle and opportunities for our children, which everybody tries to do. You work really hard to provide a better life for your kids than you had.\n\nBut then, your kids can turn into spoiled brats. So, one of mine and Fumi’s biggest fears is, how do we make sure our kids have this really good experience and have things and remove worries that we had growing up, but also make sure they’re grounded, good kids?\n\nSo, we’re both very intentional about these concerns we had. And I think that’s part of the phones and we want to know who they’re friends with, who they spend their time with. But then, you want to be careful not to go too far with it and they don’t get exposed to enough things. Then, they’re too sheltered.\n\nSo, I don’t know if we’re doing it right or not. We’re trying.\n\nI was watching a David Letterman interview on his Netflix show where he referenced his middle-school-age son and said, kind of joking but not completely: ‘Every once in a while, he just takes a swing at me.’ It can be a challenging age. Your body is changing at that age. Your mind is changing. You were a college Psychology major [at East Stroudsburg]. Do you think raising 13- and 14-year-old daughters is different than the same age sons might be?\n\nI struggle with that. And it doesn’t make sense to me.\n\nWhat doesn’t?\n\nI guess, what I’m saying is, there’ll be things going on with my daughters. And my wife will explain the changes that are going on. And it’s hard for me to have an opinion on something that I don’t really understand. But I have so much trust and respect and admiration for my wife that I just listen.\n\nYou don’t understand because these are intrinsic to the female experience? Is that what you mean?\n\nYeah, so when my wife talks about our girls going through puberty and the emotional effect of that, I don’t understand it. So, I don’t even really try to. So, when I feel myself wanting to say things? I tell myself: Just shut up. [my laughter] Because I’ve had to try to have the conversation with my wife. And it doesn’t go anywhere. She knows.\n\nThat’s what I struggle with. I’ve got really strong beliefs and opinions on how you raise kids. But there are aspects of raising daughters and women that I don’t get, and I don’t understand. But I have so much trust in my wife that I let her take the lead. Which doesn’t come naturally to me.\n\nNow, are they dating? It’s almost time for that.\n\nAgain, it’s hard for me to say this. Because, if this were a normal interview, I would say: Most likely. But, because of Addy’s Sickle Cell, we haven’t left our property since March [2020]. I’m over the garage. We have an apartment over the garage and that’s where I am; they’re at the house. We’re still separated.\n\nAre you getting your shot?\n\nIt doesn’t matter, because you can still carry the virus. And our daughters can’t get the shot because they’re underage.\n\nWe’ll still be separated and have been. The biggest treat that we’ve had is being outside since the weather’s broken. But I haven’t been able to hug my wife and kids or be close to them, really, since last March.\n\n[The one exception was late last summer for two weeks when the Big Ten canceled the football season. Franklin was tested twice, then resumed normal interaction until commissioner Kevin Warren reneged on the cancelation.]\n\nThey came back to State College about [in early March].\n\nIt must be killing you.\n\nI’m in a better place now. But it’s been a really challenging year from so many different perspectives. And I’ve always known that I’m a family guy. My wife and I, we don’t go out. Even in Nashville. I’m a homebody. I wanna be around the kids. And that’s where I get my fuel. I’ve always known that. But, for them being gone the entire year [at the family’s winter home in Florida from September to March], I realized more than ever. Even though I appreciate them like crazy, I still took them for granted and what they meant to me.\n\nLast thing: Kamala Harris – have you thought about what that might mean to your daughters to have a female of color be Vice President of the United States?\n\nYes. I mean, take the politics out of it with Obama. Take the politics out of it with Kamala Harris.\n\nFor that matter, we could pretend it’s Condoleezza Rice.\n\nThe fact that girls growing up in this country, young girls can look up in the White House and see somebody in that position. It’s no different than what Obama did for millions of young boys. To have them be able to say, literally: I can be that one day. There is somebody modeled in that responsibility, that role. And I can do that one day.\n\nIt becomes more realistic. It becomes more tangible. And now that you have a female Vice President of color, the next thing is, we’re going to have a President. So, I think it is really powerful. Again, take the politics completely out of it. It is really powerful whether it’s a person of color or it’s a female or whatever it is. To see people in these roles I think is really important.\n\nHave Shola and Addy said anything to you?\n\nI’m going to tell you something that broke my heart. With everything that was going in our country at the time, my wife was not comfortable watching it with our girls because she was afraid something was going to happen.\n\nYou mean during the inauguration?\n\nYes. It’s sad. But my wife was not comfortable watching that live with our girls because she was afraid that something might happen.\n\nWell, let’s be clear what you’re talking about. You mean an assassination attempt?\n\nI’m gonna say something happening that our girls could see that we could never...\n\nUnsee.\n\nYeah.\n\nUnderstood. Well, that’s it. We’re through. See, wasn’t this more fun than talking football again?\n\nIt was interesting, yeah.\n\nMore PennLive sports coverage:\n\n• Why did John Harrar and Seth Lundy stay at Penn State? They like the new coach, but love their old school.\n\n• It’s been a while since Penn State has had a pair of offensive tackles like Wallace and Walker."
