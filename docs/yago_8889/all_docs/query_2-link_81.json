        "text": "I decompose the market value of Colonial New Jersey&#39;s paper money into its component parts, namely its real-asset present value and transaction premium. Its market value was predominately determined by its real-asset present value. I also find a small transaction premium that is positively associated with the quantity of paper money in circulation and with the land-bank method of paper money injection. This paper money was not a fiat currency. It traded below face value due to time-discounting not depreciation.\n\nI answer Ron Michener’s criticisms of my article on colonial Maryland’s paper money regime coauthored with James Celia and published in Economic History Review in 2016. I deconstruct Michener’s criticism and locate where in the article it does and does not apply. I sort out Michener’s position on what determines a money’s value and question its coherence and logic. I also show that his position leads to an outcome that supports our position more strongly than does our own conservative approach. Finally, I explore in detail beyond the 2016 article what determined the fiat money portion of colonial Maryland’s paper money.\n\nWe argue that the Canadian experiment with paper money (written on the backs of playing cards) can inform the puzzle of low inflation in the American colonies that experimented with paper money. The major impediment to the debate over the Ameri-can experiment has been the limited data about prices and output—an impediment that does not exist for Canada thanks to recent works on its quantitative economic history (Geloso, 2016). We show that variations in the money supply (M) cannot fully explain variations on the right-hand side of the equation of exchange (P * Y) for Canada, which leaves an important role for changes in velocity (V). The pattern of the velocity of paper money is consistent with changes in the enforcement intensity of legal tender laws. We argue that this narrative can be imported for the American colonies.
