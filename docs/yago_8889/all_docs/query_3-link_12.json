        "text": "Penn State coach James Franklin has finally been reunited with his family — kind of. During an appearance in the NFL Network’s “NFL Now,” Friday, Franklin revealed that his wife and two daughters returned to the State College area late week after spending nearly a year away from the region due to COVID-19 safety concerns.\n\n“They just came back last Friday and surprised me — which was awesome and which was great,” Franklin told the NFL Network’s Kim Jones.\n\nHis youngest daughter, 12-year-old Addison, has sickle cell, an autoimmune disease. The CDC advises people of any age who are dealing with immune deficiencies and/or who may be taking immune weakening medications that they might be at a higher risk for COVID-19. So Franklin and his wife Fumi took no chances, as Fumi, Addison and 13-year-old Shola isolated “down South,” according to the coach.\n\n“So this has obviously been a challenge for everybody, really, in the United States, but really across the world,” Franklin told Jones. “Everybody’s had different challenges. You know, my family was gone since March. And that was hard, going through a season and going through it alone. You know, I had my football team and my coaches and my staff, but not my family. And my wife and my two daughters are what drive me and recharge me every single night.”\n\nFranklin was able to spend a few weeks with his family in late December into early January, but then had to return to Happy Valley for the start of the spring semester. Now that his family is back in their home just outside of State College, his wife and daughters are still social distancing from him. As difficult as that is, Franklin is trying to make the most of it.\n\n“We're still living separately,” he explained. “My youngest daughter has sickle cell disease and we just can't put her at risk. So I'm living over the garage. About the most interaction I get with them is I put my hood on and my COVID mask and I stand at the windows around the house and scare them in the middle of the night. That's about as much interaction as we're getting.\n\n“So I can't wait for us to get back to normal so I can hug them and they can be back around our program and around our players,” he added. “I miss them like crazy, but I know there's a lot of people that are (dealing with) challenges and sacrifices right now.”\n\nBack in November, Franklin admitted that being separated from his family was more difficult than he expected. But he ultimately realized he could still lean on his wife and daughters from afar.\n\n“Me and my wife had a really good talk the other night, which was great for me, because I've been trying to kind of insulate her from it and feeling like if I kind of went to her with it, that I would be putting that on her plate and my family's plate,” he said at the time. “But I'm not the best actor, you know, so it really wasn't working, anyway. So we had a really good conversation — that helped me.”"
