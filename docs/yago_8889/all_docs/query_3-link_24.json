        "text": "Penn State head coach James Franklin wanted to be at the draft parties for his two first-round picks Thursday night. But it would be a tall task to get the timing right â€” especially when the two players live an hour apart in Maryland.\n\nFranklin started off in Waldorf, Maryland, home of Olu Fashanu. The offensive lineman went No. 11 overall to the New York Jets, and the Nittany Lions head coach was there to see the announcement.\n\nThere was little time to celebrate with one of his former players. Franklin needed to head north to Gaithersburg, Maryland, a 57-mile drive, in order to be there for edge rusher Chop Robinson.\n\nAbout 70 minutes after Fashanu was drafted, Robinson was selected by the Miami Dolphins at No. 21 overall. Franklin made it to the party just before NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Robinson's name."
