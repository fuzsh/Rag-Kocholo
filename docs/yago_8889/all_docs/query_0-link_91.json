        "text": "WHEN BENJAMIN FRANKLIN DREW UP A CONTRACT to make David Hall the managing partner of the Philadelphia printing house in 1748, he promised not to become involved in other publishing ventures for the eighteen-year duration of the contract. However, he violated that covenant.1 Franklin&#39;s reasons for doing so emanate from his political involvements, his moral convictions, his civic loyalties, and his desire to leave his ideological stamp on German immigrants, who constituted a segment of colonial society Franklin thought particularly needful of moral education. When Franklin informed Cadwallader Colden of his decision to take &quot;the proper Measures for obtaining Leisure to enjoy Life and my Friends more than heretofore&quot; by turning over the Philadelphia printing house to David Hall and retiring from its daily labors at the age of forty-two, he was\n\nThis study offers a quantitative approach to mapping out and examining Benjamin Franklin's writing of his memoirs. It does so by situating the memoirs in the context of Franklin's other and indeed primary writing activities: his participation in various correspondence networks. Both drawing upon and differing from previous scholarship, this study ascribes key aspects of the memoirs less to intentional design and literary craft, and more to Franklin's writing habits and cognitive style as manifested over his career. This study further argues for a reconsideration of how Jane Mecom and William Franklin influenced the memoirs.\n\nI will begin this paper with a brief and partial history of American printing, detecting a shared predilection for a noticeably maverick relation to the printed page in the works (printed and otherwise) of Samuel Keimer and Benjamin Franklin during the colonial period, and the works of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson and Mark Twain in the nineteenth-century. I term the interrupted, dialectical printing that connects all of these writer/printers ‘not-printing’, and offer some explanation of his term and a description of some of its manifestations. I will then move on to consider how the idea of ‘not-printing’ might be helpful for the consideration of some contemporary British and American poets and printers before concluding with a description of some of the ways that the productive constraints of such a practice have influenced my own work as editor and printer at the Crater Press.\n\nArgument Apprenticeship was probably the largest mode of organized learning in early modern European societies, and artisan practitioners commonly began as apprentices. Yet little is known about how youths actually gained skills. I develop a model of vocational pedagogy that accounts for the characteristics of apprenticeship and use a range of legal and autobiographical sources to examine the contribution of different forms of training in England. Apprenticeship emerges as a relatively narrow channel, in which the master's contribution to training was weakly defined and executed conservatively. The creation of complementary channels of formal instruction was constrained by cost and coordination problems. When we consider a range of British youths who obtained advanced skills as artisan practitioners (and engaged in invention or pursuing natural philosophical interests), we see the importance of individual agency over institutional structures. For these youths, training could involve rejecting apprenticeship, engaging in periods of advanced study, including time in multiple workshops after the end of apprenticeship, and parallel campaigns to access scarce books and communities of scholarship.
