Thank you.\n\nJames and an unknown wife,[2] had the following children:\n\nJames Franklin was born 08 Jul 1682 in Dartmouth, Bristol County, Massachusetts.[3]\n\nLydia Franklin was born 18 Jun 1688 in New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts.[4]\n\nAbel Franklin was born 18 May 1690 in New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts.[5]\n\nHe married a second wife, Elizabeth Hammon on 17 Apr 1695 in Swansea, Bristol County, Massachusetts.[6][7] Note that this second source states his first wife's name was unknown.[2]\n\nJames had been a soldier in Phillip's War. On 9 December 1675 he was one of Captain Samuel Moseley's volunteer troopers and was present at the Great Swamp Fight later that month. On 24 August 1676 he had served under Captain Daniel Henchman in Captain Thomas Brattle's Company.[8] On 24 August 1676 his pay was assigned at Braintree, Massachusetts. This would indicate that at that date he was probably a resident of that town. He was evidently a young man at the time of the war. James was living in Rhode Island in October 1693 when he bought land in Dartmouth. In 1706 he was of Swansey. In 1710 he was styled \"cordwainer\" and was of Reheboth, but by 1716 had returned to Swansea. It seems probably that James Franklin was a brother of John Franklin of Swansea, cordwainer, who with his wife Ruth sold land there in 1717 and James Franklin was a witness.[9]\n\nIn the early 1700s, James sold land several times in Swansea, Bristol County, Massachusetts. On 4 Aug 1705, he sold land to John Brown. [10] On 7 Mar 1709, he sold land to Nathaniel Kingsley. [11] On 4 Oct 1716, he sold land to his son James Franklin Jr. [12]\n\nOn 28 May 1717, he witnessed a deed for John Franklin (probably a relative, possibly his brother ?) in Swansea, Bristol County, Massachusetts.[13]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Franklin, Benjamin, 1706-1790.
