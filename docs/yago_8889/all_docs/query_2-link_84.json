        "text": "Just like in Frederick Douglass life literacy plays an important role for Benjamin Franklin in his life. Although he lacks a depth of imagination and emotion, his literary talents are demonstrated in his preference for rational and ethical thinking. But his seriousness about the importance of literacy is demonstrated in his assertion of how much he learned from reading through his pamphlets. In the end both men contributed amazing moral and ethical philosophy’s that are still in effect today in our society’s and those are the fact that hard work and perseverance in the end pays\n\nSo young Benjamin used a false name and slid them under the factory’s door at night to get them published. After relations with his brother got sour he left Boston and moved to New York then to Philadelphia. He worked in Philadelphia for sometime then left to London in hopes to secure his own printing shop. After plans fell through and being very short on cash, he decided to stay in London until he was able to pay his way home. When he returned he got married to Deborah Reads, girl he met and fell in love with many years earlier. He worked in many other printing shops publishing his works until his career really took a turn for the better when he joined the Free Masons. He was elected the leader very shortly after. During this time he wrote the agreement for the Library Company of Philadelphia and this became the first public library in America.\n\nAs Franklin’s printing business prospered, he became more involved in civic affairs. Starting in the 1730s, he helped establish a number of community organizations in Philadelphia. This includes a lending library, the city’s first fire company, a police patrol and the American Philosophical Society, a group devoted to the sciences and other scholarly pursuits. Franklin also organized the Pennsylvania militia, raised funds to build a city hospital and spearheaded a program to pave and light city streets. Also Franklin was instrumental in the creation of the Academy of Philadelphia, a college which opened in 1751 and became known as the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\n\nThroughout his lifetime, Benjamin Franklin always participated in bettering his nation. He would take on many political tasks at a time and would still find time to help local communities that were at a standstill with development. Early in his life, Franklin organized a group of diverse friends that all desired some type of improvement for themselves and the community. They called themselves The Junto and eventually helped the formation of Philadelphia’s first circulatory library. Although this may not seem to have a momentous effect, the\n\nThe visionary outlined his plans for the institution in a reading titled, Proposals relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania. As a means of resolving public health issues and providing care for the physically or mentally ill., Franklin constructed the idea for the first map for a public hospital in Pennsylvania. The final bit of philanthropic advice given from Franklin outlines a list of the 13 virtues necessary to live a virtuous life. Franklin mastered all of the virtues on his list and felt that others could benefit from his system “not [by] attempting the whole at once, but [by fixing] one of them at a time” (Franklin, 96). As a philanthropist, Franklin continuously sought after ways to improve his community. With the help of his Junto, Franklin succeeded in leading new undertakings of social advancement. “He expressed his hope to produce something for the common Benefit of Mankind” (Franklin, 6).\n\nBenjamin Franklin was one of the most influential men of the eighteenth century. He was the only man to sign all of these four major documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Constitution of the United States, and the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain. Franklin was an inventor, a philosopher, a writer, a musician, and he actively participated in many congressional articles used by the government of the United States of America. His tombstone, however, simply referred to him as \"printer\", reflecting his great humility. One of the things he was most influential in was the separation of the American colonies from British rule. In fact, Benjamin Franklin was vital to the success of the American\n\nFranklin was involved in many well-known public projects. In 1731 he founded what was probably the first public library in America, chartered in 1742 as the Philadelphia Library. He first published Poor Richard’s Almanack in 1732, under the pen name Richard Saunders. This volume quickly gained a reputation for its practical wisdom. In 1736 Franklin became clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the next year he became the deputy postmaster of Philadelphia. About this time, he organized the first fire company in that city and introduced methods and ideas for the improvement of street paving and lighting. Always interested in scientific studies, he devised a means to correct undue smoking of chimneys and invented, around 1744, the Franklin stove, which furnished greater heat with a reduced consumption of fuel.\n\nThe allusion to readings beyond the Bible is a great indicator of the importance of education, to Bradstreet and Franklin. Books and education play an enormous part in Franklin’s life. In fact, the founding of the first circulating library solidifies the importance. The extent of his education is demonstrated with the allusion to other writers and philosophers such as Anthony Collins, Cotton Mathers, and John Bunyan ; in doing so, he is boasting his education and encouraging others to emulate him. Franklin’s’ “... first collection was of John Bunyan’s Works…” and reveals that he is reading beyond religious scripture(Franklin 312). As part of the Enlightenment movement, it was easier for Benjamin Franklin to read and mention other\n\nIt was the year 1706 in Boston, MA when Benjamin Franklin entered the world. Birthed after fourteen other siblings, Franklin's family structure is only one deciding factor in the way that this legendary tale pans out. A hero of American Revolution, this novel depicts 18th century realism accurately while logging Franklin's personal conception on human nature and social community. Many look at Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography as your typical rags to riches tale yet, the truth and falsehood throughout the pages is unknown, raising many questions and concerns. As this book was written in segments over a stretched period of time, we must analyze this account of his life, the struggles and successes which took place, and the outcome of such\n\nIn spite of the fact that Franklin was hardly a puritan, he was nevertheless very much a child of the Puritans. This is not displayed merely in his promotion of the virtues, but in his abstaining from excessiveness in eating, drinking, conversation, or whatever. Franklin is strongly influenced with self-governance In numerous ways, this is, to someone coming to it for the first time, a very amazing book. Franklin is, of course, one of the most celebrated Americans who ever lived, and his credentials in a wide arrangement of endeavors are a part of American knowledge and popular history. A great deal of this knowledge and numerous of his accomplishments are missing from this account of his life. He never finished the autobiography, earlier in his life on account of the fact that he was too engaged with what he terms public employment’s, and later in life by virtue of the opium he was taking for kidney stones left him incapable to concentrate adequately. Had Franklin been able to write about every period of his life and all of his achievements, his autobiography would have been one of the most exceptional and outstanding documents every produced. It is astonishingly imperious. However, his record as an office-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance his relatives. He was one of the most important statesmen in the new America and was a historical figure who shaped our nations history. He was a very"
