His youngest daughter, who is 12, has sickle cell disease, a blood disorder that puts her at risk for complications from the virus. Franklin said they made the decision to separate because it's \"the right thing to do for my daughter.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of tears. There was a lot of emotion having this conversation with my daughters,\" Franklin told \"Real Sports\" in a segment that aired Tuesday night. \"So a lot of heartache over it.\""
