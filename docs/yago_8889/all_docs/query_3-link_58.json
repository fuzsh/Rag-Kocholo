        "text": "Vanderbilt head football coach James Franklin created a stir this week when he said that he will hire an assistant only if the assistant has an attractive wife.\n\n\"I've been saying it for a long time, I will not hire an assistant coach until I've seen his wife. If she looks the part, and she's a D-I recruit, then you got a chance to get hired. That's part of the deal,\" Franklin said in an interview on Nashville's 104.5 FM The Zone on Wednesday.\n\n\"There's a very strong correlation between having the confidence, going up and talking to a woman, and being quick on your feet and having some personality and confidence and being fun and articulate, than it is walking into a high school and recruiting a kid and selling him.\"\n\nSince the comments gained national attention, Franklin has backed off. Thursday he took to Twitter to apologize.\n\nYet what Franklin doesn’t realize is that not only were his comments out of bounds as far as objectifying the wives of potential employees, they also made no logical sense.\n\nJust think about Franklin’s reasoning for a moment. He believes that a guy with an attractive wife has the skills to land top recruits. That’s simply not going to happen at Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt is Vanderbilt and it will never reel in top-level recruits like Alabama, LSU or Florida, no matter how attractive their coaches' wives may be.\n\nWhat Vanderbilt should be looking for are players who don’t necessarily look the part and have been passed over by more desired programs. Players with intangibles. Players who are willing to work hard and can be coached up. Players who have more to offer than just jaw-dropping physical attributes. That’s how a program like Vanderbilt wins. They find something great in players no one else believed in.\n\nSo if Franklin was serious about his hiring approach, he instead needs to start hiring coaches with unattractive wives. He needs coaches who were able to see past an initially undesirable exterior into the heart and soul of their mate. He needs assistant coaches with wives who might be horribly ugly yet have great personalities.\n\nHe also probably needs to stop doing radio interviews for a while."
