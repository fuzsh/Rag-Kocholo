Nestled in European Istanbul, the vibrant neighbourhoods of Beyoglu beckon visitors with rich history, diverse culture, and dynamic urban landscape. From the bustling streets of İstiklal Avenue to bohemian Cihangir, Beyoğlu is a melting pot of influences that has captivated travellers and foreign residents for centuries.

Beyoğlu's roots refer to ancient periods when the area was called Pera, a Greek term meaning "the other side" about the location across the Golden Horn from Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). Over centuries, Pera evolved into a cosmopolitan hub, attracting merchants, artists, and intellectuals. Beyoglu was also the first place to have an underground railway.

During the Byzantine and Ottoman periods, Beyoğlu flourished in commerce and culture, with its strategic location along trade routes contributing to its prosperity. In the 19th century, the district underwent rapid modernisation, thanks to the construction of the Galata Bridge and the development of İstiklal Avenue, which became the main thoroughfare through the neighbourhood.

Beyoğlu occupies a strategic position bordered by the Golden Horn with stunning views to the north and the Bosphorus Strait to the East. The central location makes this area a key transportation hub and commercial centre. According to the latest census data, Beyoğlu is home to over 250,000 residents of various ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds. The district's population also swells daily with commuters, tourists, and students. Indeed, if Beyoglu is on your radar, whether you are thinking of visiting or buying property, here is what to know.

Taksim Square- The Heart of Beyoglu

Locals view Taksim with high regard because the square holds the iconic Republic statue and is a familiar meeting place for friends. Built in 1928, the statue signified five years of the newly formed Turkish Republic after a bloody independence war against Allied forces. Taksim Square is also a key player in social gatherings, especially on New Year's Day, during the annual Labour Day, or during the LGBT parade. On the edge of Taksim Square sits the newly constructed Ataturk Cultural Centre, which displays the best Turkish architecture.

Istiklal Street - The Most Famous Steet in Turkey

Taksim is also the beginning of Istiklal Street, leading through the Beyoglu district and separating various neighbourhoods. Also called Turkey's most famous and busiest street, Istiklal is widely symbolised by the distinctive red tram in most travel guides and books and by the notable Galatasaray High School, a prestigious place of education in Istanbul. Stretching for 1.4 kilometres, everything and anything is to be found here.

Millions of pedestrians walk the street every day to access places of work or the untold number of shops, cinemas, and restaurants lining both sides. At night, the street stays as a bustling hub for bars, playing live music and traditional meyhanes serving food. These days, its reputation as Istanbul's centre of lifestyle and leisure is hard to ignore.

Further towards Taksim and built in the early 20th century in a Venetian neo-gothic style, the Saint Anthony of Padua church, the largest Catholic church in Turkey, promotes a surreal and humble experience, thanks to interior glass windows, immaculate wooden pews, and quiet ambience. Sitting directly on Istiklal Avenue and open daily for viewing, be silent when entering.

Focusing on evening entertainment, Cicek Pasaj, translating into Flower Passage, gained its name during the early 20th century from Russian immigrants selling flowers there. These days, as home to traditional meyhanes serving Turkish mezes (appetisers) and main dishes, the building lends to a more historic atmosphere while dining.

For delightful bars, head back to Nevizade Street, a favourite place for locals at night. Alternatively, further along Istiklal Avenue and near Galatasaray High School, down a few side streets is quirky French Street (Cezayir Street) that likewise offers traditional Turkish dining, often accompanied by live Turkish music. The street gained its name because of its unique architectural styles, but one cannot expect the ambience of France.

A few streets back, the Pera museum, which opened in 20005, portrays fine art in Turkey. Featuring ancient Turkish art, they also aim to promote up-and-coming artists with exceptional talent. The Tortoise Trainer, painted in 1906 by Osman Hamdi Bay, is their most famous painting. It was bought in 2004 for 3.5 million dollars and is an iconic piece often featured in most books about the Ottoman Empire.

Built-in 1348, traditional Turkish dance shows featuring Anatolian folklore and belly dancers make the Galata Tower a popular dining establishment at night. However, book tickets well in advance.
