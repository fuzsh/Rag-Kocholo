        "text": "Shopping in Istanbul is a unique experience – however it's done. The one-time capital that straddles two continents and has seen the rule of multiple empires is a mash-up of influences. Alongside the historic spice bazaars and street-sellers are an every-growing number of curious boutiques and high-end shopping havens. These are the makers shifting tradition with their own perspective in Turkey's most frenetic and fascinating city of Istanbul right now…\n\nFey\n\nBest for: true turkish style\n\nIn high-style Nisantası is Fey, a basement store with racks dedicated to chic, made-in-Istanbul collections. Visitors can find classic button-down shirts, watercolour-printed A-line skirts, and asymmetrical peacoats. The shop was founded by designer Fatos Yalın, former fashion director of Turkish Marie Claire, and is the only place to buy her engineered ballet flats and one-off raffia skirts. It also offers a curated selection of mid-century jewellery. Upstairs is a line of furnishings and menswear from Yalın’s husband’s brand, Arkun.\n\nAddress: Fey, Harbiye, Mim Kemal Öke Cd. No:9, 34367 Şişli/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: fey.com.tr\n\nA La Turca\n\nBest for: curiosities\n\nSet on a curved cobblestone lane in arty Çukurcuma, antique crafts store A La Turca occupies a four-storey, late-19th-century house that was bought and restored by Erkal Aksoy in the mid-1990s. The bulk of his collection is Anatolian kilims (flat-woven Turkish carpets), with more than 100 wrapped up in bales and tied with twine, but the place is filled to the rafters with glazed pots, brass-pedestalled globes and quirky tableware too. The basement is stocked with ceramic urns of all shapes, sizes and colours, and has a small garden. Upstairs, customers are welcomed into a cosy sitting room setup with vintage leather sofas, and the top floor features – among more kilims – a selection of time- and globe-spanning oil paintings.\n\nAddress: Alaturcahouse, Kuloğlu, Faik Paşa Cd. No: 4, 34433 Beyoğlu/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: alaturcahouse.com\n\nMisela\n\nBest for: bags of colour\n\nIn historic Beyoglu, Misela’s handbags fuse fresh contemporary styling with traditional Turkish methods. At the centre of the store is a round table covered in colourful clutches, and a large painting emblazoned with its logo: the çintemani, an ancient Turkish symbol made of three circles that represents abundance, among other things. Highlights include sunlounger-stripe fabric box clutches, pastel top-handle bags with contrast fastenings, and embossed bucket bags with bright tassels. Individuality and personalisation is at the heart of the brand: the signature Anatolia bag can be custom-made in 12 different shades, with more than 80 possible stitching colours and the option of monogramming.\n\nAddress: Misela, Evliya Çelebi, Meşrutiyet Cd. 107E, 34430 Beyoğlu/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: misela.com\n\nAtelier Rebul\n\nBest for: mixing scents\n\nIstanbul’s Karaköy shoreline has been on the up for years, driven by Galataport, a massive subterranean cruise terminal complex. The vast space above ground is home to the Renzo Piano-designed Istanbul Modern museum and a former post office that now hosts some of Turkey’s buzziest fashion labels, including Arzu Kaprol and Mehtap Elaidi, making it one of the best places for shopping in Istanbul. A must-visit is Atelier Rebul, one of the country’s most beloved beauty brands, which was founded during Ottoman times in 1895. The store is designed to resemble an old-world apothecary, with vintage bottled fragrances and a pharmacist mixing bespoke scents.\n\nAddress: Atelier Rebul Galataport Parcel Post Office, Karamustafa Paşa Mah., Kemankeş Cd. No:42, PP/Z21 Istanbul Turkey\n\nWebsite: atelierrebul.com.tr\n\nBegüm Khan\n\nBest for: wild inspiration\n\nAcid-green paint and a flashing neon flying scarab signal entry into the world of jeweller Begüm Kıroglu. Her flagship boutique, Begüm Khan in Nisantası, is an ode to her unconventional botanical and animal influences. The larger room of the store contains exhibit-style cases, displaying dramatic pieces shaped like tropical frogs, snakes and insects, as well as Far Eastern flowers such as orchids and lotuses. There is also an extensive collection of evil-eye jewellery, oversized pharaoh cuffs and maximalist earrings in praying mantis, jellyfish and shell designs.\n\nAddress: Begüm Khan, Harbiye, Mim Kemal Öke Cd. 14/3, 34367 Şişli/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: begumkhan.com\n\nHouse of Junk\n\nBest for: pre-loved pieces\n\nAslı Atamer turned her Istanbul family villa in the leafy northern neighbourhood of Zekeriyaköy into House of Junk: a revolving door of eccentric accessories, vintage finds and homeware she scooped up on her travels. Upstairs is still kept as private bedrooms, so the shopping happens in the open-plan living room, where mid-century credenzas are strewn with straw hats, palm-tree lamps and quirky candlesticks, and brass hat stands hold blazers and flapper dresses encrusted with beads. One day there might be a velvet egg chair, another a painted totem pole, and the basement is jam-packed with neon signs, vintage slippers, antique toys and medical mannequins.\n\nAddress: House of Junk, Uskumruköy, 6. Cd. no:10, 34450 Sarıyer/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: instagram.com\n\nNishane\n\nBest for: globe-spanning fragrances\n\nMert Güzel and Murat Katran, founders of Nishane, don’t believe in boundaries. Their unisex perfumes seek to bridge divides, with popular fragrances including the Armenian-made Ani and Ege (meaning Aegean), which has packaging that features its name printed in both Turkish and Greek. Many of the brand’s spellbinding, highly concentrated scents refer to Anatolian culture, including Hacivat and Karagöz, named after traditional shadow puppets, and Hundred Silent Ways, a quotation from Rumi. The sleek store on Ahmet Fetgari also stocks the Home Collection: eight fragrances inspired by different global cultures.\n\nAddress: Nishane, Teşvikiye, Ahmet Fetgari Sk No:51/A, 34365 Şişli/İstanbul, Türkiye\n\nWebsite: nishane.com\n\nNackiyé\n\nBest for: statement pieces\n\nSisters Defne and Basak Kocabıyıkoglu are the cofounders of Nackiyé, a womenswear store in the style-forward Besiktas district, named after their great-grandmother and with a focus on wearable statement pieces. They mix and match prints and silhouettes, including roomy Patmos trousers, their shape inspired by harem pants, and pleated strapless tops in wallpaper-print jacquard. Dresses can be cinched at the waist or left to billow, worn over trousers or matching long-sleeved tops. The sisters’ signature style is undone, with pieces bearing visible stitching or unfinished hems.\n\nAddress: Nackiyé, Vişnezade, Süleyman Seba Cd. No:19, 34357 Beşiktaş/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: nackiye.com\n\nDank!\n\nBest for: unreal interiors\n\nDank! is a trove of modern and retro home furnishings displayed in a jumble of tiny pseudo-living-spaces. It’s an alternative to a certain Swedish brand, describing itself as a protest against the frenzy of consumption, and invites visitors to sell their unwanted items on consignment. The hangar-like store is filled with second-hand designer furniture as well as new items from closing-down sales. There’s a vast array of geometric Turkish carpets and kilims, plus smaller home accessories such as vases, glassware and a sought-after selection of vintage lamps.\n\nAddress: DANK!, İstinye, Balabandere Cd. No:17 D:17, 34460 Sarıyer/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: dank-design.com\n\nHaremlique\n\nBest for: a dreamy night's sleep\n\nFor finishing touches to a Dank! room, Haremlique sells the city’s best-quality Turkish-made bed linens at the Zincirlikuyu area’s Zorlu shopping centre. Prints are named after districts of Istanbul, or feature Aegean- and Ottoman-inspired patterns. There are also embroidered napkins, and robes and kaftans from the capsule line Haremlique A La Mer.\n\nAddress: Haremlique, Levazım, Koru Sok. Zorlu Center No:2 D:194, 34340 Beşiktaş/İstanbul\n\nWebsite: haremlique.com\n\nSiedres\n\nBest for: contemporary clothing\n\nTurkish fashion labels have been on the rise for a few years. Among the emerging big hitters is Siedrés, which has earned a cult following for its Ganni-meets-Mediterranean aesthetic. Taking inspiration from the people and places along the Aegean coast, Ceylin Türkkan designs poplin tunics, shawls and salwars in summery Seventies florals and hippie silhouettes, which are made in small suburban factories. Set inside the former studio of sculptor Hüseyin Anka Ozkan, the boutique looks onto tulip-filled Emirgan Park.\n\nAddress: Stockists include V2K Designer Stores in Istanbul\n\nWebsite: siedres.com\n\nAt the heart of buzzy restaurant quarter Arnavutköy is Wohha (loosely translating to ‘high energy’), a pottery studio and café serving cappuccinos in its own quirky mugs. The ceramics, from plates to plant pots, are finished with a lead-free glaze, and runs are limited to minimise waste. In the past, the store has collaborated with Istanbul companies such as garden shop Labofem for a line of clay planters and aromatherapy brand Prana Vibes to create evil-eye-painted incense burners.\n\nAddress: Wohha, Arnavutköy, Abdülhak Molla Sk. No:9 D:11A, 34345 Beşiktaş/İstanbul, Turkey\n\nWebsite: wohha.com\n\nAnim\n\nBest for: tableware and tasteful frocks\n\nAfter a stint in Los Angeles, Mina Dilber Temo launched Anim, whose name is based on the Latin word for spirit, to blend her family’s textile heritage with a West Coast vibe. Tableware is at the core of the range: gingham coasters; raw-linen place mats; scalloped-hem napkins stitched by craftspeople.\n\nAddress: Anim, Sinanpaşa Mahallesi, Süleyman Seba Cd. No:6 D:aire 9, 34353 Beşiktaş/İstanbul, Turkey\n\nTelephone: +90 532 512 38 39\n\nWebsite: animliving.com\n\nThe Space\n\nBest for: streetwear"
