Istiklal street\n\nUntil the 19th century, these cobbled streets were referred to as the Grand Rue De Pera. The Turkish government renamed this street â€˜Independence Street, â€˜ which is now translated as Istiklal Avenue or Istiklal Street.\n\nThis pedestrian avenue used to be the gathering place of intellectuals of both Ottoman and European origin. It may be no surprise, then, that it continues to host the Istanbul Film Festival, Istanbul Pride, and a variety of other protests, marches, events. Its historic buildings, which date to the Ottoman Empire, now have trendy restaurants, cool cafes, fabulous shops, art galleries, and bookstores.\n\nIf youâ€™re interested in historical buildings, you may wish to check out the variety of churches, cathedrals, consulates, and synagogues along the avenue. Alternatively, you may want to visit the famous fish market. Youâ€™ll find Galatasaray square in the center with breathtaking gates to the famous high school.\n\nIstiklal Avenue is also famous amongst tourists for the historic tram that still operates.\n\nRelated content: 10 Best Hamam in Istanbul & Turkish Bath First-Timer's Guide\n\n2. Cihangir and Ã‡ukurcuma neighborhoods\n\nThe Guardian considered these neighborhoods as being one of the five best places to live. Perhaps itâ€™s because these neighborhoods have a similar vibe to Montmartre, Paris. The height of fashion in these spots is the luring Bohemian streets. Youâ€™ll find a selection of writers, actors, and artists in these spots.\n\nOne of the main attractions is the Museum of Innocence. The widely acclaimed documentary, Kedi, about street cats was mainly filmed in Cihangir.\n\nIn Ã‡ukurcuma, youâ€™ll find a collection of antique shops as well as 19th-century German architecture. The history of these streets dates back to the famous architect of the Ottoman Empire, Mimar Sinan.\n\nRelated content: Istanbul Markets: 20 Best Bazaars Every Traveler Must Visit\n\n3. Galata Tower\n\nWithin walking distance of the largest synagogue in Turkey, the Neve Shalom Synagogue, is the famous tower once the tallest building in Constantinople.\n\nAllegedly the Galata Tower is the spot where HezÃ¢rfen Ahmed Ã‡elebi built his artificial wings and flew. We wouldnâ€™t recommend following his example. Instead, why not eat in the restaurant on the upper floors.\n\nIf you do visit the tower, youâ€™ll be welcomed with the magnificent skyline of Istanbul â€“ from the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet cami), the Hagia Sophia, the Basilica Cistern, the Galata Bridge on the Golden Horn to the marvelous DolmabahÃ§e Palace. Youâ€™ll have a panoramic view of all of the city â€“ from the European to the Asian side â€“ that has captivated imaginations for centuries.\n\nRelated content: Palaces in Istanbul: 10 Stunning Royal Ottoman Palaces\n\n4. Rahmi M. KoÃ§ Museum\n\nThe man who paid the highest taxes in Turkey in 2013 and one of the most successful businessmen of Turkey, decided to open his museum in Istanbul. His inspiration was a visit to the Henry Ford Museum.\n\nIn 1991, he bought a derelict spot and named it after himself. Now, the museum is focused on industry, transport, and communication. The museumâ€™s location on the historic site was once used to host the anchors during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III (1703-1730).\n\nThe museum is mainly based on a selection of items from Rahmi M. KoÃ§â€™s personal collection.\n\nRelated content: 12 Most Delicious Turkish Mezes to Cement that Friendship\n\n5. Pera Museum\n\nIf you have an interest in the arts, you should visit. Founded in 2005 by the KÄ±raÃ§ Foundation, the gallery is still in its early years but already has a strong identity. It focuses on Orientalism in 19th-century art. However, it does have other themes for its exhibitions, such as the Anatolian weights and measures, the KÃ¼tahya tiles and ceramics, and, of course, famed artist Osman Hamdi Beyâ€™s works.\n\nIt has collaborated with many other galleries to exhibit works from internationally acclaimed artists and those from Turkey. Most countries can find their art represented as the central theme focuses on national identity.\n\nThe building is located in one of the many side streets of Istiklal Avenue and is near Taksim square.\n\nRelated content: Istanbulâ€™s Top 8 DÃ¶ner Kebab Places: A Complete Guide w/ Maps\n\n6. Taksim square and Republic statue\n\nNamed after a reservoir, the history of this spot goes back to the era of Sultan Mahmud the Hunchback (the 1730s). The long pedestrian avenue, Istiklal Street, ends here (or starts?). Though it has so many wonderfully designed buildings, this spot is famous for its demonstrations, parades, events. Itâ€™s also famous for its nightlife. Youâ€™ll find people gathering at night to welcome the new year. The nostalgic trams start here and terminate near TÃ¼nel, the second oldest subway system after London.\n\nThe Republic statue was built by Italian Sculptor, Pietro Canonica, with funds from the public. It depicts the founding fathers of Turkey.\n\nTaksim Square and the Republic statue is the â€˜meeting spotâ€™ where locals meet up with their friends before visiting one of the many shops or restaurants in this district.\n\nRelated content: The Best Breakfast in Istanbul: 10 Excellent Breakfast Places\n\n7. Ã‡iÃ§ek PasajÄ±\n\nTranslated as â€˜flower passageâ€™, this beautiful building is located on the old site of the Naum theatre. The theatre hosted Verdiâ€™s â€˜Il Trovatoreâ€™ before Paris had the opportunity. It was also a favorite of the Ottoman Sultans. After a fire, this spot was renovated into its current appearance.\n\nIn its early days, it was called Hristaki Passage. After the Russian revolution of 1917, impoverished Russian noblewomen used to sell flowers on this historic site. Hence the name.\n\nThese days, the arcade hosts fashionable shops, cafes, and bars. Suppose youâ€™re wondering why itâ€™s worth the visit. In that case, this passage is a favorite of famous chefs, writers, and architects for its buildings.\n\nRelated content: 5 Fish Markets in Istanbul to Unleash Your Inner Poissonnier\n\n8. Galata Mevlevihanesi\n\nGalata Mevlevi Lodge is sometimes described as a museum. Itâ€™s more like a historic religious building that you can visit to see the whirling dervishes. Youâ€™ll also find Sufi instruments.\n\nThe mystical order is named after the poet Mevlana, who is known in English as Rumi. This fraction was founded in the 13th century. They were briefly banned in the early Republic days due to their religious connection, but this Lodge remained.\n\nRelated content: The 14 Best Restaurants in Turkey Right Now (2021 Updated)\n\n9. Saint Antuan Church\n\nThe St. Anthony of Padua Church is the largest Catholic cathedral in Turkey. It is located on Istiklal Street, and itâ€™s a little hard to miss considering how marvelous its architecture is. Outside of prayer times, one may visit and take countless photographs. You can also attend mass which is in Turkish, Polish, English, and Italian.\n\nBuilt for the Italian community in Istanbul, the combination of the Venetian neo-Gothic and Tuscan-Lombard styles is still sublime today. That may be why Pope John XXIII preached in this transcendent Church for 10 years before becoming the Pope. Fun fact: a Turkish conman attempted to sell this historic site.\n\nRelated content: The Best Baklava in Istanbul: TOP 11 Baklava Shops\n\nRelated things to do\n\n10. Istanbul Museum of Modern Art\n\nAnother one for the fan of the arts. The focus of Istanbul Modern is on artists from Turkey. The building is located on-site of a former maritime warehouse. While the lower floor contains a cinema, temporary exhibitions, and a library, the upper floors have permanent collections, spaces for educational programs, a gift shop, and a restaurant. The collections include newer artists and older ones, such as Abdulmejid II â€“ the last Caliph of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nRelated content: The Best 14 International Restaurants In Istanbul 2021\n\nRelated things to do\n\n11. Ayia Triada Kilisesi (Hagia Triada Church)\n\nThe Hagia Triada (Holy Trinity) Greek Orthodox Church dates back to 1880. Itâ€™s still in use today and is considered the most prominent Greek Orthodox shrine in Istanbul. It was also the first domed Church that was built after Constantinople became Istanbul in 1453.\n\nInside, there is a selection of glorious paintings by Sakellarios Megaklis. The marblework was designed by Alexandros Krikelis. If you can make your way to the altar, youâ€™ll find yourself lost in divine thought. Perhaps itâ€™s the neo-baroque style architecture combined with the neo-gothic facade, or maybe itâ€™s the beautiful work still being done by the parishioners of this Church. Still, youâ€™ll undoubtedly find yourself pleased to have discovered this hidden gem.\n\nRelated content: The Best Turkish Foods: 44 Lip-Smacking Good Turkish Dishes (w/ Photos)\n\n12. Museum of Innocence\n\nThe Museum of Innocence has the same name as the book written by the first Turkish Nobel Laureate, Orhan Pamuk. Although based upon a fictional story, it did win the 2014 European Museum of the Year Award. The collection is based on life in upper-class Istanbul between the 1970s to 2000s. Itâ€™s in the neighborhoods that are well-known for their antique shops. Though the book was published in 2008, the Museum was established in 2012. However, you donâ€™t have to have read the novel to get to grips with the Museum of Innocence. All you need is a curious mind and a desire to understand life in Istanbul.\n\nRelated content: 8 Budget Restaurants and 10 Best Cheap Eats in Istanbul\n\n13.

Miniaturk\n\nIf you donâ€™t have a lot of time and you really just want to hit the â€˜cultural hotspots,â€™ your first attraction in Istanbul should be MiniaTurk. Translated literally, it means â€˜Mini Turk.â€™ Itâ€™s named like that because it contains miniature models of the most popular and historic touristic spots of Turkey.\n\nItâ€™s created on a scale of 1:25 and includes about 135 models in a 15,000m2 space. It is one of the largest miniature parks. It contains models from Istanbul, Anatolia, and outside of Turkey, such as the Mostar Bridge. It also has structures from history. There is extra space for expansion. Think of this as one big playground with childrenâ€™s gardens, restaurants, exhibition halls, trains, ferries, and even a fairytale tree. Though technically in the BeyoÄŸlu district and still in the city center, itâ€™s a little far from Istiklal Avenue, Taksim Square, and all the spots therein.\n\nRelated content: 10 Best NiÅŸantaÅŸÄ± Restaurants: Complete Guide (2021 Updated)\n\n15. Kamondo Merdivenleri\n\nA stoneâ€™s throw away from Istanbul Modern, youâ€™ll find a staircase that James Bond superfans may recognize. This neo-baroque/art Nouveau-styled staircase was built by Abraham Saloman Kamondo as his grandchildren struggled to climb the hill to get to school in the 1850s. The Kamondo family has contributed to Turkey after relocating to Istanbul.\n\nTheir origins date back to escaping the Spanish Inquisition in 1492. Although the Ottoman Empire accepted the Jews expulsed from Spain, the Kamondo family first moved to Venice. Subsequent generations relocated to Istanbul after Austria took over Venice in 1798. They established a bank and lived in the Galata district. The family did so well that they were the most important bankers during the Ottoman Empire. It wouldnâ€™t be a surprise, then, that this staircase connects Voyvoyda and Banks Street. Unfortunately, the family perished in the Holocaust in World War II. This staircase is one of many reminders of their brilliant contributions.\n\nRelated content: Turkish Beers: 13 Best Beer Brands & Craft Beers in Turkey\n\n16. Pera Palace Hotel\n\nAllegedly, Agatha Christie wrote â€˜Murder on the Orient Expressâ€™ here. Ernest Hemmingway and Graham Greeneâ€™s protagonists have also apparently stayed here. This is a bizarre combination of being both a museum and a hotel.\n\nThis spot is considered one of the most luxurious ones in the city considering its history. Built in 1892, the original Armenian Ottoman owners, The Esayan Family, used the Pera Palace to host travelers on the Orient Express. In other words, itâ€™s the oldest European Hotel in Turkey. The building is under the protection of Turkish Law.

Nevizade street\n\nIf itâ€™s your first time in this city, you may feel a little intimidated by the idea of enjoying the nightlife. However, the BeyoÄŸlu district does have a European vibe. Itâ€™s filled with historic pubs, bars, and clubs, so no need to fret if you wish to go for a late-night bar crawl. Just beware musicians who play at your table expect to be paid. If youâ€™re really out of pocket, just politely gesture for them to move on before they start playing.
