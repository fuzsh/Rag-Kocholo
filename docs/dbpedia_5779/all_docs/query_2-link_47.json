        "text": "Over the past three years, Brent and I have spent four months living in Istanbul, Turkey. We think it’s one of the most interesting cities on Earth.\n\nWe’ve lived in four different neighborhoods, and we’ve spent a fair bit of time exploring other parts of the city too.\n\nIf you’re a Westerner planning a trip here, we recommend you stay in one of three different areas — based, in part, on how long you plan to stay.\n\nOne week or less? We recommend Sultanahmet, the city’s historic center and the location of its most famous tourist attractions.\n\nOne month or less? We recommend Beyoğlu, a vibrant neighborhood that’s a bit less touristy than Sultanahmet but still very close to the major attractions.\n\nOne month or more? We recommend Kadıköy, a trendy neighborhood popular with Westerners and expats, quieter than the other two, but with lots of great amenities.\n\nBefore we begin, a caveat: every traveler is different with varying backgrounds, interests, budgets, and fitness levels. If you have specific needs or interests, please do your due diligence.\n\nAlso, see our general Istanbul tourist recommendations here and our other Turkey coverage here.\n\nSultanahmet: One Week or Less\n\nSultanahmet is the historic center of Istanbul. This area was the ancient Greek city of Byzantium from the 7th century BCE until 330 CE, and until 1930, it was the slightly less ancient city of Constantinople.\n\nMost of the city’s major tourist sights and attractions are either here or very nearby.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nSultanahmet sits at the southern end of the Istanbul Peninsula. Istanbul famously sits in both Europe and Asia, separated by the Bosporus Strait. Sultanahmet is on the European side and borders the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn.\n\nIt’s easily accessible by taxi, car, tram, ferry, and bus.\n\nWhat’s here?\n\nSultanahmet is home to Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern, the Hippodrome, the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.\n\nTechnically, the Grand Bazaar and the Egyptian Spice Market are right outside this neighborhood, but they’re easily accessible by walking.\n\nThere are also an almost infinite number of hotels, restaurants, and cafes catering to tourists, not to mention rug stores, shops selling Turkish Delight, and other tourist amenities.\n\nPROS:\n\nMost major tourist attractions are all within easy walking distance of each other. This whole area is full of historic buildings, plazas, and parks, and it’s all quite charming.\n\nEnglish is widely spoken here, which isn’t true in all parts of Istanbul.\n\nCONS:\n\nThis is by far the most touristy part of town, which can be trying in different ways. For example, everything is conveniently situated together, but that convenience costs: you’re going to pay the most here for everything, including hotel rooms, meals, and souvenirs.\n\nGiven that Istanbul is one of the most visited cities in the world, it isn’t surprising that this area gets very crowded. With all of the tourist attractions here, it’s best to go earlier in the day, and earlier in the season.\n\nIstanbul’s high season is the summer, but July can be very hot. The Muslim holidays of Ramadan and Kurban Bayramı vary each year but are also considered peak tourist times.\n\nShoulder season is March to May and September to November, and the city will be cheapest in December. But it will also be cold and wet.\n\nDisabled visitors should be aware that accessibility is bad in almost all of Istanbul, but given the narrow sidewalks and cobblestone streets, it’s especially bad here.\n\nIn Sultanahmet, you will see many local and visiting Muslim women wearing traditional clothing, including full burqas. There are also fewer women in general, and some people might find this uncomfortable. The mosques require all women to cover their hair and shoulders, and both men and women must dress modestly.\n\nFinally, in this area of town, you will be approached by a lot of merchants — mostly rug dealers and restaurateurs. Our advice is to simply ignore them.\n\nBONUS TIP: Buy your tickets for Basilica Cistern ahead of time here. Frankly, we thought that the smaller Theodosius Cistern was just as interesting as Basilica Cistern, but with a fantastic light show. It was also less crowded.\n\nBeyoğlu: One to Four Weeks\n\nThe Beyoğlu district is less touristy than Sultanahmet but considerably more secular. The area is filled with lively restaurants and nightlife, and plenty of shopping.\n\nMuch of the district occupies a large hill divided into different neighborhoods, including Galata, Taksim, Cihangir, Kabataş, Çukurcuma, and Şişhane. These are the areas where visitors would probably most want to stay.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nBeyoğlu lies directly across the Golden Horn from Sultanahmet, and it’s also bordered by the Bosporus Strait. Generally, the higher up the hill, the better off you’ll be, as that puts you closer to the main attractions and the better neighborhoods.\n\nWhat’s here?\n\nBeyoğlu’s most famous attraction is probably the seven-hundred-year-old Galata Tower, an iconic, 66.9-meter structure that is widely visible throughout central Istanbul.\n\nThe tower has been a citadel, a prison, a look-out point, and — apocryphally — the spot where the world’s first recorded human flight began when, in 1638, a Turkish scientist named Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi strapped wings on himself, jumped from the roof, and may have even flown across the Bosporus Strait into Asia.\n\nToday, it’s a museum. But you can still climb to the top, and it offers a great view of the city. (Note: Galata is currently closed due to ongoing renovations.)\n\nBeyoğlu is also home to Istiklal Street, a fantastic, 1.3-kilometer-long pedestrian-only boulevard that runs along the top of the hill.\n\nPeople come to Istiklal Street to shop, eat, and see and be seen. The street and its surrounding buildings and streets are packed with restaurants and shops of all kinds. Don’t miss the Turkish ice cream vendors who put on quite a show.\n\nOther historical attractions in Beyoğlu include:\n\nThe Tünel, a historic funicular on Galata Hill that was the second fully underground urban railway in the world (after the London Underground).\n\nÇiçek Pasajı, or the Flower Passage, an elegant former flower market that is now mostly restaurants.\n\nTaksim Square, which is the culmination of Istiklal Street, and is known for its famous mosque, frequent political protests, and all the nearby nightclubs.\n\nSt. Anthony of Padua Church, the largest Catholic Church in Istanbul, where Pope John XXIII preached for ten years before being chosen as Pope.\n\nMeanwhile, the neighborhoods surrounding Istiklal are a wonderful warren of cobblestone streets filled with restaurants and coffee shops, impressive street art, and a seemingly endless number of quirky boutiques.\n\nPROS:\n\nBeyoğlu is centrally located with easy subway, bus, tram, and ferry access to the rest of the city. If you’re a walker like I am, you can easily amble down the hill, across Galata Bridge — always lined with fishermen — and then up into the Sultanahmet neighborhood and all of its attractions. It’s not even three kilometers.\n\nBeyoğlu restaurant and lodging prices are slightly more affordable than in Sultanahmet. And given that it’s a larger area, there are more to choose from.\n\nAnd unlike Sultanahmet, pubs, bars, and nightclubs are plentiful. This area has a much more liberal and secular vibe than Sultanahmet; women dress more comfortably and colorfully, and there are simply more women in general.\n\nCONS:\n\nThis area is less touristy than Sultanahmet, but it’s still pretty touristy! It can also be quite crowded, and all of that nightlife can be loud. And prices aren’t that much lower. After several years of sky-high inflation, Turkey is simply not the bargain for Westerners that it used to be.\n\nBeyoğlu is very urban, which means there is a decided lack of green space. Also, for longer stays, the grocery store options are fairly limited. There are some outdoor markets and fruit and veg stands, but they’re not as plentiful as in other parts of the city.\n\nFinally, this area is fairly gritty in places. Sometimes the elegant decay is interesting, but sometimes it’s just…decay.\n\nKadıköy: A Month or Longer\n\nBoth Sultanahmet and Beyoğlu are very urban: active and dense. Kadıköy is farther off the beaten path — home to both a busy commercial area, but also less frenetic residential neighborhoods. Many expats live here, along with members of Istanbul’s middle and professional class.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nKadıköy is on the Asian side of the Bosporus Strait, stretching along the northern half of the Sea of Marmara. The Princes Islands, a popular weekend getaway for many Istanbullar, are an hour’s ferry ride away to the south.\n\nWhat’s here?\n\nKadıköy is a large district, but we recommend staying somewhere in the area circled above. The area around and above the small harbor with the ferry terminal is the busy commercial heart, while the opposite side of the peninsula is more residential.\n\nJust up the hill from the ferry terminal, you’ll find the Kadıköy Fish Market, but don’t be fooled by the name. This large area of pedestrian-only streets is home to restaurants and shops selling produce, olives, cheese, meats, Turkish Delight, spices, and, yes, fish.\n\nThe area’s other notable attraction is the distinctive Haydarpaşa Train Station, which used to connect Istanbul to Baghdad. However, the station was closed in 2012 and is currently undergoing restoration.\n\nStreet art is also quite plentiful.\n\nPROS:\n\nKadıköy is an incredibly easy place for a Westerner to live: it’s home to many expats and long-term nomads (along with some professional and middle-class Istanbullars); it has plenty of amenities; it’s very liberal and even more young and secular than Beyoğlu; and English is widely spoken.\n\nKadıköy has more green space than much of the rest of Istanbul, something we found lacking during our time in other parts of the city.\n\nWe especially love the promenade that extends from the ferry terminal around the peninsula, eventually ending at Moda Sahil Park. There you can play tennis, bike, or just sit and take in the views.\n\nThe huge Nautilus Mall has a massive grocery store, a cinema, a food court, a gym, and pretty much everything else you could want.\n\nAcibadem Hospital — one of the city’s best hospitals — has a first-rate facility in Kadıköy.\n\nThis is a desirable neighborhood, but it’s still cheaper than Sultanahmet or Beyoğlu. You’ll also probably get a newer building with more space and amenities.\n\nCONS:\n\nKadıköy isn’t the place you come to see how the average Istanbullar lives or to discover this city’s history or traditional culture.\n\nPlus, since you’re on the Asian side of the city, you’re fairly far away from Istanbul’s top attractions (even if the view of them can be quite spectacular).\n\nPublic transportation is fine, with buses, ferries, and a fairly close subway stop. But you should still figure on about an hour’s travel time to reach other parts of the city.\n\nNo matter where you stay in Istanbul, we can almost guarantee you’ll love it.\n\nSee our general Istanbul tourist recommendations here, and our other Turkey coverage here.\n\nShare\n\nLeave a comment"
