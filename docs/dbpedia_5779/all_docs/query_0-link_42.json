The hot and cold mezes are perfectly sharable for groups of all sizes, and each dish offered is its own unique brand of flavorful sensation.\n\nWhile hummus and tabbouleh comprise the more familiar choices, adventurous palates chomp at the bit to try the sardines wrapped in grape leaves. Main courses include a variety of tasty doner kebabs, including chicken, lamb, striped bass and swordfish. For dessert, is there any other option than the baklava? You won't walk away disappointed after finishing up your feast with this sweet treat."
