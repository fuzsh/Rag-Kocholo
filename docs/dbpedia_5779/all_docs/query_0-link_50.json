        "text": "Istanbul's historical Beyoğlu district, which has made yet another name for itself thanks to urban transformation projects, has become a center of attraction for educational institutions. In addition to the campuses of Istanbul Technical University and Mimar Sinan University, which have been operating for many years, Bilgi University, Beykent University, Istanbul Commerce University and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Foundation University have recently opened campuses in the district. Moreover, it was announced that Haliç University will build a campus over a 35,000 square meters on the Sütlüce coast.\n\nBeyoğlu Municipality Mayor Ahmet Misbah Demircan visited the construction area of Haliç University's new campus and said Beyoğlu used to be considered a place for entertainment but has been the center of tourism, culture and art for the last 11 years. \"We have come a long way in improving the accommodation conditions as well as tourist services,\" Demircan said.\n\n\"Istanbul Technical University and Mimar Sinan University are the biggest state universities in the district of Beyoğlu. In time, Bilgi University, Beykent University, Istanbul Commerce University, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Foundation University and Haliç University decided to open campuses in Beyoğlu as well. Actually, Haliç University has a campus in Şişhane, however, they also bought a bigger area in Sütlüce. Now, they will have their deserved place on the coast of the Golden Horn with their 10,000 students,\" Demircan said.\n\nThe mayor claimed that labeling Beyoğlu as the center of tourism would be a wrong description as \"Beyoğlu is now the center of higher education.\" Demircan thanked the president of the Haliç University Foundation, the university's chancellor and everybody who worked hard for the project. \"With the coming of over 10,000 students, the education industry will take root in Beyoğlu. I am very glad by the recent developments,\" he said.\n\nLast Update: Feb 24, 2015 1:31 am\n\nKEYWORDS"
