I was leaning toward Karakoy because the ferry was nearby & I knew I was going to do a day trip to Asia. I was trying to avoid the touristy area because I heard it‚Äôs just overpriced & you pretty much see everything in a day or 2. (I‚Äôm sure some will want to debate this)\n\nTaksim from what I‚Äôve heard is quite busy. Better known for their nightlife.\n\nThe reason I‚Äôm reaching for suggestions is because I noticed the hotel ratings weren‚Äôt so kind to Karakoy. In Sultanahmet & Faith, I see wonderful rave reviews for lodging. I‚Äôm tempted just to book there because some of the reviews just woo you. üòÇMainly commenting on staff & hospitality.\n\nSo just need to hear from real RS reviewers.\n\nThanks. Any comments are greatly appreciated"
