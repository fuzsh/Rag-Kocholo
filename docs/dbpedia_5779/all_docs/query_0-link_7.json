A popular hive of activity that stretches for over 1 km. And now with some fabulous new developments, visitors and tourists will be taken on a wonderful journey of connection from the old to the new of important landmarks, places of interest across the district. An unmissable experience awaits starting from the newly developed Galataport, taking you through the depths of the narrow streets of Karaköy and beyond, through the charm and simplicity and sophistication of İstiklal Caddesi and gradually winding up to the innovative and newly transformed Taksim Square.\n\nWhere İstanbul Unwinds"
