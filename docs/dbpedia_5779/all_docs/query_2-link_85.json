Here are the museums in Beyoglu you must see…\n\nBeyoglu is also known for its museums… As the most vibrant district of Turkey, Beyoglu holds a very important place in our cultural history.\n\nAtlas Cinema / Istanbul Cinema Museum\n\nSource : atlas1948.com\n\nAtlas Cinema, which shared the nostalgic scenes of Yesilcam movies with us and is full of many memories, has added a brand-new museum to the cultural and artistic life.\n\nThe first floor of the building had been converted into a theater hall (Kucuk Sahne – The Small Stage) in 1951 and had begun to stage its shows with the play named “Of Mice and Men” under the direction of Muhsin Ertugrul. The renewed Atlas 1948 has been renovated once again for theater and other performing arts on its 18×7 m stage with a technological design that will also allow digital arts to be performed.\n\nAtlas Cinema has turned back in 2021 with its renovated design. With the restoration, the Istanbul Cinema Museum was also created following the renovation of the cinema. The museum, which can be visited with a single ticket, consists of three floors. While the first two floors serve as permanent museums, temporary exhibitions take place on the third floor. The wax sculptures in the museum provide visitors with an unforgettable feeling of nostalgia.\n\nAddress: Kuloglu, Istiklal Cd.

The Museum of Innocence is the first museum created based on the fictional universe of a novel. It received Europe the Museum of the Year Award in 2014. Starting from the 1990s, Pamuk thought of the novel and the museum together from the very beginning. The novel, set between 1974 and the early 2000s, portrays life in Istanbul between 1950 and 2000 with flashbacks and memories through the lives of two families, one wealthy and the other one of the middle class.\n\nIn the museum, the things used, worn, heard, seen, collected and imagined by the protagonists of the novel are displayed in carefully arranged boxes and showcases.\n\nThere is no need to read the novel to enjoy the museum just as there is no need to visit the museum to enjoy the novel. But those who read the novel will better understand the various meanings of things in the museum, and those who visit the museum will also see many things they did not notice while reading the novel. The novel was published in 2008 and the museum opened in the spring of 2012.\n\nAddress: Firuzaga, Cukurcuma Caddesi, Dalgic Cikmazi, 2, 34425, Beyoglu, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nWeb page: www.masumiyetmuzesi.org\n\nPera Museum\n\nSource: www.peramuzesi.org.tr\n\nThe Pera Museum, which opened its doors in early June 2005, is the first step of a comprehensive cultural initiative that was realized by the Suna and Inan Kirac Foundation to provide culture and arts services in this exclusive part of the city.
