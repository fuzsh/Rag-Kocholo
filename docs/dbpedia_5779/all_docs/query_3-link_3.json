We’ve got a list of things to do in Beyoglu, top Beyoğlu sites, and tips for where to stay in Beyoğlu, Istanbul.\n\nBeyoğlu is one of the 39 Istanbul districts and is located on the European side of the city.

It is home to a diverse range of people, from artists and musicians to students and professionals. The area has a rich history, dating back to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nDuring the Ottoman era, Beyoglu was known as Pera, which derives from the Greek word for “across” or “beyond”. It was here that European traders would come to do business with the Ottomans, and it quickly became a melting pot of cultures. The first foreign consulate in Istanbul was established in Pera in 1580, and over time more followed suit. This made Beyoğlu an important hub for diplomacy and trade.\n\nIn 1843, Pera was connected to Galata by a bridge, making it even more accessible to foreigners. This led to an influx of tourists, many of whom were drawn to its cafes and nightclubs. Beyoğlu developed a reputation for being a lively and exotic place, which it still retains today.\n\nThe 20th century saw some turbulent times for Beyoğlu. During World War I, many of its residents were forced to flee as the city came under Allied bombardment. In 1955, there were widespread riots following the murder of a Turkish diplomat in Greece.
