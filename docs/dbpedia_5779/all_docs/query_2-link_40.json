        "text": "Beyoglu is the most European district in Istanbul and there are many places to visit here. Therefore, it’s hard to imagine Beyoglu as forestland where Ottoman sultans used to go hunting considering it’s the most active district of Istanbul today.\n\nBeyoglu used to be outside the city center until the last century of the Ottoman Empire and was known as “Pera”. However, it witnessed a tremendous change in the 1800s. (19th Century)\n\nIn the Byzantine Empire era, Beyoglu was called Pera, which means “beyond”, by the residents who looked at it from the Historical Peninsula and it began to be called Bey-Oglu (son of a lord/master) later. And I would like to provide more information about Beyoglu in this piece.\n\nThis district started to become active after the Sultan moved to live in Dolmabahce Palace and embassies were opened in its neighborhoods. I hope you will enjoy this article about Beyoglu.\n\nHistory of Beyoglu District\n\nThe history of Beyoglu neighborhood dates back to the Byzantine Empire. Istanbul was called Constantinople when it was the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Being a busy port city, Constantinople was a central part of the Silk Road that stretched from China to Europe.\n\nLife as we know back then was limited to the Historical Peninsula. The Byzantines saw “beyond the Golden Horn” when they looked at the other side from the Historical Peninsula. Therefore, they called it Pera, a Greek word which means “beyond”.\n\nPera was also a term that described distance because there was no Galata Bridge that would connect the Historical Peninsula and Pera back then. While the Byzantines lived on the Historical Peninsula, Latin origin Europeans lived at Pera, which was also a Byzantine soil.\n\nThe silk fabrics from China and the spices from India would reach Constantinople by land and they were exported to Europe. The Venetians and the Genoese were the two colonies that would manage this trade.\n\nThe order at Pera stayed the same until the last century of the Ottoman Empire’s last century. This is because Mehmed the Conqueror granted privileges to Venetian and Genoese colonies and the trade continued in the same fashion. However, the name of the neighborhood changed in Suleiman the Magnificent era.\n\nIn the 16th century, when the Ottoman Empire was at the peak of its power, a Venetian aristocrat lived in Pera. Alvisa Gritti, the illegitimate businessman son of Venetian Duke Andrea Gritti, was a figure who was close to the Sultan.\n\nPargali Ibrahim Pasha, Suleiman the Magnificent, and Alvisa Grittie would often meet and chat. Gritti lived on one of the hillsides of Pera and he was known as “Beyoglu” (son of a lord). In time, the neighborhood began to be called Beyoglu.\n\nNeighborhoods of Beyoglu\n\nKarakoy, Galata, and Tepebasi, the neighborhoods of Beyoglu today, used to be where non-Muslim communities of the Ottoman Empire lived for a very long time. However, it was the second half of the 19th century when these areas on the north of Golden Horn began to be called “Modern Istanbul”.\n\nThe biggest factor in this change was the embassies that were opened in the area during the 1800s. While there was only Karakoy-Galata area outside the walls surrounding the Historical Peninsula in the beginning, the settlement spread to higher areas and it went beyond Galata that was a colony of the Genoese.\n\nThe new buildings covered Tepebasi and Galatasaray Square first. Then, it reached Taksim Square via Istiklal Street.\n\nBeyoglu: Paris of the East\n\nLocated on the north of the Golden Horn, Beyoglu used to be regarded as “Paris of the East” until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s.\n\nWith its spectacular embassy buildings, luxury shops, palaces, and mansions, Istiklal Avenue used to be known as Grand Rue De Pera (the main avenue of Pera) by the foreigners. The Muslim, on the other hand, lived a simple life on the other side of the Golden Horn at the Historical Peninsula.\n\nAnother reason that contributed to the cultural difference of the two sides was Sultan Abdulmecid as he built Dolmabahce Palace on the coast of Bosphorus and moved out of the traditional Topkapi Palace at the Historical Peninsula.\n\nSultan Abdulmecid would also attend cultural activities such as balls, theater performances, and concerts organized by the foreign ambassadors, tradesmen, and bankers. Mesrutiyet Caddesi at Pera Palace was very colorful during this time.\n\nPlaces to Visit in Beyoglu, Istanbul 2024\n\nBeyoglu is one of the four most popular areas where tourists stay in Istanbul. There are many places to visit in Beyoglu, which is full of beautiful hotels, restaurants and cafes. We divided the district into 6 parts in order to explain the things to do in Beyoglu.\n\n1. Karakoy\n\nKarakoy has been the rising star of Istanbul in recent years. Various nice restaurants and boutique coffee shops have been opened here. You can also find Karakoy Gulluoglu, the most famous baklava place, and Namli Gurme, one of the best breakfast places in the city, at Karakoy.\n\nKarakoy used to serve as a port in the Byzantine and Ottoman Empire eras and it was where one of the chains stretched at the entrance of the Golden Gate during the conquest of Istanbul was tied. A piece of that famous chain can be seen at Maritime Museum today.\n\nLike Fener and Balat, Karakoy is one of the interesting neighborhoods of Beyoglu. As you wander around the side streets of Karakoy, you can discover the historical buildings of the Genoese, Byzantine, and the Ottoman era.\n\nIn addition to having fancy and splendid buildings, Bankalar Street is a clear reflection of the radical social and economic change the Ottoman Empire experienced in the 19th century.\n\nMoreover, you can see Arap Mosque, which is a reminiscent of Italy. This mosque used to be a Catholic church. However, it’s used as a mosque today.\n\nIf you need a guide to discover Karakoy, you can have a look at Things to do in Karakoy piece. In that article, I drew a tour map and introduced the historical monuments of the neighborhood.\n\n2. Galata\n\nGalata was populated by the Genoese, a privileged trade colony, both in the Byzantine and Ottoman Empire era. Galata Tower, one of the important historical monuments of the city, was also built by them.\n\nGalata square and the nearby streets have become one of the intellectual corners of the city, thanks to the recently opened modern cafés, boutique hotels, and art galleries.\n\nNeve Shalom Synagogue, the most important synagogue of the city, is also very close to Galata Tower. Moreover, you can spend a good time at Serdar-i Ekrem Street by shopping and stop by at Nardis Jazz Club, one of the best bars in Istanbul.\n\nFor more information as to what to do at Galata, I recommend you to read my other post titled Things to do in Galata. It can guide you through to make a plan to visit Galata that has a little complicated route.\n\n3. Istiklal Street\n\nIstiklal Street is one of the most beautiful avenues to take a walk in Istanbul. It is approximately 1.5 km long and there are embassy buildings, shopping malls, movie and theatre halls, restaurants, and books shops on it.\n\nMoreover, you can also visit colorful streets like Nevizade and Asmali Mescit or iconic monuments like St. Anthony of Padua Church near Istiklal Street. 360 Istanbul, one of the best restaurants in Istanbul, is located on Istiklal Avenue.\n\nIstiklal Street is full of people 7/24 and it looks like a crazy river running through the city with millions of people visiting it every day. Istiklal Street is the biggest symbol of Beyoglu and it is also the backbone of the list of places to visit in Beyoglu.\n\n4. Mesrutiyet Street\n\nMesrutiyet Street reflects the fancy Pera in the last century of the Ottoman Empire. You can still see some hotels opened in the 19th century when Beyoglu started to rise.\n\nWe should mention Pera Palace Hotel, the most famous building in the area. It’s because the passengers of the Orient Express that would end its journey at Sirkeci Train Station would usually stay here.\n\nAgatha Christie, a famous murder novelist, also stayed here before he wrote his novel “Murder on the Orient Express”. Another thing worth mentioning about Pera Palace Hotel is that Ataturk stayed at this hotel. The room he stayed in serves as a museum today.\n\nFurthermore, Mesrutiyet Street houses some of the most elegant restaurants in Istanbul. Mikla, Meze By Lemon Tree, and NuPera are some of the restaurants worth mentioning at Mesrutiyet Street.\n\n5. Cihangir\n\nCihangir is known as the neighborhood of writers and movie directors. Orhan Pamuk, for example, has become a symbol of Cihangir. This neighborhood feels like the center of intellectual life with its boutique hotels, elegant restaurants, and cafes.\n\nCukurcuma Street at Cihangir is included in the places to do shopping in Istanbul. It’s famous for its antique shops and it’s a good choice for photographers. Moreover, Museum of Innocence that bases the foundation of the novel by the same name by Orhan Pamuk is also on Cukurcuma Street.\n\nAlthough it’s not well-known, one of the historical hamams of Istanbul, Aga Hamami, is at Cihangir too. The history of the Aga Hamam goes back to 1454 and is one of the oldest baths in Istanbul. For this reason, it has an important place among the places to visit in Beyoglu.\n\n6. Tophane\n\nTophane stands out with Mimar Sinan’s Kilic Ali Pasa Mosque and Tophane Fountain next to it. Karakoy, Tophane, and Findikli neighborhoods are next to each other and they are highly active due to the cruise ships harbor here.\n\nA spectacular hundred years old cannon-ball casting factory, known as Tophane-i Amire, from the Ottoman Empire, stands out with its architecture. This building is a museum named Tophane-i Amire Culture and Art Center in Fine Arts academy at Mimar Sinan University today. Moreover, Istanbul Modern, one of the nicest museums in Istanbul, is also in Tophane.\n\nYou can walk to Kabatas from Tophane on foot and visit Dolmabahce Palace.

These mosques were built during different periods of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThings to Do in Beyoglu, Istanbul 2024\n\nThings to do in Beyoglu include dining at the best restaurants in Istanbul, visiting museums and experiencing Turkish baths.
