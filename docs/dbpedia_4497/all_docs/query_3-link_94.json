But really, The Martian is looking like the real miracle. Because anybody starting their career with that The Duellists / Alien / Blade Runner trilogy is going to have a lot to live up to. The Martian, though, is a great film swimming in a sea of utter crap. Where did that come from? It's like the 2010s Event Horizon, a totally unexpected joy from somebody who I couldn't possibly expect that from. Certainly not",

The Martian, though, is a great film swimming in a sea of utter crap. Where did that come from? It's like the 2010s Event Horizon, a totally unexpected joy from somebody who I couldn't possibly expect that from. Certainly not anymore.\n\nOne of the pieces of crap floating round The Martian is Body of Lies. At no point did I even really comes close to caring what this was trying to do. I think it's supposed to be spreading its wings and trying to be an espionage / spy thriller, action film, political drama and interventionist thinkpiece, but Scott isn't capable of knitting all those elements together into a worthwhile whole.\n\nFew directors would. It's over-plotted and over-long and says and does nothing that I haven't seen tons of times before. It's just a waste of everyone's time. And bloody hell, it was only 2008 when Mark Strong and Oscar Isaac were going brownface for this and Scott was getting away with it? Fucking nuts, man.\n\nBut, you know, seven hundred million stars for the scene set in Manchester where a fucking milk float drives past and one of the SAS team is whistling Rule Britannia. Jolly good, Ridley."
