The final instalment was following on from arguably the greatest film based on a comic book character yet to be released, The Dark Knight, which featured Heath Ledger’s unforgettable performance as the villainous Joker. The actor’s tragic demise meant the character would not be returning for what Nolan decided, after a deliberation of a few months following the second film’s release, would be the final entry in his series of films.\n\nSet a few years after the events in The Dark Knight, the film opens with a jaw-dropping mid-air sequence onboard a plane during which we’re introduced to the film’s big bad, comic book favourite character Bane (played by Tom Hardy), who sets in motion a plan that will threaten Gotham and the reclusive, physically ailing Batman. At first it seems as though Bane is acting alone but soon a sinister plot is revealed that sees Gotham literally isolated from the rest of the world with Batman unable to help. The film also features Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman, initially a selfish thief but later an ally of the Dark Knight, keen to help prevent a terrible explosive disaster.\n\nFollowing on from the second film was always going to be a tricky prospect and some filmgoers were not as impressed with the final film in the trilogy. But many, including me, felt it was pretty much the perfect end to Nolan’s take on DC Comics’ most beloved character. The only thing which I did find somewhat lacklustre was the marketing campaign, especially in comparison to the host of posters printed for The Dark Knight. A fairly intriguing teaser gave way to a number of rather less interesting one sheets and the British quads weren’t great.\n\nNot all of the posters were disappointing, however, and this was one of three international advance character one sheets that were designed by Ignition Creative and printed for use in international English-speaking territories.

Their official site features hundreds of examples of their work and you only have to look at the gallery of their work on IMPAwards to see how prolific they are. The firm worked on the majority of the posters for The Dark Knight Rises and often generates lots of posters for each campaign it works on.\n\nTo see the other posters I’ve collected that were designed by Ignition click here.\n\nTitle\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises\n\nAKA\n\n--\n\nYear of Film\n\n2012\n\nDirector\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nStarring\n\nChristian Bale, Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Matthew Modine, Alon Aboutboul, Ben Mendelsohn\n\nOrigin of Film\n\nUSA | UK\n\nGenre(s) of Film\n\nAction | Crime | Thriller\n\nType of Poster\n\nOne sheet\n\nStyle of Poster\n\nBatman\n\nOrigin of Poster\n\nInternational (Asia)\n\nYear of Poster\n\n2012\n\nDesigner\n\nIgnition\n\nArtist\n\n--\n\nSS or DS\n\nDS\n\nNSS #\n\n--\n\nTagline\n\nRISE\n\nChristopher Nolan’s incredible Batman trilogy launched in 2005 with Batman Begins and ended with The Dark Knight Rises in 2012.

As with many of Kitano’s directorial efforts the film features Yakuzas as a prominent story element. Yûrei Yanagi (AKA Masahiko Ono) stars as Masaki, a feckless loser stuck in a dead-end job at a gas station who also plays (badly) for a local baseball team.\n\nOne day the coach of the team is attacked and almost killed by yakuza thugs following a confrontation in which Masaki is threatened by the same gangsters. He decides to head to Okinawa to meet a contact who can supply him with a gun in order to take revenge. This contact happens to be the psychotic Uehara (Kitano himself in an extended cameo) an unpredictable, dangerous yakuza who also wants revenge against the same gang. Masaki is taken under Uehara’s wing, leading to violent and surprising encounters in the Okinawa underworld.\n\nKitano’s character is thoroughly unlikeable and most of his actions are reprehensible in the extreme. Following on from the critical and commercial success of Violent Cop, audience and critical reaction wasn’t quite as favourable to Boiling Point and today its often said to be one of his lesser films, if not still a must watch for fans of the actor-director.\n\nThis striking B2 poster features the simple image of a metal baseball bat on a blue-green background. The Japanese title translates as ‘3-4, October’ and relates to the score of a baseball match seen in the film and the month of October, an important one in the Japanese baseball calendar.\n\nCheck out the other posters featuring Takeshi Kitano in the Film on Paper collection by clicking here.\n\nTitle\n\nThe House of Exorcism\n\nAKA\n\nLisa and the Devil (original cut)\n\nYear of Film\n\n1975\n\nDirector\n\nMario Bava (as Mickey Lion)\n\nStarring\n\nTelly Savalas, Elke Sommer, Robert Alda, Sylva Koscina, Eduardo Fajardo, Alessio Orano, Alida Valli, Gabriele Tinti\n\nOrigin of Film\n\nItaly\n\nGenre(s) of Film\n\nHorror\n\nType of Poster\n\nQuad\n\nStyle of Poster\n\n--\n\nOrigin of Poster\n\nUK\n\nYear of Poster\n\n1977\n\nDesigner\n\nUnknown\n\nArtist\n\nMike Vaughan (unconfirmed)\n\nSize (inches)\n\n30\" x 39 15/16\"\n\nSS or DS\n\nSS\n\nTagline\n\nA terrifying journey into the SUPERNATURAL\n\nOver the years a number of films have been subjected to various cuts and re-edits that alter the filmmakers’ original vision for both good and bad. This has included Apocalypse Now with its ‘Redux‘ cut in 2001, the multiple versions of Blade Runner that culminated with 2003’s ‘Final Cut’ and the strange case of Superman II. None of these revisions were quite as ill-judged as the fate that befell Italian director Mario Bava‘s 1974 horror Lisa and the Devil when it flopped at the European box-office.\n\nAn entertaining if somewhat bizarre horror set in Spain, the original film focused on Lisa (Elke Sommer) a tourist in Toledo who becomes separated from her group and winds up at a crumbling old mansion on the edge of town. There she meets the eccentric inhabitants and becomes embroiled in a series of strange and often murderous situations involving the family and the house’s mysterious butler (Telly Savalas in one of his more quirky roles).\n\nWhen the film failed to perform in Italy and the few other European countries in which it was released, the producer Alfredo Leone convinced Bava to retool the film as an Exorcist clone to capitalise on the success of the then recently released American classic. New scenes were shot featuring a demonically possessed Elke Sommer and a priest played by Robert Alda, and the original film was heavily edited so these new flashback scenes could be incorporated.\n\nLeone and Bava clashed heavily over the style of the new scenes and the latter eventually walked away from the project (the director was credited as the fictional Mickey Lion, the surname being English for Leone), which was released in the UK and US as The House of Exorcism to instant critical derision (many reviewers calling it an Exorcist rip-off) and poor commercial performance. All in all the project was a total waste of time for all concerned. Recently the UK video label released Lisa and the Devil on blu-ray in its original version and included the House of Exorcism on the same disc.\n\nAlthough not confirmed for definite, the artwork on this quad is likely to be by the British designer and artist Mike Vaughan. As detailed in Sim Branaghan’s must-own British Film Posters: An Illustrated History, Vaughan was born in 1940 and joined a London advertising agency aged 16, having skipped art school but learning on the job as he rose through the ranks from tea boy to working on accounts for the likes of British Airways and American Express. He started working on film posters at the end of the 1960s and his most famous are the ones he painted for Hammer, which included The Vampire Lovers and Lust For a Vampire.\n\nSim believes one of Vaughan’s last posters was for the clunker Arabian Adventures in 1979. The artist stopped commercial work altogether at the end of the 1980s and started producing fine artworks, focused on racing yachts and sporting events, that were sold through several prestigious London galleries. Sadly the artist passed away suddenly in July 2003 from a blood clot on the brain. The Hammer Horror Posters website features several of his pieces in a large gallery.\n\nTitle\n\nNikita\n\nAKA\n\nLa Femme Nikita (US / UK)\n\nYear of Film\n\n1990\n\nDirector\n\nLuc Besson\n\nStarring\n\nAnne Parillaud, Laura Chéron, Tchéky Karyo, Jean-Hugues Anglade, Jean Reno\n\nOrigin of Film\n\nFrance | Italy\n\nGenre(s) of Film\n\nAction | Thriller\n\nType of Poster\n\nA1\n\nStyle of Poster\n\n--\n\nOrigin of Poster\n\nGermany\n\nYear of Poster\n\n1990\n\nDesigner\n\nRenato Casaro\n\nArtist\n\nRenato Casaro\n\nSize (inches)\n\n23 7/16\" x 33\"\n\nSS or DS\n\nSS\n\nTagline\n\n--\n\nThis is the German A1 poster for the original release of Luc Besson‘s international breakthrough hit, Nikita, featuring design and artwork by Renato Casaro. A French/Italian co-production, the film stars Anne Parillaud (Besson’s wife at the time) as the titular assassin who starts out as a drug-addicted teenager living a life of crime. When a robbery at a pharmacy goes awry and her friends are killed in a gunfight, Nikita shoots dead a policeman before being arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nSoon after arriving in prison, Nikita is kidnapped and wakes up in a specialist facility where she learns that her death has been faked and she has been selected to become part of a secretive government agency simply known as the Centre. Nikita is given the choice of training as an assassin or to end up in the pauper’s grave earmarked for her. When she wisely chooses the former Nikita begins to learn the skills of a stealthy assassin under the guidance of Bob (Tchéky Karyo), her agency handler, and Amande (Jeanne Moreau).\n\nAfter graduating an becoming a sleeper agent in Paris, Nikita meets and falls in love with Marco (Jean-Hugues Anglade), a man she meets in a supermarket, but before long Centre activates her for assassination missions and both her relationship and life are under threat, especially when a mission inside an embassy gets messy and Victor the Cleaner (Jean Reno) is called to help out. Despite mixed critical reaction the film was an international box-office hit and, for reasons I’ve never understood, was given the lengthier title of La Femme Nikita outside of France and Germany. Four years later Besson and Reno would reunite for the lauded and much-loved Leon: The Professional. In addition, two American TV series have since been made based on the original film.\n\nIn 2013 I interviewed the designer and artist Renato Casaro for this site and he mentioned this poster during our chat. This is the excerpt:\n\n—————————–\n\nEvery time you worked on a poster you were trying to do something new with your painting style?\n\nYes, I didn’t want to just recycle the same designs over and over, or paint in the same colours just because it had worked for one poster. I used the airbrush carefully because I didn’t want that to be what I was known for, plus used exclusively it created very cold, artificial artwork. I would always paint the base of any artwork with gouache oils and then use the airbrush to add little bits of texture, like shadows or highlights that would really help to make the original painting that little bit more exciting and realistic. Two posters that I used airbrush almost entirely for were those for Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Sheltering Sky and Luc Besson’s Nikita. I’m proud of how both of those turned out, particularly the first one.\n\nI really like the design for Nikita.\n\nYes, that just came to me one day whilst I was thinking of ideas. I decided that you shouldn’t see her face or what she had done to cause this bright red blood splash onto clean white tiles. The film was quite complex and focused on this woman in crisis so I knew that the poster had to be a sympathetic image to sell it to cinema goers.\n\n——\n\nRenato also mentioned that he’d worked on some ideas for the poster before seeing the film:\n\nDid you ever work on poster ideas without having seen the film or visiting the set?\n\nVery occasionally yes, but I usually made sure I spoke to people involved to have a good idea of the plot and the characters before I’d start doing anything. I did do several sketches for Nikita without good results, but once I’d seen the film it was quite easy to find the right essence for the poster.\n\n—————————–\n\nTo read the full interview with Renato Casaro click here.

The story sees a quartet of teenage friends; Amy (Elizabeth Berridge), her boyfriend Buzz (Cooper Huckabee), her best friend Liz (Largo Woodruff) and Liz’s boyfriend Richie (Miles Chapin), visit a traveling carnival where they smoke marijuana, sneak into an over-21 strip show and interact with the carnies who run the shows. Richie dares the group to spend the night in the The Funhouse, an indoor ride on rails (often called a ghost train in the UK), and the girls reluctantly agree to hide until the park clears of people.\n\nAfter sneaking into the depths of the ride the group inadvertently witness the mute, mask-wearing ride operator murder Madame Zena (Sylvia Miles), the fortune teller who also moonlights as a prostitute. When the ride’s barker Conrad (Kevin Conway) discovers what has happened it is revealed that he is the father of the murderous ride operator, actually called Gunther, and when Conrad admonishes him he knocks the mask off revealing a hideous freak underneath. Conrad realises that the crime has been witnessed by the kids and he unleashes Gunther to track them down. The rest of the film sees the teenagers trying to outwit the murderous carnies and escape The Funhouse alive. The make-up for Gunther is incredibly effective and he surely ranks up their as one of the best horror movie bad guys.\n\nThis Japanese B2 features an obscured photograph of Gunther which emphasises his glowing eyes. A photo montage of the four unlucky teens is displayed at the bottom along with the same logo seen on the US one sheet."
