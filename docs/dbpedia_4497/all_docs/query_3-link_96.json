        "text": "Production Begins on “The Dark Knight Rises”\n\nFilming will take place on three continents with an all-star\n\ncast working under the direction of Christopher Nolan\n\nBURBANK, Calif. (May 19, 2011) – Principal photography has begun on Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ “The Dark Knight Rises”: the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy.\n\nLeading an all-star international cast, Oscar® winner Christian Bale (“The Fighter”) again plays the dual role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The film also stars Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle; Tom Hardy as Bane; Oscar® winner Marion Cotillard (“La Vie en Rose”) as Miranda Tate; and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake.\n\nReturning to the main cast, Oscar® winner Michael Caine (“The Cider House Rules”) plays Alfred; Gary Oldman is Commissioner Gordon; and Oscar® winner Morgan Freeman (“Million Dollar Baby”) reprises the role of Lucius Fox.\n\nIn helming “The Dark Knight Rises,” Christopher Nolan is utilizing IMAX® cameras even more extensively than he did on “The Dark Knight,” which marked the first time ever that a major feature film was partially shot with IMAX® cameras. The results were so spectacular that the director wanted to expand the use of the large-format cameras for this film.\n\nThe screenplay for “The Dark Knight Rises” is written by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan. The story is by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer. The film is being produced by Emma Thomas, Christopher Nolan and Charles Roven, who previously teamed on “Batman Begins” and the record-breaking blockbuster “The Dark Knight”.\n\nThe executive producers are Benjamin Melniker, Michael E. Uslan, Kevin De La Noy and Thomas Tull with Jordan Goldberg serving as co-producer. “The Dark Knight” is based upon characters appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by Bob Kane.\n\nBehind the scenes, “The Dark Knight Rises” reunites the director with several of his longtime collaborators (all of whom worked together on the “The Dark Knight”). The creative team includes director of photography Wally Pfister, who recently won an Oscar® for his work on Nolan’s “Inception”; production designer Nathan Crowley; editor Lee Smith; and Oscar®-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (“Topsy-Turvy”).\n\nIn addition, Paul Franklin and Chris Corbould (who both won Oscars® for the effects in “Inception”) will supervise the visual and special effects, respectively. The music will be composed by Oscar® winner Hans Zimmer (“The Lion King”).\n\nThe locations for “The Dark Knight Rises” span three continents and include the American cities of Pittsburgh, New York and Los Angeles as well as sites in India, England and Scotland.\n\n“The Dark Knight Rises” is a presentation of Warner Bros. Pictures in association with Legendary Pictures. Slated for release on July 20, 2012, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.\n\n“Security was very tight. They let you take pictures from the other side of the road, but no further. Otherwise, two big bears would start having a go at you. It was fun! You can’t see any of the inside. They have that place on proper lockdown.\n\nThey were pulling all of the equipment out. They did say they’re now finished and there would be no shoot on Friday or Saturday as they have completed it. I’m not sure if that’s true. They could be lying to try and get people to go away, but a lot of equipment was coming out. I mean a lot. There was four to five truck’s worth leaving the set. We will find out tomorrow.”"
