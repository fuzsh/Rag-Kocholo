        "text": "There may have been some outstanding productions last year, but there were also some absolute shockers. Here’s the official Hooked On Film list for the top 10 worst films of 2016.\n\n10. The Legend of Tarzan\n\n“Weighed down with lots of heavy exposition, the script loses itself very early on in trying to find a compelling reason for Tarzan and Jane to pack up and sail back to Africa. As best I can tell, it’s something to do with the King of Belgium, a crate full of conflict diamonds, an overdue bank loan and a vengeful tribal leader. It’s needlessly complicated and tremendously uninteresting – just get to the bit where Tarzan strips down to his loincloth already!”\n\nRead more\n\n9. The Boss\n\n“You could call me humourless or cynical. Perhaps I am. But sit down for The Boss after having enjoyed McCarthy in genuinely funny movies like Bridesmaids (2011) and The Heat (2013) and play back each scene as it happens. Did you laugh? Did you sympathise with Michelle? Did you buy into her story and everyone else’s? Did you think the plot was inventive? If you did on all four accounts, I applaud you for enjoying The Boss infinitely more than I did, because I sure as heck am not applauding anything else”.\n\nRead more\n\n8. Septembers of Shiraz\n\n“There is indeed very little to commend about this movie. Brody and Hayek duke it out for Over-Acting Champ. Their accents are otherworldly. The dialogue is hammered in by necessity and not by feeling. The entire production has about as much warmth as a freezing chamber. Here’s my advice: if you want to make an homage to civil freedom in Iran, it might do you some good to first cut out the Mexican actor”.\n\nRead more\n\n7. Ben-Hur\n\n“2016’s Ben-Hur is a misguided affair that fatally misunderstands who or what it wants to be, offering practically nothing to distinguish itself from its formidable legacy. Hamstrung by a weak screenplay, jarring direction and a severe lack of charisma from its core cast members, the whole thing resembles a pale imitation of a much better movie that we’ve all seen before”.\n\nRead more\n\n6. Keeping Up With The Joneses\n\n“The Joneses is unforgivably scattershot and listless. Plot threads and character traits are introduced and discarded seemingly at random. Early in the film, we see Jeff – who works in Human Resources, and is supposedly very good at it – telling slightly racist jokes to an Indian colleague. Would Jeff actually do this? Is he actually kind of racist? The film doesn’t much care”.\n\nRead more\n\n5. Sausage Party\n\n“Not the worst idea for a film ever, and indeed the stage was set for some clever chances at making commentary on society whilst rolling out an array of supermarket related jokes. Unfortunately, directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon choose to focus purely on sex jokes and racist humour, and not once is it executed in a way that is smart, or unique, or even funny”.\n\nRead more\n\n4. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates\n\n“Every stupid line fed to them by so-called writers Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O’Brien echoes a worrying sign for the state of comedy these days. In one scene, Kendrick explains how wild of an idea it would be to host a hen’s night where she and Plaza would act as undercover prostitutes to compete for the highest pay. She continues in depth with this poor excuse of a joke and describes how eventually they would reveal themselves to their unsuspecting victims’ families – which is somehow meant to be funny…?”\n\nRead more\n\n3. The Shallows\n\n“Although I was quietly excited by this film’s trailer, I was unfortunately met with everything I hoped it wouldn’t be and more. What I hoped it could be was a well written story filled with tension. What I received was Blake Lively modelling in bikinis. Coupled with numerous amounts of product placement, the whole affair – for the beginning, at least – felt akin to that of one large advertisement”.\n\nRead more\n\n2. Dirty Grandpa\n\n“I kept waiting for respite, for something sweet and calming to come along and remind me that not all is lost, that De Niro is maybe gearing up for the big joke, that he’s not really invested in such low-down, pathetic drivel. No luck. This movie doesn’t relent”.\n\nRead more\n\n1. Zoolander 2\n\n“The jokes are forced, unfunny and repetitive. Adding the word ‘hashtag’ before a line of dialogue doesn’t constitute a joke; squeezing Ariana Grande into a gimp suit isn’t a punchline; and resolving a key character arc with a gag about miscarriage is just plain distasteful. References to the original are awkwardly shoehorned in to entertain fans, but they come across as desperate and lacking in originality”.\n\nRead more\n\nImages courtesy of Roadshow Films, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and EntertainmentOne Films Australia\n\nLondon Has Fallen combines Donald Trump’s favourite things – guns, explosions, and pure xenophobia.\n\n⭐ ⭐\n\nTom Munday\n\nScottish leading man/action hero Gerard Butler is the prime example of a talented performer tripping and falling over one terrible movie after another. London Has Fallen, coming off mega-flop Gods of Egypt, continues his perplexing run of laughable, anger-inducing efforts. Sorry Butler, you are quickly running out of chances.\n\nLondon Has Fallen kicks off in true flag-waving fashion, launching a drone strike on terrorist leader Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul). Two years later, top Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Butler) has grown close with US President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Expecting his first child with wife Leah (Radha Mitchell), Banning is close to handing in his resignation. When a crippled Barkawi launches attacks throughout London during a meeting of world leaders, Asher’s heroic Number Two comes to the rescue.\n\nThanks to worthy action director Antoine Fuqua, 2013’s Olympus Has Fallen filled the void A Good Day to Die Hard left wide open. As Die Hard rip-offs go, the original is an invigorating, gleeful blend of fun action sequences, fist-pump moments, and likeable action-flick archetypes. Its sequel, placed in the hands of up-and-coming filmmaker Babak Najafi, provides all of Hollywood’s worst impulses. Despite solid character and story development early on, the movie crashes and burns during the London attack sequence. Its unadulterated absurdity hampers the enjoyment factor, with major plot-holes and inconsistencies going unanswered. Seriously, how did Barkawi and co. plan this attack in a short space of time? Or place hundreds of minions into Britain’s police force and special agencies? And how does London transition from a busy populous to uninhabited wasteland within 20 minutes?\n\nLondon Has Fallen, alongside Zoolander 2 and Grimsby, continues Hollywood’s new tradition of blockbusters that appear cheap and expensive simultaneously. For all the bluster and bravado of endless explosions, crashes, and shootouts, the CGI matches those of your average Sy-fy Channel monster flick. Potentially entertaining sequences – from motorcycle chases to helicopters ducking through skyscrapers – come off as cartoonish. However, the fistfights and shootouts are almost worth a matinee VMAX experience. The best set piece is held in one continuous take, with Banning taking out targets and dodging a hail-fire of bullets in balletic fashion.\n\nBanning is the best and worst part of London Has Fallen, transitioning from tough saviour to homicidal maniac between instalments. Everyone else, including Vice President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), bows to Banning’s inane love of violence. Worse still, the international characters are bland, dated stereotypes including a sleazy Italian President, foppish British MI6 representatives, and an army of blood-thirsty people from unnamed Middle-Eastern provinces.\n\nLondon Has Fallen, described by many as terrorism porn, deserves a foul death at the box-office. This brash, befuddling action-thriller will deter fans of the original and anyone with common sense.\n\nLondon Has Fallen is available in Australian cinemas from March 17th\n\nImage (c) Roadshow Films 2016\n\nSource: London Has Fallen Official Facebook Page\n\nAs a life-long film lover and passionate cinephile, there are three words that strike fear into the depths of my soul – ‘upcoming comedy sequel.’\n\nRhys Graeme-Drury\n\nThere are only a handful of things that we know to be certain in this world; that the sun will rise in the east, that Nicholas Cage will continue to make questionable career choices, and that sequels to popular comedy films will almost always be shit.\n\nWe’ve witnessed this trend develop over several decades, but these last few months have really hammered home the truth – that you can’t have a comedy sequel successfully maintain the magic of the original movie. You just can’t.\n\nIf you’re looking for ironclad proof, look no further than the crushing disappointment that was Zoolander 2. 15 years on from the cult classic,\n\nBen Stiller and Will Ferrell’s spy spoof sequel failed to sell itself to audiences, crashing and burning at the box office amid some toxic reviews – including my own.\n\nIn order to commemorate (or should that be commiserate?) Zoolander 2’s demise, I thought I’d reflect on the disappointing nature of comedy sequels and the reasons behind their tendency to suck.\n\nTHEY WAITED TOO LONG – Zoolander 2\n\nThis is probably the most prevalent factor shaping shit comedy sequels; nostalgia. In order to capitalise on nostalgia, studios tend to resuscitate semi-decent comedy movies from the days of yore and give them the sequel treatment. As I mentioned, the most recent and perplexing film to undergo this resurrection was Zoolander 2 – and it’s easy to see why it failed.\n\nThe original Zoolander opened in 2001, only a few short weeks after the horrifying events of 9/11. At the time it was a pretty hefty box office flop, but steady DVD sales saw the film develop a cult fanbase long after the film had left theatres. It was a film born of the era; the characters, cameos, plot, tone and jokes are very ‘2001’, in the same way that 1997’s Spice World is supremely cringe worthy in hindsight.\n\nFlash-forward to 2016 and Paramount have just learned that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Populated with the same jokes and worn-out catchphrases as the first film, Zoolander 2 is already out-dated and stale upon arrival. It isn’t 2001 anymore, and the same jokes don’t resonate with audiences when they’re delivered with such limp resolve.\n\nPut simply, they waited too long and failed to do enough to make something old feel sufficiently new again.\n\nSee also: Anchorman: The Legend Continues, Dumb and Dumber To, Vacation\n\nTHEY RUN THE JOKES INTO THE GROUND – Little Fockers\n\nRemember Meet the Parents? Remember how great that movie was? Now think about the sequel, Meet the Fockers. It’s okay, but it’s fair to say that another round of Ben Stiller vs. Robert De Niro wasn’t totally warranted.\n\nNow remember the third film, Little Fockers. I bet you’d forgotten all about it, hadn’t you? That’s because it was a terrible idea that resulted in a terrible finished product. It’s the same old shit that’s been scooped up, reheated and served to audiences on a silver platter to mask the stale stench.\n\nThere are only so many times I can witness De Niro and Stiller snarl and scowl at one another before it’s no longer amusing; there are only so many ‘Focker’ puns that I can take before something snaps. Look up ‘beating a dead horse’ in the Macquarie Dictionary and I guarantee you’ll find a screengrab from Little Fockers. Fuck, I hate this film.\n\nSee also: The Hangover trilogy, The Big Mommas House series, Austin Powers in Goldmember\n\nTHEY WERE NEVER GREAT TO BEGIN WITH – Ride Along 2\n\nMoney makes the world go round, and nowhere is this more evident than Hollywood. Even if critics tore it a new one, your movie will be assured a sequel if it raked in enough dough to justify it. Film studios have a penchant for continuing comedy franchises that have no business receiving a sequel in the first place, just so they can earn that little bit extra moolah. If you’re not convinced, look no further than the Ride Along series.\n\nI don’t think anyone would argue that the first Ride Along movie was anywhere near the realm of greatness. The repertoire that Ice Cube and Kevin Hart shared was decent, but other than that it was a formulaic, by-the-numbers comedy populated with half-arsed jokes and cookie-cutter characters.\n\nBut guess what? It made over $150 million at the box office from a meager budget of $25 million, and when the cash tills start to ring so too do the phones of studio execs determined to greenlight another film that does everything exactly the same. Cue Ride Along 2, an equally poor excuse for comedy that, all things considered, has no reason for existing other than to add to Kevin Hart’s children’s college funds.\n\nSee also: Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, Grown Ups 2, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\n\nTHEY LOSE THAT SPECIAL INGREDIENT – Evan Almighty\n\nJim Carrey must have a sixth sense for knowing when to bail on a sequel, because he’s avoided more than his fair share over the years. His ability to sidestep shit sequels almost earns a category all of its own; films that suffer by losing an extra special ingredient.\n\nFour years after fronting the wildly popular Bruce Almighty, Carrey (and his co-star Jennifer Aniston) left Universal in the lurch when they decided to depart the upcoming sequel. To combat their exit, Universal recruited Steve Carell, a supporting character from the original movie, and crudely shafted him into the lead role.\n\nIn hindsight, it was never going to work. In losing its biggest asset, Universal’s sequel ambitions were doomed from Day 1. Don’t get me wrong, I love Steve Carell; he’s a fantastic actor with immense range. Michael Scott is one of the best characters in television history, and his recent foray into drama (Foxcatcher, The Big Short) has been an inspired career move. But his everyman shtick was no replacement for the rubber-faced antics of Carrey, and his appearance in Evan Almighty was woefully ill conceived. Without the ingredient that made its precursor such a smash, this sequel was DOA.\n\nWord to the wise Hollywood – learn to quit while you’re ahead.\n\nSee also: Kick Ass 2, Son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumberer\n\nImages (c) Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures & Roadshow Films\n\nHave you ever wondered if there was more to life, other than being really, really, ridiculously good looking? To everyone involved with Zoolander 2, the answer has got to be an unmistakable no.\n\n⭐ ½\n\nRhys Graeme-Drury\n\nBefore we start, let’s get one thing straight; we need to stop kidding ourselves that the original Zoolander was some kind of comedy classic. Sure, it’s entertaining enough, and has an impressive string of quotes that fans love to repeat over and over – but deep down we all know that the charming innocence of the lead character is disguising a thin plot and dumb premise.\n\nHowever, thanks to the power of hindsight, I can now appreciate the 2001 cult classic a little more; in comparison to the sequel, the original feels like Shakespeare and Dickens rolled into one gorgeous disaster heap.\n\nA quick prologue brings us up to speed on the senseless fashionista that is Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), and we learn that Derek has spent the better part of 15 years living as a hermit away from the public eye. Disgraced and alone, Derek is given the opportunity to reconnect with his teenage son (Cyrus Arnold) and fellow model Hansel (Owen Wilson) when an invitation to an exclusive fashion event in Rome arrives on the doorstep of his remote log cabin. Plunged into a murderous conspiracy involving a series of celebrity deaths, Derek and Hansel are recruited by sultry Interpol agent Valentina (Penelope Cruz) to uncover the culprit.\n\nThis might sound like a recipe for suave spy-movie success, but don’t be fooled; Zoolander 2 is too preoccupied with parading around a buttload of desperate celebrity cameos to be concerned with something as pointless as a plot. Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato, Stingand Susan Sarandon (amongst many others) all get their fifteen seconds of fame – but simply populating a film with an endless stream of famous faces isn’t a suitable substitute for an entertaining and coherent narrative.\n\nThe jokes are forced, unfunny and repetitive. Adding the word ‘hashtag’ before a line of dialogue doesn’t constitute a joke; squeezing Ariana Grande into a gimp suit isn’t a punchline; and resolving a key character arc with a gag about miscarriage is just plain distasteful. References to the original are awkwardly shoehorned in to entertain fans, but they come across as desperate and lacking in originality. The film even finds time to squeeze in a cameo from Susan Boyle. Seriously? SuBo? How can a movie that opened a mere few days ago already feel so hideously dated? 2009 called, they want their reality TV star back.\n\nStiller (who also directs) is on autopilot as the dim-witted title character, whilst Wilson grapples with an absurd subplot concerning two competing orgies that both want to him to fuck them. All told, he could be cut out of the film entirely and it wouldn’t make a lick of difference.\n\nThe only highlight is the return of Will Ferrell as megalomaniac fashion designer Mugatu; kept on ice until well into the nonsensical third act, Ferrell is severely underused and by that point you’ll have ceased to care anyway.\n\nAs vapid and brainless as its main character, Zoolander 2 is a lazy string of pop culture references and cameo appearances masquerading as a movie. It’s an unruly mess that is completely devoid of the lovable charm and quirkiness of the original film that should be avoided at all costs.\n\nZoolander 2 is available in Australian cinemas from February 11th\n\nImages courtesy of Paramount Pictures"
