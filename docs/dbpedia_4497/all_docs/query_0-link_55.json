        "text": "I first saw Sandra in Speed (1994) and then fell in love with While You Were Sleeping (1995). It’s her girl next door charm and goofiness packed into a body with that megawatt smile. She’s charming in a way that makes her seem approachable and she brings that to most of her 60 movie credits. Of those 60 I’ve watched 29, but it’s those A movies that I’ve seen countless times that have made a lifelong fan. The vest majority of her movies that I’ve seen have been As or Bs.\n\nShe’s from Arlington, Virginia, where I was living when I met Jason. She’s adopted two children. She has a BFA in drama. She recently lost the love of her life to ALS. She’s lived the highs (winning and Oscar) with the lows (ugly divorce in the public eye).\n\nSo what is your favorite Sandra movie?\n\n*Giving these movies an A*\n\nWhile You Were Sleeping (1995) I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen this romantic comedy.\n\nThe Proposal (2009) A different kind of romantic comedy that was just as fun.\n\nThe Lake House (2006) Her domination of my favorite romantic movies continues.\n\nCrash (2004) She had a smaller part that showed her not so happy side.\n\nThe Lost City (2022) I was expecting not to like this, so imagine my surprise!\n\nBullet Train (2022) Her part in this movie was fun (and small)!\n\nSpeed (1994) As a vehicle to stardom this bus worked.\n\n*Giving these movies a B*\n\nGravity (2013) She carried a film few others could have.\n\nMiss Congeniality (2000) Just goofy fun.\n\n28 Days (2000) Dealing with addiction isn’t pretty.\n\nTwo Weeks Notice (2002) Another romantic comedy with an equally witty actor.\n\nHope Floats (1998) A romance, yes, but so much heartfelt family drama.\n\nMurder By the Numbers (2002) I love dark thrillers.\n\nThe Blind Side (2009) A well deserved Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nExtremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) A moving film dealing with 9/11.\n\nThe Net (1995) It would probably be funny to watch today with the advances we’ve made.\n\nBird Box (2018) So much stress (in a good way).\n\nThe Unforgiveable (2021) Dark.\n\nMinions (2015) Villain voices count!\n\nThe Heat (2013) Those two are hysterical!\n\nSo, so movies\n\nTwo if By Sea (1996), Forces of Nature (1999), Miss Congeniality 2 (2005), Premonition (2007)\n\nBig Fails for me\n\nAll About Steve (2009), A Fool and His Money ( 1989), Fire on the Amazon (1993) this was so bad and it had a surprising sex scene with lots of skin.\n\nSee my other Top 100 Actors here.\n\nI watched 7 movies in May and 8 in June. And I streamed 5 shows over the two months.\n\nLoved all of these- Cormoran Strike seasons 2 &3, Brigerton season 3, The Gentlemen season 1, Project Runway All-Stars season 20, and Is It Cake 3?\n\nLOVED these movies\n\nThe Holdovers, 2023. Set at a prep school in the early 70’s where several kids get left behind over Christmas break. This quiet drama had all of the things you want in a movie. Paul Giamatti was so good!\n\nKing Richard, 2021. I took a little break from Will after the slap heard round the world, but I am interested in the Williams sisters and Jason is an avid tennis player. I thought this was a fascinating look into their childhood and the driven man who helped raise and train them. I wish it hadn’t ended where it did, but that’s just my 2 cents.\n\nChampions, 2023. I love basketball and feel good movies, but, most importantly, representation matters! I’m so glad that we watched this.\n\nREALLY LIKED\n\nAmerican Fiction, 2023. A professor/novelist wants a bestseller amidst much family drama. A smart look at the boxes we put people and things into.\n\nThe Fall Guy, 2024. A silly action-packed ‘romance’ that we all really liked on the big screen. Can’t go wrong with Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt.\n\nLIKED THESE\n\nThe After, 2023. This short film is amazing for what emotion is managed to fit into less than 20 minutes. Beautiful movie-making.\n\nHit Man, 2023. Forced to portray a killer for hire on the spot, Gary learns he has a flare for it.\n\nThe Garfield Movie, 2024. Gage wanted to see it and I was pleasantly surprised. It’s nice to see Garfield winning over new generations.\n\nLove Again, 2023. A story about grief and love.\n\nUnfrosted, 2024. Silly cereal movie filled with nostalgia.\n\nMeh\n\nMother of the Bride, 2024. It’s always great to see Benjamin Bratt, but this romantic comedy fell a little flat for me.\n\nTwo if by Sea, 1996. I love both Sandra Bullock and Denis Leary, but in this they both play thieves working out some relationship issues and it just didn’t work for me.\n\nI Watched These So You Don’t Have To\n\nThe Tearsmith, Fire on the Amazon, A Fool and His Money\n\nHave we watched any of the same things?\n\nI decided to discontinue my 5 word movie reviews, but haven’t put anything in its place, so we’re going to try something new.\n\nI watched 5 movies in March and 8 in April. I also streamed season 1 of Resident Alien, 3 Body Problem on Netflix, and season 1 of C.B. Strike based on the Robert Galbraith series. All three of these were great.\n\nThese are listed in the order I liked them best. How many of these have you seen?\n\nThe Great\n\nDamsel, 2024. All things a great fairy tale should be.\n\nDune 2, 2023. I liked this one a little better than the first. It was slightly less confusing and visually stunning on the big screen.\n\nHack Your Health: Secrets of Your Gut, 2024. Short but very good documentary about gut health. So many of us with kids with autism know how important diet is and I applaud these doctors for linking autism to the gut, not just the brain. It’s not about autism. but that it was mentioned a few times in relation to gut made me happy. Not enough doctors know to help parents understand this should be one of the first steps after diagnosis.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe Batman, 2022. I love all of the Batman movies, some more than others. This was a darker look than some and thought Robert Pattinson was a fine Batman, but less than stellar Bruce Wayne.\n\nSaltburn, 2023. A creepy and oddly compelling tale of a young man wanting friends above his station in life.\n\nOppenheimer, 2023. I liked it, but thought it was too long. Good movie about the making of the bomb and the man in charge.\n\nWe Have a Ghost, 2023. Went in expecting a ghost story and got a lot more. A good family friendly film.\n\nWhere the Crawdads Sing, 2022. I liked it. Very atmospheric and loyal enough to the book.\n\nSet It Up, 2018. Cute little romantic comedy about young adults trying to figure out their lives.\n\nPlus One, 2019. An edgier romantic comedy with potential.\n\nUpgraded, 2024. Another romantic comedy, but this one has an aspiring art gallery owner lying her way to the top.\n\nIt Chapter Two, 2019. I liked part one, Gage even watched it and liked it (his first real scary movie), but this one was too violent and just boring much of the time. The kid cast was great, but the adults, even the big names, couldn’t save it for me. It’s not quite in the ugly category, but it’s close.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nThe Hunt, 2020. I have no idea why I continued to watch this past the first 10 minutes. Lots of violence and nonsensical politics.\n\nLoved the first two movies!

I’m feeling very out of touch in the blog world since I have run out of time and energy lately to post when and what I have in mind. Gage got a new medical diagnosis a few months ago and I’m trying to figure it out. Autism has a medical cause (most often more than one) and figuring it out is a very big, complicated puzzle. I’m a stubborn woman and in many ways it would be easier to say “autism, I’ll just treat that (the behaviors)” but some hero moms dig in their heels and step into the biomed world. I’ve been trying to follow in their footsteps but it takes its toll on me. It’s stressful and honestly, oftentimes, too much to deal with on top of the autism behaviors themselves, especially in the summer when schedules are often fluid. I could go into great detail, but who needs that? But, if you know of any moms who might need to talk to someone about autism, send them my way. I’ve had so many moms step up and guide me to where I need to be and paying it forward makes me feel like I’m honoring them.\n\nIt was a slow month here. Can you tell my movie choices were chosen by the boys in my life? Please tell me if you saw anything worth seeing this month!\n\nAnother month and another chance to contribute money to charity.
