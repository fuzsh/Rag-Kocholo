A few of my friends worked on the Special effects, and 2 of them on Sound tech, and they said not to expect too much on the acting front.\n\nThe acting in the Dark Knight wasn't very good unless it was one of the main characters. The extras were awful.\n\nNot to expect much on the acting front? I find that a bit hard to believe since Tom Hardy is in this film.\n\nYeah. I finally watched Memento. I guess I'm jaded after seeing his other works, so I didn't see what the big deal was. Same old shtick over and over again. I don't understand why insane plot twists are now the epitome of good writing.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nDidn't he die after the movie was released?\n\nNope. He died Jan. 2008 and the movie was released that summer.\n\nexcept he died after it was released... so... whut.\n\n(no subject) - justabwaybaby Expand\n\n(no subject) - pixiedivision Expand\n\n(no subject) - prophecypro Expand\n\n(no subject) - dutsukyampu Expand\n\n(no subject) - pixiedivision Expand\n\n(no subject) - dutsukyampu Expand\n\n(no subject) - madbiscuit Expand\n\n(no subject) - dutsukyampu Expand\n\n(no subject) - madbiscuit Expand\n\nI think it still would have attracted a large audience. Joker was the main villain, everyone wants to see Batman v. Joker.\n\nbleh\n\ni want to know more about that supposed viral campaign of the footage of the girl overdosing\n\nwhere did u hear this?\n\njust google upper footage.\n\nbut after realizing how fake the whole thing is..im not as interested anymore. i was all like omgomg for like half an hour and then was like oh.\n\nthey should have marketed it like catfish..which im still debating whether the movie was real or not.\n\nThis film is taking too long to come out--as in, it seems like it's taking forever to come out. I'm slowly losing interest...but not too much.\n\ni kind if agree, i've been following it too much and hyping it.\n\nSoon enough I wont be as excited to see the film.\n\nWhy do these Batman prequels go out of their way to be annoying???\n\nWE'RE ALL AWARE THAT THIS (most likely disappointing) MOVIE IS FUCKING COMING OUT. YOU'VE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US NOT TO NOTICE.\n\nia They could do zero marketing for this film, and I will be there opening day....along with a million other people.\n\nPrequel?\n\nAside from the paprazzi pics of the set, the promotion and viral campaign (if any) has been really lowkey compared to TDK in 2007.\n\nOmg so excited!!\n\nWow, \"Why So Serious?\" was back in 2007??? WTF where did the time go.........\n\nMTE\n\nThey've been pretty easy going with the hype for this one compared to the last. I think the pics off the set have people thinking differently but that's sort of out of their hands (I think...). Its probably gonna kick off now with the IMAX prologue and then certainly another trailer by end of spring.\n\nStill looking forward to this over the other comic book movies.\n\nI'm hoping for a full length trailer by the end of this month.\n\nI think these are MI leaks. This seems very unrelated to Batman, especially with the mention of the CIA in these scans.\n\nyeah but isnt MI being released pretty soon?\n\ndont these viral marketing campaigns usually start a year or so before the film is actually released\n\ny so srs got annoying..really fast.\n\nwhy? they're never going to top the dark knight viral campaign, and besides TDK was popular enough they dont even need to advertise this movie\n\nIt seems to me that the people who pay attention to these viral marketing campaigns are people who are already going to see the movie, and generally a small group anyway. The people who put them together just seemed addicted to getting press about themselves, idgaf."
