        "text": "Bruriah and her husband Rabbi Meir lived in the second century A.D., a time when the Rabbis declared “women are light-minded.” Bruriah, a most learned and intelligent woman, mocked their statement. In order to prove their justification, Rabbi Meir sent one of his students to seduce her. Bruriah was seduced and when she discovered that it had been planned by her husband, she died by suicide.\n\nIn the present day, a woman who also bears the name Bruriah deals with childhood trauma: a life of boycott and excommunication that was imposed on her following a book written by her father about the same act. Bruriah embarks on a journey to find the one copy of the book that may have survived. Her husband opposes the search because Bruriah’s desire to locate the book poses a threat to the lifestyle he has built for his family."
