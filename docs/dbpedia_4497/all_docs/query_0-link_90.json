The tracks move effortlessly from “face blasting energy” to deeply emotional nuanced soundscapes. The result is a superb blend of modern electronic aggression and a beautiful orchestral palette. Mr. Isham recorded the Prague National Symphony, and recorded in Dvorak Hall in order to capture the full sonic grandeur of the work.\n\n:)"
