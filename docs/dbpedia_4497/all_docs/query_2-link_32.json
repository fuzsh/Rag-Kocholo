        "text": "Abbas Kiarostami, master of post-revolution Iranian cinema, dies at 76\n\nMovie session times\n\nFull movies coverage\n\n★½\n\nAs I write, cinephiles around the world are mourning the death of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, few of whose films were ever released in Australia. Under such circumstances, it's harder than ever to have much tolerance for the woefully titled Septembers of Shiraz, a wildly inauthentic American melodrama about the 1979 Iranian revolution, shot in Bulgaria by the Australian director Wayne Blair (The Sapphires) with Hollywood stars in the lead roles.\n\nThese stars, Adrien Brody and Salma Hayek, play Isaac and Farnez Amin, a wealthy Jewish couple from Tehran. Though seemingly apolitical, they're identified as potential enemies of the state: Isaac is arrested, leading to repetitive scenes where he's tortured, while Farnez and their children wait desperately for his release.\n\nPolitically speaking, Blair and screenwriter Hanna Weg (adapting a novel by Dalia Sofer) have to walk a tricky line. They're understandably negative about the revolution, which led directly to Iran's current hardline Islamic regime – yet they acknowledge that the previous rule of the shah left much to be desired as well.\n\nThis leaves the film with no real dramatic centre: Isaac and Farnez are portrayed as complacent yet innocent, caught up in these events as they might be in a natural disaster.\n\nThe most interesting character is the Amins' maid Habibeh, forcefully played by Shohreh Aghdashloo, a veteran Iranian actress who worked with Kiarostami before relocating to America. Torn between her residual loyalty to her employers and the revolutionary fervour of her son (Navid Navid), Habibeh has a genuine conflict to face. But this is inevitably sidelined in favour of conventional suspense sequences as the Amins try to make their escape.\n\nBlair is out of his depth, but he does have the advantage of cinematographer Warwick Thornton, who also collaborated with him on The Sapphires, and here manages some striking if unsubtle lighting effects, especially when Isaac is suffering in his darkened cell.\n\nThornton is better known as the director of Samson and Delilah, an Australian film Kiarostami might have appreciated. It's good to see him keeping busy, but it's high time he got back to projects of his own."
