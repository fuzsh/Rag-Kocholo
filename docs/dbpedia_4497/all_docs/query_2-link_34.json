        "text": "Taking place in post-revolutionary Iran, Wayne Blair’s “Septembers of Shiraz” stars Adrien Brody and Salma Hayek as a Jewish couple who give up their possessions to the cause but still find themselves enemies of it. A new clip from the adaptation of Dalia Sofer’s 2007 novel, which comes to theaters next week, gives a sense of Blair’s brand of suspense.\n\nREAD MORE: Salma Hayek: Why European Cinema Is Much Kinder To Aging Actresses Than Hollywood\n\nIn it, an accented Brody finds himself inside an empty cell lit only by the flashlight of the masked man who enters and offers him water. The two have a brief chat about the cathartic power of tears before the interrogator hands Brody a Quran: “You might find it helpful,” he tells him through the burlap sack covering his face. “You have to believe that you will make it. Have faith.”\n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Adrien Brody Is An Endangered Species In Trailer For ‘Manhattan Night’\n\n“Septembers of Shiraz” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall, eventually being picked up for stateside distribution by Momentum Pictures, who will release it theatrically on June 24."
