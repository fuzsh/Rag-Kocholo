        "text": "When we decided to plan our trip, we only knew two things about Malta: it was supposed to be beautiful, and it’s easy to reach from Sicily. Of course, that says almost nothing about this gorgeous island chain, its ancient history, its unique architecture, or the fact that basically everything there is breathtaking. During our four days in Malta, we learned quite a lot—much of which surprised us. Here are a few things worth knowing before visiting Malta island.\n\nThere are a lot of people in a small space\n\nMalta is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and the number of tourists is growing every year. Most of the time, it didn’t feel that crowded…until we tried to go somewhere.\n\nTraffic jams—especially in Valletta—are no joke, so that has to be factored in whenever you’re trying to get somewhere at a certain time (like the ferry to Gozo). Getting around by bus isn’t much easier because when the buses fill up, they bypass certain stops and another one may not come for 20-30 minutes. Getting around is manageable but requires planning, patience, and lots of flexibility.\n\nChurches are elaborate (and numerous)\n\nMalta likes to say it has a church for every day of the year. In reality, the number may be a handful shy of 365, but that’s still a huge number of churches for such a small country (more than 3 per square mile). And these aren’t basic churches. The ornate interiors blew us away.\n\nOn our first day, we visited St. John’s Co-Cathedral in Valletta, Malta’s capital city, which made us rethink our previous definition of “ornate.” Seemingly every inch of the grand cathedral is covered in gold, scrollwork, colorful carving, or detailed painting (and sometimes all four at once). And that’s just one example of many.\n\nPastizzi reign\n\nMaltese cuisine is unique—a blend of Mediterranean, northwest African, and English. We sampled as much as possible in our week in the country.\n\nThe favorite Maltese snack quickly became our favorite, too. The simple pastries called pastizzi (“pastizz” is the singular) are flaky crusts similar to phyllo filled with ricotta or mashed peas. They’re always eaten with your hands and sometimes on the go, so locals will look at you oddly if you ask for silverware, even if you’re at a pub and the pastizzi are huge and piping hot.\n\nBalconies are everywhere on Malta island\n\nNearly every street is lined with houses that have colorful enclosed balconies. The effect makes it feel like you’re walking through Renaissance-era Venice.\n\nThe history behind the balconies is a bit murky. Some sources say that they arose in the last part of the 17th century as the Baroque movement spread in Europe. Others attribute it to the Arab influence where woman were not to be seen. Either way, the balconies contribute to the feeling that Malta is a place like no other.\n\nMalta is a living movie set\n\nMalta has unique architecture, dramatic landscapes, and stunning coastline, plus it’s relatively obscure. This combination of exceptional features makes it the perfect stand-in for other locations modern, historical, and fanciful.\n\nMalta has appeared as ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt in movies like Gladiator and Troy. It’s been the location of the Red Keep and other locations in Game of Thrones. The set of the Robin Williams movie Popeye has even been turned into a permanent theme park on the island’s north end. Just a few minutes driving around the island will make it clear why so many movie studios thought this was the place to be.\n\nIf you book through the affiliate links below, we may earn a small commission (at no extra cost to you)."
