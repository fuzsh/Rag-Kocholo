It is situated centrally in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily, Italy. Malta's geographic position between the European Union region and Africa makes it a target for immigration. The government system is a republic; the chief of state is the president, and the head of government is the prime minister. Malta has a mixed economic system, which includes a variety of private freedoms combined with centralized economic planning and government regulation. Malta is a member of the European Union (EU).\n\nCountry Comparator\n\nSelect variable and countries to compare in table format.\n\nCountry Rankings\n\nRank ordering and interactive map.
