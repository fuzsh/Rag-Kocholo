        "text": "1. The weather in Malta\n\nYes, the most obvious one: the weather in Malta.\n\nWhen you live in Malta, you don’t have to worry about bad weather.\n\nThe highest temperatures in Malta are in July and August with a maximum of 31.8 degrees Celsius; the lowest temperatures are in January and February with a minimum of 9 degrees Celsius.\n\nYes, in summer it can get hot from time to time (maximum temperature on very hot days up to 37 degrees). Since here air conditioning is part of the basic equipment in (almost) every apartment, you can always cool down at home or even in restaurants or shopping malls.\n\nIn the months from April/May to October/November, the water and outdoor temperature are pleasant (between 15 and 22 degrees Celsius) that you can go swimming. In other words, you can go swimming between 7-8 months a year, depending on what type of person you are. Of course, some tough swimmers still jump into the water in December.\n\nThere are almost no rainy days in Malta in the summer, but a few in the winter months. When it rains in Malta, it is usually monsoon-like for a short period; then the skies quickly clear again and the sun shines.\n\nMost residents and migrants like the rainy days in winter, which are a nice break from summer. Especially the fact that the rain turns the island green and the ‘cool’ temperatures lend to long walks.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Malta\n\n2. The clean, turquoise-blue water on Malta\n\nMalta has one of the cleanest and clearest seas in Europe (source ). It is not without reason that Malta (and also the neighboring islands of Gozo and Comino) is a popular destination for snorkeling enthusiasts and deep divers.\n\nMalta even has some of the best snorkeling sites in Europe. You can find sloping and rising rock formations with holes and caves diving through reefs and shipwrecks.\n\nMalta consists mainly of a rocky coastline. Of course, Malta also has many great sandy beaches, such as Golden Bay, Riviera Beach, Balluta Bay and some more. However, most of the Mediterranean island is surrounded by a rocky coast. Due to this, you can go snorkeling excellently. You can see down to the bottom due to the clean water and see colorful schools of fish and corals in all colors. To be honest, I have never seen such a variety in the water in Europe. So even if you are just going to visit the island as a tourist, a little snorkeling session is a must-do!\n\n3. The sea in front of your nose\n\nNot to mention that the water quality of the sea is super for snorkeling, the fact that you can be at the sea in a maximum of 20 minutes on the whole island, no matter where you are, is a plus in itself. This means for you: jumping into the sea after or before work can become a routine for you.\n\nFor me, the sea, the vastness, has a calming stillness that is very soothing after a long day of work.\n\n4. The Maltese food\n\nMaltese cuisine is famous throughout Europe – the food is unique and delicious. In Maltese cuisine, European and North African cuisine come together and are adapted with local ingredients. Typical Maltese food is rabbit or pastizzi. Pastizzi are available salty or sweet: they are like puff pastry and come filled with cheese, spinach, meat, peas, beans, or even Nutella.\n\nBut even if Maltese cuisine doesn’t suit you, you’ll find dishes from all over the world here. Malta’s internationality doesn’t stop here: from vegan burgers to Chinese food to German currywurst, you’ll find everything here.\n\nFish lovers, in particular, will get their money’s worth here: you can get freshly caught, delicious fish in almost every restaurant, which you can enjoy on the promenade by the sea.\n\n5. Breathtaking sunrises and sunsets in Malta\n\nMalta’s sunrises and sunsets are phenomenal. Every day you can marvel at this beauty. Be it on the beach or at a restaurant or picnic, many places in Malta make the sunset extra special. My favourite sunset spots are Riviera Beach, Poppey Village and Dingli Cliffs. You can marvel at the sunrises in Malta along the coast of Sliema.\n\n6. Countless hiking routes\n\nYes, although you might not suspect it, Malta has some beautiful walking routes. Especially in winter, when it rains from time to time, the landscape shines in green and you can go hiking along the coast. You will find many small bays and beaches that you can only reach by foot (or boat).\n\nIf hiking is not enough for you, there is also the possibility to explore the island on mountain bike tours. For the sporty among you, there is also the possibility to rent a kayak and explore Malta from the water. Climbing fans also get their money’s worth: cliffs made of centuries-old salt pans attract many climbing enthusiasts every year.\n\n7. Maltese architecture and old towns\n\nEspecially in Sliema and Saint Juliens you will find many small alleys with the typical Maltese balconies (gallariji), which light up in different colours. This type of architecture has been influenced by several Mediterranean cultures and British architecture throughout its history, giving the Mediterranean island its very own charm.\n\nThe view from Sliema to Valletta to the dome of Malta City – is priceless to me every time.\n\n8. Malta’s ancient history\n\nMalta’s history goes back more than seven thousand years, with colossal temples and palaces with lavish frescoes.\n\nYou will also find the oldest cairns in the world on Malta and a UNESCO World Heritage Site older than Stonehenge or the Pyramids of Giza – the Ggantija Temples on Gozo. Older than Stonehenge or the Pyramids of Giza!\n\n9. Mediterranean lifestyle\n\nDon’t fancy a hectic life? Then Malta is the right place for you. Everything is close together on Malta, the island is surrounded by the sea – so you will rarely find stressed inhabitants on the island.\n\n10. Hospitality\n\nWhen you stay in Malta, you are not just a guest, you become a member of the family. The Maltese are very hospitable people. I myself am always pleasantly surprised at how nice the Maltese are. When I am looking for directions, it is not uncommon for Maltese to even guide me to my destination.\n\nThey are considered linguists, as both Maltese and English are recognized as official languages in the country. A good two-thirds of the population also speak Italian.\n\nMaltese love their family and are very closely connected to the church. Over 90% of the population describes themselves as Catholic.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the Maltese are politically active. Like a football team, support is sometimes given at birth. Maltese has one of the highest voter turnouts in the world.\n\n11. Idyllic and big city at the same time\n\nDespite Malta’s tranquil size, everyone gets their money’s worth here: Do you prefer it quieter and idyllic? Then the neighboring island of Gozo is for you. At the weekend, would you like to go to bars and enjoy the nightlife? That is also possible in Malta. To be more precise, you can do this in Paceville. Malta is slowly establishing itself as a party destination in Europe. Expensive cocktail bars, nightclubs, rooftop bars, wine bars, party beaches, open-air venues and summer concerts are everywhere.\n\n12. Festivals & events\n\nMalta is the place to be if you like festivals. The locals know how to put on a festival in honor of some of life’s most delicious delights. So you can be sure to discover a festival dedicated to beer, wine, lemons, strawberries, bread, chocolate, figs or olives. Also discover, for example, the pagan-looking traditional festivals in honor of Catholic saints celebrated by devout Christians!\n\nIn addition to local festivals, there are also plenty of international festivals and events throughout the year, so you could spend almost every weekend with them.\n\n13. Health care system Malta\n\nThe Mediterranean island is repeatedly praised by the WHO. According to the WHO, it has the fifth-best health care system in the world (https://photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html).\n\nMalta’s European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) offers free benefits to all Maltese citizens and resident EU citizens, even outside Malta.\n\nThe Mediterranean island has private and public health insurance. If you have public insurance, you may have to wait longer for routine check-ups. However, this is not a big deal, because for a small extra charge (max. 20 euros) you can see a doctor in a (usually larger) pharmacy and get treated there.\n\nNon-EU citizens living in Malta must take out private health insurance. Depending on age, state of health and needs, the cost of such insurance may vary.\n\n14 Tax advantages\n\nMoving to Malta can bring tax benefits, among many other advantages. If you relocate your business to Malta, your company will be subject to excellent tax rules. This is because income tax in Malta is just between 20% and 35% and is progressively graduated.\n\nIf you have your centre of living in Malta, your income will also be taxed in Malta.\n\nVAT is also much lower than in other EU countries. The standard rate of VAT is 18%; the reduced rate is 5% and 7%.\n\nYou pay 12% tax on the sale value of a property.\n\nFind out more about the Maltese tax structure here.\n\n15. Language English\n\nThe language of the place of emigration is an important aspect. After all, you need to be able to communicate in the country where you live.\n\nThe good thing about Malta is that the Maltese speak fluent English! Due to the former British colony, the majority of the locals speak fluent English, so communication and fitting in should not be a big problem.\n\nAnother positive factor: the documents of the authorities are available in English and Maltese. So you don’t need a translator to emigrate to Malta.\n\nThe end\n\nIf you also live in Malta and would like to suggest a testimonial or reasons to live in Malta, feel free to write us or use the comment box below.\n\nI am looking forward to your suggestions!\n\nYour Philipp M. Sauerborn"
