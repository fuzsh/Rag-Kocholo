        "text": "Malta is an island nation that consists of three islands: main island Malta, Gozo and Comino. The country’s official languages are Maltese and English.\n\nMalta’s capital city is Valletta, which is centrally located on the island’s north coast and has the island’s largest harbour.\n\nThe main island of Malta is the largest and most developed island. Its sister island of Gozo is idyllic and peaceful and mostly rural, offering breathtaking views and great opportunities for outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking and rock climbing.\n\nComino is the smallest island of the three and is inhabited by only a few people. The island hosts a hotel renowned for its hospitality and facilities to spend relaxing holidays in Malta and is the location for one of Malta’s most beautiful bays: the Blue Lagoon.\n\nWhere is Malta on the World Map?\n\nOf the three islands, Malta is by far the largest in geographical size, at around 246 square km (95 sq miles), with Gozo coming in second at only 67 sq km (26 sq miles), while Comino is the smallest of the inhabited Maltese islands at just 2.7 square km (1 sq mile). 92% Of the country’s population reside in Malta, where most urbanisation took place towards the North-Eastern side of the island, with Valletta and its Harbour areas at the centre of the most densely populated parts.\n\nWith its large harbours, it’s no surprise that the island Malta has the highest population density compared to that of Gozo, while Comino is currently inhabited by only two people. Among all EU member states, Malta has the highest percentage of built-up land, at over 30%. (Source: European Environment Agency)\n\nThis is the map of Malta:\n\nAbout the Maltese\n\nThe Maltese are a proud people, with a unique culture that has been shaped by foreign cultures during several ages of occupancy.\n\nMany falsely believe Maltese culture as merely being a melting pot of cultures introduced by foreign empires, however, foreign influences moulded a collection of pre-existing, age-old traditions, customs and values passed on through successive generations of Maltese and Gozitans.\n\nThe country has two official languages, with a large number of the population speaking both Maltese and English."
