Yet, just 80 kilometres south of Italy, in the heart of the Mediterranean lies a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. Malta may look like nothing more than a small archipelago, but if you scratch under the surface you will discover a rich history and vibrant culture which has long been Europe's best-kept secret. Still deciding where to travel this summer? Embark on a journey to this enchanting island nation and experience its captivating allure. Here are our top 10 reasons why you should visit Malta.\n\nThis small island nation has been around for thousands of years, so it is no surprise that it is brimming with ancient sites and architectural wonders. One of the top places to visit in Malta is the UNESCO-listed capital city of Valletta. This city is a living museum with baroque palaces, grand cathedrals, and fortified walls greeting you at every turn. Another place not to miss if you plan to visit Malta is the ancient city of Mdina, known as the \"Silent City\". Step back in time and stroll along its narrow cobblestone streets and don’t forget to stop to admire the beautiful mediaeval architecture. It will be hard not to feel captivated by the unique blend of European, Arab, and North African influences that have shaped Malta's architectural heritage throughout history.\n\nWhile it is easy to imagine Malta as nothing more than stunning cities and beautiful beaches, in reality, it boasts an astonishing variety of natural landscapes. If you are thinking to visit Malta, expect to uncover everything from dramatic cliffs and secluded coves to azure blue waters and picturesque countryside. Nature enthusiasts will rejoice as every corner of this island is full of interesting places to visit in Malta.\n\nOne of the most famous natural landmarks was the stunning Azure Window, a natural limestone arch that once drew in the crowds until its collapse. But there are still many picturesque coastal spots to discover. Take to the Ocean and enjoy a boat trip to the mesmerising Blue Grotto. This series of sea caves are adorned with vibrant colours and are best explored while taking part in a snorkelling or scuba-diving excursion.\n\nThanks to its strategic location, Malta's culinary scene is an eclectic fusion of Mediterranean flavours, influenced by its diverse history. Eating out is a must-do in Malta so be ready to (over)indulge in traditional Maltese dishes such as rabbit stew (fenek), crispy pastizzi pastries, and hearty fish soups. Seafood is a big deal and is often spotted on the menus alongside other delicious dishes made using locally sourced ingredients, all best served with a glass of chilled regional wines. Foodies will also love exploring the vibrant food markets, charming village restaurants, and trendy cafes.\n\nWhat better way to get to know a place than to participate in its traditional celebrations? Maltese culture is deeply rooted in ritual and offers those who want to visit Malta, a calendar packed full of vibrant festivals and cultural events. Throughout the year, the island is brought to life with a range of vibrant events ranging from the grandeur of Valletta's Baroque Festival to the lively Carnival celebrations.\n\nCalling all Game of Thrones fans! Did you know? Malta was used as a filming location for this beloved series. While you are sightseeing in Malta, walk in the footsteps of your favourite characters as you explore the ancient walled city of Mdina, which was transformed into King's Landing. And not just that, the awe-inspiring, towering cliffs of the island of Gozo, were the backdrop of the wedding scene of Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo. Feel as though you are part of the epic fantasy world of Westeros as you delve into the real-life settings that brought the Seven Kingdoms to life.\n\nThere is something about island souls that makes them irresistibly charming. The Maltese are no different. Locals share a deep sense of pride in their island and are eager to share their culture and traditions with visitors. If you plan to visit Malta, from the moment you step foot on island soil, you'll be greeted with a smile and a warm welcome.
