        "text": "We ended up with 80% of our locations in Malta. It was quite extraordinary. I did not expect that!\n\nKEVIN REYNOLDS, DIRECTOR, \"THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO\"\n\n\"The water in Malta is as clear as the Caribbean.”\n\nERIC BÖRJESON, UNDERWATER CINEMATOGRAPHER\n\nThe Maltese Islands\n\nThe Maltese Islands consist of Malta, Gozo, Comino and two other uninhabited islands. They are situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea 93 km from Sicily and 290 km from North Africa. The total area is 316 square kilometres (Malta 246, Gozo 67, Comino 2.7). The longest distance in Malta from the south-east to north-west is about 27 km and the longest distance at its width is 14.5km in an east-westerly direction. The corresponding figures for Gozo are 14.5 km and 7.2 km. The length of the shoreline round Malta is 137 km and round Gozo is 43 km.\n\nThe three islands of Malta\n\nWEATHER\n\n​\n\n​In brief: Mediterranean; Mild, rainy winters; Hot, dry summers.\n\nThe climate in Malta is generally warm. Rainfall is almost negligible between June and August, where the temperature at that period averages at its highest around 30°C (86° F). The highest temperature ever recorded was 43°C (109.4°F) but these isolated moments are usually short heatwaves lasting for a couple of days only. It does not snow in Malta.\n\nAverage daily mean temperature range from around 13°C (55.4°F) from December to February, to 26°C (78.8°F) from June to August. Fortunately it is not unusual for temperatures to reach 20°C (68°F) during the winter months.\n\nAverage hours of daylight range from around as high as 14 hours in summer to as low as 10 hours in the winter.\n\nAverage sunshine hours range from around 11.5 to 12 hours in summer to 5 to 6 hours in winter.\n\nAverage rainfall in mm ranges from 3mm in summer to 98mm in winter, with the wettest months being in the following order: November, December, January and then October & September (the latter two being very similar).\n\nAverage number of rainy days is as follows:\n\nJanuary - 15 days\n\nFebruary - 12 days\n\nMarch - 9 days\n\nApril - 6 days\n\nMay - 3 days\n\nJune - 1 day\n\nJuly - 0 days\n\nAugust - 1 days\n\nSeptember - 5 days\n\nOctober - 9 days\n\nNovember - 13 days\n\nDecember - 16 days\n\nFairly reliable weather statistics that match our official data from the national weather station can be found here."
