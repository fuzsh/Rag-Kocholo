You may have heard about this island nation, but like most people, you might be wondering where is Malta?\n\nWhere is Malta located?\n\nThis small island nation of Malta is situated in the centre of the Mediterranean sea in Europe. You’ll find it nestled between the south of Sicily and the North African coast. It consists of three islands; the main island Malta, Comino and Gozo.\n\nMap of Malta\n\nDo you still need some more information to grasp where is Malta? Take a look at this interactive map.\n\nDive into a brief background of Malta\n\nMajorly steeped in folklore and religion, the Maltese customs can be seen throughout homes and the streets. The strong Catholic faith influences the culture, ethics and everyday life of the Maltese. The people of Malta are extremely friendly, with a small population of approximately 460,500 people, it really is a case of everybody knows everybody with a strong sense of community.\n\nTips to help you navigate through Malta with ease:\n\nEnglish is the second official language. 76% of the population speaks English.\n\nDrivers tend to prefer driving in the shade and indicators are not always used. If a car in front of you does bother to indicate, don’t be surprised if it turns in the opposite direction from that indicated.\n\nIt’s best to hire a car to get around. Especially when you’re sightseeing.\n\nAvoid talking about politics. The Maltese take their politics very seriously so it’s best to leave the subject matter altogether.\n\nWhy visit Malta?\n\nArchitecture\n\nThere is so much beautiful architecture to see in cities like Valetta. You’ll see the influence of various Mediterranean and British cultures. The gallerias are a beautiful attraction in the heart of Valetta. You’ll discover the visual wonders of the Maltese landscape.
