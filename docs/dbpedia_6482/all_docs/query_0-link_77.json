        "text": "Marchese Guiseppe Scicluna was born in 1855 to Gio Batta Scicluna (1814-1861) and Carmela Bugeja.\n\nWas given the title of Marchese in 1878 by Pope Pius IX alongside his uncle Emmanuele Scicluna.\n\nIt is known to our family that the named Guiseppe Scicluna, at the time aged 37 years, had an affair with one of his maidservants (Abela-name unknown). From this affair, which approximately happened in June/July of 1892, the maidservant got pregnant. During her childbirth which happend on the 24th March 1893, she produced a son whom she named Joseph. The Midwife told the mother that since the child was her 'salib', she should give him the surname of 'Saliba'. On Joseph Saliba's birth certificate, the father is written as unknown.\n\nIt is known that the maidservant then married someone surnamed 'Portelli' and produced more children. Furthermore, Guiseppe Scicluna married Corinne Abela Pulis in the year 1901, at the age of 46. His son, Joseph Saliba, at the time was aged 8 years. This marriage produced John A. Scicluna born in the year 1903.\n\nAlthough Guiseppe Scicluna did not recognise his son Joseph Saliba, he supported his son and paid for his education which occuried in a boarding school. Guiseppe Scicluna died in the year 1907, at the age of 51, and his son Joseph Saliba was 14 years old. After, Guiseppe Scicluna's death, his wife and son still continued respecting Joseph Saliba.\n\nAs Joseph Saliba grew up he met Vincenza Zammit Flores, who at the time the latter was from a noble family (Countess) and owned a candle factory, which at the time proved to be profitable. Vincenza's family objected to this marriage however, she insisted and was ready to be disowned as long as she married Joseph Saliba, which she finally did.\n\nReference of Scicluna's Family Tree:\n\nhttp://www.allmalta.com/folklore/p_034.html\n\nhttp://user.orbit.net.mt/fournier/scicluna.htm"
