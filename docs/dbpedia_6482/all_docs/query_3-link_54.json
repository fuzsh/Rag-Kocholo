        "text": "Have you ever wondered what it is like living in Malta? If you are considering relocating to a different country, Malta is the right choice! This beautiful Mediterranean island offers a lot, and you will enjoy living here.\n\nLife in Malta\n\nThe climate is one of the best things about living in Malta. Additionally, the crime rate is meagre. There are also plenty of things to do on the island like visiting historical sites, beautiful beaches, and nature parks.\n\nBesides having a stable economy, low unemployment rates and one of the world’s best climates, Malta offers excellent schooling, healthcare and an overall safe environment.\n\n4. Government\n\nMalta is a parliamentary republic, and the head of state is the President, whom Parliament elects. Malta has a unicameral parliament, known as the House of Representatives, elected by universal suffrage every five years.\n\nThe Prime Minister, the head of government, is elected by Parliament among its members. Malta’s legal system is based on English common law.\n\nMalta also has close ties with the Commonwealth of Nations. No one group or class dominates society or the economy.\n\n5. Religion\n\nThe Constitution of Malta recognises the Roman Catholic Church as the state religion.\n\nHowever, freedom of religion is guaranteed by law, and all religions are treated equally.\n\nThe majority of the Maltese population is Roman Catholic, with a small number of other Christian denominations such as the Anglican Church, Seventh-day Adventists, Methodists, Baptists, and Pentecostals also represented.\n\nFurthermore, Malta has a Muslim community and a small number of Hindu and Buddhist residents.\n\n6. Education\n\nRelocating to a new country can sometimes be challenging for yourself and your family, especially regarding children. The school chosen for them is one thing that can make the settling down process easier for kids.\n\nThe education system in Malta is ranked highly, and most schools follow the British curriculum with a wide range of subjects to learn.\n\nIt is also mandatory for children to attend school in Malta up to the age of 16. The schools in Malta can be divided into three categories, namely:\n\nState Schools\n\nChurch Schools\n\nIndependent Schools\n\nThe system is structured into four stages:\n\nPre-primary (ages three to five)\n\nPrimary (ages five to eleven)\n\nSecondary (ages eleven to eighteen)\n\nTertiary education (post-secondary education like college/university).\n\nMalta also has several schools for children with special needs. Such schools are equipped with everything and have all the resources a specially-abled child would require to progress and learn.\n\nThe schools have specialist teachers trained to help children with special needs study.\n\nEducation for Foreigners Moving to Malta\n\nCitizens of non-EU countries can apply for exemptions, which is done through a special application process. This policy applies to exemptions from fees payable at several educational institutions. The board shall consider applications for exemptions from fees if:\n\nThe applicant is a third-country national who has obtained a long-term residence permit or EU Blue Card\n\nOR\n\nThe applicant is a ‘family member’ of a third-country national who has obtained a long-term residence permit or EU Blue Card and is entitled to equal access to education as Maltese nationals following the Family Reunification Regulations (LN 150 of 2007)."
