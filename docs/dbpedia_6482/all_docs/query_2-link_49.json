These monarchs make the reserve their home until Spring, and during their stay, they rest, reproduce, and prepare for the long journey back. During this eight-month cycle, it is estimated that five generations of these beautiful butterflies are born and die. In contrast to the sheer enormity of the Monarchs in this image, in reality, sights like this could potentially become rare in the future. This is entirely because of the realities of climate change, deforestation, and pesticide exposure, including an overall loss of the milkweed plant, the only plant in which the Monarch lays their eggs. However, all is not lost, with many organizations in the United States and Mexico mobilizing to save this incredible migratory effort, with promising numbers leading the International Union for the Conservation of Nature classifying this behavior vulnerable as opposed to endangered.\n\nJaime Rojo\n\nMadrid, Spain\n\nJaime Rojo is a photographer and National Geographic Explorer who specializes in environmental stories about wilderness and wildlife. A passionate advocate for conservation, he hopes his images ultimately become tools for protecting nature. His most recent project, Saving the Monarchs, was featured as a cover story for National Geographic Magazine depicting the migration of the Monarch Butterflies, including their natural history, the threats they face, and the people working to protect them. Jaime is an International League of Conservation Photographers Senior Fellow, a trustee of the WILD Foundation, and is the recipient of honors in competitions such as World Press Photo, Wildlife Photographer of the Year, and Picture of the Year International.Â\n\nGrand prize winner\n\nCities Gone Wild\n\nCorey Arnold | Washington, United States\n\nVarious Urban Areas, United States\n\nNeed stuff here too.\n\nAquatic Life Finalist\n\nMerche Llobera | Madrid, Spain\n\nHow Many Dolphins Is Too Many?\n\nDrake Bay, Costa Rica\n\nMost widely known for their aerial abilities, Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are also known toÂ travel in large pods, some in so-called superpods where their numbers reach the thousands. Though they are the most abundant dolphin species on Earth, with five separate geographic morphs found in tropical and subtropical waters around the globe, itâs rare to capture a photo of so many of these incredible creatures at once.Â\n\nAquatic Life Finalist\n\nLuc Rooman | Kieldrecht, Belgium\n\nPike Place\n\nDe Melle Turnhout, Belgium\n\nThis photographer demonstrates that beauty can be found in the most unexpected places, even in the visage of a Northern pike (Esox lucius). Though this species is an unlikely candidate for a glamor shot, itâs difficult not to be captivated by its almost-iridescent green sheen as it navigates through red water lilies.Â\n\nAquatic Life Finalist\n\nScott Portelli | Sydney, Australia\n\nBubble-Net Feeding\n\nAntarctica\n\nAn incredible aerial image of Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) engaging in a difficult-to-document phenomena known as bubble-net feeding. A concerted social effort requiring lots of cooperation and communicationâ bubble-net feeding involves whales diving below their prey, a lead typically using bubbles blown from their blowholes to disarm and trap fish at the surface. The remaining whales surround the fish, with all of the whales swimming in a spiral formation to keep the fish within their control, resulting in the mesmerizing image seen here.\n\nAquatic Life Finalist\n\nDennis Corpuz | Mabini, Batangas, Philippines\n\nParenthood\n\nAnilao Batangas, Philippines\n\nOutside of the movies, itâs fairly rare to see a clownfish parenting its young up close. A Tomato clownfish (Amphiprion frenatus) demonstrates a number of unique behaviors, primarily the act of aerating its youngâa behavior typically performed by the male and involves mouthing and fanning the eggs. This tactic may prevent bacteria or algae from growing on them, as well as displace any non-viable eggs, which could conceivably rot and spread to nearby healthy ones. This image also shows the mutually symbiotic relationship between clownfish and Sea anemones (order Actiniaria). Tomato clownfish, naturally resistant to anemone venom, lay their eggs in and around an anemone's proximity for shelter and protection, and in return, the clownfish's bright exterior attracts meals for its host.Â\n\nAquatic Life Finalist\n\nMarco Gargiulo | Sorrento, ItalyÂ\n\nThe Passenger\n\nSorrento, Italy\n\nA shore fish appears to catch a ride on, or possibly become the next meal of, a phosphorescent jellyfish (Pelagia noctyluca) under the watchful eye of a snow-peaked Mt. Vesuvius. Though snowfall seems antithetical to the notion of a volcano, itâs not uncommon for temperatures to drop low enough for Mt. Vesuvius to receive a dusting.Â\n\nAquatic Life Finalist\n\nAshley Sykes | Cordeaux Heights, NSW, Australia\n\nBabyâs Big Wave\n\nCoastal Gerringong, NSW, Australia\n\nA Humpback whale calf (Megaptera novaeangliae) breaching off the coast of Australia, where nearly half of the entire world's population of humpback whales migrate from Antarctica to and back again, every year. An aerial image like this of the breach is impressive, especially since it includes a clear view of this whale's cluster of cyamids. Often mistaken for barnacles, these clingy crustaceans are also known as Whale lice (family Cyamidae), and each humpback whale has their own distinct varietal of them.Â Â\n\nAquatic Life\n\nView Finalists in this category\n\nTadpole Migration\n\nVancouver Island, Canada\n\nThese Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) tadpoles migrate each day en masse from the deepest parts of this lake to the sunlit shallows to feed on algae. Though less secure than they would be in the relatively safe depths, this photographer noted that even still, these tadpoles were not camera shy and allowed him to come in for their close-up. (In fact, if he stayed still they would start to nibble on his camera and skin.)\n\nShane Gross\n\nNanaimo, Canada\n\nShane Gross is a Canadian marine conservation photojournalist. An avid adorer of sharks since childhood, his passion has since grown into a love for all underwater beings. An Associate Fellow with the International League of Conservation Photographers and âmulti-year winner of the NHM Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, Shane is driven by telling long-form narratives about the ocean and humanityâs impact on herâboth positive and negative.Â\n\nAquatic Life winner\n\nOf Blades & Spines\n\nKate Vylet | Santa Cruz, United States\n\nCarmel Bay, United States\n\nTERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE Finalist\n\nDeena Sveinsson | Estes Park, Colorado, United States\n\nThe Fast and the Furriest\n\nGrand Teton National Park, Jackson, Wyoming, United States\n\nThis perfectly composed photograph underscores the photographerâs perspective on Moose (Alces alces) as gentle giants with playful spiritsâeach with their own unique personalityârather than as stereotypically dangerous and aggressive animals. On this day, she spotted three young bull moose playing and romping. With most of the other photographers in the area chasing the larger and more mature bulls, she instead spent hours focusing on these young moose. As they started to walk briskly toward the waterâs edge, she quietly got into the cold water with her camera and the hope of getting a specific, not often-seen perspective: young bull moose moving through water, playing, and looking larger than life.\n\nTERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE Finalist\n\nRadomir Jakubowski | Saarbruecken, Germany\n\nKing of the Mountains\n\nBerner Oberland Switzerland, Switzerland\n\nThe elusive Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) was on the verge of extinction just 100 years ago. Now, after concerted conservation efforts, its population has ballooned from just under 100 to nearly 30,000âwith all living Alpine Ibexes descending from the same stock from the Gran Paradiso National Park in Italy. The specificity of the shot and the mysterious subject make this a photographic feat in more ways than one!Â\n\nTERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE Finalist\n\nLarry Taylor | Clancy, Montana, United States\n\nQuick Climb\n\nYellowstone National Park, Montana, United States\n\nAfter hours of studying this American ermine (Mustela richardsonii) flaunting its natural agility, this photographer was finally able to capture the perfect photo of it ascending a crack in a cliff wall. The ermine was in pursuit of a woodrat on a higher ledge and quickly scrambled up the cliff, jumped in an attempted capture, only to back down into the snow below. Though it began again, it would finally give up.\n\nTERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE Finalist\n\nJan Pokluda | JinaÄovice, Czech Republic\n\nGreetings From the Spiked Magician\n\nMoravia, Czech Republic\n\nA cricket known by many names, including predatory bush cricket and the spiked magician, the Saga pedo earn their many monikers through the eager, yet delightful, way they wave their forelimbs when approaching prey. Thatâs not the only thing that makes them stand outâthese crickets frequently engage in cannibalism of their young and all individuals are female, meaning they reproduce asexually.\n\nTERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE Finalist\n\nJen Guyton | Charleston, South Carolina, United States\n\nThe Band\n\nLemek Conservancy, Masai Mara Ecosystem, Kenya, Africa\n\nAn exceptional shot of four spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) arriving to grab a drink of water at a local pond. The photographer notes that hyenas are widely misunderstood, and that these fierce, intelligent, and social animals deserve more of our respect. Living as members of matriarchal clans, theyâre not only tenacious hunters, but demonstrate remarkable teamwork while on the hunt.Â\n\nTERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE Finalist\n\nKathleen Borshanian | Salt Lake City, Utah, United States\n\nA Moment In The Sun\n\nAlaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, United States\n\nAt first glance, this image appears to capture the impossible: A fox pup sitting â¦ underwater? In reality, this fox is basking on a cliffside, likely enjoying a rare moment of sunshine or possibly preparing to hunt on the large bird colonies that nest on the nearby cliffs. This particular pup is a Pribilof Island arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus pribilofensis) and is endemic to the Pribilof Islands, where these beautiful creatures are federally protected.Â\n\nTerrestrial Wildlife\n\nView Finalists in this category\n\nBeauty Of Thar Desert\n\nThar Desert, Rajasthan, India\n\nAn Afro-Asian sand snake (Psammophis schokari) nestles within an endangered Phog shrub (Calligonum polygonoides) in the Thar Desert. Contradicting its name, this diurnal ambush predator was likely resting in the shrub for the night, perfectly camouflaged by the bush thanks to its thin, brown body.\n\nHema Palan\n\nMumbai, India\n\nHema Palan is a banker by profession in addition to being a passionate wildlife photographer. A visual storyteller, Hema aims to make a difference in conservation by documenting species in their wild habitat with the hope of inspiring people to play their part in conserving this beautiful world.\n\nterrestrial wildlife winner\n\nFor Survival\n\nDonglin Zhou | Hangzhou, China\n\nShiqu, Sichuan Province, China\n\nWinged life finalist\n\nBaiju Patil | Aurangabad, India\n\nWings of Fire\n\nDharur, Maharashtra, India\n\nThough it may seem alarming to see these Fork-tailed drongos (Dicrurus adsimilis) chasing an insect through flames, it is quite common for these birds to use fires as their hunting ground. As grass burns, insects fly from it, and this is when the drongos make their move. Though known for their opportunistic feeding strategies, surprisingly they have also been known to carry burning twigs and branches in order to set fires at other locations and flush out more prey!\n\nWinged life finalist\n\nHira Punjabi | Thane, India\n\nDo Not Disturb\n\nBharatpur, Rajasthan, India\n\nIn the biography of a given Rose-ringed parakeetâs (Psittacula krameri) life, it would likely not surprise you to see Aggression Towards Other Animals as a prominent chapter. They donât quite get along with others, as this Monitor lizard (Varanus sp.) can no doubt attestâthough he may deserve this aerial attack! Monitor lizards are known for their egg eating, and itâs possible this one was on its way to the parakeetâs nest to do just that, prompting the parakeet to go on the offensive.\n\nWinged life finalist\n\nArnfinn Johansen | Lillehammer, Norway\n\nAngel of the Arctic\n\nThe Monaco Glacier in Liefdefjorden, Svalbard, Norway\n\nAn Ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) floats past the wall of a glacier. Possibly the rarest, yet most photographic, bird in existence, these frigid-friendly birds are typically only found in the high arctic, though they have been spotted as far south as California to the delight of many birders. Given the remote nature of their lives, it is difficult to make precise determinations about their populations, but a decline in sea ice due to climate change is purported to be the culprit of their declining birth rates. It is estimated only 21,000 of these majestic birds remain, giving this image a more haunting beauty.Â\n\nWinged life finalist\n\nNeil Aldridge | Bristol, United Kingdom\n\nFlight of the Night Hunter\n\nDevon, United Kingdom\n\nItâs more common to see images of bats soaring above a canopy of trees, but this image demonstrates the unique hunting behaviors of the Lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Formerly a cave-dwelling species, they now take roost in old houses, churches, and barnsâprimarily hunting by flying low and rarely more than 16 feet off the ground. Taken as part of a photo story on bats in the United Kingdom, the photographer took great care to capture this image from the POV of the batâs prey, using dialed-down flashes fitted with red filters to minimize any disturbance and discomfort to the bat.\n\nWinged life finalist\n\nJaime Rojo | Madrid, Spain\n\nStreaming Monarchs\n\nMonarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico\n\nTaken on a particularly warm day at the end of Monarch butterfliesâ (Danaus plexippus) winter cycle, this image demonstrates a beautiful behavior called streaming, wherein the butterflies fly in the same directionâthus creating a stream-like effect. Move over, Netflix!\n\nWinged life finalist\n\nTakuya Ishiguro | Osaki, Miyagi, Japan\n\nHunt\n\nNikaho, Akita, Japan\n\nA digger wasp (family Sphex) proudly poses with its prey. Likely with a grasshopper in its grasp, this species is well-known for hunting and stocking up their various nests full of them. This photographer is renowned for creating his own lens to capture these creaturesâ points of view; he notes that there are small insects all around us all the time and by seeing things from their perspective, we can enter this entirely different world.\n\nWinged Life\n\nView Finalists in this category\n\nUnderwater Harmony And Chaos\n\nShetland Islands, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nDespite being nearly as large as an albatross, with a wingspan approaching seven feet in length, Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) are surprisingly agile divers. They owe it all to their amazing eyes, which are not only generally sharp, but have also structurally adapted for plunge-diving. This, combined with their robust vocalizations, allow them to be adept fish hunters. Spending most of their lives at sea, these birds can dive nearly 72 feet deep for food, racking their prey from the air and catching them by making a jabbing dive. The photographer likens watching these birds to torpedoes as they break the surface of the cold Scottish waters at a speed of close to 60 mph to seize their prey. And thanks to their incredible vision, theyâre able to do so without barreling into one another.\n\nFranco Banfi\n\nCadro, Switzerland\n\nFranco Banfi is a professional photographer specializing in underwater wildlife and environments who has worked in all manner of watery locales: from salted and freshwater, to polar water and temperate-warm water. He has dived and photographed in lakes, rivers, and every ocean on Earth, all while improving hisÂ photography skills and deepening his love for wildlife in the pursuit of conserving biodiversity, flora, and fauna. You can find his photography in hundreds of magazines, books, calendars related to underwater life, including publications in GEO, National Geographic, BBC Wildlife, Tauchen, DAN Alert, and Focus.Â\n\nWinged life winner\n\nPass By\n\nLin Xiaoping| Xiamen, China\n\nXiamen, China\n\nLANDSCAPES, WATERSCAPES, AND FLORA FINALIST\n\nJoshua Galicki | Claiborne, Maryland, United States\n\nAutumn Cypress\n\nTrap Pond State Park, Delaware, United States\n\nAutumn touches Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) as a Great blue heron (Ardea herodias) rests by the water. This pond is home to the northernmost, naturally-occurring stand of Bald Cypress trees, along with these beautiful birds who live and thrive there all year round. The photographer notes that herons often go unnoticed as visitors recreationally paddle through the scenery, but not this time. Snapped just after sunset from his kayak, he notes he quietly floated by this dreamy vision of peak Fall colors.Â\n\nLANDSCAPES, WATERSCAPES, AND FLORA FINALIST\n\nFrancisco Negroni | Puerto Montt, Chile\n\nThe King of the Volcanoes\n\nVillarrica National Park, PucÃ³n, Chile\n\nA tumultuous image becomes a photographer's dream finally realized when he successfully caught this image of Villarrica, one of Chileâs most active volcanoes, erupting as lightning struck it. Evidently, any erupting volcano has the capacity to create volcanic lightning as a result of the static electricity generated by the volcanoâs ash. Though thunderstorms traditionally require ice particles colliding in the clouds, volcanologists posit that ultra-hot volcanic plumes could contain the necessary water to help produce these incredible strikes.\n\nLANDSCAPES, WATERSCAPES, AND FLORA FINALIST\n\nFressia Junqi Peng | Napa, California, United States\n\nOcean Dance\n\nChannel Islands, California, United States\n\nAn intimate look into a Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forest off the coast of the Channel Islands. Here, kelp forests experience a mix of northern cold and southern warm water currents that help create one of the most dynamic, productive systems on Earth. A local diver, this photographer hopes that by capturing kelp in a fresh light, she can demonstrate the dance-like artistry of underwater algae in motion. Especially as overfishing and water warming threaten their fragile ecosystems, she hopes that these images will encourage the protection and restoration of giant kelp forests in California and around the world.\n\nLANDSCAPES, WATERSCAPES, AND FLORA FINALIST\n\nGeorgina Steytler | Goode Beach, Australia\n\nSpidery Orchids\n\nSouthern Coast, Western Australia\n\nSpindly petals accentuated by fog on a rainy day. This image demonstrates clearly how these so-called Spider orchids (family Caladenia) got their name. Part of the largest genus of orchids on the continent, they could be more plentiful than actual spidersâwhich is saying something for Australia!\n\nLANDSCAPES, WATERSCAPES, AND FLORA FINALIST\n\nMatjaz Krivic | Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nLavaâs Flow\n\nTacande, El Paso, Los Llanos on La Palma island, Spain\n\nThe 2021 eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on La Palma Island was the island's longest-running volcano eruption. Flowing for 85 consecutive days, huge rivers of lava and enormous amounts of continuously falling volcanic ash prompted the evacuation of 7,000 people and destroyed thousands of homes and buildings. Though this harrowing image displays its destruction, hope is symbolized by the lone tree left standing in its path.Â\n\nLANDSCAPES, WATERSCAPES, AND FLORA FINALIST\n\nThomas Vijayan | Ontario, Canada\n\nFoggy Day Afternoon\n\nNamibia, Africa\n\nThe Namib desert is thought of as the only true desert in southern Africa due to its limited annual rainfall, a paltry 2-200 milliliters a year. Given this, one would not think that fog is quite commonplaceâsurprisingly, fog is no stranger to the Namibian desert, occurring frequently thanks to the cold Benguela current sweeping north and meeting with warmer currents from more tropical areas. Here we get a rare glimpse of this fog fomenting what appears to be a tornado at the center of a dune, while a Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) stands on the crest.Â\n\nLandscapes, Waterscapes, and Flora\n\nView Finalists in this category\n\nIn Celebration\n\nCape Peninsula, South Africa\n\nAn image years in the making, this photographer always wanted to highlight the role tidal and wave actions play in the lives of Sandy anemones (Bunodactis reynaudi). Native to the South African coast, sandy anemones are often seen gathered together like this, relying on water supply from tidal and wave actions to bring in sustenance, using their strong contractile sphincter muscles to grab onto passing food. Only when there is a likelihood of feeding do anemones open and show off their beautiful, variegated colorsâelevating the reefs and tidal pools they reside in from mundane to exquisite. To this photographer, it is a celebration of the natural rhythms of life.\n\nGeo Cloete\n\nYzerfontein, South Africa\n\nGeo Cloete is a renowned photographer whose work is celebrated within South Africa's underwater photography community. A lifelong aquaman with an enduring love for the ocean, Geo strives to demonstrate the undersea world's beauty, splendor, and exquisiteness through his photographic endeavors. Geo is the recipient of numerous awards, including Wildlife Photographer of the Year and Underwater Photographer of the Year, and his photos have won awards in many prestigious competitions including United World Oceans Day, Natures Best Africa, and African Geographic.\n\nLandscapes, Waterscapes, and Flora winner\n\nRegeneration\n\nMiquel Angel ArtuÌs Illana | Tossa De Mar, Spain\n\nJasper National Park, Alberta, Canada\n\nART OF NATURE FINALIST\n\nMatjaz Krivic | Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nFlamingos Over The Lagoon\n\nBolivia, South America\n\nWhile working on a Lithium extraction story, the mining of which is actively disrupting the local habitat, this photographer stopped by a lake for lunch. Once he saw this scene, featuring hundreds of Andean flamingos (Phoenicoparrus andinus) traversing the wetland, he says he forgot his hunger, grabbed his gear, and set out to capture this flock as they flew by.\n\nART OF NATURE FINALIST\n\nDavid Maitland | St. Andrews, United KingdomÂ\n\nâKoiâ\n\nFeltwell, Norfolk, United Kingdom\n\nEchoing nature elsewhere, this image appears more like carp swimming in a koi pond rather than a close-up of wing scales. Incredibly, this is an image of the wings of a Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) photographed under UltraViolet Light (UV)âmaking only the red scales fluoresce, and stacked from 62 images to create one amazing photo.Â\n\nART OF NATURE FINALIST\n\nKat Zhou | San Francisco, California, United StatesÂ\n\nRelentless Gaze\n\nOffshore from Bimini, Bahamas\n\nHaving only a macro lens on hand while on a dive in the Bahamas, this photographer was forced to consider her subjects from a different perspective. Undeterred, she found this challenge allowed her to observe unusual details, most noticeably a nearby Nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and capture the mesmerizing patterns around its eye.Â\n\nART OF NATURE FINALIST\n\nXiaodong Sun | Shanghai, China\n\nCollective CamouflageÂ\n\nXishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Yunnan Province, China\n\nA group of tent moth caterpillars (family Lasiocampidae) gather close, camouflaging themselves as bark on a tree, trying to remain invisible to their predators. How many can you count?Â\n\nART OF NATURE FINALIST\n\nDaisy Gilardini | Vancouver, Canada\n\nShadows\n\nVolunteer Point, Falkland Islands\n\nAn aerial shot shows King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) from a fresh perspective, their shadows standing out against the snow. This photographer acknowledges that some may have adverse reactions to drone use; however, she believes that when used correctly, they can allow conservation photographers to produce images that would only have been previously possible by using expensive, environmentally unfriendly helicopters and planes. By using a drone both in accordance with government regulations and with respect for wildlife, she is able to produce unexpected images like this oneâwithout leaving a larger environmental footprint in her wake.Â\n\nART OF NATURE FINALIST\n\nAshley Sykes | Cordeaux Heights, NSW, Australia\n\nShimmering Shallows Swarm\n\nBermagui, NSW, Australia\n\nAustralian salmon (Arripis trutta) gleam as they twist and turn within a bait ball, creating little flashes. While searching for wildlife along the shallows of the coastline, this photographer found this large ball of salmon seeking refuge in the shallow waters off the Eastern coast. Interestingly, though they are called salmon and their species name includes trutta (trout), they are unrelated to both species, instead belonging to a separate genus of marine fish called Arripis which are from an order of perch-like fish!\n\nArt of Nature\n\nView Finalists in this category\n\nStardust Forest\n\nYamagata City, Japan\n\nEvery summer, hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors journey to Japan to witness the amazing lights of the Himebotaru. These Japanese fireflies (Luciola parvula) are endemic to Japan, though members of their family are found in Asia, Africa, and Europe. After studying the ecology of these fireflies for years, including tracking their pathways, this photographer set out to capture their incredible illumination through a series of long exposures in camera, resulting in this magical image.\n\nKazuaki Koseki\n\nForest in Yamagata prefecture, Tohoku region, Japan\n\nPhotography has been a formative part of Kazuaki Kosekiâs life since early childhood. In addition to continuing the family studio business, Koseki now conducts his private photographic work featuring Mountains. Forests. Rivers. Kazuaki forges his way into the wilderness of Yamagata and Tohoku, evoking the five senses through the four seasons, and has dedicated himself to capturing the natural majesty of the area in many of his works, including in his landmark series Summer Fairies. He has received numerous awards at home and abroad, including Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2021, Critical Mass 2023 Top 50, BigPicture Nature World Photography Competition 2021 & 2023, and Photoville FENCE 2020, and his work has been included in exhibits at the World Economic Forum (Davos, Switzerland) and the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nart of nature winner\n\nField Of Dreams\n\nJ Fritz Rumpf | Arizona, United States\n\nWhite Mountains, Arizona, United States\n\nHUMAN/NATURE FINALIST\n\nAlvaro Herrero | Tulum, Mexico\n\nHopeless\n\nBaja California, Mexico\n\nA difficult image to take in: a majestic Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) arduously swims along while entangled with ropes and buoys, rendering its tail completely useless. Due to the damage to its tail, it is undoubted that this whale is suffering greatly and will not survive its injury. The photographer sees this sad image as a metaphor for the pain and destruction we are causing the ocean and its inhabitants, and hopes viewers will reflect on humanity's role in this whaleâs fate.Â\n\nHUMAN/NATURE FINALIST\n\nMarcus Westberg | Fanadia, Portugal\n\nCaptive\n\nUndisclosed area, China\n\nConcepts like breeding rescue centers, while well-intentioned, are much more complicated in reality. Preferring to leave the exact location undisclosed, this photographer was invited by WWF to visit a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) rescue and breeding center in China, where he discovered many pandas spent most of their time in small cages. He stressed that this issue is one of space and not a lack of care for them, and thus he felt conflicted in publishing these images at all. He explained that the people working there wanted the very best for the animals, despite their less than stellar living conditions. Ultimately, he felt it was necessary to shine a light on these practices and pose the question of whether keeping wild animals in captivity is really in their best interest.\n\nHUMAN/NATURE FINALIST\n\nAlessandro Giannachini | Pietrasanta, Italy\n\nBrutal Death\n\nParco Nazionale Delle Alpi Apuane, Toscana, Italy\n\nWhile photographing trout in the Serra Torrent, this photographer came across a tragic scene. A Hooded crow (Corvus cornix), tangled in abandoned netting, struggling to break free. The photographer hopes that through the publication of this heartbreaking image, viewers will be more cognizant of how pollution impacts the environment and will be challenged to take more care in their relationship with nature.Â\n\nHUMAN/NATURE FINALIST\n\nEmmett Sparling | Vancouver, Canada\n\nNaserian and the Ostrich Egg\n\nMaasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, AfricaÂ\n\nA rare find: Naserian, pictured, confidently cradles an scarcely-seen abandoned ostrich egg in her hands during the blue hour. A Maasai warrior and prominent guide, the photographer notes that Naserian is paving the way for women in the Maasai community to stand up to traditional masculine beliefs and create new paths. To him, this image of Naserian with the egg represents hope and fuel for future generations of Maasai women who will look up to her and follow in her footsteps.Â\n\nHUMAN/NATURE FINALIST\n\nMarcus Westberg | Fanadia, Portugal\n\nAirborne\n\nLiwonde National Park, Malawi, Africa\n\nTo ensure genetic diversity and minimize human-wildlife conflict, it is often necessary to move wild animals between different protected areas in Africa. One might not expect that this method of moving an African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) would be effective; however the photographer notes that this method of transportation is a multi-rarity between its extremely complex coordination and the ability to document it up close.\n\nHUMAN/NATURE FINALIST\n\nBritta Jaschinski | London, United Kingdom\n\nSerious Crime, Forensic Expert\n\nHeathrow Airport, London, United KingdomÂ\n\nA Metropolitan Police Serious Crime Forensic Expert works to lift fingerprints from the tusk of an African elephant (genus Loxodonta) at Heathrow Airport. These investigators are confiscating smuggled wildlife species and products in increasingly high numbersâwith thousands of seizures made in October 2023 alone. WWF estimates on average 40 African Elephants are killed for their ivory every day, making this fingerprinting work integral to law enforcement efforts to track down smugglers running the illegal ivory trade. Though difficult to gain access, this photographer has built a relationship with the CITES Border Force Team, who invite her in to document investigations and subsequent forensic testing, including this newly developed technique using white magnetic powder to reveal older fingerprints.\n\nHuman/Nature\n\nView Finalists in this category\n\nGood Fire\n\nYurok Ancestral Lands, Humboldt County, California\n\nWeâre trained to see the words wildfire and California and immediately think, devastation. In many cases in California, that is true, but fire itself is a force of renewal, a force North American landscapes were shaped withâ a force for good. Until the 20th century, lightning strikes ensured consistent natural burning, and Indigenous communities stewarded the land with intentional fire. Due to federal fire restrictions, Indigenous communities like those on the Klamath River (including the Yurok, Karuk, and Hoopa Tribes) have seen a stifling of their ability to wield fire as their ancestors didâpriming forests for the severe and destructive wildfire we see today. Ever slowly, they are reclaiming their right to burn, shown here as Hoopa Valley Tribal member, Steven Saiz, facilitates a cultural burn with the Cultural Fire Management Council. These burns not only promote cultural revival, but ecological as well, as these burns invigorate the health of forests, from vegetation to animals.Â\n\nMaddy Rifka\n\nArcata, California, United StatesÂ\n\nMaddy Rifka is a fish and wildlife biologist, wildland firefighter, and conservation storyteller.
