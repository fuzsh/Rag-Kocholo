        "text": "Perhaps because I studied in an environment that celebrated formal novelty I perceive Canadian theatre to be stuck in an increasingly narrow commercial rut. Which is, perhaps, why I've pontificated (quieter but incessant) versions of my own \"resistance to digital technology cannot be passive\" statements. Because we are forced to think in terms of the market we have not been thinking richly enough in terms of the art form and all the incredible directions we could be taking it. Therefore, so much digital integration into Canadian theatre has been under-considered and clunky. David Maggs is beginning a tremendous argument here for converting analogue zealots like me. Perhaps our recent failures have not been a fault of the emerging medium so much as a misplacement of underserved creativity. With the level of care and specificity that David demands, the broader thinking that I crave from Canadian theatre can be approached (even if it has to be through tech, I guess!). \"Most of the time, we think about the relationship between art and technology from the perspective of art’s need for tech, perhaps the opposite is the greater urgency.\" This isn't a rhetorical argument to woo granting juries, it's an active and practical way to approach. But our incessant scarcity mindset has us searching for a platform to live on rather than an arena to humanize. I don't know how to dig Canadian theatre out of that scarcity problem - especially not now. But if we can't respond to it with novelty, an open mind, and more creative curatorial planning then, despite its genuine promise and potential, tech won't be helping us much anyway.\n\nAs a Content Director in tech, I'm always looking at how political shifts might impact our industry. The recent discussions around Project 2025 offer crucial insights: • Project 2025 is a blueprint for significant changes in federal government operations • It proposes replacing many career civil servants with political appointees • This could lead to a politicization of government functions This raises questions. 1. How might political appointments affect the collection and interpretation of government data, that many tech companies rely on? 2. Potential shifts in antitrust, privacy, and other tech-related regulations could alter our operating environment. 3. Changes in procurement processes could impact tech companies working with or selling to the government. 4. A shake-up in government employment could affect the public-private talent pipeline many tech companies benefit from. 5. How might increased politicization influence the development and implementation of AI in government systems? What are your thoughts on how these potential shifts might influence the tech landscape?
