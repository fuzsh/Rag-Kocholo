        "text": "Did you know that Malta is tenth smallest and fifth most densely populated country in the world? This former British colony has become a very popular tourist destination with its recreational areas, historical places and warm climate. However, I wasn’t a tourist in Malta. I spent there last summer working at the hotel reception in Sliema, probably the busiest area on the island. Here is my story.\n\nAt the end of June 2018, I went to Malta because I needed a new challenge and wanted to embrace a totally different culture on this beautiful little island. I got a summer job in a hotel located in the heart of Sliema. During my stay in Malta I’ve experienced many things — good and bad ones and I want to share with you my experience and observations. So how it is to live and work in Malta?\n\nI have to admit that living in Malta is rather nice and relaxing. Even if the island is really busy itself the people there don’t seem to be in a rush! Most parts of the island are full of tourists and because there are more cars than people the traffic jams occur everywhere. There is a siesta in the afternoons so almost everywhere (except city centre) shops and restaurants are closed and you have to wait until late afternoon to buy food from the local store.\n\nWho visits Malta? Due to the close proximity of Italy the answer is easy! However, I wasn’t expecting to meet as many Italians as I did. Working at the hotel reception I can confirm that around 85% of guests were from Italy. Occasionally I welcomed guests from England, China, Japan, Spain, Russia and Poland, however the Italians dominate the tourist business! I encountered a very serious problem at my work place. Italians expect everyone in Malta to speak their language. To tell you the truth, they have the right to assume it as all Maltese that I met knew Italian! So I was the only one at the hotel reception not speaking Italian and although I know three other foreign languages many times the Italians showed me their disapproval and disbelief that I’m working in Malta without knowing Italian. This forced me to learn basic phrases in Italian, especially numbers to ask about the room number as without it I wouldn’t have survived in that environment.\n\nEnglish is the official language of the island alongside Maltese. In fact, everyone there speaks English, however, Maltese people speak in Maltese to one another (a mix of Arabic and Italian) so when you enter the shop or you are in a restaurant the staff communicates between each other in Maltese. The Maltese alphabet is really challenging and it’s a real blessing that all the signs and announcements in the city are written in English. Everyone in Malta speaks very good English (even the elderly) and the locals are really welcoming and always pleased to help.\n\nMaltese people constantly celebrate. There are festivals every week and the beautiful decorations are moved from place to place around the whole island. Most prominently, locals celebrate saints’ days followed by band processions, overnight parties and…fireworks. For me the latter became the symbol of the island as the firework displays were organized all the time. It was very hard to track what the occasion was at first, but then it became so common that I stopped paying attention to it. Buzzing festivals are the big attraction together with the full array of clubs with many dance floors and every kind of music. Paceville is the place to be if you’re looking to let go and have some fun, with some of the most popular bars and clubs creating an vibrant environment all night long. I had there the best cocktail I’ve ever tried in my life — frozen strawberry margarita. I will remember this taste for a long time.\n\nThe main disadvantage of working in Malta was the unpredictable public transport which leaves much to be desired. There are no trains or trams in Malta, so many people are totally dependent on the bus service, particularly the poor and elderly which was very apparent. Buses never come on time and they’re always full of people (even at 6 am when I was heading to work). Not just full, they are extremely overcrowded. And the bus drivers found a remedy for that! They tell people waiting at the bus stop that they can’t come on to the bus (many times pointing at someone saying “you are the last one”) or they just don’t stop at the bust stop at all! You wave at the bus to stop and it doesn’t stop! I guess it was the most frustrating thing during my stay in Malta and I can’t imagine how people can bear it on a daily basis. Especially when you are in a rush and you have to be at work on time and a few busses just pass by. There is another issue that it’s impossible concerning buses — the air-conditioning there. It is so strong that when you enter the bus you feel uneasy due experiencing two temperature extremes. So being outside in almost fourty degrees and getting on a freezing cold bus is totally unhealthy and I learnt that the hard way.\n\nI got very ill in the middle of July and it continued till the end of my stay (September). The symptoms were similar to that of a cold but only worse– I had a terrible sore throat, runny nose, I couldn’t speak and I had difficulties with breathing. It was very comforting to go to the doctor in Malta as you can be sure that all the doctors speak English. However, I got an antibiotic that didn’t help me. So, after the treatment I went to the pharmacy to seek help. And I was shocked because the pharmacies in Malta don’t look like any other ones I’ve seen in European countries. I expected to see lots of medicines there, instead I saw a variety of cosmetics. Medicines were located just on one shelf behind the pharmacist.\n\nAfter some time, I felt so unwell that I went to the emergency department at the local clinic near the place I was living in Mosta. The clinic was tidy and the doctor was extremely nice, however she didn’t know what was going on with me either so she decided to give me another antibiotic. To your surprise, it didn’t work either! And probably because of the unbearably strong air-conditioning in the clinic and the fact that I was waiting half of the day for my turn, my physical well-being got worse. Till the end of my stay in Malta my health wasn’t great and I was fully healed a month later in Russia, but it’s another story!\n\nLet’s leave behind the negatives of my stay in Malta and talk about the bright sides and why I would recommend this place to everyone. The smallest capital in the world Valetta is extremely charming during day and night. Sightseeing can take you half an hour! It is very small but there is something in its beauty that really captivates you. Something makes you want to go back there, sit in a nice café or just walk around the sweet narrow streets. The Upper and Lower Barakka Gardens are wonderful spots to chill, take photos and enjoy beautiful views. The coastline in Sliema is full of cosy places and benches where you can sit down and feel the magical atmosphere of the city. Also, if you are from the UK or you love British shops, you can feel at home shopping in Matalan, Marks & Spencer’s or Debenhams.\n\nMalta is the main island of the Maltese archipelago which consists of three islands: Malta, Gozo and Comino. I visited the other islands and although they seem to look almost the same, there are substantial differences. Malta is a big cultural, commercial and administrative centre while Gozo is more rural and characterized by fishing and agriculture. According to the local legend Gozo was the Calypso’s isle of Homer’s Odyssey. Comino is the smallest in the archipelago and what’s interesting it is largely uninhabited and there is just one hotel on the whole island! However, the Blue Lagoon in Comino is a must to see. The sea has a bright blue colour illuminated by warm sun rays. At the top of the cliffs you can see Gozo, the entire coast, and boats and yachts coming to the island. Another truly special place in Malta is St. Paul’s Bay and Popeye Village. At both of them I had a great time and I could relax enjoying amazing panoramas in sight. I also have to mention that the Maltese isles are best dive sites in the Mediterranean and a kingdom for passionate swimmers.\n\nThe best and cheapest food in Malta you can get from little pizza shops for 1 € per slice. Three slices can fill you up and the taste is incredible. Also, the local Cisk beer was a nice refreshment on hot days. Maltese cuisine is mostly Italian and lovers of this type of food will be for sure satisfied. I don’t eat seafood, but I’ve heard many times in Malta that their seafood is of great quality and highly recommended.\n\nWhat I liked the most in Malta was that despite the crowded streets and beaches you could always find an oasis for your thoughts and dreams. Even in Sliema or Valetta there were places with just silence and serenity. Mdina is a must see with views of the island that can’t be experienced anywhere else and the medieval fort has tremendous character and beauty. San Anton Gardens is a hidden gem and an escape from the hustle and bustle, a place to relax or contemplate. I enjoyed a lot the hot weather, going to the beach after work, watching beautiful sunsets, relaxing in local cafés and taking part in local events and celebrations.\n\nAnd what’s the most important I found there the love of my life so this experience will be surely unforgettable and there will be always a special place in my heart for this little, busy and charming island.\n\nBy Sandra from Gettranslated Team"
