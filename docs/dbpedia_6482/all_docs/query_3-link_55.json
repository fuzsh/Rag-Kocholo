Throughout history, the islands were occupied by many different empires. Temples, fortresses, and other historic sites still stand today.\n\nThanks to these historic and cultural attractions, plus the sun and sea, Malta is a popular tourist destination.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nCapital: Valletta\n\nPopulation: 437,000\n\nKey Cities: Sliema, Valletta, Rabat, St. Paul’s Bay, Mosta\n\nOfficial Language: Maltese, English\n\nMajor Religions: Roman Catholic\n\nGeography\n\nBordering Countries: None\n\nSize: 122 sq. miles\n\nLowest point: Mediterranean Sea at sea level\n\nHighest point: Ta’Dmejrek at 830 ft.\n\nMalta is an archipelago, or chain of islands, in the Mediterranean Sea. It’s just south of the island of Sicily, Italy.\n\nOnly Malta’s three largest islands are occupied by people: Malta, Gozo, and Comino. All three are low, rocky islands with steep cliffs along the coast.\n\nMalta has no permanent natural lakes or rivers, but small rivers temporarily form during periods of heavy rainfall.\n\nThe Maltese islands have a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry, and very sunny summers. Spring and fall are usually cooler, and winters are mild. Annual rainfall is low and mostly occurs in the winter.\n\nMalta is almost treeless, with very little vegetation and plants. Common animals include weasels, hedgehogs, bats, white rabbits, and mice.\n\nThere are also many types of tortoises and turtles, butterflies, and lizards. The surrounding waters are home to species of Mediterranean fish, as well as porpoises and seals.\n\nHistory\n\nPeople first lived in Malta around 5900 BC. Around 3850 BC, the islands were populated by a civilization that built the Megalithic Temples. These temples still stand today as some of the oldest buildings in the world.\n\nAfter that, the islands were ruled by Bronze Age warriors, the Phoenicians, the Romans, the Byzantines, and the Aghlabids.\n\nThe islands are also famous as the place where the biblical St. Paul shipwrecked in 60 A.D., bringing Christianity to Malta.\n\nAfter the islands were sparsely populated (very few people) for several years, the Arabs conquered the islands in 870 A.D. In 1090, the Normans took control.\n\nIn 1530, Charles V gave Malta to the Sovereign Military Order of St. John of Jerusalem. They became known as the Knights of Malta and built towns, forts, and churches.\n\nFamous European artists were hired by the Knights to decorate the churches and palaces of Malta. It became a golden age of culture on the islands.\n\nIn 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte and the French took control of Malta. The Maltese requested help from the British, and the French armies were expelled in 1800.\n\nMalta then became part of the British Empire in 1814. It was an important military and naval base during World War I and World War II.\n\nIn 1964, Malta became an independent nation, joining the European Union in 2004. Malta’s government is a parliamentary republic with a president, prime minister, Cabinet, and Parliamentary Secretaries.\n\nEconomy\n\nMalta’s major industries are tourism, electronics, pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding and repair, construction, and textiles.\n\nMain agricultural products include potatoes, grapes, cauliflower, wheat, barley, tomatoes, citrus, green peppers, pork, milk, poultry, and eggs.\n\nMalta’s economy ranks 15th in Europe and among the top 35 in the world. However, the country does have high tax rates and high levels of government spending and corruption. It’s also very dependent on other European nations.\n\nUnemployment is among the lowest in the European Union, at around 4%. Malta’s currency is the Euro.\n\nCulture\n\nMaltese and English are the official languages in Malta, but French and Italian are also spoken. Because Malta is so close to Italy, about 66% of the population can speak Italian.\n\nMalta is one of the most Catholic countries in the world. About 98% of the population identifies as Roman Catholic.\n\nMeals in Malta sometimes begin with a small bowl of soup called minestra. Stuffed poultry and baked pasta dishes are popular, along with vegetables and fruits.\n\nA popular seasonal dish is Lampuki pie, a pastry-covered fish casserole with spinach, cauliflower, chestnuts, and sultanas.\n\nStuffed octopus, squid, and cuttlefish are often served with tomato sauce. Rabbit stewed in wine is a special dish, and families traditionally eat lamb at Easter.\n\nOne of the country’s most popular celebrations and traditions is Carnival, which takes place before Lent. Children and adults dress in fancy costumes and join parades with many colorful Carnival floats.\n\nMalta also participates in many religious activities and festivals. At the Feast of St. Grigor, a religious procession ends with a picnic in a small fishing village.\n\nI-Imnarja celebrates the feasts of St. Peter and St. Paul. It’s a country harvest and folk festival with picnics, an agricultural show, and horse and donkey races.\n\nThe celebrations and festivals in Malta often end with fireworks. In the spring, the Malta Fireworks Festival is held in Valletta’s Grand Harbor.\n\nFamous Maltese\n\nJon Cassar- producer\n\nEmma Heming- actress\n\nAndrei Claude- actor\n\nFun Facts\n\nMalta’s smallest occupied island, Comino, has very few people and buildings. There’s only one hotel and no cars. However, it’s home to the beautiful and popular Blue Lagoon.\n\nThere are several sunken World War II ships along the coastline of Malta.\n\nSan Blas Bay, located on the northeast coast of Gozo, is a red sand beach.\n\nMalta is home to 365 churches.\n\nValletta, the capital of Malta, is known as Europe’s first planned city."
