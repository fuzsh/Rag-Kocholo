Malta is one of the few countries in the world where drivers drive on the left side of the road. This type of driving was inherited from the British colonialists.\n\n2. Malta is a popular filming location for high-budget films. Scenes from productions such as Gladiator, World War Z, Captain Phillips and Game of Thrones have been filmed on this small island.\n\n3. Malta has several political parties, but only two of them share all the seats in parliament. General elections and public referendums usually win by a small margin. The two main parties are the Labor Party and the Nationalist Party.\n\n5. The name Malta comes from the Greek word \"Melite\". The ancient Greeks named the island Melit (sweet honey), possibly because of the unique honey that was produced here.\n\n6. Malta is the only country in the EU where spring (limited) hunting of certain species of birds is still allowed. Hunting is a traditional hobby in Malta.\n\n7. Malta has 10 UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Megalithic Temples, Valletta, Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, Grand Harbor, Victoria Lines Fortifications, Maltese Catacomb Complexes, Mdina Town, Cittadella Walled City, Northwest Coastal Cliffs and Dweira Bay. These objects are protected by international law. So these sites should be at the top of your list of places to visit!\n\n8. Glass blowing and Maltese lace are among the few local crafts that have been practiced for centuries. There are several workshops in Ta-Kali village where you can see local artisans at work and buy their products at very reasonable prices.\n\n9. Malta has fourteen public holidays annually. This is one of the highest rates among the EU countries.\n\n10. The Maltese love religious holidays. Between June and September, Malta hosts 75 festivals. These include fireworks, religious processions and group marches.\n\nHistorical facts\n\n1. Over the past 2000+ years, Malta has had 11 foreign rulers, leaving various traces that can still be found on the Maltese islands. Malta is currently an independent republic that gained independence from the British Empire in 1964. The country is still part of the British Commonwealth.\n\n2. Malta was once part of mainland Europe. About 17,000 years ago, the islands of Malta were connected by land with Sicily and even with mainland Italy.\n\n3. The megalithic temples of Malta are older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids.\n\n4. The vast majority of Maltese are Christians. According to the Bible, St. Paul was shipwrecked on a Maltese island and converted to Christianity in 60 AD.\n\n5. The dome of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Mosta) was miraculously saved during the Second World War. It is one of the largest churches in Malta, famous for its domed roof. On April 9, 1942, a bomb weighing about 500 kg was dropped on the church by the Nazis. At that time, there were about 300 people inside the cathedral. Although the bomb pierced the ceiling, it did not detonate when it hit the floor. A replica of the bomb can be seen at the back of the church.\n\nThe vast majority of almost four hundred thousand of its inhabitants (except for 4 people of the island of Comino), live on the two largest islands, Malta and Gozo. They speak here in their own peculiar language, close to Arabic, but everything is explained in English.\n\nEven during the last ice age, the islands of Malta were connected to the Italian island of Sicily. So the population appeared here a very long time ago, more than 10 thousand years ago. Malta is rich in prehistoric monuments such as Hal Saflieni, for example. This is a sanctuary on the island of Malta, built over 6 thousand years ago, which consists of over 30 halls carved into limestone. For a long time, the sanctuary was closed to the public due to research and restoration work, now visitors are allowed, but no more than 80 people a day.\n\nThe islands have preserved many megalithic temples built in time immemorial. These are, for example, Tal-Kadi, Borj in Nadur and others. They are a popular tourist attraction in the country. And on the island of Gozo there is a temple, which is considered the oldest surviving building on the planet. This is the Jgantiya temple complex.\n\nMalta changed owners many times, Phoenicians, Venetians, Arabs, and British also settled here. And each nation brought something of its own to Malta. Most of the cultural sites are located in the capital, a town called Valletta. Here you should visit, for example, the Museum of Archeology, which houses an exposition telling about the past of these places. By the way, it is located in a beautiful old building from the 16th century. Another ancient building is St. Paul's Cathedral, the main one on the archipelago. A popular route around the sights of Fort St. Elmo, an ancient fortification that previously defended the harbor.\n\nMuch less people live in another town in Malta, Sliema, than in Valletta, but in terms of its attractions it is not inferior to the capital. Here you should visit the Ting Fortress, built at the end of the 18th century. Palazzo Capua, a beautiful palace built at the beginning of the 19th century. And in the vicinity of the city, on the coastal rocks, watchtowers, buildings of the first half of the 17th century, have been preserved. Sliema is Malta's true tourist paradise. There are many hotels, recreation areas, places for entertainment and shopping.\n\nEnglish courses for adults 16+ in Malta"
