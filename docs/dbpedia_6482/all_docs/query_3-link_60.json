        "text": "Geography\n\nMalta consists of three inhabited islands:\n\nMain island Malta, population: 480,275 [1]\n\nGozo, population: 39,285 [1]\n\nComino, population: 2\n\nWhere is Malta located?\n\nMalta is located South of Sicily (Italy), in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, between mainland Europe and North Africa on the world map. More on that topic here: Where is Malta?\n\nLandscape\n\nThe landscape in Malta is dominated by limestone soil and a moderate relief with several low hills. The most built-up areas of the country lie towards the southeast of the main island of Malta, concentrated around the immediate vicinity of the capital city, Valletta. Several localities have grown to border each other, with few open spaces in this part of the country.\n\nThe more rural western part of Malta, as well as Gozo and Comino, are more varied in terms of nature, with a few small woodland areas.\n\nThere are few natural freshwater resources in Malta, which increasingly rely on the desalination of seawater through reverse osmosis plants installed in key locations.\n\nWeather and climate\n\nMalta has a generally Mediterranean climate, which is characterised by hot summers with little rain and mild winters with relatively infrequent rainfall and wind. Traditional seasons are a little different than other EU countries, having short spring and autumn seasons with weather conditions changing less gradually than in countries further away from the equator.\n\nThe hottest months of the year are July and August, during the summer season, with average daytime temperatures reaching 32 °C, with occasional heat waves reaching into the low 40-42 °C range. The coldest months of the year are January and February (with daytime temperatures hitting 16 °C on average and lows dipping under 10 °C), while November and December typically being the wettest months.\n\nAlthough it never snows, the country is familiar with relatively extreme weather conditions, with rainy winters, thunderstorms and hailstorms occurring from time to time, sometimes causing floods in lower-lying areas such as valleys.\n\nWhile climate change is felt in Malta less in high temperatures and intensely hot summer seasons, rainy winters are becoming rarer. Daytime average temperatures during the winter months are slowly rising, and drought is a real threat to water tables around the Maltese islands, particularly with its traditionally dry summers. While Gozo and Comino are far less densely populated, the main island of Malta suffers the brunt of climate challenges.\n\nHistory\n\nWhat makes Malta unique is the concentration of historical sites within the mere 316 km² of land covered, all traces of Malta’s rich history.\n\nThroughout Malta’s history, this small archipelago has seen its fair share of fighting and foreign rule.\n\nBeing located in the heart of the Mediterranean, it was considered to be of great strategic importance as a naval base as recently as World War 2. You will find traces everywhere of the various cultures that ruled the island over the past two millennia or so.\n\nNo other country in the world offers a taste of so many different historical and cultural influences in such a small area. It’s a side of Malta that few people know of and is well worth exploring.\n\nOver the centuries, the islands have been ruled by various European influences, with the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Crusaders, the French and finally, the British leaving traces of their presence and influence in Malta and its population.\n\nA little-known fact is that the Megalithic prehistoric temples found spread across the islands are some of the oldest free-standing structures in the world and are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nEconomy\n\nMalta is one of the latest additions to the EU (member since May 2004) and has developed in several areas, improving the quality of life for its citizens as well as offering tourists a better holiday experience. The island’s economy is highly dependent on tourism, but the island’s accession to the EU has generated opportunities to grow sectors like Financial Services as well as online gambling.\n\nIn recent years, the Maltese government invested heavily (also in Malta’s internet connectivity) to attract and grow business investments. with attractive corporate tax rates while creating a lucrative environment for mostly Scandinavian online gaming companies to set up shop in Malta. Although the online gaming industry also attracts employee talent from abroad, it has seen a surge in local employment, also aiding Malta in achieving one of the lowest unemployment rates in the EU in 2023 [9].\n\nOn 1st January 2008, Malta adopted the Euro, which replaced the Maltese Lira as the country’s currency. Although the global recession that year, combined with the high price of import of fossil fuels (on which Malta is heavily dependent due to lack of explored natural resources), impacted the local economy, the country’s deficit has remained well within the EU’s deficit limits.\n\nThe key pillars of Malta’s economy are:\n\nForeign trade\n\nTourism\n\nManufacturing (primarily electronics and pharmaceuticals)\n\nFlag of Malta\n\nThe flag of Malta is a standard bicolour flag with the colours white (at the hoist) and red (on the fly), which are of historical significance to Malta, having also been used by the Knights of Malta and their flags displaying the Maltese cross. A representation of the George Cross, which features on the white part of the flag.\n\nWhat does the cross on the Maltese flag stand for?\n\nThe cross on the Maltese flag is actually the George Cross, which was awarded to Malta by King George IV of the United Kingdom during World War 2. Being part of the British Empire, Malta was a key location in the Mediterranean of strategic importance to Allied forces and was under siege for four years, being heavily bombed by the Italian Air Force and German Luftwaffe. Despite nearing starvation due to supply lines being cut off, the Maltese fought and bravely withstood these dark times and, in recognition of their bravery, were awarded the George Cross.\n\nMaltese people and culture\n\nThe vast majority of people in Malta are warm and welcoming and, in typical Mediterranean fashion, wear their hearts on their sleeves. Passionate and rarely shying away from a good argument, they’re honest people, usually raised with strong Christian values and beliefs.\n\nMaltese culture is a bit of a melting pot of cultures introduced by foreign empires. However, there exists a broad foundation of age-old traditions, customs and values passed on through successive generations of Maltese and Gozitans, irrespective of any traces of culture left by foreign rule. More on Maltese culture here.\n\nMaltese cuisine\n\nMaltese cuisine reflects perfectly the country’s melting pot of cultures. Choose the best Italian and Sicilian flavours, combine them with some of the much-loved English specialities and add a hint of Spanish, Maghrebin, and Provençal cuisine. You will get a definitely Mediterranean, yet distinctive, cuisine.\n\nMaltese street food is a favourite, with pastizzi (fluffy pastries filled with ricotta cheese or peas), qassatat (another type of savoury pastries), sausage rolls and arancini (rice balls). Ħobż biż-żejt, a sandwich made of sliced Maltese bread with olive oil, and tomato paste and including ingredients like capers and tuna, is very popular among Maltese as a quick lunch.\n\nSome of the traditional Maltese food include rabbit stew (Stuffat Tal-Fenek) and fish (mainly lampuka, swordfish, seabream and seabass), as those are among the most commonly found animal species around the Maltese islands.\n\nTempted? Find out more on Maltese food here.\n\nMaltese traditions\n\nDue to its history and geographical location, Malta has similar traditions to those of Sicily and other Southern European neighbours.\n\nOne of the most emblematic traditions of Malta is the festa, a village religious feast. The festi (plural) celebrate the patron saint of the village or church (as some localities have more than one church). The celebrations are vibrant and include richly decorated streets, local bands marches, fireworks, religious processions, community gatherings, Maltese sweets and fast food stands.\n\nLearn more about Maltese festa.\n\nAs in the other Mediterranean nations, the family is very important in Malta. Hence wedding is still a key stage in the life of the Maltese and is often lavishly celebrated.\n\nTypically, ceremonies take place within a church, followed by celebrations held afterwards, often hosted in wedding halls or amid one of Malta’s numerous gardens.\n\nReligion plays an important part in Maltese traditions from the early stage of life. Most babies are baptised into the Roman Catholic faith, followed by the First Holy Communion and the Confirmation when the child grows up. Each of these religious sacraments is followed by a gathering with family and friends.\n\nA lesser-known Maltese tradition is il-quċċija, which happens on the child’s first birthday. The child is surrounded by several objects, and it is believed that the first object picked by the child is representative of his or her future career.\n\nEvents\n\nThe year is punctuated by many events in Malta. Apart from the village festas, the most important events include the Carnival, Holy Week and Easter, the International Fireworks Festival, the Malta Jazz Festival, Isle of MTV Malta and Music Week, Notte Bianca, Birgufest and Christmas.\n\nWhether you are interested in music, traditions, history, art… there is something for everyone in Malta!\n\nSee all events by month here.\n\nLanguage\n\nBoth Maltese and English are the country’s official languages, with the first being the national language (spoken by 97% of the population) and the second spoken widely by around 88% of the population. Italian is also spoken by a large part of the population (around 66%), having been an official language in the past (until 1934). With free access to Italian TV stations during the second half of the 20th century, the language was picked up by children and is still one of the most popular languages taught in schools.\n\nDemographics\n\nMalta is the most densely populated State of the EU, with 1,648.6 inhabitants per km2 [1]. In 2021, Malta had a total population of 519,562 [1]. A number of Maltese have been emigrating throughout history mainly to Australia as well as other English-speaking countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhereas Maltese natives make up the majority of the population, the number of foreign residents has increased significantly in the past few years. According to the 2021 census [1], more than one in five residents in Malta are foreign. The nationalities that make up the largest share of non-Maltese citizens are Italians, British, Indians and Filipinos.\n\nReligion\n\nAlthough popular belief is that Malta is a Muslim nation, it’s actually quite the opposite: 83% of the population is Roman Catholic [11]. Despite being a Catholic country with religious traditions and religion still very much part of daily life, Sunday mass attendance sits at around 40% (2015) and has been steadily declining.\n\nPolitics\n\nMalta is a democratic country, represented by its people through general elections that are held regularly every five years at most.\n\nMalta is a single-chamber parliamentary republic with a head of government (a prime minister) and a head of state (president), which is more of a ceremonial function.\n\nThe political system Malta has adopted ever since its independence centres around two major parties, the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. Although a few smaller parties exist (such as AD+PD and Volt Malta), none ever gained enough votes to obtain a parliamentary seat.\n\nGovernments are always formed by one of the two major parties, whichever of the two wins the majority of the 79 available seats in parliament.\n\nWhile the national government agenda is dictated by one party, the other is rarely able to obtain majority votes to oppose major legislation changes.\n\nWhile the Labour Party traditionally represents a more Socialist, progressive policy, the Nationalist Party is the more conservative of the two. Under Labour governments, major legislation like Social Security and LGBTQ+ rights were introduced, for example. Having said that, one of the most impactful changes in Malta early this century, accession to the EU, was set in motion by the Nationalist Party.\n\nThe current party in power (2023) is the Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Robert Abela.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe architecture in Malta is beautiful and fascinating. The first buildings in Malta date back to 3800–2500 BC, when Neolithic settlers built several temples around Malta and Gozo.\n\nLater on, each people who ruled Malta left a legacy in terms of architecture. For example, the Romans built villas and other buildings featuring mosaic floors, marble colonnades and statues, remnants of which can still be seen at the Domus Romana in Rabat. The early Christians left frescoes decorating the catacombs.\n\nFrom 1530 to 1798, Maltese architecture thrived under the governance of the Order of St. John. The Hospitallers built new cities and fortified towns, including Valletta – the new capital of Malta, as well as many churches, palaces and public buildings. They adopted a rich Baroque style that Malta still proudly boasts today.\n\nDuring the British rule (1800-1964), Neoclassical and Neo-Gothic architecture were introduced to Malta.\n\nTraditional Malta townhouses are built in local limestone and feature colourful and ornate doors and closed wooden balconies called Gallarija (plural Gallariji).\n\nArts in Malta\n\nMalta is rich in arts, such as painting, sculpture, music and literature.\n\nPainting\n\nIn the late 15th century, Maltese artists, influenced by the School of Antonello da Messina, were introduced to Renaissance concepts, marking a shift in decorative arts.\n\nThe painting heritage of Malta developed further when the Knights of St. John invited Italian and Flemish Mannerist painters to decorate their palaces and churches. Figures like Matteo Pérez de Alesio and Filippo Paladini left their mark in the Grandmaster’s Palace and the St. John’s Co-Cathedral.\n\nCaravaggio’s arrival revolutionized local art. The Italian painter left two notable paintings that visitors can still admire while visiting St. John’s Co-Cathedral: The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist and Saint Jerome Writing.\n\nThe subsequent Baroque movement left a lasting legacy in Malta. Mattia Preti’s ceiling paintings transformed the Church of St. John into the Baroque masterpiece we know today.\n\nThe 17th and 18th centuries were characterised by Neapolitan and Rococo influences. The French painter Antoine de Favray further enriched the Rococo movement when he became the court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.\n\nThen, Maltese painting was marked by Neo-classicism in the late 18th century, followed by the Nazarene movement and its religious themes in the early 19th century. Romanticism shaped the art of early 20th-century “salon” artists before post-World War II saw the emergence of the “Modern Art Group”.\n\nToday, the National Museum of Art, MUŻA, at Auberge d’Italie, displays the national collection of fine arts.\n\nSculpture\n\nThe first sculptures in Malta date back to the end of the Neolithic period. Archaeologists found several sculptures such as one depicting the goddess of fertility and another one named the sleeping lady. The megalithic temples themselves were decorated with spirals and frescoes in stone.\n\nLater on, Melchiorre Gafà was an important Maltese Baroque sculptor who worked on the altar of the St. John’s Co-Cathedral in Valletta.\n\nOver the centuries and right up to the present day, many artists worked on the local limestone to create beautiful sculptures. While visiting the Maltese islands, one can also admire many sculptures made of different materials such as bronze or marble.\n\nMusic\n\nThe traditional Maltese music includes għana, a traditional folk music. It involves folk guitar accompaniment while individuals, typically men, engage in alternating, sing-song arguments to argue a point.\n\nMusic is also an important part of village festas, with the local band playing during parades.\n\nContemporary Maltese music is largely influenced by Western music.\n\nLiterature\n\nWritten Maltese is a recent thing, as Italian and English were used in the written language. For that reason, Maltese literature emerged late in Malta’s history. This being said the oldest written text known to exist in Maltese is Il-Kantilena by Pietru Caxaro (1485).\n\nMaltese literature followed the Romanticism towards the end of the 18th century.\n\nFollowing World War II, an avant-garde literary movement emerged, called Moviment Qawmien Letterarju (Literary Revival Movement)."
