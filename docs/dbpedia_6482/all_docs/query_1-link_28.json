        "text": "August 20, 2024\n\nThe great siege of Malta 1565 is one of the most fascinating clashes of all time.\n\nThe undefeated Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent (among many other honorifics), dispatches a crack force of over 30,000 men to invade the island of Malta. An island which is also the doorstep of Christian Europe and the latest home of the Hospitallers - one of the two military monastic orders founded during the Crusades (with the other being the Templars).\n\nThe Order of the Hospitallers is led by an unbending, gutsy and ruthless Provencal warrior-monk, Jean Parisot de la Valette, who is resolved to raise hell while giving the Ottomans a run for their money. He is aided in his task by his English secretary and spymaster, Sir Oliver Starkey, as he rallies a force of knights, mercenaries and Maltese militiamen; these defenders are less than a third the number of the dauntless Ottoman army.\n\nThrough the years I’ve read many great stories about the siege of Malta, ranging from Nicholas Prata’s stirring ‘Angels In Iron’ to David Ball’s more romantic ‘The Sword And The Scimitar’ to Tim Willocks’ grisly, gore-spattered gem: ‘The Religion’. I was convinced that there was nothing more that could be done with this epic standoff in the realm of fiction.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nStep forth Peter Portelli, the first son of Malta to write a fictional account in English about this timeless episode. Portelli cleverly decides to zoom in on the actual people of Malta, an appropriate and inclusive approach that squarely places the leading Maltese protagonists of the struggle in the foreground. He sculpts engaging and entertaining characters which include the capable swimmer and spy Toni Bajada as well as two effective guerillas: marksman Cejlu Tonna and master swordsman Luqa Briffa.\n\nThis novel approach introduces a refreshing and fitting dimension to the siege which is grounded in painstaking research: research that is lightly and carefully blended into the prose so that it never detracts from the riveting and fast-paced story, filled as it is with unexpected twists and turns. And you get your inspiring female characters and genuinely emotive romantic scenes too.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that Maltese fiction in English is a rich and an as yet underexploited space, given Malta’s unique culture as well as the fact that English is an official and widely-spoken language on the island. So I am excited both by Peter Portelli’s confident literary debut and to know that he has more projects in the pipeline.\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\nI read Peter Portelli’s ‘The Order’ very slowly. To be precise, I devoured the first few chapters, only to realise that this would be one of those books I would immediately start missing as soon as I’d get to its last page. The story itself and its characters became my companions, so I wanted to prolong as much as possible the intertwining of my life with theirs.\n\nNot every novel I read has this magical quality, this ability to feel so real that the tale woven through its pages becomes an almost tangible part of my days. In truth, I find that many books of fiction fall short of achieving this. So I can safely say that it is quite remarkable for an author to be able to generate this effect in his very first book. It bears saying that Peter has also written a number of short stories, yet a book is a completely different kettle of fish. This is because, generally speaking, character development, story progression and the creation and resolution of tension in the narrative - to mention but three elements that make a good novel - are less difficult to sustain in a few pages rather than to prolong in an effective manner in over 300, without losing the reader’s interest and attention.\n\nStylistically, the book is written in a very clear and flowing way, making it both enjoyable and easy to understand. None of its chapters are heavy, not even the ones that deal with battles. This is also a notable accomplishment, since it is easy for descriptions of warfare and fighting to become too technical, too complicated or both.\n\nHolding two degrees in history, both specialising in Hospitaller Malta, I find this book to be well-researched, with the narrative being built around the main events in the Great Siege’s development. It also provides a good historical context within which to place the origins and causes of this momentous event which has become firmly embedded in our nation’s cultural memory.\n\nIn conclusion, ‘The Order’ is a must-read for all those with an interest in historical fiction and for anyone wanting to get immersed in a good story. It is also a very effective time-travelling tool for any reader with imagination!\n\nDecember 16, 2023\n\nThe anticipation for this book was entirely justified. Peter's commitment to extensive research to maintain historical authenticity truly shines through. The narrative weaves a captivating tale of spies, counter-spies, and a hint of romance, all enriched by an immersive experience crafted through meticulous attention to military aspects, traditions, and history. The result is a sophisticated and compelling narrative.\n\nThe chapter titles add an extra layer of intrigue, making it nearly impossible to pause at the end of a chapter, as the anticipation for the next one builds. Towards the book's conclusion, the narrative gains momentum, both in the prose and the frequent, concise sub-sections in each chapter, creating a surreal rhythm reminiscent of a combat atmosphere.\n\nIt could be that I am particularly intrigued by this book because it is about one of the biggest historical events that happened in my country, but I believe it will offer an engaging experience for everyone.\n\nAnd quoting a sentence that unfortunately might always remain so true:\n\nVallette scoffed. “I sincerely believe man will find a cure for all ailments one day, […]. But no apothecary will ever be able to drain greed from our blood. And as long as there is greed, my friend, there will be war.”\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nA great story about the siege of Malta and well researched. I loved the story since it gives an accurate detail of our history. Well done Peter Portelli.\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nPeter Portelli’s “The Order” is an exhilarating journey back to one of the most gripping moments in history—the Siege of Malta. With a masterful blend of historical accuracy and vivid imagination, Portelli breathes life into a tale that is both educational and enthralling. This book is not just a read; it’s an experience akin to watching a high-stakes historical drama unfold on the big screen.\n\nThe characters in “The Order” are exceptionally well-crafted, each with their unique backgrounds, motivations, and complexities. Portelli skillfully interweaves their personal stories with the grand narrative of the siege, creating a tapestry rich with emotion and tension. From the valiant knights of the Order to the determined defenders of Malta, every character feels real and relatable, making their struggles and triumphs all the more impactful.\n\nPortelli’s meticulous attention to historical detail is evident throughout the book. He transports readers to the 16th century, capturing the atmosphere, the landscapes, and the sheer scale of the siege with remarkable clarity. The vivid descriptions of the battles are intense and immersive, making you feel as if you are standing right there on the ramparts, experiencing the clash of swords and the roar of cannon fire.\n\nWhat truly sets “The Order” apart is Portelli’s ability to balance historical facts with a compelling narrative. He does not merely recount events; he weaves them into a story that is both informative and deeply engaging. The pace of the book is relentless, driving the reader forward with a sense of urgency that mirrors the desperate fight for Malta’s survival.\n\nIt’s a book that captures the spirit of an epic historical event with the flair and excitement of a blockbuster movie. Whether you are a history enthusiast or simply looking for a thrilling read, “The Order” will not disappoint.\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nThis has been on my TBR pile for a few months now but I knew, once I started reading it, I would not be able to put it down and so it proved!\n\nThe Order recounts one of the most famous chapters in Maltese history - The Great Siege of 1565 - when a huge armada of Ottoman ships descended on Malta to eliminate the Knights of St John once and for all. The story and the facts are well known, but The Order adds a rich layer of detail, merging fact with fiction to truly bring the events to life.\n\nThe main protagonists are well known but the introduction of characters such as the nobleman Nikola and the peasant fighter Luqa add new dimensions and perspectives which enrich the narrative no end. The different threads also add a rich layer to the otherwise well known facts.\n\nPeter Portelli manages to turn the events of 1565 into a contemporary story of spying, double-dealing, backstabbing (literally and figuratively), betrayal, love, family relationships and so much more. The horrors of battle are not shied away from but what shines through are the credible characters and their relatable interactions with one another.\n\nThis is a must read for anyone interested in Maltese history and is crying out to be made into a film or TV series. Well done Peter!\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nI picked this book at Valetta Airport at the end of my holidays in Malta. I wanted to learn more about the history of this small but fascinating island and The Order seemed to fit the bill. Very pleased with my choice, this book is hard to put down, well written and the best history lesson on the siege of Malta. It is Peter Portelli's first book but I hope he is going to write more because he has just gotten himself a new fan.\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nI simply could not put this book down, it’s informative, exciting, wonderful characters - a proper page turner. Was sorry when it finished\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\nThe vivid and detailed descriptions put the reader right in the middle of all the action. This is obviously a well-researched book and it was a thrill to see that our Maltese heroes were given a key part in this story. It is not, however, just a 'war story' and I believe it would be enjoyed by all readers, not just the history buffs! The end dialogue between Ċejlu and Nikola in the epilogue gives a perfect light-hearted ending to an epic story.\n\nJanuary 5, 2024\n\nThe story of the Malta Great Siege of 1565 has been told over and over again, but always with more attention to historical detail than to the human aspect. The Order breaks new ground in delivering a narrative of a historical event of epic proportions from the more human perspective of the protagonists - from the Grand Master, to the Turkish generals, to the many Maltese heroes who had been previously unsung. Enough poetic licence is taken by the author to bring these characters to vivid life as what they may have been, or might have been doing, rather than sticking to the dry and brief historical mentions we have had so far. The depiction of the colourful characters acts as the great leveller and while reading we see no difference in stature between someone like Luqa Briffa or Toni Bajada, and the high-ranking knights and noblemen in the tale. Their motivations, their flaws and their actions speak for them - the reader just has to listen, and understand. The Order is a highly-recommendable good read indeed.\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\nLoved reading this book. The story is very well written, not once did I come across something that felt out of place. The book is about tbe Great Siege of Malta, a pivotal chapter in the history of Europe. From the very first page, this book grabs your attention and transports you back in time. There's chivalrly, heroism, suspense and romance. There are well rounded characters that you can relate with. I also appreciated that the author gives us the point of view of all the parties involved in this story.\n\nI would also like to point out that while I was,reading it I kept on thinking that I can see this book turned into a great film!\n\nTo conclude, read this book Dear Readers, you won't regret it.\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\nBest read of 2023, the story grips you from the get go, the characters are relatable, it reads like a movie, once you start the first page you are transported to a different world so brilliantly recounted that it feels as though you are there, in the 16th century!!! Very hard to put this book down!! History and fiction are laced together beautifully!\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nOne of the best holiday reads I’ve read in a long time. The captivating story of the siege of Malta really draws you in. A huge compliment to Peter Portelli for this great work. As a member of the Order of Malta I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the history of the Order and the island of Malta. The combination of history and fiction is amazing."
