        "text": "I was born and raised in Malta. I came to Canada in 1977. Having taught philosophy of education and educational leadership and policy from a robust equity and social justice perspective since 1982 at McGill University, Mount St. Vincent University and the University of Toronto, I am now a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Social Justice Education, OISE, University of Toronto.\n\nI have been writing poetry and fiction since I was 16. However, my first poetry collection arrived in 2001. Since then I have published 7 collections of poetry (4 of which are bilingual), 2 collection of short stories (one available in English), and a novel (available in English). Five of my books in Maltese have been short-listed for the Malta National Book Prize.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that I have published many academic books and articles, some of which have received national and international awards, my focus in the last 8 years has been on literary work. I have concluded that literature is more beneficial to human well-being and social justice then rigid, conservative academic work. I have had the privilege to combine both aspects of my writing since I have developed and taught several times a course on Narratives of Migration and Exile which focuses exclusively on literary work. Also, migration, exile and issues of identities are major themes in my literary work.\n\nI now live between Toronto and Malta, and beyond. I consider myself to be a privileged nomad! And I still accept talking engagements on a variety of topics: narratives of migration and exile; the role of poetry and fiction in a democratic education; continuous professional development and quality assurance; student engagement and students ‘at risk’; teaching controversial issues; intercultural education and dialogue; equity and ethical issues in policy and leadership; social justice education; critiques of neoliberalism in education.\n\nAwards:\n\nDavid Hunt Teaching Award, OISE, University of Toronto (2013). Invited\n\nLansdowne Visiting Scholar, Faculty of Education, University of Victoria (February 2012)\n\nA.E.S.A. Critics’ Choice Award (2008) for Key Questions for Educators (co-edited with William Hare).\n\nCanadian Society for the Study of Education (C.S.S.E.) Mentorship Award (2005).\n\nA.E.S.A. Critics’ Choice Award (2001) for The Erosion of Democracy in Education; From Critique to Possibilities (co-edited with R. Patrick Solomon).\n\nInvited Noted Scholar, Faculty of Education, University of British Columbia (summer 1998).\n\nCanadian Association for the Foundations of Education (C.A.F.E.) Book Award (1998) for Philosophy of Education: Introductory Readings (co-edited with William Hare).\n\nAmerican Educational Studies Association (A.E.S.A.) Critics’ Choice Award (1997) for Children, Philosophy, and Democracy (co-edited with Ronald Reed).\n\nMcGill University Graduate Studies Research Scholarship (1983 – 84).\n\nMcConnell Graduate Fellowship, McGill University (1980 – 83).\n\nThe Guy Desautels Memorial Prize (1979) for the best graduate thesis in the Department of Philosophy, McGill University.\n\nCanadian Commonwealth Scholarship (1977 – 79)."
