He was a visiting professor at the University of Malta (1992), Acadia University (1997), the University of British Columbia (1998), and the University of Verona (2010, 2011).\n\nHe has published 27 books including eight collections of poetry, two collections of short stories and a novel, and over 100 articles and chapters in books.

Two of his books won the American Educational Studies Association Critic Award, and another of his books won the Canadian Association for the Foundations of Education Book Award.\n\nHis research includes theoretical and empirical studies.
