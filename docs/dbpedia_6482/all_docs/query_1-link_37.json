        "text": "Bio\n\nSteven Portelli was born and raised in Brantford. After leaving Brantford to pursue his education and early career, he was drawn back to his hometown to practice at Waterous Holden. He is deeply committed to the success of Brantford and has demonstrated this through his involvement in the community of Brantford and Brant, serving on a number of boards, providing pro bono legal services to several non-profits, and participating in curling and golf leagues.\n\nSteven completed an honours degree in Physics before attending law school. Following his call to the bar, Steven articled and worked as an associate with a large Bay Street firm specializing in securities, mergers and acquisitions and financing. This experience and training has proven valuable to his current practice as Steven is able to provide the quality and responsiveness of service of a Bay Street firm, combined with the accessibility of a hometown lawyer.\n\nSteven regularly takes on a number of difficult and time sensitive matters, and considers his quick responsiveness to his clients of the highest priority. Several lawyers in the Brantford area regularly refer difficult or complex matters to him from their own practices. If time is of the essence for your matter, then Steven will ensure that your matter is handled efficiently, effectively and within the timelines you require. No matter is too complex or refused.\n\nSteven has a significant practice encompassing a broad spectrum of new businesses, entrepreneurs, large businesses and manufacturers, cross border enterprises, not for profit organizations, and individuals requiring assistance with their wills, estates, real estate or other personal matters.\n\nAssociations\n\nBrant Law Association\n\nCanadian Bar Association\n\nLaw Society of Ontario\n\nOntario Bar Association\n\nCommunity Involvement\n\nCurrent:\n\nSt. Joseph’s Lifecare Foundation (Past Chair)\n\nMember of the Research Ethics Committee – Brant Community Health Care System\n\nBrant Community Foundation – Board Member\n\nPrevious:\n\nBrant Community Health Care System Foundation – Board Member\n\nHamilton Health Sciences Foundation (Member of the Gift Planning Services Committee)\n\nChamber of Commerce Brantford-Brant (Past President)\n\nMember of the Physician Recruitment Task Force\n\nYour Homes of Brantford (Director)\n\nNipissing University Board of Governors\n\nBoys’ and Girls’ Club of Brantford (Past President)\n\nSt. John’s College Alumni Association (Committee Member)\n\nGalaxy Youth Soccer Club (Director)\n\nBrant United Way (Chair)\n\nEducation\n\nAdmitted to the Ontario Bar, 2002\n\nQueen’s University, LL.B., 2000\n\nMcMaster University, B.Sc.(Hons) 1997\n\nInsights\n\nNon-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements: Are they enforceable?\n\nContact\n\np: 519.759.6220 ext. 372 e: sportelli@waterousholden.com\n\nAssistants\n\nTracy Fournier – p: 519.759.6220 ext. 310 e: tfournier@waterousholden.com\n\nSarah Beachey – p: 519.759.6220 ext. 381 e: sbeachey@waterousholden.com\n\nJoy Puim (Estate Planning) – p: 519.759.6220 ext. 321 e: jpuim@waterousholden.com\n\nShea Ramsay (Corporate) – p: 519.759.6220 ext. 334 e: sramsay@waterousholden.com\n\nClerks\n\nKathy Robinson (Estate Clerk) – p: 519.759.6220 ext. 361 e: krobinson@waterousholden.com\n\nBeth Edwards (Estate Clerk) – p: 519.759.6220 ext. 367 e: bedwards@waterousholden.com"
