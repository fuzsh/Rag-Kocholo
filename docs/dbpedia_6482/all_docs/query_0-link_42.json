Malta’s two official languages are English and Maltese, the indigenous language that has been spoken by the Maltese for centuries, but which for a long time, had been looked down upon and dubbed ‘the language of the kitchen’ by the educated Maltese who mainly spoke Italian or English. This paper examines the results of a series of large-scale surveys conducted by the author over a period of nearly a decade. During that period, Maltese language use steadily soared to the extent that overwhelmingly, respondents in the 1999 survey considered Maltese as the most important language for a person living in Malta. Moreover, the most recent survey (2001) revealed that the native language of the Maltese people is Maltese (98.6%). Why has Maltese become so important for a small island state that has applied for EU ...\n\nThis paper focuses on Maltese, the indigenous language of Malta- a miniscule island in the heart of the Mediterranean and a former colony of Britain until its Independence in 1964.

Why has Maltese become so important for a small island state that has applied for EU ...\n\nWith a tradition of exposure to more than one language throughout the history of the Maltese islands, culminating in the dominant position first of Italian and later of English, Maltese emerged in the 1964 Independence Constitution as the national language of the Maltese people, co-official with English (sections 1-7). With accession to the European Union in 2003, Maltese became an official language of the Union. The National Council for the Maltese Language was also established at this time (sections 8-9). In order to gauge the de jure and de facto linguistic situation, this paper explores various domains. In the legislative sphere (section 12) it is found that laws should be promulgated in both Maltese and English, where the Maltese text is binding in case of conflict between the two versions, but in fact there are loopholes allowing secondary legislation to be passed in English only. In very general terms, Maltese is widely spoken while English tends to be used more in writing, a..."
