Starting with a ghost story set in Goa, India in the 1950s, the collection weaves through various timelines and perspectives to focus on two children, Aiden and Ally Pinto. These siblings tackle their adventures in a predominantly white suburb with innocence, intelligence and a timid foot in two distinct cultures. Derek Mascarenhas takes a fresh look at the world of the new immigrant and the South Asian experience in Canada. In these stories, a daughter questions her father’s love at an IKEA grand opening; an aunt remembers a safari-gone-wrong in Kenya; an uncle’s unrequited love is confronted at a Goan Association picnic; a boy tests his faith amidst a school-yard brawl; and a childhood love letter is exchanged during the building of a backyard deck. Singularly and collectively, these stories will move the reader with their engaging narratives and authentic voices.\nWatch the Book Launch and Reading:\nPraise for Coconut Dreams:\n“This charming collection of stories resides between a suburban childhood in Canada and inherited, often mythic, tales from Goa that belong to the elders. Characters decide on love with rings lost at sea and soothe babies with stories of elephants in mountains. The voices in these stories are from people who seem far away and yet are inside us. Prepare to be delighted.”\n—Kim Echlin, author of Under the Visible Life\n“The stories in Derek Mascarenhas’s Coconut Dreams remind one of the high stakes in a child’s world, the way that danger looms just fractionally outside safety. Like all proper enchantments, these vignettes are dark, light, strange, and vivid such that they delight and charm in equal portions.”\n—Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer, author of All the Broken Things\n“In this evocative collection, Derek Mascarenhas takes up the fictional Pinto family and turns it gently in his hands, revealing new truths—and new questions—with every shift in point of view. A moving, multifaceted debut.”\n—Alissa York, author of The Naturalist\nPress Coverage for Coconut Dreams:\nSpring Preview 2019: Short fiction, poetry, and novels in translation —Quill & Quire\nMost Anticipated: Our Spring 2019 Fiction Preview —49th Shelf\n‘Picking Trilliums’: An excerpt from Coconut Dreams by Derek Mascarenhas —Rungh\nTalking Coconut Dreams with Derek Mascarenhas —Sarah Amormino, SAD Magazine\n‘So Far Away’: A short story from the book Coconut Dreams by Derek Mascarenhas —The Unpublishables\nRead an excerpt from Derek Mascarenhas’s new short story collection —Rabble\n“Author Derek Mascarenhas, the son of Goan immigrants who settled in Burlington, has captured a world he knows well.” —Sarah Murdoch, The Toronto Star\n“Mascarenhas writes with precision, shifting from one character’s perspective to another’s with an ease that is admirable and engrossing.
