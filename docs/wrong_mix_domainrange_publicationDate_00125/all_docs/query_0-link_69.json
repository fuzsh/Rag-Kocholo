        "text": "Worldbinder by David Farland, Tor, 9/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-7653-1665-3\n\nDavid Farland (who used to write as Dave Wolverton) has fashioned a new career for himself with the Runelords series, of which this is the sixth. If I hadn't already read the earlier books in the series, I would have been seriously inclined to pass it by because it incorporates many of the most overworked cliches in the field, the usurped throne, the disenfranchised heirs plotting revenge, dark magic opposed to the forces of light. One of the reasons these elements recur so often is, obviously, that they are popular with readers. We like being able to tell good from evil without worrying about gradations in between, and we like seeing the underdogs rising from defeat to outwit and outfight the villains and give them what they deserve. The difference between those novels which succeed despite the familiarity and those that don't is in the writing. No surprise there. Farland gets a boost from his well constructed and unusual system of magic and the relationships among the Runelords, but loses a few points because of a plot that moves in fits and starts at times, though it's not a fatal wound.\n\nThis continues from Sons of the Oak with Fallon and Jaz marshalling their forces (when they're not fighting for their lives), waiting for the day when they can carry the battle to the enemy and reclaim their birthright. There's plenty of action, battles and chases. In fact, there was a bit too much for me this time. I kept wanting the story to slow down a bit so I could process what was going on and maybe learn a bit more about how the characters were adjusting to their situation. There were several times when I had difficulty even picturing the physical location or action because it went by so quickly. Fans of the series should I enjoy it but I think it's a bit of a dip in the road despite the rousing ending. 5/31/07\n\nA Companion to Wolves by Sarah Monette and Elizabeth Bear, Tor, 10/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-7653-1816-9\n\nCollaborations are funny critters. Some of them end up feeling much like the work of one of the co-authors, others are clearly a blend, and still others read like an entirely new voice. Generally the last is the most successful, because it often means that the writers involved were able to recognize each other's strong points and take advantage of them. Even so, most collaborations do not work as well s the best of the fiction produced by the authors individually. There are exceptions, of course, like Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth, and Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore. This particular partnership struck me as somewhat unusual. Monette's three previous novels have been somewhat more literary than average variations on standard fantasy themes, but with an original setting and unusually strong characterization. Bear's two fantasy novels have had contemporary settings with bridges to an alternate world of magic, and they have been considerably more overt, though no less well written.\n\nThe early stages of the plot superficially resemble some of Andre Norton's work. The protagonist is a nobleman who has been chosen to telepathically bond herself to a wolf, so that together they can patrol the borders of the human settled portions of the world, defending against the incursions of trolls and goblins and other supernatural menaces. The situation somewhat resembles that of George R.R. Martin's ongoing series in that the menace has receded to such a low level that the human authorities have become complacent and are not prepared for a sudden increase in infiltration by evil forces. I'm not revealing any secrets by telling you that the protagonist rises to the occasion and the threat is turned back, eventually. It's not surprising either that this is extremely well written, and more suspenseful than most contemporary fantasy I've read. My only complaint - a minor one - is the large number of difficult to pronounce names (think Scandinavian sagas), which seriously impede those of us who still subvocalize when we read. 5/30/07\n\nCast in Secret by Michelle Sagara, Luna, 2007, $14.95, ISBN 978-0-373-80280-7\n\nKaylin Neya returns for her third magical mystery investigation. Crossovers between mystery and fantasy used to be rare - think Randall Garrett - because it was generally assumed that if you had magic, then it was too easy to cheat, and even if you didn't, readers would probably expect to be cheated. It was never entirely true, because you can construct the magic system to make the rules clearcut, or you can can shape your mystery so that the magical element is almost irrelevant. Several writers like Tamara Siler Jones and Martin Scott have found the hybrid mixture to be fertile ground, and Michelle Sagara has begun mining the same ore. In her first two outings, Kaylin discovered that the magical glyphs on her body could be both blessing and curse, solved the mystery of the murders of several children, and learned to handle herself in a tangle of court intrigue, personal ambition, and devious plots.\n\nThis time she's hoping her investigation into what appears to be a routine theft will be just that, with no magic, mayhem, or murder involved. But the more she learns, the more she realizes that the missing property is more valuable than it appears and that she is in danger of getting in over her head again. And echoing her first adventure, she is drawn to a mysterious young girl who apparently needs her help. She has to resolve matters not only because that's her duty, but because everything that happens is tied in some way to her own personal destiny. A satisfying mix of traditional fantasy, untraditional detective, and mild romance. This will undoubtedly be shelved in the romance section of most bookstores, but general fantasy fans should make a side trip and check it out. 5/27/07\n\nRed Seas Under Red Skies by Scott Lynch, Bantam, 8/07, $23, ISBN 978-0-553-80468-3 and Gollancz, 6/07, £18.99, ISBN 978-0-575-07695-2\n\nLast year new writer Scott Lynch introduced us to his con man hero in The Lies of Locke Lamora, the latest in a small but honorable line of fantasy protagonists whose profession is theft. He and his partner, Jean Tannen, aren't quite Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, but their relationship is similarly entertaining. There's a subtle difference as well, because both novels are caper novels, a kind of magical version of Oceans 11. Their first caper succeeded but they end up persona non grata and have to find a new home, or at least, new hunting grounds. That's where we find them in the sequel, the city state of Tal Verra.\n\nTal Verra is the site of the most famous gambling house in the known world, the Sinspire. The most rigidly enforced rule at the Sinspire is No Cheating, but that's exactly what the pair of adventurers intends to do, and they're pushed further in that direction by other forces. The task would have been difficult enough in itself, but someone knows what they're planning and is determined to bring about their ruin. This all sounds like an intellectual game of cat and mouse, but there's high adventure as well, including pirates, sea battles, and rousing battles. This blend of high fantasy and the caper novel isn't new, but it has rarely been done so well or on such a grandiose scale. After only two novels, Lynch is on my short list of writers to watch. He should be on yours as well. 5/26/07\n\nThe Lost Scrolls by Alex Archer, Gold Eagle, 2007, $6.50, ISBN 978-0-373-62124-8\n\nThis is the sixth in the Rogue Angel series, a pulpish men's adventure story featuring a macho female protagonist who mixes archaeology and martial arts, with a little assistance from Joan of Arc's sword, which appears magically whenever she needs it, thanks to her adventures in volume one. So far the titles have alternated between Victor Milan and Mel Odom, and this is one of Milan's installments. Annja Creed gets wind of some scrolls from Egypt that explain some of the secrets of Atlantis, including an energy source that would change the face of human civilization. As with the previous volumes, she's soon dodging bullets and bombs as she's chased across Africa and later parts of Asia, pursued by the minions of an oil company that would like to see that information suppressed for another few ages. This is unabashed comic book adventure so don't expect it to be consistently plausible, but it is a wild and amusing ride while it lasts. Looking forward to the next. 5/23/07\n\nStoneheart by Charlie Fletcher, Hyperion, 2007, $16.99, ISBN 978-142310175-8\n\nThe Wizard Heir by Cinda Williams Chima, Hyperion, 2007, $17.99, ISBN 978-142310487-2\n\nFinishing up this weekend's YA fantasy excursion are these two novels, the first and second novels in their respective series. The cover copy says this is Fletcher's first novel for children, but as far as I can tell it's his first novel of any kind. The protagonist is a twelve year boy living in contemporary London who, in a moment of rebellion or pique, breaks the head off a stone statue that turns out to be a magical artifact housing a powerful supernatural force. Inanimate objects begin to move of their own volition, threatening him, but is that what's really happening or is it all an illusion. Only his friend Edie sees what he sees. All of the statues of London are waking up and they're arrayed in two warring camps, with our young friends right smack in the battlefield. Each of the suddenly animate creatures is apparently based on a real statue in the city, which probably adds an extra bit of amusement to readers familiar with London. The story isn't complete in itself, so we're left with the situation unresolved and the children wondering what they can do about it. There are some pretty clever bits in this one and it's not badly written down. A darkish kind of contemporary fairy tale.\n\nThe second title is the follow-up to The Warrior Heir, published last year. In that one, a boy from the Midwest fails to take his medicine one day, and that leads to the revelation that he has superhuman powers. Not long after that, he's battling wizards and off to England to discover his true destiny. This new title focuses on a new character, Seph, an orphaned teenager whose uncontrolled, untrained magical talent results in miniature disasters wherever he goes. Even if he is not specifically identified as the cause, his disturbing presence results in his being shuttled from one place to another. Eventually he ends up in a remote private school in Maine where the headmaster recognizes what is happening and offers to train him so that the magic will no longer cause unintended problems. But it doesn't require a very sophisticated reader to realize that the sinister headmaster has reasons of his own for wanting to shape Seph's talents. This is a sidequel rather than a sequel, a story set against the same backdrop but not directly related to the earlier title. It's also a boy's school novel with some of the attributes of the Harry Potter books, though far less complexity and a comparatively small and less interesting cast of characters. That said, and despite the transparency of some of the plot elements, it was an enjoyable if familiar story, a little more polished than its companion book but a little less original as well. 5/22/07\n\nGift of the Unmage by Alma Alexander, Eos, 2007, $16.99, ISBN 978-0-083955-0\n\nOcean Realm by Rebecca Moesta & Kevin J. Anderson, Little, Brown, 2007, $16.99, ISBN 978-0-316--01056-6\n\nThe Titan's Curse by Rick Riordan, Miramax, 2007, $$17.95, ISBN 978-142310145-1\n\nI spent the weekend reading young adult fantasies, which seems to be almost as active as adult fantasy lately. Young adult science fiction has pretty much disappeared as a category, but warriors, wizards, magic, and quest stories appear to be very popular with younger readers, perhaps at least in part due to the popularity of the Harry Potter series, although the first of these three is even remotely in that tradition. These are all installments in ongoing series, which also reflects adult fantasy. They're also of surprisingly high quality though they reflect the same reliance on overused plots that dominates the genre as a whole.\n\nAlma Alexander has done a couple of adult fantasies. This is the opening volume in the trilogy, set on a kind of alternate version of our world. Thea is the seventh child of two seventh children and as such she is supposed to be heir to powerful magic. As she grows older, however, it appears that just the opposite is true, that she has little or no talent at all, so she is sent to a school that is dedicated to those with no magic. Even unsophisticated readers will know that things are not as they appear and that eventually she will discover a power of her own, magical or otherwise, and her meeting with a Native American confirms our suspicions; she is suppressing her talents unconsciously. Fans of Harry Potter might find this of particular interest although it is much less inventive and rather slow paced.\n\nOcean Realm is the second in the Crystal Doors trilogy. There's a lot more overt action in this one. In the first book, two siblings found themselves in a magical alternate world that was on the brink of war, and found themselves pitted against a giant sea creature. The victory is short lived, however, because the undersea people take them prisoner and carry them off to their submerged city. There they uncover a sinister plot by the enemy ruler and a mysterious ally which could upset the balance of power and wreak havoc in the surface world. The story is nothing special but the undersea realm is skillfully rendered and actually much more interesting than the surface world. A bit obvious for older readers but with a nice, crisp, fast moving story.\n\nThird, and best of this group, is The Titan's Curse, third in the Olympians series. The young protagonist discovered in The Lightning Thief that he is the son of a Greek god, and by The Sea of Monsters mythological characters and creatures are popping up all over the place. Things have settled down for Percy, but they don't stay that way for long and he has to resort to his trust sword, Riptide, and his magical friends for the latest battle. There's a split among the gods, with the scheming Kronos leading a faction that hopes to upset the balance of power in their favor. But Percy and his friends are about to foil his plans. Although the plot sounds serious enough, Riordan delivers his story with a good deal of genuinely funny humor rather than farce, and sustains it throughout the story. A cute plot would have been noteworthy enough, but the writing is consistently witty and inventive. I look forward to more adventures of Percy Jackson and his friends. 5/21/07\n\nPoltergeist by Kat Richardson, Roc, 8/07, $14, ISBN 978-0-451-46150-9\n\nAlthough there really aren't any completely new ideas in fiction, there are variations which feel different enough that readers respond favorably, which generates heavy sales, which usually leads to imitators and emulators. Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is the most obvious recent example. I draw a distinction between imitators and emulators. The imitator looks at the successful work and decides that he or she can profit by writing something as close to the original as possible without actually plagiarizing it. Emulators are a higher order of being. An emulator looks at the original and says, hey, this author has something interesting here, but I think I can take some of the ideas here and rework them into something else, something similar and at least as good, maybe even better. Much of the current crop of urban fantasy falls into these two categories, just as a few years back everyone was imitating or emulating J.R.R. Tolkien or Robert E. Howard.\n\nIn this case, the original is Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake stories, not entirely groundbreaking in themselves, but very obviously successful. The formula is fairly simple. The setting is similar to our world except that magic and creatures like vampires are real, their existence either hidden or generally known. The protagonist is almost always a highly competent young woman who solves mysteries and overcomes the villains. Writers like Charlaine Harris (emulator) have tinkered with the formula to create genuinely interesting and original work. Others have ranged from that general area to slavishly imitative. Kat Richardson's Harper Blaine novels (this is the second) are at the high end of the scale. Harper was a private investigator who was technically dead for a short period of time, and found herself with new abilities when she returned to life. She is a Greywalker (the title of her first adventure), someone who can perceive and make use of the borderland between mundane reality and the supernatural.\n\nThe novel is in some ways a straightforward murder mystery. Harper is called in by a university official who believes that someone has been falsifying experimental results in an attempt to prove that they have successfully created a poltergeist. Her preliminary investigation leads to the opposite conclusion, that the disembodied entity is real. Then one of the researches is murdered under odd circumstances and the question becomes whether the poltergeist could and did commit the murder, or whether someone else is using the phenomenon to conceal a more sordid and mundane crime. I'm obviously not going to tell you the answer. The supporting characters are nicely done, the mystery is engaging, and the protagonist is a distinct individual. Because most people consider novels of this type fantasy , I've listed it that way but it's also supernatural horror. Whatever you choose to call it, let's hope Harper Blaine returns for many more equally exciting exploits. 5/20/07\n\nDeepwood by Jennifer Roberson, DAW, 7/07, $25.95, ISBN 978-0-7564-0418-5\n\nI've been a fan of Jennifer Roberson's fantasy ever since the Cheysuli series back a good many years ago. This is volume two in her newest series, sequel to Karavans, and probably her best novel to date. A family of six have taken passage to a distant land with a caravan, but eventually choose a divergent path in order to arrive more quickly. They are accompanied by only a single man, a man who is not altogether human. The shortcut is dangerous because it approaches the borders of a vast, enchanted forest which is itself a kind of single, malevolent intelligence, inhabited by demonic creatures some of which were formerly perfectly ordinary but who fell under the influence of the twisted magic.\n\nTheir passage might have been uneventful, but the borders of the forest fluctuate and they inadvertently fall within its field of influence. The forest has the power to physically transform its victims as well as kill them. The party of travelers is overtaken and scattered. The most significant victim is the mother, who is pregnant, and whose child would be a fine catch for the evil that dwells around her. And she's going to discover that even the things she thought she knew are false and that she has to trust one who has lied to her if there is to be any chance of her escaping the forest and finding her family.\n\nIt goes almost without saying that this is well written, but it also stands out because of the richly imagined world. The haunted forest of Alisanos is a decidedly different kind of enchanted forest, suggesting Robert Holdstock or Paul Hazel rather than traditional fairy tales. It's also a mighty fine story. 5/19/07\n\nPandoras Closet edited by Jean Rabe and Martin H. Greenberg, DAW, 8/07, $7.99, ISBN 978-0-7564-0437-6\n\nHere we have a collection of fantasy stories about clothing, although the definition gets stretched a bit. Timothy Zahn opens with a fairly good story about a cursed ring, followed by Christopher Piersons okay tale of a magical helmet that gives its wearer extraordinary powers, played for laughs. Louise Marley looks at a grown up Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz and what might be in store for her when next she dons her magic shoes. By now I was detecting a trend. Each article of clothing has a magical property.\n\nMost of the next few stories follow the same pattern, well told but unexceptional. John Helfers provides a different setting  historical Japan  and his story stood out a bit, as does Linda Bakers reminiscence about Janis Joplin. Most of the remaining stories are light humor, cute but repetitious. The best story in the collection is Jane Lindskold's \"The Travails of Princess Stephen\" and the most unusual is by Belle and Nancy Holder. Peter Schweighofer has a good story about a cap that allows the Allies to eavesdrop on German radio traffic. Elizabeth Vaughan and Sarah Zettel also have above average contributions.\n\nThere aren't any bad stories in the book, and several of them would probably have made a better impression if I hadn't read them all in close proximity. In general, this falls prey to the narrow theme syndrome, and I suggest reading it in small increments rather than straight through. 5/17/07\n\nThe Dark River by John Twelve Hawks, Doubleday, 2007, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-385-51429-3\n\nFirst of all, the hype. This is supposedly the pseudonym of a writer whose identity is so closely guarded that even his agent and publisher don't know who he is. He communicates by satellite phone, has dropped out of the modern world's information network, and lives in the US and the UK. What a load of crap. The idea that an agent would handle an unknown fantasy writer of average talent without knowing who he was, or that a publisher would send money without having a social security number, or for that matter that the writer himself could travel back and forth between the US and Europe without showing up on any records would indicate either that he was one of those secret masters he is supposedly trying to avoid, or that the whole thing is a fraud. Take your pick.\n\nLeaving aside that nonsense, this is the sequel to The Traveler, in which we learned that the entire world is secretly being managed by a group called the Tabula, a kind of Illuminati. Opposed to them are the Travelers and their militant wing, the Harlequins, although both are a vanishing breed, on the verge of complete defeat in their eternal struggle for human independence. Certain individuals are able to use their psychic powers to travel among realities. Two of the main characters are brothers, one of whom fights for good, the other of whom has been turned to the dark side. The action in this volume is their race to find their missing father, with an ensuing adventure beneath the streets of London and New York, and elsewhere. The novel is a competently written adventure story, a kind of Dan Brown thriller with magic. But there's nothing particularly special about it and the anti-technological subtext is mildly distracting. The Tabula would no doubt urge you to buy it and the Travelers would tell you to steal a copy. I'll just say wait for the paperback, or pick it up used. 5/16/07\n\nThe Children of Hurin by J.R.R. Tolkien, Houghton Mifflin, 2007, $26, ISBN 978-0-618-89464-2\n\nWho would have thought there'd be a new J.R.R. Tolkien book of fiction after all these years? This is more of a history than a story, edited by Christopher Tolkien into a semblance of a single, continuous narrative. The time is ages before the days of the Lord of the Rings, when humans are new in the world and the Big Bad is Morgoth, a kind of precursor to Sauron. The armies of elves and men attempt to destroy him, but they are outgeneraled and defeated, retreating primarily to a hidden city while others of their host are killed or captured including Hurin. One of the refugees is Turin, his son, who eventually takes refuge in a hidden elvish kingdom. There he grows to manhood, always hoping to seek vengeance against Morgoth, but through a chain of happenstance and bad judgment, he is responsible for the death of one of the king's councilors, which doesn't make him particularly welcome there.\n\nAlthough the title refers to \"children\", the book is primarily about Turin, who through mischance, bad luck, and most of all the evil curse of Morgoth becomes successively a refugee, an outlaw, a prisoner of the orcs, and the accidental killer of his closest friend. He changes names a half dozen times or so in the process. Turin's sister takes center stage briefly toward the end as she and her mother seek Turin and run into big trouble instead. She ends up with amnesia and eventually meets her brother, who doesn't recognize her since he has never seen her before. They fall in love and eventually are married, obviously yet another effect of Morgoth's curse.\n\nThere is a strong narrative structure, but this is as much a history as a fiction. It's a surprisingly unified and impressive work. I had assumed that anything previously unpublished would be comparatively minor. In addition to the text there are genealogies, miscellaneous background material, and an extensive list of proper names. There are also some nifty tipped in full color paintings by Alan Lee. 5/15/07\n\nThe Gospel of the Knife by Will Shetterly, Tor, 7/07, $25.95, ISBN 978-0-312-86631-0\n\nTen years ago, Will Shetterly introduced us to the Nix family, progressives in a time of violent change, and possessors of magical secrets. The family returns in this new novel for further adventures. The time is 1969 and the place is the Deep South, a society torn between the past and the future. Christopher Nix is a teenager who inclines toward the hippie look, and that makes him an obvious target for the less tolerant people in the community. One day the Nix family receives an interesting offer. A rich man offers to pay for Christopher's private schooling, supposedly to pay the family back because Christopher's grandfather saved the benefactor's life during World War I, although grandfather isn't around to confirm that story. And story it is, as we find out in due course, because that's not the real reason at all. There's a lot of great stuff in here, secret societies, legends, mysteries to resolve, questions of ethics and the role of religion, and much more. Unfortunately, for this reader at least, the author's choice of an unusual narrative device was so distracting that I was often frustrated. The book is written in second person present tense, and it felt so artificial to me that I was conscious of the author's presence (and heavy hand) through the entire book. 5/12/07\n\nNatural Ordermage by L.E. Modesitt Jr., Tor, 9/07, $27.95, ISBN 978-0-7653-1813-X\n\nThe Recluce series reaches its fourteenth title with this one, which I think makes it the longest running high fantasy sequence since James Branch Cabell's Poictesme, unless you count the Xanth books by Piers Anthony. And like Cabell, the series is united only by its setting, with different sets of characters in different subsets. I confess that I have had mixed feelings about the earlier books in this series, which I found to be quite varied in effectiveness, and I thought his other sequence, the Corean Chronicles, was far better as well as more unified. It was almost immediately obvious that this one would have only minimal relationship to the others. Most of it is set in a land far from Recluce and follows the adventures, and misadventures, of Rahl, who is serving an apprenticeship to learn magic, but whose talents appear to vary significantly from the norm. Rahl uses his magic inappropriately and eventually that gets him into so much trouble that he is exiled to a remote location where he has less opportunity to misuse his power. But Rahl is more ingenious than they think, and impetuous as well. It's a coming of age story, obviously, and in due course Rahl gains self control and earns some respect, becomes a mage guard, and starts to use his unique talents in more constructive ways. Things don't go entirely his way, though, and the book actually ends with his star in apparent decline, although he is determined to repair the situation. This is the first of two closely related novels, or more properly a novel in two volumes, so don't be surprised if there's not a strong finish. 5/10/07\n\nTerritory by Emma Bull, Tor, 7/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-312-85735-6\n\nI had two very strong motives for reading this book. First and primary, I've never read anything by Emma Bull I didn't like, and she writes infrequently enough that it feels like every instance is a special occasion. Second, this particular fantasy involves one of my favorite historical incidents, the Gunfight at the OK Corral. I've probably watched the film a dozen times and the related episode of Star Trek was one of my favorites as well. So I cleared up the paperwork on my desk, paid the bills, finished cataloguing the new arrivals, disposed of the empty soda cans, finished responding to my emails, and settled back to read her newest.\n\nWisely, I think, the historical characters - Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Ike Clanton - are almost peripheral and we follow most of the story from the viewpoint of Jesse Fox, a young Easterner who has traveled to the old west where he is told that he has a hidden magical talent. So does his new acquaintance, Doc Holliday, to say nothing of Wyatt Earp, a full fledged sorcerer. The second major fictional character is Mildred Benjamin, a secretive writer working at the local newspaper, who also has paranormal abilities. Eventually, the two of them will develop a powerful bond. The surface conflict is the battle between law and order, but beneath the veneer we see a power struggle going on among various magic practitioners whose private agendas may have little to do with the law. And I can't tell you much more than that without providing too many spoilers. Bull has taken the old west and given it a rich, magical overcoat, but without changing what lies beneath. It still reads like a western adventure, even if magic does work. I was sorry to see this one end. Let's hope her next novel isn't quite so long in coming. 5/6/07\n\nWhen Bad Snakes Attack Good Children by Dan Greenburg, Harcourt, 2007, $9.95, ISBN 978-0-15-206056-5\n\nThis is the eighth volume in a series of fantasy novels for younger readers that follow the adventures of the Schluffmuffin children, whose father was converted to vampirism a few titles back and who have weathered a variety of dangers and adventures involving oversized sea creatures, curses, and so forth. This time they've uncovered a plot involving a coup against the government of the US and set out to inform the FBI, but things predictably go awry. First of all, their father - the vampire - doesn't want them traveling on public transportation without an adult companion. Even worse, there's a little old lady following them who plans to assassinate them and she has some reptilian allies to help her along. Despite the lively plot and nasty villains, these are basically light humor along the lines of some of the Goosebumps novels, although much better written. 5/6/07\n\nThief with No Shadow by Emily Gee, Solaris, 2007, $7.99, ISBN 978-1-84416-469-1\n\nMost contemporary urban fantasies are recognizably set in our world, although a version which has been altered by the presence of magic, vampires, or some fantastic element. The injection of that alien element into our world is what makes the story. Emily Gee's first novel goes a bit further because it's not set in our world at all, but in some ways in evokes the same sense of conflicting realities and strangeness. Her protagonist is Melke, who might seem human but who was a mystical power of invisibility. A talent like that is likely to make someone into a pretty effect thief, and that's what she needs to be when her brother falls afoul of evil magic. But it's not simply a case of sneaking into a well guarded house and making off with an amulet or some other magical artifact. Her target is guarded by more than simple guards and locked doors, and she has enemies of her own who would like to see her dead. Will she achieve her goal, save her brother, and find true love in the process? Well, we all know the answer to that, don't we, although in this case it doesn't matter quite as much as with most similar novels, because the author presents us with an interesting world to explore. The dialogue could use some work. Everyone seems inclined to talk in unnaturally short, clipped sentences. There's considerable potential in this imaginative adventure, but the mechanics need some practice. Intertwined with the main story is her relationship with Bastian, who initially despises her and her kind, but finds his attitude changing as time passes. There's also a talking, sort of, dog. 5/3/07\n\nThe Hanging Mountains by Sean Williams, Pyr, 6/07, $$25, ISBN 978-1-59102-544-3\n\nIf you haven't read the first two books in this series, The Crooked Letter and The Blood Debt, you're probably going to be hopelessly confused very quickly. Williams has created a quite original fantasy world - a far future Earth - for this series, initially fairly ordinary until we discover that it is linked to another reality that functions as the afterlife for the inhabitants of the first world, although it is also populated by some pretty scary monsters. The link becomes more physical when one of a set of royal twins dies, making it possible to invade and conquer the other reality. In the second volume, a homunculus is created with the power to recall souls from death, and the moderately large cast of characters begins to display conflicting and sometime cryptic motives and actions.\n\nThe third volume is in many ways a more conventional quest story with the goal a means to avert the terrible threat that has been brewing since book one. There has also been a terrible flood and in the aftermath subsidiary conflicts are beginning to erupt on every side. The Hanging Mountains of the title are the source of the flood, and some of the characters are headed there, hoping to remedy the situation. They have various adventures which are quite well done although at times the pace of the narrative slows significantly and unnecessarily, almost as though the author wanted to flesh this one out so that he'd have enough story left to tell for the fourth and final installment. The dialogue is particularly refreshing and some of the episodic sequences are outstanding. More adventurous than the first two, but somewhat less suspenseful. I'm looking forward to finding out how Williams ties up all the loose ends. 5/1/07\n\nA Fate Worse Than Dragons by John Moore, Ace, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-441-01495-8\n\nJohn Moore is writing the closest thing to Unknown Magazine style fantasy that we see nowadays, and if he hasn't quite reached the level of L. Sprague de Camp, then at least he's moving in that direction. Sir Terry is a rather mediocre knight who really wants to woo and wed the princess, but knows that his undistinguished record and nature are such that he is out of the running unless he can find a way to do something really outstanding, something that will command her attention. So off he goes to battle a deadly dragon, and almost to his own surprise, he wins. Everything should be coming up roses, right? Well, think again, because Sir Terry made a basic error. He didn't get his facts straight and the dragon in question was not, after all, the bane of the kingdom's existence. It was the bane of someone else's existence, and its defeat really doesn't matter much to the people he hoped to impress. The only thing working in his favor is that the Princess in question is actually quite fond of him, and she decides to fake her own kidnapping so that he can rescue her, become a more relevant hero, and win her hand. But plans deceptively simple can often be distressingly complex, and you don't have to sneak a look into later chapters to know that things aren't going to go the way the two would-be lovers have planned. Filled with anachronisms, slight jokes and a few not so slight, and a happy ending. This is lightweight, obviously, but just what you need to balance the last six hundred page battle between a band of reckless heroes and the evil sorcerer who usurped their rightful throne.\n\nThe Mirador by Sarah Monette, Ace, 8/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-441-01500-9\n\nThe third installment of the adventures of Felix Harrowgate, a handsome but severely flawed magician, and his half brother, Mildmay the Fox, whom I actually have preferred as the protagonist in the first two books, although both characters have their problems, psychological as well as more straightforward ones. Mildmay is a bit of a rogue, a one time burglar and killer, whose main hope of survival is his mystical as well as physical link to Felix. After the events of the first two books, Felix is once again in a position of some power in the court of Melusine, but even if he was a more stable character to start with, his position would be less than secure. He has made powerful enemies in the past and is not averse to making new ones in the present. The Mirador gathers together a large number of like minded wizards, but it's not the only focus of magical power. One of these rival groups has employed a spy to help them undermine the Mirador, which will not only crush the authority of their rivals but also bring devastation to Melusine. It is possible that the Mirador might be saved, but perhaps at the cost of Felix's life. And will Mildmay stand aside calmly and allow that to happen? Of course not.\n\nAlthough Monette's plots are still squarely in the mainstream of fantasy, and are sometimes so predictable that there are few surprises, her ability to create complex characters is becoming much more obvious as the series progresses. I'm not sure that I really like either Felix or Mildmay, but I like reading about them. They're far more credible and vivid than most of the high minded nobles, dedicated or evil wizards, and lovable but roguish thieves that populate most fictional fantasy worlds. 4/29/07\n\nThe Mirror of Worlds by David Drake, Tor, 7/07, $25.95, ISBN 978-0-7653-1260-0\n\nThis is the second volume in the Crown of Isles trilogy, which is itself a sequel to the earlier Lord of the Isles series. In the first volume, The Fortress of Glass, we were introduced to a variety of sometimes bewildering plots. Prince Garric attempts to help a potential ally in his battle against rogue wizards and finds himself in an alternate world with its own conflicts. While all of this is taking place, there is a low key (at least initially) struggle to determine who should rule in Garric's stead until he returns, assuming that he ever does. The multi-leveled plot left us with multiple cliffhangers, a device he uses frequently in his fantasy fiction. This sequel pretty much follows the same formula. There has been an upsurge in the potency of magic, so that even the inept find themselves directing dangerous power. Events also conspire to keep Garric and his three main allies scattered or divided among themselves, almost as if the world itself wanted to keep them from consolidating their rule over the many islands of their world. Into this already wild mix, Drake adds so many new elements this time that your head may be spinning by the time you've absorbed them all. The waters are receding and new lands are emerging, but with them comes a host of new creatures who are able to reach the world from the past and future as well as the present. Now it's not just a battle to see who will direct the future of the human race, but a struggle to ensure that there will be any future at all. And as if that wasn't enough, this installment ends with the introduction of an even greater force. Presumably this will all be resolved in the next and last in the series, but matters are so complicated that a lengthy gap between the two may leave readers scratching their heads when they try to remember just who is who and what is what. Plenty of adventure in this one, perhaps even a bit too much. 4/28/07\n\nWorshipping Small Gods by Richard Parks, Prime Books, 2007, $14.95, ISBN 978-0-8095-5745-5\n\nI had previously read most of the stories in this collection in Realms of Fantasy magazine, and several of them felt like old friends revisited. Many of Richard Parks short fantasies are based on classic mythology, sometimes recasting old stories in a new shape. Kallisti, for example, describes the machinations among the gods that led to the Trojan war and The Penultimate Riddle, one of his best, describes an encounter between a sphinx and a most unusual man. Parks draws on Asian mythology for many of his stories, including Yamabushi, a deceptively quiet story about a man and a tengu, a kind of Japanese demon. The title story involves a duel of patience between a saint and a god, changing both, and the border between death and life is blurred in The Plum Blossom Lantern. Ghosts and other mysteries abound in Fox Tails, a somewhat darker story than most of the others in the collection. \"A Time for Heroes\" involves demons and dwarves but it has more in common with Lord Dunsany than Tolkien or the Forgotten Realms. In \"The Right God\", deities begin manifesting themselves around the world in droves. The final story in the collection, another original, describes a many leveled encounter between a man lacking purpose and a bag lady and the magic that comes to exist between them.\n\nThat doesn't mean Parks is a one note author. \"A Hint of Jasmine\", \"Voices in an Empty Room\" and \"Diva\", and \"Hanagan's Kiyomatsu, 1923\" - the last two original in this book - have contemporary settings and a much more somber tone. All three involve Eli, a modern day ghost hunter, who uncovers the truth in decaying mansions and other venues, using modern as well as traditional techniques. Although in form these might be closer to horror fiction, the approach is more matter of fact and there is little actual menace, though certainly considerable mystery. I liked \"A Hint of Jasmine\" and \"Diva\" the best of these. The quality of the stories is consistently high throughout and evidence that no matter how moribund novel length fantasy may be, the shorter form continues to be lively and inventive. 4/27/07\n\nSoul Song by Marjorie M. Liu, Leisure, 7/07, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-8439-5766-2\n\nAlthough this is technically the fifth book in a series of paranormal romances, the Dirk & Steele series, each of the novels is completely independent and you don't need to read them in any particular order. The current one involves a woman who has the ability to see into the future, although as you might expect the talent works when it is convenient to the story line and fails when at other times. The author doesn't cheat, however; there are specific rules about the gift, or curse; it only gives previews of violent deaths. Kitala Bell, the psychic, discovers the existence of magical beings living in the sea, most notably a handsome man, M'cal, to whom she is almost immediately drawn. M'cal isn't entirely master of his own fate, however, and their mutual fate may be in the hands of a woman with ambitious and malicious plans. There's shapeshifting as well in this wide ranging but oddly flat romance, which has its moments but which I found disappointingly unremarkable compared to the previous books I've read by this author. 4/27/07\n\nBone Song by John Meaney, Gollancz, 2007, £10.99, ISBN 978-0-575-07954-0\n\nI had a very mixed reaction to this novel by British writer Meaney, whose previous books have all been science fiction. On the one hand, it's extremely inventive. The setting is an alternate world only superficially like our own. It has technology and cities and the protagonist is in fact a police detective working for one of those series, currently detailed to protect the life of a visiting opera star. She is considered in jeopardy because someone has been systematically murdering prominent artists and stealing their bodies. Why steal the bodies? Well, that's the crux of the story and the meaning behind the title. The city - the civilization - is based on a kind of necromancy, the consumption of the bodies of the dead in order to provide the power that keeps a technological society functioning. But there's another aspect as well. By simply touching the remnants of the dead, a bone fragment for example, one can experience visions of unearthly beauty. So it's not surprising that some individuals - and in this case an entire secret society - is interested in acquiring the bodies of the most accomplished artists in the world. This conflict sets the stage for the main story, although the author explores an even wider range of subjects before he's done.\n\nThat's the good part. Here's the bad. Particularly in the early chapters, I was constantly aware of the author's intervention. Revelations of details about the society and the characters were not smooth, and sometimes they're very artificial. There was also a feeling that things were being hurried, that the author was presenting this information only because he thought it was necessary, and as soon as it was delivered he moved on to something else. In this age of bloated fantasy novels, I feel awkward in saying this, but inside this 340 page, somewhat rushed fantasy there can be found the scrunched up form of a much better 500 page novel. 4/22/07\n\nYear's Best Fantasy 7 edited by David G. Hartwell & Kathryn Cramer, Tachyon, 2007, $14.95, ISBN 978-1-892391-50-6\n\nAlthough novel length fantasy has for many years been dominated by a few themes and plots, shorter fantasies have always been more varied. There has been some movement during the past couple of years to break up the domination of quasi-medieval adventures and imitations of Tolkien and Howard, with urban fantasy emerging as almost a sub-genre of its own. You won't find much traditional fantasy in this collection of the best shorts from 2006, although in some cases there may be superficial resemblances. The editors have looked at a wide range of sources to find their selections, including internet publications, anthologies, magazines, original stories in single author collections, and elsewhere.\n\nGene Wolfe opens with a wry story about a very unusual teddy bear. Charles Stross continues the contemporary trend with the very good \"Pimpf\", which mixes supernatural with the gaming world. Peter S. Beagle adds four short fables with pointed teeth. \"The Potter's Daughter\" by Martha Wells is more mainstream fantasy, featuring a protagonist who is half fairy, but the story isn't about magic or fairies as much as it is about knowing oneself and accepting the limitations of affection. Howard Waldrop always writes as though he was sitting in an alternate world and just describing it rather than creating it, and \"Thin, on the Ground\", accomplishes the same results, a mildly dark adventure story set in Mexico, sort of.\n\n\"Pol Pot's Beautiful Daughter\" by Geoff Ryman impressed me when I first read it some months ago. It is one of the most emotionally powerful stories I've read in a long time. Good stories follow by Greg Van Eekhout, Gavin Grant (a ghost story), and Nina Kiriki Hoffman, with one of the moody, low key fantasies that she has been doing so well and so often that I'm amazed she hasn't had at least a couple of short story collections published during the past few years. Diana Wynne Jones has a cute piece about kids and the power of words. Gene Wolfe's second contribution, \"Bea and Her Bird Brother\" is the better of the two, the story of a woman who has to accept that magic is real and, in her case, very personal.\n\nIan R. MacLeod's \"The Bonny Boy\" is probably one of my two favorites in the collection, a thoughtful story set in an alternate Victiorian England. L.E. Modesitt Jr. writes a story peripherally related to his trilogy of novels set in an alternate world where North America is balkanized and a king of physical manifestation of ghosts is possible. M. Rickert's \"The Christmas Witch\" is the second of my favorites, a contemporary story of the supernatural that reminded me at times of the best of early Ray Bradbury. Rickert is a writer poised to become a major name and perhaps to transcend genre. Michael Moorcock adds another quirky story of the Multiverse, with some of the trappings of sword and sorcery, but an entirely different texture. Robert Reed's \"Show Me Yours\" reverts to a more contemporary setting and deals with magical revenge.\n\nI've never read a Lucius Shepard story I didn't like, and \"The Lepidopterist\" did not break the string. It's one of his Central American stories, subtle and intricate, with a setting so vivid it's a slight jolt when the story ends and you find yourself back in the mundane world. Sharon Shinn's story is the closest to mainstream fantasy in the book, but if you've read Shinn before, you'll know that she isn't going to do the ordinary with even the most ordinary tools. My third favorite in the book is the vaguely Lovecraftian \"Hallucigenia\" by Laird Barron, whose previous three or four stories have also been quite good. The story ends with a lighter piece by Michael Swanwick, almost a fairy tale. An exceptionally good collection overall with several stories that have a good chance of showing up on the Hugo and Nebula ballots this year. 4/21/07\n\nKing's Property by Morgan Howell, Del Rey, 8/07, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-345-49650-8\n\nDespite the publicity release describing Morgan Howell as a first time author, the name appears to be the pseudonym of Will Hubbell, who published a couple of science fiction novels under his own name. This is the first volume of a mildly Tolkien derived trilogy, filled with orcs and magic and associated plot elements, but with a quite different perspective. Dar is a young woman who falls prey to her own family's treachery and becomes a slave in the army of King Kregant, who plots the conquest of a neighboring realm. She is given to a company of orcs, but she refuses to be cowed by their brutal nature or frightful appearance. Slowly she gains acceptance and even influence among them, and it's obvious long before the first volume ends that she is destined to achieve an even greater status in the volumes to come. The series title alone suggests what is in store for her. Dar's feisty character is the biggest asset of this otherwise standard sword and sorcery adventure with military overtones. The author uses the kind of artificially proper dialogue that is common in fantasies like this, and which I find unnecessary and artificial, but it's not so heavy handed that you're likely to notice it very often.\n\nA possibly interesting sidelight. Based on the information on the copyright page, this book was originally supposed to have been called Queen's Shadow and the next in the series, Clan Daughter, was to have been Queen's Mark. Apparently all three volumes were retitled somewhere late in the process. 4/20/07\n\nThe Heart of Stars by Kate Forsyth, Roc, 2007, $7.99, ISBN 978-0-451-46144-5\n\nThe latest fantasy from Kate Forsyth is the third in her Rhiannon's Ride series, following The Tower of Ravens and The Shining City. Old animosities complicate what might otherwise have been just a routine story of rescuing the princess, or in this case the prince and princess. Those two worthies have been abducted by an evil sorcerer as part of his plot to undermine the current ruler and establish his own family as the new rulers. The protagonist is a semi-human female warrior, Rhiannon, who rides a winged horse and brooks no opposition. Rhiannon's emotions and her sense of duty come into conflict this time because the princess is also her rival for the attention of the man they mutually admire and this is obviously an easy way to eliminate the opposition, particularly an opposition which has in the past shown no inclination to fight fairly. But, as if we had any doubt, her obligations to the people and her dislike of the sorcerer sway her in the right direction.\n\nThe adventure is lively and dresses up familiar plot devices with fresh clothing. Nothing out of the ordinary but certainly as well written enough for genre readers. Some of the dialogue is written in a dialect that I found distracting but it wasn't a big problem. The protagonist is well drawn although oddly I found her rival, Princess Olwynne, more interesting. Some nice imagery, particularly during the early sequence when the court begins to respond to the outrage. Forsyth is a solid, reliable stalwart of the field, although she has yet to produce anything close to a breakout novel. 4/18/07\n\nWater Logic by Laurie J. Marks, Small Beer Press, 6/07, $16, ISBN 978-1-931520-23-2\n\nThere's been a considerable gap and a change of publisher since the second volume of the Elemental Logic series appeared, but it's here at last and the structure of the series is such that you won't have any difficulty picking up the thread of what's been happening. The people of Shaftal were invaded and essentially conquered, but they've overthrown the invaders and cut them off from home, leading to a divisive situation in which the survivors must somehow be integrated into the society that they once dominated. As the new government attempts to work out a fair, workable peace and development plan, other issues arise to interfere with their efforts. Zanja, one of the new leaders of Shaftal, finds herself involved with a mystery involving a magical book and the origins of the citizens of both nations. To resolve the problem, she must travel into parts of her own country which seem strange to her, deal with an idiosyncratic witch, discover the truth about a prominent military leader, and deal with several other problems. One of the reasons I enjoy Marks' series is that, despite some superficial similarity to standard fantasy worlds, Shaftal has a distinct feel of its own, and the underlying magical theme - based on the elementals - gives it another interesting twist. In a feel dominated with cloned books, it's always pleasant to encounter some originality. 4/15/07\n\nA Distant Magic by Mary Jo Putney, Del Rey, 7/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-345-47691-3\n\nThe borderline between fantasy romance and romantic fantasy has essentially ceased to exist, or if it's still there, it's moving back and forth constantly. This new title could fall into either category although the author is more usually associated with the romance end of the spectrum. The general background is similar to the one Irene Radford used in her Guardians series, and in fact the family of magical protectors in this one are referred to as the Guardians as well. The protagonist, a young woman, is similarly gifted with magical powers, but hers are unreliable, inconsistent, and she avoids recourse to them unless there is not other alternative. While visiting continental Europe, she meets a handsome sea captain who subsequently abducts her, citing an incident in his youth when her father and brother abandoned him to pirates. Having nursed his resentment for years, he plans to make use of her as the instrument of his revenge by selling her into slavery. But beneath that rough exterior lies a gentler heart, particularly when he begins to feel affection for her. This actually feels more like an historical adventure story with a strong romantic element than a fantasy, and it does avoid the excesses that make some romance fiction overly sentimental. The author also seems to have a good feel for the setting of her story, both in time and space. 4/12/07\n\nThe Summoning by Lynne Ewing, Hyperion, 2007, $9.99, ISBN 978-142310342-4\n\nLynne Ewing has previously done two short, contemporary fantasy series for young readers. This is the opening volume of the third, Sisters of Isis, and it promises to be better than its predecessors. The title refers to three teenaged girls living in Washington, D.C., who discover one day that they are not just ordinary teens. A mysterious encounter reveals that the three of them are actually descendants of the ancient pharoahs of Egypt and that their heritage includes some magical powers that they were unaware of possessing. Abdel, who reveals all of this, is there to help them realize their potential. Predictably the central figure, Sudi, is skeptical of the whole thing, but events soon transpire to convince her of their reality. A demon possesses her boyfriend, and is using him as the means by which to strike at the threesome, arch enemies of evil. There's a hint of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Charmed, but Ewing has her own take on the supernatural and no doubt has more surprises waiting for us in subsequent volumes. This is lightweight, obviously, but it held my interest. 4/12/07\n\nThe Mathematics of Magic by L. Sprague de Camp & Fletcher Pratt, NESFA, 2007, $26, ISBN 978-1-886778-65-8\n\nThe first two novels in the Harold Shea series, The Incomplete Enchanter and The Castle of Iron, were among the very first adult fantasy novels I ever read, and I never understood why Pyramid failed to publish the third volume, Wall of Serpents, which I didn't get to read until almost twenty years later. All three of those novels are included here, although technically speaking only Castle is an actual novel. The other two consist of two novellas each, and de Camp added two short stories by himself during the 1990s, both of which appeared in original fantasy anthologies. Although the quality varies a bit from one story to the next - and \"The Wall of Serpents\" is a bit disappointing overall - these are still among my favorite fantasies.\n\nThe premise is that it is possible through abstruse mathematics to actually transport oneself into another world. And not just any other world, but one of the traveler's choosing from among a selection of infinite worlds. That means that if you want to visit a reality where Norse mythology is true, you can do so, or enter the world of The Faerie Queen or Orland Furioso or any other place you can imagine. These were good humored, inventive, adventurous fantasies in the style we now link to Unknown, the shortlived but legendary fantasy magazine of the 1940s, which is where several of these tales first appeared. It's a device that Jasper Fforde has revived in his own work, which is many ways much more sophisticated than these early stories, but as enjoyable as they are, for me they lack the simple charm that de Camp and Pratt managed to evoke.\n\nThere is some additional material including a reminiscence by de Camp, an introduction by Christopher Stasheff, an article by Jerry Pournelle, and a bibliography. As with all NESFA publications it's handsomely packaged and, at the price, one of the smartest things you can do with your money. 4/11/07\n\nThe Wanderer's Tale by David Bilsborough, Tor, 7/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-0-7653-1867-1\n\nI suspect that one of the reasons Tolkienesque fantasy remains popular is that readers enjoy being able to tell easily who is on the side of good and who is aligned with evil. When a dark lord sits in his castle raising an army of deformed creatures to carry out his bidding, it's a pretty good bet that he's not a nice but misunderstood guy. There are only a few writers who can carry this off without stumbling, although there have been a few like Stephen R. Donaldson who have managed to produce quite substantial stories in the same tradition. Too often the imitators churn out armies of orcs and magical duels but without evoking any of the real magical potential of such scenes. And unfortunately, new writers who attempt such an ambitious project are almost inevitably going to be compared to Tolkien, and come out on the short end of the comparison.\n\nA case in point is this first novel, volume one of the Annals of Lindormyn. Centuries before the present story gets underway, the Peladanes (good guys) stormed the castle of Drauglir (the bad guy) and his supernatural minions, defeating them and destroying the chief villain. Supposedly. Something has begun to stir again. Bizarre and nasty creatures have been seen prowling around for the first time in centuries. Mysterious events are transpiring in the mountains. Has ancient evil been somehow reborn and will the Peladanes have to fight a new war to preserve their freedom? You betcha. As you might guess from the title, most of the opening volume focuses on a single person traveling through this increasingly threatened landscape, introducing us to the peoples, places, and customs of Bilsborough's imagined world. Most of this is well told, though very derivative. If Tolkien had never written fantasy, this would be a very impressive work. As it stands, it's a pretty good story, pretty well done, and certainly interesting enough for me to read more in the series when they're available. But as I continue to read good imitations of Tolkien, I keep wondering if it would have been better if these authors were less directly influenced by a single tradition and more inclined to explore their own imagination. 4/11/07\n\nFantasy Magazine, Winter 2007, $5.95\n\nThis is the first issue I've seen of this new magazine, edited by Paul G. Tremblay and Sean Wallace, published by Wildside. There's the usual features - interviews and book reviews - and the physical appearance and artwork are all just fine, but it's the fiction that makes or breaks magazines like this, so let's take a look at what we've got. Almost all of the stories in this issue are by names unfamiliar to me. The lead story is \"Bear Lake\" by Margaret Ronald. It's one of those stories that is based on a single image or concept, examines it, perhaps draws a conclusion or makes a statement because of it, but doesn't actually reach a conclusion. When done well, as in \"The Drowned Giant\" by J.G. Ballard, the results can be excellent. When done poorly, the reader is left wondering what the author was trying to say. \"Bear Lake\" lies somewhere between the two extremes, an intriguing concept - the protagonist is a walking dead man involved in staving off a flood - written well but with an inconclusive ending that felt as though a scene was missing.\n\n\"The Dead Girl's Wedding March\" by Cat Rambo also involves a kind of zombie, but it has more of a fairy tale quality. Zuleika is one of the many dead living in a magically interred city beneath a seaport. A marriage proposal from a rat has momentous results. There's another talking animals, a crow, in Leslie Claire Walker's \"The Truth According to Margot Williams\", the story of a woman facing Alzheimer's and determined to die with her mind intact. Very good early on but this one strayed a bit too far toward sentimentality for my taste. \"Such a Lovely Shade of Green\" by Samantha Henderson also involves animals, insects actually. It's a bit of wish fulfillment fantasy about an abusive husband who tracks down his daughter and gets his just desserts. Not badly written, but you could see the ending coming a long way off, and the villain is so stereotypical that he wasn't real enough for me to enjoy his comeuppance.\n\n\"The Words the Rain Wrote\" by January Mortimer has some clever content. The setting is an alternate version of our world where it is possible to get addicted to Faerie. Nicely done up until the low key and inconclusive ending. \"A Garden in Hell\" by Richard Parks is one of the two best stories in the issue, a philosophical debate of sorts between a soul in Hell and a demon. Perhaps a bit long for its content, but up to the author's usual standards. Leah Bobet's \"Furnace Room Lullaby\" is an interesting quasi-ghost story and quite good as well. Amber Van Dyk's \"Disquiet\" and Alaya Dawn Johnson's \"Among Their Bright Eyes\" both do a very good job of evoking a mood, but again I felt as though the stories were truncated rather than concluded. The prose in Erzebet Yellowboy's \"At the Core\" was the most impressive, and he also had one of the strongest plots.\n\nMy overall impression is that, based on this issue anyway, the magazine takes itself a bit too seriously. The stories all tend toward the literary side and none of them have a particularly strong plot. Neither is there much variety in theme or literary style. If it happens to be the kind of voice you like to listen to, there's quite a bit here, but if you prefer more variation in your literary meals, you might be disappointed. There is a tendency in modern fantasy fiction (including SF and horror) to concentrate so completely on prose and sophisticated literary values that sometimes writers forget that their first obligation is to tell a good story. Either I've become an old fogey and have fallen completely out of step or most of the stories here, while technically excellent, fall short as entertainment. 4/11/07\n\nThe Man with the Golden Torc by Simon R. Green, Roc, 6/07, $23.95, ISBN 978-0-451-46145-2\n\nAs far as Im concerned, theres no one whos consistently more entertaining writing that subset of contemporary fantasy that involves the wizards and creatures secretly living among us than Simon R. Green. Ive enjoyed all of the books in the Nightside series and this new novel, which I suspect may be the first in another sequence, is even better, with its blend of humor and high adventure. The Droods are a family of magically empowered individuals whose secret duty is to guard you and I from the things that go thump in the night, or conjure in their basements, or whatever. But Eddie Drood  a nod to Charles Dickens  isnt your everyday sorcerer or clandestine warrior. And when hes nearly killed by a demonic dog that no one bothered to tell him about, hes understandably annoyed.\n\nHis day is going to get rapidly worse. First he learns that unprecedented, mysterious, and powerful attacks have been directed against the Droods recently. Second, his ongoing low level feud with other members of the family seems to be getting more serious, in part because of his unwillingness to conform to their usual standards of behavior. Then hes dispatched on a mission to Stonehenge that turns out to be more dangerous than expected, with hellhounds on his trail, and in the middle of it he discovers that his own family is determined to kill him. 4/7/07\n\nMagic Lost, Trouble Found by Lisa Shearin, Ace, 6/07, $7.99, ISBN 978-0-441-01505-4\n\nWhenever I see a first novel by a new fantasy writer, I always wonder if this is going to be someone who is going to do something entirely new with the genre. Usually Im disappointed. Once I realize that its going to be another variation of a familiar story, I wonder if this is going to be someone who can make the familiar seem fresh either by adding unusual twists, sparkling writing, or some other quality. Usually Im disappointed. But not always. This is one of the latter, a story that has a great deal of the feel of Fritz Leibers Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser stories, which is definitely a compliment.\n\nThe chief protagonist is Raine Benares, a sorceress rather than a thief, although she comes from a family tradition of thievery and her powers often amount to little more than parlor tricks. But she has a friend named Quentin Rand who IS a thief, a man with more skill than judgment. He decides to steal a magical artifact from a local necromancer, a man with considerable more power than Raine, and succeeds, but only after a fashion. The sorcerer and a great many other interested persons are interested in repossessing the amulet, which is the source of immense magical power. So Quentin turns to Raine for help in evading his pursuers, and that means theyre both on the run, aided at times by a young Elf spellsinger, chased by various enemies including a gaggle of goblins. And the longer Raine stays in proximity to the amulet, the more her own powers are increasing, and without training or time to reflect, she fears she may be losing control. Nicely done throughout. I actively enjoyed the characters and their banter, and although theres nothing to indicate that this is the first in a series, Id be very surprised if Raine isnt back for a new adventure a few months from now. Ill be looking forward to visiting her again. 4/6/07\n\nThe Traitor King by Todd Mitchell, Scholastic, 2007, $16.99, ISBN 978-0-439-82788-1\n\nDarren and Jackie Mananann are part of a fairly extensive family whose magical secrets they are just beginning to guess. When one of their uncles disappears mysteriously, they decide to investigate themselves, using information acquired in part from an equally mysterious woman, Gertrude. Almost by accident they find themselves in an alternate world where magic works, greeted by an impatient brownie who acts as their temporary tour guide. There they find themselves caught up in preparations for a magic war which only they may have the power to stop. Although the plot of this one resembles a good many adult novels, this one is definitely for younger readers. The simplified prose and story line just dont have enough weight to hold a more sophisticated readers interest, unlike other young adult fiction like the Harry Potter books or the work of Diana Wynne Jones. It should be fine for the age group toward which its directed.\n\nWhiskey and Water by Elizabeth Bear, 7/07, $14, ISBN 978-0-451-46149-0\n\nThe second novel of the Promethean Age resumes Matthew's story after a gap of seven years. Although his first adventure, Blood and Iron, ended with most of the people he valued either dying or proving themselves to be villains. The foremost of the latter is Jane Andraste, who sought to destroy the land of Faerie despite her daughter's partial fey heritage. Matthew has returned to our world where he endeavors to guard the city of New York from the darker side of magic and magical beings, although he is in many ways a broken man, worn out by his experiences and losses. Jane, however, has resumed her ambitious plans, and this time there may not be a power great enough to stop her. Their struggle becomes complicated, at least from Matthew's point of view, when he is framed for a murder he didn't commit and pursued by police who are convinced he is guilty. Bear's magical creation is more complex than the usual story of the interface between our world and the land of Faery. There are angels as well, and a kelpie stallion, and mysterious primal forces. A rather large cast of characters people this exotic landscape, and the narrative is so replete with detail that readers should be prepared not to let their attention wander, because they might well get lost. There's a lot going on, some of it subtle, some of it not. I prefer contemporary fantasy to most other forms, but I am usually put off by stories in which fairies and humans interact, but Bear brings a whole new level of detail to the subject and her magical creatures are an interesting mix of familiar and unfamiliar traits.\n\nRetribution by Steven Savile, Black Library, 2007, $7.99, ISBN 978-1-84416-293-2\n\nSavile brings his Von Carstein trilogy to a close with this blend of sword and sorcery and horror. The armies of civilization have managed to destroy two of the vampire lords, but the greatest of them all is still at work, Mannfred von Karstein. He has raised an army of the undead with which to attack his enemies who, already wearied from fighting the rest of his kind, seem incapable of resisting yet another wave of almost invulnerable enemies. As humans and dwarves seek to rally their forces, von Karstein moves to crush them. What ensues is a series of skirmishes, pitched battles, chases, encounters, escapes, and so forth, with more brutal violence than you can shake a stick at, although it has a comic book style unreality that robs it of some of its bite - no pun intended. This particular trilogy reminded me of the Ravenloft books that TSR (now Wizards of the Coast) published a few years back, the kind of story that puts the \"dark\" in \"dark fantasy\".\n\nBlade of Fire by Stuart Hill, Scholastic, 2007, $18.99, ISBN 978-0-439-84122-1\n\nThis is the second in the Icemark Chronicles, the first of which - The Cry of the Icemark - I haven't seen. The setting is a typical fantasy world, a beleaguered realm whose queen fears that the intermittent war with an external empire - very obviously patterned after Rome - will finally conquer her people. When the latest attack threatens to overwhelm her forces, she resorts to the mystical powers of certain children as well as an alliance with the Vampire Queen and, after extensive adventures, reversals, surprises, and battles, the allies eventually defeat the invaders and capture their leader. At times the novel reads more like an historical adventure than a fantasy, but that's not surprisingly given the patterning of the various cultures on ones from our own history. It's quite long for a young adult novel as well, perhaps an indirect legacy of the Harry Potter books. What does surprise me somewhat is the bloodthirstiness of the story which involves an unusually large number of violent deaths, including the arbitrary and brutal murder of the captured enemy general by the supposedly benevolent queen, who refuses to grant him a fair trial. I'm not sure I'd want to live in a land ruled by any of the major characters. The jumps back and forth between the older and younger characters are sometimes jarring as well and the tone is generally more that of an adult novel.\n\nThe Fire Within by Chris DLacey, Scholastic, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-439-67244-3\n\nThe fairly striking cover on this one is designed to fit with the artwork on the two sequels, but its really not appropriate for the opening volume of this trilogy, originally published in the United Kingdom. Readers expecting another Eragon are going to be surprised. When David moves in with the Pennykettles, he is captivated by young Lucys collection of clay models, which can become animate under certain circumstances. This is the beginning of his connection to the world of dragons, which will become much more dramatic in subsequent volumes, although in the first he only has to solve a relatively low key mystery. Which doesnt mean this isnt enjoyable, although a bit under-written for mature audiences. The author does more to deepen his characters than is usually the case in novels  particularly fantasy novels  aimed at younger teen readers, and there is considerable refinement and complexity to the plot. Its very light reading and goes quickly, but it should leave pleasant memories behind it.\n\nThe Cobra King of Kathmandu by P.B. Kerr, Orchard, 2007, $16.99, ISBN 978-0-439-670234\n\nI would love to find the equivalent of young adult SF like Winston juveniles or the YA novels of early Robert Heinlein and Andre Norton, but alas, there is very little of it published these days. The amount of YA and young reader fantasy is, however, overwhelming and quite a bit of it - like Philip Pullman, J.R. Rowling, and Diana Wynne Jones to name a few - has an obvious large audience among adult readers as well. Part of this is the appeal of fairy tales to all ages, of course, but part also reflects the shift in adult fantastic literature from SF to fantasy. P.B. Kerr is also Philip Kerr, who has written at least two good thrillers, one of them clearly SF, but he writes in a very different voice in this series - Children of the Lamp - of which this is the third. The two protagonists are twins and teens, but they are also descended from djinn or genies and as they reach adolescence, they begin to experience unusual powers. In their first two outings, they learned something about their history and the nature of the djinn, as well as meeting the ghost of an ancient Egyptian ruler and solved the mystery of a missing book of magical spells. This time the Gaunt twins are on a wild world tour to solve another mystery.\n\nAnother djinn, Dybbuk, needs their help to discover who poisoned a friend of his and they agree to help, but find themselves in hot water pretty quickly. They have trespassed on the domain of a cult of assassins, and now they're likely to become the next target for elimination. They are eventually captured by their enemies and must use all their wits to escape. This is a pretty light adventure story overall, and despite the violence, there's considerable humor as well. The prose is great, not condescending at all, and Kerr keeps the story moving at a breakneck pace. Nicely packaged as well, this book - and its predecessors - are as good as most recent adult fantasy.\n\nWarrior Angel by Margaret Weis & Lizz Weis, Avon, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-06-083325-1\n\nMargaret Weis, collaborating with her daughter, moves from high fantasy to paranormal romance with this, which is apparently intended to be the first in a series. The protagonist is an angel who has dedicated his life -- make that his afterlife -- to fighting the forces of evil. He is dispatched to Earth when a number of fallen angels begin operating there, specifically intending to protect a young woman from the advances of a charming man, who is actually one of the fallen. Not surprisingly, given the genre, they fall in love, although I'm not sure just how that would work given their respective natures.\n\nThere are some good things to be said about the book. There aren't any of the usual artificial, formulaic sex scenes. In fact, there's not much sex at all. There is also a welcome absence of vampires, shapechangers, and the other spear carriers of modern urban fantasy. Unfortunately, there is also a curious lack of action during the opening chapters that might have been tolerable if the characters had been more appealing or the prose scintillating. Since neither was the case, I had to plod onward from a sense of duty rather than enjoyment, and although things picked up eventually, the prose seems to get rougher as the book progresses. This was not my favorite book this week.\n\nChangeling by Yasmine Galenorn, Berkley, 6/07, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-425-21629-3\n\nThis is the second in a series that obviously owes a great deal to the television series, Charmed, since it involves three sisters, each with her own supernatural powers. They were introduced in Witchling and their debut was a pretty good one. They fall into the category of paranormal romance, although the romantic element is comparatively slight and the paranormal is central. One of the sisters is a witch, one a vampire, and one a shapechanger. Each has a flaw as well; the witch's spells aren't always reliable, the vampire is just getting used to her new way of...er, um...life, and the shapeshifter isn't always in control of her talent. It's the shapechanging that's the focus this time, because someone has been murdering the members of one such tribe, probably a demon or similar being commissioned by a rival clan. That should have been straightforward work for the sisters to solve, but unfortunately nothing is ever as easy as it appears, at least not in novels of the paranormal.\n\nEventually the sisters unravel a rather complicated political struggle. One of the chief demons, Shadow Wing, has subverted some of those supposedly loyal to his enemies, and he also commands at least some loyalty from the rival clan. There's some rescuing to be done, a mystery to be solved, a villain to be foiled, and much more. Although there are some pretty horrible things happening at the book, the tone is much lighter and there are even touches of humor to relieve the tension. This is definitely at the fantasy end of the fantasy-horror spectrum, because there is very little semblance between the world Galenorn has created and the one we presently live in, which doesn't mean to say that she doesn't make it feel real while we're immersed in it. I wasn't too impressed with the villain and this one, but I liked the characters just as in their first (and slightly better) book, and I'll be looking forward to the next one, Darkling, due out later this year.\n\nDepths of Madness by Erik Scott de Bie, Wizards of the Coast, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-7869-4314-2\n\nDe Bie, whose first novel Ghostwalker was an okay sword & sorcery adventure, kicks off a new subset o the Forgotten Realms shared universe with this, the first of the \"Dungeons\" series, with at least three to follow, all by different authors. The common theme, as you might expect, is dungeons and de Bie creates an interesting one as his setting. The primary character is Twilight, a talented thief, who finds herself in a mysterious dungeon with six strangers, none of whom know one another, including a sorcerer, a demon worshipper, a swordsman, and so forth. They quickly discover that the troll who guards them isn't the only bar to freedom; the dungeon itself seems alive, with passages and doorways changing to thwart their attempts to escape. The fact that none of them seems to like any of the other members of the party doesn't help either.\n\nI suspect that there are a lot of in-group references in this novel, which obviously draws heavily on Dungeons & Dragons, but paradoxically, by concentrating on the very circumscribed world of the dungeon and ignoring all of the political and social detail of the bulk of the Forgotten Realms novels, this actually has a considerably different feel and is more like mainstream sword & sorcery, what little of it still exists. There's also some pretty heavy violence and bloodthirstiness, which occasionally clashes with the light humor. It's considerably better than I expected and should draw an appreciative audience from outside the normal Wizards readership.\n\nSacrifice of the Widow by Lisa Smedman, Wizards of the Coast, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-7869-4250-3\n\nForge of the Mindslayers by Tim Waggoner, Wizards of the Coast, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-7869-4313-5\n\nAlthough Wizards of the Coast occasionally published novels that weren't game related when they were still TSR, they seem to have abandoned that tactic completely. The first of these two titles is part of the Forgotten Realms series, by far their largest subset, of which this is in turn a subset, the Lady Penitent trilogy, with all three volumes written by Lisa Smedman. Most of the author's previous work has been tie-ins as well, but she's one of the more reliable and entertaining of those specializing in such things. The opening volume of this trilogy has a slightly different feel than most of the related novels I've read and at times is quite well plotted, but the author overwhelms her story by introducing too many different characters too quickly, most of them with unpronounceable names, a device I find very irritating. People would not have names that were difficult to say, would they? So why introduce odd characters and spelling like Qilue and Q'arlynd and Iljrene? The plot involves a female warrior who abandoned her faith in a kind of demon goddess and enlisted among the forces that oppose her, but only to discover that her former deity has evolved into a super-god, capable of enslaving her and turning her against her friends. I'm a bit ambivalent about the book, because there were times when I was drawn into the story, but there were other times when it just didn't gell.\n\nThe Eberron series, based on another game system, has been added to the Wizards of the Coast book line comparatively recently. Tim Waggoner, author of some very good horror novels and a few other fantasies adds here his second adventure of Diran, an assassin who repudiated his former life to become a wandering priest, and subsequently encounters and overcomes a variety of magical enemies. Diran was introduced in Thieves of Blood, one of the best of the Eberron titles, and returns this time to battle another foe. Diran travels about with a group of friends, and his travels bring him to encounter with Asenka, a female warrior that reminded me a bit of Red Sonja. The travelers learn that someone has found an ancient magical artifact and is going to use it to raise an army. Diran may have given up his job as assassin, but he hasn't forsworn violence when it's called for, and he and his friends engage in predictable but entertaining steps to put down the menace. Diran is a kind of gentler, more thoughtful, but nonetheless formidable version of Conan and I look forward to his next adventure, Sea of Death - alas, not scheduled to appear until early next year.\n\nForbidden City by Alex Archer, Gold Eagle, 2007, $6.50, ISBN 978-0-373-62123-1\n\nAnnja Creed is the protagonist of the Rogue Angel adventure series of which is the fifth. Alex Archer is a house pseudonym used so far by Mel Odom and Victor Milan, with Odom writing this present volume. Annja is investigating a legend surrounding a site connected to the Chinese railroad workers in California when one of her co-workers attacks her, killing three other people in the process, and leaving her in possession of a belt that is connected to an ancient curse. Meanwhile in China a young woman named Kelly Swan, a formidable martial artist, discovers that her father has been murdered and that her own life is in danger. Eventually Creed and her mentor are in Shanghai and the two link up to battle off a small army of enemies, solve the mystery, and save the day. Swan turns out to be a professional assassin recruited by the CIA. Annja still has a bit of an edge; she found the sword of Joan of Arc back in volume one, a mystical weapon that appears in her hand only when she needs it, and she needs it a lot. This is essentially a men's adventure series, but it's much more inventive and interesting than the other franchises Gold Eagle has been publishing for years. Whether it can continue to be as fresh and interesting in the future remains to be seen, but Creed is relatively interesting character, and the low key rendition of Indiana Jones style adventure has so far proven to be very entertaining.\n\nThe Great White Wyrm by Peter Archer, Wizards of the Coast, 2007, $6.99, ISBN 978-0-7869-4260-2\n\nOver the years, the Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms shared universes of TSR, now Wizards of the Coast, have evolved, but only slightly, filling in details of their imaginary worlds and constructing an elaborate history but not making much effort to evolve the kind of stories set within them. In general they're somewhere between Tolkien and Howard, not as cute or literary as the former, usually not as brash or exciting as the latter. A few of the authors working in this milieu have gone on to bigger and better things; most have not. Archer, whose previously work has been confined to a collaboration, has taken on a rather ambitious project here, a fantastical transformation of the story of Moby Dick, although instead of a white whale it's a white dragon.\n\nAyshe is the only dwarf living in a human community. Like his neighbors he is appalled, frightened, and mystified when a flying white dragon attacks their village. Human strangers arrive shortly thereafter, and it is obvious that they know more than they are saying about the attack. A short time later, Ayshe finds himself serving aboard a ship crewed by elves, and a long string of adventures ensues, leading inevitably to their confrontation with the white dragon. Given its inspiration, the story that unfolds is appealing and occasionally inventive, but I was impatient for the final confrontation a good way before the author managed to get his characters there. I've never really understood why authors people their books with elves, fairies, dwarves, and such if they portray them as essentially human beings. Why not just make them human beings? Anyway, this was satisfying enough that I'll read Archer's next, but not so much that I'd suggest you run out and buy a copy.\n\nPirates of the Purple Dawn by Tony Abbott, Scholastic, 2007, $3.99, ISBN 978-0-439-90250-2\n\nFerno the Fire Dragon by Adam Blade, Scholastic, 2007, $4.99, ISBN 978-0-439-90651-2\n\nSepron the Sea Serpent by Adam Blade, Scholastic, 2007, $4.99, ISBN 978-0-439-90654-8\n\nI have a big stack of young adult titles sitting on my desk, most of them short enough - like these - to be read in about half an hour. The first of these has a nifty title and cover and is part of a series that I've seen a few of previously. I've lost track but this must be around number thirty. A pair of villainous pirates join forces and kidnap a princess who knows the location of a precious jewel. Her friends have to mount a rescue before she is forced to tell them. The story sounds like a good one, but this is written down to such a low reading level that it really doesn't have much appeal to an adult reader.\n\nThe other two titles are the first in another new series, Beast Quest, this one set in a kingdom where all of the creatures of legend have somehow been brought to life to devastate the countryside. \"Adam Blade\" is, I believe, a house pseudonym for Stephen Cole and Cherith Baldry respectively. Each book in the series apparently will feature a quest involving some kind of mythical beast, not limited to dragons based on the titles of the third and fourth. In each of these, one or more youths are pivotal in the struggle against a dangerous creature. In the first (Ferno is presumably a reference to Inferno) we are introduced to Tom, who sets off on a quest to defeat a fire breathing dragon. In the second, which I thought was considerably better written, Tom and his friend have to deal with a giant sea serpent that begins raiding along the shore. None of these will have much appeal for older audiences, but they seem likely to be successful with their target group.\n\nBehold the Eyes of Light by Geoff Geauterre, Twilight Times, 2004, $16.95, ISBN 1-933353-26-0\n\nCynnador by Patrick Welch, Twilight Times, 2003, $16.95, ISBN 1-933353-76-7\n\nThese are two more older titles recently sent me by this small press publisher. Both of these are fantasies, and it takes considerably more to get me excited about magical quests, stolen thrones, and the like than it does most other story lines. Both of these looked interesting because they seem to vary considerably from mainstream fantasy and, frankly, they were short and I'd just finished a fairly length and rather dry non-fiction book, so these seemed like they might be a pleasant contrast. Geauterre quickly accumulated two admittedly arbitrary strikes against him. For one thing, he mixed mystical fantasy with interplanetary travel, a blend I always have difficulty absorbing. Second, his protagonist is a feline humanoid, which I overdosed on some time back despite several fine novels using that premise including those by C.J. Cherryh and S. Andrew Swann. The protagonist reaches a mystical plane where she is taken under the wing of an elder race, and with their help she survives encounters with a wide variety of mythological creatures from human legends, which also jarred a bit. It was well enough written that I finished it, but I often found my attention wandering.\n\nThe second title was more predictable and less engaging, although Welch has done a good job of creating a fabulous city and peopling it with interesting characters. There is an overlap with science fiction here as well. Unfortunately, there were too many characters and a bit too much going on for such a short book, and I felt rushed at times, confused at times, and dissatisfied at times.\n\nDungeon: A Dungeon Too Many by Joann Sfar, Lewis Trondheim, & Manu Larcenet, NBM, 2007, $9.95, ISBN 978-1-56163-495-8\n\nNBM continues this series of graphic novels, originally published in French, which revolve around a small set of comical characters. There are two separate stories here, whose main characters include a dragon who won't eat meat and and his best friend, a duck. In the first, a student visits an immense dungeon, not a medieval torture chamber but a kind of magical amusement park for its clients, where each is matched to an appropriate quest. The dungeon challenges our hero's livelihood and humorous mayhem follows. The second and shorter piece involves a magic lamp with a single wish. Both stories are vividly drawn and colored, some of the best graphic novel art I've ever seen, fully up to the standard set by the earlier volumes. This is part of a series that appears about every six months, and they're pretty much my favorite series from this publisher.\n\nSeraphs by Faith Hunter, Roc, 5/07, $14, ISBN 978-0-451-46147-6\n\nThe sequel to Bloodring continues the adventures of Thorn St. Croix, a woman living in a post-apocalyptic world, but it's a metaphysical rather than nuclear apocalypse. There has been another ice age and in the aftermath, old magic has returned to the world, displacing technology, and bringing with it demons, fallen angels, magic, and semi-barbaric mayhem. Thorn has a close group of friends, but they may be of little use to her in her second adventure, which involves a quest to rescue a fallen angel imprisoned by the minions of hell. It looks like a straightforward mission, but it is actually an elaborate trap and it is Thorn who is the target of the operation. There were a couple of occasions where I had trouble following what was going on, primarily because I had some minor trouble differentiating among some of the characters. The setting and story more than make up for any shortcomings. Hunter has created an interesting variation of Christian mythology and her protagonist has some original tweaks. Sword and sorcery with enough new twists to excite even the most jaded reader.\n\nCoyote Dreams by C.E. Murphy, Luna, 5/07, $14.95, ISBN 978-0-373-80272-2\n\nFantasy fans should not be ignoring the Harlequin line of fantastic romances published under the Luna imprint. For one thing, several well known fantasy writers have contributed titles, like Mercedes Lackey, Judith Tarr, and Catherine Asaro. Additionally, writers more generally associated with romance fiction have contributed several novels that would not be out of place in the fantasy lines of other publishers, a few of them quite good ones. One of the latter is C.E. Murphy, whose Walkers Papers series - this is the third - are urban fantasies with a strong female protagonist, a police officer who also has a talent for the magical. She has already saved the world in a previous adventure, but this time her goal is a more modest one. Other members of the police form have been falling into a kind of magical sleep, and the number of the afflicted is growing quickly.\n\nWalker has problems of her own. Her usual connection to the spirit world doesn't seem to be working and she's been experiencing strange and disturbing dreams. There's also the matter of her handsome boss, to whom she is increasingly drawn. There are demonic forces at work, obviously, but just which ones and what is their ultimate purpose? You'll have to read the book to find out. This might be in the romance section of your bookstore, but it's a fast moving, pleasantly straightforward urban fantasy\n\nDaughter of Independence by Simon Brown, DAW, 2007, $7.99, ISBN 978-0-7564-0430-7\n\nVolume three of the Chronicles of Kydan. There's a slightly different feel to this series despite the standard fantasy setting. The land of Kydan is a comparatively recent settlement which is slowly building a commercial and political infrastructure and emerging as a significant national entity in a world dominated by powerful empires. The leaders of Kydan are particularly concerned about the growing avariciousness of the Hamilayan Empire, whose repressive ruler uses sorcery to secure her reign, and might be considering turning her attention to the independent realm across the sea. The evil empress is a bit of a caricature, but the other characters are well drawn and there's certainly no dearth of conflict. An odd blend of political thriller and sword and sorcery.\n\nThe Music of Razors by Cameron Rogers, Del Rey, 5/07, $13.95, ISBN 978-0-345-49319-4\n\nFirst novels have a unique kind of suspense to them; will this be just another midlist writer, something so awful that it's painful to read, or someone whose next book I'll be watching for. You can't always tell by the subject matter because some of my favorite writers had first novels that might ordinarily not have appealed to me at all. Repressed teenaged girl with psychic powers takes revenge on her classmates, for example, would never have led me to look forward to Stephen King's Carrie. So I read the first few chapters of this new novel with some anxiety. To my immense surprise and continuing pleasure, it is easily one of the best debut novels I've encountered, thoroughly gripping even though it dealt with subject matter that usually doesn't interest me. Henry Lockrose was a promising medical student during the 19th Century who was caught in the war between Heaven and Hell and ended up as an effectively immortal minion, collected the souls of the innocent. His efforts to gather the essence of Walter Witherspoon go awry thanks to the intervention of an apparently monstrous creature who merges with Walter, robbing Henry of his prey, and this combined new being then sets about protecting Walter's sister. Full of original twists and turns, with a highly charged atmosphere, and crisp, intelligent prose. This was originally published by Penguin in the UK way back in 2001 and I'm very surprised that I hadn't heard of it before now.\n\nHarvest of Changelings by Warren Rochelle, Golden Gryphon, 5/07, $24.95, ISBN 978-1-930846-46-3\n\nI've never actually understood the interest in fairies in fantasy. The kind that fly around and sprinkle magic dust are okay, but the ones who are simply human beings who live in an alternate dimension where they might be immortal and certainly have magic strike me as, frankly, just human beings who live in an alternate dimension with very long lives and magic. As a consequence, I had some difficulty immersing myself in this one, even though the main focus is actually the young son of a librarian whose wife was from Faerie. Their half blood son begins to display unusual attributes as he approaches adolescence, and his father realizes that unless he can draw upon the power of Faerie to help him, the boy will die. The viewpoint jumps around a lot, a bit too much for my taste, and even though the prose is solid and the characters vivid, I just wasn't able to identify with their problems.\n\nAcacia: The War with the Mein by David Anthony Durham, Doubleday, 6/07, $26.95, ISBN 978-0-385-50606-9\n\nAlthough I haven't read any of this author's previous work, which includes two novels about the plight of minorities in 19th Century America plus an historical about Hannibal and his war against Rome, I do know that they're well regarded, and I started this - the first in a high fantasy series - with more than the usual curiosity about first authors. Durham makes no attempt to reinvent the genre. His setting and the basics of his plot are very familiar. Acacia is a relatively peaceful, world spanning empire in some alternate reality, ruled over by a reasonably benevolent man who nonetheless has turned a blind eye to some of the more unsavory aspects of his realm, whose economy is based in part on the drug and slave trade. The conflict starts when an agent of a remote people delivers a fatal wound just as a series of widespread attacks causes chaos and dissension throughout Acacia. Dying, the ruler makes desperate arrangements to secure his four children, who will presumably be the multiple protagonists for the balance of the series as they seek to restore the throne, and perhaps address some of the tolerated sins in the process.\n\nAlthough there is warfare throughout most of the novel, the battle scenes seem almost to be place markers, not inherently interesting in themselves but only as they illustrate the backdrop for the true tension, which is among the various characters, including rivalries and differences of opinion among the four Arakan children. For obvious reasons, a variety of individuals and interest groups are determined to influence the future government of Acacia, including deciding who will sit on the throne, and the complexities and progress of that process are far too complex to summarize here.
