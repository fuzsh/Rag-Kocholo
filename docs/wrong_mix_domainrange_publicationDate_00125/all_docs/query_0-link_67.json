        "text": "Cloud Atlas\n\nBy David Mitchell,\n\nFrom my list on thrillers that are also literary novels.\n\nBy Richard Cox Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always looked at the world with a sense of wonder. As a child, I was drawn to the magical and the fantastical, but a budding fascination with the scientific method eventually led me to discover the beauty and wonder of the natural world. I assumed science fiction would scratch that itch, but too many genre novels left me feeling empty, like they were missing something essential—what it feels like to be human. Novels that combine a wonder of the world with an intimate concern for character hit just the right spot for me. Maybe they will for you as well.\n\nRichard's book list on thrillers that are also literary novels\n\nWhy did Richard love this book?\n\nI love this book for its Matroyska doll-style structure: The first five sections tell stories in different periods— from the mid-19th century to the 22nd—loosely connected by repeating characters and media, each ending abruptly and without resolution. The sixth section, set in the 24th century, is the spine of the novel, told in its entirety. Then Mitchell revisits the time periods in reverse chronological order, resolving each story, ending where we began in the mid-19th century.\n\nIt was a highly satisfying experience that changed my view of how a story could be told. It is widely considered one of the finest novels of the 21st century. It covers ideas I would normally balk at, like reincarnation and the existence of eternal consciousness. Still, the storytelling is so powerful that it all came across as believable to me. I loved the way Mitchell demonstrated how an idea in one time period…\n\nBy David Mitchell,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n12 authors picked Cloud Atlas as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSix lives. One amazing adventure. The audio publication of one of the most highly acclaimed novels of 2004. 'Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies...' A reluctant voyager crossing the Pacific in 1850; a disinherited composer blagging a precarious livelihood in between-the-wars Belgium; a high-minded journalist in Governor Reagan's California; a vanity publisher fleeing his gangland creditors; a genetically modified 'dinery server' on death-row; and Zachry, a young Pacific Islander witnessing the nightfall of science and civilisation - the narrators of CLOUD ATLAS hear each other's echoes down the corridor of history, and their destinies are changed in ways great…\n\nPreview\n\nStarve Acre\n\nBy Andrew Michael Hurley,\n\nFrom my list on the dark delights of folk horror.\n\nBy Stephanie Ellis Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up in an isolated rural pub in England. My love of folk horror was born of a strong nostalgia for that time and it has fed into both my writing and my reading. I understood isolation, small communities, the effect of strangers, as well as the sense of ‘otherness’ in the atmosphere of the countryside – the calm before the storm, the liminal twilight. It also meant that I could tell when a writer had captured the ‘essence’ of folk horror. When the author weaves a story between the landscape and man, blends traditions and mythology – they take me to that place I know.\n\nStephanie's book list on the dark delights of folk horror\n\nWhy did Stephanie love this book?\n\nI have a real thing about needing the setting to be pretty much a character in itself in the folk horror I read.\n\nFor me, it is that which brings out the atmosphere, the sense of otherworldliness, critical to such stories. Starve Acre, a haunting tragedy, set in bleak moorland offers no rural idyll. The desolate setting perfectly mirrors the disintegrating marriage of a couple who are trying come to terms with the loss of their young son.\n\nWhilst the wife turns to the spirit world, the husband researches a legend, uncovering the sinister story of the demonic Jack Grey as he does so. Bringing the legend to life and turning it into delusion, culminates in one of the most disturbing final scenes I’ve come across, certainly gave me chills.\n\nBy Andrew Michael Hurley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Starve Acre as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe worst thing possible has happened. Richard and Juliette Willoughby's son, Ewan, has died suddenly at the age of five. Starve Acre, their house by the moors, was to be full of life, but is now a haunted place.\n\nJuliette, convinced Ewan still lives there in some form, seeks the help of the Beacons, a seemingly benevolent group of occultists. Richard, to try and keep the boy out of his mind, has turned his attention to the field opposite the house, where he patiently digs the barren dirt in search of a legendary oak tree.\n\nStarve Acre is a devastating…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again\n\nBy M. John Harrison,\n\nFrom my list on fantasy whose location is the heart of the story.\n\nBy Neil Williamson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the sort of writer who constantly asks “what kind of story could I set here?” A quiet copse, a busy mall, a shabby wedding venue, all locations have their own stories to tell in addition to those of the characters who inhabit them. Stories work best when the location is the pivot around which everything else happens. This is doubly true for secondary world fantasy because, when you’re creating a world, you don’t just tease the story out of its locations—you can weave it into the fabric of the place. Which is how I created the world of Queen Of Clouds, down to its very motes.\n\nNeil's book list on fantasy whose location is the heart of the story\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nThe setting of this masterful story is contemporary London, but one dominated by water: rain, rivers, canal boats, ponds. As the novel progresses, the characters’ only partially successful attempts to connect feel hampered by the decreasing definition of the boundaries between land and water. A sense of hopeless inevitability pervades every page, that in the world of this drowning London something has changed. Something irreversible.\n\nBy M. John Harrison,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n*WINNER OF THE GOLDSMITHS PRIZE 2020*\n\n*A New Statesman Book of the Year*\n\n'A mesmerising, mysterious book . . .

It happened unexpectedly, but once I started writing I found it impossible to stop and have had twenty-eight novels published so far. Fortunately I found a publisher within weeks of completing my first novel, which was shortlisted for several major awards. Currently I am writing the 20th novel in my Geraldine Steel detective series, which has sold over a million copies in the UK alone. As well as writing detective novels, I also support up and coming crime writers as chair of judges for the Crime Writers Association’s Debut Dagger Award.\n\nLeigh's book list on wanting to read about murder\n\nWhy did Leigh love this book?\n\nMervyn Peake’s writing is unusual. In Gormenghast he creates a bizarre world of weird hierarchical rituals, peopled by eccentric characters, each one singular in a different way. What really brings this novel to life is Peake’s wonderfully rich prose, as he describes the destruction of an ancient social structure.\n\nBy Mervyn Peake,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Gormenghast as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nEnter the world of Gormenghast...the vast crumbling castle to which the seventy-seventh Earl, Titus Groan, is Lord and heir. Gothic labyrinth of roofs and turrets, cloisters and corridors, stairwells and dungeons, it is also the cobwebbed kingdom of Byzantine government and age-old rituals, a world primed to implode beneath the weight of centuries of intrigue, treachery, manipulation and murder.\n\nGormenghast is more than a sequel to Titus Groan - it is an enrichment and deepening of that book.The fertility of incident, character and rich atmosphere combine in a tour de force that ranks as one of the twentieth century's most…\n\nPreview\n\nHarrow County Omnibus Volume 1\n\nBy Cullen Bunn, Tyler Crook (illustrator), Carla McNeil (illustrator) , Hannah Lavender (illustrator) , Jenn Lee (illustrator)\n\nFrom my list on horror I read again and again and again.\n\nBy Mark Fearing Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nOne of the gifts of the horror genre is that the stories use metaphor to examine human behaviors that defy understanding. My favorite horror novels, novellas, and short stories can be read again and again. While my Feral graphic novel series is for middle school readers, I wanted to provide grey areas, perhaps more than the editor always liked! I wanted the adventure, the scares, the questions, the uncertainty that would let the small town of Feral take on a larger-than-life presence for a reader and encourage revisiting it whenever the mood strikes. It's almost pleasant, the rhythm, the anticipation. A little unnerving too.\n\nMark's book list on horror I read again and again and again\n\nWhy did Mark love this book?\n\nThis is the only graphic novel/comic book on my list and it goes above and beyond in art and story.\n\nI have enjoyed reading the Harrow County stories many times. I prefer the collected edition where you can take your time and read comic issues 1-16 of Darkhorse Comics Harrow County. The artwork pulls you in, and the story is filled with zippy turns and good dialogue.\n\nIt pulls from many of the books I've mentioned in building an early American horror story that heads off in multiple directions. I can smell the grass and trees, hear the click-clack of the horse-pulled carts, and taste autumn in the air while reading these books.\n\nA topic for another time would be examining the different experiences when reading a graphic novel compared to a novel. The strengths and weaknesses, what exactly the illustrations add, but for a horror fan who has never…\n\nBy Cullen Bunn, Tyler Crook (illustrator), Carla McNeil (illustrator) , Hannah Lavender (illustrator) , Jenn Lee (illustrator)\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Harrow County Omnibus Volume 1 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first half of the highly acclaimed, Eisner-nominated horror fantasy tale, collected in a value-priced omnibus.\n\nEmmy always knew that the woods surrounding her home crawled with ghosts and monsters. But on the eve of her eighteenth birthday, she learns that she is connected to these creatures--and to the land itself--in a way she never imagined.\n\nCollects issues 1-16 of Harrow County.\n\nPreview\n\nScary Stories to Tell in the Dark\n\nBy Alvin Schwartz, Brett Helquist (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on morbidly curious kids and their adults.\n\nBy Bryan L. Young Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a nerd for the morbid for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, I tore through all the books on the shelves in my house, whether they were appropriate for my age group or not. I started tearing into Stephen King books at 8 or so. I remember vividly copying language out of Christine when I was about 10 on the playground and getting in a lot of trouble for it. But I turned out okay. I really do believe that kids have a fascination for things above their age range, and adults enjoy it, too, and I still love all of these.\n\nBryan's book list on morbidly curious kids and their adults\n\nWhy did Bryan love this book?\n\nThis is another book that really hit me right between the eyes as a kid, and revisiting it with my kids as an adult, it’s nothing short of just creepy weirdness.\n\nGuillermo Del Toro once said that kids' stories should be frightening, and this definitely fits the bill. The best part about it is how short the stories are, too, so I was able to break it up with my kid into a number of sittings.\n\nBy Alvin Schwartz, Brett Helquist (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nScary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a classic collection of chillingly scary tales, in which Alvin Schwartz offers up some of the most alarming tales of horror, dark revenge, and supernatural events of all time, complemented in this paperback edition by spine-tingling illustrations by renowned artist Brett Helquist. Walking corpses, dancing bones, knife-wielding madmen, and narrow escapes from death-they're all here in this chilling collection of ghost stories. Make sure you read these books with the light ON!\n\nPreview\n\nThe Penguin Book of Vampire Stories\n\nBy Various,\n\nFrom my list on contemporary paranormal fantasy that span time.\n\nBy Rae Lori Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a huge fan of vampires, werewolves, elves, fairies, and all sorts of supernatural-themed creatures since I can remember. In addition, I grew up on sci-fi and fantasy movies and novels, which inspired me to pen my first short story at ten years old and send it in for publication. Since then, I’ve enjoyed creating art and writing stories that feature fantastical characters and creatures in extraordinary worlds having adventures. Though I have had two book series and numerous short stories published, I have many more stories and novels in the vault that I can’t wait to share with my readers.\n\nRae's book list on contemporary paranormal fantasy that span time\n\nWhy did Rae love this book?\n\nThis anthology holds a special place in my heart! Like most anthologies, my enjoyment varies with each story, but I love the variety of works published from the 1800s to the 1980s. In addition, it introduced me to John Polidori, a.k.a the father of vampire fiction, who I incorporated into my series as a family member to one of my characters.\n\nOf particular interest is the story \"Bite-Me-Not\" or \"Fleur de Feu\" by Tanith Lee, which is one of those stories that linger like a wistful, haunting dream that begs your return to its waiting arms. I am in awe of the lyrical prose, the dark yet beautiful characters, and the overall presentation. Though many of the other stories aren’t as engaging as this, I still love losing myself in all the vampire stories across the centuries and how the written word has changed with each take on my fave…\n\nBy Various,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThey're lurking under the cover of darkness and between the covers of this book. Here, in all their horror and all their glory, are the great vampires of literature: male and female, invisible and metamorphic, doomed and daring.\n\nTheir skin deathly pale, their nails curved like claws, their fangs sharpened for the attack, they are gathered for the kill and for the chill, brought frighteningly to life by Bram Stoker, Fritz Leiber, Richard Matheson, Robert Bloch, Charles L. Grant, Tanith Lee, and other masters of the macabre. Careful they are all crafty enough to steal their way into your imagination…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Ghost of Thomas Kempe\n\nBy Penelope Lively,\n\nWhy did Griselda love this book?\n\nWhat I love about the ghost story genre is how it can lend itself to comedy as well as spookiness. Here the plight of poor James, moving to a new house only to find himself seized on as Apprentice to ghostly 17th century apothecary Thomas Kempe, is irresistibly funny. No one will believe it’s not him scrawling advertisements for ‘Sorcerie, Astrologie, Geomancie, Alchemie, Recoverie of Goodes Loste and Physicke’ on notice boards outside his house and all over the village. Lively’s accurate use of 17th century English heightens both the humour and historical realism in this beautifully written book.\n\nBy Penelope Lively,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Ghost of Thomas Kempe as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe classic ghost story from Penelope Lively, one of the modern greats of British fiction for adults and children alike.\n\nJames is fed up. His family has moved to a new cottage - with grounds that are great for excavations, and trees that are perfect for climbing - and stuff is happening. Stuff that is normally the kind of thing he does. And he's getting blamed for it. But it's not him who's writing strange things on shopping lists and fences. It's not him who smashes bottles and pours tea in the Vicar's lap. It's a ghost - honestly. Thomas…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Bewitching of Aveline Jones\n\nBy Phil Hickes, Keith Robinson (illustrator),\n\nWhy did Griselda love this book?\n\nMore of a supernatural mystery than a ghost story perhaps, but since the sinister magic that besets 13-year-old Aveline arises from a witch long buried in the cold, dark side of the churchyard, this fast-paced, imaginative tale qualifies as both. Particularly striking is that you can read it as a simple, scary ghost story – or as an unnerving portrait of someone with a narcissistic personality, alternating charm, menaces, and pathos to unsettle Aveline and bring her under her spell. Brrrr.\n\nBy Phil Hickes, Keith Robinson (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Bewitching of Aveline Jones as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTurn on your torches and join Aveline Jones!\n\nAveline is thrilled when she discovers that the holiday cottage her mum has rented for the summer is beside a stone circle. Thousands of years old, the local villagers refer to the ancient structure as the Witch Stones, and Aveline cannot wait to learn more about them.\n\nThen Aveline meets Hazel. Impossibly cool, mysterious yet friendly, Aveline soon falls under Hazel's spell. In fact, Hazel is quite unlike anyone Aveline has ever met before, but she can't work out why.
