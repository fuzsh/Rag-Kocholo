Because she was unapologetic about herself as a woman and a writer, and sought artistically to find a voice, a uniquely feminine voice, for her internal life—braving all scoffers, everyone who insisted a woman was less-than. “The way she had painted her house was like pulling the dream life into the outside world—which of course is also what the writer and the artist does…” A Cafe In Space: The Anais Nin Literary Journal, Anthology 2003-2018, Sky Blue Press.\n\nBOOKS WE HOLD IN OUR HANDS COME ALIVE IN OUR HEARTS (essay) A meditation on being a book lover, a Christmas piece for the Los Angeles Times.

We discover that we too are riding on the back of this out of control horse called History....\" Winter/Spring 2017 issue.\n\nOUR NEXT CHAPTER: What One Author Learned From Her Mother’s Struggle With Dementia (essay) in Real Simple Magazine. \"I spent five years taking care of my mother as she succumbed to dementia. Real Simple asked me to write about it, the way our relationship changed during those years. For all the grief, something surprising also happened that I never would have known had I not entered the thick of it.\" November 2017 issue.\n\n“Poems in November” and “Weeping in the Rothko Chapel” (poems) in Only Light Can Do That: 100 Post-election Poems, Stories and Essays, The Rattling Wall and PEN Center USA, 2017.\n\nThe Russian Soul, Janet Fitch on Eugene Vodolazkin (essay) in Los Angeles Review of Books, Feb. 11, 2016.\n\n“All But Dissertation” (short story) in Southern California Review VIII, 2015.\n\n“A Shrine for Unbelievers” (early chapter for my novel Paint It Black) in Black Clock 18, edited by Steve Erickson, designed by Ophelia Chong, Black Clock, 2014.\n\nForward to No Stopping Train, a novel by Les Plesko, Soft Skull Press, 2014.
