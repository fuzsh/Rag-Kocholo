        "text": "Torres History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nSpain\n\nNoble surnames, such as Torres, evoke images of the ancient homeland of the Spanish people. Torres is the plural of \"torre\" meaning \"tower\" and is the 11th most common surname in Spain.\n\nIn Spain, hereditary surnames were adopted according to fairly general rules and during the late Middle Ages, names that were derived from localities became increasingly widespread. Local names originally denoted the proprietorship of the village or estate. The Torres family originally lived in the place named Torres. There are many towns and villages in Spain that are named Torres, but the most famous are in the provinces of Andalucia, Oviedo in the Principality of Asturias, Burgos in Castilla-Leon, Lerida in Catalonia, Zaragoza in Aragon, and Navarra. The place-name is of Latin origin and it emerged during the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Torres family\n\nThe surname Torres was first found in Castile, where the name originated in Visigothic times.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Torres family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Torres research.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 5\n\nTorres Settlers in West Indies in the 18th Century\n\nDavid Torres, who landed in Jamaica in 1740-1741 4\n\nReins Torres, who arrived in Jamaica in 1743-1744 4\n\nRema Torres, who landed in Jamaica in 1743 4\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Torres (post 1700) +\n\nJaime Torres, Chilean founder of Bodegas Torres, a historical wine growing company in 1870\n\nElena Torres Cuéllar (1893-1970), leading Mexican revolutionary, feminist, progressive educator and writer; she founded the first Montessori school in Mexico\n\nIsabel Torres (1969-2022), Spanish television and radio presenter, talk show host and actress and LGBT rights activist\n\nLeopoldo Torres Boursault (1941-2021), Spanish jurist and politician, who served as a Deputy and lawyer as Attorney General\n\nFernando José Torres Sanz (b. 1984), Spanish footballer, nicknamed \"The Kid\"\n\nJoaquín Torres Garcia (1874-1949), Uruguayan artist and art theorist\n\nJulio Romero de Torres (1874-1930), Spanish artist\n\nHernán Martínez Torres (1942-2023), Colombian chemical engineer and politician, Minister of Mines and Energy (2006-2010)\n\nRamón Enrique Torres Guzmán (1952-2023), Puerto Rican reporter, journalist, and news anchor of Informe 79 from Mega TV Puerto Rico\n\nJuan Alfredo Torres González (1935-2022), Mexican footballer who played as a forward and represented the Mexico national team in the 1954 FIFA World Cup\n\n...
