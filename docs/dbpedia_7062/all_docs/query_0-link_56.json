        "text": "Registration and Counseling\n\nWelcome to the Sierra Linda Registration and Counseling Department web page. We are here to serve students, parents, and staff. Our main goal is to help students successfully navigate their high school years and prepare for a seamless transition to their post high school plans.\n\nThroughout all four years, the counselors will engage students in a counseling program centered around the student’s Education Career Action Plan (ECAP). There will be multiple presentations and events throughout the year for each grade level.\n\nThe counseling staff commits to meeting the students’ needs in academics, personal/social well-being, and career and college readiness. Open communication and collaboration is a vital component for successful and positive school experiences, so we encourage parents and students to communicate with teachers, counselors, and administrators regarding questions, concerns, and good news.\n\nFor college scholarship information, please visit our Scholarship page."
