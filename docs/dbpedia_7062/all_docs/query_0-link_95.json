        "text": "Jamaican 400m hurdles champion Rushell Clayton has revealed the deep disappointment she felt after failing to secure a medal at the Paris Olympics, despite entering the Games as one of the favorites. Clayton, a two-time World Championship bronze medalist, had been in stellar form leading up to the event, clocking a lifetime best of 52.51 at the Jamaica National Championships in June. However, in the final in Paris, despite running her second-best time of the season—52.68—she finished fifth in a race dominated by American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, who shattered her own world record with a time of 50.37.\n\nThe final was filled with incredible performances, as McLaughlin-Levrone's teammate Anna Cockrell ran a massive personal best of 51.87 to claim the silver medal. Meanwhile, the Netherlands' Femke Bol, who had been expected to challenge for the gold, finished third in 52.15, leaving Clayton just outside the medal positions.\n\nMere days following the race, Clayton took to Instagram to share her emotions, revealing that she shed tears of disappointment after coming up short in her quest for an Olympic medal. \"It would be a lie to say that I am not sad walking away from the Olympic Games without a medal. (Mi bawl fi couple days),\" Clayton admitted, expressing the depth of her feelings after the race.\n\nDespite the disappointment, Clayton expressed gratitude for her performance and the journey she has been on this season. \"I’m extremely grateful and thankful that I was able to run three solid races which is inclusive of my second and third fastest times ever. I ran that final with pure confidence and a big heart yet I fell short,\" she said.\n\nClayton reflected on how this year has been the best of her career, even as she dealt with the heartbreak of missing out on an Olympic podium finish. \"It’s kinda crazy because I’ve been having the best year of my career,\" she wrote. \"It was my utmost pleasure representing team Jamaica on the biggest stage ever.\"\n\nHowever, she remains optimistic and determined to push forward, noting that with the hurt will also come happiness, and that she will continue to trust in the journey ahead. \"If the hurt comes, so will happiness. I will forever exercise patience knowing that the Lord has my back always,\" she declared.\n\nAs she looks ahead to the rest of the season, Clayton expressed her appreciation for the support she has received from her fans and vowed to keep striving towards her goals. \"Shout out to all y’all who sent me encouragement and love, it was felt and appreciated. I still got a hella races before the season ends and crazy goals to achieve. See you in a few days.\"\n\nClayton is now set to compete at the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne on August 22, where she will look to continue her impressive season and potentially add another highlight to what has already been a remarkable year.\n\nGrenada’s athletes to the Paris Olympic Games are set to be feted with much pomp and pageantry when they return home over the weekend, following their credible performance at the recently-concluded global multi-sport showpiece.\n\nThe six-member team comprising Kirani James, Lindon Victor, Anderson Peters, Halle Hazzard, Tilly Collymore and Zachary Gresham will be celebrated for their efforts in track and field and in the pool, as they gave Grenada much to be proud of.\n\nVictor’s decathlon bronze, as well as Peters javelin bronze represents the Spice Isle’s highest-ever medal haul at an Olympic Games.\n\nJames, the island’s most decorated athlete, just missed out on a medal in the men’s 400m, as he placed fifth.\n\nIn a press release issued on Wednesday, the Government of Grenada announced that ceremonies will take place on Saturday August 17 and Sunday, August 18.\n\nPeters, James and Victor will arrive on Saturday.\n\n“The activities have been put in place to celebrate athletes who have brought glory and honour to our land,” said Acting Minister of Sports Delma Thomas.\n\n“Let’s get together and be part of the grandest welcome ever, as we celebrate Grenadian resilience and excellence,” she added, while encouraging citizens throughout Grenada to organize in their various communities to participate, especially in the events on Sunday.\n\nThe athletes will be greeted by government officials, sport associations’ executives and family members, while Grenadians are invited to join the greeting party outside of the airport at 2:00pm. The weekend’s activities will also include a national motorcade on Sunday, August 18, which begins at Morne Rouge and a recognition rally at the Playing field in Victor’s home parish La Sagesse.\n\nThomas also hinted at some major announcements regarding the development of sports that will be made at the La Sagesse rally. Packages to honour all the Olympians will also be unveiled in a special address by Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell."
