        "text": "Fernando Torres, born in Madrid in 1984, is a former Spanish footballer, World Champion and two-time European Champion with the Spanish national team, in addition to national and international titles with several clubs. His career has been especially linked to Atlético de Madrid, where he was coached as a child in the lower categories before making his debut at the age of 17 in the first team.\n\nAs well as being an outstanding sportsman, Fernando Torres is characterized by his commitment, sacrifice, effort and companionship, values that he has often shown both on and off the field. The ability to get the best out of himself and his teammates in moments of pressure and competing at the highest level make him an authoritative voice leading top-performing teams.\n\nIn 2019, after an 18-year career and one season with the Japanese club Sagan Tosu, Fernando Torres announced his retirement as a footballer. Before that, \"El Niño Torres\", as he is known, had rejoined the club of his life, Atlético de Madrid, eight years after his departure. During this second stint at the Atlético de Madrid club they won the 2017/18 Europa League and were second in the Spanish National League. Whilst there he also participated in memorable moments for the club's fans, such as the farewell to the Vicente Calderón stadium. It was at the British club Chelsea, however, where he reached the top of European soccer winning the Champions League in the 2011-2012 season. There he also won his first Europa League in the 2012-13 season.\n\nBut the highlight of Fernando Torres' soccer career was when he played with the Spanish National team, making history by being a member of the winning team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Two years earlier, the same National Team also won the European Championship by beating Germany in the final, where Fernando Torres scored. Two years after South Africa, Spain completed the success with the second consecutive European Championship title. In addition, Torres was awarded the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer.\n\nFernando Torres also played at Liverpool FC, becoming the team's top scorer for two of its seasons. At the \"Reds\" he achieved great recognition on an individual level: FIFA included him in its 2008 and 2009 FIFPro World11 and he won the Bronze Ball behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi in the voting for the best world player of 2008.\n\nFernando Torres also received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport in Oviedo in 2010 as a member of the Spanish National Team."
