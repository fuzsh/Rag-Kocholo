        "text": "Edmundo \"Eddie\" Diaz is a main character on 9-1-1 who works as a firefighter at Station 118 of the Los Angeles Fire Department and is the father of Christopher Diaz. He debuts in the first episode of the second season of 9-1-1 and is portrayed by Ryan Guzman.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nEddie was born to a Swedish mother and a Mexican father[1] in El Paso, Texas and has two sisters - Sophia and Adriana.[2] His paternal grandmother, Isabel Diaz, and aunt, Josephina Diaz, live in Los Angeles and helped Eddie out with Christopher in Season 2. Eddie is very close to the both of them, particularly to his grandmother. He is also very close to his aunt, and she has tried to set him up on dates in \"Performance Anxiety\". Eddie has a strained relationship with his parents, Ramon and Helena Diaz, largely due to their doubting his ability to raise Christopher, and their hostility towards Shannon.\n\nEddie met his wife, Shannon Diaz, when they were in middle school, and the two of them started dating after reconnecting in high school, and Shannon got pregnant while they were still teens. Eddie asked her to marry him when she told him she was pregnant.[3] However, complications arose during the birth and Christopher Diaz was born with Cerebral Palsy.[4] A week after Christopher's birth, Eddie returned to Afghanistan to finish out his tour as an army medic but re-enlisted with the hopes of supporting his family. Once he left the army, Shannon left him and Christopher to take care of her mother who had been diagnosed with a rare type of cancer. She had asked Eddie to come with her multiple times, but he hadn't been ready to leave his family. Eventually, Eddie left Texas with Christopher, moving to L.A. and pursuing his current job as a firefighter.[2]\n\nLife in the Army[]\n\nShortly after Christopher's birth in 2011, Eddie returns to Afghanistan to finish out his tour as an army/combat medic. Before he leaves, Shannon gives him a St. Christopher's medallion to protect him, keep him safe, and remind him that he has a family to come home to.\n\nHowever, once Eddie discovers that Christopher has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, he re-enlists for another tour in 2013 without discussing it with Shannon, placing a strain on their already tumultuous relationship. He says that he didn't have a choice that someone has to pay for the bills and Christopher's medical expenses but when Shannon proposes that she go back to work part-time, Eddie shoots down the idea, telling her that she should stay home with Christopher. Shannon replies angrily, telling Eddie that he should be at home as well because she can't do this without him. They continue arguing, revealing that Eddie enlisted in the first place to provide for their family but again, did it without Shannon's knowledge and right after she became pregnant. The conversation is promptly cut off when Christopher starts crying and Eddie rushes to console him, awkward and a little uncertain about how to do so because he's still a \"stranger\" to Christopher.\n\nA few months later, Eddie returns to Afghanistan. He video calls with Shannon and Christopher while gearing up to go on a routine mission with his squadron. In tears, Shannon tells Eddie that her mother has cancer again and that she has to go see her to which Eddie replies that they'll figure something out. The connection cuts out before he can hear Shannon's response and Eddie diverts his attention back to the mission which involves transporting a wounded soldier back to base.\n\nThings take a turn for the worse when they are ambushed while flying over the Valley of Death, causing their helicopter to get shot down from the sky. When Eddie comes to after being unconscious for several hours, it's dark outside and the remains of the helicopter as well as the rest of his squadron are under fire by enemy groups. With the help of his chief, Eddie proceeds to get everyone out of the helicopter, guiding them behind some nearby rocks for cover. He even goes back to pull out Greggs, a fellow soldier who died on impact and ends up getting shot several times for his efforts. Bleeding out from his wounds, Eddie pulls out his St. Christopher's medallion and a photograph of Christopher, reminding himself that he has a son waiting for him back home. Help arrives shortly afterward and Eddie can only clutch that photograph closer to him, crying tears of gratitude and relief.\n\nEddie wakes up later in a medical tent with a dislocated shoulder, several broken bones, and a few bullet wounds. He is told that everyone in his squadron survived apart from Greggs and is commended for pulling Greggs out of the wreckage so that he, too could go home to his family. For Eddie's acts of \"gallantry and intrepidity,\" throughout his service, he is awarded a silver star, the third-highest military decoration for valor.\n\nEddie finds himself back in El Paso, three months later, surrounded by his family who are extremely proud of his heroism. Despite this, Eddie struggles to fit himself back into life alongside Shannon and Christopher, especially as Shannon continually proposes that they move to California. Eddie lashes out, telling her that he needs more time before diving head-first into such a huge decision. Shannon ultimately decides for him because when Eddie wakes up the next morning, she's gone, telling him in a note left behind that she \"needs some time too.\"\n\nTwo years later, Eddie's parents sit him down and suggest that it would be best if Christopher were to live with them instead of Eddie who has been working three different jobs to make ends meet. They tell him that Christopher needs consistency, especially after Shannon left and Eddie argues that if that's the case, him leaving wouldn't do Christopher any good. The argument grows heated and Eddie accuses his father, Ramon of trying to steal Christopher to make up for the childhood that he never provided Eddie with because he was always working. Eddie's mother, Helena tries to reduce the tension by encouraging Eddie to do the right thing by his son, but Eddie, hurt and angry, storms out onto the front porch.\n\nEddie finds Christopher sitting there, and they have a quiet moment to themselves. Christopher tells Eddie that he missed him \"all the time\" while he was serving in the army and Eddie holds Christopher tightly, vowing to never leave him again. The two decide to take a trip together and leave El Paso for L.A.[5]\n\nLife as a Firefighter[]\n\nIn \"Under Pressure,\" Eddie officially joins the 118 and is accepted into the fold rather warmly by Hen, Chimney, and captain, Bobby. However, Eddie clashes with Buck who fears competition and doesn't take nicely, which Bobby notices and warns Buck against. However, things take a swift turn when Eddie recognizes a frag round stuck in Charlies leg, cooperating with Buck to extract the explosive. After they are done, Eddie commends Buck on his ability to keep calm under such high-stakes, and they vow to have each other's backs.\n\nFrom here on out, Eddie's relationship with Buck and the rest of the team only grows, especially throughout \"7.1\" and \"Help Is Not Coming,\" in which LA must deal with the aftermath of a powerful earthquake, where Eddie and Buck collaborate to rescue people trapped in the building and later join Bobby. He fits in seamlessly with the 118, becoming both a respected and valued member due to the intuitiveness and courage he brings to the job.\n\nDespite this effortless transition into his role as a firefighter, Eddie struggles with juggling the long work hours and being a single father to Christopher. He relies on his elderly grandmother, Isabel and his aunt, Josephina to take care of Christopher while he is working, but the situation becomes more complicated in \"Stuck\" when Isabel suffers a fall and breaks her hip. At the hospital, Eddie reveals how difficult it is to find some permanent help because there are too many forms to fill out and Buck, having heard Eddie's woes with childcare, comes up with the perfect solution. He introduces Eddie to Carla Price, a close friend and also the home healthcare aid who took care of his ex-girlfriend Abby's mother Patricia before she died. With Carla now by his side and helping him take care of Christopher, Eddie is able to fully settle into life as a firefighter and in turn, life in L.A.\n\nReuniting with Shannon[]\n\nIn \"Haunted,\" Eddie and Carla take a tour of a prestigious school for Christopher. While hearing about the illustrious programs on offer, Eddie remains hesitant, concerned about Christopher's happiness and whether he would be able to feel like a normal kid. However, after witnessing the supportive environment they have in place for disabled children and Carla's confirmation that Christopher would be \"well-cared for,\" Eddie realizes that the school would be beneficial for Christopher. Before they can carry out Christopher's admission, Eddie learns that the school requires a family interview with Christopher's mother and is forced to get in touch with Shannon.\n\nLater, Shannon arrives at Eddie's house and the two hug awkwardly before making their way to Christopher's room. As Shannon looks around, she marvels at how much Christopher has grown and wonders if he has asked about her. Eddie says that he hasn't in a while, especially since Christopher has a lot to keep him busy with the move to LA and the new school. They eventually get to talking about the school and Shannon asks if she can see Christopher, talk to him and make sure he's okay with taking this big step. Feeling uncomfortable, Eddie says it wouldn't be a good idea and that it would just confuse Christopher because he hasn't seen Shannon in over two years.\n\nThis sparks the beginning of an argument with Shannon accusing Eddie of always doing \"what's best for everyone\" without asking them and of never having her back when she needed him the most. She storms out before they can come to a decision about the family interview and an infuriated Eddie confesses what happened to Carla who advises him that allowing Shannon back into his and Christopher's lives would be the best thing for his son.\n\nTaking the advice to heart, Eddie swings by the school after receiving a call that Shannon had completed the interview. Before she can leave, Eddie explains how he had always thought she would come back and give them a chance to fix things but when she didn't, he was left wondering why. In tears, Shannon tells him that the longer she was gone, the harder it was to come back and worries that Christopher probably hates her because she holds herself responsible for him having Cerebral Palsy. Eddie hugs and reassures her, telling her that Christopher loves and misses her. He adds that he misses her too and the two end up kissing and reconciling with each other.\n\nTwo months later, Eddie and Shannon start sleeping together in secret. In \"Merry Ex-Mas,\" just as they're getting dressed after spending the night together, Christopher and Isabel make an impromptu arrival. Eddie insists on Shannon sneaking out the back despite her attempts at convincing him that this would be the perfect moment to tell Christopher the truth about them. Feeling frustrated, Shannon leaves but shows up later at the firehouse where Eddie, alongside Buck and Chimney are managing the annual Christmas toy drive.\n\nEddie takes her aside immediately and the two get into a heated argument about the nature of their relationship and the fact that they are hiding it from Christopher. Shannon questions whether Eddie will ever be able to forgive her for leaving them and Eddie replies that while he can forgive her, he isn't sure if he can trust her. This leaves the two of them at a crossroads, unsure of what to do or where to go from here.\n\nLater, Eddie and Buck take Christopher to see Santa at the mall. While Christopher talks to Santa, Eddie confides in Buck about Shannon, reasoning that it was never his intention to fall back into bed with his estranged wife. Buck consoles Eddie, affirming that he understands Eddie's reasons for wanting to keep Shannon out of Christopher's life because after all, Shannon had already run out on them once. This prompts Eddie to admit that he was the one who ran out first, the one who re-enlisted to \"pay the bills\" after hearing about Christopher's diagnosis, and the one who got called a hero for running away because it was for a \"noble cause.\"\n\nBuck listens intently and suggests that maybe Eddie should let Shannon back into Christopher's life since it's apparent that she is already back in Eddie's. Although the thought of doing so confuses Eddie further, bringing him no closer to an answer to his dilemma, Buck and Eddie manage to share a laugh, solemnly agreeing that sex just complicates everything.\n\nThat same night, Eddie learns that Christopher's wish for Christmas is to see his mother again. Now, knowing how Christopher feels about everything, Eddie starts leaning more towards the idea of letting Shannon back into their lives. Eddie's decision is solidified further after he witnesses the heart-warming reunion between a Marine Corps sergeant, his wife, and daughter. This leads to Shannon and Eddie surprising Christopher on Christmas day.\n\nIn the months that follow, Eddie and Shannon develop a routine that involves co-parenting Christopher and maintaining their own relationship. However, neither of them are completely sure of what they want going into the future. Shannon wonders whether Eddie only sees her as Christopher's mother and Eddie admits that while the new dynamic they have going on is great, he is still waiting for a sign, something to tell him which direction to step in regarding their relationship. In \"Careful What You Wish For,\" Shannon provides Eddie with the \"sign\" he's looking for by confessing that she might be pregnant.\n\nReeling from Shannon's confession, Eddie reaches out to Bobby for some much-needed advice. Eddie reveals to Bobby that he feels uncertain about whether he and Shannon are ready for another baby, but Bobby points out that they weren't ready the first time either. He adds that they figured it out before, and they can do it again, especially because Eddie is already a great father. While this puts Eddie's mind at ease somewhat, it has him questioning whether he can be a good husband and more importantly, whether he is ready to be a husband again.\n\nEddie answers this question for himself after witnessing the aftermath of a bombing which has devastating consequences for a husband and his wife. This, alongside Bobby's words of wisdom, spurs Eddie to treat Shannon to dinner at a high-end restaurant where he tells her how much he and Christopher love her and how he wants them all to be a family again. However, much to Eddie's surprise, Shannon disagrees with him. She tells him that because she is still learning about what it means to be a mother, she is not ready to be a wife, and proposes that they should get a divorce instead. The two never manage to reach that stage, however, as Shannon was severely injured in a road incident attended by 118, much to his horror. While Hen and the other paramedics busy themselves with boarding Shannon into the ambulance, Chimney tells Eddie that Shannon is decompensating and requires intubation, which involves inserting a tube into the airways to assist with breathing. He believes Shannon may never survive, and Eddie chooses to delay it, so Shannon could share her last moments with him.\n\nShannon dies away on the way to hospital and in the days that follow, Eddie deals with the difficult tasks of telling Christopher that his mother is gone and making funeral arrangements, all while managing his own grief. In \"This Life We Choose,\" the aftermath of Shannon's funeral sees much of Eddie's extended family arrive in LA to support both Eddie and Christopher. However, his parents' constant efforts to try and convince him to return home to El Paso causes Eddie to lash out. He argues that he has a life in LA, a family with the 118, Isabel, and Josephine, and that he won't uproot Christopher again, not when he has grown so accustomed to his new school and friends.\n\nLater, Eddie is taken off probation during a special ceremony at the firehouse and officially welcomed into the ranks of the LAFD. His family attends the event, catching glimpses of the life, friendships, and family Eddie has created for himself and Christopher. Although it is clear that Eddie's parents still hold some doubt and concern for Eddie and Christopher's well-being, these glimpses prompt them to accept Eddie's decision to remain in LA, and they congratulate Eddie for his hard work and achievement.\n\nTsunami[]\n\nIn \"Kids Today\", Eddie, wanting to help Buck get out of his depression over not being allowed back to work, leaves Christopher with him for the day, knowing that spending time with him would help Buck clear his head. He leaves for work, and this is when the tsunami hits Los Angeles, and he, with the rest of the 118, rush to save the day. During this time, Eddie is under the impression that Christopher and Buck are safe because Buck told him they were going to the movies. While saving lives in the aftermath of the tsunami, Eddie meets Lena Bosko, a firefighter with the 136 and befriends her. At the end of the day, while assisting at the VA hospital, he sees Buck there, bruised and bloody, without Christopher. Eddie realizes that they had gotten caught up in the tsunami, and just as Buck is trying to tell him that Christopher is gone, Eddie sees a woman carrying Christopher in her arms. He rushes over to them and hugs Christopher, thanking the woman profusely.\n\nAfter the tsunami, Eddie takes Christopher back to Buck's loft. Buck is shocked that Eddie doesn't hate him, and would want him to be around Christopher after what happened. Eddie tells Buck that he knew it was an accident and that Buck did everything he could to protect Christopher. He then declares that there's no one in this world he trusts more than Buck when it comes to Christopher.\n\nIllegal Fighting[]\n\nIn \"Triggers,\" Eddie is getting ready for the start of another shift at the firehouse while half-listening to Chimney's relationship troubles with Maddie. Once Chimney realizes that Eddie is not listening as intently as he usually would, Eddie reveals that he has not been sleeping due to Christopher's recurring, tsunami-related nightmares. Chimney tries to console his friend, telling Eddie that nightmares after traumatic events are to be expected, but Eddie continues to worry, especially because Christopher refuses to open up to him.\n\nThat night, Christopher has another nightmare, which prompts Eddie to seek professional help for his son in the form of a child psychologist. At the appointment, the psychologist explains that Christopher's subconscious is still trying to understand the trauma that he went through in the tsunami, a process that is slow and time-consuming. When Eddie mentions how he wishes that Christopher felt comfortable enough to talk to him about his nightmares, the psychologist points out that Christopher may be trying to communicate non-verbally and provides Eddie with a folder containing Christopher's artwork. As Eddie examines the contents of the folder, he notices that a drowning woman seems to be featured in almost all of the drawings. He wonders who the woman might be, noting that while Buck managed to shield Christopher from many of the horrific scenes of the tsunami, the two were separated for a lengthy period of time, during which Eddie remains uncertain about what Christopher might have witnessed. The psychologist reassures Eddie that Christopher will talk to him about everything when he feels ready and that, until then, all Eddie can do is \"keep loving\" his son.\n\nThough Eddie continued to be his usual dependable self, in season 3, it is revealed that he had been struggling with feelings of anger over Shannon's untimely demise and found an outlet in the underground cage fighting scene. He beat up his opponent so bad that he had to perform CPR on the spot and call 9-1-1. Lena's truck company responded to the scene and her captain, having recognized him from the tsunami, reports him to Bobby. Eddie finally breaks down and confesses to Bobby that he turned to fighting to keep his anger under control as he was Christopher's only parent left and couldn't let him down again.[6] In the episode \"Fallout\", he begins seeing a counselor to work through his issues.\n\nWell Collapse[]\n\nIn \"Eddie Begins\", Eddie is surprised by a visit from Carla and Christopher at the firehouse, with Christopher wanting to use Eddie's Silver Star for his show-and-tell, and also asks Eddie to speak to his class about how he got the medal. Despite being visibly uncomfortable at the idea and having flashbacks, Eddie agrees. The 118 is then called to a farmhouse where a mother has reported her son, Hayden, as missing. They eventually realize that he's fallen down an old well, and Eddie volunteers to go down and find him. There is a heavy thunderstorm about to come their way, so Eddie only has a limited time to find Hayden. Just as he does, his time runs out and Bobby orders everyone to start pulling him back out. Frantic at the thought of not being able to save the child, Eddie cuts his own line in an uncharacteristically rash move so that he can grab Hayden before being pulled back up. Chimney is then sent down to find him, and he first takes Hayden with him and goes back up to the surface. Just as Eddie is waiting for Chimney to come back for him, lightning strikes the crane that is holding down the rig, and Eddie winds up being buried alive. He loses consciousness for a few moments, and when he wakes up, he tries to radio the 118, but fails. He drifts in and out of awareness, and then starts to remember Christopher and Buck and the 118, and becomes determined to save himself. He manages to swim to the surface of the river, much to his team's relief.\n\nShortly after the rescue, Eddie goes to Christopher's class for his show-and-tell, and narrates a kid-friendly version of the story behind his Silver Star. After being asked by one of the students if he ever wears it, Eddie replies that he's \"not really a jewelry kind of guy\", except for the St. Christopher medallion that Shannon gave him.\n\nMoving on From Shannon and Dating Ana[]\n\nIn Season 4, Eddie is in a much better place mentally than he was in Season 3, as we see him being a lot happier and even giving advice to other people, especially Buck, during the visit of his parents. In \"Jinx\", he runs into Ana Flores, Christopher's old English Teacher; who is now the Vice-Principal of another school at an emergency. Eddie feels a spark with her and tells Buck about it, and Buck spills the beans in front of the rest of the 118, who tease Eddie about it. Bobby later talks to Eddie about it, encouraging him to try to move on.\n\nEddie decides to go on a date with Ana, and it initially goes smoothly. However, in \"Breaking Point\", he winds up clashing with Christopher, who is upset that Eddie has started dating. Christopher runs away to Buck's apartment, and the two of them talk and Christopher eventually comes around to the idea of Eddie and Ana dating, and seems to like her. Ana starts spending a lot of time with Eddie and Christopher, and while things seem to be going well, in \"Suspicion\", Carla seems to be skeptical about their relationship, and advises Eddie to \"follow his heart\".\n\nGetting Shot and Anxiety[]\n\nIn \"Suspicion\", Eddie meets a boy named Charlie at an emergency, who is diagnosed with some unknown chronic illness, and his mother, Sheila. Ana and Carla point out that there's something strange about Charlie's condition, and after doing some digging, Eddie realizes that Sheila is deliberately making him sick. After telling Chimney and Buck about his suspicions, Eddie gets a frantic call from Charlie, and Buck drives him there, calling the 133 for assistance.\n\nAs they are ready to leave the scene, Eddie is shot in the middle of the street by a sniper. The rest of the firefighters, including Buck, just barely get away, and Eddie is rushed to the hospital, where he is taken into surgery. He remains in a coma for some time, under intubation. During this time, Ana is by his side, while Buck takes care of Christopher. Soon enough, Eddie wakes up, and Ana alerts Buck about it.\n\nIn the season 5 episode \"Panic\", Eddie and Christopher are tux shopping with Ana for her godsons christening. While assisting them, the store clerk mistakenly refers to Ana as Eddie's wife. In reaction to this, Eddie experiences what he believes is a heart attack, and is transported to the hospital. The cardiologist informs Eddie that he just had a panic attack, and asks if he has recently experienced anything traumatic, and Christopher confirms that he was shot in the line of duty. The doctor believes this could be what's causing the panic attacks, but Eddie later admits that he is scared of a future with Ana, and they break up.\n\nPTSD[]\n\nAs Season 5 continues, it becomes clear that Eddie's relationship with Ana was not the sole source of his anxiety. In \"Brawl in Cell Block 9-1-1\", he and Buck are taken hostage by two escaped prisoners, who threaten them with Christopher's life if they don't cooperate. Eddie is visibly shaken by the experience at the end of the episode, distancing himself from the team, and going home to Christopher for comfort. In \"Defend in Place\", after thinking that they lost two children in the hospital fire, Eddie is on the verge of a panic attack, and is uncharacteristically unable to distance himself and keep his cool, signifying his worsening mental condition.\n\nIn \"Wrapped in Red\" Eddie accidentally spills hot chocolate on Christopher's gingerbread house, Christopher then goes into a panic and shouts that he is scared that Eddie will die on the job. Eddie then talks to Carla about the incident, and she expresses her concerns as well, but reassures him that she knows he will do what is best for himself and Christopher. Eddie then reveals that he's still shaken and traumatized by being shot as well as being taken hostage at gunpoint, and admits that he didn't say anything to anyone because he wanted to get over it. He winds up quitting the 118 in an impulsive decision, convincing himself it's the best thing to do for Christopher.\n\nWhile Eddie is working as a liaison, In \"Outside Looking In\" when the dispatch center is working with the Fire Department during an emergency, Eddie takes a dispatcher's earpiece and gives advice on what to do to the fire department. Later, Josh steps into his office to tell him that he needs to leave the calls to the dispatchers, and if he has any concerns, he can talk to him, but it was not Eddie's place to take over a call.\n\nEddie is clearly struggling to adjust to his new job, his condition visibly worsening over the course of the episode. He is supposed to meet his former teammates at the 118 for drinks, but then backs out at the last moment, feeling like an outsider. He then later talks to Christopher about his decision to quit, and Christopher tells him that he never wanted Eddie to quit his job. Eddie becomes convinced that he is ready to return to being a firefighter and tries to talk to Bobby about it, but Bobby is disturbed by how unwell Eddie seems, and wants him to get help first. Eddie feels betrayed and blows up on Bobby.\n\nAfter a few therapy appointments and a suggestion from his therapist, In \"Fear-O-Phobia\", Eddie tries to reach out to the people he saved while he was in the army. Later, Chris calls Buck to come over when he hears crashing coming from Eddie's bedroom, When Buck arrives, he finds Eddie on the floor of his destroyed bedroom, crying. Eddie then explains to Buck that everyone he saved is dead. A few days later, In \"Dumb Luck\" Eddie has a nightmare in which he relives all his past trauma while having breakfast with Christopher. When he wakes up, he finds Bobby in his apartment. Bobby offers guidance to Eddie on how to deal with his grief. As Buck is with Eddie later, Eddie expresses his feelings to Buck about whether his job as a firefighter is worth the trauma. Buck then takes him to a Horse Ranch that a kid he saved commonly goes to, showing Eddie that his job may be worth the risk.\n\nWhen the Dispatch center burns down in \"May Day\" Eddie assists people around the Dispatch Center and asses the situation, when the Fire department arrives he helps them eliminate the fire, ostensibly restoring his passion for being a firefighter. In \"Starting Over\" he is seen back with the 118 Firehouse.\n\nBack at the 118[]\n\nIn Season 6, Eddie is in a much better place, and has settled back into life as a firefighter. During this time, in \"Animal Instincts\", he butts heads with Christopher, who is growing up and has gotten frustrated with Eddie's overprotective nature. The both of them eventually come to a compromise and Eddie has to accept that Christopher isn't the little kid he used to be. In \"What's Your Fantasy?\" Eddie prepares Christopher for his first school dance with Carla's help, and feels emotional and joyful over the milestone.\n\nIn \"Cursed\", Eddie tries to help out an actress, Felisa, when she believes she's being cursed, but in reality, she's just being taken advantage of by her assistant. Eddie uses his own experiences to try and give her some advice, and they part as friends. Later, he calls up his Abuela to check up on how she's doing.\n\nLater on, in \"In a Flash\", Eddie is devastated and terrified when Buck is struck by lightning, and does his best to save him. Later on, he attempts to help Buck out with his PTSD, in \"Recovery\", and in \"Mixed Feelings\", he takes Buck to an exclusive poker club to test out his new math skills.\n\nDating Again[]\n\nIn \"Performance Anxiety\", Eddie's aunt, Pepa, attempts to set him up with Vanessa, the niece of a friend of hers. Despite not being interested, Eddie goes on the date to get his Pepa off his back, having every intention to turn her down gently. However, it turns out that Vanessa isn't interested in dating, either, and they both come up with a story to tell their aunts about why it didn't work. However, Pepa sees right through Eddie's lie and then tells him that she doesn't want him to be lonely. Eddie admits that he doesn't want to be alone, either, indicating that he's open to dating once more.\n\nIn \"Death and Taxes\", Eddie seems to be struggling with loneliness, especially after a victim at a living funeral tells him that that everyone dies alone. He later repeats this to Buck, and looks visibly disturbed when Buck tells him about Natalia, a death doula whom Buck feels sees him better than anyone else. Later, at home, Eddie looks at a photo of Shannon, wishing that he has a partner. He then calls up his mother and says that he wants to visit his family in Texas, despite having refused her earlier on in the episode when she called.\n\nEddie's attempts at meeting women are disastrous in \"Love Is in the Air\", and while shopping with Bobby for materials for Christopher's school project at a hardware store, he asks him for advice. Later on, after returning to the store, Eddie runs into Marisol, a woman he had helped out on a call earlier in the season. They flirt a bit, and Marisol is clearly interested in Eddie. Later, in \"Pay It Forward\", Eddie is attempting to text Marisol, but is too nervous. At the end of the episode, though, with Christopher watching, he manages to call her up, and they decide to go out together.\n\nSeeing Shannon's Doppelganger[]\n\nWhile out with Marisol and Christopher, Eddie sees a woman at a boutique looking exactly like Shannon. Eddie later goes back to meet her, where they flirt a little bit. The woman introduced herself as Kim. That night, Eddie secretly goes on a dinner date with her, despite still being with Marisol.[7] He continues seeing her not telling anyone about her, until Kim drops by the firehouse and she meets Buck. Buck then confronts Eddie about her and he urges him to tell Kim the real reason why he's seeing her. Eventually, Eddie comes clean and Kim is shocked at the resemblance between her and Shannon. Later Kim shows back up at his house with a haircut to look exactly like his dead wife. She has him talk to her as if she was Shannon to get closure. They embrace each other but at that moment, Marisol walks in with Chris. For a moment, Chris thinks Kim is his mom and Marisol is devastated that her boyfriend is seeing another woman, let alone one that looks like Shannon.[8]\n\nThis caused a strain on Eddie and Chris' relationship, with the latter refusing to speak to him. Eddie insinuated Marisol broke up with him as well. Chris had called his grandparents late at night to take him to live in Texas for awhile. Eddie is upset with his decision, but he knows he can't and won't stop him.[9]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nOn the job, Eddie is portrayed as resourceful, dependable and able to think quickly on his feet, which he has attributed to his experience operating \"while getting shot at\" in Afghanistan. He is a private person who generally does not share his problems with his co-workers for fear of being a burden to them, as seen in early season 2 where he only reveals childcare arrangement woes to Buck when he was at his wit's end.[4] Gradually he begins to accept them as \"family\" and is more willing to seek their help. Eddie's personality is a bit cynical, cold, and brooding. Something noticed by Shannon in Careful What You Wish For (2×17), calling him \"Mr Broody,\" implying that is how she knows him.\n\nAs a father, Eddie is extremely loving and affectionate with Christopher, and is very protective over him. He often says that he's determined not to be like his father was, and he always tries to let Christopher know that it's okay to be sad or have complicated feelings.\n\nEddie is a very friendly person, despite his private nature, and is shown to make friends easily, as with the 118 in \"Under Pressure\", and also the 126 in \"Hold the Line\". He has a very sarcastic and dry sense of humor, and tends to gently make fun of his friends and the people he's close to (especially Buck). However, he also has a very kind and empathetic nature, and can have sympathy for anyone, as witnessed when he even tried to help the man who held him hostage at gunpoint.[10]\n\nWhile Eddie usually has the ability to stay objective on calls, he usually gets very emotionally involved if there's a child in danger. Over the course of the show, as he goes to therapy and stops bottling up his feelings, he allows himself to be more emotional and open with the people around him.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nShannon Diaz[]\n\nMain article: Shannon-Eddie (relationship)\n\nChristopher Diaz[]\n\nMain article: Christopher-Eddie (relationship)\n\nEvan Buckley[]\n\nMain article: Buck-Eddie (relationship)\n\nAna Flores[]\n\nMain article: Ana-Eddie (relationship)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nEddie's ethnicity and upbringing in Texas is similar to that of actor Ryan Guzman who was born in Abilene, Texas but later moved to Sacramento, California and is of mixed Mexican and Swedish descent.\n\nHe was a Probationary Firefighter (Grade 2) from S2 E1 - S2 E18, he officially becomes a Firefighter (Grade 3) at the end of Season 2\n\nIn \"Eddie Begins,\" we learn that Eddie was accepted into fire departments in Chicago and LA, with him choosing the latter.\n\nThe address of his apartment is 4995 South Bedford Street, Los Angeles.[10][11]\n\nIn \"Eddie Begins,\" Helena states the birth order of her children using the ‘and then’ sequence, implying this is the direct order.\n\nIn “Hold the Line”, Eddie states he went to La Salle High School. In real life, this institution is Catholic, so with that and Eddie’s upbringing, it can be inferred he was a Catholic School Boy.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason Two \"Under Pressure\" \"7.1\" \"Help Is Not Coming\" \"Stuck\" \"Awful People\" \"Dosed\" \"Haunted\" \"Buck, Actually\" \"Hen Begins\" \"Merry Ex-Mas\" \"New Beginnings\" \"Chimney Begins\" \"Fight or Flight\" \"Broken\" \"Ocean's 9-1-1\" \"Bobby Begins Again\" \"Careful What You Wish For\" \"This Life We Choose\"\n\nSeason Three \"Kids Today\" \"Sink or Swim\" \"The Searchers\" \"Triggers\" \"Rage\" \"Monsters\" \"Athena Begins\" \"Malfunction\" \"Fallout\" \"Christmas Spirit\" \"Seize the Day\" \"Fools\" \"Pinned\" \"The Taking of Dispatch 9-1-1\" \"Eddie Begins\" \"The One That Got Away\" \"Powerless\" \"What's Next?\"\n\nSeason Four \"The New Abnormal\" \"Alone Together\" \"Future Tense\" \"9-1-1, What's Your Grievance?\" \"Buck Begins\" \"Jinx\" \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" \"Breaking Point\" \"Blindsided\" \"Parenthood\"\n\n\"First Responders\" \"Treasure Hunt\" \"Suspicion\" \"Survivors\"\n\nSeason Five \"Panic\" \"Desperate Times\" \"Desperate Measures\" \"Home and Away\" \"Peer Pressure\" \"Brawl in Cell Block 9-1-1\" \"Ghost Stories\" \"Defend in Place\" \"Past is Prologue\" \"Wrapped in Red\" \"Outside Looking In\" \"Boston\" \"Fear-O-Phobia\" \"Dumb Luck\" \"FOMO\" \"May Day\" \"Hero Complex\" \"Starting Over\"\n\nSeason Six \"Let the Games Begin\" \"Crash & Learn\" \"The Devil You Know\" \"Animal Instincts\" \"Home Invasion\" \"Tomorrow\" \"Cursed\" \"What's Your Fantasy?\" \"Red Flag\" \"In a Flash\" \"In Another Life\" \"Recovery\" \"Mixed Feelings\" \"Performance Anxiety\" \"Death and Taxes\" \"Lost & Found\" \"Love Is in the Air\" \"Pay It Forward\"\n\nSeason Seven \"Abandon ‘Ships\" \"Rock the Boat\" \"Capsized\" \"Buck, Bothered and Bewildered\" \"You Don't Know Me\" \"There Goes the Groom\" \"Ghost of a Second Chance\" \"Step Nine\" \"Ashes, Ashes\" \"All Fall Down\"\n\nSeason Two \"Back in the Saddle\" \"2100°\" \"Hold the Line\" \"Friends With Benefits\" \"Difficult Conversations\" \"Everyone and Their Brother\" \"Displaced\" \"Bad Call\" \"Saving Grace\" \"A Little Help From My Friends\"\n\n\"Slow Burn\" \"The Big Heat\" \"One Day\" \"Dust to Dust\"\n\nGallery[]"
