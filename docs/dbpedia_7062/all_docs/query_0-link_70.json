        "text": "NBC Universal's Suits universe is expanding further with a new development. Building on the legal drama's tremendous success on streaming platforms last year, NBC has greenlit a pilot for a companion series titled Suits: L.A.\n\nThe project comes from Suits creator Aaron Korsh and will inhabit the familiar world of the original show while introducing a fresh set of characters.\n\n(Also Read: Brad Pitt to star in Quentin Tarantino’s final film, The Movie Critic)\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nUniversal Studios, the producer of the original series, is spearheading the Los Angeles-set spinoff. The collaboration between the studio and Aaron Korsh began in October, as they embarked on developing the project. This initiative followed the remarkable summer success of Suits, which dominated the streaming charts after being added to Netflix.\n\nKorsh takes on the role of executive producer alongside Dave Bartis, Doug Liman, and Gene Klein, all of whom previously served as executive producers on the original USA show.\n\nThe pilot will be directed and co-executive produced by Victoria Mahoney, known for her work on Seven Seconds and Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nSuits: L.A. Gears Up for Production\n\nThe show is rapidly moving forward, set to commence production in March in Vancouver. If it gets the green light for a series, it could potentially join the lineup for the 2024-25 season.\n\nCasting details are yet to be revealed, and the question of whether any actors from the original series will make appearances in the spinoff remains unanswered. However, original series star Patrick J Adams has expressed openness to a potential return.\n\nSuits: L.A. will revolve around Ted Black, a former federal prosecutor from New York who undergoes a reinvention while advocating for influential clients in Los Angeles. Faced with a crisis at his firm, Ted must confront a role he had previously disdained throughout his entire career in order to ensure its survival.\n\n(Also Read: Arnold Schwarzenegger reveals feeding his grandchildren same oatmeal treat as his pet pig)\n\nNielsen reports that US TV viewers collectively spent 57.7 billion minutes watching Suits in 2023, marking the highest yearly total in the four years the ratings service has publicly disclosed streaming data."
