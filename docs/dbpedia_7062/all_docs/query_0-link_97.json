        "text": "American legal drama television series Suits may be planning to bring back Jessica Pearson’s character on-screen in a spin-off to the legal drama.\n\nGina Torres, 47, who played Pearson in the show for six seasons, would reprise her role in the other project that is in works at Universal Cable Productions, confirmed The Hollywood Reporter. Suits is set at a fictional law firm in New York City.\n\nThis development comes after Torres’ departure from Suits midway through season six, citing personal reasons.\n\nHowever, sources say the deal is in its nascent stage and USA Network has not yet been pitched the potential offshoot. It is being said no deals are currently in place.\n\nBoth USA Network and UCP declined comment.\n\nThe popular TV series premiered on June 23, 2011, in the US. The focal point of the show follows talented college dropout Mike Ross (Patrick J Adams), who initially works as a law associate for Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), despite never actually attending law school. The show focuses on Harvey and Mike managing to close cases while maintaining Mike’s secret."
