        "text": "Minh and Jessica were a delight to work with. They helped us buy our first home and explained everything so well along the way, giving so much of their time and showing so much understanding and patience towards us. I can not recommend them enough. Lovely people to work alongside and they have your best in mind.\n\nAlex\n\nI highly recommend Minh and his team! Minh is knowledgeable about bankâ€™s lending process and products available. He was always there to assist with any issues or questions I had, even outside of business hours. The refinance and pre approval process was smooth and easy. He really took the time to structure the loan that suited my situation and get the best deal. Thank you Minh and Jess!"
