        "text": "Fernando Torres has agreed a two-year deal to join AC Milan and finally end one of the most disastrous moves in Premier League history.\n\nThe Spanish striker has endured an unhappy three-and-a-half-years years at Stamford Bridge after securing a £50 million (A$88.8 million) move from Chelsea in Jan 2011.\n\nThat fee, then a British record, was only beaten this week by the £59.7 (A$106.1 million) million that Manchester United have invested in Angel Di Maria.\n\nHowever, despite the scale of the fee and despite having two years left on his deal, it appears Chelsea are letting Torres go for free.\n\nChelsea last night (Friday) confirmed the move, describing it as a \"two-year loan deal\" which, given he has only two years left on his contract, effectively means he is leaving them for good unless things drastically change. The statement did not say whether Chelsea had the option of a recall.\n\nAt the same time the club have, it is understood, not agreed to pay Torres a severance package. It had been thought the 30-year-old was holding out for a payment on the £175,000-a-week (A$311,000) contract he has with Chelsea but because his move to Milan is for two seasons, no pay-off has been forthcoming.\n\nTorres, who scored 45 goals in 172 games for Chelsea - and helped them win the Champions League and Europa League -has struggled since his move from Liverpool and has dropped even further down the pecking order. Jose Mourinho had insisted that Torres needed to inform the club that he wanted to go and that the deal was concluded swiftly so that he could find a replacement. Torres is due to undergo a medical in Milan on Saturday.\n\nChelsea will now move quickly to sign a replacement so that the manager has the complement of three senior strikers that he says he needs in his squad.\n\nThere was relief on Friday at Chelsea that Diego Costa came through an afternoon training session, after sitting out the previous two days with a muscular injury, and he has been included in the squad who face Everton at Goodison Park at teattime today.\n\nChelsea are interested in the Roma striker Mattia Destro but the Italian club are reluctant to sell.\n\nSuch was Mourinho's extended eulogy that he gave yesterday for Destro, once a protege of his Inter Milan, that it left little room for doubt that the 23-year old Italian was his favoured target. \"Mattia was only a kid, 18, when I was at Inter,\" Mourinho said. \"He was playing in our under-20 team, training with us so many times. Everyone at the club knew that the potential was there for him to be a top striker.\"\n\nChelsea's need for Destro is self-evident in the event of Torres's departure. Should Didier Drogba sustain any injury, the club have few front-line options to turn to outside Diego. Asked if the Torres story was a sad one on a \"human level\", to use his description of the Chelsea culture, he replied: \"I don't think so. He won a few things, scored a few important goals. I cannot speak about such a negative move.\"\n\nMourinho also clarified that Torres's exit could not solve the predicament where Chelsea need to let another foreign player leave, after the sale of Romelu Lukaku to Everton and loans for Christian Atsu, Oriol Romeu and Marko Marin.\n\n\"If we have to react to Fernando's departure, we'll react by buying a foreign striker, because in the market I don't see an English striker who would come to us, or where his club would let him. If we lose a foreign striker, we need another.\"\n\nChelsea still need to offload another foreign player over the age of 21 from the 18 on their books, to abide by Premier League and Champions League rules, and there is a mounting sense that the man most vulnerable is 32-year-old Petr Cech. While the Czech has proved a peerless servant throughout his decade at Stamford Bridge, keeping 161 clean sheets in 323 games, Mourinho harbours too much respect for the goalkeeper to let him fade away on the bench as a permanent second choice behind Thibaut Courtois.\n\nLoading\n\nThe visit to Goodison Park also brings an unexpectedly early reunion with former charge Samuel Eto'o, who this month agreed a two-year deal with Everton at the age of 33 and who Mourinho was secretly recorded as mocking by a French TV station, claiming that the Cameroonian was three years older than his stated age."
