        "text": "I think Bon Jovi should write a rock opera with Tommy and Gina as main characters. They could even fit in songs like Prayer, I.M.L and 99 I.T.S.\n\nIf you are unsure to what a rock opera is then, it's an album which each songs follows on from the last one to make up a whole story. They could even make it into a film, such as Tommy but The Who, or The Wall by Pink Flloyd.\n\nI think this would be cool, because they can write popular rock songs to be hits and sell the album, and they can also try out a few different sounds, because a rock opera, or story telling album needs to have a few different sounds on them. This would be something different for the band and I think that's what they need sometime soon, to stay \"on top of the world\" if you know what I mean. I think something like this, although out of place with the new music around would be a hit because Bon Jovi are still considered one of the best bands in the world. However, they would have a write a very good storyline as well as good sounding songs, to make sure that the album wouldn't be a flop.\n\n__________________\n\nRe: Tommy & Gina\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by walter\n\nI think John should write a song called like this, to tell where they are in life after all these years. talking about 'em in IML was a good connection (that's why EVERYONE seems to consider this song as LOAP #2), but doing this would end the circle\n\nEnd the circle? I don't want the Tommy and Gina circle to end. I love the idea that they may be referred to in future Jovi songs. It's kind of like telling a love story, Tommy and Gina's love story, and maybe it's just the hopeless, girly romantic in me, but it kind of gives me hope that that kind of love still exists.\n\n__________________\n\nWe are everyday angels. Be careful with me because I'd like to stay that way.\n\n--Jewel Kilcher\n\nNow I know what it's like to take a shower with 60,000 people!\n\n-- Jon Bon Jovi, August 7, 2003\n\n*~ NOTHING WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT LOVE ~*"
