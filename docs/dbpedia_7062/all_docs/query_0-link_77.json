By the time he turned nineteen, he captained Atletico Madrid. He is one of only two players who was a World Cup Winner, a European champion with both his club and the national side, and holder of the Europa League trophy – all at the same time.\n\nA former Spanish footballer, World Champion, and two-time European champion with the Spanish national team, Fernando Torres holds various national and international titles with several football clubs. He is especially linked to Atletico de Madrid, the club he started out with while still a child before making his debut in the club’s first team at the tender age of 17 years.\n\nIt was at the British Club Chelsea, however, that Fernando Torres reached the heights of European football, winning the Champions League in the 2011 – 2012 season and going on to win his first Europa League the next year. He has also played for Liverpool FC where he was their top scorer for two seasons. At “The Reds”, he gained individual recognition when FIFA included him in the 2008 and 2009 FIFAPro World 11. He received the Bronze Ball for his efforts.\n\nIn 2019, however, he returned to his roots after spending one season of his 18-year career with the Japanese Club Sagan Tosu. His last season as a competitive player saw Atletico de Madrid win the 2017/1018 Europa League and finish second in the Spanish National League.\n\nWith regards to his career highlights, he made history as part of the Spanish National Team which won the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He was awarded the Golden Boot as the tournament’s top scorer. The same team had won the European Championship two years earlier when they beat Germany in the final. He was also the recipient of the Prince Asturias Award for Sport in Oviedo as a member of the Spanish National Team in 2010.\n\nBesides being an outstanding sportsman known for his commitment, sacrifice, and effort, he has the ability to always push for the best in both himself and teammates when under pressure. These qualities have allowed him to become an authoritative voice leading top teams.\n\nFernando Torres – Speaker\n\nAs a conference speaker, Fernando Torres knows what it takes to achieve top performance and the sacrifices needed for success. He lives in Spain and presents in both Spanish and English.\n\nSpeaking Topics"
