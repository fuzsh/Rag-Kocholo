        "text": "Why don't more churches start schools? Far too many pastors straddle this issue so they don't offend their members who hold different positions in their congregations. This is baffling to me. I will develop this more later, but here are four reasons churches should start schools: 1. Theological - The scriptural argument is simple. Christian discipleship is the calling and priority of the church. The service and contributions to families, congregations, and the common good are profound. 2. Historical - The historical commitment of the church to education provides a robust precedent for modern Christians. From Augustine to the reformers to Thomas Chalmers, the church has prioritized the propagation of schools and Christian education. We are grossly out of step on this front. 3. Cultural - The current cultural climate, with its shifting values and increasing secularization, calls for strategic Christian engagement. Schools can serve as outposts where Christian principles are upheld and where students are equipped to engage thoughtfully and effectively with the world. 4. Strategic - The educational reform window of opportunity in America is as wide open as it ever has been. Most parents are not satisfied with the options available to them. And, SO many other factors: the number of churches that sit empty, the support resources available to start schools, the growth of the classical Christian school movement, etc. The time is now and the need is urgent. There is not one narrow path to pursue. Get some people together. Pray about it and see what happens. Churches, start schools, but please, don't start bad ones! We can help, but don't start schools that are operationally weak, financially feeble, and propped up with ill-equipped leaders (more on this later as well). For fun, I ran a scenario and did some quick math. The PCA has been averaging around 30-40 new church plants per year. Let's say the PCA committed to plant a school every time they planted a church. Do that for a decade and watch what happens. Or, suppose the PCA church allocated 1% of its budget to education. This would amount to a mere $5,000 per church annually. With around 1,540 churches in the PCA, this would generate approximately $7.7 million per year towards educational initiatives. Do we have any idea what the collective impact would be if churches took this seriously? Have we considered how to leverage the immense resources that Christians are sitting on right now? Am I missing something? We have seen courageous leaders like Karen Elliott, Russ Gregg, and Kevin Clark, DLS, and others step out in faith. They have overcome incredible obstacles and persevered to advance classical Christian education in needed places. But, why do we have to have our own version of Waiting for Superman when the resources are right in front of us?\n\nThank you to Dr. Geoffrey Boyle for this review of CCLE's Adopting Classical Lutheran Education: A Guide for Educators: \"Starting a new habit is easier than breaking an old one. And when it comes to schools, one might argue that it‚Äôs easier to start a new school than to turn an old one around. Raising money and finding a building are huge undertakings. But changing the ethos and mindset of a faculty, parents, and students‚Äîthat‚Äôs monumental. Nevertheless, many schools are embarking on just that mission. But how? Classical Lutheran education encompasses much more than just adding a class in Latin or reading older books. It‚Äôs a way of life, a set of instincts that runs its tentacles through every facet of the school. The transition from our parochial use of progressive education to a truly classical Lutheran education requires the grace of God, deep and thoughtful commitment, and a great deal of help from those who‚Äôve trodden this path before. That‚Äôs what Adopting Classical Lutheran Education: A Guide for Educators seeks to provide. After defining the need and offering help along the way to articulate what we‚Äôre seeking to adopt, the CCLE provides the necessary steps for how to make the transition. From the organizational structure of the school board and the aesthetic design of the classrooms to a thorough revision of the curriculum and its refinement through accreditation, this book seeks to apply the truth, goodness, and beauty of the liberal arts and Lutheran catechesis to the whole task of education. But it‚Äôs not just theory. The stories of those who‚Äôve already turned the ship reveal both the tremendous difficulties faced, as well as the hope and encouragement that it can be done‚Äîand done well! If you‚Äôre starting from scratch, have at it! But for those looking to break an old habit or turn a school back to its classical Lutheran heritage, this book is for you. Read it with your teachers and board members, your pastor and elders. Then join the countless churches and schools in the great task of adopting classical Lutheran education.\" Get your copy here: https://lnkd.in/gEunKQBT #ccle\n\nConfidence in our Mission! Catholic schools change lives! Do we really believe that? Then let‚Äôs say so, boldly and directly. Cocky? No! Here's why: In the story of blind Bartemaeus from the gospels, Bartemaues shouts out from a distance: ‚ÄúJesus, have pity on me!‚Äù Jesus hears him, but doesn‚Äôt go to him. Instead, he tells the apostles, ‚ÄúGo bring him to me.‚Äù So the apostles go to him and say, ‚ÄúTake courage, get up, Jesus is calling you.‚Äù And they bring him to Jesus, who heals him. We are ‚Äúministers, not messiahs,‚Äù as the Bishop Hunthausen prayer reminds us. We are not the ones who heal. Instead, we are the ones who say to our students, ‚ÄúTake courage! Get up, Jesus is calling you!‚Äù Our mission is to bring students to the Lord. Our confidence is not based on some egotistical belief in ourselves, but in the faith we have in Christ to change the lives of those we bring to him. Too often we project the opposite, especially if we‚Äôre struggling for enrollment or if our financial margins are thin: ‚ÄúOur hands are tied,‚Äù we say. Or ‚ÄúWe would if we could, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Our rhetoric limps. We stop dreaming. Unwittingly, we communicate to families that we are puny, and don‚Äôt have the \"power\" to fulfill our mission. We make this mistake, too, when we set our tuitions low. I know we do that out of our concern for our poorest families, and it's partly our legacy from the sisters, who worked heroically for very little pay. But if we present ourselves as the ‚ÄúDollar General‚Äù of educational choices, people will regard us as Dollar Generals. In a free market economy, people equate price with quality. I believe the path forward is to step-ladder to mid-market tuition rates, coupled with generous financial aid, ‚Äúelevating‚Äù our brand and paying our teachers better as we do so. Do we know that small schools generally out-perform larger ones? The data is consistent and widely available. At St. Michael, a school of just 350 students, I linked those research studies to our web site. Small schools know students in a personal way that is nearly impossible for larger schools. When we give tours to prospective families, for example, we should be deliberate in interacting with students: ‚ÄúGood hit yesterday, Johnny.‚Äù ‚ÄúNice point you made in class this morning, Bill.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was so excited to watch you at the ballet last weekend, Susie.‚Äù Help parents understand if they send their children to our schools, we will know them personally. I am not an expert in the martial arts, but my understanding is that ‚Äújujitsu‚Äù teaches people to use their smaller, more nimble size as an advantage, keeping their larger opponents off balance, using their own momentum against them. Smaller schools need to practice jujitsu! We‚Äôre often modest, to a fault. If we‚Äôre not loud, direct and bold about the power of our schools to change lives, our voices will be drowned out in the noisy marketplace. Let‚Äôs walk with a little strut and swagger in our step!\n\nA Catholic ‚ÄúPrep School‚Äù? A critic of Pope John Paul II High School, a young diocesan school I led in Nashville for seven years, once told me, ‚ÄúWe were trying to create a Catholic Montgomery Bell Academy.‚Äù M.B.A. is a well regarded private school in Nashville. He intended the remark as a stinging rebuke‚Äîthat in so doing, we were betraying our mission. My response, to his surprise, was ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I believe it is entirely possible to be a first tier ‚Äúprep school‚Äù and to be thoroughly Catholic at the same time. Most of the Jesuit high schools in this country would be so characterized, as would many other schools led by religious orders. But is it possible for a diocesan school to be both? I think so. The sticky points are access and faith. Most ‚Äúelite‚Äù private schools are exclusive, primarily a function of their tuitions. According to its own data, National Association of Independent Schools have an average high school tuition of $30,000/year. They are also ‚Äúselective‚Äù in their admissions, though I believe for many it is less rigorous than they lead people to believe. Most ‚Äúaverage ability‚Äù kids can get in, particularly if they‚Äôre from well connected families. The illusion of selectivity is helpful for marketing and ‚Äúbrand.‚Äú The purpose of a diocesan school, in contrast, is to serve the Church, in all of its splendored diversity, both socio-economic and academic. So we cannot be ‚Äúexclusive.‚Äù But if we can aim tuitions to mid-market rates and create robust financial aid programs to assist families who cannot afford these rates, and if we can offer two levels of academic programs, honors and non-honors, then I believe our admissions efforts can be broadly tailored. And of course, we must be thoroughly, fundamentally Catholic. Our success isn‚Äôt ultimately measured by AP results, test scores, or college acceptances, but by whether we are creating disciples‚Äîyoung men and women of faith, wisdom and charity. But if access and mission are sound, I see nothing at all wrong with being a ‚ÄúCatholic M.B.A.‚Äù In fact, I believe that may even be a high compliment."
