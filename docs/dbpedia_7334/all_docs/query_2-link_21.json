        "text": "By: OCC Staff\n\nNovember 2020\n\nA subset of the 50 Best Christian Colleges and Universities is presented for your benefit. For certain reasons, a specific region is selected to pursue higher education; Online Christian Colleges and Universities provides a detailed review of schools that are deliberately Christian in their Mission, Values and Vision. Most provide a wide range of degree programs and offer a top-notch education. Our desire is to be one source (of several) of valuable information to help the student and family reach a decision that is well reasoned and appropriate for the student’s aspirations and goals.\n\nThe Methodology used in this ranking is the same as was used for the 50 Best Christian Colleges and Universities ranking, but the geography was filtered to only feature schools in the north-northeastern part of the country. Elements analyzed were: Student/Faculty Ratio, Financial Aid, Exclusivity (Admission Rate), Retention Rate and Graduation Rate. Equal weight was given to each element, and the totals were compiled into a Preliminary Ranking. This was further reviewed and tie scores were settled by comparing net cost and the presence of financial aid (% of students who receive aid).\n\n10 Malone University\n\nCanton, Ohio\n\nCleveland Bible College was founded in 1892 by Walter and Emma Malone as a co-educational Bible school affiliated with the religious Society of Friends. In 1956 the school relocated some 60 miles south to Canton, Ohio and changed its name to Malone College in honor of its founders. Canton, once famous for a booming steel industry and the inception of professional football transitioned its economy into a more service-oriented environment with education, finance and healthcare; the small city keeps a close connection with the National Football League, serving as host city of the NFL Hall of Fame. Like its home city, Malone College changed over time as well, growing into a university in 2008 and changing its religious affiliation to the Evangelical Friends Church-Eastern Region. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) as well as five other undergraduate educational accrediting bodies and offers over 75 undergraduate degrees through its four schools: College of Theology, Arts, and Sciences, School of Nursing and Health Sciences, School of Business and Leadership and School of Education and Human Development.\n\nThe 1,667 strong student body consists of 1,311 undergraduate students and over 350 graduate degree program candidates. The student-to-faculty ratio is a very desirable 11 to 1. Estimated tuition cost is $29,422, and around 89% of starting, full-time students receive at least one form of student financial aid. The admission rate into Malone University is 73% while the retention rate is a strong 79%; the graduation rate of 53%. Malone University’s public Mission statement says the school’s purpose is “to provide students with an education based on biblical faith in order to develop men and women in intellectual maturity, wisdom, and Christian faith who are committed to serving the church, community, and world.”\n\n9 Roberts Wesleyan College\n\nRochester, NY\n\nRoberts Wesleyan College, situated in the northern reaches of upstate New York, is a Christian liberal arts school that was founded in 1869. Set in the outskirts of Rochester near the banks of Lake Ontario, students at Roberts Wesleyan College experience the northern climate at its strongest. Ultimately named for its founder, Benjamin T Roberts, the school was established as Chili Seminary before it was changed, first to AM Chesbrough Seminary in 1885, and then to Roberts Junior College in 1945. Four years after that change, the school was granted a charter from New York State and commenced offering 4-year degrees, changing its name one last time. A self-described “community of learners committed to historic Christianity,” Roberts Wesleyan College states its Mission as a school that “seeks to prepare thoughtful, spiritually mature, service-oriented people who will help transform society.” The College maintains accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and has ongoing affiliations with the Council of Christian Colleges & Universities, the Council of Independent Colleges, and the Association of Free Methodist Educational Institutions among others. The College currently offers undergraduate degrees in 60 fields of study in addition to 11 online programs and 16 graduate programs. Academic departments include Art, Business, Communication, Computer Science, Criminal Justice, Education, Engineering, History, Language & Literature, Math, Ministry, Music, Nursing, Physics, Pre-Health, Psychology, Science, and Social Work.\n\nThe total student body population consists of nearly 1,700, of whom just over 1,300 are undergraduate students and over 375 are graduate degree candidates. The school boasts a solid 13 to 1 student-to-faculty ratio; the estimated tuition cost is $29,540 and 100% of starting, full-time students receive at least one form of financial aid. A fairly selective institution, Roberts Wesleyan College accepts 65% of applicants and has a 75% retention rate as well as a reasonable 59% graduation rate.\n\n8 Messiah College\n\nMechanicsburg, PA\n\nCentral Pennsylvania is the ruggedly beautiful backdrop that provides the setting for Messiah College. Just 12 miles from the state capitol of Harrisburg, Messiah College is situated south of Mechanicsburg amid wooded areas and open fields adding to the rustic natural beauty of the campus. This Christian liberal arts college was founded in 1909 by the Brethren in Christ Church and maintains the school motto: “Christ Preeminent.” The school’s stated Mission is “to educate men and women toward maturity of intellect, character and Christian faith in preparation for lives of service, leadership and reconciliation in church and society.” Its Brethren roots do not limit the institution, as the population of students, faculty and staff come from a variety of Protestant Christian backgrounds. Messiah College is made up of six schools: the School of the Arts, the School of Business, Education and Social Sciences, the School of Graduate Studies, the School of the Humanities, and the School of Science, Engineering and Health; it is these individual schools that confer the over 150 undergraduate degrees in 80 distinct majors as well as 27 graduate degrees and Certificate programs. In addition, there is a 3-year degree option, College Honors Program and summer online studies adding to the school’s educational offerings.\n\nThe 2,788 undergraduate students and over 500 graduate degree candidates, hailing from over 36 states and more than 31 international countries, appreciate the student-to-faculty ratio of 13 to 1. To further demonstrate the diversity of the student body, over 13% of the population are from traditionally under-represented people groups (along racial, ethnic and cultural identities). The College eagerly supports study abroad programs as evidenced by the 90% participation rate of undergraduate students. Estimated tuition expense is $33,180, and 100% of starting, full-time matriculants receive at least one form of financial aid. Messiah has an 80% acceptance rate and a strong retention rate of 85%. Equally positive is the robust graduation rate of 76%.\n\n7 Eastern University\n\nSt Davids, Pennsylvania\n\nSituated just outside of Philadelphia’s Main Line neighborhoods is St Davids, Pennsylvania, home to Eastern University’s main campus. Beyond the 114-acre headquarters, Eastern University maintains other campus locations in Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Ripley, West Virginia; and Rwanda, Africa. All locations have the same focus and purpose: to integrate faith, reason and justice for its students. Affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA, Eastern University has an interdenominational Christian population of students, staff and faculty. This coeducational university sets forth a mission statement indicating that the school is “dedicated through teaching, scholarship, service, spiritual formation, student development and societal involvement to the preparation of undergraduate, graduate and Seminary students for thoughtful and productive lives of Christian faith and service.” Eastern University includes several colleges and a seminary, specifically the College of Business and Leadership, the College of Education, the College of Health and Social Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Templeton Honors College, Esperanza College and Palmer Theological Seminary. These schools offer Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Social Work, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration, Master of Science, Master of Education, Master of Theological Studies, Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Arts, Doctor of Ministry degrees.\n\nEven though the student population is larger than many “small” schools, the 2,082 undergrads and over 1,300 graduate students appreciate the low student-to-faculty ratio of 10 to 1. Estimated tuition expense is $31,140; to offset that cost, 100% of starting, full-time students receive at least one form of financial aid. Eastern University is rather selective in its admissions, only 61% of applicants are accepted; the high retention rate of 78% and overall graduation rate of 58% reflect well on the university.\n\n6 Waynesburg University\n\nWaynesburg Pennsylvania\n\nWaynesburg University, located in Waynesburg Pennsylvania, in the southwestern corner of the state. The school, named for the renowned Revolutionary War general ‘Mad’ Anthony Wayne, was founded in 1849 by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Pennsylvania chartered the school in 1850. It remains an independent, private Christian university to this day. The school’s stated mission is to prepare students to “make connections between faith, learning and serving so that they might faithfully transform their communities and the world” – this idea is formalized in the university’s Mission Statement: “As a Christian comprehensive University, we strive to inspire and challenge every undergraduate and graduate student to a life of leadership and purpose for the glory of God.” Even the school motto, Fiat Lux, means ‘let there be light’ which is a nod to Genesis chapter 1 verse 3. Accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Waynesburg University offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of programs. Areas of study include business, communication, criminal justice, education, forensic science and nursing.\n\nAmong the less expensive private universities in the area and the nation, Waynesburg’s estimated tuition expense is approximately $22,800; the school acknowledges that 99% of starting, full-time students receive at least one form of financial aid as scholarships, grants or government-sponsored student aid programs. Waynesburg University is one of 21 schools in the nation to participate in the Bonner Scholar Program, whereby an estimated 15 students are awarded community service scholarships each year. The student body comprises 1,400 undergraduate students and over 400 graduate program candidates; the low student-to-faculty ratio of 12 to 1 is an asset to a student’s education. Statistics speak well of the school: they have a 94% admission rate, a retention rate of 75% (for full-time students) and a strong graduation rate of 60%\n\n5 Gordon College\n\nWenham, Massachusetts\n\nBetween Salem and Gloucester, Massachusetts lies the hamlet of Wenham. Not far from the coast in this little village is the beautiful campus of Gordon College. This private, non-denominational Christian liberal arts and sciences college is determined to “graduate men and women distinguished by intellectual maturity and Christian character, committed to lives of service and prepared for leadership worldwide.” Gordon College achieves this by providing students “the ability to think holistically, reason analytically, communicate persuasively and – even more importantly – to act morally.” Gordon College is affiliated with organizations including the Council of Independent Colleges, the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. Not only is the school committed to the integration of faith and learning, Gordon College is also dedicated to offering students a liberal arts education to develop the qualities that are sought-after by employers. The College takes this responsibility seriously as it determined to “prepare students for the long haul, to make them spiritually, intellectually, relationally and professionally ready for a lifetime of growth—from the first job out of college and beyond, into fields not yet existing.”\n\n38 undergraduate majors, 39 minors and 12 interdisciplinary and professional minors are offered by Gordon College; the campus also hosts several centers and institutions, including the Association of Christian Economists, the Barrington Center for the Arts, The Hermann Lectures on Faith and Science, the La Vida Center for Outdoor Education and Leadership, and the Institute for Public History.

It is also home to a number of highly ranked Christian colleges and universities. Grove City College demonstrates the best of the region with a spacious, picturesque campus, respected degree programs and a long history of providing Christian higher education.

Since 1884 the school has been chartered as Grove City College and has offered advanced degrees ever since. Fiercely independent, the school accepts no federal financial aid. In the college’s perspective, this allows them “to be the best Christian liberal arts college in America” and to “develop leaders of the highest proficiency, purpose, and principles ready to advance the common good” without being beholden to the civil magistrate. Grove City’s stated mission is to allow “students to pursue their unique callings through an academically excellent and Christ-centered learning and living experience distinguished by a commitment to affordability and its promotion of the Christian worldview, the foundations of free society, and the love of neighbor.”\n\nTwo main departments, Arts & Letters and Science, Engineering & Mathematics provide undergraduate degree programs.
