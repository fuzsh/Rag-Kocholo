        "text": "Religious Affiliation: Christian, Christian Churches and Churches of Christ While the student experience is largely unaffected at most schools with religious affiliations, some schools place more of an emphasis on religion. Learn how religious affiliations may impact students' experience.\n\nAcceptance Rate Insight\n\nThis school has a competitive acceptance rate.\n\nThis school is a little more selective about its students. Competitive acceptance schools welcome 15-50% of all applicants.\n\n48% of students were accepted during the 2021-2022 school year. Sometimes schools with midrange acceptance rates have higher standards of entry but are still accessible to many students who apply.\n\nRetention Rate Insight\n\n36% of full-time students stayed to continue their studies the following academic year. These students started in Fall 2020 and returned in Fall 2021.\n\nGraduation Rate Insight\n\n44% of students graduated out of all full-time, first-time students who began their studies in Fall 2015. Keep in mind many students who enroll are not typically first-time students, as most are adult learners. Therefore, the number of first-time students is traditionally low."
