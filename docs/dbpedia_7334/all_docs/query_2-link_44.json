The office does not have fixed office hours, but assistance is available by calling 806.928.6803. Administrative services are also available in the Student Life Office during regular LCU business hours.\n\nMotorist assist (boosts and air)\n\nEscorts to and from locations\n\nCrime prevention and awareness\n\nInvestigation of crimes and incidents that occur on campus\n\nLost and Found\n\nReporting an Incident or Crime\n\nThe Lubbock Christian University Police Department (LCUPD) encourages accurate and prompt reporting of all criminal offenses.\n\nTo report an non-criminal incident or suspicious activities, please call 806.928.6803.\n\nTo report a crime, please call Lubbock Police Department Dispatch at 806.775.2865.\n\nEmergencies should always be reported by dialing 911.\n\nWhen reporting an non-criminal incident that has occurred on campus, contact the LCU Public Safety Department (LCUDPS) at 806.928.6803. The Public Safety Officer on duty will assist the caller with connections to campus services and officials. Additionally, the Public Safety Officer on duty will provide the caller with information regarding resources (on and off campus) that may be helpful to the caller.\n\nAll University individuals designated as a Campus Security Authority (CSA) is required to report any crimes or alleged crimes to the Director of Public Safety within 48 business hours.\n\nA CSA is a Clery Act-specific term that encompasses four groups of individuals and organizations associated with an institution. The four groups include the following:\n\nA campus police department or a campus security department of an institution.\n\nAny individual or individuals who have responsibility for campus security but who do not constitute a campus police department or a campus security department (e.g., an individual who is responsible for monitoring the entrance into institutional property). Include individuals such as those who provide security at a campus parking kiosk, monitor access into a campus facility, act as event security, such as for sporting events or large, registered parties, or escort students around campus after dark (including other students).\n\nAny individual or organization specified in an institution’s statement of campus security policy as an individual or organization to which students and employees should report criminal offenses.\n\nAn official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings (includes student organization and fraternity or sorority advisors and co-advisors).\n\nLubbock Christian University does not have a policy or practice in place that allows for victims or witnesses to officially report crimes (other than Title IX complaints) on a voluntary, confidential basis. Crimes reported to the counseling center are confidential and not disclosed in the University’s crime statistics or reporting processes.\n\nSex Offender Registry\n\nThe federal Campus Sexual Crimes Prevention Act requires institutions of higher education to issue a statement advising the campus community where law enforcement agency information provided by a state may be obtained concerning registered sex offenders. It also compels sex offenders, already required to register in a state, to provide notice under state law of each institution of higher education in the state at which the person is employed, carries on a vocation or is a student.\n\nThe act amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 to clarify that nothing in the act may be construed to prohibit an educational institution from disclosing information provided to the institution concerning registered sex offenders and requires the Secretary of Education to take appropriate steps to notify educational institutions that disclosure of this information is permitted.\n\nState law requires persons convicted of or placed on deferred community supervision for certain offenses to register as sex offenders. Offenders who committed “sexually violent” offenses (most contact offenses) must register for the remainder of their life, even after completing probation or parole. Others (some non-contact offenses) may cease registering ten years after completing their term of supervision.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities are required to inform the University when registered sex offenders indicate that are living, working, or volunteering services on campus. To learn whether information of this nature has been provided to the University, contact the LCU Police Department at 5601 19th Street, Student Union Building, Room 201 or call 806.720.7521.\n\nYou can access the sex offender registration files for free of charge through the Texas Department of Public Safety webpage - https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/crime-records-service/texas-sex-offender-registration-program\n\nLimitations on Campus Housing\n\nIn 2017, the Texas Legislature added the following section related to sex offender residence in campus housing (Chapter 62 of the Code of Criminal Procedure):\n\nArt. 62.064. PROHIBITED LOCATION OF RESIDENCE. A person subject to registration under this chapter may not reside on the campus of a public or private institution of higher education unless:\n\nthe person is assigned a numeric risk level of one based on an assessment conducted using the sex offender screening tool developed or selected under Article 62.007; and\n\nthe institution approves the person to reside on the institution's campus.\n\nRegistered Sex Offender Notification\n\nIn accordance with the \"Campus Sex Crime Prevention Act\" that provides for the tracking of convicted registered sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher education or working on college campuses, Lubbock Christian University is providing the following website to the college community to search by name or location: Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nOnce your status on campus has been established (accepted as an LCU student), please contact the LCU Chief of Police to establish a time for registry. You may do so by e-mailing publicsafety@lcu.edu or setting up an appointment within the Student Life Office.\n\nCrime Report\n\nThe LCU Department of Public Safety publishes the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report (ASR), which includes information about LCU Public Safety & the Lubbock Christian University Police Department (LCUPD), how to report a crime, LCUPD’s crime prevention programs, substance abuse, sensitive crimes, emergency notifications, timely warnings, and other important information about security and LCU Public Safety’s services on campus. In order to comply, LCU must record all crimes occurring on campus on a yearly basis, in consultation with the Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, LCU Student Life Office, and other LCU Departments.\n\nThe ASR contains three years of statistics on reported campus or campus-related crimes. A hard copy may be obtained by contacting the LCU Student Life Office during LCU Business hours at 806.720.7501 or by e-mail: PublicSafety@LCU.edu.\n\nThe Clery Act also requires Lubbock Christian University to inform all prospective students and employees about the availability of the ASR. To comply with this aspect of the law, all notices have been placed on various LCU websites and in some cases on LCU materials.\n\nThe most current crime report statistics and ASR are available at LCU: Clery Reports.\n\nEmergency Management\n\nLCU maintains an Emergency Operations Plan which outlines LCU's approach to emergency operations. It provides general guidance for emergency management, activities, and a general overview of our methods of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The plan describes our emergency response, organization, and assigns responsibilities for various emergency tasks.\n\nEmergency Notification (LCUAlert)\n\nIn the event of an emergency (including weather and safety alerts), LCU will utilize a number of communication tools and strategies to communicate with the campus community. Depending upon the nature of the announcement, any or all of the following methods may be used:\n\nSMS, Text-messaging, voice call, and email alert system - email sign up is automatic, but students are encouraged to update their information through the Student Portal as it changes\n\nCampus wide phone/intercom messages\n\nLCUAlert will be used for emergency communication only. Students may update their LCUAlert contact information at any time, through the Student Portal. For more information, see the LCU Public Safety Website.\n\nActive Shooter Event\n\nCall 911 as soon as it is safe to do so.\n\nRemember the 3D technique:\n\nDISTANCE - yourself or evacuate if there is a safe path.\n\nDENY - shooter's access.\n\nDEFEND - yourself using any means necessary.\n\nLockdown\n\nSoft Lockdown\n\nSecure exit doors and remain inside\n\nHave staff monitor doors\n\nIncrease awareness and conduct business as usual\n\nHard Lockdown\n\nLock doors if possible; if not, barricade with tables and chairs\n\nClose curtains and blinds\n\nStay away from windows and doors\n\nStay low and quiet\n\nSilence all devices\n\nDo not open until all is clear\n\nBomb Threat\n\nIf a bomb threat is called in to your area:\n\nRemain Calm\n\nListen to the caller’s exact words and instructions\n\nCheck the caller ID for the number of the caller\n\nKeep the caller on the line and discreetly ask someone else to call 911 with the information\n\nRemember any unusual or identifying characteristics of the caller\n\nFire\n\nIn case of a fire, be prepared by knowing the location of exits and extinguishers.\n\nMinor Fire\n\nIf the fire is controllable, direct the extinguisher toward the base of the flame and sweep side to side.\n\nIf there is ANY doubt, pull the fire alarm and call 911.\n\nEvacuate the building.\n\nMajor Fire\n\nPull the fire alarm.\n\nEvacuate the building.\n\nCall 911 as soon as it is safe.\n\nPsychological Crisis\n\nA psychological crisis occurs when an individual is threatening harm to himself/herself or to others or is out of touch with reality.\n\nCall LCU Public Safety at 806.928.6803 stating you have a potential psychological or mental health crisis.\n\nTry to keep the person calm and within your vision until assistance arrives.\n\nMaintain your own personal safety if you feel the situation is dangerous.\n\nIf there are obvious medical complications, call 911, and then LCU Public Safety.\n\nSevere Weather\n\nIn the event of a Tornado or Severe Weather emergency, LCU Public Safety will issue an alert through LCUAlert. If on campus you will be directed to take cover.\n\nTornado Watch\n\nBe mindful of the weather.\n\nBe aware of options.\n\nBe ready to move.\n\nTornado Warning\n\nGo to the ground floor.\n\nGo to an interior area (like an office or bathroom free of windows).\n\nGo now! Don't wait!\n\nAs situations and emergencies often arise in an unpredictable manner, LCU recommends you use caution and judgment regarding your personal safety.\n\nLost and Found\n\nThe Lost and Found is located in the LCU Public Safety Office in the SUB Room 206. Questions may be referred to the Public Safety Patrol number at 806.928.6803 or by emailing PublicSafety@LCU.edu.\n\nMissing Persons\n\nUniversity missing person procedures apply to students who reside on campus and are deemed missing or absent from LCU for a period of at least 24 hours without a known reason.\n\nIn addition to registering a general emergency contact, all students residing in an on-campus student housing facility have the option to annually identify a contact person or person to be notified if the student is determined to be missing by Lubbock Christian University and/or a law enforcement agency. The contact information will be confidential, accessible only by authorized campus officials and law enforcement and may not be disclosed outside of a missing person investigation.\n\nWhen a student who resides in an on-campus student housing facility is determined to have been missing for 24-hours, the University will:\n\nNotify the person designated by the student to be contacted (if one has been designated) within 24-hours if student is determined to be missing\n\nNotify a parent within 24-hours if the student is under 18 years old and is not emancipated\n\nInform the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area that the student is missing within 24-hours, unless the local law enforcement agency was the entity that made the determination that the student was missing. Regardless of whether the student has identified a contact person, is above the age of 18, or is an emancipated minor, notification to the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area that the student is missing must be made within 24-hours.\n\nThese procedures and registration process are communicated when moving into campus housing and at the beginning of each academic year. A student who wishes to identify a confidential contact can do so through the Missing Person Contact Form and/or at anytime by notifying the Resident Director in charge of that facility.\n\nIf a member of the Lubbock Christian University campus community has reason to believe that a student is missing, they should immediately notify Lubbock Christian University Public Safety at 806.928.6803.\n\nRoller Blades, Skateboards, Hoverboards and Bicycles\n\nRoller blades, skateboards, hoverboards, and bicycles are only permitted on sidewalks and are for outside transportation only. Excessive speed, stunts, tricks, or jumps are prohibited on campus property.\n\nBicyclists, rollerbladers, and skateboarders are also reminded that sidewalks are primarily utilized by pedestrians; however, they must remain on hard pavements. Tricks, stunts, or jumps are not allowed.\n\nBicycles are not required to be registered; however, when not in use they must be secured to a cycle rack provided on campus. LCU Public Safety encourages the use of a two-lock locking system with the inclusion of a U-shaped Lock with a thick self-locking cable.\n\nLCU Public Safety encourages owners to register their Bicycles with the department. This may be done by providing a name, contact information, serial number, as well as a picture and/or description of the bicycle.\n\nTraffic and Parking Policy\n\nStudents are expected to be familiar with and abide by the regulations set forth in this handbook. LCU Public Safety is responsible for establishing and enforcing guidelines for the use of any parking area on university property that could be used for parking even if not specifically designated for parking. Such areas include, but are not limited to, athletic fields, driveways, loading areas, and lawns.\n\nStudents using private vehicles on campus consent to search of the vehicle while on campus and agree to obey city, county, state, and federal traffic laws and regulations. The university does not provide insurance for personal vehicles or their contents.\n\nLCU assumes no responsibility for stolen property or damage to any vehicle or its contents while the vehicle is being operated or parked on campus.\n\nStudents must register their vehicles with the LCU Public Safety office each academic year. Students can obtain a parking permit at the ChapDesk, and display the current parking decal on their vehicles and park in those areas designated for use by their decal. The decal should be placed on the outside of the back window in the lower left corner. For convertibles, the decal needs to be placed in the front window in the lower right corner. Motorcycles are not required to have a parking permit; however, they need to be registered. Commuters may contact the office to obtain parking permits for additional vehicles.\n\nParking Fines\n\n$20.00 – No valid parking permit; parking where prohibited by sign; parking in an unauthorized area (red curb, blue curb or striped zone); improperly parked in a slot; obstructing traffic\n\n$50.00 – Parking in areas marked for handicap parking\n\nVehicles parked on LCU property without a permit will be issued a ticket. Tickets will be placed on the student account and must be paid in the Student Business Office.\n\nThe person in whose name the permit is issued will be held responsible for that vehicle. A parking ticket is not excused on the plea that another person was driving the vehicle at the time the vehicle was cited.\n\nThe university reserves the right to remove and impound vehicles left abandoned, any vehicle without license plates, or any vehicle parked in a way that constitutes a serious hazard to vehicle or pedestrian traffic. The owner of any vehicle that is stalled or disabled on any part of the university campus must notify the LCU Public Safety office immediately.\n\nThe owners will be responsible for any fees involving the removing, impounding, and storing of their vehicles.\n\nParking Permits\n\nParking permits are required for all students parking on campus. You can obtain a parking permit at ChapDesk. Each permit has a color designation for parking permissions on campus. Students receive a copy of these permissions as well as an outlined map when they receive their permit. Permissions and maps may also be found on the public safety page of LCU.edu.\n\nA color-coded system is used for parking on campus. Please observe the following:\n\nBlue Curb: Handicap Parking only (Fines of $500 are regularly issued)\n\nRed Curb: Fire Zone – No parking at any time\n\nSidewalks: No parking at any time\n\nParking Ticket Appeal\n\nTickets are to be paid in the Student Business Office. If you wish to contest a ticket, you must submit an email (Michael.Smith@LCU.edu) to the Director of Public Safety within 5 business days of receiving the ticket. The written appeal must specify grounds that would justify consideration. General dissatisfaction with the policy or an appeal for mercy is not an appropriate basis for an appeal.\n\nProhibited Driving Areas\n\nCampus service roads and sidewalks are to be utilized only by emergency and maintenance vehicles.\n\nMotorcycles and motorized scooters are not to be operated on sidewalks for any reason.\n\nSolicitation\n\nCampus property cannot be used for commercial or solicitation purposes.

The university is not responsible for any injuries incurred by a student. The university does not assume responsibility for or insure student property that is lost, damaged, or stolen. Students are advised to lock their rooms at all times, leave valuable property at home, and not keep large amounts of cash in their rooms. Lost or stolen keys should be reported immediately to the residence hall supervisor. Students assume responsibility to insure their personal property.\n\nI. Introductory Statement\n\nLCU affirms that all members of our community are created in the image of God and therefore should be treated with dignity and respect. The university does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of any status or condition protected by applicable federal or state law, including race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or disability. LCU respects the inherent worth of each member of the community and does not tolerate any form of harassment. The university follows the profound truth that is found in the Golden Rule, \"In everything do to others as you would have them do to you\" (Matthew 7:12). Because of the university's commitment to honoring the dignity and respect of every individual, unlawful discrimination and harassment (and any related retaliation) is prohibited and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal or separation from the University. LCU affirms its commitment to protecting the right of each person to raise concerns about alleged discrimination free of fear of retaliation.\n\nTherefore, because the university stands against harassing and violent behaviors, the university will take prompt, decisive action to: investigate allegations of violence, harassment, and stalking; initiate the disciplinary process if appropriate; issue appropriate sanctions against any student or employee found responsible for acts of violence whether the behavior occurred on campus or off campus; take steps designed to prevent recurrence; and protect against retaliation.\n\nStudents or employees are encouraged to report any incidents related to this policy and pursue the matter through the state's civil and/or criminal systems as well as through the university. A student who in good faith reports being the victim of, or a witness to an incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking may not be subject to disciplinary action for violation(s) of the Code of Community Standards occurring at or near the time of the incident.\n\nPursuant to Title IX, LCU does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its educational programs and activities. Reports of sexual misconduct may be made to the Interim Title IX Coordinator, Kaili Hutchinson at 806.720.7503 or any of the other campus resources listed in paragraph III of this policy.\n\nNote: This sexual misconduct policy shall not be used to bring frivolous or malicious complaints against students, faculty and employees. If a complaint has been made in bad faith, as demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence, disciplinary action may be taken against the person bringing the complaint.\n\nII. Definitions\n\nA. Sexual Misconduct: A broad, non-legal term encompassing a range of non-consensual sexual activity or unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature. This term includes, but is not limited to, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual intimidation, sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Sexual misconduct can be committed by men or women, strangers or acquaintances, and can occur between or among people of the same or opposite sex. Using this term serves to differentiate campus processes, which are administrative and educational, from the criminal justice system, in which people are charged with crimes that carry criminal penalty.\n\nB. Sexual harassment as defined by 34 C.F.R.106.30, subd. (a), means conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\n\nAn employee of the recipient conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the recipient on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;\n\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity; or\n\n“Sexual assault” as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), “dating violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10), “domestic violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8), or “stalking” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30).\n\nC. Sexual Violence: Physical sexual acts perpetuated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent. The term includes, but is not limited to, rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual coercion, sexual abuse, indecency with a child, and/or aggravated assault.\n\nD. Sexual Assault: An offense that meets the definition of rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape as used in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. Any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by federal or state law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.\n\nRape: the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\n\nFondling: The touching of the private body part of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity.\n\nIncest: Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.\n\nStatutory Rape: Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.\n\nSexual Assault in Texas is jurisdictionally defined in Section 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code.\n\nE. Sexual Exploitation: Occurs when an individual takes non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another to benefit anyone other than the one being exploited. Examples of exploitation include, but are not limited to: engaging in voyeurism; forwarding of pornographic or other sexually inappropriate material by email, text, or other channels to non-consenting students/groups; and any activity that goes beyond the boundaries of consent, such as recording of sexual activity, allowing others to watch activity or situations of sexual nature without the other person's consent, or engaging in sexual activity while knowingly infected with an STI of HIV without informing the other person of the infection.\n\nF. Coercion: The use of expressed or implied threat or intimidation which places an individual in reasonable fear of immediate harm or physical injury.\n\nG. Consent: An informed, voluntary, and mutually understandable agreement that indicates a clear willingness to engage in each instance of sexual activity. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another. A current or previous dating relationship or sexual relationship by itself is not sufficient to constitute consent. Consent may not be implied by silence or mere passivity and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent is not valid if acquired through means of physical force, threat of physical force, intimidation, coercion, intoxication, incapacitation, or any other fact that would eliminate an individual's ability to exercise his or her own free will to choose whether or not to participate in a sexual activity.\n\nConsent in Texas is jurisdictionally defined in Section 1.07 and outlined in Section 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code.\n\nH. Incapacitation: The inability, temporarily or permanently, to give consent because the individual is mentally and/or physically helpless, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or the individual is unconscious, asleep, or otherwise unaware that the sexual activity is occurring. A person is mentally incapacitated when that person lacks the ability to make informed decisions about whether or not to engage in sexual activity. A person may be incapacitated as a result of the consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs, or due to a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition. When alcohol or other drug use is involved, incapacitation is a state beyond intoxication, impairment, or being under the influence. Alcohol and other drugs impact each individual differently and determining whether an individual is incapacitated requires an individualized determination. Although every individual may manifest the impacts of alcohol or other drugs differently, typical signs include slurred or incomprehensible speech, unsteady gait, combativeness, emotional volatility, vomiting, or incontinence.\n\nI. Domestic Violence: A felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by\n\nA current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; or\n\nA person with whom the victim shares a child in common; or\n\nA person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; or\n\nAny other person against a victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the State of Texas\n\nDomestic violence in Texas is termed \"Family Violence.\"\n\nJ. Dating Violence: Violence committed by a person\n\nWho is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim\n\nWhere the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors:\n\nThe length of the relationship; or\n\nThe type of relationship; or\n\nThe frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship\n\nI. Stalking: Engaging in a course of conduct, constituted by two or more acts directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to\n\nFear for his or her safety or the safety of others; or\n\nSuffer substantial emotional stress; or\n\nFeel harassed, alarmed, abused, or tormented\n\nJ. Hostile Environment: When sex-based harassment or violence is directed toward an individual and/or has the purpose or effect of\n\nCreating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive academic environment; or\n\nUnreasonably interferes with another's work or academic performance\n\nTo determine whether a hostile environment exists for an individual or individuals, the University will consider a variety of factors related to the severity, persistence, or pervasiveness of the sex-based harassment, including:\n\nThe type, frequency, and duration of the conduct\n\nThe identity and relationships of the persons involved\n\nThe number of individuals involved\n\nThe locations of the conduct and the context in which it occurred\n\nThe degree to which the conduct affected an individual's education or employment\n\nThe more severe the sex-based harassment, the less need there is to show a repetitive series of incidents to create a hostile environment. A single instance of violence may be sufficient to create a hostile environment.\n\nK. Retaliation: Retaliation against persons who report or provide information about sexual misconduct is strictly prohibited. Any acts of reprisal, including internal interference, coercion, or restraint by a student, a university employee, or one acting on behalf of the university, violates this policy and will result in appropriate disciplinary action.\n\nIII. Reporting Harassment/Violence/Stalking\n\nThe university encourages the reporting of all incidents involving sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. If the university knows or reasonably should know about an incident of sexual harassment or sexual violence that creates a hostile environment, the university will take immediate action to eliminate the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects. To be proactive, the university publishes a notice of nondiscrimination and has adopted and published grievance procedures. In cases involving potential criminal conduct, the Title IX Coordinator or designee will determine, consistent with state and local law, whether appropriate law enforcement or other authorities should be notified. Reports may be made in person or confidentially online through the LCU Title IX webpage and at the bottom of the LCU homepage.\n\nReporting Definitions\n\nActual knowledge: Notice of sexual harassment or allegations of sexual harassment to a recipient’s Title IX Coordinator or any official of the recipient who has authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the recipient. This standard is not met when the only official of the recipient with actual knowledge is the respondent.\n\nComplainant: An individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.\n\nRespondent: An individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.\n\nResponsible Employees: Refers to all employees unless otherwise designated by the university.\n\nResponsible Employees will receive the report and notify appropriate campus officials:\n\nAppropriate reporting campus officials\n\nTitle IX Coordinator\n\nDean of Students\n\nResidential Life Staff\n\nAthletic Senior Women Administrator\n\nWhen an individual tells a Responsible Employee about an incident of sexual misconduct, that individual has the right to expect the university to take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate what happened and to resolve the matter promptly and equitably, and assist in reporting to law enforcement if the complainant so chooses.\n\nEven if no action is requested by the complainant or they are unsure about what they want to do, such reporting to the Title IX Coordinator is necessary for various reasons, including to ensure that persons possibly subjected to such conduct receive appropriate services and information; that LCU can track incidents and identify patterns; and that, where appropriate, LCU can take steps to protect the university community. Reported allegations will be reviewed by the Title IX Coordinator, who will assess the report and consult with the complainant. Responsible employees who knew about but did not report allegations of sexual misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nConfidential Employee: In their professional capacity, LCU Counseling Center and the Student Health Office staff are considered confidential reporting resources and are not required to report according to university policy. Information disclosed in the clinical setting will be considered confidential.\n\nHowever, Confidential Employees may encourage clients to report to local and/or campus authorities. This policy does not infer Counseling and/or Medical Personnel are exempt from any mandatory reporting requirements placed on them by federal or state law.\n\nNote: Faculty, staff and other employees who are otherwise involved in pastoral or ministry work, are licensed mental health workers, or are licensed medical workers, but who are not working in that capacity for LCU, are not Confidential Employees.\n\nIf LCU officials determine that a serious incident may pose an on-going threat to members of the university community, a Timely Warning Notice will be issued to all students and employees. The intent of the Timely Warning is to prevent additional crimes and allow students and employees to take protective and precautionary measures.\n\nLCU faculty and staff members are able to help students report issues of harassment, violence or stalking, however students may report directly to any of the following areas for immediate access to resources:\n\nTitle IX Coordinator\n\nKaili Hutchinson\n\nStudent Life Building SUB 212 (C)\n\n806.720.7503\n\nStudent Life\n\nDean of Students\n\nStudent Life Building SUB 212 (B)\n\n806.720.7501\n\nResidential Life\n\nDirector of Residential Life\n\nStudent Life Building SUB 212 (A)\n\n806.720.7507\n\nJohnson Hall Residence Director\n\nJohnson Hall Office JH 108\n\n806.720.8695\n\nKatie Rogers/Courtyard Hall Residence Director\n\nKatie Rogers Office KR 151\n\n806.720.8879\n\nMabee Hall Residence Director\n\nMabee Hall Office MH 118\n\nPublic Safety\n\nPublic Safety Office\n\nStudent Life Building SUB 206\n\n806.796.8800\n\nPublic Safety Patrol\n\nStudent Life Building SUB 206\n\n806.928.6803\n\nAthletics\n\nSenior Woman Administrator\n\nRip Griffin Center RGC 108\n\n806.720.7279\n\nIV. Procedures\n\nA. Initial Response\n\nSafety: The first priority of a victim of sexual assault or domestic violence is to get to a place of safety.\n\nCall 911 for medical or safety emergency.\n\nMedical Assistance: Seeking medical attention is highly encouraged as soon as possible. Local emergency rooms have procedures to provide medical assistance, establish ongoing support, and preserve evidence.\n\nCovenant Medical Center\n\n3615 19th Street\n\n806.725.0000\n\nUniversity Medical Center\n\n602 Indiana Avenue\n\n806.775.8200\n\nReporting: Lubbock Christian University strongly advocates that a victim of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking report the incident to one of the following law enforcement agencies.\n\nLubbock Police Department\n\n806.775.2865\n\nLubbock County Sheriff's Department\n\n806.767.1441\n\nLubbock Christian University Public Safety\n\n806.928.6803\n\nAlthough Lubbock Christian University encourages timely law enforcement reporting, it is the victim's choice to make such a report or to decline involvement with law enforcement. LCU will assist Complainants in reporting to local law enforcement if desired.\n\nThe Complainant may choose for the investigation to be pursued through the criminal justice system and the LCU Title IX process or only the latter. The Title IX Coordinator will guide the Complainant through the reporting process.\n\nLCU encourages contact with the LCU Student Health Office or LCU Counseling Center for confidential resources and support. At the very minimum, reports may be made anonymously online through the LCU Title IX webpage or through the bottom of the LCU homepage.\n\nAs time passes, evidence may dissipate or become lost or unavailable, thereby making investigation, possible prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or obtaining orders of protection related to the incident more difficult. If a victim chooses not to make a complaint regarding an incident, he or she nevertheless should consider speaking with LPD or other law enforcement agency to preserve evidence in the event that the victim changes his or her mind at a later date.\n\nA Complainant may choose to report at any time, as long as the Complainant or the Respondent remain enrolled or employed by the university.\n\nCertain forms of sexual misconduct, domestic violence (family violence), dating violence, and stalking may be a violation of the statutes of the State of Texas. Complainants, therefore, may have certain legal rights with regard to criminal and civil action.\n\nB. Evidence Preservation\n\nEvidence of a sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking should be preserved as soon as possible, even if you are unsure about reporting to the University or filing criminal charges. Preservation of evidence is essential for both law enforcement and campus disciplinary investigations.\n\nWrite down, or have a friend write down everything you can remember about the incident, including a physical description of the assailant. You should attempt to do this even if you are unsure about reporting the incident in the future.\n\nForensic Evidence\n\nIf you choose to report the assault and pursue legal options, a prompt forensic examination can be crucial.\n\nSteps to preserve Forensic Evidence\n\nAvoid drinking, bathing, showering, brushing your teeth, using mouthwash, or combing your hair.\n\nDo not change clothes. If you have already changed your clothes, place your clothing and other items (sheets, blankets) in a brown paper bag (a plastic bag may destroy evidence)\n\nGo to a hospital emergency department listed above, which has the capability to provide a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE or \"rape kit\") and medical care for victims of sexual assault, dating violence, and family violence. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE), a healthcare provider trained to provide comprehensive care for a victim, can collect forensic evidence.\n\nA SAFE (rape kit) can only be completed within 5 days of the assault. You have the right to refuse the entire exam or any part of it at any time\n\nYou may also decide to complete a forensic exam anonymously.\n\nIf you suspect that you are the victim of a drug-facilitated sexual assault, ask the hospital or clinic where you receive medical care to take a urine sample. Drugs, such as Rohypnol and GHB, are more likely to be detected in urine than in blood. Rohypnol stays in the body for several hours and can be detected in the urine up to 72 hours after taking it. GHB leaves the body in 12 hours\n\nConsider bringing someone to the hospital with you for support.\n\nThe hospital automatically calls an advocate to be available any time someone comes in for a SAFE. You can decide whether or not you want to speak with the advocate. The advocate is a confidential resource who is not affiliated with LCU. They can provide you with confidential support and talk with you about your options.\n\nPhysical Evidence\n\nPhysical evidence should be preserved even if you choose not to go to the hospital for a forensic exam. Save all of the clothing you were wearing at the time of the assault. Put each item in a separate paper bag (do not use plastic bags). Save all bedding (blankets, sheets) and put each in a separate paper bag. Take photographs of any visible physical injuries (bruising, scratches) for use as evidence. If you report to law enforcement, they may want to take their own photos as evidence.\n\nElectronic Evidence\n\nEvidence such as texts, emails, social media posts, chats, pictures, videos or other forms of electronic communication can be helpful in a university or criminal investigation. Download, save to a .pdf, take screen shots, or use other methods to preserve electronic evidence.\n\nFollow-up Procedures\n\nMedical Assistance: It may be necessary for subsequent medical services through LCU Student Health Office, an emergency room, and/or private physician.\n\nCounseling Services: The LCU Counseling Center is equipped to assist with on-going counseling needs. Contact information for off-campus counseling resources will be provided.\n\nC. Supportive Measures\n\nSupportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, reasonably available, and without fee or charge to both parties before or after a formal complaint has been filed or where no formal complaint has been filed. Supportive measures are intended to preserve equal access, safety of the educational environment, and deter sexual harassment without burdening either party.\n\nThese supportive measures may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nCounseling\n\nExtensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments\n\nModifications of work or class schedules\n\nCampus escort services\n\nMutual restrictions on contact between parties\n\nChanges in work or housing locations\n\nLeaves of absence\n\nIncreased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus\n\nV. Grievance Process\n\nA. Formal Complaint\n\nA complainant may file a formal complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail or by electronic mail. The document must be signed by the complainant and serves as a request that the university investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. The Title IX Coordinator may sign the formal complaint if it is determined that failure to investigate the claim may be negligent or compromise community safety. The Title IX Coordinator may not serve as the complainant.\n\nA formal complaint may be dismissed if the alleged conduct would not constitute sexual harassment. per the 34 C.F.R.106.30, subd. (a). The complaint may be investigated under other policies of the code of conduct.\n\nB. Emergency Removal/Administrative Leave\n\nThe university reserves the right to remove a respondent from an educational program or activity after an individualized safety and risk assessment. The assessment must determine that an immediate threat exists to the physical health or safety of any student or individual. The respondent will be notified of the removal and given an opportunity to immediately challenge the removal.\n\nC. Notice of allegations\n\nA notice of allegation will be provided to all parties that are known once a formal complaint has been filed. The notice of allegations will include the following: the grievance process, details of the alleged sexual harassment, a statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination is made at the conclusion of the grievance process, the ability to use an advisor of their choice, and prohibits knowingly making false claims or submitting false information during the grievance process.\n\nD. Advisors\n\nThe complainant and respondent are permitted to select an advisor to be present during intake, interviews, meetings, and/or proceedings. An advisor can be any person that agrees to serve in that role other than Title IX staff members. If one party selects an attorney as an advisor, the party must notify the Title IX Coordinator three business days prior to any meeting or interview they will attend. The advisor’s role is to provide support and advice. They are not permitted to speak on behalf of the parties or disrupt, delay or interfere with any meeting. Advisors may be asked to meet with the Title IX Coordinator or administrator to discuss the role and responsibilities prior to their participation.\n\nE. Formal Resolution\n\nA formal resolution includes an investigation, report review, live hearing, and outcome.\n\n*The live hearing component applies exclusively to complaints that fall under Title IX.\n\nInvestigation Process\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator will designate a trained and objective investigator, decision maker, and appeals officer. If either the complainant or respondent believes a conflict of interest exists, they are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator, in writing, within three (3) business days. The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence to reach a determination regarding responsibility falls on the university. Therefore, the investigator will conduct a prompt, reliable, and impartial investigation that may include interviews and collection of relevant evidence. During the investigation, both parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses and other relevant evidence. The investigator will notify any party of the date, time, location, and purpose of the interview with sufficient time for the party to prepare. Note: The formal resolution process will proceed in the event the responding party withdraws from the university.\n\nPreliminary Report: Upon the completion of the investigation, the investigator will write a preliminary report of all the facts for the Title IX Coordinator to review. If any additional information needs to be obtained, the investigator may conduct additional interviews.\n\nResponse: The preliminary report and any evidence will then be accessible to both the complainant and respondent and their advisors. Each party will have ten (10) business days to provide a written response. If additional information is given by either party, the other party will receive the new information and have an opportunity to respond. The investigator will provide an adequate and reasonable time frame in order for all information to be collected while maintaining a prompt and equitable process.\n\nInvestigative report: At the conclusion of the response period, the investigator will add any relevant information to the final investigative report that will be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator. The report will fairly summarize all relevant evidence and will sent to each party and the party’s advisor ten (10) days prior to the live hearing. Both parties are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement upon the receipt of the investigative report.\n\nLive hearing\n\nDecision Maker- The decision maker will oversee the live hearing and allow each party’s advisor to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. The decision maker will determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant.\n\nQuestions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent.\n\nParties are required to attend the live hearing in person or by utilizing approved technology platforms. If parties do not have an advisor, the university will provide one.\n\nAll live hearings will be recorded and made available to the parties for inspection and review.\n\nOutcome\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the decision maker will determine whether the reported violation is more likely than not to have occurred. This standard of evidence may also be referred to as preponderance of the evidence.\n\nIf the complaint does not fall under Title IX, The Title IX Coordinator will designate a trained decision maker who will receive the final investigative report. After reviewing the report, a determination will be made as to whether the reported violation is more likely than not to have occurred.\n\nAn outcome letter will be provided to both the respondent and complainant at the same time which outlines the investigation findings and appeal process. The determination regarding responsibility becomes final on the date the outcome letter is sent to both parties if an appeal is filed. If an appeal is not filed, the determination is final three business days after the written determination has been sent to both parties.\n\nAppeal\n\nEither the Complainant or the Respondent may appeal the decision made by the decision maker by notifying the Title IX Coordinator in writing within three (3) business days of the date of the decision. The other party will be notified if an appeal is filed. The only grounds for appeal are as follows:\n\nAll appeals will be reviewed by a trained appeals officer and shall be based solely on the records provided from the investigation and live hearing unless new evidence is grounds for the appeal. Both parties will receive a written decision, simultaneously, describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result. The decision of the appeals officer is final.\n\nSignificant procedural irregularity that adversely impacted the outcome of the investigation\n\nThe consideration of significant new evidence that was not available during the investigation. A summary of the new evidence must be included in the appeal.\n\nSanctions\n\nIf it is determined that the reported violation occurred, and the appeals process has been exhausted, appropriate sanction(s) will be issued in accordance with the LCU Student Handbook. Sanction(s) may include the entire range available under LCU policy. Sanction appeals will be heard by the Conduct Review Board as outlined in the Student Conduct Appeal Process. Sanctions that result in ineligibility to re-enroll will result in a transcript notation. Transcript notations may be removed based on request, timing, and good cause.\n\nRetaliation\n\nNo person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Such conduct will be addresses under the student code of conduct.\n\nF. Voluntary Informal Resolution\n\nVoluntary Informal Resolution is an internal grievance process that may be available to resolve a report after a formal complaint has been filed/received. Voluntary Informal Resolution is available to both students and employees. However, it is not appropriate in all cases. Voluntary Informal Resolution is a voluntary, remedies-based resolution process that requires participation by both parties. It does not involve an investigation and may not involve taking disciplinary action against a respondent. Voluntary Informal Resolution is intended to eliminate the conduct at issue, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. It is not necessary to pursue Voluntary Informal Resolution before pursuing an investigation and formal resolution. Request to use Voluntary Informal Resolution following receipt of a report and as part of or following the initial inquiry, the Title IX Coordinator will determine how to proceed. The decision of how to proceed will be made as part of or following the initial inquiry when LCU has sufficient information about the nature and scope of the reported misconduct. If the Title IX Coordinator determines Voluntary Informal Resolution is appropriate, the parties will be notified of the nature of the complaint, reminded that retaliatory behavior will not be tolerated, and advised of any confidentiality issues. Both the complainant and respondent will be given a copy of the policy, the applicable procedures, an explanation of the Voluntary Informal Resolution process, and asked about their preferred process for resolution. If either a complainant or respondent indicates a preference for Voluntary Informal Resolution to resolve a report, the Title IX Coordinator will determine if both parties voluntarily agree to participate to resolve the report using this internal grievance process.\n\nA complainant or respondent may request that the Voluntary Informal Resolution process be attempted to resolve a report at any time. For example, a complainant who previously requested to go through the internal grievance process of investigation and formal resolution can request to end that process and attempt Voluntary Informal Resolution. The Title IX Coordinator will consider the request if the other party is in agreement. Either party participating in Voluntary Informal Resolution can end the process at any time and request a shift to the investigation and formal resolution process. If the Voluntary Informal Resolution process is unsuccessful or fails to address the reported conduct, at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, a complainant may be able to subsequently pursue a resolution through investigation and formal resolution.\n\nVI. Prevention and Awareness Programs\n\nAs a community, we share the responsibility to prevent sexual misconduct through education, bystander intervention, and mutual respect for one another. As part of our commitment to the prevention of sexual misconduct, Lubbock Christian University offers education and awareness programs. Incoming students and employees will have access to prevention and awareness education, including training on recognizing and reporting sexual misconduct. All students, faculty, and staff have access to ongoing training and related programs.\n\nStudents will be provided with information regarding sexual misconduct prevention and reporting during new student orientation, the university's \"UNI 1170\" class, and other LCU Student Life programming through the Student Life Office, Residential Life, the LCU Counseling Center, and LCU Public Safety.\n\nThe Title IX Council exists to serve the campus with a diverse group of faculty and staff that receive additional Title IX training. The council provides an opportunity for various departments on campus to communicate and be proactive in educating faculty, staff, and students in how to provide and maintain a safe campus.\n\nNote: Title IX reports will be reviewed by the President and Board of Trustees in an effort to maintain a safe campus free from discrimination, violence, harassment, and stalking."
