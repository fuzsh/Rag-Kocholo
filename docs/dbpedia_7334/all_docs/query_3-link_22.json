        "text": "IN PLAIN ENGLISH\n\nThis analysis is based on projections of college savings and college costs. It demonstrates the impact of savings on debt after graduation. The more you save, the less you'll have to borrow. This tool can help you determine how much you need to save to ensure that your child graduates with an affordable amount of debt at each college or university.\n\nThis tool assumes that a college's net price will continue to increase at the same rate as recent increases. It also assumes that the earnings in a college savings plan will reflect historical averages. Since past performance is not necessarily predictive of future performance, actual cost and return figures may vary. This tool is intended to educate consumers about the relationship between college savings and student loan debt."
