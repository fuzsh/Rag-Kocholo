We believe that the home, the church, and the school should all be aligned in their teachings. That’s why everything from the classroom to co-curriculars is based on biblical integration. We hire qualified teachers, administrators, and coaches with strong personal testimonies of faith.\n\nStop worrying about the negative influence of a school community that doesn’t align with your beliefs and values. Enroll your child at Gilbert Christian Schools where they will be encouraged both academically and spiritually."
