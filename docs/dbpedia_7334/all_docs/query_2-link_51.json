Using cost information from College Navigator and data regarding the 20-year ROI from PayScale.com, we awarded points to each school for its affordability and return on investment. We also consulted US News and World Report's ranking of best HCBUs and awarded points to schools who made the cut. What resulted is this ranking of best value historically black colleges and universities.\n\nJump to Program Rankings\n\nWhy Attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities?\n\nThere are many reasons to consider attending one of the more than 100 historically black colleges and universities in the United States, and for many prospective students, it is a very personal decision. Many African American students enjoy the comradery of living and studying among fellow black students while others attend HCBUs to honor their culture and ancestry. Many prestigious African Americans have attended historically black colleges, including celebrities, famous athletes, and of course, civil rights leaders. Many students who choose to attend HBCUs enjoy knowing that they are studying on the same campus as these leaders and role models did in days long gone.\n\nAll students can benefit from the exceptional sense of community perpetuated by many HCBUs, though. Moreover, some historically black colleges and universities tend to promote more activism than traditionally white institutions of higher education. Students are often passionate and enthusiastic about a wide range of social issues, not only those that specifically affect African Americans.\n\nFeatured Online Programs\n\nFiguring out where to apply?

Even so, these institutions have always been open to the enrollment of students of all races and ethnicities, and many have become increasingly diverse in recent years. Still, the primary mission of these schools is to provide for the education and enrichment of African Americans.\n\nThere are 107 historically black colleges and universities in the United States located in 19 different states across the country as well as in the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands. As one might expect, the vast majority of these schools are located in former slave states, but there are a few exceptions. There are different types of HBCUs, including community colleges, four-year schools, public institutions, private universities, and specialty institutions like medical and law schools.\n\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities: Background\n\nPrior to the Civil War, there were no institutes of higher education for African Americans. To make matters worse, some parts of the country prohibited the education of black students. In 1837, Richard Humphreys founded the Institute for Colored Youth in Pennsylvania in order to provide education to students of color. The institute began as an agricultural and mechanical school and did not offer formal degrees until 1913 when it began training teachers. By then, it had changed its name to Cheyney University. It remains the oldest institute of postsecondary education for African Americans today. In 1854, Lincoln University was founded as the first degree-granting institute of higher education for African Americans. Today, it remains a vibrant historically black university and is ranked #20 among all HCBUs by US News & World Report. Two years later in 1856, Wilberforce University was founded as the first institute of higher education owned and operated by African Americans. The university continues to provide undergraduate and graduate degrees today.\n\nWith the few exceptions above, many African Americans (especially those located in the Southern states) were still hard-pressed to find institutions willing to provide them with any kind of postsecondary education until the year 1890 when the second Morrill Act was passed. The act mandated former Confederate states to open colleges for African American students that paralleled the traditionally white universities established by the first Morrill Act. This act allowed states to fund institutes of higher education through proceeds from the sale of federal land. The resulting schools became known as land grant colleges, and they were established in 17 states.\n\nIn 1896, the Supreme Court ruled that African Americans must be granted \"separate but equal\" facilities, including those that provided educational services, in the landmark case of Plessy v. Ferguson. In reality, though, institutes of higher education for black students often received less public funding, and therefore, were almost always of lower quality than traditionally white schools. In many cases, the teachers were poorly prepared, and important equipment and resources such as textbooks, for instance, were often inferior. In 1954, Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned by another landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education when the Supreme Court called for the desegregation of all schools in the United States. Though segregation is no longer an issue in the US, HCBUs still honor their origins and continue their plight for excellence in education for African Americans.\n\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities Today\n\nAt the time of their establishment, historically black colleges and universities were the only option for African Americans who desired to pursue higher education. Thus, their principle purpose was to educate black students. Today, students from every race and background have equal access to higher education, so the mission of HBCUs has evolved. Today, HBCUS have the unique challenge of honoring their past and traditions while simultaneously encouraging and embracing diversity. Historically black colleges and universities have become increasingly diverse over the years. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that 21% of students attending HCBUs were non-Black students. This is up from 15% in 1976.\n\nHistorically Black Student Clubs and Organizations\n\nGenerally speaking, historically black colleges and universities have exceptionally close-knit and active student organizations. Many of the students in this ranking, for instance, have more than 100 student clubs and organizations on campus for students to choose from. Some of these organizations seek to honor African American culture. Some examples of such clubs and organizations are listed below.\n\nThe Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA)\n\nBlack Men Making a Difference (BMMAD)\n\nBlack Student Union (BSU)\n\nBlack Women's Caucus (BWC)\n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council\n\nNational Society of Black Engineers\n\nOf course, students enrolled at historically black colleges and universities are encouraged to join other types of student associations as well, including those focused on a particular academic area of study as well as clubs and organizations centered around extracurricular interests such as sports, music, politics, community service, social activism, hobbies, and more.\n\nHistorically Black College and University Classes\n\nWhat are classes like at historically black colleges and universities? Unlike many traditionally white schools, historically black schools tend to have smaller class sizes and strive for low student to faculty ratios. For instance, none of the schools listed in this ranking have a student to faculty ratio of over 20:1. These smaller, more intimate settings foster a learning environment that is much more effective for some students, one in which answers to questions can be quickly and directly addressed, and students can form meaningful and collaborative relationships with their professors and classmates. Such classrooms also facilitate mentorships that can make the difference between success and failure for many students.\n\nWhen you attend a historically black college or university, the size of the school will typically be small as well. The largest school in this ranking, for example, enrolls just over 10,000 students. Smaller enrollment numbers usually translate to a more familial, community-like environment many students will find uplifting. Leaving home for the first time can be intimidating for any student, especially first-generation college students, and being in an environment where someone remembers your name can make all the difference.\n\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities: Academics\n\nAcademics should always be at the top of the list when choosing an institute of higher education. Historically black colleges and universities offer academic programs that parallel or, in some cases, supersede traditionally white schools in terms of rigor and breadth. Desegregation plans enacted by the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has enabled these schools to establish special academic programs, including in-demand offerings in engineering, pharmacy, and computer science, for example. HCBUS offer degree programs on every postsecondary level, including associate's degrees, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and PhDs. However, the vast majority of degrees conferred at historically black colleges are baccalaureate degrees, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nCollege courses are known for being rigorous, and this can be a transition for many students who are accustomed to the ease of high school classes. There's good news for those considering historically black colleges and universities, though. Those students who may struggle academically will find plenty of support at these schools. Because they were initially established to provide assistance to educationally disadvantaged populations, they are devoted to providing adequate remediation and assistance to struggling students. This may come in the form of additional academic labs, tutoring programs, remedial courses, and other forms of educational support. As a result of all of this extra support, historically black colleges and universities typically have higher than average graduation rates.\n\nFinancial Aid for Students Attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities\n\nCost is almost always a factor for students when choosing a postsecondary school. Although grants and loans are possibilities for students, despite what type of college or university they choose to attend, scholarships are among the most coveted forms of financial assistance. Some organizations offer specific scholarships for students planning to attend a historically black college or university. These scholarships can cover all or part of the costs of attending college, including tuition, books, housing, and other expenses. Depending on the amount of the scholarship being offered, this could be the deciding factor for students considering enrollment at a HCBU. Some examples can be found below:\n\nDiversity Advancement Program Scholarship\n\nBuick Achievers Scholarship\n\nJackie Robinson Foundation Scholarship\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities/African-American Future Achievers Scholarship\n\nXerox Minority Scholarship\n\nIt is important to note that these scholarships can be extremely competitive. Students must make excellent grades in high school and score high on college admissions exams such as the SAT and ACT in order to qualify."
