        "text": "How many K-12 public schools, districts, and students are there? What does the American student population look like? And how much are we, as a nation, spending on the education of these youth?\n\nThese data points bring perspective to the implications and potential impacts of education policies. The Education Week library provides answers to these questions, and some other enlightening facts, below.\n\nThis page will be updated when new federal data becomes available. Federal data is typically released several years after it is collected.\n\nSCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS\n\nHow many schools are there in the U.S.?\n\nThere are 128,961 public and private K-12 schools in the U.S., according to 2019-20 data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Here’s how they break down:\n\nAll: 128,961\n\nPrekindergarten, elementary, and middle schools: 88,909\n\nSecondary and high schools: 27,155\n\nOther, ungraded, and not applicable/not reported: 12,897\n\nHere’s what this looks like in chart form:\n\nHow many are traditional public schools, public charter schools, or private schools?\n\nWhile charter schools are often the topic of debate, they make up only a small portion of all schools.\n\nTraditional public schools: 91,390 (2022-23, Source)\n\nPublic charter schools: 7,998 (2022-23, Source)\n\nPrivate schools: 30,492 (2019-20, Source * 2022-23 figures are not available yet)\n\nFor more on charters, including how they work and who oversees them, read this explainer.\n\nAmong public schools, how many high schools are there in the U.S.?\n\nTotal public schools: 99,388\n\nSecondary and high schools: 23,810\n\nMiddle schools: 16,298\n\nElementary schools: 52,474\n\nPrekindergarten: 1,570\n\nOther, ungraded, and not applicable/not reported: 5,236\n\n(2022-23, Source)\n\nWhat is the average public school size?\n\nThe average public school enrollment is 514 students, according to data from 2022. That’s down 8 students from the average school size in 2012, according to NCES.\n\nWhat is the average public school size by type of location?\n\nCity: 560 students\n\nSuburban: 638 students\n\nTown: 436 students\n\nRural: 372 students\n\n(2022, Source)\n\nHow many schools offer online courses?\n\nAccording to 2020-21 NCES data, 28.7 percent of public schools, including charters, offered at least one course entirely online before the pandemic. Almost a third (30.6 percent) of charter schools offered an entire course online, versus 28.5 percent of traditional public schools. Only 17.3 percent of private schools offered at least one course entirely online before the pandemic.\n\nHow many virtual schools are there?\n\nAccording to 2019-20 NCES data, there are 691 virtual schools in the U.S. The NCES defines virtual schools as “having instruction during which students and teachers are separated by time and/or location and interact via internet-connected computers or other electronic devices.”\n\nHow many school districts are there?\n\nThere are 13,318 regular school districts in the U.S. (2022-23, Source)\n\nNote: Regular districts exclude regional education service agencies and supervisory union administrative centers, state-operated agencies, federally operated agencies, and other types of local education agencies, such as independent charter schools.\n\nWhat is the most common size for a school district?\n\nIn 2021-22, the plurality of regular school districts (23.9 percent) had 1,000 to 2,499 students enrolled. In the 1979-80 school year, in contrast, small school districts were the largest category, making up 26.5 percent of all districts.\n\nHow has the size of school districts changed over time?\n\nThe number of regular school districts in the U.S. decreased from 15,944 in 1979-80 to 13,318 in 2021-22. In that time, the percent of districts that were large (over 25,000 students) grew from 1.1 percent of districts to 2 percent. The percent of very small districts (with enrollment under 300 students), decreased from 26.5 percent to 19.2 percent in that same period.\n\nWhere are the largest school districts in the U.S.?\n\nBig cities like New York and Los Angeles lead the list of the largest school districts, as identified by NCES in 2021. But the rest of the top 10 may surprise you:\n\nRankDistrict nameState Enrollment1New York CityNY859,514\n\n2Los Angeles UnifiedCA435,958\n\n3ChicagoIL329,836\n\n4Miami-Dade CountyFL328,589\n\n5Clark CountyNV315,787\n\n6Broward CountyFL256,037\n\n7Hillsborough CountyFL224,149\n\n8Orange CountyFL203,224\n\n9HoustonTX194,607\n\n10Palm Beach CountyFL187,943\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nHow many students attend public schools?\n\nIn America’s public schools, there are 48.7 million students, based on federal projections for the fall of 2024.\n\nHow many students attend charter schools?\n\nAccording to data from two years earlier, over 3.71 million students, or 7.6 percent of all public school students, attend charter schools.\n\nHow many students attend private schools? What are the religious affiliations of those schools?\n\nIn total, almost 5.5 million students attend private schools, according to 2021 NCES data.\n\n33.4% of those in Catholic schools\n\n25.5% in nonsectarian (non-religious) schools\n\n13.4% in un-affiliated religious schools\n\n14.3% in conservative Christian schools\n\n13.6% in other religiously affiliated schools\n\nHow many students are homeschooled?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a huge increase in the rates of home schooling in the U.S. Even after the first year of the pandemic, in the 2020-21 school year, 5.4 percent of all students were home-schooled, according to the August 2021 Household Pulse Survey.\n\nIn 2019, only 3.23 percent of all students were home-schooled, according to NCES 2019 data.\n\nSo who are the nation’s home schoolers? This overview of homeschooling includes more information on the topic.\n\nWhere do most students attend school—the city, the suburbs or rural areas?\n\nAccording to 2022 data, a plurality of public school students attend suburban schools, but enrollment in urban schools is not far behind.\n\nSuburban: 38.9% of public school students\n\nCity: 29.7% of public school students\n\nRural: 20.3% of public school students\n\nTown: 10.8% of public school students\n\nMeanwhile, as of 2019-20, most private school students attend schools in the city.\n\nCity: 42.7% of private school students\n\nSuburban: 40.4% of private school students\n\nRural: 10.8% of private school students\n\nTown: 6.1% of private school students\n\nWhat are the demographics of public school students?\n\nHere’s a racial breakdown of the student population in American public schools, as of 2022:\n\nWhite students: 44.7%\n\nHispanic students: 28.7%\n\nBlack students: 14.9%\n\nAsian students: 5.5%\n\nTwo or more race students: 4.9%\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native students: 0.9%\n\nPacific Islander students: 0.4%\n\nNote: Percentages do not total 100 because of rounding.\n\nThe 2015-16 school year was the first in which the majority of public schoolchildren were minorities. For a look back at what that milestone meant for schools, revisit this story from 2014.\n\nHow many students have internet access at home?\n\nAs of 2021, 97.1 percent of children ages 3-18 lived in a household with internet access. However, of the 97.1 percent, 4.5 percent only had internet through a smartphone. In 2021, 2.9 percent of children ages 3-18 lived in a household with no internet at all, down significantly from 5.4 percent in 2019.\n\nHow many students graduate high school?\n\nThe national graduation rate is 87 percent, according to 2021-22 NCES data.\n\nHow has that changed over time?\n\nThe graduation rate has increased by 8 percentage points from 2010-2011 to 2019-20.\n\nHow many students graduate in my state?\n\nHover over a state in this interactive map to see its graduation rate in 2019-20, broken down by demographic groups:\n\nTEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS\n\nHow many teachers are there in the U.S.?\n\nIn America’s public schools there will be 3.2 million full-time-equivalent teachers in the fall of 2024, according to federal projections.\n\nHow many principals are there?\n\nThere are 91,900 public school principals in the U.S., according to 2020-21 numbers from NCES.\n\nWhat percent of teachers are women?\n\nTeaching continues to be a profession dominated by women. According to 2020-21 numbers from NCES, 76.8 percent of teachers are female, while 23.2 percent are male.\n\nWhat are the racial demographics of teachers?\n\nWhen it comes to race, America’s public school teachers look very different from its student population.\n\n79.9% White\n\n9.4% Hispanic\n\n6.1% Black\n\n2.4% Asian\n\n1.6% Two or more races\n\n0.4% American Indian/Alaska Native\n\n0.2% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\n\n(2020-21, Source)\n\nFor a more detailed look at the profile of America’s teaching force, including how many say they’re likely to leave the profession, see the results of the most recent Merrimack College Teacher Survey.\n\nRead more about the teaching profession in the State of Teaching project with exclusive, nationally representative data from the EdWeek Research Center and on-the-ground reporting from EdWeek journalists.\n\nWho are U.S. public school principals?\n\nLike teachers, most American principals are white and female.\n\n56% Female\n\n44% Male\n\n77.1% White\n\n10.4% Black\n\n9.3% Hispanic\n\n1.3% Two or more races\n\n1.0% Asian\n\n0.6% American Indian/Alaska Native\n\n0.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\n\n(2020-21, Source)\n\nAnother finding from recent federal data: Charter school principals are more diverse. Only 66.6 percent of charter school principals are white, compared with 78.2 percent of traditional school principals. 16.1 percent of charter principals are Black and 13.2 percent are Hispanic, while only 9.8 percent of traditional school principals are Black and 8.9 percent are Hispanic.\n\nWhat’s the average U.S. teacher salary?\n\nThe estimated average annual salary for teachers is $66,397, according to 2021-22 data from NCES.\n\nOf course, teacher salaries vary widely from state to state. Although its findings differ from the federal data, the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, releases an annual ranking of state salaries. Here are 2023-24 numbers.\n\nHow does that compare with principals’ salaries?\n\nThe average public school principal salary in 2020-21 was $113,470 in 2021-22 dollars.\n\nHow big are the teachers’ unions?\n\nAccording to NCES data from 2017-18, 69.4 percent of teachers are members of a union.\n\nIn July 2023, the National Education Association had about 2.3 million full-time-equivalent members who are active educators or, retirees, or community allies.\n\nAs of June 2023, the American Federation of Teachers had about 1.7 million members.\n\nWhat is the average student to teacher ratio in schools?\n\nOn average, in the fall of 2024, there will be 15.2 students assigned to a single teacher in public schools, NCES projections show.\n\nThe state with highest student to teacher ratio is, as of 2022, Arizona, with 22.8 students for each teacher. The state with lowest student to teacher ratio? Vermont, with 10.5 students for each teacher.\n\nNote: The pupil/teacher ratio includes teachers for students with disabilities and other special teachers, while these teachers are generally excluded from class size calculations.\n\nSUPERINTENDENTS\n\nWhat are the demographics of school superintendents?\n\nA 2024 survey conducted by AASA, The School Superintendents Association, found that 87 percent of superintendents identify as white, and 73 percent identify as men. The median age of superintendents is 50 years old.\n\nWhat’s the average tenure of a big-city superintendent?\n\n48 percent of all superintendent have 5 or fewer years of experience in the position, according to a 2024 survey conducted by AASA.\n\nWhat’s the average superintendent salary?\n\nThe average superintendent salary was $156,000 in 2024, according to a 2024 survey conducted by AASA. Superintendent salaries haven’t kept up with inflation—the median superintendent salary in 2013 was $123,775, which is $162,916 adjusted for inflation.\n\nFor more facts about superintendents, read more about the survey.\n\nSCHOOL SPENDING\n\nHow much does the U.S. spend on K-12 education?\n\nIn 2020-21, $809 billion was spent on public elementary and secondary education by local, state, and federal agencies. State and local governments provided about 89 percent of the funding, while the federal government chipped in around 10.5 percent. The federal government’s share of education funding was higher than normal due to pandemic relief aid. In 2019-20, only 7.5 percent of total school funding came from the federal government.\n\nFor more on where money for education comes from and how it’s spent, see this article.\n\nHow much is spent per pupil?\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, on average the nation spent $14,347 to educate each student. Adjusted for inflation, education funding per pupil nationwide has risen by about $1,800 in the last decade.\n\nThese expenditures varied state to state. New York has the highest per-pupil expenditures in the nation at $26,571. At the other end of the scale, Idaho spent the least at $9,053 per student.\n\nHover over a state to see its per-pupil spending:\n\nWant to see more education statistics?\n\nTake a look at our special education statistics page."
