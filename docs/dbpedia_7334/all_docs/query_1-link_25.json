        "text": "The Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine (AZCOM) integrates the art and science of medicine through patient-centered education under expert guidance.\n\nLearn More\n\nLearn more about the requirements and find quick links to relevant catalog content to guide you in your application process.\n\nBachelor's degree\n\nMinimum total and science GPA of 2.75\n\nMCAT scores\n\nTwo professional letters of recommendation\n\nView full list of requirements in the catalog\n\nAZCOM maintains matriculation agreements with the following programs:\n\nMidwestern University College of Graduate Studies\n\nBiomedical Sciences Program\n\nArizona Christian University\n\nArizona State University\n\nApplicants who believe they may meet matriculation agreement eligibility requirements should contact the Midwestern University Admissions Department at 623-572-3275.\n\nThe AZCOM curriculum incorporates its mission objectives into its programmatic level educational objectives. Midwestern University Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine educates students to become qualified osteopathic physicians who provide quality patient care, exhibit professionalism, and serve their communities.\n\nThe Mission will be achieved by meeting the following objectives:\n\n1. Incorporate clinical teaching into the curriculum.\n\nAZCOM graduates must be able to utilize the preclinical foundational knowledge to develop critical medical thinking in the last two clinical years of training and beyond. To assist in the development of critical thinking skills, clinical teaching begins in year 1 and continues throughout the curriculum. Upon entering year 3, students will be able to:\n\nApply basic science knowledge to the assessment and treatment plan development for a patient.\n\nDemonstrate medical knowledge and evidence-based understanding on clinical rotations.\n\nDemonstrate osteopathic evaluation and treatment skills in the supervised care of patients.\n\n2. Incorporate osteopathic principles and practice, including osteopathic manipulative treatment into the curriculum.\n\nGraduates of AZCOM receive instruction in osteopathic principles and practice and osteopathic manipulative treatment in all four years of the curriculum to provide holistic osteopathic medical care, mindful of the ability of the body to be self-healing and the interaction of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit). AZCOM students will be able to:\n\nDemonstrate osteopathic manipulative evaluation and treatment skills appropriately applied to patient care.\n\nPerform complete histories and physical examinations of patients, including osteopathic musculoskeletal examinations.\n\nDefine biopsychosocial indicators of health for patients.\n\nRecognize and utilize indications and contraindications for osteopathic manipulative treatment.\n\n3. Incorporate basic scientific principles.\n\nUnderstanding basic scientific principles and how research is conducted will contribute to the assessment of the literature for osteopathic physicians to determine whether, when and how to apply the information in the scientific literature to the care of their patients. AZCOM students, by graduation, will be able to:\n\nRecall scientific principles and their application in medical and scientific literature.\n\nApply the scientific basis of structure and function to the concepts of health and disease.\n\nAccurately interpret laboratory values as evaluated for patients.\n\n4. Provide opportunities for research and scholarly activity for students, residents, and faculty.\n\nContributions to the body of scientific information are important to AZCOM in respect to its faculty, students, and residents. Providing opportunities for scholarly activity contributes to lifelong independent learning. AZCOM students are provided opportunities to voluntarily participate in research in all four years of the curriculum. Upon graduation from AZCOM, students will be able to:\n\nDefine the need for Institutional Review Board evaluation of human clinical research to protect human subjects.\n\nUtilize research derived evidence-based information to improve clinical decision making through review of the medical literature.\n\n5. Prepare students for COMLEX-USA Level 1, Level 2 CE, and clinical skills assessment to support completion of the program and graduation.\n\nSuccessful completion of COMLEX-USA Levels 1, and 2 CE are a requirement to graduate from AZCOM and to be licensed to practice in each of the fifty states. Additionally, the demonstration of clinical skills acquisition is a requirement for attestation that they may proceed to graduate and to be eligible for COMLEX-USA Level 3. All graduates will:\n\nDemonstrate passage of COMLEX-USA Level 1.\n\nDemonstrate passage of COMLEX-USA Level 2 CE.\n\nDemonstrate at least minimum competency of clinical skills using a national standard.\n\n6. Demonstrate student acquisition of the osteopathic core competencies.\n\nAZCOM reviews its curriculum to assure that it provides education to allow all graduates to achieve the osteopathic core competencies to be able to provide quality patient care. AZCOM graduates will:\n\nApply knowledge of osteopathic principles and philosophy to the evaluation of patients and skills in the application of osteopathic manipulative treatment when appropriate.\n\nApply medical knowledge and accepted practices to the care of patients.\n\nShow evidence of safe and effective patient care.\n\nDemonstrate their ability to effectively communicate with patients, their families, and the interprofessional health care team.\n\nConduct themselves in a professional manner, with concern for their patients and respect for themselves, their colleagues, and the community.\n\nUtilize current scientific evidence in the care of patients and the recognition of research methods and the need for continuous improvement in one’s medical knowledge.\n\nDiscuss health care delivery systems and how they can be used to improve individual patient care.\n\n7. Assess the performance of AZCOM graduates.\n\nWhile it is important to assure that students are achieving the mission objectives while at AZCOM, it is of comparable or greater importance to apply the learning and skills during residency. Graduates will be assessed for:\n\nApplication of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies in patient care.\n\nDemonstration of the ability to provide timely and appropriate care for patients in a hospital setting.\n\nDemonstration of passage of COMLEX-USA Level 3 in their postgraduate training years.\n\n8. Encourage participation in community service by students, residents, and faculty.\n\nService to the community assists students in developing and encouraging an understanding of cultural, environmental, and social aspects of health. Encouraging students to work under supervision in varied community settings assists in professional, culturally sensitive development. Students will:\n\nDemonstrate culturally sensitive care of at-risk unhoused populations.\n\nEngage in educational programs for underserved populations.\n\n9. Support postgraduate training programs associated with Midwestern University, including osteopathic recognition program development.\n\nThe Midwestern University Graduate Medical Education Consortium programs and other affiliated postgraduate medical education programs serve to educate students along with residents in those programs. Hospitals receive support for their residency programs, in the form of simulation training, anatomical dissection experiences, library services, faculty development, among other services. These programs provide core and elective residency-based rotations for AZCOM students who will:\n\nDemonstrate the ability to work within a graduate medical education hierarchy.\n\nDevelop skills identifying appropriate supervision of clinical performance.\n\nMatch to residencies in their chosen fields of medicine.\n\n10. Equip students to be successful in residency placement.\n\nTo practice osteopathic medicine, students must match to residency programs that they will complete after graduation from AZCOM. Students will:\n\nDemonstrate capability in the core clinical competencies on audition and elective rotations.\n\nExamine and assess their affinities and skills for specialty residencies.\n\nDevelop the skills necessary to prepare for residency interviews.\n\nComplete their applications for residency, demonstrating their understanding of the complexities of the application and match processes.\n\n11. Provide faculty and staff development opportunities.\n\nFaculty and staff must be prepared to support students throughout the four-year program. To achieve this, the faculty and staff must develop those skills necessary to support students, including education skills, understanding of the osteopathic profession, and knowledge of the clinical practice environment. Regular evaluations and surveys of faculty and students will help guide the needs, as will environmental and cultural factors that affect student learning. Faculty and staff will:\n\nDemonstrate student competence in their areas of content through internally written and nationally standardized examination outcomes.\n\nDemonstrate student competence in their areas of content through nationally standardized clinical examination outcomes.\n\nMaintain up-to-date content of information provided to students.\n\n12. Provide financial literacy programs and events.\n\nStudents incur debt both in undergraduate and osteopathic medical school. It is important for their futures to manage the debt appropriately. MWU AZCOM provides its students with a rigorous program of financial awareness during their program. Students will:\n\nEvaluate their own debt and its repayment.\n\nReview information regarding means to limit debt load.\n\n13. Support mental health and wellness for students, residents, and faculty.\n\nWellness requires a comprehensive approach, including access to care when wellness is not present and recognition of signs of mental stress (e.g., burnout, anxiety) and situations that may indicate lack of wellness. Students, residents, and faculty will:\n\nConvey information about behavioral health in a nonjudgmental way.\n\nUse a wellness focus in the care of their own health and in discussions with patients about their health.\n\nSafeguard patient and peer privacy and confidentiality.\n\nStrive to recognize the signs of burnout and the steps to alleviate burnout.\n\nIn 1995, Midwestern University acknowledged the growing need for physicians in the United States and established AZCOM in Glendale, Arizona. The inaugural class of osteopathic medical students began classes on September 30, 1996, and graduated on June 4, 2000. AZCOM achieved full accreditation status following the graduation of this first class. In 2008, AZCOM increased its class size to 250 to help address the need for more physicians in the state of Arizona.\n\nMission\n\nMidwestern University Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine educates students to become qualified osteopathic physicians who provide quality patient care, exhibit professionalism, and serve their communities.\n\nThe mission will be achieved by meeting the following objectives:\n\nIncorporate clinical teaching into the curriculum.\n\nIncorporate osteopathic principles and practice, including osteopathic manipulative treatment, into the curriculum.\n\nIncorporate basic scientific principles.\n\nProvide opportunities for research and scholarly activity for students, residents, and faculty.\n\nPrepare students for COMLEX-USA Level 1, Level 2 CE, and Level 2 PE to support completion of the program and graduation.\n\nDemonstrate student acquisition of the osteopathic core competencies.\n\nAssess the performance of AZCOM graduates.\n\nEncourage participation in community service by students, residents, and faculty.\n\nSupport postgraduate training programs associated with Midwestern University, including osteopathic recognition program development.\n\nEquip students to be successful in residency placement.\n\nProvide faculty and staff development opportunities.\n\nProvide financial literacy programs and events.\n\nSupport mental health and wellness for students, residents and faculty.\n\nAZCOM Statement of Values\n\nAZCOM embodies osteopathic academic excellence and scholarship through professionalism, compassion, leadership, and community service.\n\nPillars of Value\n\nAcademic Excellence\n\nProfessionalism\n\nCompassion\n\nLeadership\n\nCommunity Service\n\nThe 5-year strategic plan is updated annually with input from a team of faculty, staff, and students.
