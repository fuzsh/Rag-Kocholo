        "text": "If you value your sanity, stay far away from the MSN nursing department at Houston Baptist University. From the very first semester they’re have been issues. One would think the professionalism would be top notch at a university, but my experience is there is a lack of effort that is unbelievable for Phd personnel. I have emailed the provost several times and 1.5 years later things are no better. We are self taught, the professors make no effort to lecture or record a lecture. They drag their feet... Read More in the clinical approval process and God forbid you make a complaint, they drag it out longer; they make last minute changes to clinical paperwork, require less than 24 hr notices of required meetings, and the personnel is constantly changing. L I don’t care how much money you have to pay for your masters, it would behoove you to choose any program besides HBU MSN program. This is a combined FNP/PNP program. Many of the staff have worked from home during COVID and use this as an excuse for every thing. No one answers their phone, they say leave an email and then there is no effort to respond to the email. If you love yourself, go some place other than here.\n\nRead Less\n\nHouston Baptist University is a wonderful, prestigious university that is respected by many who live in the Houston area. It is a quiet and peaceful environment. The campus is clean and neatly manicured. I used to like to walk around a body of water to enjoy the sounds of nature and peace. I believe I received a great education from Houston Baptist. I was challenged in my assignments and class discussions were eye-opening. I heard perspectives that I had not really known some good, some questionable,... Read More but I learned. I had several professors that I feel cared about my future. They wanted me to do well and they encouraged me. I could tell that they had picked up on my personality traits and the content that I shared while we had discussions and would make suggestions on some careers I should consider. It is a private Christian university so you may have one of your professor start class or test with prayer. Again, remember that this is a Baptist school, students are required to take three Christian classes in order to graduate no matter what the students religion is. Though all religions are welcomed all students had to take Old and New Testament classes and Christian Doctrine. In addition to those Christian courses, a number of volunteer, bible study and convocation hours are required to graduate. This is a conservative university. Most students are Republicans and most are Christians. One word of advice is to make sure that there is a market for your degree. Be aware if you must get an advanced degree in order to be more marketable in this economy. Lastly, Houston Baptist is expensive. Have scholarships and grants to minimize your expenses.\n\nRead Less\n\nMy experience at Houston Baptist University was a good one because the teacher to student ratio was very low. It provided specialized instruction and gave me opportunities to perform outside of the university that many other institutions may not have had available. I graduated in 1990 and the music department was not very big, and this made for a very tight-knit community among the music department. I have seen how the music department has evolved and it has not been very favorable. The facilities... Read More have improved tremendously, but the focus on music has changed over the years. The school is known for its nursing program and I know that many departments are very well respected. The music program partnered with local churches to find opportunities for young musicians to play in orchestras and sing in choirs on a regular basis. These opportunities provided a wonderful training ground for musicians who often performed alongside their teachers and mentors in the industry. The size of the program is ideal for teachers and students to get to know each other. Small ensembles proved to be very educational and the camaraderie between faculty and students was very professional. Many students who did not pursue music degrees played and performed with ensembles at HBU. The school of music offered numerous scholarships for individuals to be part of the various ensembles while they concentrated on other areas of study. It made for very filled out and complete ensembles and offered students the opportunities to keep playing and performing .\n\nRead Less\n\nI attended Houston Baptist University in 2008. I decided upon that college because of its proximity to my home and the scholarship I received. I am Christian and attending a Baptist University was another positive factor for me deciding to attend HBU. The positive aspects of HBU are the conservative environment, including liberal arts in the core curriculum, and the faculty to student ratio. The conservative environment are for those seeking that type of environment. The college maintains constant... Read More faith based opportunities for students to participate in. Including liberal arts in the completion of the college degree will lead to the student receiving an introduction to subject matter that a student may not otherwise receive. The size of HBU allows students and faculty to have a stronger relationship. The negative aspects of HBU are the limited amount of degrees and the constant degree changes. Due to the size of the university, there are only certain degree programs that are competitive in todays society. While in my final year at HBU the college administrators decided to remove the Communication degree without informing the current students in a reasonable manner. This led to me finding suitable classes last minute to help complete my degree. Another negative aspect of HBU is that due to the smaller nature of the University the on campus student life is limited. This limitation hinders a students opportunity to expand their interests beyond educational. Overall, if you are interested in the larger more established degree programs such as Nursing at HBU you will succeed in your educational journey. However, if you want to pursue one of the degrees offered at other Houston based universities I would recommend attending those universities rather than HBU.\n\nRead Less\n\nFirst off I decided to not swear in this review but this is how much stress that this school has caused for me. ANY future students Who are considering this school PLEASE DON'T BOTHER, RUN!!!! this school is full of disappointments. The staff does not know anything be prepared to be transferred to everyone and still nothing resolved also to mention racism AARON S. at careers and calling is definitely a racist he provided me with jobs from housekeeping to basically not earning anything I believe because... Read More of my race I am a (BLACK EDUACATED WOMAN) who has one degree already and felt that he belittle me. Financial aid workers need training all over again the black lady at the front desk in admissions with the short black wig is unprofessional and rude as ever. This school is overrated and over priced I decided to drop all of my classes why pay 2,000 per class at a unprofessional supposedly private school when I could get better help and be more comfortable at a great public and larger University Dr. Ferrel tried his best to make a sale at hbu but after meeting with him I was not convinced I grew even more frustrated Kathy that's in the same department as Ferrel is not the best secretary her information was mostly wrong. In all honesty this is the issues that I encountered with HBU I'm emotionally and mentally drained I'm now behind a few classes thanks to HBU for misleading me and having me wait til the semester start to meet with me which had me late to transfer to a different university.\n\nRead Less\n\nI started the MBA program at HBU this fall, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I am working full time and going to school full time, so they are work-schedule sensitive with classes and are very willing to help. From master students' orientation to in-class help, the professors are very attentive and willing to help further you in your career. The curriculum covered has been beneficial already in my professional life, and I am looking forward to learning more about management in business. After... Read More graduate school, I plan to sit for my CPA. I relayed this information to the professors and representatives at the university, and they have been very responsive and willing to assist with this through classes needed for a specialization in accounting and schedule adjustments.\n\nRead Less\n\nAttending Houston Baptist University for a Bachelor's degree in Biology had its pros and cons. The science department there all had the expertise and knowledge that was necessary to teach the material, and for students to understand and learn to the best of their ability. Some courses were certainly more rigorous than others, so the academic merit of the university is slightly above average. However, the overall university outside of the science and math department can be quite polarizing to some... Read More students since it is a Christian liberal arts university. While this does not cross over or influence science education (as that would be out of curriculum ) it can be a turn off for some students.\n\nRead Less\n\nThe pros of this graduate program is the expertise these professors have in each class you take. They are very knowledgable and can tailor any discussion to real life experience. They give you a foundation that you can build on with each additional class you can take. Even if you do not have a degree in business, they are able to put you on even footing with the rest of the class. The professors are very helpful, and offer assistance if you need it. The con of this graduate program is the class time.... Read More It is from 6pm-10pm. It gets draining after a while, but the professors help you manage it . The cohort does a really good job of banding together and helping each other through this process. It is a really great program, and I have learned a lot. Everything I've learned is easily applicable to everyday life.\n\nRead Less"
