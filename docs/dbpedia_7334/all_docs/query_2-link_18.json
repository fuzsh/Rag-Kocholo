        "text": "June 7, 2024\n\nYou’re wondering if 1300 is a good SAT score and the short answer to that question is “Yes”. In fact, scoring a 1300 on the dot places you in the 86th percentile among all SAT takers and around the 90th percentile of all high school students nationwide. Of course, “good” is a relative term in the world of college admissions so we’ll give you some further context by looking at the average SAT scores at a number of institutions across the selectivity spectrum.\n\nIs a 1300 a Good SAT Score for the Ivy Leagues?\n\nWe could give you some mumbo jumbo about how evaluations are made on a holistic basis and how since many elite schools remain test-optional it really depends on other factors, but that wouldn’t be intellectually honest. Outside of very rare cases and dependent on factors such as racial background, legacy status, and athletic recruitment, it is extremely rare for a student to gain acceptance to an Ivy League institution.\n\nFirstly, the average SAT score for enrolled students at Columbia, Princeton, Penn, Brown, Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, and Cornell is well over 1500. Additionally, the acceptance rates at most of those schools are in the 4-5% range. Therefore, our honest assessment is if your SAT is around a 1300, you would need to improve your score significantly to prove competitive at Ivy League schools. The same goes for colleges like Stanford, UChicago, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Rice, Carnegie Mellon, Williams College. Ditto for other schools of that ilk.\n\nInterested in working with a professional to improve your SAT score?\n\nView our Preferred SAT Prep Providers\n\nIs 1300 a Good SAT Score for Most Colleges?\n\nEarning a 1300 on the SAT is good enough score to earn your way into thousands of public and private universities, including some of those that are ranked in the #100 in the United States.\n\nWhat are the Best Colleges for a Student with a 1300?\n\nTo assist your college search, we wanted to highlight 30 awesome colleges with an average SAT around a 1300. Assuming solid grades in a rigorous curriculum, many of these schools may be within your reach. However, we must point out that there are way more than 30 schools that may fit your needs. Our hope is this will serve as a useful launching off point for your college search. Additionally, we invite you to explore more schools on our Dataverse and College List-Building Tool.\n\nMore About our College Cards (Below)\n\nFor each of the schools, College Transitions will provide you with—when available—the university’s:\n\nEnrollment\n\nCost of Attendance\n\nAcceptance Rate\n\nMedian SAT\n\nMedian ACT\n\nRetention Rate\n\nGraduation Rate\n\nWe will also include a longer write-up of each college’s:\n\nAcademic Highlights – Includes facts like student-to-faculty ratio, average class size, number of majors offered, and most popular majors.\n\nProfessional Outcomes – Includes info on the rate of positive outcomes, companies employing alumni, and graduate school acceptances.\n\nBest Colleges for 1300 SAT\n\nArizona State University\n\nTempe, AZ\n\nAcademic Highlights: The faculty-to-student ratio is a fairly high 19:1, but not all classes call for stadium seating.
