Those essential functions are outlined in the Essential Requirements Form.\n\nAll students admitted to the program will be offered the opportunity and encouraged to alert faculty to any limitations which might impact their accessibility and completion of the program. Any student who identifies or displays limitations with any of the above mentioned skills, should work with PTA faculty to determine realistic and acceptable accommodations or ways to compensate, so that the student can have potential for success in the program. Accommodations used in the program will be structured to be consistent with situations the student could expect in the clinical work environment.\n\nThe PTA Program at Louisiana Christian University is in agreement with and adheres to the college’s policy noted below on accommodations for individuals with disabilities:\n\n“A student that qualifies under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and who desires modifications or accommodations should contact the Director of the Program to Assist Student Success (Student Success Center) 487-7629 for information and guidance.”\n\nIt is the student’s responsibility to notify the department if there is any reason they cannot meet the standards for the PTA Program with or without reasonable accommodation.\n\nIn order to be considered as a candidate for the Louisiana College PTA Program, applicants must possess a successful academic record as evidenced by a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 and grade of “C” or better in all prerequisite courses. Due to the competitive nature of the application process, a higher overall GPA may be desirable. Application packets must include TWO official (original) transcripts from each/every university/college attended. Transcripts must be received by the student in a sealed envelope bearing the Registrar’s signature on the envelope’s back flap. All official transcripts are to remain in the sealed envelopes and submitted in the application packet. Courses and grades from one school printed on another college’s transcripts are not acceptable. Applicants planning to enroll in classes during the Spring 2023 semester must have additional transcripts sent upon completion of the term.\n\nPrerequisite Courses Hours College Connection (CC100)1Composition (EN101)3Anatomy and Physiology I w/ Lab (BI 231 & 232)4Anatomy and Physiology II w/ Lab (BI 233 & BI 234)4Chemical Principles for Allied Health (CH 131 & 132)4College Algebra (MA111)3First Aid and CPR (HP 203)1Modern Communication (CA 150)3Developmental Psychology (PY 230)3Religion (RL 105)3Computer Science (CS 140)1Total Credit Hours30\n\nApplicants are required to complete a minimum of 30 hours of observation in two different types of physical therapy settings (minimum of 60 total hours). A Clinical Observation Form is to be completed by a licensed physical therapist in each setting in which at least 30 hours of observation were completed. Two Clinical Observation Forms are contained within this application packet (one for each clinical setting). Although a minimum of 60 hours of observation is required, additional hours increase the applicant's selection rating score thereby increasing his/her chance of being accepted.\n\nApplicants are to complete section A of the Clinical Observation Form and provide a self-addressed stamped envelope along with the form to each physical therapist that will provide the documentation. Only one physical therapist per facility may complete a form. Each form should be submitted in the application packet in a sealed envelope with the therapist’s signature written across the seal. Clinical Observation Forms must be submitted in this manner in order to be considered with the application.\n\nCandidates must possess the personal characteristics necessary to meet the program goals as evidenced by Reference Evaluation Forms. Applicants are required to provide three non-family members with Reference Evaluation Forms to be completed and returned to the applicant using the self-addressed envelope provided by the applicant.\n\nForms cannot be completed by the physical therapist completing the Clinical Observation Form. Completed Reference Evaluation Forms are to be returned in the application packet to the Louisiana Christian University Physical Therapist Assistant Program office in a sealed envelope with the signature of the individual completing the form across the seal. Reference Evaluation Forms must be submitted in this manner in order to be considered with the application.\n\nThe Joint Commission, which accredits healthcare facilities across the country, enforced background screening beginning in September 2004 and has set requirements for students in the healthcare field to complete the same background check as hospital employees. A criminal history may also disqualify one from becoming licensed as a physical therapist assistant in the state of Louisiana.\n\nA background investigation and drug screening must be completed prior to acceptance into the Louisiana Christian University Physical Therapist Assistant Program. Applicants are responsible for the payment of $123.00 to cover the cost of their background investigation and drug screening which must be conducted by CastleBranch®.\n\nTo initiate your background clearance and drug screening, go to the CastleBranch® website (https://portal.castlebranch.com/LQ23 ) and follow the step-by-step process. Only the background check and drug screen should be purchased and completed at this time; the compliance tracker is not required until full entry into the program has been granted. The profile information you input will be sent directly to the program office upon completion.\n\nThe following searches are required for students beginning the clinical rotation program through the Louisiana Christian University Physical Therapist Assistant Program and are offered as a package through the CastleBranch Link above:\n\n1. Parish Criminal History Record Search\n\n2. Nationwide Record Indictor\n\n3. 5 Hair Follicle Drug Testing\n\n4. Social Security Alert\n\n5. Residence History\n\n6. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse\n\nA copy of the registration form required for completion of the background check and drug screening which are available from the CastleBranch® website, must be included in the complete application packet. Please initiate your background check as soon as possible to ensure all searches are completed by the deadline for application submission. If you should have any questions, please contact the PTA program office at 318-487-7162.\n\nAdditional Program Information\n\nAdmissions / Selection process\n\nEstimated cost of program\n\nCurriculum\n\nSelection Rating Form\n\nClinical Handbook\n\nStudent Handbook\n\nAdmissions Interview Rubric\n\nFinancial Fact Sheet\n\nAdditional Program Information & Forms\n\nChrist instructs us in scripture as to how we are to communicate with one another related to grievances we have with others. Students and others stakeholders of the program are encouraged to follow the example provided in scripture if they have a complaint about the program by first going directly to the person involved (e.g. course instructor/faculty member, fellow student, clinical instructor) in an effort to address the complaint. If satisfactory resolution of the situation is not achieved, the individual is encouraged to submit their complaint about the PTA program on the Complaint Form provided on the program’s website as well as an appendix in both the PTA Student and Clinical Handbooks. All complaints submitted to the PTA program that fall outside due process will be reviewed by the Program Director who will seek to appropriately respond to the complaint at the program level. Those individuals seeking to submit a complaint about the PTA program are encouraged to do so on the Complaint Form provided on the program’s website as well as an appendix in both the PTA Student and Clinical Handbooks. If the issue cannot be adequately addressed at the program level or the complaint concerns the PTA Program Director, the Division Chair of Allied Health will be notified of the complaint. The focus of the resolution of complaint process will be to determine how the complaint might be resolved and used constructively in the assessment and improvement of the program and its ability to achieve program objectives thus safely and effectively serving the community. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the complainant will receive a written response from the Program Director or Division Chair of Allied Health detailing resolution of the complaint or, when necessary, offered to meet privately with the Program Director to discuss the resolution process. Complaints received by the PTA program from various sources including clinical education sites, employers of graduates, and the general public are maintained by the Program Director in a private and confidential manner (in a locked file cabinet housed in the office of the PTA program director)and are made available for viewing only by authorized individuals including but not limited to those involved in the performance improvement activities of the program (i.e., Academic Coordinator of Clinical Education, other PTA faculty, College Administration). Records of complaints will be maintained in a secured, private file in the PTA program office for five years.\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant (PTA)"
