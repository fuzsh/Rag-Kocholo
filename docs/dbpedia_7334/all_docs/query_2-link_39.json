        "text": "According to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), there are 1,600 private non-profit colleges in the country, serving some 3.4 million students. Small private colleges and universities in the United States offer a commitment to high quality education as well as close personal faculty-student interaction. As a result, they often attract some of the brightest students, which can make admission highly competitive. These colleges often come with some of the highest price tags on tuition, too. Students, however, shouldn't be quick to dismiss their chances of attending these schools. Financial support from small private schools can slash printed tuition costs by as much as half, according to the NAICU. Full-time students at private four-year schools receive on average $17,630 in grant assistance toward their college costs. As much as 20 percent of the students at one small private college in the Pacific Northwest received academic or need-based grants to cover their tuition in 2013.\n\nPopular Online Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nBest Affordable Small Private Colleges\n\n#1 Small Private Colleges And Universities In The U.S.\n\nVirginia Union University\n\nRichmond, VA\n\n4 years\n\nOnline + Campus\n\nAfter the American Civil War, the ABHMS formed two separate schools: Wayland Seminary and the Richmond Theological Institute.

Our most important metric -- affordability -- accounts for 60% of our formula. We also consider academic quality, program offerings, online enrollment, and graduation rates.\n\nThis ranking is from 2021. To learn more, consult our school ranking methodology.\n\nThe Benefits of Small Private Colleges\n\nEven among the relatively low number of small private colleges in the country, there can be great diversity between degree programs. Some are known for their academic specialties, their historical place in American education, or for their faculties. Among them, these are some of the most-attractive assets: Academic Standards. One of the reasons small private colleges enjoy prestige is because they consistently establish high academic standards for the faculty and student body. Admission is highly competitive. The college may be celebrated for specific academic disciplines or for offering a well-rounded liberal arts education based on small class sizes, led by distinguished educators.\n\nFreedom and Personalization\n\nMost small private schools establish and maintain their own requirements for undergraduate degrees, promoting the utmost flexibility for students who want to frame their education around a customized core curriculum. Professors also enjoy the academic freedom to create contemporary and evolving courses to accommodate students' interests and passions.\n\nFaculty Excellence and Commitment\n\nMost private schools do not have graduate programs, so professors do their own undergraduate teaching. In large public institutions, students can find themselves in large lecture halls for classes that are led by student or graduate assistants. Private college professors include world-renowned lecturers devoted to teaching, rather than overworked faculty who juggle teaching with the research and publishing requirements that are typical of many large public colleges.\n\nMentoring, Class Size and Faculty Access\n\nAccording to U.S. News and World Report, public and private universities can often have a student body that consists of more than 30,000 students, while small private college enrollment averages 1,900 scholars. The student-faculty ratio at small private colleges averages around 10:1 and may be as low as five students per professor. As a result, students are able to build a more personal relationship with faculty and are mentored by professors that have more time for them than professors would at larger universities.\n\nCommunity\n\nBecause of small class sizes and small-school collegiality, students forge deep friendships based on common goals and philosophies. School academic societies, clubs, and campus activities have an easy intimacy about them since students aren't numbers sitting in 300-person lecture halls; they're known to each other and to their professors, which encourages a sense of community.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nRecent education statistics debunk a lot of myths around the affordability of small private colleges. Small schools have a reputation of offering a high percentage of need-based grants. The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities reports a $12,460 average total (tuition and fees) cost to attend a private four-year college in 2013-2014, which is less than half the $30,090 published tuition at those schools. Students graduating high school with a high grade point average may find that some small private colleges are keen on helping them pay for their higher education. Small college financial aid officers can help students find grants, scholarships and loans to can help slash tuition costs.\n\nAC Online: Private Colleges with Million-Dollar Returns\n\nWhat's a college education worth? While there's no foolproof way to gauge degree value, certain colleges must be doing something right. Just one percent of colleges across the country have a documented million-dollar return on investment (ROI): alumni whose lifetime earnings surpass those of non-degree holders by seven figures.\n\nThe following colleges and universities represent the mere 46 private institutions that make up this Top 1%. These post-secondary juggernauts continually graduate young professionals who earn top dollar over the course of their careers.\n\nTo identify the private institutions with seven-figure returns, AC Online examined tuition rates, fees, and alumni salaries for more than 7,000 U.S. colleges and universities. Primary data sources include the Integrated Post-Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Carnegie Foundation, and PayScale.com – four of the most trusted names in college- and career-related data.\n\nAC Online has compiled a list of affordable small private schools for you to consider. From New York to California, there are plenty of options across the country for students seeking smaller classroom sizes with a modest price tag. All the schools below are accredited, have tuition and fees totaling less than $15,000, and enroll less than 4,000 students."
