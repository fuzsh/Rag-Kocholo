This experience inspired her to work full-time in the classroom as their second grade teacher the following year. Outside of the classroom, Jalyn loves to read, write, and travel as much as she can, although her path always leads back to teaching. In the Spring of 2024, Jalyn had the opportunity to substitute for 7th grade English at ASA. Having thoroughly enjoyed this experience, she then moved on to begin teaching full-time as the 5th Grade English teacher.\n\nContent/Grade Levels:\n\nEnglish/5th Grade\n\nTeaching Years of Teaching Experience: 2\n\nSchools taught at: ASADesert Mirage Elementary School and substitute teaching/various locations\n\nTotal Years at ASA: First Year\n\nEducation and Degrees Earned:\n\nB.A – Major Creative Writing/Minor Film & Television (University of Arizona)\n\nWhy ASA?\n\nASA is the perfect combination of academic rigor and artistic expression that truly changes the lives of the students (and teachers) who are lucky enough to enjoy this environment.\n\nLisa Speck received her Bachelor’s degree in Journalism from the University of Arizona in 1986, then moved to California to complete a two-year post-baccalaureate Elementary Education Certification/Degree from San Diego State University.
