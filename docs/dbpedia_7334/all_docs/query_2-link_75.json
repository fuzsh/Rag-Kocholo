        "text": "The east coast is full of internship and business opportunities, as well as educational options, but if you’re looking for excitement and the hustle and bustle of an urban education, New Jersey would be an excellent option for you. With big cities like Philadelphia and New York come big opportunities.\n\nThe New Jersey State Department of Education offers tuition aid that can help you attend one of its many colleges and universities. The Tuition Aid Grant (TAG) and Part-Time Tuition Aid Grant are available to attendees of all New Jersey colleges and universities. At certain colleges, the state even administers the Educational Opportunity Fund.\n\nRelated Programs That Might Interest You\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nCommunity College students are eligible for the state’s Opportunity Grant. Women and minority groups, specifically, are eligible for the Governor’s Industry Vocations Scholarship. More information about these programs can be found at https://www.state.nj.us/nj/education/aid/.\n\nBesides all the educational opportunities and assistance programs, New Jersey is full of enjoyable places to visit. With nearly 130 miles of coastline, inland mountains, and open access to all that New York City has to offer, this state has everything an aspiring young student could want, and more.\n\nRanking Methodology\n\nThe Best Colleges in New Jersey ranking is based on four main data points in four categories:\n\nSchools are ranked based on four data points in four categories:\n\nAffordability (net price)\n\nStudent Satisfaction (retention rate)\n\nAcademic Quality (4-year graduation rate)\n\nSalary After Attending (the median earnings of former students who received federal financial aid, 10 years after entering the school)\n\nAll data for this ranking was gathered from the National Center for Education Statistics and College Scorecard.\n\nIn the case of a tie in scoring, the average net price was the determining factor for which school received the higher rank–the lower the net price, the higher the ranking.\n\nBest Accredited Colleges and Universities in New Jersey 2023\n\n1. Princeton University\n\nScore: 100.0\n\nAverage Net Price: $9,836\n\nRetention Rate: 91%\n\nGraduation Rate: 97%\n\nSalary After Attending: $95,689\n\nThe prestigious private institution that is Princeton University can be found in Princeton, New Jersey. It is a relatively modest educational establishment with a total undergraduate enrollment of 5,321 students. Given that just 6% of applicants are accepted each year, the admissions process is highly difficult. The fields of economics, computer science, and public policy analysis are among the most popular majors. U.S. News and World Report ranked Princeton University #1 among national universities, #3 in best undergraduate teaching, and #30 in most innovative schools. The faculty at Princeton is widely recognized as world-class experts in their respective fields, as well as remarkable educators and devoted instructors.\n\n2. New Jersey Institute of Technology\n\nScore: 95.3\n\nAverage Net Price: $18,582\n\nRetention Rate: 89%\n\nGraduation Rate: 79%\n\nSalary After Attending: $80,043\n\nThe New Jersey Institute of Technology comes in at #97 among National Universities and sits at #118 among Best Value Schools. A few of the most popular majors include architecture, biology, and engineering. With an acceptance rate of just 69%, an applicant's GPA is one of the essential factors of acceptance, alongside letters of recommendation. Plenty of NJIT classes host less than 20 students at a time, which makes class lectures both more engaging and personal. NJIT's \"Major & Degree Finder\" page states that they offer \"122-degree programs through six professional schools and colleges.\" NJIT offers more than 46 online programs--14 online master's degree programs and 21 graduate certificate programs.\n\n3. Rutgers University-Newark\n\nScore: 94.8\n\nAverage Net Price: $15,996\n\nRetention Rate: 85%\n\nGraduation Rate: 71%\n\nSalary After Attending: $65,661\n\nRutgers' additional campus is located in Newark and ranks at #115 among National Universities, unlike its New Brunswick counterpart. Nonetheless, Newark is still an excellent option. Though undergraduate enrollment and campus size are also significantly less than in Rutgers' other locations, the quality of education is the same. Some popular degrees include accounting, finance, and criminal justice. Graduate students attend either the School of Law, Business School, or the School of Criminal Justice--which is also highly ranked. One of the most notable aspects of this Rutgers campus is its remarkable alumni list, including several Federal Bureau of Investigation employees and even a former U.S. Secretary of Energy. This campus maintains over 100 different clubs and organizations despite its small size.\n\nImage Source\n\n4.
