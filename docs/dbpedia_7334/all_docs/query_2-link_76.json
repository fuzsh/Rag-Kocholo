After all, this state has it all: some of the most beautiful beaches on the east coast, picturesque mountains on the west, lively cities in the central part, and the largest research park in America, the Research Triangle Park.\n\nNorth Carolina also has a low cost of living, which makes the state one of the top choices for college students.\n\nWhy Attend a Christian College\n\nWhile there are many college choices for undergrads and graduate students in North Carolina, some college students prefer to enroll in a Christian college. Aside from offering a great education, why is a Christian college generally a good option for post-secondary education?\n\nChoosing which college to attend is a huge decision. Here are some reasons students opt to attend a Christian college.\n\nA Christian college helps grow your faith. Attending church services on campus, being exposed to a Christian curriculum, getting access to Christian advisors, and building your Christian worldview through what you learn and are exposed to are all important components of a Christian education.\n\nIn most secular colleges, you will be faced with different and opposing worldviews that may not align with your Christian beliefs. Enrolling in a Christian college means your faith-based values are likely incorporated into each class. Better yet, your professors and classmates hold the same spiritual values that you do.\n\nA Christian college will also offer majors that may not be available in secular colleges, such as those focused on ministry or Christian counseling. If you want to pursue a career in a Christian field, attending a top-ranked Christian college in North Carolina is a great choice.\n\nThe following list of the best Christian schools consists entirely of colleges and universities that offer four-year undergraduate degrees. Weâve identified 24 Christian colleges in North Carolina. In order to be included in this ranking list of best Christian colleges and universities, a school must self-identify as Christian, be fully accredited, and offer a broad range of bachelor degree programs.\n\nBest Christian Colleges in North Carolina\n\n#1\n\nDuke University\n\nDurham , NC\n\nOther Rankings\n\n#13 50 Best Research Universities Ranked for Undergrads in 2024\n\n#14 50 Best Private Colleges and Universities for Undergrads 2024\n\n#15 50 Best Colleges and Universities Ranked for Undergrads in 2024\n\n#17 50 Best Graduate Schools Ranked for Prospective Students in 2024\n\n#20 Best Universities in the US Ranked for Prospective Students in 2024\n\n#24 Best Universities in the World 2024\n\n#1 Best Grad Schools in North Carolina 2024\n\n#1 The Most Influential Universities and Colleges Ranked by State 2024\n\n#1 Best Research Universities in North Carolina 2024\n\n#1 Best Private Colleges in North Carolina 2024\n\n#1 Best Colleges in North Carolina 2024\n\n#4 Best Research Universities for Nursing Degrees\n\n#4 Best Research Universities for Education Degrees\n\n#5 Best Research Universities for Religious Studies Degrees\n\n#9 Best Research Universities for Anthropology Degrees\n\n#10 Best Research Universities for Philosophy Degrees\n\n#11 Best Research Universities for Psychology Degrees\n\n#11 Best Research Universities for Sociology Degrees\n\n#11 Best Research Universities for Biology Degrees\n\n#12 Best Research Universities for History Degrees\n\n#13 Best Research Universities for Political Science Degrees\n\n#13 Best Research Universities for Economics Degrees\n\n#14 Best Research Universities for English Degrees\n\n#14 Best Research Universities for Earth Sciences Degrees\n\n#16 Best Research Universities for Physics Degrees\n\n#16 Best Research Universities for Computer Science Degrees\n\n#16 Best Research Universities for Math Degrees\n\n#17 Best Research Universities for Engineering Degrees\n\n#18 Best Research Universities for Chemistry Degrees\n\n#1 Best Online Master's Programs in North Carolina 2024\n\n#1 Guide to Free Online Courses for MBA Students in 2024\n\n#1 Best Online MBA Programs in North Carolina\n\n#1 Best Online Christian Colleges and Universities for Master's Degrees\n\n#1 Best Online Master's in Nursing MSN\n\n#1 Fastest Online Doctoral Degree Programs Ranked for Students in 2024\n\n#3 Best Online Master's Programs 2024\n\n#4 Top 50 Best No GRE Online PhD Degree Programs (Doctorates)\n\n#4 Best Online Master's in Management\n\n#6 Fastest Online Master's Degrees Ranked for Students in 2024\n\n#2 Best Online PhD of Nursing (DNP) Degree Programs Ranked for 2024\n\n#9 Top 20 Best Business Schools for MBAs Ranked for Students\n\n#14 The Fastest Traditional MBA Degree Programs Ranked for 2024\n\n#16 The Best Traditional MBA Programs Ranked for Students in 2024\n\nTuition + fees\n\n$63K\n\nAcceptance\n\n6%\n\nGraduation\n\n97%\n\nStudent body\n\n18K\n\nMedian SAT/ACT\n\n1530/34\n\nCareer Outlook for degree at Duke University\n\nCost of Degree: $62,688\n\nExpenses: $20,061\n\nStarting Salary: $114,500\n\nCost Recoup Time: 13 years\n\nPaid back at 15% of annual salary\n\nWhat is Duke University known for?\n\nDuke Universityâs faculty and alumni have been influential in:\n\nNursing\n\nReligious Studies\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPsychology\n\nPhilosophy\n\nLiterature\n\nEducation\n\nLaw\n\nSociology\n\nBusiness\n\nMost Influential Alumni\n\nJerome Bruner\n\nFred Brooks\n\nKen Wilber\n\nCharlie Rose\n\nJohn W.

Thatâs because we took a fundamentally different approach. For 2024 we utilized our Concentrated Influence algorithm, designed to take away the size advantage larger schools have when we rank their faculty and alumniâs academic influence. Concentrated influence highlights smaller schools that are proportionally as successful as larger universities at cultivating influential alumni and faculty.\n\nDuke University\n\nDavidson College\n\nGuilford College\n\nQueens University of Charlotte\n\nCampbell University\n\nSalem College\n\nHigh Point University\n\nBarton College\n\nUniversity of Mount Olive\n\nGardnerâWebb University\n\nBennett College\n\nGreensboro College\n\nWilliam Peace University\n\nBelmont Abbey College\n\nMethodist University\n\nLenoirâRhyne University\n\nBrevard College\n\nDo you have a question about this topic?
