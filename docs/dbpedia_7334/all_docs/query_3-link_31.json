Our professors are mentors as well as teachers, as they integrate faith into our exemplary academic programs. And while you're in the classroom, you'll integrate dynamic learning with rock-solid faith, and begin to discern God's plan for your life. Faith and learning; at CCU, we prefer the combination."
