Here are some of the other benefits of attending a conservative college:\n\nShared values. If you identify as conservative, then a conservative college will likely align with your core values, which can make you feel more welcome and at home.\n\nReligious tolerance. Many of the conservative colleges featured in this guide are also religious institutions. If you belong to one of those religions, attending an affiliated school can make you feel comfortable practicing your faith openly.\n\nNetworking. Chances are, if you are compelled to attend a conservative college, you’ll meet people you have things in common with and make potentially life-long connections.\n\nWhat Are the Disadvantages of Attending a Conservative College?\n\nAttending a conservative college typically means forgoing some of the conventional college experiences such as partying and experimenting. Conservative colleges tend to have strict guidelines around drinking, interacting with members of the opposite sex, and dress code. Plus, some religious services or other activities are required of all students. For some students, these boundaries are desirable, but for others, they constrict growth and evolution. This is especially the case if your values do not line up with those of a conservative college.\n\nReligiously affiliated conservative colleges also tend to require courses in subjects such as Bible studies, theology, and divinity. If you are not interested in these subjects or do not want them to take up space in your limited course schedule, then a religiously affiliated conservative college might not be the best fit for you and your academic goals.\n\nWho Should Attend a Conservative College?\n\nThe best candidates to attend a conservative college are people who strongly identify with conservative values and want conservative values to be the driving force in their college experience. Students who are ambivalent or who lean more liberal will probably not thrive at a conservative college.\n\nStudents with strong religious beliefs, particularly Christian faith, may feel at home at a conservative college that is affiliated with their religious group. Those who have very strong conservative opinions about issues such as drinking, premarital sex, and appropriate attire may prefer the campus culture at a conservative college.\n\nInterested in a degree instead?\n\nLearn more about online degrees, their start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below."
