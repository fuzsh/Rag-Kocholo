        "text": "REAL-WORLD READY“How am I going to use this in the real world?” Ottawa University-Arizona faculty delight in answering this common question and usually do so with long lists of opportunities that allow and require students to put their newfound skills to work.\n\nFROM TEXTBOOK TO TANGIBLE\n\nMany OUAZ students have participated in incredible opportunities abroad. Through missional and charitable work, students are leaving their mark on the world. During a mission trip to Havana, Cuba, in January 2019, OUAZ baseball players and other students delivered 35 bags of clothing to those in need as well as baseball equipment for local children.\n\nPREPARED FOR THE FUTURE\n\nEvery student at Ottawa University-Arizona completes a Senior Core capstone course that requires research on social issues. Students must develop possible solutions to address their topics and take action to raise awareness. At OUAZ, students are provided every opportunity to make an impact on the world.\n\nENROLLMENT BY ETHNICITY\n\nNonresident aliens: 0%\n\nHispanic/Latino: 29%\n\nBlack or African American, non-Hispanic: 10%\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic: 45%\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic: 1%\n\nAsian, non-Hispanic: 2%\n\nNative Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic: 0%\n\nTwo or more races, non-Hispanic: 2%\n\nRace and/or ethnicity unknown: 11%\n\nNOT WHAT TO THINK, BUT HOW TO THINK\n\nFrom embracing spiritual values to executing business practices, students are pushed to explore, research, and evaluate questions for themselves, arriving at answers rather than being spoon-fed long lists of facts and information. At Ottawa University-Arizona, mastery is as much about the discovery of knowledge as it is the knowledge itself.\n\nTOP-LEVEL, EASILY ACCESSIBLE FACULTY\n\nWith a student-faculty ratio of 17:1, personal engagement, direction, and collaboration clearly define OUAZ’s typical professor/student relationship. Teachers know their students by name (most of the staff do, too!), and each individual gets the personal attention needed to succeed. Through a wide range of service-learning projects and experiential learning opportunities, students can also engage directly in their education by completing dynamic projects that are particularly meaningful to them.\n\nA MEANINGFUL CAREER BEGINS AT OTTAWA UNIVERSITY\n\nWith more than 20 majors offered across three schools (Arts & Sciences, Education, and Business), students can select from a wide range of majors and concentrations that prepare them for meaningful careers or graduate programs.\n\nBRAND NEW, STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITIES\n\nA new residence hall and student union opened in Fall 2019 on the OUAZ campus to augment the overall teaching and learning experience. To enhance the educational experience, other facilities have also recently opened, such as the state-of-the-art O’Dell Center for Athletics. OUAZ is the only school in the West Valley to offer facilities of this caliber.\n\nSPECIAL STUDY OPTIONS\n\nAccelerated program\n\nInternships\n\nTeacher certification program\n\nBEYOND THE CLASSROOM\n\nIn today’s global society, students often hear, “The world is your classroom.” At Ottawa University-Arizona, that means traveling abroad, working with inner-city children, and gaining insight from their fellow classmates’ diverse backgrounds and experiences.\n\nOther times, it means that the world is brought directly to the students through arts and cultural events, speakers, conferences, workshops, or weekly Personal Growth Days. OUAZ believes that, by exposing students to a broad base of ideas, experiences, and people, they learn to achieve a better understanding of who they want to become.\n\nDIVERSE SPEAKERS Some of the esteemed speakers who have come to inspire Ottawa University-Arizona students have been:\n\nDr. Anne Bradley – Vice President of Economic Initiatives at the Institute of World Politics\n\nDebbie Lesko – U.S. Representative from Arizona’s 8th District\n\nSam Acho – NFL Football player\n\nMike Sanfratello – VP for Fellowship of Christian Athletes & retired NFL player\n\nKevin Youngblood – Founder & President of Odysseyware Inc.\n\nBay Forrest – Founder of Focus Ministries and retired NBA player\n\nJosiah Igono – Director of Peak Performance for the Texas Rangers\n\nSheriff Paul Penzone – Maricopa County Sheriff\n\nDr. Arthur Robinson – President & Research Director of the Oregon Institute of Science & Medicine\n\nANNUAL CONFERENCES/EVENTS\n\nThere is always something for students to do. Ottawa University holds a variety of events every year, including:\n\nEmotional Health Week\n\nNorwood Jones Convocation\n\nBlack History Month\n\nAngell Snyder School of Business Symposium\n\nVOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES\n\nOUAZ is continuing to build volunteer relationships as the new university experiences growth. To date, the following volunteer opportunities are available:\n\nCircle K International\n\nSt. Mary’s Food Bank\n\nHabitat for Humanity\n\nPERSONAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES\n\nPersonal growth is a cornerstone of student life at Ottawa University-Arizona. Opportunities for life-changing experiences include, but are not limited to:\n\nWeekly Personal Growth Days (PGD’s) featuring worship music, notable speakers, and “adulting” workshops\n\nDonor-provided scholarships to attend the annual Foundation for Economic Education Conference in Atlanta\n\nHonorariums for participating in a reading colloquium with students from other local schools on the topic “Toleration in a Free Society”\n\nThe opportunity to apply to travel to Israel as part of Ottawa’s relationship with Passages Israel\n\nSuch professional opportunities as an Insurance/Risk Management Career Night and other networking events\n\nSCHOOL LOCATION\n\nOttawa University’s residential campus in Surprise, Ariz., is 30 miles northwest of Phoenix.\n\nATHLETICS\n\nAthletic Association: NAIA\n\nAthletic Conference: Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC)\n\nOUAZ Varsity Athletic Teams: (24) Baseball, Basketball (men/women), Beach Volleyball (women), Cheer & Dance (men/women), Cross Country (men/women), Football, Golf (men/women), Soccer (men/women), Softball, Swimming & Diving (men/women), Tennis (men/women), Track & Field (men/women), Volleyball (men/women), Water Polo (men/women).\n\nTeam Name: Spirit\n\nMascot: “Fang” (gray wolf)\n\nColors: Orange, Crimson & Black\n\nRESIDENCE LIFECampus housing options. Coed Dorms\n\nApartments for married students\n\nApartments for single students\n\nSpecial housing for disabled students\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? At Ottawa University-Arizona, endless opportunities abound. Whether students want to make groundbreaking scientific discoveries or change lives in a classroom full of children, it all starts right here. Students at OUAZ know it’s okay if they are not sure what they want to do. That’s why each student gets their own personal Faculty Mentor to help figure it all out!\n\nEvery OUAZ student, along with their Faculty Mentor, craft a LifePlan Narrative—a look at their goals, where they are in life, and where they want to be. They explore facets of life, including Academic & Intellectual, Career & Lifestyle, Healthy Relationships, Identity Formation, Health & Wellness, and Enlightened Faith.\n\nCRITICAL THINKING One feature that distinguishes Ottawa University-Arizona from other universities that offer liberal arts and pre-professional education is its unique Liberal Arts Studies program (LAS). Throughout a student’s broad area coursework at OUAZ, they will be challenged to develop critical thinking skills that will prepare them for post-graduate endeavors, such as entering the workforce or going to graduate or professional school.\n\nPERSONAL GROWTH OUAZ is so committed to the notion that students should develop work-ready and practical life skills that it has eliminated standard classes on Wednesdays through each 8-week term. During OUAZ’s unique “Personal Growth Days,” Wednesdays are set aside for advising, tutoring, and private study in the morning. The remainder of the day is split into three parts, which include “Spirit Life,” a time of fellowship when the OUAZ community comes together to hear an impactful speaker along with music from a praise and worship band; “The Gathering,” a community dining experience on campus that allows for networking in a welcoming and accepting atmosphere; and “Adulting Workshops,” which aim to hone and shape student competencies in such areas as public speaking, project management, leadership, negotiations, personal finance, research, conflict management, and much more.\n\nTuition & Cost\n\nTuition: $29,980\n\nFees: $2,450\n\nRoom & Board: $10,283\n\nRoom Only: $4,283\n\nBoard Only: $6,000\n\nAid\n\nTOP SCHOLARS SCHOLARSHIP COMPETITION Ottawa University-Arizona’s semi-annual “Top Scholars” competition is a multi-phase scholarship competition that awards the Presidential (full-tuition) and Provost Scholarships (three-quarter-tuition). The University is looking for “Top Scholars” who strive to make a difference in their own lives as well as the lives of others. This rigorous competition is only open to students who have achieved a composite ACT score of 25 or greater, earned a minimum high school GPA of 3.5, and have been accepted to OUAZ.\n\nThrough the “Top Scholars” competition, awards are presented to an elite group of students who promise to add significant value to the University’s academic, cultural, and civic environment."
