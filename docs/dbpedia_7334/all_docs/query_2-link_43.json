        "text": "With juniors and seniors in high school already looking to college, many may be wondering, “What’s the right school for me?” Many factors contribute to that answer. Perhaps you’re looking for a school that has a Christian background that feels like home. Maybe you’re looking for a particular field of study within Christian education. Maybe you want to stay close to your hometown—or not.\n\nWhatever you’re looking for in a Christian college, there are undoubtedly many schools to choose from. In light of that, we’ve compiled a list of the 75 best Christian colleges based on a variety of research sources. These top Christian colleges have been ranked highly and offer great academic programs.
