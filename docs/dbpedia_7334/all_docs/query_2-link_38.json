        "text": "Don’t think of a college with the lowest acceptance rate as a bad thing; take it as a challenge to earn yourself a life-changing degree from an institution that works hard each year to offer a distinctive academic experience that it doesn’t want to share with just anyone.\n\nThese colleges and universities, a number of which are in the Ivy League, have acceptance rates as low as 5 percent, but for good reason. Most of the academic programs offered at these universities are incredibly rigorous and, as a result, carry internationally-known reputations and offer a high return on the student’s investment. At the same time, many of these schools have need-blind admissions policies, offering plenty of financial aid, free tuition or covered costs to those whose family incomes sit below a certain mark.\n\nSo if you’re a hard worker willing to put in the sweat and dedication it takes to graduate from some of these affordable colleges and universities, look no further. We’ve taken the time to list the top 50 cheapest colleges with the lowest acceptance rates because they are absolutely worth giving a try.\n\nTo create this ranking, we started with U.S. News & World Report’s list of the top 100 colleges and universities with the lowest acceptance rates. We then narrowed that list down to the 50 cheapest colleges and universities using the National Center for Education Statistics’ College Navigator Database.\n\nFinding an affordable college degree at the best colleges and universities is important to us; therefore, placement in this ranking is focused solely on the “net cost” of each school, as reported by NCES. Additionally, we included the student retention rate to show that while some of these schools are difficult to get into, they’re so rewarding that the accepted and enrolled students choose to keep coming back. Finally, we sourced and highlighted general “about” and admissions information from each of the schools’ websites.\n\nAll Net Costs and Retention Rates are sourced from College Navigator, unless otherwise stated. The few tuition-free federal service academies are ranked according to their acceptance rates, with the lowest rate scoring the lower number ranking. Also keep in mind that the university acceptance rate does not always speak to the admissions process of individual degree programs.\n\n50. University of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nOf the 38,918 applications to join the Class of 2020 at the University of Pennsylvania, just 3,674 hopeful students were offered admission into this prestigious institution.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 9.4%, according to UPenn’s website\n\nNet Cost: $22,944\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 98%\n\nThe most “expensive” college on this list, the University of Pennsylvania is a private Ivy League research university with 21,358 total students on its 299-acre west Philadelphia campus. To get an idea of the competition one faces for Penn admission, a whopping 97 percent of students admitted for fall 2016 came from the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class. Service is huge here, as well, with almost 14,000 students, faculty and staff participating in a few hundred Penn volunteer/community service programs each year.\n\n49. Barnard College\n\nNew York, NY\n\nBarnard College’s location in the center of New York City and next door to Columbia University offers students an incredible number of unique academic, internship and employment opportunities.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 20%\n\nNet Cost: $22,815\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 96%\n\nFounded in 1889, Barnard College is a private liberal arts university and today’s only women’s college in New York City. With a total undergraduate student enrollment of 2,500, Barnard offers the intimacy of a small college, but additionally shares resources with Columbia University, just steps away from campus. Acceptance and admission into Barnard means access to 22 libraries and two universities’ worth of available courses to choose from.\n\n48. Memphis College of Art\n\nMemphis, TN\n\nAt Memphis College of Art, admitted undergraduate students can choose to earn a BFA in fine arts, design arts, photography, animation, art education and more.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 23%\n\nNet Cost: $22,689\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 78%\n\nEstablished in 1985, Memphis College of Art is a small, private college committed to teaching the practice, history and appreciation of visual art and design. The student body at MCA is less than 500 students and 67 full and part-time faculty members bring the student-faculty ratio to 10:1. The average class size is 17 students. MCA awards more than $5 million annually in institutional aid to its well-deserving students. Those talented enough to earn a place on this campus have access to free gallery exhibitions and artist lectures throughout the year.\n\n47. Colgate University\n\nHamilton, NY\n\nAlumni of Colgate University include the president of NBC Universal and COO of News Corporation, the CEO of NYSE Euronext, leaders at the Glimmerglass Opera, the Green Bay Packers and more.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 27%\n\nNet Cost: $22,463\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 94%\n\nA private liberal arts institution founded in 1819, Colgate University offers 55 majors to its 2,900 undergraduate students in Central New York. The student-faculty ratio is 9:1, average class size is 17 students and the average total award for students receiving financial aid is $52,075.

University of Richmond\n\nRichmond, VA\n\nWithin just six months of graduation, 94 percent of those who earned degrees at the University of Richmond find employment.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 31%\n\nNet Cost: $22,400\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 93%\n\nThe University of Richmond is a private liberal arts college that will pay 100 percent of what the family of an admitted student can’t cover.

An interesting distinction, The Richmond Guarantee promises a fellowship of up to $4,000 for one summer research or internship experience for every undergraduate.\n\n45. Rice University\n\nHouston, TX\n\nRice University may be difficult to get into, but 99 percent of its full-time instructional faculty have doctorates or terminal degrees in their fields.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 16%\n\nNet Cost: $22,061\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 96%\n\nChartered in 1891, Rice University is a private research institution that offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs, but has a distinctive commitment to undergraduate research and education; about 65 percent of undergrads participate in research prior to graduation. With 3,879 undergraduate students (fall 2016), Rice received 19 applications for every available spot in its freshman class. Rice may not have the highest student retention rate on this list, but The Princeton Review ranked the university No. 1 for happiest students.\n\n44. Vassar College\n\nPoughkeepsie, NY\n\nAs a leader in producing PhD candidates, Vassar College capitalizes on how hard its students are willing to work.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 26%\n\nNet Cost: $21,933\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 96%\n\nEstablished in 1861, Vassar College is a selective, independent liberal arts college known for its beautiful 500-acre arboretum campus of manicured lawns, shaded woodland paths, the Shakespeare Garden and two buildings registered as National Historic Landmarks.

A few examples of how admission into ORU can set you up for success: 100 percent of graduates of the History, Humanities and Government department were accepted into law school, 100 percent of Pre-Med Honor Students were accepted into medical school and 100 percent of the College of Education graduates were employed within three months of commencement.\n\n42. Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nCambridge, MA\n\nAccording to the school’s website, the “MIT Nation” is equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 8%\n\nNet Cost: $21,576\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 98%\n\nKnown as one of the most prestigious universities in the nation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a private research institution that has been significant enough to receive an electrical engineering gift from Thomas Edison back in the day. Founded in 1861, MIT has inspired a slew of scientific breakthroughs and technological advances like the creation of GPS and the invention of encryption systems that enable e-commerce. That low acceptance rate is no joke, but MIT alumni are incredibly successful, having launched more than 30,000 active companies.\n\n41. Middlebury College\n\nMiddlebury, VT\n\nMiddlebury College’s admissions may be competitive, but they run on a need-blind policy, which means a student’s financial status doesn’t influence admission.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 17%\n\nNet Cost: $21,437\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 94%\n\nMiddlebury College was founded in 1800 and operates today as a residential college committed to educating students in the tradition of the liberal arts.

The approximately 2,500 undergraduate students get the benefits of small class sizes and an 8:1 student-faculty ratio, but can choose from 44 different majors and 31 NCAA varsity sports teams.\n\n40. Dartmouth College\n\nHanover, NH\n\nThe education one earns at Dartmouth College is worth the stress of getting in; its documented 20-year return-on-investment (ROI) is $822,600.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 11%\n\nNet Cost: $21,177\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 96%\n\nFounded in 1769, Dartmouth College is a private research university and member of the prestigious Ivy League, hence its incredibly competitive Ivy League acceptance rate.

The 1,290 students enjoy a 9:1 student-faculty ratio and a campus involvement unlike most other schools; they write and govern the college’s Honor Code, serve on hiring committees, manage budgets and run the 140+ clubs and organizations. Too bad they can’t up that acceptance rate.\n\n38. Colby College\n\nWaterville, ME\n\nWhile Colby College’s prospective students have been working hard to make it through this low university acceptance rate, Colby became the fourth institution of higher education in the country to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 23%\n\nNet Cost: $21,032\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 93%\n\nFounded in 1813, Colby College is one of the oldest private liberal arts colleges in the country, located on 714 picturesque acres that overlooks downtown Waterville and the Kennebec River Valley.

California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo\n\nSan Luis Obispo, CA\n\nOn the other side of that low acceptance rate, Cal Poly offers a 1,321-acre main campus and a comprehensive education that joins technical and professional curricula with arts and humanities.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 31%\n\nNet Cost: $18,530\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 95%\n\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo is a nationally-ranked public university located halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The admissions process is so highly competitive that the university received a record of 40,904 undergraduate applications for fall 2010, but only had 4,000 spots to offer.\n\n29.

This massive university offers 19 degree-granting schools and colleges that cover most professions and more than 1,300 student organizations.\n\n19. University of Virginia\n\nCharlottesville, VA\n\nUVA offers a combination of scholarships, grants, work-study and need-based loans to offer admission based on intellect and talent rather than a student’s ability to foot the bill.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 30%\n\nNet Cost: $15,945\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 96%\n\nThomas Jefferson Founded the University of Virginia in 1819, which is now comprised of 11 schools on the main campus and another college in Southwest Virginia.

If you’re looking for competition, look no further. The average GPA for admitted incoming freshmen is 4.39, and the average SAT score lands between 1940 and 2240. However, the juice is absolutely worth the squeeze. At UCLA, about 38 percent of undergraduates receive Pell Grants, which is among the highest percentages of the top-tier schools in the U.S. Graduates have gone on to become an Internet Hall of Famer, the first Chinese-born astronaut, an Academy Award-winning composer and an actor who also practices neuroscience.\n\n17.

CUNY Baruch College\n\nNew York, NY\n\nFor New York State residents who qualify, the low acceptance rate of Baruch College means little now that they can utilize the Excelsior Scholarship, the nation’s first accessible college program program.\n\nAcceptance Rate: 32%\n\nNet Cost: $9,510\n\nStudent Retention Rate: 91%\n\nBaruch College is just a couple miles from Midtown and Wall Street, so it makes sense that Forbes ranked it among the “Best Value Colleges 2017: 300 Schools Worth the Investment”.
