        "text": "Tuition Cost: This college cost me just under $30k, and I completed my degree within 2 years. If you are a full-time student, you could complete your degree in less time. I was a part-time student for 1 year and a full-time student for my final year. They offer many ways to cut down tuition costs, but you have to ask your counselor for info. Overall, the cost for me was affordable considering most bachelor's programs are over 40k.\n\nStaff Professionalism: Most professors were extremely professional,... Read More and in the dual degree program, you take 10 graduate-level courses, which are all taught by doctors (PhD students as well). These professors were the absolute best. For undergrad, I had some professors who were highly critical and graded harshly, some did not seem interested in student success, but I would say 80% of the staff went above and beyond. If you are looking for biblical applications along with secular study, this is a great fit! The college explores both secular and Christian worldviews.\n\nOnline Program: Used a blend of Google and Microsoft programs with flexibility- student email was Gmail. CCU used Blackboard but just transitioned to BrightSpace in my final year, which is a much better platform.\n\nClass Content: I felt that I learned quite a bit with this course (BS in Applied Psychology/ Clinical Counseling, Dual Degree) **no specializations**. No quizzes or exams. Classes have between 1 and 4 books, discussion boards, and a lot of papers. Most of the grading comes from papers. APA7 was used for formatting.\n\nCareer: I have not been able to get a job in the behavioral health field with this degree. I have nowhere to gain field experience or supervision to receive credentials to work, such as RBT, ABA, or more. Now I am looking at Master's programs and searching for a job to fund it (in any field that will hire me). The school does not help with the next steps for degree paths.\n\nRead Less\n\nUpon hearing about Colorado Christian University (CCU) through K-Love, I was drawn to its strong academic programs and the convenience of its online classes. As a full-time worker, the ability to manage both my job and studies effectively through CCU’s online offerings seemed like the perfect solution. The flexibility provided by the university is indeed remarkable, showing CCU's dedication to supporting students with busy schedules. However, my educational journey at CCU has been fraught with financial... Read More challenges, particularly as an out-of-state student. Despite utilizing resources like Scholarship Universe, as recommended by the university, I have been unsuccessful in securing scholarships in such a competitive environment. This issue became critically apparent when I found myself $600 short for my tuition due to unexpected health complications. This deficit prevented me from enrolling in subsequent classes, stalling my academic progression. When I sought assistance from the financial aid office, I was confronted with the reality that CCU offers minimal support for out-of-state students like me. Facing tuition costs around $27,000 a year, the lack of aid for such a relatively small amount was both surprising and disheartening. To cover my tuition, I had to resort to taking out a significant amount of student loans, exacerbating my financial strain, especially given the absence of college-level financial aid for students not residing in Colorado. Adding to these challenges is the issue of credit transferability. CCU's courses do not transfer to other institutions, effectively locking students into completing their degrees at CCU or risking a substantial financial loss. This policy adds another layer of difficulty for students who may need or want to transfer to another institution for any number of reasons. This situation has highlighted a significant disparity in support between in-state and out-of-state students at CCU. While the university provides excellent educational programs and the benefit of online class flexibility, the financial barriers and credit transfer issues for out-of-state students are significant obstacles. These are crucial factors for prospective students to consider, especially those who depend on financial aid and scholarships to afford their education. In conclusion, Colorado Christian University offers a meaningful educational experience through its online programs, but the challenges related to financial aid for out-of-state students and the non-transferability of credits are notable drawbacks. There is an urgent need for CCU to expand its financial aid options and reconsider its policies on credit transfer to ensure that all students, regardless of their geographic location, have the opportunity to pursue their educational goals without undue financial hardship or restriction.\n\nRead Less\n\nIt’s easy to enroll and seems like everything will be straightforward and like your typical college experience. However, this has not been the case, in the least. First, the cost of classes for the absolute lack of an education is laughable. I attended a private Christian university and a state University prior to enrolling and both were far cheaper for a much better education. Plus, I always received prompt responses and accurate financial information. Second, after you start your first class, you... Read More are left on your own. It takes days (if not weeks) to hear back from advisors or financial aid department. Third, the university is not upfront with costs, fees, or scholarships. I was told I would receive two $1,000 scholarships; however, I only received one and they only applied $250 per course, which barely covers the fees applied to each class. Due to the difficulty and absolute ignorance of the university staff, I dropped all future classes (prior to the drop deadline) after only one class. I was told by financial aid department that I would NOT have to pay anything because my financial aid and scholarship covered the cost of the one class. However, a few days later I received a bill for $312.00. I decided to pay the bill just to be done with the school. This brought my balance to $0.00. Then one month later, I received another statement saying I owed an additional $250.00. When I called to ask for an explanation, I was told that the person I spoke to initially made an error, and didn’t calculate it correctly. I received the same information from two separate employees. I was also told that they didn’t know why the $250.00 was just now appearing on my statement when it should’ve been included after I dropped the class. There was no explanation for the new $250.00 fee on the student finance page. It was simply included in the total cost and amount owed now. CCU is a headache and a financial disaster. If you want a quality education without having to deal with a negligent school, go to a local college or university. You won’t get the run around, all fees and financial aid will be given upfront and accurately, and you’ll get a better education for a much better price. I’ll be returning to my previous university, and my two family members who had planned to enroll in Masters programs at CCU have decided to go elsewhere.\n\nRead Less\n\nI would not recommend this school to anyone. I went from community college to here while still doing class work at my community college ( which I loved) . We had a recruiter come to my school and I thought I'd look into it. I talked to an advisor and she immediately got me signed up, which in theory sounds nice but red flag I did not know the cost of the class going into it, which I wish I would have. I was told discounts were still being applied and tried to figure financial aid out and my final... Read More bill .My previous school had all this figured out before someone enters class not after. I was rushed so fast into the class and while still attending to my other life commitments I tried to adjust and make sure I got the assignments in on time. I was also told this program was made for people whose had full time jobs and only one assignment was due a week which is not true! Billing was not made clear to say the least and having to put considerable effort into it along with everything else wasn't right. I was so rushed in and they were not upfront or transparent about the cost of the class given to me. Having just signed up I had minimal understanding of how to navigate there self service portal, where all your information is at. Now I owe $1,230 ( after \"discounts\" ) for a class that can NOT be transferred and was USELESS, it was basically an ORIENTATION class. I did not drop the class because I was trying to figure cost and how it all worked which I feel should have been shown to me in the beginning. Having attended community college before transferring and never having a problem indicates the problem is with this college. I wished I had known how they operate here which I do not feel is in the best interest of the students at all! All that matters here is getting money. I feel scammed. I would read reviews from https://www.gradreports.com/colleges/colorado-christian-university first before attending. I was looking forward to getting my degree here and growing spiritually instead all I got was a headache cheated. They were sneaky and deceptive and should not be representing the Christian faith!\n\nRead Less\n\nDo your research before you agree to join this program! I am a missionary wife and am having a very negative experience attending this school. Also, get documentation of everything that is promised! Don't rely on phone calls. Trust me, they will ignore your pleas for documentation and pressure you to take their phone calls. These will not protect you in case they don't keep their promises to you. Everything I write is from an ongoing experience right now. It is promised on their website that you... Read More can obtain this degree while keeping your full-time job. This is only true if you have a certain type of job. You will have more than one course of volunteer work. You will also have a semester long observation/practicum. They will not give you assistance or adequate time to prepare for this. I had the wrong type of job and was faced with the choice of quitting my job, my class, or getting fired by my boss for taking off to volunteer. In some cases you are only given one week to find volunteer work. If you withdraw because you will fail the class if you don't have a volunteer job by the deadline, you will owe the University money and have to take it over. This results in more student loan debt. Then you get more trapped because you can't withdraw from a class and transfer to another University because they will hold onto your transcript until you pay the money for the class you couldn't find volunteer work for. There is no consideration of how the pandemic has affected the search process for finding volunteer work. There is no consideration for how organizations teach. The class requirements are not flexible. You must teach according to their teaching strategies and not the volunteer organizations. Be sure and ask ahead of time how many classes require volunteer work. Unless you have the perfect job for this degree, you will need time to look for a place to volunteer. They don't give adequate notice to look. Also, you will not be given a letter from the University to attach to your resume of class volunteer requirements. This makes potential volunteer organizations upset. But the University will insist that you only give phone numbers of University staff in case they have questions. No one will give you documented answers to most of your questions. You will be forced to make phone calls for communication. Your emails will be passed on because the staff won't answer your questions because they don't know the answers. You will notice that your emails were passed on after and not before they tell you in most cases. So be sure and use the privacy option on your emails so they can't be passed on. It took me too long to find that feature. Organization of simple things such as links to necessary forms sometimes don't work and there was even a discussion forum of people trying to get the correct form for a few weeks once. The program is very poorly organized. Each class feels like you are studying the same thing over and over. After a few classes you are no longer learning anything new. You are just learning the same thing with a different textbook. Sometimes the same textbook is used more than once for classes. And it's to teach the same thing that was taught with that textbook in a previous class. While I would give the undergraduate psychology program five stars, I would give this one a zero. In the undergraduate program, they care about you and send you long e-mails of encouragement, prayers, and scripture. They will also follow up if you are struggling. They don't demand you call them. They also have a good academic program that is outstanding. This graduate program is the other extreme. If you do not fit their perfect stereotype of a model student for their program, you will pay dearly. Their perfect students won't have to put in the effort you do and will sail through without a struggle. In fact they laugh in zoom meetings how easy it is for them while other silently suffer. One member of staff made me call and promised he would help me anytime. I reached out through email and he replied that he trusted I would work it all out myself. Another woman on staff called me and promised to help. Instead, she is strangely silent. Unless they change this program, don't join without research and documentation. If they don't back anything up with documentation, run as fast as you can now! Don't get trapped! They won't help you and you will drown unless you learn how to swim on your own.\n\nRead Less\n\nI attended Colorado Christian University with big hopes (and promises) of learning from solid Christian leaders about how to lead people orientated organizations in Truth. While there was some good learning about leadership and real world applications of the bible today, the faculty of this school seems to hold their students to a much higher standard than they hold themselves. I was earnestly searching honest Christian mentorship, but at every turn it seems there was somebody standing in my way... Read More to discourage me. Maybe this was a test from God about how much I wanted it, but needless to say the leadership at this school was not very encouraging to my success. After promised help by the Career Services department, the head of the department all of a sudden called me a \"job-hopper\" and said he won't support that kind of behavior because he has a \"reputation to uphold.\" I'm 40 years old, of course I'm going to have a few jobs under my belt, besides, I thought the real Christian reputation was to help fellow believers, not to just look out for yourself? I had other negative experiences with faculty at this school, but that was one instance that really got to me. I showed this man nothing but respect and he turned his back on me without even knowing me. I was honestly praying for a positive career experience for me and my family, but I got the door shut and locked in my face by someone that just decided to discard me. That one really hurt and is still with me. Some of the online classes had positive instructors, but for the most part they are just following a preloaded class template, and do not dive deep like they think they do. Professor involvement in the online threads in very minimal, if at all, and there are pretty much no virtual classrooms or face time with professors. If the professor does decide to do a virtual \"check-in\", it will typically be when they are working and have down time, like on a Tuesday at noon (I never had the opportunity to attend one). There is a very odd dynamic here with a \"Liberal arts school\" and a \"Conservative-Good ole' Boy\" vibe. This school, (I believe unintentionally), gave me the permission I needed to question Christianity. By the way, the Student Handbook that they are so fond of, gives a list of accepted Bible translations that are accepted by the university. It's odd that the King James is not on that list, however one of the books that is recommend as a course material is a Leadership Bible that is KJV. It was very odd here, their use of the term \"Christian\" needs to be taken with a large grain of salt, but if you have an open mind, a good attitude, and can think and stand up for yourself, you will navigate their labyrinth of inconsistencies and be stronger for it.\n\nRead Less\n\nI came to CCU believing God was calling me there, because CCU recruitment was amazing. Now that I have spent time here I regret spending lots of money to come to a school where I am extremely unhappy. Going to class is a waste of time, because all the professors do is read off the power point and that's it, no extra information, I could do that from home and be done with the class in 2 weeks if all I had to do was memorize a power point. You're also limited to the amount of days you can miss a class... Read More and that number is like 2 (depending on the professor because some don't have a limit) but I should be allowed to miss a class if I need to without being punished by my grade, I also pay for that class who are they to tell me I can't miss a class because of personal reasons. CCU does not take into consideration that we have lives outside CCU and do not need to spend every second of the day on campus. They also won't take a sick note unless it's from the campus nurse (who every time I pass by her office is never there) which makes it difficult for those who live off campus. They also don't care about their student safety. These past couple of weeks there has been an unusual amount of snow and unexpected snow, so in the mornings the roads are not plowed yet or sanded. But CCU says you still have to show up, which for commuters is dangerous especially when some commuters live 30 mins away and there commute time doubles. I mean government buildings will shut down due to the weather but CCU won't. And one of the days it snowed the worst the state patrol told people to stay off the roads and that places should close because it was so bad. But no CCU just had to stay open. I mean they don't even plow the sidewalks and the parking lot for students until later when it's already starting to melt. The professors here will penalize you for not doing something their way or if you have a different opinion than them. The worst experience I had with a professor is when she told me my essay was plagiarized, when it was a definition from the Webster dictionary (that she told us to use) and I cited my definition properly, yet she wanted to fail me when I gave credit and did what she asked. The students here are judgmental too, I had a discussion in one of my classes, and EVERY ONE was saying how they refuse to be friends with anyone who isn't christian. Which to me seems like un-christian behavior. You also have to go to events because they are required for classes, how are you supposed to complete homework if you're required to go to late night events. The WiFi is terrible, I always get kicked off while I am working. There is NO diversity here, if you are a minority you will get judged, I've gotten looks from professors, students, faculty. And the only minorities you will see here are the cleaning staff (which is cliche and typical and it get's on my nerves) In fact speaking about the minority faculty the other day I saw a white staff member talking to one of them, with the security guard, and I heard her say loudly that she was uncomfortable and needed to leave and the staff member sarcastically said \"oh look we made her upset\" to the security guard. Which was a terrible thing to witness because she looked really upset. If you're a minority here you will feel excluded. I also am taking literally the exact same classes I took in high school, I took those classes so I didn't have to take them in college but now all I am getting is repeating classes. CCU had good academics but overall the real experience with professors and student life have been a let down. It's been such a let down that I hate waking up to go to CCU. I suggest you really do your research on CCU before attending.\n\nRead Less\n\nRecieving my Bachelor's from Colorado Christian University was one of the best decisions I ever made. Before attending CCU, I had been a student at two other universities (that I really didn't feel very connected to) under several different majors. When I finally decided to pursue my degree in Biblical Studies, my first choice was CCU due to their amazing attendance options (in-seat, online, hybrid, etc.), incredibly affordable tuition model, and really focused semester-block system. Everyone from... Read More my entrance councelor to my student advisor was wonderfully helpful and supportive in getting me registered, enrolled, and connected with student aid. Once I was in my degree program, I found an incredible community. All of my professors were knowledgable, caring, passionate people who truly knew their fields and focuses, and believed in pushing the students to go deeper. They were quick to respond to questions, eager to explain the material, and understanding when life circumstances made school more challenging to keep up with. The students were equally as kind and insightful, and the community between all of us was truly a wonderful experience. As a fully online student, I always felt connected to and part of the school; which is not a statement I could honestly make of any of the other institutions I attended. Once I had graduated, I found employment very quickly and have felt very comfortable in how my schooling prepared me to keep pace with those older and more experienced than me. I honestly never thought I'd be the type of person to gush over my alma mater, but CCU is a school that's honestly worthy of it.\n\nRead Less"
