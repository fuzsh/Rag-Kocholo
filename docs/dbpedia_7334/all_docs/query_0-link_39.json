        "text": "Academics\n\nWhat does it mean to be a Classical School?\n\nThe Classical Trivium describes the learning stages of children as they mature and focuses the educational method in each stage to best develop a knowledgeable, thinking, and articulate student. As its name implies, there are three stages represented in the Trivium: Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.\n\nWhat curriculum is used?\n\nWe do not use purchased curriculum but rather individual departments and teachers refine their courses of study (along with the Dean of Academics) to meet the needs of the students and adhere to the mission of our school. The classical philosophy of education is reflected in PRCAâ€™s curriculum with its focus on history, classic literature, timeless masterpieces of art and music, and math and science. All subjects are taught from a Biblical perspective so that students may understand that God is the King of everything, from science to music to history, and that His Word is the absolute source of truth.\n\nWhat are the class sizes at PRCA?\n\nK-5 classes are capped at 18 students. Middle school students have a maximum of 22 students per class and high school classrooms are limited to 24 students.\n\nHow is the admissions testing used?\n\nFor grades K-12, testing assures that potential students are at grade level. Math and Foreign Language classes are not organized by grade level, and testing determines placement.\n\nIs PRCA accredited?\n\nPRCA is accredited by ASCI (Association of Christian Schools International). Grades 6-12 are also accredited by Cognia.\n\nDoes PRCA offer Honors and AP classes?\n\nYes. High school students may select Honors and/or AP classes in the core curriculum, including English, Math, Science, History, and Foreign Language. Additionally, dual credit is offered for some classes through the University of Arizona and Colorado Christian University.\n\nWhat are the high school graduation requirements?\n\nThe requirements for each student is 4 years of English, Math, Social Science, and Bible, 3 years of Science, and 2 years of Foreign Language and Electives, including a semester of Fine Art. PRCA exceeds the Arizona Department of Education requirements.\n\nHow are teachers supported professionally?\n\nPRCA offers ongoing professional development for all staff. New teachers participate in a three-year induction program that includes over 75 hours of workshops and observations working together on best practices to implement our mission statement.\n\nProfessional Development opportunities are regularly offered to all teachers and staff in workshops that are taught by teachers for teachers to learn what happens across the curriculum in order to strengthen our interdisciplinary teaching approaches.\n\nStudent Life\n\nWhat is student life like?\n\nGrammar & South Campus students gather each morning for opening ceremonies. Upper Campus students hear morning announcements where pledges and memory verses are recited. Chapel is offered one day a week at each campus. Students, teachers and staff gather to worship, hear special guest speakers, and often have small group time. High school students participate in the House System. PRCA offers strong fine arts, including performing and visual art offerings. Many students gather to support their classmates at athletic events, concerts, and on the stage.\n\nWhat extracurricular activities are available?\n\nHigh school sports are offered through the Arizona Interscholastic Association, and athletes compete in the 3A South region. Middle school athletes participate in the TIAL league. Grammar School students have opportunities to play with classmates in sports leagues throughout the year. Various other clubs and organizations are offered for students. Expeditionary Learning offers trip opportunities for participatory learning.\n\nIs there a dress code; are there uniforms?\n\nWhile our Grammar and South campuses do not have specific uniform requirements, there is a dress code for each campus. Middle and high school students wear uniforms.\n\nWhere do students live/come from?\n\nOur students and their families live all over Pima County, with some from Pinal County."
