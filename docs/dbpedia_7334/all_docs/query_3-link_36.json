Both the men's and women's basketball teams make the NCAA Tournament in 2022, and men's basketball made it again in 2024—that's twice in three years! Our softball team has also spent the last decade dominating the Big South Conference!\n\nLongwood’s picturesque campus in the heart of Virginia is home to a thriving community of citizen leaders who take part in time-honored and unique traditions during their time on campus.\n\nPhoto Gallery: A Glimpse of Campus & Longwood Life"
