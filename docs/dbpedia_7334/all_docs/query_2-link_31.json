        "text": "Colorado Christian University This school can't even be bothered to interview prospective faculty via Zoom and instead interviews applicants using an automated program which records your responses on video and which someone presumably watches later. Incredibly awkward process that does not give one a positive impression of the school. Also, their online application system makes it virtually impossible to contact a real person at any point in the process if you have a question or even want to send a follow-up email. University of Iowa College of Education EXTREMELY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR FACULTY OF COLOR! Look at the HIGH turnover rates. I f you are a yeoman or token, feel free to apply. If you value your sanity and self-worth, RUN AWAY. Extremely TOXIC environment. Dean, Associate Deans, DEOs ALL contribute to the culture! if you speak up, you WILL BE targeted and retaliated against. Be ready to DOCUMENT EVERYTHING to protect yourself! You will be expected to do illegal and unethical things. Apply and accept a position at your own risk, you have been warned! Department of History extremely hostile environment for faculty of non-US citizens without family connection with US citizens. The faculty has been divided between women's studies camp and wisconsin camp for decades. If you have PhD from University of Wisconsin, Madison, you are easily hired and promoted for tenure with the minimum publication. If you got PhD from University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, you suffered miserably when a Wiscon camp faculty was the chair of the department. You were not welcomed if you got PhD from Princeton, because the one already there won't tolerate you. The faculties focus on politics and publishing, and they care the least about students. Graduate students were used to teach all the courses as cheap disposable labor. If you dared to say no, you'll be retaliated and destroyed by the faculties. One graduate student already committed suicide, and no evidence is found about him being retaliated to death. Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) Media and Communication\n\nA revolving door of faculty is always a leading indicator of an institution with poor values and administration. EUR’s media and communication department advertises for 5-6 positions every semester because so many faculty leave its horror show. There is only one interview with the senior administrators, and as long as you have a pulse and the minimum quals then you can get thrown into their serfdom. You will be a nonstop grading machine teaching the entire year across four quarters with no breaks. You will have no time for research, and even if you did then the library resources are pathetic with so few books and many notable journals unavailable. The inter-library loan system does not work either so if you want necessary texts then you will have to pay out of pocket. Faculty are crammed into small ugly offices with 8-9 faculty assigned to an office with only 4 chairs. You will end up sitting in the hallway on the floor. The whole campus is a modernist nightmare of toaster buildings with no charm or community. Department and school administration are utterly authoritarian as you will have no choice of classes or schedules. You just have to shut up and take it as they ram down your throat multiple classes and dozens of thesis supervisions. You are there to be a grade machine and take orders, and nothing more. Don’t you even dare to speak up a little or you will be cut down by the administrators. The administrators have an entirely colonial mentality and refuse to listen to any dissenting cultural opinions of how things are done in other parts of the world even though they ostensibly claim to be an international program. They are international in name only as the administrators and most faculty have absolutely zero international experience. Erasmus University Rotterdam’s media and communication department is an utter sham. The administrators are pig-headed, culturally myopic eurocentrists who believe their racial and cultural norms should be made universal to bring the entire planet to their heel.\n\nAcadia University Arts Faculty of Arts/Classics/Sociology, WHITE, CAUCASIAN, PATRIARCHY, HOMOPHOBIA, LESBIANISM AT THE EXTREME. The equity officer and dean of arts will punish you for bringing forward allegations about harassment and bullying ON MULTIPLE PROTECTED GROUNDS against M.D. (the homophobic and sexist chair from classics in sociology as they could not get a male from sociology to chair the department) by humiliating you to all of your workmates and subjecting you to a malicious work investigation. The dean's way of dealing with bullying is by prohibiting you from communicating with your departmental head and alienating you from your work colleagues. The union will say homophobia is not their problem, but the employers to deal with. Multiple instructors have left this institution traumatized, unable to ever return to work, if they did not take their own life from the overwhelming sense of powerlessness and humiliation. The students are great, but you have to be a male caucasian or heterosexual woman, who is okay with Heinrich Himmler (M.D. looks and talks exactly like that psychopath who orchestrated the murder of over 7 million people) hitting on you. The dean has less power than a departmental chair, just because she is female. Her looks (she wears a white minidress to a departmental meeting in -20c), heterosexuality and submissiveness are the primary reasons she got that position.\n\nMultiple complaints have been filed against Acadia with the Human Rights Commission for discrimination. If Acadia wants to get rid of you, they will \"forget\" to send you your accessibility students' documentation and then weaponize those students against you when you unknowingly fail to accommodate them. Accessibility students will fail your courses, as they are disposable to Acadia. Record all of your conversations with the union, administration and equity officer and be prepared to file a human rights complaint with the commission against the union (in terms of employment and the provision of a service) and employer (in terms of employment) within 12 months of the date of the last incident of discrimination. The union will only file grievances for male professors, even without PhDs; even a female professor with a PhD will have no assistance from AUFA. The union will claim not to file discrimination grievances, despite that being in the collective agreement and their duty and obligation under the human rights act, if the equity officer infringes your rights, by retaliating against you for bringing forward allegations against the almighty Himmler for harassment (M.D.). The equity officer is homophobic, just like the dean and union officers. They were all fully aware of the harassment based on the protected ground of my sexual orientation by M.D. (AKA Himmler), a homophobic psychopath, chairing the department of sociology from classics, who was determined to make my life miserable upon my divulging my sexual orientation in response to him making me feel uncomfortable and hitting on me. It is a great department, if you are a white male or heterosexual female. The students will impress you, if they want to, but the large majority are inadequately prepared for university.\n\nIt's the most unethical, unprogressive, and toxic place at which I had been employed. Within three days of divulging my sexual orientation, I was harassed and belittled non-stop, and subjected to adverse treatment and procedures from all the other heterosexual faculty. I was not even entitled to a safe work environment. M.D. (like Himmler) is a psychopath. Don't let him fool you. M.D. will destroy any lesbian who comes to that department, and you will have no union, Dean of Arts, or equity officer to help you. The latter two will be retaliating against you, as they act as if they would be intimately involved with Himmler or head over heals for that disgusting smelly little ignoramus. People without PhDs have more power and protection at Acadia. If you were a bully in secondary school, you will fit right in. If you have good course evaluations, you make the others look bad and Himmler will sabotage you and your courses. The equity officer looks like a porn star. Her arms are covered in ink and she has a tongue ring. She's corrupt and clueless about human rights law. She and the provost will subject you to a malicious investigation and threaten to discipline you in response to your allegations against Himmler rather than allow you to file a formal complaint, which are all violations of the human rights act. The dean and accessibility manager will modify accessibility students' tests to weed them out of Acadia. It's deeply disturbing. I suffered two seizures within one week, I have no history of epilepsy. The only explanation was extreme stress.\n\nMonash University Arts (-2019) This is a high-ranking R1 but it is a bullying/micro-management culture. Management is obsessed with surveillance of faculty and imposes increasing loads of self-reporting tasks. E.g. lose an hour explaining why you submitted your paper to a certain Q1 journal. If the committee disagrees with your logic, the paper doesn't count in metrics. It's been in decline for some time, but has never been worse than under the current Dean of Arts, who openly despises many disciplines in her remit (go figure). In her reign it has become a stridently anti-intellectual environment. Management favors Facebook likes over scholarly achievement. Promotion is a system of vassalage, with failed scholars elevated into positions of power in return for loyalty. Class sizes doubled, in some settings, in my time - FIFTY is considered viable minimum for a seminar class. The institution dreams of replacing all teaching with videos. Students know they are being conned. Faculty operate in a culture of fear. Many had enough in 2018 (if not before) when all electives were cancelled, removing any option from the major. The Dean sent an email to faculty alleging that students benefit from fewer choices. A basket case. I have never seen so many unhappy people. Miami University (Oxford, OH) All\n\nThe reason why this university is still referred to as a \"public ivy\" is beyond me. Honestly, even the president Greg Crawford's dog, ironically named \"ivy\", deserves this title a lot more.\n\nThe place attracts many garbage faculty with degrees from places you never heard of, yet still claims to be offering \"first-class liberal-arts education\". Your talent never gets valued here, because you are nothing but a teaching machine. The upper admins (particularly the current provost, Jason Osborne) do not care less about the well-being of the university employees, and will take every opportunity to make budgetary cuts while staying on a filthily high salary themselves. Since the ourbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the teaching load of most faculty has increased by 50%, and, guess what, the salary will be cut by 20%. You have got to be kidding me! How can anyone possibly commit to such a place as long as there's any marginally better option? Just look at the many houses for sale right now; the town is getting empty as faculty flee one by one.\n\nWith the huge budgetary issue aside, the place is overall poorly managed with extremely fucked-up hierarchy: PhD-level visiting faculty get paid like garbage (less than postdocs) and get disposed of like garbage too, no matter how hard you work and how well you perform; as if your life isn't miserable enough yet, you will be bossed around and bullied by colleagues with only a master's degree because he/she is a \"permanent faculty\".\n\nLook elsewhere if you have the option. This place is so overrated.\n\n---I agree with most, if not all, of the statements above. I also want to point out that this place has a very unfair dual-career policy. There is a crazy level of nepotism in the department I worked in; several teaching faculty only hold a master's degree (and not necessarily in the relevant field) but got the job ONLY because their husbands hold powerful positions in the department, and definitely not because they are competent themselves in any way. They have horrible teaching evaluations, but there's nothing that could be done; they are immune. It's a pretty nasty game of power. It's ironic that they insist on being called \"professor XXX\"; get a PhD first before you bluff, PLEASE! ---\n\n(2021) Alert to international applicants: Miami has a long history of mistreating foreign faculty. They do not accept STEM OPT and are likely unwilling to sponsor you an H1B visa. You might have to downgrade to a J-1 visiting visa if you want to work here. During 2020 COVID pandemic, a few foreign faculty were ruthlessly fired while on an employer-specific H1B visa and had to leave the country. They could have stayed on their STEM OPT and work elsewhere if it were not for Miami's OPT policy.\n\n(21 April) Finally Miami made it to this list. Recent searches in our department have almost all failed. Just google \"Miami University AAUP\" and you will easily see why... There is no shared governance of any sort. Shame on your so called love and honor.\n\n(2023) agree with all of this; like other institutions they also tenure faculty that have had sexual relationships with students and sexually harassed and assaulted students\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\nDepartment of English: Writing Division\n\nThis department is not a good place to work for non-tenure track faculty; over the years, tenure track faculty in English and History have become increasingly hostile towards non-tenure track faculty, especially towards writing faculty in particular. This culminated last year in tenure track faculty across the university voting to gut the writing program as a means of increasing precarity amongst non-tenure track faculty. The current situation is very bad if you do not have tenure here. In the next 1-2 years, 40% of the current writing faculty who are non-tenure track will be laid off. The department is currently running a search to determine which of the current 35 writing lecturers they want to retain, if any, and that will include outside candidates (i.e. forcing laid-off current faculty to train their replacements next year). When the proposals for a new general education program came out in 2017, they spoke of an \"ethical transition\" for non-tenure track faculty, by which they meant, laying off 40% of non-tenure laborers many of whom have families and have spent years devoting their time and effort to creating a strong writing program.\n\nWhat is more, tenure track faculty openly disrespect non-tenure track faculty and speak of firing them all at most departmental meetings. The general attitude seems to be that since employing non-tenure track faculty is unethical as such, all current non-tenure track faculty should be fired immediately. There is no solidarity and no advocacy or support. We have been called \"casual academics\" who have \"scholarly hobbies,\" for instance, just recently. Bullying is rampant. The department has invented rules and by-laws created to keep non-tenure track faculty from being able to advocate for voting rights, contracts that go beyond one year (all contracts are renewed yearly, but they have never offered more than a one year contract), and better pay. At the same time, the university itself has created a \"special faculty\" handbook that does the same at the university level - you cannot recieve grants, have almost no access to funding support, and will be judged solely on the basis of your student evaluations. The new job (currently posted, fall 2022 on the MLA), furthermore, will only involve first year writing, and has been set up as a means of further reducing the non-tenure track faculty over time. If you come here, you will likely have to reapply for your job at some point within a year or two and will be forced to compete against colleagues and friends.\n\nFrostburg State University\n\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n\nInvited for an on-campus interview in early 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began. I took every chance to decrease expenses associated with the interview. Despite having a positive experience interviewing, meeting faculty, and giving the teaching demonstration, the department called all of my references and then emailed me a day later to say that they had canceled the search--due to COVID-19--despite the glowing recommendations. Additionally, it has been hell to receive reimbursement for those pre-approved expenses, and Accounts Payable has used every opportunity to reimburse far less than previously indicated. Why waste my time and my references' time for a position that they weren't sure they would fill anyway, only to avoid reimbursement at all costs at the end of the day? The department was professional and accommodating; on the other hand, HR has been unprofessional and in need of a lesson on collegiality.\n\nJames Madison University (Virginia) College of Arts and Letters My significant other was offered a tenure-track job here and we enthusiastically moved. It has been four years and despite there being a \"dual-hiring program\", I have yet to find a full-time job (and this is not an isolated incident - unfortunately, I have met many trailing spouses who have been here even longer and have yet to find something full-time). Adjuncts in the College of Arts and Letters are paid $3500 for a three-credit course. This is half of what adjuncts at the University of Virginia (one hour away) earn per three-credit course. The students here are great, but this is a very insular, nepotistic, top down organization with little upward mobiliy unless you're a white guy. Even the women in positions of power seem to pretty much bow to the patriarchy. There is very little diversity on-campus and in town. The general mentality towards trailing academic spouses (which is the main reason I post in \"Universities to Fear\") is to max them out with part-time work and never offer any opportunity for upward mobility. My department has roughly 75 faculty, about 70% of whom are part-time, contingent, or non-tenure track. It's such a mess here. There are people in my department with inadequate credentials teaching all the courses for an entire program (which violates SACS accreditation standards). I had a successful academic career before we moved here. Now I have no idea what will happen, and I definitely do not trust JMU for the long-term (for a variety of reasons I don't want to share publicly). Also, the town is lousy. Don't waste your time, particularly if you're part of an academic couple.\n\nOklahoma State University, Stillwater\n\nDepartment of Languages and Literatures\n\n(2020) Faculty were welcoming and easy going during visit. Before visit campus visit schedule not sent until last minute. Only communication throughout was with staff person, no communication with Search Committee Chair (invite to campus interview sent by staff person). After campus visit, no communication at all (in spite of me sending multiple emails) and no reimbursement either. They may not be aware of the basic etiquette of searches.\n\nLingnan University Faculty of Arts [2020] The position is an inside hire. The department uses the title \"postdoctoral researcher/research assistant professor\" to hire its own PhD students. The departmental big guns have not produced anything scholarly in recent years and no surprise that Lingnan ranks the lowest in Hong Kong. Bishop's University Sociology\n\nThe department of three full time faculty members have no respect for their sessional and junior faculty. The one genuinely nice faculty member is currently on a leave. They expect you to just take their abuse and accept that is the way the world works. They put you down to make themselves feel better, particularly one senior faculty member. Since I cannot mention any names, I will call her \"fake nails,\" the fake \"nice\" personality goes well with the nails. You will be in for a shock, when she reveals her true character. If you have good publications, you will see it sooner rather than later. While publications will get you hired here, they will not get you friends in this department.\n\nThis was a really nice, supportive place when the faculty needed me to fix their program, but that all changed once I finished writing the course descriptions for their course catologues, course names, and assisted the faculty in updating their degree requirements. Once they think they have their hooks in you, the corrupt institutional behaviour begins. The university and APBU president don't know anything about employment and human rights legislation in Canada. Their overt violations of employment law in Canada is unbelievable.\n\nThe faculty gossip with students about their colleagues' teaching. If a student is angry with you, they will actually use statements made by other faculty you thought were your friends. Most of the faculty get rewarded for teaching nothing in their courses. It's perfectly acceptable to play videos in your classes all semester. Even after holding two sessional appointments, the faculty never let you into their circle. You always feel like an outsider in this department and unworthy to be there. The faculty hold yearly teaching evaluations with the dean and two students. You know nothing about this until the faculty appoint two students who hate you enough to actually slander you on the committee. When you try to defend yourself and even receive letters of support from students to prove those were slanderous comments, the faculty will treat you even more like an outsider and call you crazy. This is, by far, the most toxic department I have ever been a part of and the administration is utterly useless in helping you. You have to make friends with people in other departments to survive Bishop's. The people in sociology are fake and get off on bullying junior faculty and trying to make them feel horrible about themselves. The only conversations you have with faculty involve them disparaging a previous instructor who taught your courses. None of the faculty have any experience teaching methods, so they base this opinion entirely on what students say, although they take opinions from students with the lowest grade in your course.\n\nI feel so bad for the contract instructor who taught my courses. When she applied to teach the aging course in 2018, I was present when \"fake nails\" ridiculed her application. She made fun of her for talking about taking care of her elderly mother in her cover letter. This poor instructor has no idea how little the faculty of her. They make fun of her every chance they get. She teaches in the psychology and sports studies departments but has no idea that the sociology department will never hire her to teach a course again because of some rumours that probably are not even true. She teaches so many courses, there is no way there is any truth to what the faculty say about her. She's been casted out of the department of sociology clique. Once your casted out, your dead to the faculty.\n\nA yearly evaluation can easily turn into a reputation smearing campaign if the two students hate you. The faculty will not tell you which students they select to assess your teaching to the entire department and dean (apparently withholding this information is a requirement) nor ask for your input on which students to appoint.\n\nIf they are out to smear your reputation, they will appoint the least appropriate students to the committee: two students who were the least prepared for the most difficult course you teach, out of 12 classes, an upper level statistics course. Yes, the university deems it acceptable to appoint students who have only taken one course out of 12 with you, have no actual mentorship experience with you to be able to present in the meeting, were not adequately preparred for your course, and (one student had the lowest course grade). This is considered a fair and just practice at Bishop's University.\n\nYou have no support. The APBU is useless. If you are a victim of harassment and bullying, you are on your own and have to remain sane somehow.\n\nThey use you to fix their undergraduate program and are nice to you when they need something from you. After they get what they want from you, they humiliate you and then expect you to be happy because you were selected for the position. You are lucky, lucky, lucky. You are lucky if you can keep your sanity. The faculty also don't care about their good students who are quiet. They focus all of their attention on the loud, outgoing students, so much so those students think they have complete control over you as a junior faculty member. The students and the university are not bad. The sociology faculty are absolutely toxic. If you have more scholarly output than they do, they (particularly one senior faculty member) will use students to make herself feel superior to you, while the other faculty follow. (Hint: Fake nails, fake personality). My entire class told me about how terrified students are of this one particular person. No one speaks in her classes. When one student questioned what she was saying in front of the class, he was never able to return to her class again. The faculty are all two-faced. They will act nice to your face but look for anything to smear your reputation behind your back. The worst part is that you will hear about it from students appealing their final grades in your course.\n\nYou will be stuck teaching the largest courses (130 students), the required courses students hate. Apparently, none of the full-time faculty are competent in research methods or statistics.\n\nOther points: Eighty per cent of students plagiarize and instructors are stuck dealing with it. You can imagine how unmanageable this becomes in a class of 130 students.\n\nTheir retirement pension plan does not have enough money to support all the faculty currently retired, so you have to pay an additional 9% of your bi-weekly salary into their retirement pension plan (about 18% total). It keeps going up every year. Your salary will look amazing on the surface but expect about $20,000 in deductions for taxes and the retirement pension plan.\n\nThere is limited parking space. If you teach class after 9am, you will have to park all the way at the Sports Complex or spend 10-minutes waiting for someone to leave.\n\nThe university does not put any salt on the actual parking spots in their parking lots. Walking to your car in the winter is dangerous, plowed or not, and their winters are cold and long. They get an insane amount of snow. Don't come here if you are single. Sherbrooke is nice on the outside, but the majority of people living here are without a secondary school education, underemployed or on welfare, and many of the town folk don't speak English. Most of the people living in Sherbrooke are poor and in poverty. 4-litres of milk costs over $6.00 in Quebec. It is heart-breaking to see a father with his kids having to remove items from his basket, so he can purchase 1 litre of milk for his two children. I have given children cash at the grocery store, when their parent is not looking, to buy themselves something when I see how little their parent is able to purchase to feed two kids at a cheap store like Super C. The amount they charge for milk in Quebec is criminal. Most of the children here are living in low income homes, so you have to be okay with seeing kids and single parents that look like they would be living in a third world country.\n\nFurman University\n\nAll\n\nIf you still somehow naively believe that Furman is the right place for you to live your Dead Poets Society dream, my post may likely break your heart.\n\nLong story short, Furman is simply a family school intended for a bunch of privileged yet minimally talented white kids. You cannot afford to have standards; you do not need to be accomplished; all you have to do is to be white, have a degree from a random place, make sure all your students are happy, and hold strong beliefs in the eternal glory of the south.\n\nAcademic integrity is a joke here, and publishing with undergrads is simply a way to rebate students (their paying customers) their crazily expensive tuition with free rides, so these kids can finally have something to show in their otherwise blank resume. The students may not even be aware of the project, but they magically end up in the author list. PhD and postdoc work of any new faculty can also magically appear as Furman's highlight of \"publication with undergrads\". Of course this makes grant application so much easier, particularly in South Carolina where quality liberal-arts education basically does not exist.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on racism and diversity here. Just check a faculty page of any department. If you can find a black, a latino or an asian, you'd better head out and buy lottery now (foreign language departments might be exceptions since there's honestly not much choice). The limited number of minority faculty often suffer a lot from all the double standards they face on a daily basis. To cover up their pure whiteness, some departments even start putting black janitors on their faculty/staff page.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are not white, have no ties with the Carolinas, or simply don't want to see a confederate flag every day on your way home, but somehow got a job at Furman, RUN!\n\n[East Asian Studies] Feb 2020 - During my campus visit everyone in the dept was extremely welcoming and seemed quite happy with their work and the university in general. The dept is quite diverse and while wider issues with diversity and confronting the racist history of the university were obvious, everyone I talked to acknowledged them while also noting that things were moving in the right direction. Didn't have much interaction with the students, although the few I met seemed engaged. Research does seem to be not much of a focus, but this is a middle ranked liberal arts school that is focused on teaching, so not very surprising there. Sorry to hear the above poster has a bad time, but that was not my experience at all.\n\nWhile there were some good faculty, I had a pretty horrible experience a few years back. Mainly male search committee staring at my chest at dinner and then a faculty member casually mentioning that an administrator frequently \"flirted with\" (read: harassed) a junior faculty member. Odd place that needs some sort of diversity reckoning.\n\nHoly Family University (PA) Humanities\n\n(2019) This university is fundamentally dishonest and possibly unethical in the way they conduct searches. First of all, I was part of a fake search, which I didn't pick up on until afterwards. Happens to the best of us, I guess? But more significantly, they are NOT upfront about the fact that they don't have a tenure system. I discovered this on my own by doing research after I'd already been invited to my (fake search) campus interview. Instead of offering tenure, they give you a series of three-year contracts. At some point you get promoted to \"associate professor\" or something, but you still have zero job security. Which is probably related to the fact that the university is not on solid ground financially.\n\nCampus visit was rather strenuous, considering the fact that it was ceremonial (i.e. fake). Lengthy teaching demonstration was required. Taught someone else's 90-minute class the day before a major semester holiday. Glad to provide that professor with a \"bullshit day\" right before the break; less thrilled that I gave up a nonrefundable plane ticket for the pleasure of doing so. (The fact that the visit was held right before Major Holiday probably should have clued me into its fakeness, but what can I say, I remained stupidly optimistic throughout the process.)\n\nBut maybe that's not entirely my fault--the committee did throw me some mixed signals during the visit. I was given a tour of the building and told things like, \"This is where your office will be--see, we've set it aside just for you!\" And, \"This is where we all eat lunch together every day--we have such a strong sense of community. You'll fit right in!\" Found out through various contacts later that I was never a serious contender for the position.\n\nEven so, it took the department two months to send me a \"Dear Applicant\" rejection letter in the mail. Was not reimbursed for campus visit. (Would have been nice to get a personal thank-you from the professor whose 90-minute class I taught right before Major Semester Holiday. You're welcome, asshole.)\n\nBut maybe it was a blessing in disguise--Holy Family U. currently has a C- from Forbes in terms of its financial viability, and I can't imagine things will get better with coronavirus shut-downs. It's a very overpriced private school that looks and feels like a community college or tiny branch campus. Four or five buildings total; library isn't even open on weekends. The nicest building in the vicinity isn't even part of the university--it's a high school run by the same order of nuns.\n\nTl;dr: Holy Family doesn't reimburse for campus visits; doesn't have a tenure system; requires its fake candidates for its fake searches to teach 90-minute classes; and doesn't have the wherewithal or graciousness to keep its fake candidates apprised of fake search updates. I wonder what it's like to adjunct for these people.\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge (CSUN)\n\nEnglish\n\nThe CSUN English department does not value quality teaching or active scholarship. New hires are routinely told that their research will be supported. This is a lie. They are given an initially lightened teaching load, then after a year or two pressured into department-level, college-level, and university-level committee work on top of a 4-4 teaching schedule. When the 4-4 becomes too much, some of them are offered program administration positions in return for a reduction in teaching load. New hires rarely manage to maintain a research and publication program, and as a result, either those ambitions are abandoned, or the new hires leave. The last two people this department hired left for more supportive departments after less than two years.\n\nThis department will be hiring in 2019-2020. Let the candidate beware. The most active and credible scholars and writers in this department carry the heaviest teaching loads, while the lightest teaching loads are given to those who are favored by the administration, those who agree to join the ranks of the program administrators, and those whom the term \"deadwood\" fits neatly. Faculty meetings were an excruciating exercise in watching the deadwood squelch any and all ideas for change introduced by the more ambitious attendees. Do some digging. Find CVs, where you can. Find teaching evaluations, where you can. Ask, if you interview here, how much of a role your research will have in this department, and how much of a role the research, if any, of the search committee members plays in this department.\n\nAlso note that this department will have you do a \"teaching\" demonstration that amounts to little more than trying to run a class discussion with members of the search committee pretending to be students. I found it to be the most impossibly awkward experience, and it bore no resemblance to my eventual teaching conditions with actual students at the university.\n\nIf you apply here, be forewarned. The bright picture they paint for you does not resemble the grim reality you will find if you take the job.\n\n[8/21/2019] Not the person(s?) above, but can speak to the recent faculty losses. The campus’ students, and the department’s majors, are predominantly non-white, but the department's tenure-line faculty is overwhelmingly white, and the two who just left were among the very few faculty members of color the department had. Not a friendly environment for non-white students or faculty. There has been an ongoing pattern of reported incidents involving abusive behavior/language toward female students and students of color, involving several white faculty members.\n\n[8/24/2019] The faculty in this department has one or two good people who helped me and to whom I remain grateful, but as for the rest, it is mostly a refuge for sexist/racist underachievers and idiots and headcases. The fact that those people got PhDs is nothing less than an indictment of doctoral education. The one or two good people don't run things there, either. The idiots and headcases do.\n\n[8/25/2019] Academic grifters. How is it that a faculty that with rare exceptions does little or no research and publishing is supposed to teach us how to engage in research and publishing? Frauds. If you are looking for a job here, and you are a fraud, then you will fit right in. If not, look elsewhere. Unless you went through a PhD program in order to become a yes-woman who pushes paper rather than writes papers (or Goddess forbid, books), this is not the place for you. Any scholarly ambition you have will be crushed out of you.\n\n[8/30/2019] If you interview with the English department at CSUN, you might ask why the department has had so much trouble keeping new tenure-track professors, especially new professors of color. But better yet, run, do not walk, in the opposite direction. Leave this place's corpse to the buzzards circling overhead.\n\n[9/12/2019] Racism and sexism run rampant in that department. That's been an open secret for a long time. Practically every faculty member of color that place has ever had has gone running for the hills.\n\n[9/20/2019] This is an interesting portrait of the CSUN English department: http://textontrial.blogspot.com/2016/04/proposal-to-change-literature.html\n\n[9/20/2019] This is an interesting portrait of CSUN, and race relations there in general: \"The university is a plantation that is run by white overseers that are getting increasingly defensive about their illegitimacy.\" https://www.facebook.com/XicanoInstituteforTeachingandOrganizing/posts/258177357667080/\n\n[9/25/2019] Racism is simply out of control on that campus. If you are a person of color, and you take a job there, you are in for a very nasty time. https://citywatchla.com/index.php/los-angeles/15696-why-should-a-public-supported-ca-university-be-allowed-to-promote-racism\n\n[9/25/2019] But wait, there's a whole lot more:\n\nhttps://www.dailynews.com/2012/07/09/csun-professor-claims-racial-bias/\n\nhttps://www.laprogressive.com/racial-discrimination-at-california-state/\n\nhttps://www.einnews.com/pr_news/461212877/lawsuit-csun-discriminated-against-fired-communications-director-to-escape-public-image-problem\n\nhttps://caeducatorsunited.wordpress.com/correspondence-between-dr-gabriel-gutierrez-and-prez-harrison-re-his-resignation-on-cdi/\n\nhttps://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/california-state-university-northridge/student-life/diversity/chart-faculty-ethnic-diversity.html\n\nThis is getting a little bit over the top. This website isn't an investigative journalism website dedicated to one department of one university, with new addition every other day. Perhaps there is enough at it is now, so time to take a break?\n\nThe situation there is what is over the top, but thanks for the intervention in the authoritative voice of Whiteness. Which member of the current faculty or administration are you?\n\n[9/1/2019] I am a long-time member of the lecturer faculty, and I can say without any hesitation that this department should hang its head in abject shame at the way it treats its students and its faculty—especially its lecturers. Among the latter, almost no consideration whatsoever is given to expertise and experience when assigning courses--many are simply doled out to the favorites of the current Chair regardless of qualifications or lack thereof. (This new Chair is the first one that any of us can remember who has refused to meet with us to discuss our concerns.) This department rewards complacency and compliance. It is run via backroom deals made by a cabal of do-nothings and know-nothings. These arrant knaves cover their machinations with a thin pretense of democratic process that is abandoned whenever necessary to serve the interests of the tenured and talentless Baby-Boomers who have a stranglehold on everything in the department.\n\n[9/2/2019] I was on the tenure-track there. I left. My earlier comment was ill-considered and made out of frustration. But my current institution supports both my scholarship and my teaching. And that's all I really ever wanted. If you are there, best of luck to you.\n\n[9/13/2019] Same as above. It's just good to be in a more supportive environment now.\n\n[11/7/2019] I was also on the tenure-track there and left. Everything reported above is true. The department culture is toxic: many senior faculty are hostile to junior faculty who propose changes to any level of the department, dismissive of the lecturers whose grossly underpaid labor they rely on in order to entrench themselves in non-teaching service positions, and so forth. I would have serious reservations about encouraging any of my Ph.D. students to take a job there, even with the market as bad as it is.\n\n[12/10/2019] The students are noticing too: https://sundial.csun.edu/156057/opinions/the-english-department-a-relic-in-the-new-millennium/\n\nLycoming College Modern Language Studies (Spring 2019 phone interview) -- The search committee was rude and unprofessional. It was obvious that a particular candidate was favored and everyone else were warm bodies for HR. Aside from rushing the interview without having introduced themselves or having asked me about my background, etc., the search chair was rude and dismissive from the very beginning. None of them seemed to know who I was, i.e., name, institution, experience, nor did they seem to care. Moreover, there were equally snippy exchanges between the search committee members; one of the junior professors let it slip that they lied in the original announcement about both the teaching load and the opportunities for teaching upper-division courses. Santiago Canyon College Communication Studies April 2019--The search committee for the TT assistant professor/forensics position was the most unprofessional group of faculty I have ever encountered. When I accepted the interview invitation, I was told that there \"may\" be a behavioral component involved in the interview. But when I arrived at the appointed time/place, I was told that I had 30 minutes to prepare an 8-10 minute teaching demonstration on a specific topic AND an 8-10 minute forensics coaching demonstration using nothing but an informative speech manuscript. This \"test\" was clearly designed to favor candidates who were involved with the school already and wouldn't have been stressed out by the format. It made for an extremely stressful and embarrassing interview for me, and not to mention was a waste of my time. I'm sure they designed the interview to be compliant with legal requirements, but that doesn't make the format they used ethically justifiable. I would strongly urge anyone NOT to waste your time interviewing at this place unless you're adjuncting for them already. University of Colorado Boulder Engineering\n\nCU Boulder presents an aggressively corporate front in their job searches, which are run by HR “talent acquisition” staff. The job ad asked for a wealth of materials (much more than usual), including additional essays in addition to a teaching philosophy. After putting in more time than I have on any other application, I was selected to do a “digital interview” which was outsourced to a company called HireVue. This company uses AI to rank candidates on such things as word choice, facial expression, and “eye contact.” I can see how this technology can be useful for large corporations who field tens of thousands or millions of applications per year. But this is completely inappropriate for an academic job search. I felt that after putting in so much work on this application, Boulder couldn’t even be bothered to do a real online interview. I was nervous during the “interview” in ways that I absolutely am not during real human interactions. I am not used to making “eye contact” with a camera. I can see how, in large scale, this tech can overcome biases in hiring, but it can also introduce new biases. It was obvious that half of the questions came from the department and the other half were cliched HR BS (along the lines of “your greatest weakness,” “where do you see yourself in five years”), which felt amateurish and misplaced in an academic job search. I was also very disappointed that I never heard from a single person in the department conducting the search. All I ever received were HR form emails. Very disheartening experience.\n\nEmory & Henry College All During the spring of 2018, at least three people were hired to be tenure-track Assistant Professors in departments ranging from the natural sciences to the humanities. Four weeks after beginning their positions during the 2018-2019 academic year, these people were laid off effective the 2019-2020 academic year. A tenure-track job at this college is not an actual tenure-track job. University of Toronto Biology Members of the faculty were hostile and more than condescending during my interview. Asked if I had children. I was told by someone on the committee after the process that the committee used second hand gossip to help make final decision. In this case, it was about me (they heard from someone that I was going to get hired elsewhere - not at all truthful but that isn't the point and I remain without employment). University of Manitoba Biology Made the shortlist, went for an interview, interviewed for two days, went home, was asked by chair to submit all teaching materials. Never heard from them again. Not even after polite follow ups, including one to the Dean after six months' waiting. Winter 2018.\n\nArts - The dean's secretary was a mess and didn't send me any itinerary for my campus visit resulting in mega confusion. When I needed reimbursement, no response because she went on holiday. Don't expect anything to be done well the first time around. No idea where they hired this person given the astounding incompetence.\n\nIndiana State University History\n\nThey don't sponsor visas for foreigners. Meaning, the job is de facto closed to anyone but Americans. While I think this is discriminatory, this is not really the problem. The problem is, this was not stated in the job posting, and, worse, they only informed me I'm not eligable to apply after I submitted my application. Worse still, they condescendingly suggested I \"continue applying for openings on our website, jobs.indstate.edu, as there are positions in which we do provide visa sponsorship\" as though I was applying to a specialized faculty position just for the chance to move to Terre Haute, Indiana. Huge waste of time for me and reference letter writers.\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nEnglish\n\n(2019) I had a really enjoyable MLA interview in Chicago with 8-10 faculty members from the Department.\n\nUnfortunately, the search chair never contacted me again to provide details on the progress of the search. I never heard about campus visits, whether a candidate had been chosen, or anything else. I wrote a message in follow-up with email tracking; the chair never responded, but they did open my message five times in one day.\n\nI learned many months later from a departmental alum that this was a fake search and that the Department had hired the spouse of a faculty member they wanted to retain.\n\nIt's disappointing to see a fake search happening at the University of Chicago, which has a reputation for being one of the top two schools in the country for my field.\n\nA few suggestions for universities doing this kind of hiring practice:\n\n1) If it's a fake search (or even if it's a real search!), hold the interviews by videoconferencing. It's not reasonable or ethical to expect candidates to pay to attend an interview that has little/no possibility of resulting in their hire.\n\n2) Any candidate who makes it to the interview stage (and ideally all candidates for the position) should be kept abreast of updates in the search. It was disorienting to be dropped completely by the search committee after the interview. The fact that the chair opened my message so many times suggests that they didn't know what to say. A simple 'We have moved on to other candidates, but it was a pleasure to speak with you and thank you for your time' would have sufficed.\n\nKean University (?) All (?) Administration attacks faculty and very adversarial; President caught plagiarizing most off his CV; Majority of tenure applicants rejected. Etc etc. Google \"Kean university contraversies \" for more. SUNY Geneseo Spanish, Geography They hire people who have been there as VAPs but who have objectively worse CVs than the other external search candidates.\n\nGeneseo advertises itself as the \"honors college of the SUNY system\" to prospective hires and talks up its \"liberal arts\" culture. Beware of these claims. Class sizes are large for a liberal arts college, especially because there are no TAs. Quality of student is also falling, but student support services are severely lacking. As a result, morale is quite low among the faculty, and the lackluster and even disliked new president doesn't make things any better....\n\nHong Kong Baptist University College of International Education The hiring committee did a bait-and-switch with the job ad: they advertised for a Senior Lecturer. I applied for same, but just before the Skype interview (which was the only interview), they switched it to a Lecturer job, which pays a lot less. When I emailed to ask what happened to the Senior Lecturer job, their HR person replied with a vague \"that position is no longer available.\" They also offered the job very late in summer which caused a LOT of problems with my previous job. Working there entails teaching a six-course load, yes, that's right, a six course load.\n\nAlso, the director of the college was demoted to Lecturer after faculty complained that he was blackmailing the more outspoken faculty. He threatened them (in writing!) with low teaching evaluation scores if they did not resign. This was in the Hong Kong newspapers in the Spring of 2017.\n\nHong Kong University of Science and Technology Biology [Autum 2017 and earlier] Beware of research proposal fishing. Many openings for RA, post-doc and higher often require you to submit a research proposal. However, you would not hear them back. Instead, a week or so later, you would find a new postgrad opening with a theme VERY similar to what you've submitted. University of Wisconsin Platteville Criminal Justice There have been many problems with UW Platteville lately. Some of the problems are shown on http://UniversityCorruption.org/. This website contains an amazing story of corruption, cover-ups and retaliation. It all began with a sexual harassment complaint that the administration decided was too embarrassing to address properly. They instead decided to retaliate against a faculty member whose only sin was helping a female student properly report an incident of sexual harassment. Students are not safe and neither are faculty members who come to their aid. California State University San Bernardino English Position beginning Fall 2016 in English (Creative Writing) department. As per the 2016 Creative Writing Wiki: multiple complaints by multiple candidates of poor treatment during initial interviews and campus visits. First round interviews required the submission of course curricula for specific CSUSB courses without a clear statement for how intellectual property would be treated or preserved. The candidate who accepted the position was disparaged online by a member of the CSUSB system (including a statement *incorrectly* pointing out the candidate's ethnicity) as documented by IP address. Indiana Wesleyan University Music Spring 2016. Piano position.\n\nThe search committee was made up of four men and only one woman, a pianist. On the first day of the interview, at breakfast, it was only the candidate and the woman SC member. WIthin five minutes, the SC member asked the candidate if she had children. When the candidate replied that she did, the SC memebr went on to say that she could not conceive. Later that day, the candidate was asked again by a male SC member if she \"had family here.\" When the candidate replied that she was indeed married and had two kids, the committee member asked how old the kids were. The candidate was told many times how well she did, how her application \"rose to the top,\" etc.. Being that this was supposedly a \"Christian university,\" the candidate even turned down another job when she was offered that job two months before Indiana Wesleyan could finalize their search. The committee also knew that she turned down another job out of being \"ethical.\" The SC chair promised the candidate that he would let her know the result either way. Fast forward a few weeks later, the candidate saw that the job posting had been taken down from their website, so she emailed the chair to find out what was going on. The chair then informed her that \"after very careful consideration, the search committee decided not to consider (her) candidacy.\" Then, the candidate found out that they had hired a young man with MUCH LESS experience and achievements. Looking at the music department faculty list, it became clear that this department preferred hiring men over women. This was clearly a case of employment discrimination where the woman candidate with young children was not hired because of her gender and the fact that she had kids. The fact that the other pianist on the faculty couldn't conceive herself might just make her more hesitant to work with this candidate as well. But guess what?! You CANNOT sue this school because they had been sued before and they used that \"ministerial exception\" to argue that since they were a religious institution, their decisions were autonomous and candidates or employees were not protected under federal law! Basically, all in all, I would say that Indiana Wesleyan University is a hypocritical institution that uses their \"Christian identity\" to cover up whatever illegal decisions they may want to make in hiring and employment. RUN as fast as you can away from this school!\n\nAdrian College All Since 2005.\n\nThe Administration does not care about the faculty or the students. The President gets paid more than most Research 1 Presidents and never publishes (his \"book\" was ghost-written). Issues have included members of administration in black face for halloween, an official policy of \"no fat people\" on the website, faculty members having their book orders cancelled, a lowering of academic standards to allow more athletes into the College, and the President vetoing faculty votes on a whim. If your face does not fit you will not get tenure, all the LGBT faculty have to remain in the closet for fear of being fired, senior administration shout and bully junior faculty. There is no library budget, conference funding has been cut, and the roofs of the buildings are collapsing. The College is in debt and will likely be bankrupt within ten years. Run, run, run!\n\nRollins College Biology Position was to begin Fall 2016. Applied and was contacted for a phone interview. Cell phone crashed when search committee called, and I immediately emailed to let them know what was going on. Asked to reschedule later in the day. Got the phone working again later that day. Sent another email to follow up, and they wrote back that they had moved on because they were on a tight schedule. Would have been nice to have been given a fair shot, considering the phone malfunction was not my fault. Alamo Colleges: St. Philip's College Respiratory Care Technology Program [Fall 2015] The school posted the position in December of 2014, and I applied. I was first contacted in the spring of 2015 to arrange the first round of interviewing, a conference call with the respiratory therapy program director and a few other managers of other departments. After the call, I was told if I advance to the second round, I would be contacted within a few weeks. Nearly two months later in June I get a random, urgent email from the program director stating I did not send official transcripts and that I needed to get them sent ASAP. No one ever requested official transcripts during the initial application process, only an unofficial copy. According to the instructions the school posted, once an offer was given and accepted, then the candidate would need to submit official transcripts. So, I’m assuming I made it to the second round, and spent $65 overnighting the transcripts to the school. A few weeks later I get another email from the assistant to the campus president stating that I was to appear in person in less than a week for the second interview with the president and the rest of the committee. At the time, I was living in Los Angeles and could not drop everything and spend a small fortune on a round-trip ticket to Texas and other expenses on such short notice. The response I got was that the president agreed to conduct the interview over Skype. It’s now the middle of July and after a few initial technical problems on their end were resolved, we got through the Skype session.\n\nI found it odd and frustrating that the President harped on the fact that I received an A- in a previous doctoral course, a course that was part of my original major of higher education administration. I explained multiple times that after taking the course, I realized I no longer wanted to pursue that major, and changed to information systems. After what seemed to be the fifth time of her asking “…but why did you get an A- in that course?”, I could see the other committee members silently laughing behind her. Nonetheless, I finished the session and when she asked if I had any questions, I asked her how soon would it be before I hear about a decision, mainly because there was practically no time left to apply for a state medical practitioner license, one of the major requirements for the position. I could have opted to spend the $200 - $300 processing fee for the license well in advance, but did not want to gamble losing that much money in the event I did not get a job offer for that state. She stated she understood my concern, and would be in contact soon. By the beginning of August, no one had contacted me, despite the emails I sent. Two days before the job was to start, I finally got an email stating they chose a better qualified candidate. I have undergraduate degrees in biology, respiratory therapy, and computer science. I have a master’s degree in education, and am A.B.D. in information systems. I have worked over a decade as a clinician in multiple acute health care facilities, a few years as a software engineer, and eight years teaching in an advanced respiratory therapy program, but somehow I guess I was not qualified enough to teach in their respiratory therapy program… The entire experience interviewing with this school felt very haphazard and the president and her staff came across as unprofessional. I could never recommend anyone apply for any position at this school if these are the types of shenanigans and culture they have cultivated there.\n\nMass Bay Community College Engineering [Spring 2015] I responded to an add for a teaching position in EE at Mass Bay Community, around june 2015 i recieved a phone call from the departemnt chair asking me to schedual a skipe interview with the committee, i agreed. The interview took place for around one hour, they mentioned that the HR will let me know about their decsion withinn a week. Three weeks later I recieved a call from the college HR, but could not take the call, to my surpriese they did not leave a massage. I emailed the chair, she send me back an email saying this is to schedule another interview with the dean, please call HR to do that, I called HR, and scheduled a skype interview with dean.\n\nAt the time of the interview I waited, after 15 minutes the dean call from her skype account, we have about 15 minuets talk, she then said,we have other candidates, and HR will call you for a decsion within a week, this is two weeks from the starting of the fall semester. November 2015, they readvertise the position again. My cerdintials exceeds what they are asking for, including degrees from top 10 engineering school in the country, 9 years academic experience and 7 years industrail experience in the best conpanies in America. Now it is Decmeber 2015 and I am still waiting for the call, to say some thing about regarding candidates and professionalism at this college, plus other issues.\n\nBowling Green State University Engineering Technology [Spring 2015] I responeded to an add for a tenure track assistant professor in engineering technology. Recieved an email from the chair of the search committee, to schedual a phone interview, but the position now is a temp position for 9 months without the possibility of renew. I know there is some kind of a game, but I agreed to schedule a time for phone interview, the chair confirmed the date in an email. The time of interview came and I was waiting for some one to call but no call was made, I waited for more than an hour, but no call, no eamil nothing.\n\nThis type of schools have no regrad for people.\n\nBradley University World Languages & Cultures After a warm, welcoming, and positive experience at an on-campus interview, I did not hear anything from the department with which I interviewed for 2.5 months. Not a word. I found out that that they had hired someone for the position after going to their faculty page. I emailed them just to get some closure, and I recieved a response that said the position had been filled and that I would receive a letter from some adminstrator soon. I'm just so disappointed that after spending so much money out of my own pocket (it took them about 1.5 months to reimburse me, but I suppose it's a good thing that they did finally reimburse me) to go there, so much energy put into preparation, and so much hope after what I thought was a great interview, I did not hear anything until I finally confirmed for myself that the position had been filled by googling around a bit. California State University, Stanislaus Biology [Fall 2014] FIrst off, this is a commuter campus and is a major safety school in California. It is probably the least prestigioius of the Cal State system. That being said, it was a job interview and, like most of us, I was desperate for anything. The phone interview was fine but the on-campus interview shed light on a very disjointed department. There seemed to be a lot of infighting and general animosity. The search commitee was great, however. There was little to no research space but it was abundantly clear that research was a priority though there was almost zero funding for support and no startup. They also expect a 4x3 teaching load and labs count for 2/3 of a lecture. So, you're looking at 6 hours of lecture and nine hours of lab in a semester.\n\nWhen I finally heard back from the search committee, they said they voted to give me the position but the department voted no because the original job announcement wasn't worded exactly as they had hoped. The revised version was even more closely aligned with my background. The search committee all resigned in protest. Now they are re-running the search. I'm definitely not reapplying. The department was in shambles and they expect too much of their professors for pretty terrible pay.\n\nAbraham Baldwin Agricultural College All [December 2013] Run--do not walk--run screaming from any job offered at this institution. The president is a dictator and micro-manager. Deans and chairs kowtow to his every whim. He recently appointed two uncredentialled deans to ABAC's \"Stafford School of Business,\" a fancy name that means nothing more than a fancy building on campus. SACs will surely have something to say about this soon. Administration regularly bullies faculty, who all teach a heavy duty 5/5 course load and are required to publish, too. The Dean of my school lied to me about the kinds of course I'd be teaching when he/she hired me. Then, when I complained, basically told me, \"Too bad. Suck it up.\" For what it's worth, the faculty senate is useless.\n\nABAC has a \"Rural Studies\" degree that's really nothing more than an umbrella for several degrees, including a Writing BA and a Business BS. Do not be fooled by any advertisements. Students are nice but they're mostly hayseeds. Little opportunity for advancement at this school unless you're a local yokel who's in on the prevalent \"Good Old Boys\" network. Tifton's a nice enough town, but there's nothing to do. It's mainly an interestate stop-over of chain restaurants and convenience stores. ABAC is where PhDs go to become irrelevant. Do not apply for a job here. Run away as fast as you can.\n\nAnother bad experience with ABAC. They advertized for a position in my speciality, selected me for an on-campus interview, and then when I arrived informed me that I would be expected to teach in a completely different area. [posted Dec. 2013]\n\nArkansas Technical University English [Spring 2015 Interview]\n\nFirst night, the professor picked to have dinner with me spent the meal telling me that the Department Chair was a misogynist. I was shocked at her candidness, but it was a good warning about the lack of profesionalism and hostility in the Department. The next day, during an interview, the Chair asked me a (young, visibly queer woman) whether or not I could live in the South. I replied yes, I'd been living in the South for a while. He asked again \"No, I mean it. Can you live in the South?\" and then proceeded to tell me that his son sat in the same chair I was in ten years ago and told him that he never wanted to be in Arkansas again before moving to California. Nothing blatantly illegal, but definitely illegal implications. This atmosphere on top of a 4/4 load (with classes around 25-30 studies), colleagues that were visibly overworked, and no hope at all for a raise even after tenure (Chair said as much). Was grateful not to get an offer, but was surprised that I was sent a form rejection letter informing me I was not selected. Though should I have been? It required the least amount of effort.\n\nArizona State University Any non-white individuals / Any non-disabled individuals English faculty member confronted by campus police officer who demanded to see her papers, then threw her into his car. She's being charged with assault, even though the video shows the officer was the instigator of the assault. The university says they see \"no evidence of inappropriate actions\" by the officer. If they do this to high-visibility targets like a faculty member, one can only wonder at the level police brutality non-white students and staff are exposed to. [posted June 2014]\n\n[October 2014] Saying nothing of the fact that this type of incident can happen anywhere, I'm a black PhD student and haven't encountered any racism from campus police, faculty or other students. In general, I think ASU is a great place to be and it has so much cultural diversity (American Indians, East Indians, Europeans, Asians and Latinos and African-Americans. Just my two cents.\n\n[January 2015] On July 9, 2014, the faculty member mentioned above accepted a plea deal and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. By doing so, she was able to shed three other counts, including a felony count of aggravated assault. On August 1, 2014, she was sentenced to nine months of supervised probation. Most ASU and Tempe community members never saw this as a racial issue. The fact was that she was jaywalking when the police car approached her. A courteous response of, \"Oh, I wasn't aware. I'll get back on the sidewalk,\" was what she should have said. Instead, she launched a full-blown argument with a police officer. ASU police officers are full-fledged police, not security guards, and jaywalking is against the law, as the many people who have been ticketed for jaywalking in Tempe can attest. Her non-apology apology in court likely led to a more severe penalty by the judge. If she sincerely reckoned that she did in fact cause her consequences, perhaps the judge would have given her a lighter sentence.\n\n[January 2015] ASU does have a record of discriminating against faculty members with disabilities, especially those related to mental health. I experienced this, but I wasn't the first. My experiences mirror those of a tenured associate professor (like me) who exercised her rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act (like me) to take a medical leave of absence to recoup from an episode related to mental illness (like me) only to return to work labeled as lazy, uncaring for students or colleagues (e.g., the two faculty members who became instructor of record for my two courses -- and were paid quite handsomely for doing so [supplemental to their salary]), milking the system, and stripped of respect and support that supervisors should provide to all faculty. This faculty member was fired \"for cause\" because she plagiarized a syllabus. That was the worst dirt they could dig up against her, and the fact that ASU succeeded in court, twice, doesn't bode well for other employees who have a mental illness and \"have the nerve\" to go on FMLA medical leave. Like my predecessor, I requested reasonable accommodations under the 2008 Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act, and, like my predecessor, all requests -- and they truly were reasonable and obviously relevant to my disability -- were denied. ASU spent more than four months providing excuses, only to say no to all of my requests, even though there was no undue hardship. In the mean time, my performance, which was fine and certainly on par with my colleagues, was deemed inadequate. My courses that semester were taken from me with no advanced notice one week before the students' final exam, and I was put on paid leave of absence, even though ASU's policy manual states that this should happen only when the faculty member would be considered a threat to the university community, which I am not remotely. I received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, but the fact that my predecessor, who is now dead and spent the last of her savings striving to regain her faculty position and dignity, had such a challenge in court makes me question my own success in litigation, even though ASU administrators blatantly have violated numerous federal laws since my FMLA medical leave.\n\nAshford University All First of all, anyone who is considering a job with this company should realize that it is not a real school--it is a business. The faculty are treated no huneter than other employees and are \"at will\" employees which means that they can be fired at any time for any reason at all (or none at all). The \"school\" is owned by Bridgepoint Education which is only in this business of for-profit higher education for the money. This is demonstrated by the fact that Ashford has been replacing textbooks used in its \"classes\" with in-house texts produced by Bridgepoint. The full-time faculty are also forced to work long hours, teach online classes with large numbers of students who can barely write, attend numerous meetings to plan for other meetings, and serve on various useless \"committees\" that focus on making cosmetic changes in an attempt to gain accreditation from WASC (Ashford was denied accreditation last year) and keep accreditation from HLC in the meantime. Ashford is also obsessed with student retention because a lost student means a loss of profits. They all but encourage the faculty to \"kiss up\" to students and give out good grades simply so that they will receive good evaluation and be able to keep their jobs. There is no emphasis on research and faculty are kept so busy with administrative work and meetings that they don't have time to do any research. The only faculty who receive support for research are those in business and those who decide to break down and study online education. There is no support for research in other fields. In addition, the place is so disorganized that they ask faculty for their CVs every month. If you are a new graduate, then I suggest that you avoid this place if you are looking for something that is more long-term than an \"at-will\" job that has about as much stability as a greeter job at Walmart. If you are working at a real university or have tenure, you would have to be legally insane to leave a job like that to accept a job with this place. The degrees being handed out to students who have done little work while attending this school are basically devaluing higher education across the country.\n\nBy the way, you should also note that the Assistant Professor Online jobs that are posted for this place are actually for Chair positions. Yes, that is right--you will think that you are applying for an Assistant Professor position and--if you take the job--you will end up being the Chair of their programs. That is right--you would be both an Assistant Professor (with little experience) and the head of a program who has to mentor numerous online faculty. [Posted March 2013]\n\nEffective July 2, 2013, Ashford has laid off over 800 employees, including its entire Adjunct Teaching Assistant pool and the Writing Services Center staff. Associate Faculty (their term for adjunct faculty) in the English and Communications Department are now being limited to one class per 5-week term, as well as being saddled with the responsibilities of the Adjunct Teaching Assistant role. This reorganization appears to be financially motivated, and it does not appear that the large Associate Faculty pool will be given a pay raise to accomodate this added set of responsibilities. [Posted June 2013]\n\nChowan University All Only consider this university if you want to teach really bad students! Chowan University's mission is to accept the worse-than-average students who probably don't get into 99% of the other colleges they have applied to, and to \"give them a chance to succeed.\" However, most of the students don't want to do anything, and the Provost has his own pet-students that he would call into his office for \"friendly talks\" from time to time, so that he can get information to be used against faculty that he wants to fire. So if a student doesn't like you because he/she thinks your class is difficult, you can get into trouble just like that.\n\nThe Provost also tells some of the department chairs to \"get information about thei faculty members in case he needs to fire them.\" He has fired people before where the termination date is \"this afternoon,\" without the person doing anything obviously wrong! He won't tell the person why he's letting him/her go; he just tells them that \"we don't have to give you a reason.\" Also, this year they had a search where the Provost already chose the person he wanted to hire, before the search committee even met for the first time to look over all the applications. Basically, in all accounts, Chowan University is a joke! Not to mention that it is in the middle of nowhere - and they want you to live right there! There are faculty members who live further away in order to be closer to civilization, but generally the administration frowns upon that. They tell some new faculty that \"there is no place to rent in this town, so you should buy a house here,\" just so that they would have more liability and less mobility once they move here. Of course it doesn't mean that they will necessarily keep you. Some people have fallen into those lies before and bought a house right in town, only to find five other houses on sale in the same neighborhood that can't get sold for over a year! Buyer beware!\n\nAuburn University any Humanities This is where Humanities (any discipline) faculty go to wither on the vine and die. This College of Liberal Arts is tiny, and way behind the times, even when compared to other Us in the region. If you're in the Sciences, Engineering or Business fields then this would be a great place. If you're in Humanities though, just move on. Little opportunity, little culture, and geographically isolated. Unless you're a rock star who spends all of your free time travelling to do research/presentations/exhibitions (which will be next to impossible given the work load), don't ever plan on escaping. [posted May 2014] Baylor University Art & Art History I applied for a job at Baylor in the Department of Art in fall 2014. I was granted a phone interview and asked to prep for it by reading the university's mission statement. The first question I was asked in the phone interview was whether or not I was affiliated with any religion. When I told them I was not religious, they said that religious faith was a requirement of the interview and terminated the interview. Do not bother to apply to this school unless you subscribe to their very narrow worldview. I am sorry I wasted my time on prepping the application and interview.\n\n-This department is toxic and dysfunctional to the nth degree. I used to work here and observed one bully of a colleague make an number of discriminatory statements about applicants' accents, race, perceived race, and assumptions about applican'ts sexuality. Even though the university and its administration pays lip service to equity and diversity, they only penalize whistleblowers and empower the aggressor. Steer clear.\n\nBaylor University Sociology If you get an interview, be sure to ask them why they lost 5 people from the department in as many years. If the words \"health\" or \"choice\" come out of their mouths, they're lying to you. This place is a great place to go if you can tow the party line and are a white male, but you can forget it if you're a minority or a woman, and especially if you have any viewpoint beyond the very narrow ones of the crusty old white administration. The department itself has some nice people in it, but the administration is a nightmare and isn't going anywhere. It's a shame because the students have a lot of potential. (2015) Bethune-Cookman University English I should say, first of all, that the English faculty seemed very nice, professional, and put together. We had a great conversation over skype. But the administration should give one great pause. After skyping in December, I was emailed that the Dean would call me \"sometime the week of January 6.\" I actually did not get a phone call until the first week of February and this was the search chair setting up an appointment for a phone interview with the dean. I was then called a day earlier, because she mixed up the dates. Clearly, disorganized, which probably is not all that uncommon.\n\nWhen the appointed time arrived, I interviewed with the associate dean, because the \"dean was in another meeting.\" The associate dean spent the entire time trying to draw out a confession of faith. Now I am a Christian, but not the denomination associated with this school. Upon reading the mission statement on their website, my understanding was that Bethune-Cookman is a Historically Black University that happens to be loosely faith-based. This appears not to be the case. I applied to other similar instutions and did not get the same response. Unless you are United Methodist, and prepared to make a confession of faith during the interview process, reconsider applying here. [Posted 03/05/2014] This institution is corrupt to the core. They are censured by AAUP and have one of the lowest graduation rates in the country. There are always constant investigations and scandals. Moreover, the pay is extremely low and the administration constantly uses fear tactics to keep the faculty docile. You really notice it once you leave this place. As a result of extremely low morale, most of the faculty do not care about their jobs(they are coasting) leading to chaos in the classrooms. Attendance is not expected in the classroom. Thus, while a great teacher may try to require it, the culture created means those instructors will not succeed in getting students into the classroom. I never had a problem with this before teaching here or after teaching here. There are some great and humble students. These are the ones to cherish and provide any help as they will be really thankful. Nonetheless, this institution will probably collapse unless the government takes it over. Avoid at all costs. Only those with connections and who side with the top tier get any respect. 9/2015\n\nBelmont University Theatre [March 2013] Several issues mostly concerning Department/Search Committee Head's unprofessional behavior toward me (possibly sexist, but certainly personal), but issues also relate to the School of Performing Arts Dean and the university in general (since they allow the department head to behave so unethically). Generally speaking, I know this school would not have been a good fit for me because their Christian mission was not in line with my personal and professional temperament. However, their actions suggest deeper problems that would impact a new hire no matter what their personal affiliations may be.\n\nSkype interview: during ths the Dean was visably yawning while listening to my answers about my scholarship and teaching. The only time she perked up was to ask me to respond to the university's mission, which in addition to the standard stuff -- student centered, excellence in teaching -- included \"Christian\". Attempting to avoid a discussion of my beliefs, I responded to the first two adjectives and ignored religion. The Dean then perked up and interrogated me on how my beliefs impacted my teaching. I tried to stay true to my own basic beliefs -- that diversity is a good thing for the classroom -- and assumed that I would not be getting a call for a campus visit b/c I wasn't \"Christian\" enough. Invitation to campus: in inviting me to campus, the Department/Search Committee Head'asked me first to respond via email to the university's mission statement and reminded me of the importance of the school's Christian identity. I complied, but again, was clearly not a Bible-banger, so I thought the plans for a campus visit could be squashed. They were not. I debated going and decided it would be good experience and I should not judge the school before visiting. Planning campus visit: When the invitation to a campus interview was confirmed I was explicitly told that I would be making 2 presentations: a job talk and a teaching demo, but not given any detail of the length, content, or audience for these presentations. With a month to go before the interview, I waited for these details (which I asked for upon accepting the invitation for the interview) to be confirmed. When they confirmed my flight plans three weeks before the interview I mentioned that I was waiting on details of my presentations and they assured me that they would be in touch asap. Two weeks before the interview I politely requested to know what class I would be teaching, what parameters I should know about for my job talk, and the length of each presentation. A week before the interview I asked again. Both emails received no answer. I emailed again five days before the interview and got a response immediately asking me to wait just a bit longer. The details came 72 hours before my flight and they changed my iterinary from two presentations to one 30-minute teaching demo. So the work I had done on the job talk was a waste and I had less than 72 hours to prep for the class. Pissed, but I handled it. Another snafu in the planning stage: during the phone call to confirm travel plans they informed me that instead of having a day and a half with the search committee (including dinner the night before my presentations, etc) I would only have half a day on campus. This was ostensibly an unavoidable issue having to do with flight schedules, but it was clearly implied that my interview would be half the time they alloted for the other candidates. Also at this point much of my communication started to be with a woman whose position in the department was unclear. Some of this communication was via email from the Department/Search Committee Head' email account, but signed by this woman. I later found out that this person was not in fact a member of the department or even employed by the university but was the Department/Search Committee Head' \"girlfriend\" and \"just helping out\". Not to put too fine a point on it, but she apparently was given the authority to cut my interview time in half! Interview Part I: First meeting with search committee and Dean was breakfast and the Department/Search Committee Head is late. The rest of us begin a messy and disorganized interview and the Department/Search Committee Head' stumbles in, interrupting me, and begins talking with the other faculty members about some personal business -- as if we are not in the middle of an interview. I stand to try and introduce myself, since its my interview and everything, and he barely shakes my hand before continuing his private conversation at the other end of the table. That goes on for about fifteen minutes, all the while I am trying to figure out a way to politely enter a conversation I am clearly not welcome to, until he stands up to leave saying \"I forgot. I have a class to teach right now\". He goes without saying another word to me. I spend the next hour having a tour of campus with another member of the search committee. Interview Part II: The next time I see the Department/Search Committee Head' he takes me on a tour of the Theatre Bldg, which basically consist of him telling me what he has done during his tenure. He does not ask me one question about myself, my work, or my goals. He never refers to what I would be doing if I accepted a position in the department. At the end of the tour he takes me to a meeting with students, which goes very well, but does not include any members of the search committee. In fact the only non-student besides the Department/Search Committee Head' is the \"girlfriend\" who helped with my travel plans who is \"just curious to meet me\" so she sits in. Akwardness: At the end of this, Department/Search Committee Head and Girlfriend take me to the Dept office, ostensibly on route to my teaching demo, which is schedule to take place in less than 30 minutes and I am assured I will have \"plenty of time to set up and relax before my presentation\". But while we are in the office, Department/Search Committee Head gets caught up with some personal or department business (I am not informed about what he is doing when he turns his back to me to work on his computer). This goes on as if I was not even there with occassional interuptions from students, to whom he does not introduce me. Generally I feel as if I am in the one in the way as he takes his sweet time on his computer, chatting with students, and discussing personal issues with his Girlfiend all while I wait to be taken to a classroom to set up for my teaching demo. Finally, he realizes that we are late for my teaching demo! Interview Part III: We rush to my teaching demo, he fiddles with the computer, there's a lot of confusion, and worry about if my materials will work on their OS -- things that could have been resolved if I had been brought to the classroom five minutes before the students arrived so I could set up in peace. But, I do my thing as well as possible -- I do have a fair amount of experience and confidence in this arena and had already done two interviews before this one, so things could have gone worse. At the end of the teaching demo students and other faculty who sat in give me positive feedback, but Department/Search Committee Head' says nothing about my presentation. He tells me we are late for lunch and we start rushing across campus. Here's Where it Gets Really Crazy: on our walk across campus we are joined by -- you guessed it -- the Girlfiend. And by now I am used to them talking to each other as if I am not there, so they do and I walk a bit behind them. At this point I know I'm not taking this job anyway. Girlfriend excuses herself from lunch since encroaching on that would be unprofessional (?) and I endure another uncomfortable half-hour where I learn that Department/Search Committee Head has basically built the department without any supervision, that he has always been the Department Head and that he has personally recruited all of his current faculty. Hmmmm. Final meeting with Dean: meeting with the Dean I am again grilled about my religion, couched in concern for whether or not I will be a good fit at a school that is \"so student-centered, devoted to teaching excellence, and oh-by-the-way Christian.\" Search committee member interupts my meeting with the Dean to inform us that I am late to get to the airport. So my opportunity to talk about myself and my work is cut short. Aftermath: three months after my interview Belmont has not informed me about whether or not they would like to hire me; meanwhile I have accepted a position at another university. I have been in touch with the department about a hotel charge that appeared on my credit card, which to their credit they handled quickly. However, despite instructing me to send receipts for my incidental travel expenses (airport parking, etc), they have not reimbursed me for these petty expenses. I have emailed them three times and have been assured each time that they are being processed. I next will be contacting the Dean. I don't expect to get any money from them. RESPONSE: I need to respond to this to echo the original poster's experience. In fact, reading this I was absolutely flabbergasted because I could have written this about my own experience with this dept. I believe I may have been the only other outside interviewee for this job and we had the EXACT same experience. Dean actually looked to be asleep in my Skype interview. The Dept head was wholly unprofessional throughout my time on campus. Did not pay attention to my job talk. At lunch with other faculty members after my job talk he had personal conversations about issues I knew nothing about and al but turned his back on me to do so. It was so incredibly rude. And I should add everyone at the table but me was male. The dept head's girlfriend was present at almost all other times, which I found very disconserting, but at least she he some social graces. I considered writing the Dean to report what I felt was unconscionably poor treatment, but decided it would only make me look bad. Now that I read this I wish I had contacted them so they could know what an unprofessional dept they have. Thanks for offering this post.\n\nBlackburn College English (Spring 2019) The department itself seems lovely, though small -- you'd expect this of a tiny college. Negotiations, though, were a nightmare: upon the initial offer, I was told that there's zero room to move on salary and then was given four days (over a holiday weekend) to think about it, leaving no time for my partner and I to make travel plans for her to see the place. Two days after the offer, I emailed to ask for a) the MLA's two-week window of time; b) an insurance plan that would cover my fiancee until our wedding [two months after the semester begins]; and c) a phone call to discuss what options might exist for my eventual spouse to find a staff position at the college. A) was sort of met -- the window was extended from four days to eight; b) was outright denied; and c), instead of a phone call, it was suggested that she make an hour-long commute to the nearest city as they couldn't make up a position for her. We did some research into open positions, she applied to one, and then I pointed this out in an email seven days post-initial offer, saying that while I didn't expect them to create a position, one existed that's perfect for her and that finding her a job in this tiny town was my priority. The reply came that evening that a guarantee could not be made and that applications would not be reviewed for another three weeks; five hours later (at 11pm), the offer was rescinded. I had not replied in the interim.\n\nI can't say I'm surprised that they're having trouble filling this position.\n\n(Spring 2019) I was ghosted after the campus interview, still haven't been reimbursed for travel expenses. There was a strong indication that the college is in serious financial trouble. Whoever takes this job will be responsible for installing the fourth First Year Experience program in four years. From the above candidate's experience, I would imagine they're looking for someone desperate to railroad into a very bad position.\n\nBoise State University Social Science departments (in the College of Social Sciences and Public Affairs--SSPA) (Fall 2014) The College of Social Sciences and Public Affairs (SSPA) is being eliminated at the end of the 2014-15 academic year. It has been in operation for 29 years. The eight departments in the college will go to health sciences (socialwork), a new college of social policy (public policy, poli sci, crim justice) and the rest will go to Arts & Sciences (history, anthro, communication, sociology).\n\nWhile this change in itself is not so bad, the stress and politics accompanying this change--coming from the top, President Kustra and Provost Schimpf's offices--diminish the contributions of individual faculty. We don't recommend applying for or getting a new job in social sciences in the near future. It is a disaster during this transition. Replacements of good faculty leaving or contemplating leaving may not occur. The communication department in particular is having substantial curriculum and pedagogical problems that are more than personality differences, but which are substantive differences over quality and the curricular routes to it. One contingent has for years resisted a robust MA program while growing the undergrad programs. The media production faculty and the comm arts faculty are at odds over definitions of scholarship, now a decade+ rift encouraged by bad management and poor leadership, which produced a smorgasboard curriculum fragmenting the department and its students. That failure to provide a common curricular experience for all students has confused students as faculty splintered over such issues. This led to the administration placing the department into a receivership with a dean-appointed interim head for two years, to end with a new chair from a national search. Meanwhile, the department is developing new plans to keep the department whole in spite of efforts to split the department. Over time, the department must make itself into better interconnections internally and with the new home for the department in the College of Arts and Sciences. In transition with histories to learn from and put to bed, I wouldn't recommend Boise State at this point in time to anyone in terms of long-term employment until the department knows what it is. In the social sciences in particular, this is a university to fear.\n\nBoise State University College of Engineering\n\n[Fall 2017]\n\nBoise State College of Engineering has a history of toxic work culture with a clique at its center. This clique has been culvitated with a former Dean couple at its heart, which engages in malicious treatment of competent faculty who are not aligned with their petty interests.\n\nThere is a pattern of workplace discrimination against faculty of international origin and their exploitation through various mechanisms. These faculty are expected to carry the 'priviledged ones' on their back, allow them to steal in broad daylight, include them in their grants and papers, while the admins selectively highlight the achievements of these moochers.\n\nThe administrators are groomed and promoted from the absolute worst performers without any consideration for their academic record or integrity, mostly from the above mentioned clique. The heirarchy is largely based on race and not performance. There are informers in the departments who have been systematically cultivated to ensure that anyone speaking out against mismanagement and ineptitude in a democratic manner is targeted and their interests are hurt. Several departments have turned toxic due to these policies and have seen a high turnover of faculty and staff.\n\nInterviews and hiring decision have been based upon the clique's interests and several times these are fixed to hire from their own kind. Tenure, promotion and merit raise decisions have not been transparent and do not reflect academic reputation and productivity.\n\nUnless you have other options, it may be a decent place to start a career but further career progression is not dependent on academic/professional performance but on your racial profile and obsequiousness.\n\nBorough of Manhattan CC (CUNY) English [Spring 2014]\n\nTook over 7 weeks after my 2nd interview to get any information. If you feel it might be a long process, or if the process is taking a long time, please let candidates know. Please respond to their emails - a candidate sending an email 6 weeks after the 2nd interview is justified. A response is deserved. There might come a time when a candidate's employment is ending in a month or two, prompting the need for information and a new job search. Poor experience\n\nBorough of Manhattan CC (CUNY) Bowie State U Humanities Division First interview on Skype went pretty well and the faculty seemed kind and professional. I received an e-amail informing me the committee had reached a decission and that now it would be a provost decission. So I was offered a campus interview with her but no teaching demo or meeting with the committee was even mentioned. At the bottom of the email a note said \"the college would not be responsible for travel expenses but I was confirmed by the secretary that they would.\n\nI was not picked up or even taken to lunch. The Provost was outright rude and no meeting with the committee was scheduled. I met one of the professors in another department and had lunch together in the cafeteria (yes, the faculty are nice people). He told me his salary did not reach the 45K's (teaching 4 clases) which for Manhattan is really bellow poverty. Thankfully I was not offered the job and my travel expenses were partially reimbursed after an exchange of messages with the administration (they said the school would recognize only a $500 [a hotel in Manhattan can easilly cost that much]). Talking to a friend later on, he told me he had the same eexperience with them but he declined an invitation to interview there because the department who invited him would not pay the expenses and did not offer to pick him up (they should show a little decency; it's New York, not Nowhereville). Stay away from this school\n\nBristol University (UK) English Not sure about other departments, but don't bother applying for a job in the Dept. of English unless you have some very firm connection to Oxford or Cambridge, since they only hire people who have done degrees or postdocs at Oxbridge. I went for a campus visit and they made it fairly clear during the process and abundantly clear afterwards that the decision was a foregone conclusion. Needless to say, it is frustrating to waste your time travelling, delivering a job talk, and preparing for an interview only to realize you never had a chance. (December 2015) Broward College Social Science I made it to the phone interview stage. I fielded the call right before lunch, and it seemed that the entire committee was out to lunch during the call. They raced through the questions, showing no care or evidence of active listening during the call. Talking to dead air the entire time was awkward to say the least. When it cam"
