The rising popularity of online education has eliminated the doubts that come with being a distance learner. Numerous online schools offer high-quality instruction and award the same degrees offered by traditional colleges.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nDistance learning has been considered as one of the most popular ways of acquiring higher education, and Arizona appears to be one of the leading states in this aspect. Because of Arizona’s strong focus on high-quality online education, 360,835 students have enrolled in online programs of various Arizona colleges and universities in 2013, wherein most of these students reside out of state. Due to this, more academic institutions in Arizona have started offering online degree programs as well.\n\nIn developing our list of the 5 Top Online Schools in Arizona, OnlineSchoolsCenter.com took into account these factors:\n\nInstitutional excellence as demonstrated by considerable endowment size, healthy student-to-faculty ratio, and high student retention rates,\n\nHigh-quality online education that ensures rigorous coursework and robust curricula, so that distance learners acquire the same level of education that on-campus learners obtained,\n\nStudent satisfaction that students express through positive reviews and ratings of their online academic experiences.\n\nLearn about our ranking process.

Franke College of Business and the Graduate College. These departments present to NAU’s 30,000 students the extensive range of undergraduate programs, graduate programs, and professional certificate programs that the university offers. NAU is also the first public university to provide a competency-based online program.\n\nThe university’s freshman retention rate is 74%, and its graduation rate is 51.6%. As previously mentioned, NAU has two pathways of learning for online students, namely, the traditional online and competency-based programs. Traditional online programs are almost similar to brick-and-mortar bachelor’s degree programs with regards to the course and credit requirements. Traditional online bachelor’s degree alternatives include the university’s ten fields related to health professions, parks and recreation management, and hotel and restaurant management. The university also has an online doctorate program in nursing practice.\n\nCompetency-based programs enable students to obtain credits for numerous life experiences like related activities or hobbies and previous work experiences. Competency-based programs place greater emphasis on individualized learning.

As a result, several online academic institutions in Arizona have become widely available. Arizona is one of the participants of the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) that aims to enhance college students’ access to online education, including programs offered across state lines. The state is also one of the participants of the WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies (WCET), which promotes the incorporation of technology into higher education.\n\nDespite Arizona’s commitment to distance learning resources, tuition rates have gone up by 8.3% from 2010 to 2015 specifically in four-year public, academic institutions in the state. Arizona’s appropriation budget for higher education has decreased dramatically, and this has contributed to the issue of increased rates of post-secondary schools. Based on a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Arizona has higher tuition and lower state funding compared to other states since the 2008 recession.\n\nThis increase in tuition rates has been perceived as a warning for students who are investing in higher education. Nevertheless, those who have committed to distance learning programs through Arizona’s universities and colleges can provide a robust framework for the completion of their degree programs because of the state’s active incorporation of online resources and tools into higher education. Arizona continues to show commitment to making online education more technologically innovative and accessible, and this allows students to perceive that distance learning is worthy of one’s investment.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nOur 5 Best Value Online Schools in Arizona offer a variety of online degrees and program concentrations of very low tuition rates. The online schools also present various opportunities for online students to gain financial aid. Owing to their high-quality online education, these best value online schools provide a high net return of investment (ROI).\n\nUniversity of Arizona\n\nThe University of Arizona (U of A) in Tucson, Arizona has a relatively low net price and a high graduation rate, and it also has a 20-year net ROI of $388,000, which is considered one of the highest in Arizona. The online programs of the university enable students to interact with their peers using discussion boards for at least three to five times weekly. Before application, all students need to verify that the programs of the university are accessible in their state and also check the transfer credit policy to know which courses can be transferred. Tuition cost differs for every program. Aside from this, the active-duty military personnel usually pay a flat tuition rate per credit. Due to its various scholarship and financial aid options, the U of A is also considered as one of the top affordable academic institutions in the state.\n\nLocation: Tucson, Arizona\n\nAdmission Requirements:\n\nGPA: 3.0 or higher\n\nStandardized tests: SAT or ACT (recommended but not required)\n\nAccreditation: Higher Learning Commission\n\nArizona Christian University\n\nArizona Christian University (ACU), which was founded in 1960, is one of the top-rated academic institutions in Arizona. It has an acceptance rate of 57%, making it one of the most highly competent academic institutions in Arizona. Despite its Baptist roots, ACU officially became a non-denominational university in 2009. Since then, the university has expanded with its new programs and strategies to help students improve their knowledge and skills. ACU has three types of learning media, namely, an evening campus focusing on degree completion for working adults, an online learning system, and a 35-acre campus where traditional classes are conducted. The online program of the university was offered in 2017.\n\nThe university also features a 13:1 student-to-faculty ratio and a small enrollment number, which distinguishes ACU from traditional universities such as U of A and ASU. All students should graduate after taking a minor in Biblical Studies. Student events in the university also involve religion, ranging from mission trips outside the country to on-campus worship bands.\n\nIn terms of its online curriculum, the program enables students to begin anytime within the year. Classes are conducted online six times a year in eight-week terms. Some notable online undergraduate programs include Christian Ministries, Family Studies, Elementary or Secondary Education, and Business.\n\nLocation: Phoenix, Arizona\n\nAdmission Requirements:\n\nGPA: minimum of 2.0\n\nStandardized tests: SAT or ACT\n\nAccreditation: Higher Learning Commission\n\nArizona State University\n\nAside from being one of the largest academic institutions in the United States, Arizona State University (ASU) in Tempe, Arizona has one of the largest online education departments. Most of the courses are asynchronous in format while some programs need an on-campus component for online students to be able to interact personally with their instructors, professors, and peers. All ASU students are entitled to pay the in-state tuition, and this is the reason why ASU is also considered as one of the least expensive online academic institutions in the state. Scholarships and all sorts of financial aid are available for all students even for transfer students who have acquired above 24 college credits and those who have a minimum GPA of 2.5.\n\nLocation: Tempe, Arizona\n\nAdmission Requirements:\n\nGPA: 3.0 or higher\n\nStandardized tests: SAT or ACT\n\nAccreditation: Higher Learning Commission\n\nEmbry Riddle Aeronautical University\n\nThe Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona offers practical training in its various degree programs such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Space Physics, Applied Meteorology, and Aerospace Engineering.

The university’s online programs are also ideal for any lifestyle, allowing students to select between asynchronous and synchronous programs. Embry-Riddle does not have various admission requirements except for a perfect minimum GPA of 2.5 and transcripts.\n\nAdmission is highly competitive in Embry-Riddle since the school accepts transfer credits based on specific cases. Embry-Riddle also permits all online students to pay in-state tuition. Tuition is at a flat rate for active-duty personnel and military veterans while civilians pay higher flat-rate tuition compared to military personnel.\n\nLocation: Prescott, Arizona\n\nAdmission Requirements:\n\nGPA: 2.5 or higher\n\nStandardized tests: SAT or ACT recommended but not required\n\nAccreditation: Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)\n\nNorthern Arizona University\n\nNorthern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona has an ideal tuition rate for budget-conscious students and multiple campuses in the whole state. NAU is also devoted to research as students are more interested in sustainable solutions, climate change, and healthcare. This is the reason why numerous scholarship and financial aid opportunities are also open to NAU online students. NAU has also been known for its successful graduates and its 20-year net ROI of nearly $225,000. The per-credit-hour tuition of NAU is necessarily lesser compared to other degree programs in Arizona. Tuition rates are different based on the online pathway. As for competency-based online students, the school has established tuition packages into six-month subscriptions given unlimited coursework.\n\nLocation: Flagstaff, Arizona\n\nAdmission Requirements:\n\nGPA: 3.0 or higher\n\nStandardized Tests: SAT or ACT"
