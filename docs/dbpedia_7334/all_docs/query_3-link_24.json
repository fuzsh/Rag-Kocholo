        "text": "As a confessionally Reformed Christian college, we believe that God’s Word is the source of true wisdom and understanding.\n\nOur country is experiencing a crisis in higher education. Colleges and universities are graduating students who are morally, spiritually, educationally and politically adrift.\n\nHaving lost a biblical view of truth, a belief in the meaning of life, and a public philosophy to guide life together, our nation’s colleges have forgotten their true purpose—to education students in wisdom, character and virtue. Providence is different.\n\nRooted in the 16th Century Protestant Reformation tradition, we believe that God’s Word is inerrant and infallible, and that the Scriptures, as the ultimate authority, are the source of true wisdom and understanding and human flourishing.\n\nFrom God’s wisdom we are shaped, both individually and corporately, into people who understand the meaning of life, who love the true, the beautiful, and the good, and who are prepared for virtuous citizenry.\n\nIn our living and learning community, we seek God’s wisdom in every area of life—philosophy, history, politics, literature, science, economics, business, education and more—so that we are prepared for a life of service to God, our family, the church, and our nation.\n\nEvery day at Providence is a high adventure, and we invited you to be part of it.\n\nNo other college can match what you will experience at Providence.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 establishes the rights of students with regard to educational records. The act makes provision for inspection, review and amendment of educational records by the students and requires, in most instances, prior consent from the student for disclosure of such records to third parties. The consent must be in writing, signed and dated by the student. The act applies to all persons formerly and currently enrolled at an educational institution. Access to educational records does not give permission to make changes to the student’s record. For more information, visit:\n\nhttp://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html.\n\nThe College maintains two types of student education records: directory information and other student records. Directory information is considered public information and may be released by the College upon request, in accordance with existing law. Any student who does not wish directory information released must submit the appropriate documentation indicating such with the Registrar’s Office. Details about directory information may be found on the Registrar’s page of the Providence website.\n\nThe policy, found below, can be obtained through the Registrar’s Office or viewed in the Academic Handbook. Questions concerning the Act may be referred to the Office of the Registrar.\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) was designed to transfer parental “rights” to their “adult” children when they enroll in college and, therein, protect the privacy of education records and provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. Questions about FERPA should be referred to the Office of Registrar.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include:\n\n(1) The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access.\n\nA student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The College official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the College official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.\n\n(2) The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.\n\nA student who wishes to ask the College to amend a record should write the College official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.\n\nIf the College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.\n\n(3) The right to provide written consent before the College discloses personally identifiable information from the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.\n\nThe College discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using College employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.\n\nA school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the College.Upon request, the College also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.\n\n(4) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:\n\nFamily Policy Compliance Office\n\nU.S. Department of Education\n\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW\n\nWashington, DC 20202-5901\n\nProvidence designates the following categories of student information as public or “directory information.” The College reserves the right to disclose such information at its discretion, unless requested not to in writing by the student. Requests are to be filed with the Registrar’s Office prior to September 15 each year, or February 1 for students entering the College in the spring semester.\n\nName, address, telephone number, e-mail address, dates of attendance, class, photograph.\n\nPrevious institution(s) attended, major field of study, awards, scholarships, honors, degrees conferred (including dates).\n\nPast and present participation in officially recognized sports and activities, physical factors (height and weight of athletes), date and place of birth.\n\nHome and local/student church membership, including church denomination.\n\nProvidence Christian College intends to uphold both the letter and spirit of FERPA, while at the same time upholding Biblical relationships and responsibilities of the family. As general practice, the College does not inform parents and other students of disciplinary action taken toward students. However, the College encourages students to communicate openly and honestly with their parents about disciplinary matters. Even though students are legally and morally responsible for their conduct, the College also recognizes the concern of parents for the welfare of their children. Thus, the College reserves the right to notify parents under the following conditions:\n\nMedical treatment or psychiatric examination required to meet emergencies or to maintain one’s status as a student.\n\nMisconduct that is of such a nature that the student is in danger of suspension or expulsion.\n\nExtended absence or withdrawal from the College.\n\nOn behalf of the student-athletes, coaches, and athletic staff at Providence Christian College, I would like to personally invite you to join us on Monday, April 1st, 2024, as we host our 15th Annual Sea Beggar Scramble at South Hills Country Club! South Hills offers a superb golf experience with first class amenities that you don’t want to miss! All proceeds raised directly benefit the student-athlete experience at Providence Christian College and your support truly makes a difference. You will have the opportunity to directly interact with Providence students, coaches, and staff. Those interactions and your participation are truly one of the highlights of our year!\n\nHow can you help? The answer to this is rather simple, get involved. Whether you can make the tournament or not, we have many levels of sponsorship available to meet your desire to participate. You can sponsor your own group, or you can donate a sponsored group to student-athletes, pastors, staff, or a person of your choice. For those with businesses, vacation homes, season tickets, etc., you can donate an auction item that will be raffled or auctioned off at our post-tournament awards ceremony. And finally, for those who would like to only attend the post-golf banquet, there are tickets available for the dinner and award ceremony that will immediately follow our tournament.\n\nIf you are a golfer, you do not want to miss the opportunity to play South Hills Country Club. The picturesque setting will be exclusively ours for the entire day and our team is planning an unforgettable experience for you, our trusted friends, and partners.\n\nCORPORATE SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIf you do not have a total of four players, you can donate these slots to a Providence coach, student athlete, or a ministry of your choice.\n\nTransferring Credits\n\nOfficial transcripts from a regionally accredited institution are required for Providence to fully evaluate credits earned for possible transfer. In general, these policies apply:\n\nAcademic credit from regionally accredited institutions will be accepted IF final grades are a C or better.\n\nIn a sequence of inter-related courses, if the first course is passed with a grade below C a but the second grade is C or higher, both courses will be accepted.\n\nWhile credits may be accepted toward overall credit requirements, the extent to which transfer credits fulfill specific major or program requirements will depend on the courses taken and their applicability to PCC’s requirements.\n\nCourses may be transferred in to PCC in one or more of these ways:\n\nAs a course equal to a course at Providence (e.g., Introduction to College Writing = Composition I: Writing & Research)\n\nAs a Core requirement equivalent (not necessarily a course-to-course equivalent)\n\nAs an elective course\n\nCourses Receiving No Credit\n\nProvidence Christian College reserves the right to deny credit for courses that are not compatible with those offered in its undergraduate degree program. Some general categories of courses never receive transfer credit-or, in some instances, receive credit on a case-by-case basis. Examples of courses that receive no credit include:\n\nCourses in which a C- or lower was obtained.\n\nCourses considered below college level (usually numbered below 100).\n\nIntercollegiate athletic courses in any athletic sport.\n\nPhysical education activity courses after the max limit of 4 transferable has been reached.\n\nRepeated courses or courses with duplicate subject content.\n\nMathematics courses considered below college level, such as basic math and beginning and intermediate algebra.\n\nRemedial English (e.g., reading, vocabulary development, grammar, speed reading, or any courses that are preparatory to an institution’s first Freshman Composition course).\n\nNon-academic/vocational-technical courses.\n\nCourses providing instruction in English as a Second Language.\n\nRemedial courses in any academic discipline.\n\nCourses offered for non-credit and/or audited for no grade.\n\nCourses taken as a Pass/Fail, even if the course was Passed (P).\n\nCoursework earned at an institution that did not hold at least candidacy status with its regional accrediting association when the coursework was taken.\n\nBelow is more information about specific transfer credit policy for the college/university type you are transferring from.\n\nTransferring from a Community College\n\nYou can transfer a maximum of 64 credits from an accredited community college. Transfer credit will normally be awarded for work completed in accredited institutions within the last ten years.\n\nNOTE: High transcripts and SAT/ACT scores are required for students who have completed less than 2 years or 48 college credits.\n\nGrades do not transfer – only credits of credit. A student’s grade-point average is computed for graduation purposes only on work completed at Providence.\n\nThe number of credits does not change in the transfer. For example, if a course is 3 credits at the other school and the equivalent at Providence is 4, the course will transfer as 3 credits.\n\nIf the other school is on a quarter calendar instead of semester, the quarter credit hours will be converted to semester credits. Quarter credits are converted to semester credits by reducing the quarter credits by one-third. Such a reduction does not mean loss of credit.\n\nIMPORTANT: All students must complete their last year in residence and at least twelve (12) upper division hours in the concentration to graduate from Providence.\n\nTransfer courses must be 100-level or higher (or equivalent) and a course grade of C or better must be achieved to be considered for transfer; remedial and developmental courses do not transfer. Math courses must be college algebra or higher; pre-algebra and lower courses do not transfer. Courses may not transfer for several reasons: repeat of work already taken, low grades (“C-” or lower), technical or vocational courses, remedial courses, etc.\n\nSee ‘Courses Receiving No Credit’ below for courses that are not transferrable. Please contact us at registrar@providencecc.edu for additional questions about this policy.\n\nTransferring from a Christian College/University\n\nYou can transfer a maximum of 72 credits from an accredited Christian college/university Transfer credit will normally be awarded for work completed in accredited institutions within the last ten years.\n\nNOTE: High transcripts and SAT/ACT scores are required for students who have completed less than 2 years or 48 college credits.\n\nGrades do not transfer – only credits of credit.

Please contact us at registrar@providencecc.edu for additional questions about this policy.\n\nTransferring from a International College/University\n\nFor Providence to consider accepting transfer credits from foreign institutions, students MUST have their post-secondary academic transcripts evaluated by an official foreign-credential evaluation service. Students are responsible for the credential evaluation and translation fees. A list of credential-evaluation services can be found at www.edupass.org.\n\nPlease contact an admissions counselor admissions@providencecc.edu to gain further information about the steps required to apply and enroll at Providence.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 establishes the rights of students with regard to educational records.

Moreover, the West Coast had a significant number of students who would benefit from a specifically Reformed perspective in their college education.\n\nThose present were motivated by a deep appreciation for higher education from a specifically Reformed and Christian perspective. Some had been educated in such Christian colleges. Others had enrolled their children in Reformed colleges. All of those present were convinced of the need to express the reign of Christ in higher education. This group, composed of believers from various Reformed churches, was convinced that establishing and maintaining a college committed to biblical principles would greatly benefit the diverse community and the Reformed congregations in the Pacific region.\n\nThis body unanimously agreed to establish a quality, four-year liberal arts program that would reflect the lordship of Jesus Christ from a visibly Reformed, biblical perspective in all aspects of its life and learning. All programs would then be taught in accordance with the Bible, God’s infallible and inerrant Word, as it is interpreted by the Reformed Standards: The Belgic Confession, The Heidelberg Catechism, The Canons of Dort, The Westminster Confession of Faith, and The Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms. In addition, the group agreed that the college should be governed by a self-perpetuating board of trustees whose members would be drawn from various Reformed and Presbyterian churches; those who embrace the Word of God, the Reformed Standards, and the college’s purpose statement.\n\nAs planning for the new college began, it was clear how very important God’s providence was for this effort. We began with nothing except a shared vision for a Reformed college on the West coast, and a commitment for that college to be established and maintained for God’s glory. There were several needs: board members committed to the same vision, faculty, staff, and administrators solidly dedicated to the Scripture and the Reformed confessions, students desiring a quality Christ-centered education with a Reformed worldview, and the necessary funding and facilities. All of these needs had to be provided by our sovereign Lord. So, when it came time to name the college it was appropriate for us to give credit to the Lord’s providential care and especially recognize His gracious provision.\n\nProvidence Christian College was incorporated in the state of California on November 12, 2002, and the first Board of Directors meeting was held on January 18, 2003. The following January, Providence took full possession of a campus in Ontario, California, and began renovating its five main buildings into classrooms, dorms, a library, a dining hall, and administrative offices; the college was granted permission to operate as a degree-granting institution in the state of California on December 9, 2004 by the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE) with approval to offer 13 bachelor’s degree programs.\n\nIn the midst of this bustle, Providence inaugurated its first college president, Mr. Jim Den Ouden in June of 2004, and in September 2005 the college was privileged to welcome its first class of 22 students.\n\nImmediately following approval by the BPPVE, Providence Christian College began the process of seeking accreditation with the regional accrediting body, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The college was granted eligibility status in December 2005 and candidacy status in February 2009.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Providence community gathered to celebrate the first commencement in the college’s history. Two months later, Dr. J. Derek Halvorson joined the administration on July 1 as the college’s second president, following the retirement of Mr. Jim Den Ouden.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, the college’s board of directors voted unanimously to move the college to Pasadena, where it took up residence on the campus of William Carey International University. Classes were held on the campus for the first time in the Fall of 2010.\n\nThe college’s candidacy for WASC accreditation advanced to the final stage in February of 2011 and WASC scheduled a site visit on campus in 2012. Providence received initial WASC accreditation in 2013.\n\nOn April 1, 2014, Providence installed its third President, Dr. Jim Belcher. Dr. Belcher continued to serve as President until April 1, 2020.\n\nIn December 2018, Providence moved to the new current campus in the heart of Old Pasadena."
