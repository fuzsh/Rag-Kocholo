        "text": "During the early 1900s, the film industry had just gained popularity but the films during this era were drastically different from films today. Films during this time were done in white and black, were much shorter, and were without sound. In this silent film era, no star shined brighter than that of Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin is without a doubt the biggest name of film during this or possibly any era. In fact, Chaplin should be considered the greatest influence of the film industry in the 1920s because of his fame in silent film, his career as a director, his controversial satire, and the popularity of The Tramp.\n\nIn cinema’s early days, the film industry was based in New York, the nation’s theatrical center. Most movies were being filmed in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, and Florida. However, by the 1920’s, southern California had become the leading film capital due to its cheap land and labor. Films gained their popularity after Vaudeville actors striked in 1901. This left theaters scrambling for acts and films became the main event. Silent films were widely popular in the early 1920’s and were usually accompanied by live piano or organ music. Talking-pictures were first introduced in 1923, but did not become popular until 1927.\n\nHollywood has influenced American history since it began. It boosted and shaped the morale of a nation for almost a century. But Hollywood has not only been the influencing American society, it has been influenced by American society. In the 1920s, American society was booming; people were getting rich, spending and borrowing money, and they thought life was looking good. Then in October of 1929 the stock market crashed. Many people lost all they owned. People had invested all their money into the banks before the Crash. After the Crash, the banks had nothing. People were destitute. They had no money to pay for their houses, electrical bills, and food. It became the Great Depression. Likewise, Hollywood was impacted by the Great\n\nn today's world the majority of people rely on the mainstream media to get educated about the events happening all around the world. Getting the news out quick and accurate for people to read, has always been the problem for the people working in the media. At first newspapers was the popular way for spreading the news. Then the introduction to the television made newspaper news absolute, since news can be spreaded out rampant and across different platforms. In the 1920’s the very first media outlets to make a appearance were ABC, CBS, and NBC news. The original three broadcasted the news to the public, but from a liberal point of view. As it turns out, being focused on left ideas dominated the mainstream media even with the launch of CNN and MSNBC in 1990 which offered a greater\n\nThe development of 1920s and 1930s media and technology was extremely influential upon the period of time immediately after. Media in the 1920-30s and its relevance to the years that followed, focusing on the western world. Through the journalism and writing movements during the era, new technology was exposed to the public and impacted events in the years that followed. The term technology can also apply to machinery, medicine and weaponry; however, none of them corresponded with the changes to media in the 1920s and 1930s. The evolvement of media and technology in the 1920s and 1930s impacted events during the era and later in the Second World War.\n\nDuring the early 1900s motion pictures became popularized as an escapist entertainment medium that began transforming kinetoscope parlors, lecture halls, and storefronts into what became known as nickelodeons. Thanks to vaudevilles and their popularity, films were already known to have a vast audience and to be a new form of business with possible great success. These pioneer movie theaters had an affordable entry fee that expanded movie viewing to the middle class, not only increasing the popularity of motion pictures but also simultaneously increasing the demand of their production (Dirks). With nickelodeons golden age beginning in 1905 and lasting for about nine years they vastly modified the landscape of the American cinema by not\n\nThe rise of the film industry in Hollywood in the early 1900’s brought about much more than new media. It also brought about a sexual revolution for women. The Hollywood industry gave women not only a chance to have a high paying career but also a chance to be independent and embrace their sexuality. However, while film and television initially helped women to challenge stereotypes, it also enforced certain gender roles that quite possibly weakened the goals of feminists.\n\nToday I will be presenting on The Golden Age of Hollywood, focusing on the 1930’s. Now I’m sure most of you kind of have an idea what The Golden Age of Hollywood is. It’s actually a rather broad term that encompasses the end of the silent era to the late 1960’s. The 1930’s marked the inception of the sound and colour revolutions, resulting in the expansion of film genres such as gangster films, musicals, comedies, and animation/cartoon to name a few. The 1930’s was an incredible decade in classic Hollywood history, producing some of the best films that we have so much to learn from in terms of mise en scene, in terms of creativity, in terms of creating a film with PURPOSE, and that is of relevance to our community.\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood was a time when Hollywood hit its peak successfully and economically, starting with the late 1920s, and met its decline due to corruption in the late 1950s. One would ask the question: “Where did the name Hollywood come from?” The name came from Harvey Henderson Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, who were owners of a small ranch west of Los Angeles. According to u-s-history.com, “Daeida, who, while on a train trip east met a woman that described her country home in Ohio, that had been named for the Dutch settlement of Hollywood. Liking the name, Daeida christened their ranch 'Hollywood,' upon her return.” (History of Hollywood, California) Movies during this time period became a vital form of entertainment for all Americans during this time period. By the 1910s, Hollywood was combined into its neighboring city Los Angeles, and many motion-picture studios began to open. Moviemakers rushed to Hollywood, and competition started to become widespread between directors and producers. By 1910, the first motion picture was made in Hollywood, titled In Old California, and soon enough, Los Angeles became second to New York in producing films also because of it’s quintessential weather for movies to be made in all year long during this time. As Hollywood began to industrialize, filmmakers began to work on the image of a “star”; they would continuously use these highly-paid actors in order to achieve a form of comfort for the general audience of the movies. Seeing\n\nHollywood and the film industry has been impacting American culture and society for many decades now. Over these decades the film industry and society became entangled. The American people influence what types and how films are produced through their actions of going to the theaters. The industry reacts to the market created by the consumers but also comes up with new and creative ideas. These ideas and innovations are tested by those who see the film and how successful they are. One market that has ebbed and flowed through the times has been religious themed films. America is influenced by the role of religion, especially Christianity and Judaism. An important story from these religious groups is the exodus of the Israelites from the bondage of the Egyptians. The first major movie that Hollywood created to tell this story is the “Ten Commandments” produced in 1956 by Cecil de Mille starring Charlton Heston as the great leader Moses. Recently the film industry created the movie, “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” produced in 2014 by Ridley Scott with Christian Bale as Moses."
