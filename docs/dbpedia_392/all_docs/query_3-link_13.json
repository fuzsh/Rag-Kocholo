        "text": "TopBilled:\n\nTopBilled:\n\nWhen Jlewis first talked about this movie in a private message, I told him that I liked the sequel HERBIE RIDES AGAIN (1974) a bit better than the original. I suppose it has to do with Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes, two actresses I always enjoy watching. In his review below, Jlewis adds a post-script about the sequel.\n\nI first became familiar with THE LOVE BUG and its sequels when I was in elementary school. I hadn’t seen any of the movies at that point, but there was a monthly book order my third grade teacher oversaw. One month I used part of my allowance to purchase a book with a Volkswagen– number 53– on the cover. It was a retelling of the original story with pictures from the movie. That’s when I was first introduced to Herbie.\n\nRecently I tried to locate reviews by Pauline Kael and Rogert Ebert on the original 1968 film but they do not seem to exist. I was curious to read what they might have written. Perhaps Herbie and his automotive issues were too quaint or low-brow for Ms. Kael. Ebert did review the remake HERBIE: FULLY LOADED in 2005, and he admits to not having seen the original film or its three sequels.\n\nI found some user reviews on the IMDb. One person called the original film a live-action cartoon, whatever that means. Other reviewers on the IMDb mentioned how Herbie is a family friendly vehicle and he will win you over. It sounded like something a car salesman might say. I guess we all “bond” over the vehicles we use, some owners more than others. And people have been known to nickname their cars or trucks, the way Buddy Hackett’s character names Herbie. Though this may be taking the “relationship” a bit far.\n\nIf Herbie himself is a live action cartoon, it must mean he is a non-vegetative auto. He is a car with a unique brand of energy. He exhibits feelings and has a mind of his own. He is very animated. In HERBIE: FULLY LOADED, he is even more animated due to the newer filmmaking technology. He blinks his headlights, he pantomimes (don’t ask how), he droops his bumper when he’s melancholy and uses those doors of his as if they are wings.\n\nHow much intelligence does Herbie have? (I won’t ask about the audience’s intelligence or the audience’s willingness to suspend disbelief at some of the more outrageous stunts that occur.) If Herbie is intelligent, he is also sentient. Logically speaking, how would a car develop intellect and sentience? One has to wonder!\n\nIf he is a form of Artificial Intelligence, then Herbie is cinematic kin to HAL in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. And emotionally, he could be seen as the polar opposite of CHRISTINE, a set of wheels that had homicidal tendencies, thanks to Stephen King. Fortunately, because this is a Disney product, Herbie is not psychotic like Christine.\n\nIf a car like Herbie has brains and a heart, then he probably also has a soul. And by extension, he can use these qualities to fall in love. Okay, this is starting to get a bit philosophical now…\n\nIn addition to our main character, there are the humans in the story who basically play supporting roles. Often these actors are replaced in the long shots by stunt personnel.\n\nThe formula does not change from the original to the sequels to the remake. In each version we have a plucky car, a plucky hero (or heroine), a teeth-gnashing bad guy and a love story between the young leads, accompanied by a lot of racing footage.\n\nI find it interesting that the original 1968 version features a sequence where Herbie considers suicide, and in the 2005 version, he is nearly wrecked beyond repair in a junkyard. I guess Disney is telling us that he’s mortal, he has a lifespan. But if Disney can keep rebooting this story and keep it humming like a well-oiled machine, I don’t think Herbie will run out of gas anytime soon.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nTHE LOVE BUG was filmed between March and July of 1968, a rather interesting time period in both United States history and Hollywood entertainment. As star Michele Lee reported in an interview, a major scene that made the final cut (but I am not sure which one, off hand) was filmed on the very day that they all learned of Martin Luther King Junior’s murder. This brings up the rather ominous fact that hardly any live-action Disney films prior to this one (the one infamous exception being SONG OF THE SOUTH) showed much diversity in their casts in terms of racial skin tones.\n\nAlthough Walt Disney approved preliminary storyboard work just before his death in late 1966, there wasn’t much optimism that this comedy would fare any better than, say, BLACKBEARD’S GHOST.\n\nIn total surprise to both the studio and the industry, it triumphed over both Sam Peckinpah’s THE WILD BUNCH and Dennis Hopper’s EASY RIDER, which were filmed simultaneously during that same four to five month period and also put on the market in 1969. Yes, even though the latter film received more printed commentary than THE LOVE BUG, those Harley Davidson “Captain America” motorcycles still got out-driven by a clean-cut Dean Jones in a run-down Volkswagen Beetle. As two San Francisco teens confess in a drag race through the streets against Herbie the Love Bug: “Outta sight man! I would have never believed it!”…“Groovy, Pop, groovy!”\n\nOne would not expect an automobile to behave in a humanized fashion, despite cartoons that Disney made earlier like SUSIE THE LITTLE BLUE COUPE (with eyes added to the windshields to create a “face”), but this is a classic example of how creative entertainers can add a “soul” to just about anything mechanical, non-human and even non-animal.\n\nClassic scene: Herbie attempting suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge and Dean Jones’ Jim Douglas out to stop him. This is after his jealous rage over Jim expressing more love for a rival Lamborghini and banging the cr!p out of it. The whole set-up a.k.a. “No, Herbie, don’t!!!!” is wonderful with its murky fog prevailing much like the London imagery displayed in a key scene previous in MARY POPPINS, which the British-born Robert Stevenson also directed. It is not so much what the car itself does, but the clever editing and the atmosphere that reflects Herbie’s emotions and “state of mind.”\n\nThe human performers are all very appealing here even if they must play second fiddle to a set of four wheels. The top trio featured: straight-laced Dean Jones as race driver Jim Douglas, Michele Lee as Carole, the secretary of Thorndyke’s car sales who winds up as Jim’s love interest in the end, and the always wonderful Buddy Hackett (later a key voice in another Disney, THE LITTLE MERMAID) as Tennessee, the bumbling auto mechanic who had recently visited Tibet like the Beatles and “discovered my real self.”\n\nNaturally he is the one to first discover that Herbie has a human soul after “it” follows Jim home from the car dealers. Among the multiple minor character actors is the frequently cast Joe Flynn, who milks his usual side-kick role in the climactic car race sequences with Peter Thorndyke.\n\nAh, yes…Peter Thorndyke is our resident funny-villain. The British-born character actor David Tomlinson made three Disney features, two of them musicals that I fleetingly mention elsewhere in this review. Yet his greatest performance for the mouse house is certainly this straight-forward comic one. Watching a YouTube montage like “The Best of Peter Thorndyke” makes one wonder why he wasn’t nominated for an Oscar here. OK…maybe I should not go that far. I understand that a lot of the comedy here is slapdash slapstick with dialogue to match.\n\nMuch of the fun for me comes from Tomlinson’s little touches here and there in his Thrifty-shifty Thorndyke role. For example, when first meeting Jim, he is impressed enough to offer him sherry. Then he promptly pours it back in the bottle once Jim says he is only spending seventy five to eighty dollars.\n\nThe scenes with him infiltrating Tennessee’s garage are loaded with classic little moments: when Tennessee tells him that “the secret of the little car” is its “heart,” something our star villain obviously does not have, he hilariously states that he’s “certainly going to make a note of that” and then promptly tosses his pen in a cup! The lines between these two are quite surreal in an Abbott & Costello sort of way: Thorndyke: “What part of Ireland did you say your mother came from?” Tennessee: “Coney Ireland.”\n\nThe story is pretty basic. Jim is a down and out race car driver who hits pay dirt with Herbie, a car with a human personality, but there is a lot of doubt and skepticism on his part. Ultimately the feisty Thorndyke tries to sabotage his chances in a wild country road race, with Herbie even getting dissected along the way and literally “coming apart” just before he hits the finish line.\n\nDespite the overall simplicity in story, the comic lines are vastly superior to other sixties Disney “comedies.” It is also fun having a no-nonsense Garry Owens provide announcer commentary as all of the hijinks occur.\n\nI tend to view a lot of Disney films, both those made when Walt was alive and those made in the two decades following his passing, in two separate camps. There are those that are not very good, but have little things that hold my interest; a good example being the 1977 version of PETE’S DRAGON, a colossal mess that had me scratching my head in the theater as a preteen, but still manages one really great song that Helen Reddy handles, “Candle in the Water”. In contrast, THE LOVE BUG is an example of a generally very good film that still…somehow…disappoints in little spots here and there; its rather Mickey Mouse-ish style of music gets quite annoying after a while.\n\nClearly this movie was written by the over-30 crowd that was not quite comfortable with the changing times. Although Dean Jones is convincing in a secondary role as a hippy, delivering the memorable line of “We’re all prisoners, Chickie Baby. We are all locked in…,” his subsequent comment on our star characters being “a couple of weirdos” is intended to be taken as put-down self-criticism.\n\nBeing that the writers were still working in a pre-Stonewall era, there are also subtle homophobic digs tossed here for good measure: his middle-aged male companion is dubbed “Guinevere”, referencing both Vanessa Redgrave’s character in CAMELOT (released shortly prior) and the popular belief among the older generation that men who wear their hair long have a gender identification problem. (A popular road sign that went up across the country in 1968 read “Beautify America. Get a haircut.”)\n\nThis brings me to the way the Chinese American characters are portrayed here. To be fair, it is a vast improvement over BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S in which Mickey Rooney poses as “Chinese.”\n\nHere we have Bensin Fong playing Mr. Wu, who takes ownership of Herbie and backs our stars financially in their race. He and the others (Brian and Harold Fong receive no on screen credit) are actually Asian-Americans getting key screen roles at a time when Hollywood films were mostly devoid of them. (Note too that we see only a few African Americans as extras on screen, with just one speaking role by an un-credited Eddie Smith.) At first, there is limited stereotyping: one highlight involves Tennessee talking in Chinese and later learning that Wu is perfectly fluent in English once “money” is discussed.\n\nThe one key scene that will likely make many modern viewers squirm involves a “Chinese camp” in which an older fellow purposely behaves like an “oriental” Steppin Fetchit servicing Thorndyke’s car. His son translates in broken English that he “says hurry is waste [and] waste is cracked bowl never that know rice.” There is not anything specific here that is outright offensive but there’s an overall attitude that the creators of this movie view the Asian Americans as “others.”\n\nAgain, one must always accept films as time capsules of the way we were, both the positive and the negative.\n\nNote how cheap the gas prices were back then! Also the fashions with Michele Lee’s miniskirt and short cropped hairstyle is making a comeback in the 21st century. Note too how simple car racing was in the sixties compared to the modern corporate sponsored NASCAR era.\n\nPredictably the enormous success of this film spawned three sequels and a remake. It is rather curious that it took a full five years for the first of these to get made. HERBIE RIDES AGAIN was not nearly as good as the original (and neither were the others) but it does have special appeal for me personally as the first “all new” movie that I got to see in a movie theater.\n\nAnother curiosity about the Herbie franchise that I always found strange is that it generated far less merchandise than so many other Disney hits despite such a lovable central character. Although there were die-cast model replicas for the toy car trade and a trio of excellent View Master reels, there were not all that many chapter and coloring books out on the market in 1969 compared to the competition. It was not until 1974 that Herbie would grace the cover of one of Western Publishing’s Little Golden Books.\n\nNo doubt, this was due to the confusing state of the Disney company in those hypersensitive years shortly following the founder’s death. As long as brother Roy was still in charge, there was still some level of stability, but his death in December 1971, following the opening of Walt Disney World in Florida and the lackluster response to BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS, would provide a further blow…and push the company even further away from its big and small screen entertainment roots and more towards merchandising and theme parks, which were generally no more stable in revenue.\n\nThat special confidence that Walt gave the company took a long time to recover, having to wait until the era when Roy’s son and Michael Eisner took over. THE LOVE BUG was a colossal hit that could have impacted the company for the better, but was, instead, just a fluke phenomena that the company wasn’t sure how to milk properly.\n\nPostscript:\n\nI re-watched HERBIE RIDES AGAIN for either the third or fourth time. Not sure which. I first saw it in a movie theater at age six and absolutely adored it. Did not see it again for another dozen years or so, probably on TV or VHS in the eighties as a teenager. By then, I had seen enough of these types of slapstick car-crash affairs that it failed to impress me all that much. May have seen it again a decade after that but I am not sure. In any case, I decided to re-watch it again with a new set of eyes since TopBilled said he favored it over THE LOVE BUG.\n\nMy final analysis…OK. I still don’t like it as much as THE LOVE BUG but it is still a fun if, perhaps, uninspired Disney comedy. What is great about it are the stunts, far more ambitious than in the former.\n\nMy guess is that the budget was bigger and it shows in the production values. Although a product of the early seventies (filmed in ’73 and released ’74), the fashions are not too retro; everything Ken Berry and Stefanie Powers wear is pretty much up to date with today’s styles. Powers sports a hair style more representative of the Watergate Era, like Michele Lee’s was five to six years earlier.\n\nExcept for the occasional seventies look here and there, what I find most interesting is that the story and editing style, along with the special effects, resemble something made a decade earlier.\n\nAlso the gags: note the great soap bubble disaster echoing another film we reviewed, MOVE OVER, DARLING with Doris Day that was filmed in 1963. The scenes on the high rise were no different than countless comedies of yesteryear going back to 1923 and Harold Lloyd’s SAFETY LAST and, yes, the special effects with the matte work is pretty obvious (although still good for the early seventies).\n\nRobert Stevenson and Bill Walsh were previously more edgy, poking fun at the flower power movement in the earlier film, but are more hesitant about rocking the boat here. Like far too many films of this type, we get our usual romance between the leads that involve a wedding at the end.\n\nEven Helen Hayes’ Mrs. Steinmetz gets a love interest with John McIntire (remember him in PSYCHO?). Speaking of Hayes, I found her much “cuter” in earlier viewings than I did this time around. Yes, it is fun seeing Berry’s Willoughby constantly worrying about her while she just ignores all danger and acts uber-confident, but a little of her “cute” factor goes a long, long, long way with lil’ ol’ me here.\n\nKeenan Wynn’s greedy Alonzo Hawk is much more enjoyable on screen but even his character seemed a bit too uninspired for me as a villain, except in the memorable dream sequences with multiple Herbies attacking him. No Asian Americans but we do get Don Pedro Colley playing a high profile construction tycoon putting Hawk in his place, something you would NOT have seen in a Hollywood film made a decade or more earlier unless there was some social commentary attached.\n\nI do like both Barry and Powers as performers but also felt both characters were less fully developed than Dean Jones and Michele Lee’s characters in the previous film. She rather instantly takes a liking to him with virtually no hesitation, despite her talk with “grandma” about wanting to manage her own dating life without her help… and despite initially punching him in the face and later slapping him with a hot lobster. Wish he commented more on that humorous behavior when he decides to marry her, but that was just a one-off joke the writers soon forgot about.\n\nThere was also a lot more tension between Jones and Lee in their portrayals, with Herbie playing a key role in uniting them together. Herbie does nothing for these two, as if he is merely their shared pet dog. It was as if writers just needed “a” couple at the end of this and weren’t terribly concerned so much about how-we-get-there as long as we-get-there. No fault of the performers. Just the material they were given.\n\nI did miss Buddy Hackett and David Tomlinson. They put a lot of energy into their performances and helped make THE LOVE BUG a cut above so many other Disney live-action comedies. Still enjoy HERBIE RIDES AGAIN and do think the overall premise is a good one, even if Herbie himself was not all that relevant to an old lady’s house potentially being bulldozed for a high rise skyscraper."
