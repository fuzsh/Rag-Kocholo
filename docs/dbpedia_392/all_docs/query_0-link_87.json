Out of deference to Bela Lugosi, a Hungarian actor who will play the steam-heated sheik in the production, several members of the Hungarian delegation to the Interparliamentary Conference, in session here, will attend. They include, in spite of the obvious difficulties in setting them down, Dr. Lucas, Dr. Gratz and Dr. Sgterenyl.\n\n*\n\nVariety, October 28, 1925\n\n*\n\nBela Lugosi and Hortense Alden\n\nBela Lugosi and Hortense Alden\n\nBela Lugosi and Hortense Alden"
