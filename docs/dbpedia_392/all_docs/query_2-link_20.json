        "text": "Passing, Rebecca Hall’s directorial debut, opens with a sense of trepidation. The film’s protagonist, Irene, played by Tessa Thompson, enters a New York City hotel in the 1920s, hiding herself under her hat presumably because she doesn’t belong. The viewer recognizes Thompson, a Black actress, but because Passing was shot in black and white, it’s unclear how we’re meant to identify her character. As Irene runs into a childhood friend, Clare (played by Ruth Negga), who is passing as white, and meets Clare’s husband, John, who is white, the lines blur even further.\n\n“I wanted the audience to feel uncomfortable,” explains Hall, who wrote, produced, and directed the film based on Nella Larsen’s 1929 novel, which, set in Harlem, recounts the friendship between Irene and Clare, who, like many light-skinned Black people of the era, including Hall’s grandfather, “passed” as white to reach a more favorable station in life. “You’re more uncomfortable for sitting with your preconceived notions about Tessa and Ruth, who you know them to identify as Black in the world, to be culturally Black and racially Black.”\n\nHall adds, “It was very important for me to cast Black women in these roles, as opposed to casting white women who could pass, which is what previous movies about passing have done. Then, by filming in black and white, there are freedoms with tone and gray scale that you can use to make their appearance shift from one scene to another. For example, the scene in the hotel room at the beginning when John comes in is very deliberately overexposed. It’s oppressively white. The walls are white, the costumes are white, there’s a huge amount of light coming in from the window. That’s something I could do in black and white and couldn’t do in color. It’s only in an abstract space you can explore that.”\n\nThe film, out now on Netflix, was a massive challenge for Hall to get made, due in large part because she knew early on that the story would be best told in black and white, but financiers and studios didn’t agree. “I couldn’t imagine making it any other way,” the director explains. “Including the times when I was trying to get financing and people said to me, ‘We’ll green-light the movie if you make it in color.’ I just couldn’t do it. At first glance, it appears to everybody that I’m making a very literal choice — this is a black-and-white world, so the movie is in black and white. It’s not really that. It’s about messing with perception. If you turn reality from how we see it to abstraction, then there’s room to destabilize fixed ideas the audience has about the faces of these women.”\n\nHall’s determination to make Passing in black and white may be a specific artistic choice, but the film has arrived during a year when several other filmmakers have also decided to strip color away from their visual narratives, begging the question if we’re perhaps entering a new age of the silver screen.\n\nRuth Negga in Passing.\n\nPassing is one of several black-and-white films being released this fall, all of which are strong contenders for Oscars. Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast, out now, uses black and white to focus the emotion of the director’s semi-autobiographical tale of working-class life in Northern Ireland, while Mike Mills’ C’mon C’mon allows the simplicity of black and white to help his story of a man and his nephew shine. The Tragedy of Macbeth, from Joel Coen, reimagines the Shakespeare play in stylized monochrome. Wes Anderson’s latest, The French Dispatch, is partially told without color, and Aaron Sorkin’s upcoming film about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Being the Ricardos, has a similar blend of color and black and white. Even the Lady Gaga-starring House of Gucci inserts a brief black-and-white scene.\n\n“I think it’s a combination of audiences getting used to black and white, movies being successful in black and white in recent years, and filmmakers being given the option of telling their stories in a different way,” says Edu Grau, the cinematographer for Passing. “What is amazing is it’s all amazing filmmakers deciding to shoot in black and white this year, which also goes back to the fact that to do a black-and-white movie, there is a very specific direction and vision. It’s a very bold directorial choice. And that makes good movies.”\n\nBlack-and-white filmmaking in the modern era certainly isn’t a new trend for filmmakers — notable examples in the past two decades include The Artist, Roma, Mank, Nebraska, The Lighthouse, Cold War, and The 40-Year-Old Version. But why is 2021 specifically marked by so many films that embrace black and white?\n\n“I think most filmmakers are just dying to make black-and-white movies,” says Mills, who has considered making all of his prior films in black and white. “Everyone I talk to is. You come up on them. For me, it was Fellini, Godard, Truffaut, Wim Wenders — there are so many who are my heroes’ movies. I’ve watched so many black-and-white movies so often.”\n\nHowever, it was C’mon C’mon, in theaters November 19, that presented the director with the best opportunity to explore a stylized, monochrome cinematic world. “I’ve always considered how I could make any of the movies I’ve made in black and white,” he notes. “But [with] this one, the first images I saw were the kid figure and the adult figure walking through landscapes, and that was always in black and white for me. What my unconscious was saying is that this is kind of a fable; this child and this man going through life is almost an archetypal image. I was trying to underscore the fable-story quality of it. And the film is also very documentary in feel — it’s always very present, or trying to be. I liked those opposing qualities.”\n\nThe film, about a radio journalist named Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) who is tasked with taking care of his precocious nephew Jesse, may have been inspired by some of Mills’ favorite black-and-white films, but the director really wanted it to feel modern. For Mills, the use of black and white doesn’t necessarily mean something is vintage in feel.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Woody Norman in C’mon C’mon.\n\n“I tried to make it as contemporary as I could,” he explains. “It really is a crazy abstraction, because we never see the world like that as humans. For me, it created a space where I was really aware of the compositions, and everything in the frame became like a drawing and part of a story. I felt like it was German Expressionism sometimes.”\n\nHe adds, “A lot of people would say black and white is colder or less emotional. I totally disagree. I found intimacy in [using] black and white. I have so many scenes that are just this man and this kid, in bed or taking a bath, and it’s this space of intimacy. It’s this very simple, miniature intimacy, and I found black and white was really nice for that. I always tell myself it’s a drawing, not a painting, like an early David Hockney line drawing. There’s something very immediate and quick and unfussy and unfettered about a drawing that, to me, often has intimacy mixed with that immediacy. My movie, to me, has that, and the black-and-white space helps that. There’s more space for you to enter.”\n\nIn Belfast, Branagh and cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos similarly explored how black and white can help amplify the emotion of a scene. The story, about a young boy growing up in 1960s Belfast during the political tumult in Northern Ireland, felt best told without too much visual flourish. The pair, who have collaborated previously on several films, wanted to investigate a new way of focusing the viewer on what matters most.\n\n“It’s about the ability to guide the audience carefully to what we would like to see and what we would like them to feel,” Zambarloukos explains. “We’ve done that in many ways — in color, we do that just by removing set dressing or minimizing obstruction or simplifying movement in the actors or in quite symmetric framing. Avoiding distractions and guiding the audience to see or hear or feel something particular. The benefit of black and white, for me, is it has a certain lucidity in emotion. If there’s emotion there, it seems to be quite immersive and lucid for the audience, in a way where you might be distracted by color.”\n\nGrau saw that as an added benefit on Passing. “The primary choice was related to the narrative, but there is something about black and white that simplifies an image,” he notes. “You get rid of the color, you get rid of the separation, you get rid of the color contrast, and what is left is the essence of an image.”\n\nLike Hall and Mills, Branagh didn’t want to compromise on his vision for Belfast. He and his crew shot and finished the film on their own terms before the director sold it to Focus Features.\n\nIt’s about the ability to guide the audience carefully to what we would like to see and what we would like them to feel.\n\n“We finished the film as we wanted to, and then Ken showed it to some people, and they were thrilled with the black and white,” recalls Zambarloukos, who also shot the opening sequence of Branagh’s upcoming thriller Death on the Nile in black and white. “The response from Focus when they saw it was one of appreciation.”\n\nThe reality of the film industry is that while black and white may result in beautiful, uniquely wrought movies, it’s not a friendly format for foreign markets. Mills notes that many deals with foreign distributors are nullified if a movie isn’t in color, and that market testing often reveals a distaste from audiences. Still, he feels that a shift away from traditional theatrical distribution is a benefit to filmmakers who want to pursue their creative visions. Streaming services like Netflix, which saw great success with Roma and Mank, offer new avenues for films that don’t fit the blockbuster mold — as long as filmmakers are happy to initially accept smaller budgets.\n\n“The world has broken down,” Mills says. “A weird side benefit to this is normal distribution falling apart. The intrusion of TV and cable into film life. A lot of the old rules are breaking down. But there’s a price to pay. If I had made this exact film in color, I would have had a third more budget. It was straight-up said by everyone. When we were talking to people about making the movie, they would do one estimate for color and one for black and white.”\n\nDoes this surge of black-and-white films represent a turning tide in Hollywood? Maybe. But the reality is that each filmmaker had a specific, clear vision for their stories, which all happen to be best told without color. Passing, while it’s set in the 1920s, is a universal story that Hall and Grau hope resonates with audiences who live in the modern world. Black and white doesn’t have to feel old or nostalgic — the medium can tell stories in a way we relate to now.\n\n“At the end of the day, this movie is set in a period, and it was written a while ago, but it’s also very contemporary in what it’s talking about,” Grau says. “It’s also talking about Instagram and modern society, where we’re all passing for something. We’re different personas of how we are seen in the world and who we are in our homes. That difference of who we are and who we show the world we are is the essence of this movie. It’s the starting point of these stories. For us, it was very important to make a movie that wouldn’t be held in one period. We wanted a movie that was contemporary, that is eternal. It’s not new, but it doesn’t get old either.”\n\n“Ultimately, it’s about the perception of black and white as literal,” Hall adds. “We call black-and-white film black and white, but it’s not black and white — it’s a thousand shades of gray, just like all the themes of the film.”\n\nEmily Zemler is a freelance writer and journalist based in London.
