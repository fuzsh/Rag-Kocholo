        "text": "When you, a bright-eyed cinéaste, tell your friends you’ve got a great new film recommendation for them, the moment they find out it’s in black and white there is statistically a 93 per cent drop in the likelihood they will ever agree to watch it with you. On the other hand, there is a 273 per cent increase in the chances that a monochrome film will win an Oscar, in comparison to the same film in colour.\n\nBoth of those figures are entirely made up, but would anyone be surprised if they turned out to be at least roughly true? Black and white films have long been associated with artistic filmmaking, high-concept auteurism and, obviously, Golden Age Hollywood tradition, and this week, Best Picture winner and critical catnip Parasite is being inducted into that tradition with its own monochrome theatrical rerelease. With that, it joins a recent micro-trend of black and white rereleases, itself part of a larger and longstanding practice by which studios find various ways to reissue and rerelease films with minor – and occasionally major – artistic changes.\n\nBlack and white adaptations in particular have become slightly more common in the last few years, with Mad Max: Fury Road’s “Black & Chrome Edition” released a year or so after the original colour film came out in 2015. Director George Miller himself revealed that he initially wanted to shoot the film in black and white anyway, telling a Q&A audience, “The best version of this movie is black and white, but people reserve that for art movies now.”\n\nThen, in 2017, the world was treated to Logan Noir, a moody black and white rerelease of James Mangold’s critically acclaimed take on Wolverine. Unlike Miller, Mangold hedged a little as to whether the film was “supposed” to be seen in black and white, describing it as a film shot for colour, but with “an awareness” that it would look good in black and white. Fans were unbothered by this; they turned out in droves for the film’s second theatrical run. Cult American cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse even enforced a strict black and white dress code for Logan Noir’s opening night.\n\nWhat these three films have in common is that they’re all accessible, unpretentious and consciously “pop cultural” creations that managed to catapult themselves over the fence and into the “art” category. Mad Max and Parasite were both acclaimed by critics and their monochrome rereleases were both announced after winning six and four Academy Awards respectively. Logan, unusually for a superhero film, was also Oscar-nominated and widely lauded. Tom Grater, an international film reporter at industry website Deadline, points out that critical acclaim itself earns directors the right to rejig their films once they’ve won the benefit of the doubt with audiences. “I think [Mad Max] was kind of a passion project of George Miller,” says Grater. “When a film is hugely financially successful, the director has the opportunity to revisit it and they just have a bit more license to do something interesting with it. And the fans were calling for it, so that made sense.”\n\nEven then, it’s worth noting that Mad Mad: Fury Road – Black & Chrome didn’t make it to cinemas and was only issued on the DVD release and video-on-demand platforms. (Park Chan-wook’s ultra-violent 2005 thriller Lady Vengeance had a special DVD version that gradually leeched colour over the course of the film, beginning as normal but fading to total black and white by the end, though it’s unclear whether this came out widely in cinemas either. What is clear is that’s a damn cool gimmick.) We associate black and white, rightly or wrongly, with artistic quality and integrity – we think of monochrome movies as “thinking” films rather than straight blockbusters. Schindler’s List, Roma, Ida and The Artist all won multiple Oscars. “If you were being cynical,” says Grater, “you could say that a black and white version of a movie is a pretty easy way to lend it the veneer of artistic credibility.” Bong Joon-ho, Parasite’s director, confirmed the appeal in January, telling the International Film Festival in Rotterdam: “I think it may be vanity on my part, but when I think of the classics, they're all in black and white. So I had this idea that if I turned my films into black and white then they'd become classics.”\n\nThe financial rerelease/repackage is an almost ancient practice, at least by Hollywood standards. In 2011, Smithsonian magazine recounted how, “In 1918, while the country was still in the grips of a deadly flu epidemic, William Fox [founder of 20th Century Fox] began reissuing films from as early as 1915. He continued the practice in 1919 and 1920, this time giving his old films new titles. 1916′s The Love Thief became 1920′s The She Tiger. (A few years later, the New York State Superior Court ruled the practice illegal.)” Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, sound versions – talkies – of silent films were regularly put out. Disney from the 1930s through to the 1950s had an informal “seven-year rule” by which the same films would be rereleased every seven years to take advantage of younger audiences who – obviously – didn’t yet have televisions on which to see old films.\n\nThe advent of television and then, later, VHS releases, DVDs and online streaming meant that this tactic became less feasible, as audiences had other means through which they could revisit old films at will. But, says Grater, changing the actual content of a film by including new or amended footage, rather than merely changing its colour or aesthetic, is still a great way to justify squeezing extra ticket sales out of super fans. In 2019, Avengers: Endgame was rereleased barely two months after its premiere, with six added minutes of footage, all to try to break the all-time box-office record then held by Avatar (which it duly did). “Disney were absolutely determined to get that box office record,” says Grater, “and they let they let that film run in cinemas longer than would be normal because they needed it to tick over. [To] justify it being on the cinema screen, they needed to do something [extra].” Spider-Man: Far From Home, which takes place in the same cinematic universe as Endgame, came out on the same day as the Endgame rerelease began and it, too, had a two-month added-footage extension, this time with the excuse of a tiny four minutes of added footage, but really, uh, because Tom Holland is endlessly marketable.\n\nEven Avatar itself got its owns special-edition theatrical revamp with nine extra minutes added in, eight months after its first release; much of that extended the tsaheylu sequence, which you will remember better as that weird tree sex scene. James Cameron claimed each extra minute cost $1 million to produce, which… seems like an entire waste of money, but the “Sexy Na’vi Edition” (our name for it, not theirs) did bring in an extra $30m or so at the box office, apparently. Each to their own.\n\nAvatar and the Marvel franchise’s successes with rereleases highlight another aspect of what makes for a successful second theatrical run: in short, a dedicated cult audience with a proven appetite for seeing films more than once. After all, it’s not like filmgoers think, “I couldn’t be bothered to see Spider-Man for £15, but now that it’s an extra four minutes long, boy, am I getting my money’s worth!” Instead, says Grater, “Part of the reason these films get such enormous box office totals is that they are repeat-watched. People might go on opening night and they might go again with their friends or family. And so, again, you're just incentivising people to get back into cinema to buy another movie ticket.”\n\nCult popularity means a film can guarantee attendees at screenings and the more die-hard the fans, the more times a film might be reintroduced to cinemas. Even without any serious edits, Star Wars was theatrically rereleased in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982. And though George Lucas’s various manglings of his original sextet is the best known series of rereleases, thanks to Star Wars’ let’s be polite and go with “dedicated” fanbase, Blade Runner, at barely an eighth of the length of the Star Wars saga, has been through seven different cuts since 1982, almost all of which were shown in cinemas. If no one had fallen for either of these then-cult franchises, would Scott and Lucas have bothered recutting them consistently?\n\nHaving fans willing to quibble over narrative specifics is key and, oddly, characters played by Harrison Ford are at the centre of these quibbles. The 2007 edition of Blade Runner – known as the Final Cut, though who really believes that by this point? – suggests Deckard is a replicant much more strongly than the 1982 (and other) versions. Meanwhile, in A New Hope, the “Han/Greedo shot first” debacle is, frankly, not one I want to waste my life on, but it exists and people care a lot about it. Lucas has put out four reworkings of that scene, each time changing the politics of the quickdraw, including the original 1977 version, a 1997 special edition to accompany The Phantom Menace, a 2004 DVD version and then a 2011 Blu-Ray version. And even then, the Disney+ release of Star Wars last year changed it back to the original 1977 scene.\n\nIt’s not just legacy franchises that benefit from these edits, either. Grater highlights HBO’s recent announcement of Justice League’s Snyder Cut as an example of fans calling for the release of a cult product via social media. “You can see the rabid level of fandom around these movies,” he says. “If people have indicated they will pay for something, then studios will meet that demand.”\n\nAnd then there are the rereleases prompted by newfangled technological developments. George Lucas famously chucked all sorts of extra stuff into the later releases of the Star Wars films, from various different CGI Jabba The Hutts to, quite literally, some extra computer-generated rocks on the ground in Tattooine. But beyond that, Lucas had the first six films rereleased in 3-D from 2012 onwards. And this exciting new tech – yes, 3-D was once considered exciting – was one of the major drivers of rereleases this century.\n\nBy 2009, film studios and some industry insiders had become convinced that 3-D films were the antidote to falling cinema attendances, having not yet stumbled across the Faustian appeal of “cinematic universes”. The logic was that audiences would pay £18 to see older films revamped and converted into 3-D technology (incidentally, for a few years, going to the cinema as someone who already wore fairly large glasses became absolute hell).\n\nNostalgic filmgoers were treated to both Toy Story films in 2009, which pulled in $32m between them. There was The Lion King in 3-D in 2011, which made $60m. There was Beauty And The Beast ($62m), Finding Nemo ($54m), Monsters Inc ($37m). There was Titanic, released in 3-D in 2012 and allegedly partially censored in China, where authorities believed a three-dimensional version of the famous nude drawing scene might encourage attempts at virtual groping… but it made another $343m anyway.\n\nWhich, ultimately, brings us back to the point: that a rerelease can be clothed in many different attires. It might be to make a film look more high-brow or “classic” in black and white; it might be to change the meaning of a specific scene; it might be to include a few more minutes of footage to give super fans their fix; or it might be to bring much-loved older films up to date with technology. But, ultimately, none of these happen if there’s not a financial incentive, too. “With all of these things,” says Grater, “if the film doesn't get much attention, they're not going to bother rereleasing it. At the end of the day, this stuff is about making money.”\n\nNow read\n\nThe Oscars were proof that Mexico is one of the best filmmaking countries in the world\n\nMeet the £1,500 stormtroopers: inside the world of high-end Star Wars merchandise\n\nThe TV version of Snowpiercer is Murder On The Apocalypse Express"
