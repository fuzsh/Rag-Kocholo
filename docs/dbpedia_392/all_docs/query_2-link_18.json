        "text": "When most people imagine the past, many think of it as colorless. And why not? Most photographs and film from those times is in black and white, especially films. But what if it didn‚Äôt have to be?\n\nColor has been a part of motion picture history from its very beginning, when Thomas Edison projected a two-colored film as early as 1896. Most early color films involved hand-painted cells, tinting, or the stenciling method popularized by Pathechrome technology, however. It wasn‚Äôt until 1910 when true color started coming to film with Kinemacolor. Limited to hues of red and green‚Äîadding blue would destroy the film as it ran through the camera‚Äîthey brought the first flickers of color to moviegoers, even if they were often out of sync.\n\nTechnicolor, however, which began in 1915, fared much better than their competitors, and their first widely released color film, The Toll of the Sea (which you can see in full here), was a smash hit with audiences. Add to that a stabilized dyeing process invented in 1928, and by the late 1920s color film was a real possibility, even if 80 to 90 percent of films throughout the 1920s were still tinted or toned with a single color.\n\nThe following clips, however, feature a full range of glowing color given the limits of technology at the time. So, ready to see the past in a more colorful light? Then check out the following list of video clips below! üôÇ\n\n~*~\n\nA Kodak Kodachrome Film Test From 1922\n\nThis gorgeous Kodak film test comes from the George Eastman archives and features actresses Mae Murray, Hope Hampton, and Mary Eaton‚Äîplus a wonderful array of vivid colors and period hairstyles. Hope Hampton in particular is interesting; she‚Äôs shown modeling costumes from The Light in the Dark (1922), a Lon Chaney film which included bits of color footage.\n\nThe deep, rich colors were thanks to a new experimental photo-chemical process that involved a dual-lens camera. According to Vintage Everyday, the camera ‚Äúrecorded filtered images on black/white negative stock, then made black/white separation positives. The final prints were actually produced by bleaching and tanning a double-coated duplicate negative (made from the positive separations), then dyeing the emulsion green/blue on one side and red on the other. Combined they created a rather ethereal palette of hues.‚Äù\n\n~*~\n\nActress Mary Pickford Does a Color Screen Test\n\nSomeone on YouTube thinks this clip was a color test for Douglas Fairbank‚Äôs The Black Pirate, and they might be right! Especially since it was the first film ‚Äúdesigned entirely for color cinematography.‚Äù\n\n~*~\n\nVisit the Streets of London in 1926\n\nRestored by the British Film Institute‚Äôs National Archive, this video clip gives you a small tour of inner city London, complete with cute inter-title commentary! üôÇ\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested, an entire playlist of these videos can be seen here on YouTube. They seem to cover much of England and Scotland, all circa the mid-1920s.\n\n~*~\n\nA Short Color Test of Actress Claire Windsor\n\nHere‚Äôs a very short clip of actress Claire Windsor in a lovely feathered hat.\n\nWhile it seems she was never a big star herself, she was in a lot of movies and rubbed elbows with a lot of big names. You can hear an interview with her regarding her acting career here on YouTube, or check out this blog dedicated to her memory and film career.\n\n~*~\n\nWatch Flappers Sashay Down the Catwalk\n\nPoking around YouTube, I found quite a lot of these ‚Äúfashion films‚Äù from the late 1920s and early 1930s. While the models never do anything too exciting, it‚Äôs interesting to see the color combinations that were popular at the the time. Some clothing was much brighter, garish, or interesting than it seems in black and white.\n\nEach fashion clip features a short introductory inter-title card that describes the ensemble, then a model showing it off, often in fun locales. Check out the following mini-list:\n\nThis clip comes from 1928. Check out the crazy color combos on that hat and scarf ensemble at 0:50!\n\nThe pastels and beading designs really pop in this next clip, and you get a sense of the more flowing dresses that were also popular:\n\nThis clip lacks much color (aside from the sepia tints), but it has lots of great coats that make up for it, plus parks:\n\nAs you might have noticed, most of these films come from glamourdaze‚Äôs profile on YouTube. Their website features a ton of cool stuff on vintage fashion, including hairstyles and period clothing. You should check it out!\n\nEXTRA! EXTRA!\n\nInterested in the history of color film? Then check out this quick 21 minute video over at Filmmaker IQ .\n\nWant a list of the best tinted silent films? Then try Fritzi Kramer‚Äôs post on the history of color in silent films over at Movies Silently. Her blog is one of my absolute favorites!\n\n~*~\n\nI hope you enjoyed this brief peek into a more colorful past. If you‚Äôve got any cool film links from the 1920s, please post them in the Comments section below! I‚Äôd love to see them üôÇ"
