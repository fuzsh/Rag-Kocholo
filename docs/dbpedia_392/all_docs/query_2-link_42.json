And please forgive my typos: there are bound to be some.\n\nIt’s 1927 in New York City, and you are standing with your friends outside the Roxy Theater, waiting to see Wings, one of the biggest films of the year. A romance about two WWI pilots competing for the same woman, starring “It Girl” Clara Bow? Yes, please!\n\nIt’s your first time at the Roxy, which only just opened. It seats 6,200 people, making it the largest theater in the world. It is one of the many show-stoppingly lavish movie palaces of the period, built by film studios and designed for full orchestras to accompany their silent films. These palaces make the viewing experience a luxurious night out for filmgoers, but not one that’ll break the bank. After you pay your 25 cents for a ticket, you glide into the Roxy’s palatial lobby, which boasts enormous chandeliers, marble columns, and exquisitely furnished salons. Soon, attentive ushers begin leading you to the auditorium, reminding you that there are absolutely no snacks allowed inside the air-conditioned theater. You find your plush red seat and settle in as the lights go down, the projector flickers to life, and the orchestra begins to play.\n\nGoing to the movies is one of 1920s America’s favorite pastimes. And we are coming to worship our stars. By 1925, 50 million people are going to the movies every week: that’s about half of the nation’s population. And though theaters, like so much many places in this era, are segregated, going to the movies is one of the few leisure activities that’s popular across all social classes, enjoyed by socialites, bootleggers, and factory workers alike. Most who go to see them are under the age of 35, and most of them are women. We ladies love our films, and the stars who dominate them. The actresses of the era had a huge impact on the American woman’s imaginations, their tastes, their buying habits, even their morals. Hollywood’s actresses, and the character types they play, influence how we express and understand ourselves.\n\nToday, we’re going to dive into this iconic symbol of the 1920s, and the ladies who came to define them. We’ll find out more about the movies of the era, their young female stars, and find out just how they influenced so many. Grab your girlfriends, your fan mag, and don’t forget your ticket…It's movie night! Let’s go traveling.\n\nTHE RISE OF FILM\n\nBefore we talk about the silent starlets of the 1920s, we’ve got to talk a bit about the history of film itself. No one person invented cinema. But back in 1891, Thomas Edison (of the telegraph and lightbulb) manufactured something called a Kinetograph, or motion picture camera, and the Kinetoscope, a motion picture viewer that allowed a single viewer to watch it. France’s Lumiere brothers were the first to show projected moving pictures to a paying audience in 1895. The popularity of these very short films, and the industry they spawned, grew from there. By the early 1900s, nickelodeons were all the rage. These 15-to-20-minute interconnected film reels, often featuring people dancing, trains, planes, or cars moving at great speeds, vaudeville acts, newsreels, and animated shorts. Just a nickel would buy you an hour’s worth of nickelodeons.\n\nBut then a film came along that changed the moving picture game entirely. D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film, The Birth of a Nation, was about the Ku Klux Klan restoring peace to the South after the Civil War. Unfortunate subject matter aside, this three-hour silent, black-and-white extravaganza was the first real blockbuster movie, and it established many of the baseline features of modern cinematography. Thus, films leading up to the 1920s were usually 90 to 120 minutes long and featured dramatic action, elaborate sets, and a fairly new phenomena: movie stars. The ‘20s saw a number of “firsts” in film: the first western, the first sci-fi film, and the first two-color Technicolor film. But the industry was already undergoing some massive changes. Most films in the early 1920s were silent (accompanied by music played live in the theater). These featured intertitles, or pieces of printed text that appeared on film to indicate setting or dialogue. It was common for audiences to cheer, shout, and hold conversations during films – it was a more rowdy, communal experience. The actresses who really excel in silent movies have to have a commanding physical presence and a whole lot of expression – enough to show the audience what she’s feeling.\n\nBut then along came sound films, or “talkies,” which were introduced in 1925. In 1926, Fox added a soundtrack directly onto a strip of film using their MovieTone system, which would become predominant. In 1927, Warner Brothers built the first sound studio, and produced the first feature length talkie and musical, The Jazz Singer. Although it only had about 350 words of dialogue and 6 songs, it became the highest grossing film of the year, and revolutionized the industry. A year later, Walt Disney debuted the first speaking cartoon, Steamboat Willie. Sound films really change our filmgoing experience – audiences are now expected to be quiet so others can hear the dialogue, which makes viewing a more private affair.\n\nBy 1927, talkies have become so popular that movie attendance jumps to 100 million Americans a week. Studios and theaters had to be converted to sound at great expense. By the late 1920s, studios often made two versions of films so they could be released at both sound and silent theaters. By 1930, the silent movie had all but disappeared, and some of the era’s biggest movie stars went with them. Although stars like Joan Crawford and Gloria Swanson were able to make the transition to sound, some with heavy accents have a much harder time.\n\nWhat sorts of movies are we going to see in the 1920s? Most silent films can be classified into types or genres – with instantly recognizable storylines, settings, costumes, and characters. Popular genres include westerns, swashbucklers, historical costume dramas, war films, romances, biblical epics, crime capers, slapstick comedies, and melodramas. The demand for new films is so great that studios are churning out around 800 a year. Most aren’t very good, simply because they are produced so quickly and manufactured in assembly line style. They largely bank on the popularity of the film’s star rather than, say, well-written material. Often, its female star who brings starry-eyed viewers to the theater. They have a kind of sway over audiences, and American culture, than women have before.\n\nWOMEN STEAL THE SPOTLIGHT\n\nIn the 1920s, actresses are the beating heart of our movies. There are more famous actresses than there are actors. Female movie stars are often billed ahead of their male counterparts because studios know audiences have really come to see their favorite female star. As one of the era’s most famous, Gloria Swanson, once boasted, “All they had to do was put my name on a marquee and watch the money roll in.” These women are idols to be watched, icons to be worshiped. Actresses have a quasi-religious connection with their audience, who view them as accessible heroines who belong to the public. Men want to be with them, and women want to be them. Shopgirls copy them, and housewives escape through them. “They copied my clothes,” Colleen Moore once said. “No longer did a girl have to be beautiful to be sought after. Any plain Jane could become a flapper. No wonder they grabbed me to their hearts and made me their movie idol.” They teach American women how to behave, how to dress, how to flirt, how to style their hair, and even how to kiss. “No wonder the girls of older days before the movies were so modest and bashful,” one college gal says. “They never saw Clara Bow…I think the movies have a great deal to do with the present day so-called ‘wildness’. If we didn’t see such examples in the movies, where would we get the idea of being ‘hot?’ We wouldn’t.”\n\nThese women had a kind of power, financial success, and independence that few women can achieve in the 1920s. But stardom also comes with a strict set of rules and expectations, very little privacy, and a kind of pressure that proves deadly for some.\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD MACHINE\n\nBut before we meet some of our movie starlets, let’s take a look at the Hollywood studio machine. There are over 20 studios by the end of the decade, although the Big 5 (MGM, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox, and Warner Brothers) hold 70% of the national box office profits. Although Paramount is on the East Coast, most of the big studios are in California; 4 out of 5 films worldwide are coming out of Hollywood. And while the movie industry becomes famously exploitative of its women, as well as a patriarchal sausage fest, in the beginning, it’s a place where women compete on roughly equal terms with the men. They direct, produce, and write scripts, as well as acting. Between one-third and fully half of early screenwriters were women. Elinor Glyn, best-selling author of the 1910s and ‘20s, was offered good money to come to Hollywood and write what were called “scenarios” for the big screen. In 1920, she was making $10,000 a picture, and she directed some of those films herself.\n\nIn the 1920s, Hollywood’s film industry is infamous for scandal – mysterious murders, grisly suicides, sordid affairs, rape cases, and drug habits. In fact, when a young Clara Bow told her mother she was going to Hollywood to become a movie star, her mother said, “You’re goin’ straight to hell. I’d rather see ya dead.” Hollywood’s reputation gets so bad for public relations that in 1922, the studios establish a self-imposed censorship board, called the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. This group will be responsible for the Hays Code in the 1930s, which regulates the content of every film in America and bans everything from interracial dating to lustful kissing on screen.\n\nFor our 1920s film stars, though, this censorship board affects them most deeply in the form of their studio contracts. Every film star’s contract had a morals clause, which says that a star’s private conduct can’t bring her public disrepute or offend the public’s sense of decency. It allows studios total control of every aspect of their star’s lives. As the head of publicity at MGM remembers, “We told stars what they could say, and they did what we said because they knew we knew best.”\n\nMovies are about selling a lifestyle - a glamor. “All the adventure, all the romance, all the excitement you lack in your daily life are in Pictures,” one 1920s advertisement shouted. “They take you completely out of yourself into a wonderful new world…out of the cage of everyday existence.” Studios aren’t afraid to completely reinvent their stars. In fact, they often give them new names and make up their bios wholesale. Take Theda Bara, the screen siren who many refer to as The Vamp. Her studio told the public that this sex icon is a man-eating seductress from Arabia, who is often carried around by Nubian footmen. A powerful image, certainly, but complete fabrication. She was from Cincinnati, and happily married, and didn’t eat any men…that we know of. As the studios shape these star personas, the create a fantasy of female glamour and empowerment that defines what female stardom—and by extension, female identity—might mean.\n\nWe know that these actresses have some serious star power. So why put up with such rigid restrictions? Mostly because they have no choice. The studios have all the power, thanks to the standard 7-year contract they invented. While stars are locked in for the long haul, those contracts allow studios a chance every six months to either terminate the relationship or renew it for an increased salary. Stars are financially rewarded if they behave.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this means that actresses are often exploited, especially if they are just starting out. Clara Bow’s agent pays her $750 a week, and then loans her out to studios for over $3,000 a week, keeping the profits for himself. He often double books her, so much so that she appears in 14 movies in 12 months. She works from 6 am to midnight, 6 days a week, and eventually collapses from exhaustion. “There was no other occupation in the world,” film star Louise Brooks remembered, “that so closely resembled enslavement as the career of a film star.” Despite such conditions, actresses like Clara make careers for themselves, and their contributions were recognized accordingly. The first Academy Awards take place in 1929, and in 1927, 10 stars are invited to place their hands in wet cement outside of Grauman’s Chinese Theater for the first time, including Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, and Mary Pickford.\n\nit takes a certain type\n\nImage control is happening on screen, too. Actresses of the 1920s embody a narrow band of stereotypical roles that studios continue to offer them. Just as there are certain genres or “types” of movies, studios decide there are certain “types” of women as well. These can be separated into roughly two categories: let’s call them the Virgin and the Whore. We have the sweet-as-pie heroine you can’t help but root for: the rural sweetheart, the cheerful tomboy, the virginal martyr, the doting wife, the loving mother. And then we have the wilder end of the spectrum: the flapper, the vamp, the exotic beauty, the she-devil, and the man-eating seductress. Most actresses are cast in the same roles over and over, and their personalities and offscreen lives often dictate the roles they play. The glamorous Pola Negri is almost always cast as the exotic beauty, while the fun-loving Colleen Moore is almost always a flapper. A few stars were given the opportunity to showcase their range, or eventually become so powerful that they can choose their own roles. For the most part, though, they are relegated to a specific type, forced to make “formula” films that have them playing the same woman.\n\nHollywood isn’t interested in making films about smart, fierce, ambitious women in the 1920s. That goes against prevailing notions about women’s “proper” roles. Studios think that people are unlikely to pay to see a film that doesn’t end with a wild girl being tamed by marriage. It’s all well and good for a flapper to get up to mischief on screen, so long as she ends up a wife. Movie heroines in the 1920s are not allowed to sacrifice love for their career. They can pursue a career, but only if, by the end, it takes a backseat to a happily ever after with their new husband. Despite the free-wheeling image of the flapper in popular culture, Victorian values and the triumph of “conventional” virtue prevails in the silent films of the 1920s. Even the scandalous onscreen vamps and flappers never really challenge the status quo. They simply give it a little sex appeal. At their very wildest, actresses like Clara Bow will pose in satin and flirt with a married man onscreen, but by the time the credits roll, they’ve always been redeemed by an appropriate beau offering his hand in marriage. Or, in films like The Careless Woman, Foolish Wives, The Lure of the Night Club, or Wickedness Preferred, women aren’t the heroines at all, but the villains. They commit infidelity, larceny, and even murder, and all meet with horrible ends. These women serve as cautionary tales and a warning: Good girls don’t do such things. They get married.\n\nIronically, considering the messages their onscreen personas are sending, these actresses consistently chose careers over marriage. They are unapologetically ambitious career women who embrace fame, money, power, and sex. As Joan Crawford said, “You have to be self-reliant and strong to survive in this town. Otherwise you will be destroyed.” Many of these silent film stars are known for being cunning businesswomen with too many notches on their bedposts to bother counting, and they relish it. Let’s meet some of these women – the actresses whose faces are on every bedroom wall and theater screen in the 1920s.\n\nbig stars, big drama\n\nLike nearly all of the silent film stars of the era, Mary Pickford was born into a poor family, and became an actress through sheer force of will. “My career was planned, there was never anything accidental about it. It was planned, it was painful, it was purposeful.” Born Gladys Marie Smith, she made her stage debut at 6 years old to help support her family. At the age of 12, she approached a theater producer and introduced herself by saying, “I am an actress, but I want to become a good one.” Impressed, the producer changed her name to Mary Pickford and cast her in a lead role, where she soon caught the eye of famed film director, D.W. Griffith. After Mary’s first day on set, Griffith was so pleased with her that she was able to negotiate a pay raise, doubling her salary. She would appear in over 50 films in 1909 alone.\n\nBy 1912, Mary was the first bonafide movie star, having made a name for herself by playing child-like characters on screen… the virginal, rural sweetheart archetype was her bread and butter. Her signature blonde ringlets made her easy to recognize, and audiences adored her in her cheerful, self-reliant, underdog roles, like that of Judy, the spunky orphan inDaddy Long Legs. Fans quickly dubbed Mary “America’s Sweetheart,” and by 1916 she was the first millionaire film star. By the 1920s, Mary was the undisputed Queen of Hollywood. She had already successfully negotiated a record-breaking salary of $10,000 a week, but now she is determined to use her power to gain more control over her films. She joins the two biggest male film stars of the day, Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, and actress Lilian Gish to create the independent production company, United Artists, a move designed to stop studio exploitation and give actors more money, control, and, as Mary said herself, “Freedom. It’s a heady wine, and having tasted it, you find it impossible to go back to working for someone else.”\n\nShe would soon set up the Mary Pickford production company as well, allowing her to copyright all of her productions, guaranteeing her 50% of the profits, a massive salary, and full creative control of her films. It also allows her to broaden her range. She proves that she can switch effortlessly from comedies to dramas, from tomboy child to elegant lady. She often challenges herself by playing multiple roles in the same film. Uniquely for the era, she can choose her own scripts, hire her own costars, and act as her own producer and director. The founder of Paramount remarked, “Mary had her hand in everything, writing scripts, arguing with directors, making suggestions to other players… and her ideas were helpful,” with her cameraman adding, “She knew everything there was to know about motion pictures.”\n\nMary isn’t the industry’s only savvy businesswoman. Gloria Swanson became a star at Paramount for a string of successful romance films, in which she often plays the temptress. She brings in so much money for the studio that, in 1923, she negotiates a new contract that gives her an astronomical $6,500 per week. Her image as of a glamorous fashion icon: her extravagant headdresses of peacock feathers are often as important as the movie’s plot is. Her hairstyles, hat-styles, and skirt lengths inspire millions of women to follow her lead. In 1925, she joined United Artists as one of the film industry's pioneering women filmmakers, and creates her own company, Gloria Productions. And at the first annual Academy Awards, Gloria receives the Best Actress nomination for her 1928 film, Sadie Thompson, which she produces herself.\n\nGloria was unapologetic about her ambition. “I have decided that when I am a star, I will be every inch and every moment a star.” In a 1922 spread about Gloria, one magazine writer wrote, “Either you are fascinated by her… or you don’t like her at all.” Unlike Mary, who is universally adored, Gloria is divisive…and that’s why many women love her. She is a glamorous diva, gives outrageous quotes to fan magazines, and isn’t afraid to make a bold claim. She once told Motion Picture magazine, “I not only believe in divorce, but I sometimes think that I don’t believe in marriage at all…After all, marriage is just a game. The more elastic the rules, the less temptation there is for cheating. I think that divorce should be made more easy, instead of more difficult.” Mary Pickford may have been the first woman to make a million dollars in Hollywood, but Gloria Swanson is the first one to do the same and spend it loudly. In 1924, Photoplay magazine reports that Gloria spent $25,000 that year on furs, $50,000 on gowns, and $10,000 on lingerie – all this at a time when the average annual income was around $3,500. “In those days they wanted us to live like kings and queens…” she remembered of the studios, “so we did. And why not? We were in love with life. We were making more money than we ever dreamed existed, and there was no reason to believe that it would ever stop.”\n\nPola Negri, too, is something of a character, and like Gloria, she is often typecast in the exotic beauty role. Born Barbara Apolonia Chalupiec in Lipno, Poland, she works hard to make it into the Imperial Academy of Ballet, then eventually made the transition to film. Her first, Slave to Her Senses, in 1914, really capitalized on her sexuality and beauty. Later films like In Passion, One Arabian Night, and Gypsy Blood continue the trend. Her fans love to read tales of her extravagant and glamorous lifestyle. She has a white Rolls Royce upholstered in white velvet and dresses her chauffeur in an all-white uniform. She keeps a pet tiger on a leash and parades him down Sunset Boulevard, wrapped in chinchilla and draped in jewels. She even starts the fad for painting your toenails fire engine red. But she also makes staying single seem glamorous. “I do not believe in marriage,” she said. “It is not for me. I am independent. Freedom comes before anything.” And that lifestyle, that choice, was a radical one to the women who loved to come to her movies.\n\nClara Bow grew up extremely poor in Brooklyn, dropping out of school in 1921 to pursue her dreams of being a star. She had a hard time at first, fielding all sort of rejection. As she wrote later, “there was always something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat.” In 1922, she sent her picture into Brewster magazine’s national Fame and Fortune acting contest. She nailed several screen tests, won the contest, and was sent off to Hollywood. She spent several years being loaned out to studios to play smaller roles, but in 1926, Paramount cast her as the lead in the film, Mantrap. The film was a smash hit, with one critic writing, “Clara Bow! And how! What a mantrap she is! And how this picture is going to make her!.” Audiences fell in love with Bow’s vibrant energy, and Paramount got to work capitalizing on her new fame. In the next two years, she’d star in 14 movies, all of which were formula films whose plots revolved around Clara being Clara. Audiences came to see her be herself, so she and her characters were often interchangeable.\n\nThe characters Clara played were usually wild, sexy flappers, and she embodied the sexual freedom of the modern new woman both on screen and in her personal life. She was a bit of an outcast in Hollywood, with her heavy accent and vulgar vocabulary. She told one magazine columnist, “Marriage ain’t woman’s only job no more. A girl who’s worked hard and earned her place ain’t gonna be satisfied as a wife. I know this… I wouldn’t give up my work for marriage. I think a modern girl’s capable of keepin’ a job and a husband.” Clara was well known for her many public affairs - “The more I see of men, the more I like dogs,” she quipped – her drunken exploits, and her reckless driving. She personified what the New York Times would later call, “the giddier aspects of an unreal era, the Roaring Twenties.”\n\nClara Bow became a star in Mantrap, but she became “the movie star of all movie stars” in 1927 thanks to her role as Betty Lou in the film, It. It had begun as a novel about sex appeal by British screenwriter Elinor Glyn. She took it to Paramount, who agreed to make It a film, but only in exchange for Elinor labeling their new star, Clara Bow, as the It Girl. Elinor agreed (in exchange for $50,000), and Paramount’s publicity department were thrilled their star would have such a catchy new nickname. Elinor soon embarked on a lecture tour and announced, “Of all the lovely young ladies I’ve met in Hollywood, Clara Bow has ‘It.’ ‘It’ is an inner magic, an animal magnetism.” When the film eventually premiered, opening week grosses doubled that of every other movie in every city across America except Manhattan. It was a box office smash hit, with one Variety critic writing, “This Bow girl certainly has that certain It for which the picture is named, and she just runs away with the film.”\n\nIt starred Clara as Betty Lou, a salesgirl who lusts after her rich boss, the owner of the department store in which she works. Betty sells lingerie, but throughout the film, she proves even more adept at selling herself, aggressively pursuing her boss, and eventually marrying him. How did she manage to snag such a wealthy catch? By having “it” of course! In the film’s opening title cards, the audience learns that “it” is: “that quality possessed by some which draws all others with its magnetic force. With IT you win all men if you are a woman– and all women if you are a man. IT can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction… IT is that peculiar quality which some persons possess, which attracts the opposite sex. The possession of IT must be absolutely unself conscious and must have that magnetic “sex appeal” that is irresistible.” And Clara was irresistible. By 1928, she recieved 8,000 fan letters per week, more than double any other Paramount star. Many were simply addressed to the It Girl. Budd Schulberg remembered, “Clara Bow became not just a top box-office star but a national institution…Millions of followers wore their hair like Clara's and pouted like Clara, and danced and smoked and laughed and necked like Clara.”\n\nClara Bow had sex appeal, and the film It presented a world in which it was acceptable for women to be fully in control of their own sexuality. In fact, rather than being punished for her sexually forward behavior, Betty Lou is rewarded for it, landing the wealthy husband by the end of the film. In fact, many of Clara’s films, like Mantrap, It, or Get Your Man, involved her playing sexually independent characters taking on aggressive roles in romantic courtship, turning society’s norms upside down. On screen, Clara unapologetically acted out female sexual agency and they loved her for it. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, “She was the girl of the year, the ‘It’ girl, the girl for whose services every studio was in violent competition. This girl was the real thing, someone to stir every pulse in the nation.”\n\nHaving “It” made Clara one of the first sex symbols in America. Ironically, the It Girl didn’t even like the idea of “it,” and she hated the pretentious Elinor Glyn. When Elinor told Clara to stop chewing gum and swearing, Clara refused and took to calling her “that shithead.” When asked, “Miss Bow, when you add it all up, what is ‘It’?” she replied, “I ain’t real sure.” And yet, her fame only made Paramount work her harder, and the pressure mounted for Clara to live up to her new sex symbol status. Buddy Rogers wrote, “She tried to be vivacious, she tried to be fascinating, she tried to be clever, and she just worked her body and mind and soul to death.” Clara wearily told one interviewer, “a sex symbol is always a heavy load to carry, especially when one is very hurt, tired, and bewildered.”\n\nWhile Louise and Clara play more sexualized flappers, Colleen Moore and Joan Crawford find fame by playing a more wholesome, free-spirited variety. Although Joan is now considered the quintessential flapper, she only breaks out in 1928’s Our Dancing Daughters. For most of the 1920s, it’s Colleen Moore, with her Dutch-boy style bob, who is considered the epitome of flapperdom. Colleen’s big break came as a flapper in 1923’s Flaming Youth. F. Scott Fitzgerald, ever humble, would later boast in Motion Picture magazine, “I was the spark that lit up Flaming Youth, Colleen Moore was the torch. What little things we are to have caused all that trouble.” Colleen stars in many flapper films, all of which feature her as a spunky working girl who appears modern but who always keeps herself just on the right side of virtuous. When asked to describe her flapper characters, Colleen said, “She likes her freedom, and she likes to be a bit daring, and snap her cunning, manicured little fingers in the face of the world; but fundamentally, she is the same sort of girl as my grand-mamma was when she was young!”\n\ndiversity, or lack thereof\n\nThe majority of silent film stars in the ‘20s are white; when someone of another race is needed in a movie, it’s not uncommon for a white actor to slap on black or yellow face. A few women of color do make it in Hollywood. Sadly, most are reduced to playing roles defined wholly by racist stereotypes.\n\nDolores del Río was born to an aristocratic Mexican family. When her mother told her, “No daughter from a good family ever became an actress,” Dolores replied, “Very well then. I will be the first.” After her 1925 debut, Dolores becomes a leading lady and is often billed in sexualized, exotic lover roles, which frustrates her. But she considered one of the most beautiful stars of the era, with playwright George Bernard Shaw writing, “the two most beautiful things in the world are the Taj Mahal and Dolores del Río.” Dolores is friends with Frida Kahlo and Greta Garbo, has an affair with Orson Welles, and goes on to become one of the most important figures in Mexican cinema. Lupe Vélez hails from Mexico, and she also finds fame playing stereotypically exotic, hot-tempered women. Her wild unpredictably is part of what makes her so beloved. As one studio exec once said of her, “when she puckers up her lips, it’s impossible to tell if she is going to kiss you, bite you, or spit on you!” Her colorful offscreen life is just as wild, earning her the nickname “the Mexican Spitfire.” She has high-profile affairs with Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, and Gary Cooper. Her relationship with Cooper is quite famously rocky (he required stitches after an incident in which she chased him around with a knife), and it eventually got so bad that he lost 45 pounds and his studio sent on a vacation. Whilst he was boarding the train, Velez showed up and shot at him. Poor Cooper definitely needed a vacation after that.\n\nAnd then there’s Anna May Wong. Born in Los Angeles to first-generation Chinese American parents, she grew up loving the movies and using them as a way to escape the racist bullying she often faced. She becomes the first Chinese American woman to feature in the movies, and a fashion icon. But she, like so many other non-white women in the films in the ‘20s, grew frustrated by the stereotypical and sometimes demeaning roles the studios force her to play.\n\nTHE 1920s GOSSIP RAG\n\nThe public’s hunger to find out more about their favorite stars inspires the first celebrity gossip mags. Magazines like Photo Play, Picture Play, Motion Picture, and Screenland are filled with stories and photos of stars, making fans feel like they really “know” them. They offer film reviews, answer questions about how movies are made, and of course share gossip about stars’ love lives. They endlessly debate and poll their readers about which actor is the most handsome or which actress is the most fashionable. No in-depth expose or interview is too personal. Reporters ask female stars a host of what they must find inane questions. “They wanted to know if I liked tall men or short men,” Gloria Swanson complained. “How often I ate dessert, what my favorite breed of dog was, if I dyed my hair, what my favorite color was, if I got depressed on rainy days, what my favorite flower was, if I considered myself stuck up, if I thought So-and-so was a nice dressed, if I ever obeyed silly impulses.”\n\nMost issues come with full-page photographs of their cover star, designed to be cut out and hung on the wall. They include all the intimate details about movie stars that fans clamor for: what color their eyes are, what perfume they wear, and who they’re dating. Much of it is happily provided by the studio’s publicity department. These details make the stars seem more real, but it also solidifies them as market commodities – their celebrity permanently strips them of any semblance of a private life. Indeed, reading movie magazines enables fans to get as close as possible to their onscreen role models. In fact, some magazines offered advice columns, penned by the stars themselves, and give fans studio addresses so that they could send their favorite actress a letter or three.\n\nThe readers of these magazines, many of which have a circulation of at least half a million, are mainly white, unmarried teenage girls from the working and middle classes. Their obsession with movies and their stars become something of a nationwide joke. Much like our culture poked fun at the Twilight-loving teenage girl and her obsessive fandom, people in the 1920s complain about the budding flapper girls who they think are way too invested in film. These girls scream with delight in the theaters, bobbed their hair to look like Louise Brooks, spent their allowance on short skirts to look like Colleen Moore, and get grounded for staying out too late to see the latest Garbo film. Nobody knows the dark side of fandom better than Mary Pickford. When she marries Douglas Fairbanks, the ultimate celebrity couple is mobbed on their honeymoon. Mary is bodily pulled out of their open car, and Douglas ends up gallantly carrying his new wife on his shoulders, so she won’t be trampled."
