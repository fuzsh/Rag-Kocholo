        "text": "When it comes to early cinema, there exists a common misconception that silent films are all black and white.\n\nBut what if I told you silent films are tinted, toned, and hand-painted in an array of vibrant colors?\n\nColor is language; color elicits emotions, memories, and sensations that bring to life the emotional landscape of the cinematic experience. Delicate film frames emulate tiny stained glass windows, and when projected, their iridescent illuminations bathe the cinematic experience in an exquisite display of vivid possibilities.\n\nSo how did silent film get its color when the film stock itself was black and white? In this month’s blog, I will focus on the most popular methods of adding color to early films, and their everlasting cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance.\n\nHand Painting and Stencil Color\n\nHand-Painting\n\nBefore the turn of the 19th century, color was hand-painted onto each film frame using very fine brushes. Remember, the frame rate during this time ranged from 16 to 20 frames per second. That meant that for every minute of film, 960 to 1,200 frames had to be individually hand-painted. Because the process was never organized on an industrial scale, there would be variations from frame to frame with a lack of definition on the edges of the colored areas.\n\nAs one might imagine, this intricate process was extremely time-consuming and was gradually replaced by stenciling after 1903.\n\nPathécolor Stencil Process\n\nDuring the early 20th century, inventor Segundo de Chomón developed a new, faster colorization technique. Pathécolor was a stencil process used to mechanize the application of color by creating a stencil for the entire film. This required the manual cutting, frame by frame, of the area which was to be tinted onto another identical print, one for each color. The process became so successful that it was used well into the late 1920s, often in combination with tinting and toning.\n\nBoth hand-painting and stenciling was a deliberate creative expression. The brilliance of the filmmaker’s vision was painted by women who were believed to be innately suited to the task due to their “feminine intuitions”. These women were considered highly specialized personnel and were offered relatively high wages for their work.\n\nTinting and Toning\n\nThe most popular method for coloring silent cinema was through the use of tinting and toning. Interestingly, this color process first began as a way to control film pirating (until the pirates discovered bleach).\n\nTo tint a film, one would soak the black and white film sock in a colored dye to stain the emulsion. To tone a film, the silver particles of the emulsion would be replaced with colored, silver salts.\n\nPut simply, tinting produced a uniform color, while toning colored only the darker areas-leaving lighter parts white. If you don’t know or can’t remember what an emulsion is, head back to Film 101: The Basics for a quick refresher!\n\nGrowing in popularity, tinting and toning soon adopted a more narrative cause: setting the cinematic mood. Colors were either used for a literal or a more abstract interpretation. For example, blue could signal nighttime or it could represent scenes of magic and tales of the fantastic marvelous.\n\nA modern instance of blue tinting and toning is displayed in the 2016 film Moonlight. This coming-of-age drama is told in three distinct chapters, and each was filmed to imitate a distinct film stock. The most unique looking chapter in Moonlight is the second, which colorist Alex Bickel credits to the old Agfa film stock it was set to emulate. This long-retired German film stock had a reputation for adding cyan to the image, which is what gives the second chapter its meaningful blue hue.\n\nDuring the silent period, however, colored features were not yet this advanced. In reality, many silent feature tints and tones were chosen from an arbitrary range of dyes. Contrary to the popular belief that silent films were all black and white, about 85% of silent films employed some type of color tinting and toning. Today’s photographic and digital imaging methods often pale in comparison to the subtle or saturated, vibrant, and divinely exquisite colors of tinting and toning.\n\nLearn more\n\nHandschiegl Color Process\n\nEnhancing the look of film was a new color process devised by engraver Max Handschiegl. Originally known as the DeMille-Wycoff process, Handschiegl Color applied up to three colors on separate prints before they were transferred onto a positive print. The Handschiegl Process made its debut in Cecil B. Demille’s Joan the Woman (1916) and allowed frames to be selectively colored to heighten dramatic effect.\n\nIn 2017, the George Eastman Museum embarked on an extensive restoration project on Joan the Woman. The team had to isolate the Handschiegl colored images within these specific scenes and correct them frame by frame to ensure the look they had when projected would be accurately portrayed in the digital version. For many decades the film has been seen in less than pristine copies missing most of its color effects. For this restoration, the George Eastman Museum returned to Cecil B. DeMille’s personal nitrate print.\n\nLearn more\n\nIf the majority of silent films were colored, why are they always remembered as black and white?\n\nOne of the main reasons is that colored prints rapidly fade if they are not preserved in ideal conditions. In addition, sometimes only the black and white copies of a film manage to survive. Through exhaustive efforts by archivists, the color process may be able to be restored or duplicated by using the original production notes and other specifications of existing documentation on the film in question. A question of ethics arises when these production notes are lost. In such cases, the team of archivists must decide whether to make educated guesses on the filmmaker's intent and use of the coloring process or to preserve the film in black and white.\n\nTechnicolor\n\nThe Technicolor Corporation was established in 1915 to develop and commercialize color motion pictures. Technicolor began as a two-color additive process where a prismatic beam-splitter produced separate red and green exposures inside the camera and superimposed them during projection. Simply put, the image projected only contained red and green hues which emphasized skin tone and foliage.\n\nUnfortunately, this process proved too complicated for public projection, and the Technicolor Corporation retreated from the public eye until the first two-color subtractive camera was designed in 1921. In contrast to the first Technicolor process, Technicolor II recorded two black and white images on one negative strip. Importantly, this subtractive method could be shown in any standard film projector. In 1922, the commercial viability of subtractive technicolor was confirmed with the widely popular release of Toll of the Sea.\n\nThe Toll of the Sea is a magnificent film written by Frances Marion and featuring Asian-American actress Anna May Wong cast as the film’s tragic protagonist. Frances Marion was one of many female screenwriters employed by the motion picture industry and served as one of the highest-paid screenwriters of the time. In fact, an estimated half of the 25,000 scripts registered between the years 1911- 1929 were written by women and often ranked among the highest-grossing silent films of all time. With the coming of sound, however, came the silencing of women’s voices. Gradually, women’s roles in the film industry collapsed under the establishment of studio systems and this rampant gender-based discrimination continues even today. In 2019, women screenwriters wrote less than 20% of the highest-grossing Hollywood films (believe it or not, this figure is extremely high compared to previous years).\n\nWhile women’s roles in writing and directing declined, many could still find employment as color specialists. In the late 1920s, Natalie Kalmus founded the “Color Advisory Service” to consult in the design and colors of sets, costumes, and furnishings. Kalmus believed that the colors in a film should be taken as seriously as those chosen for painting showcased in museums.\n\nDespite the commercial success of Toll of the Sea, Hollywood remained wary of investing in Technicolor. On one hand, access to color allowed them additional artistic tools. On the other hand, technicolor was incredibly expensive and studios remained unconvinced of technicolor’s value until the coming of sound in 1929.\n\nWatch The Two-Color Process for a more in-depth look at Technicolor I and II.\n\nEarly on, the engineers at Technicolor realized that a three-color process was the goal. After perfecting the two-color process, engineers were able to add an additional film to the camera. In 1926, Technicolor introduced a new process that eliminated the use of the “cemented” positive and allowed for the mass production of prints. To this day, Technicolor’s dye-transfer printing process remains its greatest legacy.\n\nTo learn more about Technicolor's dye transfer watch The Dye Transfer Printing Process.\n\nBy 1932, the Technicolor Corporation perfected the three-color system, which soon became the first entirely successful motion picture coloring process. For the next twenty years, Technicolor dominated the production of color films and held a monopoly over the film industry.\n\nTo this day, the George Eastman Museum has the largest existing collection of artifacts and films related to the history of Technicolor. In the words of former senior curator of the Moving Image Department at the George Eastman Museum Paolo Cherchi Usai, “the Technicolor collection is the jewel in the crown of the George Eastman House”."
