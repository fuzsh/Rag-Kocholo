At one point, everybody actually runs past the south side of the Masonic Hall, during which we get a glimpse of the back of the Shoe Repairing shop run by J. A. Pryor at 3406 Motor. At the beginning of the film, Farina walks past the Micholithic Mfg. Co. on the east side of the 3300 block of Motor. This building had previously housed the Palms Chamber of Commerce. Joe and Peggy are sitting on the park bench at the northwest corner of Motor and Woodbine. The bench advertises the chamber, which was now on the 3400 block.\n\nCulver Hotel, Culver City\n\nGene's wagon is parked along Washington Boulevard, with the hotel seen in the background. It appears that he's at or near the eastern corner of Van Beuren Place. The railing for the entrance to the underground walkway can be seen on the opposite side of Washington.\n\nVenice Boulevard, Los Angeles\n\nThe cop phones in after arresting the gang at the northwest corner of Venice and Arlington. Next to him is the Co-operative Sheet Metal Shop. Also seen is the Geo. C. Bell Service Station on the northeast corner, at 2575 Venice.\n\nmiscellaneous:\n\nReportedly, 19 shooting dates went into the making of this film. However, the 1924 and 1925 studio datebooks don't mention \"Ask Grandma\" (no. 38), which is somewhat of a sequel to \"The Love Bug.\" Since most of the films during this period didn't require 19 shooting dates, it's probable that some of the A37 dates actually belong to A38. Nearly three weeks after shooting had finished for \"Dog Days\" (no. 36), the 'start' date arrived for \"The Love Bug\" on Dec. 15th. Shooting continued until Dec. 31st, when filming was considered 'finished.' No shooting took place on the 14th, 21st or 28th, which were all Sundays, nor on the 24th, 25th, or 26th, when the studio closed over the Christmas holiday, nor on the 30th. After taking a day off on New Year's Day, retakes were shot on Jan. 2nd and 3rd. Filming then continued until Jan. 10th, when it was again considered 'finished'. However, the word 'retakes' is not used for the last week of shooting, further suggesting that \"Ask Grandma\" may have been in production. No shooting took place on Jan. 4th, which was a Sunday. After this, the unit took a week off before filming \"Shootin' Injuns\" (no. 39).\n\n40 still images were printed into numerous press photos to promote this film."
