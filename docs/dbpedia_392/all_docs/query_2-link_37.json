        "text": "1920’s Cultural and Societal Impact\n\nThe 1920s was a time of invigorating social changes and significant social clashes. For some Americans, the development of urban areas, the ascent of a shopper culture, the upsurge of mass amusement, and the alleged “unrest in ethics and habits” spoke to freedom from the limitations of the nation’s Victorian past. Socially acceptable sexual behaviors, sex jobs, haircuts, and dress all changed significantly during the 1920s. However, the United States appeared to be changing in unwanted manners. The outcome was a not at all subtle “social common war,” in which a pluralistic culture conflicted harshly over such issues as outside migration, development, the Ku Klux Klan, denial, ladies’ jobs, and race. These significant changes in the 20’s affected film in many ways. Some examples include the following:\n\nCulture:\n\nSurrealism, which was an artistic movement that sought to activate the creativity of the unconscious mind, highly influenced horror films in the 1920s. In the 1920’s film “Un Chien Andalou”, surrealism was adapted in the mystical horror film.\n\nIn this decade, silent films were the most popular style of the film. The favoritism of silent films was represented in the popular showings of ” Sunrise: A Rise of Two Humans” and “Metropolis”.\n\nThe first fully animated film was in 1928, represented in black and white film shorts. This advance in film production was incorporated into horror filmmaking.\n\nSocietal:\n\nRacial discrimination in the 1920s caused there to be no racial diversity in horror films during this time period.\n\nDue to the highly patriarchal society that existed in the 1920s and the limited women’s rights during the time, there were no female leads in horror films.\n\nIdeal eugenics became an even bigger issue during this time period. Therefore, only conventionally attractive, white people were allowed to star in the film. Also due to eugenics, Nazism was spreading and genocide/demonization of people became a theme in horror films."
