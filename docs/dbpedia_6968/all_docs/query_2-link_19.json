        "text": "(Originally posted on Channel Awesome on September 8, 2014)\n\n​The beloved children's classic The Secret Garden comes to life in this beautifully filmed adaptation from 1993.\n\n​1n 1910, The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett was originally published in serial form in The American Magazine, a publication typically for adults. The following year, it was republished as a novel with illustrations by M.B. Kork. Aimed at both younger and older readers, the book wasn't as much of an immediate success as Burnett's other works (which include Little Lord Faunterloy and The Little Princess). In fact, her obituary didn't even mention The Secret Garden. Over the years, however, it's become a beloved children's classic, and naturally it's been filmed many times going all the way back to the Silent Era. It was director Agnieszka Holland's favorite book while growing up in Poland, and directing a film adaptation of it was a passion project of hers.\n\nWARNING: Here be spoilers! Read further at your own risk!\n\n​The film opens with Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly) narrating about her lonely upbringing in India. Her parents want nothing to do with her, as they're too preoccupied with going to parties and social functions, leaving her to be looked after by servants. To make matters worse, there's no one around for her to befriend. When her parents die in an earthquake, she's shipped back to her native England, where she ruefully watches other children being collected by their own families at the docks. Eventually, she's retrieved by Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith), housekeeper for Mary's uncle and new guardian, Lord Craven (John Lynch). Due to her pampered upbringing, Mary not only has no idea how to even dress herself, but she behaves as a total brat towards Martha (Laura Crossley), a young servant who looks after her.\n\nHowever, Mary makes a couple of very important discoveries during her stay at her new home, Misselthwaite Hall. First she finds the key to a garden that her late aunt adored spending time in, but which has been neglected since her death. She also sometimes hears the sound of someone crying, and refuses to believe Mrs. Medlock when she tells Mary she's just imagining it. However, Mary goes exploring, and discovers a sickly boy her own age - her cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse). Due to his ill health and everyone treating him so delicately, Colin believes he's going to die. Throughout the course of the film, Mary not only attempts to revitalize her aunt's secret garden, but Colin as well. ​\n\n​I liked the acting in this film overall, and given how hit or miss child performances can be, that's high praise. Kate Maberly did well enough to earn a special award from the London Critics Circle for her performance, as well as a Young Artist Award nomination. Maggie Smith naturally does an excellent job as Mrs. Medlock, playing her as strict and stern, but not a one-dimensional bully. It's clear that Mrs. Medlock concerned about Colin's health and is genuinely scared that Mary might hurt Colin somehow. John Lynch also strikes a careful balance as a grief-stricken widower concerned about his son's welfare, making sure not to overplay his sorrow.\n\nThe Secret Garden was shot on various locations throughout England, with Allerton Castle in Yorkshire standing in for Misselthwaite Hall and the titular garden being filmed at Fountains Hall (the grounds of which include the ruins of Fountains Abbey, a prominent setting in Robin Hood lore). Production designer Stuart Craig, who won Academy Awards for his work on Gandhi (1982) and Dangerous Liaisons (1989), created the garden from scratch, rather than having to work around an existing garden (especially since they had to shoot scenes set across multiple seasons). To best convey the magic of the garden, the film employed time-lapse cinematography to capture flowers' growth and blooming, and it works amazingly well. (Nowadays, they'd probably just use CGI, which I think would look too artificial.) The sets and costumes have a similar attention to minute detail, giving them an organic, natural appearance.\n\n​I remember being told this movie didn't do well at the box office, but from what I can tell, it made a decent amount of money. It was a huge hit with critics, and has become more appreciated over time (a bit like the book itself). Zbigniew Preisner's lovely musical score won a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and Maggie Smith earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Kate Maberly's still acting, having appeared in The Langoliers mini-series (1995) and Finding Neverland (2004). Heydon Prowse hasn't done any acting since this film, but he's worked as a cinematographer and director on several short films, and he recently co-created the television series The Revolution Will Be Televised (2012). Maggie Smith, of course, has made appearances in the Harry Potter film series and is one of the stars of Downton Abbey, which is starting its 5th season in the UK some time this month."
