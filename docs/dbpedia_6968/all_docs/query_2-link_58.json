        "text": "Maybe it’s not worth complaining that there aren’t more films like The Secret Garden when the way it quietly excels is partially dependent on how modest its pleasures are in comparison to its louder peers.\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\n...though Solomon seems to assert that his films fundamentally consist of the physical images themselves, and not what those images might represent, he doesn’t abandon representational imagery completely...\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nVisually, The Secret Garden is enchanting. Working in English for the first time, with Francis Coppola as her executive producer, Agnieszka Holland conjures up a fairy-tale world of images...\n\nOctober 9, 2019\n\nWhile drawing superb performances from her young leads, Holland has masterfully contrasted the garden -- a place where melodic robins seem almost conversant -- with the dread of Misselthwaite.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nThe film retains the gothic atmosphere of the book and looks amazing, thanks to Roger Deakins's scintillating photography. Stealing the show is Maggie Smith as beastly housekeeper Mrs Medlock.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nThat`s a more upscale marketing concept than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it still doesn't make the movie any good.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nThe movie's dark themes, unhurried pace and talkiness make it something of a gamble for many children. But older children -- especially those who have been asking specific questions about death -- may find some nourishment in this garden.\n\nAugust 16, 2017"
