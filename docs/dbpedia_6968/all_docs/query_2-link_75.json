        "text": "The 17th of October is Garden Day! And The Bioscope is getting involved with a special screening of the 90s heartwarmer 'The Secret Garden'. With other activies and activations planned here at 44 Stanley, on the day, a great day can be had for the whole family.\n\nDirector: Agnieszka Holland. Drama Family Fantasy. Dur: 1h 41mins.\n\nA young, recently-orphaned girl is sent to England after living in India all of her life. Once there, she begins to explore her new, seemingly-isolated surroundings, and its secrets.\n\nGarden Day is a chance for people across the country to down tools and celebrate their gardens. Everyone can take part, regardless of the size of their gardens – rolling lawns, potted window sills, urban rooftops and patio planters – all are welcome. Visit their official site here.\n\nCOVID POLICY AND PROCEDURE.\n\nThe new Bioscope location is set to be a 47 seater cinema. We are however selling far less in order for there to be space to sit apart from other members of the public. We ask you to please keep your mask on the entire time within the cinema premises. Drinks and snacks will be on sale and can be consumed during the film, but please consider those around you when your mask is off for this. 44 Stanley is largely an open air shopping centre, and The Bioscope has a great outside space directly outside the cinema that public can make use of. Within the cinema, we will also make use of temperature reading, air filtering, and constant cleaning to make sure that The Bioscope remains a safe and hygienic experience."
