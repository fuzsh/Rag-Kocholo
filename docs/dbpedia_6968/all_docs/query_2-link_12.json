        "text": "A fawn, a bunny, a lamb: these are among the last things anyone might expect to see in a film directed by Agnieszka Holland, whose other work (including \"Europa, Europa\" and \"Olivier, Olivier\") had not a trace of sugarplums in its makeup. Yet Ms. Holland's film of \"The Secret Garden\" is elegantly expressive, a discreet and lovely rendering of the children's classic by Frances Hodgson Burnett. That book is a paean to the restorative powers of the natural world, and Ms. Holland succeeds in conveying much of its delicate beauty.\n\nFor all its raining rose petals and time-lapse shots of springtime, this \"Secret Garden\" remains in some ways relatively austere. It has been made without the preciousness that is this story's greatest liability, and with a lush visual prettiness that could not have been captured onstage (where \"The Secret Garden\" was the basis for a successful 1991 musical). Aside from simply telling this story, Ms. Holland (and the screenwriter Caroline Thompson, who wrote \"Edward Scissorhands\") also strengthen some of its underpinnings. The director's touch is most noticeable in scenes setting forth the trauma and the unhappiness from which Mary Lennox, the 10-year-old heroine of \"The Secret Garden,\" must gradually recover.\n\nIn a striking and mysterious opening sequence, Mary is seen as a child in India, standing by solemnly while her servants dress her. As played by Kate Maberly, she is at first spoiled and unpleasant, though by no means the sallow and homely creature Burnett described. Mary's life of privilege and her parents' neglect leave her wholly unprepared for her destiny, which takes her to England after her parents die suddenly (of cholera in the novel, and in a far more photogenic earthquake in the film). To Mary's surprise, the servants in her uncle's manor house expect her to dress herself, and to entertain herself as well.\n\nMs. Holland's \"Secret Garden,\" being the kind of film in which a kitchen maid sings \"Greensleeves\" while rolling dough, is not blunt in presenting many of life's little difficulties. So it offers a charming depiction of Martha (Laura Crossley), the smiling Yorkshire servant girl who manages to become Mary's friend, without dwelling too long on those contrasts between the two girls' lives that Burnett described. (Mary lives in a 100-room house, while 14 members of Martha's family share a cottage and live on 16 shillings a week.) Signs of Mary's unhappiness, like a quick, wrenching nightmare that shows a child being abandoned in a garden by her mother, are easily outweighed by the grandeur of her new surroundings.\n\nEven as it displays a fine appreciation of the decorative arts, the film manages to remain carefully ambiguous. It can be seen reveling in a subtly rarefied atmosphere, but it can be seen as celebrating nature as a force for freedom. This much is certain: once Mary falls in love with the outdoors and discovers the garden of the title, the place develops the kind of tangled, profusely exploding greenery that cannot be achieved without the help of a good-sized staff. Magically, Mary tends the place alone all day and never returns home caked in telltale mud.\n\nThe sun comes out midway through \"The Secret Garden,\" once Mary begins spending time with ruddy-cheeked Dickon (Andrew Knott), the lad who is Martha's brother and a great friend to flora and fauna. Under the influence of Dickon, and of mysterious powers that Ms. Holland renders as rushing clouds and swirling leaves, Mary begins to blossom just as surely as the bulbs send up shoots. Photographed luxuriantly by Roger Deakins, the film's abundant floral imagery eventually eradicates the stately gloom of its early scenes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
