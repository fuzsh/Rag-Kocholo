        "text": "This is one of the most beautiful stories you can imagine, Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved tale about the magic of nature and the nature of magic. It’s been adapted to create a brand new version of the book, a deliciously delightful tale revealing the sheer power of love.\n\nThe Secret Garden - A beautiful story about nature, transformation, and love\n\nOrphan Mary Lennox is ten years old. She’s an unhappy, sickly, bad tempered little girl who was ignored by her wealthy parents and spoiled by their servants. When her mum and dad died in a cholera epidemic Mary is sent, like a sad little human parcel, from India to Yorkshire to live with an Uncle she has never met... and her life changes forever.\n\nThe house is called Misselthwaite Manor, a depressing place full of secrets and spooky sounds. But when Mary discovers a lovely old neglected garden through a mysterious door, it speaks to her. She slowly learns how to be happy, making friends with the birds, the animals, the grumpy gardener and an odd boy who talks to the animals. And as the garden slowly comes back to life, Mary’s life blossoms.\n\nA fresh new version performed outdoors at Regents Park Open Air theatre\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett's radical tale has been adapted by Holly Robinson (Soft Animals, Soho Theatre) and Anna Himali Howard (Graceland, Royal Court; Orpheus, Opera North). The magic happens at the beautiful Regents Park in London as part of their enduringly popular Open Air Theatre’s 2024 season.\n\nThe book and Lyrics come from Marsha Norman and the music from Lucy Simon. The production is Directed by Anna Himali Howard and the creative team includes Tingying Dong the Sound Designer, Polly Jerrold the Casting Director, and Jai Morjaria the Lighting Designer. Hana Pascal Keegan is Associate Director, Khadija Raza is the Costume Designer and Leslie Travers is the Set Designer.\n\nStill just as popular after 113 years\n\nThis beautiful ‘pastoral story of self-healing’ was published in book form during 1911 by its American author and it resonates just as strongly today, a classic piece of English children's literature that appeals to adults as well as children. It’s a powerful yet gentle tale of transformation, the power of nature, positive thinking, and their impact on the human spirit. It has been adapted for the movies, TV and stage with three different BBC TV versions in 1952, 1960, and 1975 plus films in 1949 and in 1993, and a Broadway musical that ran from 1991 to ‘93.\n\nThe Secret Garden musical was produced for the London Fringe in 1987 and 1993, Off-Broadway in 2016, in Houston, Texas in 2017, and now it’s due back in London. The gorgeous show tunes include Get Up Miss Mary, Other Little Girls, Misselthwaite Hall, The Secret Garden, Give It a Try, Lillian, Nightfolk, The Little Rajah, Roses, Dai and I, and That's Spring."
