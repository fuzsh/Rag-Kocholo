        "text": "Agnieszka Holland is lost in a Communist labyrinth. Before and behind her stretch the corridors of Warsaw's television headquarters, with their peeling walls and padded doors, their ominous dun-colored sameness and the rancid redolence of a defeated ideology. Holland peers ahead through thick spectacles, her disorientation mounting as identical vistas emerge around each corner. But her pace never slackens. \"This,\" the Polish-born movie director mutters in exasperation, \"is the architecture of repression.\"\n\nAlthough recently embraced by Hollywood, Holland understands rejection and repression in her bones. Her highly successful 1991 film, \"Europa, Europa,\" about a young German Jew propelled by outlandish chance into the Hitler Youth, made her the most talked-about European director in the United States. Her 1992 film, \"Olivier, Olivier,\" in which a young boy disappears and seemingly reappears six years later, added fuel to the enthusiasm. But to reach America, Holland had to fight -- and still she struggles to escape her past. Imprisoned in Prague, exiled in France and long persecuted in her own country, Holland has repeatedly paid for a mixed Polish Catholic and Jewish ancestry that places her at the hub of this century's violence.\n\nHolland stops at the intersection of four hallways and ponders her next move. During the 1970's, she came to this building only to bang her head against bureaucratic walls. Her scripts were always rejected, generally without reason. Impassive Communist functionaries would try to break her will. Holland responded with a singular willfulness aimed at making the system bend.\n\n\"They wanted to push me to emigrate like a lot of Polish Jews,\" she says now, still trying to find her bearings, still bustling forward. \"For 11 years I was refused a passport but told I could have a one-way passport to Israel. I said no thank you, I am very well here. It was a long game, a provocation to myself.\"\n\nIt is not easy to make Agnieszka Holland bend. She relishes intellectual games, even, or especially, cruel ones. A small woman, age 44, unkempt and usually bundled in black, Holland possesses a razor-sharp eye for the frailties of human nature. When couples make love in her movies, their hopeless groping is more apparent than their pleasure. The act of love is unromantic -- infused, rather, with the certainty and the pain of each individual's ultimate solitude.\n\nTired of being lost, Holland at last hails a passing employee: Which way? What she seeks is the studio where the Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner is polishing the score for Holland's latest cinematic project: \"The Secret Garden,\" her adaptation of the 1909 English children's story by Frances Hodgson Burnett of the awakening of two unloved children, and the regeneration of an embittered man, through the rebirth of an abandoned Yorkshire garden. After \"Europa, Europa\" became the second-highest-grossing German movie ever in the United States (after \"Das Boot\"), winning such prizes as a Golden Globe and a New York Film Critics Award, Warner Brothers approached her with Burnett's tale -- and an $18 million budget. \"The Secret Garden\" marks Holland's first movie made for a major studio with a broad American public in mind. Given the prevailing anguish of Holland's previous work, the film, which contains moments of schmaltz that reek of Hollywood, also represents a radical personal departure: it is a tale with an unambiguously happy ending.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
