For further information on Burnett's life and works, see CLR, Volume 24.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhile fondly remembered as a classic of girl's fiction, Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden (1911) is equally well known for its focus on strong recurring thematic motifs of rebirth and transformation, neatly captured in the symbolic emblem of a lost garden springing to life. Popular for its unlikely focus on a pair of \"difficult\" children who are nonetheless sympathetic, Burnett's novel features a densely structured plot which examines such mature themes as class standing, strained familial relationships, and adolescent growth. The text's open acceptance of disagreeable characters acts as an atypical departure from the other orphan narratives of the same era, such as Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables, Kate Douglas Wiggin's Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, and Eleanor H. Porter's Pollyanna, among others. The subject of a bevy of critical studies, The Secret Garden has remained popular with young female readers since its initial publication, leading to a host of reprintings and reinterpretations in various mediums, including motion pictures, stage musicals, and cartoons.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nBorn on November 24, 1849, in Manchester, England, to Edwin and Eliza Hodgson, Burnett was the eldest of five siblings. Her father initially supported his family by managing a furniture store, but after his death in 1853, Burnett's mother opened a wholesale firm that supplied art materials and hardwares to local textile manufacturers. The economy in Manchester collapsed during the 1860s and, as a result, Burnett's family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where her mother hoped that her brother might provide financial assistance. Unfortunately, upon their arrival, the Hodgsons received little help from their extended family and were forced to live in harsh circumstances. For Burnett, while the continued lack of money was stressful, she nonetheless found the new surroundings a welcome departure from the polluted climate and depressed economy of Manchester. While Burnett had long fancied herself a writer, penning her first poem at the age of seven, in Tennessee she began to submit stories to magazines in hopes of providing supplemental income for her desperate family. Her first published story appeared in Godey's Lady's Book in 1868 and, despite her young age, by 1871, her stories were soon running in several prominent magazines. Tragedy struck the family again with the death of her mother when Burnett was eighteen, forcing her to support herself and her four younger siblings solely on the basis of her growing literary career. Enjoying her increasing reputation and prosperity for the first time, she returned to England for a year-long visit in 1873, where she became more closely acquainted with Swan Burnett, a Tennessee ophthalmologist she had known for several years, ultimately marrying him in September of 1873. Together they had two children, Lionel and Vivian, even as Burnett's literary career began to boom. She released her second novel That Lass o'Lowrie's in 1877. While the novel was well-received and sold well in both America and England, she failed to receive any royalties from the British editions due to the lack of cooperation between the English and American governments over the respective countries' copyright laws. Once again, she found herself under a growing cloud of monetary concern, and the family returned to America after the birth of Vivian. Settling in Washington D.C., where her husband set up a medical practice, Burnett's fortunes began to improve, and she became a well-known figure in Washington's social circles. During this period, Burnett turned to converting her more popular books into stage plays, partially in response to the demand for her works born from several unauthorized English stage productions derived from her novels. However, she remained professionally focused on writing novels for women until the twin voices of Henry James—who in a review of the stage version of Esmeralda suggested her talents would be ideally suited to children's literature—and her son Lionel swayed her to consider writing for younger readers. Already in the process of writing a story called Little Lord Fauntleroy for her children, she agreed to allow it to be serialized in the preeminent children's magazine of the era, St. Nicholas, in 1885. The story proved immensely popular and convinced Burnett to write for children almost exclusively for several years. As Burnett became a best-selling children's author, her new success was balanced out by a series of personal tragedies, including her divorce from her husband and the death of her son Lionel from tuberculosis. In 1900, two years after her divorce became final, Burnett caused a scandal by marrying Stephen Towne-send, ten years her junior, who was a doctor, actor, and writer. However, the marriage was short-lived, and the couple separated in 1902. In 1905 Burnett was finally granted U.S. citizenship. Her later years saw her public support fade despite the late critical and immensely popular success of her last great novel, The Secret Garden, which she released in 1911. She retired into seclusion at her beloved estate in Plandome, New York, where she lived quietly until passing away on October 29, 1924.\n\nPLOT AND MAJOR CHARACTERS\n\nOne of the primary distinctions between Burnett and her contemporaries, which is particularly evident in The Secret Garden, is her willing embrace of unlikely heroes. Burnett biographer Ann Twaite has argued that \"the most original thing about [The Secret Garden] was that its heroine and one of its heroes were both thoroughly unattractive children.\" When the reader is first introduced to Mary Lennox—a young English girl living with her parents in India—she is a spoiled girl prone to tantrums. However, Burnett offers a more complete portrait of Mary's life throughout the text that makes her somewhat churlish nature more understandable. Elizabeth Lennox Keyser has commented that \"[Mary's] mistreatment of the Indian servants, though shocking, seems excusable, since she had an apathetic, invalid father and vain, frivolous father,\" noting further that, \"after her parents' death, [Mary] is passed from one reluctant guardian to another, her suspiciousness seems justified.\" After her parents die suddenly in an epidemic, Mary is sent to live with her only relatives, the Cravens, at Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire, England. In her new setting, the wealthy Mary meets the Sowerby family who help awaken a change in her nature, despite their class differences. Martha works as a maid in the house, and her younger brother Dickon is a free spirit who talks to animals and has an uncanny knack where the natural world is concerned. They become her first friends and allow Mary to see herself as others do. The next stage in her rebirth occurs when Mary rescues a robin who leads her to the titular secret garden. Left to grow wild after the death of the lady of the manor, the garden was ordered closed by the grieving Archibald Craven, Mary's uncle. Mary, with Dickon's help, begins transforming the garden back to its former glory. One night she hears crying and discovers a cousin she never knew she had, Colin, Archibald's son. A naturally sick boy who's convinced he's an invalid, Colin is spoiled, angry, and lonely. Burnett even goes so far as to describe him \"as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.\" Recognizing a kindred spirit—Mary once behaved as Colin did—she shows Colin the garden, and he begins to help with its revitalization. Colin eventually regains his strength, as well as the friendship of Mary, Dickon, and Ben Weatherstaff, a favored caretaker of Colin's mother who had surreptitiously cared for the garden in its mistress's absence. All the plot points coalesce in a climatic resolution where Colin surprises his father with his vitality, everyone is shown the miraculous rebirth of the secret garden, and Colin, Mary, and Archibald complete their respective transformations to create a new family from the ashes of their individual personal tragedies.\n\nMAJOR THEMES\n\nMany scholars have contended that the elements of emotional and spiritual death and rebirth in The Secret Garden were, in large part, inspired by Burnett's conflicting emotions surrounding the death of her son, Lionel, particularly the role of her work in relation to his illness. Elizabeth Lennox Keyser has posited that \"like many successful writers, including Louise May Alcott and Burnett's prolific friend Mrs. Humphry Ward, [who] tried to rationalize her writing as unselfish service, and, when she could not ignore its self-assertive and self-serving role, punished herself with ill health\" and \"chastened her self-assertive female characters.\" The examination of societal roles is another major thematic thread in The Secret Garden. The lives of Colin and Mary are contrasted with that of the Sowerbys, who are their opposites in many respects. Whereas Mary and Colin have all their physical needs met, they still suffer from emotional neglect, whereas the Sowerbys are full of love but are victims of privation. As a sign of their growth, Colin and Mary eventually try to help the Sower-bys's lot in life, the first time they have shown a desire to help others. Further, the book examines the lives of the Cravens' servants and demonstrates a surprising sympathy for their sacrifices and difficulties. For example, the narration notes how the housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, is forced to miss her niece's wedding so that she can instead pick up Mary in London and deliver the girl to Misselthwaite Manor. In so doing, Phyllis Bixler has suggested, \"The Secret Garden avoids glamorizing working-class life by indicating the personal sacrifices of being a wage earner.\" But perhaps the story's greatest thematic element is its dedication to the principal of rebirth and transformation. Ulf Boëthius has argued that the garden of the title is reflective of more than just a powerful setting but a core feature of the story's promise of life, growth, and generation where \"magic accordingly also becomes a moral power. When first Mary and later Colin have been caught up in the rebirth of the garden, they are changed: they become not only stronger and merrier but also less selfish, less spoiled, and more disposed to care about other living creatures.\" In an obvious nod to the overt power of symbolism, Burnett links the rebirth of the garden to the spiritual transformations of Mary, Colin, and Archibald. Bixler has further asserted that Burnett's use of this device is actually borrowed from traditional Cinderella folk tales where \"in some variants of that tale, Cinderella's dead mother aids her through a plant growing on her grave or an animal she had given to Cinderella before she died. Through her portrayal of the secret garden and a robin who lives there, Burnett uses both of these motifs.\"\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nThe Secret Garden has remained popular with critics and readers since its first publication and has inspired several scholarly studies meant to delve deeper into the seemingly obvious symbolism of the garden's rebirth. Adrian Gunther has called the book \"one the great icons of children's literature,\" while Phyllis Bixler has claimed that \"The Secret Garden is also one of the richest, most complex, and most resonant of recognized children's classics.\" However, there has been recurrent criticism among critics, particularly feminist scholars, expressing abiding disappointment in the apparent disappearance of Mary as the central character over the last third of the novel. Indeed, several critics have stated that, in the novel's conclusion, Burnett idealizes Colin at the expense of Mary. Agreeing with this reading, Lissa Paul has commented that \"the story fades from Mary's quest to Colin's,\" thus depicting Mary's \"ultimate defeat.\" This idea that The Secret Garden progresses from a ideal of feminine determination to one of masculine power has occupied the attention of many prominent critics, including Elizabeth Lennox Keyser who has argued that \"Colin, having had the advantage of 'wonderful books and pictures,' is more imaginative than Mary, and as he recovers his health he acquires both extraordinary physical beauty and a charismatic power. At the end of The Secret Garden we see Colin besting Mary in a footrace, and, indeed, he has already run away with, or been allowed to dominate, the final third of the book.\" Keyser has concluded that the book may essentially be \"a defense of patriarchal authority.\" Despite such interpretations of Mary's loss of power, critics such as Adrian Gunther have countered that Mary \"advances so much further along the path of self-discovery than does Colin that we cannot help but experience her as more important. Add to this the fact that what Colin does achieve is predominantly a product of Mary's wisdom and effort rather than his own.\" Shirley Foster and Judy Simons have concurred with this interpretation, asserting that, \"the bulk of the novel focuses not on the achievement of external goals, nor on the acquisition of skills, but on the personal values of sharing, of selflessness and on the healing properties of love.\"\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nJuvenile Works\n\nLittle Lord Fauntleroy (juvenile novel) 1886\n\nEditha's Burglar: A Story for Children (juvenile fiction) 1888\n\nSara Crewe; or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's (juvenile fiction) 1888\n\nPiccino and Other Child Stories [illustrations by Reginald Birch] (juvenile short stories) 1894; published in the United Kingdom as The Captain's Youngest\n\nA Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe, Now Told for the First Time [illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts] (juvenile novel) 1905\n\nRacketty-Packetty House (juvenile fiction) 1906\n\nQueen Silver-Bell (juvenile fiction) 1906; published in the United Kingdom as The Troubles of Queen Silver-Bell\n\nThe Cozy Lion, as Told by Queen Crosspatch [illustrations by Harrison Cady] (juvenile fiction) 1907\n\nThe Good Wolf [illustrations by Harold Sichel] (juvenile fiction) 1908\n\nThe Spring Cleaning, as Told by Queen Crosspatch [illustrations by Harrison Cady] (juvenile fiction) 1908\n\nBarty Crusoe and His Man Saturday (juvenile fiction) 1909\n\nThe Children's Book [editor, with Katherine New-bold Birdsall and Vivian Burnett; illustrations by Harrison Cady and others] (juvenile short stories) 1909\n\nThe Land of the Blue Flower (juvenile fiction) 1909\n\nThe Secret Garden (juvenile novel) 1911\n\nMy Robin [illustrations by Alfred Brennan] (juvenile fiction) 1912\n\nThe Lost Prince [illustrations by Maurice L.

Ann Thwaite, Burnett's biographer, remarks that \"the most original thing about [The Secret Garden ] was that its heroine and one of its heroes were both thoroughly unattractive children.\"2 And Marghanita Laski has written, \"I do not know of any children's book other than The Secret Garden that frankly poses this problem of the introspective unlikeable child in terms that children can understand.\"3 Burnett herself describes Mary Lennox as wondering \"why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be anyone's little girl…. She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that others were, but she did not know that she was so herself\" (p. 12). Unattractive, unlike-able, disagreeable—these are the ways in which the critics and the author herself characterize Mary Lennox and the way in which the critics at least characterize Colin Craven. But I want to examine closely what the term \"disagreeable\" really means in connection with the heroine, Mary, and to distinguish between the ways in which the two children are unattractive or unlikeable.\n\nMary initially \"disagrees\" with the adult characters in the story not only because her looks and manners fail to please them but also because she refuses to accept their authority. From the outset, however, she is by no means \"thoroughly unattractive\" to the narrator, who, in the passage quoted above, conveys sympathy as well as antipathy for Mary by mingling the child's point of view with the omniscient. Nor is Mary \"thoroughly unattractive\" even to the critic who so labels her, for that critic obviously finds a powerful attraction in that very unattractiveness. As the book proceeds, Mary becomes at least moderately agreeable, both to others in the novel and to the narrator, who grants her a grudging approval. But as Mary ostensibly \"improves,\" her role in the book diminishes, and she loses for the reader her main appeal. Instead the other \"thoroughly unattractive\" child, Master Colin, increasingly gains the center of the stage.\n\nColin, I would argue, is never as unattractive to the narrator as Mary, nor is he ever as attractive to the reader. Unlike Mary, who is never described as more than \"almost pretty\" even when she gains flesh and color, Colin, though far more fretful and selfish, is described from the beginning as having a \"sharp, delicate face the color of ivory\" and great black-fringed eyes like those of his dead mother (p. 124). The narrator tells us that Colin, having had the advantage of \"wonderful books and pictures,\" is more imaginative than Mary, and as he recovers his health he acquires both extraordinary physical beauty and a charismatic power. At the end of The Secret Garden we see Colin besting Mary in a footrace, and, indeed, he has already run away with, or been allowed to dominate, the final third of the book.\n\nThe race is not always to the swift, however. Ask an adult what he or she remembers from a childhood reading of The Secret Garden. 4 Memories will differ, of course. But what I remembered before I re-read it recently was Mary's first finding and awakening the garden and then, in a reversal of the \"Sleeping Beauty\" story, her finding and awakening Colin. I remembered Mary exploring the winding paths and gardens within gardens, and indoors the winding corridors with their many locked rooms. And I remembered Mary as stubborn and defiant in her attitude toward adult authority and even toward Colin, but also tender and nurturing. I remembered Colin, too, but always as lying in his room being comforted by Mary or being wheeled by her into the garden. And I remembered his first faltering steps, supported by Mary, but I did not remember his digging, his running, and his calisthenics. And I certainly did not remember his expounding on magic and science. In fact, if my memory serves me, the more conventionally attractive that Colin grew and the more he came to dominate the book, the less memorable both he, and it, became.\n\nBurnett seems to have intended to evoke sympathy for both Mary and Colin while at the same time portraying them as genuinely disagreeable children—children who treat others hatefully and are hated in turn because, having never known love, they feel hatred for themselves. She then apparently meant to show their transformation from self-hating and hateful to loving and lovable through the acquisition of self-esteem. For reasons which I will suggest later, however, Burnett makes Mary too attractive in her disagreeableness and Colin too unattractive in his agreeableness. As Mary becomes less disagreeable, she becomes, after a certain point, less interesting. And Colin, as he becomes more agreeable in some ways, becomes something of a prig and a bore. But before speculating as to why Burnett allows both characters to get out of control, let us consider how Mary, despite—or rather because of—authorial severity, becomes such a compelling figure.\n\nAn early example of Mary's unpleasantness earns her the nickname \"Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.\" As a little boy named Basil watches Mary \"making heaps of earth and paths for a garden,\" he suggests that they make a rockery. She spurns his offer, but what strikes us is not so much Mary's ill temper at what she takes to be his interference as her attempt, literally and metaphorically, to make something grow from barren ground. Although the narrator later tells us that Mary is less imaginative than Colin, we, having witnessed her persistent efforts to bring forth life, tend to disbelieve the narrator or at least to question her use of the word imagination. True, Mary must overcome the distrustfulness that makes her contrary with well-meaning people like Basil. And she succeeds by admitting first Dickon and then Colin to her secret garden. After admitting Dickon, she tells him about the incident with Basil. He replies, in characteristic fashion, \"There doesn't seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like\" (p. 108). But Dickon is, in some respects, more naive than Mary, who knows there is more to the world than flowers and friendly wild things. Sometimes, as it was for Mary in India, contrariness is necessary for self-preservation; and sometimes, as for Mary in England, it is even necessary for self-renewal.5\n\nWe can sympathize with Mary even though she is not a \"nice sympathetic child\" in part because of the deprivation she has endured. Her mistreatment of the Indian servants, though shocking, seems excusable, since she has been left almost entirely to their care by an apathetic, invalid father and a vain, frivolous mother. When, after her parents' death, she is passed from one reluctant guardian to another, her suspiciousness seems justified. And when, on arriving at Misselthwaite Manor, she overhears the housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, being warned to keep her out of her uncle's sight and confined to her own two rooms, we can understand why Mary \"perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life\" (p. 23). Yet while we can see that Mary's unhappiness gives rise to her naughtiness,6 the narrator, by saying that Mary never belonged to anyone because she was a disagreeable child, implies that the reverse is true. In fact, the narrator's refusal to intervene on behalf of Mary, as she does on behalf of Colin, forces us into the position of defending her ourselves.\n\nIf Mary's contrariness consisted of mere sullenness, we might agree with the narrator and the adult characters' assessment of her. But there is, as I have suggested, a positive side to her contrariness, which is supported by other characters in the book as well. On her first morning at Misselthwaite, Mary awakens to find the servant Martha in her room. There had been no reciprocity in Mary's relationship with her Indian servants. She could verbally, and even physically, abuse her ayah with impunity. On meeting Martha, however, Mary wonders how she would react to being slapped. Something tells her that Martha would slap her right back. Sure enough, when Mary calls her a \"daughter of a pig,\" as she was wont to insult her ayah, Martha reproves her. The way Martha reacts to and affects Mary resembles the way in which Mary later reacts to and affects Colin. When Martha forces Mary to make at least some effort to dress herself, the narrator comments: \"If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic\" (p. 30). When Mary later tells Colin that she hates him and contradicts him when, in a bid for her pity, he says he feels a lump on his back, the narrator similarly comments: \"A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things\" (p. 175). But in fact both the untrained Yorkshire rustic and \"savage little Mary\" have a salutary effect on those who are used to being coddled, and the ironic treatment of Mary's antitypes—the well-trained maid, the fine young lady, and the nice sympathetic child—suggests both the author's need to condemn plainspokenness and her even stronger desire to condone it.\n\nMartha insists that the reluctant Mary play out-of-doors, where she meets another character whose contrariness matches her own. Ben Weatherstaff, the crusty gardener, \"had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her 'quite contrary' expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him\" (p. 34). But when Mary mentions a robin and Ben describes how it was abandoned by its parents, she is able for the first time to recognize and admit her own loneliness. Like Martha, Ben Weather-staff is given to plainspokenness. He says to Mary: \"We was wove out of th' same cloth. We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant\" (p. 40). Mary is taken aback and contrasts him, like Martha, with the native servants who always \"salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did.\" But Ben's bluntness, too, helps Mary both to know herself and to see herself as others see her.\n\nDickon, with his intuitive understanding of nature, and his mother, with her equally wonderful understanding of human nature, not only aid Mary but also counter the asperity of the narrator toward her. But in doing justice to Dickon and his mother, one tends to forget that it is Ben who befriends the robin, whose plight was analogous to Mary's and Colin's, and that it is Ben who kept the garden alive during the ten years it was locked up. It is also Ben who, along with Martha, piques Mary's curiosity about the garden but refuses to satisfy it, thus arousing by his contrariness all her stubborn determination to seek it out. And during the time that Mary searches for an entrance to the garden, Ben and Martha provide her with the insights necessary to appreciate her eventual discovery. In the chapter in which Mary finds the key, Martha forces Mary to consider the possibility that perhaps she does not really like herself. In the chapter in which Mary finds the gate, Martha, with her gift of a skipping-rope, persuades Mary that she is likeable and that she, in turn, is capable of liking others. Thus encouraged, Mary actively seeks and gains Ben's approval, so that by the time \"the robin shows the way,\" Ben and Martha have already helped her find the key to her own heart.\n\nContrariness then, of the kind that Mary gradually loses, originates in sourness, irritability, an unwillingness to be interested or pleased. But the kind of contrariness that Mary retains, at least until Colin comes to dominate the book, arises from emotional honesty and reliance on one's own judgment.7 Mary finds both the garden and Colin largely because \"she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things\" (p. 66) Despite repeated denials by Martha that Mary hears crying in the night, and despite repeated warnings from Mrs. Medlock against exploring the house, Mary continues to believe the evidence of her own senses and to search for the source of the cries she hears. What she finds is a boy very similar to herself. Like Mary, Colin has been rejected by his father and has become used to overhearing terrible things about himself, many of which he now believes. Even more than Mary, he has become a tyrant to those who are paid to wait on him. Given everything he ever requested, never forced to do what he didn't wish, he is the object of pity but also of dislike and disgust. But because Mary has also played the tyrant out of misery, acting the little ranee to her ayah, and because she is not afraid to impose her will on others, she is able to do for Colin what no doctor or even Dickon can.\n\nMary not only encourages Colin to believe that he can live; she persuades him that he need not live as a chronic invalid. In order to do so Mary must oppose her contrariness to Colin's own and act in a way not \"nice\" by conventional standards. When Colin unjustly accuses Mary of neglecting him, she becomes angry but, after reflection, relents. When she awakens to hear Colin in hysterics, however, she becomes enraged at the way her emotions, and those of everyone else in the house, are being manipulated. In expressing to Colin what no nice child would say or, according to the narrator, even feel—namely, that Colin is an emotional rather than a physical cripple whose self-centeredness has made him an object of contempt and loathing—Mary is actually expressing what everyone, including the reader, is feeling or would feel in similar circumstances. Her \"savagery,\" as the narrator calls it, her ability to set aside the civilized veneer which has thinly disguised everyone else's hostility towards Colin, has a purgative effect on the entire household. And by disclosing what the nurse and doctor have long known but feared to say, that Colin is only weak from lying in bed and indulging in self-pity, Mary relieves him of his morbid fear and sets him on the road to recovery.\n\nGradually, with Mary's and Dickon's help, Colin gains enough strength to enter the garden. But although Dickon plants the suggestion that Colin will one day be able to walk, it is plain-spoken Ben Weatherstaff who brings him to his feet. Like Mary, Weather-staff will express the unmentionable thoughts in everyone's minds: on finding the children in the secret garden, he blurts out, \"But tha'rt th' poor cripple\" (p. 222). And he is condemned as \"ignorant\" and \"tactless\" (p. 223) just as Mary is castigated for being \"savage\" and not \"nice.\" But his bluntness also has a salutary effect on Colin. \"The strength which Colin usually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now in a new way…. His anger and insulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him with a power he had never known before, an almost unnatural strength\" (p. 223). Though \"magic\" later enables him to run and perform calisthenics, it is his passionate desire to refute Ben that enables him to take his first steps.\n\nAfter watching Colin stand and walk, and after examining his legs, Ben decides that Colin, far from being \"th' poor cripple,\" \"'lt make a mon yet\" (p. 224). From that point on Colin's athletic prowess, his leadership ability, his interest in science, and his magical powers all seem meant to prove Ben right. In the early chapters the narrator often reminded us of Mary's unattractiveness and unpleasantness; now she stresses Colin's beauty and charisma. At one point the narrator intervenes to tell us that Colin \"was somehow a very convincing sort of boy,\" and it is doubtless this convincing quality that is meant to convince us of Colin's ascendancy over Ben, Dickon, and even Mary. Whereas earlier Colin had been a peevish little tyrant, he now becomes a benevolent despot, a combination rajah and priest. Colin, \"fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations,\" arranges the group cross-legged in a circle under a tree which makes \"a sort of temple\" (p. 241). Later Colin heads the rajah's procession \"with Dickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the 'creatures' trailed after them\" (p. 243). It has been argued that \"in this Eden, nature dissolves class—gardner and Pan-boy share the broadly human vocation of nursing the invalid boy to straight health.\"8 These doings in the garden, however, suggest a definite hierarchy, one that includes sex as well as class.\n\nDuring Colin's lectures, \"Mistress Mary\" is described as feeling \"solemnly enraptured\" and listening \"entranced\" (pp. 241-42). Although we are doubtless meant to be as charmed by Colin as the other characters are and to see in his domination of the little group the promise of his future manhood, we are in fact disenchanted to find Mary little more than a worshipful Huck to the antics of Colin's Tom Sawyer. Yet Mary and Huck are the truly imaginative and convincing children who do not, like Colin and Tom, need the stimulus of books in order to have real adventures and solve real problems. Huck's escape from Pap and his flight down the river with Jim, Mary's discoveries of Colin and the garden, and, above all, her self-discoveries, make Tom's \"evasion\" and Colin's \"magic\" anticlimactic. And just as Jim loses stature because of the indignities inflicted on him by Tom, so the roles of Martha and Ben Weatherstaff, so important to Mary's development, diminish. Martha, as remarkable in her way as Dickon and their mother, simply disappears from the final chapters; but since she is the first person for whom Mary feels anything like trust and affection, it is hard to believe that Mary would forget her. Ben, like Mrs. Sowerby a party to the secret in the garden, is treated condescendingly by Colin—and by the author. When Ben makes a joke at the expense of Colin's \"scientific discoveries,\" Colin snubs him, a snub which Ben—acting out of character—takes humbly (p. 245). But at least at the end of Twain's book we are left with its true hero. In The Secret Garden Burnett shifts from Mary's to Colin's point of view shortly after the scene in which Mary confronts him with his cowardice and hypochondria. From there on Mary slips into the background until she disappears entirely from the final chapter. The novel ends with the master of Misselthwaite and his son, Master Colin, crossing the lawn before their servants' admiring eyes.\n\nPerhaps the analogy between Mary and Huck can do more than suggest why the final third of The Secret Garden is so unsatisfying. Huck is a memorable, even magical, creation not only because he is a very convincing boy (so is Tom, for that matter), but because he is, at the same time, unconventional. He resists being civilized in a way that Tom, for all his infatuation with outlaws, does not. Mary, too, is a more memorable creation than Colin because she is both recognizably human and refreshingly different. Thwaite and Laski have tried to link this difference with her unpleasantness, but I believe it lies more in her freedom from sex-role stereotypes.9 (This, of course, is why girls have always found Jo March so appealing, especially in Part 1 of Little Women.)\n\nFrom the first Mary is an independent, self-contained, yet self-assertive child. Unlike Colin, she discovers and enters the secret garden all by herself, and she defies adult authority in order to find, befriend, and liberate Colin. Unlike her mother, she is never vain of her appearance; she is proud when she finds herself getting plump, rosy, and glossy-haired, but only because these are signs of her growing strength. When she receives a present from Mr. Craven, she is delighted to find books rather than dolls, and she works and exercises in the garden along with Colin and Dickon. She does not wish to have a nurse or governess but seems to thrive on an active life out-of-doors. Early in the relationship with Colin she is the leader, and even when he is able to run about, it is she who, on a rainy day, suggests that they explore his house. Colin, when we first meet him, is a hysterical invalid, and his father, as the name \"Craven\" signifies, is a weak and cowardly man, still mourning after ten years his dead wife and, in doing so, neglecting their living son. It is as though Burnett so generously endowed Mary at the expense of Colin and his father that she had to compensate for it by stressing Mary's disagreeable traits and exaggerating Colin's charm. And in the final chapter Colin's ascendancy suggests that if he becomes a \"mon,\" as Ben predicts, then Mary will have to become a woman—quiet, passive, subordinate, and self-effacing. Huck at the end of Huckleberry Finn cannot escape civilization; Mary cannot escape the role that civilization has assigned her.\n\nBurnett's ambivalence toward Mary and her indulgence of Colin probably reflect lifelong conflicts. As a child Burnett was encouraged by her widowed mother to cultivate genteel and ladylike manners. And as a young married woman she is described by Thwaite as \"obviously trying her best … to appear as the nineteenth century's ideal of womanhood\" (p. 52). Often, especially during these early years, Burnett regarded her writing as a necessary, even sacrificial task, performed for the sake of her husband, struggling to establish himself as an ophthalmologist, and their sons. Yet Burnett continued to write long after Dr. Swan Burnett was well able to support his family. By then, however, writing, and the fame and fortune which attended it, seems to have become a psychological necessity. Her favorite image of herself was that of a fairy godmother, and the power as well as the magnanimity of that role must have appealed to her. So like many successful women writers, including Louisa May Alcott and Burnett's prolific friend Mrs. Humphry Ward, she tried to rationalize her writing as unselfish service, and, when she could not ignore its self-assertive and self-serving role, punished herself with ill health. And finally, again like other women writers (great ones such as the Brontës and George Eliot as well as minor ones such as Alcott and Ward), she chastened her self-assertive female characters.10\n\nThe Secret Garden, written in 1911 toward the end of a long, successful career, seems to suggest not only self-condemnation and self-punishment in its treatment of Mary but an attempted reparation for wrongs Burnett may have felt she inflicted on the males closest to her. Most obviously, the idealized Colin seems to represent her elder son, Lionel, and his recovery a wish-fulfilling revision of what actually happened. After the extraordinary success of Little Lord Fauntleroy in 1886, Burnett began to spend much of each year abroad. Although she was a doting mother, able from her earnings to give her sons whatever their hearts desired, she may have felt that even these luxuries, like those Colin's father provides for him, could not compensate for her absence. And when, during one of these absences, Lionel became consumptive, her guilt must have been intensified. To assuage it she nursed Lionel devotedly and especially prided herself on protecting him from the knowledge that he was dying.11 But in a notebook entry, written a few months after Lionel's death, she asks: \"Did I do right to hide from you that you were dying? It seemed to me that I must not give you the terror of knowing.\"12 The situation in The Secret Garden is significantly reversed: Colin is kept in ignorance not of his imminent death but of his capacity for life; Mary, by breaking the conspiracy of silence, enables him to live.\n\nThe figure of Colin is reminiscent not only of Lionel but also of Swan Burnett and of Mrs. Burnett's second husband, Stephen Townesend. Swan, himself crippled in his youth, became a successful eye specialist, but the marriage seems never to have been a happy one. Two years after their divorce, Burnett married Townesend, a doctor and aspiring actor ten years younger than herself. Burnett had long attempted to use her theatrical connections to further his acting career, especially after Townesend helped her to nurse Lionel through his fatal illness. As her son Vivian wrote: \"This was one of the few solaces that Dearest had in her dark hours, making her feel that surely some good had come out of her wish to help her older—disappointed—Stephen boy.\"13 And as Burnett wrote to her friend Kitty Hall, \"If I had done no other one thing in my life but help Lionel to die as he did, I should feel as if I ought to be grateful to God for letting me live to do it—but if I can help Stephen to live, that will be another beautiful thing to have done.\"14 As these quotations suggest, Burnett's interest in Stephen Townesend was largely maternal, a desire to play fairy godmother as she had in the lives of her sons. To use her fortune and influence to aid a struggling young man would somehow justify her possession of it. But although Stephen, unlike Lionel, survived, she never succeeded in helping either him or their marriage to \"live.\"\n\nThus The Secret Garden, far from combining \"the ideal remembered holiday in a golden age … with a classless, reasonable, and joyous Utopia for the future,\" reflects its author's ambivalence about sex roles.15 On the one hand, she vindicates Mary's self-assertiveness and her own career by allowing Mary to bring the garden, Colin, and, eventually, Mr. Craven back to life. On the other hand, she chastens herself and Mary by permitting the narrator to intervene only to reprove her and by making her subordinate to Colin in the final chapters of the book. By idealizing Colin at the expense of Mary she seems to be affirming male supremacy, and the final version of the master of Misselthwaite with his son, Master Colin, further suggests a defense of patriarchal authority. While Mr. Craven can be seen as the neglectful, erring parent of either sex—and thus still another means by which Burnett atones for her material failings—he, like the peevish invalid Colin, can also be viewed as an expression of her impatience with male weakness. And her attempts to glorify Colin are unsuccessful enough to make us wonder if even here her ambivalence—even her resentment and hostility—does not show through. For all her efforts to make Mary disagreeable and to efface her, Mary remains a moving and memorable creation, whereas Colin's \"magic\" never amounts to more than a mere trick. Mary, like the author herself, seems to have both gained and lost from her contrariness, and The Secret Garden succeeds and fails accordingly.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Gohlke, in \"Re-reading The Secret Garden,\" College English, 41 (1980), 894-902, insists that The Secret Garden withstands the test of adult rereading. On subjecting the book to the same test, however, I find that only the part I remember most vividly from childhood—that in which Mary predominates—meets my adult criteria.\n\n5. When the cholera epidemic strikes the Lennox compound, Mary is the only one who neither flees nor dies. In the midst of death and destruction she remains calm and self-possessed, partly out of ignorance, of course, but largely out of toughness. Burnett tells us that \"as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself\" (p. 8). It is this self-absorption that insulates her from fear during the epidemic and from desolation on learning of her parents' death.\n\n6. Clarissa M.

In \"Little Girls without Their Curls,\" pp. 14-31, U. C. Knoepflmacher argues that the guise of fantasy enables Juliana Ewing, in \"Amelia and the Dwarfs,\" and Burnett herself, in \"Behind the White Brick,\" to indulge more fully a wish for female aggression in defiance of Victorian taboos than is possible in a realistic fiction such as The Secret Garden. I would argue, however, that because less \"anarchic,\" Mary's aggressiveness or contrariness, at least that which she retains until Colin comes to dominate the book, has more social value than that of Amelia or Jem/Baby and thus her \"domestication\" represents a loss rather than a gain.\n\n8.

Another interesting topic for exploration would be Burnett's use of the Brontë novels in her children's fiction. The Yorkshire setting of The Secret Garden, of course, resembles that of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, but Mary has elements of Jane Eyre and both Catherines, Dickon resembles a more benign little Heathcliff, and Colin seems a blend of Rochester, Linton Heathcliff, and Hareton Earnshaw.

Washington, D.C.: Beacham Publishing, Inc., 1990.\n\n[In the following essay, Groner offers an introduction to the narrative and symbolic aspects of The Secret Garden.]\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett was born Frances Eliza Hodgson on November 24, 1849, in Manchester, England. In 1865 the family's ironmongery failed, triggering the Hodgsons' move to Knoxville, Tennessee. Burnett began writing to supplement the family income, and by the time she was twenty, she was writing and publishing as many as six short stories a month in a wide array of potboiler magazines. Soon Burnett's work was accepted by established magazines such as Scribner's and Harper's; her commercial success financed the first of many trips to England. In 1873, back in Tennessee, she married Dr. Swan Burnett, a prominent physician. Burnett, however, was unhappy in Tennessee and persuaded one of her editors to advance her enough money to move to Paris with her husband and young son, Lionel, in 1874.\n\nReturning to the United States in 1877, Burnett published her first novel, That Lass o'Lowrie's, a story about miners in Lancashire. A tremendous success both in America and in England, the novel was adapted for the stage, the first of fifteen dramatizations of Burnett's fiction. Burnett became well known as she wrote and published adult fiction almost incessantly over the next six years. In 1883 Henry James, in a review of the London production of her play Esmeralda, suggested that Burnett's style and moral focus would make her a good children's writer. At this time Burnett was actually writing Little Lord Fauntleroy. Although originally written solely for her two sons' entertainment, the book was serialized by the magazine St. Nicholas in 1885. This novel, in part a portrait of her own sons, proved so successful that Burnett continued writing for young people as well as adults until her death in Plandome, New York, on October 29, 1924.\n\nOverview\n\nAlthough The Secret Garden depicts the dismal effects of a loveless home, its goal is to show how nature, coupled with positive thinking, can transform people's lives. The central characters, Mary and Colin, initially seem to be spoiled, mean-spirited, and completely self-absorbed characters. Although they do not recognize their own emotional emptiness, they are both hungry for affection and companionship. The novel concerns itself with the process of Mary and Colin's awakening to the world, other people, and their own feelings. In many ways the story has the texture of a fairy tale: the magical effects of a special and secret place save the children. However, the story is more satisfying than a fairy tale because Burnett's characters evolve into caring, sensitive beings through their own efforts, demonstrating that people are capable of changing their lives for the better.\n\nSetting\n\nThe story begins in colonial India, where Mary Lennox lives with her mother and father. When Mary's parents die, the scene shifts to Misselthwaite manor, the Yorkshire home of Mary's reclusive uncle, with whom she has been sent to live. At Misselthwaite, Mary discovers a garden that her uncle has kept locked up and abandoned for ten years, ever since his wife suffered a fatal injury there. The garden has run wild and is choked with dead or dying weeds and grasses. Mary decides to make the garden her secret place and begins to try to revive it.\n\nThemes and Characters\n\nMary Lennox and Colin Craven, the two main characters in The Secret Garden, are cousins but psychologically resemble twins. Both have been effectively orphaned—Mary by her parents' death, and Colin by his mother's death and father's subsequent abandonment. Brought up by servants who dislike and fear them, the two are unruly, nasty children, prone to temper tantrums whenever they do not get their way. The servants, however, meet only the children's physical needs and desires; they do not satisfy their need for love and affection. Without being aware of it, Mary and Colin are exceedingly lonely, isolated, and frightened that life will continue to bring them no genuine, lasting joy.\n\nMary, however, begins to understand herself and her needs when she is brought to the home of her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, and must learn how to dress and care for herself. Having no peers or playthings, Mary comes to identify with the craggy, angry gardener, Ben Weather staff, as well as with a robin who has been abandoned by his nest mates. She recognizes for the first time that she has always been lonely, yet she does not know how to bridge her isolation. With the robin's help she discovers the dying secret garden, and, because it too has been abandoned, Mary becomes determined to restore the garden to its former loveliness. The act of reviving the garden restores Mary's physical strength, and she is gradually transformed into a vibrant, healthy, happy young woman capable of looking beyond herself.\n\nColin does not appear until almost halfway through the novel, when Mary discovers him hiding from the world in his room. Colin's mother died in childbirth after a tree branch in the garden struck her and forced her into premature labor. Unable to recover from the shock and grief of her death, Mr. Craven has become reclusive and avoids seeing his son. Although he does not consciously wish Colin any harm, he cannot see him without remembering his deceased wife. Colin fears that he will develop a hunchback and die. A hysterical, angry young man who has been deeply hurt by his father's unthinking rejection, Colin needs companionship; he needs to learn how to love and be loved, and he needs to learn how to help himself. Mary, recognizing much of herself in Colin, forces him to see that there is nothing physically wrong with him except the debilitation brought on by spending most of his life in bed. Lashing out at him with her own very violent temper, she challenges him to recover and introduces him to the secret garden.\n\nDickon, the housemaid Martha's younger brother, is the exact opposite of Mary and Colin. A static character, he offers unqualified acceptance to the two troubled children and thus helps them grow. He has an uncanny, almost supernatural ability with wild animals and nature, drawing squirrels, rabbits, foxes, and lambs to his side by playing his pipes. A Yorkshire lad, he is at one with nature and at peace with himself. He has no doubts, no fears, no feelings of isolation, and no selfishness. Innately kind, he provides Mary and Colin with the first positive, nurturing friendship they have ever experienced. Dickon's character gently reinforces the novel's themes of rebirth and redemption through nature, and helps make The Secret Garden a novel of hope and joy fulfilled.\n\nLiterary Qualities\n\nAlthough The Secret Garden has many of the characteristics of a fairy tale, its most elemental symbol is rooted not in fantasy but in nature. The abandoned garden's rebirth parallels the rebirth of Mary and Colin. Like them, it has been left to die of neglect, yet it still has the seeds—albeit hidden and buried—that will allow it to flower and grow if only someone will nurture it. As the garden grows, so too do the children who work there. Once the garden is revived, the children come to recognize its tremendous strength and power. Although they label this power \"magic,\" they recognize that magic works \"best when you work yourself.\" They sing hymns and chant incantations in the joyous knowledge that they, too, share in and help perpetuate the miracle of life.\n\nSymbolically, Burnett draws on an old pastoral literary tradition that transforms the garden into a substitute, benign mother. The garden nurtures the children by offering them a safe, secluded spot in which to learn how to care for themselves and others. Indeed, the children spend approximately nine months—spring, summer, and fall—hidden behind the protective walls of the garden before they emerge triumphant.\n\nThe Secret Garden 's tightly unified plot is controlled by the changing seasons, allowing the rebirth of both the garden and the children to take place smoothly and cohesively. Burnett also makes good use of dialogue: Colin's and Mary's increasing use of Dickon's Yorkshire dialect vividly illustrates the young pair's growth as they learn to see the world through their friend's eyes. Ultimately, the characters' growth and their ability to transform their lives makes this novel a story of redemption.\n\nSocial Sensitivity\n\nSome readers may be disturbed by Burnett's sentimentalizing of poverty and the class system, but her portrayal does not lack sensitivity. As Mary and Colin grow healthier, they learn what it means to be physically hungry and unable to satisfy their needs. For the first time, they understand how difficult it must be for Dickon's mother, Mrs. Sowerby, to feed her twelve children. When she sends them milk and freshly baked bread, they feel genuine gratitude, but they also recognize the cost to all of the Sowerbys. No longer are the two children oblivious to the needs of those less fortunate than themselves, and they find a way to help the Sowerbys in return.\n\nThe novel demonstrates that everyone needs love and understanding, but it stresses that these must be given in order to be received. The lessons the children learn—to care for others, to work to make others happy, and to understand the pain of others' lives—make The Secret Garden a sensitive and strong novel.\n\nJerry Phillips (essay date December 1993)\n\nSOURCE: Phillips, Jerry. \"The Mem Sahib, the Worthy, the Rajah and His Minions: Some Reflections on the Class Politics of The Secret Garden.\" Lion and the Unicorn 17, no. 2 (December 1993): 168-94.\n\n[In the following essay, Phillips studies the legacy of British colonialism in India through an analysis of class structures and sociological politics in The Secret Garden, particularly with regards to Mary Lennox's experiences as an \"Anglo-Indian orphan.\"]\n\nIntroduction: The Empire's Homecoming1\n\nThe preeminent influence on twentieth-century British society has arguably been the decline of the British Empire. For over three hundred years, the construction and maintenance of the imperial system provoked themes which reverberated at every level of the British polity—that is to say, it set limits, effective cultural parameters, on what it was and what it meant in terms of lived experienced to be British in relation to foreigners from the four corners of the globe. Empire—and the perennial desire for its enlargement—is massively implicated in the historical and political categories whose overlapping constitutes the ground for interrogating the British story of modernity. Chief among these categories are the organization of material interests and forces around mercantilism, finance, and industry; the development of a powerful and far-reaching military; the establishment of a bureaucratic state and \"disciplinary\" political culture to define and administer law and order, rights and obligations, the necessity of work and patterns of acceptable play; and, finally, the generation of an ideology of the national culture, and its concomitant bounded identity. Clearly, the British Empire was not the sole cause of any one of these historical trajectories, but its pervasive influence is detectable in all of them. Thus, the end of empire has had significant consequences on a number of fronts, ranging from the macroeconomic to the micropolitical.\n\nFor example, as the high tide of imperial ideology has receded, it has left behind a social landscape strewn with murky controversies concerning citizenship, ancestry, race, and the law.2 At this moment of writing, British immigration legislation expresses a political will to deny certain groups of British subjects the right of citizenship and ergo the right of residence (e.g., Hong Kong Chinese); at the same time, the door is kept open (or at least unlocked) for those foreign nationals whose cultural profile is ideologically acceptable (e.g., South Africans of English descent). This deliberate inequity can only be understood in relation to a fundamental historical impasse, a vexed and sometimes vicious legacy: the diverse racial make-up of the former British Empire and the existing Commonwealth. Race alone has turned the notion of Britishness upside down and inside out. Where the empire was \"an extension of the English nationality\" (John Robert Seeley qtd. in Bennet 273), postcolonial nationalism has sought to contain national identity within an implacable existential frame. The paradoxical result is that Britishness has simply exploded into a speculative politics about whether or not nationality can be defined as an ethnic or legal identity, a language or language of values, a cultural state of mind or an essential state of being. British-ness has been invested with differential racial, legal, moral, cultural, and political value; it has become a signifier with overdetermined significance. In short, where imperial certainty once ruled, ideological uncertainty has gained apace.\n\nThe open-endedness of the debate about British identity throws brilliant light upon the enduring legacy of empire—the way it returns home, what might be called its blowback effect. I borrow the term \"blow-back\" from espionage jargon, in which it refers to \"unexpected—and negative—effects at home that result from … operations overseas\" (Simpson 5). The return of the imperial program inevitably establishes a critical dialogue with the domestic institutions of \"the mother country,\" the same institutions that promoted the program in the first place. The effect can often be unsettling, nowhere more so than in the field of social class. The measure of social class is a powerful analytic tool for prising open the ideological secrets of nation building and national self-regulation. Class allows us to appreciate the political meaning of blowback; through a reading of class, we can detect the cultural impact of the end of empire on how elites control their subordinates at home.\n\nThe concern of this essay can be summarized thus: if one form of empire—colonialism—is the great program of extending home away from home, then what happens when the program collapses and how does the mother country cope when the colonies have to return home? This cardinal question guides my reading of the narrative poetics and politics of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden (1911). A central text in the canon of children's literature, The Secret Garden is not so much a discourse on the end of empire as an embryonic commentary on the possibility of blowback.\n\nThe Allegorical Inference\n\nIdeological extrapolations play a major role in my reading of The Secret Garden. The political discourse of the text has an unusually rich relationship to that which is \"not said\" or only partially expressed. Insofar as the silences and the stutters run concurrently with clear ideological statements, the narrative demands a speculative reading, a symptomatic critique that respects hybrid patterns. Such criticism is dedicated to what I shall call the allegorical inference.\n\nAllegorical inferences in no way cheapen the text. Indeed, they heighten the sense of the trickster that is narrative. As an aesthetic intervention into the political status quo, literary narrative orders layer upon layer of ideological values; some of these values are known, others are well-kept secrets, which run into one another like different colored threads in a weave. A dramatic investigation of significant social priorities, the allegorical inference comments on the influential power of partial truths, the natural province of ideology. Reductive arguments—overstated \"deep\" analyses—always cheat on the richness of cultural themes; thus, vulgar Marxism and Freudianism eschew those aspects of the text that do not play into their respective critical agendas. The allegorical inference arises from the crossover or overlap of discrete ideological values. In my reading of The Secret Garden, the concept addresses the promotion of social fantasy through an aesthetic of Utopia; the reissue of a colonial lingua franca in a domestic setting; the celebration of romantic ideals of nature and the self; the consolidation of patriarchal imperatives; and, finally, the proclamation of a discourse of social engineering having to do with the physical and spiritual well being of the average child. As demonstrated by the range of issues involved, the textuality of The Secret Garden must be seen as a veritable ideological riot. The approach of the allegorical inference seeks to realize the complex motives of these discourses involved in the riotous action.\n\n\"India Is Quite Different from Yorkshire\"\n\nBarrackpore is, I see, to save me from India … a charming place, like a beautiful English villa on the banks of the Thames—so green and fresh.\n\n—Emily Auckland\n\nMary Lennox's passage from India to Yorkshire is best understood as a kind of pilgrimage—a homecoming to an ideal space and place of values she has always known but never seen. Her relationship to Yorkshire, to England generally, is typical of a child whose parents serve the British Empire as colonial settlers, government agents, military personnel, or otherwise. Mary is Anglo-Indian—born in India of English parentage. She grows up accustomed to the reality of India but attuned to the spirit of England, culturally, linguistically, and ethically. Mary identifies with England, but India is all she has known; in other words, she lives in India, but John Bull inhabits her soul. The cultural fashioning of colonial children, to be sure, is beset with ironies, ambiguities, and schizophrenic desires about \"the pleasures of exile\" and the lure of \"back home.\" The mother country defines her manners, her values, her social position, and her racial identity, and yet, is still only a partial truth of her day-to-day reality. The glorious garden called England, is near and far, everywhere and nowhere.3\n\nThis is the peculiar dynamic, the maddening dialectic, that we find operative in Emily Auckland's statement. To Emily, the quintessential Mem Sahib, Barrackpore is \"charming\" to the extent that it reminds her of \"a beautiful English villa on the banks of the Thames.\" The resemblance, however, is more than fanciful, it is also purposeful in that it lessens or even negates what is unacceptable and intolerable about the Indian scene generally. Barrackpore, the little island of England in the midst of India, is less important for itself than for the memory of home that it triggers. In this way, the best parts of India become copies of English ideals; the copy, the recycled image, saves the colonist from having to face India in the raw. In other words, one aspect of India—its similarity to a certain English setting—is used to block off experience of the whole. The confusion of values and desires registered here is typical of the Anglo-Indian predicament.\n\nThe Secret Garden uses a shock tactic to seize the attention of the reader. Swiftly, almost brutally, the opening pages of the novel remove the ground from beneath Mary's feet; a wave of cholera kills her parents and evacuates their household. Mary is left \"all alone … in a deserted bungalow\" (10). Burnett uses the omnipotent, deadly power of the writer to turn her character into an orphan, dependent on the good will of strangers and the hospitality of relatives. In the construction of the orphan, I detect a generic value, which yields the possibility of an allegorical inference.\n\nFrom Jane Eyre to Oliver Twist and from David Copperfield to Heathcliff, child orphans are key figures in the world of nineteenth-century narrative. The figure of the child orphan was typically a critical ideological commentary on provocative issues of class and gender and the attendant discourses on power and justice, propriety and unfreedom. In fine, the orphan figured as a metaphor for the instability of identity, the crisis of representation, in certain social relations. For instance, the character of Jane Eyre is a powerful critique of the patriarchal will to typify and control the identity of itinerant and indigent young women.\n\nIn the bestowal of an orphan's fate to Mary Lennox, The Secret Garden pays homage to the fundamental concern of much nineteenth-century fiction: the displaced person within. Yet, in another way, the text asks many difficult questions about a figure who might well be the index of our troubled modernity: the migrant, the refugee, the exile—the displaced person without. In this century of great travels, the fortune of nations—the rise and fall of hegemonic economic powers—has led to an unprecedented cultural mix of ethnicities and races and cultures and religions throughout every continent of the globe. Thus, the displaced person without, the stranger in search of a home, is an awesome reflection on problems of social identity in the contemporary world. A few of these problems can be reached through the principle of the allegorical inference in The Secret Garden.\n\nMary Lennox is an English child born, and raised to nine years old, far from England's shores. Her predicament is testing, beguiling; she is a foreigner who leaves home, which is not home, and returns, in a manner of speaking, to a native land she has never actually known. Little wonder, then, that the confusion of cultural values, which is the ideology of British colonialism, radically disorients Mary's sense of place in the world. The children of the English clergyman taunt Mary because she has to ask, \"where is home?\" They know that \"home\" is \"England, of course\" (8-9). Mary's failure to recognize her true point of origin eloquently conveys the double bind she is caught in: England is the home of meaning in her world, and yet the notion of \"home\" seems meaningless. The meaning of homelessness is crucial to the class politics of blowback. For the great ideological issue inherent in the literary discourse of the child orphan is, of course, the crucial and exorbitant question of assimilation—how is it to be done and is it desirable? The Secret Garden is a relentlessly complex meditation on just this issue.\n\nAt the center of The Secret Garden is an anatomy of social hierarchy, a laboratory of class relations: the great country house. The trope of the great house is a mainstay of Victorian fiction, particularly the gothic romance with its heightened interest in declining aristocracy. The gothic romance enabled prose fiction to delve into sexual, religious, psychological, and political controversies—\"deep\" troublesome areas that social realism, for one reason or another, would often balk at or avoid. In the initial characterization of Misselthwaite Manor, the great house in which Mary is to reside, the action of the text is placed on the edges of a gothic stage. En route to England, Mary learns that her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, \"lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him…. He's a hunchback and he's horrid\" (9). On Mary's arrival in the mother country, Mrs. Medlock, the housekeeper, gives her a description of the house itself: \"a grand big old place in a gloomy sort of way…. The house is six hundred years old, and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near to a hundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked. And there's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there for ages\" (13). Although Mr. Craven is a victim of rumor and the target of much exaggeration, the basic tenet of the gossip is valid: the master of Misselthwaite Manor has ceased intercourse with the world. Since the accidental death of his young, attractive wife, Archibald Craven has renounced all but the most basic of familial and social duties; he lives only for the past. He is a man of lost ambitions who is locked inside his own secret world of grief. Mr. Craven may not be a \"hunchback\"; but, in Burnett's eyes, he is just as surely incapacitated by his refusal to let the past die. Burnett implies that a \"gloomy\" old house, strongly suggestive of the dead weight of history, is the natural objective correlative for Mr. Craven's damaged psyche. For, no less than a lonely heart, the manor is packed with forgotten treasures that are largely inaccessible. Thus, I propose that The Secret Garden uses a gothic register but only to subvert the gothic's usual political calling. Gothic romances are often heroic obituaries for the nineteenth-century aristocracy; in contrast, Burnett sets herself to the task of rescuing the great country house and the decrepit members of the elite class who own such properties. Her narrative structure performs this \"socially symbolic act\" by exploring the social value of a returning colonial elite, symbolically figured in Mary. We have to look to the ideologies of discourse and to the dialogic standing of each character to appreciate the intricacy of the salvage process.\n\nWhen Mrs. Medlock tells Mary about what life in Yorkshire holds, Mary thinks to herself that \"it all [sounds] so unlike India\" (9); yet the dramatic tension of the first half of The Secret Garden derives precisely from the emigrant's failure to appreciate the cultural differences between her old and new home. In India, as a child of the colonial elite, Mary exercised total authority over native domestic servants. Such power (I shall call it Oriental despotism: power without just limits) forms her cultural identity, determines her capacity for moral empathy, in ways that accord with the subjective world of the \"Mem Sahib,\" the canonical feminine ideal of the British Raj—the good, stable wife who efficiently manages a native-run household. That this vaunted ideal sentimentalized the difficult reality of the Mem Sahib's life, Burnett hints at in her portrayal of Mary's mother, who is selfish, callous, vain, and frivolous, an instance of the type of woman—\"[she] cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people\" (1)—Calcutta society was notorious for. Not infrequently, this woman, with her genius for exacerbating racial tension in her careless treatment of the natives, was seen, particularly by Rudyard Kipling, as a blot on the empire.\n\nAccording to Pat Barr in her defense of the \"Victorian lady\" abroad, the Mem Sahib carried over her frustrations, difficult feelings induced by the patriarchal character of colonial society, into her dealings with domestic servants; in this view, her despotism is a form of transference, a compensation—played out in class and racial privilege—for her own subjection to the \"Sahib\" (her husband or father), the manly ideal of the British Raj. If Barr's interpretation holds, then Burnett is not so much interested in the transference process as in its moral and political effects. For, the relationship between the Mem Sahib and the subaltern, the house mistress and her minion, is premised on a sadomasochistic model, a power that knows few limits and therefore corrupts. The embryonic stirrings of this power are rendered visible in \"Missie Sahib\" Mary's \"tyrannical\" behavior. With her parental guidance found wanting and with no fear of sanction or reprimand, Mary insults and even assaults \"her Ayah,\" her Indian body servant. This is power colored by total egoism; bear in mind its title in this essay—Oriental depotism.\n\nConstituted on religious and racialist values and operating in the service of the British imperial state, Oriental despotism is the appropriate class system for India, crude faults and all; it cannot function in England without controversy. This \"territorializing\" of a certain political ideology—Oriental despotism—is the key to a distinct pedagogic vein that runs through the book. When Mrs. Medlock collects Mary's luggage at the train station, we are told that \"the little girl did not offer to help, because in India native servants always picked up or carried things, and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one\" (16-17). Although England exported its manners to the colonies, that which is \"proper\" to India might be wholly improper to England. That is to say, the fitting of propriety to a colonial setting makes it unfit for unreconstructed re-entry into Britain. Mem Sahibs and Ayahs have no real place in the British class system. Mary's \"sentimental education\" is aimed at her recognition of this point.\n\nAuthority learns about itself from those it subjects; as Hegel suggested, the subordinate classes are existential mirrors for the self-serving desires, the political subjectivity, of elites. The action of The Secret Garden expresses a profound interest in the reflective culture of power. Mary is first estranged from her Missie Sahib perspective by the behavior and demeanor of Martha, the \"untrained Yorkshire rustic\" (26) turned housemaid:\n\nMary listened to [Martha] with a grave, puzzled expression. The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this. They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them \"protector of the poor\" and names of that sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say \"please\" and \"thank you,\" and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she was angry.\n\n(22)\n\nMem Shaib and Ayah—colonist and native, sadist and masochist—these are the opposing players in the theatre of Oriental despotism. Note that the master's desires annihilate the individuality of the servant; the servant loses her self as the master develops her own. \"Good natured Yorkshire Martha\" (24-25) fails to appreciate the awesome character of protective power and thereby negates \"Mistress Mary's\" ability to utterly control her. In contrast to the typical \"Indian servant,\" Martha refuses to see herself as a mere instrument of her social superiors. She resolves to do her duties, but no more; she is thus able to hold onto a core of self-worth, the very quality power would destroy. In Martha, Mary sees the limits of her own authority, the relativity of despotism, and its possible inapplicability to the Yorkshire scene. The lesson is also learned from her initial confrontations with Ben Weatherstaff, the head gardener. In \"her imperious little Indian way,\" Mary first speaks to him as if he were \"a native\" (23). She soon discovers that \"a cross, sturdy old Yorkshireman was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded to do things\" (83). In short, she discovers the crucial difference between the colonial and British class systems; the former rests on power without dialogue, the latter on power with a vein of consensus. I now turn to the motif of the garden—its significance for reading class.\n\n\"Gardens and Fresh Air\"\n\n… a new kind of garden … a garden of children. This is the true garden. All others come as the prophecy of the human garden of paradise.\n\n—Margaret McMillan\n\nNo great house is complete without its garden. In the trope of a perfect verdant space—cultivated by religious, political, and aesthetic values (picture Eden or Arcadia)—the garden has long figured as an image of pastoral Utopia. Mythically, the garden is a site of innocence, eloquent of harmony and order and opposed to mundane history. In aesthetic terms, the exquisite artifice of the garden, what Kipling called its \"glory,\" represents nature at its most cultured or culture at its most admirable. In purely political terms, as demonstrated by the works of Jane Austen, the pastoral ideal of the garden holds a certain sway over the imagination of the landowner; the garden implies an ordered workforce, based on divided labor, with the landowner as its natural spiritual head. A summary is warranted: whether as a myth of social freedom or a myth of ordained rule, in pastoral dreams of political transcendence, all Utopian roads lead to a garden.\n\nSo many themes flow into Misselthwaite Manor's garden that its meaning is textually overdetermined. A symptomatic reading, careful in its use of the allegorical inference, can tease out the nexus of values manifest in the \"deserted,\" \"closed,\" and \"mysterious\" garden (adjectives that converge on the category of the \"secret\") and discover what \"symbolic capital,\" what cultural meaning, is realized for dreams of social perfection in the discourse of the exchange. Burnett invites us to read the garden as metaphor. Metaphor compels the signifier to release new meaning from itself; the signifier, however, can cause metaphor to \"turn,\" to fall into a self-sustaining controversy, which ruins the desired order of thematic significances. This perplexed scenario can be argued for in less abstract terms by reading Burnett's principal metaphor. Three discourses meet inside the walls of \"the secret garden\": a Wordsworthian romanticism, a progressivist child psychology, and an Oriental mysticism. As the metaphor of the garden turns, it forces this putative trio into conversation; competition; and, possibly, contradiction—a subversion of the comfortable Utopianism of the text.\n\nIn one respect, Wordsworthian romanticism names a rhetoric of values in which the perfect space of nature, the Utopian moment of culture, becomes a figuration of the self as opposed to an objective entity in the world. That is to say, the Wordsworthian critique of materialism (the industrial society) is at bottom an assertion of an individualistic spiritual code. A celebration of imagination, of that which is unschooled, the code naturally involves a search for the archetypal child, or what Carolyn Steedman calls \"the meaning of childhood\" (63) for a fallen adult world. The Wordsworthian child is a complex ideological commentary on the adulteration of \"virgin\" subjectivity, the forced narrowing of our capacity for reverie, and creative self-understanding. In losing our ability to commune with nature, we lose a vital part of ourselves.\n\nNot to be confused with the cloying little \"angels\" of Victorian fiction (cf. Little Lord Fauntleroy ), the Wordsworthian conception of the child exerted a powerful and lasting hold over literary and social institutions, which represented the meaning of childhood for British culture at large. In The Secret Garden, Wordsworthian themes are extensively quoted in the character of Dickon. Dickon—\"a common moor boy … as strong as a pony\" (89, 176) who knows \"how to talk to the wild creatures\" (171) and who, though practically illiterate, knows \"all the flowers by their country names\" (185)—constitutes the ideal standard of physical and mental harmony by which the other characters are to be judged. Indeed, his role in the text is to bring Mary and Colin to an awareness of what they might be capable of if only they relinquished their pride. The emphasis on Dickon's athleticism and his unschooled, superior intelligence rests on the Wordsworthian conviction that pristine nature is the best parent of the child; however, it also alludes to a contemporary social discourse concerned with weakened, stunted, and indolent children's bodies, what might be called a Spartan regimen for the needy young.\n\nFrom the late nineteenth century to the beginning of the First World War, the social definition of childhood underwent significant reinterpretation. Broadly speaking, the working-class child was transformed from a laboring subject into a target for \"disciplinary\" education.4 The transformation took place within a rhetoric of spiritual well being (i.e., a society was \"civilized\" to the extent that it protected its children) and a rhetoric of social hygiene as an expedient political goal. Both rhetorics converged in areas of state policy. A key thinker and a major activist in these areas was Margaret McMillan, journalist, writer, educator, and Labour party propagandist. McMillan was acutely aware that, in many industrial areas, children were \"a constituency in need of rescue\" (Steedman 9). As a socialist, she believed that, if one were to have any chance of rescuing working-class life from the hell it was steeped in, one had to rescue the castaways of the age, slum children. Clearly influenced by the romantic theories of Friedrich Froebel, the famous nineteenth-century proponent of the kindergarten, McMillan—in 1911, the year in which The Secret Garden was published—established a \"camp school\" (i.e., a city garden) for the sick and impoverished children of Deptford, South London. Bridging the divide between education ideology and welfare policy, the camp school was an ideal cultural space designed to counter the spiritual deficits of urban working-class childhood. The organizing principle of the project was explicitly Wordsworthian. The garden sought to realize the organic unity, what Wordsworth called \"the primal sympathy,\" that allegedly existed between the child and the natural world.5 McMillan's descriptions of the camp are never less than lyrical; she called the camp \"a new kind of garden … a garden of children\" (McMillan, Rachel McMillan 88), a place where \"our rickety children, our cramped … and … deformed children get back to earth with its magnetic currents, and the free-blowing wind\" (qtd. in Steedman 90). In comparison with the raw squalor of the city, the garden offered a transcendent moral aesthetic—that of nature itself. \"Will [the] children ever forget the healing joy of such nearness to the Spirit as is possible even in Deptford?\" asked McMillan (qtd. in Steedman 84-86).\n\nThe significance of Margaret McMillan's camp school for reading The Secret Garden resides in a crucial ideological vision promoted by both urban project and text: the notion that gardens constitute a form of social therapy and that they can rescue culture from political controversy, even from national decline. In the true spirit of the liberal reformer, McMillan was interested passionately in giving vent to the imaginative capabilities of the poor, but, in order to substantiate her cause, she tapped into a social hygiene debate, \"a vocabulary of national efficiency\" (Steedman 54), which had as its absolute subject the imperialist (and quasi-racist) discourse of a declining national culture. As Steedman puts it, \"in the first years of the twentieth century … the rather casual public interest in the health of schoolchildren suddenly became a widespread fear over the apparent deterioration of the British working-class\" (54), the very class that was needed to maintain the empire.6 Thus, the urban garden was not only called upon to take the slum out of the working-class child, it was also set the task of building fit bodies and keeping the bulldog spirit in place. The dovetailing of progressive Wordsworthian tenets with the reactionary politics of empire belongs, perhaps, to the history of the relationship between British socialism and nationalism, a history that cannot be dealt with here. But we can glimpse some of the contours of that history in the textuality of The Secret Garden, where the garden as therapeutic political space is center stage.\n\nA shorthand definition of the ideal \"disciplinary\" regime for training children's bodies, and cultivating their spirits, is the phrase \"gardens and fresh air\" (139). This regime is particularly associated with Susan Sowerby, Martha and Dickon's mother, who functions as a stark corrective to the example of Mrs. Lennox, the mother who fails to appreciate her familial duties. Susan's advice to others on how to raise children would not look out of place in a Margaret McMillan treatise.7 For instance, her prescription for lifting Mary out of her habitual Indian enervation is that Mary should be given \"simple healthy food\" and must be encouraged to \"run wild in the garden … she needs liberty and fresh air and romping about\" (109). Little wonder, then, that Mr. Craven sees Susan as \"healthyminded\" (109). Susan's philosophy, however, is more than a matter of social medicine; it is very much a politics of fitting social elites to rule over their particular cultural domain.\n\nThe narrative of The Secret Garden can be seen as structured by the incompletion of the three characters—Mary, Colin, and Mr. Craven; we are led to suspect that their respective social failings—Mary's cultural ignorance, Colin's hypochondria, and Mr. Craven's chronic depression—will, one way or another, find resolution at the close of the tale. The elitist ramifications of the Spartan ideal of health are manifest in the teleological characterization of Colin. Colin, like Mary, has had his identity shaped by the psychological impact of surviving a fractured family; his (unfounded) fear that he will eventually develop a \"hunchback\" is a none too subtle way of stating that he carries the paralysis of the Craven estate on his back. In other words, his indolent, impotent body implies a social critique of the functioning of Misselthwaite Manor. Colin's retreat from his body (coupled with his father's retreat from parental responsibility: \"I don't know anything about children\" [107]) incites him to practice on his subordinates emotional manipulation and outright tyranny. \"He [Colin] … could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do\" (117). A despot to the bone, \"everyone is obliged to do what pleases\" him (117). The similarity of Colin's behavior to the initial deportment of his Anglo-Indian cousin is all too obvious; both Colin and Mary act despotically because their (socially ratified) egoism keeps them from knowing better. As we have seen, Mary is eventually \"decentered\" by her relations with Martha and Ben Weatherstaff. For Colin, the situation is somewhat different; his overweening social power is entirely home grown, whereas Mary's is the strange fruit of elsewhere. How, then, does Burnett undo the authoritarianism, the despotic ego, of the \"very spoiled boy\" (28)?\n\nQuite simply, she sends him to the Wordsworthian clinic—the \"garden of children\"—where he imbibes the \"magic\" elixir of \"spirit.\" Note that throughout The Secret Garden a theme of spiritual egalitarianism consistently undercuts the realpolitik of class-based elitism. The animality of Dickon does not suggest slowness or barbarism (the orthodox snobbish line on \"unsophisticated yokels\"), rather, it pertains to the free and ideal state of nature, the true home of ethical values. Mindful of the romantic democracy of the imagination, where vital insight is less about erudite learning than the flight of individual desire, Burnett celebrates the preeminence of immediate experience in the very simplicity of Dickon. In this sense, the \"common cottage boy\" (154) is as much, or even more than, his evident social superiors. For Colin's alienation from the body makes him ignorant of what sensual life has to offer: \"I hate fresh air and I don't want to go out\" (116), he insists. As Mary tells Dickon, Colin knows \"a good many things out of books but he doesn't know anything else\" (148). The literate but unworldly Colin might thus be seen in the ideal space of the garden as an upper-class version of the deserving slum child. \"I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden\" (121), says he, after listening to Mary's promotions.\n\nWork and play in the garden enable Colin to transcend his fear of the body; a \"rapturous belief\" in the wonder of the sensual life and the \"realization\" of its dependence on nature takes hold of him and infuses him with backbone or moral character (248). Translated into a social context, Colin's \"epiphany\" valorizes the garden as a moderating political influence. In fine, brute despotism—getting one's \"own way in every detail\" (264)—is critically undermined by a moralistic appeal to a culture of discipline, a value system of humility and consideration for \"other people\" (152). Thus, as Utopian social therapy, the secret garden implies that political stability, balanced relations between elites and their domestic subordinates, is more at home in discipline than in despotism. Notice that Colin's recuperation makes him fit not only for child's play but also to inherit the title and paternal status of his father—the attribution \"Master Colin\" is the last phrase of the entire narrative, which draws all the uncertainties of the text into a closed social statement, like tributary roads converging on Rome. Allegorical inferences, therefore, lead me to assert that Margaret McMillan's dream of using the garden to take the slums out of working-class children, becomes in Burnett's novel, a dream of using the garden to put the young, gentleman back into the heart of the great house. But, inside that house, political controversy still reigns.\n\nA Rajah in Yorkshire\n\nI have been talking today about the acts and symptoms of British rule in India. What is its basis? It is not military force, it is not civil authority, it is not prestige, though all these are part of it. If our rule is to last in India it must rest on a more solid basis. It must depend on the eternal moralities of righteousness and justice.\n\n—Lord Curzon\n\nWhat intrigues me is the notion that despotism is forever expelled and yet somehow retrieved by the text. This curious \"respiratory\" action—forcing out the irritant only to draw it back in—directly relates to a concatenation of cultural values associated with race, class, and gender; the remittal of these values covers a range of ideology and discourse from cultural authenticity to social harmony, from national well being to political authority. This range begins and ends at the same difficult point in history—the problematic of the empire coming home, the ambiguous challenge of blowback.\n\nI contend that the narrative interest in making damaged children whole creates a space, a sort of political reserve, for rehabilitating the language and cultural values of empire. The Secret Garden is premised on the idea that environment determines character; class, region, and nationality are seen as the parameters of consciousness. Mary's egoism, her lack of courtesy and manners, precisely results from her upbringing in the colonial setting, where servants minister to every need and desire and encourage indolence and complacency. Thus, Burnett tells us that Mary \"was a disagreeable child … who did not know that she was so herself\" (11). As Mary learns, à la belle étoile, to temper privilege with grace, only then is the author ready to concede that she is \"getting on\" (44) in terms of moral development. The point is clear: children owe their natures to the nature of their social conditioning—\"where you tend a rose … a thistle cannot grow\" (257). Yet, the general reasoning that informs this worthy platitude is somewhat contradicted by the outcome of the textual struggle between elite political philosophies. I am saying that the \"thistle\" of despotism grows in such a way as to strangulate discipline's \"rose.\"\n\nDespotism is properly an Oriental phenomenon. Despotism belongs to India.8 This is first implied by the narrative critique of Mary and is then openly stated in a telling anecdote, which Mary relates to Colin:\n\nOnce in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as you spoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them—in a minute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn't.\n\n(130-31)\n\nThis carefree anatomy of the \"exotic\" barbarities of \"the East\" is not short on the typical Orientalist ruses which Edward Said, in Orientalism, alerts us to. Note how Mary passes from innocent eyewitness to political ethnographer (\"I saw\" … \"I think\"); notice also the implicit connection between outrageous luxury and violent rule, which has been, and remains, a standard Western trope of the Oriental political scene. The fact that Burnett can furnish such a description at a time when despotism was gaining widespread association with British imperial rule might be seen as an instance of the literary sleight of hand colonial discourse excels in; yet, the passage also dances to the tune of blowback. The memory of the Rajah is brought forth by the (very British) class structure that allows Colin (the gentry) to abuse Martha (the peasantry) with impunity.9\n\nDespotism is a creature of the East. The spiritual trajectory of the text is to remove those aspects of the East considered unsuitable for elite social performance in an English setting. The transformation of the colonial subject anticipates a similar transformation in Master Colin, her home-based cousin. Thus, it seems fair to say that both characters are disoriented, stripped of alien authoritarian political tendencies. This staging of the English class question on an Orientalist platform is not as one way as it might seem. Class relations at the manor are filtered through the ideal(izing) medium of the garden in a way that challenges the liberal conception of social hierarchy and allows the narrative to arrive at what must be called back-door despotism. The key to it all is a symbolic power, a metaphorical valence accorded the proper noun \"India.\"\n\nIndia is signified in the text by at least two modes of discourse, both Orientalist at root: on the one hand, the rhetoric of despotism (values and images of servants and potentates, minions and rajahs) and, on the other, the rhetoric of mysticism (the discourse on \"fakirs,\" \"animal charmers,\" storytelling, and priests, those farthest removed from the cares and concerns of this world). Now The Secret Garden criticizes the former and largely celebrates the latter, but elements of the rhetoric of despotism are smuggled into the praise of mysticism. This secret readmission of the inadmissible (power without limits) through the back door, as it were, is betrayed by the functional value of \"magic.\" Magic, we are told, constitutes the index of Oriental mysticism and is particularly associated with the Eastern \"tradition\" of storytelling. Leaving aside the questionable ethnographic values which typically inform this kind of cultural constructionism, Burnett's interest in magic, in prerational intuitive force, while leading her in life to spiritualism, leads her text to the heart of mundane politics: the issue of the appropriate balance of power. As her Ayah was to her in India, Mary, in Yorkshire, becomes a function of Colin's feeble body, which is overly fixated on itself and socially performs without proper limits. To calm his volatile nerves and to send him off to sleep, Mary massages Colin's hand and sings \"a very low little chanting song in Hindustani\" (124; cf. 152). If Mary is an \"Ayah,\" then Colin should be the equivalent of a colonial elite. But this is not so; he is described as a \"boy rajah\" (135), a \"young rajah\" (175), \"Mr. Rajah\" (153), \"a rajah flesh and blood\" (204); at no point in the text is he equated with the \"Sahib,\" the British imperial ideal. Thus, colonialism and the English class system are conveniently displaced into the alleged social patterns of the Oriental scene. This might not matter if the text did not claim for this displacement an absolute political value.\n\nThe politics of Oriental despotism, summarily dismissed in the great house, comes into its own in the garden. Colin is waited on by servants, literally hand and foot. His authority is so total that \"Mary could not help remembering how the young native prince … had waved to command his servants to approach with salaams and receive his orders\" (176). A chapter later, Burnett describes \"the rajah,\" Master Colin, waving his hand to command his \"manservant\" and his \"nurse\" (192). Fired by the challenge of manual labor (i.e., the Spartan regimen) and the fear of appearing less than fit to rule in front of his social inferiors, the \"fretful invalid\" (254) is soon on the road to becoming a \"real boy\" (241), confident, intelligent, athletic. The fact that magic—the rhetoric of mysticism (\"that sense of the beauty of land and sky\" [265])—makes for a social reality of the garden that undercuts its value as a place of spiritual equality is an ideological contradiction hardly resolved by the text. If resolution does occur, then it is achieved in a manner that represents an uncertain assimilation of colonial power, a power which had largely operated free from the moderating measures deemed necessary at home. Power has its secrets, and it is to these we now turn.\n\nThe Secret Dreams of Power\n\nAnd there you'll see the Gardeners, the men and / 'prentice boys / Told off to do as they are bid and do it without noise.\n\n—Rudyard Kipling, \"The Glory of the Garden\"\n\nOn the whole, however, it may be admitted, that our Indian government is the best example of a well administered despotism, on a large scale existing in the world … our rule in India must needs be despotic.\n\n—Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke\n\nThe province of magic is essential human equality, the classless society. Magic and the Spartan regimen of health overlap in the character of Dickon. With his Pan-like pipes, Dickon can charm animals \"just as the natives in India charm snakes\" (131). \"There really was a sort of magic about Dickon…. 'He'd be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of coal mine'\" (188). Dickon encapsulates the best of what \"the East\" has to o"
