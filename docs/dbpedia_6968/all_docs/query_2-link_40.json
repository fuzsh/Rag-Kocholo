        "text": "For those who wonder how early the summer movie season really began, consider May 7, the day \"Dave,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\" opened. As it turns out, \"Dragon\" had a surprisingly strong opening, \"Dave\" has made $63 million and \"Much Ado\" an impressive (for Shakespeare) $20 million. Both \"Dave\" and \"Much Ado\" continue to play in movie theaters.\n\nIn a summer with an unusually large number of films, the hits are still standing tall, and the losers have long since been buried. For moviegoers with short memories, here is a recap of who did what, and why, starting with the official beginning of this year's summer movie season, the week before the Memorial Day weekend. Week of May 16 \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\" The first \"Hot Shots\" (1991) grossed an unexpectedly large $68 million. \"Part Deux,\" a less funny Rambo takeoff, grossed a disappointing $38 million. Forget Part Trois. \"Sliver\" The overhyped Sharon Stone-William Baldwin film about high-tech voyeurism promised steamy sex and more. But there was a lackluster script, and the stars didn't get along on the set. It showed. The result: an unsteamy movie and a finale that left audiences hooting. A serious dud. Week of May 23 (Memorial Day weekend) \"Cliffhanger\" After some comedy mishaps, Sylvester Stallone made a surprisingly successful return to what he does best: grunt, flex his muscles and blow away the bad guys. Dazzling scenery, a restrained performance by Mr. Stallone (who also wrote much of the script) and great action. Sly finally has a big hit, which has grossed $82 million domestically so far and another $78 million abroad. \"Made in America\" Whoopi and Ted starred in a not-too-funny sitcom-style comedy about a woman who finds her father through a sperm bank. Surprisingly (and Warner Brothers officials were very surprised) the movie has grossed a sizable $43 million, demonstrating that silliness works, especially if accompanied by a highly publicized off-screen romance. \"Menace II Society\" This startling directorial debut about the Los Angeles ghetto instantly made the careers of its twin 21-year-old film makers, Allen and Albert Hughes. (They've since signed a contract with Disney.) But the film, which got rave reviews and grossed an impressive $27 million, never quite reached the cross-over, or white, audience. \"Super Mario Brothers\" Because of the enormous popularity of the video game that inspired it, this quirky, expensive film ($30 million to $40 million) was viewed by its distributor, the Walt Disney Company, as a potential breakthrough. Disney was wrong. The film failed to find an audience, grossing only $21 million. Now studios are realizing that popular video games won't automatically turn into popular movies. Week of May 30 \"Un Coeur en Hiver\" This fragile, critically acclaimed French film about love and obsession shows little sign of tapering off, making it one of the summer's few successful foreign films. \"Guilty as Sin\" Don Johnson as a murderous womanizer. Rebecca De Mornay as his lawyer. Not a hit. Not a flop. Just a film that got lost. \"Life With Mikey\" A Michael J. Fox movie with a terrible title about a washed-up sitcom star. A strikeout for the popular actor, who is in a serious slump. \"The Music of Chance\" This adaptation of Paul Auster's strange novel is still playing at half a dozen theaters, yet it has earned only $200,000, despite highly praised performances by Mandy Patinkin and James Spader. Week of June 6 \"Jurassic Park\" More than $500 million worldwide and counting. Despite early controversy about the violence, everyone took their children to see it, and it's still going strong. A sure Oscar nominee for special effects. \"Orlando\" Sally Potter's elegant and lavishly praised version of the Virginia Woolf novel is playing at an impressive number of art-house and college theaters. After this modest success, Ms. Potter received several offers from Hollywood. \"What's Love Got to Do With It?\" With riveting Oscar-caliber performances by Angela Bassett as Tina Turner and Laurence Fishburne as bad Ike, the film emerged as one of the summer's best reviewed. It is considered a financial success, too, having grossed about $37 million so far. But it failed to lure large audiences outside big cities and was not the hit Disney expected. Week of June 13 \"Last Action Hero\" Even Columbia executives have admitted that this was the summer's major disaster -- and biggest surprise, having been the season's second-most anticipated movie. Because of its huge cost, it needed to gross at least $100 million to break even. So far, it has taken in $50 million in this country and doesn't look too healthy abroad. \"Once Upon a Forest\" This ecologically correct animated tale about a mole, a mouse and a hedgehog wasn't as terrible as it sounds. But children stayed away, and the movie withered. Week of June 20 \"Dennis the Menace\" The old story: some terrible reviews but children dragged their parents to see it. It grossed more than $47 million, helped by plenty of hype and a silly trailer. \"House of Cards\" A puzzling and unsuccessful drama about a 6-year-old who lapses into silence after her father dies. The movie died too. \"Sleepless in Seattle\" For months, Tri-Star predicted that the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan movie would emerge as the hit romantic comedy of summer. They were right. It grossed more than $100 million and established Nora Ephron as a top-tier writer-director. Week of June 27 \"The Firm\" A best seller. Tom Cruise. Flashy production. Mediocre reviews. Opening at the start of the July Fourth weekend, it became one of the summer's biggest hits and reached $100 million in 22 days. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" Disney had good luck with the 56-year-old animated Snow White, which brought in $38 million in re-release. What a contrast to the disappointing re-release of \"Pinocchio\" last year, which made only $18 million. But then \"Pinocchio\" had been released on video; \"Snow White\" hasn't. \"Son-in-Law\" A perfect movie for only modestly intelligent 12-year-olds. The film, with Pauly Shore in the starring role and horrible reviews, has grossed more than $30 million. Disney laughed all the way to the bank. Week of July 4 \"In the Line of Fire\" Clint Eastwood meets John Malkovich, who will probably be nominated for a best-supporting Oscar. The movie got some of the summer's best reviews and will ultimately earn a fat $115 million (which establishes once and for all that Hollywood has few stars like Clint). \"Rookie of the Year\" The film has grossed an impressive $45 million, proving that boys and baseball are a perennially winning combination. \"Weekend at Bernie's II\" The embarrassing sequel to the 1989 sleeper comedy about a corpse and a pair of yuppies netted only $12 million. Mercifully, Bernie will not have a trilogy. Week of July 11 \"Benefit of the Doubt\" In this thriller, starring Donald Sutherland and Amy Irving, strange things happen on the screen. Nothing happened at the box office. \"Free Willy\" The highly successful children's movie is about a 12-year-old who helps save a whale. Despite its modest budget and no-star cast, the film, at $63 million, has outperformed \"Last Action Hero.\" \"Hocus Pocus\" Even with three stars -- Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy -- the audiences found the comedy unfunny and the plot thin. The film floundered, but no one's blaming the women. Week of July 18 \"Amongst Friends\" A modest drama about Long Island tough guys. The film, which was lauded at the Sundance Film Festival, started slowly at fewer than two dozen theaters. The director Rob Weiss has nevertheless been rewarded with a first-look deal and a bungalow at Universal. \"Another Stakeout\" A sequel to the buddy-comedy hit, with Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez. Even with the addition of Rosie O'Donnell, however, the movie got lost in the shuffle of films for teen-agers. \"Coneheads\" A very funny, straight from \"Saturday Night Live\" movie that, amazingly, failed to attract audiences. Enormous hype, heavy promotion, Dan Aykroyd, but it grossed a disappointing $20 million. \"Poetic Justice\" The writer-director John Singleton followed up his impressive debut, \"Boyz N the Hood,\" with this new drama, starring Janet Jackson. It is a modest commercial success but a critical disappointment. The verdict: an unfortunate blip in Singleton's career. Week of July 25 \"Rising Sun\" Considering that this was based on Michael Crichton's Japan-bashing novel, the movie, starring Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes, was a surprisingly conventional thriller. Though reviews were mixed, the movie was not the flop that many in Hollywood predicted. It has already grossed $50 million and may top out at $65 million. \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" Mel Brooks meets Robin Hood. The movie takes sharp aim at Kevin Costner's film and is very politically incorrect, but with $26 million, it could count as a modest success. \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" This comedy-thriller starring Mike Myers (and plagued by script and cast problems) was considered something of a mess by a number of critics. A box-office failure. \"Tom and Jerry: The Movie\" An animated movie that children passed up. They were surfeited with films this summer and had better things to do. Week of Aug. 1 \"The Fugitive\" The tense melodrama, starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, is being described by critics as the best of the summer, with a slew of Oscar nominations likely. It has already grossed $115 million and is rapidly heading upward, making it likely to be the second-highest grossing picture of the summer after \"Jurassic Park.\" \"The Meteor Man\" Robert Townsend wrote, directed and starred in this fantasy about a teacher in the ghetto who's hit by a meteor and acquires Superman powers. A box-office failure. \"My Boyfriend's Back\" A teen-age ghost movie that is, arguably, one of the worst of the summer. Critical opinion held that it was one-joke comedy, combining Archie comic books with a teen-age zombie film. It will be lucky to earn $5 million. \"That Night\" A slender drama about a romance in Long Island in 1961 that seemed to disappear without a trace. \"The Wedding Banquet\" This widely praised comedy about the New York Taiwanese community, playing at less than a dozen theaters, may still find an audience. Week of Aug. 8 \"Heart and Souls\" Hollywood executives have a favorite phrase for serious movies -- \"It's about redemption.\" \"Heart and Souls\" is about redemption. A little too cute and coy for most audiences. \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\" Only for Jason freaks, and they seem to be on the wane. This ninth movie in the series -- deemed incoherent by the critics -- opened big but had nowhere to go but down. \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" Critics loved it; so did the movie industry. But relatively few moviegoers heard the news. The title didn't help, since most people thought it was about Bobby Fischer. It's actually about parents and children. \"The Secret Garden\" An intelligent film for children, a qualified commercial success and a big artistic one for the director, Agnieszka Holland. Week of Aug. 15 \"The Ballad of Little Jo\" A revisionist western (about a woman who lived as a man) that was critically well received but is playing at only three theaters. \"Hard Target\" The first American film by the Hong Kong director John Woo, this time directing Jean-Claude Van Damme. A strong commercial debut. \"King of the Hill\" A harrowing drama with superb reviews, directed by Steven Soderbergh, about a 12-year-old boy during the Depression. Audiences may be find it pretty depressing as summer fare. \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" Woody's 23d film reunited him with Diane Keaton but not yet with his audience. Exhibitors call the film -- which got generally positive reviews -- a major disappointment. Tri-Star says it's too early to write it off as a commercial failure. Surf Ninjas A martial-arts film rendered as a family movie. No sale. \"Wilder Napalm\" Everyone makes mistakes, even pros like Debra Winger and Dennis Quaid. The film just about died before it opened. Week of Aug. 22 \"The Man Without a Face\" Mel Gibson's first stab at directing. Critics were generally kind to Mr. Gibson as a director, but the movie is a tough sell and its grosses are disappointing. \"Needful Things\" No summer would be complete without a Stephen King horror movie. But the box office remains needful on this one. \"Only the Strong\" Featuring capoeira, which one critic described as \"the lambada of martial arts styles.\" \"Son of Pink Panther\" In 1980, when Peter Sellers died, Blake Edwards must have despaired of ever casting another Inspector Clouseau. He did, and shouldn't have. A box-office flop. Week of Aug. 29 (Labor Day weekend) \"Boxing Helena\" Jennifer Lynch's strange story about an obsessed man and the armless and legless woman he created. After much controversy, and a lawsuit against Kim Basinger, who was scheduled to star, what moviegoers want to know is: Is the movie demented or is it art? \"Kalifornia\" Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis are a trashy couple who hit the road. May find an audience in kollege towns."
