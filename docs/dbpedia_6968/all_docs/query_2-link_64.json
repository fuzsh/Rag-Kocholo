        "text": "All Creatures Great and Small (Channel 5, 2021)\n\nFountains Abbey is famous for the World Heritage Site gardens and vast ruins, but much lesser known and tucked away in a secluded part of Studley Royal Deer Park is a traditional cricket pitch too.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, the property welcomed hundreds of cast, crew and creatures to film some exciting scenes for Season 2 of the much-loved Yorkshire drama.\n\nVisitors were treated to a trip back in time as the pitch was transformed into a traditional summer cricket match with a huge dressed marquee, vintage vehicles and of course, some wonderful costumes.\n\nThe Witcher (Netflix, 2021)\n\nFilming a huge series like The Witcher is a serious undertaking in any circumstances. Add in coronavirus restrictions, unseasonably wet weather and a World Heritage Site as a major location, and it becomes even more complicated.\n\nIn October and November 2020, around 250 cast and crew moved into a vast unit base at Fountains Abbey to prepare for a packed couple of weeks’ filming.\n\nThe mixture of atmospheric medieval ruins and Georgian gardens, filled with crashing cascades and eerie statues, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal gave the perfect backdrop for season two of the fantasy drama.\n\nAnne Boleyn (Channel 5, 2021)\n\nThis three-part historical drama from Channel 5 is set during the final months of the infamous Tudor queen’s (Jodie Turner-Smith) life at court, as she lives with pressure of her royal marriage dangerously crumbling around her.\n\nFountains Abbey – with its own downfall closely linked to Henry VIII (played by Mark Stanley) – was a fitting location to film the story of the collapsing marriage.\n\nWhere to see Fountains Abbey in Anne Boleyn\n\nIf you’re catching up with the show, see if you can spot the exterior of Fountains Hall and the Elizabethan Herb Garden, which were used as filming locations for the series. Fluttering peacocks, galloping horses and sumptuous Tudor costumes completed the unfolding scenes.\n\nYou can also see another Yorkshire location, East Riddlesden Hall, where the distinctive house exterior features in some of the outdoor scenes.\n\nThe Secret Garden (1993, 2020)\n\nFountains Abbey has long ties with The Secret Garden. In the 1993 film adaptation, Fountains Hall served as the exterior of Misselthwaite Manor, while a small, gated doorway just opposite became the hidden entrance into the garden.\n\nFor the 2020 film, it’s the ancient Abbey ruins that are the stars of the show set in 1947, alongside Dixie Egerickx, Colin Firth, and Julie Walters.\n\nThe crew transformed the ruins into a sunken temple complete with vine-covered walls. They constructed temporary pools, which allowed them to cover the ground with water for the children to splash around in, while still protecting the historic site.\n\nGunpowder (BBC One, 2017)\n\nIt’s 1603, and England is at war with Catholic Spain. Elizabeth I is dead and King James of Scotland has taken the throne. Several attempts to take the Protestant king’s life have already been made – but failed.\n\nDeep in the heart of the Warwickshire countryside a new plot is brewing, a plot that will leave a mark on a country that will be felt over 400 years later.\n\nSee the Fountains Abbey Cellarium and Hall steps on-screen\n\nIn 2017, Fountains Abbey was transformed for 10 days to film the BBC drama Gunpowder. The steps of Fountains Hall and the gothic atmosphere of the Cellarium, with its striking vaulted ceilings, gave the backdrop to several scenes in the story, starring Kit Harington and Liv Tyler."
