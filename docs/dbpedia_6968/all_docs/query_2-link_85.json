        "text": "Springtime isn’t just picnics, nice weather and pretty flowers; it’s a rebirth, and all the symbolism that word entails. These 10 films capture the spirit of our most hopeful season – most with joy, some with madness, but all with energy.\n\n10. 'Spring Breakers' (2012)\n\nHarmony Korine’s films (“Kids,” ” Gummo,” “Trash Humpers”) often feel like a dare, the cinematic equivalent of blending every gross condiment in the refrigerator into a noxious concoction and making someone chug it in a cruel hazing ritual. Even if you have no idea what to make of Korine’s drug-fueled DayGlo hedonism, James Franco is mesmerizing as rapper/drug dealer Alien (an appropriate name if ever there was one), who takes under his wing four college girls on spring break. Franco, behind a piano, singing Britney Spears’ “Everytime” through a gold grill as his girls dance around him with guns? That’s a kind of genius, even if it’s accidental.\n\n9. 'The Secret Garden' (1993)\n\nA spoiled young British girl orphaned by an earthquake in India is sent to England to live with her uncle. She’s damaged and unhappy, but the discovery of a secret garden, locked away for years, brings her back to life as she brings it back to life. A gorgeous adaptation of a classic of English literature, blooming with magic.\n\n8. 'You’ve Got Mail' (1998)\n\nThe story originates from a 1937 play and it’s been adapted into several films — “The Shop Around the Corner” (1940), “In the Good Old Summertime” (1949) —but Nora Ephron’s modern adaptation is the bubbliest of the bunch and the most cheerful and charming of her romances. Tom Hanks plays the owner of a bookstore megachain, Meg Ryan the owner of an independent shop it threatens to shutter. They’re natural enemies – except they’re unknowingly in love, thanks to secret messages in chat rooms and through emails. A final assignation in a park blooming with flowers and romance is springtime on celluloid.\n\n7. '10 Things I Hate About You' (1999)\n\nOh, how young everyone was. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the new kid in school, and he has to find a date for abrasive, outcast Kat (Julia Stiles) in order to get permission to take her sweet little sister to prom. He enlists the help of a rebel heartthrob (Health Ledger, in his breakout role) to woo the difficult sis. It's a sassy take on Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" and all that young charisma on screen makes it one of the great '90s high-school films.\n\n6. 'Easter Parade' (1948)\n\nWhat better way to cinematically celebrate spring than with a big, bright and colorful MGM musical, never mind one starring old-school-musical titans Judy Garland and Fred Astaire with music by Irving Berlin? Astaire plays a Broadway performer who’s just lost his beautiful dancing partner. Determined to make a star of the next girl he meets, he recruits Garland, a lowly bar dancer. It proves to be a mismatch made in heaven.\n\n5. 'Field of Dreams' (1989)\n\nThis baseball fantasy is to a certain breed of dude what, say, “Dirty Dancing” is to a certain breed of gal. Which is to say, catnip. Kevin Costner stars as novice farmer Ray Kinsella, who’s moved to turn his cornfield into a baseball diamond when he hears a disembodied voice whisper the now-iconic and oft-parodied line, “If you build it, he will come.” What follows is a story of absent-father wish-fulfillment paired with baseball fanaticism and one of film’s all-time most understanding wives. (“Sure, honey, plow our primary source of income to build a baseball diamond in the middle of nowhere because a voice told you to.”) But it cemented Costner as the era’s ultimate everyman movie star, and it definitely puts one in the mood for baseball season.\n\n4. 'The Producers' (1967)\n\nAdmittedly, the connection to springtime beyond a song title is tenuous at best, but a good Mel Brooks movie needs to justification. Two shysters (Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder) plot to produce a Broadway flop to bilk investors and flee to South America with the cash. Their plans go awry when the show turns out to be a hit – and how could it not be, when it features the musical number “Springtime for Hitler?\" The audience in the film takes it to be satire. We just take it to be hilarious.\n\n3. 'Mary Poppins' (1964)\n\nIf springtime were a sound it would be Julie Andrews’ golden soprano, which soars as high as the titular nanny does with her magical umbrella. She breathes joy into the Banks home on Cherry Tree Lane in this sprightly British fantasy, where sidewalk drawings spring to life, animated butterflies flit about and “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” counts as a perfectly sensible word, capturing all the giddy tumult of spring in song.\n\n2. 'My Neighbor Totoro' (1988)\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a movie more adorable and suffused with a child’s wonderment than “Totoro,” a warm, lovingly crafted fantasy about two young sisters living in postwar rural Japan. There’s not much by way of plot; the girls live alone with their father while their mother recuperates from some unnamed illness in the hospital. Meanwhile, their days are filled with the sort of idle play and boundless imagination that brings to life friendly spirits in the forms of a big, fuzzy, rabbitlike creature and a cat shaped like a bus. It’s pure whimsy.\n\n1. 'Bambi' (1942)\n\nDisney’s fifth animated feature film, about a fawn coming of age with a cohort of woodland creatures, remains one of the studio’s most gorgeous, a restrained and painterly celebration of the beauty, and fragility, of nature. The forest springs to life with April showers and bluebirds tweeting a gay little spring song. Of course, nature can also be cruel, and so this is also one of Disney’s most traumatizing films, teaching a generation of impressionable young viewers that even mothers die. “Man was in the forest,” Bambi’s mother warns, casting us, the viewers, as the most dangerous villains of all."
