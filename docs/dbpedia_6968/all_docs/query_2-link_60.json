        "text": "Disclaimer: I was provided with a digital code to view this film and provide an honest review as well as offer a giveaway. These opinions are my own.\n\nI had the opportunity to watch an early release of Elevation Pictures 2020 version of The Secret Garden movie that just came out August 7.\n\nThe original version of the movie came out in 1993 and the Classic novel was published in 1911.\n\nThe 2020 version has a few well known faces in it, including Colin Firth and Julie Walters. I’ve always enjoyed Colin Firth’s movies, personally.\n\nThe story is about a young girl, Mary (played by Dixie Egerickx) who becomes orphaned and then must move back to England to live with her uncle (played by Colin Firth), adapting to a whole new life.\n\nThe movie deals with several traumatic and dark situations (mental health, abandonment, loss, grief), which may be hard for some kids to watch. Although, the story is about overcoming these obstacles thru friendships, empathy, inclusion and optimism. How finding joy in the little things can see you thru the rough times. How there is always light after the darkness. The contrast of the dark Misselthwaite Manor and brightness of The Secret Garden. The garden that becomes a place of zen, happiness, memories, healing and growth for all a place to escape the painful memories of the past.\n\nOverall it was a really nice family movie for us. We all enjoyed the slower pace of the movie and all got emotional as we felt a connection to the characters. There was a certain charm about this movie. The cinemetography was very good. It is a classic story and one that everyone should experience.\n\nThe Secret Garden is available on demand NOW. Find out where to watch it here: https://www.secretgarden.movie/buy/\n\nModern Mama Fraser Valley & Vancouver recently did a giveaway for an HD digital code of the movie as well as the classic novel. The giveaway ended on August 7, winners were chosen and have been contacted. Thank you to everyone who entered.\n\nCheck out Modern Mamas other Elevation Pictures movie reviews.\n\nEnjoy!"
