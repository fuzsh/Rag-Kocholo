        "text": "3. Tea is over. Mrs. Brown has put the little sitting room in order. The fire burns brightly. One lamp gives light enough for all. On the stool is a basket of fine apples. They seem to say, âWonât you have one?â\n\n5. By and by, they will tell one another what they have been reading about, and will have a chat over the events of the day.\n\nNew York, Dec. 10, 1878\n\nDear Santa Claus:\n\nPapa is going to give me a Christmas tree, and he says that you will put nice things on it if I ask you. I would like a gun that will shoot, and a rubber ball that I can throw hard, and that will not break Mammaâs windows or the big glass in the parlor. Now, please don't forget to come. I live on Fourth St., number ten. I will go to bed at eight oâclock, and shut my eyes tight. I will not look, indeed I wonât.\n\nYour little boy,\n\nWillie.\n\n3. Then, if I were in the dark,\n\nI would thank you for your spark.\n\nI could not see which way to go,\n\nIf you did not twinkle so."
