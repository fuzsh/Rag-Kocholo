        "text": "When you start a business, you spend a lot of time choosing the perfect name—but the name you choose may not end up being the name your business is known by. This is the difference between a trade name vs. a business name. Your trade name is the name you use when you conduct business: It appears on your storefront, advertising, and customer-facing materials. Your legal business name is the name registered with your Secretary of State that you use for tax and legal purposes.\n\nThis can be the same name, or it can be different. If your business structure requires you to have “Inc.” or “LLC” at the end of your name, you may find that you drop those letters when you advertise or talk about your business. Or you can choose a different name entirely. But to protect yourself and your business name, and meet legal requirements, you will need to do some additional paperwork to cover all the names you use.\n\nWhat is a legal business name?\n\nYour legal business name is the name that you use on the paperwork you file to create your business. If you own a corporation, it’s the name on the corporation papers you file with your state, including the articles of incorporation. If your business structure is a limited liability company (LLC) or limited liability partnership (LLP), it’s the name on the LLC or LLP formation papers you file with the state. By filing those papers, you officially designate your business’s legal name. This is also the name that appears on your tax ID or employee ID paperwork and is the name used on your tax returns.\n\nThe legal name is the formal, official name of your business that identifies it with the government. If you have a corporation, your name probably contains the word “Inc.,” such as Cute Boots Inc. If your business is an LLC, your name likely concludes with “LLC,” like Valley Woodwork LLC. However, your trade name may drop these designations. This is usually the biggest difference in the discussion of trade name vs. business name.\n\nWhat is a trade name?\n\nA trade name, also called a DBA (doing business as) name or fictitious name, is the name you use when you conduct business. This term also comes up in the discussion of trade name vs. brand name, however, both are names that the public will recognize, and these terms are often used interchangeably. Walmart is a good example of a trade name. Walmart's trade name is just Walmart—that's the name it uses on its advertising and website, and what most people refer to it as. However, its legal name, which appears on all of its business paperwork (corporation filings, taxes, compliance, etc.) is Wal-Mart Inc.\n\nA trade name is usually the same as the legal name, with “Inc.” or “LLC” dropped. So if your business is registered as Tasha’s Dog Grooming LLC, the name your customers know is likely just Tasha’s Dog Grooming.\n\nHowever, a company’s trade name can be something entirely different from its legal name. As the business owner, you might have registered your business as Jameel’s Book Store LLC, but decide to just refer to your business as Best Books because it’s more memorable or simply shorter. Small businesses might even change their trade name multiple times as they grow.\n\nSome companies create a separate registration for different parts of their business. Gap Inc., for example, does business as Old Navy, Athleta, and Banana Republic even though all of those brands are just part of the Gap Inc. company. The bottom line is that you are not required to have a trade name, but you might that find having one comes in handy.\n\nRegistration requirements\n\nOne thing that isn’t so different when considering a trade name vs. business name is that they both require registration. If you are forming a corporation or LLC, you are required to register your company’s legal business name with your state. Registration of the name is simply part of your official corporation or LLC business paperwork. Whatever name you use in those filings is your legal name.\n\nNote that in most states, you can’t have the same name as an existing business. Before you file your formation papers, do a name search with the state to determine whether the name you want to use is available. You may be able to place a hold on a name (with a fee) until you are able to get your papers filed, but that is not a formal trade name registration.\n\nYou are not required to have a trade name; you can simply do business with your full legal name. But if you choose to use a trade name, you will need to register it with your state or county. To protect consumers (so they can determine who actually owns a business they interact with), you must file a fictitious name statement (sometimes just called a DBA filing) by filling out a simple form, paying a fee, and sometimes placing a legal notice in a newspaper.\n\nBenefits of trade names\n\nHaving a trade name allows you to legally recognize what your customers might end up calling your business anyhow because they are likely to drop the “LLC” or “Inc.” designation. It comes with some benefits:\n\nBrand flexibility. By registering a trade name, you can use that name freely in your advertising without concerns that you are misidentifying your business.\n\nBusiness expansion. Using different trade names enables you to enter new markets or launch various product lines without forming new legal entities.\n\nPrivacy protection. A trade name can help keep your legal business name private if you want an extra layer of confidentiality.\n\nStreamline banking. A trade name registration also means you can have one bank account for multiple business names. So, whether a client writes a check to Meema’s Auto Repair Inc. or just to Meema's Auto Repair, you can cash the check because the bank has your registration papers for both names.\n\nDrawbacks of trade names\n\nThe biggest drawback of a trade name is that, in most states, it doesn’t provide legal protection. Registering a trade name does not give you the exclusive right to use that name. If your business’s legal name is Sandy’s Ice Cream LLC but your trade name is Yummy Ice Cream, any other business could also use that trade name. There are a few other disadvantages you should know about.\n\nIncreased paperwork and costs. Your state might require a trade name renewal every few years or require you to register the name in every single county in which you plan to do business. That means filing a form and paying a fee in each county, which can add up.\n\nLimited uniqueness. The ability for businesses to have similar trade names also means the name you choose may not be unique, which could confuse customers.\n\nProtecting your business name with a trademark\n\nIn some states, you can’t have the same trade name as another business: The first business to register a DBA gets the right to it. You might have been calling yourself Yummy Ice Cream for a year before you register it, but if Tia’s Ice Cream LLC has registered Yummy Ice Cream already, you won't be able to use it if your state has this rule.\n\nThe only way to be certain that you can have exclusive rights to a trade name is to register it as a trademark, which is a more involved process you can complete through your state’s trademark office.\n\nStill have questions about trade names vs. business names?

It's often used for branding and marketing purposes.\n\nDo trade names provide legal protection for the business name?\n\nNo, trade names don't provide legal protection by themselves. Legal protection requires registering the name as a trademark.\n\nCan a business have more than one trade name?\n\nYes, a business can operate under multiple trade names. Each name can target different markets or product lines.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a trade name and a trademark?\n\nA trade name identifies the business, while a trademark protects brands or products. Trademarks offer legal protection; trade names do not.\n\nBrette Sember, J.D. contributed to this article."
