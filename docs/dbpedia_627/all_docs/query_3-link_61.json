        "text": "Beginning May 7, 2025, you will need to show a REAL ID-compliant document to board a plane for domestic travel or to enter certain federal facilities, military bases and nuclear power plants. If your driver's license or state ID card is not REAL ID compliant, you may show another form of acceptable documentation, such as a valid U.S. passport or passport card. The Transportation Security Administration has published a list of accepted documents.\n\nStandard Michigan driver's licenses or ID cards: After May 7, 2025, your standard Michigan driver's license remains valid for driving, and a standard license and state ID continue to be legal identification for cashing checks, renting vehicles, purchasing alcohol and tobacco, or entering casinos. A standard license or ID card will have \"Not for Federal Identification\" printed on it.\n\nAll state-issued identification will be accepted when voters are asked to show valid ID when voting. Regardless of whether a voter has a standard, enhanced or REAL ID-compliant driver's license or ID card, the voter's card will be accepted as valid identification. Voters who do not have valid state-issued identification or another accepted identity document may sign an Affidavit of Identity.\n\nIf you are a lawfully present non-U.S. citizen, including permanent and non-permanent residents, you are eligible to apply for a REAL ID driver's license or ID card or turn your current Michigan driver's license or state ID into a REAL ID. In either case, you'll need to schedule an office visit at a Michigan Secretary of State branch office and bring the required legal presence document. It's important to note that some documents already in the possession of non-US citizens qualify as REAL ID and will be acceptable for flying domestically when the law goes into effect on May 7, 2025. These include:\n\nPermanent resident card\n\nForeign government-issued passport\n\nCanadian provincial driver's license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card (I-766)"
