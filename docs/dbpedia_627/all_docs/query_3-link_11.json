        "text": "There are several ways to change a legal name in Texas. Depending on the situation, you may be able to:\n\nget a court order changing your legal name;\n\nchange your legal name as part of adoption, divorce, gender marker change, or U.S. naturalization;\n\nchange your legal name without a court order.\n\nName changes for children under 18 years old must be requested by the child's parents.\n\nChanging your name through a court order\n\nAll Texas residents can apply for a name change under Texas Family Code Chapter 45. This chapter defines the formal process for changing a legal name through the courts. A person may request to change their name for any reason, except for reasons against the public interest. The judge will consider the best interests of the applicant and the public when making the decision.\n\nParents wanting to change their child's name after a divorce or modification to parental rights may have to apply for a court order using this process.\n\nSee the following pages for information, instructions, and forms:\n\nName Changes for Adults\n\nName Changes for Children\n\nChanging your name during another legal proceeding\n\nA name change can also be a part of a larger legal proceeding like an adoption, divorce, naturalization, or a gender marker change. You may be able to request a name change in the same application. For more information, see the pages on:\n\nName Changes Through Adoption\n\nName Changes Through Divorce\n\nName Changes and Gender Marker Change\n\nName Changes Through Naturalization\n\nChanging your name without a court order\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to change your name without a court order. This is commonly done after marriage, but a few other situations may qualify.\n\nMarriage\n\nIf you want to take your spouse's last name after marriage, you likely won't need a court order. For more information, see the page on:\n\nName Changes After Marriage\n\nBirth Certificate Errors\n\nSome errors on a birth certificate may be corrected without a court order. This includes some hospital errors and minor spelling mistakes. Texas Vital Statistics has more information about making changes to a birth certificate:\n\nChanges to a Texas Driver's License or ID\n\nTo change your name on a Texas driver's license or ID, you'll usually have to show some proof of the name change. The proof might be a certified copy of a court order, a marriage license, or another document. Texas Administrative Code Title 37, Rule 15.23(1) makes several exceptions to this rule.\n\nYou may not have to provide proof of a name change if:\n\nYou have a hyphenated last name, but want to list only one of the last names; or\n\nYou have multiple last names, but want to list only one of the last names.\n\nSome life events may also qualify if you want to go back to a name you had before the life event:\n\nAnnulment of marriage;\n\nDivorce; or\n\nDeath of a spouse.\n\nContact the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) to learn what you'll need to bring to your appointment.\n\nOther agencies, such as Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of State, and Texas Department of Vital Statistics, may have different requirements. You should check with each agency to determine if you'll be able to change your name without a court order."
