        "text": "Congress passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as Title X, to protect families from exposure to lead from paint, dust, and soil. Section 1018 of this law directed HUD and EPA to require the disclosure of known information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards before the sale or lease of most housing built before 1978.\n\nWhat is Required?\n\nBefore ratification of a contract for housing sale or lease, sellers and landlords must:\n\nGive an EPA-approved information pamphlet on identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards (\"Protect Your Family From Lead In Your Home\" pamphlet, currently available in many languages, English, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), French Korean, Polish, Russian Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese.).\n\nDisclose any known information concerning lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. The seller or landlord must also disclose information such as the location of the lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards, and the condition of the painted surfaces.\n\nProvide any records and reports on lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards which are available to the seller or landlord (for multi-unit buildings, this requirement includes records and reports concerning common areas and other units, when such information was obtained as a result of a building-wide evaluation).\n\nInclude an attachment to the contract or lease (or language inserted in the lease itself) which includes a Lead Warning Statement and confirms that the seller or landlord has complied with all notification requirements. This attachment is to be provided in the same language used in the rest of the contract. Sellers or landlords, and agents, as well as homebuyers or tenants, must sign and date the attachment.\n\nSellers must provide homebuyers a 10-day period to conduct a paint inspection or risk assessment for lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. Parties may mutually agree, in writing, to lengthen or shorten the time period for inspection. Homebuyers may waive this inspection opportunity.\n\nTypes of Housing Covered?\n\nMost private housing, public housing, Federally owned housing, and housing receiving Federal assistance are affected by this rule.\n\nEffective Dates\n\nThe regulations became effective on September 6, 1996 for transactions involving owners of more than 4 residential dwellings and on December 6, 1996 for transactions involving owners of 1 to 4 residential dwellings.\n\nRecordkeeping\n\nSellers and lessors must retain a copy of the disclosures for no less than three years from the date of sale or the date the leasing period begins.\n\nWhat Can You Do?"
