        "text": "Man-made disasters have an element of human intent, negligence, or error involving a failure of a man-made system, as opposed to natural disasters resulting from natural hazards. Such man-made disasters are crime, arson, civil disorder, terrorism, war, biological/chemical threat, cyber-attacks, etc.\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear among the public to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism and to get immediate publicity for their causes.\n\nActs of terrorism range from threats of terrorism, assassinations, kidnappings, hijackings, bomb scares and bombings, and cyber attacks (computer-based), to the use of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n\nHigh-risk targets include military and civilian government facilities, international airports, large cities, and high-profile landmarks. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. Further, they are capable of spreading fear by sending explosives or chemical and biological agents through the mail.\n\nIn the immediate area of a terrorist event, you would need to rely on police, fire, and other officials for instructions. However, you can prepare in much the same way you would prepare for other crisis events.\n\nPreparing for Terrorism\n\nWherever you are, be aware of your surroundings. The very nature of terrorism suggests there may be little or no warning.\n\nTake precautions when traveling. Be aware of conspicuous or unusual behavior. Do not accept packages from strangers. Do not leave luggage unattended. Unusual behavior, suspicious packages, and strange devices should be promptly reported to the police or security personnel.\n\nDo not be afraid to move or leave if you feel uncomfortable or if something does not seem right.\n\nLearn where emergency exits are located in buildings you frequent. Notice where exits are when you enter unfamiliar buildings. Plan how to get out of a building, subway or congested public area or traffic. Note where staircases are located. Notice heavy or breakable objects that could move, fall or break in an explosion.\n\nAssemble a disaster supply kit at home and learn first aid. Separate the supplies you would take if you had to evacuate quickly, and put them in a backpack or container, ready to go.\n\nBe familiar with different types of fire extinguishers and how to locate them. Know the location and availability of hard hats in buildings in which you spend a lot of time.\n\nBomb Threats\n\nIf you receive a bomb threat, get as much information from the caller as possible. Keep the caller on the line and record everything that is said. Then notify the police and the building management if applicable.\n\nIf you are notified of a bomb threat, do not touch any suspicious packages. Clear the area around suspicious packages and notify the police immediately. In evacuating a building, don't stand in front of windows, glass doors or other potentially hazardous areas. Do not block sidewalk or streets to be used by emergency officials or others still exiting the building.\n\nSuspicious Parcels & Letters\n\nBe wary of suspicious packages and letters. They can contain explosives, chemical or biological agents. Be particularly cautious at your place of employment. Some typical characteristics postal inspectors have detected over the years, which ought to trigger suspicion, include parcels that:\n\nAre unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you\n\nAre marked with restrictive endorsements, such as \"Personal,\" \"Confidential\" or \"Do not x-ray\"\n\nHave protruding wires or aluminum foil, strange odors, or stains\n\nShow a city or state in the postmark that doesn't match the return address\n\nAre of unusual weight, given their size, or are lopsided or oddly shaped\n\nAre marked with any threatening language\n\nHave inappropriate or unusual labeling\n\nHave excessive postage or excessive packaging material such as masking tape and string\n\nHave misspellings of common words\n\nAre addressed to someone no longer with your organization or are otherwise outdated\n\nHave incorrect titles or title without a name\n\nAre not addressed to a specific person\n\nHave handwritten or poorly typed addresses\n\nWith suspicious envelopes and packages other than those that might contain explosives, take these additional steps against possible biological and chemical agents:"
