        "text": "John and Kelly understand that a name is one of the most important parts of their auto repair shop. They want something unique, but which also clearly reflects the type of business they operate.\n\nJohn and Kelly brainstorm and come up with several potential names for their business. They consider how each name will look on signs and in advertisements. They ultimately choose the name “J&K Auto Repair.” It’s professional, personal (using the first initial of each of their first names), and straightforward.\n\nA quick online search shows that no nearby businesses have a similar name. But John and Kelly don’t want to infringe on any existing trademark, which could cause them legal trouble. They use the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s trademark search tool and learn that the name — or any variation of it — is not trademarked, so they’re free to use it.\n\nNow that they’ve picked a name for the business, they start to build its presence online. John and Kelly create a Facebook page for their business, adding the address, hours, and phone number, as well as photos of the building.\n\nJohn and Kelly’s auto repair shop has a unique name that potential clients can easily find online."
