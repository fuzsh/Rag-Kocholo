The moral tone is plain.\n\nShe is kind to the old blind man.\n\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write. Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson numbers.\n\nThe form of contractions includes a space.

EP 118\n\nPreface (3)\n\nIn the SIXTH READER, the general plan of the revision of McGUFFEY'S SERIES has been carefully carried out to completion.\n\nThat plan has been to retain, throughout, those characteristic features of McGUFFEY'S READERS, which have made the series so popular, and caused their widespread use throughout the schools of the country. At the same time, the books have been enlarged; old pieces have been exchanged for new wherever the advantage was manifest; and several new features have been incorporated, which it is thought will add largely to the value of the series.\n\nIn the revision of the SIXTH READER, the introductory matter has been retained with but little change, and it will he found very valuable for elocutionary drill. In the preparation of this portion of the work, free use was made of the writings of standard authors upon Elocution, such as Walker, McCulloch, Sheridan Knowles, Ewing, Pinnock, Scott, Bell, Graham, Mylins, Wood, Rush, and many others.\n\nIn making up the Selections for Reading, great care and deliberation have been exercised. The best pieces of the old book are retained in the REVISED SIXTH, and to the these been added a long list of selections from the best English and American literature. Upwards of one hundred leading authors are represented (see Alphabetical List. of Authors, page ix), and thus a wide range of specimens of the best style has been secured. Close scrutiny revealed the fact that many popular selections common to several series of Readers, had been largely adapted, but in McGUFFEY'S REVISED READERS, wherever it was possible to do so, the selections have been compared, and made to conform strictly with the originals as they appear in the latest editions authorized by the several writers.\n\nThe character of the selections, aside from their elocutionary value, has also been duly considered. It will be found, upon examination, that they present the same instructive merit and healthful moral tone which gave the preceding edition its high reputation.\n\nTwo new features of the REVISED SIXTH deserve especial attention—the explanatory notes, and the biographical notices of authors. The first, in the absence of a large number of books of reference, are absolutely necessary, in some cases, for the intelligent reading of the piece; and it is believed that in all cases they will add largely to the interest and usefulness of the lessons.\n\nThe biographical notices, if properly used, are hardly of less value than the lessons themselves. They have been carefully prepared, and are intended not only to add to the interest of the pieces, but to supply information usually obtained only by the separate study of English and American literature.\n\nThe illustrations of the REVISED SIXTH READER are presented as specimens of fine art. They are the work of the best artists and engravers that could be secured for the purpose in this country. The names of these gentlemen may be found on page ten.\n\nThe publishers would here repeat their acknowledgments to the numerous friends and critics who have kindly assisted in the work of revision, and would mention particularly President EDWIN C. HEWETT, of the State Normal University, Normal, Illinois, and the HON. THOMAS W. HARVEY, of Painesville, Ohio, who have had the revision of the SIXTH READER under their direct advice.\n\nEspecial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co., for their permission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions of many of the foremost American authors whose works they publish.

(11)\n\nThe subject of Elocution, so far as it is deemed applicable to a work of this kind, will be considered under the following heads, viz:\n\n1. ARTICULATION. 4. READING VERSE. 2. INFLECTION. 5. THE VOICE. 3. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS. 6. GESTURE.\n\nI. ARTICULATION. (11)\n\nArticulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and of their combinations.\n\nAs words consist of one or more elementary sounds, the first object of the student should he to acquire the power of uttering those sounds with distinctness, smoothness, and force. This result can be secured only by careful practice, which must be persevered in until the learner has acquired a perfect control of his organs of speech.\n\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS. (12)\n\nAn Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of speech.\n\nThe Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,\n\nSubvocals, and Aspirates.\n\nVOCALS. (12)\n\nVocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most prominent elements of all words, and it is proper that they should first receive attention. A vocal may be represented by one letter, as in the word hat, or by two or more letters, as in heat, beauty. A diphthong is a union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other. It is usually represented by two letters, as in the words oil, boy, out, now.\n\nEach of these can he uttered with great force, so as to give a distinct expression of its sound, although the voice be suddenly suspended, the moment the sound is produced. This is done by putting the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper position, and then expelling each sound from the throat in the same manner that the syllable ah! is uttered in endeavoring to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus, a'—a'—a'—.\n\nLet the pupil he required to utter every one of the elements in the Table with all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to do it with ease and accuracy. This must not he considered as accomplished until he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the suddenness of the crack of a rifle. Care must be taken that the vocal alone be heard; there must be no consonantal sound, and no vocal sound other than the one intended.\n\nAt first, the elementary sounds may be repeated by the class in concert; then separately.\n\nTABLE OF VOCALS. (13)\n\nLong Sounds.\n\nSound as in\n\na hate e err a hare i pine a pass o no a far oo cool a fall u tube e eve u burn\n\nShort Sounds.\n\nSound as in\n\na mat o hot e met oo book i it u us\n\nDiphthongs. oi, oy, as in oil, boy. ou, ow, as in out, now.\n\nREMARK I.—In this table, the short sounds are nearly or quite the same, in quantity, as the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in quality. Let the pupil determine this fact by experiment.\n\nREMARK II.—The vocals are often represented by other letters or combinations of letters than those used in the table: for instance, a is represented by ai as in hail, by ea as in steak, etc.\n\nREMARK III.—As a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be articulated with full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance. Weakness of speech follows a failure to observe the first point, while drawling results from carelessness with respect to the second.\n\nSUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES (13)\n\nSubvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less obstructed.\n\nAspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.\n\nWords ending with subvocal sounds may be selected for practice on the subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for practice on aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly, several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and elements, at first, in concert; then separately.\n\nTABLE OF SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.

In articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice on these cognates.\n\nThe following subvocals and aspirate have no cognates:\n\nSUBVOCAL as in\n\nl mill ng sing m rim r rule n run y yet\n\nASPIRATE.\n\nh, as in hat.\n\nSUBSTITUTES.

INFLECTION. (18)\n\nInflection is a bending or sliding of the voice either upward or downward.\n\nThe upward or rising inflection is an upward slide of the voice, and is marked by the acute accent, thus, ('); as,\n\nDid you call'? Is he sick'?\n\nThe downward or falling inflection is a downward slide of the voice, and is marked by the grave accent, thus, ('); as,\n\nWhere is London'? Where have you been'?\n\nSometimes both the rising and falling inflections are given to the same sound. Such sounds are designated by the circumflex, thus, (v) or thus, (^). The former is called the rising circumflex; the latter, the falling circumflex; as,\n\nBut nobody can bear the death of Clodius.\n\nWhen several successive syllables are uttered without either the upward or downward slide, they are said to be uttered in a monotone, which is marked thus, (—); as,\n\nRoll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean—roll\n\nEXAMPLES. (19)\n\nDoes he read correctly' or incorrectly'?\n\nIn reading this sentence, the voice should slide somewhat as represented in the following diagram:\n\nDoes he read cor-rectly or incorrect-ly?\n\nIf you said vinegar, I said sugar,\n\nTo be read thus:\n\nIf you said vinegar, I said sugar,\n\nIf you said yes, I said no.\n\nTo be read thus:\n\nIf you said yes, I said no.\n\nWhat! did he say no?\n\nTo be read thus:\n\nWhat! did he say no?\n\nHe did'; he said no',\n\nTo be read thus;\n\nHe did; he said no.\n\nDid he do it voluntarily', or involuntarily'?\n\nTo be read thus:\n\nDid he do it voluntarily, or involuntarily?\n\nHe did it voluntarily', not involuntarily',\n\nTo be read thus:\n\nHe did it voluntarily, not involuntarily.\n\nEXERCISES.

(21)\n\nRULE I.—Sentences, and parts of sentences which make complete sense in themselves, require the falling inflection.\n\nEXAMPLES. (21)\n\n1. By virtue we secure happiness'.\n\n2. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven': I will exalt my throne above the stars of God': I will sit, also, upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north'.\n\n3. The wind and the rain are over'; calm is the noon of the day\\: the clouds are divided in heaven'; over the green hills flies the inconstant sun'; red through the stormy vale comes down the stream'.\n\n4. This proposition was, however, rejected,' and not merely rejected, but rejected with insult'.\n\nException.—Emphasis sometimes reverses this rule, and requires the rising inflection, apparently for the purpose of calling attention to the idea of an unusual manner of expressing it.\n\nEXAMPLES. (21)\n\n1. I should not like to ride in that car'. 2. Look out! A man was drowned there yesterday'. 3. Presumptuous man! the gods' take care of Cato',\n\nRULE II.—The language of emphasis generally requires the falling inflection.\n\nEXAMPLES. (22)\n\n1.

(23)\n\nRULE IV.—The rising inflection is generally used where the sense is dependent or incomplete.\n\nREMARK.—This inflection is generally very slight, requiring an acute and educated ear to discern it, and it is difficult to teach pupils to distinguish it, though they constantly use it. Care should be taken not to exaggerate it.\n\nEXAMPLES. (23)\n\n1. Nature being exhausted', he quietly resigned himself to his fate.\n\n2. A chieftain to the Highlands bound',\n\nCries', Boatman, do not tarry!\n\n3. As he spoke without fear of consequences', so his actions were marked with the most unbending resolution,\n\n4.

Ye crags' and peaks', I'm with you once again.\n\nException 1.—Relative emphasis often reverses this and the first rule, because emphasis is here expressed in part by changing the usual inflections.\n\nEXAMPLES. (23)\n\n1. If you care not for your property', you surely value your life'.\n\n2. If you will not labor for your own' advancement, you should regard that of your children'.\n\n3. It is your place to obey', not to command'.\n\n4.

O Hubert', Hubert', save me from these men.\n\nRULE V.—Negative sentences and parts of sentences, usually require the rising inflection.\n\nEXAMPLES. (24)\n\n1. It is not by starts of application that eminence can be attained'.\n\n2. It was not an eclipse that caused the darkness at the crucifixion of our Lord'; for the sun and moon were not relatively in a position' to produce an eclipse'.\n\n3.

I can not say, sir, which of these motives influence the advocates of the bill before us; a bill', in which such cruelties are proposed as are yet unknown among the most savage nations.\n\nRISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS. (26)\n\nRULE VIII.—Words and members of a sentence expressing antithesis or contrast, require opposite inflections.\n\nEXAMPLES. (26)\n\n1. By honor' and dishonor'; by evil' report and good' report; as deceivers' and yet true'.\n\n2. What they know by reading', I know by experience'.\n\n3.
