        "text": "Having a business website is an essential part of your online presence. Your website:\n\nis part of your business identity and branding\n\nallows you to communicate with your customers and enables them to get in touch with you\n\ncan enable you to sell products and deliver services online.\n\nTaking your business online video\n\nThis video introduces the steps to consider when you're preparing to launch or improve your business website.\n\nThis video covers:\n\ndomain names and hosting\n\ndifferent approaches to building a website\n\nwhat content to include in your website\n\nSEO.\n\nStep 1: Get a domain name and URL\n\nIt's important to choose a good domain name. It affects:\n\nhow easily customers can find your site\n\nhow much customers will trust your website and brand\n\nyour intellectual property and trademark protection.\n\nYour domain name is part of your URL (unique resource locator). A URL is a website's address on the internet. It makes it possible for customers to get to your website.\n\nA URL is made up of the following parts:\n\nHTTP or HTTPS: if a website has a security certificate (SSL), the first part of the URL will be HTTPS. If thereâ€™s no security certificate, it will be HTTP\n\nwww: shows that this is a website displayed on the World Wide Web\n\ndomain name: the name of your website, for example, mydomainname\n\ndomain name extension: the part of the URL following the domain name, for example, .com or .au.\n\nWhen building your online presence, it's very important to maintain brand consistency. Your domain name should ideally be identical to, or as close as possible to, your business name.\n\nReferring to your business in the same way online:\n\ncreates a professional online presence\n\nhelps your customers find you online\n\nhelps your business maintain a strong brand image\n\nprevents confusion between your brand and other brands\n\nlimits development costs for logos, packaging, and printed materials.\n\nUse your business name across all digital platforms, including your:\n\nwebsite domain name\n\nsocial media usernames\n\nemail addresses\n\nusernames on other online platforms.\n\nFind more information on how to do this below.\n\nYour domain name should be easy to remember and type into a browser.\n\nDon't:\n\nmake it too long (for example, thebestcarsinbrisbane.com.au)\n\nuse hyphens or underscores (for example, the_best-cars-in-brisbane.com.au)\n\nuse unfamiliar acronyms (for example, TBCIB.com.au)\n\nuse zeros or numbers in place of the letters (for example, th3_b3st_c4rs_in_brisb4ne.com.au)\n\nuse incorrect spelling (for example, bstcarsinbrisban)\n\nuse slang or jargon (for example, thebestcarsin_Brissy.com.au), unless this matches your business name.\n\nYou can check if your chosen domain name is available:\n\non websites that sell domain names\n\nthe Australian Government business and domain name check.\n\nTo maintain brand consistency, also check if it's available as a username on social media platforms. The fastest way to check domain-name and username availability is to use a name-checker service like Namecheckr.\n\nOnce you've selected your domain name, you'll need to choose a suitable domain name extension. A domain name extension is the part of the URL that shows where the domain name is registered.\n\nThe most common choice for Australian businesses is .com.au. It:\n\nshows a business is registered in Australia\n\nis trusted by the local market.\n\nNote: To use .com.au, you must have a registered Australian business with an Australian Business Number (ABN).\n\nOther standard domain name extension are:\n\n.com: Short for 'commercial'. Used by American or international businesses. Suitable for international trade, where trust from the local market is not as relevant\n\n.org: Short for 'organisation'. Not a restricted-use extension, but it's strongly associated with not-for-profit organisations and is recommended for businesses with this structure\n\n.co: Short for 'company'. Not very commonly used. Not the most recommended choice\n\n.biz: Short for 'business'. Not very commonly used. Not the most recommended choice\n\n.net: Short for 'network'. A business extension that is used by some service providers and technology companies. It's generally not the first choice for a standard business format\n\n.edu: Short for 'education'. A restricted extension, only available to official education institutions\n\n.gov: Short for 'government'. A restricted extension, only available to official government institutions\n\n.au: Introduced in 2022 for Australian businesses as an alternative (or additional domain) to .com.au. Read more about .au direct.\n\nThere are also other extension options (for example, .tv), but the renewal costs can be much more expensive than the standard ones mentioned above.\n\nMany businesses buy more than one domain name extension for their domain name. If customers enter .com instead of.com.au, for example, it will still take customers to your site. Buying both extensions can also help prevent online confusion about which company is yours. The administrator of Australia's .au top level domain offers a list of accredited providers to buy your domain name from.\n\nRenew your domain\n\nYour domain name will need to be renewed so it doesn't expire. The renewal period is set when you buy the domain name. You can often choose an initial term of 1, 3, 5, or 10 years.\n\nIf your domain name expires:\n\nyour website won't work\n\ncustomers won't be able to find you\n\nyour business will be vulnerable to cyber crime\n\nyour domain name may be relisted for sale\n\nyou may lose your domain name.\n\nYou'll also need to renew your site's secure certificate (SSL) if you have one.\n\nRemember to renew\n\nSet up a reminder to renew your domain names and security certificates on time.\n\nRead more about the risks of abandoned domain names.\n\nStep 2: Set up an email address to match your domain name\n\nYou can use free email services for your business, but using one that matches your domain (and business) name, creates a more professional impression.\n\nFor example, your domain-name email will display as info@mybusiness.com, instead of mybusiness@gmail.com.\n\nThe service provider who registers your domain name, or your web hosting company, may provide an email service or include it as a paid add-on.\n\nStep 3: Find a web hosting company\n\nFor your website to be published and accessible on the internet, it has to be hosted by a web hosting company. These companies provide you with a secure space on their server to store all your website content.\n\nYou can host your website with the same company you register your domain name with, or you can choose a different host if this meets your business needs better.\n\nMonthly fees for web hosting can vary depending on how big your website is and how many visits you get.\n\nWeb hosting companies offer different services to support your online presence, including:\n\nwebsite space: The files that make up your website are stored on the web hosts server. The allocated space must suit the intended size of your site.\n\nemail accounts: An email is a necessary contact form for your customers to connect with you. An email address using your domain name will give a more professional appearance.\n\ndatabases: Depending on your type of website/business, you may need to start and maintain a database of information, for example, stock for an online store, or customer information for user accounts.\n\nback-ups: You should always have your data and files backed up, so you don't lose essential information if something goes wrong.\n\nwebsite templates: A premade website design is one way to get a website up and running quickly. There are many options available, and there will likely be one to suit your needs.\n\nwebsite building tools: Most do-it-yourself website solutions will provide easy and intuitive ways to create and manage your website though premade drag-and-drop components.\n\nplugins: A plugin is a small program designed to complete a specific purpose. Many services offer plugins to add functionality to your website. For example, an advanced shopping-cart system, or a simple product-rating system.\n\nsecurity certificates (SSL): Security certificates are a way for customers and website visitors to know your website is safe. A secure site can also rank better in search engine results.\n\nfurther help: Access to experienced professionals who can help troubleshoot and solve issues to ensure your website is live and functional with minimal downtime.\n\nWhen choosing a web service or hosting provider, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat customer support is available? Select a provider that offers the level of support you need, depending on your\n\nlevel of technical skill\n\nfamiliarity with website management\n\ntime available.\n\nHow much storage is included? You'll need to select a package that includes the amount of file storage you think you'll need. You may want to start with a smaller package with an option to upgrade as required. If you're unsure, the provider's support contact can likely help you with this.\n\nHow much bandwidth will you need? It's often better to start with lower bandwidth and upgrade as needed. The amount of bandwidth you need will depend on\n\nthe type of content you have on your website\n\nhow many visitors you expect.\n\nDo you value quality over quantity? Providers offering 'unlimited' storage might offer slower website load speeds. This could have negative effects on your business. Check the details of a provider's offerings before making a decision.\n\nDo you store and protect customer's personal details and payment information? Understand the security options offered by different providers so you can protect your customers' personal details, payment information and buying history.\n\nDo you own the domain name? To ensure you own your domain name entirely, consider getting it first, through a different party than your website builder or hosting provider. Research all options and choose one that suits your business needs.\n\nWhat is the payment cycle? Can you pay your hosting fees weekly, monthly, or annually? Can you easily cancel and change providers?\n\nHow easy will it be to maintain and update your website? Does the provider offer easy-to-use options like dashboards and control panels?\n\nDo reviews on the hosting company match your needs? Check online reviews before choosing a provider. Other users' experiences can provide valuable insight into the quality of the service you can expect.\n\nWhich content management systems (CMS) do they offer? A good CMS handles the background infrastructure of your website and makes it easy for you to focus on the front-end (the part your customers will see). Research the CMS online, including looking at reviews, to see if it suits your needs.\n\nStep 4: Design your website\n\nWhen designing your website, think about:\n\nthe information you want to give your customers\n\nwhat you want them to do on your site\n\nthe questions they'll have\n\nthe order they'll be doing things in.\n\nStructure the site to make it easy for them to find and do the things they need. It might help to look at websites of businesses like yours to see how they've designed their site and what features they've added.\n\nA well-designed and easy-to-use website will help your business stand out.\n\nAn easy way to understand what you may need for your website is to draw up a visual site map.\n\nTypically, you'd want a page dedicated to each product range or critical service you offer.\n\nDownload the quick reference site map example\n\nTranscript of site map graphic\n\nQuick reference: Create a visual site map\n\nAn easy way to understand what you may need for your website is to draw up a visual site map. See our example of a site map (JPG, 140KB).\n\nThis example will show you how a visual map can:\n\nshow the layout of every page on your proposed website and how these pages link together\n\ngive a clear overall picture of the website's scope\n\nhelp you decide if it will be easy to create it yourself or if a web developer may be a better option.\n\nStep 5: Build your website\n\nWhen deciding how to build your website, consider how it will be maintained and how easy it will be to make changes. You might need to make regular changes to the content on your website, for example:\n\nupdating advertising and adding information on sales and special offers\n\nupdating contact information\n\nreflecting changes in prices, products and services\n\nupdating opening times, for example, for public holidays\n\nchanging the look and feel of your website.\n\nBuilding your website can be a do-it-yourself (DIY) or do-it-for-me (DIFM) project. You can create your business website by:\n\nusing a template-based website builder (DIY)\n\nusing a content management system (CMS) to build a customised website (DIY or DIFM)\n\nhiring a professional web developer (DIFM).\n\nConsidering the advantages and disadvantages of each option will help you decide which one will work best for you.\n\nThese programs enable you to build your site yourself. You can choose from a selection of pre-made website templates and add your own content.\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt's simple and easy to use.\n\nYou can easily add images and content into pre-designed spaces.\n\nBudget-friendly options are available.\n\nHosting is often included.\n\nSearch engine optimisation (SEO) may already be built in.\n\nThe platform might offer basic technical support through email and chat.\n\nIt's a fast way to get a site live and online.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThere's less opportunity to be creative.\n\nTemplates might only offer limited customisation.\n\nOther businesses may have a similar website to yours.\n\nIt offers only basic website functionality.\n\nThere's less flexibility to give your customers' a personalised experience.\n\nIt may be difficult to save or download your content if you later decide to use a different way to create a website.\n\nA CMS allows you to build a website without knowing or understanding code. You can select a theme for your website and then add content to it.\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt offers more opportunities to be creative and to customise your site than a templated site.\n\nYou can use plugins to add functions like shopping and chat.\n\nOffers different options to fit your budget.\n\nOffers a range of design templates to work with.\n\nIt's widely supported by web developers if you need support.\n\nYou can manage it yourself and have full control.\n\nIt can be cost effective over the long term.\n\nIt is suitable for larger sites and can be readily expanded.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe level of customer support you'll get depends on the hosting partner.\n\nIt requires more technical skills than a template-based site.\n\nIt can feel overwhelming and be time-consuming to build if you have little technical skill.\n\nThis option uses the services of a professional to build your website for you.\n\nAdvantages\n\nYou don't need any technical skills.\n\nYou have full customer support until the website is launched.\n\nThe website can be customised to meet your needs.\n\nYou have the benefit of professional design ideas and experience.\n\nOver time, your website can become bigger and more complex website without constraints.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt can be expensive.\n\nIt's dependent on the web developer's schedule.\n\nIt's not easy to assess a developer's actual skillset before hiring one.\n\nRedesign edits back and forth can be time consuming.\n\nThere's often a charge to have edits made after the website has gone live.\n\nYou'll have less control to make changes and will have to pay for ongoing maintenance.\n\nRemember mobile devices\n\nYour website should display correctly on smart phones and other mobile devices.\n\nWeb builders and CMS platforms automatically include mobile optimisation in their products.\n\nIf you hire a web developer, find out if mobile optimisation is included in the build, or if they'll charge extra for it.\n\nStep 6: Add and manage your website content\n\nOnce you've worked out what content you want on your website, you'll need to create or buy the content.\n\nWebsite content includes things like:\n\nimages\n\nvideos\n\ncopy (written words)\n\ninteractive tools, like calculators and estimators\n\nlanding pages to support promotional campaigns.\n\nHaving relevant and professional content and images will help customers understand your products and services and make them feel comfortable about doing business with you.\n\nJust as you might hire a professional to design your site or make a video, you might also want to consider hiring a professional to create images or write and structure your content.\n\nAdding images and videos\n\nImages and videos can help:\n\ncapture customer attention\n\npresent your products, services, premises, or previous work in a positive way.\n\nPhotos of your actual products or services are best, but you can supplement this with stock photography and graphics.\n\nRead more about:\n\nadding visual assets to your website\n\ncreating video and streaming content.\n\nWriting website content\n\nThe wording on your website provides customers with the information they need to understand your business, what you offer, and how to access it.\n\nPeople read differently online, so make sure content is easy to read and understand. To do this:\n\nput the most important information first\n\nuse plain language\n\nmake sure content is easy to scan\n\nuse clear headings\n\nkeep paragraphs short and easy to read.\n\nManaging and updating content\n\nIt's important to keep your website content up to date. You should, for example, always make sure that changes to opening hours and prices are reflected on your website.\n\nNew website content, like events, sales and seasonal product promotions, also:\n\nhelps keep your customers interested and engaged\n\nsupports your ranking position in search engine results pages.\n\nYou should:\n\nknow how to update content yourself. This is particularly important if a web developer has built your site for you\n\ninclude a request for basic training in updating content (if you think you need it) when getting quotes from web developers\n\nwrite down the process and keep it secure if it involves login details.\n\nDownload the website function checklist\n\nThe website function checklist suggests elements your website may not yet include. Use the checklist as a guide for improvements or as a plan for future development.\n\nSave the website function checklist to review where you could improve.\n\nStep 7: Publish your website\n\nOnce your site is ready, it will need to be published or made live so it can be found by customers using your domain name.\n\nIt can take a day or two for your website to go live across the internet (a process known as propagating). Take this into account if you've scheduled your website release to coincide with other opening activities.\n\nAlso consider...\n\nFind out how you can improve your website.\n\nRead more about using SEO to get your website seen.\n\nFind out how to get the most out of social media.\n\nRead information, tips and resources on website design, SEO and e-commerce from our Mentoring for Growth mentors.\n\nLearn about using chatbots for business from our Mentoring for Growth mentors.\n\nFind out about cybersecurity for business from our Mentoring for Growth mentors."
