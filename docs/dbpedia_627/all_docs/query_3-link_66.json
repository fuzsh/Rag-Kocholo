        "text": "Who can contribute\n\nIndividuals\n\nAn individual may make contributions to candidates and their authorized committees, subject to limitations.\n\nMinors\n\nAn individual who is under 18 years old may make contributions to candidates and political committees, subject to limitations, if:\n\nThe decision to contribute is made knowingly and voluntarily by the minor;\n\nThe funds, goods or services contributed are owned or controlled by the minor, proceeds from a trust for which he or she is a beneficiary or funds withdrawn by the minor from a financial account opened and maintained in his or her name; and\n\nThe contribution is not made using funds given to the minor as a gift for the purpose of making the contribution, and is not in any way controlled by another individual.\n\nTrusts\n\nA political committee may:\n\nAccept contributions from an individual’s estate made through a testamentary trust, subject to the same limitations and prohibitions that were applicable to the decedent during the decedent’s lifetime.\n\nOnly accept contributions from trusts in which neither the committee nor any officer, director, employee, member, agent, or affiliated organization of the political committee serves as a trustee or exercises any control over any undistributed trust corpus or interest amount.\n\nNote that the committee must disclose the name of the both the trust and the name of the decedent on its report.\n\nContributions may be made from a living (inter vivos) trust as long as the trust’s beneficial owner has control over the use of the trust funds. The contribution should be reported as a contribution from the beneficial owner (as signor on the contribution), rather than from the trust.\n\nSpecial requirements apply to contributions from trusts to presidential campaigns that are eligible for federal matching payments.\n\nLimited liability companies (LLCs)\n\nCorporation vs. partnership\n\nFor purposes of contribution limitations and prohibitions, a limited liability company (LLC) is treated as either a corporation or a partnership.\n\nAn LLC is treated as a corporation if:\n\nIt has chosen to file, under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, as a corporation; or\n\nIt has publicly traded shares.\n\nAn LLC is treated as a partnership if:\n\nIt has chosen to file, under IRS rules, as a partnership; or\n\nIt has made no choice, under IRS rules, as to whether it is a corporation or a partnership.\n\nIf an LLC is treated as a corporation, it is prohibited from making contributions to candidate committees, but it can establish an SSF. It may also give money to independent expenditure-only PACs. If it is considered a partnership, it is subject to the contribution limits for partnerships.\n\nPartnerships\n\nPartnerships are permitted to make contributions according to special rules.\n\nContributions received by a candidate's authorized committees from a partnership may not exceed the limitations. In addition, a contribution from a partnership also counts proportionately against each participating partner’s own limit with respect to the same candidate.\n\nIndian tribes\n\nIn past advisory opinions and enforcement cases, the Commission has determined that an unincorporated tribal entity can be considered a \"person\" under the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act) and thus subject to the various contribution prohibitions and limitations.\n\nPolitical party committees\n\nParty committees may support federal candidates in a variety of ways, including making contributions.\n\nPolitical action committees\n\nSeparate segregated funds\n\nSSFs may make contributions to candidates and to their authorized committees.\n\nNonconnected PACs\n\nGenerally, nonconnected PACs may make contributions to influence federal elections, subject to the Act’s limitations and reporting requirements.\n\nAs nonconnected committees that solicit and accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor organizations and other political committees, Super PACs and Hybrid PACs do not make contributions to candidates.\n\nOther federal campaigns\n\nA candidate’s authorized committees may accept a contribution of up to $2,000 per election from the authorized committee of another federal candidate.\n\nAuthorized committees\n\nAn authorized committee, however, can be affiliated only with another authorized committee of the same candidate. Note that, by definition, an unauthorized committee sponsored by an officeholder (that is, a “leadership PAC”) is not considered to be affiliated with any authorized committees sponsored by the same individual.\n\nState PACs, unregistered local party organizations and nonfederal campaign committees\n\nState PACs, unregistered local party organizations and nonfederal campaign committees (nonfederal committees) may, under certain circumstances, contribute to federal candidates, but:\n\nThe funds that comprise the contribution must come from permissible sources under the Act; and\n\nMaking the contribution may require the nonfederal committee to register with the FEC as a federal political committee, subject to federal laws and regulations.\n\nThe candidate\n\nWhen candidates use or loan their personal funds for campaign purposes, they are making contributions to their campaigns. Unlike other contributions, these candidate contributions are not subject to any limits.\n\nContinue learning\n\nVideo: Contributions 2023-2024\n\nLegal citations\n\nRegulations\n\n11 CFR 100.33\n\nPersonal funds\n\n11 CFR 100.5(e)(6)\n\nPolitical committee\n\n11 CFR 100.5(g)(5)\n\nAffiliated committee\n\n11 CFR 103.3(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(4)\n\nDeposit of receipts and disbursements\n\n11 CFR 110.1(b)(1)\n\nContributions to candidates; designations; and redesignations\n\n11 CFR 110.1(e)\n\nContributions by partnerships\n\n11 CFR 110.1(g)\n\nContributions by limited liability companies (LLC)\n\n11 CFR 110.1(k)(1)\n\nJoint contributions and reattributions\n\n11 CFR 110.3(a)(1)(i)\n\nContribution limitations for affiliated committees\n\n11 CFR 110.4(b)\n\nContributions in the name of another\n\n11 CFR 110.19\n\nContributions by minors\n\n11 CFR 110.20\n\nProhibition on contributions, donations, expenditures, independent expenditures and disbursements by foreign nationals\n\n11 CFR 113.1(g)(6)(iii)\n\nPersonal use\n\n11 CFR 114.2\n\nProhibitions on contributions expenditures and electioneering communications\n\n11 CFR 114.5\n\nSeparate segregated funds\n\n11 CFR 115.2\n\nProhibition\n\n11 CFR 115.4\n\nPartnerships\n\n11 CFR 115.5\n\nIndividuals and sole proprietors\n\n11 CFR 115.6\n\nEmployee contributions or expenditures\n\n11 CFR 9034.2(c)(2)\n\nMatchable contributions\n\nAdvisory opinions\n\nAO 2009-14\n\nAdministration and naming of separate segregated fund by a domestic LLC that is affiliated with the SSF's connected corporation and has a foreign parent\n\nAO 2009-02\n\nExpenditure by single-member LLC\n\nAO 2006-15\n\nDomestic subsidiaries of foreign corporation may donate to state and local elections\n\nAO 2005-20\n\nUse of federal contractor partnership's automated payroll system to allow partners to designate funds from their electronic payroll distributions as contributions to the partnership's nonconnected PAC\n\nAO 2004-02\n\nContributions from testamentary trusts\n\nAO 2003-28\n\nLLCs' nonconnected PAC may become a separate segregated fund\n\nAO 2001-18\n\nAffiliation of LLC PAC and PACs of corporate owners in 60-40 joint venture\n\nAO 2001-07\n\nNonaffiliation of LLC PAC with PACs of its five corporate owners\n\nAO 2000-17\n\nEstablishment of separate segregated fund by subsidiary of foreign corporation\n\nAO 1999-19\n\nContribution from living trust\n\nAO 1996-05\n\nRefunding illegal contributions\n\nAO 1995-19\n\nDiscovering illegal contributions in committee's treasury\n\nAO 1995-15\n\nForeign-owned subsidiary, earmarked contributions and payroll deductions\n\nAO 1993-12\n\nNative American tribe as federal contractor\n\nAO 1992-17\n\nPartnership PAC affiliated with separate segregated funds of corporate partners\n\nAO 1992-16\n\nNonfederal contributions made by foreign parent's U.S. subsidiary\n\nAO 1991-39\n\nContributions suspected of being made in the name of another\n\nAO 1991-01\n\nCredit card contributions to PAC of federal contractor partnership\n\nAO 1990-08\n\nEstablishment of PAC by corporation majority-owned by foreign bank\n\nAO 1985-03\n\nContributions to state campaign by American subsidiary of foreign corporation"
