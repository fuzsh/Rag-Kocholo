The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:03 a.m., in Room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Michael Oxley [chairman of the committee] presiding. Present: Representatives Oxley, Bachus, Castle, Kelly, Gillmor, Biggert, Tiberi, Kennedy, Hensarling, Brown-Waite, Harris, Renzi, Pearce, Price, Davis of Kentucky, McHenry, Frank, Maloney, Velazquez, Watt, Hooley, Carson, Sherman, Lee, Moore of Kansas, Crowley, Clay, Israel, McCarthy, Matheson, Lynch, Scott, Green, Cleaver, Bean, Wasserman Schultz, and Moore of Wisconsin. The Chairman. The committee will come to order. This morning the committee meets to consider a topic we have been hearing about on an almost daily basis during the past few months: data security and its connection to the crime of identity theft. Several recent high-profile security breaches have focused public attention as never before on the vulnerabilities of companies' data security systems. Congress now has to ask: Are we doing enough to protect against the theft and misuse of sensitive commercial information on consumers? Protecting sensitive information is an issue of great importance for all Americans. In recent years, criminals in the United States and abroad have become increasingly inventive in finding ways to access and exploit information systems in order to commit identity theft. According to a Federal Trade Commission estimate, over 10 million Americans are victimized by identity thieves each year, costing consumers and businesses over $55 billion per year, not counting the estimated 300 million hours spent by victims trying to repair damaged credit records. The financial costs are staggering, with over $10,000 stolen in the average fraud. The Financial Services Committee has worked tirelessly over the past several Congresses to identify and enact solutions to this destructive crime. During the 108th Congress, over 100 witnesses came before this committee to testify on the reauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Through that process, under the leadership of the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Bachus, the committee developed an exhaustive record on the need to increase safeguards designed to protect consumers and businesses alike from identity theft. Through bipartisan cooperation on this committee, we ultimately produced strong consumer protection in anti-identity theft legislation known as the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or FACT Act. The FACT Act places new obligations on financial institutions to prevent identity theft, entitles consumers to a free annual credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus and creates a national fraud alert system to simplify a consumer's ability to detect and report fraudulent activity. The FACT Act was signed into law on December 4, 2003, and is currently in the process of being fully implemented by federal regulators in the financial services industry. The federal banking regulators have also been hard at work on other initiatives to protect sensitive information. On March 29, 2005, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and OTS issued final data security standards for depository institutions that are required in Title 5 of Gramm-Leach- Bliley. The standards call for every financial institution to implement a response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to consumer information maintained by the institution and to notify the affected customer as soon as possible. In light of continuing guidance from the regulators, it is my hope that we can focus today on the broader issue of data security and how best to protect sensitive information from being improperly accessed, and ensure that consumers receive prompt and effective notice when sensitive information has been compromised and is likely to have been misused. One of my concerns in this regard is that given the dramatic rise in recent reports on data breaches, there will be a headlong rush toward notification in every instance. When no evidence surfaces to indicate that their information has been misused, consumers may begin to ignore these notices as just that many more pieces of unsolicited junk mail. California recently enacted legislation requiring disclosure of any data security breach to any state resident whose unencrypted personal information was or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person. Only a small percentage of these cases, however, have actually resulted in any fraudulent activity. Other states are considering legislation similar to California's. It is important that this committee take a look at what is being contemplated in the States and consider whether a national breach notification standard will work best for American consumers. I would like to welcome our witnesses to today's hearing, and I look forward to hearing your testimony and working with you to find ways to prevent future data security breaches and continue our efforts to combat identity theft. The Chair's time has expired. I now yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts and the Ranking Member. Mr. Frank. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I yield my time to the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Bean, who has been a very energetic person involved in this, I did want to note: I was somewhat pleased to hear you say that there was some concern, and I assume the industry shares this concern, on too much unsolicited junk mail going to individuals. If they, in fact, the industry is worried about, the financial services industry, about too much unsolicited junk mail going to individuals in this instance, it is a breakthrough, because I have not found them in the past to be terribly sensitive to that. At least my mailbox will welcome this new sensitivity. And I hope it spreads from just notification here to maybe some other areas. And with that I want to yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois, who has been a real leader in this in her very first few months here. Ms. Bean. Thank you, Mr. Frank. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. First, I would like to thank you and Chairman Oxley for your leadership on this very important issue of consumer data security. The recent high-profile data security breaches at ChoicePoint, Bank of America and LexisNexis have continued to fuel ongoing concerns about the safety and security of Americans' personal financial data. These concerns have forced Congress to once again examine how industry and government can work together to better ensure that an individual's private personal information is adequately protected. As a new Member of Congress and a new member of this committee, I am honored to join in this endeavor. I know that many of my colleagues, particularly Representative Hooley, have worked hard on this issue for many years, and I look forward to working with them as we move forward. In March, Americans were shocked to learn that the private data--including Social Security numbers, credit files and personal health information--of nearly 150,000 Americans were sold by ChoicePoint to fraud artists posing as legitimate businesses. However, as illustrated by the subsequent data breaches nationwide, the ChoicePoint case was not an isolated incident. In fact, according to the privacy right center, up to 10 million Americans are victims of I.D. theft each year, and these numbers are on the rise. Even though victims do not usually end up paying their imposters' bills, they are often left with a bad credit report and must spend months and even years regaining their financial health. In a recent profile of an individual who fell victim to identity theft, the Chicago Tribune explained that these victims often learn the hard way that the crime is like a chronic disease that goes into remission only to stir up again when least expected. It is not uncommon that for years after an identity theft, victims have difficulty getting credit, obtaining loans, renting apartments and even getting hired by employers. As the volume of personal data held by corporations, data brokers and business continues to increase, the issue of securing this data and protecting one's privacy takes on particular importance. To begin addressing this issue, in early March I joined with Representative Maloney and Representative Gutierrez in introducing H.R. 1069, the Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act, or H.R. 1069. It is the companion bill to legislation introduced by Senator Feinstein and is based on the California notification law, with which I am sure you are familiar. I believe this bill is a good first step and is based upon sound principles. However, I am mindful that even legislation with the best intentions can create unnecessary and unforeseen burdens. We must find a solution that provides consumer protection but is viable and meaningful in its execution. I am optimistic that this can be done, because I know both consumers, business and Congress sharing a common goal: to keep Americans' personal information secure. I thank the witnesses for testifying before the committee today, and I appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts. I am particularly interested in your testimony as it relates to notification and triggering of notification. I yield back the balance of my time. The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Bachus? Mr. Bachus. I thank the Chairman. I think this is a very important issue, and I think the thing, as we go forward, we ought to remember is that there are different kinds of data or different documents. There are financial documents, there are personal documents, there is credit card information, there is even health records--and all of those can be used to some extent to perpetrate identity theft. Also, that data, sometimes it is stored, sometimes it is disposed of, sometimes the problems are the security in how it is stored, sometimes the problems are how it is disposed of. And there are different institutions that have it, and different laws that apply to that data storage. The FACT Act sets up one standard, Gramm-Leach-Bliley sets up another standard, HIPAA sets up another standard. I think, as a result of the high degree of I.D. theft that we have and the different statutes we have, sometimes there are gaps in the statutes where they may or may not cover certain documents. We do need a national standard. And we need a national standard on notification. If we do not have that, it is going to be simply impossible for businesses to know what to do or how to comply or know what standard. I would think that one thing this committee ought to do is look at the existing law. When we come up with legislation, we ought to at least allow the regulators, the FTC, as they have done in the disposal rules, to fashion some parameters and try not to get too immersed in the finite details as we do this. I want to commend Mr. Castle and Ms. Pryce and others on the other side for pushing this issue. And I would like to yield the balance of my time to Mr. Castle, who has been a leader in this effort. Mr. Castle. I thank the gentleman very much for yielding and, of course, for all his work in this and many other areas in banking. It is clear that we do live in a world that is becoming increasingly complicated in relying on technology and dependent on data for instant decisions. Therefore, I believe, Mr. Chairman, it is worthwhile for us to explore the practicality of requiring data base security and safeguards for most of the public and private sectors, while our financial institutions, as defined by Gramm-Leach-Bliley, are already required to secure their sensitive data. It may be that we should do likewise across other sectors. In the coming weeks, we are planning to introduce a comprehensive bill that in part requires many more databases to have a standard level of protection. In addition, we will define what constitutes a breach so that affected entities, regulators and consumers can be notified when appropriate and in a coordinated manner. I am also pleased to be working with the gentlewoman from Ohio, Ms. Pryce, on this legislation that is intended to adjust a number of these and other concerns. And finally, I am interested in hearing from our panelists about steps they took to ensure the future safety of the breached parties' sensitive information. Some companies have provided free credit monitoring for all those that were subject to the breach. I think this is an enormously positive step that helps consumers and restores confidence and peace of mind to many. So we appreciate you being here. And I appreciate, again, the gentleman yielding. I yield back to the gentleman from Alabama. The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. The gentlelady from Oregon, Ms. Hooley? Ms. Hooley. Thank you, Chairman Oxley and Ranking Member Frank, for convening this hearing today. In my opinion, data security is one of the most important issues that will be brought before this committee in the 109th Congress. Its impact is immense. Consumers, businesses, local and federal law enforcement all have a stake in the manner in which we solve the problem created by data security breaches. I look forward to all of the members that have taken an interest in this, particularly Representative Bean. I look forward to continuing in a bipartisan manner in which this committee has operated in recent past to build a broad consensus for an effective solution. Identity theft represents a fundamental threat to e- commerce, our economy, as well as our homeland security. No longer are we facing just hobbyist hackers creating a nuisance. Increasingly these attacks are driven by skilled criminals. Identity theft is big business. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million to 10 million Americans are victims of identity theft every year to a total cost to business and consumers approaching $50 billion. For that reason, it is imperative that Congress and the private sector work together to make certain that sensitive personal information is protected by adequate safeguards. The committee made progress in this respect in the 108th Congress with the passage of the FACT Act, and now we have to build on that success. This will not be easy. There are many tough questions that need to be answered. First and foremost among them will be how we notify consumers whose information has been compromised. Under what circumstances should they be notified about a breach? When a notice of breach is issued, what information should that notice include? What form should a uniform notice of breach take? These are just a couple of the questions that we are going to have to answer. I am confident that by working together we can find practical solutions that will provide consumers with landmark protections while also avoiding an undue burden on enterprises who possess, for legitimate purposes, very personal information. I thank you and yield back the remainder of my time. The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. We now turn to our distinguished panel. The first witness is Ms. Barbara Desoer, Global Technology, Service and Fulfillment executive from Bank of America followed by Mr. Eugene Foley, president and CEO of Harvard University Employees Credit Union; Mr. Don McGuffey, senior vice president for Data Acquisition and Strategy at ChoicePoint; Mr. Kurt P. Sanford, president and CEO of U.S. Corporate and Federal Government Markets at LexisNexis; and Mr. Bestor Ward, president of Safe Archives-Safe Shredding LLC--which I understand has some Alabama connections, is that right, Mr. Bachus? Mr. Bachus. Yes. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend Mr. Ward for his testimony. I have read his testimony. He represents the NAID and their membership. They are experts and committed to the proper destruction of paper records and other media containing sensitive information financial or personal nature that is often misused by identity thieves. Sometimes we sort of focus on people breaking into data storage, but there is a tremendous need for, as these records are disposed of, to have them properly shredded. And we actually, today, have people that actually dive into the dumpsters and get this information and cause a lot of destruction and pain. I commend Mr. Ward. He is quite an expert on this. He also is on the board of directors of one of the largest banks in the United States and has counseled them and has become an expert in this field. Thank you. The Chairman. The gentleman from Massachusetts is going to introduce one of our witnesses. Mr. Frank. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to have Eugene Foley, who is the president and CEO of the Harvard University Employees Credit Union. The credit union had been speaking with me about problems they have had with regard to breaches of security and the difficult position they have sometimes been put in, vis-a-vis the people who are their credit card holders. They have been caught, I think unfairly, in the middle on some of these cases. So I would particularly even have them talk about addressing this. I appreciate Mr. Foley's willingness to accommodate this. The credit union movement in our state as elsewhere, is a very highly regarded one. He speaks for a very important credit union on an issue that I think is clearly of relevance to all financial institutions, not just the credit unions. The Chairman. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott? Mr. Scott. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I certainly want to take this opportunity to welcome ChoicePoint, Mr. Don McGuffey, for your testimony on this, this morning. As every member of this committee, we have all been following the challenges at ChoicePoint. I certainly want to take this opportunity to commend ChoicePoint for responding to this challenge. It is a difficult one. We certainly want to welcome you here today and certainly look forward to your testimony. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. And the gentleman from Georgia as well, Dr. Price? Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wish to associate my comments with Mr. Scott regarding ChoicePoint. They are located in my district. They have been a wonderful corporate citizen, extremely responsible in dealing with the matters that they have been confronted with. I commend them for that and look forward to their testimony. The Chairman. We now turn to our distinguished panel--and I probably butchered your name. Is it Desoer? Welcome to the committee. STATEMENT OF BARBARA DESOER, EXECUTIVE OF GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY, SERVICE AND FULFILLMENT, BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION Ms. Desoer. Thank you very much. Chairman Oxley, Congressman Frank, committee members, good morning. I am Barbara Desoer, Global Technology Service and Fulfillment executive for Bank of America. I am a member of Chairman and CEO Ken Lewis's direct executive leadership team. On behalf of leadership of our company and all Bank of America associates, thank you for the opportunity to appear here today before this committee to provide our perspective on the loss of computer backup data storage tapes that were reported by Bank of America earlier this year. I would like to express how deeply all of us at Bank of America regret this incident. We pursue our professional mission by helping people manage their financial lives. This work rests on a strong foundation of trust. One of our highest priorities, therefore, is building and maintaining a track record of responsible stewardship of customer information that inspires our customers' confidence and provides them peace of mind. On February 25, 2005, Bank of America began proactively communicating to the United States General Services Administration SmartPay charge cardholders that computer data backup tapes were lost during transport to a backup data center. The missing tapes contained customer and account information for approximately 1.2 million government charge cardholders. The actual data on the tapes varied by cardholder and may have included name, address, account number and Social Security number. Now, backup tapes such as these are created and stored at remote locations as a routine industry contingency practice in the case of any event that might interrupt our ability to service our customers. After the tapes were reported missing, Bank of America notified the GSA, and also engaged the Secret Service, which began a thorough investigation into the matter, working closely with our corporate information team internally. Federal law enforcement initially directed that, to preserve the integrity of the investigation, no communication could take place to the public or the cardholders. While the investigation was moving ahead, we put in place a system to monitor the affected accounts and researched account activity retroactively to the date of the data shipment to identify any unusual or potentially fraudulent activity in the accounts. The Secret Service advised GSA management and us that their investigation revealed no evidence to indicate that the tapes were wrongfully accessed or their content compromised. In mid-February, law enforcement authorities advised that communication to our customers would no longer adversely impact the investigation. Following our initial cardholder notifications, we continued to communicate with our customers to ensure that they understood the additional steps we were taking to help protect their personal information and to assist them with any questions they might have. We established a toll-free number that government charge cardholders could use to call with questions or request additional assistance. We offered credit reports and enhanced fraud-monitoring services to cardholders at our expense. Government cardholder accounts included on the data tapes have been and will continue to be monitored by Bank of America, and cardholders will be contacted should any unusual activity be detected. According to standard Bank of America policy, these cardholders will not be held liable for any unauthorized use of their cards. The incident was unfortunate and regrettable. That said, we feel that it has shed helpful light on a critical element of the industry's practices for data transport. We view this as an opportunity to learn and to lead the industry to better answers that will give our customers the confidence and the security that they deserve. Our recent actions demonstrate our belief that our customers have a right to know when there is reason to conclude that their information may have been compromised and that timely notification in the appropriate circumstances could help to minimize any associated risks. Furthermore, our approach and existing polices and practices also are in accordance with the recently issued Interagency Guidance. We believe this guidance strikes the correct balance with respect to when notification is appropriate and what steps should be taken when a security breach has put a customer's personal information at risk. In our experience, the best solutions often arise out of the work we do together, implemented through the voluntary cooperation of private sector organizations. The information security environment, by its very nature, is fluid and rapidly evolving, and demands solutions and counter-measures that can evolve and advance with speed and flexibility. We look forward to helping promote that speed and flexibility and to taking part in the ensuing legislative dialogue. Members of the committee, I can assure you that all of us at Bank of America will do everything that we can to ensure that our customers can manage their financial lives, secure in the knowledge that their personal information will be respected and protected by the institutions in which they place their trust. This concludes my prepared testimony. I look forward to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Barbara Desoer can be found on page 64 in the appendix.] The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Desoer. Mr. Foley? STATEMENT OF EUGENE FOLEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HARVARD UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION Mr. Foley. Chairman Oxley, Ranking Member Frank, members of the committee, I would first like to thank you for providing this opportunity for me to speak about the impact of data security breaches on the small-community institutions that issue credit and debit cards. Harvard University Credit Union is a $200 million organization located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Currently there are about 4,600 card-issuing credit unions in this country, supporting over 12.5 million accounts for our members. I have experience with this issue not only as the CEO of a credit union that had about 700 of our 10,000 card accounts compromised in just one incident last year but also as a recent victim of identity theft myself. While I was sitting in my office with my own debit card securely in my wallet, my checking account was cleaned out by a series of transactions that happened 3,000 miles away. Although I had other sources of funds to draw on throughout the process of reestablishing my account balance, this is often not the case for many credit union members and small-bank customers who are living paycheck to paycheck. They cannot afford any interruption in their cash flow. Given my position, I am particularly responsive in protecting my own sensitive information. But this caution is meaningless when entities that have captured and retained the data contained on the card stripe are careless or not compliant with security standards. The frequency of large-scale data compromises is increasing, and the smaller card-issuing institutions are struggling to keep up the constant vigilance it takes to immediately react in notifying and crediting our cardholders for their losses. Within the past 2 weeks alone, we have read of three major breaches which have compromised the accounts of millions of American consumers. The first large security breach to have an impact on small banks and credit unions came to light last year as a result of hackers stealing a large amount of consumer information from the retailer, BJ's Wholesale Club. This case exemplifies the merchant in direct violation of card association rules and regulations. While card issuers are required to fastidiously comply with protecting sensitive account data, the resources they expend in this effort are squandered if merchants are not held to the same standard. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal cited a $5.7 million lawsuit filed last month against BJ's Wholesale Club by CUNA Mutual Insurance Corporation on behalf of 163 credit union bondholders. Individual banks have also brought suit for their losses. These costs include not only the amounts lost to fraud, but also the costs for reissuing and blocking cards, for notifying cardholders and monitoring accounts. There are card association rules in place regulating how the consumer information, which is imbedded on the magnetic stripe on the back of each card, should be handled. But these rules have proven to both insufficient and laxly enforced. Absent card association enforcement or legislative redress, banks and credit unions have had to resort to litigation in order to find a remedy for their losses. The surest way to limit the potential damage when a merchant's files are hacked and a large base of card information is stolen is to cancel the existing cards and reissue new cards. As small banks and credit unions hold a close relationship with their cardholders, this is most often the action that they take. It is costly, time consuming and puts a significant strain on the scarce resources we have. Unfortunately, our best effort to protect our members and customers is often met with another penalty by causing the consumer to question the safety and security of the card issuer rather than the merchant who has inadequately safeguarded their personal information. This means that in addition to the significant monetary losses, small banks and credit unions are also unfairly exposed to reputation risk as a result of this problem. Even after a breach has been identified by the merchant, issuing institutions cannot count on getting accurate and timely notification to pass along to the consumer. Most times, the issuer is relying on reports in the media to determine the nature of the breach. Without accurate information, it is impossible to appropriately inform our members as to how their information was stolen, and they are often left with the impression that the bank or credit union is at fault. While we have had the benefit of seeing the California law requiring disclosure of security breaches in action for nearly 2 years, and their experience offers us some guidance, there is room for improvement. It is our hope that the committee will put its authority and energy behind initiatives that will require the major card companies to notify financial institutions immediately in a format that is usable for the affected issuer. That information should include: when a breach occurred, which merchant is responsible for that breach and what accounts are affected. It should also detail what type of personal information was compromised. Specifically, any new statute would benefit from explicit definitions. For example, clarity with regard to which businesses would be covered, along with what constitutes personal information, are areas where the California statute has been questioned. A particular concern is an exclusion that the California law provides for encrypted data. Unfortunately, advances in hacking seem to match advances in encryption, and those that can breach credit files are quite likely to be able to gain access to decryption technology. In addition, to ensure that all consumers have the utmost protection from this insidious threat, we believe that as a best practice all issuers should be required at a minimum to inform consumers when their account has become compromised and their personal financial information has been stolen. These consumers should then have the right to determine if they wish to have their cards canceled and reissued in a timely fashion at no cost to them. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for affording me this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Eugene Foley can be found on page 69 in the appendix.] The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Foley. Mr. McGuffey? STATEMENT OF DON MCGUFFEY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, DATA ACQUISITION, CHOICEPOINT INC. Mr. McGuffey. Chairman Oxley, Ranking Member Frank and members of the committee, good morning. I am Don McGuffey, senior vice president for Data Acquisition and Strategy of ChoicePoint. I have been with the company since its inception in 1997. ChoicePoint has previously provided Congress with testimony about the recent improper data access and the criminals who perpetrated this fraud, the steps we are taking to protect affected consumers and the measures that we are taking to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future. While I have described the company's actions in my written statement to the committee, I would like to specifically offer a sincere apology on behalf of ChoicePoint to those consumers whose information may have been accessed by the criminals who perpetrated this fraud. What I hope you see in ChoicePoint is a company that has listened to consumers, privacy experts and government officials, and learned from this experience. Accordingly, we have responded rapidly and in fundamental ways. We have provided benefits to potential affected consumers that no other information company had done before and that several companies have since emulated, including voluntary nationwide notification, dedicated call centers and Web sites, free three-bureau credit reports and 1 year of credit monitoring at our cost. We learned that there are few places for consumers to turn for help if their identity is stolen. This alone increases the fear and the anxiety associated with identity theft. For this reason, we have recently formed a partnership with the Identify Theft Resource Center, a leading and well-respected nonprofit organization dedicated exclusively to assisting identity theft victims. Most importantly, we have shifted our focus to ensure our products and services provide a direct benefit to consumers or to society as a whole. While this has meant exiting an entire market, we decided that consumers' interests must come first. We have already made broad changes to our products, limiting access to personal identifiable information, and more changes are under development. Mr. Chairman, before delving into the specifics of various policy proposals, as my letter I had requested, perhaps it would be helpful if I give members of the committee a brief overview of our company, the products we provide and some insight as to how we currently are regulated. The majority of transactions our business supports are limited and initiated by consumers. Last year we helped more than 100 million people obtain fairly priced home and auto insurance. More than 7 million Americans get jobs through our pre-employment screening services, and we helped more than 1 million consumers obtain expedited copies of their families' vital records: birth, death and marriage certificates. These transactions were started by consumers with their permission, and they provide a clear, direct benefit to consumers. Not all of our other work is as obvious, but the value of it is. At a time when the news is filled with crimes committed against children, we are helping our nation's religious institutions and youth-serving organizations protect those in our society who are least able to protect themselves. Our products or services have identified 11,000 undisclosed felons among those volunteering or seeking to volunteer with children, 1,055 with convictions for crimes against children, 42 of those felons were registered sex offenders. Consumers, business and nonprofits are not the only ones that rely on ChoicePoint. In fact, government officials have recently testified to Congress that they could not fulfill their mission of protecting our country and its citizens without the help of ChoicePoint and others in our industry. Last month, ChoicePoint supported the U.S. Marshal Service in Opertion Falcon, which served approximately 10,000 warrants in a single day for crimes ranging from murder to white collar fraud. Mr. Chairman, apart from what we do, I also understand that the committee is interested in how our business is regulated at both the Federal and State levels. The majority of our products are already governed by the FCRA and other Federal and State laws, including the recently enacted companion FACT Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, as well State and Federal do- not-call and do-not-mail legislation. We believe consumers benefit from these regulations. While a small percentage of our business is not subject to the same level of regulation, we believe additional regulation will give consumers greater protections. And finally, I want to state for the record ChoicePoint's position on future regulation of our industry. We support independent oversight and increased accountability for those who handle personally identifiable information, including public records. This oversight should extend to all entities, including public sector, academic and other private sector organizations that handle such data. We support a preemptive national law that would provide for notification to consumers and to a single law enforcement point of contact when personally identifiable information has fallen into inappropriate hands, ensuring that the burden of notice follows the responsibility for breach and that consumers do not become desensitized to such notices. ChoicePoint supports providing consumers with the right to access and question the accuracy of public record information used to make decisions about them consistent with the principles of FCRA. There are technical and logistical issues that we will need to solve, but they are solvable. We have already taken steps to restrict the display of full Social Security numbers and would support legislation to restrict the display of full Social Security numbers modeling existing law, including GLB and FCRA, which extending those principles to public record information. We have all witnessed the significant benefits to society that can come with the proper use of information. But we have been reminded, firsthand, the damage that can be caused when people with ill intent access sensitive consumer data. As a company, we have rededicated our efforts to creating a safer, more secure society. We look forward to participating in continued discussions of these issues and will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have. [The prepared statement of Don McGuffey can be found on page 73 in the appendix.] The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. McGuffey. Mr. Sanford, welcome. I might point out that Mr. Sanford's company is located in Dayton, Ohio. Since we had several parochial interests represented in the introductions, I thought I would add that as well. STATEMENT OF KURT SANFORD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, U.S. CORPORATE AND FEDERAL MARKETS, LEXISNEXIS Mr. Sanford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Oxley, Ranking Member Frank and distinguished members of the committee, good morning. My name is Kurt Sanford. I am the president and chief executive officer for corporate and federal markets at LexisNexis. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the important issues surrounding data security, privacy and the protection of consumer information. LexisNexis is a leading provider of authoritative legal, public records and business information. We play a vital role in supporting government, law enforcement and business customers who use our information services for important uses, including detecting and preventing identity theft and fraud, locating suspects, preventing money laundering and finding missing children. LexisNexis products are used by financial institutions to help address the growing problem of identity theft and fraud. In 2004, 9.3 million consumers were victimized by identity fraud. Credit card companies report $1 billion in losses each year from credit card fraud. With the use LexisNexis, a major bank-card issuer experienced a 77 percent reduction in the dollar loses due to fraud associated with identity theft. LexisNexis products are also used to help prevent money laundering. We have partnered with the American Bankers Association to develop a tool used by banks and other financial institutions to verify the identity of new customers to prevent money laundering and other illegal transactions. Finally, LexisNexis works closely with Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies in a variety of criminal investigations. For example, information provided by LexisNexis was recently used to locate and apprehend an individual who threatened a district court judge and his family in Louisiana. These are just a few examples of some of the important ways in which are products are used by our customers. While we work hard to provide our customers with effective products, we also recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of the consumer information in our databases. We have privacy policies, practices and procedures in place to protect this information. Our chief privacy officer and Privacy and Policy Review Board work together to ensure that LexisNexis has strong policies to help safeguard consumer privacy. We also have multi-layered security processes and procedures in place to protect our systems and the information contained in our databases. Maintaining security is not a static process. It requires continuously evaluating and adjusting our security procedures to address the new threats we face everyday. Even with these safeguards, we discovered earlier this year some security incidents at our Seisint business, which we acquired last September. In February 2005, a LexisNexis integration team became aware of some billing irregularities and unusual usage patterns with several customer accounts. Upon further investigation, we discovered that unauthorized persons, using I.D.s and passwords of legitimate Seisint customers, may have accessed personally identifying information such as Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. No personal financial, credit or medical information was involved since LexisNexis and Seisint do not collect that type of information. In March, we notified approximately 30,000 individuals whose personal identifying information may have been unlawfully accessed. Based on these incidents at Seisint, I ordered an extensive review of data security activity going back to January 2003 at our Seisint unit and across all LexisNexis databases that contain personal identifying information. We completed that review on April 11 and concluded that unauthorized persons, primarily using I.D.s and passwords of legitimate Seisint customers, may have accessed personal identifying information on approximately 280,000 individuals. At no point was LexisNexis or Seisint technology infrastructure hacked into or penetrated, and no customer data was accessed or compromised. We sincerely regret these incidents and any adverse impact they may have on the individuals whose information may have been accessed. We took quick action to notify those individuals. We are providing all individuals with a consolidated credit report and credit-monitoring services. For those individuals who do become victims of fraud, we will provide counselors to help them clear their credit reports of any information related to fraudulent activity. We will also provide them with identity theft insurance to cover expenses associated with restoring their identity and repairing their credit reports. We have learned a great deal from the security incidents at Seisint and are making substantial changes in our business practices and policies across all LexisNexis businesses to help prevent any future incidents. I have included details of these enhancements in my written statement. I would like to focus the remainder of my time on policy issues being consider to further enhance data security and address the growing problem of identity theft and fraud. LexisNexis would support the following legislative approaches. First, we support requiring notification in the event of a security breach where there is a significant risk of harm to consumers. In addition, we believe that it is important any such proposal contain Federal preemption. Second, we would support the adoption of data security safeguards modeled after the safeguard rules of GLBA. Finally, it is important that any legislation strike the right balance between protecting privacy and ensuring continued access to critically important information. Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today to provide the committee with our company's perspective on these important public policy issues. We look forward to working with the committee as it considers these important issues. [The prepared statement of Kurt Sanford can be found on page 79 in the appendix.] The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Sanford. Mr. Ward? STATEMENT OF BESTOR WARD, PRESIDENT, SAFE ARCHIVES-SAFE SHREDDING, LLC Mr. Ward. Good morning. Thank you, Representive Bachus, for your kind words. Chairman Oxley, Ranking Member Frank and members of the committee, it is a pleasure to be here. My name is Bestor Ward. As Representative Bachus noted, I am a member of the National Association for Information Destruction, or NAID. I am also the president of Safe Archives- Safe Shredding, a business that provides secure records management, media storage and information destruction services in Mobile, Alabama. NAID is the international nonprofit trade association of the information destruction industry. NAID's mission is to champion the responsible destruction of confidential information by promoting the highest standards and ethics in the industry. I am honored to appear before you today to discuss the important role that proper information destruction plays in the fight against identity theft. NAID commends this committee for addressing this critical issue. As you know, much discussion has recently focused on controlling or limiting the sale or transfer of confidential information. Yet that type of control is undermined when disposal of this information is left unregulated. It simply does not make sense to implement information-transfer controls without ensuring that the same sensitive information is not left out on the curb for anyone to take. Enormous costs, inconvenience and a sense of violation can be avoided through proper disposal of all documents containing sensitive consumer information. There are number of laws that help fight identity theft, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or FACT Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. However, the scope of these laws is limited to particular industries and particularly records. For instance, the FACT Act only covers consumer report information. But we know that many other documents can be used to facilitate identity theft. It is critical that we protect all sensitive consumer information, including Social Security numbers, credit card and bank information, telephone numbers and addresses maintained by any business, whether it comes from a consumer report or whether it comes from any other document. Accordingly, NAID encourages the Congress to take further steps to enact comprehensive legislation that covers all sensitive consumer information in all industries. Oftentimes, more regulation is not the answer to our country's problems. However, in this context, NAID believes that it is appropriate for two reasons. First, the costs of identify theft are enormous. Beyond the billions of dollars in losses to customers and businesses, it is difficult and expensive to capture and prosecute perpetrators of this crime. It is much easier to prevent those crimes of opportunity in the first place by eliminating the criminal opportunities, requiring proper methods of disposal as a simple, low-cost means of prevention. It makes far greater sense to enact strong laws that prevent so-called ``Dumpster divers'' and other criminals from accessing sensitive information than to impose a massive burden on the law enforcement community to address a problem after substantial losses have been incurred. I would like to convey to my single point with an anecdote. Shortly after Georgia enacted information destruction legislation in May of 2003, NAID received a phone call from an employee of a well-known corporation. The caller asked for a list of Georgia companies that it could retain to shred documents covered by the state's new disposal requirements. The caller was located in the company's corporate headquarters outside of the State of Georgia, and our NAID representative offered to send a broader list of NAID member- companies that operate in other states where the company does business. The caller's response was, ``Well, no thanks. The other states do not have these shredding laws.'' This response highlights the need for strong Federal legislation that closes the gaps between existing laws by requiring all businesses to properly dispose of sensitive personal information that is subject to misuse. This type of legislation is necessary to ensure that these documents are destroyed before someone's identity is. Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to participate in this hearing today. I am honored to be here, and I would be delighted to answer any questions that you all may have. [The prepared statement of Bestor Ward can be found on page 92 in the appendix.] The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Ward. Thank you to all our panelists. It was I think educational for all of our members, including the Chair. Let me begin with Mr. Sanford, since you had specifically talked about three tenets of Federal legislation. I wanted to have you highlight that again. As I understand, it was notification based on a federal preemption; data security based on an amendment to Gramm-Leach- Bliley, or an addition to Gramm-Leach-Bliley; and privacy access balance. If you could just briefly go over that proposal again. And then I would like to ask each of the panelists to respond to what Mr. Sanford has proposed. Mr. Sanford. Mr. Chairman, on the security question, the safeguards in GLBA, which apply to financial institutions, we would recommend that those safeguards could be applied to the information industry. Again, we are not a financial institution, but we think if safeguards were modeled similarly after the standards that were in GLBA, that would be a very welcome measure for our industry. The notification question is a much more complex matter. There has been great debate on the trigger, but not much debate, it appears, on whether notice should be made. I think most people would agree that providing notice to individuals or consumers where some sensitive financial, credit, medical or personal identifying information is compromised is a good thing. The question is, what is the trigger? Do we do that when there is just a breach in a system? Or do you need some evidence that that breach could create some potential harm? For example, let's say an employee in a company leaves the company and conducts a search the next day. That is an unauthorized access to a system. Should we send a letter to the consumer to say that that employee who left that company conducted a search that next day? Sometimes people do searches on celebrities. Should we send notices to celebrities each time there is a search done? So we have recommended that where there is some evidence that the nature of the breach could pose a risk of harm to consumers, similar to what the consumer division in California has talked about in their written guidance, we think that ought to be the triggering event so we do not flood the market with a lot of paper that is then dumped in a trash can. The Chairman. Would it be based on a quantitative number of consumers affected? Mr. Sanford. I do not think it turns on whether or not there is one consumer or 100 consumers. I think it turns on the facts of the nature of the security breach itself, whether or not--I will give you an example. If you have a security breach for--somebody has hacked into a system and downloaded records, that is probably indicative of the information getting in the wrong hands. If you have somebody accessing a system using an anonymizer or a key-stroke virus to get information, that begins to suggest that the reason why that information was obtained may be for illicit purposes. The Chairman. And a very sophisticated---- Mr. Sanford. And sophistication is growing in technology. So on privacy, our comment on privacy was that this is not about just unfettered access for corporations and institutions to have information, personally identifying information. There needs to be a balance, and we need to protect privacy. I mean, I think that is clear. When GLBA was enacted, there was a concern about protecting the privacy of information when we brought financial and insurance institutions together, and we think that balance has to be there. Corporations like us should not have unfettered access. We should have responsibilities to have safeguards on our data and not be unconcerned about privacy, which, frankly, I think LexisNexis has been very concerned about for many decades. The Chairman. Thank you. Let me, then, begin with Ms. Desoer and ask you to comment about the suggestions that Mr. Sanford put forth. Ms. Desoer. Thank you. We do believe there should be a national approach. As a financial services institution, we of course are subject to Gramm-Leach-Bliley. And in addition, the new Interagency Guidance that has been enacted, we believe embraces the principles that are fairly consistent with what he just described, and that is what we are operating under---- The Chairman. How many states do they operate in? Ms. Desoer. Twenty-nine, plus the District of Columbia. The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Foley? Mr. Foley. I also concur that it is important, as California has put out there, to have the disclosure. The only addition that I would advise to the California statute is that it does not cover encrypted data. And from a notification standpoint, some sort of standard in terms of which businesses are covered and what the standard would be for notifying the consumer, once the definition of that breach has been maintained. The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. McGuffey? Mr. McGuffey. Yes. I had testified earlier that we would agree with extending the principles of GLB to companies such as ChoicePoint and others in our industry. Both Mr. Sanford and I are in agreement on that matter in that GLB--we are not a financial institution either, so those principles of security are certainly appropriate. As far as notice goes, we obviously gave nationwide notice. And so a preemptive law from a nationwide standpoint would be certainly appropriate from our view. The one provision I think in California law that provides for an exception for public record information should be considered to not have an exception, because there is personal identifiable information within public record information, and we have elected, as a company, to not deliver the full Social Security numbers out of public record information. So I think that that exception should be reviewed and reconsidered. As far as privacy goes, certainly we are supportive of the privacy legislation associated with the consumer information. The issue of use of personally identifiable information, frankly, is also complicated because the absence of this information oftentimes will give false positives. So the ability to use that in proper markets and proper business transactions is needed in order to assure that when an individual is either signing up for an account or is trying to be validated for access to rightful information, oftentimes personally identifiable is the way in which we identify and make sure that that is who they say they are. So that is also an issue that needs to be considered, in my view, in your legislative discussion. The Chairman. In your experience, could you describe for the committee an example of a false positive, how that operates? Mr. McGuffey. Certainly. One example may be that in bankruptcy information now, the Social Security numbers on bankruptcy data is truncated. And we have a lot of common names in the United States. And we find that it is difficult now to try to associate bankruptcy information with the proper individual. So in the event that a bankruptcy record is associated improperly, then that may have, obviously, adverse implications on the wrong party. So that may be one simple example. The Chairman. Truncated in respect of just using the last four digits of the Social Security number? Or---- Mr. McGuffey. Yes. There is actually a couple different methodologies I think in different industries. And indeed, federal bankruptcy is truncating the first five and displaying the last four, which are a little bit more unique in that number. And then there are other industries that are truncating the last four and only delivering the first five. The Chairman. So you would suggest that at some point we try to have some uniformity in that. Mr. McGuffey. I think uniformity is important. And I also believe that there are markets and there are purposes for which the full Social Security number should be used for matching purposes and not necessarily display. The Chairman. And should we mandate that? Mr. McGuffey. We are, as a company, going through and trying to operate in the current environment where we have inconsistencies, and I think mandating an appropriate set of rules is going to be good for the industry. The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Ward? Mr. Ward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are here on a little different mission today in that we are talking about the ultimate disposal of the information. Mr. Sanford's operation I think is--I think there are about 150,000 pieces of personal identification that were lost there. Every day in the United States there are millions of pieces of personal identification that have reached the end of their useful life, and they are just simply disposed of, put in the Dumpster, gotten rid of in an unregulated manner. What you all did here in this committee you should be commended for in the FACT Act. You all created a set of laws that had in particular the disposal rules that are a great model to use throughout the whole business world. If those disposal rules could be mandated to be used across all businesses for all types of personal information, a lot of the Dumpster-diving issue would go away. The Chairman. Thank you. The Chair's time has expired. The gentlelady from New York, Ms. Maloney? Mrs. Maloney. I am going to yield to Ms. Velzaquez. The Chairman. The gentlelady from New York, Ms. Velazquez? Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McGuffey, how many individuals were affected by the theft of personal information that occurred at ChoicePoint? Mr. McGuffey. Congresswoman, we notified approximately 145,000 individuals. We have been working with law enforcement in California in order to continue the investigation. We are not aware today of exactly how many individuals have been the subject of actual identity theft. Ms. Velazquez. Yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported that the Los Angeles County sheriff reported that data on millions of people have been downloaded. How do you reconcile your number and that number? Mr. McGuffey. The comments in the testimony, I think, that the Wall Street Journal reflected on for Detective Decker were comments that were made in the very initial stages of the investigation. They were around the time of the arraignment and the arrest of the individual. The investigation, having now proceeded over several months, has clarified the view, and it is my understanding after having even discussions yesterday with our representative, Robert McConnell, that Detective Decker's view is that the number that we have noticed is consistent with his expectation and understanding of the investigation today. Ms. Velazquez. Does your company plan to employ, in the future, a way to readily track data that is compromised due to data breaches? Mr. McGuffey. We do have, today, methods--there are billing logs and transaction logs that we in fact used in the latter part of 2004 and into January to recreate all the various, different searches that the accounts that we identified as being fraudulent. So we do have methods today. We are looking at our technology in order to try to enable ourselves to be more responsive. Ms. Velazquez. Sir, do you believe that companies in this industry should be subject to the highest standard of data security so that we can assure that you are a step ahead of thieves, not a step behind. Mr. McGuffey. Yes, Congresswoman, we are, ourselves, rededicating our efforts, and we have continuously improved our processes, because as you mentioned, we are trying to stay ahead of the criminals. Ms. Velazquez. So you believe that you should be subjected to a high standard? Mr. McGuffey. Yes. Ms. Velazquez. Mr. Sanford? Mr. Sanford. Well, we certainly think we need to enhance our security based on what we learned at this company that we acquired. As I indicated in my opening remarks and my written testimony, we certainly would support the safeguard rules modeled after GLBA. I think that that is the right approach. It imposes a framework that says: Apply your security based on the context and circumstances of what business you are engaging in. The more we have learned about this, the more we spent time with law enforcement, the more sophisticated we are getting and understanding what the threats are. Ms. Velazquez. Mr. Ward? Mr. Ward. Absolutely, Congresswoman, we do believe in that. Our association has endeavored to try to set itself at the highest standard. We have a certification process that our shredders have to go through, and it is a pretty rigorous set of parameters that we have to go through. I think that as the future unfolds, we will continue to add to that. Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. I thank you. Mr. Bachus is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Bachus. I thank the Chairman. First of all, Mr. McGuffey, is ChoicePoint covered by Gramm-Leach-Bliley, or any of your subsidiaries today? Are they under the data security requirements of that act? Mr. McGuffey. We are regulated in certain aspects of our company associated with GLB. While we are not a financial institution, to the extent that some of that data is controlled by GLB, then we are required to comply. Mr. Bachus. How about the FACT Act or Fair Credit Reporting Act? Are you subject to those data security requirements? Mr. McGuffey. Yes, Congressman, we are. The majority of our business is governed by the FCRA and also the FACTA. Mr. Bachus. How about LexisNexis, Mr. Sanford? Mr. Sanford. Congressman, under GLBA, as a recipient of data from a financial institution or a consumer reporting agency, we are subject to the privacy provisions. But as we are not a financial institution, we are not subject to the security provisions. That is why we suggested modeling that. We have a very small part of our business that is governed by FCRA, for example, some of the employment screening. And that obviously is covered by FACT Act as well. Mr. Bachus. And I am not sure, Mr. McGuffey, that ChoicePoint was under the data security requirements of Gramm- Leach-Bliley. Mr. McGuffey. As not being a financial institution, we are not under the data security, but we---- Mr. Bachus. Which in--yes, okay. And I will say this. Right now banks have heavy financial security regulations imposed on them right now. So I think when we engage in this debate or discussion, we have to realize that financial institutions are already under heavy financial data security requirements. In fact, if you visit a large bank, you see that several of them have $50 million and $60 million facilities that operate 24 hours a day. They are constantly--and it is very interesting that constantly they are interdicting attempts to break into the system almost on an hourly basis. It is incredible to sit there and watch people try to hack into the system. It is very sophisticated. I will yield the balance of my time to Mr. Castle. Mr. Castle. [Presiding.] Let me ask one question now, and I will have my own time here in a moment. But just I guess, Mr. McGuffey and Mr. Sanford, and I think I understood the whole panel basically indicating that we have to go more universal in this and that probably doing it at a national level is the way to go. And I think there is probably general agreement on this. And by the way, this is legislation which I think we will not have a great political divide on it. It is a question of getting the right language. This is not Republican-or Democrat- type legislation. So hopefully we can work this out. I have several concerns about the extent of where we should go, and one of them is how wide should the range of businesses be. Clearly, we have to go beyond the financial institutions. I do not think anybody disagrees with that. I am not sure anybody here has any disagreement with their own business necessarily being included. But I think of various things that have happened. For instance, I do not know the whole details of--I think it was a GM card where HSBC gave notice and others did not give notice, and the Polo clothing chains were involved in this. I do not know how far we should go with all of this. Do you have any thoughts about where this should cut off, if at all? There is just so much data out there and so many different entities have access to it that I just--you know, it is difficult to conceive exactly where you end all of this--for those of you, particularly Mr. McGuffey and Mr. Sanford, who are not banks at the time and not regulated at this time. Mr. Sanford. Our experience and our focus has obviously been on our own industry. And if we look at what California legislation--which I believe got all of this notification started--it is specifically an identity theft piece of legislation. And clearly, if there is personal identifying information that is subject to a compromise--whether that is information that I might have in my business, or another organization, a government agency, an institution has--clearly where there is a risk of harm, I think you would want to say that notification should be made. Now, when you have medical records, which is personally sensitive information, that there is no risk for identity theft, that may a different issue from a policy standpoint whether you are going to provide notice, where someone wants to know that their personal medical information. But I think if you have financial information, credit information or personal identifying information that poses a risk for identity theft, I would cast a broader net. Mr. Castle. I guess the problem comes in trying to write this and put it into legislative language. Do you have any comments, Mr. McGuffey? Mr. McGuffey. Yes. I would concur that if it is personally identifiable information, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, that are full numbers, and an entity, whether it is public sector, academic, or even other businesses in the private sector, retail or otherwise, if they are handling that kind of information and allow that information to get into hands that are inappropriate, then that is where we ought to be evaluating legislation to make sure that there are proper controls in place. As we have already stated here, a lot of the security under GLB does not extend there. We obviously, when using that data, have obligations under GLB for proper, permissible use of it. But the handling of that data by many organizations is no different from a threat standpoint, in my view. Mr. Castle. Thank you. Ms. Maloney is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Maloney. First of all, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for calling this hearing. It appears we truly do have an epidemic of security breaches. I just want to give one example: MSNBC reported that from mid-February through April, data breaches exposed over 2 million Americans to credit card fraud and identity theft, which is a huge exposure. From your testimony, it is clear that it is a large range of entities, from banks to universities to retailers, and I would say a very wide range of consequences. Mr. Bachus pointed out that many financial institutions are already covered under Gramm-Leach-Bliley and the FACT Act. But I would like to ask the panelists if you could clarify further on Mr. Castle's question on how big should the covered universe be, and should the same standards apply? For example, financial institutions have access to more sensitive data than other entities may have--and your comments on that and how do we define it, the extent of it. I would also like to ask about the need for an objective bright-line standard for notification, particularly when there is personal identifiable financial information--and if you would like to comment on whether you think all entities should have a bright-line standard or only certain ones. And I welcome anyone's comment. Mr. McGuffey. Well, as I think most of us have testified here and indeed my view is that I do not see a great deal of difference between an academic organization or a private sector organization when the information is the same. When you have a full Social Security number that is allowed to be accessed inappropriately, the impact, it seems to me, would be the same. So I would support and our testimony is that it is not the organization; it is the information and then it is how or the danger that is caused as a result of that. Mrs. Maloney. Any other comments? Mr. Ward. Yes, Representative, I would like to respond to your question. There is a tremendous amount of information. Everybody knows that. And it is so extensive and there is so much of it that it needs to be properly disposed of. For example, if you had come to work for me in my organization in your previous life, under our guidelines and under our certification process, I would have a human resources file on you that would have your drug test, would have your criminal background checks, would have all kinds of personal information. And then at such time as you ran for Congress and were elected, I may not have a particular need for that file and it had outlived its usefulness, I could simply throw in the trash can, with no guidelines. And that information would be out for any Dumpster-diver to find. So it is a very broad issue. We think that each company should have some type of employee or customer-consumer disclosure that outlines exactly what information it has and how it should be disposed of. Mrs. Maloney. Thank you. I would like to hear the views of Ms. Desoer and Mr. Sanford on the need for a consistent standard of data protection. Ms. Desoer. Yes. Being a financial services institution, we do have a consistent national standard in the Interagency Guidance and in all of the regulations that were referenced, and we believe that is appropriate. I would like to reinforce that, again, I think the place that it should start is what personal information is being collected and being used as the criteria for who should be subject to some kind of a national standard. Mrs. Maloney. Mr. Sanford? Mr. Sanford. On data security provisions, what we think is workable, again, are the safeguards that are under GLBA. And the reason why I think they are more workable than a specific standard is, I think when regulation attempts to prescribe for each and every business exactly how their security should be deployed, it does not take into account differences in technology, it does not take into account different applications and uses. And the GLB safeguards put the burden on the corporation to continued to enhance the security of their business as new threats emerge. It is not a static set of standards, and instead it is a set of standards that you have to continually publish, upgrade and monitor to face new threats. Mrs. Maloney. My time is up. Thank you. Mr. Castle. Thank you, Ms. Maloney. I will yield myself 5 minutes. Let me start with something that has been touched on. Actually, this is a useful hearing because we are really trying to develop legislation, and your input is very, very important to that. And I think, Mr. Sanford, I will ask you the discussion, because you mentioned in one of your answers to one of the questions about the significance of security breaches. And I think there are levels of breaches, obviously. I mean, I am not an expert on this. But clearly there are levels by numbers, there are levels by the extent of what is in the information that is breached and a whole variety of probably other things I have not even thought of. But my question to you is: Do you believe that we should be trying to put in legislation the different level of breaches that would indeed trigger notice or whatever the remedies may be--as one part of the question. And the other part of the question is: If not, who will do that? Should that be left up to the individual entities who are dealing with it, be it LexisNexis or Bank of America or anybody else? Exactly how should that whole business of what triggers the various breaches and the measure of the breaches be handled? Mr. Sanford. Congressman, where I start my thinking on this is: What is the intent of providing a notice in the first place? So if I got a letter in the mail, like my sister did, from my company, what do I do with this? Why did I get this? And the reason why she got that, along with the other people we sent notices to, is because we said there is some risk of harm and you need to take corrective measures. You need to look at your credit reports, you need to take advantage of these services, et cetera. So when I think about what triggers, when you talk about a level of notice, to me it turns on whether or not there is a risk of harm--again, I am talking about identity theft-based legislation, not security-breach legislation; that is, to me, a different issue--is if there is a risk of identity theft because of a security breach in a business, where that information--financial information, credit information, personally identifying information--would enable that information in the wrong hands to put somebody at risk for identity theft or fraud associated with that, then I think there should be notification. I think it should be national. If you think about the mobility of our society and how frequently people move, and you can see down the road where we may have 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 different state standards coming out, and different triggers, different forms of notice, different remedies, and you get people moving around, my guess is we are going to confuse most Americans if they are getting these notices in the mail that tell them they need to take appropriate action. Mr. Castle. Thank you. Ms. Desoer, sort of a follow-up on that question, and instead of dealing with this issue and this problem of preparing legislation, we have heard from a number of financial institutions on how they believe notification should be structured when a breach is outside of their scope. Some want the opportunity to inform their customers while others believe it should be the responsibility of the breaching entity. What are your thoughts about this? And I recognize the fact that this is extraordinarily expensive, and you sort of put your name on the line to a degree. So this to me is not a simple decision that you have to make or that we have to make in terms of preparing legislation. Ms. Desoer. And I think that is key. It is not a simple situation, and it is a very dynamic environment in which we operate, in which lots of pieces of it are evolving. So the approach that we have taken is really to evaluate each event separately and to work to get all of the facts together and the right people engaged, and then whether that is a merchants association, the financial services institution, whether it is directly between us and our direct customer, each one is slightly different and needs to be evaluated in a context, starting with, at the end of the day, our brand and what our customers look for in the brand is for Bank of America to be a trustworthy, secure financial services institution. It is what is in the best interest of our customer, so that you have the spectrum of some of what you just heard, you do not overly confuse the customer, the ultimate consumer, and it is easy for them to know what it is is in their control and they can do to the other end of the spectrum where it is very specific and explicit and it is step one, two and three. And so each one does need to be evaluated, and that is why we believe that the Interagency Guidance that financial services institutions do operate under, there is some wording in there that directs us to evaluation of event that could reasonably lead to the misuse of the information. And we think that is an important part of whatever we do. Mr. Castle. Well, my time is up. But what you say makes it difficult for us, as you can imagine. Because if we legislate in this area--and I believe with of all of you, I think all of you are saying, and that is, we need to approach this in a national manner or we are going to have tremendous problems, State by State. But in doing so, to draft the kind of language that will have applicability beyond financial institutions to other entities dealing with data as well, and to try to determine the manner of breach, the remedy of the breach, all these kinds of things, is going to be extremely difficult. So I would just hope you would encourage everybody who is interested in this to get in touch with all of our offices and let us know what your thoughts on it, because this is not going to be that easy to do. I yield 5 minutes to Mr. Frank. Mr. Frank. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for being in and out, but I had to go name a post office--an important part of our duty. Actually, this kind of an important one. I want to first say that, with regard to Ms. Desoer, I thought the Bank of America's response was a very good one. And I think we are sometimes critical when institutions do not do what we think meets their responsibilities. In this case, Bank of America stepped up and did more than they were legally required to do. That is important. I have to say to people in the business community in general, the financial institution, we are sometimes told two contradictory things: One is, ``Don't legislate right up to the very edge. Leave us some discretion. Don't overdo the legislation. Put some general laws in there but trust us to be sensible.'' But then we run into situations where something is not done that we think should have been done, or something is done that we thought should not have been done, we think it did not really fully treat the customers in the right way and we are told, ``Well, we complied with the law.'' In other words, sometimes we are told, ``Don't push the law too far.'' But then, the kind of catch-22 is, people say, ``Well, we did not have to.'' And people should understand that, that if the institutions are going to be very literal and insisting that they will do what the law requires and nothing more, then they should not be surprised when the law may in fact go further than they want to do. In this case, Bank of America reached out and did more than the law required, and I think that was very useful. Another point, I notice there has been some reference to people saying, ``Well, you do not want us to have to notify you every time there is a breach because we will be flooding people with paper.'' I said that before, I must tell you, particularly to my friends in the financial community, you are not credible when you say you do not want to send us unsolicited mail. No one sends me more unsolicited mail. I have constituents who do not write me as often as you do, and they have a better claim on me. So that, I have to say, when people give me a reason that I do not believe, then I have to wonder what the real reason is. And I do not think it is an aversion to sending out unsolicited mail that is involved. So if there is some problem that is triggered by your having to notify every time there is a breach--and I have to say, I do not know what standard you could come up with that would say, ``We are only going to tell you about a breach if we think it is likely to cause a problem.'' We are not going to know in all the cases what happened. I suppose if it was purely accidental, you might say there was no likelihood, but we do not know what will show up. The other--and I was very pleased Mr. Foley testified. In fact, I was hoping that we could get someone to ask him to do this. I must say that when we dealt with the extension of credit, I was disappointed with the response from the retail industry. At the time what we were talking about was how do you resolve a dispute if you are told by the credit-rating agency, ``Well, you did not pay this bill,'' and you say, ``Hey, I never bought that thing. That was not me,'' or, ``Yeah, I bought it and I returned it, it was defective,'' or, ``I paid for it.'' The retail industry was very resistant to having any obligation to go back and check as to whether or not there was substantive mistake. Their position was that the most they should have to do would be to check the paperwork. And in fact, we had studies that showed they did about, I do not know, 40 of those an hour, that there was no way the consumer could get some kind of independent investigation. Now, we moved a little bit towards that. But now, again, I find the retail industry in some ways being resistant. I am told that they said, by credit unions in Massachusetts, that when BJ's, I guess it was, had the--what is BJ's? I do not want to--albeit, I am immune from liable suits, I do not want to abuse the privilege. But BJ's was responsible for breaching security of data, and the institutions that issued the cards, as Mr. Foley has indicated, had to tell the cardholder, ``Well, your data has been breached, but I do not know who did it and I cannot tell you who did it.'' My sense is that most of them did not believe you. They thought you did know and did not want to tell them. That just seems to me unacceptable, especially since the general rule in our legal system is: You ought to put the most responsibility on the people who have the ability to prevent the abuse. Now, the people who have the best chance to prevent the abuse of data are the people who are handling the data. And it just seems to me an elementary example of basic logic: Whoever was the one entity that was responsible for the breach ought to have to be identified. That in and of itself, it would seem to me, if we just did that legislatively we would be doing a great deal I believe to reduce breaches. We would then greatly ratchet up the importance of reducing breaches in people's minds. So I know what Mr. Foley thinks. I wonder if any of the others have any comment on requiring, whether it is the retailer or anybody else, to the extent that we know who is responsible making that public. Let's start with Ms. Desoer. Ms. Desoer. I do not have any issue with that. I think some of the issues between the retailer or the merchant and the financial services institution is confidentiality of a client relationship and the priority that that takes in terms---- Mr. Frank. What kind of--I mean, what, the people did not know--there is no--what we are here talking about is that somebody has a credit card that you issued and they used it at a particular merchant. There is no confidentiality there. Ms. Desoer. No, but if retailer X, for example, has a banking relationship with Bank of America, our relationship with them does not enable us to talk publicly that we have a relationship with them. Mr. Frank. Well, then we ought to change that law. In other words, if you are saying that because I got an account in your bank, if I screw up in another way, the bank cannot identify me. That just seems to me unnecessary. Ms. Desoer. No, that--and that is not what I am implying. It is, again, going back to the ultimate consumer who is, in this case, our credit card customer and our communication to them. I hear you relative---- Mr. Frank. Yes, what I am saying is---- Ms. Desoer.----excusing as to who is at fault---- Mr. Frank. You do not have to do--if the retailer messed up on the data, that does not mean you give a list of all the retailers' confidential financial information, but identifying that that is where the breach came. I do not see how that is a problem with your confidentiality. Ms. Desoer. I particularly aligned with what you said, which is the responsibility of whomever is collecting and managing that information should be the one accountable. Mr. Frank. If others want to do a quickie, my time is up, I will just listen. Mr. McGuffey. We at ChoicePoint agree that ensuring that the burden of notice follows responsibility for breach is appropriate. Mr. Frank. Thank you. Mr. Sanford. Congressman, we are not a financial institution, we do not have retail, but in our security breaches, the breaches occurred in our customer environments where their password and I.D.s were compromised through a variety of methods, and we saw it as our responsibility as the party who maintained the databases where the breaches occurred to make the notice. Mr. Frank. Mr. Ward? Mr. Ward. I am not sure that I have a particular comment in respect to that question. Mr. Frank. Well, if you are not sure, nobody else could be either. [Laughter.] So I guess that is one uncertainty that will go unresolved. Mr. Ward. We are not in the retailing business and we do not deal with any particular dynamics. Mr. Frank. Okay, thank you, then, that is very responsive. Mr. Price. [Presiding.] Thank you, Mr. Frank. Mr. Castle and Mr. Bachus, we have the FDIC bill on the floor currently, and so they apologize for not being able to remain for this portion of the hearing. Mr. McHenry from North Carolina is recognized. Mr. McHenry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is pretty nice to hear a freshman as a chairman of such a big committee. Thank you all for testifying here today. And my question is, just generally speaking, really to ChoicePoint and Bank of America mainly: Is there currently not a marketplace incentive for data security? Do you not see an economic incentive in terms of your communication to the customer? I live in the suburbs of Charlotte, and really just right close to your headquarters of Bank of America, and I certainly understand the advertising that you currently have about the secure network that you do have in place, the fact that you do not have errors when it comes to check processing, things of that sort. And there is an economic incentive I see to that marketplace on security. I was wondering if you all could address that. Ms. Desoer. Yes. As I said in my testimony, what customers come to us for is trust and security, and we take that extremely seriously. And the stewardship of customer information and their privacy and all that goes along with it is, at the end of the day, what our brand stands for. So it always starts with what is in that customer's best interest. We firmly believe that our ability to earn that trust and to demonstrate our ability to manage that trust over the lifetime of a relationship is what differentiates us in the competitive marketplace, yes. Mr. Foley. I would say that in looking at the issue to remember that the security is only going to be good as the weakest link in the fence. So as we are looking at these issues, there is no current economic benefit to many of the parties that touch that data, to protect that data. Mr. McHenry. Do you want to further elaborate? Mr. Foley. In particular, my own experience, when we are talking about the large-card associations, mostly Visa and MasterCards, regulations on the merchant versus the card- issuer, between Gramm-Leach-Bliley and all the other regulations that the issuer has on them, no matter how much they protect them, if the same standard is not dealt with in particular merchant, then whatever effort and resources the issuer is putting behind the security is meaningless, because there is no incentive for that merchant to do anything other than to get that payment through their system as quickly as they possibly can. Mr. McHenry. Are you not fearful of lawsuits and repercussions because of lax security? Mr. Foley. Well, that is right now what the remedy is. And as I had said in my testimony, in the case of BJ's Wholesale Club, there were 40,000 cards that were compromised within about a 2-week period. Credit unions have brought suit and individual banks in Massachusetts have brought suit. And right now that is the only remedy. Mr. McHenry. Really, the question goes to the heart of, is there not an incentive in the marketplace to do this without governmental intervention? Mr. Foley. If the lawsuit comes out favorably for us, yes. Mr. McHenry. All right. Well, thank you for your testimony. Mr. Price. Thank you. It is my pleasure to recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott. Thank you very much. Mr. McGuffey, let me start with you, if I may. Going back to this winter, February, when the news came out about the identity thefts, ChoicePoint was immediately hit with an order by our insurance commissioner to give you 90 days to put some things in motion to correct the situation. I would like to ask you just a line of questioning on how you have fared with that. One of those points was that you had to provide immediate notification. Can you tell us how well you have done that so far? Mr. McGuffey. Yes, Congressman, we have provided notice. And indeed, we are I believe in process of and if not having already made notice to California at the time when that request had been made. Mr. Scott. So that point has been satisfied to the satisfaction of the insurance commissioner in Georgia. Mr. McGuffey. I believe so. Mr. Scott. That is very important, because there is a part of that he said if not in 90 days you will be barred from doing any business in Georgia with insurance companies. The second point was that you had to establish a rapid response system. Have you done that? Mr. McGuffey. I believe that we have formed a team to be able to respond to that. The details of that, today, I am not prepared to speak to, but I would be more than happy to provide it to you and your office. Mr. Scott. Okay. And the third item that he said you had to do within 90 days was to perform a system-wide audit with an independent security firm. Has that been put into place? Mr. McGuffey. We have retained the services of an independent firm. I am not sure as of this date as to whether it has been completed or not. But if it has not been completed, we are in process to be able to achieve that objective. Mr. Scott. Has the insurance commissioner been made aware of the level of progress that you have made, that you have expressed here, to this point? Mr. McGuffey. I am not aware of the details of what we communicated back to the insurance commissioner at this date. Mr. Scott. Do you have concerns that you may not be able to make this 90-day period? This occurred in February. It is now May. Time is running out. Do you feel any concern that you might not be able to make the 90-day deadline? Mr. McGuffey. I have not heard of a concern that we would not be able to meet those requirements. Mr. Scott. Let me ask you another question. Let's get our hands around this issue. There has been some discrepancy pointed out as to the extent of this problem. By last estimates and your most accurate accounting, I believe it has been 145,000 records that were stolen. Has that changed any, particularly in view of the light of the discrepancy that was brought to our attention from California by Detective Decker, that you had estimated at 17,000, and he said it was more like 4 million. That is a huge difference. Mr. McGuffey. Yes, Congressman. I think the comments that were in the Wall Street Journal yesterday--which we tried to get a good insight on, having seen that yesterday for the first time--those comments by Detective Decker were made in the very early stages of his investigation. In fact, as I understand it, from what I have been told, those comments were made at the arraignment of the individual who was arrested. At that time we had not completed our investigation and rebuilt all of the searches that had been run--there were over 17,000 searches that had been run on our systems--nor had the sheriff's department completed their investigation. Now that we have progressed in the investigation to this date, we have been informed by Detective Decker that he is in agreement with those numbers and believes that our notice was appropriate and consistent with his review of the records. Mr. Scott. All right. Let me ask you one other issue before my time runs out, because one of the very, very important areas that this committee deals with is in the financing of terrorism. ChoicePoint has developed an excellent reputation of assisting in that fight against terrorism. Would you care to share with this committee some examples of the effectiveness of ChoicePoint in our war against terrorism? Mr. McGuffey. Thank you, Congressman. We are obviously very proud of our opportunity to work with Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies to pursue the--of making sure that our country is safe. We have products and services out of our--on data services that are in Homeland Security that enable our law enforcement to investigate rings and investigate terrorists. We have examples there, although oftentimes since I am not--have a security clearance, I will not hear about them all. But that is one example where we are delivering a technology into Homeland Security. We have on a daily basis the various, different agencies--FBI as well as sub-agencies of FBI--use our services in order to investigate leads that they may get. We have built specialized systems for them at their request, to their requirements, in order to support those organizations, and we are proud to be able to do that. Mr. Scott. Thank you. Thank you very much, Chairman. Mr. Price. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. Pearce, is recognized. Mr. Pearce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Desoer, is there any resolution to the case where you lost the five tapes? Ms. Desoer. No, there is no resolution. The investigation is still ongoing. We have continuously monitored those 1.2 million customer accounts, and there is no evidence that the information---- Mr. Pearce. Have you had any other losses of significant size of identity theft, just people getting information? Ms. Desoer.----lost tapes or that sort of thing? No. I mean, the retailer situations, the merchant situations that have been referenced, we have a significant cardholder customer base. So---- Mr. Pearce. Mr. Sanford, has LexisNexis ever experienced any losses of information? On page 2, you describe the enormity of the situation: 9.3 million cases. Have you had any losses of information through your system? Mr. Sanford. In my testimony I indicated what we discovered in the investigation that we did. Mr. Pearce. And how easy is it to get convictions on any of these things? How easy is it to track down the people who are doing it and then to get convictions? Mr. Sanford. Well, I have been working with the U.S. Secret Service since the end of February, and we get regular briefings. And it is extraordinarily difficult, with their resources, to gather sufficient evidence for the warrants and the manpower to then chase down. It is a whole level of sophistication in the underground economy that is trafficking in this information. And I frankly believe that we are out-manned in law enforcement. I think it is very, very difficult. They have had some successes that have been very public. But I think until the penalties on identity theft are much bigger than the value of the theft, I think that you are going to continue to see rampant identity theft--the old-fashioned way too. Most of it is still your friends and your family and your neighbors committing this. Mr. Pearce. How easy would it be to close the opportunity, the window of opportunity, between the time something happens and the time we actually then get it closed down--Ms. Desoer, if you could address that? Ms. Desoer. Yes. Immediately upon discovery, we start monitoring accounts. And so while an investigation is ongoing, we will know if there is unusual activity. And customer by customer, we can handle that immediately to either reassure a customer's card or take whatever action is required to protect them. Mr. Pearce. But the losses are still enormous, I mean, billions even in that narrow window. Is it possible to close the window even tighter? Ms. Desoer. That is what we are working very hard to be able to do, to provide that protection of the customer and then also protect the financial lo"
