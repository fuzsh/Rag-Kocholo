        "text": "There are four different types of title hold. See below to learn what they are and what you will need to do to get the hold removed:\n\nDocument (Doc) Hold:\n\nYou will need to bring the out of state title or MSO to a Service Oklahoma or Licensed Operator\n\nSerial Inspection (SI) Hold:\n\nYou will need to bring your vehicle to a Service Oklahoma or Licensed Operator for a VIN inspection (there will be a $4 fee for the inspection)\n\nDocument/Serial Inspection (DS) Hold:\n\nYou will need to visit a Service Oklahoma or Licensed Operator location and bring the prior Vehicle Title or MSO as well as the vehicle for a VIN inspection\n\nInternational Registration Plan (IRP) Hold:\n\nYou will need to bring a current CAB Card to a Service Oklahoma or Licensed Operator\n\nService Oklahoma will assign Oklahoma lienholders a Lienholder ID number (LHID). The LHID will allow the lienholder to see all liens associated with the LHID on the lienholderâ€™s account in our system. Lienholder IDs are required to participate in the electronic lien and title program.\n\nAll lienholders will be assigned a Lienholder ID regardless of whether they opt-in to the ELT program.\n\nLienholders may also submit paper requests for any of these services directly to Service Oklahoma at:\n\nService Oklahoma\n\nMotor Vehicle Liens\n\nP.O. Box 26800\n\nOklahoma City, OK 73126\n\nSome, not all, trailers have titles. If the trailer has a title and is subject to a lien, the title will be mailed to the lienholder.\n\nEach state has different requirements for documentation. Most states will allow vehicle registration with a Certificate of Registration which can be obtained online here while you wait for your title. Some lenders may mail the title directly to the other state.\n\nOnce filed, liens will remain reflected as active in the Service Oklahoma system until a properly executed lien release is surrendered. If you have a lien release you wish to submit, mail the lien release to:\n\nService Oklahoma\n\nMotor Vehicle Liens\n\nP.O. Box 26800\n\nOklahoma City, OK 73126\n\nThere is no fee to release a lien in our system. However, if you wish a new title to be issued reflecting that the lien is no longer active, you may take your lien release and title to Service Oklahoma Licensing Office (N Classen) or Licensed Operator. A new title, without the lien listed, will be processed for a title fee of $11.00.\n\nIf there is a lien on your vehicle, the title was mailed to your lien holder. Please contact your lien holder to receive your title.\n\nIf there is no lien on your vehicle and it has been more than 21 days since the title was issued, please contact Service Oklahoma and an affidavit will be mailed for you to fill out and send back for a title."
