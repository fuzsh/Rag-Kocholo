Use these tools to be sure you're working with a registered contractor who has a valid bond and insurance.\n\nThe Verify a Contractor, Tradesperson or Business tool allows you to:\n\nLook up subcontractors and tradespeople.\n\nVerify if the contractor has an active license.\n\nSee if they have safety or construction citations.\n\nFind out if they have lawsuits against their bond.\n\nConfirm names of business owners.\n\nAnd much more.\n\nYou can also verify that the tradesperson performing electrical, plumbing, elevator installation, or manufactured home installations is certified (licensed) in Washington.\n\nWatch: Verify a Contractor for Consumers\n\nSee our Protect My Home page for tips and tools to help you hire smart! We have also created the Hire Smart Step-by-Step, a homeowner's guide to hiring a contractor that will help you find a contractor who is qualified to handle your project, and avoid many of the most common problems. But, if you do have problems, find out what you can do.\n\nUse our Verify tool to see if a business you want to contract with has an active contractor registration; an active and paid-to-date workers' comp account covering any employees. At the same time, you can check for safety violations, other information, lawsuits against their surety bond and more.\n\nThe Verify a Contractor, Tradesperson or Business allows you to:\n\nLook up subcontractors and tradespeople.\n\nVerify a contractor has an active license.\n\nVerify a tradesperson is certified.\n\nVerify a contractor has an active workers' comp account.\n\nSee if the contractor has safety citations or other infractions.\n\nFind out if they have any lawsuits against their bond.\n\nComplete a tracking request for a subcontractor with an active worker's comp account.\n\nPrint the Certificate of Workers' Comp Coverage.\n\nYou can search for a contractor by their:\n\nL&I employer account ID or Contractor License Number\n\nUBI number (business license number)\n\nFull or partial business or owners name\n\nUse these tools to learn about hiring subcontractors or \"independent contractors\" and avoid prime contractor liability.\n\nIf you are a contractor hiring a subcontractor, be sure to complete a tracking request for those with active coverage. If the subcontractor fails to pay workers' comp premiums or renew their contractor registration, or if their electrical contractor license or plumbing contractor license is suspended or revoked within one year of the request, L&I will send you a notification letter.\n\nYou might be an employer and not know it\n\nIn some cases, an \"independent contractor\" is actually a worker for whom you must do such things as pay workers' comp premiums, meet wage and hour requirements, pay unemployment tax, etc. Not understanding your requirements can leave your business vulnerable to unwanted penalties and even lawsuits. See our publication, A Guide to Hiring Independent Contractors in Washington State (F101-063-000), for additional information.\n\nHazardous materials\n\nSome activities have licensing requirements that are in addition to contractor registration.\n\nLead-based paint\n\nContact the Washington State Dept. of Commerce Lead Paint Program at 360-586-5323(LEAD), or visit www.commerce.wa.gov/lead, before renovating or remodeling activities in pre-1978 residential or child-occupied facilities, to ensure compliance with applicable lead regulations.\n\nPesticides\n\nIf you will be applying pesticides, contact the Washington State Dept. of Agriculture, Licensing and Recertification Program at 877-301-4555 or license@agr.wa.gov to ensure you are in compliance with state and federal pesticide law, or visit https://agr.wa.gov.\n\nMore resources\n\nIf you have entered a tracking request for a subcontractor, you may review your tracking requests.\n\nDo you need to Renew Your Contractor Registration?\n\nDo you need to Register as a Contractor?"
