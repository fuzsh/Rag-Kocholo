        "text": "A book is most often described by who created it and what lies within it, so as I embark on the journey of The Book Beautiful, that is where I will begin.\n\nIf you are reading this blog, someone somewhere took the time to teach you the alphabet, most likely through a song, then someone taught you to recognize the letters along with their sounds, next someone showed you that when you put the letters together they create what we call words, and when these words are strung together they create sentences, and whoever did all these things taught you one of the most valuable things you have… the ability to read.\n\nAs a future teacher and person who loves to read, I find the ability to read the most important thing we teach children (academics wise). For some children their teachers are the only people who will teach them this skill and for others they will be lucky enough to have a parent, grandparent, friend or relative who teaches them as well. But no matter who is the instructor, reading makes or breaks a child’s education.\n\nWilliam McGuffey was an educator who knew this. William McGuffey was born in 1800 to a family that cherished education. He had the wonderful opportunity to go to school and because of his desire to learn and dedication he graduated school at age fourteen with permission to go out and teach. Six years later he enrolled in college because he felt he needed to further his education. In 1836 McGuffey published his first of one of the most well-known textbook series, the McGuffey readers. After his first book was published, McGuffey published additional readers and spellers that grew increasingly more difficult for developing readers; By 1837 he had four published readers. These books were used from the primary stages of learning letters to children reading and comprehending stories. Before McGuffey readers the most standard textbook at the time was a series called New England Primer. These books taught reading from a very Christian perspective that focused on sin and death without God.\n\n“It began the teaching of the alphabet with “A is for Adam” and followed with a sobering couplet: “In Adam’s fall, we sinned all.” It closed with a funereal poem: “Give ear my children to my words / Build not your house too high. / But always have before your eye, / That you were born to die.”” – William McGuffey Museum\n\nThough McGuffey was a devout Christian himself he focused his readers on American life. His readers used words like axe, ink, pig, and other daily items. Beside teaching children to read, McGuffey wrote his books in a way that provided children with a moral education as well.\n\nThe book I chose from the McGuffey series is McGuffey’s Electric Spelling Book: Revised Edition. This book was originally published in 1879 and then revised in 1896 and many times since. This book does not contain stories and it is not something one would sit down to read. Basically, this is a book of spelling words. Students were given this book to study spellings and pronunciations, just as students today receive spelling and vocabulary words to practice and be tested on. The spelling words all have pronunciation marks.\n\nMcGuffey readers were used in most public schools since the first publications in 1836 until about 1920. Some students, especially home schooled children, are still being taught using McGuffey’s readers and spellers today. McGuffey was not an author; he did not write stories and did not publish books beyond his text books, yet his books are some of the most well-known, some say almost as well-known as the Bible in some regions. William McGuffey and his readers helped to pave the way for modern textbooks and learning styles.\n\nI think McGuffey would agree with the quote by Nelson Mandela\n\n“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”\n\nMcGuffey not only cherished his own education but the education of generations far past his own. He created books that have lived beyond him and brought the most valuable gift of all, the gift of reading, to millions of children since 1836."
