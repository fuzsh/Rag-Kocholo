        "text": "The California Code of Regulations (CCR), is the official compilation and publication of the regulations adopted, amended or repealed by state agencies pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Properly adopted regulations that have been filed with the Secretary of State have the force of law.\n\nThe CCR is compiled into Titles and organized into Divisions containing the regulations of state agencies.\n\nThe CCR is available from a variety of sources:\n\nOnline. OAL contracts with Barclays, a division of Thomson-Reuters to provide a free online version of the Official CCR. If you have difficulties accessing the CCR website, please e-mail OAL at staff@oal.ca.gov or contact Barclays at 1-888-728-7677. (See Browsing Tips below.)\n\nMost County Clerks and County Law Libraries have printed copies of the CCR.\n\nState depository libraries also have a copy of the CCR.\n\nTo order a hard-copy version of the CCR or purchase individual Titles, please contact Barclays, publisher of the Official CCR, at 1-888-728-7677.\n\nHistorical information on Regulations\n\nFor information on how to find past versions of a regulation, please click here.\n\nCAUTION regarding Official Code of Regulations:\n\nGovernment Code section 11344 requires OAL to provide for the official compilation, printing and publication of state regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The online CCR contains the full text of the California Code of Regulations. OAL updates the official hard-copy and online versions of the code once weekly to reflect newly adopted, amended or repealed regulations. OAL cannot verify the authenticity of regulations downloaded from websites other than http://ccr.oal.ca.gov/, or confirm whether those versions reflect the existing content of the code.\n\nCCR Browsing Tips:\n\nPop-Up Blocker/Westlaw: If a yellow “pop-up blocker detected” screen appears, you may simply click on “continue to weblinks” to access the online CCR. If a window appears stating “Westlaw is unable to accept your password,” clear cookies and close your browser before trying again.\n\nDocuments in Sequence: The Documents in Sequence function at the bottom of each section will allow you to view CCR sections in sequence. For example, if you retrieve 1 CCR § 260, click Docs in Sequence to view 1 CCR § 270. Use the Prev and Next arrows located at the bottom of the document to view other consecutive documents.\n\nNote ABOUT TITLE 24:"
