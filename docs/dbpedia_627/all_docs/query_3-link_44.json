        "text": "A license is more than a pass to drive – it’s how you prove who you are. Driver’s licenses are used for everything from signing a lease to making age-restricted purchases. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is enhancing the security of the credential you rely on most while offering options to keep you on the move.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, standard licenses will no longer meet federal REAL ID requirements for Kentuckians to board U.S. flights or enter select federal facilities and military bases.\n\nBy producing identity credentials at one secure location, Kentucky can offer a federally compliant credential for citizens who prefer the convenience of using a single, secure credential for access to federal facilities and other uses.\n\n​\n\nA REAL ID is a federally-compliant card that serves as a license/permit/personal ID and can be used to board commercial flights within the U.S., enter military bases and access federal buildings that require ID once REAL ID enforcement begins May 7, 2025​.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and military bases accept other documentation, such as valid, unexpired passports and passport cards. Visit www.tsa.gov for a complete list of acceptable air travel documentation and contact the military base you plan to visit to learn what other credentials they will accept.\n\nCurrent Kentucky licenses/permits/personal ID card versions may be used for domestic air travel and restricted federal facility entry until REAL ID enforcement begins May 7, 2025.\n\nThe REAL ID is optional and serves as one of many acceptable forms of identification accepted by the Transportation Security Administration and military bases.\n\nA REAL ID offers Kentuckians a single credential to use for multiple purposes, such as passing airport security checkpoints and verifying your identity for purchases. Until federal REAL ID enforcement begins May 7, 2025, current standard driver’s licenses offer the same benefits as a REAL ID. Beginning May 7, 2025​, a standard driver’s licenses will not be accepted to board domestic flights or to enter restricted federal facilities.\n\nHere is a list of IDs that fly:\n\n​Any Kentucky REAL ID driver’s license, permit or ID\n\nU.S. passport\n\nU.S. passport card\n\nDHS trusted traveler card (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)\n\nU.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents\n\nPermanent resident card\n\nBorder crossing card\n\nDHS-designated enhanced driver’s license\n\nFederally recognized, tribal-issued photo ID\n\nHSPD-12 PIV card\n\nForeign government-issued passport\n\nCanadian provincial driver’s license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card\n\nTransportation worker identification credential (TWIC®)\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card (I-766)\n\nU.S. Merchant Mariner Credential\n\nYou can apply for a REAL ID now at any Driver Licensing Regional Office!\n\nIf your expiration date is six months or more after the date you apply, you may upgrade to REAL ID for $15. This will allow you to obtain a REAL ID credential that maintains your current credentials expiration date until you are eligible to renew your credential. ​\n\nTo learn what required documents you need to update and gather now, take the IDocument Guide quiz or review a list of acceptable documents here.\n\n​\n\nApplicants requesting a new REAL ID or first-time standard driver’s license will need to present documentation proving identity (such as a certified birth certificate, U.S. passport or Permanent Resident Card), social security number (such as a social security card or W-2 form), and proof of residency (such as a utility bill or lease; two proofs required for a REAL ID).\n\nTo renew a standard driver’s license or personal ID, applicants will only need to surrender their current license. Personal identification cards require the same verification documents as a license.\n\nIf you wish to obtain a certified copy of your birth certificate, contact the vital statistics agency in the state of your birth. Those born in Kentucky may contact the Kentucky Office of Vital Statistics.\n\nTo request a replacement Social Security card, visit the Social Security Administration's website.\n\n**If your current legal name, date of birth, or gender is different than what is displayed on your identity or lawful status document, you must present additional documentation, such as a marriage license or divorce decree. No hard copies of the documents presented during the application process will be kept.\n\nView our list of acceptable documents.​​\n\nMany people change their names due to marriage, adoption, divorce or other reasons. In order to obtain a REAL ID or first-time standard credential, you must provide proof documents that show a direct link between your name changes. Those documents include a marriage certificate, divorce decree, legal name court order or valid U.S. Military ID card. If your name has changed due to marriage, you will need to request a new social security card that matches your current legal name before applying for a new credential.\n\nFor example, if your birth certificate displays your maiden name but your social security card displays your married name, you’ll need to bring a certified copy of your marriage certificate to link the documents. If you’ve lost your birth, marriage or divorce certificate, you will need to obtain a certified replacement copy. If you have a U.S. passport or passport card that matches your current legal name, you can use that document as proof of identity and legal presence, in place of a birth certificate.\n\nIf your present gender is different than what is listed on your identity document (such as a birth certificate or passport), you will need to present a court order changing gender marker or a letter from the surgeon that completed the gender reassignment.\n\nIf the birth date on your current license is not correct, you will need to present a birth certificate to ensure your new credential reflects the correct date.\n\nTo find out what additional documents you may need to provide, view our list of acceptable documents.\n\n​"
