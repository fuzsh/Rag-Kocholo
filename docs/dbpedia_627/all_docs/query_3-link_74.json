        "text": "When some Certificate of Titles were created, they included a sketch of the land, indicating boundaries, area and dimensions of the lot. We now use digital titles instead of paper titles as the register record for new parcels of land. As the sketch of the land was previously hand drawn onto the paper title, these are no longer available on the digital Certificate of Title.\n\nIf the original paper title included a sketch, you can order a copy through Land Enquiry Services if you have a MyLandgate billing account. If you donâ€™t have a MyLandgate account, you will need to complete the Manual request for paper title or SMR digital history list form and forward it to Landgate for processing\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase a plan separately from the LES stie, which shows the legal boundary and survey dimensions.\n\nSample of a Certificate of Title with sketch\n\nPerches, acres, roods, chains and links are Imperial (pre-metric) units of measurement used by surveyors during the 1800s.\n\nOne rood is equal to 1/4 acre or 40 perches. To convert acres, roods and perches to square metres, use our online area conversion calculator.\n\nOne chain equals 100 links. To convert chains or links to metres, use our online distance conversion calculator.\n\nA hectare is a metric measurement. One hectare equals 10 000 square metres."
