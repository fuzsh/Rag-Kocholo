        "text": "Boating - Title and Register a Watercraft or Outboard Motor in SC\n\nIn the state of South Carolina, the law requires all motorized boats and watercraft, except exempted vessels, sailboats, and all outboard motors five horsepower and greater to be titled. By law we must have your completed application and other required documents, which vary by purchase or selling situation, to title and register your boat and/or motor. When purchasing a watercraft or outboard motor, make sure it is titled/registered to the person you are buying it from.\n\nMost Common Titling and Registration Situations:\n\nImportant Property Tax Information Video\n\nPurchased From an SC Owner with SC Titles - Watch Video Tutorial\n\nPurchased From an SC Owner with Missing Titles - Watch Video Tutorial\n\nPurchased Out of State From a Titling State - Watch Video Tutorial\n\nPurchased Out of State From a Nontitling State - Watch Video Tutorial\n\nPurchased Used Out of State from a Dealer\n\nCasual Excise/Use Tax Change:\n\nIf you purchase an outboard motor as a single unit, the casual excise tax is calculated at 5% with a $500.00 cap.\n\nThe casual excise tax rate has not changed for a watercraft or watercraft/outboard motor purchased as a unit. The casual excise tax rate for a watercraft or watercraft and outboard motor purchased as a unit is 5% with a $500.00 cap.\n\nIf you are selling a boat and/or motor in South Carolina:\n\nYou must be the titled owner. If you are not the titled owner of the boat or outboard motor you are selling, you must complete the application process with SCDNR prior to the sale.\n\nIf you have purchased a boat or motor that has ever been titled and/or registered in South Carolina:\n\nPay your property taxes in your name with your county\n\nSubmit a paid property tax receipt in your name or notice from the county that no taxes are due with your application and other supporting documents.\n\nIf you have purchased a boat or motor out-of-state or from a SCDNR permitted marine dealer:\n\nProperty taxes will be billed by your county after being titled and/or registered with SCDNR.\n\nOnce purchased, your boat and/or motor may be used 60 days from the date of purchase, even with expired or out-of-state decals using your temporary certificate number and copies of your title or bill of sale.\n\nIf you have questions about boat titling and registration, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions. If you have any questions about your property taxes, please contact your county tax office.\n\nOther Titling and Registration Situations\n\nIf you are trying to register a watercraft or outboard motor in SC and your situation is a little more unique than the four main methods listed above, then please select one of the following options:\n\nBoats purchased from an Estate or by Inheritance\n\nHomemade Boats & Motors\n\nBoat with No Hull ID Number, Motor with No Serial Number\n\nRepossessed Boat/Motor\n\nMagistrate's Sale, Lien for Storage, Mechanics Lien\n\nFound, Abandoned or Unable to Complete the Chain of Paperwork\n\nDocumented Vessels\n\nA Boat that has never been used with a motor"
