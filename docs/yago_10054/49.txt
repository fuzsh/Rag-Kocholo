Loose Moose improv veteran David Lawrence best known for his portrayal of beloved hesher Terry in the Fubar movies dropped his directorial debut in A Legend of Whitey which also brings in Fubar actors Paul Spence Andy Sparacino and Gordon Skilling.

The film is a faux-western set in 1880s Alberta. Shot in Longview there are some truly impressive shots of the vast prairies and big skies. Unfortunately the film’s comedy is less enthralling.

Aiming for a different vibe than their long-haired alter-egos Lawrence and Spence try for a subtler brand of humour that is paired with a story about a Native legend involving a white buffalo but the film’s pacing is off. The jokes they do crack are of the juvenile frat-boy mentality involving gay panic and mistaken oral sex. Combine that with an often slow story that’s aiming for serious Canadiana and A Legend of Whitey just doesn’t flow.

If you’re a diehard fan of these local comedy veterans you’ll want to see A Legend of Whitey purely so you can watch the actors try their hand at something else. For everyone else you won’t be missing anything if you skip this.

When the talking points about this film are that these dudes made the Fubar movies it’s a surefire sign that they should have just made Fubar III .
