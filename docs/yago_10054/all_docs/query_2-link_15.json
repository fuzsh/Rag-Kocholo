Emma is Luke's daughter. She tells her family she's off to embark on a work trip to Colombia, but is actually undercover as Dani (with the code name Panda) in Guyana – and has been for some time. When her and her father figure out they've both been harbouring secrets, a lot of complicated family history starts to come to the fore.\n\nWhat else has Monica Barbaro been in? Barbarro is perhaps best known for her leading roles in UnREAL, Chicago Justice and The Good Cop. She has most recently starred in Paramount Plus rom-com At Midnight and Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger plays Luke Brunner\n\nWho is Luke Brunner? Luke is on the verge of retirement and couldn't be more excited to live out his post-retirement dream, which revolves around winning back Tally, his ex-wife. But he's soon got bigger issues to worry about when HQ inform him that he needs to return to Guyana for a new mission.\n\nWhat else has Arnold Schwarzenegger been in? The action movie icon, former bodybuilder and Californian governor, has had a long career - with some of his most notable roles being in The Terminator film franchise, Predator, Commando, True Lies and more.\n\nFUBAR marks the first major TV series role of Schwarzenegger's.\n\nMilan Carter plays Barry Putt\n\nWho is Barry Putt? Barry is one of Luke's colleagues and a family friend, who's essentially his right-hand man at work. He's the one to inform him of the new mission that means Luke has to hold off retirement for a while.\n\nHilariously, Barry has known about Emma's CIA involvement all along, despite Emma not knowing his true working identity either.\n\nWhat else has Milan Carter been in? Carter has starred in Warped!, Dolemite Is My Name, The Neighborhood and Marvel's Runaways.\n\nGabriel Luna plays Boro Polonia\n\nWho is Boro Polonia? Boro is the son of Omar Polonia, someone that Luke killed 25 years prior in another operation. Luke managed to get Boro into a boarding school in London, but even so, Boro is intent on honouring his father's legacy and growing his paramilitary organisation, Lape Pa Lanmo - which now has over 400 devoted members.\n\nHis illegal arms sales have caught the attention of the CIA, but his right-hand man Troy knows the true identity of Panda and is planning to expose her, which leads Luke (undercover as Finn Hoss) to Guyana once more.\n\nWhat else has Gabriel Luna been in? Luna is perhaps best known for playing Ghost Rider in Agents of SHIELD, while he has also had major roles in Terminator: Dark Fate, True Detective and the film Eddie & Sunny. Most recently, though, Luna has starred in HBO's The Last of Us as Pedro Pascal's onscreen brother, Tommy.\n\nJay Baruchel plays Carter Perlmutter\n\nWho is Carter Perlmutter? Carter is Emma's boyfriend, who works as a kindergarten teacher and is unaware of Emma's CIA job. Despite his well-meaning demeanour, Luke doesn't exactly warm to him as a partner for his daughter.\n\nWhat else has Jay Baruchel been in? Baruchel is known for his voice acting as Hiccup Haddock in the How to Train Your Dragon film franchise, as well as roles in She's Out of My League and This Is the End.\n\nTravis Van Winkle plays Aldon Reece\n\nWho is Aldon Reece? Aldon is one of the operatives that works with Luke and is a bit of a joke, but is just as surprised to learn about Emma's involvement in their branch of the organisation.\n\nWhat else has Travis Van Winkle been in? Van Winkle starred in the third season of Netflix's You as Cary Conrad, and has also starred in Transformers, Friday the 13th and Instinct.\n\nFortune Feimster plays Ruth 'Roo' Russell\n\nWho is Ruth 'Roo' Russell? Roo is one of the other operatives that works alongside Luke and Barry, who is often seen cracking jokes with Aldon.\n\nWhat else has Fortune Feimster been in? The writer, comedian and actress is perhaps best known for her role as Colette in The Mindy Project and as Heather in The L Word: Generation Q. She has also featured in RuPaul's Drag Race, Nailed It! and The Simpsons.\n\nAparna Brielle plays Tina Mukerji\n\nWho is Tina Mukerji? Tina is an analyst on loan from the NSA, drafted in to help with the current Boro Polonia operation. Although she's not met with the warmest of welcomes from her new colleagues, her intelligence and skill are undeniable.\n\nWhat else has Aparna Brielle been in? Brielle has starred in American sitcom AP Bio, Grimm and The Librarians.\n\nFUBAR comes to Netflix on Thursday 25th May 2023. Sign up for Netflix from £4.99 a month.
