        "text": "Luke Brunner (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his daughter Emma (Monica Barbaro) have lied to each other for years, neither of them knowing that the other is a CIA operative. Once they both learn the truth, they realise they don't actually know anything about each other. Will the two be able to live with each other any longer? Will the two hide their secret lives from the rest of their family? Will things ever be the same between the father-daughter? Will there be any more secrets in the closet? Will they ever be able to join forces for a mission? Well, for all that, you’ll have to watch the show.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger may be 75, but he still can pull off the swagger like no one else. From the cigars to leather jackets to the punches and smouldering looks, he brings the total package. Even though you miss seeing Arnold doing action the way he used to do in his younger days, but he is still great to watch onscreen. What’s good about the character is how close to reality it is and how nonchalantly Arnold has portrayed it. Even though he doesn’t show up a lot of emotional depth or facial expressions in his performance, he manages to make it have his own quirks and gives it a fun twist whenever needed.\n\nMonica Barbaro proves yet again she is not just good looks but can pull off a great character as well. Playing the character of a daughter, she manages to bring in a certain amount of relatability to the character with respect to their parents – something that all sons and daughters would relate to. The belligerence that she brings against her father for not having spent time with her in her childhood is a feeling that most children go through, and to be able to bring that so perfectly onscreen definitely deserves praise. Even though it’s not a complex character, keeping the simplicity intact and making it look effortless also requires a great amount of hard work, and that shows onscreen.\n\nJay Baruchel has a small character yet he manages to manages to stand out with the quirks and the innocence with which he portrays it onscreen. At the back of your head, you would be wishing for his character to somehow end up having a comeback in the climax or post-credits where he is actually shown having a sinister angle, and that entire innocence is just a façade – that’s the kind of subtext and cerebral inquisitiveness that Baruchel brings to the character.\n\nCait Duffy, Michael J. Gutierrez, Nick Santora, Lillian L Wang, Adam Higgs, Scott Sullivan and Penny Cox’s writing is what makes you want to watch glimpses of the show again and again despite having seen it all the way through till the end once. The characters are relatable. To add to that the entire crux of the father-daughter bonding after getting to know each other’s secret lives is hilarious and you’ll be left with a quaint smile at the way their bonding grows. Bringing those two characters alive and with the kind of character arc given to them – that’s what makes the writing such an integral part of the series.\n\nPhil Abraham, Steven A. Adelson, Holly Dale and Stephen Surjik’s direction is the best part of the show. Every episode has a quirky way of giving out the show’s title ‘Fubar’. However, till the very end, you’re left in surprise as to what it actually means. Maintaining that mystery even after 8 episodes is fantastic. To add to that there’s the 4 directors have had their own episodes, but never for once do you feel a disconnect between episodes or see a different style of presentation. They’ll have managed to keep an equilibrium and make all the episodes equally entertaining.\n\nCraig Wrobleski, Colin Hoult and Michael McMurray’s cinematography is one of the highlights of the show. The exotic locales and the chase sequences were the absolute best. Both had been shot so well that it helps you want to watch the show again and again.\n\nThe editing by J.J. Geiger, Eric Seaburn, Anthony Miller and Sang Han is probably the only thing that’s not up to the mark in ‘Fubar’. The series could have been edited slightly here and there which would have taken away a bit of the dull angles in the middle. It would have made it crisper and tighter had it been finished in about 6 or 7 episodes.\n\nTony Morales’s music is also unimpressive. There’s nothing that draws you to the show and makes you feel like you’re right there alongside the characters. The background music is too plain and doesn’t have the necessary spunk that an action comedy usually has.\n\n‘Fubar’ brings the light-hearted action-comedy genre back and how! The concept in itself is novel, and you’ll be left hooked on to the storyline right from the very first episode. Despite that, you would have either wished for a few episodes lesser, or a few more plotlines introduced so as to keep you guessing with different plots till the finale comes. Besides that, the acting of the two leads is praiseworthy as their father-daughter chemistry is bang on. It’s definitely a fun One Time Watch. I am going with 3 stars."
