Just ask Montreal entertainer Paul Spence, who co-starred in American director Todd Haynes’ Montreal-shot 2007 Bob Dylan biopic I’m Not There. The film boasted an incredible cast: The Oscar-nominated Cate Blanchett, Ben Wishaw, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger (who would die just two months after the film was released), Richie Havens, Bruce Greenwood, Michelle Williams, Christian Bale, Kris Kristoferson (as the narrator), Julianne Moore and Richard Gere. Not to mention local actors like Mark Camacho, Kyle Gatehouse, Tyrone Benskin (the onetime Black theatre Worskshop artistic director, now an NDP MP in Ottawa) and Paul Spence.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nFubar’s Paul Spence - a.k.a.

In one scene Gere is supposed to hop on his horse and ride off. But during one take the horse took a crap on Gere’s boots. During another take, Spence recalls, “Gere – one of the most handsome, dashing leading men in Hollywood – fell off his horse into a pile of horses–t! It was a classic moment. So Gere gets up like nothing happened and he’s covered in horses–t. So like the lowest person on the totem pole went to help him. Even Todd went [to help] brush his jacket off, that’s how awkward it was!”\n\nFilmgoers and rock fans may mostly remember Spence as Dean Murdoch – a.k.a. The Deaner – the moustachioed cancer survivor and metal head in the two hilarious Fubar faux documentaries. And this weekend in Montreal Spence winds down his cross-Canada Fubar’s Deaner on Tour with his hard-rock band Nightseeker (which also features Roy Vucino and Ian Wilson on guitars, Pouf on drum and Spence on “warlock” bass).\n\nThe Deaner starts off each concert himself doing a commentary on Fubar II. When the band storms the stage, Spence stays in character throughout the show. “There really is no other way to do it because people come out and want to see and meet The Deaner,” Spence says happily. “It’s part of the ticket price. The Deaner has such a following. It’s amazing to see how hosers and idiots like the Trailer Park Boys and The Deaner have become Canadian icons!”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe entertainer in Spence admits, “Dean is an easy part to play. It’s easy to be funny when I’m Dean. I get to be crass and say stupid things. It’s fun and easy to slip into.”\n\nWhereupon Spence morphs into The Deaner. So I ask The Deaner about this nonstop partying and famed shotgun challenges on this tour. “At first I have to say I was little bit nervous because I was like, ‘How the f–k am I going to swing this?’ Cuz I figured I’d be doing 10-20 a night. But I figured it out and I don’t do too many shotguns until I actually play [onstage]. Then I’ll do a couple of shotguns onstage. Then I’ll do as many as I can after the show! And that’s been working out real good!”\n\nNightseeker are playing covers on this tour by such bands as Boston, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden, but the setlist is mostly comprised of songs from their two Fubar soundtracks. “We’re playing the real rock – straight up Judas Priest and AC/DC-type rock and roll. We’re going to punish your ears!”\n\nThen Spence reveals he has nearly finished writing the script for a new a Bruce Macdonald film “about four girls who start a band and a death cult where if they get a Number One record they’ll kill themsleves onstage – and of course they get a Number One record!” The film is expected to go into production in 2012.\n\nThen slipping back into character as The Deaner, he says, “We’re [also] talking about filming Fubar 3-Deaner! It’s going to involve a lot of spaceships, time travel and a s–tload of laser beams!”\n\nThe Fubar tour headlines Montreal’s Les Katacombes (1635 St. Laurent) on Dec. 3.
