        "text": "The Genie Award nominations were announced this morning. For the international readers, the Genie Awards are basically the Canadian Academy Awards. Unlike the Brits though we only nominate from within. The awards will be handed out March 10th in Ottawa at the National Arts Centre. A lot of you out there have not seen any of these films. Hell, most Canadians haven’t even seen these films, BUT the point remains- we should.\n\nI am very surprised by the Best Picture nominees as one of my top ten films of the year happened to actually be Canadian (Trigger, directed by Bruce McDonald) and didn’t make the cut which is absolutely ludicrous. This was a particularly great year for English Canadian cinema so I find it odd to see so many French language films once again. So I suppose what really shocked me is the English Canadian films that were chosen are fairly mainstream and generally not very good films. Incendies will absolutely win the category but it would have been a much more honest ‘race’ had they went with (in my opinion) Incendies, The Trotsky, Trigger, Defendor and I’ll leave the last option blank as I have many bias’. I have not seen 10 1/2 yet either so perhaps that film is great enough to deserve the nomination. While I do believe Xavier Dolan is a truly great filmmaker, Heartbeats is not nearly as good as I Killed My Mother. I can’t say much more without getting myself in trouble as I know too many people in the Canadian film industry who might take offense but just know that the Best Picture nominations do not represent the very best in Canadian film. Like anywhere else politics have a lot to do with the nominations.\n\nAlso just wanted to give a big shout out to a film that I production designed and that is very close to my heart, At Home By Myself… With You, which received a nomination for Best Original Score. Congratulations go out to Keegan Jessamy and Bryce Mitchell (Bryce also produced the film). They are two ridiculously talented people and I wish them all the luck in the world on awards night.\n\nHere is essentially a list of some great Canadian viewing such as Trigger, Incendies and The Trotsky (… and, in my opinion, some not-so-great Canadian viewing re: Resident Evil: Afterlife among others).\n\nBEST MOTION PICTURE\n\n10 1/2 – Pierre Gendron\n\nLES AMOURS IMAGINAIRES / HEARTBEATS – Xavier Dolan, Carole Mondello, Daniel Morin\n\nBARNEY’S VERSION – Robert Lantos\n\nINCENDIES – Luc Déry, Kim McCraw\n\nSPLICE – Steven Hoban\n\nACHIEVEMENT IN DIRECTION\n\nXAVIER DOLAN – Les amours imaginaires / Heartbeats\n\nRICHARD J.
