        "text": "So I just ran across a trailer for a new movie called Deaner 89 - apparently this is a character first created in some kind of Canadian mockumentary called Fubar from several years ago. Anyway, as usual , any character in a movie that enjoys or plays 80s metal is always portrayed as a bug-eyed buffoon. I'm thinking of movies like Rock Star, Hot Rod, Tenacious D Pick of Destiny , That's My Boy. I actually like these movies - but it seems like any movie that tackles 80s metal always portrays it in a satirical manner as if the genre itself is a joke. I guess it doesn't help when the bands themselves play into this like Europe did a few years ago in that commercial.\n\nMaybe its just me, but from what I can remember living through those times was that the people who enjoyed it - they truly liked it for real and not in some ironic, wink-wink way.\n\nI look at a movie like Straight Outta Compton that seems to respect the genre its portraying and it would be cool to see movie or biopic centered around 80s metal with the same level of filmmaking. I was hoping that the Netflix Motley Crude bio The Dirt would be the one to do this but really its treated pretty much as a joke as well and that was with the full participation of the band itself.\n\nMaybe the bands themselves are to blame with the excess and flamboyant Over the top style and it was just too much for it to be ever be taken seriously ever again.\n\nI guess here's a question - has there ever been a movie or a character in a movie who was an 80s metal head where the character wasn't portrayed as a complete joke?\n\nLords of Chaos is exactly what you're looking for."
