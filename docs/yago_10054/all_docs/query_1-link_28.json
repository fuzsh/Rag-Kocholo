        "text": "Creating a High Quality Video Production for P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery\n\nBack in 2021, our team were approached by P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery Founder and CEO Paul Spence to help produce a brand-new video production for the charity.\n\nBased in Kingston upon Hull, P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery is a community-based support and guidance service that helps to support anyone affected by brain injury. The charity aims to improve quality of life after brain injury by offering the practical coping skills and knowledge to help manage daily living, avoid crisis and to rebuild a meaningful life.\n\nIn this case study, we will explore how our videography team captured and produced a brand-new, high-quality video.\n\nBackground\n\nIn preparation for this project, our creative team liaised with Paul Spence to discuss his aims and objectives. From here it was established that Paul was looking to create a promotional video for individuals have suffered from brain injury and looking for support. The video would help viewers to understand the diversity of their service users attending the sessions and activities at the charity, and showcase that they are not alone.\n\nFrom here, it was agreed that Eon Visual Media would aim to produce a promotional video which would help to showcase the amazing work carried out by a service user led group called P.A.U.L for Brain Recovery Heroes. In addition to this, our video would also help to explain the origin and story of the P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery charity, and showcase the incredible work carried out by staff and volunteers.\n\nAfter reviewing the project brief, our creative team developed a storyboard which would address the overall objectives of this project and help communicate P.A.U.L For Brain Recoveryâ€™s messages. After gaining approval on our storyboard, our videography team travelled to the P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery centre to begin filming.\n\nWhat We Did\n\nFor our film shoot, our videography team used a variety of techniques to capture a wide range of footage of the P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery centre. This featured a variety of shots from around the recovery centre, as well as additional behind-the-scenes shots of P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery Heroes, staff, and volunteers.\n\nIn addition to capturing this footage, our team also conducted a variety of interviews with the P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery Heroes. These highly emotive pieces to camera created a sense of gravitas and allowed each hero to share their powerful stories.\n\nAfter capturing all the required video shots, our videography team edited all this footage into a full stunning video production which can be seen here! ðŸ‘‰\n\nOutcome\n\nAfter editing all our footage, this was submitted to P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery, and our team were highly praised for producing a high-quality film. From here, the video was widely used on their website and across their various social media platforms.\n\nFeedback from P.A.U.L For Brain Recovery Founder and CEO Paul Spence can be seen here! ðŸ‘ˆ\n\nSummary\n\nAt Eon Visual Media, our friendly team of creators can collaborate with you to develop a professional and high-quality video to help promote your brand, business, and events. With our expertise, our creative team can help to create entertaining and engaging corporate video productions which can help your brand communicate your stories.\n\nWant to find out more?
