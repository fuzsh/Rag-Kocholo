        "text": "There were glittering tiaras galore this week at the royal wedding banquet in Amman, but the ladies of the Dutch royal family sparkled particularly brightly. Here’s a closer look at the jewels they wore for the occasion.\n\nThe King and Queen of the Netherlands were joined by their eldest daughter, the Princess of Orange, for their trip to Amman this week for the celebrations of the wedding of Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa of Jordan. Princess Amalia didn’t attend Thursday’s royal wedding ceremony, but she was on the guest list for the banquet held that evening.\n\nDelightfully, that meant that we got not one but two Dutch royal ladies in gowns and tiaras for the banquet. Queen Máxima wore a dazzling gold dress with rich embroidery and jeweled embellishments, while Princess Amalia wore her first gown from one of her mother’s favorite designers, Jan Taminiau. Both also added sashes and stars to their gowns: Máxima wore the insignia of Jordan’s Supreme Order of the Renaissance, while Amalia wore the insignia of her highest Dutch order, the Order of the Netherlands Lion.\n\nFor her jewels, Queen Máxima opted for diamonds, diamonds, and more diamonds. She selected one of the smaller settings of the Stuart Tiara for the banquet. (It’s the setting she wore in Germany in the summer of 2021.) She added a diamond rivière, plus two pieces of jewelry from Queen Wilhelmina’s collection: her diamond pendant earrings and her diamond scroll brooch.\n\nI also spotted the smaller of the two Dutch East Indies Bracelets on Máxima’s left wrist.\n\nWith her red gown, Princess Amalia went for diamonds and rubies, making her first appearance in pieces from both of the family’s ruby parures. She wore the Ruby Peacock Tiara, made by Schürmann in 1897 using rubies that had belonged to Queen Sophie (1818-1877), the first wife of King Willem III. Her earrings and brooch come from the family’s other ruby set: the Mellerio Ruby Parure, which was commissioned by King Willem III in 1888 as a Christmas gift for his second wife, Queen Emma.\n\nAmalia finished off the look with one more piece from Queen Emma’s ruby suite: the diamond and ruby bracelet from the set, worn on her right wrist.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Court Jeweller Newsletter\n\nEnter your name and email address below to subscribe to our weekly newsletter!"
