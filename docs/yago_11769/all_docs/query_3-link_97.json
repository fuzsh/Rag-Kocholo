        "text": "Named the ‘most beautiful woman of the British royal family’ by Tatler magazine in 2016, Lady Amelia Windsor is a must-know member of the British royals. The 25-year-old socialite, model, and cousin of Prince Harry and Prince William has a particular interest in fashion and has been committed to charitable organizations for many years. Vogue looks a closer look at this celebrity-to-watch.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nShe is the cousin of Princes Harry and William\n\nA member of the House of Windsor, daughter of George and Sylvana Windsor, the Earl and Countess of St Andrews, Lady Amelia Windsor is the cousin of Prince Harry and Prince William. Her grandfather, the Duke of Kent, is the first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. She is 38th in line to the British throne and has two siblings, Edward, Lord Downpatrick, 29 years old, and Lady Marina, 25 years old.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nShe works with several fashion houses\n\nAt only 25 years old, Lady Amelia Windsor shares her passion for fashion through the lens of her Instagram. First a hobby, now a veritable professional pursuit — she has been seen twice on the catwalk, in Fall/Winter 2017-2018 and Spring/Summer 2018 for the Italian house Dolce & Gabbana, alongside Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana. As well as modelling, Lady Amelia Windsor has had the chance to work abroad for large houses, such as Azzedine Alaïa and Bulgari, as told by The Telegraph, and has also been spotted at front rows of shows such as Dior, Schiaparelli, and Philiosophy di Lorenzo Serafini.\n\nShe was named the “most beautiful member of the British royal family”\n\nLady Amelia Windsor is a model at Storm agency, the same agency that scouted Kate Moss at the New York John F. Kennedy Airport in 1988, and her beauty has also been recognized by Tatler magazine, who named her “the most beautiful woman of the British royal family” in 2016. Her charm and pout have seduced the catwalks as well as Instagram, where she shares her daily life to more than 84,000 followers.\n\nMore fashion on Vogue.fr:\n\nWhere to buy the trendiest fabric masks online\n\nIman and David Bowie in 20 inspiring couple photos\n\nMore from Vogue on YouTube:"
