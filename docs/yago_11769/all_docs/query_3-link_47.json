        "text": "Today was the first day of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and there were loads of European Royals in attendance.\n\nOn Thursday, Princess Claire celebrated her 39th birthday. New photos of Princess Claire with her husband and children were shared by Château Les Crostes.\n\nOn January 7th, Princess Claire gave birth to her third child at the Maternité Grand Duchess Charlotte in Luxembourg. Prince Félix and Princess Claire’s newborn son is named Balthazar Félix Karl.\n\nOn Monday, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa shared new photos of the Grand Ducal Family’s summer holidays in their home in Cabasson in the South of France.\n\nOn Sunday, the Grand Ducal Family took part in the celebrations marking the closing of the Octave. The Octave is the Protector of Luxembourg and she is celebrated for two weeks each year.\n\nEvery year, UFO No More counts the number of days worked by several royal families. We hope that learning about how many days these families worked during the year might help you put their totals in the “How Much Is It All Worth?” post into perspective."
