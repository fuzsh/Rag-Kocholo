        "text": "Amalie von Sachsen\n\nAbout the composer\n\nAmalie Marie Friederike Auguste, Princess of Saxony was born in 1794 in Dresden (Germany). She was the eldest daughter of Prince Maximilian (1759–1838) and Caroline von Bourbon–Parma (1770–1804).\n\nThe princess received a comprehensive musical education. She played the violin, piano, sang, and started composing at an early age. Her teachers included Joseph Schuster, Franz Anton Schubert, Vincenzo Rastrelli, Aloys Miksch, and Carl Maria von Weber.\n\nBetween 1812 and 1835, she composed several songs, a string quartet, church music, twelve operas and a ‘singspiel’. The operas are ‘dramma giocoso’ with Italian libretti. The Singspiel is in the German language. She often used the pseudonym A. Serena. Performances mostly took place within the royal family circle at the summer residence, Pillnitz Castle, or at the Dresden Princes’ Palace on Taschenberg. Her church musical compositions were heard in the Dresden Court Church. Carl Maria von Weber often conducted her works, and the already famous Dresden Court Orchestra played them.\n\nStarting in 1835, Amalie von Sachsen, under the pseudonym Amalie Heiter, exclusively wrote plays and libretti for operas and operettas. These plays were highly successful and were performed on many German stages and, in several translations, abroad as well. Her creative career was cut short in 1851 due to an eye ailment.\n\nAmalie von Sachsen passed away on September 18, 1870, in Pillnitz and was interred in the crypt of the royal family at the Dresden Court Church."
