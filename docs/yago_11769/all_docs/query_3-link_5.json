        "text": "It looks like Princess Amalia of the Netherlands might just have found the man to match her for royal punching power. Privé, a Dutch magazine, has linked her to Boris of Bulgaria, raising speculation to a simmer about whether the pair are really involved. If the rumours are true, it would certainly make quite the royal match.\n\nCrown Princess Amalia is 20-years-old and the heir apparent to the throne of the Netherlands. The man in question is 26-year-old Boris, son of the late Prince Kardam of Turnovo and now Prince of Turnovo himself; in other words, heir to the defunct throne of Bulgaria. The throne may be defunct, but Boris is certainly bringing plenty of historical royal clout with him – the Madrid-born princeling is a Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; a series of surnames which may sound familiar to fans of our own Queen Victoria.\n\nThe name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, as the Royal Family website reports, ‘came into the British Royal Family in 1840 with the marriage of Queen Victoria to Prince Albert, son of Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Coburg & Gotha. Queen Victoria herself was the last monarch of the House of Hanover.’ As many royal boffins know, ‘it was King George V, who replaced the German-sounding title with that of Windsor in 1917 during the First World War.’ So the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty lasted for exactly sixteen years in Britain; the nine years' reign of Edward VII and the first seven of George V's. Nevertheless, the name has survived in other European monarchies, such as those of Portugal and Bulgaria.\n\nBoris’s father – Prince Kardam – passed away in 2015 at the age of 52. The monarchy in Bulgaria was swept away in 1946, out of the ashes of war, as the People’s Republic of Bulgaria was established. The Tsar, Simeon II, went into exile, as such bringing an end to the kingdom of Bulgaria and ushering in the communist era. The establishment of the People’s Republic was the death knell for a monarchy which had existed since some time in the 7th century – though as living-Boris proves, the dynasty goes on.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRumours about Boris and Princess Amalia gathered pace when they were spotted attending the wedding of the Duchess of Medinaceli last October. Boris is known as an independent-minded young royal, who has carved his own path away from his family, studying as a sculptor at the London School of Fine Arts in Wimbledon. His mother, Miriam Ungría y López’s remarriage in 2022, meanwhile, has brought Boris a link to another royal family (they sure know how to pick ‘em). Miriam married Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a cousin of King Abdullah II of Jordan, making Boris a pretty well-connected character, when all's said.\n\nIt has been reported in Hola! that Boris and Amalia share social crowds in Madrid and other international cities they spend their time in. When Amalia pops from the Netherlands to Madrid, they often spend time together. Boris is pretty familiar with London, having studied in Wimbledon – and reports have it that his mother and his brother Beltrán accompanied him while he was sculpting here. Hola! adds that Boris and Amalia have known each other for a good while, since the families are friends. (Always a good sign for a match!) Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander are known to have flown to Madrid after the death of Boris’s father, Prince Kardam, to attend his funeral and support their family friends."
