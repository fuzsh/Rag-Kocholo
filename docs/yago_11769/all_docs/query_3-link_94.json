        "text": "Like any other family, royal families can either be super conservative in their baby names, or buck tradition entirely. Either way, we can’t help but see them as trendsetters whenever their offspring are announced. Whether we’re talking about the British monarchy or the royals of Europe, Africa, and Asia, there is one thing these parents have in common (um, besides wealth and power) — the names they choose for their children are full of meaning.\n\nWhether they use a handful of middle names hearkening back to past monarchs or first names chosen to denote virtues or religious tenets, royals do not mess around when it comes to naming the future of the nobility. And while it might seem stuffy or old-fashioned to all of us commoners, it’s a tradition not taken lightly.\n\nEven if your baby isn’t going to have four middle names and a hereditary title, scrolling through royal names is a great way to find inspiration for your baby name list. That, too, is something of a tradition — see the many Georges, Victorias, Williams, and Elizabeths you know and love. We highly encourage looking a little deeper into the royal family tree, and at the royals around the world, for names that are a little more unexpected. How about an Alexia, Leonor, or Hassan, for instance? Moulay or Sverre?\n\nAnd hey, unlike royal families, if you don’t want to name your firstborn after a multiple-times-great grandfather or a centuries-dead monarch, at least you won’t end up causing an international scandal.\n\nA version of this story was published in 2021."
