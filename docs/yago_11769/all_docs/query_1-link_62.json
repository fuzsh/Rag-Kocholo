        "text": "This is with fairly incomplete data, as I haven't gotten very far on Monaco yet, but still... I think it is interesting.\n\nAlbert of Monaco (1848-1922) married Mary Douglas-Hamilton, who was the daughter of Marie Amalie of Baden (daughter of Karl Ludwig of Baden and Stephanie de Beauharnais (of Leuchtenberg). From there and backwards, you have a connection to pretty much everyone... I guess\n\nAndrea Casiraghi is related in at least three ways to Frederik of Denmark, as far as I can figure out, with my incomplete data - with (Karl Friederich of Baden & Caroline of Hesse-Darmstadt) (Karl Ludwig of Baden & Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt) and (Claude de Beauharnais and Renee Hardouineau).\n\nA very small mistake here, not a big deal, really: Stéphanie de Beauharnais was not a Leuchtenberg, as the title duke of Leuchtenberg was given to Eugène de Beauharnais and was transmitted to his descendants. As for Stéphanie, her father was Eugène's father cousin (and when Eugène was created duke of L. by the king of Bavaria, she was already married in the Baden family).\n\nThe Grimaldis are not as closely related to the other royal houses as those houses are to one another, because they are, in truth, no more than French aristocrats who became rulers by an accident of History (the survival of Monaco as an independant state), and I say that with no disrespect. Up to the 17th century, they were serving Spain, so they tended to marry Italian and Spanich noblewomen. After they began serving France, they married French noblewomen, and it must be noted that they are French since the early 18th century, when the Goyon-Matignon and then the Polignac took over Monaco and the Grimaldi name.\n\nYou can find another link to German princely families through Antoinette de Mérode, prince Albert 1st's mother here:\n\nPedigree for Comtesse Antoinette de Merode\n\nYou can also note that, since the 17th century, only one Monaco princess has descendants in other royal houses (if you don't count princess Florestine and the Urach family): Teresa-Maria Grimaldi, an ancestor of the houses of Austria-Este, Bourbon-Parma, Bavaria, Luxembourg, etc...\n\nTeresa Maria Grimaldi\n\nThe Grimaldis are not as closely related to the other royal houses as those houses are to one another, because they are, in truth, no more than French aristocrats who became rulers by an accident of History (the survival of Monaco as an independant state), and I say that with no disrespect. Up to the 17th century, they were serving Spain, so they tended to marry Italian and Spanich noblewomen. After they began serving France, they married French noblewomen, and it must be noted that they are French since the early 18th century, when the Goyon-Matignon and then the Polignac took over Monaco and the Grimaldi name.\n\nWell... to the best of my knowledge the Grimaldis are Italians, from Genoa to be precise. You can visit their palace in Genoa, which is currently undergoing restoration.\n\nOne branch came to Spain and proved their nobility before the Military Orders of Santiago (1539, 1654 and 1724) and Alcántara (1623 and 1629) Don José de Grimaldo (sic), Knight of the Toison d'Or, was created Marquess of Grimaldo on the 4th of March 1715. Don Jerónimo Grimaldi was create Duke of Grimaldi on the 8th of April 1777.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Spanish Grimaldi family is identical to the Italian and Monegasque ones. What changes is the external decoration according to their position and hierarchy.\n\nThere are very strong links amongst the members of those different branches of the same family.\n\nA very small mistake here, not a big deal, really: Stéphanie de Beauharnais was not a Leuchtenberg, as the title duke of Leuchtenberg was given to Eugène de Beauharnais and was transmitted to his descendants. As for Stéphanie, her father was Eugène's father cousin (and when Eugène was created duke of L. by the king of Bavaria, she was already married in the Baden family).\n\nThe Grimaldis are not as closely related to the other royal houses as those houses are to one another, because they are, in truth, no more than French aristocrats who became rulers by an accident of History (the survival of Monaco as an independant state), and I say that with no disrespect.

Her biological father was Claude de Beauharnais and his father and Eugène's father (Josephine's first husband) were first cousins. Stephanie married a Prince of Baden and their granddaughter married Monaco's Albert I. Although married briefly, they had a son, whose descendant Albert II is now The Prince of Mónaco. Albert II's younger sister Princess Stephanie is elder Stephanie's namesake.\n\nSdB's other dayghter was Princess Josephine Friederike Luise of Baden. On 21 October 1834 at*Karlsruhe, she married*Karl Anton Joachim Zephyrinus Friedrich Meinrad, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, son of*Charles, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen*(1785–1853) and his wife*Marie Antoinette Murat*(1793–1847).\n\nTheir children were:\n\nLeopold*(1835–1905)\n\nStephanie*(1837–1859), Queen consort of*Pedro V, King of*Portugal*(1839–1914),\n\nKing of*RomaniaAnton*(1841–1866), died in battle.\n\nFriedrich*(1843–1904)\n\nMarie*(1845–1912), married*Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders\n\nThrough her eldest son Leopold and also through her daughter Marie, she is the ancestress of the*Romanian royal family*and the*Yugoslav Royal Family. Through her daughter Marie, she is also the ancestress of the Belgian royal family and the Grand Ducal family of Luxemburg.\n\nNot only was P Stephanie of Monaco named in honor of SdB, but so was the future Queen Stephanie of Portugal, consort of Pedro V, as was P Stephanie of Belgium, a future Archduchess of Austria.\n\nOnly using basic information you can draw the obvious conclusión that the Princely Family of Monaco are related to many other royal/grand ducal/princely houses of Europe."
