        "text": "Catharina-Amalia Beatrix Carmen Victoria, the Princess of Orange, Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau is one of three daughters by King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima. Her specific title (Princess of Orange) refers to the 14-year-old’s place in royal succession. She is the heir to the throne.\n\nAriane Wilhelmina Máxima Ines, Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau is the youngest of the three daughters. She is ten years old and is third in the line of succession. In addition to attending school, all three sisters ride horses, play hockey, and play the piano.\n\nEstelle Silvia Ewa Mary, Princess of Sweden, Duchess of Östergötland is second in the line of succession for the Swedish throne, after her mother, Crown Princess Victoria.

The 14-year-old also made an impression on Kate Middleton and Prince William when they visited the country on their Scandinavian tour. If you’re wondering how a lot of the European royals are connected, one example is Princess Ingrid Alexandra’s godparents, who are Crown Prince Fredrik of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, and King Felipe VI of Spain.\n\nHis Highness Prince Sverre Magnus is the brother of Princess Ingrid Alexandra and is third in line for the throne. The 12-year-old also has very royal godparents, including Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece.

He also has a younger sister, Ameerah Wardatul Bolkiah.\n\nThree-year-old Princess Gabriella is one half of the royal twins of Monaco. The granddaughter of Grace Kelly was born two minutes before her brother, but is not next in line for the throne. The twins are the children of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene.\n\nPrince Jacques is the heir to the principality and the twin brother of Princess Gabriella. Although he is younger, the line of succession passes to him as the first-born son. You can keep up with all of the twins' royal fun via their mother's Instagram.\n\n14-year-old Prince Moulay Hassan, son of King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma, is heir to the throne. He has a younger sister, Princess Lalla Khadija, who is ten.\n\nPrince Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck is the two-year-old son of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema. He is the heir to the throne of Bhutan, which is a constitutional monarchy.\n\nTwelve-year-old Leonor, Princess of Asturias is the oldest daughter of King Felipe VI and the always chic Queen Letizia.
