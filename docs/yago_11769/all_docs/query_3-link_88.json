        "text": "Royal princesses\n\nThe fascination with the monarchs' extraordinary lives has only increased over the years. With tabloids providing more insights, the world is witnessing princesses from across the globe, setting a mark with their uniqueness. Some are known for leading the way in the fashion stakes and others are known for their fierce spirit and noble causes. These princesses are living embodiments of grace, responsibility and dedication to their heritage and society.\n\nPrincess Padmaja Kumari Mewar\n\nAs the daughter of the House of Mewar, one of the world's oldest reigning dynasties, Princess Padmaja Kumari Mewar is a woman of substance, dedicating her life to philanthropy, hospitality and health causes that span continents. Her commitment to these causes reflects her regal heritage. She is also the third generation of heritage hoteliers at the Historic Resort Hotels, commonly known as the HRH Group of Hotels.\n\nAmelia Windsor, British royal family\n\nLady Amelia Windsor is one of the most fashionable members of the British royal family today. Unlike most royals who avoid social media, she is very active on Instagram. She is the daughter of George Windsor, the Earl of St Andrews, and Sylvana Tomaselli, a lecturer in history at St John's College Cambridge.\n\nCatharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange\n\nCatharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange is the heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which consists of the constituent countries of Aruba, Curacao, the Netherlands, and Sint Maarten. She is the eldest child of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima.\n\nCatherine, Princess of Wales\n\nIn the years since Kate Middleton married Prince William and became the Duchess of Cambridge and now the Princess of Wales, she has grown into one of the United Kingdom's prominent charitable advocates for children, mental health, and the arts.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Belgium\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Belgium will one day succeed her father, King Philippe, to become Queen of Belgium. She graduated from Atlantic College, in Wales, in 2020 before entering the Belgian Military Academy later for four weeks.\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway is the eldest child of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit. She is second in line of succession to the Norwegian throne and is expected to become the country's second female monarch, after the 15th-century Queen Margaret.\n\nPauline Ducruet of Monaco\n\nPauline Ducruet is the granddaughter of the late Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III of Monaco and is currently 16th in line to the Monegasque throne. Her royal status is not the only reason for her being in the spotlight. She has an Olympic diving background and is a designer of her own gender-fluid fashion line."
