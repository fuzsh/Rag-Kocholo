        "text": "The princesses of Orange-Nassau\n\nPrincess Amalia was born in The Hague on 7 December 2003. She is the firstborn of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima, her official name is Catharina-Amalia Beatrix Carmen Victoria Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Oranje-Nassau. She was named after her grandmothers Beatrix and Carmen and after crown princess Victoria of Sweden. Since her father became the king, the princess is the first in line to the throne. This makes Amalia the most famous princess in the Netherlands. So well-known in fact, that there are reportedly more than seventy streets, tunnels and viaducts in the Netherlands named after the princess.\n\nPrincess Amalia has two younger sisters, the Princesses Alexia and Ariane. Alexia was born on 26 June 2005 and Ariane on 10 April 2007. All three were born at the Bronovo Hospital in The Hague. They spent most of their childhood at Eikenhorst on the De Horsten estate in Wassenaar. In January 2019, they moved with King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima to Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague.\n\nHow the princesses are raised\n\nAll three Dutch princesses go to a regular school like any other Dutch child. Not only do the children speak Dutch and Spanish at home, their parents also teach them English. As such, they are raised trilingually. Despite being the most famous sisters in the Netherlands, the media mostly leaves them alone. This gives them room to do their own thing and to grow as persons.\n\nThe princesses have several hobbies and preferred activities after school as well. Princess Amalia loves hockey, judo, ballet, horse riding and playing the violin. Princess Alexia also likes ballet and horse riding and plays the piano in addition to hockey and tennis. Princess Ariane likes to play the piano and also loves ballet, swimming and judo."
