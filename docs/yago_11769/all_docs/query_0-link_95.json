Through her mother she was descendant of King Frederick William II of Prussia.\n\nMarriage\n\nMarie Antoinette married on 4 January 1925 in Wildenfels to Friedrich Magnus V, Count of Solms-Wildenfels (1886–1945), only son of Friedrich Magnus IV, Count of Solms-Wildenfels and his wife, Jacqueline, Baroness Bentinck.\n\nThey had four children:\n\nCountess Anne of Solms-Wildenfels, born on 1 January 1926 (1926-01-01) (age 85)\n\nFriedrich Magnus, Count of Solms-Wildenfels, born on 18 January 1927 (1927-01-18) (age 84)\n\n∝Katharina Duerst (m.1948, div.1954/m.1966), had issue.\n\n∝Gisela Frania (m.1971 div.1972), no issue.\n\n∝Gisella Marie Parsoll (m.1994), no issue.\n\nCountess Jutta of Solms-Wildenfels, born on 12 February 1928 (1928-02-12) (age 83)\n\n∝Salim Farid Saad (m.1957)\n\nCount Albert of Solms-Wildenfels, born on 28 May 1929 (1929-05-28) (age 82)\n\n∝Ingrid Gross (m.1970)\n\nCountess Kristin of Solms-Wildenfels, born on 27 May 1938 (1938-05-27) (age 73)\n\n∝Dietrich Gross (m.1971)\n\nHouse of Schwarzburg\n\nOn April 21, 1896 her father was recognised as a dynast of the House of Schwarzburg having previously not had dynastic rights due to his parents morganatic marriage.[1]\n\nFollowing her brother's death in 1971 in the House of Schwarzburg became extinct in the male line. However the Schwarzburg principalities operated under Semi-Salic primogeniture which means that in the event of the extinction of all male dynasts, as happened with the death of Prince Friedrich Günther, females can inherit. Therefore, Marie Antoinette presumably became the head of the House of Schwarzburg. At her death in 1984, her elder son Friedrich Magnus would had become the titular to the principalities of Schwarzburg.[1]\n\nTitles and styles\n\n7 February 1898 – 28 March 1909: Her Serene Highness Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt\n\n28 March 1909 – 4 January 1925: Her Serene Highness Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg\n\n4 January 1925 – 4 November 1984: Her Serene Highness The Countess of Solms-Wildenfels\n\nAncestry\n\nNotes and sources"
