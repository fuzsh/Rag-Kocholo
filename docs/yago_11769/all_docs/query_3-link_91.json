        "text": "When Princess Charlene of Monaco stepped out for an engagement last week, it wasn’t her husband, Prince Albert II, who stood by her side, but an unfamiliar face.\n\nRead More\n\nPrincess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands proves she’s every inch a queen-in-waiting on final stop of royal Caribbean tour\n\nThe Princess of Orange joined her parents, King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima, for a busy roster of engagements in Saba\n\nThe immaculately coiffured brunette, sophisticated in a blazer and silk camisole, joined Charlene, 45, as she attended mass to commemorate Saint Devote, the patron saint of Monaco. The previous night, the royal aide was again by the princess’s side as she took her children to an evening event that involved burning a model boat on which Saint Devote is said to have travelled.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair Spain, the royal insider is Melanie-Antoinette Costello de Massy, the daughter of Prince Albert’s cousin, Baroness Elizabeth Ann de Massy, who served as a support for his parents, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco.\n\nOn Princess Stéphanie of Monaco’s 59th birthday, Tatler revisits her best style moments\n\nRead More\n\nMelanie-Antoinette supported Princess Charlene of Monaco as she ventured out without her husband, who was keeping a low-profile after being diagnosed with Covid-19 for a third time. The two appeared perfectly at ease with each other; suggesting a personal connection and closeness that is undoubtedly much-needed in the fishbowl of royal life.\n\nAn understated presence, Melanie-Antoinette was also on hand to help Prince Albert at public engagements during Princess Charlene’s period of extended absence: firstly, at home in South Africa; then at an overseas inpatient clinic where she received treatment for ‘exhaustion’. Notably, Melanie-Antoinette attended the Saint Devote commemorations and the Monte Carlo Masters with the reigning prince.\n\nTatler’s tiara of the month: the tragically romantic history of the Greek royal family’s Khedive of Egypt diadem\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, there was a time when Elizabeth and Melanie-Antoinette’s privileged position at the very heart of the Monégasque royal family was far from guaranteed. Indeed, Elizabeth’s mother, Antoinette de Monaco, Baroness de Massy, the elder sister of Prince Rainier III, once tried to oust her younger brother as ruler of the principality.\n\nThe tensions began with the arrival of Elizabeth, who was born outside of wedlock to Antoinette and her partner, Alejandro Athenase Noghès, an international tennis champion and lawyer. The birth was met with much fanfare as Elizabeth was the first grandchild of Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois, who, as the illegitimate daughter of the then ruling Prince Louis II, was heir presumptive to the throne (she later renounced her rights in favour of her only son, Rainier). However, it was only once Antoinette and Alejandro married in 1951 that Elizabeth was added to the line of succession.\n\nRead More\n\nRoyal Family turn out in force for celebratory Buckingham Palace reception\n\nThe King and Queen Consort were joined by Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, the Duke of Kent and the Duchess of Goucester to receive members of the British East and South-East Asian communities\n\nAntoinette and Alejandro welcomed two more children, Baron Christian Louis and Baroness Christine Alix, before divorcing in 1954. Antoinette then began a relationship with Jean Charles Rey, president of the Monégasque parliament.\n\nTogether, according to Vanity Fair, Antoinette and Rey hatched a plan to dethrone Rainier, who was unmarried and had no children. They reportedly spread a rumour that his girlfriend, the French actress Gisèle Pascal, was unable to conceive, apparently in the hope the lack of heir would spook parliament into recognising her son, Christian Louis, then just a young boy, as next in line to the throne – and make Antoinette regent until he came of age.\n\nRead More\n\nRevealed: the young Spanish royals you’ve never heard of\n\nPrincess Leonor and Princess Sofia might be well-known… but how about their six glamorous cousins?\n\nIt is thought the rumours partly drove the end of Rainier and Pascal’s relationship. Shortly afterwards, he met Grace Kelly, whom he married in 1956. Kelly, the legendary actress-turned-royal, is credited with convincing her husband to expel his ambitious older sister.\n\nAntoinette went on to marry – then divorce – Rey, before walking down the aisle for a third time with British ballet dancer John Brian Gilpin, who died of a heart attack just six weeks after their 1983 wedding. In between the ups and downs of her colourful love life, Antoinette was readmitted to the court and given a handful of honorary positions.\n\nElizabeth inherited her mother’s positions, and won her cousin Prince Albert’s trust: she has represented him at royal engagements and has been photographed by his side at official events. Now, it seems, it is the turn of her daughter, Melanie-Antoinette.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much of a formal role she will play in the life of Charlene and Albert, but certainly, having another trusted ally would surely only be a boon to the princess, who has her parents by her side in Monaco as she makes a full return to royal duties after her extended absence and treatment for ‘exhaustion’.\n\nPerhaps her husband’s cousin is just the right-hand woman she needs."
