        "text": "Prince Félix and Princess Claire of Luxembourg introduced their first child, Princess Amalia, to the world this week. The royal baby was born on June 15, and the couple posed for pictures as they left the hospital on Tuesday. The little one's full name is Princess Amalia Gabriela Maria Teresa, which pays tribute to her grandmothers, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa and Gabriele Lademacher. Prince Félix and Princess Claire got married this past September in a gorgeous fairy-tale wedding in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, France, following a civil ceremony in Princess Claire's home country of Germany. Celebrate their new arrival with a look at Princess Amalia's adorable debut!"
