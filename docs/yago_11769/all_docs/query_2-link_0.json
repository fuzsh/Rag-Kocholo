        "text": "Duchess Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria\n\nPrincess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Marie Luise Franziska Amalie; 23 October 1848 – 6 May 1894) was a Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha by birth and a Duchess in Bavaria through her marriage to Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria. Amalie was the fourth child and second eldest daughter of Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife Princess Clémentine of Orléans. Her youngest brother was Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and her paternal uncle was Ferdinand II of Portugal.\n\nLife\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincess Amalie was born in Coburg, Germany, to Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife, Princess Clémentine of Orléans. Since childhood, Amalie had been intended as the bride of Prince Leopold of Bavaria.[1] However, Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria fell in love with her and confided this love to his sister Elisabeth.[citation needed]\n\nElisabeth—the empress of Austria and queen of Hungary—became determined to ensure her favorite brother's happiness,[2] for she invited Leopold to an extended visit with the imperial family, among those who attended was her own fifteen-year-old daughter Archduchess Gisela of Austria. There, Leopold was tactfully made aware that a marriage with Gisela would be looked upon with favor by Emperor Franz Joseph. If Leopold was to marry Gisela, he would become the emperor’s son-in-law; upon realizing this, he accepted and became engaged to Gisela after only a few days.[3]\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nDuke Maximillian and Princess Amalie were married on 20 September 1875 in Ebenthal, Lower Austria, Austria-Hungary.[1] The marriage was, by all accounts, a very happy one.[citation needed]\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nAmalie and Maximilian Emanuel had three children:\n\nSiegfried, Duke in Bavaria (10 July 1876 – 12 March 1952)\n\nChristoph Joseph Clemens, Duke in Bavaria (22 April 1879 – 10 July 1963)\n\nLuitpold Emanuel, Duke in Bavaria (30 June 1890 – 16 January 1973)\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 6 May 1894, at the age of 45, Princess Amalie died due to peritonitis.\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
