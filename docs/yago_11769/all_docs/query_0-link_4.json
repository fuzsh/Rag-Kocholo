Born in Wallisfurth, Kingdom of Prussia (now Wolany, Poland) on June 28, 1799, she was the daughter of Duke Ludwig of Württemberg and Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nAmalie had four siblings:\n\nDuchess Maria Dorothea (1797-1855) – married Archduke Josef, Palatine of Hungary, had issue\n\nDuchess Pauline (1800-1873) – married Wilhelm I, King of Württemberg, had issue\n\nDuchess Elisabeth (1802-1864) – married Prince Wilhelm of Baden, had issue\n\nDuke Alexander (1804-1885) – married Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde, had issue, the Teck family descends from this morganatic marriage\n\nAmalie also had one half-brother from her father’s first marriage to Princess Maria Czartoryska:\n\nDuke Adam – (1792-1847) – unmarried\n\nOn April 24, 1817, Amalie married Hereditary Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen. He was the son of Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (later Duke of Saxe-Altenburg) and Duchess Charlotte George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The couple married in Kirchheim unter Teck in Württemberg, and had six daughters:\n\nPrincess Marie (1818-1907) – married King George V of Hanover, had issue\n\nPrincess Pauline (1819-1825) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Therese (1823-1915) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Elisabeth (1826-1896) – married Peter II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, had issue\n\nPrincess Alexandra (1830-1911) – married Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich of Russia, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1832-1833) – died in infancy\n\nAfter her marriage, she became involved with charitable causes in her new home. In 1819, she founded the Industrial School for orphaned children in Hildburghausen and founded a Woman’s Association the following year. After her father-in-law became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg in 1826, the family moved to Schloss Altenburg, and she continued with her philanthropic work, establishing several schools and institutions in Altenburg.\n\nDespite her efforts, Amalie was never very popular with the people of Saxe-Altenburg, who found her very haughty and proud. This contributed to the growing discontent of the working class people, leading up to the Revolution in 1848 which would bring about her husband’s abdication.\n\nDuchess Amalie of Saxe-Altenburg died on November 28, 1848, in Altenburg, Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, now in Thuringia, Germany. Two days after her death, her husband was forced to abdicate the throne of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg and was succeeded by his younger brother Georg. Amalie was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in the Altenburg Cemetery. In 1974, the remains of those buried in the Mausoleum were removed and reburied in the grounds of the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

After Friedrich IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg died in 1825 without heirs, the Ernestine duchies were reorganized. Gotha passed to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld becoming the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Altenburg passed to Friedrich. In exchange, the two Dukes ceded Saalfeld and Hildburghausen, respectively, to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nAs World War I ended, the last Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, Ernst II, was one of the first German sovereigns to realize that major changes were coming and quickly arrived at an amicable settlement with his subjects. He abdicated on November 13, 1918. Today the territory that encompassed the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg is located in the German state of Thuringia.\n\n********************\n\nJoseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg\n\nJoseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg was born Hereditary Prince Joseph Georg Friedrich Ernst Karl of Saxe-Hildburghausen in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany, on August 27, 1789. He was the second, but eldest surviving, son of Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (later Duke of Saxe-Altenburg) and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. His godparents included Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, King George III of Great Britain, and King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia. Joseph had 11 siblings:\n\nPrince Joseph (born and died 1786) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Katharina Charlotte (1787-1847) – married Prince Paul of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Caroline (born and died 1788) – died at birth\n\nPrincess Friederike (born and died 1791) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Therese (1792-1854) – married King Ludwig I of Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1794-1825) – married Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, had issue\n\nPrince Franz Friedrich (1795-1800) – died in childhood\n\nGeorg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1796-1853) – married Princess Marie Luise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had issue\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm (1801-1870) – unmarried\n\nPrince Maximilian Karl (born and died 1803) – died in infancy\n\nPrince Eduard Karl (1804-1852) – married (1) Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had issue; (2) Princess Luise Caroline Reuss of Greiz, had issue\n\nAfter his initial education at home, he studied at the University of Erlangen. Beginning in 1814, he served in the Prussian Army, serving alongside his brother Georg during the Wars of Liberation. He retired from active service in 1816 but maintained several honorary positions.\n\nJoseph married Duchess Amalie of Württemberg on April 24, 1817, in Kirchheim unter Teck, Kingdom of Württemberg, now in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. She was the daughter of Duke Ludwig of Württemberg and Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg. Together, they had six daughters:\n\nPrincess Marie (1818-1907) – married King Georg V of Hanover, had issue\n\nPrincess Pauline (1819-1825) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Therese (1823-1915) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Elisabeth (1826-1896) – married Peter II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, had issue\n\nPrincess Alexandra (1830-1911) – married Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich of Russia, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1832-1833) – died in infancy\n\nAs Hereditary Prince, Joseph had basically ruled alongside his father for the last few years of his father’s reign. In 1833, acting on his father’s behalf, he reinstated the Saxe-Ernestine Ducal Order along with the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. He became Duke upon his father’s death on September 29, 1834. His reign saw the construction of several prominent buildings in Altenburg and the construction of a Ducal Mausoleum in the Altenburg cemetery. He also continued with the restoration of Altenburg Castle, a project begun by his father upon arriving in Altenburg in 1826.\n\nAs a ruler, Joseph was very conservative and against any sort of reform. With unrest spreading through Europe in 1848, Joseph quickly brought in troops to squash the growing demands for a free state in Altenburg. Despite his attempts, the people refused to back him and Joseph was forced to abdicate on November 30, 1848, just two days after the death of his wife. As he had no male heirs, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Georg.\n\nJoseph moved to Schloss Fröhliche Wiederkunft, his castle in Wolfersdorf, where he spent the next fifteen years restoring and expanding the estate. He lived for nearly 20 years after his abdication, dying in Altenburg, Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, now in the German state of Thuringia, on November 25, 1868, and was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in Altenburg Cemetery. Per his wishes, his heart was buried at Schloss Fröhliche Wiederkunft. In 1974, all of the remains in the mausoleum were removed and buried in an unmarked grave elsewhere in the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The marriage was unhappy from the beginning, and Friedrich mostly ignored his wife who was far more intelligent than he was. Despite this, the couple had 12 children:\n\nPrince Joseph (born and died 1786) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Katharina Charlotte (1787 – 1847) – married Prince Paul of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Caroline (born and died 1788) – died at birth\n\nJoseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1789-1868) – married Duchess Amalie of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Friederike (born and died 1791) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Therese (1792-1854) – married King Ludwig I of Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1794-1825) – married Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, had issue\n\nPrince Franz Friedrich (1795-1800) – died in childhood\n\nGeorg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1796-1853) – married Duchess Marie Luise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had issue\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm (1801-1870) – unmarried\n\nPrince Maximilian Karl (born and died 1803) – died in infancy\n\nPrince Eduard Karl (1804-1852) – married (1) Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had issue; (2) Princess Luise Caroline Reuss of Greiz, had issue\n\nDespite her husband’s disinterest, Charlotte became much loved by the people of Saxe-Hildburghausen. She gave very generously to causes and charities that helped the poor and funded numerous programs that provided education and training to the less fortunate. Charlotte also supported the arts and brought many musicians and artists to court. She also became known as one of the best singers of her time. Having taken lessons as a girl in Hanover, the Duchess often sang in both court and church events.\n\nEight years before her husband became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, Charlotte died after a long illness in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany on May 14, 1818. Per her wishes, she was to be buried in the new city cemetery (Stadtfriedhof) in Hildburghausen. She was initially buried in the Hildburghausen Castle Church in the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany. Her remains were moved to the Hildburghausen Stadtfriedhof in 1819, the first burial in the new cemetery. Her tomb, a large bronzed pillar atop what is known as the Ducal Mound, was completed in 1824. The mound is now also the burial site of several of the previous Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen and their wives. Other members of the Saxe-Altenburg family are buried elsewhere in the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He abdicated on November 13, 1918. Today the territory that encompassed the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg is located in the German state of Thuringia.\n\n*******************\n\nFriedrich, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg was born in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany, as The Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Hildburghausen on April 29, 1763, the only son of Ernst Friedrich III, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and his third wife, Princess Ernestine of Saxe-Weimar. He had two sisters:\n\nPrincess Sophie (1760-1776) – married Hereditary Prince Franz Friedrich Anton, later Franz Friedrich Anton, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, no issue, died of influenza six months after her marriage\n\nPrincess Christine (1761-1790) – married her uncle, Prince Eugen of Saxe-Hildburghausen, no issue\n\nFriedrich also had two half-sisters from his father’s first two marriages, both of whom had died in infancy.\n\nFriedrich was educated privately at home and later spent some time at the court in Gotha learning about the workings of government. He was presented to the Austrian court in 1779 and served in the Austrian military. At just 17 years old, he became Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen upon his father’s death in 1780. Because of his youth, a Regency was established, led by his great-grand-uncle, Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The Regency continued even after he reached his majority, ending only with Joseph’s death in 1787.\n\nOn September 3, 1785, Friedrich married Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the daughter of Carl II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. The marriage was happy at first, but soon Friedrich realized that his wife was far more intelligent than he was, and began to ignore her. Despite this, the couple had 12 children:\n\nPrince Joseph (born and died1786) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Katharina Charlotte (1787-1847) – married Prince Paul of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Caroline (1788) – died at birth\n\nJoseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1789-1868) – married Duchess Amalie of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Friederike (born and died 1791) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Therese (1792-1854) – married King Ludwig I of Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1794-1825) – married Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, had issue\n\nPrince Franz Friedrich (1795-1800) – died in childhood\n\nGeorg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1796-1853) – married Duchess Marie Luise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had issue\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm (1801-1870) – unmarried\n\nPrince Maximilian Karl (born and died 1803) – died in infancy\n\nPrince Eduard Karl (1804-1852) – married (1) Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had issue; (2) Princess Luise Caroline Reuss of Greiz, had issue\n\nUpon taking control of his government in 1787, he quickly established a trade agreement with Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. He improved the education system and established several schools in Hildburghausen. He also worked to improve the duchy’s financial situation. Due to his father’s poor fiscal policies, the Duchy was under the official administration of the Imperial Debit Commission and horribly in debt. Joining the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 saw a marked change in the duchy’s financial state, coming out of administration and seeing an increase in income. This was further enhanced by joining the German Confederation in 1815. By the time he issued a new constitution in 1818, both the Duchy and the Duke himself were in a greatly improved financial position.\n\nAlong with his wife, the much-loved Charlotte Georgine, Friedrich worked to bring art and culture to Saxe-Hildburghausen, turning it into one of the cultural centers in Germany. He made sure to remain close to his subjects, often inviting people of all classes to his palaces, visiting inns and workshops around the duchy, and bringing about initiatives that helped the poor. Charlotte Georgine, Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen died eight years before her husband became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, German on May 14, 1818, after a long illness.\n\nFriedrich became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg in 1826. After Friedrich IV, the last Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg died in 1825 without heirs, the Ernestine duchies were reorganized. Gotha passed to Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (becoming the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), and Altenburg passed to Friedrich. In exchange, the two Dukes ceded Saalfeld and Hildburghausen, respectively, to Bernard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nLeaving Hildburghausen after living there for 63 years was very difficult for Friedrich, but he moved to Altenburg in November 1826. He took up residence at the Hummelshain Hunting Lodge (Jagdschloss Hummelshain) while a massive restoration was undertaken at Altenburg Castle. Keeping to his promise to the people of his new duchy, Friedrich enacted a constitution in April 1831 and worked to improve the infrastructure and streamline the government and reinforce trade with the other German states.\n\nEight years after becoming Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, Friedrich died on September 29, 1834, at the Hummelshain Hunting Lodge in Hummerlshain, now in Thuringia, Germany. He was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in the Altenburg Cemetery in Altenburg, Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, now in Thuringia, Germany. In 1974, all the remains were removed from the mausoleum and were buried in an unmarked grave elsewhere in the cemetery\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was given a long string of names: Alexandrine Marie Wilhelmine Katharine Charlotte Theresia Henriette Luise Pauline Elisabeth Friederike Georgine. Marie was born as a Princess of Saxe-Hildburghausen, but in 1826 she became a Princess of Saxe-Altenburg due to a transfer of territories within her family.\n\nMarie had five sisters:\n\nPauline (1819 – 1825), died young\n\nTherese (1823 – 1915), unmarried\n\nElisabeth (1826 – 1896), married Peter II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, had issue\n\nAlexandra (1830 – 1911), married Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia, son of Nicholas I, Emperor of All Russia; had issue, their daughter Grand Duchess Olga Konstantinovna and her husband King George I of Greece (born Prince William of Denmark) are ancestors of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Sofía of Spain, and five Kings of Greece.\n\nLuise (1832 – 1833), died young\n\nIn 1839, Marie met Crown Prince George of Hanover at Schloss Monbrillant, a summer palace of the Hanovers. George was the son of Ernest Augustus, the fifth son of George III of the United Kingdom, who had inherited the throne of Hanover upon the accession of his niece Victoria in 1837. Up until that point, Hanoverian kings of the United Kingdom were also Electors or Kings of Hanover. However, Hanover followed the Salic Law which did not allow female succession. Ernest Augustus, as the eldest surviving male, became King of Hanover.\n\nCrown Prince George was totally blind, having lost sight in his left eye due to illness when he was ten years old and the sight in his right eye due to an accident four years later. There were some doubts about his ability to be king due to his blindness, but his father decided to keep him in the line of succession. Marie and George were married on February 18, 1843.\n\nThe couple had three children:\n\nErnst August, Crown Prince of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, 3rd Earl of Armagh (1845 – 1923), married Princess Thyra of Denmark; had issue; under the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act, he was deprived of his British peerages and royal titles for bearing arms against Great Britain\n\nPrincess Frederica of Hanover, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland (1848 – 1926); married Litubert, Baron von Pawel-Rammingen; had issue\n\nPrincess Marie of Hanover, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland (1849 – 1904), unmarried\n\nGeorge succeeded his father as King of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, as well as Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and Earl of Armagh, in the Peerage of Ireland, on November 18, 1851, and Marie assumed the female counterparts of the styles and titles. George V of Hanover reigned for only 15 years, being exiled from Hanover in 1866 as a result of his support for Austria in the Austro-Prussian War. On September 20, 1866, Hanover was annexed by Prussia. George never abdicated from the throne of Hanover and he and Marie lived in exile at Gmunden, Austria, until his death in 1878. After George’s death, Marie continued living in the Villa Thun in Gmunden which became known as the Queen’s Villa and is still owned by the House of Hanover. She died on January 9, 1907, and was buried in the mausoleum at Schloss Cumberland in Gmunden, Austria. Through her son Ernst Augustus, Marie is the ancestor of former King Constantine I of Greece, his sister Queen Sofia of Spain, Sofia’s son King Felipe VI of Spain, and Prince Ernst Augustus of Hanover (husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco).\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
