        "meta_description": "This portrait, with its snakeskin background, has traditionally been identified as Princess Louisa Amalia but it bears little resemblance to other known portraits of her. Princess Louisa was the daughter of Ferdinand Albert, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. In 1742, she married Prince Augustus William of Prussia who was the brother and heir to Frederick the Great, but died before him. Their son became Frederick William II, King of Prussia.The identity of the artist is unknown.",
