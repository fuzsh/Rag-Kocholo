        "text": "Last night's state banquet in the Netherlands didn't disappoint on the jewelry front.\n\nTiaras were a must for royal women at the event celebrating the visit of King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain, and in particular, all eyes were on Princess Catharina-Amalia, as it was her first appearance at a state banquet. The heir apparent to the throne chose the Ruby Peacock Tiara for the event and paired it with a matching necklace and earrings. She previously wore the historic piece which, per the royal jewelry blog the Court Jeweller, dates back to the late 1800s, at last year's Jordanian royal wedding.\n\nPrincess Amalia and Queen Maxima of The Netherlands ahead of the wedding banquet of Crown Prince Al Hussein Bin Abdullah of Jordan and Rajwa Al Saif.\n\nThe young Princess has a keen eye for jewelry. \"I love tiaras, she told writer Claudia de Breij . \"Show me a tiara, and I'll know where it came from. I can recognize all the tiaras of Europe. I used to put them on from my mother. Then there would be one on her make-up table and I would have it directly on my head.\"\n\nCertainly then, she appreciated Queen Maxima's choice of the stunning Stuart Tiara, which, too, dates back to the end of the 19th century. An extremely versatile piece, it can be worn in several different configurations of stones. Last night, she opted to pull out all the stops with the nearly 40-carat pear-shaped Stuart Diamond affixed to the topper.\n\nQueen Maxima in the stunning Stuart Tiara.\n\nWhile Maxima sparkled in diamonds, Queen Letizia showcased pearls—though the guest of honor at the diplomatic dinner wasn't entirely without sparkle. In addition to her diamond and pearl loop tiara, Letizia also paired her royal blue ball gown with diamond earrings and a pearl and diamond brooch.\n\nQueen Letizia paired a rich royal blue ball gown with diamond and pearl jewelry.\n\nNotably, all the key royal women in attendance—including King Willem-Alexander's aunt Princess Margriet and his mother Princess Beatrix—wore shades of silver and blue, making for rather color-coordinated portraits.\n\n(From top L) Dutch Princess Margriet, Dutch Crown Princess Amalia, Dutch Princess Beatrix. (From bottom L) Spanish Queen Letizia, Spanish King Felipe, Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Dutch Queen Maxima.\n\nIn his speech last evening King Willem-Alexander shared several personal ties to Spain, noting that it is the country where he and Queen Maxima first met. \"Spain has a special place in our hearts. First of all, because it was in your country that our life together began. We were at the Feria de Abril in Seville 25 years ago. The sparks began to fly. The rest is history,\" he said. He also thanked the Spanish king and queen for their assistance in helping Princess Amalia study abroad in Madrid, after security threats made it difficult for her to live in student housing at the University of Amsterdam."
