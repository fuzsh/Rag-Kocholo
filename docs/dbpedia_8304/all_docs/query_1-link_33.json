        "text": "Pieter Abbeel (Associate Professor, UC Berkeley EECS) works in machine learning and robotics, in particular his research is on making robots learn by watching people (apprenticeship learning) and how to make robots learn through their own trial and error (reinforcement learning). His robots have learned: advanced helicopter aerobatics, knot-tying, basic assembly, and organizing laundry. His awards include best paper awards at ICML and ICRA, Young Investigator Awards from AFOSR, ONR, Darpa and NSF, the Sloan Fellowship, the MIT TR35, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Early Career Award, and the Dick Volz Best U.S. Ph.D. Thesis in Robotics and Automation Award.\n\nTom Abel is Professor of Physics at Stanford University, Director of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at SLAC, and Director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology. His group explores the first billion years of cosmic history using ab initio supercomputer calculations. He has shown from first principles that the very first luminous objects are very massive stars and has developed novel numerical algorithms using adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations that capture over 14 orders of magnitude in length and time scales. He currently continues his work on the first stars and first galaxies and their role in chemical enrichment and cosmological reionization. His group studies any of the first objects to form in the universe: first stars, first supernovae, first HII regions, first magnetic fields, first heavy elements, and so on. Most recently he is pioneering novel numerical algorithms to study collisionless fluids such as dark matter which makes up most of the mass in the Universe as well as astrophysical and terrestrial plasmas. Prof. Abel graduated from the Ludwig Maxemillian University of Munich and conducted post-doc research at both Cambridges, in England and MA. He joined Stanford and SLAC in 2004. He received multiple honors in both continents (including a Career Award from the National Science Foundation) and was elected fellow of the AAAS in 2014.\n\nDor Abrahamson is currently Assistant Professor of Cognition and Development in UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Education.

Following the publication of two monographs, The Unseen Peninsula, his tribute to the Crystal Springs Watershed on the San Francisco Peninsula in 1995 and Eighteen Days in June, published as a fund-raiser for the Djerassi Resident Artists Program in 2000, he surrendered the use of cameras, lenses, and computers in search of what might lay beyond the traditions of the medium. Working directly with large sheets of photographic film, living plants are used as a filter through which high-voltage electricity and fiber-optically-delivered light are passed. The resulting images open a window on the beauty of natural form, and were compared by the Los Angeles Times with photographs of our universe made by the Hubble Telescope. As a result of this new work, he has had over 60 solo exhibitions in the United States, Canada and Germany, and been the subject of essays published in 26 languages on 6 continents. Buelteman has also enjoyed multiple residencies at venues including Stanford University, Santa Fe Institute, Djerassi Artists Program, and the Santa Fe Art Institute.

She works with artists, dancers, scholars, technologists, coders and musicians to understand how we might live and move in a technologically mediated world with humor, grace, deliberation, responsibility, and a sense of play. Her first book project, Tracing Electronic Gesture: A Poetics of Mediated Movement, focuses on the choreographic coupling of human bodies and new media art of the 21st century. Examining hybrid human-machine gestures in such digital art objects and practices as virtual dance, electronic poetry and musical controllerism, she maps the potential of these kinetic engagements to generate new forms of sensory experience and creative agency.

In collaborative work with colleagues at NASA Ames, Deamer showed that photochemical reactions simulating those occurring in the interstellar medium give rise to soap-like molecules that can self-assemble into membrane structures. This confirmed earlier studies in which Deamer demonstrated that microscopic vesicles were produced by similar molecules present in carbonaceous meteorites. These results led to a new hypothesis about how primitive forms of cellular life could appear on the early Earth, which will be described in his talk.\n\nLydia Degarrod, who teaches Critical Studies and Diversity Studies at the California College of the Arts, is both a visual artist and a cultural anthropologist who creates installations that blur the line between ethnography and art in order to convey experiences of extraordinary nature and address issues of social justice.
