        "text": "Although some attention has recently been paid to the role of life drawing in the history of American art, hardly anything at all has been written about the evolution of professional art modeling in this country. What follows is the result of a piecemeal investigation into the use and employment of artists' models in nineteenth century America, specifically the evolution of their professional status within the fine arts academies. My concern has been to correlate the use of models in art schools with their reputation outside them, The first part of this essay is simply an attempt to compose a coherent narrative around the use of live models in an academic context, and how they came into public prominence in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The second part, based primarily on contemporary readings in the popular press,' deals more specifically with what kind of prominence they came into-what values the figure of the professional model came to represent, or challenge-and what role they played in the formation of distinctly American conception of professionalism in the fine arts.\n\nThis course presents an array of flashpoints in the history of the art and thought of artists working in the United States as they shaped notions of artistic purpose, power, and identity from 1889 to 1989. Along the way we will consider a wide range of artistic and visual media, including painting, sculpture, dance, photography, film, video, and the graphic arts. Always we will explore the ever adaptive and catalytic work of art and artists as they engaged with, responded to, and worked to revise the wider political and social conditions of their contemporary moment. Learning Objectives • Entry into the history, art, media, and culture of the United States in the twentieth-century, including attending considerations of identity, nation, race, class, gender, and sexuality. • Cultivation of visual literacy; interdisciplinary engagement with recent and past approaches to modern and contemporary art history and visual culture. • Development of skills in critical and constructive reading and thinking; respectful interpersonal dialogue; and oral and written communication."
