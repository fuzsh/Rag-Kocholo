        "text": "In building a case for grounding art education curricula in complexity theory as one approach to more meaningful art making, this paper is presented as a freestanding literature review. This review is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive, but is representative of the literature researched. The main purpose of this paper is to provide new perspectives on complexity theory in education, specifically in art education. In the paper, we discuss complexity theory and how it emerged as a theory for understanding soft sciences. Then we explicate the characteristics of self-organization, bottom-up emergence, decentralized network, short-range relationships, nested organization, and being recursive, non-linear, structurally determined, and far-from-equilibrium, which we posit as most conducive to improved curriculum construction. As a means of situating our paper, we end by illustrating how complexity theory has been addressed sparingly in art education to date.\n\nThe arts in education can do more to develop dispositions for success and socially responsible action in our future artists, innovators, and leaders of tomorrow. In order to be a highly effective teacher-leader of art and design, it is proposed that the development of creativity and innovation must be balanced with analytical thinking and practical wisdom. Twenty-first century learning demands that teachers become designers of classroom environments and curricula that enable students to develop their full capacities as human beings, while tapping into a balance of their creative, analytical and practical entrepreneurial skills and mindsets. Artist-teacher-leaders must also capitalize on students’ abilities for connection making, inquiry, and self-direction to foster their future social-emotional strengths and dispositions. When more focused on the development of students’ creative process skills and responsibility, art and design education may be better positioned to foster empathic, interdisciplinary 21st-century skills and habits of mind success. In this aim, the marriage of design thinking strategies and learner-centered pedagogies serve as catalysts of change in the visual arts. This paper reports on research and theoretical frameworks of successful intelligence and balanced intelligence that support innovative and currently implemented programming in a U.S. undergraduate and graduate teacher training program.\n\nThis white paper reconceptualizes the potential of models of arts practice in generating new curriculum approaches for general education and aiding the development of the learner in our contemporary visual age. High-quality art education is argued to provide art educators with an adaptable and dynamic framework for curriculum-making and theorizing. Visual arts theoretical models—or art for scholarship’s sake—offer the promise of divergent and yet synergistic pedagogical pathways through which learners may become adept at thinking empirically through a material medium, thinking expressively in a language, thinking iconoclastically within a context—or in doing each simultaneously. Flexible and dynamic thinking is a key to jump-starting the ability of learners to innovate, inform, and network across the artificial divides of disciplinary content.
