        "text": "PBSA Membership\n\nThe Professional Background Screening Association (PBSA) exists to advance excellence in the screening profession. As a member, Viewpoint Screening abides by FCRA regulatory compliance, meets best practices standards and adhere to various laws as they pertain to the highly regulated background screening industry. The PBSA provides Viewpoint Screening with news alerts and ensures that we stay compliant with all PBSA background screening related laws and regulations.\n\nFCRA Compliance\n\nAs a consumer reporting agency, Viewpoint Screening is federally mandated to abide by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) rules and regulations. We are fully committed to complying with all local, state, and federal laws governing the acquisition and disclosure of personal data.\n\nThe FCRA is designed primarily to protect the privacy of the consumer report information and to guarantee that the information supplied by consumer reporting agencies is as accurate as possible. This includes ensuring that (A) the individuals are aware that a consumer report may be used for employment purposes and agree to such use, and (B) that the individuals are notified promptly if information in a consumer report may result in a negative employment decision.\n\nViewpoint Screening goes above and beyond to ensure all FCRA rules and regulations are followed internally and by the organizations that we have partnered with.\n\nHIPAA Compliance\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is enforced by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services. Only entities meeting the definition of “covered entity” must comply with HIPAA.\n\nStudent screening companies, such as Viewpoint Screening, are not considered covered entities and do not meet the definition of health care clearinghouse contained in the HIPAA regulations at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103. However, Viewpoint Screening does meet all guidelines set forth by HIPAA, and follows federal court decisions enforced by the Department of Health and Human Services to discover any changes that may affect your organization.\n\nPlease be aware that the the US Department of Health and Human Services does not endorse any type of HIPAA certification because HIPAA compliance is an on-going progress.\n\nFERPA Compliance\n\nAs per the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO), immunization records are considered education records and therefore fall under FERPA regulations.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law enacted in 1974 that protects the privacy of student education records. FERPA applies to any public or private elementary, secondary, or post-secondary school and any state or local education agency that receives funds under an applicable program of the US Department of Education.\n\nViewpoint Screening assures all actions are within the guidelines of FERPA, and any partnering organization must agree to the same guidance."
