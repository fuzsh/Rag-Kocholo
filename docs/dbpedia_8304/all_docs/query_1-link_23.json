The building, completed in 1908 with 30 units and 16 stories, was designed by Charles Buckham and Isodore Konti. The facade and interior were ornate with Ionic columns, white terra cotta, friezes with classical themes, multi-colored tiles and a middle niche with the bust of painter Thomas Gainsborough. Franzen, who had special admiration for this artist, is credited with the name. In 1988, the building, after extensive renovation, was given New York City Landmark designation. Originally artists including Cooper, Daingerfield and Franzen were the primary occupants but gradually it became a mix of owners.

But in 1907, Stieglitz broadened the scope to include avant-garde painting, sculpture and graphic arts with the hope of showing that photography could hold its own on an equal level with the other visual arts. Gallery 291 then became the center of contemporary, leading-edge American and European art in America with the first American exhibitions of work by Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse, and Paul Cezanne, Pablo Picasso and Constantin Brancusi. From 1909, American modernists were featured including Marsden Hartley, Alfred Maurer, John Marin, Arthur Carles, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Max Weber, Elie Nadelman, Arthur Dove, and Georgia O'Keeffe, whom Steiglitz married and promoted her career. From 1903 to 1917, \"Camera Work\" was the Gallery's official publication. Gallery 291 closed in 1917 when the building was torn down. Successor galleries opened by Steiglitz were Anderson Galleries from 1925 to 1929, and An American Place from 1920 to 1946.

Their work has been described as \"more often associated with the inventiveness and power of the leading 20th-century abstract painters than it is with textile making.\" The quilting tradition in Gee's Bend goes back to the time when that area was a plantation owned by Joseph Gee. Female slaves pieced together strips of cloth to make bedcovers for the time when they lived in unheated shacks, but along the way \"they developed a distinctive style, noted for its lively improvisations and geometric simplicity.\" By the 21st century, more than 50 women are part of the Collective with every quilt being unique and individually produced.

Each man took a new name to use as an artist, and these names are respectively Jorge Zontal, Felix Partz and AA Bronson. Working as a trio to be freed \"from the tyranny of individual genius\", they functioned artistically as a single entity called Miss General Idea. Their intent was to make fun of contemporary art, media promoting it, and museum exhibitions. Their mediums were installation sculpture, films, performances, photographs and publications including their own magazine called \"File\". In the 1980s, AIDS was a major focus of their efforts, and Miss General Idea created and distributed mass-produced (multiples) posters, billboards, stamps, lottery tickets and other electronic images. They also did cynical commentary works about pharmaceutical companies' research methods for AIDS medications. Spreading their messages, the creating of Multiples was a key component, and in 1974, Miss General Idea established a multiples distribution center called Art Metropole. Included in their multiples were humorous and sardonic references to modern art. They also kept a regular exhibition schedule. After Zontal and Partz died of AIDS, Bronson felt as though he had lost his own identify and produced many works dealing with death, survival and moving on in order to rebuild himself with a new self image. In 2003, the Galerie Frederic Giroux in Paris hosted an exhibition of his work, \"AA Bronson Healer\". In January 2003, a traveling exhibition titled \"General Idea: Editions, 1967-1996\" was organized by Barbara Fischer for the Blackwood Gallery of the University of Toronto at Mississauga.

Genesee Group of Painters, Geneseeans This group of representational painters were active in the Genesee River Valley near Rochester, New York, in the early 20th Century. Dedicated to resisting European modernism, which increasingly was influencing American painters, they sought through plein-air painting to capture the Spirit of Place through their regional landscapes. Among other early members were Milton Holm, Enoch Stoddard, George Mumford and Carl Peters. Source: R.H. Love Galleries, courtesy, Michael Worley, Ph.D. Genre A subject for many artists, it is depiction of people going about human interactive activities such as domestic chores, moving into frontiers, fighting or socializing. Genre paintings are often narrative, and because they eschew 'lofty' subjects such as religious symbolism and mythology, it was not until the 17th century that they gained respect as 'high art'. Dutch 17th-century artists Jan Steen, Jan Vermeer, and Pieter de Hooch first used genre as subject matter. In American painting, the word genre was first used in the mid-19th century to describe works that showed daily life. Among noted American genre artists are William Sidney Mount, Thomas Waterman Wood, Seymour Joseph Guy, Edward Lamson Henry, John Joseph Brown and Enoch Wood Perry.

In contrast to Abstract Expressionist painting, Geometric Abstract shape colors are distinct, not blended, and often are delineated by bold colors. Pioneering Geometric Abstract painters were the Russian, Kasimir Malelvich (1878-1935), and Dutchman, Piet Mondrian (1872-1944).

Gesso A ground made of gypsum (gesso in Italian) or chalk mixed with water or glue to provide a dense, brilliantly white absorbent surface for tempera and some types of oil painting, it is usually applied to a panel in several coats before painting begins. The first application, a coarse undercoat, is called \"gesso grosso\"; the final application is a fine surface coat known as \"gesso sottile\". However, modern painters usually do only one coat because pre-smoothed panels can be purchased. When applied to flat panels, frames, or furniture, the gesso is usually sanded until very smooth and ivory-like. It is never used with canvas as it would be too brittle.

The theory was first put forth in the 1930s in Germany and England.

It was a time when America changed from an agricultural to industrial based society, which meant the growth of a middle class and big fortunes for some industrial tycoon families such as Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Astors, Carnegies and Forbes. Painters and sculptors reflected this era through idealized and expansionist themed genre, portraits, monumental statues and industrial scenes. Examples are works by Thomas Eakins, Eastman Johnson, Winslow Homer, Augustus St. Gaudens, Daniel Chester French, John Ferguson Weir and Albert Pinkham Ryder.

Gilded, Gilding, Gilting Referencing surfaces covered with gold or metal leaf, the process creates the appearance of solid or inlaid gold or metal. The word \"Gilding\" is derived from the word Gold, but the term in recent times has come to reference metals as well as gold. The gilded leaf is used in painting and sculpture and often for decorative affects. Gilding can be applied either to a tacky base that has been sized with glue, gesso or thick oil varnish and then burnished, or it can be glued to any un-sized surface but then cannot be burnished. The method of Gilding dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Chinese, to Old Testament Biblical figures and Ancient Greeks. In the Middle Ages, Gilding was used for manuscript illumination, lettering and for backgrounds of paintings. It reached its most popular time in Europe and America during the Victorian Era of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries when ornate decoration was very popular.

In order to pick up the metal leaf, the Gilder runs the brush through his own hair to make the tip slightly oily so that the leaf will attach. A Gilder's Tip is usually necessary only with fragile gold leaf because other metals are heavy enough not to need the Tip. Source: Ralph Mayer, \"A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques\" Gilder's Wax A combination of beeswax with verdigris or some other acidic substance, it is used to accent the color of gold and provide a warm tone to the surface when gold leaf has been applied to another metal. The applied Wax is then burned off, and the gilded surface is cleaned with acid.

Origins of the Giverny art colony date to 1887, when a small band of artists, including Americans Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Wendel and John Leslie Breck \"discovered\" the village. Claude Monet, by then known to the American artists through both Parisian and American exhibitions, had settled there in 1883. He was receptive at first to having \"disciples\" learn from him, but soon tired of the invasion. The first group of artists painted primarily landscapes, and the second group focused on depicting family life, especially the female figure in the intimacy of the artist's own garden or private interior setting. World War I (1914) marked the end of an era for the art colony, but the place with its Monet gardens remains a tourist attraction.

Their subjects were Scottish, such as rather conventional scenes of the countryside or wildlife in marshes, etc. The Glascow School was England's late 19th-century contribution to western art, but the movement peaked after their exhibition in 1890 at the Grosvenor Gallery in London.

Gold Leaf, which is literally gold beaten into flat leaves, can be put on board or paper. Because gold is inert, it does not tarnish, so it retains its ability to lend elegance to works of art. A person correctly applying Gold Leaf first puts down sizing, lets it dry until sticky, and then attaches it to the sized surface by using a small brush and a leaf lifter, which is a small piece of clear plastic activated by rubbing it on one's arm to charge it with static electricity. Then the the leaf-lifter is used to pick up the delicate sheets of gold, usually in three-inch squares between tissue paper, and places them on the sized surface. The next step is burnishing, which is rubbing the leaf so that it adheres. Standard Gold Leaf is 23.5 carats, with about 2000 leaves weighing one ounce. However, variations are available such as lemon gold (18.5 carats) and pale gold (16 carats). Gold Leaf can enhance a work by suggesting grandeur or wealth or divinity as expressed in the artwork of Judeo-Christian religion. It has been used throughout western history on sculpture, church domes, picture frames, decorations, manuscript illuminations, and religious paintings suggesting haloes, etc. Sources: Anne Heywood, 'All That Glitters is Gold', \"The Pastel Journal\", December 2005, pp. 23; Ralph Mayer, \"A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques\".

It is a division of sections whereby the smaller one is the same proportion to the larger as the larger is to the whole work, a ratio of of approximately 5 to 8: A(the whole) is to B (the larger section) as B is to C (the smaller section). The name Golden Section was first used in the nineteenth century, but the proportion itself dates back to the work of the Greek mathematician, Euclid. In the early fifteenth century the Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli, wrote a book on the subject called \"Divina Proportione\", which was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci and used in his \"Last Supper\" composition. This influential work led to the widespread use of the Golden Section by many Renaissance and later artists and architects.

Gongbi A precise, realist Chinese painting method of painting, it requires drawing with fine lines to represent exact likenesses and then washing and adding of ink and color, layer by layer. It is the opposite of spontaneous, sketchy or expressive. The name is derived from the Chinese word \"gong chin\", which means tidy or meticulous in English. The method dates back about 2000 years to the Han Dynasty, a period of political stability and respect for tradition. Gongbi peaked between the 7th and 13th centuries, when wealthy people took special interest in supporting its artists, who needed financial guarantee because they had to give total commitment to the process. Some 20/21st century Chinese artists practice the method including Pang Zouyu.

This art form has been around for many years. It was widely used for sacral paintings since the Middle Ages. The most famous was the art of icons in the Byzantine Empire. Later the painting on glass spread to Italy, where in Venice it influenced its Renaissance art.

Submitted to askART by M.D. Silverbrooke, West Vancouver, British Columbia Graffiti Art / Street Art Graffiti, an Italian word for 'scratches', refers to an art form most popular during the 1970s and 1980s, but still alive today. Graffiti Art results from artists who create images, usually with paint, in a manner that appears to be sloppy, undisciplined, and defiant-seeming image making by street kids on the surfaces of city structures. The formal practice of graffiti goes back to the Egyptians, but was not thought of as an art form until the 1970s when artists began imitating the 'scratchings' of street teens in the New York subway stations. Some artists such as Crash, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat were acknowledged as Graffiti artists by the art world, but interest faded when Graffiti Art arrived on canvases into the galleries of New York. In the 21st century, artists such as Shepard Fairey, Barry McGee and Swoon continue the tradition.

The Galleries began as an entity of non-profit cooperatives for artists, where they could exhibit their work and also store it for ongoing exhibitions. Businessmen provided the capital; artists paid their dues with artwork; and later traveling exhibitions were organized by members. However special recognition came in 1934, when art dealer Edith Halpert staged a show there called \"33 Moderns\", described in \"Time\" magazine as \"the biggest event in the campaign to modernize U.S. art since the Armory Show of 1913.\" Artist members included Lamar Dodd, Burt Procter, Henry Hensche, Frederick Frieseke, James Earle Fraser, John Singer Sargent and Guy Wiggins.

Sargent and Daniel Chester French served as first Directors in the facility, which was a 7,000 square foot space on the 7th Floor of the east wing of the Grand Central Terminal. The first year enrollment was about 400 students, and the school expanded rapidly, becoming one of the largest art schools in the city. Among the teachers were Harvey Dunn, Dean Cornwell, Nicolai Fechin and Arshile Gorky, and students included Ken Riley, Gerald Delano, Charles Addams and Norman Rockwell. The school, which held summer sessions in Eastport, Maine, closed in 1944. Despite similarities in name, the Grand Central School of Art had no relationship to the Grand Central Academy of Art.

The colony was named Eagle’s Nest Association for the ancient gnarled cedar tree which stood for many years on the bluff. The Oregon public library, designed by two of the architects from the colony, houses a collection of art done by various Eagle’s Nest members. Grand Detour artist colony developed as an offshoot of the Eagle’s Nest artist camp when member and landscape painter Charles Francis Browne began bringing students to Grand Detour where they spent several weeks each summer painting and sketching in the village and along the Rock River. Grand Detour was a quiet, peaceful and picturesque village at this time. There were two hotels, the Sheffield and the Colonial Inn, which provided room and board at a reasonable cost. Vacant houses were used for storing art supplies and paintings. Most of the artists in the Grand Detour art group were summer residents, but after the Sheffield Hotel burned down in 1928, several built homes on the west side of the village along the Rock River. Six artists were most prominent in this group, with John Nolf as their unofficial leader. A short distance from Nolf’s house was that of Holger Jensen, a year-round resident. Oscar Soellner built a small cottage and spent summers here with his family. Water color painter Fred Garner lived in the stately old house built in the early days of Grand Detour by Willard House. Garner was most active in the day-to-day life of the village. Mattie Lietz stayed at the Colonial Inn. Dixon native Agnes Ferguson built her house on a bluff with an imposing view of the river and was the last member of the art group when she died in 1985. Beside painting and holding exhibitions, most of these artists supplemented their income by conducting art classes and some of the later local artists took lessons from members of the Grand Detour art group. Among these were Eunice Schuler, Hazel Howell and Charles Kested. The heyday of the Grand Detour art group was the 1920s through the 1940s. By the mid-1950s a majority of the artists had died, but their paintings, especially of local scenes, can be found in many area homes and the Loveland Community House in Dixon. Written by Duane Paulsen, historian of the Grand Detour Art Colony. Grand Manner An aesthetic of idealism first applied to history painting and then portraiture, its proponents avoided realism and used visual metaphors to suggest noble qualities. In the 18th century, it was especially prevalent in Britain where Sir Joshua Reynolds promoted the method in Royal Academy lectures. Other Grand Manner proponents were Peter Paul Rubens, Thomas Gainsborough and Anthony Van Dyck.

Its founding dates to 1947 when Birney Quick (1912-1981) took students to Artist' Point for plein-air painting classes, which were often followed by an evening fish fry. Today participants are housed and offered studio space and classes in the village of Grand Marais. Until 1958, the Colony was administered by the Minneapolis School of Art, but that entity's supervision has been replaced by an Art Colony Board of Director. An annual juried plein-air painting exhibition and sale is held with many family events.

Processes include aquatint, drypoint, etching, line engraving, lithography, mezzotint, monotype, serigraphy, stipple engraving, woodcuts, wood engravings, and mixed media where several of these methods are combined. \"A trend of the late 1960s is to shorten the term graphic arts to graphics, which refers not only to the techniques but also to the individual prints.\" Sources: Julia M.

Like charcoal and having no relationship to lead, graphite is a higher form of coal and is closely related to diamonds. \"It is metallic in appearance, and almost glassy, which accounts for its sheen when applied in concentration.\" Today graphite is easily obtainable, but it used to be a rare commodity. The Borrower's Mine in the Lake District in England became the chief early source of graphite. Dating from the 1600s, this graphite was first used only by local herdsmen to mark their sheep, but the demand became worldwide with the discovery that graphite could be put in a stylus and then make a consistent dark line. In the art market, graphite drawings tend not to bring high-dollar prices, but some artists such as Chuck Close are exceptions.

It was representative of art under National Socialism.The “Great German Art Exhibition”, which extended over the ground floor, the upper floor and the two-story “Hall of Honor” in the middle of the building, was promoted as the most important cultural event in National Socialist Germany. The show was conceived as a sales exhibition, artists could be represented with several works (usually up to ten works), whereby sometimes also works that were not for sale, e.g. B. Loans, were issued. During the exhibition, a selected artist was given the opportunity to present himself more comprehensively in a “special show”. While the organizational and technical part of the exhibition preparation was incumbent on the \"House of German Art (New Glass Palace)\" as an institution under public law , the overall artistic management was held by a \"Commissioner of the President of the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts \" appointed by Adolf Hitler. The duration of the exhibition was fixed in advance until 1940; the later exhibitions were announced \"until further notice\". The exhibitions were open daily - including Sundays and public holidays - from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Works sold during the exhibition could be replaced by other works “that were found to be good when the works were examined”. Only the “House of German Art” acted as contractual partner for the sale. Photographing and copying of exhibited works was initially not permitted during the exhibition hours. From 1943, however, this was possible for press purposes with the prior consent of the exhibition management The “Great German Art Exhibition” was officially opened on July 18, 1937 together with the “House of German Art” building. In the opening speech, Hitler gave an extensive presentation of the National Socialist understanding of \"German art\", which in future will be the only one that will be publicly admitted. According to Stefan Schweizer, Hitler outlined a basic, ethnic and racist guiding structure of historical and art-historical ideas and interpretations. With his idea that art was a direct expression of the defining circumstances of the time, he identified the art of the Weimar Republicwith the political system of that time. By contrast, he saw the art he valued as legitimized by politics and at the same time legitimizing as politics. He defined the new German art stylistically and ideologically with the words: “'To be German means to be clear.' But that would mean that to be German means to be logical and, above all, to be true. \" In contrast to this, Hitler defamed \"modern art\" that was \"degenerate\" and announced the end of that kind of art. However, there was little international interest.

Historically the method of Grisaille has been used by artists in several ways: 1) Preliminary sketch where tonal values are worked out before using color. 2) As under painting for an actual work of art, something that was used extensively by the Old Masters. 3) A teaching method whereby educators illustrate line and shape or composition with Grisaille before letting the students proceed to using color. 4) Depicting objects intended to represent the color gray for actual gray objects such as marble statues or temple columns depicted often in Renaissance paintings.

Group of Seven / G7 An association of artists questing for a distinctinve Canadian style, it was a movement that shaped the vision of how Canadians saw their own country and that left a legacy that continues to provoke debate and discussion. The Group began to form in 1913 when Lawren Harris convinced A.Y. Jackson to move to Toronto from Montreal. In that same year, Lawren Stewart Harris and J.E.H. MacDonald visited the Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York to view an exhibition of Scandinavian paintings. That show was a flashpoint for the creation of the Group. In 1920, seven artists – Lawren Harris, J.E.H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston, Franklin Carmichael and A.Y. Jackson – decided, for the first time, to exhibit as the Group of Seven. The formal founding of the Group was its first exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of Toronto in May 1920. Tom Thomson would not live to see the birth of the Group of Seven. Yet, despite his untimely death in 1917, Thomson’s name became synonymous with the Group. His sketches and finished canvases created a painting style truly representative of the Canadian landscape and experience. Despite its name, the Group of Seven membership eventually grew to include ten artists. Frank Johnston only exhibited in one of the 1920 exhibitions before resigning from the Group. Following this, A.J. Casson joined the Group in 1926. In an effort to widen the geographical base beyond Toronto, Edwin Holgate of Montreal was asked to join in 1930. L.L. FitzGerald (of Winnipeg) joined the Group in 1932. From its birth in 1920 to the early 1930s, the Group was immensely influential. The final Group of Seven exhibition was held in 1931.
