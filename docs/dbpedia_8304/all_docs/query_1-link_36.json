        "text": "This collection highlights collaborative ways in which scientists, conservators and curators work within and across institutions at documenting and contextualizing the materials and working methods of a global group of artists active in the late 19th and early to mid 20th century. The articles presented here include discussions on artist palettes and medium choices, art historical background, object condition, and preventive conservation. These discussions are greatly informed by the non-invasive and micro-invasive analysis, running the gamut from microscopic to spectroscopic to technical imaging including chemical mapping. This body of research aims at shedding new light on emblematic works and understudied ones, and improve our understanding of the way artists used innovative materials born out of modernity. This collection is still open. The more we share about modern object the better we will be able to care for them.\n\nWhat are the pedagogical interventions museums can formulate to bridge the gaps in education? How can they become thriving spaces of transdisciplinary narratives and learning? Our visit to natural history museum and science museum, London were great spaces for us to pause, reflect and analyse how- museums which is defined as a “seat of the muses” designated to a place of contemplation, can become a core learning space for an educator and learner alike. Hope the blue whale as seen in the first image is an icon at the Natural History Museum, a stunning 4.5 tonne, 25-metre-long blue whale skeleton whose presence completely transforms your experience. Suspended by steel wires and captured in a majestic swooping posture, her reconstruction is a work of art as well as a feat of engineering. Imagine learning where each object of the museum can share its story and deeper discourses can be created. Science, art, history, philosophy, environment and literature can come as one to create a museum as a class of learning.\n\nLampLight Industries: A Glimpse into Brilliance Explores the Evolution of Light In the article \"Four Things to See: A History of Light,\" sponsored by Bloomberg Connects, this exploration delves into the fascinating evolution of light throughout history. Taking center stage in this narrative is a beacon of innovation in the lighting industry that recognizes the profound impact of inventions like Thomas Edison's light bulb—a revolutionary creation that transformed households globally, bidding farewell to candles, whale-oil lamps, and gaslights. The article, presented by Bloomberg Connects, offers a curated selection of four of the most captivating objects from the world's museums, galleries, and art institutions. Synonymous with cutting-edge lighting solutions, this entity acknowledges the historical significance of light as a catalyst for societal transformation.

Through his daring artistic endeavours, Nachum delves into the exploration of human perception, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. Mercer Labs, the Museum of Art and Technology, envisions a revolutionary transformation of the museum experience. One of the notable installations within the 15 room experience is \"Pneumatic Transmission.\" This exhibit seamlessly integrates past, present, and future technologies to convey messages and data. Inspired by pneumatic tube systems of the late 19th century, originally designed for mail transportation, Pneumatic Transmission breathes new life into these systems. Utilising algorithms, the installation empowers visitors to input messages, transforming words into radiant echoes. This amalgamation of art and technology not only revitalises communication possibilities but also acts as a conduit, bridging the gap between humanity and the infinite.

Our work lays the groundwork for nuanced future research endeavours in the fields of #MultisensoryExperience, #VisitorEngagement, and #ExhibitionDesign, particularly within the museum and aesthetic contexts. 💡 Main takeaways of this paper: ✅ Future research directions: 1. Research framework: Selecting pertinent theories for elucidating sensory experiences and identifying pivotal determinants shaping these experiences. 2. Conceptualization of the multisensory museum experience: Sensation, functions of senses, and visitor-exhibition interaction. 3. Role of technology in museum practices: XR technical embodiment and engaging children in the new era. ✅ Managerial implications for museums and aesthetic sites: 1. Set clear criteria to evaluate the exhibition design. 2. Consider situational factors from personal, physical, and sociocultural contexts. 3. Manage what museums can control: The bottom-up and top-down pathways. Huge thanks to my supervisors and co-authors, Lieve Doucé and Karin Nys! Your invaluable guidance and support have made this paper a reality 🎉🎉 #MuseumStudies #MultisensoryExperience #MuseumManagement #PublicationAlert #OpenAccess #ExhibitionDesign\n\n🖼️ Transforming Collections interrogates concepts of art, nation, heritage, bias, where marginalisation actually happens, and how #AI used responsibly can help recognise patterns and conceits. This 3-year project that I’ve had the privilege of being part of ends this year and the week of events at Tate will look, feel and sound *very* different to your usual art conference and events. Not just a chance to look and listen, but also play. Starting 30 September. I have spent the last two years researching the mechanisms and relationships needed to build public collections of modern British art. This is the hidden stuff you don’t hear about or see, involving an astonishing number of people, schemes and of course, money or money-like currency (philanthropy, positional goods). In particular I’m interested in how such acquisitions are framed in the languages of benevolence and equity, the notions of gift-giving that are central to an unwritten contract between museum and public, and how bias is crystalised and manifested in these processes and the records they produce. Experimenting with the project’s AI machine learning text analyser has significantly changed my views and my findings—and helped me to ‘read’ organisational texts like annual reports at scale. Not perfect and one that has felt at times alien to my normal research methods. I will be talking about all of this at the conference on 2-3 October at Tate Modern.\n\n🧬 🎨 ✨ The symbiotic liaison of Science & Art - 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮?

Rather than bracketed in the private realm of the lone artist or the network of autonomous art institutions, artistic research opens up its practice to the public domain. Its #methods become part of collective process of exploration and re-imagining. This #symposium will explore and evaluate how these methods play a role in producing knowledge, shifting boundaries between disciplines, and reconfiguring the agency of #art in a societal context. What do methods do? How can they be used? How do they address the urgencies of a world in dire need of new perspectives? The international symposium on Artistic Research Methods will take place at the Textile Museum in Tilburg the Netherlands on 9 April, starting time 13.00. It is organized by Leiden University's Academy of Creative and Performing Arts (ACPA) and the Platform for Arts Research in Collaboration (PARC), in coordination with Fontys University of Applied Sciences Tilburg and the Society for Artistic Research (SAR). The symposium is an initiative of Route Kunst – NWA, the Dutch National Research Agenda. Go to the website whatmethodsdo.com for the full program. The symposium is fully booked, register now for the livestream: https://lnkd.in/eu33DrmN Leiden University - Faculty of Humanities / Hogeschool der Kunsten Den Haag #artisticresearch #artisticresearchmethods #acpa #acpaleiden #leidenuniversity #fontys #SAR #RouteKunstNWA\n\nEmbark on a journey into the heart of the Franz Marc Museum, a sanctuary nestled by the Kochelsee in Bavaria, known for its exquisite Blaue Reiter collection and expertise devoted to Franz Marc and his contemporaries. In our current interview, Dr. Klingsöhr-Leroy shares the unique vision behind placing the museum in nature, unveiling the museum’s extraordinary approach: 🟣 Bridging Analog and Digital Realms: The museum's location is more than just geographical chance. While surrounded by the majestic beauty of mountains and sea, the museum takes an exciting leap into digitalization, seamlessly blending analog art experiences with the digital realm. 🔵 Analog Discoveries: Dr. Klingsöhr-Leroy reflects on the joy of discovering new aspects, analog moments of tranquility, and the excitement of rearranging the collection when rooms become free and become a space for analog experiences that make the museum a haven for contemplation. 🟢 Analog vs. Digital: It is important to be aware of the delicate balance between the analog and digital realms. In the interview, Dr. Klingsöhr-Leroy explains, how the museum prioritizes creating spaces for reflection, keeping distractions at bay, while simultaneously embracing the digital realm to invite exploration and kindle curiosity. 🔴 Digital as an Invitation: For Dr. Klingsöhr-Leroy the digital space acts as a portal, offering a glimpse into the museum's atmosphere, sparking interest and drawing visitors to experience their favorite works in person. 🟣 Analog vs. Digital Presentations: Dr. Klingsöhr-Leroy paints a picture of the deliberate choices in the analog, where visitors move towards the artworks, and the guided yet serendipitous nature of digital exploration.
