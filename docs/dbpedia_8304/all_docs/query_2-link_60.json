These aesthetic-painterly compositions are equally linked to Artist cinema and always present the results of actions, performances and installations carried out by the artists, which take place in the rural/urban space or in the studio/exhibition space. The duality of nature and culture and aspects like time, space and the localisation of the individual in the “big picture” all create the broad contextual framework. Equally Lamson refers to the now “classical” Concept Art and Land Art of the 1960s/1970s.\n\nBiography\n\nborn 1977\n\nlives and works in Brooklyn, NY"
