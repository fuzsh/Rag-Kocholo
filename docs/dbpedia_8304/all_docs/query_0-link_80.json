        "text": "Annotated Catalogue of\n\nthe Papers of Charles S. Peirce\n\nWe are making the famous “Robin Catalogue” (Amherst, MA: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1967) available through the kindness of Prof. Richard Shale Robin (1926-2010), who gifted the copyright to the Peirce Edition Project.\n\nThis electronic edition of the Robin Catalogue (accessible through the menu at right) was prepared by Prof. Dr. Michael Otte from the Institut fÃ¼r Didaktik der Mathematik at UniversitÃ¤t Bielefeld in Germany. We are grateful to Prof. Dr. Otte and Dr. Michael Hoffmann for providing the computer base file.\n\nPeirce Project practice is to refer to the manuscripts in the Catalogue with the letter R followed by the manuscript number, instead of the letters MS. The letter R (for Robin) is useful in that it clarifies at once that a manuscript so referred to is one that is described in his Catalogue, and thus located in the Houghton Library, and not a Peirce manuscript either belonging to another collection or reconstituted or repaginated by the Peirce Project.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the composition dates given in the catalog are those determined by Richard S. Robin and his associates in the early to mid 1960s. The Houghton Library provides access to Christian Kloesel’s annotated copy of that catalogue, which contains corrections to the dates and indications of manuscript reconstructions for the most part taken from Max H. Fisch’s personal copy (the Harvard Library’s online finding aid for the Charles S. Peirce papers is accessible here; here is a downloadable PDF of it). More progress has been made since then in the chronological dating of the manuscripts. Catalogue users should contact the Peirce Project to inquire about the latest dating of problematic documents. Something else worth remembering is that the descriptive blurbs in the Catalogue are often incomplete and tend not to describe manuscript content published in the Collected Papers.\n\nEssential to remember is that Richard S. Robin published a supplementary catalogue in 1971. Titled “The Peirce Papers: A Supplementary Catalogue,” it was published in Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society 7.1 (winter 1971): 37-57. It can be downloaded from JSTOR. It consists of three parts.\n\nPart I comprises the large number of pages (94 entries) missing from manuscripts that had already been catalogued and microfilmed; those sheets are referred to by the number of the manuscript they belong to followed by the parenthetical letter (s).\n\nPart II lists 104 new manuscripts numbered S1 to S104.\n\nPart III lists ten correspondence folders referred to by L and a number followed by \"(s)\" to which sheets were added, and two new correspondence folders L319a and L714a (the latter containing six letters under the heading “Hardenbergh Collection (Henry Peirce)”).\n\nThe version of the Robin Catalogue that was accessible on the Peirce Project’s old website is available from this clickable link.\n\nPage from Max H. Fisch’s copy of the Catalogue\n\nPreface\n\nThis is a catalogue of and guide to the Charles S. Peirce Papers which are presently housed in the Houghton Library, the rare book and manuscript library at Harvard University. The papers were for the most part received by the Harvard Philosophy Department from Peirce’s widow in the winter of 1914-15, less than a year after his death. These are the papers which have been worked on over the years by several scholars, initially by Josiah Royce, who unfortunately died before much progress was made, more recently by Charles Hartshorne, Paul Weiss, and Arthur Burks, as editors of the Collected Papers,* and most recently by Max H. Fisch, in connection with the preparation of an intellectual biography of Peirce.\n\nThe papers have been divided into two parts. Part One consists principally of manuscripts; Part Two, of correspondence. The manuscripts range over the whole of Peirce’s intellectual life and include as anyone familiar with Peirce might expect manuscripts on logic, mathematics, metaphysics, and pragmatism. Also included are Peirce’s scientific manuscripts, his manuscripts in the history of science and in linguistics, his reviews and translations, and various other manuscripts, many of biographical interest. In addition to the manuscripts, there is a considerable body of correspondence which ranges over much of Peirce’s private and professional life. Placed with this correspondence, but organized separately, is the correspondence of Peirce’s second wife Juliette, the correspondence among various members of Peirce’s family, and some miscellaneous correspondence.\n\nIn the fall of 1960 when I began my work on the Catalogue, Peirce’s papers had been assembled for the convenience of those who, like myself, were engaged in one or another of several Peirce projects. Although the papers were all in one place, there were, in fast, three separate sets of Peirce materials, all organized, with a catalogue for one and a catalogue of sorts for another, but none for the third. The bulk of the Peirce Collection at Harvard, consisting of sixty-one boxes and bundles, had been maintained in the Archives of Widener Library The \"Archives\" material had been organized, boxed, and catalogued in 1941 by Knight W. McMahan. McMahan's ninety-nine page typewritten \"Catalogue of the C. S. Peirce Manuscripts,\" with its description of what the boxes contained,\n\n* Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Vols. I-VIII, Harvard University Press, 1931-1958.\n\nserved well the needs of Peirce scholars who sought to examine the contents of those boxes and, although incomplete, it came as close as was possible at that time to putting Peirce’s papers into some kind of final order. Later John F. Boler contributed an eleven-page addition which dealt more effectively than McMahan's catalogue had with Peirce’s book reviews.\n\nAnother distinguishable part of the Peirce Collection, also sizable but of less importance than the material located in the Archives, had been maintained in Houghton Library. The \"Houghton\" material consisted of some nineteen boxes which had neither been classified nor catalogued until a preliminary arrangement and listing of this material was effected in 1960 by John Boler in his \"Interim Catalogue,\" a typescript of thirteen pages.\n\nThe third distinguishable part of the Peirce Collection the correspondence had been kept mostly with the \"Archives\" material and had been partially organized by McMahan at the time he was working on his catalogue. But since then, in 1960 to be specific, the collection of family correspondence, formerly in the Benjamin Peirce Papers in the Archives had been transferred to the Charles Peirce Collection by authorization of Charles Peirce’s niece, Miss Helen Ellis. Subsequently, more family correspondence found its way into the Collection, again, by authorization of Miss Helen Ellis. By this time, the whole of the correspondence had been completely reorganized.\n\nIn addition to the Peirce material noted above, there were miscellaneous manuscripts that had been listed separately in the catalogues of Widener and Houghton; various collections of articles on or by Peirce, some of the articles being annotated; annotated books from Peirce’s library; public documents and photographs; and much unedited, scraplike material, to mention only some of the items which needed to be integrated with the rest. The present catalogue is the attempt to gather several collections and miscellaneous items into one collection. Unquestionably, the fact that so much of the Peirce manuscripts and correspondence had already been ordered or partially ordered, greatly facilitated my own efforts at integration. Clearly, if it were not for the fast that the cataloguing of the Peirce Papers had a history, this catalogue could not have been produced, most certainly not in the time it took to produce it.\n\nHaving noted the history of the cataloguing of the Peirce Papers, I would be remiss if I did not mention the contributions of W. F. Kernan and V. F. Lenzen.* Kernan's \"List of C. S. Peirce Manuscripts,\" a nine-page\n\n* For interesting accounts of the early history of the Peirce Papers, see V. Lenzen's \"Reminiscences of a Mission to Milford, Pennsylvania,\" Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, I, X (Spring 1965) pp. 3-11 and W. F. Kernan's \"The Peirce Manuscripts and Josiah Royce A Memoir Harvard 1915-1916,\" Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, I, 2 (Fall 1965) pp. 90-95.\n\ntypescript, was prepared at the time he was assisting Royce in organizing Peirce’s papers and collaborating with him on an article entitled \"Charles Sanders Peirce\" which appeared in the Journal of Philosophy, December 21, 1916, a memorial issue devoted to Peirce. Lenzen's \"Notes on Papers and MSS. in The Charles S. Peirce Collection,\" a twenty-page typescript, is an evaluation of the contents and the physical condition of the manuscripts which, at the time (December 1917), were sorted into eighty-three boxes. The Kernan and Lenzen typescripts, along with the catalogues of Boler and McMahan, are kept with the Peirce Papers, and are available for consultation.\n\nNeedless to say, I am indebted to all those who have shared in the ordering and cataloguing of the Peirce Papers. Nor is my indebtedness limited to those who were actively engaged in cataloguing per se. My indebtedness extends to the several editors of the Collected Papers who were engaged, along with the others, in the work of identifying, classifying, and uniting papers which had become separated. With very few exceptions, the readers of this catalogue and of the microfilm edition of Peirce’s papers which has recently been made available, and even the persons who may in the future use this catalogue as a guide to the original papers themselves, will get only a very inadequate sense of the years of labor that have gone into this sort of preliminary editorial work. For this and other reasons I want to record my indebtedness to those who most recently have been and still continue to be engaged in that same work of identifying, classifying, and reassembling. Besides Max H. Fisch, for whom a special word of gratitude is reserved, I wish to mention especially the contributions of Carolyn Eisele to the mathematics and the history of science sections of the Catalogue, of Ruth B. Fisch to the biography and correspondence sections, and of Don D. Roberts who ordered and provided a page-by-page index of the important Logic Notebook (MS. 339) and who had done considerable work on a number of logic manuscripts. Although each of the persons mentioned had areas of spe-cial interest, their efforts in behalf of the Catalogue were not confined only to those areas. Over the past few years earlier drafts of this catalogue were in active use, and this afforded opportunity for correction and am-plification. The present catalogue is the beneficiary of both. So to those persons mentioned, I owe much of what is valuable in this catalogue; for its failures, I alone am responsible.\n\nMy major debt of gratitude is to Max H. Fisch. It is only right to point out the fact that he, along with Ruth B. Fisch, has spent an incredible amount of time on the sort of preliminary editorial work noted above. Therefore, it is not surprising that nearly every page of the Catalogue bears witness to his scholarship and encyclopedic knowledge of Peirce’s life and works. To be more specific: McMahan's catalogue dealt reasonably well with Peirce’s mathematical, philosophical, and scientific papers, but only sketchily with his correspondence and other papers of biographical interest. It was Professor Fisch's extensive work on the correspondence and these other papers which resulted, especially in the case of the correspondence, in the organization exhibited in this catalogue. Moreover, it was he, who, more than anyone else, saw the need, not only for a more adequate catalogue of Peirce’s papers than existed at the time but also for the preservation of the papers themselves. So two projects cataloguing and microfilming were joined and brought to completion under his watchful eye.\n\nThis catalogue would not have been possible had it not been for the generosity of the Department of Philosophy of Harvard University, not only for consenting to and encouraging the cataloguing project but also for contributing very substantial financial assistance along the way. Specifically, I want to acknowledge a grant for the academic year 1960-61, wich allowed me to prepare the ground for the Catalogue, and other grants which enabled me to complete the project. I want also to acknowledge my gratitude to Professors Morton G. White and Donald C. Williams, who made up the Peirce Committee of the Harvard Philosophy Department, for their cordial cooperation throughout the years I was engaged on the project; to the Department for permission to quote from the unpublished manuscripts; and to the Department, again, for its generous subsidy that cleared the way for publication of the Catalogue.\n\nI also wish to express my gratitude to the Henry P. Kendall Foundation for a grant-in-aid which got me through one summer and to the Mount Holyoke College Grants Committee for a research grant which helped to defray the cost of preparing the manuscript for publication. Grateful acknowledgment is made to the librarians, both at Harvard and Mount Holyoke College, whose cooperation contributed to the success of this project, but in particular to Miss Carolyn Jakeman of the Houghton Library and to Dr. William Bond, its Director. I would also like to express my thanks to Leone Barron, Director of the University of Massachusetts Press, for her unfailing enthusiasm and valuable editorial advice; to several Mount Holyoke College students for help in various ways, but principally to Miss Diane Goldberg for her help in connection with Appendix II and the General Index; and finally to my wife for her help at different stages in the preparation of the Catalogue.\n\nRICHARD S. ROBIN\n\nSouth Hadley, Massachusetts\n\nJune, 1967\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt had been evident for some time that an updated catalogue of the Charles S. Peirce Papers was needed, one which would survey the whole Collection, making as widely available as possible a detailed statement of what it contained and answering, so far as possible, the questions scholars raise, including those about the date of manuscripts and their relation to published versions. Indeed the manuscripts and correspondence are so voluminous and unwieldy that it is virtually impossible for anyone to deal with them successfully without benefit of the orientation which a catalogue of the kind envisioned would provide. Moreover, as the prospects of a microfilm edition of the Peirce Papers increased, so did the need for an adequate catalogue, which would reflect an orderly arrangement of the Papers and assist the users of a microfilm edition.\n\nThe catalogue which was finally produced is imperfect. It is imperfect because of the frequency of error in what already has been done. More importantly, it is imperfect because of what has not been done; that is, much remains to be done by way of identifying and describing, piecing together scattered fragments, assigning dates to undated manuscripts and letters, and the like. But, imperfect as this catalogue is, it is better than none at all, and all of us who contributed to it recognized that the needs for a comprehensive catalogue now outweighed the advantages of indefinite delay.\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE CATALOGUE\n\nAs noted in the Preface, the Catalogue is divided into two parts. The first part consists of manuscripts and related material; the second part comprises the correspondence, both Peirce’s and the correspondence of others. The organization of the correspondence presented no special problems, but the organization of what may be called the \"subject matter\" part of the Catalogue was another story, and a brief word concerning the problems encountered and the principle of organization finally adopted is in order.\n\nOf the two alternative ways of organizing a man's papers chronologically and by content neither way, in spite of the obvious advantages of each, was easily adapted to the Peirce Collection. Consider the following problems. If the decision is made to order by chronology, what then does one do with the large quantity of undated papers? (Less than half of the 1,644 catalogue entries are dated and of the dates not supplied by Peirce\n\nhimself many are conjectural.) Moreover one would have to expect that some of the material would be cut up rather badly as in those instances where Peirce comments on earlier articles. By virtue of temperament and other needs, Peirce can be described as just as Henry James had been an inveterate \"revisionist.\" His tendency to rework drafts of articles and books left future editors of his manuscripts with the problem of unscram-bling the various drafts, which, in some cases, had been written years apart.\n\nConsider now the problems resulting from a decision to order the manuscripts by content. How does one handle Peirce’s many digressions? Even more significant perhaps is the problem inherent in schemes that emphasize content; namely, the risk one runs of either imposing too much order or not enough order. Organization is rarely innocent, and the greater the organization the greater the risk that one's bias or interpretation will get in the way of a clear presentation of what there is. However, if one chooses to \"play it safe\" by arranging the manuscripts as much as possible according to content, thereby achieving a spectrum of sorts, and only then drawing the lines at the more palpable breaks, the results will tend to be nondescript. Finally, as was pointed out to me, if an index were eventually prepared, it would cancel out the need for ordering by content in the first place.\n\nA compromise between ordering by chronology and by content seemed called for. But what compromise? One answer was provided by Boler who, at one point, submitted a plan to the Harvard Philosophy Depart-ment which seemed perfectly reasonable and promising. His plan in-volved six steps: (X) following Burks's bibliography of Peirce’s published works (Collected Papers, Vol. VIII, pp. 260-321), locate and file the man-uscripts for each entry; (2) place alternative drafts (and identifiable fragments) with above; (3) from the remaining unpublished material, file what is alike in content with above; (4) also, some of the remaining material, especially complete drafts and identifiable fragments, may be filed chronologically; (5) whenever possible, arrange what remains according to content; (6) finally, classify the remainder of unidentifiable fragments as such. Boler confessed that he became disillusioned about the idea that Steps 3 and 4 would take care of the bulk of the material. I too became disillusioned, and for the reasons Boler gave. But my difficulties with Boler's plan carried somewhat further.\n\nPerhaps the decisive factor in the decision which was ultimately made to compromise while emphasizing content was the fact that the bulk of Peirce’s philosophical and other manuscripts the \"Archives\" material had already been classified by content, in accordance with a scheme adopted by McMahan. The \"Houghton\" material which had been cata-logued independently by Boler on the basis of some other scheme was from the point of view of both quantity and quality far less significant.\n\nIt was tempting, therefore, to adopt the McMahan catalogue, with its principle of organization, incorporating the \"Houghton\" material as best one could. In this way, the manuscripts might be consolidated, but even more important, since consolidation might be achieved in other ways, was the amount of time and work that could be saved.\n\nThe decision to adopt Peirce’s own classification of the sciences (which in effect, is what McMahan did) was clearly a practical one, but only in part. Independently there are good reasons for turning to Peirce’s classi-ficatory scheme. For one thing, it has the advantage of spreading out Peirce’s manuscripts in an orderly way without making the results appear nondescript and without imposing more order than is absolutely necessary. For another thing, it is Peirce’s scheme, not someone else's, concocted for the occasion.\n\nThere are a number of accounts of Peirce’s classificatory scheme of the sciences. In brief, his classification begins with the distinction between a theoretical and a practical science, a distinction based upon the difference of two interests the theoretical interest in attaining knowledge for its own sake and the practical interest in attaining knowledge for the sake of something else. The theoretical branch of science is subdivided into (a) the sciences of discovery and (b) the sciences of review, with the latter dependent upon the former, since review implies the review of something which, in this case, is the information provided by the various sciences of discovery. Indeed, Peirce’s own studies in classification are subsumed under (b), as one might expect.\n\nAlthough Peirce did classify the practical sciences, he was chiefly con-cerned with the theoretical ones, especially those which fell under the heading \"sciences of discovery\" or, in other places, \"sciences of research,\" and it is his classificatory scheme for those sciences which turned out to be most useful for our purposes. Below is one of several tabular listings from Peirce’s papers.*\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\nPhenomenology, or Ideoscopy\n\nNormative Science\n\nEsthetics\n\nEthics\n\nLogic\n\nSpeculative Grammar\n\nCritic\n\nMethodeutic\n\nMetaphysics\n\nIDIOSCOPY, or SPECIAL SCIENCE\n\nPhysics\n\nNomological Physics\n\nClassificatory Physics\n\nDescriptive Physics\n\nPsychics\n\nNomological Psychics [Psychology]\n\nClassificatory Psychics [Ethnology]\n\nDescriptive Psychics [History]\n\n* This particular list is taken from a manuscript placed with the Matthew Mattoon Curtis correspondence (L107). The manuscript is an incomplete draft of a philosophical autobiography prepared in response to Curtis's request for information concerning Peirce’s logical and philosophical views. For a more complete account of Peirce’s classificatory scheme for the sciences, see Collected Papers, Vol. I, pp. 75-137. For a good summary account, see Thomas Goudge, The Thought of C. S. Peirce (Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1950) pp. 44-50.\n\nThe above listing is for the sciences of discovery (research) only. It should also be clear that the listing is incomplete, for it fails to give the subdivisions of mathematics, metaphysics, and the idioscopic sciences, especially the last with its elaborate arrangement of suborders, families, and subfamilies.\n\nThe listing also fails to indicate the hierarchical character of Peirce’s classificatory scheme. For Peirce, the sciences listed first are independent of those listed later. Or, if you like, when borrowing occurs, each science tends to borrow from those sciences which precede it in the classification. Thus, for example, in the case of the subdivisions of logic, methodeutic rests upon both critic and speculative grammar, critic upon speculative grammar alone vis a vis the divisions of logic, and speculative grammar upon neither, but only upon those sciences (ethics, esthetics, phenomenology, mathematics) which precede it in the hierarchy. Or, more generally, the mathematician, as such, working independently of the other scientists, seeking formal, not material, truth, traces out the necessary consequences of hypotheses which others, to be sure, may posit. Philosophy (all branches) is dependent upon mathematics, but takes precedence over all the special sciences, which follow it in the hierarchical scheme.\n\nIf one examines my table of contents, and observes the order in which Peirce’s papers are catalogued, one will note the Catalogue's general adherence to Peirce’s classificatory scheme. The Catalogue lists Peirce’s mathematical works first, and attempts to deal with these works along the lines suggested by Peirce’s division of mathematics into the mathe-matics of logic, of discrete series, of continua and pseudo-continua. The items listed toward the end textbooks, recreations, computations and fragments are conveniently placed there, and have nothing to do with the classificatory scheme for mathematics.\n\nIf one ignores pragmatism the next major division of the manuscripts following mathematics and concentrates on the other divisions (phe-nomenology, logic, metaphysics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geodesy, psychology, linguistics, history, sciences of review, practical science), especially the order in which they occur in the Catalogue, one ought to observe that the remainder of the Catalogue follows Peirce’s classificatory scheme, although this may not be self-evident with respect to some of the divisions Why, for example, does chemistry precede astronomy, both in Peirce’s scheme and in my catalogue? The reason is that chemistry falls under classificatory physics whereas astronomy falls under descriptive physics, and classificatory physics takes precedence over descriptive physics in Peirce’s scheme. Again: Why does linguistics take precedence over history? The answer is that linguistics falls under classificatory psychics, and history, as already indicated, falls under descriptive psychics. Since classificatory psychics precedes descriptive psychics in Peirce’s account, linguistics takes precedence over history.\n\nThis is not to say that I have slavishly followed Peirce’s scheme for the classification of the sciences. As a matter of fact, a rigid adherence to Peirce’s scheme is neither required nor desirable. I have followed the scheme only so far as it proved to be advantageous to do so; I have de-parted from it whenever I concluded that by adhering to it the presen-tation of the Peirce material would be hampered Indeed, if one observes closely the organization of this catalogue, one will observe the many liberties taken with Peirce’s classificatory scheme, with perhaps the major liberty taken with respect to the manuscripts on pragmatism.\n\nPragmatism, as a division or heading, presents a special problem. As things stand, given Peirce’s classificatory scheme, the manuscripts on pragmatism are out of order. They ought to be in closer proximity than they are now to the logical manuscripts. Pragmatism clearly cuts across the divisions of logic, and perhaps ought to have been subsumed under logic, that is, under one or more of its divisions. After all, did not Peirce come to the view that pragmatism is the logic of abduction? The justification for its present position in the Catalogue, as a separate division between mathematics and phenomenology, rests on the desire not to bury pragmatism among the manuscripts on logic, because of the general im-portance of pragmatism in Peirce’s thought and of the lecture series or series of articles of which many of the manuscripts form an integral part.\n\nThere are other kinds of problems. One kind concerns the gaps in the Catalogue. To cite one example, Peirce’s classificatory scheme calls for the ethnology of social development, one of the sciences comprising one of the many subdivisions of psychical science. The fact that there is no place or listing for it in the Catalogue means simply that none of the manuscripts of Peirce are concerned specifically with the ethnology of social development.\n\nMore serious, perhaps, is the failure of this catalogue to provide separate listings for, say, ethics or speculative grammar. But here the problem was not one of finding manuscripts which dealt specifically with ethical problems or the issues of speculative grammar. Indeed there are many such manuscripts. The problem was frequently that of separating units of larger works lecture series or series of articles or chapters in a proposed book something which this editor was reluctant to do. In such cases, the descriptions attached to catalogue entries and the general index are counted on to direct the reader's attention to subject matter for which the Catalogue provides no separate heading or listing.\n\nThen there is the other kind of problem one runs into when dealing with classificatory schemes generally the problem of how to classify this or that relative to the scheme with which one is working. For example, does this manuscript fall under logic or mathematics? Does that manuscript belong with the manuscripts on pragmatism or somewhere else? Often it is not a simple matter to decide, especially when Peirce digresses and when the digression becomes the most significant feature of the manuscript. Sometimes, usually in the case of notebooks, two quite different articles are begun, which forces the editor to decide their relative importance, with the ever present possibility of judgmental error. When confronted with problems of this kind, I have again counted on my descriptions to call attention to anomalies and the general index to bring similar but widely separated material together.\n\nFinally, there are the outright mistakes. One of these will serve as an example. There is no excuse for separating MSS. 314 and 316, since MS. 316 continues MS. 314. In this case the error was discovered only after the microfilming of the manuscripts was completed. Undoubtedly there are errors of this and other sorts which have yet to be discovered. Work on the Catalogue proceeded on the expectation that errors, both of commission and omission, would be made; it also proceeded in the hope that these errors, when discovered, would be reported and collected, and then, in one way or another, made available to users of this catalogue.\n\nTHE FORM OF THE CATALOGUE\n\nThe manuscript portion of the Catalogue differs from the correspondence portion with respect to the form employed in presenting the relevant information concerning each entry. For the manuscript portion, each entry is presented in an arrangement of six or seven parts:\n\n1. Title\n\n2. Abbreviated title (Mark)\n\n3. Type of material, whether manuscript, typescript, reprint, or other\n\n4. Publication\n\n5. Date\n\n6. Pagination\n\n7. Description of content\n\nIn the Catalogue, Parts 1 and 2 (title) are separated from Parts 3-6 (physical description) which in turn are separated from Part 7 (description of content).\n\nPeirce’s titles are presented without brackets or parentheses, just as they appear in the manuscripts. Title page punctuation is retained and the original spellings have been preserved in all titles without the use of sic to indicate deviations from the norm.\n\nThe use of brackets indicates that the title has been supplied by the editor. It goes without saying that when a title has been supplied, it is always in the absence of one provided by Peirce, either because he never provided one or because the title page is missing. In defense of supplying titles may I say that it serves as a convenient way of noting a manuscript's principal content and, in many cases, the supplied title as a brief description of the contents saves space by enabling us to dispense with a formal description at the end. May I also add that the supplied titles are sometimes less misleading than the titles which Peirce himself gives. Although Peirce’s titles no doubt acquaint us with his intentions, do they also acquaint us with the manuscript's contents? Certainly not in those cases where the manuscript progresses only a few pages and where Peirce’s introductory reflections have little or nothing to do with the title. Or, where the manuscript digresses from the topic indicated by the title, and the digression is the manuscript's distinctive feature.\n\nA large number of Peirce’s manuscripts have no title, but some of these possess a mark which is most often found in the upper left-hand corner of the manuscript page. When the mark occurs in conjunction with a title, it frequently stands for a short or abbreviated form of the title. It becomes a matter for conjecture when there is a mark but no title. In any event the occurrence of a mark is indicated by the use of parentheses. When the manuscript possesses both a title and a mark, the procedure is to record the title first and the mark in parentheses second. When the manuscript possesses only the mark, then the mark, distin-guished from the title by the use of parentheses, serves in place of the title.\n\nIn the next parts (3-6) I was concerned with identifying the type of material, whether a manuscript or typescript, or reprint, or book, or page proof, or galley proof, or the like. I was also concerned with whether, in the case of typescripts, reprints, books, and proofs, there was any annotation or correction.\n\nMost of the manuscripts were not published. But where publication had occurred this is noted by reference to Burks's bibliography and Fisch's two supplements. For an explanation of both Burks's and Fisch's manner of handling bibliographical references, see my explanations of conventions on p. xxvii f. The Catalogue notes whether a manuscript was published in full or in part, and where publication was in part only, precisely what part was published. The only exception to notification of publication occurs in those cases where a part, or even the whole of a manuscript, was published as part of another author's publication. For example, MS. 620 was published as an appendix to one of Fisch's articles on Peirce,* but there is no indication of this publication in the description of MS. 620. This happens to be a significant publication, but, in other cases, it was difficult to say what was and was not significant, and it did not seem worthwhile to mention every publication of this kind.\n\nWhen not placed within brackets or qualified in any other way, the given date is Peirce’s. As a rule one date is given and this is the date which is usually recorded on the title page or, in the case of some note-books, on the cover. Most often it is the only date. But where several dates are given, the range of dates is noted in the description.\n\nWhen the date is placed in brackets, then the date, as in the case of titles, has been supplied by someone other than Peirce. Whereas I supplied the titles, various persons at different times and with varying degrees of confidence supplied the dates. When the date is placed in brackets without any other qualifying mark, then it is presumed to be accurate, derived from reliable internal evidence. A date preceded by \"c.\" is presumed to be an accurate central locus of possible dates. A date followed by a question mark is frankly a \"best guess,\" based on some internal evidence. When the expression \"n.d.\" occurs, it means that for the moment not even a good guess can be made.\n\nThe pagination of a manuscript is indicated by two forms, for example, either pp. 1-5 or 5 pp. The first form signifies that the manuscript was numbered by Peirce; the second form gives the editor's count. One difficulty in determining a true page count rests with Peirce’s habit of using the verso of a page of manuscript for calculations or other notes which may or may not be related to the manuscript in question. The question of whether to count a page or not sometimes proved difficult and left room for judgmental error. For additional information concerning pagination, see the guide to the use and consultation of the microfilm edition of the Peirce Papers, prepared by the Harvard University Microreproduction Service, which is reproduced in the next section of this introduction.\n\n* See Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series, edited by Moore and Robin, University of Massachusetts Press, 1964, pp. 24-29.\n\nIn 1915, a few of the manuscripts had become separated from the main Peirce Collection. These were added to the general manuscript collection of the Harvard University Library. They were catalogued separately, each with its own call number. Now that they have been restored to the Peirce Collection, their old call numbers have been added to the description for the purpose of identifying them.\n\nIn the interest of economy the content descriptions (Part 7) have been pared down to the bare essentials necessary for a clear indication of what there is. The descriptions tend to be topical rather than critical, serving more the function of an index than an analytical table of contents. Not all entries have descriptions, although bracketed titles are intended in all cases to emphasize the principal content of the manuscript. For the most part Peirce’s own titles serve the same function. When they do not, a formal description is indicated and provided. But, in general, descriptions are provided for the important entries only, except where the lack of a description means either that, in the case of a draft of a complete or more refined version, the manuscript in question says nothing not already contained in the description of that later or refined version or contains no additional information which in the judgment of the editor is worth special notice. In any event the reader should take note of the number of pages of manuscript. If they are few, the topic or topics indicated by the title or by the formal description may not be very well developed.\n\nThroughout the manuscript portion of the Catalogue, although occurring infrequently, are entry numbers for which there are no manuscripts, as distinct from those entries where a manuscript exists but is missing. These \"holes\" were created by the fast that the manuscripts which were originally there have been recombined with other manuscripts and that this was done after the completion of the microfilming. Rather than renumber, the entry numbers were retained, but left blank. The \"holes\" may even have a use someday. They might conveniently serve as the means of slipping new Peirce material into the collection, if such material is ever uncovered.\n\nThe correspondence constitutes the last portion of the Catalogue and is divided into four parts: the Charles S. Peirce correspondence, which contains all of Peirce’s letters, both those he wrote and those he received; the Juliette Peirce correspondence, which contains all of Juliette Peirce’s correspondence, except such correspondence as involves Peirce jointly and which was, for this reason, placed with his correspondence; the family correspondence, which consists of correspondence among members of Peirce’s family but which does not involve Peirce or his wife Juliette directly; and miscellaneous correspondence.\n\nThe form adopted for the correspondence is the simplest possible one. For the Charles S. Peirce correspondence, the correspondents are listed alphabetically, the number of letters and letter drafts noted, and, when these are dated, the dates recorded, except when more than three of them are involved and when more than three are dated, in which case only the first and last dates are given. Where dates were lacking, an attempt was made to supply them, the procedure here being the same as for the manuscripts. Supplied dates appear in brackets, with or without \"c.\" and with or without question marks. The remaining parts of the correspondence follow the form of the first part.\n\nThe division of the Catalogue into two parts manuscripts (or, as sometimes represented, subject matter) and correspondence is a bit misleading insofar as it suggests that no correspondence is to be found in the first part and nothing which is classifiable as subject matter is to be found in the second part. On the contrary, an occasional letter draft may be found among the manuscripts; these were filmed with the manuscripts and all but those which appear on the versos of manuscript pages were subsequently placed with the correspondence, once it became clear that they belonged there. Not all of Peirce’s correspondence is personal and business correspondence. There is much which can be described as professional, so much so that if the first few pages and the last were set aside, the remainder could easily be mistaken for manuscript material. Indeed, this is the principal reason why some correspondence was originally placed with the manuscripts.\n\nFinally, a word about the four appendices. Appendix I is a supplement to my catalogue descriptions necessitated by certain discrepancies between the descriptions and what is contained in the microfilm edition of the Peirce Papers. (See the following section of this introduction for an explanation of the discrepancies and the manner of handling them.) Appendix II is a chronological listing of Peirce’s manuscripts. It is hoped that this listing can be expanded some day, as scholars are able to date more of Peirce’s manuscripts. Appendices III and IV are cross-reference tables. Appendix III is a cross-reference table from Burks's bibliography to my catalogue entries and Appendix IV, from McMahan's catalogue to mine. Anyone who so desires can set out from the Collected Papers and reach my catalogue entries through the intermediary of Burks's bibliog-raphy. See Burks's cross-reference index, pp. 325-330 of Vol. VIII of the Collected Papers.\n\nTHE MICROFILM EDITION\n\nTwo Peirce projects cataloguing and microfilming were linked almost from the beginning. The need for a new catalogue was evident; but so was the need to microfilm Peirce’s manuscripts and correspondence, for the physical condition of Peirce’s papers was a matter of grave concern. Although the entire collection is now kept in the Houghton Library, where temperature and air control give the papers the best chance for survival, it was feared that even with slightly more handling, given normal wear and tear, the deterioration of the papers would be rapid and alarming. With interest in Peirce mounting and with the expectation that the demand for consulting his papers would most likely increase in the years ahead, it was urged that steps be taken to microfilm them, or at least as much of them as there were funds for.\n\nThe success of the microfilming project depended in part on achieving a new arrangement of the Peirce Papers, one which would incorporate the efforts of the past, but would yield a single numerical sequence. With the present catalogue, the numbered sequence was achieved. This permitted the microfilming of Peirce’s manuscripts, with all of its advantages of preserving the original manuscript collection from the wear and tear of handling, of providing a record which might serve in place of any parts of the collection that might from time to time be lost, stolen, or destroyed, and finally of making the manuscripts readily available to scholars in all parts of the world.\n\nThere are some discrepancies between what was microfilmed and my catalogue descriptions. These are few considering the number of catalogue entries and the principal reason that there are any at all is that errors were discovered in the Catalogue before it was printed but only after the microfilming of the manuscripts was completed. Apart from a major change or two and some minor ones, the microfilm was left un-touched, mainly because of the expense involved in any extensive alteration. An asterisk placed before the catalogue entry number of the manuscript indicates that a discrepancy exists and directs attention to Appendix I \"A Supplement to the Catalogue Descriptions.\"\n\nA short guide to the use and consultation of the microfilm edition was prepared by the Harvard University Library Microreproduction Service in the Fall of 1964. For the benefit of those who will be working with the film and for the additional information concerning the manuscripts themselves, I reproduce the guide here.\n\nThis microfilm possesses some apparently anomalous features with which the reader ought to be acquainted to facilitate its use. The major part of the film's unusual features originates in the author's manner of composition.\n\nFirst it was the author's usual practice to write on one side only of the paper. Less than 5% of the material in this microfilm contained writing on the verso of the page. In the notebooks, Peirce usually wrote only on the recto pages; accordingly, to spare unnecessary expense, only those pages of the notebooks actually bearing text have been filmed. This accounts for the fact that notebooks appear to have been filmed in irregular fashion, sometimes as a single spread and sometimes as a double spread. A similar situation prevails with the material written on loose sheets. In a few instances, both with the notebooks and the loose sheets, Peirce used the opposite sides to make routine calculations, some related and some unrelated to the main body of the work. In most instances, these routine calculations have not been filmed. Where there was doubt about routineness or where the calculations were other than ordinary arithmetic, such material was microfilmed. Some of these data may thus appear to interrupt the normal sequence of the manuscript.\n\nAnother unusual feature concerns pagination. The manuscripts fol-low four schemes of pagination: (X) unpaged, (2) either even-numbered or odd-numbered, (3) normal, and (4) iterated pagination. The re-peated pagination almost always occurs in the notebooks when Peirce was constructing a draft If he was dissatisfied with his first draft of page 1, he would go on to the next page, number it also \"page 1,'' and continue with his revision until satisfied that he could carry on with page 2, and so on It is not uncommon for a page number to be thus repeated for four or five consecutive drafts before the next sequential number.\n\nOdd-numbered pagination only is common in the notebooks. Evi-dently this was Peirce’s way of indicating his consciousness that he was using only the rectos, or perhaps he was saving the versos for cor-rections or changes. In a few instances, an explanatory target accom-panies each frame of film and states that no pages are missing.\n\nUnpaged material has been placed in sequence insofar as this was ascertainable by the editors, and, of course, insofar as the actual pages were available.\n\nAt the end of a numbered sequence of pages, there will occasionally be found a miscellany of pages consisting of broken runs or isolated pages surviving from other drafts.\n\nAnother unusual condition arises from Peirce’s practice of starting some notebooks from the front, and upon reaching the center, turning the notebook upside down and beginning anew from the \"back.\" Sometimes the separate contents of such notebooks may be unrelated although they occupy the same physical and bibliographic unit; in other instances, after the notebook was turned upside down, the same material was continued. This condition prevails in little used as well as in full notebooks. Rather than inconvenience the reader of the film with upside down images or reversed pages sequences, all such material has been filmed for normal reading sequence. In each case a notice explaining this situation is filmed at the beginning, the center, and the \"end\" of the item.\n\nPeirce occasionally constructed from paper a physical device to be removed from a notebook and manipulated. An example is a dough-nut-like device he constructed to elucidate a point in topology. In filming devices, a first exposure has been made with the device in place, a second with the device removed, and if necessary for clarity, a third of the device itself.\n\nPrinted editorial forms used in connection with the partial publi-cation of this material by the Harvard University Press in the Col-lected Papers have remained with the collection, and it is possible that a few of these may have been accidentally incorporated into the micro-film. These are of course not a part of the collection and should be ignored.\n\nPostscript\n\nGenerally speaking, a catalogue of a man's writing stands as an impersonal record of his achievement. Standing alone it seems to cry out for some kind of personal statement, a portrait of sorts, which would complement the impersonal record. Of course it is a matter of conjecture as to what kind of personal statements or portrait of himself Peirce would have appreciated. In the introduction to a catalogue a panegyric seems somehow out of place. Perhaps it would be best to let the catalogue speak for itself. The display of prodigious intellectuality, creative genius, philosophic and scientific integrity, demonstrated therein, and, for one who knows something of the frustrations and deprivations of Peirce’s personal and professional life, the sense of tragedy that pervades the whole seem to me to be intellectually stimulating and, at times, profoundly moving.\n\nAbbreviations & Conventions\n\nA. autograph\n\nCSP Charles Sanders Peirce\n\nCollected Papers Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 8 vols., Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1931-1958.\n\nJP Juliette Peirce\n\nMS., MSS. manuscript(s)\n\nn.d. no date\n\nn.p. no place, i.e., of publication\n\nn.yr. no year\n\np, pp. page(s)\n\nPAAAS Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nr recto\n\nStudies in Logic Studies in Logic, By Members of the Johns Hopkins University (edited by Peirce), Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1883.\n\nTS. typescript\n\nv verso\n\nvol., vols. volume(s)\n\nFollowing the established practice, all references to the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce will be handled in this manner: first the volume number is given and then, after the decimal point, the paragraph number in that volume.

[Dyadic Value System]\n\nA. MS., n.p., n.d., 2 pp.\n\nThe simplest of value systems serves as the foundation for mathematics and, indeed, for all reasoning, because the purpose of reasoning is to establish the truth or falsity of our beliefs, and the relationship between truth and falsity is precisely that of a dyadic value system.\n\n7.

MS., n.p., [c.1895], pp. 1-13; 7-12, with an alternative p. 8 of another draft.\n\nThe principal questions raised are these: Why mathematics always deals with a system of quantity, what the different systems of quantity are and how they are characterized, and what the logical nature of infinity is. The relationship of logic and metaphysics to the three categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. Singular, dual, and plural fasts. Chaldean metaphysics; chaos to determinacy; the evolutionary process. Postulates of mathematical logic (pp. 7-12).\n\n14. On Quantity, with special reference to Collectional and Mathematical Infinity (Quantity)\n\nA. MS., n.p., [c.1895], pp. 1-34.\n\nThe nature of mathematics, pure and applied. In general, mathematics is concerned with the substance of hypotheses, drawing necessary conclusions from them; pure mathematics is concerned only with those hypotheses which contain nothing not relevant to the forms of deduction. The nature of quan-tity (real, rational, and imaginary). System of quaternions as an enlargement of the system of imaginary quantity. Possible grades of multitude. Spatial and temporal continuity. Common sense notions of continua, especially with regard to the flow of time. \"Continuum\" defined as \"a whole composed of parts, with the parts of the whole comprising a series, such that, taking any multitude whatever, a collection of those parts can be discovered the multitude of which is greater than the given multitude.\" Lastly, reasons are given for thinking that continuity exists beyond the evidence afforded by our natural beliefs in the continuity of space and time.\n\n15.

Mathematical proof and probable reasoning; the system and scale of quantity; the importance of quantity for mathematics. But to grasp the nature of mathematics is to grasp the three elements, which, with regard to consciousness, are feeling, consciousness of opposition, and consciousness of the clustering of ideas into sets. Recognition of the three elements in the three kinds of signs logicians employ. An analysis of the syllogism.\n\n17. On the Logic of Quantity (Logic of Quantity)\n\nA. MS., n.p., [c.1895], pp. 1-9; 7-10 of another draft.\n\nThis manuscript should be compared with MS. 16, to which it bears a special similarity.

On Multitude (On Multitude)\n\nA. MS., n.p., [c.1897], pp. 1-24, with 24 pp. of rejects and/or alternatives.\n\nAn inquiry into what grades of multitude of collections are mathematically possible. This is a logical inquiry because both a strict logica utens and the principles of logica docens are required. Collection is explained but not precisely defined.

MS., n.p., [c.1901-02?], pp. 1-20, with 3 pp. of variants.\n\nSetting out from two problems of dynamics both of which require for their solution the method of infinitesimals, CSP attempts an explanation of the method of infinitesimals, which requires, in turn, an explanation of collections and multiplicity. In addition, there is a discussion of the different modes of being, followed by a discussion of the distinction between reality and existence (for the purpose of showing that although nothing unreal can exist, something may be non-existent without being unreal).\n\n50.

MS., G-undated-7, pp. 1-8.\n\nPublished, in part, as 8.97-99. Unpublished (pp. 3-8). Denial of either the first or second of the two \"natural propositions,\" noted in that part of manuscript which was published, leads to a non-Euclidean geometry.

MS., n.p., n.d., pp. 1-5.\n\n119. Non-Euclidean Geometry\n\nA. MS., n.p., [c.1883 or later], 1 p. and 1 p.
