        "text": "The EXPERIMENTAL TELEVISION CENTER was founded in 1971, an outgrowth of a media access program established by Ralph Hocking at Binghamton University in 1969; today, the Center continues to provide support and services to the media arts community. We offer an international Residency Program, Grants to individuals and media organizations, and Sponsorship assistance for independent media and film artists, as well as an online resource the Video History Project.\n\nRESIDENCY PROGRAM\n\nThe RESIDENCY PROGRAM offers self-directed creative time to mediamakers from throughout the country. Since 1971 we have assisted over 1500 artists in the creation of works using new electronic video, sonic and digital technologies. Each year about 40 artists are invited to work in the studio, offering in a retreat-like workshop environment, access to an image processing system, intensive individualized instruction and time for exploration and personal creative growth. The system is a hybrid tool set, encouraging artists to create interactive relationships between older historically important analog instruments and new digital technologies, and to explore boundaries and intersections within narrative, documentary and experimental forms. With assistance from mediaThe foundation for the last several years, we have been able to continue to advance the digital components of the imaging system, incorporating several Apple computers, other sonic and control modules by Doepfer, interactive software including Max/MSP, Jitter and Pluggo as well as DVD authoring and editing software.\n\nFrom over 80 applicants, 47 artists representing 13 states, as well as the UK, Norway, Sweden and Canada worked in the Residency Program. Residents this year included 99 Hooker (NJ); Mara Alper (NY); Kristen Anchor (MD); Elise Baldwin (CA); Marko Bandobranski (Sweden); Allison Berkoy (NY); Kjell Bjorgeengen (Norway); Jenna Bliss (NY); Peter Byrne (NY); Lana Caplan (MA); Juan Cisneros (TX); Dearraindrop (NY); Cecelia Dougherty (CT); Carola Dreidemie (TX); Darren Floyd (NY); Benj Gerdes (NY); Tim Geraghty (NY); Alex Hahn (NY / Switzerland); Pamela Hawkins (NY); Allison Holt (MA); Sara Hornbacher (GA); Peter Kerlin (NY); Meg Knowles (NY); Katherine Liberovskaya (Canada); Justin Lincoln (VA); Terese Longva (Norway); Al Margolis (NY); Timm Mason (WA); Brian Milbrand (NY); Lee Montgomery (NM); Jared Nielsen (CA); Rebekka Palov (NY); Laura Paolini (Canada); Blithe Riley (NY); Julie Rooney (IN); Kamran Sadeghi (NY); Luke Schantz (NY); Tomas Stark (Sweden); Samuael Topiary (NY); Matt Underwood (RI); Roger Wyatt (NY); Frances Young (UK); Dustin Semel (OR); Greg Zifcak (CA).\n\nTapes produced at the Center were again included in exhibitions throughout the United States and Europe and on the Web.

Housed at the Center is a collection of over 1000 videotapes which chronicle work produced here over the last 30 years. We are a founding member of Independent Media Arts Preservation, and past participants of the Regional Cataloging Initiative and the National Moving Image Database project of the American Film Institute.\n\nBegun in 1994, the Video History Project is an online research initiative which reflects the complex evolution of the media arts field, the multiple and interrelated histories of the media arts field, and encourages a collective voice in the crafting of our histories.\n\nThe goals of the Video History Project are: to provide a dynamic vehicle for the creation and dissemination of an inclusive media history, crafted by those who are shaping it; To further the critical discourse among scholars and historians engaged with the study of the origins of media art; To capture the cultural environment, technological visions of individuals, and the modes of institutional support present during the early developmental years of media; To raise cultural awareness of the origins of media art; To increase public awareness of and appreciation for media history throughout the State and internationally. Goals are realized in an interrelated set of activities combining research and scholarship, through the enrichment of History Web content, and as collaborative projects supporting issues in electronic moving image preservation through the hosting of conferences and seminars.\n\nThe first conference, Video History: Making Connections, (1998) brought together over 250 pioneering practitioners and contemporary artists working in new media and interactive technologies. In June 2002, the Center invited over 60 media arts professionals, conservators, technical experts, and artists to gather at the historic firehouse home of Downtown Community TV Center in New York for Looking Back/Looking Forward, a two-day working symposium on moving image preservation. The symposium was organized by the Experimental Television Center, in association with Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) and Bay Area Video Coalition. Focused on the physical preservation of independent electronic media works and related issues concerning tools and ephemera, Looking Back/Looking Forward facilitated an honest and sometimes disturbing evaluation of our progress as a field and informed discussion about necessary and realistic initiatives and partnerships. The edited proceedings and reports are posted on the Experimental Television Center’s Video History site.\n\nResearch and scholarship is an important aspect of our program. We contributed to Playback: Preserving Analog Video, a DVD produced by BAVC (2003) with major support from the National Endowment for the Arts. We provided research into the early commercial video recorders relying on original manuscripts, technical data, and product literature, as well as photo and video documentation of the early equipment.\n\nThe Preservation area of the Video History website contains two commissioned texts. Video Preservation: The Basics (2000, 2002) by Sherry Miller Hocking and Mona Jimenez, and Reel to Real: A Case Study of BAVC’s Remastering Facility (2002) written by Luke Hones, and edited by Sherry Miller Hocking and Mona Jimenez. The Preservation resource area also contains a selection of historically important texts concerning early efforts at media preservation.\n\nIn 2003 we completed a CD Early Media Instruments featuring a database of significant imaging devices which played a critical role in the historical development of independent media art. The database contains photographs of the devices, examples of product literature, as well as texts and manuscripts describing the tools. The devices include video, audio and computer-based tools, both commercially available and designed by artists and engineers. The CD was featured in a three month long exhibition “Origins” at ArtsInteractive Gallery, curated by Mary Ann Kearns for the Cyberfest in Boston, along with representative tools from the era of the early 1970s.\n\nThe focus since 2000 has been on the continued enrichment of content on the Video History Web and the development and implementation of collaborative strategies for advancement of electronic moving image preservation resources and tools. The Video History Web functions as a both a dynamic and interactive on-going research collection and dissemination vehicle for media professionals, educators, and media programmers as well as the general public. Resources include critical essays, manuscripts, interviews, biographies, an extensive bibliography with nearly 3000 entries and information on collections, distribution, tools, preservation, organizations, and individuals. Visitors can generate a timeline of events in media arts history, or view the events within a defined range. Visitors are encouraged to contributed information and texts concerning the evolution of media art and community television.\n\nThe fully searchable site structure serves information contained in 12 databases holding over 6000 records. Results are reported topically, organized by resource area. The search function allows visitors to search all of the records, encouraging the visitor to discover broad interconnections among people, places and events.\n\nThis year the site had hundreds of thousands of visitors. It is a resource used by researchers, historians, artists, archives and video enthusiasts. We routinely respond to queries from researchers, scholars, educators and home enthusiast. The site has been an important tool for a range of activities – including original research for writing of books, catalogs and monographs; a method for locating primary source materials; a way for people to locate others they have lost contact with over the years; a source for preservation information.\n\nIn 2004-06 the Daniel Langlois Foundation for the Arts assisted with the continued development of the Video History Website. The Foundation supported eight organizations that encourage the meeting of art and science in the field of technologies. The Foundation received 168 submissions in response to its call for proposals within this program, of which eight were selected: four from Canada, two from the United States, one from India and one from Peru. With the assistance of the Langlois Foundation, as well as of the New York State Council on the Arts, we are focused presently on early video/media instruments - those tools designed individually or by artists and technologists working collaboratively, as well as innovative commercial devices. This research links associated texts, documentation, technical data, maker biographies and interviews, and tapes produced on these systems. Content derives from our tool and paper archives. We are also photographing the devices, and scanning associated texts, documentation, and ephemera related to events which include posters, exhibition program notes, exhibition catalogs; and audio and video interviews. The data is being published on the History Project Website.\n\nWe are collaborating with Kathy High of Rensselaer Polytech and Mona Jimenez of New York University on a book to be published in association with Felix: A Journal of Media Art and Communication. This project has received support from the NEA. The intent is to draw into the discussion new makers who have a relationship with analog devices either as part of their art practice or as an essential element of their conceptual base, and new media artists whose conceptual approaches are similar to those of early media practitioners.\n\nThe National Television and Video Preservation Foundation provided in-kind support in 2004-05 to preserve and remaster 10 hours of very early videotapes from the Center’s collection; the works were produced in the 1970s and showcase early analog and digital video imaging tools. The project focused on those instruments - tools individually designed by artists and the collaboration of artists and engineers/technologists, modifications to existing technology, and innovative applications of commercial technology – and the collaborative relationships between artists and engineers, and the interdisciplinary nature of early media arts practice. The tapes feature important early video devices designed in the early to mid 1970s, including those created by Nam June Paik (wobbulator or scan processor, and the construction of the Paik/Abe Video Synthesizer and its use with the TV Bed, exhibited at the Everson Museum in 1972), David Jones, Bill Hearn, Steve Rutt and Bill Etra, Dr. Don McArthur, the Vasulkas and Dan Sandin. We have informational materials, technical information, ephemera including early posters and programs, and photographs related to the tools.\n\nWe received an Artist in Residence Award from the Institute for Electronic Arts (2005-07) for the creation of series of 10 DVDs – Early Media Instruments - which document the operation of artists’ designed instruments, including the Paik/Abe Video Synthesizer, Paik Raster Manipulation Unit, Rutt/Etra, Sandin Image Processor, Jones Colorizer, Frame Buffer, Keyer and Sequencer. This set is distributed by Dave Jones Design.\n\nWe continue to work on the Migrating Media project, a partnership of Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center, Squeaky Wheel, Burchfield Penney Art Center and the Experimental Television Center. The project was developed as a model for new ways to prepare older media for a digital future ensuring a vital contemporary presence for the moving image art of the late 20th century. Migrating Media offers non-profit arts and cultural organizations in Upstate New York a forward-looking and efficient means to safeguard significant video collections of tapes that would otherwise be lost. Please see http://migratingmedianet.org for more information.\n\nWe have released Experimental Television Center: 1969-2009 a 5 DVD set with 130 page catalog of works created at the Residency Program over the last 40 years. The project manager was Aaron Miller, and the Designer Diane Bertolo and was supported in part by the Digitization Project of the New York State Council on the Arts and mediaThe foundation. The set is distributed by Electronic Arts Intermix.\n\nThe Center's programs are supported by the Electronic Media and Film Program at the New York State Council on the Arts • Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology • Media Arts Program of the National Endowment for the Arts • mediaThe foundation • NYS Challenge Grant Program • The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts • the New York Foundation for the Arts • Media Action Grant Program of Media Alliance • Institute for Electronic Arts at Alfred University • Everson Museum of Art • IMAP • BAVC • VidiPax • and by corporate support from Dave Jones Design • Black Hammer Productions • the contributions of many individual artists"
