    "text": "But first, the question: Why Fort Morgan?\n\nDick was born in Chicago, lived mostly in California, and died in Santa Ana at the age of 53. But when he was six weeks old his father changed jobs and PKD, his parents and his twin sister set off across the country for the new job in San Francisco. They stopped over in Fort Morgan to stay with family and while there, PKD’s twin sister died. The Fort Morgan family had a plot in the local cemetery so Jane was buried there. Because they were twins, the headstone was also carved with Philip’s name and birthdate. In 1982, after passing away due to complications from two strokes, Dick’s father brought his ashes back to Colorado so the twins could rest side-by-side for eternity.\n\nFavorite Literary Moments:\n\nJim Ringel: I thought we went back in time. Something about being in Fort Morgan. Something about it being a PKD festival. My favorite part of the weekend was hearing Nick Buchanan’s insight on PKD and the Craft of Writing. Nick led us through a line-by-line read of “Explorers We” (The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, 1959).\n\nNick gave numerous examples of Dick’s skill at writing with simple depth. Dick called it the ability to write brief sentences, one after the other, each “making the point neatly, and then exiting.” If you want to hear more about real pulp fiction minimalism, listen to Nick’s talk.\n\nAnother treat was Frank Hollander’s PKD Show & Tell session where we got to hold some true pulp fiction. I’m in my sixties. It’s been a while since I first drew kindergarten drawings on real, genuine manila paper with embedded wood pulp. It’s like going back in time. But I already mentioned that.\n\nCH Lips: My favorite moments were any time the three men on Friday morning’s panel entitled: “THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE: Phil’s First Masterpiece” allowed Tessa Dick, PKD’s fifth wife, to have the mike. I found her comments on her former husband’s work and personal life unexpected and fascinating. One of the other panelists was talking about how PKD relied heavily on the book, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, and Tessa added that PKD used to say that, in his opinion, the Nazis actually did win the war; the Nazi philosophies and methods were simply established by others—corporations, government authorities, not necessarily Germans—in other parts of the world where there were “expendable people” to exploit and subjugate.\n\nFavorite Sci-fi Moments\n\nCHL: Most definitely the Friday evening musical encomium at the gravesite by a guitarist who drove up from Denver in his white hearse. He set out his generator, amp and a couple of mute, headless, manikin backup singers and proceeded to jam. Check out Tessa Dick’s YouTube video (skip to 3:06) for the live action!"
