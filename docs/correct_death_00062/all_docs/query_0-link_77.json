Mrs. Kaems had been up and about as usual the past few days, although in an enfeebled condition, but was able to join with her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren in the celebration of her 101st birthday on Sunday, May 25. Lived With Her son Mrs. Kaems made her home with her son, Charles at 1216 Hamilton street. Funeral services will be held on Thursday afternoon from the Lutheran church, Eighth and Marshall streets, with Rev. Koeninger officiating. The remains will be taken to the church from the Vogelsang chapel on Thursday morning at nine o'clock, where they may be viewed by friends. The death of \"Mother\" Kaems brings to an end a long life extending over as span of more than a century. (Photo). For years, despite her advancing age, Mrs. Kaems took pride in a small garden at the home of her son, and worked among the plants and flowers in a manner that helped her retain her interest in life. She also insisted in aiding in the housework and despite her advanced years seldom used glasses. The calm and peaceful manner of death was a most happy end to one whose long life had been, at least in its later years, marked by placidity and contentment in the love of family and friends. It is probably the manner of going that she would have asked had she been privileged to choose and the serenity of death was beautiful. The sands of life had run low-there was no warning to indicate that the end was at hand, but the peaceful slumber of a tired body was merged into the everlasting sleep of death. Came Her 63 Years Ago Born in Germany May 25, 1839, Mrs. Kaems, nee Caroline Splittberger, grew to womanhood in her native city and at the age of 24 was married to Mr. Kaems. Four years later the couple with their two children, came to America to make a new home and after a few weeks at Milwaukee, located in this city. Nine years later Mr. Kaems was claimed by death and the widowed mother of eight children, five of whom are still living, devoted herself to the care of the family and has continued her residence here ever since, two of her sons also residing here, August Kaems and Charles Kaems. Other children are Julius Kaems at Sheboygan, Emil at Lena, North Dakota, and a daughter, Mrs. Olga Witzman, Green Bay. There are also many grand- children and great grandchildren. Burial of Mrs. Kaems will be at Evergreen cemetery. Manitowoc Herald News, Monday, June 2, 1930 P.1 ********* OLDEST RESIDENT OF CITY IS 99 TODAY MRS. CAROLINE KAEMS ENTERS CENTURY YEAR Aged Woman Active Today and Worked in Garden As She Greets Reporter [with photo you can sort of make out] Entering the century year of life, apparently in the best of health, active, happy and contented, Mrs. Caroline Kaems, Manitowoc�s oldest resident, today received the felicitations of relatives, neighbors and friends as she observed her 99th birthday at the home of her son, Charles Kaems, 1216 Hamilton street, with whom she has made her home for years. On Sunday a formal celebration of the anniversary of �Mother� Kaems is planned by her children and friends, a family reunion and festive gathering. Retaining the habit of years, thrift and industry of the race from which she comes, Mrs. Kaems was up betimes this morning and in her garden at 5:30 where she personally cares for her plants and growing vegetables, a hobby of her summers. A Herald-News reporter found the aged woman, keenly interested in her work and too busy to give time to a little matter of a birthday date. She spent some time in the garden and then insisted upon helping with the housework, particularly in the preparations of the noon day meal in the kitchen, a daily routine which she refuses to abandon at the behest of her son�s family. Mrs. Kaems indicated that she enjoys helping out and would not be contented if denied the right to do so. Uses Glasses Only Occasionally. Despite her advanced age Mrs. Kaems seldom uses glasses and maintains that her sight is as good as it was years ago. Of late, however, reading has become a task to her and she does not follow the practice as her wont in the past. Not, however, because she does not enjoy reading, but it tires her and she believes in conserving her strength, she declared. Mrs. Kaems retains her faculties in a most remarkable degree and she thoroughly enjoyed the visit of friends and neighbors who came to extend congratulations and well wishes today and is anxiously looking forward to the celebration on Sunday when relatives from Sheboygan and elsewhere will be here. Came Here 63 Years Ago. Born in Germany May 25, 1839, Mrs. Kaems, nee Caroline Splittberger, grew to womanhood in her native city and at the age of 24 was married to Mr. Kaems. Four years later the couple with their two children came to America to make a new home and after a few weeks at Milwaukee, located in this city. Nine years later Mr. Kaems was claimed by death and the widowed mother of eight children, five of whom are still living, devoted herself to the care of the family and has continued her residence here ever since, two of her sons also residing here, August Kaems and Charles Kaems. Other children are Julius at Sheboygan, Emil at Lena, North Dakota; and Mrs. Olga Witzman of Green Bay. There are grandchildren and great grandchildren who will come to greet Mrs. Kaems Sunday and the day will be memorable, as is today, with Mrs. Kurtz, son and daughter-- granddaughter and great grandchildren of Sheboygan here for the day. Talks Little. Mrs. Kaems is not inclined to be talkative to strangers and has grown a bit reticent with the family in the past few years, due probably to her age, but she expressed pleasure over the attention paid her today and said she was hoping the next year she would again greet her friends. Manitowoc Herald News, Friday, May 25, 1928 Page 2 ******* BURGLARS ENTER THE KAEMS' HOME Southside Family Finds House Robbed on Returning from Church Burglary of the home of Mrs. Carolina Kaems, 1216 Hamilton Street, was attempted Sunday night during the absence of the family at church and a small amount of plunder was carried away by the thieves. Entrance to the house was effected through a window in the pantry which had been raised and it is presumed that the burglar was frightened from his purpose as there was little evidence that the house had been ransacked. The cellar was visited and wine, in bottles, was taken and there was an attempt to ransack the upstairs rooms but the non-success of this leads to the belief that the thief was dissuaded from his work by the approach of someone. There is no clew to the perpetrator. Several similar attempts at robbery have been reported of late and the police are inclined to believe that tramps are responsible though the recent discovery that cars in the yards of the C & NW had been robbed, gives rise to the suspicion that there may be an organized gang at work in the city. This is the season of the year when a large number of strangers are in the city, boats laying up and it is well to be watchful of property and the home.

Was Over Ninety William Kaems was past 91 years of age, having been born in Germany December 26, 1830. He came to this country and direct to Manitowoc in 1856 and a year later was married to Miss Emily Gauger, the widow who, with four children, Robert, of Sheboygan; John of Milwaukee; August and Mrs. James Wettenkamp of this city, survive to mourn his death. For many years, Mr. Kaems was employed as a carpenter, retiring a few years ago to enjoy a well earned rest. September 26, 1917, the couple celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of their wedding and plans had been made for another big celebration in September this year, when they would have reached the sixty-first milestone in their journey through life together. A rather unusual fact in connection with the death is that while there are four children living, there are no grandchildren and only two great grandchildren. Mr. Kaems was always a quiet, unassuming citizen whose greatest pleasure was his own home. His death came as he had lived, quietly, and his passing marks the end of a well spent life.

Mrs. Kahl found the body of her husband slumped over the front seat of the machine, and with the engine running and garage doors closed. He told her at seven in the evening as she left the house, that he planned to clean and replace the spark plugs in the car and it is believed that he had started the motor to ascertain if the cleaned plugs were functioning properly and had neglected to open the garage doors. The deadly monoxide gas overcame him before he could turn off the ignition switch and open the garage doors. No Inquest Says Coroner Mrs. Kahl summoned a physician immediately who pronounced Mr. Kahl dead. Coroner W. G. Kemper was notified but after hearing the circumstances decided that the death was due to an accident and that no inquest would be necessary. Funeral services for Mr. Kahl will take place Thursday afternoon at two o�clock from the St. John�s Evangelical church. The remains will be removed to the Kahl home from the Pfeffer parlors tomorrow. The death of Mr. Kahl marked the passing of a man who had persevered over physical disability to continue to provide for his wife and family. Engaged in railroading since he came to Manitowoc as a young man back in 1898, Mr. Kahl was the victim of a serious accident in the lake front yards of the Northwestern in the summer of 1910. He was a member of the switching crew there and was caught between a string of cars and his legs were so badly crushed that they had to be amputated. He was confined in the hospital for months and finally was able to leave and by means of a special wheel contrivance got about the city. Returns To Work as Clerk Later he was able to make his way with the aid of two canes and he again entered the employ of the Northwestern road as a clerk in the local freight offices, where he continued to work for nineteen years, up to the time of his death. The deceased was born in Marinette, Sept. 26, 1876, and came to Manitowoc with his family in 1898. His father, H.F. Kahl, himself an old railroad man, is still living, being 81 years of age. He was here only a few days ago from his home at Fort Atkinson, Wis., for a visit with his son. The deceased was married to Miss Louise Schultz, in this city on June 6, 1900. She survives him with two sons, Robert of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Ralph of Milwaukee, and one daughter, Miss Grace, at home, the aged father H. F. Kahl and a sister, Miss Edith Kahl at Fort Atkinson, Wis., and one other sister. Mrs. John McWhorter of Crystal Falls, Ill. There is also one brother, William of Clintonville, Wis. Had warned Family of Danger The death of Mr. Kahl was a severe shock to his wife who remarked that her husband had always warned her and the children about starting the motor of the car in the garage before the doors were opened. She said that on entering the house and finding Mr. Kahl absent her first thought was of the garage and her fears that he had been overcome were confirmed when she heard the sound of a droning motor from the garage at the rear. After forcing her way in she found Mr. Kahl slumped over the front seat near the steering wheel as if he had been overcome as he was reaching in to shut off the spark. Despite his physical handicaps Mr. Kahl had always insisted on doing the repair work about the family automobile and had told his wife and daughter as they left the house last night at seven o�clock that he would be busied changing the spark plugs in the machine. The deceased was a member of the local railroad clerks� organization.

Mr. Kahl was injured in an accident at the lake front yards of the company early Sunday morning when he fell under a train of cars, three of which passed over his body, severing his legs and mangled the lower portion of his body in a terrible manner. No one witnessed the terrible accident which happened at 9:30 Sunday morning while Kahl, with his crew, was engaged in switching cars for the car ferries at the lake front yards of the C & NW. The engine had backed upon Track No. 1 to uncouple a number of cars and Kahl had made the coupling. The engine proceeded ahead and it was discovered that Kahl was not with the section and when fellow brakemen returned to seek him, the unfortunate man was found lying on the track, his legs cut and body mangled. Kahl, after uncoupling the cars attempted to board the train and grasped the iron ladder at the side of a car seeking to find a footing on the boxes of the wheels which is the manner usual to brakemen boarding moving cars. In some way his foot missed the box and he was drawn under the moving car and onto the track with the tragic result. Several minutes elapsed after the accident before Kahl was missed by the train men and search made for him and Kahl lost a large amount of blood. Dr. Pritchard, the resident physician of the Northwestern company, was summoned and a call was sent for the ambulance. Kahl was removed to the Holy Family Hospital where investigation revealed that both legs had been severed and amputation was necessary just below the hips that Kahl, even should he survive, will be unable to wear artificial limbs. Everything possible was done for the injured man who withstood the terrible ordeal far better than could be expected. Mr. Kahl was in charge of an engine for a fellow employe Sunday. The regular foreman desired a day off and Mr. Kahl, whose day it was to be on duty, was asked to take charge of the engine and crew and he consented. Mr. Kahl, the second brakeman of the crew, is comparatively a new man in the local yards and was working with Kahl for the first time. It was he who missed Kahl and made the search that revealed the injured man lying on the tracks. Kahl's first words were an inquiry for his wife and children and caution that the news of the accident be broken as easily as possible. That Kahl was not killed outright is little short of a miracle with the heavy cars passing over his body. The fact that he retained his hold on the rung of the ladder at the side of the car prevented the body being drawn under the wheels further. Had the wheels passed over the body just a trifle higher up, death would have been instant. The accident is one of those which occur from the dangers of work which the victim followed. The sight of the injured man mangled was one to move the heart. The accident is the first of its kind in the yards here in some time. Mr. Kahl has been an employee of the Chicago & Northwestern Co. for twelve years and for eleven years had been working in the local yards, preferring to remain in the city because he had his home here. He is 37 years of age and was married some years ago to Miss Louise Schultz and the couple have three children. Mr. Kahl is one of the most popular employees of the Northwestern line in this city and the terrible accident which has befallen him calls for the sympathy of innumerable friends in the community at large. At the hospital today it was said Mr. Kahl had passed a good night, resting easily and that his condition was most encouraging and physicians are hopeful that he may survive. The injured man is strong and robust health in this stood him in good stead in withstanding the shock of the accident and injury. Mr. Kahl and family resided at 17th and Columbus Streets.
