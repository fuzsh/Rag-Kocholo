    "text": "A Maze of Death, Philip K. Dick\n\nFirst edition, first printing of one of Dick's darker novels, \"a bleak, poisoned exercise in theology,\" marking the transition into his final productive period. Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Co., 1970. Original blue cloth with silver lettering to spine, not ex-library, dust jacket illustrated by Michelle Moschella; pp. 216. An about near fine copy in a very good or better, unclipped dust jacket. Binding is tight and sturdy, minor shelfwear to extremities, small spot of rubbing or adhesion lift near lower corner of flyleaf, faint offsetting opposite half-title, pastedowns just beginning to separate along joints, although fully secure, small light stain to first few pages, a few gently dog-eared pages. The unclipped dust jacket remains in nice shape, with light shelfwear to extremities, notably the spine tips, two small closed tears to back panel with a touch of toning to upper. A very presentable copy, protected in archival mylar."
