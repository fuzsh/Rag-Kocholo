You play as Casey, a strong-headed adventurer haunted by her troubled family history. You hear news that your father, a biologist long suspected dead in the treacherous wilderness of Northwest Canada, may still be alive. Searching for him, you find his mutated experiments and track his path, leading you to higher and more dangerous elevations. As night falls, you spot someone on a cliff ledge above you, with bated breath you climb up, but it’s not your father - it’s an unearthly abomination. Trapped in the mountain’s maze, you wonder, is time distorting your reality, or are you going mad with altitude sickness? Collect gruesome clues, decipher cryptic puzzles, perform cult rituals, and travel into family traumas in this mystical slow-burn horror story."
