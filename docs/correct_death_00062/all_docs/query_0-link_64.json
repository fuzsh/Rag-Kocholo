He married MARY ELITHE BELWOOD 17 Aug 1917 in Marshall, Saline County, Missouri, daughter of FOREE BELWOOD and GINEVRA HOFFMAN. She was born 30 Nov 1895 in Marshall, Saline County, Missouri, and died 29 Apr 1987 in Kansas City, Jackson County, Missouri.\n\n\n\nNotes for WILLIAM GOLAY BOATRIGHT:\n\nA lifelong resident of Missouri and a member of the Kansas City bar for more than forty years, William G. Boatright had to his credit a distinguished record of practice, particularly in the field of antitrust law, in which he won a wide reputation. He was attorney in a number of precedent-making cases, and he found time in a busy life for many other useful activities, particularly on behalf of his church.\n\nHe was a native of Pettis County, Missouri, and was born on July 31, 1896, the son of George Francis and Laura Belle (Golay) Boatright. His grandfather, William Green Boatright, a resident of Saline County, Missouri, was born in 1830 and died in 1921. His paternal grandmother was Nancy Frances Buie, who was born in 1839 and died in 1914.\n\nReared on a farm near Sedalia, Missouri, William G. Boatright attended the public schools, and graduated from Sedalia High School. He studied law in the offices of Lamm, Bohling & Lamm at Sedalia. He was admitted to the bar of the State of Missouri in July 1917. After serving in the armed forces during World War I, he became associated with the Ringolsky & Friedman law offices in Kansas City, Missouri, becoming a partner in the firm in 1924 with offices in the Lanthrop Building. This organization became Ringolsky, Boatright & Jacobs in 1929, and Mr. Boatright remained with that firm until March 1941, when he left to practice independently, with offices in the Commerce Building.\n\nMr. Boatright was widely recognized and respected for meticulous, skilful and thorough preparation of his cases. Weeks spent in research, study and examination of all possible directions to which testimony and trial developments might lead and his deep sense of obligation to clients won for him outstanding recognition as a truly fine trial lawyer.\n\nWhen, in the 1930s, Kansas City became a focus of national attention by reason of its vote fraud trials, he was engaged as trial attorney by several defendants.\n\nIn 1945, he was appointed by the Alien Property Custodian of the United States, under an executive order, to represent certain enemy aliens in litigation involving the will and estate of Conrad H. Mann, deceased. He achieved outstanding results in this lengthy and complicated litigation.\n\nin 1950, he was trial attorney for plaintiff in an action for treble damages against Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation and eight other major motion picture film companies. After seven weeks of trial, he was successful in obtaining for his client, Brookside Theatre Corporation, a verdict of $375,000 damages, which was automatically trebled under a provision of the Federal antitrust laws.\n\nIn 1952, he represented the Electric Theatre Company in a similar treble-damage action against these same major motion picture film companies, obtaining for his client a treble-damage judgement of approximately $2,400,000, in addition to important first-run film contracts. This case was settled along with eight other motion picture cases which he had brought involving other theatre owners against the powerful motion picture interests.\n\nIn 1953, he was chief trial attorney in an action brought on behalf of Harzfeld's Inc. for damages against the Otis Elevator Company resulting from the fall of an elevator. On eve of trial Mr. Boatright was successful in securing an outstanding settlement for client.\n\nHe was one of the organizers of the Lawyers Association of Kansas City in which he retained membership. He was also a member of the Kansas City Bar Association, the Missouri Bar Association, and the American Bar Association. His non-professional connections included the Carriage Club and the Henry County Hunting Club. He belonged to Country Club Lodge No. 656, the Masonic Lodge, Scottish Rite, Shrine Ararat Temple, and American Legion Post No. 50.\n\nMr. Boatright entered military service in May 1917. He attended the First Officers' Training Camp and served as Lieutenant in the 79th Field Artillery. He was overseas with the Expeditionary Forces from August, 1918 until June, 1919; however, he served as Captain in the Officers' Reserve Corp, 177th Field Artillery, until 1933.\n\nA Democrat in his politics, Mr. Boatright was much sought after as a speaker in behalf of his party's candidates, but never sought nor accepted candidacy himself.\n\nAmong the major interests outside of his profession was the Methodist Church in which he was an active layman for more than forty years. He served the denomination in many capacities and later in his own church, St. John's Methodist Church, as steward, trustee, teacher, youth leader and committee member. On more than one occasion he was Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Vice Chairman of the Official Board. Before the present St. John's Methodist Church was built, he was a charter member of the Brookside Methodist Church and on its Official Board. He was one of the leaders in the organization to its present site on Ward Parkway under the new name of St. John's Methodist Church. In later years, he attended services at Central Methodist Church. An outstanding Methodist clergyman of Kansas City, having first-hand knowledge of Mr. Boatright's work and activities has commented:\n\n\"He felt strongly on certain matters, for example he thought the church ought to be the church and not merely the tool in the hands of interested spectators. He never shirked what he considered to be his responsibility. He was extremely careful in carrying out every point, great and small, in Methodist polity... He knew the Bible well and had a deep sense of exposition.\"\n\nOne cannot begin to characterize his life without emphasizing his love for his family and the enjoyment he so plainly showed in the company and fellowship of his friends. He was keenly interested in sports, particularly fishing and hunting, and in gardening, agriculture and photography. He was an ardent student of history, political science and government. The quality of his mind and broadness of spirit enable him to be a self-educated man of rare exception.\n\nAt Marshall, Missouri, on August 12, 1917, William Golay Boatright married Elithe Belwood, daughter of Foree and Ginevra (Hoffman) Belwood. The couple became the parents of one daughter, Billie, who was born on December 9, 1918. She is the wife of Harmon Lynn Elder, of Washington D.C., and they have two sons: William Lynn and James Michael.\n\nMr. Boatright's death occurred at his home in Kansas City on February 3, 1959.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia of American Biography, Volume XXX, under the editorial direction of Winfield Scott Downs, published 1960.\n\n\n\nWilliam Golay Boatright and Mary Elithe Belwood wed on August 12, 1917, in Marshall, Missouri.

DEAN DUGGINS BOATRIGHT (GEORGE FRANCIS10, WILLIAM GREENE9, JACOB8, JACOB7, WILLIAM6, THOMAS5, JOHN4, JOHN3, JOHN2, Not Yet Determined1) was born 22 Jun 1898 in Houstonia, Pettis County, Missouri, and died 23 Aug 1994 in Rochester, Olmsted County, Minnesota. He married MILDRED GERTRUDE COLLINS 09 Oct 1920 in Sedalia, Pettis County, Missouri, daughter of WILLIAM ANDREW COLLINS and JULIA ELIZABETH DOW. She was born 02 Aug 1897 in Knob Noster, Johnson County, Missouri, and died 30 Oct 1978 in Sedalia, Pettis County, Missouri.\n\n\n\nNotes for DEAN DUGGINS BOATRIGHT:\n\nSee link for copy of death certificate.\n\n\n\nRemembering my Dad, Dean Duggins Boatright, Sr.\n\nby Ned Collins Boatright - June 2001\n\nDean Duggins Boatright, Sr. was a remarkable person. He was born on June 22, 1898 on a Missouri dirt farm. He died in Rochester, Minnesota on August 22, 1994 at age 96. During all of these years he evolved from a naďve country boy with a high school education into a business manager who spent 40 years of his life working for S. S. Kresge Company. Dean met my mother, Mildred, while attending Sadalia High School. One day after she died, I was visiting him and he drove me by the house where Mother lived with her family when he was courting her. It was almost dark, and he stopped the car in front of a frame house with a porch that ran across the front of the house. He told me that he and Mother used to sit in the swing on that porch and talk about their future. He then broke into tears. I have a picture of them taken on their wedding day - October 10, 1920. The picture reveals, in aging and sepia tones, a tall, gangling, large-handed countrified young man of 22, and a shy, lovely, musically gifted young woman of 23. Their eyes did not reflect, nor did they know, what the future held for them, but they went through it together - until death did indeed part them on October 30, 1978, 58 years later.\n\nDad was a workaholic. Through the years I became aware of his character and characteristics, beginning as I entered my teens during the 1930's. I realized then that he was engrossed constantly in his work as a Kresge store manager. He would leave for work around 7:00am each of the six mornings when the store was open, and return home from work around 7:00pm each evening. He ate lunch at the fountain in the store. He therefore spent at least 11 hours a day there, and then on Sunday would return to the store after Sunday church and dinner, to spend 3 hours changing the store window displays. Altogether he devoted 60 percent of his waking hours forty years of his life working for Kresge. At age 65 he retired and received a pension of $400 a month.\n\nUpon returning home each evening, Mother would say, \"How was your day?\" Dad would then say with a lift in his voice, \"we had an increase\" or with an unenthusiastic response, \"we had a decrease\". I learned in my elementary school years that this \"coded\" language meant that the sales of the store that day were either higher than or lower "
