        "text": "Dust jacket by Bill Sienkewicz\n\nPhilip K. Dick (1928-1982) was one of the seminal figures of 20th century science fiction. His many stories and novels, which include such classics as The Man in the High Castle and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, reflect a deeply personal worldview, exploring the fragile, multifarious nature of reality itself and examining those elements that make us--or fail to make us--fully human. He did as much as anyone to demolish the artificial barrier between genre fiction and \"literature,\" and the best of his work has earned a permanent place in American popular culture.\n\nUpon the Dull Earth is the third installment of a uniform, five-volume edition of The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick. This generous collection contains 23 stories and novellas written in 1953 and 1954, along with extensive--and valuable--story notes. Included here are a number of bona fide PKD classics, among them the title story, the brilliantly conceived account of a bizarre, ultimately catastrophic resurrection, \"The Father-Thing,\" in which a young boy comes to realize that his once familiar father has somehow changed, and \"The Golden Man\" (filmed in 2007 as \"Next\"), which tells the tale of a golden skinned mutant who may represent the future direction of the human race. These and all the other stories in this important and necessary book offer a wide range of literary and intellectual pleasures. At the same time, they provide a fascinating glimpse into the continuing development of this iconic--and hugely influential--figure.\n\nLimited: 250 numbered copies, bound in leather\n\nTrade: Fully cloth bound hardcover copies\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFair Game\n\nThe Hanging Stranger\n\nThe Eyes Have It\n\nThe Golden Man\n\nThe Turning Wheel\n\nThe Last of the Masters\n\nThe Father-Thing\n\nStrange Eden\n\nTony and the Beetles\n\nNull-O\n\nTo Serve the Master\n\nExhibit Piece\n\nThe Crawlers\n\nSales Pitch\n\nShell Game\n\nUpon the Dull Earth\n\nFoster, You're Dead\n\nPay for the Printer\n\nWar Veteran\n\nThe Chromium Fence\n\nMisadjustment\n\nA World of Talent\n\nPsi-Man Heal my Child\n\nNotes\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\n\"Fueled by sharp wit and an irrepressible undertone of paranoia, the 22 stories are a testament to Dick’s genre-transcendent genius; while some stories are a bit dated, the majority are timeless gems, still entertaining and thematically profound after half a century.\"\n\nFrom Booklist:\n\n\"...this third volume of Dick’s short fiction contains such stories as 'The Golden Man' (which was made in the movie Next); 'The Father-Thing,' in which a boy’s father is replaced by a replica; the religious-themed stories 'Upon the Dull Earth' and 'The Turning Wheel'; and the clever satire 'Foster, You’re Dead.' Although the book doesn’t contain a lot of classic Dick stories—some of these pieces are fairly obscure, having been rarely reprinted since their original publication—it does offer readers an excellent opportunity to explore Dick’s wide range of themes and literary styles.\""
