    "text": "The grave Philip K. Dick, the science-fiction author behind works including Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, can be found in Riverside Cemetery in Fort Morgan, Colorado.\n\nDick was born in Chicago in 1928, along with his fraternal twin sister Jane Charlotte Dick. Both were premature, and Jane died when they were just a few weeks old. She was buried in Colorado, where their grandparents lived. When she was buried, a space was left on the headstone for her brother. That grave lay waiting for Philip for the next five decades until his death in 1982."
