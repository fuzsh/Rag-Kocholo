    "text": "This is my third of Dick’s six 1950s novels. The other two were The Cosmic Puppets and The World Jones Made.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, Time Out of Joint reminds me of The Cosmic Puppets. Both are linear narratives, both are set in the 50s, and most importantly, both pose questions about the nature of reality, playing with the idea that things are not what they appear to be. The novels differ primarily in how they resolve their mysteries. This is where Time Out of Joint misses its mark. Some of the most intriguing ideas from the early part of the book just drop out of sight at the end.\n\n\n\nWhat I most enjoyed in the book was the philosophical speculation about the nature of reality and the meaning of words. When Ragle initiates a conversation with his brother-in-law about philosophy, he cites George Berkeley ~ the Idealist philosopher who proposed that nothing actually exists except as ideas in the mind of God. “How do we know that piano exists?” says Ragle and Vic replies “I’m sorry, but as far as I’m concerned, that’s just a bunch of words” (49).\n\n\n\nVic’s dismissal of Berkeley’s metaphysics as “just a bunch of words” inspires further speculation by Ragle.\n\n\n\n“Central problem in philosophy. Relation of word to object . . . what is a word? Arbitrary sign. But we live in words. Our reality, among words not things. No such thing as a thing anyhow; a gestalt in the mind. Thingness . . . sense of substance. An illusion. Word is more real than the object it represents. Word doesn’t represent reality. Word is reality. For us, anyhow. Maybe God gets to objects . Not us, though” (50).\n\n\n\nBut there are theological undertones as well.\n\n\n\n“In the beginning, he reflected, was the word” (40).\n\n\n\nLater Ragle repeats the words of St. John.\n\n\n\n“’Under everything else,’ Ragle said. ‘The word. Maybe it’s the word of God. The logos. ‘In the beginning was the Word‘”(170).\n\n\n\nThe religious theme in this book is not pronounced like it is in The Cosmic Puppets. In fact, it doesn’t seem particularly relevant to the story at all, but it is clearly something that infuses Dick’s writing even when it is not essential to the story. Junie calls Ragle a “sacred spirit” (157). Towards the end of the book, after Ragle discovers the truth, after the veil of illusion is lifted, he says: “I’m the savior of this planet” (202). But Ragle is not really Messianic like Jones is in The World Jones Made.\n\n\n\nThe philosophical foundation of Time Out of Joint is the Platonic distinction between the true nature of reality and the illusion that we usually mistake for reality. Once Ragle sets out to discover the truth, it is Immanuel Kant that he cites. Kant’s philosophy distinguishes between the world of our perceptions and the world as it truly is. “The Ding an sich, as Kant said” (170).\n\n\n\nAll this escalation of philosophical intensity leads to big expectations, but when the truth comes out, it’s anticlimactic. It’s a good enough idea in and of itself, but it only barely ties in with the philosophical speculation that precedes it. The slips of paper, for example, make little sense other than to heighten the mystery. They suggest something metaphysical that just isn’t there. Also, a practical matter ~ wouldn’t it have been easier to just build a soft-drink stand than to brainwash people into seeing one?\n\n\n\nBut this novel has its strengths as well and the greatest strength is the character of Ragle Gumm. In the setting of 1950s suburbia, Ragle lives with his sister and brother-in-law, making his living by participating in a daily newspaper contest which he always wins due to his remarkable ability to perceive patterns and solve puzzles, an ability akin to the precognition featured in other Dick novels. As the mystery gradually unfolds, Ragle questions his sanity.\n\n\n\n“I must be crazy, he said to himself.\n\n\n\nI’m the man who’s supposed to have fought in a war. I’m forty-six years old, supposedly an adult.\n\n\n\nYes, he thought. And I’m a man who lies around the house scrounging a living by filling out Where Will the Little Green Man Be Next? Puzzles in a newspaper contest. While other adults have jobs, wives, homes of their own.\n\n\n\nI’m a retarded—psychotic. Hallucinations. Yes, he thought. Insane. Infantile and lunatic. What am I doing, sitting here? Daydreams, at best. Fantasies about rocket ships shooting by overhead, armies and conspiracies. Paranoia.\n\n\n\nA paranoiac psychosis. Imagining that I’m the center of a vast effort by millions of men and women, involving billions of dollars and infinite work ... a universe revolving around me. Every molecule acting with me in mind. An outward radiation of importance ... to the stars. Ragle Gumm the object of the whole cosmic process, from the inception to final entropy. All matter and spirit, in order to wheel about me” (105-106).\n\n\n\nConsidering Dick’s own struggle with mental illness, this is a theme in his work that interests me. But there’s more than insanity going on here. Ragle may suspect that he is hallucinating, that he is paranoid, but he also questions his life choices. He questions his status as an adult. While other men work, he drinks beer, does puzzles, and canoodles with the neighbor’s wife. He describes his occupation as “scrounging a living.” He calls himself “infantile.”\n\n\n\nI wonder if this aspect of Ragle’s self-criticism is based on Dick himself. Either way, Ragle is a character that appealed to me right from the start. Perhaps it’s because of his self-doubt. Perhaps it’s because he feels like he isn’t living an adult life, even though he’s doing the best that he can. Perhaps it’s because he sees himself as infantile and insane even as he imagines himself to be the center of the universe. His delusions of grandeur coexist with his inferiority complex. But whatever the reason, I felt a connection with him."
