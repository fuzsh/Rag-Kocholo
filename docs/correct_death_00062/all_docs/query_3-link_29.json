    "text": "There are few science-fiction writers more popular or praised than Philip K. Dick, an author so well-known that his books now come emblazoned with his monogram, PKD, in giant letters on the cover.\n\nHis novel “Ubik” was the only sci-fi work to make Time’s 2010 list of the 100 greatest novels published since the magazine’s 1923 debut. At least a dozen feature films have been based on his writings.\n\nAmazon Studios released the latest adaptation, the 10-part television series “The Man in the High Castle,” earlier this month. It’s the second TV series based on his work to debut this fall, following Fox’s “Minority Report.”\n\nIf only he had lived to see it.\n\nPhilip K. Dick’s short, strange life came stuffed with many ironies and contradictions, but the greatest of all was that after three decades of toiling for modest popularity and little money, he died in Santa Ana, Calif., at 53, just three months before his fortunes would have changed wildly."
