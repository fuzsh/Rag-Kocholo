Mary was born about 1740 in Talbot County, Maryland and died in Talbot County, Maryland.\n\nA history of the Cockayne Family was written for the book, History of Marshall County, West Virginia 1984, published by the Marshall County Historical Society. The anonymous author was probably John Bennett Cockayne, according to Naomi Lowe Hupp, who recalls that John submitted information for the 1984 book.\n\nTHE COCKAYNE FAMILY\n\nThe Cockayne family originated in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, England. The senior branch of the family were lords of the manor of Ashbourne from about 1150 until 1671. A younger branch of the family were ennobled in Rushton Hall, in Northamptonshire. The male line of this branch became extinct in 1810. A grand-nephew of the last Viscount, George E. Adams, was the author of the Complete Peerage. He assumed the surname of Cockayne (spelling it the ancient way as Cokayne) by royal license. His son, Brien Cokayne, was Governor of the Bank of England for several years at the end of World War I and was created Baron Cullen of Ashbourne in 1920. His son, Charles, born in 1912, still holds this title. Another branch of the family were lords of the manor of Cockayne-Hatley in Bedfordshire from the early 1400's until the last representative of the line, Captain Samuel Cockayne of the Royal Navy, died in 1745. [The West Virginia family traces their line to colonial Maryland.] In 1761, Samuel Cockayne married Mary Lowe, whose family owned large tracts of land in Talbot and St. Marys Counties, Maryland. Of their four children, the oldest, William, went to sea at an early age and died, unmarried, of smallpox. The only daughter, Elizabeth, married a gentleman named McKain and moved to Kentucky at an early date. Carter Cockayne, the second son, born in 1764, came to Ohio County, Virginia with his younger brother, Samuel, born in 1768, and died unmarried in about 1850. Samuel, the youngest son, (1768-1854) came to Ohio County, Virginia in 1798 and settled on a 324-acre tract of land owned by Adam Wolford, and located in the southern part of the present town of Glen Dale. Samuel married Sarah Jones about 1791, and has five sons, William, Samuel, Hiram, Bennett, and Vincent Lowe Cockayne, as well as several daughters. He leased the 324-acre tract until 1816, when he purchased it from Wolford, who lived at Louisville, Kentucky. In 1817, he purchased an additional 100 acres to the north of the original tract (all hill land) from James Riggs. In 1839, his son, Bennett, purchased a 115-acre tract north of the original tract from the Tomlinson family. This tract fronted on the Ohio River, and ran from the present site of 10th Street, Glen Dale, to about the southern boundary of the R-Arms Motel, and included a strip of land between Little Grave Creek and the 100 acre tract. Bennett sold this tract to his father in 1840, so that Samuel Cockayne owned 539 acres at the time of his death in 1854. Samuel kept an \"ordinary,\" or hotel at his home, which is located just north of the Glen Dale Drive-In Theater. This was known as the \"Andrew Jackson Inn\".\n\nThe oldest son, William, died in about 1857 [21 Feb 1856]. He was the father of Thomas T. Cockayne, who had a well-known orchestra in Wheeling in the late 1800's. Samuel and Hiram, the next two sons moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1840. Bennett Cockayne (1805-1875) and Vincent Lowe Cockayne (1807-1886) divided the 539-acre tract upon their father's death in 1854. Vincent received 236 acres and the original homestead, which he called \"Valley Farm.\" Bennett received 303 acres to the north, including the 115-acre, the 100-acre tracts, and the 88 acres of the original 324-acre tract. He built his residence in about 1850 and a barn (which stood on the present site of John Marshall High School) at about the same time.\n\nVincent was the first bank president in Marshall County, serving as president of the Marshall County Bank from 1881 until his death in 1886. He married Louisa Johnson Lynn (1811-1863) in about 1838. By this marriage, he had two sons, William Lynn Cockayne (1839-1871) and John Randolph Cockayne (1843-1864), both of whom died unmarried, as well as a daughter, Alcinda (1841-1927), who married Shepherd McMechen (1827-1874), in 1868. Shepherd inherited the original McMechen homestead from his father, Benjamin McMechen, who died about 1855. The land that Shepherd owned included the present sites of the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation and the West Virginia portion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad yards in Benwood, West Virginia. Their daughter, Mary Lynn McMechen, born in 1869, married Clifford G. Stokes, and lived in Baltimore, Maryland, until her death, without children, in 1931. Vincent remarried in 1864 to Lydia McKee (1825-1907). By this marriage, he had two daughters, Caroline (Mrs. William W. Weightman), (1865-1936), and Emily Vincent (Mrs. William Martin Riggs), (1868-1948), both of whom died childless.\n\nBennett Cockayne married Sarah Price (1809-1884) in 1826. They had three sons: Alexander Cockayne (1827-1855), who graduated from the law school of the University of Virginia. He taught the first school in Glen Dale, located in the present home of Samuel A. Cockayne, across from John Marshall High School. He married Amelia Carr [Margaret Booth Carr] and had one son, Benjamin Cockayne (1853-1923). Benjamin married Sarah Brockman (1861-1944) and lived in Bellaire and later Tiffin, Ohio, They had one son, Charles Alexander Cockayne (1879-1949), a graduate of Heidelberg College, Tiffin, Ohio. He also attended Yale University, and was a teacher in Technical High School, Springfield, Massachusetts. There were four daughters of Benjamin, the last dying in the 1970s.\n\nBushrod Washington Cockayne (1829-1830) was the second son of Bennett and Sarah Cockayne. The youngest was Samuel A. J. Cockayne, (1841-1904), as well as six daughters, three of whom were married. Samuel A. J. Cockayne married Hannah Jane Alexander, of West Alexander, Pennsylvania in 1863. She gave the name \"Glen Dale Farm\" to the property on which they resided, and this is the derivation of the name of the town of Glen Dale. Bennett Cockayne served as postmaster at Moundsville from 1841 until 1849, and kept a general store in what was then Elizabethtown. Upon the death of Sarah Price Cockayne in 1884, Samuel A. J. Cockayne inherited the 303-acre tract. He built the small white house across from the north end of John Marshall High School in which John B. and Lisa Cockayne presently reside. He raised pure-bred, fine-wooled American Merino sheep and took first prize at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 for an American Merino ram's fleece. He and his wife, who died in 1917, were the parents of five daughters and one son: Ella P. Cockayne, married Dr. Thomas H. Meighen; Sarah P. Cockayne, married to Charles A. Showacre, a Moundsville attorney and bank executive; Gertrude Cockayne, married to Charles C. Schwob, President of the Mercantile Banking & Trust Co. in Moundsville; Dora Cockayne, died unmarried in 1947; Irena Cockayne, married to Craig Shaw, publisher of the Moundsville Echo; and Samuel A. Cockayne (1874-1953), who inherited the homestead and most of the farm upon the death of his mother in 1917. Craig and Irena were the parents of Samuel C. and Alexandra C. Shaw, who currently manage the Moundsville Echo.\n\nSamuel A. Cockayne married Beulah Smith of McMechen in 1919 (1881-1945). She had been an elementary teacher at the Center McMechen School for 18 years prior to her marriage. Samuel was a member of the Washington District Board of Education in the early 1930s and Postmaster of Glen Dale from 1935 to 1950. He was prominent in the Masonic Lodge in Moundsville for many years and a member of the Knights' Templar in Wheeling.\n\nThe current generation of the Cockayne family consists of Samuel A. J. Cockayne, born in 1921. He served as a Sergeant in the Signal Corps in the U. S. Army in the Pacific Theater from 1952-1945. He farmed until 1965, when the land east of Wheeling Avenue and west of Little Grave Creek was purchased by Marshall County Board of Education for John Marshall High School. John B. Cockayne, the younger son, born in 1923, served in the Army, Navy and Air Force between 1943 and 1952, being discharged from the Air Force in 1952 as a Staff Sergeant (Finance and Accounting). He was valedictorian of the 1941 graduating class at Moundsville High School. He worked in the U. S. Civil Service from 1953 to 1954 in Texas in the Veterans Administration and in Wheeling as a Claims Representative for the Social Security Administration from 1956 until he retired in 1978.

He mustered out 24 July 1865 at Louisville, Ky.\n\nHe is also named in the book as one who sang songs to keep the men's spirits up:\n\nPage 67: [Pertains to postwar, after discharge.]\"The commands of Rogers would never inspire them to bravery again; the cheery voice of Wilson to fall in, Company \"E\" need never more be obeyed; the songs of Cockayne cheer them in home sickness, or the jokes of Grove and Buck.......\"\n\nAnd \"Bill Cockayne\" is also named in a verse of a song sung by the 15th:\n\n\"Dave Hornbaker and Bill Cockayne\n\nThe Fifteenth will remember,\n\nOn that cold Christmas march we made\n\nTo Redbone, in December.\n\nThey grabbed the chickens from their roosts,\n\nAnd dressed them in the snow,\n\nAnd, when they ate them, left but bones,\n\nFor Benny Havens, O!\"\n\nWhen the book was written in 1887, William J. Cockayne is listed as a survivor of the war, then living in Burlington, Iowa.\n\nAccording to newspaper articles, William's postwar life was difficult at times. A war hero, William died of LEPTOMENINGITIS in 1901. [An inflammation of the pia and arachnoid membranes of the brain.]\n\nBurlington Evening Gazette, January 8, 1900 -- During yesterday's fire at the Sunday school scholars amused themselves by poking fun at Dr. W. J. Cocayne, who sells a remedy known as Golden Root compound, and whom the boys have dubbed \"Red-water Bill.\" - Cocayne lost his temper and instead of going into the house and leaving the field to the small boys he made a mistake of attempting to argue the matter with them, making several onslaughts on his tormenters with a buggy whip. The incident created great excitement and while the youngsters were clearly in the wrong, Cocayne could have saved himself considerable annoyance by getting out of sight. The average American small boy is the most irrepressible animal on earth, whether he has just escaped from a Sunday school or whether he never saw the inside of a church and discretion is always better than valor when a mob of them commence their \"kidding\" tactics.\n\nBurlington Evening Gazette, March 22, 1901-- TO MT. PLEASANT -- \"Doctor J. W. [W. J.] Cocayne is Adjudged Insane This Morning - And Sent to Hospital - Well Known Burlington Character and Vendor of Patent Medicine. -- The insane commissioners this morning sent \"Dr.\" J. W. Cocayne to the Mt. Pleasant hospital, thus removing from Burlington another of its long list of characters. - The eccentricities of the \"doctor\" have been strongly noticeable for several years past but his condition was not regarded as critical. Last evening he brought a steak into Riordan's restaurant and had it fried, ordering the other accessories of a square meal. When he finished his repast he complacently wiped his mouth and started to leave the room. Jim Riordan reminded him that he had forgotten to settle, but the \"doctor\" laughed him to scorn. A wordy altercation occurred, which ended in the arrest of the \"doctor\" by Officer Young. The prisoner after being placed in a cell at the police station talked so incoherently as to leave not the slightest doubt of his deranged mental condition and this morning it only took the insane commission a few minutes to dispose of his case. - When questioned as to the circumstances of last night's trouble Cockayne related lucidly enough that he had taken either a porterhouse steak or a round house steak into the chop house to have it fried and after eating a hearty meal the restaurant keeper had the audacity to ask him to pay for it. He indignantly refused, there was a fight and the restaurant man lost his life. Cocayne was firm in his belief that he had killed Riordan, but said he did it in self-defense. Sheriff Muenzenmeyer took the unfortunate man to Mt. Pleasant on No. 9. this morning. - Cocayne has resided in Burlington for a long term of years and gained his title of \"doctor\" through the manufacture and sale of a harmless but effective nostrum called \"Golden Root Compound.\" The medicine could be applied outwardly or taken inwardly with the equal effectiveness and the heads of many Burlington households considered it a necessary adjunct to the family medicine chest. At one time Cocayne was fairly well-to-do and owned some property, but domestic difficulties impoverished him and it is thought, contributed largely to the overthrow of his reason. Of late years the \"doctor\" has been the persistent butt of ridicule of the small boy of the city, who never lost an opportunity of singing out when the \"doctor\" hove into view, \"Red Water Bill.\" This petty persecution, no doubt, was another factor in the breaking down of his mental faculties and may have the effect of teaching the fresh youngsters of the city a lesson. It certainly is not pleasant for them to consider that they aided in driving a man to a mad house. - Cocayne is a member of Matthias Post G.A.R., and it was his delight on all occasions when the post turned out, to carry the old battle-scarred flag. If denied this honor he was quite emphatic in demanding an explanation. - Cocayne's case is a sad one. He was an upright, conscientious citizen and brave soldier and it is hoped that he will return to Burlington entirely cured of this malady.\n\nDes Moines Capital, Mar 25, 1901 -- INSANE MAN SUICIDES* -- William Cocayne Hangs Himself in His Cell at Mt. Pleasant - Special to the Capital.-- Burlington, March 25. - William Cocayne, who was sent to Mt. Pleasant hospital for the insane last week, was found by his attendant Saturday [Mar 23] hanging lifeless from the roof of his cell. Cocayne was a well known character in this city, where he had lived for years. He was a veteran of the civil war and won honorable mention for himself during his service. During his residence here, Cocayne was a local vender of patent medicines, and was often made the butt of ridicule by the boys of the streets. It is believed that the final breakdown of his mind was due in large part to the acts of these tormentors. His remains will be brought here for burial.\n\n*See attached article.\n\nWilliam married Mary Dodge [208] on 22 Nov 1873 in Burlington, Des Moines Co., Iowa.

As this case is an interesting one from the amount of property involved in it, and as the parties to it are known to a large number of your readers, I send the following short history of the case, thinking probably it will not prove entirely without interest to some of them: The will bears date February 15th, 1872, and was admitted to probate by the Clerk of the County Court on the 28th day of August, 1875, three and one-half years after the making thereof. It gives to Elizabeth Keyser, daughter of the testator, in addition to what she already received, fifteen hundred dollars, but does not release her husband from the payment of a note held against him by the testator. To his daughter Mary J. Chambers, the house and half lot of ground owned by the testator in Bellaire, Ohio, and nine hundred dollars. To his grandson Benjamin F. Cockayne, one thousand dollars to be paid to him upon his arriving at the age of 21 years, with interest from one year after the death of the testator. The interest to be paid to him annually. The will also contains the request that this wife of the testator give to Sarah and Martha Ellen, such portions of the household goods, and at such times as she may think proper. And to his wife, Sarah, during her lifetime, all his real estate, except the house and lot above mentioned, which consists of two hundred and ninety-seven acres of land, one hundred and fifteen acres of which is river bottom land, and very valuable, the balance is hill land. This land lies in what is known as \"Gravel Botttom,\" about two and one half miles above town, and fronts on the Ohio river. At the death of Mrs. Cockayne, the will provides that the land shall descend in fee simple to Samuel A. Cockayne, son of the testator, who is appointed sole executor of the will. The instrument was written by Hon. James D. Morris, who, together with Col. V. L. Cockayne, brother of the testator, are the attesting witnesses thereto. Mr. Cockayne had an attack of paralysis on the 25th day of December, 1871, (from which, however, he recovered sufficiently to attend to business, so the propounder of the will claims,) and died about the middle of August, 1875. The time intervening between the first attack of the malady and the signing and acknowledging of the will was about fifty days. The contestants in the present suit ask that the will be set aside on the grounds that, owing to the mental condition of the testator at the time of making the same, he was incapable of properly disposing of his property. Proceedings in the Circuit Court were brought to an abrupt pause one day last week by one of the attorneys, for the defendant demanding of his honor, the judge, that the case be declared out of court on the ground that the suit was improperly instituted against Samuel A. Cockayne and not against that gentleman, as executor of the will of Bennett Cockayne, deceased. This announcement was a perfect surprise to every one in the court room, and had about as startling an effect as the bursting of a twenty pound shell in their midst would have produced. His Honor held that the point was well taken, discharged the jury, and was about to dismiss the case, when an arrangement was agreed upon by the contestants and their attorneys by which the case was proceeded with.\n\nOwing to the illness of one of the jurors (Mr. Thompson), the case, by agreement, is being tried to eleven jurors.\n\nWheeling Register, March 4, 1878\n\nThe jury in the Cockayne will case came into court on Saturday, and at 11:20 A.M. submitted a verdict as follow:\n\n\"We the Jury find that the paper writing, dated February 15, 1872, in the issue joined, it is the true last will and testament of Bennett Cockayne, deceased.\n\nWm. M. Treadway, Foreman.\n\nThe counsel for the defendants moved for new trial. Decision upon motion defered until term in course, which commences on the 4th Monday to the present month.\n\nThus endeth the first chapter inthe above legal drama at a cost to the county of $475.\n\nThe unanimous opinion of all with whom I conversed upon the subject, who had listened to the testimony and arguments in the case is that, the verdict is \"strictly in accordance with the law and testimony.\"\n\nWheeling Register, Sept 4, 1878\n\nSamuel A.

Cockayne, deceased, born in Ohio county, Va., in 1807, died at his home near Moundsville, September 21,1886, was one of the prominent business men of the county. Samuel Cockayne, his father, was one of the first comers to this region from Maryland, engaged in farming and kept a hotel where his son afterward resided. The father died in 1856, leaving five sons, William, Samuel, Hiram, Bennett and Vincent. Vincent L. Cockayne devoted his life to farming, at which he was highly successful, and he became known as one of the enterprising and prosperous men of the region. He held an important position in relation to the business of the community, was the first president of the Ohio Valley Iron works, and at his death was one of the directors and president of the Marshall County bank. He was generally liberal with his means in promoting public enterprises. In 1838, Mr. Cockayne was married to Louisa J. Lynn, near Brownsville, Penn., and by this union had three children. The eldest, William L., died of consumption at the age of thirty-two; Alcinda C., married Shepherd McMechen, who died in 1874; and John R., who died in 1864. The mother of these children died in 1862, and in 1864, Mr. Cockayne was united to Lydia, daughter of Joseph and Margaret McKee of Ohio county. By this marriage were born two daughters, Caroline A. and Emily V., who are both graduates of the Wheeling Female college. Mrs. Cockayne and daughter are members of the Episcopal church. Joseph McKee, father of Mrs. Cockayne, was a farmer of Pennsylvania, was married in Maryland, and soon afterward moved to Ohio county, where he died in 1841, his wife surviving until 1868, when she died at the age of seventy-six years. Their five children were: Caroline M., married Jonathan E. Meredith, of Kittanning, Penn., a distinguished citizen, surveyor as early as 1835, member of the state senate for two years, a prothonotary for many years, who was born in 1812 and died in 1889; Sarah E., widow of Dr. G. W. Moore; Robert H., who went to sea and was lost; and Samuel A., captain of the Pittsburgh Blues, killed before Petersburg, in 1864.\n\nWheeling Register , Sept 24, 1886\n\nCOL. VINCENT L.

His second marriage occurred in 1864, to Miss Lydia McKee, his present wife. By this woman he had two daughters, Misses Carrie and Daisy Cockayne, recent graduates of Wheeling's excellent female college. The Col. was happy in all his domestic relations. He was an affectionate husband, and a kind and indulgent parent, and was held in high esteem by all his neighbors. He also filled an important and respectable position in the business community in which he resided, being liberal with his means in promoting public enterprises. He was the first president of the Ohio Valley Iron Works, and was at the time of his death one of the directors and president of the Marshall County Bank.

During an uninterrupted term of 35 years, in which he has been engaged in the ministry, he has been pastor of the following various churches: Fairmount, Marion county, one year; Harrison county, Va., two years; Monroe county, Ohio, one year; Elizabethtown, Marshall county, Va.; Caball county, Va.; Charleston, Va.; Point Pleasant and Buffalo, in Mason county; Charleston again, when he was transferred to the St. Louis conference: Independence, two years; Westport, Jackson county, Lexington four years, where he was the only minister allowed to preach during the winter of '62. Brownsville, Saline county, two years; Miami, two years; Independence again two years; Brownsville again two years, and Dover, where he now resides as pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church south, of that place. He also preaches at Higginsville, Corder and Three Groves. While in Caball county, he was appointed principal of Marshall Academy, and afterwards acted as agent of Marshall College, in same county, superintending its erection. June 1, 1848, he was united in marriage to Miss Margaret Kayne, of Marshall county, Va., by whom he has two children, Florence V. and Lucy. His wife dying, he was married the second time, January, 1857, to Miss Alvira Early, of Kanawha county, Va., a sister of Gen. Early. By this marriage he has four children, all living: Robert E., Hattie, William and Samuel. Mr. McFarland owns one of the finest libraries in the county. He is enjoying excellent health, notwithstanding his arduous duties and close application to the same. Has traveled quite extensively through the east, and is shortly intending to take a brief, much needed vacation, and visit the western coast. He is very popular with his people, preaching in practice as well as by precept.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n+ 70 F i.

COCKAYNE\n\nHe Died Very Suddenly at the County Infirmary, Last Evening\n\nPoor \"Tommy\" Cockayne is dead.\n\nThe end came last night about eleven o'clock, at the County Infirmary, where he has been living for a year or so past.\n\nHeart trouble must have been the cause, perhaps a result of the paralytic stroke from which he suffered for the past sixteen or eighteen months, and which followed in the wake of the accident about two years ago, by which he sustained a fracture of one of his arms. This accident was the beginning of the end for \"Tommy,\" and from that time he went steadily down the steep doclivity which has the poor house at the bottom of it. Almost forgotten in a city where his name was once a household word; known to few, where once he was known to all; old, a cripple, and penniless, \"Tommy's\" death last night at the institution named will doubtless awaken more of reminiscence than of regret - more of surprise than of sorrow.\n\nTime was when T. T.Cockayne was the best known man in Wheeling, and one of the most popular. All circles of society were open to him and his violin, and his orchestra, in the decade between 1850 and 1860, and for years thereafter as well, was part and parcel of almost every ball, hop or dance given, not only in this city, but throughout the surrounding country, on both sides of the river. Those were the days when Union and Melodian Halls were the resorts of the disciples of Terpsichore, and few were the functions there given that \"T. T. Cockayne's Cotillion Band\" was absent from. The givers of private parties claimed \"Tommy\" for weeks ahead, and scores of joyous wedding parties have tripped over the carpet to the music of this same orchestra, while no river excursion was completed without this organization of musicians. All during the war, and for many years thereafter, this popularity was kept up, but with the growth of the city and the advent of other musicians, \"Tommy's\" music was gradually crowded out. Still, so firm was his hold upon the public that he long continued to play for all manner of social events, and it was only a few years ago that he stepped aside completely from the gay world over which he so long \"called figures\" and wielded the bow. \"Tommy\" was not a musician, in the sense that he played from notes. That was a branch of the divine art which he never acquired. His music was learned by main strength and \"ear,\" but it was well learned, nevertheless, and in his prime his band was equal to every call made upon it.\n\nIn his later days \"Tommy\" took to the river, for which he always had a weak spot in his heart, and in various capacities he went up and down the Ohio, between Pittsburg and Cincinnati, his merry laugh and his inevitable violin being everywhere welcome. Few river men but know him like a brother, and few there are who will not recall him with a sigh. Jovial to a fault, upon occasions; peculiar to a most unusual degree, he had the faculty of making and holding friends in all walks of life, and his ear splitting laugh and his \"All is well,\" will be widely recalled, and by none more generally than by the older newspaper men of this city.\n\nThe deceased was about the Infirmary yesterday, and seemed no worse physically than for a long time past, but late last night he seemed to be particularly ill, and about eleven o'clock he suddenly dropped upon the floor, and when those present ran to his aid, he was dead. The remains will likely be taken charge of by relatives down the river.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n+ 77 F i. Grace Laron Cockayne [19] was born on 3 Sep 1869 in Wheeling, (W.) Va, died on 10 Nov 1952 in Los Angeles, California at age 83, and was buried Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA.\n\n78 F ii. Matti"
