    "text": "Existential struggles with technology, authoritarian governments, and paranoia; these are just a few of the themes readers will encounter when reading the works of Philip K. Dick.\n\nThe writer, commonly known by his initials PKD, was born on December 16, 1928, and died in 1982. He wrote 44 novels and over 120 short stories, most of which were published in the science fiction magazines of his era. But the novelist’s ideas would find their way into big-budget Hollywood film adaptations, including Blade Runner (based on PKD’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) Total Recall (based on, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale and Minority Report (based on PKD’s The Minority Report) among other film and television adaptations.\n\nPKD didn’t simply write science fiction; and he used the genre to explore deep philosophical and psychological questions about the nature of reality and individual perception. The writer’s protagonists were often misunderstood loners in conflict with authoritarian regimes and corporate entities and were often the ultimate underdogs. Reading PKD can be an exercise in questioning one’s own place in the universe.\n\nAlthough he is regarded as one of the most important science fiction writers of the 20th century, PKD struggled both financially and with his own personal health for many years. It was during a period of immense hardship that the writer was helped by fellow science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, who offered to buy PKD an electric typewriter.\n\nWhether you have read PKD before or have yet to explore the many worlds of the writer, here’s a list of PKD titles and related works that are worth reading and seeing.\n\nPhilip K Dick Titles and Related Works\n\nThe Man in the High Castle Dick, Philip K.
