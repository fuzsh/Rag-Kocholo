It is said by some who saw the remains that there were holes in the\n\nface, such as might have been made with shot. These were observed during the investigation by the coronoer's jury, but it ras the opinion of the latter that they\n\nwere the result of a decaying,of the flesh. It is not known that Lockwood had any\n\nenemies, but, nevertheless, according to the gentlemen referred to, the.claim is made\n\nthat he came to his death by foul means; He was missing two days'before his\n\nbody was found by his daughter in a corn field.\n\n10. From the Newpaper: Dubuque Daily Herald, Publication Date: Wednesday, October 24, 1900, page 5:-\n\nTHE DYERSVILLE TRADEGY\n\nCoroner Bennett Produces the Coroner's Jury Verdict in Bedford Lockwood's Case.\n\nJURY MADE A CRITICAL EXAMINATION\n\nThe Jurors, All Leading Citizens of Dyereville, 'Were Satisfied That Death Was Caused by Heart Disease.\n\nIf the article which appeared in last evening's Herald and is reproduced this morning in another column, regarding a tragedy in a nearby town refers to Bedford Lockwood's death at Dyersvllle, Coroner Bennett takes exceptions to it.\n\nCoroner Bennett was asked if he had heard anything of the report printed\n\nand stated he had, but that he had supposed It just vague rumor and for the reason he was In a position to say that Mr. Lockwood died of heart disease, he did not pay any attention to it.\n\nLockwood's dead body was found In the cornfield near his home August 20 last and the Jury that sat on the case was composed of Messrs. John Scheara, Dr. J. S. Brooks, and J. H. Huettenmlller. All of these gentlemen are well\n\nknown and highly esteemed residents of Dyersville.\n\nCoroner Bennett personally conducted the Inquest. Mr. Lockwood did not leave home in the night time. His wife testified that he started at 2 o'clock in the afternoon to drive some hogs out of the corn. His body was found the second day after. It was in the midst of the heated spell which was th e hottest of the summer and when found decomposition was well advanced. A physician in Dyersville testified that Lockwood\n\nwas badly affected with heart disease and asthma. Mr. Scheara, the foreman of the jury, told the jury that just a few days before he had seen Lockwood leaning over the fence panting for breath and almost too weak to walk. Other witnesses testified as to\n\nair. Lockwood's afflictions and his very weakened condition. The coroner and\n\njurors, one of whom was a doctor, examined the body and could find no trace of any foul play. The jurors, after hearing the evidence and learning the condition of Lockwood's health unanimously agreed on their verdict, which the coroner has, \"that deceased came to his death form natural causes.\"\n\nCoroner Bennett says that it was so plainly a case of natural death that had he ordered'a post mortem by physicians he would have been 'criticized for causing that expense. However, he says that now if there are any who think that he and the jurors were mistaken, that he will order the body disinterred and will make a full investigation. He says he has heard the story that Lockwood was killed from several\n\nsources in the last two weeks and he wants the rumors quieted. He says that if any reputable person will request it, thus giving foundtaion for it, he will order the body taken up and will probe the matter to the bottom\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• Baptism: St. Mary, Whitechapel,Middlesex, 30 Apr 1846.\n\n• Occupation: Farm Labourer (1860), Farmer (1870 - 1880), Teamster (1885 - 1900).\n\nBedford married Margaret Frances Crawford on 20 Jul 1865 in Dubuque, Iowa.

From the teslertree at ancestry.com\n\nCharles Barrett Lockwood (September 23, 1856 - November 8, 1914) was a British surgeon and anatomist who practiced surgery at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Lockwood was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nLockwood is remembered for his surgical work with femoral and inguinal hernias. He developed an infra-inguinal approach for femoral hernia operations that is known today as the low approach or Lockwood's operation. In 1893, he published an important book titled Radical Cure of Femoral and Inguinal Hernia.\n\nThe Lockwood's suspensory ligament of the eye is named after him. This structure is the thickened area of contact between Tenon's capsule and the sheaths of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles. This ligament is responsible for maintaining the position of the eyeball in its normal upward and forward position within the orbit.\n\n5.

From http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18959701\n\nMythical 'Tails of Lockwood'.\n\nThe cause of testicular ectopia has long been a mystery, and over the years, many hypotheses have been suggested to explain the condition. The most famous of these hypotheses is that of the 'Tails of Lockwood'. This developed from a paper written in 1888 by Charles Barrett Lockwood. Although little evidence has ever been found to corroborate this hypothesis, it remains in many textbooks and journal articles to the present day. In the 21st century, this theory should no longer be given as the cause for ectopic testes. Current biological evidence supports a complex process of growth, by elongation and migration of the gubernaculum, rather than a simple mechanical process of testicular descent, as proposed in the 18th century.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• Baptism: St. Thomas, Stockton, Durham, 19 Dec 1856.\n\n• Occupation: Surgeon (1881 - 1911).\n\nCharles married Florence Edith Wallace 194 about Mar 1908 in Barnet Registration District.423 Florence was born about 1887 in Tottenham, Middlesex and died on 21 Aug 1929 in Hydro Hotel, South Cliff, Eastbourne, Sussex424 aged about 42.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n203 M i.

Mr. H. G. L. Simpson defended. Prosecutrix, an intelligent and bright girl, detailed four occasions on which accused had assaulted her threatening that if she told any one both he and she would get Stockade. After the last occasion, which occurred on August 26, prosecutrix, who was in service in Germein street, wrote to her mother, with whom accused had been boarding. In accused's presence she admitted to her mother that the statements in the letter were true. Evelyn Margaret Biggs (mother of prosecutrix) said she was not living with her husband on account of the latter's habits. Prosecutrix was 15 3/4 years of age. Accused had lived with her as her husband. He had first lodged with her at Broken Hill, and then at the Semaphore. In August witness lived at Beehive Buildings, Glanville, and there received the letter referred to from her daughter. While she was reading it accused came in. Witness greeted him with, 'You dirty cur, I have found you out at last. No wonder my child always seems frightened of you. You are not satisfied with having ruined my child, you have tried to get other men into it also. He had previously tried to seize the letter, but then he went on his knees and said He would call on the Almighty to paralyse him if he were not innocent. Accused said to her, 'Don't go to a doctor in the Semaphore, it will open people's months.' He then went out. Her daughter had been subject to fits since the beginning of the present year. By Mr. Simpson— Witness obtained an order for separation from her husband at Broken Hill two years ago, and had since declined an offer made by him to make a home for her. Mr. Simpson— You sued him for maintenance, and were unsuccessful? Witness—Yes, you appeared for me. ? (Laugh ter.) Witness said that since the separation order she had kept the children. Though she had at first been fond of accused, she became as much afraid of him as her child had been. He had bought the children boots, but out of witness's money. Corroborative testimony of various details was given by several persons. Dr. Hone, Semaphore, gave medical testimony. Such trouble as that alleged might develop hysteria. Accused made a statement from the dock denying the charge. The jury, after ten minutes retirement, returned a verdict of guilty. His Honor said that accused had been twice convicted of larceny, and had neglected his own children, two of whom were at the Goodwood Orphanage. His career had been altogether discreditable, and the Bench firmly believed that he had kept the unfortunate child Biggs in constant terror and subject to his repeated assaults by threats that she would have to go to the Stockade and be burned with hot irons, though the Crown Solicitor had silenced the latter part of the threat in the girl's evidence as given in the lower Court. Accused would be sentenced to the maximum penalty for the offence with which he was charged. Two years imprisonment with hard labour.\n\n4.

With her marriage to John Mercer Finnis, the TONY FINNIS' GENEALOGY DATA-BASE at http://gw0.geneanet.org/ has another child William born 12 March 1897 - Malvern, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia (source birth: SA Birth Records 1842-1906). No other information has been found for William. There is also another child called Lionel but no source information is given.\n\nFrom the same website, the following extensive information on Florence is given:-\n\nFlorence Matilda FINNIS (Tilly) was an excellent singer, and also played the mandolin.\n\nShe sang under several stage names, the most common being Nell Finnis.\n\nAs an example, the cover of sheet music no. 230 (which features her photograph) states ----\n\nDO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST WALTZ?\n\nLYRICS by A.J. Mills --- MUSIC by Bennett Scott\n\nSung by MISS NELL FINNIS\n\nIn\n\nJ.C. WILLIAMSON LTD\n\nPantomime\n\nSINBAD THE SAILOR\n\nDuring Dame Nellie Melba´s return trip to Australia in 1902, her understudy became ill in Brisbane and Tilly was asked to stand in for the Adelaide concert. Nellie Melba was apparently so impressed that she asked her to also understudy for the Perth concert, which she did. After which Melba requested her to go with her for her coming English tour. Tilly then had to make a decision between her young family and a professional singing career. She chose her family, and Melba very bluntly told her that as she had decided to go against her wishes, this would be the end of her professional singing career and that nobody would engage her in the future. It is believed that she only sang for her family after this.\n\nAccording to family information and heresay, Tilly 'died of a broken heart'.\n\nCertainly, it would appear that Tilly's second marriage to Walter Whittingham ('Unc') was not only most unpopular with her children (his step-children) from the first marriage, but also it would appear that relations between them became fragile and strained. I have heard my father and aunts state that 'Unc' was virtually banned to a sleepout on the rear verandah of the family home at Kingswood (where he entertained and drank with his friends), and that he was 'only allowed inside the house for meals and on special occasions'. In subsequent conversations I had with John Storey this was confirmed as the situation as he knew it to be at the time. Family members referred to 'Unc' as 'a drunkard and a wastral', and that he had 'squandered the lot' as far as the family fortune was concerned.\n\nA gravestone was installed by her eldest son, Harold Jack FINNIS, at West Terrace Cemetery sometime after her burial which reads -\n\nFlorence Matilda\n\nBeloved Wife of Walter Whittingham\n\nDied 17th June 1936\n\nAged 64 Years\n\nThere are different birth dates given for Tilly from different sources, ie\n\n(a) South Australian Births Index 1842-1906\n\nMary Matilda LOCKWOOD Born 9 March 1868 in Adelaide, South Australia\n\nParents - George LOCKWOOD and Mary Hannah CULLEY.\n\n[It is believed that this is the correct record, apart from the difference in the name. Research carried out on the Lockwood family tree (Carol Richardson & John R Williams) tends to confirm that Florence Matilda and Mary Matilda are the same person. The parents are certainly correct]\n\n(b) South Australian Marriages Registrations 1842-1916\n\nJohn Mercer FINNIS (age 30) married Florence Matilda LOCKWOOD (age 20) at St. John Church, Adelaide on 1 October 1888. Brides father, George LOCKWOOD.\n\n[Florence Matilda's age of 20 confirms the birth year of 1868 above]\n\n(c) South Australian Marriages Registrations 1842-1916\n\nWalter WHITTINGHAM (age 38) married Florence Matilda LOCKWOOD (age 40) at St. Oswald Church, Parkside, South Australia on 9 July 1912. Brides father, George LOCKWOOD.\n\n[Based on above, birth year about 1872. As the bride was several years older than her second husband, it is believed she reduced her age somewhat]\n\n(d) West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia records.\n\nFlorence Matilda WHITTINGHAM died 19 June 1936 age 64 years\n\nWalter WHITTINGHAM died 14 May 1945 age 69 years\n\n[This is actually her burial date, however indicates a birth year of 1872 - probably based on marriage details above - again believed incorrect]\n\nSources:\n\n- individual: family\n\n- birth: SA Births Index 1842-1906 (*refer to Notes)\n\n- death, burial: West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide records\n\n- spouse 1: Marriage Register 1842-1916 (Ade 157/102)\n\n- spouse 2: S.A.
