    "text": "The following is a list of works about the spouses of presidents of the United States. While this list is mainly about presidential spouses, administrations with a bachelor or widowed president have a section on the individual (usually a family member) that filled the role of First Lady. The list includes books and journal articles written in English after c. 1900 as well as primary sources written by the individual themselves.\n\nThe books included here were selected because they were either published by an academic press or major nationally known publisher or were reviewed in mainstream academic journals.[a] These works are generally intended for an adult audience; works specifically intended for a youth or children are not included.\n\nSeveral presidents were unmarried for all or part of their administration.\n\nBecause this list also serves as a bibliography of first ladies, in these cases, when someone regularly filled the role of White House hostess and informal first lady while the president was unmarried, an entry is provided.\n\nGeneral works [ edit ]\n\nBooks\n\nAbrams, J.
