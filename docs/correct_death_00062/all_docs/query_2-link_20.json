        "text": "Philip K. Dick, an author of science fiction, died yesterday in Santa Ana, Calif. He was 54 years old. Mr. Dick, author of 35 novels and 6 collections of short stories, received the Hugo Award in 1963 for ''The Man in the High Castle'' and, in 1974, the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for ''Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.''\n\nIn The New York Times, Gerald Jonas wrote that ''in the top of his form, Philip Dick rivals Kurt Vonnegut.'' His last novel, ''The Transmigration of Timothy Archer,'' will be published in May by Timescape Books. Also to be released in May will be a film, ''Bladerunner,'' based on Mr. Dick's 1968 novel ''Do Androids Dream Electric Sheep?''\n\nBorn in Chicago, Mr. Dick attended the University of California at Berkeley for one year and spent most of his life in California. Although he married five times, he was unmarried at his death.\n\nSurviving are two daughters and a son."
