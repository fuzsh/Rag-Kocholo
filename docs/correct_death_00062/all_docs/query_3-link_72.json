    "text": "Philip K. Dick\n\nPhilip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction writer. He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social themes, and featured recurrent elements such as alternate realities, simulacra, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness, and often explored topics such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.\n\nThroughout his career, Dick’s writing style evolved, reflecting his personal struggles with mental health, including episodes of paranoia and hallucinations. These experiences often found their way into his works, adding an additional layer of introspection and existentialism.\n\nDespite receiving critical acclaim, Dick struggled financially for much of his life. His works were not always commercially successful during his lifetime, and he faced numerous setbacks. However, his unique storytelling and intellectual depth continued to resonate with a dedicated group of readers and fellow authors who recognized his genius.\n\nFollowing a series of religious experiences in 1974, Dick’s work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in novels A Scanner Darkly (1977) and VALIS (1981). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke.\n\nPhilip K. Dick’s posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking. Popular films based on his works include Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The Adjustment Bureau (2011). Beginning in 2015, Amazon produced the multi-season television adaptation The Man in the High Castle, based on Dick’s 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 began producing the ongoing anthology series Electric Dreams, based on various Dick stories. In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer included in The Library of America series.\n\nSince his passing, Dick’s influence has only grown, and his work continues to inspire and captivate readers worldwide. His impact on the science fiction genre is immeasurable, and his explorations of the human condition and the nature of reality remain relevant and thought-provoking to this day.\n\nPhilip K. Dick’s body of work stands as a testament to his literary genius and his ability to blend imaginative storytelling with profound philosophical inquiries. His contributions have left an indelible mark on the science fiction genre and continue to engage readers with their timeless themes and enduring relevance.\n\nPhilip K.
