    "text": "I love Philip K. Dick's books, and I love this novel. I see this novel as Michael Bishop having a tremendous amount of fun with some of Dick's signature elements and often revisited themes. It starts in an alternate universe where President Nixon has become King Richard in effect. It is a dystopian vision of America with travel restrictions, nearly non-existent constitutional rights, disastrous institutionalized racism, and a society desperately clinging to the idea of an American Dream that is in reality no longer attainable. Into this mess fall a displaced cowboy and his psychologist wife, a gung-ho patriotic actress and her politician husband, an \"americulturated\" Vietnamese store clerk, and some astronauts in America's moonbase--all goaded into action by the resurrected ghost or perhaps nanotechnology preserved consciousness or maybe just spirit of Philip K. Dick. It is a desperate race to save this particular reality from itself using the only weapons common to most of Dick's work: communication and a small piece of jewelry.\n\n\n\nI enjoyed this book on a lot of different levels. Primarily, I enjoyed the way Bishop crafted the characters and let them lead the story to its conclusion. Nothing seemed forced, and when we saw glimpses of the characters in other reality streams, it just strengthened the notion of the characters' personalities. I loved catching the references to Dick's work strewn throughout the novel, some blatantly obvious (\"Dolph Deckard\" anyone?) and some surprisingly subtle, and i loved the way Bishop built the plot on the back of Dick's often reused themes questioning reality and trying to figure just who the demiurge in charge really is. And I especially loved the ending - just the last few pages, where--well, I won't spoil it for you. Read A Scanner Darkly, read Ubik, read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and then READ THIS BOOK!"
