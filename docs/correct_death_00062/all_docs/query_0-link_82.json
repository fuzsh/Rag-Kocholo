His father, Conrad Young, was born in Germany and is buried in what is now Jackson Co., W. Va. John Young's mother was Anna Francisas. She was also born in Germany and was Conrad Young's first wife; Anna died by drowning. Conrad then married Margaret Hayes who was born in Nicholas Co., Va., now W. Va.; Margaret was killed by lightning. Conrad's third wife was Elizabeth Wood, born in Wood Co., Va., now W. Va.\n\nJohn Young married a widow, Keziah Townsend, the daughter of Lewis and Mary Tackett. Keziah had a little girl from her first marrieage who was captured by the Indians when Tackett's Fort was taken in 1788. The Townsend girl was separated from the rest of the prisoners during the Indians' escape and was never seen again. She may have been adopted by an Indian family or killed to speed up the escape.\n\nJohn Young was a Captain of Indian scouts and used to go out on long trips that would take several months. Keziah would often tell stories in her old age of how she sometimes had to eat weeds or greens boiled without meat while John was gone so long.\n\nThere is one story John Young used to tell with deep feeling in his old age. The Indians had killed and scalped the two little girls of Henry Morris. Shortly afterwards, John, some of the Morris family, and Fleming Cobb found Indian signs on Len's Creek. They followed the signs to the mouth of Indian Creek, a small branch of Coal River that takes its name from this incident. There they saw the Indians swimming across Coal River.\n\nOne of the Morrises fired his rifle and hit the last Indian. Too hurt to swim farther, the Indian turned back and appealed to John Young to save him. Morris paid no attention and killed the Indian with a tomahawk.\n\nWhen telling the story, John would sigh and say, \"The poor fellow lifted his arms to me for protection and said 'brother', and I didn't say one word of protest that might have caused Morris to hesitate.\"\n\nMorris afterwards said, \"I couldn't trust his parole, and my wife didn't tell me to bring home a pet Indian to play tomahawk with my children like they did with Brother Henry's.\"\n\nHenry Morris' other daughter, Sarah, married Charles Young, son of Conrad Young and Margaret Hayes. Charles and Sarah's son, John Young, married his first cousin, Margaret Young, a daughter of John and Keziah.\n\nLewis Tackett\n\nJohn Gwin's Transcript of Bob Sigmon's Version from \"History of Kanawha County\" by Geo. W. Atkinson\n\nThe first settler on Coal river was Lewis Tackett, who built a fort on the Kanawha River one half mile below the mouth of Coal River. This blockhouse and a small one at the mouth of Elk River were the only forts between Donally's at Lewisburg in Greenbrier Co., VA (now WV) and Point Pleasant. Point Pleasant was the extreme western frontier at that time.\n\nLewis Tackett was a hardy frontiersman who \"saved his hair\" in numerous encounters with Indians. In 1787, Lewis and two others went down the Kanawha Valley hunting for game. They had not gone far when they were attacked by seven savages. The other two men ran toward Fort Tackett and escaped. Lewis ran in the other direction and was captured. The Indians decided to take him to their village on the Scioto River for torturing and execution. Since he was well known, there was no hop that he would be kept as a captive.\n\nHis hand were bound with buckskin thongs, and he was led away. After a few miles, the Indians decided to backtrack toward the fort. They tied Lewis to a large pine on the point at Nob Shoals, a short distance above Buffalo, and left him. He tried to chew through the thongs and to break them, but couldn't. After a few hours, a heavy rainstorm came up. The water stretched the buckskin, and he escaped.\n\nFrom that time, the tree was called \"Tackett's Pine.\" It was a landmark used by riverboat pilots steering through the chute at Nobs Shoals until the tree blew down in 1872.\n\nIn 1788, Lewis' daughter Keziah delivered her first child, a boy named Jacob. He was the first white born in the Kanawha Valley. On the day Jacob was born, Lewis' family and one or two others were preparing their evening meal of corn pounded into bread, when suddenly their cow began bellowing. Running to where the cow was tied several hundred yards from the fort, they found her calf dead. It had been killed by Indians. They quickly returned to the fort.\n\nLewis' son-in-law, John Young, took his wife and her newborn infant across the Kanawha River in a canoe. The river was about a hundred yards wide at that time. When they reached the other side, John saw Fort Tackett in flames. John pushed his canoe twelve miles up river to the fort at Elk River.\n\nLewis Tackett escaped, but most of the other members of the fort were either killed or taken prisoner. His wife Mary never returned from captivity. Two children, ages eight and six, were kept by the Indians a long time. One of them was brought back to her home after being lost by a marauding band of Cherokees. She had forgotten how to speak English and kept trying to get back to her barbaric friends.\n\nEntry in Kanawha County Records Feb. 6, 1792 \"ordered that the Clerk of this county do advertise letting the building of a prison in said county agreeable to a plan to be then produced, which will be on the fist day of March Court, to be held for this county. Ordered, that the bounds of said prison (which is to be built on the front of the lot between John Young's and Lewis Tackett's) be extended so as to include the garrison and house where John Clendenin now lives, for the safety of the prisoners from the hostile invasion of the Indian enemy.\"\n\nIt is generally understood that Lewis Tackett was the contractor and builder.\n\nJohn Young Family\n\npage Y2\n\n25.01?--James Strothers Young, b. 1 Aug 1866 in Mill Creek, WV to Strauthers Young; d. unk.; bd. unk.; m.

Her parents were John Hayes and Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Naylor. After John's death in 1836, Betsy married George Young. That is why Elizabeth and William were married at the home of George Young. This was her mother and stepfather's home. After George died, Elizabeth's mother went on to marry a third time to Samuel Estep.
