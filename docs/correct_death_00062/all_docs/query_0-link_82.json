Gwin, Aug 2011\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Clearly much work went into the original researching of this data, and for that I am very grateful! My former sister-in-law, Vonda Kay Sigmon [Mitchell] Gwin, told me that her brother, Robert Sigmon (RESigmon@fuse.net), did some of the original research, and it was she who gave my mother, Dorothy Lee Keeney Gwin , a copy of his book. When mother died in 2005, I inherited this copy. The book's first page does indeed list as co-authors \"Kenneth Cavender, who 'dug up' most of the enclosed names and dates\" and \"Robert Sigmon, who dug up some names and performed all manual chores,\" and also states, \"Made for Vonda Mitchell, January 1977, so she would know her roots--Love, Bob Sigmon\". When I decided to transcribe Bob's material to this page, however, I saw that the format of the original only used varying degrees of indentation to distinguish generations; no numbers or other characters were used. To facilitate reading, then, I have here attempted to continue using those indentations but adding numbers as well, the pre-decimal number indicating the generation, the post-decimal number indicating the birth order within the family. In at least one place, I was not able to read the indentations correctly, those indentations seeming to vary from one page to another, making it nearly impossible to interpret to which generation a given entry might belong. I attempted but failed to contact Vonda's brother to correct my error(s). For years, then, I caused those parts in question to flash on and off as a caution to the reader. However, on 5 Mar 2009 I received an email from Cousin Jackie Sue Young who shared the lot of data listed below in this green; it helped to clarify those indentation problems in the area of that flashing information, especially since it highlighted for me and seemed to confirm a comment received earlier from Cousin Olive Basham that there were NINETEEN children of Harvey Hudson Hamilton Young and Olive Mae Buckley.\n\nOther contributors include Cousins Mae Van Dinter, Norma Smith Frank, Vicki Hess, Beckie (last name unk.), Mary (last name unk.), Beverly Goding, Eileen Dahmen, John Robert Corey, and Tiffany Farnsworth Nash , as listed below.\n\nCousin Tom Young contacted me in Jun 2007 and has contributed more material, also listed below. His own excellent page is online at: http://www.tomyoung.us/html/ancestors.html .\n\nCousin Barbara Emerson Sharp checked in in June 2009, joining Jackie Sue Young as a descendant of 22.00--Conrad Young. Her contributions are found in the gold box below as expanded by my additions of pertinent census data. Click here for an interesting relationship chart for Barbara and Jackie Sue Young!\n\nIn addition, I own, have read, and highly recommend to all a very readable, most enjoyable, and very well documented 94-page book, John Young: Lieutenant at Elk by Orton Jones, Mountain State Press, Charleston, WV, 1994 (ISBN: 0-941092-31-3). Some of the entries in red below are to indicate the above-named contributors.\n\nIn early 2009, I decided to add twenty to the numbers of the generations. For example, my own generation, number 8, became 28. I hope that in so doing I have allowed for the future expansion of the genealogy and not confused the readers. Should we ever in the future get back 28 generations, all we'll have to do is add a one to the front of the 28, making it 128\n\n\n\nAn Outline of the Reported and/or Known Family\n\n\n\n\n\n21.00-- Methias/Mathias Young , b. 1711 in Palatiante, Germany; d. 19 Jul 1749 in Lancaster, PA; m.

She said it was taken from History of Charleston and Kanawha County West Virginia and Representative Citizens, W. S. Laidley, Richmond Arnold Publishing Co., Chicago, 1911.]\n\nPeter Young Peter Young, grocery merchant at Charleston, W.Va., and one of the representative business men of the city, was born in what is now Union District, Kanawha County, W.Va., April 2, 1843, and is a son of Rev. Robert Young and a grandson of Mathias Young. Rev. Robert Young was born in Greenbrier County, Va., April 11, 1816, and died at Charleston, November 19, 1892. He was a son of Mathias Young, who was of German parentage, but was reared in Greenbrier County, what is now Fayette County, Va. He there married a Miss Hickman, and later moved into what is now Roane County, W. Va., where his wife died at the birth of their youngest child, who is Rev. Henry Young, the only survivor of a family of seven sons and six daughters. All of the thirteen children married, and all but one daughter had children, the family being a prolific and vigorous one, although the mother died when about forty-three years of age. At a later date Mathias Young moved to Kanawha County, settling in Union District and was there married to Maria Tate, who survived him and married again, dying at the age of sixty-five years. Mathias Young was fifty-seven years old at the time of his death and had four children born to his second marriage. He was a Whig in politics, and his business life was entirely agricultural. Robert Young was the fifth in order of birth in the family of thirteen children. He became the owner of 700 acres of excellent farm land and for twenty-five years was interested with his son in the grocery trade at Charleston, being a silent partner. At the age of thirty-five years he became a Baptist minister and continued in unity with that religious body during the remainder of a long and eminently useful life. He married Anna Wallace, a daughter of Alexander Wallace, Esq., the latter of whom was a justice of the peace for sixteen years in what is now Poca District, Kanawha County, and was very prominent in other ways. He laid out one of the first roads in Kanawha County and for years was foreman for the Ruffner's early gardeners in the Kanawha Valley. Mrs. Young was born April 23, 1823, and she still survives, retaining all of her faculties. Her memory is quite remarkable. She is a devoted member of the Baptist church and has always been beloved and esteemed for her womanly virtues. To Rev. Robert Young and wife ten children were born, three sons and seven daughters, all of whom married and nine of whom survive. Mrs. Young resides with her widowed daughter, Mrs. Mary Duley, No. 242 Kanawha Street, Charleston. Peter Young was the eldest born of his parents' family, and he remained on the home farm until 1867, when he came to Charleston and in association with his father opened a grocery store at No. 247 Kanawha Street, he being the active member of the firm. The business was continued at the above stand until 1905, when removal was made to the present commodious brick building at No. 233 Virginia Street, where a large stock of staple and fancy groceries is carried. Mr. Young was married in Union District, Kanawha County, W. Va., to Miss Lorena Casdorph, who was born there March 14, 1846, a daughter of Ezariah and Mary Casdorph, natives of Kanawha and Monroe County respectively. Both of them died in Union District, the father at the age of eighty-four years and the mother aged sixty-seven years. They had thirteen children, all married but one and all deceased but two. One brother of Mrs. Young, William Harrison Casdorph, who was a private in the Federal Army serving as a faithful soldier in the 7th W. Va. Cav., was captured by the Confederates in the Lynchburg, Va., raid, and died in Libby Prison. Mr. and Mrs. Young have had eight children: Anna Laura , who married Henry Cohers and died at the age of thirty-two years; David , who resides at home; Walter , who is associated with his father, married Anna Smith, and they have one son, Lawrence; Alvin , who is associated with his brothers in operating a laundry; Minnie , who is the wife of Mordicai Wallace, a druggist at Ft. Worth, Tex. and has two children; Clarence, who is in the laundry business at Charleston, and is also money-order clerk in the post-office; and Cora and Charle s .

Gwin <jmcdgwin@zianet.com>\n\nSubject: The Jung Family of Elk River WV\n\n\n\nConrad Jung was born in Pennsylvania to newly arrived Mathias Jung and his wife Anna Margaretta Fey 1732. Mathias was one of the founding fathers of Lancaster, PA, and he died young at the age of 38 in the year 1749. Conrad was the oldest of several children, and he was married to Anna Margaretta Franciscus in the year 1755. They had one son named John, later to be known as Capt. John Young of Elk River near Charleston WV.\n\nConrad's wife Anna Margaretta was struck and killed by lightning when John was four. Conrad left Pennsylvania for the Shenandoah Valley with his son. Conrad married again and that wife was drowned in either the flooded Shenandoah or Potomac River. They had four children in addition to John. The family then went to Nicholas Co., VA, and Conrad married again to Elizabeth Wood. They had two sons: William, b. 1785, and my own ancestor, George E. Young , b. 1788.\n\nWilliam married May Lilly , and George married Eudoshia Huddleston of Quaker background. Two books of these families are John Young, Lieutenant at Elk and every Roane (as in Rhone Germany, yes?) Co. book you can find. The towns to visit are Clendenin, WV and Elkview, WV, and both have very good family history centers. The websites cannot keep up with all the histories you'll find by searching elsewhere.\n\nWilliam Young's death is documented in WV that (1) he died on Elk Two Mile and (2) his parents were Conrad and Elizabeth Young. He was the last of their children to die, and he died in Kanawha Co., WV. His brother, George, died about 1857. This was Indian country and some were Indian fighters, especially Conrad and his two oldest sons, John and Charles. A fascinating history. Many old gravesites are along the Elk River through Kanawha and Roane Counties. The Moravian church at Lancaster, PA has some history on Conrad and his family from Germany in the early 1700's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ John M.

Keziah had a little girl from her first marrieage who was captured by the Indians when Tackett's Fort was taken in 1788. The Townsend girl was separated from the rest of the prisoners during the Indians' escape and was never seen again. She may have been adopted by an Indian family or killed to speed up the escape.\n\n\n\nJohn Young was a Captain of Indian scouts and used to go out on long trips that would take several months. Keziah would often tell stories in her old age of how she sometimes had to eat weeds or greens boiled without meat while John was gone so long.\n\n\n\nThere is one story John Young used to tell with deep feeling in his old age. The Indians had killed and scalped the two little girls of Henry Morris. Shortly afterwards, John, some of the Morris family, and Fleming Cobb found Indian signs on Len's Creek. They followed the signs to the mouth of Indian Creek, a small branch of Coal River that takes its name from this incident. There they saw the Indians swimming across Coal River.\n\n\n\nOne of the Morrises fired his rifle and hit the last Indian. Too hurt to swim farther, the Indian turned back and appealed to John Young to save him. Morris paid no attention and killed the Indian with a tomahawk.\n\n\n\nWhen telling the story, John would sigh and say, \"The poor fellow lifted his arms to me for protection and said 'brother', and I didn't say one word of protest that might have caused Morris to hesitate.\"\n\n\n\nMorris afterwards said, \"I couldn't trust his parole, and my wife didn't tell me to bring home a pet Indian to play tomahawk with my children like they did with Brother Henry's.\"\n\n\n\nHenry Morris' other daughter, Sarah, married Charles Young, son of Conrad Young and Margaret Hayes. Charles and Sarah's son, John Young, married his first cousin, Margaret Young, a daughter of John and Keziah.\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis Tackett\n\nJohn Gwin's Transcript of Bob Sigmon's Version from \"History of Kanawha County\" by Geo. W. Atkinson\n\n\n\nThe first settler on Coal river was Lewis Tackett, who built a fort on the Kanawha River one half mile below the mouth of Coal River. This blockhouse and a small one at the mouth of Elk River were the only forts between Donally's at Lewisburg in Greenbrier Co., VA (now WV) and Point Pleasant. Point Pleasant was the extreme western frontier at that time.\n\n\n\nLewis Tackett was a hardy frontiersman who \"saved his hair\" in numerous encounters with Indians. In 1787, Lewis and two others went down the Kanawha Valley hunting for game. They had not gone far when they were attacked by seven savages. The other two men ran toward Fort Tackett and escaped. Lewis ran in the other direction and was captured. The Indians decided to take him to their village on the Scioto River for torturing and execution. Since he was well known, there was no hop that he would be kept as a captive.\n\n\n\nHis hand were bound with buckskin thongs, and he was led away. After a few miles, the Indians decided to backtrack toward the fort. They tied Lewis to a large pine on the point at Nob Shoals, a short distance above Buffalo, and left him. He tried to chew through the thongs and to break them, but couldn't. After a few hours, a heavy rainstorm came up. The water stretched the buckskin, and he escaped.\n\n\n\nFrom that time, the tree was called \"Tackett's Pine.\" It was a landmark used by riverboat pilots steering through the chute at Nobs Shoals until the tree blew down in 1872.\n\n\n\nIn 1788, Lewis' daughter Keziah delivered her first child, a boy named Jacob. He was the first white born in the Kanawha Valley. On the day Jacob was born, Lewis' family and one or two others were preparing their evening meal of corn pounded into bread, when suddenly their cow began bellowing. Running to where the cow was tied several hundred yards from the fort, they found her calf dead. It had been killed by Indians. They quickly returned to the fort.\n\n\n\nLewis' son-in-law, John Young, took his wife and her newborn infant across the Kanawha River in a canoe. The river was about a hundred yards wide at that time. When they reached the other side, John saw Fort Tackett in flames. John pushed his canoe twelve miles up river to the fort at Elk River.\n\n\n\nLewis Tackett escaped, but most of the other members of the fort were either killed or taken prisoner. His wife Mary never returned from captivity. Two children, ages eight and six, were kept by the Indians a long time. One of them was brought back to her home after being lost by a marauding band of Cherokees. She had forgotten how to speak English and kept trying to get back to her barbaric friends.\n\n\n\nEntry in Kanawha County Records Feb. 6, 1792 \"ordered that the Clerk of this county do advertise letting the building of a prison in said county agreeable to a plan to be then produced, which will be on the fist day of March Court, to be held for this county.

First of all, I'm a descendant of Conrad Young. From me, through my father and up to them, it went like this:\n\n\n\n29.00-- Brett Alan Young, 28.00-- Donly S. Young Jr., 27.00-- Donly S.

Gwin Note--9 Mar 2020 :\n\nI have taken this opportunity to add my own generational numbering system to Brent's line, above. By way of explanation, I simply got tired of having to change my generation number in each line. It was confusing at best, and it was very difficult for me to figure out just how I was related to folks in other lines. So I arbitrarily picked a number for myself that would always be the same in my every line. It would be high enough that I'd never reach it in my lifetime of research. So I chose generation 28 to be mine. That would make my parents' generation always number 27, my children's generation always number 29, and so forth.\n\nNow I'll present my own line here to parallel Brett's. If you compare both lines, you see that both are the same in the earliest three generations: 21, 22, and 23. But in generation 24, Brett descends from John's son Jacob, and I descend from Jacob's brother, Conrad. So our respective generations 25 are first cousins to each other; 26 are second cousins, 27 are thirds, and 28 are fourths. So I am fourth cousin to Donly S. Young, Jr., and Brett and I are fourth cousins once removed to each other.\n\nBy the way, if the technology is ever discovered or invented that allows me to learn who my ancesters are at generation one in any line, all I (or whoever takes over after I die) will have to do is simply add a one to the front of everyone's generation number, making mine and Donly Jr.'s #128, Brett's and my own three kids' #129, and so forth.\n\n\n\n21.00-- Matheus Jung\n\n22.00-- Conrad Young\n\n23.00-- John Young ,\n\n24.00--\n\n25.06-- Frances \"Fannie\" (Young) Stanley ,\n\n26.04-- Mamie Chloe (Stanley) Keene y ,\n\n27.03-- Dorothy Lee (Keeney) Gwin ,\n\n28.01-- John M. Gwin ,\n\n\n\nBRETT CONTINUES: If you're still working on this genealogy, here's an alternative for you. Conrad Young had three wives. The first was Anna Margaret Franciscus. They had two sons prior to John Young. Both died at birth. One was named Johannes Jung and the the other Johan Jung. Then they had John Young in August 1760. John was actually named Johannes. In July of 1764 Anna was rocking John when lightning came down the chimney and killed Anna, but leaving John alone.\n\n\n\nConrad's second wife was Margaret Hayes. She died crossing a river. The story I found said that Conrad was riding his horse with a baby in his arms when Margaret fell from her horse into the river. Conrad rode back to the river bank, put the baby down and went to try to save his wife, but she had already died.\n\n\n\nI believe (but have no documentation) that the baby was Mathias Young. The baby was the son of Conrad and Margaret Hayes.\n\n\n\nThe third wife was Elizabeth Woods. Their first child was Elizabeth Young who later married Thomas Smythe in Botetourt Co. It's hard to pin down her birth date because the calendar was changed when she was born, but I believe it to be 1770 or 1772.\n\n\n\nThere was a man that I met named Henry Young. He'd done a lot of research over the years. He lived in Clendenin, WV. He had Margaret and Anna Margaretta switched as Conrad's wives. He was a treasure trough of information for me back in the early 90's. Unfortunately, he died a few years after we met, and I could no longer pick his brain about the family.\n\n\n\nMy dad got in touch with the Moravian Church in Pennsylvania, and that's where we got a tremendous amount of information, including the information above. I cannot state that my information is more accurate than yours, but wanted to open up another scenario for you based on my, my dad's, and the Moravian Church's research.\n\n\n\nThank you for your time, and I hope that some of this opens another door of possibilities for you.

Gwin Note--9 Mar 2020 : Cousin Tiffany Nash sent me the following.] The following is a partial transcript from \"The Young Family, Kanawha Pioneers\" published in 1912. It's from an address by Harvey Humphreys Young, Dana, W. Va., delivered at the Second Annual Reunion of the Young Family, at Pinchville, August 19, 1911.\n\n\n\n\"About 1769, Conrad Young came across the water from Germany with his wife and child, and landed at Norfolk, Va. They started inland on horseback. While crossing the Appomattox River, the horse the wife was riding stumbled and fell, throwing her into the river. Before the husband could take the child to shore and return to the rescue of his wife, she was drowned. Conrad and his child were thus left in a strange land infested with wild beasts and wild Indians. The child, whose name was John, grew to manhood, was commissioned by the government of Virginia as a Captain of Indian Scouts or Spies, and has been known as Capt. John Young, the Indian Spy.\n\n\"Conrad in time married a second wife to whom was born a son named Charles. While the mother of Charles was sitting before an open fire place in their log cabin, a violent storm arose, and a bolt of lightning struck the chimney, killing her instantly. \"Conrad married the third time, and to this union were born two sons, William and George. \"These four sons of Conrad Young, John, Charles, William and George, were all born in the latter part of the eighteenth century, all settled in this section of the country in early life, and are the ancestors of our old and numerous family. The children of these four brothers are printed in Capitals. It will be noted John was the father of eleven children, Charles of five, William of six, and George of six.\"\n\n23.01-- a son , b. to Conrad and Anna ; d. in infancy;\n\n23.02-- John Young , b.

B. Mathews as delivered at the First Annual Reunion of the Young Family at Mt. Tabor Church, August 20, 1910.\n\n\"...The earliest permanent settlers of this region were the Youngs, the Clendenins, the Tacketts, the Aarons, and the Morrises.\n\n\"Lewis Tackett and family settled at the mouth of Coal River at the present site of St. Albans and built Tackett's Fort about 1787. John Young and his brothers came here about the same time and were famous trappers and Indian scouts. John married the widow Townsend, who had been Keziah Tackett, a sister of the famous Indian fighter, Lewis Tackett, and not a daughter as previously stated. Into this home of the wilderness, about 1783 or 1790, the first child of the first settlers was born. \"Therefore, the first youngster of Kanawha was a Young, Jacob Young, and while he was born in the eighteenth century and we are now in the twentieth, yet this son's son is alive today and issued the call for this meeting. This first youngster has well been called the child of the storm.\n\n\"However much of this story may be tradition, it is well authenticated that Tackett's Fort was suddenly surprised by the Indians, that the courageous John Young seized his wife and their first born, only a few hours old, rushed out of the fort and into the darkness and a storm, reached the river, placed his precious burden in a canoe, and pushed off amid a volley of bullets and arrows. He soon escaped from the view of the savages as he poled his canoe toward Clendenin's Fort, twelve miles distant, where Charleston is located. Strange to say, none of the little family suffered either from the shots of the enemy or from the exposure and anxiety of that awful night. As our patron hero looked back in his frantic but successful effort to escape, he could see the flames of the fort where nearly all who remained were killed or captured.\n\n\"These facts have been narrated by Mrs. Mary Patton Hudson of Cincinnati and the late John Slack, Sr., who long resided in this county. They might well be preserved in poetic story--as soon as the family produces a poet laureate!\n\n\"John Young, the father, was named as one of the trustees in the first charter of Charleston, passed by the legislature of Virginia December 19, 1794. He was commissioned captain [sic] of scouts and was a hardy pioneer with just the fortitude necessary to subdue the primitive wilderness with its fierce savages and wild beasts.\n\n\"Jacob Young, the first child, lived a long and useful life and died in Putnam County about the year 1875. He, like his numerous brothers and their descendants, was noted for his industrious habits, patriotic devotion and religious fervor.\n\n\"If, on that perilous night, the red men had killed that first youngster and his parents, what would have become of you?!\"\n\n[ John Gwin Note : I own, have read, and highly recommend to all a most enjoyable and very well documented 94-page book, John Young: Lieutenant at Elk by Orton Jones, Mountain State Press, Charleston, WV, 1994 (ISBN: 0-941092-31-3).

Gwin Note--11 Mar 2020 : I took the following obituary from Ginnie's FindAGrave memorial:]\n\n\n\nGenevieve (Ginnie) Young Payne went to be with her Lord and Savior on January 2, 2016. She was surrounded by her family as she went peacefully into her heavenly home.\n\nGinnie was born to Lucy and Chilton Young in Charleston, West Virginia on August 5, 1920 and was the middle child of their three. She was preceded in death by her sister Virginia Gordon and her brother Chilton (Corky) Young. She is survived by her husband of 63 years Ralph William Payne; and their son Greg Payne, his wife Darcy, and their children Seth, Anna, and Rachel Payne.\n\nGinnie loved the outdoors and spent as much time as she could tending her garden and working in her yard. She loved animals and rescued many endangered turtles in her lifetime. She had a servant�s heart and served her family, neighbors, friends and community in any way she could. She found great joy in being a mother and a grandmother.\n\nShe loved to cook and especially enjoyed spending time baking. Her love of baking gave her ample opportunities to provide for anyone in need of cakes, cookies or cupcakes for an event, and she cheerfully offered her chocolate chip cookies to everyone who entered her home. Ginnie worked tirelessly for many years helping all the baseball teams at the Myrtle Grove Community Club doing any job needed. She was a faithful, longtime member of Fairfield Presbyterian Church and has been very blessed to be part of such a loving and compassionate congregation. Our family is very grateful to the staff at Broadview Assisted Living and to everyone at Covenant Hospice who cared for her. All of you showed her great respect and compassion during the times you cared for her and for us as a family.\n\nA celebration of Ginnie�s life will be held Friday, January 8, at Pensacola Memorial Gardens Funeral Home. Please join us from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. for visitation, followed by a service at 2:00 p.m. led by her Pastor Ralph LaGuardia. In lieu of flowers our family asks that donations be made to the American Cancer Society.\n\n7 Jan 2016\n\n28.01-- Greg Payne , facebook; [PRIVATE] ; m.

(Ruth, 6th-born)\n\n\n\nIn the 14 Apr 1930 census of this same district, they appear like this:\n\n\n\nHarvey H ..............47...\n\nOlive M ................37...\n\nNancy J .........18...#2\n\nHarvey S .......16...#3\n\nMaury W . .....15...#4\n\nJasper H . ......12...#5\n\nRuth A . ..........11...#6\n\nClarance A . ....9 ...#7\n\nDoras L . ..........6...#8\n\nOliver M . ........4...#9\n\nLola J . .............2...#10\n\nHoy M . ............1...#11\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very clear that all these records are talking of the same family. As we compare Bob's and Jackie's accounts side by side, each gives clarification of the ambiguities of the other.\n\n\n\nFor example, Bob Sigmond does not reveal the last names of the children, leaving it to the reader to figure out from the parents' last names, etc.\n\n\n\nI had thus assumed that Ralph Dale's last name was Lanham, he being the second child of Sandra Kay and Franklin Lanham. But seeing Jackie Sue Young's list of the children of Cora and Simon Jones beside Bob's list suddenly made me realize that Ralph, Janey, Margaret, Richard, Mary, and Eloise were Joneses, not Lanhams, and belonged in generation 28, not 30!\n\n\n\nRalph and Ralph must be the same person, and Bob's list tells us his middle name, Dale.\n\nJanet Mae and Janette must be the same person.\n\nRichard Amon and Richard must be the same person.\n\nEloise Sue and Sue must be the same person.\n\nAnd Mary Elizabeth and Mary must be the same.\n\n\n\nThat leaves us with Bob's Margaret Ann and Jackie's Samona and Francis unaccounted for.\n\n\n\nPerhaps looking for this family in the census records will throw additional light onto the mystery.\n\n\n\nFrom Bob's and Jackie's reports, we had no idea as to the correct birth order of generation 27 with the exceptions of Cora and Zada who are first and last, respectively.\n\n\n\nSo we looked up the Harvey H. Young family in the census records for 1920 and 1930 and got a fairly decent picture of the birth order through son Hoy, the eleventh born.\n\n\n\nBut for the 12th-born through the 18th-born children, there is no clue so far; therefore, I have arbitrarily assigned each of the remaining seven children to one of those as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.02--Nancy Young, b. ca. 1912; m.

Using Jackie's data, I have reorganized Bob Sigmon's report on this family and arranged it as I now believe he intended it to be understood. With the exceptions of Jackie's notes that Cora Young Jones was the oldest and Zada Young Fernatt was the youngest of the 19, the birth order was still unclear, however, until I found this family in both the 1920 and 1930 censuses, which gave us the birth order through the eleventh-born child. I arbitrarily selected the birth order numbers for the 12th through 18th children only for the temporary purpose of facility in reference. I have attempted to put Jackie's somewhat extensive (and most welcome!) information into my outline format in the chart above.
