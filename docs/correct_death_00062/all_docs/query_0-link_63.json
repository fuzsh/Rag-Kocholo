CALLAHAN was a well known Texas Ranger of his day. He was born Sept. 10, 1814 near Marion, GA. In Dec. of 1835 he went to Texas as part of Captain James C. WINN's Company of Georgia Battalian. On April 7, 1856, James became angered over some comments made by a neighbor, Woodson BLASSENGAME and an altercation occurred. A shootout ensued and James CALLAHAN and two friends, William S. \"Maulheel\" JOHNSON and Eli HINDS were shot. CALLAHAN and JOHNSON were killed. Woodson BLASSENGAME and his wife Mary and a son Calvin were taken into custody and were held at the residence of the Justice of the Peace since there was no jail. On April 14, 1856 a large mob overtook the BLASSENGAME's and Woodson and Calvin were taken out and shot repeatedly. Mary made her escape into nearby woods. Eventually at least 22 people were indicted for the murders of Woodson and Calvin BLASSENGAME.\n\nIn September of 1856, shortly after the death of James CALLAHAN, Sarah, James' widow died from all the stress. Sarah had just lost a child in death just 6 months prior to James' death. Court records indicate that the 5 surviving children were placed in the custody of a family friend William E. JONES of Comal County, Texas. Soon a sister of James CALLAHAN that was residing in Walker County, GA indicated that she wished to raise the two girls \"known as Kate and Carrie\". The court approved and the girls were sent back to Georgia to be raised by their aunt. The three boys remained in Texas. Court records do not give a name for the aunt.\n\nI am researching this entire event as many of the principles involved were related to my own family. My Great-great-grandfather John M. WATSON took the Blassengame family into custody after the initial shootout. I would like to make contact with anyone related to these families and especially would like to know of any stories that made it down the family to today. I also have a great deal of this history that I would be willing to share as well.\n\nDon Watson\n\n\n\nWARD\n\nI called the US Military Academy Archives and got the following information for Captain James Noble WARD, Class of 1845:\n\nFather: Charles WARD\n\nMother: not available (but will obtain if necessary)\n\nBorn 1823 Kentucky, Killed 6 Dec 1858 New Mexico Territory\n\nMailing address: Kichafoona P.O., Marion County, Georgia\n\nDoes anyone recognize Charles WARD as the father of James WARD?\n\nTim\n\n\n\nKINSEY\n\nAm trying to find out anything on Martin KINSEY he had a son born Elijah Zachariah KINSEY in March 06, 1850 Marion County (may be spelled KUNTZI or KINSE)\n\nArlene\n\n\n\nBLUE / PEEPLES\n\nMy grandfather was born in Marion County in 1907. His name was Jack Bosman BLUE. I have been told his mother, Mary (BLUE or PEEPLES), and father (Isaac BLUE or PEEPLES) were not married. He was older, married and some sort of politician. I think his name could have been spelled Jack Bozeman Blue instead of Jack Bosman Blue. I also think it is a possibity that Bozman is a family surname. I have got a genetic disease and would like to find anything I can about my ancestors. His mother had 2 other children, Martha and Mamie.

COTTEN b.c. 1809, both GA (per census) were brother and sister. \"Jack\" was a \"doctor\" who married Sarah Williams REID in 1838 (not known where) and they are first found in Marion Co., GA in 1840. This is my line. They had 13 children, only 6 of whom lived to adulthood. I have a picture/collage of this couple with their adult children and several of the kids are very ethnic in appearance; broad noses, deep-set eyes, dark and curly (almost oily) hair, dark and very tanned complexion. This deep, darkness carries down even today. Jack Cotten lived a long while in Powder Springs, GA where he practiced medicine. This family owned slaves and were listed as \"white\" on censuses. He died in 1875 in Cobb Co., Acworth, GA. Julie A. Cotten m. 1830 in Upson Co., GA to Thomas Franklin BETHEL, who was from Charleston, SC. They had two little girls named TURNBULL living with them in 1850. Julia died in Upson Co. in the 1890's. I don't believe they had children. I have no pictures of this couple.\n\nI know that Marion Co. and its surrounding area was originally Creek Indian land in the 1830's. I can find no parents for these siblings nor any other information about them. It has been suggested that perhaps they were \"passing\" for white. I would really like to show my pictures to someone who knows ethnicity and see what they think I'm dealing with. I'm open to these people being mulatto (black) also.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated!\n\nJulie O'Neil Perkins\n\nCoweta Co., GA\n\n\n\nPARKER / MAYO\n\nI am seeking information on one Permelia PARKER who marr.
