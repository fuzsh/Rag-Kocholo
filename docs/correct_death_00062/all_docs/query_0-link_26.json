        "text": "Women's History Resource Guide\n\nIntroduction\n\nThroughout American history, the intersectionality of gender, class, and race has constructed women's lived experiences. This resource guide highlights the Pennsylvania State Archives' holdings pertaining to women's unique experiences throughout the state's rich history. The guide was created with the hopes of making women's history resources readily accessible to researchers at the Pennsylvania State Archives.\n\nItems for the guide were carefully selected from the holdings of the Archives in order to create an inclusive representation of women's experiences throughout both Pennsylvania and United States History. Such items include government produced record groups, manuscript groups, and photographs housed at the Archives. Moreover, holdings pertaining to women or various ethnic, racial, and class backgrounds were included in order to create a more inclusive history. However, not all items produced by or pertaining to women were included in this guide. As such, researchers may need to consult other finding aids and resource guides at the Pennsylvania State Archives in order to further their research.\n\nThe guide is organized according to record group (RG) or manuscript group (MG) number. Record groups are further arranged according to series number. As manuscript groups do not include series numbers, key items pertaining to women's history are listed. Researchers are encouraged to consult finding aids found in the research room for further information on the holdings of manuscript groups.\n\nFurthermore, three indexes are included with the women's history resource guide. The first is a general index in the front of the guide. This index lists every record group, series number, and manuscript group throughout the guide. At the end of the guide, record group and manuscript group indexes are included. These indexes are organized alphabetically by subject. Subjects were chosen based on common themes found amongst the holdings. Lastly, a brief bibliography of U.S. and Pennsylvanian women's history sources are included to help patrons further their research.\n\nShould researchers have any further questions, please consult an archivist at the PA State Archives.\n\nCaroline E.

A State Board of Agriculture, having been established in 1876 to investigate subjects relating to improvements in agriculture, continued to function alongside the Department in an advisory capacity. Legislation passed in 1919 and 1923 abolished the State Board of Agriculture, the Agricultural Commission and the Livestock Sanitary Board, thereby consolidating regulatory activities pertaining to agriculture within the Department. Functions relating to forestry had been transferred to the Department of Forestry in 1901. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for promoting the efficient marketing of farm products and for dealing with appropriate investigator and service problems. The Department acts to stem the deleterious effects of animal and plant disease as well as the spread of insect pests. In addition, the government body implements measures in order to safeguard the public against impure or misrepresented foods, fertilizers and pesticides. The State Farm Products Show Commission and the State Harness Racing Commission serve as administrative commissions within the Department of Agriculture.\n\nGlass Lantern Slides of Pennsylvania Market Houses, 1920. {#1.9}\n\nThe file consists of lantern slides of interior and exterior views of public markets in Pennsylvania, [ca. 1920]. Slides include images of African American and white women at market.\n\nRecord Group 2\n\nDepartment of the Auditor General\n\nThe Office of the Auditor General formed in 1809 in order to replace and assume many of the duties previously held by the offices of the Comptroller General and the Register General. The offices of the Comptroller General and the Register Genera had originally formed in order to liquidate claims against the state for services performed during the Revolutionary War and to assist in the final settlement of public accounts. In 1821, the Office of the Escheator General the US government dismantled the position's prior duties relating to the estates of individuals dying intestate without heirs or kindred, then fell under the purview of the Auditor General.\n\nBy 1859, the Auditor General had gained recognition as an elective office. The Fiscal Code of 1929 transferred the function of collecting taxes from the Department of the Auditor General to the newly created Department of Revenue. Under the Code, the Department developed into a true auditing agency.\n\nAs the chief auditor of the state's fiscal affairs, the Auditor General is responsible for insuring that the Commonwealth receives all moneys to which it is entitled and that public money is spent legally and properly. The Auditor General adjusts claims against the Commonwealth, examines tax settlements made by the Revenue Department, and oversees the examination of practically every financial transaction involving the state.\n\nIndex to Churches and Beneficial Societies, 1831. {Series #2.16}\n\nArranged alphabetically by name of church or beneficial society. An index created in 1831 that lists the names of all the churches, seminaries, and beneficial societies then active in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . This series includes various women's societies, seminaries, and other organizations.\n\nRecord Group 7\n\nRecords of the General Assembly\n\nDigitized\n\nLegislative power is vested in a General Assembly, which consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate. The General Assembly has the authority to enact laws, appropriate funds and levy taxes. Additional powers of the legislature include the proposal of constitutional amendments, the impeachment of public officials, the maintenance of investigatory authority, and the confirmation of certain executive appointments. The first State General Assembly was a unicameral body established under the Constitution of 1776. The authors of the Constitution equipped the legislature with vast powers which enabled it to dominate the other two branches of state government. This imbalance was corrected with the adoption of subsequent constitutions, beginning with the Constitution of 1790. The 1970 document created a bicameral assembly and a popularly elected governor.

Requests from women are included.\n\nRecord Group 21\n\nRecords of Proprietary Government\n\nDigitized\n\nUnder the First Frame of Government drawn up by William Penn in 1682, the Provincial Council was to consist of seventy-two popularly elected members with the Governor presiding over the body and also having three votes. The Council was to govern in the absence of the Governor, appoint judges, create courts of justice, regulate trade with the Indians, and issue municipal regulations. The Council could also call and dismiss the Assembly at will and held the exclusive right to initiate legislation. The Assembly, on the other hand, possessed the right to approve or reject bills passed by the Provincial Council and to propose amendments. The Council was also to serve as the highest court of the Province.\n\nNumerous objections were raised to the implementation of the First Frame of Government and these were addressed in the Second Frame of Government, adopted in April, 1683. Under the Second Frame, the Provincial Council consisted of three members from each county with the total membership not being allowed to exceed seventy-two or fall below eighteen. The triple vote of the Governor provided for in the First Frame was abolished but he was now given veto power. The Governor could perform no public act \"except in the presence of the Council,\" and the Council retained control over the Assembly and legislation as stipulated in the First Frame of Government. When William Penn returned to England in 1684, he turned the government over to the Provincial Council and its president, Thomas Lloyd. William Penn subsequently grew dissatisfied with the performance of the Council and stripped it of its executive powers. In December 1686, he appointed a five-man commission. Dissatisfied once more, Penn heeded the advice of Thomas Lloyd and appointed John Blackwell Deputy Governor in July 1688. When Blackwell was removed two years later, the government returned to the hands of Provincial Council President Thomas Lloyd. Lloyd was appointed Deputy Governor of the Province in 1691. Benjamin Fletcher replaced Lloyd in April, 1693 after Penn lost the government of the colony. During Fletcher's tenure, the Council became an appointed rather than an elected body. Once he resumed authority in 1694, William Penn appointed William Markham as his Deputy Governor.\n\nMarkham found himself at odds with both the Council and the Assembly. Consequentially, Markham acted without the Council for an entire year. When Markham finally recalled the Council in September 1696, he decided to recognize the body as appointed rather than elected. Markham needed money for defense, but the Assembly denied the Deputy Governor. Markham eventually granted greater powers to the Assembly in exchange for their cooperation in what came to be known as \" Markham's Frame of Government.\" This frame took away some of the Council's powers, giving both the Council and Assembly the right to propose legislation. Both houses needed to consent in order for legislation to pass. Although the Governor in Council could still call the Assembly at any time, the right of adjournment passed to the Assembly.\n\nOn October 28, 1701 William Penn's new Charter of Privileges was adopted. It remained until the overthrow of the proprietary government in 1776. The Charter of Privileges contained no reference to the Council as a legislative body and, therefore, the Council was excluded by implication from the legislative process. Membership was appointive and tenure was at the Proprietor's pleasure. Consequently, the best known and most conservative inhabitants of the Province and of devoted friends of the Proprietor comprised the Council. In the Governor's absence, the Council could exercise all of his powers except those relating to legislation. Advice and consent of the Council was still necessary for the Governor to act on matters of government, but this restriction was no longer in force after 1763.\n\nAll of the Provincial Council records in the custody of the State Archives were microfilmed under the sponsorship of the National Historical Publications Commission and may be located by consulting the Guide to the Microfilm of the Records of the Provincial Council, 1682-1776, in the Pennsylvania State Archives by Donald H. Kent and Martha L. Simonetti (Harrisburg: 1966). Index information cards for each document that were filmed at the time give the title and description of the item, the endorsement of the Council, if any, and the place or places where the record has been published. For related types of materials on the Provincial Council see also the Logan Papers (Manuscript Group 379), Richard Peters Papers (Manuscript Group 498), Shippen Family Papers (Manuscript Group 595), Penn Manuscripts (Manuscript Group 485), Miscellaneous Collection (Manuscript 425), and Provincial Council Papers (Manuscript Group 1040) at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania located at 1300 Locust Street in Philadelphia. Rough minutes of the Provincial Council for the period May 15, 1693 to August 13, 1717 will be found in the collections of the American Philosophical Society and these were microfilmed as part of the Library of Congress and the University of North Carolina joint State Microfilm Records Project that was completed in 1950. Israel D. Rupp, writing under the pen name of \"A Gentleman of the Bar,\" published a book entitled Early History of Western Pennsylvania in 1849 that contains an appendix relating to Indian affairs in the Provincial period. This appendix contains transcripts of instructions of the Governor and Council to the delegates attending Indian conferences, journals containing minutes of conferences, messages from the Governor and Council to the Indians, and peace treaties.\n\nCommissioners of Indian Trade Accounts, 1758-1766. {Series #21.2}\n\nGrouped by fort or town and arranged thereunder chronologically by date of entry.

It replaced the Office of Superintendent of Common Schools, which had been created in 1857 to assume the duties relating to the administration of public schools originally lodged with the Secretary of the Commonwealth by the Free School Act of 1834. By 1876, the officials working under the Superintendent were commonly known as the Department of Public Instruction. The powers and duties of this Department greatly increased in 1923 when the State Library and Museum, the State Board of Censors, the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, the Pennsylvania Historical Commission, and the various State professional examining boards were made administrative units of Public Instruction.\n\nIn keeping with its responsibility for the administration the State's educational policies, the Department of Public Instruction supervised the public school system, distributed State subsidies to school districts, administered teachers' colleges and vocational-education programs, issued licenses for certain professions, and operated the State Library. Several administrative units were eventually separated from the Department. In 1945, the Historical Commission, the Museum and the State Archives were merged to form an independent agency, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. The State Board of Censors was abolished in 1956 once the act creating it was declared unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court. In 1963, the professional examining boards transferred to the jurisdiction of the Department of State. In 1969, the name of the Department of Public Instruction changed to the Department of Education.\n\nAnnual Reports of Private Secondary Schools, 1971-1972. {Series #22.8}\n\nAnnual reports relating to pupils, subjects, general data, and enrollment for private secondary schools, filed with the Department of Education for the period 1971-1972.
