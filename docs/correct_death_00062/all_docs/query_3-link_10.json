I live four blocks from this building, and have lived in the area my whole life. I was 15 when he died.\n\nMovies from Dick's novels if counted as a whole would make up the third highest grossing Science Fiction film franchise after Star Wars and Star Trek. PKD died here at 408 Civic Center Dr., Santa Ana, CA in unit #301 in March 1982, a few months after receiving a check for around $50k for the Blade Runner movie and buying the first new car he ever owned. He never made more than a few thousand a month from his novels and short stories. He used to bounce checks for food at the 7-11 on Grand. I took these pictures about two weeks ago. Back in 1982 this was a state of the art starter condo building.\n\nAttachments\n\n582559_4330637190810_381641733_n.jpg\n\n66459_4330637750824_930682182_n.jpg\n\n65814_4330635790775_1792282659_n.jpg\n\n529031_4330638070832_592969167_n.jpg\n\nExtollager\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 21, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n9,122\n\nFeb 10, 2013\n\n#2\n\nThank you -- much appreciated!

Very sad he wasnt more recognised while he was alive."
