        "text": "There’s normally at least a glimmer of hope in a Philip K. Dick story. Or some kind of escape, as illusory as it may be. I read Galactic Pot Healer recently and came away with a renewed sense of worth in my own creative efforts. It was a great little novel. They may not have raised the cathedral, but at least they came away with the idea that to make something new again is a worthwhile endeavour.\n\nAnd then I read A Maze of Death, which is by far the most nihilistic Philip K. Dick story I’ve read so far, and I’ve read the one where they leave Earth to try and colonise Mars, only to find out that human life started on Mars and we ruined that planet in the first instance, fleeing to Earth to start again.\n\nA Maze of Death features all the main… features you’d except from a PKD story. Working class characters try and escape their future poverty and end up making themselves even less free than before. Society is a mess and reality is more porous than ever. The details aren’t too important and mostly serve to set up the rest of the story.\n\nWhich, as it turns out, is a SF version of And Then There Were None. PKD cites some inspirations in his foreword, for example mentioning that he used the I Ching to decide the actions for some of his characters, but he doesn’t mention any kind of murder mystery at all, which is strange, because this story is straight up murder mystery. A bunch of strangers get invited to an uninhabited planet, get a few hours to start needling each other, and then get picked off one by one. It’s a classic setup and one that really suits PKD’s brand of paranoid fiction. I wish he’d written more like this. It’s got a great pace and a lot to chew on in the vein of the best Christie’s, and he doesn’t disappoint with the ending, which turns this novel into less of a whodunit and more of a wherewhatwhyhowdunnit.\n\nIf you don’t know the ending of this novel, turn away, because it’s great and you want to go in blind.\n\nIt turns out that it was all a simulation, and all the people on the island are in fact people trapped on a spacecraft with no way of getting home. They were trying to sim a way out of their jam, but in the end are just using the sim as an escapist tool to while away what remains of their lives. So far, so PKD. But the particular simulation detailed in this novel features a religion which brings them all much comfort. They awake from the sim to realise they made it all up, and the religion they came up with this time was just a comforting lie, except…\n\nI might have misread it so bear with me.\n\nOne of the characters, in the reality of the ship, comes across the Changer of Forms, the deity of the supposedly made up religion. Except here this deity is, out of the sim, and they rescue the character they’ve revealed themselves to. The ship’s crew have stumbled upon the one true religion, and believe it to be a lie, and it’s so heart-breaking. They wonder where their crewmate has gone, but they don’t wonder for long before going back to the comfort of the sim, not realising that they had indeed found their salvation.\n\nThe idea that we could be looking at the truth, looking at some transcendent good, and believe it a lie, that struck me hard. This is a great novel, and I recommend it to you whether you be a Dick-head or not.\n\nIf you aren’t into PKD, you should be, come have a look at my post on his work.\n\nAnd if I’ve grossly misread it, please let me know in the comments."
