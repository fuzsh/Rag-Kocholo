        "text": "List of works by American science fiction, Philip K Dick\n\nThe bibliography of Philip K. Dick includes 44 novels, 121 short stories, and 14 short story collections published by American science fiction author Philip K. Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) during his lifetime. [1]\n\nAt the time of his death, Dick's work was generally known to only science fiction readers, and many of his novels and short stories were out of print.[2] To date, a total of 44 novels have been published and translations have appeared in 25 languages.[3] Six volumes of selected correspondence, written by Dick from 1938 through 1982, were published between 1991 and 2009.\n\nThe Library of America has issued three collections of Dick's novels. The first, published in June 2007, contained The Man in the High Castle, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Ubik, and was the first time science fiction was included in the LOA canon.[4][5] The second collection was issued in July 2008, and included Martian Time Slip, Dr. Bloodmoney, Now Wait for Last Year, Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, and A Scanner Darkly. The third collection was published in July 2009 and included A Maze of Death and the VALIS trilogy (VALIS, The Divine Invasion, and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer).\n\nAt least nine films have been adapted from Dick's work, the first being Blade Runner in 1982.[6]\n\nRecurring themes in Dick's work[edit]\n\nFive recurring philosophical themes in Dick's work have been classified by Philip K. Dick scholar Erik Davis:[7]\n\nFalse realities\n\nHuman vs. machine\n\nEntropy\n\nThe nature of God\n\nSocial control\n\nSimilarly, in Understanding Philip K. Dick, Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or 'ideas and motifs':[8][9]\n\nEpistemology and the Nature of Reality\n\nKnow Thyself\n\nThe Android and the Human\n\nEntropy and Pot Healing\n\nThe Theodicy Problem\n\nWarfare and Power Politics\n\nThe Evolved Human\n\n'Technology, Media, Drugs and Madness'\n\nPublished works[edit]\n\nDates in this bibliography are for completion of first (and usually only) draft.
