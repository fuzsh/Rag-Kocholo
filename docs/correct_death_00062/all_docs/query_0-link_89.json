        "text": "The stories abound…\n\nabout the Peebles ancestor, George Henry Peebles.\n\nSo, this will be an attempt to provide accurate data. Here is what is known, some of it is family legend; some of it has been documented. George Henry Peebles, for the large group of first cousins that I belong to, was our great-great-grandfather. And let it be known now, that I consider family just that, family, no matter their reputation, demeanor, or history.\n\nThe first point of interest is his name. The Peebleses were notorious for naming a child one thing and calling him/her another name. So, it is documented that ‘Grandpa Dick” was named at birth by his mother George Henry Peebles. His name likely came from his ancestors with those names. The family knew him as ‘Grandpa Dick.” Mother, Slena Mae Peebles Murray, when asked what was his name she said, ‘Grandpa Dick.” She further surmised then that his name must have been Richard. And it is true that he sometimes listed his name as Richard after he married his second wife Eliza Holland. He was listed as Richard on some census records like the 1900 Federal Census record where they all lived in the Center Star area of Lauderdale County, Alabama. That seemed logical since ‘Dick’ is considered a nickname for the formal name of Richard. The name issue posed a very difficult obstacle and interfered with any serious research on his life. It was two aunts that first discovered what his given name really was, Betty Lou and Charlotte Peebles. If I recall correctly, the homemade tombstone that Gran, Robert Peebles, made for him listed his name as Richard Peebles.\n\nSince there are no photographs that have been located, one must glean his physical appearance from how previous generations have described him. Evidently, he was a man small in stature compared to other males in the Peebles clan who were over six feet in height. He must have been agile. He was known to demonstrate his temperament with physical actions. From what I have learned about him, he was fearless. The most reliable human source of accurate information, as far as I have found, was my grandmother, Drue Peebles. While sitting around her kitchen table one day, I asked her what Grandpa Dick looked like and she responded that Luther [Peebles] had a good resemblance to Grandpa Dick. Luther was likely a good resemblance to Grandpa Dick in personality as well, but Luther was funny and I suspect so was Grandpa Dick. Mama, Drue Peebles, said that Grandpa Dick would come to their house in Lawrence County many mornings. He would travel there by mule, this must have been a funny sight in and of itself. He would kid her by saying, “Now Drue, I didn’t come to see you. I came to see the baby.” Drue and Robert whose first child died, likely stillborn and the baby was their first living child, their daughter Preston. The first infant was buried at a church cemetery around Leighton, according to what Preston had told me. This information puzzled me, as they were in Lawrence County; but the county boundaries for Colbert and Lawrence Counties changed and Leighton that had previously been part of Lawrence County was now part of Colbert County. Preston Peebles was born in 1920 in Lawrence County, so Grandpa Dick was about seventy-eight years old at the time he rode a mule to their home.\n\nGeorge Henry Peebles’ birthdate and place has several documents that verify the data. He was born below Elkton in Giles County, Tennessee on 9 March 1842. His parents were John M Peebles and Elizabeth Octavia Laughlin Peebles. His siblings that are known were: Emaline H Peebles 1836 – ? , Ann Menefee Peebles 1838 – 1900, Priscilla Laughlin Peebles 1840 – 1913, William M Peebles 1842 – 1891, Mary Peebles 1846 – ? , Sarah Reesanna Peebles 1849 – ? , Wynona Satoka “Toke” Peebles 1859 – 1916 and Margaret “Maggie” Peebles 1870 – ?. I have the Mclaughlin family documented back for generations, but I have been at a brick wall on the Peebles’ line for decades. It is my belief that the Laughlin name was originally McLaughlin and there is some documentation to that fact; further I believe that this family line included “Ole Red” McLaughlin who lived nearby the Casey’s in the Rawhide community in Lauderdale County. “Ole Red” claimed his home was at Cowpen Creek in Lauderdale County on his regular television show in the 1950s. Again, if I recall correctly, “Ole Red” was a musician as well.\n\nAmanda Peebles Grider located the photo you see below that includes a son of Wynona “Toke” Peebles Woodard. Wynona Peebles Woodard was also called “Nona.” The photo caption should be corrected to read: Tully Woodard is the third person from left on first row:\n\nGeorge Henry Peebles lived a colorful life, according to the legends attributed to him; many of which he attributed to himself apparently. He was undoubtedly a spinner of tall tales and his grandson look alike, Luther, was known to tell some tall tales as well. One of the legends that was told by him was that he was the one that gave Teddy Roosevelt the stuffed bear that was thereafter named the Teddy Bear. The factual history of that event does not include a George Henry Peebles. And then, there are stories associated with him that were actual events but that he never credited to himself or at least were not remembered by those who could have passed them down through the family. Some of these tales will follow in our next article.\n\nMama [Drue Tolbert Peebles] would tell of his exploits in the military service during the War Between the States to us. Myself, my twin brothers Lowell and Joel Murray, would ask her to tell us stories and we would sit in the floor at her feet while she sat in her rocker at their house on West 8th Street in Sheffield. She told stories from long ago of ghosts and red eyes, and chains rattling. One story she told was that Grandpa Dick was frying his ration of meat, likely bacon, on an open fire. Along came Joe Wheeler and took his meat from the fire after which George Henry Peebles promptly kissed the side of his head with the frying pan. Some versions of the story say that Joe Wheeler’s ear was cut off; but later pictures of Joe Wheeler show both ears still in tact.\n\nMama said that George Henry Peebles’ punishment was to remove a tree stump without breaking any tendrils of the roots using only his fork. She said the stump was displayed at Lookout Mountain in Tennessee. We were told these stories back in the 1950s. Attempts to locate the tree stump have not yet been successful, but that may not mean that the story was not true. What is true, however, is that George Henry Peebles served as a confederate in the War Between the States. He received a Confederate Pension for a while; it was cut off and he tried to reinstate the pension. Records show that he was receiving a pension; that the government sent a letter to him which was never picked up from the post office. Therefore the inquiry was not answered by him and the government cut off his pension by reason of his failure to respond to that inquiry.\n\nHis stories must have been quite amusing. And likely there was some thread of truth to them. As with legends and lore in general, the stories may have evolved over time. He was quite a colorful character as the stories associated with his life attest to, especially the ones that is that have documentation associated with them. George Henry Peebles’ military record and his family will be the subject of the next article.\n\nRelated articles\n\nIn the cobwebs of my mind… (rememberingtheshoals.wordpress.com)\n\nBailey Springs… (rememberingtheshoals.wordpress.com)\n\nDecember 29, 2011 | Categories: Carolyn Murray Greer, Lawrence County, Peebles, Remembering the Shoals | Tags: Carolyn Murray Greer, George Henry Peebles, Grandpa Dick, Lauderdale County Alabama, Lawrence County, Remembering the Shoals | 1 Comment\n\nKeep this memory close to your heart…\n\non Christmas this year, my littlest ones. My hope is that you will remember it forevermore. For a little background, I present this:\n\nI was born to be a mother. Now that is a silly statement isn’t it? I have known this deep down in my soul since about a month or so after my fifteenth birthday. At least that is what I wholeheartedly believed, through thick and thin, through tears and heartache, through triumphs and defeat, through love and sorrow. That does not suggest that I was ever a perfect mother, just a mother with a perfect love for her children. My children will likely think I have lost it when, or if, they read this, but what I am trying to convey here is not really for them, it is for the successive generations. I have since seen very clearly that my status as Mother was not really meant to be where I could make a difference. The difference I was born to make was to be the Memory Maker for my descendants. I still have a small pillow that my daughter gave me in the 1980s; on it is embroidered, Moms Make Memories. I guess she knew what my purpose in life was to be before I did.\n\nFamily history has always been so important me. The importance really hit home by the time I had lost most of my family elders. This was before my two oldest children were really old enough to know what extended family offered and learned to cherish it. My youngest child has never had a grandfather living during his lifetime or great-grandparents and so on. It was much to my dismay that I realized that my children did not even know who a small portion of their living extended family was; recently some of that has been corrected for my daughter. Growing up, us four (later to be five) siblings basked in the land where our ‘Grands’ and some of the earlier generations were still in our lives. The number of first cousins was huge; and beyond that the relatives were innumerable. Some of our first real true friends were our first cousins. Many remain so today; those who have not stayed in touch remain just as important as well. Beware, what is to come is really mushy expression of love for my family; this is stated so you can exit now if you so desire. For the brave, the story continues…\n\nIn 1985 my only grandchild was born. I regret that I failed to really ‘spoil’ him, but circumstances and life are my explanation. I told him once that I would walk in front of a truck for him. I still mean that. Zac Sledge is all grown now and has a family of his own. Now my daughter, mother, myself and others had wanted a little girl in our family for so many years it is not even funny. We have the perfect grandson….time to know perfection through a girl. Well, our wish came true when Zac and Anna Harmon Cain married. Anna is beautiful perfection of what a mother’s love should be.\n\nThe truest form of perfection came when my first great-grandchild was born. On December 20th 2005, God gave me the most beautiful set of wings. I have always loved to sing even though I can not carry a tune in a bucket, the cat wails, and my children beg me to just stop it. But the song, “1,2,3 Like a Bird I Sing” became my anthem in honor of that day in 2005. That was the day that the most precious, wonderful, bundle of humanity and love was born into our family; and he is really, really smart, too. Logan Thomas Sledge owns my heart from that day forward. I hum that song almost on a daily basis.\n\nWas I not blessed enough by the birth of Logan? I guess the man upstairs did not think so, or was it Zac and Anna? For on the 31st of May 2009, I got a double set of wings with the birth of another little piece of my heart, Taylor Anne Sledge. The other day her mom posted a video that was actually only captured audio, of my Taylor Anne singing to me. Her brother joined in with her. The song was “Rinky Dinky Do, I Love You” and it was just what I needed and I loved it so. Logan: perfect little man. Taylor Anne: perfect little lady. Both artfully disguised as mere humans, but they are actually little angels and they now have me singing another song today: “Like a Bird Without Wings.” The video of the song, with Damian McGinty, is sung by Celtic Thunder. The words (yeah, I changed the wording to suit this narrative) of the song will follow at the end of this article.\n\nCeltic Thunder featuring a younger Damien McGinty sings “A Bird Without Wings.”\n\nMy strongest wish is that these two little ones grow up with love in a home with both parents present, that they cherish each other, and are always the other’s best friend forever. Sometimes sibling rivalry rears its ugly head, but Taylor Anne has the advantage of being the stronger one while Logan is a thinker. Their mom told me recently that they were aggravating each other when Taylor Anne told Logan, “Bubba, if you don’t stop I am going to beat your brakes off, then you can’t stop.” That was a pretty profound statement coming from a two-year-old. And yes, she calls him Bubba just like I wanted; now if he would only refer to her as Sissy like my Daddy did his little sister that I always thought was so endearing…he called her this all his life long. I also hope that the thoughts expressed here might be preserved for Logan and Taylor Anne as cherished memories from their GG.\n\nBe it known that I love these little souls more than life. Always have. Always will.\n\nSigned,\n\nLove GG\n\nA Bird Without Wings: Lyrics\n\nLike a bird without wings that longs to be flying,\n\nLike a motherless child left lonely and crying.\n\nLike a song without words, like a world without music,\n\nI wouldn’t know what to do I’d be lost without you watchin’ over me.\n\n[Da da da da da repeated as beautiful harmony by George]\n\nI get so lonely, when I am away\n\nI count every moment, I wait every day,\n\nUntil I am home again and you hug me so tight\n\nThat’s when I know Everything is alright.\n\nLike a bird without wings that longs to be flying,\n\nLike a motherless child left lonely and crying.\n\nLike a song without words, like a world without music,\n\nI wouldn’t know what to do I’d be lost without you watchin’ over me.\n\n[Da da da da da repeated as beautiful harmony by George]\n\nYou’re my guardian angel; my light and my guide\n\nMy hand on your shoulder and you by my side.\n\nYou make everything beautiful,\n\nYou make me complete.\n\nEverything in my world I lay at your feet..\n\nLike a church with no steeple, where a bell never rings.\n\nIn a town without people, where no voice in the choir ever sings.\n\nIf a boat on the ocean would be lost with no sail,\n\nThen without your devotion\n\nSurely all that I dreamed of would fail.\n\n[Da da da da da repeated as beautiful harmony by George]\n\nLike a church with no steeple, where a bell never rings.\n\nIn a town without people, where no voice in the choir ever sings.\n\nCopied from MetroLyrics.com\n\nDecember 15, 2011 | Categories: Carolyn Murray Greer, Cherokee, Colbert County, Remembering the Shoals, Sledge, Sweet Home Alabama | Tags: Anna Harmon Cain Sledge, Carolyn Murray Greer, GG, Like a Bird Without Wings, Logan Thomas Sledge, Remembering the Shoals, Taylor Anne Sledge, Zac Sledge | Comments Off on Keep this memory close to your heart…\n\nFamily will ensure that he has the happiest birthday ever…\n\nthis year. The tenth of the month marked his birthday party. He will be 80 years of age on his birthday on December 14, 2011. To make the birthday just a little more special for the family, we say this is your life, Alfred Franklin Farris. May you and your family of relatives far and wide enjoy this little walk down memory lane.\n\nAlfred Farris: Dad’s Videos by Michelle Farris:\n\nVideo to Celebrate Dad’s 80th Birthday\n\nVideo of our childhood – celebrating Alfred Farris’ 80th birthday\n\nAlfred Franklin Farris was born 14 December 1931. His parents were Franklin Cook “Frank” and Hester Gertrude Wright Farris who lived at Margerum in Colbert County, Alabama. Frank and Hester Farris’ first child died at birth in 1928. A second child, Carroll Eugene “Gene” Farris, was born in 1930; he died in 5 October 2011. Alfred married Wanda Thompson in 1964 and to them four children were born: Michelle, Suzanne, David, and Scot.\n\nThe parents of Frank Farris were James Barton “Bart” Farris And Mary E Pounders who was sometimes called “Sis” but whose name was listed as Molly Pounders on daughter Ennis Bell McBroom’s death certificate. Bart Farris was born 24 Aug 1844 in Newworton, Tishomingo, Mississippi. He died 4 Feb 1931 in Colbert, Alabama at Allsboro and is buried at Morris Hill Cemetery. Bart and Mary Pounders Farris’ children were: Ida M Harris Worsham 1873 – 1936, Franklin Cook “Frank” Farris 1875 – 1954, Charlie Williams Farris 1880 – 1954 and Ennis Bell Farris McBroom 1882 – 1949.\n\nBart Farris served in the War Between the States. James Barton Farris joined the 7th Alabama Regiment of Infantry, serving in Company H at age 16. He later joined the 10th Tennessee Infantry and served in Company H. He was captured and became a prisoner of war.\n\nThere is a record of a J B Farris of the 5th Texas, Company C, prisoner of war at Ft McHenry that escaped and was recaptured in 1863. They could only hold for two months! This record is Film Number M227 roll 11 at the National Archives. This is for record only and likely is not our Bart Farris.\n\nHe fought in the battles of Franklin and Nashville, and on Hood’s retreat when he was captured by the enemy and taken prisoner. Alfred believes that he was taken to Rock Island Illinois and was then moved to another prison where he survived smallpox. Alabama, Confederate Pension and Service Records, 1862-1947 for James B Farris, Record #6561, give the information that he was in Company F and H in Morllund’s Regiment. He first registered as Bart Farris when joining Morland’s Battalion of Roddy’s Alabama Cavalry.\n\nThe 7th Alabama Infantry was organized at Pensacola Florida, 18 May 1861, with 8 infantry and 2 mounted companies. It was composed of companies that had rendezvoused at that place from the counties of Autauga, Barbour, Butler, Calhoun, Chambers, Cherokee, Dallas, Jackson, Lauderdale, Madison, Montgomery, Pike, and Wilcox. It remained on duty there until November when it was ordered to Chattanooga, and then a month later, it was sent to Bowling Green. It was in a temporary brigade under Col. S. A. M. Wood, and it fell back with the army to Corinth. The time of service of most of the companies expired after 12 months during the first week in April, 1862, and the regiment disbanded. However, the two mounted companies from Autauga and Lauderdale retained their organization and fought at Shiloh, as did other men from the regiment. The mounted companies then became part of the 3rd Alabama Cavalry, and the majority of the remaining men and officers joined other organizations.The field and staff officers: Col. Sterling A. M. Wood (Lauderdale; promoted); Lt. Col. John G. Coltart (Madison); Major Alfred A. Russell (Jackson); and Adjutants Simeon Dean (Chambers; promoted); S. A. McClung (Madison; transferred to Gen’l Wood’s staff).There does not seem to be a roster for Company H. But a few names of the soldiers were located as follows: Private M. Busby, Private S Cockrell, Private H Collier, Private William Collier, Private J L Davenport, Private Thomas H Gammon who served in both Companies H and K, Private George W Garmany, Privates T H Gowan and William H Gowan served in both companies H and K, Private John L Handley, Farrier Doctor H Hann, Private W H Hardy, Private J R Horton, Private F W Killingworth, Private S M McCluny, Captain William W McMiller, Private J C Miller, Private R R Moore, Private G M Moran, Private T J Pollard, and Private T J Pope.\n\nNo record was found yet of him serving in the 10th Tennessee Regiment of Infantry; that fact, however, does not mean that he did not serve. Some, if not most, confederate records were destroyed. The 10th Regiment of Tennessee Infantry organized at Fort Henry, May, 1861; Confederate service September 1, 1861; reorganized October 2, 1862; merged into 4th Consolidated Tennessee Infantry Regiment April, 1865; paroled at Greensboro, North Carolina, May 1, 1865.\n\nBack to him serving in Captain Morllund’s Regiment. This was Moreland’s battalion of Alabama Cavalry that was included in Roddey’s brigade and was in north Alabama and Tennessee during the greater part of the winter and spring of 1863-64, serving for a time in Hannon’s brigade. It fought at Tishomingo creek, June, 1864, and was attached to General Maury’s army, serving in central and northern Alabama. It was paroled at Iuka, May 18, 1865.\n\nExtracts From Official War Records\n\nNo. 52–(595) Mentioned by Gen. E. A. Carr (Union), Corinth, September 13, 1863. Left in valley on Roddey’s departure.

The men were from Franklin, Lauderdale, Lawrence, and Walker counties. During the next spring it was sent to Northern Alabama, assigned to General Roddey’s Brigade, then took an active part in raiding and attacking the Federals. In April, 1864, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. After fighting at Brice’s Cross Roads it saw action in various conflicts from Montevallo to Selma where on April 2, 1865, most of the unit was captured. The remaining part surrendered at Pond Spring. Its commanders were Colonels William A. Johnson and Phillip Dale Roddey, Lieutenant Colonel E.M. Windes, and Majors R.W. Johnson and John E. Newsom.\n\nBart Farris likely resided on the Alabama and Mississippi state lines; by 1907 his residence was given as Colbert County, Alabama. A photo exists of his old home place which was situated on a hill.\n\nBart Farris’ father was John L Farris who was born 1819 in Warren County, Tennessee. His death occurred Feb 1880 in McNairy, Tennessee by some accounts; or at Allsboro, Colbert County, Alabama by other accounts.

Betty Lair and Bart Farris had the following known children: Mahalia Farris 1830 – 1913, James Barton Bart Farris 1844 – 1931, Emma Farris born 1844 , Thomas Champion Farris born 1847, Jane Farris born 1849, John Green Farris 1851 – 1936, Mary Alabama Farris 1852 – 1944, Cynthia A Farris born 1857, Cynthia A Farris born 1857, Julia E Farris born 1858, Virginia Alice Farris 1859 – 1935, Joseph E Farris circa 1859, Emma Farris circa 1861, Mahalia Lair Farris born circa 1863, and Mary E. Farris born circa 1863.\n\nJohn L Farris’ father was Davidson Farris born 1794 in Russell County, Virginia and who died Mar 1870 in Cripple Deer, Tishomingo, Mississippi. His mother was Elizabeth Lizzie Nunnally born 1795 in North Carolina and who died 1856 in Iuka, Tishomingo, Mississippi. Lizzie and Davidson Farris had a large family of children: Elizabeth Farris 1815 – 1852, Catherine Farris 1817 – 1905, David Farris born ca 1818, John L Farris 1819 – 1880, Matilda Farris 1820 – 1913, Margaret Farris born ca 1822, William Champion Farris 1824 – 1900, Sarah Farris 1824 – 1880, James Monroe Farris 1825 – 1913, Sarah Farris 1827 – 1909, Louisa Farris born ca 1833, Mahala Farris 1834 – 1907, Sonia Farisborn ca 1834 and Commodore Perry Farris 1834 – 1880. The Farris family was listed in Tishomingo County, Mississippi in 1837 when it was formed, making them early settlers to this area.\n\n1837-1838 , Tishomingo County, Mississippi provide the following information:\n\nCircuit Court March term 1837 Tish.

Harvey\n\nLand records for Davison Farris include this record for Davidson Farris of Tishomingo County, Mississippi, purchasing 86 acres of Public Land in Alabama, subject to sale at Pontotoc, Mississippi, 22 July 1851:\n\nDavidson Farris married a second time to Mary E Smith Coleman. Their marriage was performed 4 Feb 1857; she was the widow of John Coleman Edmondson who died in 1855. She and John Edmondson had a family of children as well, numbering eight children who are known.\n\nDavidson Farris’ father was Champion T Farris who was born 1766 in Charlotte, Virginia and who died ca 1820 in Franklin County, Tennessee. His mother, Catherine Davidson, was born ca 1770 in Colony, Laurel, Kentucky or in Franklin County, Tennessee. She died ca 1802 in Russell County, Virginia. Champion Farris purchased land in Marshall County, Alabama in 1857. Catherine and Champion Farris had the following known children: Levi Kelly Farris 1785 – 1832, Thomas Farris 1786 – 1862, James Farris 1787 – 1830, Nathan Farris 1790, Davidson Farris 1794 – 1870, Major Washington Farris 1798 – 1862, Elisha Farris 1800 – 1870, William Farris born ca 1800 and Mary Farris born ca 1802.\n\nChampion T Farris’ father was Elisha Farris born 1745 in Brunswick County part, Lunenburg, Virginia and who died 26 Aug 1791 in Moccasin Gap, Washington, Virginia. His mother was Mary Charlotte Vaughn who was born Apr 1749 in Charlotte County , Virginia; and who died 26 Aug 1791 in Moccasin Gap, Russell or possibly Washington County, Virginia. Elisha and Mary Charlotte were married 1 April 1765 in Charlotte County, Virginia. They had the following known children: Champion T Farris 1766 – 1820, Elisha Farris 1767 – 1840, Edward Farris born ca 1768, Mary Farris 1769 – 1791, Nancy Farris circa 1769 – 1791 and Sally Farris 1770 – 1788.\n\nOn 9 May, 1786, the first court of Russell County was held in the Castles Woods settlement at the home of William Roberson. Governor Patrick Henry issued commissions to Justices to preside. The Justices were Alexander Barnett, Henry Smith, Daniel Ward, Andrew Cowan, Samuel Ritchie, Thomas Carter, Henry Dickenson and John Thompson.\n\nAndrew Cowan and Thomas Carter were chosen to represent the county in the General Assembly (House of Delegates).Appointed as county officers were: David Ward, Sheriff; Henry Dickenson, Clerk of Court; Samuel Ritchie and Patrick Porter, Commissioners of Revenue; Harry Smith, County Surveyor; Francis Browning, Coroner.Appointed as county militia officers were: Colonel Henry Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Cowan, Major Charles Cocke, Captains David Ward, William Thompson, William Dorton, Charles Bickley, Francis Browning, James Davidson, Samuel Ritchie, Josiah Fugate and William Martin. Lieutenants were: Alexander Barnett, John Bowen, Charles Hays, John Tate, James Osborn, Samuel Roberson, Elisha Farris,Thomas Carter, Moses Skeggs and John Van Bebber. Ensigns were: Samuel Young, John Thompson, Robert Tate, Henry Hamblin, Solomon Litton, William Byrd, Benjamin Nichalson, Joseph Johnson and William Ewing.\n\nSoon after the first court meeting, additional Justices were added. They were: Charles Bickley, William Martin, Richard Price, Christopher Cooper, John Bowen, John Tate, James Wharton, Charles Cocke and John Frazier.\n\nMore interesting notes are from M E Farris’ notes on a gateway message board from 2006 as follows:\n\nELISHA FARRIS was born in 1745 in Lunenburg County, Virginia. He married Mary Charlotte Vaughn on April 1, 1765 in Charlotte County, Virginia. Mary was daughter of Thomas Vaughn. John Vaughn signed as bondsman.\n\nElisha and Mary had at least three daughters, one of which was named Nancy. There were most likely other children. Note the reference in the British Mercantile Claims below, that his family was living in Kentucky after he and his wife’s death in 1791. It is quite possible Elisha and Mary had at least three sons: Elisha, Jr.; Thomas; and Edward.\n\nElisha, Jr. and Edward could be the persons listed under the Tax list of their grandfather, James Esom Farris (1794 Tax list for Lincoln County, Kentucky).\n\nElisha’s HEIRS were named in an 1823 Scott County, Virginia lawsuit over his estate: Elisha (Jr?), Thomas, Sally and Nancy. These were either Elisha’s children or grandchildren. In one passage of this lawsuit the heirs are also described as CHILDREN AND HEIRS.\n\nSome researchers also include these children: Champion, James, and Nathan. Further research is needed to identify correctly the children of Elisha and Mary.\n\nINDIAN ATTACK ON ELISHA’S TAVERN\n\nElisha, Mary, a daughter (Mary), and grandchild were killed during an Indian attack on Elisha’s Tavern, near Moccasin Gap (near Gate City, VA) 26 Aug 1791. Another daughter, Nineteen-year-old Nancy, was taken by the Indians, but later escaped. Gate City may have also been known as Estillville.\n\nCONFUSION ABOUT MRS. LIVINGSTON SURVIVING THE INDIAN ATTACK\n\nThis account given 6 Apr 1794, from the calendar of VA State papers, Vol 7, page 375. follows:\n\nMrs. Peter Livingston with her children were taken by Captain Bench, from their home on the Holstein (Holston) River. They took them many miles. She whispered to the children to get away, as the Indians did not watch them too closely. The children did get away.\n\nCaptain Bench told her he was going to steal all of Isaac Shelby’s slaves. The Militia under Vincent Hobbs attacked and killed Bench and most of the Indians. The one guarding Mrs. Livingston hit her on the head with his “tomhawke”, but she recovered in about one hour. Hobbs scalped Bench and sent the scalp to the Governor of VA.\n\nNote: According to research by Robbie Sue Farris Glover the “Mrs. Livingston” mentioned above was the wife of Peter Livingston; she was not a Farris daughter. Peter’s brother, Henry Livingston, was married to Mary Farris. Mary was the Livingston wife that was killed at Elisha’s home\n\nBACKGROUND ON CAPTAIN BENGE, WHO LED RAID ON ELISHA’S TAVERN\n\nJohn Benge, an Indian trader who lived among the Cherokee, was married to Wurteh who was part of an influential Cherokee family. John was previously married to Elizabeth Lewis, daughter of William Terrell Lewis and Sarah Martin. Elizabeth’s sister, Susannah, married John’s brother, Thomas Benge. John and Elizabeth had several children at their home in western North Carolina.\n\nApparently, John was living with Wurteh at his home with the Cherokee (probably Tuquo) and had several children born there. These were Robert, Utana “the Tail”, Lucy, and Tashliske. After Elizabeth and the Lewis family found out about John’s Cherokee family, their marriage was dissolved.\n\nWurteh also had a child from a man whose last name was Gist or Guess and their child became known to history as Sequoyah. Robert and Sequoyah were half brothers.\n\nCirca 1788: John’s son, Robert Benge, was married to a Cherokee woman and settled at a site still called Benge’s Field just south of present day Trenton, GA. This was the Cherokee village called Lookout Town.\n\nSummer of 1791: At the Cherokee town called Running Water in present day southernmost Tennessee, Robert Benge announced that he was going to start a raiding campaign against white settlers in southwestern Virginia. Five men joined him and the proceeded northward.\n\nBENGE’S ATTACKS ON THE VIRGINIA SETTLEMENTS\n\nAugust 23, 1791: Robert Benge’s group raided the William McDowell house near Moccasin Gap (Russell County, VA). Two whites were killed and an 8 year old boy and woman were captured.\n\nAugust 26, 1791: A party of Indians, headed by Captain Benge of the Cherokee tribe, attacked the house of ELISHA FARRIS, two miles from Mockison (sic) Gap, murdered Mr. Farris at his house, and made prisoner Mrs. Farris and her daughter, Mrs. Livingston, and a young child together with Nancy Farris. All but the latter were cruelly murdered the first day of their captivity. (Bledsoe et al. in Summers, 1903, p 438)\n\nNote: According to research by Robbie Sue Farris Glover, there has been confusion about the fate of Mrs. Livingston. Was she killed, or did she survive the Indian attack? The answer is, there were two Mrs. Livingstons.\n\nThe “Mrs. Livingston” mentioned above was Mary Farris Livingston, daughter of Elisha and Mary and the wife of Henry Livingston. Henry Livingston had a brother, Peter, whose wife was also involved in an Indian raid; This “Mrs. Livingston” was tomahawked, but survived the attack. (See notes on Mary Farris Livingston).\n\nCONFLICTS REGARDING ELISHA FARRIS’S PROPERTY AFTER HIS DEATH\n\nFrom the “Bristol Herald Courier,” Sunday, November 15, 1964\n\nBACKGROUND- WILDERNESS ROAD\n\nSome suggest that the origin of the Wilderness Road was at Fort Chiswell (Ft. Chissel) on the Great Valley Road where roads converged from Philadelphia and Richmond. Others claim the Wilderness Road actually began at Sapling Grove (now Bristol, Virginia) which lay at the extreme southern end of the Great Valley Road because it was at that point that the road narrowed, forcing travelers to abandon their wagons. It moved through the Cumberland Gap, the only real way to reach Blue Grass land in those days. These travelers, when they had some money in the complicated currency of that day when coin was weighed on scales to determine the value in different states, would buy flour to use on the way.\n\nGEORGE ROBERTS’ MILL\n\nGeorge Roberts, for the first and only time in his life, was prospering. In spite of the activities of the area, the Revolutionary War was being fought. In general Southwest Virginia knew little, and cared less, about the Revolutionary War. The present day descendant who thinks great-great something or other grandpa decided the fate of the Revolutionary War from Southwest Virginia is merely displaying his own abysmal ignorance. Most of the time, there were only a handful who really knew there was a war being fought; others were too busy trying to wrest a precarious living from the savage land and the landed savages to the southeast (the Cherokees).\n\nThere was, of course, one battle-only one-in which the bobtail over mountain men made a contribution to the Revolutionary cause and that was the Battle of King’s Mountain. Many Scott county men fought in this battle, men such as Johnathon Wood, Peter Morrison, and a man already mentioned in this article, James Davidson. This was, of course, the second James Davidson. Almost exactly eight years after the Battle of King’s Mountain, on Oct. 1, 1780, Silas and Sarah Enyart sold their tract of 200 acres of land to James Davidson, Jr., (the elder James Davidson did not die until 1794), the Enyarts having moved into a smaller tract on which they had survey rights later than the Gate City tract.\n\nBy the following spring, early in the year, Silas Enyart was dead and his widow and son left the area. Their departure did not resolve the problem that had been raised over the mills of George Roberts and the land around it.\n\nCONFLICT ON PROPERTY THAT PASSED FROM SILAS ENYARD TO JAMES DAVIDSON, WHO SOLD TO ELISHA FARRIS\n\nRoberts had understood that he was to have had the ten acres as a gift for having established the mill and that the 40 acres surrounding the original ten would be sold him to allow him a decent tract on which his mill could operate. It must be confessed that George was a rather engaging, but worthless, scamp and he allowed the mill to fall into disrepair as soon as the Kentucky travelers began going through less frequently and, stopping as they did at the Block House of Colonel Anderson, they filled up on provisions there, not stopping at the Roberts mill for provisions.\n\nRegardless of the quality of Roberts’ mill or his activity, he claimed to have been promised by Enyart a deed to the ten acres and a right to purchase forty more. He also claimed that when Enyart sold to Davidson and Davidson to ELISHA FARRIS on August 18, 1789, he was assured of this right. However, Farris was killed by the Indians, with several members of his family, on August 26, 1791, so it is impossible to say whether or not Farris had so promised.\n\nAnyhow, the land eventually sold back to James Davidson, Jr., who made his “patriotic” gesture of offering the land for the courthouse to the county of Scott in 1815. The suit was filed just after the land got valuable enough to quarrel over!\n\nLAWSUIT AGAINST HEIRS OF ELISHA FARRIS AND GEORGE EWING\n\nAn 1823 Scott Co. lawsuit (Elisha was killed in what is now Scott Co. in 1791) says Elisha’s heirs who are being sued are: Thomas, Sally, Nancy, and Elisha. Also being sued was George Ewing. I thought at first he might be a son-in-law, but I think he got the disputed land so he was probably more the subject of the suit (probably bought Elisha!s land).\n\nNow we already know that a daughter Nancy survived the Indian attack in 1791. And we know that a daughter, Mary Livingston, was killed by those same Indians. So now we know FIVE of Elisha!s kids: Thomas, Sally, Nancy, Elisha, Jr., and Mary Livingston (died 1791). There MAY have been other children: Champion, James, and Nathan.\n\nLEGAL DESCRIPTION OF LAND THAT WAS INVOLVED IN LAWSUIT\n\nfrom Robbie Sue Farris Glover research\n\n“This indenture made this 9th day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty three between John S.

Pollard, Published by J.B. Lippincott & Co. 1870, in Philadelphia\n\n“Five miles from Estillville, and on the road by which we approached it from Bristol, are the ruins of a block-house which protected the early settlers; and a fearful story yet clings to a spring within the limits of the village, where a family of the name of FARRIS perished under the tomahawks of the savages, their blood dying the waters of the brook.”\n\nThe passage goes on to describe a point west of this location ran the “thoroughfare through which the tribes inhabiting the Rockcastle hills, in the wilderness of Kentucky, passed to the old settlements of Virgina. Not far from here, too, was the range of the celebrated Cherokee chief, ‘Dragon Canoe,’ [should read Dragging Canoe] worthy to be ranked with Tecumseh or Osceola in courage or skill, and who suffered a defeat fatal to his tribe in 1776, at the battle of the Great Island in the Holston River.”\n\nNote: Robbie Sue Farris Glover has located Elisha Farris’s homeplace. It is in Gate City, Virginia. A very large sign stands at the spot where Elisha Sr. was killed. It is at the corner of a Pizza Inn.\n\nBased on the above Elisha Farris’s death, along with some of his family, occurred in Gate City, Virginia, adjacent to the present day Pizza Inn.\n\nThere were two different “Mrs. Livingstons”, one of which was a Farris daughter of Elisha who was killed, along with her parents. The other Mrs. Livingston survived her attack.\n\nThe heirs of Elisha, mentioned in 1823 Scott Co. lawsuit were listed in one passage as “children & heirs.” In addition to those children mentioned in the lawsuit there is evidence that Edward Farris may have been a son of Elisha.\n\nAfter the death of the parents Edward administered Elisha’s estate. He took the younger children to Lincoln County, Kentucky where his grandfather, James Esom Farris, lived and consented (later) for Nancy to marry Nimrod Farris. The relationship as “father” to Nancy comes from a typed list that is inaccurate. The original record does not show Edward as father to Nancy Farris.\n\nThere is a close relationship between Edward, Elisha (Jr.) and Champion Farris. Robbie Sue Farris Glover maintains that Champion is a possible brother to Edward and Elisha Jr.\n\nHere is another account of the Massacre at Moccasin Gap of Clinch mountain by Emory L. Hamilton:\n\nPendleton and McDowell, Farris and Wharton Families Killed\n\nFrom the unpublished manuscript, Indian Atrocities Along the Clinch, Powell and Holston Rivers, pages 211-218.\n\nOn October 6, 1791, (1) Henry Smith, County Lieutenant of Russell Co., VA, wrote to Governor Randolph, the following:\n\nImmediately on the receipt of your Excellency’s instruction of the 25th of April, 1791, I gave orders to the commanding officers of the companies to raise their proportion of 50 men, which I judged absolutely necessary for our defense, but not one man would serve. The approaching expected peace, to be made the last of May with the Cherokees, seemed to look with a favorable aspect on troubled country.\n\nI, not willing to trust my own judgment called a council of officers, whereupon it was advised to be unnecessary to order any more men until it was known whether the Indians would accept the terms of peace offered them at the expected treaty. After this we remained tolerable peaceful, except some horses stolen, till about the last of August, when part of two families were killed; (Pendleton & McDowell), the week following (early September) Elisha Farris and three of his family were killed, and his daughter, a young woman, was taken prisoner. About a fortnight ago, James Wharton, Esq., and his family was killed, and a Negro taken prisoner.\n\nIn this unhappy situation I cannot raise a man in this county for its defense. No man is willing, nor, I believe, can be forced to strip his unguarded family, equally exposed to dangers, of the only help and comfort they have in himself, to defend others more distant, but less dear to his natural feelings.\n\nA very considerable part of the country is at this time, instead of taking up arms to defend themselves, employed in moving their families to the interior parts of the country, out of reach of savage cruelty…\n\nIn the foregoing letter Colonel Smith points up the understandable reluctance of the settlers to abandon their own families to serve in the militia as common defenders of all. Undoubtedly the killings mentioned in his letter were perpetrated by the cunning half-breed Indian Chief Benge, for at this time he was leading most of the forays against the settlers. Benge was an uncanny cunning and cruel savage, using secret routes to fall upon the unsuspecting settlers, hurriedly committing his atrocious murders and then vanishing into the wilderness over routes exceedingly hard to find or follow.\n\nThe Elisha Farris family lived on Moccasin Creek a short distance fro the present town of Gate City. Although much closer in time than many of the other massacre, I have not been able to determine the names of those slain or the details, nor the name of the daughter taken prisoner and her ultimate fate.\n\nOf the James Wharton family not a lot more is known than that of the Farris family, and just where his descendants emigrated to is unknown to this writer. James Wharton had settled on a large tract of land lying on the south side of Clinch River, near, and below Moore’s Fort in Castlewood in the year 1769, at the time of the first settlers in this area. He had lived through twenty-two years of Indian raids before finally being killed, just three years before the last Indian raid on Southwest Virginia. He seems to have been a highly respected personage always referred to as “Esquire”, a term of esteem and respect as then used. Just the year before he had been one of the appraisers of the estate of his neighbor Thomas Osborne, whose home was visible from his own, and just across a narrow valley on one of the beautiful blue grass hills of lower Castlewood, who had suffered the same fate as the Wharton family.\n\nTradition has it that a woman had been hired by Mrs. Wharton to do some weaving and was at work in the loom house, which was slightly east of the Wharton home, when she looked out a small window in the loom house and saw the Indian approaching. She crawled through the window and started running across a field where she met a man riding by the name of Smith. Mounting the horse behind him they rode away to Moore’s fort, two mile distant to get help. A company of men accompanied Smith back to the Wharton home where they found the family murdered.\n\nEarly records shed no light on the number of people killed in the Wharton family, and little is known of the early life of James Wharton other than that his wife was named Margaret, (2) and that he had a daughter named Margaret who married William Robinson, Jr., (3) and a son named William whose wife was named Jemima. (4)\n\nThe Wharton heirs sold their home place to Stephen Gose on the 5th of January, 1799, (5) probably shortly thereafter leaving the area and no known descendants live in the area today.\n\nA small stream running down to Clinch River at Burton’s Ford is still known as “Wharton’s Branch” and local residents still refer to the farm as the “Wharton Lands.”\n\nJames Wharton was one of the first Constables of Washington Co., VA, being appointed to that office on the second day of the meeting of that body on the 29th of January, 1777.\n\nRamsey’s, Annals of Tennessee, page 557, states: “In 1791, on the Russell County side of Moccasin Gap, Mrs. McDowell and Frances Pendleton were killed and scalped.”\n\nA letter from James W. Phillips of Farmersville, Texas dated 25th of April, 1964, to the writer: Now I shall give you the data that I have on the Indian raid:\n\nMy first knowledge of the raid came from a note of W. P. Bickley, (a grandson of William and Jane Kilgore Bickley) in which he stated that Allison Pendleton told a story of Reuben Pendleton and a sister involved in an Indian raid. My mother talked to a granddaughter of Reuben’s, a Mrs. Wells, who lived here, and she told her that she knew that her grandfather’s hand was injured as a result of an arrow wound. Mrs. Wells (Patience Pendleton) lived with her grandfather until her marriage and removal to Texas, a short time before the Civil War. She was very old when my mother talked to her and did not recall many things. She was a great disappointment to us all for she surely knew more than she communicated.\n\nThis letter from my grandfather, written in 1885, next came to light. I do not quote all of it because it is of little interest, relates who his parents were and something about the Civil War:\n\nFarmersville, Texas\n\nOctober 19, 1885\n\nMr. C. H. Pendleton\n\nBerkley Springs, VA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor 30th Sept. Rec’d. I herewith hand you as best I can, claims of relationship. First, my grandfather John Pendleton of Scott County, Virginia, a minister of the Gospel for fifty years (of the Methodist persuasion ) emigrated to Texas in 1858. Died two years later here. Had eight sons. Five came to Texas in ’57 or ’58. Three have since died, my father being one, one other lives here, the other one in Jack County. Another Ivey T. Pendleton lives in Boonesville, Kentucky. Jackson and H. K. Pendleton live in Scott County, Virginia, Rye Cove, P. O. My grandfather had a half-brother Reuben Pendleton, older than himself.\n\nWhen I was twelve years of age, I well remember my old great uncle “Rube” reiterate instances of his boyhood. He died twenty-five years ago at an age of 90 years. An indelible occurrence with Uncle Reuben was when a boy of 12 or 15 years old. He and his sister went to an old peach orchard to get fruit. But few settlers in that country. While gathering peaches the Indians crept stealthily up and demanded their surrender. Old Uncle Reuben, then a boy, seeing them seize his sister, took flight and made his escape, pursued even to the yard fence. When he sprang over the fence, threw up one hand and received a severe wound in the hand from an arrow (the orchard being some six hundred yards from their house.) An improvised scout was at once summoned and pursued the hostiles, two or three days, but returned without the rescue of his sister – however, the young girl strewed many strips of her apron, bonnet and dress, that the party in pursuit might know she was alive and they were on the right trail.\n\nMr. Phillips continues:\n\nThis is an official report from William Blount to the War Department. It was first printed in 1831. It could have been printed earlier in a newspaper, but I have not located the earlier printing, if there was one. I requested a copy of the original from the National Archives, but it is missing from that place.\n\nWashington District\n\n(1) Mrs. McDowell, killed 23 August 1791, near Moccasin Gap, Clinch Mountain by the Bench (Benge) who has attached himself to the Shawnees.\n\n(2) Frances Pendleton, killed August 23, 1791.\n\n(3) Reuben Pendleton, wounded August 23, 1791.\n\n(4) Mrs. Pendleton, prisoner August 23, 1791.\n\n(5) A boy, eight years old, prisoner, August 23, 1791.\n\n(American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. 1, page 331).\n\nThis is also told in Haywood’s History of Tennessee (1826). Also substantially the same in Goodpasture’s History of the Indian Wars.\n\nJohn T. Moore, Tennessee, The Volunteer State, Vol. 1, page 228, reads:\n\nHis (Bob Benge’s) first enterprise in this quarter was undertaken in the summer of 1791. Notwithstanding the treaty of July 2nd, on August 23rd he startled the settlements in the neighborhood of Moccasin Gap of Clinch mountain, by a sudden and unexpected assault on the house of the McDowells and Pendletons. Mrs. William McDowell and Frances Pendleton, the seventeen year old daughter of Benjamin Pendleton, were killed and scalped. Reuben Pendleton was wounded, and Mrs. Pendleton and a boy of eight years of age were carried into captivity.\n\nThis last is a rewrite of Haywood. I add that the paragraph in Haywood sounds to me as if Haywood lifted it from a contemporary newspaper account of the raid. Although Haywood could have interviewed Reuben.\n\nI think the location of the raid incorrect, or rather vague. Benjamin Pendleton came to Southwest Virginia in 1782 or early 1783; he is on the tax list for 1783 and was living in the Ft. Blackmore area. He had a survey for 70 acres of land on the Clinch in 1784. This land was originally granted Alexander Ritchie, Sr., and confirmed in a grant to Benjamin Pendleton in 1793. The exact location of his house is not known, but his seventy acres included an island int he Clinch, which island today on the U. S. Geological Survey map is shown as Pendleton’s Island.\n\nA note before I get further lost. Reuben Pendleton died March 3, 1860, 86 years old, according to his tombstone. My grandfather was some 4 years in error giving Reuben’s age.\n\nI have some misgivings about Frances Pendleton being the daughter of Benjamin Pendleton. I have even suspected that Frances was Mrs. William McDowell. My reason for doubting the relationship of Frances to Benjamin is based upon a single unsolvable fact. Reuben Pendleton sold land in 1826 which had been granted an Edmund Pendleton in 1799 and there is no recorded transfer of this land from Edmund to Reuben. It would appear that Reuben inherited the land from Edmund. The above named John Pendleton who is said by my grandfather to have been the half brother of Reuben is the only child of Benjamin Pendleton of whom there is any recorded proof of relationship. There are two deeds in Russell County which prove this relationship. There was a relationship between Edmund, Benjamin, Reuben and John, but the degree of relationship between Benjamin and John only can be established. I doubt my grandfather’s statement because it would have been quite simple for him to have missed a generation in his calculation; for my grandfather was reared by his grandfather and was quite near the same age as the youngest uncles and aunts – his own first cousins thought my grandfather their uncle. I think that Benjamin, Reuben and Frances were the children of Edmund, but I cannot prove it; I have only the unexplained land of Reuben. And since Reuben was never taxed for land nor was Edmund, it will probably have to rest there. The knowledge of their relationship comes from a letter written by A. J. Pendleton (a son of John) in 1885 in which he stated he was the son of John Pendleton. Benjamin and Edmund Pendleton died 10 miles from here. Reuben died here (Rye Cove). I could never decide where 10 miles from Rye Cove was. This letter was a reply to an inquiry concerning the family. In this letter A. J., also wrote that he came from Amherst County.\n\nThe earliest comprehensive history of the Pendleton family was written in 1858. In that history a note concerning the four eldest sons of William Pendleton of Amherst County, states that the wife and some of the children of either Benjamin, Edmund, John, or Isaac, were captured by the Indians and never heard of again.\n\n(1) Virginia State Papers, Vol. V, page 375.\n\n(2) Russell Co., VA, Order Book 2, page 283.\n\n(3) Deed Book 3, page 25 and Deed Book 2, page 68, Russell Co., VA.\n\n(4) Russell Co., VA Order Book 2, page 283.\n\n(5) Ibid.\n\nNOTE: Benjamin Pendleton is also shown in the 1784 tithable list of Captain Alexander Barnett’s Company of Russell Co., VA, and both Benjamin and Edmund Pendleton are listed in the 1784 tithables in the company of Samuel Ritchie. This latter will also place them in the Dungannon-Ft. Blackmore area.\n\nThis story is also told in the Red Book “The Pendleton’s of England and America” – 1988 and confirms above story of indian raid and loss of life of Frances Pendleton, brother Reuben wounded and their mother Fanny kidnapped.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nElisha Farris’ father was James Esom Farris Sr who was born 1722 in North Carolina and died 14 June 1814 in Lincoln County, Kentucky. His mother was Susanna Luellen Malcolm who was born 1725 in Lunnenberg County, Virginia and died June 1814 in Lincoln County, Kentucky. James Esom and Susanna Farris had a large family of children: William Farris, James Eson Farris 1744 – 1814, Elisha Farris 1745 – 1791, Isaac Farris 1746 – 1826, John Esom Farris 1746 – 1826, Nathan Farris 1746 – 1788, Isham Farris 1751 – 1848, Elizabeth Farris 1756 – 1842, Moses Farris 1759 – 1841, Johnson Farris 1768 – 1840, Major Washington Farris ca 1770 – 1850, Micajah Farris 1772 – 1832, Bede Farris born circa 1773, Susanna Farris born circa 1775 and William Farris 1778 – 1853. This family was associated with the Wilderness Trail in Kentucky and were early settlers in the area.\n\nElisha Farris’ father was Henry Farris born 1670 in Little, Roanoke, Virginia and who died 1761 in Richmond, Wise County, Virginia. His mother was Alicia McGuiver who was born 1673 in Glomorozon, Wales and who died 1744 in Lunenberg, Virginia. Henry and Alicia Farris had the following children: Henry Farris ?– 1730, Thomas Farris 1709 – 1797, William Farris 1714 – 1754, Judith Farris 1715 – 1811, James Esom Farris Sr 1722 – 1814, Joseph Farris 1725 – 1816, Charles Farris 1728 – 1810, Elisha Farris 1729, Jacob Farris 1729 – 1815 and John Esom Farris 1752 – 1826.\n\nHenry Farris’ father was Ian Esom Farris. Ian Esom Farris was from Rutherglen, Scotland and was born circa 3 July 1640. This is where the FARRIS (FARIE) people lived for 600 years before emigrating to Albemarle Settlement, North Carolina in 1663. (from “A Partial Genealogy of the Farris Family,” by John Farris McGauhey, Jr of Dallas, Texas. His mother was Emily Jane Cameron who was born Birth 1643 in Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland and who died 1695 in Little, Roanoke, Virginia. The children of Ian Esom and Jane Farris were: Isaac Farris born circa 1662, Samuel Farris born circa 1667, Isaac Farris born circa 1668, Henry Farris 1670 – 1761, Peter Farris 1672 – 1766 and William Farris born circa 1672. Ian Esom Farris was the Farris progenitor in America.\n\nFarris springs from Ferrex. This is an old name in Wales and Lower Scotland. Rutherglen is the old homeplace from 1000 A.D. until the necessary migration to the old (not but) colonies to escape royal persecution. Farrises are of Royal Danish, Royal Wales, and Royal French (Vayres or Fer) origin also. There are English Royal ancestors. Farris family members are descendants of King David of Israel down from Pharez (an iron forger of the Holy Temple of THE LORD. The Tribe of Judah is the Farris tribe).Again the old homeplace in Scotland Descendants of Ferris & Farris families of Henrico and Lunenburg Counties Virginia ca 1750 carry I1a haplogoup\n\nin Scotland is Rutherglen . . .also known as Camelod (Camelot) (from the Chronicles of Britain). King Arthur’s uncle and father are buried there. The Brits have found the marked graves. King Arthur is a family member through France (Breton relatives the De Ganis or Fer, also d’Albret [for Breton]). He and his knights are ancestors (Fer = De Ganis)( also Morgan = Blamore De Ganis). Baldwin de Fer is an ancestor to link to.All those wondering about the Ferrers link. . .this is it. Ferrex is pronounced Ferresh. Farris is the french pronunciation from a resettlement by David I of Scotland of the French Vayres to the old homeplace to keep the bloodlines. By the way “Henrico” is his favorite son’s name. Ian Essom (read that “Essene”) Farris landed in North Carolina on the bottom region of Henrico to help guard Varina. Turkey Island in the James River area is his home. North Carolina is his death place.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nAnd so December 14th is the day to celebrate Ian Esom Farris’ descendant, Alfred Franklin Farris’, birthday, his 80th birthday. His birthday was celebrated by his family and numbered about one hundred close friends in the crowd. His children and family made the day memorable for sure. There was a party, cake, photo, a scrapbook of cherished memories and photos, and a couple of videos as well. It is hoped that the family and their large number of relatives and descendants enjoy this article.\n\nJust be cautioned that there will be errors that need to be corrected, but the overall treatise is the tracing of roots that family members can enjoy for generations to come. Unless some spelling errors were overlooked, the spelling is as contained in the original documents. Please feel free to post any additions, corrections, or omissions as comments.\n\nRelated articles\n\nJames Barton Farris, Company H, 10th Tennessee Infantry (franklindescendants.wordpress.com)\n\nDecember 15, 2011 | Categories: Carolyn Murray Greer, Cherokee, Colbert County, Farris, Margerum, Remembering the Shoals | Tags: Alabama, Alfred Franklin Farris, Bart Farris, Carolyn Murray Greer, Colbert County, Ian Esom Farris, James Barton Farris, John L Farris, Margerum, Remembering the Shoals | 1 Comment"
