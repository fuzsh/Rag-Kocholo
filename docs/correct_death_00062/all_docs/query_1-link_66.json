    "text": "Thanks to the release of the Blade Runner 2049 movie in 2017, as well as the series Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams and The Man in the High Castle, Philip K. Dick’s name has been prominent in pop culture lately.\n\n2017's Blade Runner 2049 was the sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner, which was loosely based on Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.\n\nElectric Dreams is an anthology series that premiered in 2017; each episode is based on one of Dick’s sci-fi short stories. The Man in the High Castle, the series finale of which aired in 2019, was loosely based on Dick’s novel of the same name and took place in an alternate history where the Axis powers won World War II.\n\nGiven the recent influx of adaptations of his work, it's clear Dick's vision of the future continues to captivate us. Nearly 40 years after his death, his vivid dystopian worlds and messages about human nature still compel readers. His themes of personal identity and what constitutes a human soul are particularly prescient now, in a time where the rise of artificial intelligence has begun to threaten the very profession of writing.\n\nIf you've never read one of Dick's books before, however, you're not alone. While Dick was regaled in the science fiction and fantasy community, winning the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel, he struggled to reach broad appeal or even to pay his bills. That said, his ideas and stories helped to make science fiction what it is today. His novels are not only brilliant and entertaining, they can also help offer a valuable insight into the foundation of speculative fiction as we know it today.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some Philip K. Dick books that every sci-fi fan should try."
