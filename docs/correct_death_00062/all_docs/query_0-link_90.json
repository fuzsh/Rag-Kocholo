        "text": "Spring Bitters – John W. Service\n\nHartford, Connecticut\n\n25 January 2019\n\nBobby Conner sent me the two top-most pictures here and said, “Good morning Ferd. Here’s a bitters you may enjoy seeing. I can’t find any info on it other than Bill Steele ‘thinks’ he may have had one at one time. Enjoy.”\n\nI’ve not seen this bottle before so I thought I would check it out. Spring Bitters was somewhat of a generic term for bitters but there are certainly a few embossed and labeled Spring Bitters out there associated with proprietors. Here is a 1935 article about “Grandma’s Spring Bitters.”\n\nLooking at Bitters Bottles by Carlyn Ring and Bill Ham, I see S 98, Shedd’s Spring Bitters from Jamestown, New York which is a rectangular, amber bottle with a tooled lip. A labeled example is pictured below.\n\nThere is also a labeled, S 168, Spring Bitters which is rectangular and amber, another S 168 Spring & Summer Bitters put out by A.S. Davis who was an agent in Chelsea, Massachusetts.\n\nMost interesting is a S 168.7 Spring Bitters noted in Bitters Bottles Supplement with (street address) and (city and state). It is noted as oval, aqua and has a tooled lip. I suspect this is our bottle with outdated information or incomplete information.\n\nThe new Carlyn Ring and W.C. Ham listing in Bitters Bottles Supplement 2 is as follows according to Bill Ham:\n\nS 168.7 Spring Bitters\n\nSPRING BITTERS / J. W. SERVICE / 243 PARK ST / HARTFORT CT // f //\n\n7 5/8 x 3 1/8 x 1 7/8\n\nOval, aqua, NSC, Tooled lip, Very rare\n\nHere are a few additional pictures Bobby sent with an outdoor setting.\n\nJohn W. Service\n\nJohn W. Service was born on February 21, 1858 in Worcester, Massachusetts. His father was William Service and his mother was Hellen Smith. He first married a Rebecca G. and she died in 1892. He then married Susan Ellen Aldred in 1893. His father died at the young age of 30 or so while his mother, from Scotland, died in 1910.\n\nWe first see John clerking in a drug store in the late 1870s with an Edwin Crary who had a drug store at the corner of Park and Squire Streets in Hartford, Connecticut. This leads to an almost 40 year span where he was a prominent and popular druggist, most for his own concerns at 243 and 299 Park Street in the South End of Hartford. He called his 299 store “The Modern Pharmacy.”\n\nHe probably sold his aqua Spring Bitters in the late 1880s though there was another Spring Bitters being sold at the City Hotel Drug Store on Main Street in Hartford, Connecticut in 1884, according to this Hartford Courant advertisement below. Maybe this product gave him the idea? Later in 1890, another advertisement said that various spring bitters were being sold in nearly every drug store in Hartford. “Their show windows are full of bottles of spring tonic bitters; you buy a bottle, you think that it does good.” They go on to say that all those spring bitters don’t work and you should use their Pure Wines of California Spring Bitters made by the California Wine Agency, located at 72 Trumbull Street in Hartford.\n\nLike many druggists bottles, the typography on the Spring Bitters bottle is slanted left opposed to straight or italicized right which I find interesting. It must have been a short run since this example is the only bottle example that I, and others have seen. I also can not find any advertising for the product. I did find this picture below of his standard druggist bottle.\n\nIn 1910, with regulations severely tightened with what druggists could sell, John Service updated his druggist license to sell spirituous and intoxicating liquors, ale, lager beer, Rhine Wine and Cider at the 299 Park Street address. He had previously pled guilty to violating the provisions of his earlier liquor license and was fined $25 and costs. He was to sell these products for medicinal purposes and not to get drunk on the premises. They had taverns and bars for that. He agreed to not sell spirituous liquors in quantities exceeding one gallon, except other than distilled liquors and those in quantities exceeding five gallons. His license cost fifty dollars. Basically these drug stores, in many cases, were the first convenience stores that are everywhere today.\n\nThough I could not find a picture of his drug stores, I did find the picture below for Lester H. Goodwin, Pharmacist located at 336 Main Street in Hartford during the same time period. If you enlarge the picture you can read that he his selling Drugs & Medicines, Mineral Waters, Soda, Poland Water, Trusses, Elastic Stockings and Supporters. His Homeopathic Pharmacy also had a sign reading “Open All Night.” His products were displayed neatly in his first floor corner shop windows.\n\nJohn W. Service retired in 1917 when he sold his drug store at 299 Park Street to James DeLeo and James P. Murray, who had been his clerks, one about nine years and the other about three. He also sold his interest in the 243 address to George Robertson who had run the store and been his partner.\n\nJohn Service was well known in other ways and was considered one of the earliest baseball fans and financial supporters of local clubs in Hartford. Hartford had nearly continuous baseball from 1874 to 1952, including early major league baseball teams from 1874-1877. He retired in Middlesex, Massachusetts where we last see him in 1920. He died around 1929.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1858: John W Service, Birth Date: 21 Feb 1858, Birth Place: Worcester, Massachusetts, Father: William Service, Mother: Hellen Smith – Massachusetts, Birth Records, 1840-1915\n\n1880: John W.

It caught my eye as a possible unlisted bitters.\n\nStill more arrests for selling Black Hawk Bitters that made men climb telegraph poles and throw their tools in the street!\n\nIn the notice, J.T. Gentle, a druggist from Vandalia, Missouri, was indicted on eight counts for selling Black Hawk Bitters. This is not too surprising in the 1915 pre-Prohibition temperance era as many spirits were disquised and sold as patent medicines. He said the alcohol in the bitters was sufficient to keep the product from spoiling.\n\nIn another newspaper notice, druggist, M.K. Shuggart in Iowa also had his Black Hawk Bitters seized. In court, he said it was a medicine and that it was a summer drink and should be classified with lemonade, even though the bitters was labeled 30 percent alcohol. Still more arrests for selling Black Hawk Bitters that reportedly made men climb telegraph poles and throw their tools in the street! The last from the Kansas Democrat in Hiawatha, Kansas. This is the kind of material you find in bitters researching, just like the assorted nefarious material put in a bitters bottle.\n\nWhile this bitters may be unlisted, I doubt it. There are no proprietors listed and each druggist would not make his own Black Hawk Bitters. In Bitters Bottles by Carlyn Ring and Bill Ham, there is a B 114, labeled amber square for Black Hawk Stomach Bitters (Windsor’s Black Hawk Liver and Stomach Bitters) being sold by Hartz & Bahnsen, Sole Proprietors in Rock Island, Illinois in the 1890s.\n\nThe new listing by Bill Ham for the forthcoming Bitters Bottles Supplement 2:\n\nNewspaper article\n\nB 113.5 BLACK HAWK BITTERS, Albert Lehman, Manufacturer\n\nQuad City Times (Davenport, Iowa), March 20, 1867\n\nIn the follow-up Bitters Bottles Supplement there is a listing B 114.5, for a labeled amber oval square Black Hawk Stomach Bitters with a graphic of a Indian Chief in headdress. This was a tonic put out by the Columbia Chemical Co. in Saint Louis, Missouri. An example is pictured below from the Lou Hollis collection.\n\nThere was also a Black Hawk Bitters made by Meyer Bros. Drug Co. in Saint Louis, Missouri in 1914 as reported in National Association of Retail Druggists.\n\nAny one of these bitters could be the Black Hawk Bitters referenced in the top advertisement.\n\nAnother Black Hawk Bitters\n\nHere is another newspaper notice (represented further below) about a fellow named Albert Lehman who was the manufacturer of Black Hawk Bitters in 1867 according to the Quad City Times in Davenport, Iowa. He was arrested for Licentious Assault for the intent to commit a rape of a Regina Magnus. That was his wife.\n\nHe was arrested for Licentious Assault for the intent to commit a rape of a Regina Magnus. That was his wife.\n\nEvidence presented said that it appeared that Regina Magnus was the daughter of Franz Staufenbeil, who at the time was engaged with Lehman to manufacture Black Hawk Bitters. In court, the assault was proved by Regina, her mother and her father.\n\nAlbert Lehmen filed an affidavit denying the assault and claiming the prosecutions malicious. In the document given by the police magistrate, Franz Staufenbeil had been previously convicted of keeping a house of ill-fame.\n\nAnother crazy bitters story. This bitters may have been the genesis of the bitters produced in the 1890s and 1900s.\n\nBlack Hawk\n\nBlack Hawk, (1767 – October 3, 1838) was a band leader and warrior of the Sauk American Indian tribe in what is now the Midwest of the United States. Although he had inherited an important historic medicine bundle from his father, he was not a hereditary civil chief. Black Hawk earned his status as a war chief or captain by his actions: leading raiding and war parties as a young man, and a band of Sauk warriors during the Black Hawk War of 1832.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Black Hawk fought on the side of the British against the U.S., hoping to push white American settlers away from Sauk territory. Later he led a band of Sauk and Fox warriors, known as the British Band, against European-American settlers in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin in the 1832 Black Hawk War. After the war, he was captured by U.S. forces and taken to the eastern U.S. He and other war leaders were taken on tour of several cities.\n\nJust 49 years had passed since Black Hawk had been laid to rest in 1870 at Spring Lake, Utah, when members of the LDS Mormon Church robbed the contents of his grave in 1919. Accompanying the article is a photo of William E. Croft standing in the open grave, grinning ear to ear, while holding the skull of Black Hawk. While the living descendants of Black Hawk were outraged and heartbroken, their voices fell on deaf ears. Seemingly without conscience or remorse church leaders without a lick of civility made no apologies, in spite of a federal law passed in 1906 called the Graves Protection Act. Descendents of Black Hawk had no real legal recourse until the enactment of the National American Graves Protection Reparation Act, or NAGPRA, passed in 1994.

Harper website and visit the history menu on the banner, the following opening screen reads, “THE I.W. HARPER LEGACY, A LEGEND IS BORN” followed by “I.W. Harper’s story begins in 1848 when our founder, I.W. Bernheim, came to America with $4 and a dream. A century later, his bourbon whiskey empire remains.”\n\nJerry Phelps recently shared some bottle images of a round, amber, sealed and pontiled Tincture of Centaury Bitters bottle from Louisville, Kentucky. I have heard of this bottle but have never seen pictures before, so this is pretty exciting.\n\nBack in 2014, I posted a list of “Kentucky’s Top 25 Rarest Bitters Bottles“, compiled by Paul Van Vactor, Sheldon Baugh and Steve Keith. The Tincture of Centaury Bitters was noted as No. 6 without a picture. Well, today I finally added that picture.\n\n6.

John Hill’s Medicines – Tincture of Centaury – 1776\n\nThe newspaper clipping below from The Caledonian Mercury (London), July 6, 1776 notes that Sir John Hill was making a Tincture of Centaury in 1776. Centaurium erythraea is a species of flowering plant in the gentian family known by the common names, common centaury and European centaury. The European centaury is used as a medical herb in many parts of Europe. The herb, mainly prepared as tea, is thought to possess medical properties beneficial for patients with gastric and liver diseases.\n\nHill developed his bitters for Disorders in the Stomach, and creating an appetite. He called Centaury “the great Stomachic; in preference to all other bitters; in that it gives an appetite and good digestion, and neither heats nor binds the body. With an account of the plant, and the method of gathering and preparing; and a few rules for such as have weak stomachs.” Price 6d.\n\nBernheim Bros. & Uri Overview\n\nAt one point, Bernheim Bros. & Uri were one of the largest wholesale liquor dealers and distillers in Kentucky and the United States. Bernheim Brothers was started in 1872 by Isaac Wolfe Bernheim and Bernard Bernheim on a small scale and developed at a phenomenal rate and in 1891 reported annual sales of about $2,000,000.\n\nTheir slogan was “Tall Oaks from Little Acorns Grow.” The Bernheim Bros. distillery opened its doors in 1870 and thrived through Prohibition. The I.W. Harper namesake was born by 1872 and began producing a whiskey that would win Gold Medals throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. In 1875, Nathan M. Uri became a member of the firm and the firm name changed to Bernheim Bros. & Uri. This would have been when the Tincture of Centaury Bitters was made.\n\nIsaac Wolfe Bernheim\n\nIsaac Wolfe Bernheim, also known as Ike, was born on November 04, 1848 in Schmieheim, now part of Kippenheim in Germany. He was the son of Leopold (Leon) Solomon Bernheimer and Fanny Weil-Bernheim and the husband of Emma Bernheim and Amanda “Mandie” Bernheim. His father was a merchant by profession.\n\nIn 1861, when laws regarding civil rights for Jews were liberalized, the Weil/Bernheim family moved to Freiburg, Germany. Isaac’s sister Elise died, leaving Isaac with only one brother, Bernard, two years his junior from his mother’s first marriage. He was apprenticed in Freiburg eventually to learn bookkeeping and money handling until 1864 when at age 16, he first gained employment as a clerk in Mannheim and in Frankfurt am Main in 1865. He gradually became somewhat independent in Frankfurt until the summer of 1866 when war with Austria eventually hindered business in Frankfurt. It was during that time that he met with his uncle Livingston who was visiting from the United States who impressed Isaac with the success that could be achieved with hard work, health and good fortune. The uncle also promised him a job in New York. With Europe in the grips of war, Isaac emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York in April 1867.\n\nIsaac arrived only to find his uncle’s cotton and yarn mills near Broadway in New York City closed, with his uncle close to being bankrupt. The country was in a state of flux from the effects of the Civil War and he could find no gainful employment. He left New York for Pennsylvania to become a peddler (pictured above), selling household items such as needles, pins, threads, suspenders, handkerchiefs and ladies stockings. He became more fluent in English and American customs and by October 1867 was able to enlarge his stock and buy an old horse and a wagon.\n\nThe young I.W. Bernheim then established winter headquarters in Overton, a small town in Pennsylvania. When his horse died he moved to Paducah, Kentucky in May 1868 and took a position as bookkeeper and salesman in his uncle Livingston’s firm, Livingston & Weille. The uncle had moved to Paducah to join in business with another uncle of Isaac. Later that year, he moved to the prominent liquor wholesalers Loeb & Bloom and became their bookkeeper at $40 per month. It was here that he began to realize greater success and was able to save enough money over a two year period to pay off his debts, buy some clothing and begin sending money home to his mother. His steady income allowed him to save enough to bring Bernard Bernheim, his younger brother by two years, over from Germany to join him in Paducah. In 1870, he gained some say with the firm and Isaac’s brother Bernard was hired to replace Isaac as bookkeeper. Isaac then became a traveling businessman for the liquor business.\n\nOn January 1, 1872, the two Bernheim brothers left the firm in a dispute with the owners over becoming partners with interest in the business. With the money they had saved plus a considerable investment from a silent partner, Elbridge Palmer, they were able to open a competing business, called Bernheim Brothers in Paducah, Kentucky. The brothers are believed to have contributed their life savings of $1,200 to help fund the $3,200 start-up. They also set up administrative and distribution offices in Chicago at 87 Washington Street.\n\nBoth the brothers were young, wide-awake, aggressive, had persistent natures, full of enterprise and ambitions to grow. Because of their proximity to large waterways and the ability to ship product throughout the Midwest, the company prospered.\n\nThe business was successful and the brothers bought out their silent partner and admitted Nathan M. Uri (brother to Isaac’s wife, Amanda) as a partner. He is pictured above. The company was renamed Bernheim Brothers and Uri. Nathan’s father, Morris “Moses” Uri, an immigrant from Hechingen, Germany, was an early settler in Paducah, Kentucky. He owned a small frontier type general store there that burned in a citywide conflagration in 1851. Surviving the loss, Morris continued in commerce, running a grocery with a large liquor component. He ultimately became part owner of a distillery and opened a liquor sales office in Chicago. With wife Amelia (Halheimer), also a German immigrant, Morris sired a family of six, five girls and Nathan, born in 1857. Within 15 years, their business trading covered the entire South and spread into parts of the West and Northwest.\n\nIn 1879, the Bernheim Brothers register the I.W. Harper brand. The I.W. initials were borrowed from Isaac’s own name, while Harper was the surname of a famous horse breeder (F.B. Harper). The brand went on to win multiple medals for quality, the first being at the New Orleans Exposition on 1885.\n\nIn March 1896, Bernheim Bros. and Uri bought out all interests in the Pleasure Ridge Park distillery, seven miles southwest of Louisville. That facility had been built in the early 1870s but the owner had lost it in the Panic of 1870 and they joined a combine of investors to buy him out.\n\nAt this time Bernheim and Uri were not distillers themselves but rectifiers and wholesalers of a wide variety of alcoholic spirits. Pleasure Ridge provided them with the raw whiskey for blending into brands they vigorously marketed nationwide. The arrangement was that Isaac worked sales to the West, Nathan to the East. Endowed with a strong work ethic, the two men were on the road constantly. Meanwhile Bernard looked after day to day operations. The plant was equipped for the manufacture of sour mash, fire copper sweet mash, quick maturing Bourbons, ryes identical with those made in Pennsylvania and Maryland and neutral spirits. On June 1, 1891 Nathan M. Uri left the partnership and set up his own company.\n\nOne newspaper report stated that the Bernheim Bros. had the finest office in America for whiskey distribution. It was 65 feet long, 25 feet wide and had a 35 foot high ceiling which had relief work of steel painted white and gold. The rear of the office had one immense oval window 25 feet wide and about 30 feet high in the center. The walls were wainscoted with quarter sawed oak for about 10 feet and above, they are decorated in yellow and gold with deep blue background. All the fixtures and desks were of oak, the floor also being oak. At night, an immense chandelier of incandescent lights supported a single light on each desk.\n\nThe entire building had a steam heated system, was lighted by electricity and had two electric elevators used for freight and passenger service. The balance of the second floor was used for storage that held tax-paid stocks for use in the blending departments. Another warehouse on Washington Street held much larger stocks. The third floor was where goods were gauged, sampled and marked before being lowered to the first floor for shipment. The fourth floor was fitted up to be the bottling department that had the most modern appliances used for washing bottles, filtering whiskey, filling bottles, corking, capping etc. A large support force of men and women were employed that included thirty-odd salesmen. In 1898, the offices were relocated to 133 West Main Street between First and Second in Louisville. The new building was four stories in height, plus the cellar, 225 feet in length and 25 feet wide and had similar departments as the previous location.\n\nIn 1896, The Pleasure Ridge Park distillery was destroyed by fire, leaving the Bernheim Brothers with a $1 million dollar tax bill on the bonded whiskey that had been stored in its warehouses. The Brothers begin building the Bernheim Bros. distillery on Bernheim Lane and they are again in production the following year. By 1903, the company incorporated as Bernheim Distilling Co. with $2m in capital.\n\nIn 1906, Bernheim Distilling Co. acquired the Warwick distillery. The company apparently also had a stake in the Mayfield distillery. During the Prohibition era, Bernheim Brothers Distillery was one of only ten distilleries allowed to continue to make bourbon for medicinal purposes.\n\nThe various linear companies in this post used the brand names: A Fair Exchange, Comet Whisky (pictured above), Crestmore (bottle pictured further below), F.F.V., F.F.V. Rye, I.W. Harper, Kentucky Reserve, Metropolitan, Old Complimentary, Old Continental (pictured below), Old Moorehead, Old National Whiskey (pictured below), Owl Hollow, Prosperity, Shaw’s Malt, and The Whiskey Your Grandfather Used.\n\nIn 1911, United American Co. was organized with Albert S. Roth, president and Milton W. Barkhouse, Vice President, to assume the property and interests of the Bernheim Distilling Co. An example of one of their brands is pictured below. From 1920 to 1933, both the Bernheim Bros and Warwick plants were partially dismantled and the property sold, but Bernheim Distilling Co. operated as a medicinal whiskey distributor. In 1934, Schenley purchased the brands, ultimately becoming the property of United Distillers.\n\nIn 1992, a large distilling plant called the Bernheim Distillery was opened in Louisville (on West Breckinridge Street near Dixie Highway) by United Distillers, which was owned by Guinness. United owned the I.W. Harper brand at the time the distillery was opened, but it had cheapened the quality of the brand in the U.S. market, focusing instead on Asia and Europe (especially Japan, where the product became a top brand of bourbon). They then took the brand off the U.S. market entirely. United became Diageo in 1997 when Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan, and Diageo continues to own the brand but no longer owns the distillery. The modern Bernheim distillery is not to be confused with the prior Bernheim distillery sites. [Wikipedia]\n\nI.W. Bernheim became a notable philanthropist and member of the national Jewish Community in the United States. He financed two Kentucky statues in the statuary hall of the U.S. Capitol (the only two statues privately purchased there), a statue of Abraham Lincoln outside the Louisville Free Public Library and the statue of Thomas Jefferson outside the Jefferson County, Kentucky courthouse.\n\nUpon visiting his hometown of Schmieheim in the early 20th Century, Bernheim financed Schmieheim’s first plumbing system and built homes for the elderly and for children. In 1928 he purchased 14,000 acres of farm land in Bullitt and Nelson Counties, Kentucky and established the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest in 1929.\n\nI.W. Bernheim died on April 01, 1945 at age 96 in Santa Monica, Los Angeles County, California and is buried in Kentucky. He truly waste of the great pioneers of American whiskey, and he also made a bitters.\n\nHistorical data of young I W Bernheim references an article by Charles Hartley that appeared in The Courier-Journal on 11 September 2013.\n\nNewspaper Support\n\nSelect Notes:\n\n1848: Isaac Wolfe Bernheim, Birth Date: 4 November 1848, Birth Place: Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Father: Leon Solomon Bernheim, Mother: Fanny Weil-Bernheim – U.S., Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current\n\n1865: I.

There is no proprietor name or location embossed on the bottle. Of course a paper label would have had that information, but the label is long gone. I also have an advertising trade card for Congress Bitters, The Great American Tonic with no proprietor name noted. It is pictured below. I always assumed the bottle and the card were related.\n\nFor the bottle, the Carlyn Ring and W.C. Ham listing in Bitters Bottles is as follows:\n\nC 216 Congress Bitters\n\nCONGRESS // sp // BITTERS / f //\n\n9 1/4 x 3 1/4 x (7) 1/8\n\nRectangular, Amber, LTC, Applied mouth, 3 sp\n\nScarce\n\nFor the advertising card, the Capitol constitutes the logo or trade mark for Congress Bitters. The New York lithography firm of Schumacher & Ettlinger created this skillfully rendered view, giving the product a sense of delicacy. Fine details of a carriage and the building’s innumerable columns were set in a frame of flowers and ferns. The sophisticated design belied the cruder approach to the reverse. A tightly packed mass of text argued the benefits of the tonic “for invalids, females and delicate persons.” The bitters was sold for $1.00 a bottle by druggists and medicine dealers. Like many widely distributed trade cards, this one provided a space at the bottom for a local merchant to print their retail information. In my case, the druggist is J. C. Saur from Napoleon, Ohio.\n\nSearching on the Internet and through newspapers, I see other listings for Congress Bitters but not the one I am looking for. This includes William Allen’s Congress Bitters, Hellman’s Congress Bitters and Sterne’s Celebrated Congress Bourbon Bitters. Been there before.\n\nFinally, I find some information noting that there was a Congress Bitters made by Dundas Dick & Co. in New York. The bitters was considered a fraud as it contained 29.06% of alcohol by volume and sugar with very little else except flavoring. A Special Bulletin was put out by the North Dakota State University, Regulatory Division in 1914. You can see a short clipping below followed by the full text.\n\nCONGRESS BITTERS\n\nFrom the North Dakota. Agricultural Experiment Station, Agricultural College, Agricultural Experiment Station, Food Department, 1914\n\n“Congress Bitters are not an intoxicating beverage and being purely vegetable they can be used at all times with beneficial results. In the case of dipsomania or for persons having an unnatural desire for liquor they will be found peculiarly suitable as the use of the Bitters will enable them to free themselves of this pernicious appetite by acquiring a healthy appetite for solid foods.”\n\nSounds good, doesn’t it? A cure for the liquor habit and contains 29 per cent of alcohol, a little sugar, and scarcely anything else, except aromatics. In other words, about the strength of whiskey when reduced with water by the average drinker. A fine cure this would be, supplying the very thing that the unfortunate victim needed to avoid. Another of America’s disgraces in the patent medicine line.\n\nCongress Bitters, “The Great American Tonic,” according to the label, is put out by Dundas Dick & C0., of New York, our Lab. No. 8586, and claims to be a healthful appetizer, a safe invigorant, and, according to the label, a remedy for dyspepsia, indigestion, constipation, ague and diseases of the stomach, bowels, liver and kidney.\n\n“They purify and enrich the blood, tone and impart strength to the system stimulate the digestion, regulate the bowels, promote a healthy appetite, dispel nervous exhaustion, cure general debility, revive the physical energies, correct weakening irregularities, banish languor, and give buoyancy to the spirits. Are especially recommended as a true tonic and restorer for invalids, females and delicate persons.”\n\nNot much question but what if enough were taken it would give buoyancy to the spirits. Among other things it is a nerve stimulator, a sure remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion; a reliable antidote for chills, fevers and. all malarial diseases.\n\nOn their circular they again repeat:\n\n“Congress Bitters are not an intoxicating beverage. * * * They are classed strictly as a medical agent. Can be given at all times with beneficial results.”\n\nThis wonderful preparation, $1.00 per bottle for about 12 ounces, is found to contain as follows:\n\nVolume . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 360 c. c.\n\nSpecific gravity at 25° C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .9702\n\nSolids, grams per 100 c. c . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.70\n\nAsh, grams per 100 c. c . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.0128\n\nSugar, grams per 100 c. c . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.01\n\nAlcohol by volume . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29.06%\n\nPhosphates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. present\n\nEmodin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. absent\n\nCinnamon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , . .. present\n\nCapsicum . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. present\n\nPlant tissue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . absent\n\nPlant extract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . small amount\n\nAside from the sugar, there is very little of other solids. At most only a slight trace of mineral matter is present; the sugar and alcohol are the chief and essential constituents, together with flavoring matter in this beverage.\n\nDundas Dick & Company\n\nThat is an unfamiliar and interesting name. Is it one person or two? A search and follow-up uncovers a special medicine-man from Edinburgh, Scotland. Dundas Dick was born around 1838 and brought up in Heriot’s Hospital, which was founded in Edinburgh to educate the sons of freeman of that city.\n\nAt the age of fourteen he was apprenticed by the governors of the hospital to an apothecary in Edinburgh. After that apprenticeship, he found similar employment in Glasgow. While there he learned how to make gelatin capsules. An 1861 Scotland census shows Dundas Dick living in Edinburgh with his mother Isabella Dick who was sixty years old. In 1864, he came to New York alone with dreams of a new life, capsules on his mind and I’m sure, his savings from Scotland.\n\nDundas next shows up in 1865 in New York City where he is selling capsules for Tape Worms. He was described as a slight-built, low-sized, delicate-looking man with a smooth face by one newspaper account. He was a life-long bachelor and and his only relative in the states was his brother. An 1866 IRS Tax Report notes a Dundas Dick, Manufacturer who is located at 547 Broome in New York City. He receives his U.S. naturalization papers in 1868. Here is an 1872 newspaper ad below saying how safe his Castor Oil soft capsules are. No taste, no smell, no Croton Oil and so pleasant that children ask for more!\n\nHis capsules would make him rather famous, wealthy and get him in trouble too. In 1873, there was a mysterious death of an Italian, Professor Domenico Minneill in New York. Dundas Dick was accused, after all, of putting Croton Oil in this Castor Oil capsules. Apparently the professor took the Dundas Dick & Co. pills that lead to his death. Read Full Account.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Era reported in 1902, “It may be news to many druggists that Dundas Dick & Co. were the original makers of soft capsules in this country, having introduced them to the medical profession in 1865. It will not be news, however, to know that their Docuta Sandalwood capsules are being quite generally prescribed by physicians for diseases of the genito-urinary organs. There is good profit in selling these goods and those unacquainted should write to Dundas Dick & Co., 112 White street, New York, for their literature.”\n\nDundas Dick, in his chemical and manufacturing laboratory, would come up with all kinds of medicines and cures along with his Tape Worm Capulets such as Sandalwood Capsules, Castor Oil Capsules, Seidlitine Seidlitz Powders, Thermaline and eventually his Congress Bitters in 1879 or so. He brought capsules to America and invented and patented many machines for facilitating and producing capsules in a cheaper way.\n\nHis bitters were so popular, they would sell all the way up to 1908. I suspect the C 215 Congress Bitters amber square listed in Bitters Bottles might have been his first bottle while the C 216 amber rectangular bottles were his work horse. This bottle is rated scarce but they are out there. Is it the Congress Bitters bottle related to Dundas Dick? Probably so, but we will not know until a labeled example shows up.\n\nThe postal card below from the Joe Gourd collection certainly ties the Capitol trade-mark card to his card. Note that it says “Please send one doz. Congress Bitters, with the framed Show Card and Advertising matter…” The bottles analyzed in Kansas were 12 ounces so that also matches the bottle sizes noted in Ring and Ham.\n\nDuring his years in the patent medicine business, Dundas Dick made several fortunes which indicates that he lost the same in intervals. In the late 1880s, Dundas seemed to have been suffering from mental health issues. One report finds him arrested in 1887 for leaning against a lamp post and singing in a loud and inharmonious strains. When confronted, he said he had no home and he would do as he pleased. This sounds like onset dementia to me. His new partners at the time, James Hardie and Michael E. Finnigan, would bail him out at the local police station and take him to debtors quarters where he lived by himself with three nurses who were employed to care for him and see that the was not left alone, as he would often wander away or run off. A physician was also employed to give him the necessary medical attention. This help all cost money and it was said that his present wealth in 1887 was estimated at over $100,000 and that the had a nice income from property in New York City, Brooklyn and Flatbush.\n\nDundas Dick would die on April 1, 1893, on his birthday. He was 55 years old. His obituary said he died of paresis.\n\nThe Dundas Dick Co. would continue in business until 1906 or so followed by the Dundas Drug Co. until 1914. They were selling Quinine, 3-D Kidney Pills, Liver Pills and Stomach Pills at 502-4 Canal Street in New York City. The little bottle above contains Quinine with a Dundas Drug Co. label. That’s a 50 year run of the Dundas name in capsules, pills, medicines and the Congress Bitters, A Great American Tonic!\n\nDundus Dick & Co. were eventually listed in 1881 as manufacturing chemists located at 112 White Street in New York. The company and their products are represented nicely below. The select group of images are from an 1881 Dundas Dick & Company Thermaline Malaria Medicine booklet given out by druggist, J.

Sackett in the wholesale drug trade and practiced in Perry county for 15 years. It was during this period that his San Gento Bitters made an appearance. His advertising would say, “One Dozen Bottles Properly Used are more valuable than Twenty Dollars in Gold to anyone who has Diseased, Stomach Bowels or Kidneys, or Diseases of the Nervous System of any kind. The bitters were also “Prepared from pure Bourbon Whiskey.” The 1870 U.S. Federal Census, even listed his trade as a wholesale liquor dealer which is odd for a doctor. During this time, he took a post graduate course at the University of Louisville so he knew his destiny. In January 1892, Mitchell returned to New Albany were he continued his practice specializing in the treatment of nasal catarrh, throat and ear diseases until his death in 1915.\n\nThis unlisted and labeled Vegetable Stomach Bitters will be represented in Bitters Bottles Supplement 2.

Blown into a whiskey style mold, it pictures Sutter’s Mill “Fort”, which was ground zero for the California Gold Rush of 1849. This event, in turn, spawned the great westward migration which settled the “wild west”. I first encountered this particular example while a student at San Jose State in the early 1970s. The distinctive amber swirl through the mid section rendered it unique. After 45 years, I was finally able to add it to my bitters collection.

In 1893, Acme Chemical Co. advertised in the Times Democrat looking for a girl to past labels and pack medicine. In 1914 – 1919, they were renamed Acme Chemical Manufacturing Company and were listed under Patent Medicines making special preparations and were located at 517 St. Louis Street in New Orleans. They are even listed in 1930 at that same address.

We see him first listed in 1876 as a bookkeeper. In 1887, he was listed as a partner with his brother Leopold, (L. Sonnenschein & Bro.) in the jewelry trade at 179 Madison. In 1889, his brother Leopold was selling liquor at 223 Randolph. The same year the brothers were partners in real estate with Sonnenschein & Solomon (Leopold Sonnenschein, Fred M. Solomon and Otto Sonnenschein) addressing at 301 Opera House Buiding. Otto would take over the liquor end of the business in 1892 as O. Sonnenschein & Co. and by 1900 was listed as a liquor dealer in the U.S. Federal Census. He would operate until 1902.

During my research, I came across these other Continental Bitters and Old Continental Bitters ads.\n\nThe first is an 1864 advertisement for McCullough’s Continental Bitters advertised in Richmond, Virginia in 1864. (Richmond Weekly Palladium, Wednesday, March 16, 1864) This appears to be unlisted.

The bitters is listed in Bitters Bottles as T 26, Thurston’s Old Continental Bitters. It was prepared by George B. Thurston of Lynn, Mass. There are rectangular, aqua bottles out there.\n\nThis last article from Iowa in 1918 is titled “Bitter Scrap in District Court, Continental Bitters and Bitter Wrangle – Bitter Appeal to the Court.” The Continental Bitters that Theodore Keutchman, a local druggist, contained about 25% alcohol. He was arrested some years earlier. I’m really not sure what Continental Bitters is being referenced here.\n\n12 February 2019 | Tuesday\n\nHoofland’s German Bitters advertisement for the patent medicine showing a medieval scene. – Library Company of Philadelphia Print Department. According to Hoofland’s Almanacs, this eponymous bitters was “the happy result of intelligent research, coupled with the extensive practice of Dr. Christoph Wilhelm Hueflin (Hoofland) of Gena, Germany.” Dr. Hoofland’s Celebrated German Medicines were first being sold in Philadelphia at 278 Race Street in 1847.\n\nInteresting stereo card for the New Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane. Looks like the architect and contractor working in field. The Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, also known as Kirkbride’s Hospital or the Pennsylvania Hospital for Mental and Nervous Diseases, was a psychiatric hospital located at 48th and Haverford Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It operated from its founding in 1841 until 1997.\n\n11 February 2019 | Monday\n\nPost update: Tobias Barto and his Great Gun Bitters – Reading, PA\n\n09 February 2019 | Saturday\n\nAdvertisement for an O 82, Original Aromatic German Bitters put out by Charles Schneyer, Rectifier and Wholesale Liquor Dealer, Not. 154 and 156 Fairmount Avenue, Philadelphia – Philadelphia City Directory\n\n03 February 2019 | Sunday\n\nIt made my day when I pulled this bad boy out of the ground.

I found the token online for sale on eBay.\n\nRead: Excelsior Stomach Bitters – Rose’s Drug Store, Westminster, Maryland\n\nExcelsior Stomach Bitters – Drs. Ault and McGavern\n\nSt. John, Iowa\n\n01 January 2019\n\nI recently received, reviewed and responded to a couple of emails and newspaper clippings from Mark Wiseman, a well-known antique bottle collector from Iowa that included advertisements from Iowa newspapers for unlisted bitters including Adler’s Celebrated Anti-Cholera Bitters and Dr. Smith’s Magic Bitters from Council Bluffs, Iowa. One ad also mentioned the Celebrated California Bitters which was a mystery.\n\nI am now looking at an 1867 advertisement from Mark from the Sioux City Register below for an unlisted Excelsior Stomach Bitters manufactured by Drs. Ault and McGavern in St. John, Iowa which is a small town that is not around anymore. Mark included the ad with his email and included an advertisement from the bitters agents, Smith & Moore of Sioux City, Iowa.\n\nHere is Marks email:\n\nHi Ferdinand, first of all, I wanted to thank you for all the work you did on the bitters ads I had previously sent you. I have really enjoyed your research, on each one, and I have saved them for future use maybe in the Iowa Antique Bottleers Newsletter, if that would be OK with you in the future?\n\nI have been looking for more bitters advertisements at the State Historical Library on microfilm that you might be interested in. I have looked and looked. Today I finally found a real teaser. It also is from 1867. The ad started on June 1, 1867 in the Sioux City Register newspaper. It is for “Excelsior Stomach Bitters” Manufactured by Drs. Ault and McGavern, of St. Johns, Iowa and sold by Smith & Moore, Sioux City, Iowa. There is no St. Johns, Iowa anymore.\n\nI do have this this initial information from the book, Abandoned Towns, Villages and Post Offices of Iowa by D. C. Mott, reprinted from the Annals of Iowa Volumes XVII & XVIII, 1930-1932.\n\nHarrison, County, Iowa: “Saint Johns. A town in sections 27 and 28, Saint Johns Township, on the southeast side of the Boyer River and about two miles southeast of the present city of Missouri Valley. Platted in 1857 and an important town in its day. Post office, 1858-71”\n\n(New Saint Johns. The name first applied, but only for a brief period to the present city of Missouri Valley.) (Old Saint Johns. The name applied to Saint Johns in the later years of its existence.)\n\nI have attached three photos of the advertisement, and will follow with the first advertisement from Smith and Moore on June 9, 1866.\n\nI hope you can have some fun with this. The Iowa 1875 Atlas had nothing.\n\nYour Friends, Mark and Jimmy the Pup\n\nI was able to find the following support information related to Mark’s email. I embellished the map below with graphics so to better understand the locales discussed. Just click to enlarge.\n\n1868 History: St. John Township, Harrison County, Iowa\n\nMissouri Valley, Harrison County, Iowa\n\nMissouri Valley is beautifully situated at the foot of the bluffs, is one mile from the Boyer River, six miles form the Missouri and at the junction of the C. & N. W. Railroad and U. P. & S. C. Railroad. It contains one hundred dwellings. The population is about 600 hundred. The freight agent, Mr. Waldo Abell, of the C. & N. W. Railroad Company, informed me that during the winter months of 1867 and 1868, the net income of this office was $35,000 per month. The township now has six school houses, in each of which are taught from six to nine months of school.\n\nMissouri Valley Businesses\n\nT. E. Brannen, attorney at law; P. D. Mickel, attorney at law; J. M. Riley, saddler and harness maker; H. C. Warner, wholesale and retail dealer in general merchandise; R. McGavern & Company, dealers in hardware and agricultural implements; Smith and Cogswell, carpenters and joiners; McGavern & Hull, dealers in drugs; D.A. Babcock, dealers in stoves, tinware and farming implements; J.C. Enke, plaster and brick layer; McBride & Birchard, druggists; L. S. Snyder & Company, dealers in stoves, tinware and hardware.\n\nHere is a newspaper advertisement below from 1867 from the Sioux City Register noting that Sharpe & Clark were architects and builders in St. John, Iowa in 1867, the same year as the bitters ad.\n\nSt. John Township, Iowa\n\nAccording to the Iowa State Gazetteer: St. John is situated in the southern part of the county, six miles from the Missouri River. It has one general store. Population 30.\n\nSt. John was located in Missouri Valley, Harrison County, Iowa pretty much across the river and due east from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nHarrison County was organized in 1853, and from that period up until 1857, the south part of the county constituted a precinct for voting purposes, and held elections at Harris Grove. In the summer of 1857, the township of St. John was organized.\n\nIn 1851, Mr. William Dakan, an enterprising farmer, settled here. It was again two years before any additions were made to the number of these enterprising men. This year (1853), William Spencer, John Deal, John Hatcher, Champion Frazier and others settled here and commenced preparing farms.\n\nIn the fall of 1857, a company was organized consisting of Robert and George McGavern, John Deal, G. H. Cotton, E.W. Bennett, Noah Harris, P. J. Purple and James A. Jackson. The company was organized the 27th day of August, by selecting Robert McGavern, president; E.W. Bennett, secretary. The object of this company was to lay off and build up a town; consequently, the town of St. John was laid out, and building immediately commenced.\n\nHarvey & Woodruff opened a store that fall and Jacob Preston opened a hotel which he called the Boyer Valley House, and soon sold out to Jacob Fulton. A school house and some dwellings were built the same season. The winter not being favorable, improvements now ceased until spring, when there was a general waking up all over the township, and improvements went ahead. This year the town built a school house, the best then in the county. Thus improvements went on until wildcat banks failed all over the country, ruining a great many good business men, and casting its blight on old and new towns.\n\nBut railroads build towns, and in 1867 the cars made their appearance one mile northwest from St. John, the New St. John was laid off; since, however, the name has been changed.\n\nAdam Thompson Ault\n\nAdam Thompson Ault was born on August 20, 1822 in Clark County, Ohio. Ault, a physician by trade, was the son of Jacob Ault and Elizabeth Moler. He settled with his family in Johnson County, Iowa about 1839. He eventually moved to Shelby and Harrison County, in the western area of the state and partnered with George Henry McGavern to manufacture Excelsior Stomach Bitters for a very short period of time.\n\nAult married Mary Ann Barnett in Ottumwa (Wapello County), Iowa on 17 October 1847. They had at least four children: Mary C. (1849-Wapello County), Lily Dale (1855-Harlan), Harvey J. (1858-Harlan) and Frank A. (1859-Harlan). He was the brother of Margaret Emily, Emery and Eliza Jane Ault.\n\nThe Iowa State Historical Society noted in the History of Franklin County, Iowa, that a Dr. A. T. Ault, in 1855-56, was named a commissioner to select a seat of government for Franklin County.\n\nDr. Ault was one of Harlan, Iowas’s first doctors and on August 1858, Ault plotted territory for Harlan. Harlan was named for one of Iowa’s early U.S. Senators, James Harlan. Harlan was designated the county seat in 1859. The town was incorporated on May 2, 1879. Harlan was also very close to St. John, Iowa which was also in its infancy.\n\nLooking at various federal and state census records, Ault shows up in at least four Iowa counties: Shelby (Harlan), Franklin (Hampton), Jasper (Newton) and Harrison (Missouri Valley – St. John) where the Excelsior Stomach Bitters was made. He also could have been a land agent according to some references as Ault is listed in court records as the defendant in what appears to be several lot disputes. Interesting to note, a trip by horse was estimated to cover 20 – 40 miles per day so it is plausible he often traveled back and forth between the counties in his concern.\n\nIn 1860, Ault, 38, and James M. Long built the first Courthouse at the corner of Court and Seventh Street in Harlan. Later, Dr. Ault, with A. L. Hasvey and L. W. Woodruff, kept a small general merchandise store that could be pictured below. On September 4, 1858, Ault called to order the first meeting of the Shelby County Agricultural Society (the precurser to the Shelby County Fair Board).\n\nDr. Ault would then muster as a Union Captain of Company C, 22nd Iowa Infantry, on 22 August 1862 in Newton, Iowa. He became badly ill during the Siege of Vicksburg, and resigned his commission on 8 August 1863.\n\nLooking at 1866 tax records, we see that Dr. Ault would purchase a Manufacturer license for $10. This was probably for his bitters as it was in 1867 that we see Drs. Ault and McGavern in St. John, Iowa, manufacturing Excelsior Stomach Bitters. The new drug concern, Smith & Moore (B.F. Smith and M.F. Moore) in Sioux City, Iowa were noted as the sole agents for the Northwest covering Iowa, Nebraska and Dakota. They had just opened a new drug store and were selling “Pure, Fresh and New Drugs!”, “Popular Patent Medicines”, “Wines & Liquors (for medicinal purposes only,” and paints, oils, dye stuffs, cloth, tooth, nail, paint and varnish, brushes, trusses, supporters, shoulder-braces, hair oils, pomades, fancy soaps and toilet articles. Their terms stated that they would taake greenbacks, gold dust urchin, in small quantities.\n\nDr. Ault lived his later years in Hannibal, Missouri and Arkansas after the Civil War. In his 1881 pension application, in which he claimed he was totally disabled from his wartime illness, he described himself as 5′ 10″ tall, with dark hair and blue eyes.\n\nDr. Ault died on October 04, 1883, age 61 in Perry County, Arkansas.\n\nDrs. George Henry McGavern and Robert McGavern\n\nGeorge Henry McGavern was born on March 8, 1819 in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. His brother Robert was born in May, two years later. Their parents were George McGavern (1778-1853) and Nancy J. Ewart (1782-1861). It is not known what brought the brothers, in the 1850s, to Missouri Valley in Harrison County Iowa where George Henry practiced medicine and his brother operated a hardware stored sold farm equipment. George Henry was noted as a county pioneer and an eminent physician, and the leading medical practitioner in that part of western Iowa up until the 1880s.\n\nOn October 15 1849, Dr. George Henry McGavern married Lucinda Fosnancht in Wyandot, Ohio. They would have seven children. He would become chairman of the first board of supervisors of Harrison county, and in 1870, he was its representative in the State Legislature.\n\nIn the fall of 1857, in Missouri Valley, Iowa, a company was organized consisting of Robert and George McGavern, John Deal, G. H. Cotton, E.W. Bennett, Noah Harris, P. J. Purple and James A. Jackson. The company was organized the 27th day of August, by selecting Robert McGavern, president; E.W. Bennett, secretary. The object of this company was to lay off and build up a town; consequently, the town of St. John was laid out, and building immediately commenced.\n\nWe see both brothers living in St John through the 1860s so one, if not both, are associated with the Excelsior Stomach Bitters.\n\nDr. George Henry McGavern died at the home of his daughter on the 16th of January 1895. Robert would die one year later.\n\nThe Bottle\n\nLike many unlisted bitters that only existed in a moment of time, there are no examples of the Ault & McGavern Excelsior Stomach Bitters bottles, at least that I am aware of. The bitters was probably only made for a year, if that long.\n\nThere is however, a listing in Bitters Bottles (E 65.5) for an Excelsior Stomach Bitters with Ault & Hammer embossed on the bottle. It is square, amber, has three sunken panels and was dug on a farm in Western Iowa. I would really like to see this bottle. Obviously a huge piece to this story.\n\nIt appears that there were two druggist in Des Moines, Iowa at this time; Alfred Hammer who is reported to have opened a laboratory for manufacturing photographic chemicals in 1870 in Council Bluffs and his brother Alvin. Alvin G. Hammer was a druggist on the East side of Des Moines while his brother Alfred was a druggist on the west side of the Des Moines River.\n\nThere is also a listing in Bitters Bottles for an E 66.5 and an E 66.7 labeled Excelsior Strengthening Bitters, Des Moines Pharamacal Co. which would have been Alfred Hammer bottles.\n\nMark Wiseman, in a twist of irony, drives by the old Alvin G. Hammer, painted and ghosted graphics below each time he goes to the Iowa State Historical Library.\n\nAlfred Hammer\n\nAlvin G. Hammer and his older brother Alfred Hammer were engaged in the drug business in Des Moines. Alfred was brought to America during his infancy and was educated in the public schools of Mayville, Wisconsin, until 1866, when he took up the study of chemistry at Milwaukee under Gustavus Bode, state chemist. In 1870, he came to Iowa, settling in Council Bluffs, where he established a chemical laboratory and began the manufacture of photographer’s chemicals and also the reduction of gold and silver in conjunction with the conduct of a drug store. In 1872 he disposed of his business there to his partner and came to Des Moines, where he accepted a position with Dr. William Baker, then the oldest druggist in Des Moines, with whom he continued for two years. In 1874 he established a business of his own at the southeast corner of Court avenue and Second street, in a building vacated by George M. Hippee & Company, druggists.\n\n[, Volume 14, 1892]\n\nMr. Alfred Hammer (pictured), who has been in the drug business here in Des Moines for over twenty-five years, has just returned from the far West, where he spent several months. True to the instincts of his craft, he visited drug stores everywhere he went, and, in an interview graciously accorded the writer, related many interesting things concerning the same.\n\nAt Salt Lake City he saw and was entertained by Charles Lewis, formerly of this city. Mr. Lewis is doing well. At Portland he met Dr. Plumber, a prominent and wealthy wholesaler, who made a tour of the retail stores with him, and there are many fine ones in that thrifty city. The finest store he saw was in Oakland—says, indeed, that “there is not a single cheap Jim Crow drug store in that city.” No more was there in Victoria or Vancouver. But his account of a visit to a Chinese drug store in San Francisco was the most entertaining of all. He entered this ridiculous store—size about 16×20—bearing a letter of introduction to the proprietor, which same letter was written in Chinese. Not one single feature of the conventional American drug store was visible to Mr. Hammer as he gazed around this dismal room, although he wore his glasses. One side was all drawers clear up to the ceiling, but not one of them was labeled. He did finally get sight of an old army scale. The proprietor showed him various drugs, such as horrid dried snakes and a lot of nasty dried lizards—big ones. These, he said, were given to cure fits, and both were very salable. He next showed Mr. Hammer some pieces of ginseng root brought from China, costing him $50.00 an ounce. The ginseng, he said, was used as a charm, and he kept it very carefully; indeed, he took it out of a box which was inside of a box, and that box within yet another. In the back room was a fellow at work with a wooden mallet pounding and flattening out roots on a sort of butcher block. There were no mortars, no graduates, no bottles or glassware, and no liquids in any form whatever on the premises. Everything was dry, even to the little dried-up Mongolian who operated the ranch. It seems they fill no prescriptions. Doctors carry their own medicines with them buying their supplies of dry medicines either off him or at the other place, for there is one other similar establishment in the city. The proprietor asked Mr. Hammer, as he bid him good-by, if Americans made any money at the business? The reply must have been very satisfactory indeed, for Mr. H. assured him, with a broad smile, that “some did and some didn’t.”\n\nIllustrative of the truths contained in a statement made in a previous letter to the effect that drug stores were fast becoming general information bureaus. Mr. Hammer told me that he never once in all his travels, asked information from a policeman; he invariably went into a drug store with his questions.\n\nThere is also a listing in Bitters Bottles (E 63) for an Excelsior Bitters with no name embossed or associated with the bottle.

The plaintiff, for the use of the school fnnd, claims of the defendant, S. J. McBride, the sum of two thousand dollars, on account of various alleged sales of intoxicating liquors to a minor, and to persons in the habit of becoming intoxicated, during the year 1875.\n\nNo personal judgment is asked against the defendant, McGavern, but it is alleged that during the time of the sales he owned the building in which the sales were made, and he is made a party for the purpose of establishing a lien upon the building for any judgment recovered against McBride. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff for $400.\n\nThey also found specially that the defendant, S. J. McBride, did sell or give away intoxicating liquors in the drug store occupied by him, in Missouri Valley, Harrison county, Iowa, with the knowledge and consent of Geo. H. McGavern.\n\nThe court rendered judgment against the defendant, S. J. McBride, for the sum of $400 and costs, and declared that the judgment be a lien upon the building in which the sale was made. The defendants appeal.\n\nMichel dfc Brown and W. S. Shoemaker, for appellants.\n\nNo argument for appellee.\n\nDay, J.—I. As the appeal of the defendant, McGavern, presents for our consideration distinct questions, which have no connection with the question of the liability of the defendant, McBride, we will, in the first place, consider such questions as affect McGavern alone; and, in the second place, such as affect McBride alone, or both defendants together.\n\n1. The defendant, McGavern, owns the building in which the alleged unlawful sale was made. Section 1558 of the I Iktoxica- Code provides that all judgments of any kind saieGtoqmTM: rendered against any person, for any violation of upon the the provisions of the chapter relating to intoxicapiemises. ting liqllorS, shall be a lien upon the premises and property occupied and used for the unlawful purpose, by the person manufacturing or selling in violation of law, with the consent and knowledge of the owner thereof. The petition in this case charges the defendant, McBride, with violating the provisions of section 1539 of the Code, in that he sold intoxicating liquors to a minor, and to persons in the habit of becoming intoxicated.\n\nThe jury found specially that S. J. McBride did sell or give away intoxicating liquor in the drug store occupied by him in Missouri Valley, Harrison county, Iowa, with the knowledge and consent of George H. McGavern. The defendants moved in arrest of judgment upon the ground that the special finding of the jury does not show that defendant, McGavern, had any knowledge of and gave consent to the sales of intoxicating liquors testified to by the witnesses on the stand, within Cobleigh v. McBrlde the year 1875, and for which plaintiff claims forfeiture to the school fund. The action of the court in overruling this motion, as to the defendant, McGavern, is assigned as error. In our opinion, the motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained. Simply selling or giving away intoxicating liquors, if done without permit, or for an unlawful purpose, is one offense. The selling or giving intoxicating liquors to a minor, or person intoxicated, is altogether a distinct and more aggravated offense, for which a more severe punishment is prescribed. In order that a judgment for a violation of any of the provisions of the chapter relating to intoxicating liquors may be a lien upon the premises in which the unlawful act is done, owned by a third party, such person should have knowledge of and assent to the unlawful act on account of which the judgment is recovered.\n\nThe special finding in this case does not show that McGavern had such knowledge, or that he gave such assent. It did not authorize the declaring of the judgment a lien upon his premises.\n\n2. The court instructed the jury as follows: “18th. If you find that the defendant, Geo. H. McGavern, bought intoxicating liquor during the year 1875 of the defendant, S. J. McBride, or if he sent other persons there for that purpose, this would be such knowledge and consent on his part as would bind the building owned by him, and authorize you to find against him.” This instruction is erroneous for the reasons already considered. Even if McGavern had knowledge that McBride was selling intoxicating liquors, his property would not be liable for a judgment recovered, unless he knew McBride was selling to minors or persons in the habit of becoming intoxicated.\n\nSeveral errors have been assigned by McGavern relative to the admission of testimony, which need not be considered, as the cause must, as to him, be reversed for the errors above discussed, and the same questions will not likely arise upon the re-trial.\n\n1883: Capt Adam Thompson Ault, Death Date: 4 October 1883, Death Place: Perry"
