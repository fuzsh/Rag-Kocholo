Novel written in 1953 and published in Orbit Science Fiction, supposing an agency with unlimited powers which controls the destiny of men.\n\nMisuse of drugs ...\n\nIn its first years of writing, at a time when magazines was paying popular authors the amount of text produced, Dick, unknown author, was trying to live to produce batch texts and to take this infernal workload, was taking amphetamines.\n\nThis resulted in a dependence he could never break even if there have been ups and downs of remission followed by relapses.\n\nSometimes in lack of pharmaceuticals, he came to get them in the streets and eventually go to hospital after having ingested more than doubtful mixtures.\n\nOnly in the last years of his life, when finally getting enough popularity, Dick was able to live as he wished and perhaps to heal.\n\nBut he died in March 1982 of a devastating heart attack, his body no longer being able to resist to the results of mistreatment while in the course of its existence.\n\nWhat they said about the death of Dick ...\n\nScience-fiction writers about the death of Philip K. Dick:\n\n\"I have been saddened to open the New York Times to learn the death of Philip K. Dick (...) now the saga ends but we do not knew the outcome.\"\n\nFrederik Pohl.\n\n\"No writer of his generation had such an intellectual presence. It is engraved in our memories and in our imagination, too. His last novel, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, abounds in hunches to his death.\"\n\nBrian Aldiss.\n\n\"Readers and friends of Phil receive an invaluable legacy. In this sense, he has not left. But my God, how I miss him!\"\n\nPaul Williams.\n\n\"I saw Phil for the last time around Christmas. (...) But neither he nor she (his girlfriend), nor I never imagined how much would run the rest of his life.\"\n\nRay Nelson.\n\n\"Philip K. Dick was buried in the tomb who had waited all his life on the small plot he now shares with her twin sister died at birth.\n\nShe also had expected, throughout the time when life held, with this strange patient who is the prerogative of the dead. \"\n\nMichael Swanwick.\n\n\"Two years ago, I received a letter from Phil asking me to pass an test to assure him that I was his friend Adam Davidson and not some impostor.\"\n\nAdam Davidson.\n\n\"The only position to be taken when an event as monstrous and unacceptable that the death of Philip K. Dick is (to say) in four-twenty million years I would probably give lesser importance to that. \"\n\nRobert Silberberg.\n\n\"I kept the distinct impression that he was among these people who constantly want to destroy themselves.\"\n\nJohn Brunner.\n\n\"The comfort that I find the day of his death is that it took time to write a work as wise and courageous. He knew where he was going and I think he left as a man who smiles you over his shoulder while going away. \"\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin.\n\n"
