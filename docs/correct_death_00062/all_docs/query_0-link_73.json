Cecil Henry Francis \"Ces\" GERAHTY [13546] (Cecil Edrick Thomas GERAHTY [12860]420, Digby Augustus Edward GERAHTY [1397]187, Augusta Louisa LOADER [1394]100, Lousia Caroline DARE [1389]72, Louisa Caroline JULIUS [771]43, William [685]16, William of Basseterre [687]6, William R N (Capt) [689]4, John of St Kitts West Indies [691]1) was born in 1917 in Charters Towers QLD. He was usually called Ces.\n\n677. Mary Kathleen \"Kath\" GERAHTY [21231] (Cecil Edrick Thomas GERAHTY [12860]420, Digby Augustus Edward GERAHTY [1397]187, Augusta Louisa LOADER [1394]100, Lousia Caroline DARE [1389]72, Louisa Caroline JULIUS [771]43, William [685]16, William of Basseterre [687]6, William R N (Capt) [689]4, John of St Kitts West Indies [691]1) was born in 1919 in Charters Towers QLD and died in May 2006 aged 87. She was usually called Kath.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nKath Gerahty - Memories of her family and life in Northern Queensland.\n\nI was born in Charters Towers in 1919. Three of my family were born in Charters Towers: my brother Ces, he was the oldest; then two years later there was me, Mary Kathleen (but I was known as Kath); then my sister Lily. Mum and Grandma taught us school. We had chairs and a little table and we had school at Manfred.\n\nWhen Mum finished her boarding school education she went back to Manfred and worked at the hotel for her father. Dad was a fencing contractor working on stations around Manfred, and that's where he met Mum and that's where they got married. When Grandfather was killed, around 1916, the hotel passed to my parents. I lived there until I was nearly 7.\n\nThere was no town at Manfred, just the hotel. Our companions were mostly picaninnies. The dark lady who looked after us, Mary was her name, she lived at the Aboriginal camp on the river bank in a shanty made of timber and tin. \"Black Mary\" had two little girls. I think she had a little boy too, but I can't remember much about him. The black kids never wore a lot of clothes and Grandma reckoned it wasn't right that little girls, or little boys, didn't put clothes on. Nothing for little picaninnies to have no clothes. So when the Afghan came on his camel, she'd buy a roll of floral material, cretonne they used to call it, and she'd make dresses for me and my sister and Mary's two little picaninnies; all the same, the four of us. Mary used to walk us to the river - we didn't live far from the Flinders - and Grandma would make out that she couldn't tell us apart because of the dresses, each with a frill around the neck and a sash around the middle. She'd shake her head: \"Oh, those four little girls. I can't tell the difference\". And two as black as ink and two little white ones. Black Mary had a store of native folklore.\n\nWhirlywinds were common at Manfred. They'd swirl and roll, move around and go anywhere, picking up grass, leaves and dust. They could be huge. Mary told me to point a finger at it if I saw one coming towards me and it would veer away. I'd see the Aboriginal kids squealing and running about, pointing their fingers at a whirlywind so that it wouldn't hit their shanties - or them. The Afghan and his camel train used to come to Manfred regularly. He'd have all these goodies on the back of his camels in big cane baskets. Lots of people came in from the properties to have a look at what the Afghan had. Word of mouth it was, that the Afghan was at Manfred. I still remember him wearing his turban and his long shirt, I used to call it his nightshirt, Mum would be there, buying whatever she needed for herself or the hotel, and anything she thought would be okay for a Christmas lolly stocking. We always got a book for Christmas and it was usually The Girls Own Annual, and it was thick. But we never got much else, other than a lolly stocking with toys and games in the top part, and in the foot, lollies. One Christmas morning we gets up. Lily had a stocking with an umbrella in it. I spotted the umbrella and I claimed it - my lolly stocking. Lily put up a fight. It was her lolly stocking and her umbrella.\n\nOne of my aunties told me years later that I should have had a hiding every day, that I always wanted what somebody else had. Well, Lily and I fought over the umbrella until one side was ripped. It was made from Japanese plastic-paper-looking stuff; paper that had been waxed over. Very pretty, but you can't tell that from the photo. Mum said to share it, but neither of us wanted to share that umbrella. She took a photo. We're both standing there; Lily holding her Christmas book, and me holding this darn umbrella that's ripped on one side\n\nWhen Dad got a big fencing job on Fort Constantine, he decided to sell the hotel and move to Cloncurry so that his three children could go to a proper school.\n\nI was happy amongst the dark children at Manfred. They were our companions and we played with them - and wonderful people, too, the blacks - but when I went to school in Cloncurry and saw all these white children, I felt uncomfortable and created a stir. I clung to the bannister, screaming and kicking, and they couldn't get me up or down the stairs. They told Mum to go home and leave me to the teachers. Miss Calem, she came and told me I could sit near her and I could help her teach. All the baloney. But still and all, it worked. I quietened down. I was the teacher's pet, or so I thought.\n\nIn 1928 my mother was having another baby - brother Bill - but he was only a couple of weeks old when Mum got septicaemia and died. She left four little kids; the oldest was 10 and the youngest was a baby of a couple of weeks. My brother Bill - an aunt came and took him. She said she would take the new baby and rear him. That left Dad with three children, and if he'd moved into Cloncurry to look after us he would have had no money coming in. His job was on Fort Constantine, yard building, fencing, fixing windmills, things like that. He spoke to his sister, Hilda Winton, about what to do. She was a stepsister really, a child from a second marriage. Auntie Hilda had five children of her own, but she decided that she would take the three of us. So, in 1928 we went to Julia Creek to be with Auntie Hilda.\n\nDad stayed working on Fort Constantine and other stations. He supported us and came to see us, but he never lived or worked in Julia Creek, he was backwards and forwards from Cloncurry. I left Julia Creek in 1950, that's how long I stayed. It was a wonderful little town and I still have only fond memories of living there. Well, there were eight children in the Winton house in Coyne St. It was a special house, two houses built as one. What happened: there was a mining town called Kuridala out towards Mount Isa, and when they closed the mine all the houses were put up for sale. Grandfather Hornung (Auntie Hilda's father), he went out and bought two houses, put them end to end and added a verandah on three sides. The house was quite large. We used to sleep . . . . . there was my sister and me and Mary Winton, the three of us slept in a double bed; the boys were on the verandah; and the baby slept in the cot. Grandfather Hornung had a room to himself, as did Auntie Hilda and Uncle Bill, though Uncle Bill was hardly ever home, he was a drover. The dinner table in the Winton household was nearly as long as this dining room and kitchen combined. It had to be, to fit everyone in. Grandfather Hornung sat at the head, and the children all sat round. You never spoke a word - only to ask if you wanted something. If you wanted the salt and the pepper you'd say: \"Salt and pepper please\" and someone would pass it. No jumping up from the table, no talking out of turn; nothing like that. As regimented and reserved as mealtimes were, they lost some of their formality - and we thought we were made - when Auntie Hilda brought home a tablecloth printed with pink roses. Auntie Hilda bought bread from Bally Kaeser if she had enough money, and if she didn't, she'd make it. And she'd make jam. I longed for the day when I could have bread and butter and jam, because we were allowed bread and butter, or bread and jam, or bread and syrup, but you couldn't have two spreads together. We didn't even ask, we knew we couldn't have it. Things were rather tough. We never had meat other than goat, and we never had milk other than goat; yet we always had food - we had lots of goats. Even now I imagine that I can smell goat when I see goat's milk. Butter came in a tin about so high, a 7-pound tin. By the time you got near the bottom it was smelly, there was no way of keeping it properly. Auntie Hilda had a hole dug in the shade under the house. She'd put the tin of butter in the hole and then bits of charcoal all around it. Then she'd cover it with a wet bag. It was remarkable how cool it kept. Eventually, of course, it got smelly (that's why she kept it outside in the hole) and she'd use it to make brownies, a cake with sultanas and currants and spices in it. We used to think brownies were marvellous.\n\nGrandfather Hornung worked at the woolscour. He was a windmill expert too; he'd go out and fix windmills. And to earn extra money at home he made iceboxes and sold them to the town people. Around the outside of the iceboxes he put charcoal, held in place with wire netting covered by hessian. He'd go over to the coalstage with a bag, picking up pieces of charcoal of the right size. The inside of the iceboxes he lined with tin. Wasn't like a refrigerator, it wouldn't freeze, but you could put things in it and they'd keep lovely and cool. He was a stern old man, very strict about children behaving themselves, and we were frightened of him. There was no such a thing as playing up because he'd put a stop to it straight away. And if you wanted to have a fight you did it when he wasn't watching. But I can remember once being very sick and I went to his bedroom where he was lying down reading. I stood in the doorway so he'd notice me, and he said: What do you want, love? I feel sick. He got up and came over. He was kindness itself.\n\nThere was a family at the back of us called Murrays. Mrs Murray, Auntie Hilda and Auntie Emily (that's Albie Wilder's mother), they'd put chairs in the laneway between the two houses and they'd sit and gossip after tea, while all their kids, and there were plenty of us kids, played rounders. Rounders was a bit like baseball - three bases and you hit a ball with a bat. When it got too dark for rounders we sat in a ring and the bigger boys told ghost stories. I'd be too frightened to get up and move by the time they'd finished: \"And the dead men will come and get you if you play up\". They'd frighten us to pieces, all in good fun. Then when it started to get real dark Auntie Hilda would say: \"C'mon kids, home to bed\", and we all went home. Every Saturday we hoped that Auntie Hilda had enough money to send us to the pictures so that we could see what happened to Rin Tin Tin and the woman he saved from being run over by the train. Rin Tin Tin - the dog who could do anything. We sat in the front on forms; girls one side, boys the other. Why, I don't know. We were more interested in Rin Tin Tin, the darn dog, than trying to have a romance with a boy. That came later on when we were allowed to sit in the canvas seats. Up the back was where the Aborigines had to stand. They didn't congregate with us - or weren't allowed to. And really, they had the best position in the house. When I left school, after Scholarship, the headmaster tried to help Dad get me into St Gabriels in Charters Towers as a boarder. He suggested that I be a working pupil. Some of my jobs would have been to wait on the tables and help wash up. But Dad objected; he wouldn't entertain the idea. So then I had to find a job. They had what they called the Cottage Hospital in Julia Creek. It was a house that they'd turned into a hospital. It had two rooms upstairs, one for the men and one for the women, with two beds in each. Downstairs was the quarters for Sister Needham. Doctor Hogg was the name of the doctor. Sister Needham wanted someone who was interested in a nursing profession. I wanted to be a school teacher, really, but that went by the board, and at 14 I went to work for Sister Needham. She was a tough lady too; she worked me really hard for the 10 shillings a week I earned. One day we had a falling out and I decided that I wasn't going to be there any longer. She came round to the house that night and said she wanted me to stay till I was 17 and then I could go to Charters Towers for training to be a nurse. I refused. She'd got my back up. I had no job then until I went nannying. There were people in Julia Creek by the name of Davis. He was a teamster, Bill Davis. He had one of the loveliest homes in Julia Creek. His daughter Tibby had a little boy and she wanted someone to mind him because she used to dressmake. I applied for the job and I got it. Malcolm, I have to say, was allowed to do pretty much anything he liked and I wasn't allowed to chastise him. I used to bath him, dress him, comb his hair - he had lovely light brown curls - and take him for a walk every afternoon in the pram. Well, then the fun would begin. He'd pull his hat off and throw it on the ground. Tibby told me he wasn't to take his hat off outside, so I'd bend down, put it on his head, go to push the pram - and the next thing the hat's on the ground again. He'd be kicking his legs and carrying on. It all got too much. I wanted a job that paid better and that maybe I could advance with.\n\nBill Gannon was looking for a waitress. I went to see him and told him I'd never been a waitress. He said that was okay and gave me the job. I still remember how much he paid me - L3/6/4 a fortnight - and I had my own quarters. I was branching on 17. I worked at Gannon's Hotel for ages, all through the war. Sunday was our day off. If anyone had a truck - there was a bloke called George Regan and he had a truck - we'd go for a picnic out to Eddington. We'd bring along the food and the homemade ginger beer. We'd eat, talk, and everyone would go for a swim. Some of the boys might go fishing. Every Sunday something was on. We always went somewhere.\n\nThe dances and balls were everything. Girls got a new dress for a ball. After the races, all we could talk about was going to the ball that night. They were big time and everybody went. You missed out on something if you didn't go to the balls. You danced till 3 o'clock. Many a time I went home to the quarters, changed out of my dance clothes, got into my work clothes, and started work at Gannons at 5 o'clock in the morning. You just danced. You didn't ever want it to finish. For my deb I asked Mrs Wilkins to make a new dress for me. She owned a little dress shop and I was friendly with her. I said to Wilkie: My deb's coming up, Wilkie, and I need a dress. Well, you buy the material and I'll make it. She decided she'd make it a bit different from the normal dresses. It had a cape collar with frills on it. Didn't charge me anything either, which was good because I never had a lot of money. Three people judged the Belle of the Ball at my deb. You didn't have to raise any money; they judged it on how you behaved, how you were dressed, who looked the nicest. And they chose me. I didn't get a tiara or anything like that, just a sash they pinned on. Then I took the floor with my partner. We danced and everyone joined in. And that's all it was. It was no big deal being Belle of the Ball, yet it was an honour.\n\nWhen I first saw Nugget at a dance in Eckford's Hall I thought he was the biggest lair that ever had two legs given to him. He could dance, there was no doubt about that, but he used to lair too; he'd show off. That's how I felt about it. In spite of that, I was hoping he'd ask me to dance. You sat along the wall and you had to wait for the boys to come along and say: \"May I have this dance, please\". That's how they asked you. I was hoping he'd come over and ask me, but he didn't until the dance was nearly over. He had manners and he spoke nicely. We danced. I thought to myself: He can show off as much as he likes (I didn't change my view that he was a show-off), but underneath it all he's a good bloke. Bill was his name, Bill Stanley, but they called him Nugget. There was a chap named Dick Magoffin and he used to play the saxophone at the dances. And he could play it. One night we were doing the Pride of Erin. Nugget kicked his leg in the air, lairising again I reckon, and came down with a crash and a big white patch on his back. They used to put boracic acid, or boracic something on the floor, and it was white. He's lying on the floor with the wind knocked out of him, and this mad Dick Magoffin comes over, lays next to him, and continues to play the saxophone while everyone dances around them. I didn't think it was funny. Didn't think it was funny at all: Are you going to get up? I'm too winded. I'll stay here a bit. Dick Magoffin only encouraged him: \"Don't get up Nugget. I'll lie here with you and play\". Never missed a beat either. So I had to turn on my heel and walk over and sit on the side. Somebody said to me: \"I don't blame you Kathleen. He was drunk and couldn't even stand up\". But Nugget never drank. Lairised, but never drank. In those days, a boy would come over and ask you for a dance, and if he said: \"Will you save the medley for me?\" (that was the formal asking), you knew that he wanted to walk out with you to take you home. I was at a dance and Nugget came over. By now I'd seen him a couple of times at dances. I was friendly with his sister and she was always singing his praises, telling me what a wonderful man he was, and telling him what a lovely girl I was. Our romance was half her doing, I think. We had a dance and then Nugg said: \"Will you save the medley for me?\" He walked me home to Gannon's Hotel. Bill Gannon told all his girls that he didn't want any men hanging round the quarters. If they walked you home that was all right, but there was no hanging around. You said goodnight and went into your quarters. And you didn't dare disobey Bill Gannon, I can tell you that. Nugget said goodnight and gave me a peck on the cheek. He went home and I went into my room. Another dance came up and he asked me if I'd go with him. He asked me to go to the pictures. It just sort of blossomed from there. I was only 19 when I got married, a month off being 20. Really, you could say I was 20. I was married in 1938. Nugg bought me a lovely engagement ring. We had to send away for it because there was no jeweller in Julia Creek. We had a catalogue that had pictures of engagement rings and a card with holes in it. You measured your finger in the holes. We picked out a ring that had two hearts and a diamond in the middle. It didn't cost a lot of money, but it was a lovely ring, really nice. So we announced our engagement. The Younger Set of the CWA gave us a little party. You had to bring something to the party (everyone used to buck in ) because well, nobody had a lot of money, let's put it that way. We decided we'd get married at the end of the year, in the December. I said: \"It's no good us getting married if we've got nothing\". And Nugg said: \"Well, I've got 50 in the bank\". Fifty pounds was considered a fair amount of money, without being rich, and I had 25 myself, but we didn't think it was enough. We'd have to wait till Nugg started in the shearing industry the next year. We both wanted to get married, but it was sensible, y'know, that we not rush into it. Nugget loved a horse. He loved racehorses. Come Melbourne Cup day he said to me: \"There's a horse I like in the Melbourne Cup, Kath, and it's at long odds. If I put a pound on it I can win a hundred.\"I told him to back it to come last, because if it was 100:1 it wouldn't have much of a chance. Lo and behold if it didn't bob up 3. We married in Julia Creek on the 19th of December at St Barnabas, the Church of England, thanks to the money the horse won for us. We held the reception at home. Nugget in his youth was a butcher. He served his apprenticeship in Richmond with old George Jaques. George's son, also called George, had a butcher shop in Julia Creek till just after the war when he moved back to Richmond. Sometime during 1950 young George decided to sell out of his Richmond business and he asked Nugget would he like to buy in. Nugg was pressing at the scour and we didn't have much money. George offered us good terms: whatever money we had plus so much a week. He had a liking for Nugget. My husband was no angel - he liked to gamble, he liked a racehorse - but he didn't drink and he didn't smoke. He was a clean living fellow, really, and George liked him. We talked it over and decided to give it a go; to leave Julia Creek and move to Richmond. The best part of Julia Creek as far as I was concerned was the companionship. Everybody seemed to be your friend. The Kaesers (Bally Kaeser was the baker), they had all these children, yet Mrs Kaeser was ready to do anything for you. And if you wanted to go somewhere, there was always someone who would help. My memory may be dim about a few of them, but I've never forgotten the people who lived in Julia Creek. If you wanted a friend, well, there was always one waiting around the corner.

Albert Norman \"Albie\" WILDER [12880] (Emily Jane GERAHTY [12864]422, Digby Augustus Edward GERAHTY [1397]187, Augusta Louisa LOADER [1394]100, Lousia Caroline DARE [1389]72, Louisa Caroline JULIUS [771]43, William [685]16, William of Basseterre [687]6, William R N (Capt) [689]4, John of St Kitts West Indies [691]1) was born on 24 Jul 1925 in Charters Towers QLD and died in 2009 in Townsville QLD aged 84. He was usually called Albie.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nKindness Itself - Reminiscences of Albie Wilder.\n\nWe lived in Goldring Street next to Kaeser's bakery in a house that came from the mining town of Kuridala. That's our backyard and that's the house. See how it's up and down in a valley? It's actually two houses put together. Dad and my step-grandfather, old Hornung, did that. Over on the right you can see a part of the bakery. That stick on the left, that was our see-saw and merry-go-round all in one. It was just a post in the ground with a piece of timber across and a spike down the middle. We'd get on it and spin round-n-round or go up-n-down.\n\nMary Winton and I are playing on it one day and she wouldn't get off - and I wanted her to get off. I had a tomahawk in my hand: Get off or I'll cut ya! And still she wouldn't get off. So I aimed to go close but I got her on the foot. It's a wonder she didn't tell you about that. Anyway, the evil deed was done on that stick. The other stick on the right, that's the prop for the clothes line; you can see the wire.\n\nThe front of the house was the same as the back except it had beds on the verandah. We used to get under there as kids - the verandah was three steps off the ground. From the front gate to the door there was a hedged walkway. It was a salt bush hedge that went all the way around the house. On the corners, and on both sides of the gate, Clive built it up like a rampart. It was his job to keep it trimmed.\n\nAs you walked in the front there was the main bedroom on one side a lounge on the other, then you came through a passageway to two more bedrooms, and then the dining room. Beyond that, right at the back you were in this great big kitchen the full width of the house. You can see the chimney for the stove sticking out above the alcove on the bakery side.\n\nWhen you wanted a bath you went out to the wash house in the backyard through the gate in the hedge. You can't see the wash house its off to the side. And of course, further down the back was the thunderbox.\n\nAll us kids lived in that house. There was five of us, then there got to be six, and then there got to be Pat.\n\nAlbie Wilder\n\nI was born on the 24th July 1925 in Charters Towers. And the reason for that was: the family was living in Julia Creek but when one of us was to be born Mum always went to the Towers. Mum and Dad met there. I think they came to Julia Creek around 1912 or 14 and more or less used it as a base.\n\nDad was a teamster, drover, fencing contractor. Mum used to go with him until there were too many kids. After 1922, when Herbie and Biddy started school, she stayed in town. Dad would work at anything. When the council couldn't get a dunny carter he took that on for a while. He didn't have much schooling behind him and couldn't read or write, but he was learning. Towards the end he could write his own name. He was Common Ranger when he died. I tell you what happened to him. He was on Mick Byrne's property, Wallacooloobie, woolpressing. There's a lever with a pawl on it that drives a ratchet mechanism. You push on the lever and the pawl presses the wool down. He had it just about down and the pawl broke; the lever sprang back and hit him under the heart. Well, he was quite sick for a while there, and he decided that we were all going to his brother's place for a holiday, a milk farm out from the Towers.\n\nAt the Cape River a fella was bogged - it was all sandy roads. Dad had no tow rope so he gets out and helps push. He was a big powerful bloke. When we got to his brother's place he felt tired and went to have a lie down. They got tea ready and then Mum tried to wake him. He was dead. His heart was strained too much by pushing the car, plus the damage from the accident on Wallacooloobie. He's buried in Charters Towers. I was three 1928, yeah.\n\nMum was left with all us kids: Herbie, Biddy, Hilda, Clivey, myself and Donny - six kids. And then Pat, seven kids. She married Mick Skinner soon after Dad died. Nick was a navvy. He'd work at anything, anything at all; a bit like Dad. He started a little fruit shop in Julia Creek and did all right in that. They called him Mick but his name was Percy. He was a good bloke, too - treated us really well. It couldn't have been too long before he married Mum because Donny was a baby in arms. Eventually they had Pat, their only child. He's a half brother, Pat. He's a Skinner and we're all Wilders.\n\nOne of the first things I can remember about Dad is his car when he was the Ranger. It was one of those rag hood models, a 1924 Dodge, and my one recollection of that is: Mary Winton and I were toddlers and we hid in the car and did a round with him on the Common. I also remember he had a harness shed down the back with all his droving gear and horse collars hanging up. We used to get on them and swing. Anyway, one day it broke and down we came. I wouldn't have been much older than three.\n\nWe never had shoes as kids, and our feet cracked and bled with the cold weather in winter. I'd go out to the scour, playing, and bring home lanoline, the grease scoured from the wool. Mum rubbed it into my feet. By jeez, it fixed them up.\n\nJimmy Brisbane and I used to sneak into the scour and play there when it wasn't working. We'd climb inside the drier - at the end of the scouring tanks - and crawl up-n-down the chute. We'd come out upstairs where the wool was, in these big rooms about the size of this house. It was blown there through the chute; all fluffy white stuff banked up in a heap ready to be bailed by the presser on the next shift. It looked just like snow. The electricity in it tickled hell out of you. You'd dive in amongst the wool and your hairs would start standing up on your arms.\n\nTwo brothers, Jim and Joe Eckford, had the picture theatre. Joe was the one who went round town and put the posters up. You'd say to him if you saw him in the street:\n\nWhat's on at the pictures tonight?\n\nTwo goodies - a cowboy and anothery.\n\nHe'd take your tickets as you went in the door. Anyone throwing their bumper away - the cigarette butt - he'd pick it up and put it out. He had a tin of them and when he wanted a smoke he'd get this needle, pick out the tobacco and he'd fold a cigarette. And the old bugger had money. That's Dadie's uncle.\n\nThe pictures, well, we only got a go at them every so often. As you went in you bought your ticket. There was a counter selling lollies, peanuts and little bottles of soft drink. Or, if you wanted to, you could go down the back and get big bottles. They only had little bottles at the counter. When you went in - down the front near the screen - over this side were the boys and over that side were the girls. And it was funny: as soon as the lights went out you'd see heads going across. Then you'd see Jim Eckford; he'd be out the front with a torch, shining it round: \"Get back to your seat:\" And he'd chase the boys back to their seats.\n\nWe had a pet cockatoo that went to the pictures with us. He'd fly ahead and sit on the fence waiting till we caught up. Sometimes he'd come in and other times he'd stay outside. He talked like a thrashing machine. I'd come home after school: come up the back, open the door and throw my school bag in and he'd sing out: \"Albie's home, Albie's home. Get the goats Albie, get the goats.\" Get the goats, that was my job. And of course, Mum'd know I was home and tell me to get the goats. We had him a long time. He was still there when I left Julia Creek.\n\nI was out getting the goats once near the coal stage, and being a kid curious, I pulled up. We used to play around the coal stage, climb it sometimes and have high jinks. Here's this swaggie and he's cooking sausages. They used to jump off the train during the Depression and get in underneath the piers of the coal stage and camp. They were like flies leaving the train before it got into the station (called \"Jumping the Rattler\" it incurred a fine if caught). I hadn't seen too many sausages and I was there looking, drooling.\n\nHe said to me:\n\nHey kid can you play draughts?\n\nYes mister.\n\nWell, it's your move first. If you don't get out of here I'll cut your bloody head off.\n\nI thought I was gonna have me a game of draughts and a sausage. I never went back near the coal stage for a while.\n\nAdie Sills used to come around delivering fruit and vegetables in a horse and cart. There was even a Chinaman gardener in opposition. Fancy having gardens in Julia Creek. Adie's garden was over on Hilton Park, but the Chinaman's was\n\nin town; quite a little farm affair, growing everything. As you were going out to the cemetery you turned left into Coyne Street and the Chinamen was along there on the north side. He used to hessian bag his lettuces to break the heat. He made a little frame, only so-high, and stretched a bag over it - hose the bag and that kept the lettuce cool. He'd come around with two cane baskets over his shoulders. As soon as he picked them up he had to start jogging; that was the only way he could carry them.\n\nOver the road from the Chinaman lived a Japanese fella, Harry Kamada - he was the laundry chap - and the\n\ntwo of them were always squabbling. Harry had wooden steps over his fence - step step step - instead of a gate. One\n\nday coming home - I didn't know the difference, being a kid, I thought they were all the same race - I said to Harry:\n\nDo they have these steps in China?\n\nYou bloody bastid - you calla me a Chinaman, I'm not bloody Chinaman. . . . .\n\nAnd I off. That night I was looking around to see if Harry was after me because he'd already been in strife in Julia Creek. He was in love with this. . . . . I'll probably think of her name in a minute - but she was married (Mrs Gertrude Hall). There was another bloke involved too. They had a fight and Harry pulled a dagger out and into him with it. (Emily Skinner rang the Police to report the affray).\n\nAt the age of twelve I was in the Cloncurry hospital for three months with rheumatic fever. It affects your heart. It leaves it with a murmur and it's weakened. When I came out of hospital I had to keep away from sports. I wasn't to get excited, that was the thing.\n\nAround that time a new head teacher arrived, Arthur Cann, and he was a horrible old turd. I was halfway through fifth grade, just back from hospital, and this old bugger used to belt hell out of me because I couldn't get the grip of learning. It wasn't long before I left school, although I did go back for two weeks when the education train came out. One carriage was for the girls and one for the boys. The girls learnt dressmaking and cooking; the boys learnt tin smithing, woodwork, how to make chairs, and things like that. The two carriages parked on a side line just down a bit from our house. I went to it twice - the second time only because I liked woodwork. I'm pretty sure I'd left school by then, at grade 6.\n\nMy first job was with Bert Pollard. He was the undertaker and I was going to do an apprenticeship with him as a builder of coffins. Oh, he had the foulest mouth going, and his girls were just as foul mouthed. He used to talk with them any old how. He says to me one time there: \"Go and find that fuckin spanner. I told you not to lose the bastard.\" And I told him: \"Look, I've had enough of you. I don't have to put up with your swearing. I'm not one of your kids you're talkin to now.\" And I left and got a job at Jaques butcher shop.\n\nCharlie Byrne had a butcher shop in the main street and George Jaques had the other one in the front street. At the time I was getting 15/6 a week. All my other mates from school were in the shearing sheds getting two and three pound a week and their keep. So I said goodbye to the butcher trade and went out to the sheds. And from there I joined up.\n\nI was down at Gabba camp in Brisbane when they told me: \"You're out\". They gave me a little slip of paper saying: \"Temporarily medically discharged\" owing to heart whatever-it-was. That was on the 24th March, 1942. 1 remember Clive and his mate saying: \"Look at this lucky bugger; he's been kicked out of the army because he's temporarily medically insane\".\n\nI came back from Brisbane and I went into the shearing sheds again. I wasn't out there long; the heat got too much for me. I came to Townsville and got tangled up with the Americans, their Fifth Airforce. I was attached to them during the war. It was in Townsville I met my wife and we got married in '46. I've been back to Julia Creek several times since, but never to live.\n\nI liked the freedom we had as children in Julia Creek. You played here, you played there, you weren't frightened, you could go out and leave the house unlocked; you could come and go as you were able to - or let. Different nights we'd be at our place or at the Winton's, singing songs around the piana. On moon-lit nights we'd get out and play Crows & Cranes, Drop the Hanky or Red Red Rover. With Crows & Cranes there were two rows of children and there'd be one child calling. She'd sing our 'Crrrro. . . . . ', then change it to\n\nCranes'. The Crows ran off and the Cranes had to catch them.\n\nWe had good times playing those simple games; and we had good times at the fancy dress balls, too. Mrs Petersen organised them. She had this Grand March and she'd parade us round-n-round in Eckford's Hall. That's Clive, he went as a swagman. In the background you can see a miniature wagon. Another brother, Herbie, he used to yoke that wagon to the goats. He had all the team stuff, the bridles and yoking gear, and he'd go over to the railway with a team of four goats and cart cinders around town. Herbie went to old man Tracey, he had a store:\n\nDo you want any cinders Mr Tracey?\n\nYes, Herbie, how much a load?\n\nHerbie told him so-much.\n\nHow many loads you want, Mr Tracey? Oh, you keep bringing them and I'll let you know,\n\nBut there must have been some misunderstanding because Herbie loaded up every bit of cinder he delivered and brought it home and spread it around our place.\n\nI was in the Grand March as a baker boy one year, carrying a tray full of little buns and wearing an outfit with 'Baker' on it and\n\nEat More Bread'. Bally Kaeser made the buns and the other kids were stealing them off me. I wasn't selling them;\n\nthe mickie loaves were just advertising his bread. Mickies were a little bread roll, If Bally had dough left over he'd make balls out of it and put them in the oven, All us kids'd go to the bakery after school: \"Ya got any mickies today, Bally?\" and he'd hand them out.\n\nBally was a little nuggety bloke about so high and he had a big belly on him. He'd often get drunk and come home singing in German. He had a whole heap of daughters and three sons: Joey, Albie and Kenny. The two older boys were going off to war and Bally's drunk one night, crying and saying to Joey: \"You're going over there and you'll be shooting your cousins\".\n\nHe made excellent bread. You'd go a long way before you'd find any better. In those days the stores didn't handle bread. You couldn't buy it from them. You had to go to Bally and get fresh bread from him; or if he had stale bread he'd sell you that at a cheaper rate - or give it to you. There was a heap of us Wilders and we wouldn't have known much about bread other than old Bally would bake a bit-extra and pass it over the fence to Mum:\n\nBut I've got no money, Mr Kaeser.\n\nThat's all right. The goats will be getting it if you don't take it.\n\nWe were poor, yeah. We'd come home - you know how kids come home today and ask for a biscuit or an orange? - we'd come home and we'd ask Mum: \"Have we got any crust of bread?\" And if there was, we'd get the dripping, it was real black, and put it on the crust and sprinkle salt and pepper on it. That was our afternoon special.\n\nWe knew we were poor, yet we were quite happy. Never really wanted for any-thing. We grew vegetables and had our own goats. Still, we never had the things that others had. There was no money for shoes a lot of the time. I'd go to school bare footed. In the winter out there, as I've mentioned, it was very cold and my feet'd be cracking. Lanolin helped, but I remember Mum giving me two shillings to go to A J Smith's and buy a pair of sandshoes because my feet were that bad, Two shillings would also get you a pound of butter - a pat of butter - and a dozen boxes of matches. Two shillings would get you a lot, those days.\n\nRef: This delightful reminiscence by Albie Wilder is from \"Tanksinker\" by Guy Burns Published. 2009 - This magnum opus by Guy on his grandfather Max Burns and the people of Julia Creek Northern Queensland is a fascinating look at 20th C. life in the Queensland Bush.\n\nSee https://sites.google.com/site/tanksinker/Home/max-burns-tanksinker\n\nAlbie married Evelyn Maud FLETCHER [15191].\n\n685.

Jack writes: \"My early childhood was happy, not only because of the care and love my parents bestowed upon me, but also because they were living in comfortable circumstances. Their house facing Abdin Square where the Royal Palace was situated, had a vast marble floored hall and a wide marble staircase.There was a huge kitchen which L would raid with the aid of the Sudanese cook. My parents often entertained on what seemed to me a lavish scale, and from the top of that marble staircase l would surreptitiously watch the guests arriving, the men always in formal evening dress the ladies in long gowns and long white gloves. And then from the railed garden l would watch the soldiers changing guard at the palace. Sometimes there would be a full parade whilst at other times horse drawn carriages would arrive at the palace for some reception or other. I thought the soldiers very smart. And the mounted police, an elite corps, were splendid, mounted on grey or white Arab horses, and when there was a formal occasion they carried lancers pennants.\n\nI was never a robust child, in fact, by all medical standards of that era, I was lucky to survive for our doctor had given me up for lost when l developed a severe attack of bronchial pneumonia. If it had not been for the care of a second doctor, a Mrs Elliot and the constant and devoted nursing of my mother, I would not be writing this today. Later, when I was about 5 years old I was seriously ill with measles which was complicated by a bad attack of ophthalmia, and I had to have both eyes bandaged for more than a week.\n\nWhen l was about 6 years old we went to live in Gezira, a fashionable island suburb on the Nile. We had a tall featureless house, built l suppose during the early Victorian years, but it was cool and well appointed. And it was within easy walking distance of the Gezru Sporting Club. Amongst the multitude of facilities here was a large children's playground, and my sister and l spent many hours with friends here. It was here that I received my first cricket lessons from a vast Nubian called Sambo. About this time too l went to my first school, run by a Miss Quibel and my father began to teach me French using a bright pink book called, French without tears which started of with an exciting story about 'Jean a une plume' whereas 'Henri a un canif'. Most of the European children were in the charge of nannies, that worthy but now almost extinct breed of, women who played a large part in the lives of their charges. But I can only remember one of ours, called Bessie, who was short and buxom, but a kindly lass. Like many of her ilk, she was fond of the British soldiers and after many flirtations, married one.We then had a governess called Miss Dalton, a very severe, forbidding, stringy female. Once when l was suffering from some childish disease she retreated to her room with a supply of food and locked the door. She did not emerge for a number of days, and when she finally did, she was promptly dismissed. l had a number of friends, including my first girl friend who was American and several years older than me. We had lots of parties, and at one Christmas party Santa's clothes caught fire, and he was so severely burnt that he never recovered. l was so horrified that henceforth l would dread having any Santa Claus at a party.\n\nI recall one occasion in early 1914 when a team of French aviators came to Cairo to give a display of flying.At Heliopolis we witnessed what was then the amazing feat of looping the loop. Then in the summer of that year, when I was 9 years old, my parents decided to send me to school in England because the standard of education in Cairo was not good enough! They chose Pinewood School in Farnborough, Hampshire. It proved to be a pretty rotten school, and my time there was neither very happy nor rewarding. The school building was a large, gaunt Victorian country house, and there were extensive playing fields and plenty of woodland. The house itself retained it's 19th century plumbing system, and the lack of heating was accentuated during the war years when fuel became scarce.The headmaster was a vicious little man called Mr Bull who rampaged about the place with great speed but seemingly to little purpose. He had a fearsome handlebar moustache, and he wore his fingernails long.He was excitable and quick of temper, and he wielded his cane severely and often. I suppose he must have had moments of even temper and gentleness, but I don't remember them.\n\nFarnborough was a major Royal Flying Corps station, and there were constant flights of slow moving bi-planes in the skies above the school. There were airships, and searchlights at night. Twice I saw a British plane hurtle to the ground, not shot down, but falling in flames due to some mechanical failure. Troop convoys passed by the school. We knew a war was on!\n\nAt school we suffered terribly from the intense cold, and also from time to time from shortage of food. Food rationing was strict and quantities were meagre.We were regularly fed with horse meat, dark dangerous looking stuff and as tough as our leather boats. It is no wonder that Mr Bull dictated that we should have forty bites of each mouthful! Potatoes were doled out as though they were precious stones, and other vegetables consisted solely of Swedes, turnips, and well boiled cabbage. Supper consisted of a mug of cocoa and one very hard biscuit. Breakfast was a plate of porridge and one slice of bread and dripping. Holidays were always something of a problem with my parents stuck out in Egypt. Most holidays were spent with elderly relatives, deep in the countryside of Sussex near the small village of Rogate.This was the home of Col. Nixon and his wife Edith, and they lived there with their youngest daughter Dorothy. Their house was named \"Commonside\", and it was nearly 2 miles from the village. Whilst it was a charming old house with a beautiful garden, it was a cold and damp place. Water had to be pumped daily from a well, and hot water drawn from a wood fired boiler in the scullery. Lighting was from oil lamps. There was an inside lavatory, but I was made to use an outside one. There was no bathroom, but there was a tin hip-bath, and the colonel kept a strict rote list for making use of it. When it was my turn, I had to carry the bath upstairs to my room, and a canvas sheet as well. Then I had to carry large cans of hot and cold water upstairs to fill the bath. And, having got myself clean, I was then obliged to reverse the procedure. What a performance all that was. I had to lend a daily hand at chopping wood, and drawing up water. The colonel had retired from the Royal Engineers, and he had served far many years in India, Burma, and South Africa. He was a typical British soldier of his time, Victorian and imperialistic in attitude, a martinet and a strict disciplinarian. He was probably a damned good soldier, and although he was straight-laced, conservative and narrow-minded, he had a heart of gold and would never have harmed a fellow creature intentionally.\n\nThe holidays were pretty boring for a young lad. Family prayers were conducted every morning and evening by the colonel, who seemed to enjoy reading dull passages from obscure prophets. On Sundays, come hell or high water, we had to march to the village church to suffer further mournful intonations from the local parson. No games were allowed on Sundays. The war had prevented me from spending my holidays in Guernsey with uncle Vernet (Vernet Quilter) and aunt Ethel. I was there with my sister in 1914, and was not able to visit them again until 1919. This was the only place where I enjoyed my holidays! They had a large straggling house on the west coast, at Coba, called Mare de Carteret. There were lovely gardens and woods, and a duck pond,and they had a donkey and trap in which we would ride to town. And they had four friendly goats called Golden eyes, Homer, Big Brownie and Little Brownie. Vernet was an architect by profession, and he had an excellent reputation for the quality of his work., but he was not a very good businessman. He would often do work for people he knew could ill afford to pay, and he never bothered to press for payment. Aunt Ethel was a person of prodigious energy, managing the house and cooking vast quantities of food for us, but she still found time to play badminton and endless bridge. There was also a Miss Green who helped. She was a very timid and pale person, and I think she was retained as a help more or less as an act of charity. Looking back at my prep school days I realise that I was far from happy, either at school or during the holidays. I missed my parents far more than I understood at the time, for I did not make friends easily, and I retired into myself to an unwarranted degree. I was not utterly miserable but certainly not joyous nor carefree, and whilst I may have acquired some self reliance from this experience, I surely became a bit of an introvert and somewhat suspicious of the world about me!\"\n\n691.

(She is the fifth daughter of Stanley Villiers Julius, (8-18) & is the second last 'block' on the GAJ 1939 tree.\n\nThere are sure to be some mistakes certainly among some of the early entries, such as the St. Kitts ones. You will find occupations, Baptisms etc. in Val's lists.\n\nThe other large packet of papers was laid out originally by my father and typed by my elder daughter and has had further details and personal information added over the years. The numbers in red on the 1939 tree correspond to the numbers in this file.\n\nWith regard to sub-chart D. Frederick Gilder JULIUS family, I would be very interested in any further information on any of the NZ people such as Elworthy's, Wlson's, etc. Over the years I have met a few of them, John & Hester Elworthy being the couple we saw most on their frequent trips to Australia. All other sub-charts need updating too!\n\nA copy of \"Notes on the Julius Family\" (1939) by GAJ, which you may have, is enclosed, so, if not wanted please pass on.\n\nDo you have any copies of \"Julius Jottings\", a family magazine (1900-1) seven editions I think, edited by Julius A. BREWIN. If you do not have these - I have some very rough photocopies of them. I will try & find some photos & send copies when I go through the heaps of paper etc. that I acquired a couple of years ago. Although my father died late 1989, a great deal of books, papers etc. were not passed on to me or my brother George.\n\nWe knew very little about the \"brown\" areas of the 1939 tree (I was responsible for colouring all the little squares when I was about 12 years old), until Graham was transferred in his job & we moved to Brisbane. in 1958. An elderly woman, Miss Goldie, was working there. She turned out to be a relation & so we were able to contact some of the family. We found most of them lived in or around Brisbane or in the north-west of NSW. Over the years we have met quite a few of them. Small world!\n\nYou will be up and away on your trip before long, what a good time of the year to go. We went to Suffolk and Norfolk when we spent two years over there in 1950/51. We have had one trip since then.\n\nGAJ was born in Norwich and Archibald Aeneas JULIUS spent many years there as a Minister and is buried in Southery,which is near Norwich. Unfortunately I did not know much about the family then, but I am very interested in anything you may find during your research.\n\nI think Castleacre Priory is in this area (I may be wrong). The de Venci family came over to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. I do not know if they built the Priory but lived there for many years. The name changed over time and with alterations became WANSEY. My mother's maiden name was WANSEY. The Priory used to be open to visitors but when we took my mother there in 19511 think it had been taken over privately and was closed to visitors. If you should be in the area I would appreciate any information that you could gather.\n\nI'm not a good letter writer so please let me know if you have any other information I can send. By the time you return to NZ I hope to have all my records a great deal more organised. I am also helping to get the SHELLSHEAR tree up to date!\n\nWe are going to Sydney from 8-29 May, staying mostly at Gosford north of Sydney with Graham's brother and our son Rod.\n\nRod is bulding a lovely house there for Michael who has just retired.\n\nBest wishes for a safe and happy trip overseas and I look forward to meeting you one of these days in the not too distant future.\n\nPlease keep in touch.\n\nJenifer was the the source of much of the Julius data that came to ELF, also Val Hancock nee Julius from Brisbane supplied most of the data on the descendants of Archibald Aeneas Julius whose 5 boys all came to Australia.\n\nE L Fenn.\n\nJenifer married Kenneth Graham SHELLSHEAR [4011] on 5 Jan 1952 in Shore Chapel Nth Sydney N.S.W.

Through the 1990s and early 2000s Elworthy steered Pyne Gould Corporation (PGC) through a period of significant change. He became recognised as one of Canterbury's most capable and influential business leaders.\n\nFamily members say his death was a shock. He believed his cancer was a thing to be beaten. If it could not be beaten, he should not burden others with that knowledge. The first indications of the disease prompted Elworthy's retirement in 2005, after 14 years as managing director of PGC. He had earlier served as chairman and managing director of PGC subsidiary Pyne Gould Guinness (PGG) a major Canterbury farm services company.\n\nElworthy grew up on the family farm on the hills above Sumner. In a family of six he was the second of three brothers. He was educated at Waihi School and Christ's College, where he attained high academic success and made many lifelong friends.\n\nA life spent working indoors was not a natural step for Elworthy, coming as he did from a family farming and outdoors tradition. So it was with some initial reluctance that he set his course, attending Canterbury University and graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1967. He then joined BGG in a clerical position.\n\nHe married Annabel Wigley, daughter of the redoubtable Harry Wigley of Mount Cook tourism fame, in 1969. The couple then headed overseas. Elworthy worked in London for two years before they returned to Christchurch and raised their family of three children.\n\nHe rejoined PGG in 1971, in a financial services role with the wool and stock department. In the following years he became widely known and respected in the business world and progressed to the position of financial controller. This role made him a central figure in planning the restructuring of the business, including the establishment of PGC as the \"umbrella\" company in 1987. By then he had made the unusual step to managing director while being chairman of the board, of PGG.\n\nElworthy was made managing director of PGC in 1991. He led the company through a dynamic decade of change and growth. He oversaw the formulation of nationwide financial services division Marac, through the acquisition of Allied Finance. He achieved the mergers of PGG with Reid Farmers and Wrightson's, respectively, and the acquisition of Perpetual Trust from AMP. He was involved in the listing of PGC on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.\n\nHe was admired for his commercial acumen, eye for detail and chairmanship skills. He was always thoroughly prepared, inclusive and decisive. The loss and suffering of many colleagues and friends in the collapse of the PGC building during the February earthquake had a huge impact on him. PGC chairman Sam Maling says Elworthy was \"very much in control of the expansion and redirection of the business\" from 1991 to 2005. He remained on the board of PGC after his retirement, until standing down in 2009. The need for further reshaping of the business was not being considered in 2005 and had no influence on Elworthy retirement. His health was \"definitely the catalyst\", Maling says. He was a determined character and a man of integrity. He was diligent and very able, Maling says.\n\nElworthy enthusiastically performed the role of honorary Consul for Sweden in Christchurch, for fifteen years until 2009. He saw this interest, away from business, as a welcome challenge. In retirement Elworthy held non-executive directorships with passion and dedication. He drew satisfaction from working with the Hohepa Charitable Trust And Human Ware Limited. His most enduring legacy was his service to St George's Hospital, described by Hospital Society president Craufurd Murray as \"over many years, a wonderful contribution\". He served on the advisory committee for four years from its establishment in 1999 and was a board member from 2003 he was appointed chairman of the Cancer Institute Trustees Ltd board at its first meeting in 2008. With fellow board members, Elworthy raised funds to establish and equip the Cancer Care Centre at St George's Hospital. Oncologist Chris Wynne said of Elworthy's service: \"every time a patient is treated and painful symptoms relieved, every time a family's concern and stress is eased, every time a patient is cured, we will remember Richard's contribution to the well-being of others.\"\n\nHis many interests included golf, skiing, sailing and travel, duck shooting in flyfishing. But it was his family and especially his grandchildren, who gave him the determination to overcome his condition during the past rewarding six years.\n\nRef: The Press Christchurch 27 August 2011.\n\n713.
