        "text": "Before making the acclaimed 2001 horror movie The Others, Spanish director Alejandro Amenábar fashioned this 1997 mind-bender about a vain man (Eduardo Noriega) disfigured in a terrible car crash caused by a jealous ex. As he puts his life back together, he begins to have strange visions that suggest what he perceives as reality might not be real. (For one thing, his jealous ex and his new love, played by Penélope Cruz, start morphing back and forth.) Hollywood remade Open Your Eyes as Vanilla Sky, and both films play with dreams and surrealism in a way that would have made Dick proud. The movie argues that beauty is skin deep, but the mysteries of the human brain are unfathomable, even terrifying.\n\nRichard Linklater has made one straight-up Dick adaptation, A Scanner Darkly in 2006. The author also looms over this free-flowing 2001 animated film. In the movie, Wiley Wiggins plays a young man who wanders through different states of unconsciousness. In one of them, he actually hangs out with a guy portrayed by Linklater who tells him a story that Dick once told about writing his novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said. Wiggins' character then encounters real-life situations that echo the plot of his book, only to discover that his book and the real-life incidents unknowingly copied elements of the Book of Acts from the Bible. It's a trippy tale suggesting that time itself is an illusion. It's probably no coincidence that when Linklater made A Scanner Darkly he used a similar rotoscoping animation technique he'd incorporated for Waking Life. Both movies seem to exist in a dreamier alternate reality than the one we occupy.\n\nIn 1973, just as Dick was cementing his literary legacy, German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder adapted a work by one of Dick's contemporaries, Daniel F. Galouye. The book Simulacron-3 became the movie World on a Wire, and it envisioned a creepy scenario in which an entire simulated world exists, its inhabitants having no idea they're not real. Dick explored the life-is-a-simulation idea way back in 1957's Eye in the Sky; in this movie Fassbinder uses the conceit to question whether VR could become just another way for those in power to oppress the weak. The 205-minute made-for-TV juggernaut was difficult to find until a restored version debuted in 2010, exposing a new generation to Fassbinder's glum portrait of our unhappy future. World on a Wire's cowriter, Fritz Müller-Scherz, said in 2011, \"in this film there is one main theme, which lies at the center of all [Fassbinder's] films: power, dependence, manipulation and the exploitation of feelings.\" Those issues are at the heart of Dick's work, too.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a specialized thief who steals secrets from people while they sleep. But after running afoul of Ken Watanabe's villainous businessman, Cobb has to try the impossible: infiltrating someone's mind and planting an idea in his subconscious. Nolan mostly uses the reality-or-dream concept as a playground for stunning special effects—especially during a bravura, gravity-defying action sequence—while focusing on Cobb's inability to let go of his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). While Inception allows one of Hollywood's best big-budget showmen to reveal his more romantic side, it also turned P.K. Dick's preoccupation with the unconscious into a blockbuster.\n\nDavid Cronenberg nearly made a feature-length version of \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" years before Paul Verhoeven adapted the Dick short story for Total Recall. \"I think that there's material in Philip Dick's work to make 100 movies,\" Cronenberg said in 2003. \"I'm really quite surprised at how few there have been.\" The author's unease regarding our technology-driven future plays out in several of the director's movies, most prominently in 1983's Videodrome, in which a cable-TV president (James Woods) becomes obsessed with extreme sex-and-death videos. As critic Gary Indiana has pointed out, the film recalls Dick's 1965 novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch about a drug that's incredibly addictive but also leaves the user susceptible to other people's commands. In the hands of Cronenberg, such addiction is merely a symptom of a maddening modern world.\n\nDescribing his debut feature film Pi, writer-director Darren Aronofsky once said, \"It preserves the tradition of [Rod] Serling and Philip K. Dick in that it works the lines separating paranoia, insanity, and genius.\" That's a perfect encapsulation of Pi's anxious spell. It tells the story of a brilliant mathematician (Max Cohen) who may have unlocked the secrets of the stock market, if only he can keep from losing his mind in the process. Working with composer Clint Mansell and cinematographer Matthew Libatique, Aronofsky creates a supercharged atmosphere that seems to be vibrating with the thrill of scientific discovery yet is infused with dread that our main character could unravel at any point, as shadowy forces seem to be conspiring against him. Where other filmmakers have borrowed Dick's high-concept ideas, Aronofsky adopted the author's pessimistic tone, seeing science fiction as a way to articulate the angst of our modern age.\n\nNew Zealand filmmaker Andrew Niccol pursued Dick-like themes in sci-fi dramas such as Gattaca, S1m0ne, and In Time. The best of the bunch was his screenplay for The Truman Show, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey as a ordinary guy living an ordinary life with no idea he's the subject of a 24/7 reality program. The film bears a strong resemblance to Dick's 1959 novel Time Out of Joint, in which an ordinary guy slowly realizes his entire life is a construction. In The Truman Show, that narrative decries viewers' thirst for \"reality\" programming—a craving that's only grown in the 20 years since the movie came out. But the movie also pokes holes in our thin grasp of what's real. Take the love we think our wife has for us or the friendship our longtime buddy professes. Is everybody just acting? The Truman Show is billed as a comedy, but its underlying themes are deeply upsetting the more you think about them.\n\nDuring a talk in 1977, Dick espoused a theory that might have seemed bonkers if some random dude was yelling it on the street. \"We are living in a computer-programmed reality,\" the author claimed, \"and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs.\" Twenty-two years later, that fantastical hypothesis became the foundation for The Matrix, the Wachowskis' breakthrough sci-fi hit that depicted a future in which a lowly computer programmer (Keanu Reeves) discovers that humanity has been secretly enslaved by the machines they created. Paranoia meets special effects wizardry in The Matrix, with the movie's innovative \"bullet-time\" selling the dazzling dystopia the Wachowskis dreamed up. The so-so sequels may have diminished the luster, but the Dick-ian brilliance of The Matrix still shines.\n\nScreenwriter Charlie Kaufman wrote a script for Philip K. Dick's A Scanner Darkly that never got made, but he's incorporated some of the author's reality-bending musings in his other work. That's most apparent in the magnificent film that won him a Best Original Screenplay Oscar. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman (and director Michel Gondry) introduce us to Joel (Jim Carrey), a sad sack who learns not only that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has dumped him but that she's visited a company that will erase him from her memory. (To get back at her, Joel decides to undergo the same treatment.) This is the sort of ingenious idea that could have powered a Dick novel, and the movie has a field day exploring the moral and philosophical implications of rewriting one's reality. Plus, Eternal Sunshine is just flat-out heartbreakingly romantic, the film existing in Joel's memories as he's simultaneously trying to wipe her from his mind and save the moments that made them such a great couple in the first place. This is Philip K. Dick for the date-night crowd, losing none of the author's intelligence or wariness in the process.\n\nIf Kaufman had wanted to make the Dick homage more apparent, Eternal Sunshine could have easily been called We Can Forget It for You Wholesale."
