        "text": "March 2, 2022 marked the 40th anniversary of the death of science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who happens to be buried in Fort Morgan’s Riverside Cemetery. A few fans gathered at his gravesite on that Wednesday afternoon to honor the author’s legacy and the impact his works have personally had on their lives.\n\nExpert and longtime Philip K. Dick fan Dave Hyde has been bringing fellow “Dickheads” — the humorous self-proclaimed nickname of PKD fans — together and holding festivals for over a decade.\n\n“I firmly believe that this man here is the best writer, the greatest writer of the 20th century. And I’m not the only one. There (are) millions of us out here who do,” said Hyde.\n\nThe first festival Hyde held was in Blackhawk, Colorado in August 2010. After its success, he made plans to hold a festival every two years. It has been held in multiple locations over the years, everywhere from PDK’s childhood hometown of San Francisco in 2012 to right here in Fort Morgan, the site of his burial, in both 2017 and 2019. The next festival was originally scheduled to occur here again in 2021, but the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a cancellation.\n\nBecause Hyde did not want to rush the planning process for a 2022 festival, he eased back into the event with the small March 2 gathering at PDK’s gravesite. Those who could not attend in person, however, were able to submit letters to be read aloud, many directly addressing PKD and thanking him for his contributions.\n\n“Phil, not just today, but most every day, I’m reminded of your contribution and impact within our collective cultures. I first came to your writing in my youth right at an early period of questioning the world around me and the road ahead. Your writing, work, questioning, seeking and sharing of yourself had a profound effect on me in ways I can’t quite express,” read a letter from a fan in California named Zack Wood.\n\nAfter all of the letters were read, attendees took the time to sign their names on the “PKD Fanzone” banner, which has been collecting signatures from fans — including authors Rudy Rucker and Jonathan Lethem — at every festival. Hyde said he is considering donating the banner to Fort Morgan’s museum when there is no more room left for signatures, as employees at the Fort Morgan Public Library and Museum have been great partners over the years.\n\nPKD is most well-known for his novels like “The Man in the High Castle,” “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” and “Ubik.” Many of his works continue to be the inspiration behind films and television shows, like “Blade Runner,” “Total Recall” and the more recent Amazon Prime Video series “The Man in the High Castle,” which ran for four seasons from 2015 to 2019.\n\nAs PKD continues to inspire, Hyde hopes that the community of Fort Morgan will continue to grow its interest in PDK’s life and works. He also anticipates holding more Fort Morgan-based festivals in the future."
