Dick in Argentina 40 years after his supposed death Roni Bandini · Follow 2 min read · Nov 6, 2023 -- Listen Share\n\nThis is a true story.\n\nI was at a Fiverr party in Palermo, Buenos Aires on December 20, 2022 8.36pm, when I saw Philip K. Dick, the legendary sci-fi author died in 1982, wearing a Picasso t-shirt.\n\nPhilip K Dick in Argentina\n\nI snapped a photo, posted a lonely tweet and decided to approach. I apologized for interrupting and said:\n\n“You must hear this a lot, but you really look like…”\n\nHe cut me off and said:\n\n“I know. I get this all the time: Gustavo Cerati.”\n\nGustavo Cerati was a famous Argentine musician, who bore no resemblance to Philip K. Dick whatsoever.\n\nGustavo Cerati does not look like Phil K Dick\n\nSo at that point, it was clear that Philip K. Dick did not want to be bothered or his recovered robot in disguise as Picasso possesses an excellent sense of humor.\n\nAnyway, I walked out of the bar and this story slipped out of my mind until this very moment."
