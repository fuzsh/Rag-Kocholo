    "text": "The world of the work exudes a dystopian atmosphere at the end of the century In addition, beings such as corporations and nations also drive individuals into ruinous situations by operating on their own logic.Occasionally appearing aliens are portrayed as enemies of humans or opportunists who seek to profit from human misfortunes. Robots also appear frequently, mainly as hostile forces that hate humans, or escaped from being oppressed by humans and longing for revenge, or blind murder weapons. On the other hand, there are often robots who believe that they are human without knowing that they are robots.In addition to robots, there are many cars and home appliances with artificial intelligence . Representative examples are a private car that prevents the driver from driving, saying that he has been drinking, and a front door that does not let the owner in unless money is put in. Since the technical limitations of the time were reflected in the work, there are scenes that are embarrassing from a modern point of view, such as the artificial intelligence robot including cogs as key parts.Dick's favorite theme is the confusion of self-identity and memory. In almost all of his works, 'Who am I?' ' Is this real now? ' 'Am I right?' 'Are my memories real?' ask the same questions This is a great appeal to modern people who are becoming more and more individualized.Some people consider Dick to be the founder of cyberpunk . The general public does not consider Dick's work to be cyberpunk science fiction, but among mainstream cyberpunk writers, there are those who say, \"The biggest influence on my work/world view is Philip K. Dick.\" Representative examples include Bruce Sterling and William Gibson . Certainly, unlike Asimov and Clark, Dick's works are steeped in concern and distrust that “science and technology can dominate and destroy humans, rather than save them,” and this is in line with the core philosophy of cyberpunk literature, “science and technology can destroy humans.” It is consistent with “human alienation.” There is something in common with Kurt Vonnegut , but Dick is more pessimistic.However, Dick's writing skills themselves are not outstanding. [11] He did not receive a proper higher education because he was expelled from college after one year, he was a drug addict who suffered from mental illness, and he had to write prolifically to make a living without having time to properly polish his sentences.However, his works are also highly regarded as literary, and this is because most of Dick's works (especially full-length novels) ask philosophical questions about epistemology or existential questions based on assumptions, so it can be seen as a modification of pure literature internally. This is largely due to the fact that it contains a high level of subject matter awareness. In fact, writer Ursula Le Guin once said that her work was underrated, so if you go beyond the limitations of writing style, you can feel Philip K Dickman's philosophy and charm in his writing."
