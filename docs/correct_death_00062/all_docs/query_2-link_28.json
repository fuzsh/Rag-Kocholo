He was a highly influential, award-winning science fiction writer whose novels and stories have sold millions of copies and have been the source of a number of successful motion pictures. Born prematurely, he was one of a set of fraternal twins. The other, Jane, died when they were six weeks old, and the loss would shape his future work. After his parents' divorce, he went to Berkeley, California with his mother and would later attend the University of California. Eventually dropping out, he would later claim that he discovered science fiction at the age of twelve and knew that this was what he wanted to create. In order to make a living while trying to become a writer, he worked for businessman Herb Hollis, who would be come a father-figure and inspiration for him. He also met the science fiction editor Anthony Boucher, who mentored him and gave him a start in his chosen field. Philip K. Dick would author seminal works such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (which was the basis for the film \"Blade Runner\"), \"Total Recall,\" \"The Minority Report,\" \"Screamers,\" \"Imposter,\" \"Confessions of a Crap Artist,\" and \"Paycheck\", all of which were made into motion pictures. He received the Hugo Award, one of science fiction's highest honors, for his book alternate history work \"The Man in the High Castle\", a novel that explored a world where Nazi Germany won World War II. His works also garnered him two British Science Fictions Prizes and the 1974 dystopian future novel \"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said\" won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award. In the early 1970's, he claimed to have had a mystical vision that altered his philosophy of life and would impact his later work particularly the book \"Valis.\" Many of his critics claimed this vision was fueled by the mental illness that he was diagnosed with in his youth. He died as a result of a series of strokes and heart failure.\n\nAuthor.
