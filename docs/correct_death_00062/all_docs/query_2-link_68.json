Dick explored philosophical, sociological and political themes in novels with plots dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness. In his later works, Dick's thematic focus tended to reflect his personal interest in metaphysics and theology.\n\nQuotes [ edit ]\n\nIn one of the most brilliant papers in the English language Hume made it clear that what we speak of as \"causality\" is nothing more than the phenomenon of repetition.\n\nScience has given us more lives than it has taken; we must remember that.\n\nSpinoza saw... that if a falling stone could reason, it would think, \"I want to fall at the rate of thirty-two feet per second.\"\n\nMy major preoccupation is the question, \"What is reality?\"\n\nCan any of us fix anything? No. None of us can do that. We're specialized. Each one of us has his own line, his own work. I understand my work, you understand yours. The tendency in evolution is toward greater and greater specialization. Man's society is an ecology that forces adaptation to it. Continued complexity makes it impossible for us to know anything outside our own personal field — I can't follow the work of the man sitting at the next desk over from me. Too much knowledge has piled up in each field. And there are too many fields. \"The Variable Man\" (1952), The Collected Short Stories of Philip K.

He saw, I think, the same cracks forming that had sundered the ancient world, the world of Greece and Rome; and it was his conviction that presently our world, our society, would pass away as theirs did, and a period of darkness would follow. \"The Preserving Machine\" (1953), The Collected Short Stories of Philip K.

When we mix sulphur with saltpeter and charcoal we always get gunpowder. This is true of every event subsumed by a causal law — in other words, everything which can be called scientific knowledge. \"It is custom which rules,\" Hume said, and in that one sentence undermined both science and philosophy.

Dick (1995), ed. Lawrence Sutin\n\n\n\nThese creatures are among us, although morphologically they do not differ from us; we must not posit a difference of essence, but a difference of behavior. In my science fiction I write about about them constantly. Sometimes they themselves do not know they are androids. Like Rachel Rosen, they can be pretty but somehow lack something; or, like Pris in We Can Build You , they can be absolutely born of a human womb and even design androids — the Abraham Lincoln one in that book — and themselves be without warmth; they then fall within the clinical entity \"schizoid,\" which means lacking proper feeling. I am sure we mean the same thing here, with the emphasis on the word \"thing.\" A human being without the proper empathy or feeling is the same as an android built so as to lack it, either by design or mistake. We mean, basically, someone who does not care about the fate which his fellow living creatures fall victim to; he stands detached, a spectator, acting out by his indifference John Donne's theorem that \"No man is an island,\" but giving that theorem a twist: that which is a mental and a moral island is not a man . \"Man, Androids and Machine\" (1975), reprinted in Sutin, Lawrence, ed (1995).

Many of my stories and novels deal with psychotic states or drug-induced states by which I can present the concept of a multiverse rather than a universe. Music and sociology are themes in my novels, also radical political trends; in particular I've written about fascism and my fear of it.

I think the only thing that would really affect people would be the announcement that the world was going to be blown up by the hydrogen bomb. I think that would really affect people. I think they would react to that. But outside of that, I don't think they would react to anything. \"Peking has been wiped out by an earthquake, and the RTD — the bus strike is still on.\" And some guy says, \"Damnit!

Okay, so I should revise my standards, I'm out of step. I should yield to reality. I have never yielded to reality.

He never played. He was off in a world of his own, a world into which none of them could come. He never joined in anything, games or chores or family activities. He was by himself always. Remote, detached, aloof. Seeing past everyone and everything — that is, until all at once something clicked and he momentarily rephased, reentered their world briefly.\n\nCris didn't play fair. He had watched half an hour — then come out and thrown once. One perfect toss, one dead ringer.\n\n\"No communication.\" Baines was sweating. \"In eighteen years there hasn't been any semantic bridge between you? Does he have any contact? Signs? Codes?\"\n\n\"He — ignores us. He eats here, stays with us. Sometimes he plays when we play. Or sits with us. He's gone days on end. We've never been able to find out what he's doing — or where. He sleeps in the barn — by himself.\"\n\nFor a moment he studied the massive figure who stood calmly between the two Civil Policemen. Beside him, they seemed to have shrunk, become ungainly and repellent. Like dwarves... What had Jean said? A god come to earth. Baines broke angrily away. \"Come on,\" he muttered brusquely. \"This one may be tough; we've never run up against one like it before. We don't know what the hell it can do.\"\n\n\"His brain pattern has been fully scanned. But it takes time for them to plot it out. We're all running around like lunatics while he just sits there!\" Wisdom poked a stubby finger at the window. \"We caught him easily enough. He can't have much, can he? But I'd like to know what it is. Before we euth him.\"\n\n\"Maybe we should keep him alive until we know.\"\n\n\"Euth in forty-eight hours,\" Wisdom repeated stubbornly. \"Whether we know or not. I don't like him. He gives me the creeps.\"\n\nSomebody high up was toying with the idea of allowing them to breed. Some sort of industrial use. We withheld euth for years. But Cris Johnson stayed alive outside our control. Those things at Denver were under constant scrutiny.\n\nWe'll know homo superior when he comes — by definition. He'll be the one we won't be able to euth.\n\n\"The Neanderthal probably thought the Cro-Magnon man had merely an improved line. A little more advanced ability to conjure up symbols and shape flint. From your description, this thing is more radical than a mere improvement.\"\n\n\"This thing,\" Baines said slowly, \"has an ability to predict. So far, it's been able to stay alive. It's been able to cope with situations better than you or I could. How long do you think we'd stay alive in that chamber, with energy beams blazing down at us? In a sense it's got the ultimate survival ability. If it can always be accurate —\"\n\nThe chamber was an inferno of energy. The figure had completely disappeared. Wisdom waited a moment, then nodded to the technicians operating the cube. They touched guide buttons and the muzzles slowed and died. Some sank back into the cube. All became silent. The works of the cube ceased humming.\n\nCris Johnson was still alive. He emerged from the settling clouds of ash, blackened and singed. But unhurt. He had avoided each beam. He had weaved between them and among them as they came, a dancer leaping over glittering sword-points of pink fire. He had survived.\n\n\"He's too far ahead of us. We can't compete with him.\" Wisdom's eyes were bleak. \"We can only guess what's going to happen. He knows. For him, it's a sure thing. I don't think it'll help him at euth, though. The whole stage is flooded simultaneously. Instantaneous gas, released throughout.\" He signalled impatiently to the guards. \"Get going. Take him down right away. Don't waste any time.\"\n\n\"We were always afraid a mutant with superior intellectual powers would come along,\" Baines said reflectively. \"A deeve who would be to us what we are to the great apes. Something with a bulging cranium, telepathic ability, a perfect semantic system, ultimate powers of symbolization and calculation. A development along our own path. A better human being.\"\n\n\"He acts by reflex,\" Anita said wonderingly. She had the analysis and was sitting at one of the desks studying it intently. \"Reflex — like a lion. A golden lion.\" She pushed the tape aside, a strange expression on her face. \"The lion god.\"\n\n\"Beast,\" Wisdom corrected tartly. \"Blond beast, you mean.\"\n\n\"He runs fast,\" Baines said, \"and that's all. No tools. He doesn't build anything or utilize anything outside himself. He just stands and waits for the right opportunity and then he runs like hell.\"\n\n\"This is worse than anything we've anticipated,\" Wisdom said. His beefy face was lead-gray. He sagged like an old man, his blunt hands trembling and uncertain. \"To be replaced by an animal! Something that runs and hides. Something without a language!\" He spat savagely. \"That's why they weren't able to communicate with it. We wondered what kind of semantic system it had. It hasn't got any! No more ability to talk and think than a — dog.\"\n\n\"He can look ahead. See what's coming. He can — prethink. Let's call it that. He can see into the future. Probably he doesn't perceive it as the future.\"\n\n\"No,\" Anita said thoughtfully. \"It would seem like the present. He has a broader present. But his present lies ahead, not back. Our present is related to the past. Only the past is certain, to us. To him, the future is certain. And he probably doesn't remember the past, any more than any animal remembers what happened.\"\n\n\"As he develops,\" Baines said, \"as his race evolves, it'll probably expand its ability to prethink. Instead of ten minutes, thirty minutes. Then an hour. A day. A year. Eventually they'll be able to keep ahead a whole lifetime. Each one of them will live in a solid, unchanging world. There'll be no variables, no uncertainty. No motion! They won't have anything to fear. Their world will be perfectly static, a solid block of matter.\"\n\n\"And when death comes,\" Anita said, \"they'll accept it. There won't be any struggle; to them, it'll already have happened.\"\n\nHe was always moving, advancing into new regions he had never seen before. A constantly unfolding panorama of sights and scenes, frozen landscapes spread out ahead. All objects were fixed. Pieces on a vast chess board through which he moved, arms folded, face calm. A detached observer who saw objects that lay ahead of him as clearly as those under foot.\n\nRight now, as he crouched in the small supply closet, he saw an unusually varied multitude of scenes for the next half hour. Much lay ahead. The half hour was divided into an incredibly complex pattern of separate configurations. He had reached a critical region; he was about to move through worlds of intricate complexity.\n\nIn one dim scene he saw himself lying charred and dead; he had tried to run through the line, out the exit.\n\nBut that scene was vague. One wavering, indistinct still out of many. The inflexible path along which he moved would not deviate in that direction. It would not turn him that way. The golden figure in that scene, the miniature doll in that room, was only distantly related to him. It was himself, but a far-away self. A self he would never meet. He forgot it and went on to examine the other tableau.\n\nThe myriad of tableaux that surrounded him were an elaborate maze, a web which he now considered bit by bit. He was looking down into a doll's house of infinite rooms, rooms without number, each with its furniture, its dolls, all rigid and unmoving.\n\nShe could kill him easily. But the lash-tube wavered. Cris Johnson stood without fear; he wasn't at all afraid. Why not? Didn't he understand what it was? What the small metal tube could do to him?\n\n\"Of course,\" she said suddenly, in a choked whisper. \"You can see ahead. You know I'm not going to kill you. Or you wouldn't have come here.\"\n\n\"You don't go by odds. You know what's coming. You've seen the cards already.\" She studied his face intently. \"No, you can't be cold-decked. It wouldn't be possible.\"\n\n\"Maybe his characteristics are recessive. Maybe ours will cancel his out.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't lay any money on that,\" Baines said. \"I think I know already which of the two strains is going to turn up dominant.\" He grinned wryly. \"I mean, I'm making a good guess. It won't be us.\"\n\nAn error occurred. And now a serious problem exists. You have seen these things. You know a great deal.

In the 1950s and '60s, consumer commodities and farm products began to pile up in vast towering mountains all over the Western World. As much as possible was given away — but that threatened to subvert the open market.

You never know what’s going to happen—there’s no order, no logic.” It infuriated him that she did not object, that it seemed natural to her. “We’re helpless; we have to depend on whim.

Sighing, Hamilton almost wished there had been; the capricious personality element infuriated him. There was just too little relationship between deed and punishment; the lightning was probably cutting down some totally innocent Cheyennite, on the far side of town. Chapter 7 (p. 92)\n\n\n\nThe hymns were unfamiliar to him, but he quickly picked up the general beat. The hymns had a redundant simplicity; the same phrases and tones appeared and reappeared. The same monotonous ideas, repeated indefinitely. The appetite of (Tetragrammaton) was insatiable, he concluded. A childish, nebulous personality that required constant praise—and in the most obvious terms. Quick to anger, (Tetragrammaton) was equally quick to sink into euphoria, was eager and ready to lap up these blatant flatteries.\n\nA balance. A method of lulling the Deity.

And who am I? The wrong person; I can tell you that.\n\nWhat does it mean, insane? A legal definition. What do I mean? I feel it, see it, but what is it? It is something they do, something they are. It is their unconsciousness...Do they ignore parts of reality? Yes. But it is more. It is their plans...Their view; it is cosmic...They see through the here, the now, into the vast black deep beyond, the unchanging. And that is fatal to life. Because eventually there will be no life; there was once only the dust particles of space, the hot hydrogen gases, nothing more, and it will come again.\n\nWhen I was a child, I thought as a child. But now I have put away childish things. ...

Be small...and you will escape the jealousy of the great.\n\nIt's the fault of those physicists and that synchronicity theory, every particle being connected with every other; you can't fart without changing the balance in the universe.

Is that the paradox of our earthly situation?\n\nTo save one life, Mr. Tagomi had to take two. The logical, balanced mind cannot make sense of that. A kindly man like Mr. Tagomi could be driven insane by the implications of such reality.\n\nWe have entered a Moment when we are alone. We cannot get assistance, as before. Well, Mr. Tagomi thought, perhaps that too is good. Or can be made good. One must still try to find the Way.\n\nThat is the artist's job: take mineral rock from dark silent earth, transform it into shining light-reflecting form from sky.\n\nI feel the hot winds of karma driving me. Nevertheless I remain here. My training was correct: I must not shrink from the clear white light, for if I do, I will once more re-enter the cycle of birth and death, never knowing freedom, never obtaining release. The veil of maya will fall once more.\n\nThis hypnagogic condition. Attention-faculty diminished so that twilight state obtains; world seen merely in symbolic, archetypal aspect, totally confused with unconscious material.\n\nI will never fully understand; that is the nature of such creatures. Or is this Inner Truth now, this that is happening to me? I will wait. I will see. Which it is. Perhaps it is both.\n\nEven if all life on our planet is destroyed, there must be other life somewhere which we know nothing of. It is impossible that ours is the only world; there must be world after world unseen by us, in some region or dimension that we simply do not perceive. Even though I can't prove that, even though it isn't logical — I believe it.\n\nWe do not have an ideal world, such as we would like, where morality is easy because cognition is easy. Where one can do right with no effort because he can detect the obvious.\n\n(Hawthorne Abendsen) told us about our own world. This, what's around us now. He wants us to see it for what it is. And I do, and more so each moment.\n\nYou're killing yourself with cynicism.

A much simpler view can be entertained with more common sense, and as a CIA employee you must be aware that, like all intelligence agencies, it lacks the faculty of common sense.

You know what I’d say to him? “You stupid bastard, does what you’re fighting for look so real now? Skin pigment. What a laugh! Why not eye color? Too bad nobody ever thought of that. It cuts it a little finer, but basically it’s the same thing. Okay, Verne, you get out there and die over the issue of upholding one certain eye color. Lots of luck.” Chapter 13 (p. 174; in the book, Verne Engel heads up a racist organization)\n\n\n\nAnd anyhow, he realized, none of us wants to start slaughtering the Peking people. It would be too much like the old days, back among our cave-dwelling ancestors. Back to their level. We must have grown out of that by now, he said to himself.

But generally it was not, after all. Chapter 14 (p. 192)\n\n\n\nDid we get or learn anything from our unexpected confrontation with the Pekes? he wondered. It showed us, he decided, that the difference between say myself and the average Negro is so damn slight, by every truly meaningful criterion, that for all intents and purposes it doesn’t exist.

It flashed from the woodwork and the walls; it smote him with an awful, total power, as if generated by a vast mill. It rose from the floor, up out of the tattered gray wall-to-wall carpeting. It unleashed itself from the broken and semi-broken appliances in the kitchen, the dead machines which hadn’t worked in all the time Isidore had lived here. From the useless pole lamp in the living room it oozed out, meshing with the empty and wordless descent of itself from the fly-specked ceiling. It managed in fact to emerge from every object within his range of vision, as if it—the silence—meant to supplant all things tangible. Hence it assailed not only his ears but his eyes; as he stood by the inert TV set he experienced the silence as visible and, in its own way, alive. Alive! He had often felt its austere approach before; when it came it burst in without subtlety, evidently unable to wait. The silence of the world could not rein back its greed. Not any longer. Not when it had virtually won. Chapter 2 (p. 20)\n\n\n\n“Mercer,” Rick said.\n\n“I am your friend,” the old man said. “But you must go on as if I did not exist.

It did not seem possible that Wendy Wright had been born out of blood and internal organs like other people. In proximity to her he felt himself to be a squat, oily, sweating, uneducated nurt whose stomach rattled and whose breath wheezed. Near her he became aware of the physical mechanisms which kept him alive; within him machinery, pipes and valves and gas-compressors and fan belts had to chug away at a losing task, a labor ultimately doomed. Seeing her face, he discovered that his own consisted of a garish mask; noticing her body made him feel like a low-class windup toy. All her colors possessed a subtle quality, indirectly lit. Her eyes, those green and tumbled stones, looked impassively at everything; he had never seen fear in them, or aversion, or contempt. What she saw she accepted. Generally she seemed calm. But more than that she struck him as being durable, untroubled and cool, not subject to wear, or to fatigue, or to physical illness and decline. Probably she was twenty-five or -six, but he could not imagine her looking younger, and certainly she would never look older. She had too much control over herself and outside reality for that. Chapter 5 (pp. 58-59)\n\n\n\n“Is it my fault?” Joe said. “Did I make that quarter you gave me obsolete?” He felt anger.\n\n“In some weird way,” Al said, “yes, it is your fault. But I don’t know how.

His age had astounded him for years, and each time that he had sat so astounded, trying to figure out what had become of the young, slim man in his twenties, a whole additional year slipped by and had to be recorded, a continually growing sum which he could not reconcile with his self-image.

It seemed to him as if he sat behind the tiller of his custom-made unique quibble, facing a red light, green light, amber light all at once; no rational response was possible. Her irrationality made it so. The terrible power, he thought, of illogic. Of the archetypes.

Chapter 4 (p. 64)\n\n\n\nThat life had been one without excitement, with no adventure. It had been too safe. All the elements that made it up were right there before his eyes, and nothing new could ever be expected. It was like, he had once thought, a little plastic boat that would sail on forever, without incident, until it finally sank, which would be a secret relief to all. Chapter 4 (p. 64)\n\n\n\nIn this dark world where he now dwelt, ugly things and surprising things and once in a long while a tiny wondrous thing spilled out at him constantly; he could count on nothing. Chapter 4 (p. 64)\n\n\n\nOne of the most effective forms of industrial or military sabotage limits itself to damage that can never be thoroughly proven—or even proven at all—to be anything deliberate. It is like an invisible political movement; perhaps it isn't there at all. If a bomb is wired to a car's ignition, then obviously there is an enemy; if public building or a political headquarters is blown up, then there is a political enemy. But if an accident, or a series of accidents, occurs, if equipment merely fails to function, if it appears faulty, especially in a slow fashion, over a period of natural time, with numerous small failures and misfirings—then the victim, whether a person or a party or a country, can never marshal itself to defend itself.

In all the years of his life ahead, the long years without her, with never seeing her or hearing from her or knowing anything about her, if she was alive or happy or dead or what, that touch stayed locked within him, sealed in himself, and never went away. That one touch of her hand. Chapter 9 (p. 156)\n\n\n\nWhat does a scanner see? he asked himself. I mean, really see? Into the head? Down into the heart? Does a passive infrared scanner like they used to use or a cube-type holo-scanner like they use these days, the latest thing, see into me—into us—clearly or darkly? I hope it does, he thought, see clearly, because I can't any longer these days see into myself. I see only murk. Murk outside; murk inside. I hope, for everyone's sake, the scanners do better. Because, he thought, if the scanner sees only darkly, the way I myself do, then we are cursed, cursed again and like we have been continually, and we'll wind up dead this way, knowing very little and getting that little fragment wrong too. Chapter 11 (p. 185)\n\n\n\nAny given man sees only a tiny portion of the total truth, and very often, in fact almost … perpetually, he deliberately deceives himself about that precious little fragment as well. A portion of him turns against him and acts like another person, defeating him from inside. A man inside a man. Which is no man at all. Chapter 11 (pp. 185-186)\n\n\n\nIt's a downer to tell anything to a kid. I once had a kid ask me, “What was it like to see the first automobile?” Shit, man, I was born in 1962. Chapter 12 (p. 194)\n\n\n\nThe unconscious is selective, when it learns what to listen for. Chapter 12 (p. 200)\n\n\n\nA psychologist said, “They used to talk about seeing only ‘reflections’ of reality. Not reality itself. The main thing wrong with a reflection is not that it isn't real, but that it’s reversed.” Chapter 13 (p. 213)\n\n\n\n“Then shall it come to pass the saying that is written,” a voice said. “Death is swallowed up. In victory.” Perhaps only Fred heard it. “Because,” the voice said, “as soon as the writing appears backward, then you know which is illusion and which is not. The confusion ends, and death, the last enemy, Substance Death, is swallowed not into the body but up—in victory. Behold, I tell you the sacred secret now: we shall not all sleep in death.” Chapter 13 (p. 214)\n\n\n\nThe mystery, he thought, the explanation, he means. Of a secret. A sacred secret. We shall not die. The reflexions shall leave. And it will happen fast. We shall all be changed, and by that he means reversed back, suddenly. In the twinkling of an eye. Because we are fucking backward right now, I guess, every one of us, everyone and every damn thing, and distance, and even time. But how long, he thought, when a print is being made, a contact print, when the photographer discovers he's got the negative reversed, how long does it take to flip it? To reverse it again so it's like it's supposed to be? A fraction of a second. Chapter 12 (p. 222)\n\n\n\nActivity does not necessarily mean life. Quasars are active. And a monk meditating is not inanimate. Chapter 14 (p. 244)\n\n\n\nIt sounds like they're saying passive life is good, he thought. But there is no such thing as passive life. That's a contradiction.

But the dead—he glanced at Bruce, the empty shape beside him — should, if possible, serve the purposes of the living.\n\nThat, he reasoned, is the law of life.\n\nAnd the dead, if they could feel, might feel better doing so.\n\nThe dead, Mike thought, who can still see, even if they can't understand: they are our camera.

Author's Note (p. 276)\n\n\n\nDrug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to step out in front of a moving car. You would call that not a disease but an error in judgement. When a bunch of people begin to do it, it is a social error, a life-style. In this particular life-style the motto is “Be happy now because tomorrow you are dying,” but the dying begins almost at once, and the happiness is a memory.

Dick.\n\nA novelist carries with him constantly what most women carry in large purses: much that is useless, a few absolutely essential items, and then, for good measure, a great number of things that fall in between. But the novelist does not transport them physically because his trove of possessions is mental. Now and then he adds a new and entirely useless idea; now and then he reluctantly cleans out the trash -- the obviously worthless ideas -- and with a few sentimental tears sheds them. Once in a great while, however, he happens by chance onto a thoroughly stunning idea new to him that he hopes will turn out to be new to everyone else. It is this final category that dignifies his existence. But such truly priceless ideas... perhaps during his entire lifetime he may, at best, acquire only a meager few. But that is enough; he has, through them, justified his existence to himself and to his God.\n\n\"An Interview With America’s Most Brilliant Science-Fiction Writer (Philip K.

It just seems very feeble to me sometimes. It doesn't seem to have the substantiality that it's suppose to have.\n\nThe capacity for indignation is the most important thing for a creative person. Not the aesthetic capacity but the capacity for indignation. And especially indignation at the treatment afforded other people.\n\n\"How To Build A Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later\" (1978) [ edit ]\n\nReality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.\n\nA speech published in the collection I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon and The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick. Available online.\n\nBecause today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups...So I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo-realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it. And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.\n\nThe basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.\n\nScience Fiction writers, I am sorry to say, really do not know anything. We can't talk about science because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial, and usually our fiction is dreadful.\n\nThis, to me, is the ultimately heroic trait of ordinary people; they say no to the tyrant and they calmly take the consequences of this resistance.\n\nAn EEG of a person watching TV shows that after about half an hour the brain decides that nothing is happening, and it goes into a hypnoidal twilight state, emitting alpha waves. This is because there is such little eye motion.\n\nReality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.\n\nThis is why I love SF. I love to read it; I love to write it. The SF writer sees not just possibilities but wild possibilities. It's not just \"What if...\" It's \"My God; what if...\" In frenzy and hysteria.\n\nThat was my problem then and it's my problem now; I have a bad attitude. In a nutshell, I fear authority but at the same time I resent it — the authority and my own fear — so I rebel. And writing SF is a way to rebel. ... SF is a rebellious art form and it needs writers and readers and bad attitudes — an attitude of \"Why?\" or \"How come?\" or \"Who says?\"\n\nAnd of course, in my writing, there is the constant theme of music, love of, preoccupation with, music. Music is the single thread making my life into a coherency. ... It's my job and my vice mixed together. You can't hope for better than that: having your job and your sin commingled.\n\nPeople have told me that everything about me, every facet of my life, psyche, experiences, dreams, and fears, are laid out explicitly in my writing, that from the corpus of my work I can be absolutely and precisely inferred. This is true.\n\nWriting is a lonely way of life. You shut yourself up in your study and work and work.\n\nOne thing I've found that I can do that I really enjoy is rereading my own writing, earlier stories and novels especially. It induces mental time travel, the same way certain songs you hear on the radio do ... the whole thing returns, an eerie feeling that I'm sure you've experienced.\n\nSeveral years ago, when I was ill, Heinlein offered his help, anything he could do, and we had never met; he would phone me to cheer me up and see how I was doing. He wanted to buy me an electric typewriter, God bless him — one of the few true gentlemen in this world. I don't agree with any ideas he puts forth in his writing, but that is neither here nor there. One time when I owed the IRS a lot of money and couldn't raise it, Heinlein loaned the money to me. I think a great deal of him and his wife; I dedicated a book to them in appreciation. Robert Heinlein is a fine-looking man, very impressive and very military in stance; you can tell he has a military background, even to the haircut. He knows I'm a flipped-out freak and still he helped me and my wife when we were in trouble. That is the best in humanity, there; that is who and what I love.\n\nA novel featuring Dick himself. The title is an acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System, Dick's gnostic vision of God.\n\nWe hypostasize information into objects. Rearrangement of objects is change in the content of the information; the message has changed. This is a language which we have lost the ability to read. We ourselves are a part of this language; changes in us are changes in the content of the information. We ourselves are information-rich; information enters us, is processed and is then projected outwards once more, now in an altered form. We are not aware that we are doing this, that in fact this is all we are doing.\n\nFor each person there is a sentence — a series of words — which has the power to destroy him ... another sentence exists, another series of words, which will heal the person. If you're lucky you will get the second; but you can be certain of getting the first: that is the way it works. On their own, without training, individuals know how to deal out the lethal sentence, but training is required to deal out the second.\n\nIt is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.\n\nReality is that which when you stop believing in it, it doesn't go away.\n\nA lot can be said for the infinite mercies of God, but the smarts of a good pharmacist, when you get down to it, is worth more.\n\nTo fight the Empire is to be infected by its derangement ... Whoever defeats the Empire becomes the Empire; it proliferates like a virus ... thereby it becomes its enemies.\n\nThe Empire Never Ended\n\nMental illness is not funny.\n\nThe distinction between sanity and insanity is narrower than the razor's edge, sharper than a hound's tooth, more agile than a mule deer. It is more elusive than the merest phantom. Perhaps it does not even exist; perhaps it is a phantom.\n\nCrazy people do not apply the principle of scientific parsimony... they shoot for the baroque.\n\nHelping people was one of the two basic things Fat had been told to give up; helping people and taking dope. He had stopped taking dope, but all his energy and enthusiasm were now totally channelled into saving people. Better he had kept on with the dope.\n\nFish cannot carry guns.\n\nGod is either powerless, stupid or he doesn't give a shit.\n\nNo man is infinitely strong; for every creature that runs, flies, hops or crawls there is a terminal nemesis which he will not circumvent, which will finally do him in.\n\nIt is amazing that when someone else spouts the nonsense you yourself believe you can readily perceive it as nonsense.\n\nCertainly it constitutes bad news if the people who agree with you are buggier than batshit.\n\nMadness has its own dynamism. It just goes on.\n\n\"You of all people,\" the void communicated. \"Out of everyone, it is you I love the most.\"\n\n\"matter is plastic in the face of mind.\"\n\nIt was evident to Elias Tate that this was the government. First they shake hands with you, he thought, and then they murder you.\n\nThey think they are free because they have never been free, and do not know what it means.\n\nBarefoot conducts his seminars on his houseboat in Sausalito. It costs a hundred dollars to find out why we are on this Earth. You also get a sandwich, but I wasn't hungry that day. John Lennon had just been killed and I think I know why we are on this Earth; it's to find out that what you love the most will be taken away from you, probably due to an error in high places rather than by design.

The core of my writing is not art but truth. Thus what I tell is the truth, yet I can do nothing to alleviate it, either by deed or explanation. Yet this seems somehow to help a certain kind of sensitive troubled person, for whom I speak. I think I understand the common ingredient in those whom my writing helps: they cannot or will not blunt their own intimations about the irrational, mysterious nature of reality, and, for them, my corpus of writing is one long ratiocination regarding this inexplicable reality, an investigation and presentation, analysis and response and personal history. My audience will always be limited to those people.\n\nEach of us assumes everyone else knows what HE is doing. They all assume we know what WE are doing. We don't ...

Dick's world involves immense tracts of pure insanity. It's a world which is always in danger of falling to pieces. It is an accurate picture of what is going on in a lot of people's heads and how the world actually does affect us—this weird, disjointed, unexpected world we're living in now. Well now, Phil Dick reflects that by using a sane, matter-of-fact prose to describe the completely insane things that happen in his novels. It is a way of mirroring reality. Peyton Place is a fine trivial example of non-realism. What reality is that reflecting? Nothing. A literary pseudo-reality where everybody goes to bed all the time with each other. It doesn't exist, you know; it has no relevance. It is escapism. Whereas serious science fiction is a modern literary device for handling this insane world we live in. 1988 interview in Conversations with Ursula Le Guin\n\nis a fine trivial example of non-realism.

The American Dream may have succeeded as a means of survival in the wilderness of early America; it allowed us to subdue that wilderness and build our holy cities of materialism. But now, the images in Dick's fiction declare, we live in a new kind of wilderness, a wasteland wilderness, because those cities and the culture that built them are in decay. We need a new American dream to overcome this wasteland. Patricia S. Warrick, Mind in Motion: The Fiction of Philip K. Dick (1987)\n\n\n\nThe worlds through which Philip Dick's characters move are subject to cancellation or revision without notice. Reality is approximately as dependable as a politician's promise. Roger Zelazny in Philip Dick: Electric Shepherd (1975), Bruce Gillespie, ed.\n\n\n\nTo call Philip K. Dick ... a science-fiction writer is to underscore the inadequacy of the label. ... It would be more accurate to call him one of the most valiant psychological explorers of the 20th century. David Edelstein, \"Philip K. Dick's Mind-Bending, Film-Inspiring Journeys\". Arts (The New York Times). June 16, 2002 .\n\n\n\nIs it real? Does it matter? Robin Temple, on all of Philip K. Dick's books.\n\n"
