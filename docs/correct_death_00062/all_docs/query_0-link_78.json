Walchar, Sr., on the Koehn farm south of Weimar, at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 1st, after a brief illness of acute tuberculosis, coupled with pneumonia. Although physicians, trained nurse and family did everything in their power to save the life of this noble young man, it was otherwise decreed by an All-wise Providence. Mr. Walchar was a fine young man, bright, studious, upright and honorable, one who had chosen teaching as his life's profession, and he was making good in same, giving splendid satisfaction to his patrons and pupils. Tuberculosis in an acute form recently attached him, and this followed by an attack of pneumonia was more than his rather frail constitution could stand. He had lived in this section for may years, was well thought of by all, and hid death at such an early age, when life held out to him so many promises, is indeed to be deplored. The funeral will take place at the Masonic cemetery this (Thursday) afternoon at 2 o'clock.

Before leaving the house, however, he complained of pain in his chest, for which he drank some soda water, and then went off to work with his son, Virgil. In a short time he again complained of his chest hurting him and he and son returned to the house. He again drank some soda water, and, while sitting on the back steps of his residence, drank some hot coffee which Mrs. Wagley had brought him. Mrs. Wagley returned to the kitchen with the cup and saucer, and when she came back a little later he had fallen out in the yard. When Mrs. Wagley reached him he was already dead. Her startled cry brought Virgil to her side at once, when he found the mother frantically trying to raise Mr. Wagley in her arms and carry him into the house. Together they carried him in and laid him on the bed. Realizing that he was dead, or in a dying condition. Virgil hastily called some of the neighbors, over the telephone.

Willie was a bright little fellow about three months old, and gave promise of an useful future. None but parents who have lost loved ones can feel the true depth of early sorrow. Little Willie was consigned to the dust on Tuesday evening in the presence of many sorrowful relatives and friends of the family. [Interment in Odd Fellows Rest ]\n\n”Weep for the days that will come no more, For the sunbeam down from heart and door, For a missing step, for the nameless grace Of a tender voice and loving face.

F. of Texas from February, 1887, to February, 1888, and in 1889 a representative to the Sovereign Grand Lodge which assembled at Columbus, Ohio.

He was examined and admitted as an attorney at law by the District Court of Colorado county, September 21, 1885. When twelve years of age he was confirmed in the Lutheran church at New Braunfels, of which church he died a member. He was essentially a valuable and useful man to our city, working in many ways to its advantage, and taking great pride in all things conducing to the prosperity and advancement of Columbus; and no one of our citizens could be more sadly missed by this community. His funeral was one of the most largely attended of any we have ever witnessed in the place, many of his friends in different parts of the county being present to join in the sad rites. He was buried with the beautiful and impressive ceremonies of the Masonic fraternity, Rev. G. H. Collins assisting at the house and grave.

Lillian was a devout Catholic and the first child baptized in the new St. Michael’s Church and had been a member of the Legion of Mary since high school. As a young girl, she didn’t much like outside work on her parent’s farm and instead prepared meals for those in the field and became an excellent cook. Later in life, her neighbors in Dallas bought and marveled over her delicious breads. She learned to speak the German language from her parents and from teachers at St. Michael’s school. During several trips to Europe with her husband Lawrence, many Germans asked where she learned their language. They were genuinely flattered. She once even talked a German policeman out of a traffic citation there, no easy task. She and her family were and are appreciative of her Weimar heritage.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, John Banse and Annie Rainoshek, her brother Edgar J. Banse, her husband Lawrence F.

Her husband was the first sheriff of Uvalde County when the county was first organized. He was a Home Guard during the civil war and for many years captain of a Ranger company. Her husband died about twelve years ago. Mrs. Ware's people were among the first white people to settle in Uvalde County.

WARNER.\n\nJune 19.--This community was shocked to learn of the sudden death of Mrs. S. E. Warner, of Cheetham. She was known to be in bad health, she being afflicted with dropsy of the heart, but no one dreamed that the end was so near. She was up in the forenoon, and even cooked her own dinner, but at about seven p m. Saturday she was found dead in bed, the end coming, apparently without a struggle. She was a widow of the late Rev. J, T. Warner, and since his death has lived alone. She was of an accentric[sic] disposition and did not mingle much with the outside world, and always contended that by a decree of the district court several years ago, whereby the property of the late J. T. Warner was divided between his heirs, she was robbed out of half of her property. She has one brother some where in Georgia, who has been notified by wire. Justice H. S. Lundy held an inquest and rendered a verdict that deceased came by her death from heart failure. Her trunk was opened and the sum of $994.50 was found secreted therein.

[Interment in Weimar Odd Fellows Cemetery]\n\nColorado Citizen, February 17, 1887\n\nWarnken, William\n\nOld Time Settler Dies at Waco, Texas\n\nMr. Wm. Warnken, an old time settler of this section, died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. S. Rabel in Waco, Thursday night of last week, and the remains were brought here for interment in the Odd Fellows’ Cemetery Saturday afternoon, the funeral service being held from the Lutheran Church at 3 p.m., Rev. Paul Piepenbrok, local pastor, officiating.\n\nMr. Warnken had been a resident of this section for many many years. He farmed for a long time on his home place, a few miles southeast of Weimar. His health failing him a short time since, he went to the home of his daughter, Mrs. Rabel in Waco, and there lingered until Death came to his relief. His death, we are informed followed a severe attack of influenza.\n\nWm. Warnken was born in Fayette county, near the Bluff, Dec 1, 1853 and was 74 years, 4 months and 19 days of age at the time of his death. He was united in marriage to Miss Minetta Kahlden in 1872. To this union six children were born. Two died in infancy, while four survive. The surviving children are as follows: Mrs. J.H. Connor of Houston, Mrs. S. S. Rabel of Waco, Mr. Henry Warnken of Paducah, Texas, and Mr. Edmund Warnken of Temple. Also surviving him are fifteen grandchildren and fifteen great grandchildren.\n\nActive pall bearers were as follows: F. E. Leidolf, Emil F. gold, O. Hilden, Jno C. Hubbard, H. Birkmann and Ed Rabel. Honorary pall bearers named by the family were as follows: Henry Guenther, Chas.Fahrenthold, F. J. Nitschmann, Fritz Thumann, Henry Seifert and John H. Brooks.\n\nMr. Warnken, as stated above had lived in this section for many years. He was a man of engaging personality, a hustling, rustling, successful farmer and business man, and although well along in years, continued his activities in business up to within a few months of his demise.\n\nMany friends join us in extending sincere sympathy to his bereaved ones.\n\nWeimar Mercury, April 27, 1928\n\nWarren, Rose\n\nAged Colored Woman Dies Here Wednesday\n\nEarly Wednesday morning Death stepped in and claimed “Aunt Rose” Warren, one of Weimar’s oldest and most respected colored citizens. The funeral is held up pending arrival of several near relatives of deceased, but will likely take place tomorrow (Friday).\n\n“Aunt Rose: undoubtedly was the oldest person in this city or section.\n\nAccording to report, she was 8 years old “when the stars fell”. Figuring on this basis she must have been in the neighborhood of 112 years old at time of death. She was one of the old time slavery darkies and as such was connected with a number of old time Southern families of this section, notably the Hubbard family of this city. The devotion that existed between these Southern families and their colored servants was touching, and it is known that “Aunt Rose” during her long lifetime never wanted for anything that her good white friends could supply. And her devotion to “her white folks” was just as touching.\n\nBut few of these good old characters are still with us. Their number grows smaller each year, and soon they will be but a pleasant memory. “Aunt Rose” lived the life a good, christian woman,and as such met Death, strong in the faith! She will be missed by many of us! [Interment in Paradise Gardens]\n\nWeimar Mercury, November 13, 1931, page 1\n\nWarschak, Clarence H.\n\nWarschak\n\nClarence H.

Saturday, March 9, 1929, Eagle Lake, Texas\n\nSubmitted by David Hahn\n\nWatkins, Joe\n\nEAGLE LAKE ITEMS\n\nThis has been an eventful week with Eagle Lake. Last Wednesday night two negroes entered the house of Mrs. Schiller and blew out the light, which she had left burning. As soon as the light was extinguished Mrs. S. awoke, and, having matches by the bed, struck one as soon as possible, and by the light thus furnished plainly saw the negroes, both of whom left immediately. The next day two negroes were arrested on suspicion and taken to Mrs. S. for identification, neither of whom, however, were identified, and they were discharged the next night (Thursday.) One Warren Edwards was arrested, who also proved to be the wrong man. Later the same night a party of armed men went to the residence of Joe Watkins, a freedman living in town, and shot him four or five times, from the effects of which he died early the next morning. Watkins also shot four times the balls hitting the wall just above the door.
