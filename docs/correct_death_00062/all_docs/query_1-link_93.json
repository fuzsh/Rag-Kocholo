    "text": "The Minority Report Twenty Years On\n\n\n\nJohn Anderton is a police commissioner involved in a pioneering project called Precrime. Through information provided by suitably trained individuals called Precogs (short for Pre-Cognitives), the agency is able to identify crimes that are going to happen in the future and prevent them by arresting the perpetrator and placing him/her in a detention facility. The results of this experimental policy have been extraordinary. In the space of just a few years, violent crime has all but disappeared in New York. We enter the story when a new commissioner assistant, Ed Witwer, reports at Anderton's office, looking to be filled in on the project and not being exactly secretive about his long-term ambition to replace Anderton as commissioner one day. Needless to say, Anderton is not enamoured with his new assistant.\n\n\n\nShortly afterwards, Anderton receives a card from the precogs stating that he will be the perpetrator of a crime in just a few days’ time. The person he is going to kill, a Mr. Leopold Kaplan, is quite unknown to him. Anderton is aghast. Not only is his future on the line - having received notification by the precogs that a crime is going to happen the police have no option but detain him - but the reputation of the agency is also at stake. Anderton does not know Kaplan at all; why should he want to kill him? He suspects a conspiracy to get him out of the way as a police commissioner, possibly to make way for his shiny new assistant, Witwer. He tries to escape. But how to disappear in a city that is tightly controlled and all movements monitored?\n\n\n\nThough heavily tracked by police who have now turned against one of their own, Anderton is able to escape for now. At this point, he becomes aware of a peculiarity in the precog system, which is that quite often not all three precogs engaged by the agency give exactly the same information about the future. It sometimes happens that one of the precogs gives slightly different information from the other two, which leads to what is called a ‘minority report’. Usually, the minority report does not differ wildly from the other two, but it does open the possibility of a flaw in the system because if punishment is based on the evidence of the precogs, how can it be justified if that evidence is shaky? It could be that the system has been flawed all along, and what will happen to Precrime then?\n\n\n\nAnderton's main worry at this point is to find out what happened to his own minority report because first of all he needs to clear his name. He needs to go back to Precrime offices and try to discover whether perchance the prediction that he is going to kill Kaplan is a majority report, and if so, what happened to the minority report. Obviously, Anderton wants the minority report to say that he is innocent, but if that were to happen, Precrime, his life’s work, would prove itself to be unreliable. What to do?\n\n\n\nWithout going to go into any detail about what happens next (for the benefit of readers who have not read/watched this yet), I'm now going to explain what makes this a very special story for me.\n\n\n\nThis is familiar P.K. Dick territory: the story is quite cerebral with an emphasis on the logical paradoxes that emerge when we attempt to look into the future. There are some magnificent passages towards the beginning when Anderton explains to Witwer the way the system works.\n\n\n\n“You’ve probably already grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We’re taking in individuals who have broken no law.”\n\n“But surely, they will,” Witwer affirmed with conviction.\n\n“Happily, they don’t — because we get to them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We can claim they are culpable. They, on the other hand, can eternally claim they’re innocent. And, in a sense, they are innocent.”\n\n\n\nThere are many arresting ideas in this short passage. Without a doubt, the word ‘metaphysics’ will strike readers as quite central. What was originally meant by ‘metaphysics’ is that which is beyond physics, beyond the real world. For example, reference to suprasensible realities (Plato’s forms, for instance, or God) is metaphysical because these realities cannot be made available to the senses and are therefore spurious. Dick reverses the normal meaning of metaphysics; the crime no longer belongs to the realm of the sensible world. Instead what belongs to that world is the previsions that a certain crime will be committed.\n\n\n\nA consequence of this is that a culpable individual is not someone who has committed a crime. Technically, all those detained by Precrime are innocent. And yet, the system works. There is no crime in New York city. Note the play between the future tense that Witwer uses in the above passage (“But, surely, they will”) and the present tense that Anderton uses (“Happily, they don’t”). What Dick is suggesting here is that the reason why crimes are not committed any more is not because our look into the future is infallible but because people refrain from committing them in the knowledge that they will be caught. In other words, the consequences of an action are so immediate (arrest even before the act is committed) that nobody risks crime any more. In the film this is portrayed poignantly by having Tom Cruise’s character say that no premeditated crimes are committed any more, only crimes of passion because people commit these on the spur of the moment overwhelmed by their emotions.\n\n\n\nAnd then P.K. Dick brings in another big idea. No, not the idea of free will although that is undoubtedly there (especially in the film). Dick’s big idea is to make the future a plaything at the hands of the various state agencies that vie for power. In the book the Army wants to humiliate the police and especially Precrime because they see it as an impediment to their own dominance. So they set Anderton up: if Anderton kills Kaplan (which he may well want to do given that Kaplan is an enemy of Precrime), he confirms his enemies who are intent on proving that the Pre-cogs’ previsions are unreliable. But if he does not kill Kaplan, he also proves Kaplan right because it shows that majority reports are not to be trusted!\n\n\n\nAnd here is where the story’s cerebral character gives way to a more nuanced consideration of the stakes involved. The future is not predetermined, and Anderton, too, can play with the various options the future affords him even if the personal cost to prove Kaplan wrong is quite high. He does not hesitate. In a very suspenseful sequence of events, Anderton decides that it’s the bigger picture that matters. Like a true Dickian hero – flawed, unlikeable, battered by life’s whims – Anderton still manages to salvage the reputation of his life’s work for which he has worked so hard.\n\n\n\nThere are considerable differences between the film and Dick’s story even though the basic premise is the same and even some phrases from the book are used verbatim in the screenplay. Not being a huge fan of Tom Cruise I cannot say that I enjoyed the film as much as I enjoyed the story. I think that Cruise lacks the depth of a Harrison Ford (Blade Runner) just as Spielberg lacks the depth of a Ridley Scott. Overall, though, not a bad film with some memorable acting (e.g. by Samantha Morton as the Precog Agatha)."
