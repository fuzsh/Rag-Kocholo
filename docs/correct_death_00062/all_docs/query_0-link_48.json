        "text": "Carol Adams, the widow of the Rev. Eugene H. Adams died on Monday, December 4, 2017 in Damariscotta, Maine. She was 89 years old, having been born Martha Caroline Brown on January 8, 1928, in Lakewood, OH, to Edna (Toudy) and Clarence Brown.\n\nCarol graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1950 with a BA in philosophy. During college she studied abroad at the Folk School in Denmark, and later took time to hitchhike through Europe before returning home.\n\nWhile working as assistant to the Regional Director of the Foreign Policy Association in Cleveland, she met Rev. Eugene H. Adams. Gene shared her passion for social justice issues, and they wed in 1956. Over the years he served Unitarian Universalist congregations in Orange and Worcester, MA; Jamestown, NY; and finally Medford, MA. They raised two sons, Richard and John.\n\nEven in the role of housewife, mother, and minister’s wife, Carol held a deep commitment to social justice and activism. Throughout her life she openly tackled important issues of the day, including civil rights and race relations, opposition to the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, women’s rights, access to birth control, abortion rights, nuclear arms control, Native American affairs, workers’ rights, elder issues, LGBTQ rights, and marriage equality. To make her voice heard she participated in numerous demonstrations and marches, not only in her own town, but in Washington D.C., New York, and Seabrook, NH.\n\nIn mid-life she returned to the workforce, first as an administrative assistant at the Unitarian Universalist Association in Boston, and later for Tufts University’s Experimental College program.\n\nHer commitment to racial justice led her to become, at age 50, the first, full-time Affirmative Action Officer for the City of Medford, MA. For her work she was awarded the Martin Luther King citation by the Medford Branch of the NAACP, and received special commendation by Medford City Council. She then went on to become Affirmative Action Officer for the neighboring town of Arlington. Her affirmative action career continued at the State level, working for the Massachusetts Bureau of Public Information and Recruitment as an Employment Specialist responsible for minority employment, counseling, and training. She was promoted to Assistant Supervisor for the Massachusetts Office of Equal Employment Practices, supporting and increasing representation of women, minorities, and the disadvantaged in State employment.\n\nShe remained active following her retirement, working as secretary for the Community Church of Boston, tutoring adult ESL students, and volunteering as an “AIDS Buddy” for an AIDS service organization. In 1995 she was a fact-finding observer in Haiti, which remained a highlight for her.\n\nCarol loved music, art, nature, and social activism, and filled her free time with all of these. She attended operas and concerts, explored the Middlesex Fells Reservation, canoed the Concord River, swam in Wrights Pond and the Atlantic ocean, and puttered in her garden. She had a special interest in Native American affairs and culture, researching local Native American history and seeking out local and national organizations devoted to Native American issues. She remained active in many social justice organizations including the League of Women Voters, NAACP, and ACLU, Medford Council of Churches, Mystic Valley Eldercare, Association of Affirmative Action Professionals, Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.\n\nShortly before her husband’s death in 2004 Carol showed early signs of dementia. Under the care of her son John, she entered assisted living, eventually moving to Maine, first to The Highlands and finally to Chase Point in Damariscotta where she lived for the last 10 years.\n\nShe is survived by her son, John and his partner Thomas Fontaine, of Nobleboro, ME; son, Richard and wife Shari of Prince Frederick, MD; grandchildren, Brian and Robyn; nephews, David and wife Trish Fleming, and Ric Brown and wife Cristina; and nieces, Lucia Cooper and Kathy Browne.\n\nNo memorial service is planned. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in her name to the following: American Civil Liberties Union, 125 Broad Street, 18th Floor, New York, NY 10004; Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, 689 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139; or the Friends of Middlesex Fells Endowment Fund, 235 West Foster Street, Melrose, MA 02176.\n\nCondolences, and messages for her family, may be expressed by visiting: www.StrongHancock.com.\n\nThe Rev. Elinor Artman, parish minister, passionate advocate for gender equality, ardent reader, skilled pianist, cat lover, adept cruciverbalist, fearless world traveler, beloved religious leader, and “a minister’s minister,” died at age 87 on 16 March 2014 after brief illness and a stroke.\n\nElinor was ever in pursuit of knowledge, learning to read at age three and remaining a voracious reader her whole life. Her apartments always had countless bookshelves, and when they overflowed she parted with older books to make room for new ones. From early in her ministerial career, Elinor embodied honesty in sermons on controversial matters. One of her ministerial colleagues recalls hearing Elinor preach in 1982 on the still much-closeted topic of sexual abuse: “I was a very young adult, and her courage freed me from my own isolation and shame and gave me back my life. She took some grief for [that sermon] back then, but I’ve been grateful for many years that she took her stand and ministered to the rest of us.”\n\nAs a pianist Elinor loved playing duets. She was an inveterate knitter, touting her productivity as a good rationale for all of the television she watched. She had a cat, ravens were her spirit animal, and she read the New York Times daily—her hometown paper. Not caring much for cooking, if pressed she would bring deviled eggs to a potluck meal. In her last home, she kept a bowl filled with paper cranes on a table by the entry. She had been inspired by the story of the Japanese girl who made cranes, and it was her practice to send all her visitors home with at least one.\n\nElinor McHale was born on 30 January 1927, the only child of Walter and Hildegarde McHale. She grew up in White Plains, New York and earned the distinction of high school valedictorian. She was graduated summa cum laude from St. Lawrence University in 1948 with a B.S. in chemistry and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In the spirit of adventure, Elinor moved to Colorado for graduate study in chemistry, where she met and married fellow chemist Neil Artman, meanwhile learning to ski and to climb mountains. Neil’s work and PhD study took them to Delaware, then Texas, and finally to Ohio in 1955 for long-term employment with Proctor & Gamble. By 1961 the couple had five children and was living in the conservative Cincinnati suburbs.\n\nIn an atmosphere of heavy-handed corporate pressure to conform to patriarchal conventionality as “a P&G wife,” Elinor rebelled. She organized a group of wives who read Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. When her oldest child was asked by his public schoolteacher where his family worshipped on Sundays, her search for a very “un-P&G” religious alternative led her to the First Unitarian Church, where her children grew up in the church school and she became an increasingly active lay leader. When First Church seeded a new congregation in the Cincinnati suburbs, she helped launch the Northern Hills Fellowship.\n\nWith her mind continuing to stretch and yearn for knowledge, her UU activity led her toward deeper religious study. In the mid-1970s, with the death of her son Chris, a marriage strained to the point of divorce, and her youngest daughters still in high school, she began taking courses at United Theological Seminary in nearby Dayton. Though later denying to colleagues that she had ever experienced “a call,” Elinor eventually realized she was close to having enough credits for an M.Div. She lamented to her daughter Sarah that if she did that, she would be 52 when she finished. Sarah wisely said, “You’re going to be 52 anyway, so you might as well do it.” And so she did, earning her degree and in 1980 receiving ordination by her home church in Cincinnati.\n\nThe newly Rev. Ms. Artman first served as Extension Minister for the UUA’s Ohio Valley District from 1980 to 1983. She moved to parish ministry at the UU Fellowship of Kokomo, Indiana (1985-87) and then to her primary settlement at the Heritage Universalist Unitarian Church of Cincinnati (1989-2001), including a once-a month pulpit supply for the briefly existing UUs of Northern Kentucky (1994-95). The Heritage congregation named her Minister Emerita in 2001. She was known for her skills in conflict resolution and often facilitated groups in need of guidance. She became a certified instructor in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and often used this tool with church boards and congregations.\n\nElinor Artman lived out her professional commitment and service to the wider UU movement in manifold ways. She contributed importantly to the courses Cakes for the Queen of Heaven and Rise Up and Call Her Name, curricula for exploring feminist theology. She served twice as board member of the Unitarian Universalist Women’s Federation (1971-73 and 1991-93), facilitator of Unitarian Universalists for Right Relations (1991-93), member of the UUA Task Force on Congregational Responses to Clergy Misconduct (1992-94), member of the UUMA Executive Committee (1996-99), liaison to the UUMA’s CENTER Committee (1998), consultant to the Mountain Retreat and Learning Center Staff (2000-05), board member of the Women’s Heritage Society (2006-09), and chaplain of the Unitarian Universalist Musicians’ Network for eight years. In 2010, she was honored with membership in the Unitarian Universalist Women’s Federation Clara Barton Sisterhood, and in 2013 she received the Distinguished Service Award for the UUA’s Southeast District. In retirement she lived in Highlands and then in Asheville, North Carolina, a member of the UU church there.\n\nHer daughter, Martha, remembers how passionately Elinor “wanted to see women equally represented” and described her habit of scanning through magazines to count the relative numbers of female and male contributors. In her 80s, Ms. Artman began working on a book about women in Unitarian Universalism. In the introduction she wrote:\n\nIt has been a half century of great change. The Women and Religion Committee in the 70’s and 80’s was very active in helping us understand that women were not yet equal—both in the culture and UU circles. Decades of active consciousness-raising has helped remedy that. Women ministers were but a handful in 1975, but by 1999, over half of our ordained ministers were women.\n\nCompletion of the book by friends and co-workers is planned.\n\nElinor Artman is survived by her son, Linus Artman, daughters Martha Griffin, Sarah Artman, and Vanessa Fox, and three grandchildren.\n\nCelebration of life services were held on 6 April 2014 at the Heritage UU Church of Cincinnati and on 26 April 2014 at the UU Congregation of Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Asheville, 1 Edwin Place, Asheville, NC 28801, or to the Religious Institute, 21 Charles Street, Suite 140, Westport, Conn. 06880. In addition, her Heritage congregation has established the Elinor Artman Memorial Fund (c/o Heritage UU Church, 2710 Newtown Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244), to which contributions are welcomed.\n\nNotes of condolence may be sent in care of Sarah Artman, 1495 Teeway Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43220.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. John W. Baros-Johnson died on November 10, 2022, at the age of 74.\n\nJohn Wingood Johnson was born in Jasper AL on April 28, 1948. He grew up in and around Charlestown SC, until the age of 10, where his father was a printer. After his father died, John moved to Jasper AL and lived with his grandparents while his mother attended college to become a music director at the Methodist church and at Walker County High School. He did well in school, wrote poems, joined the library club, and acted in plays.\n\nWhile working, a librarian said he sounded like a Unitarian. Thereafter, he took the Greyhound Bus to Birmingham for Sunday services. At least once, the door was locked because of a KKK bomb threat in the integration era. In 1972, he received his Bachelor of Arts in Religion Studies from the University of Alabama. During the Vietnam era, he served in the U.S. Navy for ten months, so when John attended Woodstock, he had a buzz haircut. At Woodstock, John talked people down from bad LSD trips.\n\nAfter being taught by Murray Bookchin in New York City, he attended Drew Theological School in Madison NJ. He took courses in theology and philosophy and participated in student governance. After serving as youth adviser to the Liberal Religious Youth group at Morristown NJ Unitarian Fellowship, he married Irene Patricia Baros and moved to Syracuse NY. For the next ten years, he worked as Office Manager of the Syracuse Interreligious Council, as the intern minister/custodian of the local May Memorial Unitarian Society, as a psychiatric counselor, and as a computer consultant.\n\nThroughout these years, he met frequently with area Unitarian ministers. In 1987, he went to Meadville Lombard Theological School in Chicago. He completed the requirements for a Master of Divinity degree in 1990 and earned his D.Min. in 1991. His dissertation is titled: “Faith’s Body: A Hermeneutic Examination of Recent UU Theology.” Later he wrote a “Philosophical Autobiography.” The poetic “Faith is a Thinking” was revised and became “Meditations II: Liturgical Elements for a Thoughtful Faith (1997).”\n\nRev. Dr. Baros-Johnson was ordained by the May Memorial Unitarian Society of Syracuse NY on September 16, 1990. As intern minister in Portland OR he traveled to Atlanta GA to deliver the eulogy for his brother Richard Stoneyton-Reed Johnson who died in a motorcycle accident. Richard was press adviser to Coretta Scott King and the eulogy was delivered at the Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1992, he served as a part-time minister to the UU Fellowship of Fredericksburg VA, and the Jenkins UU Fellowship, VA. For the Fredericksburg congregation, he conducted Sunday worship services, organized adult education groups on UU History, initiated Long Range Planning Committee, and conducted the congregational goal-setting workshop. He led a workshop on “Raising UU Children” and supported and encouraged a new choir. At the Jenkins Fellowship, he worked to explore improvements in race relations.\n\nRev. Dr. Baros-Johnson was an interim minister for the UU Church of Augusta GA for two years (1992–1994). During his tenure, he worked to strengthen Adult Education programs on World Religion, Christian Scriptures, Ethics, and Comparative Religion. He produced the “Unitarian Universalist Radio Hour” for local broadcast, encouraged a Long Range Planning Committee, initiated the Children’s Choir, worked with the pledge campaign, performed at pledge campaign dinners, and supported LGBTQ+ organizations. He met with Baptist ministers, encouraging interracial discussions.\n\nDuring interim ministry in Yakima WA (1996–1997), he reoriented the Worship committee to try out alternative services and encouraged innovation and experimentation in other church committees. He also revitalized adult education and youth programs. With his encouragement for the expansion of lay leadership and alternative styles of lay leadership, the church showed very healthy dynamics and a good balance of listening and doing.\n\nIn 1997, he accepted a call from the UU Church of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where he would serve until 2006. His tenure included introducing the annual Thanksgiving meal, topical programs, and helping start the Afterchoir band, which plays at some church services and memorials.\n\nRev. Dr. Baros-Johnson encouraged the spiritual growth and sensitivity of each of the members of the congregation that he served. He strongly supported denominational activities both through personal participation and by encouraging church members to attend. He served on the Meadville Lombard Philosofest Committee (1990–1991) and was a member of the St. Lawrence District UUMA and the UU Ministers of Canada. John delivered the 2003 Confluence Lecture at the Canadian Unitarian Council’s Annual Meeting in Winnipeg Manitoba, titled “A Thoughtful Faith; Understanding UUism as a Faith Tradition.”\n\nIn community, John served as Chairman of the Parents’ Advisory Committee of Bright Horizons Learning, Center, Williamsburg VA (1991–1992); as an associate chaplain at the Eastern State Hospital, VA (1991); and as a board member and secretary of the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Society of Augusta GA (1993–1994). As a Fellow of the Medical College of Georgia, he was one of the authors of a medical ethics book. In Halifax, he was a member of the South End Clergy and gained respect as Coordinator of the Interfaith Council.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoyed chess, Go, table tennis, pool, guitar, electric bass, drumming, and computers. He retired because of early onset dementia.\n\nJohn is survived by his wife Irene and son Nicholas. A memorial service was held on Saturday, December 10, 2022, at the UU Church of Halifax NS, Canada.\n\nDonations in John’s memory can be sent to the endowment fund of the UU Church of Halifax, 5500 Inglis Street, Halifax NS, Canada, B3H 1J8, or sent by e-transfer to treasurer@uuch.ca. Notes of condolence can be sent to Irene Baros-Johnson, 985-2313 Gottingen Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, B3K 3B8.\n\nThe Rev. Suzanne Black, parish minister, educator of the disadvantaged, lifelong musician, and devoted dog lover, died on 10 February 2014 at the age of 71 after a brief illness.\n\nSuzanne is remembered as one who “helped the underdog,” and even prior to ministry, she was steadily engaged in education and pastoral care, first teaching high school French in Chicago and then moving to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, to become the head houseparent at a home for emotionally disturbed teenagers.\n\nAs a college student, she was bedfast for many months due to a serious spinal injury suffered during a rock-climbing outing. Despite several surgeries and physical therapy, she was dependent on leg braces and crutches for most of her working life. Nevertheless, Suzanne spent several summers traveling across Europe, “not letting this impairment of function interfere with living life fully,” recalls her sister, Judy. A seminary colleague remembers walking up “Holy Hill” with her: “I never quite made it up the hill without stopping. But . . . even on crutches and in her Birkenstocks [Suzanne] could beat me. She was still an athlete at the age of 45.” In retirement, knee surgeries failed to improve her mobility, and she became more dependent on what she called, with characteristic optimism and determination, her “power chair,” and repeatedly insisted that it was not an “electric chair!”\n\nSuzanne had a lifelong love of music, beginning with piano lessons in her childhood, continuing with high-school choir and musical theater, then guitar and folk singing in her “hippie” period, and ending with karaoke in her retirement. She always had several dogs as pets, and considered the dogs to be family. At her wedding to Gary Murphy on 12 August 2000, Suzanne’s two dogs were “attendants,” coming down the aisle wearing bows in procession with their human companions.\n\nSusan (Susie, Suzanne, Suze) Trappe Black was born 28 August 1942 in Alexandria, West Virginia, to Winston Edward Black and Virginia Trappe (Price) Black and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. She attended Mt. Holyoke College from 1960 to 1963 before transferring to the University of Illinois, where she earned a B.A. in 1965 and a M.A. in 1967. Around 1975, after several years of conventional life and work in the familiarity of the Midwest, Suzanne headed out to the open skies of Montana in a purple van with a companion, Sam Farmer, to live communally with another couple and their children. She earned a bit of income there sewing and embroidering peasant blouses and other clothing. With the ending of that communal life, she soon returned to the helping professions, working as a special education teacher and education department supervisor at the Boulder River School and Hospital in Boulder, Montana, where she met and married co-worker, Dean Dougherty. Suzanne became active in nearby Helena’s Big Sky UU Fellowship, and eventually went off to Starr King School for the Ministry, earning her M.Div. there in 1990. Her marriage to Dean ended in divorce.\n\nReturning to Montana, Ms. Black was ordained to Unitarian Universalist ministry on 24 May 1992 by joint action of the UU congregations of Helena, Billings, Bozeman, Idaho Falls, and Missoula in the tiny and evocatively-named town of Pray, Montana. She served interim ministries at the UU Congregation of York, Penn (1992-93) and the UU Fellowship of Fayetteville, Ark (1993-94), and an extension ministry at the UU Congregation of Las Vegas, Nevada (1994-97). In 1997 she was called as parish minister to the UU Church of South County (now “Tapestry”) in Mission Viejo, Calif, serving there until 2000, when she moved to a final interim ministry at St. Paul’s Universalist Church of Little Falls, NY (2000-01). In retirement, she and her new husband Gary returned to the desert they loved in southwest Arizona. They called themselves “snowbirds” and enjoyed traveling.\n\nCommitted strongly to the Unitarian Universalist Association’s work in anti-racism, the Rev. Ms. Black served as co-leader of the UUA’s Beyond Categorical Thinking Workshop in 1993 and as co-organizer of the UUA’s Building a Jubilee World Workshop in 1996. In the Pacific Southwest District chapter of the UUMA, she was a co-planner of three collegial retreats (1997-2000) and served as the chapter’s vice president (1999-2000).\n\nFamily and friends gathered for a meal of remembrance on 22 February 2014 in Bloomington, Illinois — the area of Suzanne’s childhood. Another informal memorial gathering was held in the Tyson RV Park clubhouse of her Quarzite, Arizona, housing community on February 28. Her sister recalled Suzanne as “passionate about people, her connections with people, and maintaining those connections.” She “knew how to put a good spin on things and look at [life] in a positive way.”\n\nSuzanne’s second husband Gary died in 2010. She is survived by her sister, Judith May; brother, Theodore Black; nephews, Andrew May and Brian May; and niece, Ginny Black.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to Starr King School for the Ministry, 2441 Le Conte Ave, Berkeley, Calif. 94709, to your area companion pet rescue shelter, or to a charity of your choice.\n\nNotes of condolences may be sent to Judy May, Box 2100 RR 1, Corner Brook, Newfoundland, A2H 2N2 Canada.\n\nThe Rev. Dorothy S. Boroush, parish minister and passionate activist for women’s rights, died on June 14, 2014 at the age of 88 in Englewood, Colorado, at the home of her daughter Gretchen, surrounded by flowers, family, and friends.\n\nDorothy was born on October 3, 1925, in Tiffin, Ohio, to George Alfred Stinchcomb and Ruth Elise Brand Stinchcomb. She was graduated with a B.A. in Theater from the State University of Ohio in 1977 and went on to attain an M. Div. from Chicago Theological Seminary in 1980.\n\nAfter graduation, Dorothy was ordained to the Unitarian Universalist Ministry by the First Unitarian Church of Shaker Heights, Ohio, in 1980. Shortly thereafter, she was called to serve as minister to the Emerson Unitarian Universalist Fellowship (now Emerson Church Unitarian Universalist) of Troy, Michigan, from 1980 to 1984. She then served as interim minister to the First Parish Church of Groton, Mass, from 1984 to 1985; the Unitarian Church of Marlborough and Hudson, of Hudson, Mass, from 1985 to 1986; and the Unitarian Society of New Haven, CT, from 1986 to 1987. In 1987, she accepted the position of District Executive to the Ballou Channing District, serving 49 parishes in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island until 1994.\n\nShe formally retired from ministry in 1995, but eventually regretted the “premature decision” and went on to serve as interim minister of the Foxborough Universalist Church in 1999. Dorothy also served as “minister-on-call” for a number of New England congregations, stepping in for other ministers who were ill or called away. She loved preaching at the Unitarian Universalist Meeting House of Provincetown, MA, the Unitarian Universalist Society of Martha’s Vineyard, the Bell Street Chapel in Providence, RI and many others. She led Sunday worship services at the First Parish Church of Taunton, MA, from July 2009 to April 2012, while the congregation was without a settled minister.\n\nThroughout her ministry, The Rev. Ms. Boroush dedicated time and service to numerous denominational organizations. She served on the Ohio-Meadville District’s Commissioned Lay Leaders Committee and the Holmes-Weatherly Award Panel. She served as Chair of the Michigan Extension Committee for two years, President of the Unitarian Universalist Ministers Association’s Michigan Chapter for two years, and Co-Chair of the Central Massachusetts’ Youth Adult Committee (YAC) for one year. She volunteered at the Doolittle Home of Foxboro, MA, and served on its board for a number of years.\n\nDorothy was a resolute advocate for women’s rights. Prior to entering the ministry, she worked as Director of Education and Public Relations for Pre-Term, a women’s health clinic in Cleveland, OH. She was a charter member of the National Organization for Women’s Cleveland Chapter, and served on the organization’s board and public relations committee. She served as member of the Cleveland Abortion Rights Action League; and member of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights (now the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice).\n\nDorothy was very involved with the Unitarian Universalist Women’s Heritage Society (UUWHS). She served on the Society’s Board of Directors from June 1995 to June 2001. She was a contributor and editor to a series of short biographic descriptions of UU women, titled “Notable Universalist and Unitarian Women,” and was the editor of the last edition in 2000. She was actively involved with programs put on by the UUWHS and was involved with the development of UUWHS calendars. She sponsored, wrote, and edited the 2002 edition of this calendar that included Antoinette Brown Blackwell, the first woman to be ordained in our liberal religious tradition.\n\nThe arts and creativity were powerful forces in Dorothy’s life. More than 15 years of her youth were dedicated to the formal study of piano and acting. She was a well-known actor and director in community theater throughout her life, much of it to critical acclaim. Her classical piano training was sufficient to consider a professional position per her instructors. She wrote poetry and in the 1970/80’s served as artistic director for the published poetry performance troupe, “Big Mama”. She also wrote, directed, and performed a one-act play about the life of the Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, which was staged in a number of Unitarian Universalist churches, also to great acclaim for its historic educational and creative aspects pertinent to the UU tradition.\n\nUntil nearly the end of her life, at age 86, Dorothy was still acting minister at First Parish Church in Taunton, Mass., where congregants there remember her as “a woman of deep faith,” “dedicated,” “generous,” and “committed to the long-term health of the congregation.”\n\nDorothy’s family remembers her as a gardener, a collector of ‘spiritual rocks’, a lover of the color purple, a feminist, poetess, political activist, a bird and tomato lover. She was a singer of silly songs and crocheted works of art during meetings. Her mission was to leave this world in a better place.\n\nDorothy is survived by her daughter, Gretchen E. Boroush; her sons, Eric D. Boroush and Kurt A. Boroush; and granddaughter Janice E. Boroush as well as her brother Dr. Thomas G. Stinchcomb, and nephews James, William, David, and Dan Stinchcomb and their wonderful families.\n\nA memorial service was held on September 13, 2014, at First Parish Bridgewater Unitarian Universalist Church.\n\nMemorial donations are encouraged to the Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society, 27 Grove St., Scituate MA 02066.\n\nCondolences may be sent to the family via Eric Boroush, #2 Gore St., Boston, MA 02120.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Janet “Jan” Bowering, parish minister, religious educator, UU historian, peace and justice activist, devoted minister’s wife, loving mother and grandmother, doll collector, and world traveler, died peacefully on July 17, 2014, surrounded by her family, at the Merrimack Valley Hospice House, in Haverhill, MA; she was 83 years old.\n\nThe Rev. Ms. Bowering served congregations in the roles of part-time and full-time minister, and religious education director. For more than a decade, she set aside her own calling and offered her professional skills as a volunteer in her husband’s congregations and within groups serving the larger UU movement. She was passionate about religious education and actively ministered to young people in her own congregations and in the larger UU movement. With her husband and children, she spent many summers at UU camps and institutes, directing work projects and leading youth programs. Equally committed to her community, she worked to establish both a temporary shelter for the homeless and a program to provide a food kitchen for the hungry. Another of her passions was to see new places, and she made use of her vacation and sabbatical time to travel the world.\n\nJanet found particular inspiration in the life and pioneering work of the Rev. Olympia Brown. She was known far and wide for her dramatic portrayal of Olympia Brown’s life and ideas, a presentation that she offered more than forty times. (At the time of this writing, a video record of one such performance was available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1guc91OFx8w).\n\nMs. Bowering was also a mentor to seminarians. The Rev. Holly Baylies, who served an internship at the Haverhill UU Church in 1990, recalls that Jan “taught me the truth about ministry, which was not to be found in the books I had read or the courses taken, but within the mere joy and optimism she expressed in the living of her life, in her service to others. No matter whom she encountered and how grumpy, annoying or difficult the person or circumstance may have been, she always found the right words and somehow, the beauty inherent in each and every individual she encountered. Her sense of the worth and dignity of every person was at the core of her teachings and her living.” Janet summarized this attitude in her conviction that “The church is people. It is not a body of belief, a set of principles, or an impressive structure of stone, wood, and glass.”\n\nJanet Hartzell was born on December 7, 1930, the only child of Allen Reiff Hartzell and Catharine May Weiser. She was a shy, artistic youngster who loved pets and other animals. With her father, she enjoyed gardening, growing food for the family, and composting. Influenced perhaps by her father, a chemistry professor at St. Lawrence University, Janet developed an interest in science. She created her own experiments, including one which nearly led to the accidental burning of her house. In her late teen years, she came under the mentoring influence of the Rev. Edna Bruner, who served the First Universalist Church, Canton, NY, from 1945 to 1950.\n\nThe summer after her high school graduation, Janet’s mother died suddenly; her father died nine months later.\n\nWhile attending college, Janet felt a call to ministry. She earned a B.A. from St. Lawrence University in 1952 and continued on to seminary, where her future husband, Vinton Bowering, was a year ahead of her. Another classmate, David Pohl, recalls, “While the University had about 1,800 students, the theological school was a small community of about forty. It was inevitable then that Vin and Janet would meet there, [forming a relationship] that [eventually] became a marriage.” In 1953 Vinton completed his B.D from St. Lawrence Theological School and Janet, having studied with Angus MacLean, received the School’s certification as a religious educator. Jan and Vin were married at the First Universalist Church, Canton, New York, on September 5, 1953. After a short honeymoon, they moved to Abington, Mass, where Vinton had been called to the local Universalist congregation (now defunct). Janet continued her studies at Boston University, because, in her words, “Harvard Divinity School had not yet grasped the idea of educating women for the ministry!” The next year Vinton was called to the Outlaw’s Bridge Universalist Church, Seven Springs, North Carolina, where he and Janet were both ordained to the Universalist ministry on January 30, 1955, by the North Carolina Universalist Convention. Shortly thereafter, Janet began serving as part-time minister of the smaller, nearby Universalist Church of Kinston, NC.\n\nThe Bowerings’ time in the South, during some of the first steps toward racial desegregation, presented challenges that they readily accepted. In her ministerial odyssey, recalled:\n\n“. . . one time we [Janet and Vinton] took the Seven Springs LRY group [Liberal Religious Youth] to hear [journalist and integration activist] Harry Golden speak in Kinston. We didn’t know, or we would have prepared the kids for non-segregated seating. Fortunately we arrived late, were ushered in to a lecture in progress and sat hastily wherever we could. Afterward we stopped for ice cream, two cars full of young people, and tried to sort out feelings. It was interesting that they mainly didn’t want their parents to know what happened lest they jeopardize their chances to “go places and do things with Mr. and Mrs. Bowrin’.”\n\nThe Rev. Ms. Bowering left the Kinston church in 1959, when Vinton was called to First Parish in Milford, Massachusetts. During this ministry and Vinton’s subsequent call to the First UU Society of Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1967, Janet turned her attention to an active, though unpaid, role assisting her husband in church growth, working in the church school, and preaching when Vinton was away. In this “sabbatical” from her own career, she and Vinton began raising their own children, and Janet worked as a substitute teacher in area schools. Shortly after her husband’s call to the Universalist Unitarian Church of Haverhill, Mass, in 1974, Janet was hired to serve alongside him as the Director of Religious Education; she continued in that position, while also serving as part-time minister at First Parish of Tyngsborough, Mass (1977-79).\n\nIn 1979, when the Rev. Vinton Bowering suffered a fatal heart attack, the Haverhill congregation received special permission to bypass a search process and call Janet as their minister. She entered upon that role while caring for her three children as a single parent, serving for seventeen years until her retirement in 1996, when she was named Minister Emerita. In 1997, the Rev. Ms. Bowering served briefly as a visiting minister at Adelaide’s Unitarian Church of South Australia. Her lifelong commitments to the UU movement were honored by Meadville Lombard Theological School with a D.D. in 1998.\n\nJanet Bowering’s ministering reached far beyond the congregations she served, both locally and globally. In 1977 she offered use of the church to the Calvary Baptist Church of Haverhill, MA, after that church had suffered a devastating fire. She later offered her church basement as a shelter for the homeless, a service remaining in place for three years. One Christmas Eve, Janet hand made the candles for the service from wax she had scraped off the pavement during a trip to Warsaw during the Polish uprisings, at great risk to her own safety. In the year following her retirement, she joined a Justice Works team helping to rebuild burned out churches in the southern United States and was credited with single-handedly digging a sewer line for a project in Summerton, South Carolina.\n\nThe Rev. Holly Baylies recalls that Jan’s “sense of social justice was strong, unflappable, and at times even comical, as this diminutive, white haired, little old lady, once packed a suitcase full of condoms to take to Romania to protest the lack of birth control practices. Detained by Romanian customs, she somehow managed to keep out of jail by convincing the authorities that she was a harmless minister, and was just following her conscience. Surprisingly, they let her go, condoms and all.”\n\nMs. Bowering was active in many UU organizations and activities. Prior to Unitarian and Universalist consolidation, she chaired the Camps Study and Evaluation Committee, a joint effort of Universalist and Unitarian women’s groups. She served the Mass Bay Chapter of the UUMA as senior Good Offices team member, Nominating Committee member, and Fall Conference planning committee member; the UU Historical Society as board member and president; the UU Society for Ministerial Relief as First Vice President; the Church of the Larger Fellowship as board member and executive committee member; the UU Women’s Heritage Society as President; and the Continental Board of the UU Women’s Federation. She was the first female member of the ministerial study group, The Fraters of the Wayside Inn, and also held membership with the Cedar Hill Study Group, the Unitarian Universalist Retired Ministers and Partners Association, and the UUA Professional Support Services Committee. She enthusiastically supported and promoted the Clara Barton Camp for over fifty years and served as chair of the Clara Barton Birthplace Committee.\n\nJanet valued her Universalist roots, and found it important to preserve the Universalist legacy. She served the Board of the Universalist Heritage Foundation, the Massachusetts Association of Universalist Women, and the Massachusetts Universalist Convention.\n\nAn avid traveler, Janet loved to explore new places and meet new people. She collected foreign dolls, purchased during her travels and given to her by friends and family; Jan could tell the story of each of the more than 100 dolls in the collection, explaining the doll’s origin, its unique meaning, and the reason it had been selected. Jan was also an amateur potter, painter, and naturalist; and she relished time spent with her family at their summer house in rural Maine.\n\nJan’s family remembers her as “extremely inquisitive,” and “very practical.” One of her daughters, Diana Bowering, describes how her mother was quick to take action upon hearing of a problem, and lived with a mentality of “let’s not talk about it, let’s get down there and do something about it.” Jan was known as extremely hard working and “wasn’t one to sit around.” Diana reports that even after her mother had been hospitalized and was suffering from a wandering mind, Jan said of the hospital stay, “In theory, I don’t think this is the best use of my time.”\n\nHolly Baylies offered these words at Janet’s memorial service: “I could never get over Jan’s bubbly and joyful outlook as she faced each new day, with that indomitable smile that never faded, looking for the good to be found, no matter what she might be facing. I was always in awe of her ability to rush into each day as if was a treat to be alive, and her ability to hold onto all that was good, always truly seeking out the best in people.”\n\nJan’s surviving family members include children, Dawn Jordan, Diana Bowering, and Alan Bowering, granddaughter, Laura Morley, and great-grandson, William Morley.\n\nA memorial gathering was held on 26 July 2014 in Haverhill. A Celebration of Life took place on 20 September 2014 at the UU Church of Haverhill. A marvelous collection of photos of Janet may be seen at http://driscollfuneralhome.tributes.com/obituary/photos/Rev.-Janet-H.-Bowering-101528418.\n\nMemorial donations are encouraged to The Clara Barton Camp, P.O.

Dr. Dwight Brown, 84, died on October 14, 2012. Rev. Brown was born in Zanesville, OH on November 4, 1927 to Mae and the Rev. O. Dwight Brown. He attained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College in 1950. In 1958, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Divinity from Starr King School for the Ministry. He received an honorary Doctor of Sacred Theology from Starr King School for the Ministry in 1971.\n\nRev. Brown was called to the First Unitarian Church of Trenton, NJ in 1948 (where he was also ordained on October 5, 1958) and served as the minister there until 1961. He was then called to the Unitarian Church of Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1961-1964. Switching gears, he then became the District Executive of the UUA New York Metropolitan District from 1964-1968. He returned to parish ministry with a long run as minister of the First Unitarian Church in Dallas, TX from 1968-1976. He found himself back in the UUA world with the position of Director of the UUA Office of Ministerial Finances (which is now the UUA Office of Church Staff Finances) from 1976-1978. In 1978, he returned once again to parish ministry as minister of the First Unitarian Church of Cleveland, OH until 1988. He then became a District Executive of the Southwestern Unitarian Universalist District from 1988-1992. He officially retired from ministry in 1992.\n\nWhile Rev. Brown was District Executive of the Southwestern Unitarian Universalist District, the district established its first Leadership Experience, a training program for lay leaders. Named after Rev. Brown, the District’s Dwight Brown Leadership Experience is “designed to teach and reinforce skills and abilities for leaders and leaders-to-be in UU congregations.”\n\nRev. Brown lived a full and accomplished ministerial life. He proudly walked alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King during the march from Selma to Montgomery, AL in 1965. He also boldly and respectfully provided abortion counseling both before the passing of Roe v. Wade and after.\n\nIn a sermon delivered at the 1982 UUA General Assembly, entitled “Impersonating the Divine: An Essay in Theological Anthropology,” Rev. Brown notes,\n\n“Human history is MY history. What I am today is linked in a living chain of being with all lives past. I am Socrates, probing the mysteries of the mind. I am Moses, proclaiming the majesty of the moral law. I am Jesus, witnessing to the love which animates the process in which I live and move and have my being. I am Galileo, meditating on the pathways of the stars. I am Johan Sebastian Bach, composing temples of beauty out of the raw stuff of the imagination. I am Susan B. Anthony, proclaiming a new era in human development.\n\n“But what is even more significant is that what I am now, as I participate in the complex patterns of humanness which exist in this moment of time, as I connect with the humanness of others in those myriad currents of meaning and sharing which make up the human network, what I am now is and remains a part of the totality of humanness, which is ongoing, continuing, immortal, so in the most simple and literal way, the humanness which is in me will live on, long after that instant of awareness which I call in me has finally faded.”\n\nKnown as a “great intellect who was curious about everything and never stopped learning,” Rev. Brown enjoyed writing, books, computers, sailing, good food, good company, and good conversation. He was especially fond of time spent with his family and friends.\n\nRev. Brown is survived by his loving wife, Marie E. Brown; daughter, Janet E. Darez; daughter, Deborah L. Brister; daughter, Stephanie L. Murray; son, David A. Brown; sister, Elaine Clum; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. He is predeceased by his father, the Rev. O. Dwight Brown; mother, Mae Brown; and mother-in-law, Grace V. Wilson.\n\nA memorial service was held on Saturday, November 3, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. at the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Hill Country, 960 Barnett St., Kerrville, TX 78028. Notes of condolence may be sent to Marie E. Brown at 916 Barnett St., Kerrville, TX 78028.\n\nThe Rev. Helen “Christine” Brownlie died on September 15, 2022, at the age of 75.\n\nChris was born on August 24, 1947, in Dearborn MI to Robert Lesman and Helen Chervinsky. She attended Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches during childhood and early adolescence. Church had always been an important influence and source of solace in her life. Over time, Chris felt uncomfortable with many of the doctrines and creeds. Once she attended college, she discovered a Unitarian Church. This discovery was a wonderful relief for her as she found a place where she could feel both comfortable and challenged by the teachings, she encountered each week.\n\nChris received her Bachelor of Arts in 1970 from the New School for Social Research, NY. Thereafter, she worked full-time as a medical social worker and part-time as a Director of Religious Education (DRE) at the First Jefferson Church, Fort Worth TX (1984–1997). While a DRE, she led a process resulting in the adoption of a congregational policy for staff and volunteers who worked with youth. In 1997, she graduated from Brite Divinity School, TX with her Master of Divinity.\n\nRev. Brownlie was ordained on October 25, 1998, by the First Jefferson Church in Fort Worth. From 1998 to 1999, she served the UU Fellowship of Montgomery AL as an interim minister. The fellowship was in the early stages of the canvass and Rev. Brownlie took an active part in the planning process with the Finance Committee. She worked closely with the Ministerial Search Committee and prepared the fellowship to welcome a full-time minister. Furthermore, she encouraged children’s participation in worship services and was very effective in counseling those in distress, ill, and the aged.\n\nIn 1999, Rev. Brownlie accepted a call from the UU Congregation, Blacksburg VA where she served until 2011. She guided and supported the work of the board and committees and helped the congregation develop a sense of vision and purpose. The congregation showed great improvement under her leadership, particularly in the areas of welcoming, sense of community, and integrating new members. Under her leadership, the RE program grew tremendously; she was very dedicated to the children and presented meaningful adult RE offerings. In 2011, the congregation honored her as minister emerita.\n\nRev. Brownlie’s denominational work included serving as a chaplain for the Southwest District YRUU camp (1996). She facilitated numerous workshops for the Southwest District R.E conference and the RE development program at the district Summer Institute. Moreover, she was a member of the Southwest District RE Committee (1990–1995), UUMA, and LREDA.\n\nThrough her sermons, Rev. Brownlie encouraged, challenged, and guided both the congregation and individuals to be active seekers of truth, goodness, and understanding. She was a friend to the congregants, whatever their age and circumstance; she stood with them in times of grief, celebrated in times of joy; and provided a steady source of care and encouragement throughout. She knew the congregation well and addressed people with relevance to their lives, was very attentive to being available, and created a welcoming environment.\n\nAdditionally, Chris’ involvement in the community and her leadership in addressing social justice concerns were remarkable. She served on the advisory council of Planned Parenthood of Blue Ridge VA, sat on the board of Court Appointed Special Advocated (CASA), and was active with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She volunteered for Hospice West and delivered meals for Meals on Wheels, both in Tuscaloosa AL (1997–1998). In her spare time, she enjoyed reading, gardening, sewing, walking, music, and various crafts.\n\nHer son Colin shared, “I remember in high school, when my mom was driving my friends and me somewhere, listening to the radio when a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song came on the radio. My mom and I sang along together, not caring that anyone else was listening to us.”\n\nHer son Matthew noted, “Some parents make unconditional love look easy. My mom did. Her love for her two sons was as predictable and consistent as air or sky. What I really learned from my mom is that this steadfast, predictable, unconditional love is not to be reserved for your children, or your family, or friends, or immediate community. This kind of love becomes a practice, and this practice can and should be applied to everything. Whatever you encounter: you don’t have to like it, but you can try to love it.”\n\nHer sister Diane shared, “Chris was the first of four daughters, and we would all agree that even as a young child she was serious, an avid reader, and purpose-driven; as her sisters, we didn’t understand that part until we were older. When she announced her decision to become a member of the clergy, this seemed a fit. Attending her ordination was a moment in time when she was truly joyous.”\n\nChristine is survived by husband Russell Flack of Radford VA; sons Matthew Brownlie of Houston TX and Colin Brownlie of Hanoi, Vietnam; and sisters Diane Lesman of Rougemont NC, Claudia Boysen of Eden Prairie MN, and Vicki Estrem of Edina MN.\n\nA memorial service was held on October 8, 2022, at the UU Congregation, Blacksburg VA. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made to a charity of one’s own choosing. Notes of condolences can be written to Russell Flack at 1307 Tyler Avenue, Radford VA 24141.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Orlanda R. Brugnola, whose gentle spirit touched many hundreds of lives through creative artistry, pastoral presence, religious scholarship, committed teaching, tireless work against racism and oppression, and steady dedication to worldwide religion and interfaith dialogue, died unexpectedly on February 24, 2016, at age 69.\n\nIn devotion to interfaith cooperation and interreligious peace, Orlanda planned many conferences and programs to encourage dialogue, including the Parliament of the World’s Religions. She served as president of the Institute for the Study of Genocide for nineteen years and was long and deeply active in the International Association of Liberal Religious Women and the International Association for Religious Freedom (IARF). She served on the board of the IARF’s U.S. Chapter and organized workshops for the IARF’s periodic World Congresses.\n\nA talented studio artist who created art for most of her life, Orlanda exhibited photographs, paintings, drawings, and sculpture in many group shows and more than nine solo shows in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. With over twenty years of curatorial experience and additional interests in poetry and music, she served over twenty years on the Board of Directors of the American Festival of Microtonal Music and six years as president of the Society for the Arts, Religion and Contemporary Culture.\n\nOrlanda didn’t care much for religious labels, but she often numbered herself among “technicians of the sacred” [Jerome Rothenberg, 1968]. As she explained it, these “are beings who, for one reason or another, seem able to live more fully in the mystery.” Her close friend and ministerial colleague, Doris Hunter, described her as a “Renaissance spirit producing works of art, poetry and creative ideas designed to change the world. Orlanda’s interests were boundless and reflected not only an amazing intellectual ability but also an appreciation for the rich diversity of human culture. Above all, Orlanda was a faithful friend to everyone she met. Her presence spread grace to all who knew her.”\n\nOrlanda Rice Brugnola was born on April 1, 1946 to Anthony Brugnola and Kathrine Schwellenbach. She earned a B.A. in psychology at UC Berkeley in 1966, and a M.Div. from Starr King School for the Ministry in 1979. She received certification in mediation, conflict resolution, and art therapy, and was registered as an art therapist by the American Expressive Therapy Association in 1989. In 1998, Orlanda received a Master of Fine Art in Painting from the City University of New York, and in 2014, a Doctorate in Ministry from New York Theological Seminary.\n\nMs. Brugnola was ordained to the ministry in 1979 by the First Unitarian (now UU) Church of Berkeley, California, where she served as a ministerial intern. Beginning as an assistant minister to the First Unitarian Congregational Society of Brooklyn, New York in 1981, she held a variety of ministerial positions at that congregation until being named Chaplain Emerita in 2009. She went on to serve interim ministries at the UU Fellowship of Poughkeepsie (2009-11), the UU Congregation of Hudson Valley (2011-12), and the UU Congregation of Queens (2013-14). In 2013 she was appointed an affiliate minister to the Community Church of New York and then church administrator in 2014, holding both positions until her death.\n\nThe Rev. Ms. Brugnola served over thirty years in various community ministries. She was employed at Columbia University as both UU Chaplain (1988-2011) and Chaplain for the Arts (1989-96), and at Union Theological Seminary as UU Chaplain (2009-11). For thirty-five years (1981-2016), she held an adjunct assistant professorship in the departments of philosophy and interdisciplinary studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York), teaching philosophy and world religions. Through her John Jay connection, she also taught philosophy at the Rikers Island jail complex and at a New York residential drug treatment program. In addition, she spent several years offering courses in ministerial formation and conflict resolution to students at Skidmore College, Union Theological Seminary, and Meadville Lombard Theological School. As a member of Collegium (an association for liberal religious studies), she contributed frequent papers, mostly on the arts in Eastern religions.\n\nMs. Brugnola worked determinedly to dismantle racism and oppression around the world. From 1991 to 2016, she sat on the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) Metro New York District Anti-Racism and Diversity Committee (formally the Racial Concerns Committee), and from 1997 to 2016 she served as an active Board Member of the Clinton Association for a Renewed Environment, an organization seeking to create affordable housing in New York City. She served as co-vice president of Diverse, Revolutionary Unitarian Universalist Multicultural Ministries (DRUUMM) from 2013 to 2015. Committed to the betterment of the wider UU movement, Orlanda served on the UUA Commission on Appraisal from 2003 to 2009, and the UUA Board of Review from 2013 to 2016.\n\nOrlanda received many honors for these diverse contributions to ministry, education, social justice, and the arts. She was elected a fellow of the Society for the Arts and Religion & Contemporary Culture in 1993, and she was elected as the Artist-in-Residence for the Henry Street Settlement in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. From John Jay College she earned a Performance Award for Teaching Faculty in 1999, and recognition for twenty-five years of teaching at the college in 2006. She was recognized for outstanding service by the U.S. Chapter of the IARF in 2006 and received the Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc., Business Visionary Award in 2008.\n\nHer dear friend, Janice Marie Johnson, recalled Orlanda as “… one whose deeds spoke of a generosity of spirit that knew no bounds. Orlanda has been a source not only of inspiration, but indeed of transformation. A woman of many gifts, she had an extraordinary understanding of the complexity of the human condition. She defined and demanded excellence. Her gentle yet sharp eyes and her patient yet unyielding ears were meant to bring confidence and surety. Orlanda hoped to shepherd us to our best selves.”\n\nA memorial service was held on Sunday, April 17, 2016 at The Community Church (UU) of New York. Notes of condolence can be sent in care of the Rev. Bruce Southworth, The Community Church of New York Unitarian Universalist, 40 East 35th Street, New York 10016.\n\nCharles Patrick “Chuck” Campbell died on March 10, 2019 at the age of 81. He was born in Tacoma, Washington 21 October 1937, the only child of Chet and Rowena Campbell. The family moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico after WWII, when Chet worked on converting the labs to post war uses. They moved to Colorado just as Chuck was entering high school, and he graduated from Boulder High in 1955. Eventually he received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from UC Boulder, with a concentration in English literature. His studies were interrupted, however, by a two-year sojourn in the Navy.\n\nWhile at University, Chuck met and married his first wife, Mary Lou. When they confessed to friends that they’d become disenchanted with their childhood faiths, the friends introduced them to the Unitarian Church of Boulder. This encounter was the beginning of Chuck’s 59- year pilgrimage as a Unitarian Universalist.\n\nIn 1964, Chuck was accepted into a Ph.D. program in Boston. But his fellowship wouldn’t cover living expenses, and so he began to pursue other lines of work. He taught literature part-time at two local colleges, and found work with Arthur D. Little, a Cambridge consulting firm. During this time, he and Mary Lou decided to go their separate ways.\n\nTamara (“Tommi”) Wadsworth came into Chuck’s life in 1967. When they married the next year, he became an unofficial Dad to her three children, Dennis, Peter, and Jill. Tommi was also a UU, and together they became active in Boston’s Arlington Street Church. There they befriended a young lawyer named Sue Spencer, who remained friends with them through the years, and who would eventually become a UU minister. In 1979, the Campbells moved to Albuquerque to be closer to Chuck’s parents.\n\nChuck didn’t immediately find a teaching job in Albuquerque. Ever resourceful, he went to work for Mayflower, and for a few years drove moving vans all over the country. In 1982, he and Tommi found teaching jobs at the University of Albuquerque, and when it folded, he began a Ph.D. Program at the University of New Mexico. He earned his doctorate at age 51, in Technical Communication, and landed a tenure-track position at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. He taught at Tech for 12 years, retiring in 1999.\n\nAlthough Chuck had been a “band geek” in high school, his love of the tuba blossomed after he came to Albuquerque. He played with several bands, but developed a passion for the traditional jazz of New Orleans. For 17 years he held the Tuba position with the Route 66 Revelers.\n\nWhen Tommi died in 2011, Chuck’s long friendship with Sue Spencer blossomed into “something more,” and they married in 2012. From then until Chuck’s death, they counted themselves blessed to be together. When Sue became the Developmental Minister in Las Cruces, Chuck became the best clergy spouse anyone could ask for.\n\nChuck had been diagnosed in 2007 with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). For many years he was active despite this life-threatening illness — traveling, playing music, enjoying the out of doors, going to church, and generally finding joy in life. In the last 10 days of his life, he played three Mardi Gras gigs and one concert band practice, before the disease process finally caught up with him.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the Rev. Dr. Suzanne Redfern-Campbell, two stepchildren from his prior marriage to the late Tamara G. Campbell, and many beloved family members.\n\nA memorial service was held on April 13, 2019 at the First Unitarian Church of Albuquerque, NM, where Chuck was a member for almost 40 years.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, or to the Ministerial Internship Program at First Unitarian Church of Albuquerque, 3701 Carlisle Boulevard NE, Albuquerque, NM 87110. UURMaPA will contribute $50 in his honor to the Albuquerque church.\n\nNotes of condolence can be sent to Sue Redfern-Campbell, 6118 Edith Blvd NE, Unit 20, Albuquerque, NM 87107.\n\nThe Rev. I. Gregg Carter, parish minister, amateur organist and music lover, and expert calligrapher, died on 20 April 2014 at the age of 85.\n\nIra Gregg Carter was born 28 February 1929 in Birmingham, Alabama, the only child of Joseph and Lena (Gregory) Carter, but soon moved with his parents to the small town of Amory, Mississippi, where he grew up and attended a Bible-centered church with his mother. After high school he began study at Southwestern College, a small historically Presbyterian school in Memphis.\n\nOnce there, he later recalled, “my childhood faith lasted only a few weeks.” As a quintessential seeker and “constant questioner,” he found his way to the Unitarian church in Memphis, where the Rev. Richard B. Gibbs articulated religious views that “made sense” and provided a “pivotal link” in Mr. Carter’s eventual pursuit of professional ministry. After earning a B.S. in psychology and sociology in 1949 from Southwestern (renamed Rhodes College in 1984), he was a social worker for the Tennessee Department of Welfare and then entered active duty in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Honorably discharged with the rank of corporal, he enrolled at Meadville Lombard Theological School and received his B.D. in 1956.\n\nGregg Carter was ordained to the Unitarian ministry by the Westminster Congregational Society (Unitarian) in Providence (now in East Greenwich), where he continued serving as minister until 1963. While there, parishioners introduced him to Jane Parrott, an M.A. student in English at the University of Rhode Island in nearby Kingston. They were married in 1961. After a call to the Unitarian Church of Staten Island (1963-68) and a one-year yoked ministry with the Unitarian Church of Sharon and the First Universalist Church of Foxborough (1968-69), he went on to parish settlements at the Unitarian Church of Marlborough and Hudson (1969-74), the UU Church of Greater Lynn (1974-77), and the First Congregational Parish in Kingston (1977-88)—all in Massachusetts.\n\nHe concluded his parish career with seven years of interim ministries at the UU Congregation of Fort Wayne, Indiana (1989-91), the Oak Ridge (Tennessee) UU Church (1991-92), the UU Church (now the Unity Temple UU Congregation) in Oak Park, Illinois (1992-93), and the First Universalist Church of Yarmouth, Maine (1994-95). In retirement, he lived in Somerset, Mass, on Cape Cod.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Carter served the UUA and his ministerial colleagues in several capacities. He was a member of the Southern New England Unitarian Council (1957-58), advisor to the Narragansett Federation of Liberal Religious Youth (1957-58), secretary of the Channing Conference of Unitarian Churches (1957-58). president and scribe of the Channing-Murray Unitarian Ministers’ Association (1957-61), board member of the New England Unitarian Ministers’ Association (1957-61), program chair of the Greenfield Study Group of UU Ministers (1962-64), member of the Social Concerns Committee of the Metro NY UU Churches (1966-67), program chair and secretary-treasurer of the Central Massachusetts chapter of the UUMA (1971-72), and treasurer of the Unitarian Sunday School Society (1976-77).\n\nMr. Carter was an amateur organist and had a lifelong appreciation for music. He was a talented student of calligraphy and taught several classes on the subject. Additionally, he was fascinated with the history of religion, and was an avid reader. His wife Jane recalls him as “one of the kindest people who ever walked the earth; . . . everyone who knew him felt that way about him.” She remembers him fondly as a “wonderful father” and a gifted minister who was “excellent at extemporaneous prayers and preaching.”\n\nBesides his wife, Gregg Carter is survived by son Scott Barton Carter, daughter Catherine E. Carter, son-in-law Kevin Seward, sister-in law Marcia Akerholm, and many cousins in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Virginia.\n\nIn gratitude to the Cape Cod program that has provided ongoing support for Gregg and Jane’s son Scott, who is challenged by autism and epilepsy, the family encourages donations in Gregg Carter’s name and memory to CapeAbilities, 895 Mary Dunn Road, Hyannis, Massachusetts 02601.\n\nNotes of condolence may be sent in care of Jane Carter, 103 Sanford Ave, Somerset, Massachusetts 02726-5209.\n\nThe Rev. R. Lanier Clance, 74, died on April 15, 2013. Rev. Clance was born in Jacksonville, FL on December 18, 1938 to Henry and Eloise Clance. He attained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Lynchburg College in 1965. He also earned a Bachelor of Divinity from Lexington Theological Seminary in 1965.\n\nRev. Clance was ordained at the First Universalist Church in North Olmstead, OH on February 20, 1966. He was called to serve the First Universalist Church (now the Olmstead Unitarian Universalist Congregation) in 1965, and he stayed there until 1974. He then went on to found the First Existentialist Congregation of Atlanta, GA in 1976. He continued to serve there (as well as the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Riverdale in Atlanta, GA from 1996-1998) until his retirement in 2001. He was given the honor of being named Minister Emeritus of the First Existentialist Congregation of Atlanta in 2001.\n\nRev. Clance worked hard to uphold peace and justice in his community and beyond. Being a feminist, humanist, and all-around political activist, it comes as no surprise that his beliefs led him to work with the National Organization of Women (N.O.W.), the American Civil Liberties Union (A.C.L.U.), and various other community organizations.\n\nA practitioner of Gestalt and existentialist therapies, Rev. Clance also counseled couples and individuals, and “was a compassionate and forthright companion through his clients’ suffering and joy.”\n\nIn 1976, Rev. Clance and eight other people joined together to form the First Existentialist Congregation of Atlanta. They would eventually build its membership to 450 members by 1981. As one of the founders, Rev. Clance helped form a congregation which was intentionally diverse, bringing together folks from many different communities and helping them view life through a more expansive and generous lens. “As a speaker and leader, he was known for his spontaneity, honesty, and gift of being present in the moment. His legacy includes both a profound acceptance of others as they were and his dedication to urging his congregants to become more fully themselves.”\n\nIn “An Existential Ministry: Theory and Practice,” Rev. Clance speaks on his ministerial approach:\n\nI consider my preaching to be Life-Centered. Intellectual concepts are drawn from philosophy, theology, psychology and other disciplines of study. I do not present lectures on these subjects. I do use these areas of knowledge to illuminate and illustrate my particular responses and reactions to life problems of human existence as well as the joys. I believe such preaching creates a dual response. The initial response is to my particular answers and analysis. A more profound response is created by providing individuals with a few concrete answers which they can accept or reject. Namely, they can then work out their own position or faith. I am personally more excited when an individual states something I said started him thinking about an issue or increased his awareness of his own feelings and ideas than when I hear another repeat what I have said as if it were the truth.\n\nA friend noted, “Lanier will be remembered for his gift of engaging others in opening their spirits to know and celebrate the depth of human experience in each moment.”\n\nRev. Clance is survived by his life partners, who have both cared for him for the last 40 years, Pauline Rose and Nancy Zumoff.\n\nA memorial service was planned for Sunday, May 12, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. at the First Existentialist Congregation of Atlanta, 470 Candler Park Dr. NE, Atlanta, GA 30307.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the First Existentialist Congregation of Atlanta.\n\nNotes of condolence may be sent to Pauline Rose Clance and Nancy Zumoff at 1293 Fairview Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA 30306.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Bruce C. Clear died on October 9, 2022, at the age of 72.\n\nBruce was born on June 9, 1950, in Anderson IN, to Dr. Val B. Clear and Evelyn R. Clear. He was raised in a devoutly Christian family which regularly attended the Church of God (Anderson IN). As a youth, Bruce felt at home in the church and fully expected that the church would become a major part of his life. He was always interested in religion and missionaries. Over time, he grew apart intellectually and doctrinally from the church he was raised. When he went to college, he discovered a Unitarian Universalist church. This discovery made him feel that he could reclaim his childhood and youthful devotion feeling religiously and intellectually at home.\n\nIn 1972, Bruce graduated from Anderson College, IN with a double major in political science and history following which he received his Master of Arts in Political Science (1974) from Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. From 1974 to 1979, he worked for the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, doing research for the Congregational Research Service and then as a Public Information Specialist for the U.S Copyright Office.\n\nAfter his work at the Library of Congress, Bruce developed a desire to work closely with people in a religious setting and decided to devote his life to liberal religion in the form of the Unitarian Universalist ministry. Following this call, he earned his Master of Arts in Religion from the University of Chicago in 1981 and a Doctor of Ministry from Meadville Lombard Theological School in 1983.\n\nRev. Dr. Clear was ordained jointly by the Michael Servetus Fellowship of Vancouver (now the UU Church of Vancouver) WA, and the Eastrose Fellowship of Portland OR on November 26, 1983. He served as an extension minister to his ordaining congregations from 1983 to 1986. (Neither had ever had a minister in their 30 year histories.)\n\nRev. Clear served three-quarter time in Vancouver and a quarter time at Eastrose. He knew both congregations well, was caring and understanding, and especially supportive of people in crisis. By the end of his three-year commitment, Vancouver nearly doubled in size, and Eastrose had a half-time minister. In 1986, Vancouver called him to a full-time ministry. Under his ministry, the congregation grew rapidly, eventually leading to a new church building.\n\nIn 1993, he accepted a call from All Souls Unitarian Church, Indianapolis IN, where he served until 2011. During his tenure, he helped with the Welcoming Congregation process and Green Sanctuary certification. He also strongly supported the music program.\n\nRev. Dr. Clear was a highly motivated minister who had a natural leadership ability that could be felt. He established a feeling of at-homeness among members and prospective members of the congregation. He could relate well to a diversity of people. His sermons challenged the members, individually and collectively, to reflect consciously on their lives.\n\nRev. Dr. Bruce’s denominational work included serving on the Executive Board of the UU Ministers Association (1991–1993). He taught at the Pacific Northwest District (PNWD) Leadership School, including two Advanced Schools (Worship and Congregation as Family Systems) and three years of Basic School. He was Good Offices Person for the PNWD UU Ministers Association and served as “minister to ministers” in difficult times. He was invited to preach at the 1991 PNWD Annual Meeting in Kelowna BC.\n\nHe wrote on issues such as censorship in schools, religion and state, Nicaragua, free speech, and reproductive rights. The UUA Department of Ministry published his essay on church conflict, “What I Have Learned about Churches and Ministers as Good Offices Person.”\n\nIn addition to his ministry and denominational services, Bruce was an outspoken community advocate for progressive and humanitarian causes. He served as a secretary of the Vancouver Association of Churches (1988–91) and as President of the Southwest Washington American Civil Liberties Union (1989–1991). In his leisure time, he enjoyed skiing, playing guitar, and learning about and listening to music. He also loved traveling and had a deep interest in other cultures.\n\nBruce is survived by his spouse Nancy Renner; brothers, Scott Clear and Todd Clear; son Cameron Clear; stepdaughter Carly Wise; and stepsons: Edward Kennedy, Gregory Kennedy, and Shane Kennedy. He was preceded in death by his stepdaughter Kelsey Kennedy.\n\nA memorial service was held on October 15, 2022, at the Glacier Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, 1515 Trumble Creek Rd, Kalispell MT 59901. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made to Trinity Haven. Notes of condolences can be written to Cameron Clear: cameronclear@yahoo.com.\n\nThe Reverend Maurice W. Cobb of West Newfield, Maine — parish minister, religious educator, dedicated community social activist for justice and humanitarian causes, and DIY house builder — died in the Southern Maine Medical Center on 10 September 2015, aged 97.\n\nThe mainstay of his ministry was social action. His politics were as liberal as his theology, and ethics for him were situational. His friends attest to his giving and tolerant spirit; he was warm and witty, yet probing and perceptive. During his ministry in Brunswick, if anyone wanted access to help or services that were hard to come by, Maurice was known to be the one with the cosmic connection. He worked with those who back then were not well served by the system. Up until the day of his death he was aware that they are still with us, and they were in his thoughts.\n\nMaurice Wendell Cobb was born on 4 March 1918 in Winchester, New Hampshire, but was raised in Brattleboro, Vermont, by his parents Richard Cobb and Lelia Lampson Cobb. His lifelong love of rural living began as he worked every summer on his grandfather’s farm — making hay, hitching up the horses to go to town, and bringing the cows home in the afternoon. Cold water in a tin cup was always Maurice’s favorite drink.\n\nMr. Cobb studied at the Crane Theological School of Tufts University and was ordained in 1943 at the White Street Universalist Church in East Boston, Massachusetts, where he had served as student minister the previous year and continued for an additional year. In 1944 he accepted a call to a yoked ministry with three churches in North Carolina’s Clinton Circuit — Hopewell, Clinton, and Red Hill — where he served until 1948. He took on an interim ministry in Derby Line, Vermont, in 1949, meanwhile studying for an M.A. in philosophy at the University of North Carolina, which he completed in 1953. Subsequent calls were to Attica-Belleville, Ohio (1953-57), Dolgeville and Salisbury Center, New York (1957-64), and Brunswick, Maine (1964-76).\n\nThe move to Brunswick in 1964 began a 12 year ministry, during which the Rev. Mr. Cobb helped the congregation grow and diversify, reaching out into the community with the social action organizations that meant so much to him: a suicide prevention program, the Bath-Brunswick food coop, and an Amnesty International group. Often at the head of a parade down Maine Street, he protested the wars and racial injustices of the era.\n\nLeaving Brunswick in 1976, he went to New Bedford, Massachusetts, as assistant minister and religious education director (1976-79), and then to Billerica, Mass, as parish minister (1979-83), from which he retired in 1983 as Minister Emeritus. Returning to Maine, Maurice took a course in house design and construction at the Shelter Institute in Bath to prepare himself to build the only house he ever owned with the help of the Log Cabin Kits, in West Newfield. The construction was an adventure he never tired of retelling, and he dearly loved his home. There he remained for the rest of his life, interrupting his retirement just once for a part-time ministry to the nearby Sanford Unitarian Universalist Church (1998-2000).\n\nThroughout his retirement he continued his life work, lending support to Peace Action Maine, Amnesty International, Native American advocacy, and AARP. Gardening, letter writing, and the Red Sox were the relaxing pursuits of a long happy retirement. “He was deeply at peace with himself,” affirms one of his nieces.\n\nNotes of condolence may be sent to Martha Gottlieb: 93 Head Tide Road, Whitefield, Maine 04353, brother Lawrence Cobb, or niece Llynda Bigalow, both of the latter at 77 Cedar Ridge Drive, Shelburne, Vermont 05482.\n\nA memorial service was held in Sanford, Maine at the Sanford Unitarian Universalist Church on 24 October 2015. Memorial donations are encouraged to the charity of the donor’s choosing.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. John Alexie “Lex” Crane — long-time parish minister, social activist, and mentor to aspiring colleagues — whose dry and acerbic wit complemented a persona at once gentle and curmudgeonly, died on August 7, 2015, at the age of 93.\n\nLex was a voracious reader, a talented writer, and an impressive polymath. His children fondly recall his intelligence; his son, Jack, writes: “He developed a love of study, stayed abreast of thinking in literature, the arts, liberal theology, philosophy, and social sciences. This passion coupled with his oratorical skills, made Lex unusually able to communicate the big ideas to folk who didn’t have the leisure or luxury of regular study.” These wide-ranging interests led Lex and his wife Ginny to travel throughout the world, venturing to Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Especially memorable was a semester in China with Santa Barbara City College in 1989, where they witnessed the student protests at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Crane became a minor celebrity in 1962 when the fear-mongering agenda of the John Birch Society (then recently founded) came to his attention, and he responded with a prophetic sermon against the organization’s ideology and activities. Shortly thereafter Santa Barbara’s local newspaper ran a special edition with a front page anti-Birch editorial and a reprint of Mr. Crane’s sermon text on the inside. The Associated Press picked up the story, and a CBS-TV crew with newsman Harry Reasoner showed up to film Lex redelivering his sermon from the Santa Barbara pulpit. Although pro-Birch vandals spray-painted a hammer and sickle on the church’s exterior and threw rotten vegetables at the parsonage, the episode eventually contributed to crippling the Birchers’ influence across the country. For his role, John Alexie Crane was awarded an honorary doctorate by Starr King School for the Ministry. His sermon text closed with a reflection of notable empathy:\n\n“We ought to try not to hate them [local Birch activists], be disgusted with them, shout and snarl at them, for this will only drive them deeper into their relation with the group, for there they will find acceptance and confirmation. We ought to be as patient as we can, realizing that the people are doing what they feel they must do. They are as much to be pitied as censured. They are terribly frightened. Everywhere they look they see Communists. They don’t know whom to trust, to depend on. Don’t condemn them. Don’t threaten them. Let them talk about their views. Question them closely. Sometimes just hearing their own words spoken in the presence of someone who is calm and rational will help them to feel their absurdity. Be patient. Be firm. This too will pass, if we are alert and watchful.”\n\nJohn Alexie Crane was born in Baltimore on January 14, 1922 to John A. and Minnie E. Crane. He was graduated from the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute in 1939 and served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945 in both the South Pacific and Europe, suffering severe wounds during the Battle of the Bulge. He returned to earn a B.A. in English in 1949, an M.A. in creative writing in 1950 from Johns Hopkins University, an M.Div. from Starr King School for the Ministry in 1951, and—midway through a long pastorate in Santa Barbara—a second M.A. (in social psychology) from the University of California in 1971, leading to his licensure as a California Marriage and Family Counselor.\n\nMr. Crane began his career in parish ministry in 1951 with a call to the First Unitarian Church in Vancouver, BC, where he was ordained the next year and served until 1955. He moved on to ministry at the (now UU) Community Church of Park Forest, Illinois (1955-58), the Unitarian Society of Santa Barbara, California (1958-77), and the Jefferson Unitarian Church of Golden, Colorado (1977-81). After two years as the UUA’s Director of Ministerial Education (1981-83), the Rev. Mr. Crane returned to the parish with a call to UU Church of Yakima, Washington, serving there until his retirement in 1987, upon which he was named Minister Emeritus. Unwilling to relax his commitment to UU parish service, he spent the next fifteen years of his “retirement” serving interim ministries in Southern California. After a final retirement in 2002, he was voted Minister Emeritus to the Unitarian Society of Santa Barbara.\n\nIn addition to social service and activism outside congregational walls in communities where he served, the Rev. Mr. Crane lent his support to the wider UU movement. He served three terms on the Executive Board of the UUMA (1963-65, 1973-75, and 1991-92), editing the UUMA newsletter during his first term. His passion for ministerial education and personal mentoring was deepened by this experience. He went on to serve as a Trustee of Starr King School for the Ministry (1968-74) and on the faculty and staff of UU leadership schools (1984-87, 1993-95). In 2008 he received the annual Creative Sageing Award of the UU Retired Ministers and Partners Association.\n\nIn addition to a booklet “Developing an Extended Family Program” (1972) and a number of articles and scholarly papers, Lex Crane published several books, including Keeping in Touch: Self, Sex and Society (1975), Love, Sex and the Human Condition: Getting a Life (2006), A New Perspective on the Philosophy of UU Religion (2008), and To the Best of My Recollection…a memoir (2012).\n\nLex’s wife, Virginia (“Ginny”), survived him by only a few months. Other survivors include sons John (“Jack”) Crane III and Douglas L. Crane, step-daughter Claire Beery, step-sons Evan and Eric Blickenstaff, grandchildren Molly and Allie, Alex and Kirra, Willow, Mira and Zoë, John and Alex, and two great-grandchildren. Lex was preceded in death by a son, David L. Crane.\n\nA memorial service was held on November 22, 2015, at the Unitarian Society of Santa Barbara. Contributions in Lex’s memory are encouraged to Unitarian Society of Santa Barbara, 1535 Santa Barbara St., Santa Barbara, California 93101 (http://www.ussb.org). Letters of condolence may be sent to Jack Crane, 239 1/2 Olive Ave., Long Beach, CA 9O8O2 or jabungusintl@gmail.com.\n\nDorothy “Alden” Wright Davis, 89, died peacefully March 1, 2016 in Eugene, OR. Her husband and her three children were with her as she died. She was the wife of the Rev. Charles A. Reinhardt. Alden would have turned 90 on July 29.\n\nBorn in Bryn Mawr, PA, to Guier Wright and Dorothy Battles Wright on July 29, 1926, Alden was an unabashed intellectual and scholar, traits fostered by her remarkable parents. She grew up with an insatiable curiosity and the conviction that women could do whatever they chose.\n\nIn 1947, Alden graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Mount Holyoke College with a degree in geology. While earning her graduate degree at the University of Michigan, she met Robert I. Davis of Meredith, NH, whom she married in 1949. Over the next 36 years, as they raised their family and relocated frequently, their romance and relationship never faltered.\n\nIn the 1950s, Alden and Bob lived for several years in Mexico before returning to the US where they lived in rural Pennsylvania, the Missouri Ozarks, suburban Connecticut, and the mountains of Colorado among other places. For Alden, every move was an adventure and an opportunity. So, too, was the rearing of their children, Andrew, Philip and Rebecca. As she watched her own children develop, Alden began working with children with developmental issues, particularly autism. In the 1970s, she earned her second graduate degree, this time in developmental disabilities.\n\nAlden and Bob retired to New Hampshire in the 1970s. In Durham, they built a home that Alden designed and which incorporated their favorite elements from the many houses they’d lived in. After Bob’s death in 1985, Alden began working for the Rev. Bob Karnan at UU Church of Portsmouth, South Church, later becoming a member of the congregation. It was there that she met the Rev. Charles Reinhardt, who was doing an interim ministry there.\n\nThey got to know each other well as she helped him sort out a ministerial conflict which was splintering the church. Chuck knew she could be counted on to provide reliable information. Their collegial relationship became deeper and Alden and Chuck married in1997. The couple lived in Newcastle, until 2014, when they moved to Eugene, OR. Her second marriage proved to be as deep and enduring as the first. Alden found the love of her life: twice.\n\nOver many years Alden enjoyed presidential politics, relying on the PBS News Hour. She had no use for commercial television. Instead she and Chuck enjoyed several book clubs and the New York Review of Books.\n\nIn 1997 Alden joined Chuck in his home in Sheepscot, Maine. Alden soon joined a local University of Maine Extension group serving local women, working with monthly sessions, and providing transportation for those members who no longer drove. She also joined Chuck in the local Midcoast UU Fellowship as well, notably, in the special effort to rescue the Sheepscot Community Church with new growth.\n\nChuck and Alden enjoyed Elderhostel programs in Scandinavia. They also visited the Grand Canyon, Greece (with Canadian clergy and UUs, including Alan Deale and Kathleen Hunter, and Chuck Eddis).\n\nAs she got older, Alden traveled less, but never lost her intellectual curiosity or her zest for life. Alden approached the many transitions in her life with enthusiasm, curiosity and a Zen-like acceptance of change. Shortly before her death, while reviewing the many moves she’d made, she noted, “there’s just one more move I have to make.”\n\nShe always said her proudest accomplishment was to raise three kids into adults whom she not only loved but liked. Her pride in her children was evident to all who knew her.\n\nAlden is survived by her husband; her children; granddaughter, Leah; great-grandchildren, Elias and Astrid Alden; sister, Patricia Hume; and numerous nieces, nephews, stepchildren and grandchildren.\n\nSympathy notes may be sent to: Chuck Reinhardt, 65 W 30th Ave., #3403, Eugene, OR 97405.\n\nThe Rev. Robert T. “Bob” Dick, gentle parish minister, lifelong pacifist, advocate for racial justice, and active volunteer for community service in retirement, died peacefully and in comfort at age 97 on May 31, 2014, at the Doolittle Home in Foxboro, Mass, where he had resided since 1994.\n\nAlthough he was a student at Tufts’ Crane School of Religion in the early 1940s, Mr. Dick waived his wartime theological exemption and served as a conscientious objector in Civilian Public Service units for four years in New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York, working in forestry, on ward duty in mental hospitals, and as a subject in experiments in nutrition, high altitude, heat, and dehydration at the University of Rochester Medical School in New York. In later years he edited a booklet, Guinea Pigs for Peace: The Story of C.P.S. 115-R (1943–1946), about those experiments.\n\nRobert Tyrrell Dick was born in Stockton, Illinois, on 17 December 1916, one of six children of Joseph R. Dick and Alma Tyrrell Dick. After his mother’s death when he was seven, Bob was raised primarily by an older sister. He attended the local Universalist church as a child and later told his son Jeff that “if it were not for the encouragement and support of the ‘ladies of the Universalist church’ he would not have gone to college nor into the ministry.” He was graduated from Stockton High School in 1935, where his fellow students elected him senior class president and foresaw his future career, in the school yearbook, as “President of the United States.” After thirteen months in the Civilian Conservation Corps in Idaho and Oregon, Mr. Dick attended the University of Dubuque (Iowa) for a time before going on to earn an AB degree from Tufts University in 1942. While on the summer work crew at Ferry Beach in the late 1930s, he met fellow crew member Helen Hersey, also a Crane student at Tufts and the daughter of Universalist minister Harry Adams Hersey. In 1943 they were married in Helen’s home town of Danbury, Conn. After finishing his wartime service, Bob returned to ministerial study, receiving his BD degree from Colgate-Rochester Divinity School in 1948.\n\nOver the next thirty-six years, Mr. Dick went on to serve Universalist and UU parishes in the East and Midwest, first at the Universalist Church (now United Church–UCC) of Bristol, New York (1948-51), where he was ordained, as he recalls, “to the Christian ministry” on September 19, 1948. After three years there, he moved to the First Universalist Church of Lyons, Ohio (1951-57) and then back east as associate minister to the Universalist Church of West Hartford, Conn. (1957-59). He returned to Ohio to serve a circuit of Universalist churches in Belpre, Frost, and Little Hocking (1959-64), and then headed east once again to the ministry of the Universalist Church of South Acton (now the First Parish Church of Stow and Acton), Massachusetts (1964-67). A yoked ministry to the Universalist churches of Springfield (now UU) and Chester Depot in Vermont (1967-76) was followed by a call to the UU Fellowship of Elkhart, Indiana, where he served until retirement in 1984 and was designated minister emeritus.\n\nIn support to ministerial colleagues and the wider UU movement, Mr. Dick served on the board of the UU Service Committee, as a Good Officer in the NH/VT chapter of the UUMA, and as advisor to the Erie Shore Federation of Religious Youth.\n\nIn 1986, Bob and Helen moved back to Springfield, Vermont, and joined the UU congregation there where he had earlier served as minister. Two years later, in 1988, on the 40th anniversary of his ordination, the Springfield congregation also named him their own Minister Emeritus. In retirement, Bob became active as a hospice volunteer and in the local work of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), was a member of Springfield’s Senior Center Advisory Board, and had a leading role in the formation of a Vermont Chapter of the United Nations Association of the USA, serving on its board.\n\nIn his steady and faithful concern for peace, racial justice, and many other progressive social causes, the Rev. Mr. Dick was a fifty-year member of the interfaith peace organization, Fellowship of Reconciliation, a life member of the NAACP, and a charter member of Common Cause. In 1981 he was honored with the Adin Ballou Peace Award of the Unitarian Universalist Peace Fellowship. His and Helen’s work for peace lighted a path for others. Sandy and John Zinn, for example, recalled that they “got to know Bob & Helen in Elkhart from their involvement in local peace efforts. We were not members of [the UU Fellowship of Elkhart] at the time, but it was partly from their witness that we later joined. They lived their beliefs.”\n\nIn 1994 Bob and Helen moved to the Doolittle Home in Foxboro, Mass, and joined the Foxboro Universalist Church (UU). Helen died in 2008 after 65 years of marriage, but Bob continued to enjoy visits at the Doolittle Home from groups of local children.\n\nBob is survived by sons Nathan Dick of Estes Park Colorado, and Jeffrey Taft-Dick of Springfield, Vermont, a daughter Noreen Redd of San Diego, and grandchildren Jonathan, Joya and Philip Taft-Dick.\n\nIn lieu of a formal memorial service, Robert Dick’s life was remembered and honored as part of the Elkhart Fellowship’s annual Founders Day service on October 5, 2014, conducted by their minster, the Rev. Amy Kulesza DeBeck.\n\nMr. Dick’s ashes are buried alongside those of his late wife Helen in the Ladies Union Cemetery, Stockton, Illinois. Memorial gifts are encouraged either to the Doolittle Home, 16 Bird St., Foxboro, Mass. 02035, or to the UURMaPA Endowment Fund, c/o Paul L’Herrou, treasurer, UU Retired Ministers and Partners Association, 38 Kimball Avenue, #12, Ipswich, Mass. 01938.\n\nThe Rev. Lewis “Lew” H. Dunlap died on September 7, 2023, at the age of 97 (1926-2023).\n\nLew was born on April 19, 1926, in Warrensburg MO to William Preston Dunlap and Edith Grace Boyd Dunlap. He was the youngest of three children. In 1936, his family moved to Rolla MO where he graduated high school (1943). Lew was called into active duty in the US Army Air Corps in 1944 and was discharged in 1946. After being discharged, he enrolled at Missouri Valley College and received his Bachelor of Arts (1951) following which he went to McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago graduating with his Master of Divinity (1954). Lew then served as a United Presbyterian minister until he was assigned to the Air Force as a Presbyterian chaplain in 1960. He retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1977.\n\nIn 1968, Lew began a radical change in his theology. He began to consider humanism and discovered the First Universalist Church in Denver CO. There he felt at home philosophically. He became active in both the First Universalist Church and the American Humanist Association. At the First Universalist Church, he served as hymn leader at Sunday morning services, sat on the board, and was active on the Lay Ministry Committee.\n\nHe represented the congregation on the Colorado Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice Board. Thereafter, Lew wanted to extend his ministry to the congregation and to the greater community. He sought to stimulate, encourage, and provide avenues for the development of love, kindness, compassion, and justice through becoming a UU minister.\n\nRev. Dunlap was ordained by the First Universalist Church, Denver CO, on May 23, 1999. Following ordination, he served the Borderlands UU, Amado AZ (2000–2001) and the UU Congregation of Green Valley AZ (2000–2001). At Green Valley, he actively supported the Canvass Committee and successfully stimulated interest in developing an endowment fund within the congregation. From 2001 to 2002, he served the UU Fellowship at Burlington IA as their interim minister. In 2002, he accepted a call from the UU Church of Greeley CO where he would minister until 2003. Rev. Dunlap exemplified the kind of enthusiasm and commitment that made church life compelling. He ministered with dedication and commitment.\n\nRev. Dunlap was one of the organizers of a new UU congregation, Prairie UU Church, in the Parker CO area. He cared enough to start a new congregation to spread the news of UUlism to the southeastern suburbs. He also served as a regional Coordinator of the UU Service Committee (2005).\n\nIn the larger community, he provided his services as a board member of the Colorado Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, as a founder and coordinator of the Rational Recovery Systems of Colorado, and as a founding and board member of the Colorado Council of Mediators and Mediation Organizations. Likewise, he served as a founder/leader of the Denver Chapter American Humanist Association.\n\nThroughout his life, Lew loved travel, music, bridge, and community theater. He played the piano, guitar, and trumpet, and sang tenor in various local choirs. He also loved baseball and once again proved he had no intention of slowing down, attending the Colorado Rockies Fantasy camp for four years between the ages of 88 and 91! He used his age as his player number.\n\nHis son Paul shared: Lew’s “radical shift” in theology initially bordered on atheism fueled by the more anti-religionist elements in the AHA. However, he later repeatedly described the UUA as not anti-god or anti-religion, but open to all beliefs. And over the last few years of his life, his favorite TV viewing has been “The Chosen” a very Biblical and realistic multi-season series about Jesus and his disciples.\n\nLew is survived by his first wife, Katherine Dunlap; his children: Ruth Anne Hitchcock (Darrell), Paul Dunlap (Karen), and David Dunlap (Tracey); as well as his twelve grandchildren and nineteen great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his second wife, Phyllis Dolan, and is also survived by her four children: Kathryn Dolan, Connie Seguin, Albert Dolan, and Michael Dolan; and one grandson.\n\nA memorial open house was held on Sunday, Oct. 15, 2023, at St. Andrews Village, 13801 E. Yale Ave, Aurora CO 80014.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Prairie UU Church <https://prairieuu.org/give>.

Giles, whose career spanned fifty-four years of distinguished service in parish ministry, denominational leadership, and armed forces chaplaincy, died on July 2, 2013, at the Illinois Veterans’ Home in Quincy, Illinois, aged 96.\n\nMr. Giles was especially energetic and influential in organizational work as the last General Superintendent of the Universalist Church of America (UCA) prior to its consolidation with the American Unitarian Association (AUA) in 1961. He later recalled that the Universalists were “wary of power and institutions,” and he set about to strengthen the UCA “so it could carry more of its weight in the merger.” Under his revitalizing program, Operation Bootstrap, some of the influence of independent state Universalist conventions was shifted to the national office, internal communication was improved, the UCA’s financial base was strengthened, ministerial pensions were increased, several congregations moved to new or renovated buildings, and publication was expanded. He saw these changes as essential for the future, whether for a self-sustaining UCA or in preparation for consolidation with the AUA. In the words of a family member,\n\n“His commitment to the liberal religious movement mirrored his philosophy that each generation is responsible to help succeeding generations move forward. He always said, “Your generation doesn’t owe anything to mine. We hold you on our shoulders and you will do the same for your children.”\n\nPhilip Randall Giles was born in Haverhill, Mass. on January 23, 1917 to Nelson R. and Ina Butler Giles. He earned a B.A. from Tufts College and an S.T.B. from Crane Theological School, both in 1942, and later received honorary doctorates from Tufts and St. Lawrence University.\n\nIn 1939, during his student years at Tufts, Mr. Giles began parish ministry at the Universalist Church in Southbridge, Mass, where he was ordained by the Massachusetts Universalist Convention on May 10, 1942. Meanwhile, in June of 1941, he was married to Aurelie Proctor of Fayville, Mass. After ordination he entered the Army Air Corps as a chaplain, spending two years in New Guinea and several months in Tokyo during the occupation. Thereafter he joined the Air Force Reserves a"
