        "text": "Oscar Peterson: the \"Maharaja of the Keyboard\"\n\nLearn more about the life of the prolific pianist\n\nCanadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson was an eight-time Grammy Award-winning jazz pianist, often considered to be one of the greatest of all time. During his six decade career, he released over 200 recordings. Why not take a look at his long and fruitful career?\n\nWhere was Oscar Peterson born?\n\nOscar Peterson was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1925. He was the son of immigrants from the West Indies and his father was an amateur trumpeter and pianist.\n\nWhen did Oscar Peterson start playing?\n\nOscar Peterson began studying music at the age of five, playing trumpet and piano like his father. However, Peterson had to give up the trumpet at the age of seven after a bout of tuberculosis.\n\nPeterson's talent was recognised after winning a talent show at the age of 14, which led him to star on a weekly radio show in Montreal.\n\nHow did Oscar Peterson become famous?\n\nOscar Peterson began recorded in 1945, recording an impressive 32 projects for Victor whilst in Montreal. In 1949, he was approached by jazz impresario Norman Granz after having heard him on the radio in a taxi. Granz and Peterson's partnership and friendship would last for most of Peterson's career. Peterson was reportedly Granz's favourite pianist, which was a large reason why Peterson made so many records in his lifetime.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Peterson met double bassist Ray Brown, who began playing with each other as duo. In 1953, Peterson also teamed up with guitarist Herb Ellis and together with Brown, the group formed the Oscar Peterson Trio, becoming one of the great trios of the 1950s.\n\nPeterson continued to work with trios during the 1960s and 1970s, but also performed as a solo act in the 1970s and made widely renowned works with Dizzy Gillespie and Clark Terry.\n\nWhat style of jazz did Oscar Peterson play?\n\nPeterson was a versatile musician and was not constrained to one style, playing everything from boogie woogie to bebop to swing and much more. He was heavily influenced by the work of pianist Art Tatum.\n\n\"King of inside swing\"\n\nPeterson was known as the \"King of inside swing\", a nickname given to him for his ability and prowess to swing at any tempo because of his dexterity.\n\nOne of Peterson's many fans included Duke Ellington, with the esteemed musician dubbing Peterson the \"Maharaja of the Keyboard\".\n\nOscar Peterson's later career\n\nPeterson carried on working in the 1980s and 1990s, but had a brief break after suffering a major stroke in 1993. Despite this, Oscar pushed through, recovered and made a return to playing and touring.\n\nOscar Peterson continued performing until his health declined in 2007, dying in December that year.\n\nOscar Peterson's legacy\n\nAlong with his Grammy Awards, Peterson is a one of Canada's greatest musicians, being decorated with many honours and statues raised in his name. Currently, there is petition ongoing to name a train station after the musician in his home city of Montreal in Canada."
