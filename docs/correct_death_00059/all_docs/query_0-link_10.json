McCallion said that he died of kidney failure but that she did not know when.\n\nDuring an illustrious career spanning seven decades, Peterson played with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie. He is also remembered for touring in a trio with Ray Brown on bass and Herb Ellis on guitar in the 1950s.\n\nPeterson’s impressive collection of awards include all of Canada’s highest honors, such as the Order of Canada, as well as a Lifetime Grammy (1997) and a spot in the International Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nHis growing stature was reflected in the admiration of his peers. Duke Ellington referred to him as “Maharajah of the keyboard,” while Count Basie once said “Oscar Peterson plays the best ivory box I’ve ever heard.”\n\n“The world has lost an important jazz player,” said McCallion. “It isn’t just a loss for Canada, he was world famous.”\n\nBorn Aug. 15, 1925, in a poor neighborhood southwest of Montreal, Peterson inherited a passion for music from his father. Daniel Peterson, a railway porter and self-taught musician, bestowed his love of music to his five children, offering them a means to escape from poverty. Oscar Peterson learned to play trumpet and piano at a young age, but after a bout with tuberculosis had to concentrate on the latter.\n\nHe became a teen sensation in his native Canada, playing in dance bands and recording in the late 1930s and early 1940s. But he got his real break as a surprise guest at Carnegie Hall in 1949, after which he began touring the United States and Europe.\n\nIn 2005 he became the first living person other than a reigning monarch to be honored on a commemorative stamp in Canada, where he is jazz royalty. Streets, squares, concert halls and schools are named after him.\n\nPeterson suffered a stroke in 1993 that weakened his left hand, but not his passion or drive for music. Within a year he was back on tour, recording “Side By Side” with Itzhak Perlman.\n\nAs he grew older, Peterson kept playing and touring, despite worsening arthritis and difficulties walking.\n\n“A jazz player is an instant composer,” Peterson once said in a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. interview, while conceding jazz did not have the mass appeal of other musical genres. “You have to think about it, it’s an intellectual form,” he said.\n\nOriginally Published: December 24, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
