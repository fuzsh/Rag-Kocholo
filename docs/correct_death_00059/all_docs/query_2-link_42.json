        "text": "A Legend Is Born\n\nOscar Peterson was born on August 15, 1925. The fourth of five children, he was raised by a loving family who lived in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood of Montreal. It was here that Oscar first discovered his love of music.\n\nOscar’s childhood home was always full of music. Because his father strongly believed in the importance of musical education, each child in the Peterson family learned how to play the piano. So, at the age of five, Oscar started to play. After a bout of illness that affected his lungs (and his ability to play the trumpet—another instrument he was learning), Oscar began to focus exclusively on playing the piano. By the time he was eight years old, it was clear that a musical star was in the making.\n\nInspiration All Around\n\nInspiration All Around\n\nOscar’s older sister, Daisy, was his first teacher. Tasked with teaching her younger siblings music theory and piano, Daisy played a pivotal role in Oscar’s musical development. Oscar later credited Daisy—as well as his classical piano teacher, Paul de Marky—for helping him believe that he had something to offer the musical world.\n\nOscar got his first taste of jazz from the records and radio broadcasts his older brother listened to, and he was greatly influenced by popular jazz pianists of the era: Nat King Cole, Teddy Wilson, and especially Art Tatum. Montreal’s music scene was a source of inspiration as well—Oscar once said, “I had to teach myself […] by being around the jazz that was being played in Montreal at that time.”\n\nPath To Greatness\n\nPath To Greatness\n\nDedicated to his craft, Oscar practiced diligently and as often as possible. At age 14, thanks to the encouragement of his sister Daisy, he entered a nationwide amateur talent competition and won first place. This achievement led to Oscar’s first public performances and work, including his own weekly radio show, Fifteen Minutes Piano Rambling. By the early 1940s, Oscar was a rising star on the Montreal jazz scene.\n\nAs Oscar’s popularity grew, he began to receive offers to join American jazz bands. But, feeling that he wasn’t quite ready to leave home and move abroad, Oscar turned them down. Eventually, an opportunity arose for 16 year-old Oscar to play in one of Montreal’s most popular dance bands—and he accepted. Before allowing Oscar to leave school to focus on his music career, his father told him, “I won’t let you leave school to just be a piano player. You must tell me you will be the BEST piano player.”\n\nIt didn’t take long for Oscar to start earning the title of “best,” quickly living up to the promise he made his dad.\n\nA Legend Is Born\n\nCanadian Icon\n\nAs Oscar’s talents continued to grow, so too did his success. He signed with a record label and, in 1945, released his first recordings: I Got Rhythm and The Sheik of Araby. He went on to create 16 records over the next four years. Oscar was frequently featured on CBC radio shows Light Up and Listen and The Happy Gang, and he went on to tour Western Canada twice in 1946.\n\nAs the popularity of his songs spread across the country, Oscar established himself as a bonafide Canadian jazz star. In 1947, he began a residency as the headlining act at the Alberta Lounge—an iconic music venue in the heart of downtown Montreal. Oscar had arrived.\n\nFrom Montreal To Carnegie Hall\n\nFrom Montreal To Carnegie Hall\n\nOne fateful day in 1949, Norman Granz, an influential jazz producer, was taking a taxi to the Montreal airport. Granz was impressed by the music playing on the radio. After asking the cab driver what record it was—and then discovering that the music was actually a live broadcast from the Alberta Lounge—Granz asked the cab driver to turn around and take him there. Granz went on to become Oscar’s manager and remained so until his retirement in 1988. The two also became close friends.\n\nGranz played an important role in furthering Oscar’s career. On September 18, 1949, he introduced Oscar to American audiences during a Jazz at the Philharmonic performance at the renowned Carnegie Hall in New York City. As a surprise guest, Oscar thrilled the audience with his electric piano playing. This was just the beginning of his international debut—within a year, Oscar had captured the hearts of music lovers all around the world.\n\nThe High Notes\n\nThe High Notes\n\nOscar’s career as a pianist and composer continued to flourish. He toured all over the globe, released multiple records a year, and worked with many other legendary jazz artists like Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong, who subsequently called Oscar “the man with four hands.”\n\nOver the years, Oscar was frequently recognized for his artistic contributions and incredible skills. He won seven Grammy awards, a Gemini Award for Best Musical Score, and The Glenn Gould Prize. He also won a Juno Award for Best Jazz Album.\n\nOne of Oscar’s most well-known compositions is Canadiana Suite. A love letter to Canada, the album contains eight movements, each paying homage to the varied regions across the country—from Ballad to the East, to his hometown Place St. Henri, all the way to the Rockies and beyond with Land of the Misty Giants. Oscar had a great love and admiration for Canada, which he continued to call home for the rest of his life.\n\nCanadian Icon"
