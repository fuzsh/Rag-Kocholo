        "text": "Linda Ann (Peterson) Kingsbury, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, cousin and sister-in-law, passed away peacefully on Friday, July 12, 2024, after fighting cancer bravely for years.\n\nBorn on June 9, 1953, to parents Oscar and Olive (Fossum) Peterson, Linda grew up as an only child on her mother's family farm, surrounded by many cousins, aunts, and uncles who played an essential role in her upbringing. She graduated from Peterson High School with the class of 1971 and later attended Winona Technical College.\n\nOn June 19, 1976, Linda married the love of her life, Allan Kingsbury. They celebrated 48 beautiful years together, creating a lifetime of cherished memories. They were blessed with four children: Teresa, Chad, Allison, and Andrew.\n\nLinda began her career at Minnesota Loan and Thrift in Winona, MN. She and Allan then moved to St. Louis Park, MN, where she worked at Honeywell. Later, the couple settled in Waseca, MN, where Linda worked part-time at the local college. When their children arrived, Linda became a dedicated stay-at-home mom. In 1987, the family moved to Linda's century farm, where they continued raising their children, and Linda worked part-time as the Grace Lutheran Church secretary. Once their children were in school, Linda returned to the workforce as a daycare teacher at the Lanesboro Childcare Center until her retirement.\n\nIn addition to serving as the church secretary for 37 years, Linda was deeply involved in various activities at Grace Lutheran Church. She contributed in many roles, including as a Sunday school teacher, WELCA member, and choir singer. Her beautiful voice often led to requests for her to be a soloist at weddings and funerals.\n\nFamily and gatherings were central to Linda's life. She loved celebrating every milestone, reunion, birthday, and anniversary and played a crucial role in planning them. Linda was an excellent cook, taking pride in preparing multiple dishes for every gathering. Her social nature allowed her to connect with anyone and everyone, making her the unofficial historian of her family.\n\nLinda traveled near and far to attend and support her children's and grandchildren's various activities, including academics, sports, and music. All felt her unwavering encouragement and presence.\n\nLinda is preceded in death by her son, Andrew Kingsbury; her parents, Olive and Oscar Peterson; and numerous cousins, aunts, and uncles.\n\nLinda is survived by her beloved husband, Allan Kingsbury; her children, Teresa (Andrew) Pederson, Chad (Stephanie) Kingsbury, and Allison (Jeff) Miller; her grandchildren, Brennan, Kole, Evan, and Javen; and many cousins, nephews, and a niece.\n\nLinda will be deeply missed and lovingly remembered by all who knew her.\n\nA funeral service will be held on Thursday, July 18, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at Grace Lutheran Church in Peterson, MN. Visitation will take place from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. before the service.\n\nBurial will take place in West Grace Cemetery and pallbearers will be her son, sons-in-law and her grandsons.\n\nHoff Funeral Home of Rushford is assisting Linda's family with arrangements.
