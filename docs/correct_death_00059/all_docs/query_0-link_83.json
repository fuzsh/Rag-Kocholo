        "text": "Description A colour photograph of Mayor Hazel McCallion and musician Oscar Peterson. Photograph has an uneven border around it and is printed on Kodak brand paper. Mayor McCallion is wearing an aqua, blue and maroon-coloured jacket over a tropical print blouse. A pair of glasses is seen hanging around her neck. Mr. Peterson is wearing a multicoloured sweater. The two are standing inside what looks to be a school hallway. History Photograph may have been taken during a visit to Oscar Peterson Public School or at a visit to another local school in the Mississauga community.\n\nOscar Peterson was a world-renowned jazz pianist, composer and educator who worked with such greats as Ella Fitzgerald, Bille Holiday and Louis Armstrong. He was born in Montreal, Quebec and worked all over North America. He moved to the Sheridan area of Mississauga in 1971 until he died in 2007."
