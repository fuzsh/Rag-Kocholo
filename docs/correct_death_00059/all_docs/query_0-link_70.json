        "text": "Free concert to celebrate Oscar Peterson[/b]\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nJanuary 2, 2008 at 8:25 AM EST\n\nTORONTO ??? A free concert will be held at Roy Thomson Hall on Jan. 12 to celebrate the life of Oscar Peterson.\n\nThe legendary jazz pianist died Dec. 23 at the age of 82 at his home in Mississauga, Ont.\n\nThe 90-minute celebration, called ???Oscar Peterson ??? Simply the Best: A Concert Memorial Tribute to a Great Artist,??? will be free to the public.\n\nIt will include performances, memories and film and video highlights of Mr. Peterson's career.\n\nThe guest list will include Governor-General Micha??lle Jean and former Ontario premier, Peterson friend and avid pianist Bob Rae.\n\nA private funeral held for Mr. Peterson on Dec. 29 in Mississauga drew hundreds of relatives and close friends.\n\nNot really, there's also no info yet on how admission is going to work.\n\nIt's not looking good on the special appearances side: The event will be hosted by Valerie Pringle and special guests will include Measha Brueggergosman, Bob Rae and Micha??lle Jean, Governor General of Canada.\n\nCan't the Gov-General just host the whole thing? Those other three are just unbearable."
