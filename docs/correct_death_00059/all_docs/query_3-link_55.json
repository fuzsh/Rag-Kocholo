        "meta_description": "<p>Oscar Peterson  1925 - 2007</p><p> Oscar Peterson was a member of a generation that came of age in the 1950's and defined the public perception of a music that was popular, but no longer part of pop culture. Along with the Modern Jazz Quartet, Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan and Dave Brubeck among others, he represented the collective public face of jazz. These were stars whose appeal took them beyond the dedicated audience. </p><p> For his entire career, Mr. Peterson resolutely made happy, exuberant music. There was an emotional honesty to his inventions, and virtuosity. His improvisations twist and turn, then suddenly burst with long greased lines that seem beyond the reach of most instrumentalists. He attracted attention to his music without making his work seem self-obsessed. </p><p> Along with another pianist, Ahmad Jamal, Mr. Peterson and his group -- Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums -- helped set the sound of the modern piano trio. The individuality of his group was no accident: having absorbed the music of Nat (King) Cole and Art Tatum, two formidable band leaders and pianists, Mr. Peterson was thinking about a group concept. </p><p> The trio was also loose and flexible, and in its ability to change textures and dynamics, it helped write the rules for the sort of interaction now widely taken for granted. \"It is of maximum importance that everybody listen to everybody else while we play,\" Mr. Peterson said once. \"'You have to listen to find how a tune expands or contracts, and each performance has its own pulsation. And a performance needs dynamics, where a tune grows or falls away. You can't perform a tune on one level. Ray Brown once said that I wanted the trio to sound like a trio and also like a big band, and that's true.\" Peter Watrous </p>",
