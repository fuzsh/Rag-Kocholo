        "text": "Oscar Peterson was born in Montreal in 1925 and he is a Canadian jazz pianist and composer. He attended the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. He released over 200 recordings, and his countless awards and honours were Grammy Awards, the International Jazz Hall of Fame Award, Junos, the Order of Canada, the Order of Arts and Letters in France, the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, and received numerous other awards and honours. He performed thousands of times while working more than 60 years and he is considered as one of the greatest jazz pianists. In 1950, Peterson formed a trio (piano, guitar and bass) to the avant-garde of jazz musicians, performing and recording across USA and Europe. He was also a teacher, and wrote four volumes for jazz pianists. His busy schedule slowed down in 1980, and he died in 2007 from suffering a stroke.\n\nOne of his works that I have chosen is Love Ballade in his album called Time After Time. This jazz album is released in 1986 with duration of 45 minutes. Love Ballade has themes of being in love, sweet dreams and dinner ambiance, because the style of the melody is very slow, elegant and warm. This song was created with a profound influence on Canadian music. Love Ballade and other songs from Peterson represent alterity, because they were cultured and performed internationally. His songs were different from other music, because jazz was only created at the end of 19th century.\n\nLove Ballade still belongs to Modernism, because starting from the 1980’s, jazz musicians saw a reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz that had dominated the 1970’s, and they started to create music by rejecting both fusion and free jazz. It means that jazz musicians were still developing and studying the style of music, by expanding and changing until the end of 20th. Peterson composed his own songs from his inspirations, and did not borrow or copied any melodies from other music. He continued to develop the classical western jazz music with his own style. Love Ballade is far away from being subversive, because it is recorded as original jazz style music, and it is not made to protest, or referred by political issues.\n\nDavid Lang is an American composer working in New York. One of the similarities between his works and Peterson’s is that their music is both informed by modernism and classic. When Peterson’s work is pure jazz and classic, David’s music can be in turn comic, abrasive, and soothing, and it usually reflects elements of conceptualism. Some of his works are even rebel, by giving his concert pieces strange and iconoclastic titles such as Eating Living Monkeys and Bonehead. He is described as post-minimalist or totalist."
