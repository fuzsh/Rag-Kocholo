        "text": "About\n\nOscar Peterson was one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time and is particularly known for his dexterity and swing style. During his decades long career, Peterson released over 200 recordings, won 7 Grammy's and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the organization. Peterson began his career in Quebec, playing around Montreal and recording for the Victor label. His career took off in 1949 when producer/promoter Norman Granz heard Peterson play and invited him to perform in a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert at Carnegie Hall. Peterson accompanied well known vocalists Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday as well as playing with greats such as Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie, but he is best known for his work in the trio format. Peterson worked consistently until he suffered a stroke in 1993. He resumed playing in 1995, although he never fully recovered the use of his left hand. Oscar Peterson passed away in 2007 at the age of 82."
