        "text": "Oscar Emmanuel Peterson (1925-2007)‚Äîlovingly nicknamed ‚ÄúOP‚Äù‚Äîis widely recognized as one of the greatest jazz pianists who ever lived. Renowned for his dazzling virtuosity, technical skill and even voice, ‚Äúthe man with four hands‚Äù continues to influence and inspire pianists decades after his death.\n\nBiography\n\nOscar Peterson was born on August 15, 1925 in the humble ‚ÄúLittle Burgundy‚Äù neighborhood of Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada. He was the fourth of five children and his family were Caribbean Canadians with roots in St. Kitts and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nOscar‚Äôs father saw music education as a way out of poverty. He was a self-taught organist and insisted all his children learn the piano and a brass instrument. Oscar‚Äôs first mentor was his older sister Daisy, who later also became a respected musician in the community.\n\nGrowing up, Oscar also fell in love with the trumpet. But a bout of tuberculosis damaged his lungs and ended any career he may have had with the brass instrument.\n\nAt one point, the young Oscar won the attention of manager Norman Gantz, who also managed the career of artists like Ella Fitzgerald. Norman Gantz kickstarted OP‚Äôs career in the United States by having him perform as a ‚Äúguest artist‚Äù at Carnegie Hall in 1949. (OP couldn‚Äôt perform as the main act because he couldn‚Äôt secure a work visa in time.)\n\nAfter that explosive American debut, the rest is history.\n\nAs a musician, I respond to the harmony and rhythm of life, and when I‚Äôm deeply moved it leaves something singing inside me.\n\nOscar Peterson on writing Canadiana Suite (Source: Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame)\n\nInfluences and Style\n\nOP is a staple figure in jazz‚Äôs mid-twentieth century golden age. He rubbed shoulders with other greats like Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, while dazzling audiences with the Oscar Peterson Trio.\n\nWhat made OP so beloved? His technical prowess stunned audiences, for sure, but as with all successful artists, his style wasn‚Äôt without criticism.\n\nPerfectionist\n\nAt 17, Oscar wanted to drop out of school to pursue music. His father, a strict disciplinarian‚Äîwho was, according to Oscar, ‚Äúmore than firm‚Äù‚Äîwasn‚Äôt pleased. Still, he ultimately said yes under the condition that Oscar not only become a successful jazz pianist, but the greatest jazz pianist.\n\nThis attitude towards perfectionism would follow Oscar for the rest of his career. He challenged the musicians he played with and his own style is marked by its technical precision. His first trio, with Herb Ellis and Ray Brown, was intended to sound as one artist rather than an ensemble of three. This demanded the band be tight.\n\nTechnical Virtuosity\n\nConversely, Oscar‚Äôs reputation for speed also earned him a fair share of critics. Some critics find that his playing, while impressive in performance, lacked emotion and artistic originality.\n\n‚ùìüéπ DID YOU KNOW? OP had a stroke while playing live, and he still managed to finish the concert! Now that‚Äôs dedication.\n\nStyle Synthesizer\n\nUtter dedication, every time you play. And if that is scary, it is also uniquely exciting: Once it‚Äôs bitten you, you never get rid of it.‚Äù\n\nOscar Peterson on improvising in front of a large audience (Source: Sistema Toronto)\n\nKey Works\n\nIn 1962, OP composed ‚ÄúHymn to Freedom.‚Äù Inspired by the spirituals he grew up hearing in the Montr√©al Black community, it became an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement. With lyrics by Harriette Hamilton, this song would later be inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nLegacy\n\n‚ÄúYou have to almost be cold,‚Äù he says of the loneliness he experiences on tour. ‚ÄúYou have to try and put it aside . . . because it can block your improvisational ideas.‚Äù\n\nOscar also struggled with his health. He suffered from arthritis from a young age, and in 1993, experienced a stroke during a performance. This would create a lasting impact on the left side of his body, affecting his playing.\n\nYet despite these personal setbacks, OP played music until his death in 2007 at the age of 82.\n\nOn Music Education\n\nAt one point, Oscar operated the Advanced School of Contemporary Music, but the school closed after three years because Oscar‚Äôs performing schedule was too demanding. OP would contribute to musical education in other ways with academic posts such as becoming a professor and then a chancellor at York University. He also wrote four volumes of jazz instruction, Jazz Exercises and Pieces for the Young Jazz Pianist.\n\nWhether through his recordings, writings, or interviews, OP‚Äôs tenacity, virtuosity, and creativity continue to inspire pianists everywhere.\n\n*Note: This article contains affiliate links, which means we might earn a small commission from the product seller if you make a purchase.
