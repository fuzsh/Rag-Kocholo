        "text": "Oscar Peterson, whose flying fingers, hard-driving swing and melodic improvisations made him one of the world's best known and influential jazz pianists, has died. He was 82.\n\nPeterson died at his home in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga on Sunday, according to Oliver Jones, a family friend and fellow jazz musician. He said Peterson's wife and daughter were with him during his final moments. Mississauga's mayor, Hazel McCallion, who described Peterson as a \"very close friend\", said that the cause of death was kidney failure. His health was thought to have deteriorated markedly over recent months.\n\nDuring an illustrious career spanning seven decades, Peterson played with some of the biggest names in jazz, from Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. He is also remembered for the trio he led with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis in the 1950s.\n\nPeterson's impressive collection of awards included seven Grammys and a Grammy for lifetime achievement in 1997, as well as his country's highest civilian honour, the Order of Canada. \"I've always thought of him as Canada's national treasure. All of Canada mourns for him and his family,\" said Jones. \"He had 60 full years of being considered the top jazz pianist in the world.\"\n\nPeterson's stature was reflected in the admiration of his peers. Duke Ellington referred to him as the \"Maharajah of the keyboard,\" while Count Basie said, succinctly, that Peterson \"plays the best ivory box I've ever heard.\" Herbie Hancock, another legendary jazz pianist, regarded Peterson's impact on the genre as profound. \"Oscar Peterson redefined swing for modern jazz pianists for the latter half of the 20th century up until today,\" he said. \"I consider him the major influence that formed my roots in jazz piano playing. He mastered the balance between technique, hard blues grooving, and tenderness. ... No one will ever be able to take his place.\"\n\nPeterson's death also brought tributes from notable figures outside the jazz world. The Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper called Peterson a \"technical and creative master\" who \"was not simply a giant in Canadian music, but a giant in music period.\" In a statement, the French president Nicolas Sarkozy said that \"one of the bright lights of jazz has gone out.\"\n\nPeterson was often invited to perform for heads of state, including Queen Elizabeth and US president Richard Nixon. He was also responsible for composing A Royal Wedding Suite for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.\n\nBorn on August 15, 1925, in a poor neighborhood of Montreal, Peterson inherited his passion for music from his father, Daniel Peterson, a railway porter and self-taught pianist. Aged five, Oscar learned to play trumpet and piano but, after a bout of tuberculosis, chose to concentrate on the keyboards. He studied with Hungarian-born classical pianist Paul de Marky, who helped develop his technique, and went on to become a teen sensation in Canada, playing in dance bands and recording in the late 1930s and 1940s.\n\nHe quickly made a name for himself as a jazz virtuoso, earning comparisons to jazz piano great Art Tatum, his childhood idol, for his speed and technical skill. He was also influenced by Nat King Cole, whose piano trio recordings he considered \"a complete musical thesaurus for any aspiring jazz pianist.\"\n\nJazz pianist Marian McPartland, who called Peterson \"the finest technician I have seen,\" recalled first meeting Peterson when she and her husband, jazz cornetist Jimmy McPartland, opened for him at the Colonial Tavern in Toronto in the 1940s. \"From that point on, we became such good friends - he was always wonderful to me and I have always felt very close to him,\" she said. \"I played at his tribute concert at Carnegie Hall earlier this year and performed 'Tenderly,' which was always my favorite piece of his.\"\n\nAmerican jazz impresario Norman Granz was so impressed after hearing Peterson at a Montreal club that he invited the pianist to come to New York for a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert at Carnegie Hall in 1949 that launched his international career. Peterson was brought up from the audience as a surprise guest to play a duet with bassist Brown, overwhelming everyone with his dazzling technique and mastery of different jazz styles from boogie woogie to bebop.\n\nPeterson would often release four or five albums a year and became a mainstay at jazz festivals around the world, but he never stopped calling Canada home. Probably his best known major composition is the 1964 Canadiana Suite, with jazz themes inspired by the cities and regions of his native country. In 2005 he became the first living person other than a reigning monarch to be honored with a commemorative stamp in Canada, where streets, squares, concert halls and schools have been named after him.\n\nPeterson suffered a stroke in 1993 that weakened his left hand. But after a two-year recuperation, he gradually resumed performances, and made a series of recordings for the US Telarc label. He kept playing despite worsening arthritis and mobility problems, saying in a 2001 interview that \"the love I have of the instrument and my group and the medium itself works as a sort of a rejuvenating factor for me.\"\n\nPeterson's survivors include his fourth wife, Kelly, their daughter, Celine, and six children from his previous marriages."
