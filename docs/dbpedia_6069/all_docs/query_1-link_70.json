        "text": "Put in charge of pageants, Leonardo masterminded elaborate court celebrations, magnificent spectacular extravaganzas with special effects. One celebrated the baptism of the King’s son, the Dauphin François, one commemorated the King’s victory at the Battle of Marignano and another, at Clos Lucé, was created to thank François for his kindness and generosity. He was also probably behind the astonishing elaborate mock battle held in Amboise town in April 1518. Six hundred men led by François defended a model town against six hundred men led by the duke of Bourbon. It was so like real warfare that some participants were killed.\n\nFrancois did not get his money’s worth from Leonardo the painter whose days of glory in that particular medium were over. He did his last painting five years before he arrived in Amboise. If the King, who owned a tapestry copy of The Last Supper, hoped Leonardo would produce another Last Supper he was sorely disappointed.\n\nHe did however run an art school. François, who paid the salaries of a small army of artists, urged his Court painters to study under Leonardo. Leonardo knew one artist, Jean Perréal, very well. When Perréal and Leonardo lived in Italy, he showed Leonardo his chalk drawings. Chalks were unknown in Italy.\n\nPerréal, who was working in Amboise when Leonardo arrived, headed a stable of Court Painters. He was with the Royal Household until he retired in 1528. Perréal aka Jean de Paris was the same age as Leonardo. Extremely talented, highly respected, he painted portraits of Charles VIII, his wife Anne of Brittany and a portrait of Anne’s second husband, Louis XII. He sent his star pupil, Jean Clouet, to Leonardo’s studio in Château Clos Lucé to learn from him.\n\nLeonardo learned the French technique of ‘dry painting’ with coloured chalks on coloured paper from Jean Perréal. Now, Leonardo taught Jean Clouet the Italian technique of using parallel diagonal strokes and cross hatching to define light and shadow. Faces were built up by producing darker planes to give structure to the nose and cheek bones to suggest a third dimension and illusion of depth. Before Clouet, French portraits were two dimensional, artists drew an outline then filled it in. This was the reverse, modelling from the face outwards. Clouet was the first artist in France to use Leonardo’s technique of building up volume within the face.\n\nWhen he joined the Royal Household, Clouet’s wages were the same as stable boys. The admiration François had for Leonardo raised the status of artists in France. By the time Clouet retired he drew the same salary as the head surgeon.\n\nBy calling, Leonardo was more of an inventor, an engineer and architect than he was a painter. At least on paper. Knowing this, François asked him to design a new town from scratch. The king so loved the Loire Valley, he decided he would move the capital of France from Paris to his mother’s home town, Romorantin."
