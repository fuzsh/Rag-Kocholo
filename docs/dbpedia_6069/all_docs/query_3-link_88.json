        "text": "Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, and died over 500 years ago on May 2, 1519.\n\nHe is still widely known as a paragon of the Italian Renaissance, a polymath whose areas of expertise included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography.\n\nLeonardo is renowned primarily as a painter. Perhaps only fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works made a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo. His picture “Mona Lisa” is “the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world,” according to the U.K. Independent.\n\n“The Last Supper” is the most reproduced religious painting of all time. His drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts.\n\nLeonardo is also revered for his technological ingenuity. He thought up flying machines, armored fighting vehicles, solar power, the parachute, and even a type of machine gun. He also made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, geology, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.\n\nRecently, doctors from the Optometry and Vision Sciences School at City University of London diagnosed da Vinci with strabismus after analyzing the eye alignment of works believed to have been modeled, in part, on himself. Visual neuroscientist Professor Christopher Tyler said the disorder “would have been particularly useful for getting [scenes] geometrically correct.”\n\nOn May 2, 2019, Italy honored the day, 500 years ago, when Leonardo da Vinci died.\n\nAccording to “i-Italy” (“all things Italian in America):\n\nOne of the main events of the 500th anniversary of his death begins this October at the Uffizi Galleries of Florence, with the exhibition ‘The Leicester Codex of Leonardo da Vinci: Water as Microscope of Nature.’ The 72-page Codex, which discusses the movement of water, fossils, and moonlight (among other topics) is being loaned by Bill Gates, who purchased it in 1990 for over $30 million.”"
