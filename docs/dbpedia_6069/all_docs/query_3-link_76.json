Numerous events about the anniversary of his death are getting planned, to pay tribute to this timeless genius who has been living in Italy and spent his last years in France…\n\nEvents in the places that have marked his life\n\nExhibition at the Louvre Museum\n\nThe teams of the Louvre Museum needed 10 years of work to bring together the “Leonardo da Vinci” exhibition, which will be presented for the 500th anniversary of his death. The exhibition, which is certainly the most eagerly-awaited of 2019, will be displayed at the Grand Hall Napoleon from October 24th, 2019 to February 24th, 2020. The Louvre Museum already possesses five original artworks by Leonardo Da Vinci, including the famous Mona Lisa. For the 500th anniversary of the master’s death, the museum wishes to bring to Paris several other original paintings by the artist, such as Salvator Mundi, considered one of the most expensive artworks in the world, that was sold 382 million euros in 2017.\n\nThis exhibition promises a journey through the artist’s life and his numerous masterpieces, whose meaning is often enigmatic.\n\nWhen: from October 24th, 2019 to February 24th, 2020\n\nWhere: Louvre Museum\n\nFor more information: Louvre Exhibitions\n\nEvent at Clos Lucé\n\nThe celebration of the 500th anniversary of Leonardo Da Vinci’s death will also take place at Clos Lucé, his final resting place. Indeed, in 1516, King Francis I appointed Leonardo Da Vinci “First Painter, Engineer and Architect of the King” and invited him to the Château du Clos Lucé. Three years later, on May 2nd, 1519, the artist passed away in his bedroom, after having received his will and having set his funeral preparations. He left behind an exceptional legacy. The city of Amboise is a place that meant a lot to the artist. The exhibition in tribute to him includes more than 500 events to honor the 500th anniversary of his death. French TV host Stéphane Bern is also an ambassador for the event called “500 years of Renaissance”. Many exhibitions will take place, such as “1519, Leonardo Da Vinci’s death: the construction of a myth” at the Royal castle or “Leonardo Da Vinci’s Last Supper for Francis I, a silk and silver masterpiece” at the Château Clos Lucé, with the original artwork exhibited for the occasion. In Fall 2019, the master’s final resting home will also open two new areas dedicated to his works: the painter Leonardo Da Vinci with visit and show telling about his works and the architect Leonardo Da Vinci with augmented reality animations on his works.\n\nAttend the “1519, Leonardo Da Vinci’s death: the construction of a myth“ exhibition:\n\nWhen: From Thursday May 2nd, 2019 to Saturday August 31st, 2019\n\nWhere: Royal castle of Amboise\n\nAttend the “Leonardo Da Vinci’s Last Supper for Francis I, a silk and silver masterpiece” exhibition:\n\nWhen: From June 6th, 2019 to September 8th, 2019\n\nWhere: Clos Lucé\n\nEvents and tributes in Italy\n\nOf course, Italy, his home country, will also pay tribute to the artist. Italy organizes many events and exhibitions to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Leonardo Da Vinci’s death. The city of Florence has already started paying its tribute at the end of 2018, displaying the famous Codex Leicester in the Uffizi Gallery. This manuscript belonged to Leonardo Da Vinci himself and the American Bill Gates bought it in 1994. There is currently a competition between Italy and France about this commemoration: indeed, the two countries are fighting for the loan of Leonardo Da Vinci’s works for exhibitions in May 2019.\n\n500 years after his death, Leonardo Da Vinci is still hitting the headlines. Fans of the artist, admirers of this genius scientist, 2019 will be devoted to the Vitruvian Man!"
