        "text": "Prodigious Genius:\n\nHow smart was he?\n\nAfter over 8 years of re-searching Leonardo I've found it really difficult to label him appropriately. The closest I could come was to simply call him a \"Genius\" but he was in a league of his own. The only people who seem to rival him are people called \"Prodigious savants\" - but that also didn't quite fit him. He didn't seem to be a savant.\n\n\"A prodigious savant is someone with a skill level equivalent to or greater than that of a prodigy, regardless of any cognitive disability. The most common trait of prodigious savants is their seemingly limitless mnemonic skills, with many having eidetic or photographic memories. Prodigious savants are extremely rare, with fewer than one hundred noted in more than a century of literature on the subject. Treffert estimates that fewer than fifty or so such individuals are alive today.\"\n\nHe didn't seem to have an eidetic memory and even mentions in his notebooks that there are too many things to remember so you should write them down and sketch what you see when you see it so you don't forget. While I do think that he had a form of mild autism that accounts for his eccentric behavior and both obsessive focus and concurrent inability to finish anything he didn't display any savantish abilities.\n\nSo in my quest to slap a label on his amazing mind I decided that he was worthy of a new title: I'm calling it a Prodigious Genius.\n\nWhat is a Prodigious Genius and how is it different from a \"normal\" genius? Well I would say that a Prodigious genius is well versed in many subjects. The closest other term would be a \"Polymath\" which is has become almost synonymous with a \"Renaissance Man\":\n\n\" Is a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. In less formal terms, a polymath (or polymathic person) may simply be someone who is very knowledgeable. Most ancient scientists were polymaths by today's standards. The term was first used in the seventeenth century but the related term, polyhistor, is an ancient term with similar meaning.\"\n\nWhile a polymath is someone who knows a lot about a lot of things, a Prodigious Genius is someone who contributes something new and original or revolutionary to many different fields. Anyone could potentially learn what others have already taught - and memorize it. A prodigious Genius might not even know about those fields, there may not even be those subjects to study - they create them.\n\nThe main thing that separates a Prodigious Genius from other geniuses is their creativity and imagination. They don't just think outside of the box - they turn boxes into spheres.\n\nThere have probably been quite a few potential prodigious geniuses throughout history - the problem is that even fewer get the chance to reach this potential. With most of the world being illiterate and uneducated and having no access to any knowledge outside of family stories - it's only been a very select few that were given the opportunity and had the innate mental capacity to achieve such intellectual heights. Even if someone had - we would never know about them unless they left something behind for us to find.\n\nSo who else could be considered in these elite ranks? Einstein? Shakespeare? The Pyramid Designers? Steve Jobs? No, not even Einstein. A prodigious Genius is someone who is universally creative and revolutionary and isn't specific to only one field, or even a couple subjects. They are people who are capable of revolutionary ideas in almost everything they attempt. Einstein was in-arguably a genius, but his focus and range was limited to mostly physics. Leonardo's focus was such that he could focus on one subject - take it to its greatest heights - and then focus on the next thing and do the same- and repeat this for dozens of fields - even physics.\n\nThe only other person I've come across that comes close to rivaling Leonardo da Vinci is Nikola Tesla.\n\nWhy did Leonardo write in Mirrored Script?\n\nLeonardo wrote mirrored - from right to left. Why? Some people think he did this to hide or \"encode\" his writing but since he had been doing it in his youth - (before he would have been writing anything secretive) - it's most likely that he was left handed and without anyone telling him how he \"should\" write he naturally wrote from right to left as is natural for someone left handed. This is where his lack of a formal education came in handy, he wasn't forced to write with his \"right\" hand.\n\nPut out both of your hands as if you are holding a pencil in each hand in front of you.\n\nNow pretend you are writing your name in cursive in the air with your dominant hand. Then try it with your opposite hand. Now try doing it with both hands at the same time. One of your hands gets confused - right? Now put both hands out in front of you again and try the same thing but this time make each hand mirror each other so that your right hand is going from left to right and your left hand is going from left to right - and they are both making the same moments. See how much easier that is? That's why Leonardo wrote \"mirrored\" he was writing how someone left handed would naturally and no one \"corrected\" him and told him to write right. Another thing you can do to see what I mean is to hold out both your right arm and right leg. Move them both at the same time in clockwise circles. Now try to reverse your arm to make counter clockwise circles.\n\nHeight: 6'4\" (Read this somewhere not sure how they know)\n\nHe was obsessed with mirrors and painted more portraits than anything else (that we know of) so it's been sort of a mystery as to what he really looked like. Why aren't there more, if any, obvious portraits of himself?\n\nAlmost every artist, especially painters, and even more so - painters who paint portraits - paint themselves a lot. If you have the urge to start painting, and there is no one around - you are always there. I know personally that I have more pictures of myself than anything else. Why? Cause i'm there, all the time.\n\nI would imagine that Leonardo painted, or at least sketched himself, a lot. I would go so far as to say he was one of his own greatest subjects. Getting people to stay still for long amounts of time is very difficult. But when you are looking in a mirror, and painting, you have a subject that will pose for you for as long as you can paint. I would think that in the same way that I taught myself to take portraits, by taking self portraits, da Vinci used his own reflection to do the same.\n\nThe logic is sound, but the evidence is evidently lacking. There is really only one sketch that is considered to be a self portrait, and that was in 1516-ish when he was already old.\n\nIt could very well be that he knew by only leaving behind enigmatic and mysterious images of himself that it would only add to his mystique. Similar to how someone fantasizes about what their 'blind date' would look like - being able to imagining them out to be whatever you want.\n\nAnother potential reason could be that he wasn't able to represent himself in a way that he felt comfortable with. Today people have a similar dilemma when picking out their default picture on social media sites. If you only have a single image that emblematizes yourself - a clever solution would be to not post a picture of yourself at all and let people judge you by your work and not your image, like leaving a book's cover blank.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's Family Tree\n\nLeonardo had 17 half brothers and sisters. 12 from his father and 5 from his mother.\n\nSer Guido di Ser Michelo da Vinci (Leonardo's Great - Grandfather)\n\nHad three sons:\n\nGiovanni (Notary)\n\nPiero (Notary)\n\nAntonio (Leonardo's Grandfather) - (Farmer)\n\nAntonio married Lucia (Leo's Grandma born 1393) who was the daughter of a Notary.\n\nAlthough the family tradition/ trade was to be a Notary Leonardo's grandfather Antonio and his uncle Francesco decided to be farmers instead.\n\nAntonio and Lucia had: (Leo's Grandpa and Grandma)\n\nPiero - 1427 - Leonardo's Father\n\nFrancesco - 1435 - Leonardo's Uncle (Farmer)\n\nViolante - Unknown\n\nSer Piero\n\nLeonardo's father was 25 years old when Fathered Leo and died in 1504.
