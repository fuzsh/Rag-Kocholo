        "text": "Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519) is a character affiliated with S.E.A..\n\nHistory[]\n\nReal-World History[]\n\nLeonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was a 15th/16th century Italian painter, inventor, architect, sculptor, scientist, anatomist, and engineer. He is probably best known for portraits like the Mona Lisa or the Last Supper and for his illustrations which were centuries ahead of the time in regards of studying the human body and creating mechanical devices, or for the controversy he held with the Catholic Church due to his studies of science challenging their religious beliefs and for Da Vinci's bisexuality. Leonardo died at the chateaux Clos Lucé on the 2 May of 1519 at the age of 67, it is believed that he died of a stroke.\n\nDisney Parks Mythos[]\n\nMuch of Leonardo da Vinci's life was presumably the same as it was in real life. In 1500 he would acquire the Shepherd's Journal from a sailor named Amerigo Vespucci, a book detailing information of the lost nation Atlantis. Da Vinci would be the first man in hundreds of years to decipher the Atlantean language and the details of Atlantean flying-machines would inspire him to begin designing those of his own.\n\nWhile highly innovative, Leonardo's gliders were not able to truly achieve flight. Following Da Vinci's demise in 1519, tributes to him would be acquired by the recently formed Society of Explorers and Adventurers with the artifacts being put on display in their headquarters of Fortress Explorations in Porto Paradiso, Italy. As tribute to the genius, the S.E.A. would declare Leonardo as being an honorary member of the society and his ghost would come to haunt the fortress.\n\nIn 1807, Da Vinci's Flying Machines would be put on display in Porto Paradiso's Museum of Fantastic Flight by Cellino Falco. When the museum passed to the ownership of his daughter Camellia, she would use his flying-machines as the basis for her own, more functional Dream Flyer gliders.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nWorld of Motion[]\n\nDa Vinci used to appear in the EPCOT attraction World of Motion where he was portrayed by an audio-animatronic. He could be seen in his study, painting the Mona Lisa while another man in his workshop tried to use his flying-machine to glide.\n\nThe Timekeeper[]\n\nLeonardo appeared in this attraction, painting the Mona Lisa. He was observed by guests from the time-traveling robot camera Nine-Eyes who worked for the robotic Timekeeper in Tomorrowland's Metropolis Science Center or Discoveryland's Visionarium depending on the park.\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire[]\n\nIn the lore of this film, Leonardo Da Vinci was a previous owner of the Shepherd's Journal who deciphered and documented the Atlantean language. This is how Milo Thatch was able to be fluent in Atlantean centuries later.\n\nFortress Explorations[]\n\nA portrait of Leonardo Da Vinci is framed in Fortress Explorations. He is also the namesake for an exploration game called the Leonardo Challenge. His artwork and documents highly influenced the aesthetics and technology of the attraction with his ghost being a character.\n\nSoaring: Fantastic Flight[]\n\nDa Vinci's likeness is found throughout the queue of this attraction. The ride vehicles are modelled after Da Vinci's own flying machines.\n\nConnections[]\n\nFantasyland[]\n\nIn Disneyland Paris' Merlin l'Enchanteur shop is a flying machine of Da Vinci's in the possession of Merlin.\n\nJourney Into Imagination[]\n\nA portrait depicting Figment as the Mona Lisa appears in Journey Into Your Imagination with Figment.[1]"
