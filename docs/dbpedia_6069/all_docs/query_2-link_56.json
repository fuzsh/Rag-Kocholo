        "text": "Leonardo da Vinci is known to most people as merely being the author of the most famous painting in the world. To anybody who’s got any appreciation for art and culture, that might sound like a significant enough accomplishment. And yet, in Leonardo’s case, that limiting title isn’t nearly enough to even begin to cover who he was and the steps he single-handedly took in the development of humanity as a species.\n\nWe’ve all seen Leonardo’s Monna Lisa (yes, Monna, and not “Mona” as I see it frequently spelled by English speakers; it is an abbreviation of Madonna, “Lady”), and many of us don’t think that particular picture is worthy of its global popularity. But you know what? Leonardo would agree with us.\n\nIf Leonardo could describe himself to us today, the noun of “painter” or “artist” probably wouldn’t even cross his mind. He probably would call himself a man of talents, an inventor. He was a poliedric genius, a self-taught scientist and engineer, versed and skilled in as many sciences as his time could count. Leonardo died exactly 500 years ago today, on May 2, 1519, and he invented prototypes and designed machines that humans haven’t been able to build yet.\n\nSo why is his fame limited for the most part to his most insignificant piece, La Gioconda? Even as a painter he produced works of art that were by far superior. Just bask in the viewing pleasure of the enigmatic Virgin of the Rocks or of the quasi-modern slight sternness of La Belle Ferronniere or most of his lesser-known paintings. Even his practicing and mysterious sketches are breathtaking. Leonardo’s art contains so many secrets that mankind will never fully uncover.\n\nThere are plenty of things that most people don’t know about Leonardo Da Vinci. I remember being told as a child by my teachers, to have read in books and to have heard in museums that he was in love with the woman portrayed in La Gioconda. It was only when I conducted my own deeper research that I found out he was actually homosexual, and proudly so, in a time and place where he could’ve very well be sentenced to death for sodomy because of it. The woman depicted as the Gioconda might very well just depict Leonardo’s pupil and lover, Salai. In fact, other paintings and sketches depicting Salai found in Leonardo’s notebook look suspiciously familiar to the Monna Lisa, who indeed does not have the most feminine features but sports a very ambiguous and mysterious smile.\n\nLeonardo’s peers described him as flamboyant. Further proof of his homosexuality is more tangible: he never married or had any children, which was a telling sign for the time; his sketchbooks are filled with doodles of erect penises; he is known to have had relationships with many of his students (women were not allowed to study in botteghe, so you can do the math), and he was actually sued for sodomy, the equivalent of homosexuality at the time, at least twice, but the (homosexual) affair was quickly covered up because the son of a noble and powerful family was involved.\n\nSimply put, history being compulsively heteronormative, couldn’t bear to remember one of the brightest minds in the world as gay. But times have changed and it’s only fair that we praise Leonardo for all he really did for mankind.\n\nMonna Lisa who? Leonardo was a true pioneer in the study of so many sciences. He is considered the founding father of paleonthology as he figured out the true nature of fossils. In botanic, he noticed that leaves aren’t placed casually, but they follow certain mathematic laws; he also understood that the concentric rings on a tree’s trunk indicate the tree’s age. In astronomy, he had many intuitions about the nature of planets and stars, he theorized heliocentrism before Copernicus and Galilei, and compared the planets to magnets long before the concept of gravity was introduced by Isaac Newton a century and a half later.\n\nLeonardo was positively obsessed with anatomy. He was a great connoisseur of the human body and would often study corpses, as his many sketches prove. He left beautiful and accurate drawings of muscles and bones. He also specifically studied the human eye and discovered the existance of the retina and the optical nerve. He was also a mathematician, an expert in music, a sculptor, you name it.\n\nHaving a far superior understanding of many phenomena of physics than any other person at the time made Leonardo a great architect and engineer. In his sketches, there are designs of bridges, domes, streets, towers and buildings. He also projected the construction of canals, dams and drainage systems. (One time he even made the utopistic project to deviate the course of the Arno River to cut the rival city of Pisa from Florence and any aid coming from neighbouring cities. That project certainly didn’t end well.)\n\nHis prototypes long predated the patent of many inventions — and by that, I mean by centuries. Among his inventions were the bicycle, the life vest, the use of solar energy, and multiple weapons and war machines like the giant crossbow and the tank. Leonardo also created the first automaton, the ancestor of modern day robots: a mechanical knight that could walk on its own and move its arms, designed around 1495 to dramatically shock and entertain the lord of Milan and his guests at parties.\n\nBut Leonardo’s true dream, one could say, was flight. Throughout his life, the inventor held the firm belief that man would one day fly. For years, he observed birds and other winged creatures, hoping he could “steal the secret of flight” from them. He designed and created many models and prototypes of flying machines. Among them were the hang-glider, the parachute, and even a small helicopter. It sounds crazy, right? Imagine what this man could accomplish if he had modern technology at his disposal.\n\nThis incredible man possessed an anxiety-driven desire of knowledge. What can be gathered from his messy journals is that he needed to understand phenomena, the hows and whys of nature. He wasn’t just curious. This led him to meticulously experimenting in most fields and to make the discoveries and inventions that we don’t know to give him credit for.\n\nNot possessing a title or an estate, he moved from city to city across Italy (which would not be a unified country for three more centuries and was then made-up of many smaller states) and lastly to France, where he passed away on May 2, 2019 in the castle of Ambois, which is why the French still claim Leonardo’s nationality (and why they kept the Gioconda). That is beyond the point. Leonardo did not belong to a single city or country. He was a cosmopolitan ante litteram, one of the first real Italian Renaissance artists, moving freely where his talents were most required (or better remunerated) so that he could observe more, experiment more learn more.\n\nA true trailblazer in too many areas to count, Leonardo was a multifaceted genius. He is to this day considered to be one of the most intelligent persons to ever exist in history, so don’t feel stupid for not having invented your own flying robot yet. We all feel humbled and belittled by his talents.\n\nIt’s about time History quit remembering Leonardo da Vinci as this nerdy guy who was simply in love with a lady in an average-looking painting. It’s a shame to his memory."
