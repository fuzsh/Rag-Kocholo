        "text": "The legendary Leonardo Da Vinci had many talents and mastered many fields: art, science, engineer, philosophy and architecture. His incredible work affected all the generations that followed. As an architect, Leonardo Da Vinci left behind many marvelous sites and inventions in the Loire Valley. One of its most remarkable pieces in the Loire Valley is in the Chateau de Chambord: the double helix staircase, an architectural prowess.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was a visionary, making blue prints for advance engineering (such as the automobile or helicopter). His scientific and philosophical works show the infinite creativity of his brilliant mind. However, Da Vinci could also be simpler, asking practical question of everyday life which were still unanswered.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci was born on April 15th, 1452 in Florence. His father was a notary and art lover. During his childhood, he spent time with him in the academic library and started painting lessons. Later on, Da Vinci used science to improve his art.\n\nIn 1516, Leonardo Da Vinci arrived in the Loire Valley under the protection of the King of France, Francois the 1st. He was given the Manoir du Clos Lucé in Amboise, where he could practice his art at ease and free from specific orders. Cherishing the Italian Renaissance, Francois the 1st promoted Leonardo Da Vinci to be its architect, painter and engineer…he also called him “my father”. Da Vinci died in May 2nd, 1519 and is now resting the Chateau d’Amboise in the Saint Hubert chapel.\n\nApril month is a great time to visit the Loire Valley, find out what to do in France in April.\n\nWe want to thank you and Guillaume for a wonderful itinerary and such amazing personalized attention. Every touch was added with so much special care and your willingness to answer all of my questions in such detail ahead of time was truly amazing.\n\nThe guidebook and ‘care package’ you sent was so exciting and really helped us a lot with every day and deciding what to do next. All of the activities and properties you recommended were spot-on and it made our trip just perfect.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for arranging such a great itinerary and for your amazing service. We hope to come back soon and will definitely recommend France Just For You to all of our friends!\n\nI was amazed when I came across the website that ALL the reviews were excellent. From the moment I started dealing with Emilie I received amazing service in planning our wonderful trip to France.\n\nI will not repeat all the details that are in the previous posts but highlight some of the exceptional service that I received.\n\nThe booking of the excellent tickets for Roland Garros will remain a highlight forever. The phone with unlimited data, her tour guide downloaded, waze and google maps, her phone numbers and emergency numbers, tourist information was invaluable.\n\nThe choice of accommodation was unique. She is sorting out a dispute with the car hire company - and apologised on their behalf.\n\nHer tips on additional site seeing enhanced our experience.\n\nOur personalized guide book will remain a treasured memoire of our trip.\n\nI could go on and on - so don't hesitate and look no further in planning a trip to France. We loved our visit so much that we will be planning another visit to a different region in the near future."
