        "text": "Almost nothing is known about Leonardo's mother Caterina. The only certainty is that her name was Caterina and that she was married to an Accattabriga the Piero del Vaccha from Vinci. This can be seen in the tax return of Leonardo's grandfather, which he made in 1457. There it lists those living with him: \"[and] Lionardo, illegitimate son of the aforementioned Ser Piero and Caterina, who is now married to Achattabriga di Piero del Vaccha from Vinci.\" There are two main theories about the origin of Caterina. The majority of researchers now believe that Caterina was a peasant girl from Vinci.\n\nTheory I: The peasant girl Caterina\n\nIn the tax returns from that time it appears that there was only one Caterina in the area around Vinci. This Caterina (*1427) married in 1457 one Antonio Buti di Piero del Vaccha, called Accattabriga. The Buti family managed their own farm in Campo Zeppi, about 45min walk from Vinci.\n\nAccattabriga also worked as a lime burner. The family owned their own land, but over time had to sell more and more of it. Accattabriga's environment was characterized by financial difficulties. It is therefore conceivable that his marriage to Caterina was arranged by the Vincis, who also offered him financial incentives. In this way, the Vincis knew they would be taken care of and avoided gossip in the rural area. That there were contacts between Accattabriga and the Vincis is documented several times. For many years Leonardo's father and brother were witnesses to Accattabriga's land sales and he was a witness to the Vinci's land purchases.\n\nAccattabriga died in 1490 at the age of about 60. His marriage to Caterina produced four daughters and one son. These five children would therefore be Leonardo's maternal half-siblings:\n\nPiera (c. *1454)\n\nMaria (*1457)\n\nLisabetta (*1459)\n\nFrancesco (*1461)\n\nSandra (*1463)\n\nTheory II: The slave Chaterina\n\nAnother theory says that the Caterina from the tax return of 1457 was an oriental slave. Leonardo would have consequently also Arab roots. The supporters of this theory argue that the Caterina from Vinci was one year older than Leonardo's father Ser Piero. However, since Ser Piero preferred much younger women, he could not possibly have desired the then 25-year-old Caterina from Vinci.\n\nLeonardo's father Ser Piero was well acquainted with Ser Vanni, a rich notary in Florence. In his house there was an oriental slave girl, Chaterina. Slaves were uncommon in Florence of that time, but nevertheless they existed here and there. When Ser Vanni died unexpectedly in 1451, a year before Leonardo was born, he bequeathed the slave Chaterina to his wife, Agnola. Ser Piero was appointed executor of the will and therefore often stayed at the Vanni house, may even have lived there temporarily. Therefore, some suggest that he could have impregnated this Chaterina and brought the child Leonardo to the farm in Vinci. After that he would have taken care of her freedom, and married her to Antonio Buti. What is certain is that Chaterina was no longer listed as a member of Ser Vanni's widow Agnola's household in the first tax return filed after Ser Vanni's death, but not until 8 years later.\n\nThis theory, however, is highly controversial and has few supporters. Against it speaks that there was already before 1451 thus the year when there was still a slave Chaterina in Florence, already a Caterina in the area of Vinci. The slave Chaterina and the peasant girl Caterina must therefore be two different persons.\n\nIn this context it is nevertheless interesting that Leonardo later applied for a position at the court of the Ottoman sultan, which representatives of the Arabic descent theory see as an attempt to return to his roots. But it could also have been just an attempt to realize a monumental building project. Leonardo planned to build a bridge across the Bosporus to connect Europe and the Near East by land.\n\nLeonardo's Writing Style\n\nFurthermore, Leonardo's unusual writing style is cited as evidence of an Arabic origin. Leonardo predominantly wrote from right to left, in a mirrored fashion. Arabic script is also written from right to left. Could Leonardo have learned this way of writing from an Arabic mother who worked as an educated slave for a Florentine notary? While this is possible, it is more likely that Leonardo developed this unique writing style because he was left-handed. If he had written from left to right with his left hand, his hand would have smudged the still-wet ink and made the just-written text illegible.\n\nLeonardo's Bridge for the Sultan\n\nIn connection with Leonardo's assumed Arabic roots, it is noteworthy that in 1503, he offered his services as an engineer to the Ottoman Sultan in a letter. The letter is now housed in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul. Leonardo wanted to construct the longest bridge in the world at the time. It was intended to connect Constantinople (now Istanbul), which had been captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1453, with the northern neighborhoods situated on the other side of the Golden Horn. The Golden Horn is a roughly 250-meter wide estuary in Istanbul. Representatives of the theory of Arabic descent see this letter as an attempt by Leonardo to reconnect with his roots. However, it could also have simply been an attempt to undertake a monumental construction project. There is no record of the Sultan's response, and Leonardo, according to historical sources, never visited Istanbul.\n\nLeonardo's relationship to his mother\n\nThe few historical sources from Leonardo's childhood show that Leonardo grew up in his father's family. Nevertheless, it is considered likely that he was in contact with his mother, although there is no evidence for this. Because of the local proximity, he was probably able to visit her often and was probably connected to her throughout his life. Leonardo mentions his mother Caterina only three times in his notebooks. A first entry is Leonardo's draft for a letter, dated 1481. Leonardo was about 29 years old. The badly damaged sheet, however, reveals only two short lines: \"Tell, tell, tell me yet what is going on there, and let me know if the Caterina wants to do ...Tell, tell me if things ...\". From the few lines it is impossible to conclude today what was the reason for Leonardo's concern.\n\nAt the age of 41 Leonardo lives in Milan. Here he mentions his mother again: \"Caterina came on 16.7.1493\". In the following year a Catarina died of the change fever, as can be inferred from the entry of a church in Milan. Since this church was located in the immediate vicinity of Leonardo's residence, and because Leonardo at the same time makes a note with a detailed list of the \"expenses for the funeral of Caterina\", it is obvious to assume that this Caterina was his mother. According to this, he took her in for care, three years after her husband Accattabriga had died. Probably her situation had become more and more precarious after the death of her husband. She lived to be about 67 years old.\n\nDid Leonardo's mother really die in Milan?\n\nThe example of Caterina's death is a good illustration of how ambiguous the historical sources are regarding essential statements in Leonardo's life. For the entry of the church in Milan on the death of a Caterina reads in full:\n\n\"On June 26 [1494] Catharina of Florence, 6o years old, died of exchange fever. Parish of Saints Narbone and Felice in the Milanese quarter of Porta Vercellina.\" (Catharina was the Milanese spelling of the Florentine Caterina.)\n\nIt can now be argued that the Catharina who died in Milan need not have been the Caterina from Vinci.\n\nthe Catharina who died in Milan in 1494 was 60 years old, would therefore have been born in 1434\n\nCaterina, wife of Accattabriga, living in Vinci, would have been 67 years old in 1494. This is evident from a tax return of her husband, in which she is mentioned as being 60 years old in 1487. According to this she was born in 1427\n\nThe seven years difference could be explained on the one hand by an inaccuracy of the respective scribes, who simply rounded the years. Possibly for unknown reasons they were also given a wrong age, possibly by Leonardo himself. For when his father died, he noted that he had reached the age of 80. Why Leonardo rounded to tens in both cases would then be unclear.\n\nOn the other hand, due to the shown age difference of seven years, it is possible that Catharina from Milan, who died in 1494, and Caterina from Vinci, who was recorded for tax purposes in 1487, were two different persons. The fact that Leonardo's life often seems so mysterious today is due to these and similar inconsistencies. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted in Leonardo research today that Catharina Leonardo's mother, who died in Milan, was from Vinci/Florence.\n\nVinci childhood and education\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's father, Ser Piero da Vinci was born on 19.04.1426. He grew up on the family estates in Vinci and later, like all his ancestors, was trained as a notary. Hence the 'Ser' in his name. This was a name suffix reserved exclusively for lawyers.\n\nSer Piero probably worked as a notary from 1446, since a tax return from that year no longer lists him in the household of his father Antonio. He first worked in Pistoia, about 35 km from Florence, where his sister Violante had married. Around 1452 he had a brief affair with a Caterina who bore him his first son, Leonardo. As was customary at the time, Ser Piero acknowledged the illegitimate child, but gave him into the care of his parents in Vinci. Since Ser Piero was very busy, career-minded, and traveled a lot, Leonardo probably did not see him much during his childhood. It is possible that Ser Piero stayed briefly in Pisa before finally settling in Florence from 1458 at the latest. This is evidenced by a contract issued by him in that year. Leonardo was about six years old at that time and lived, still separated from his father, with his grandparents in Vinci.\n\nSer Piero brings Leonardo to Florence\n\nAbout 1464 Leonardo's grandfather Antonio died. His son Ser Piero calls him 'deceased' in a document in 1465. Probably because of this and because Leonardo was of educable age, his father brings him to Florence. Leonardo's grandmother Lucia probably accompanied him, as she too is named as a member of Ser Piero's household in a 1469 tax return. Exactly when Leonardo came to Florence is unknown. Usually an apprenticeship began at the age of 12-15, which speaks for the years between 1464 and 1467. Based on a tax return, it is safe to say that Leonardo lived with Ser Piero in Florence from 1469 at the latest, when he was 17 years old.\n\nSer Piero promotes Leonardo's talents\n\nIn the 1460s, Ser Piero, who was now about 40 years old, had already achieved a high reputation in Florence. As a notary, he was wealthy, had numerous political connections, and was quite influential. Leonardo was by then his only descendant, which is why he gave him special encouragement.\n\nHe provided Leonardo with an apprenticeship with the important Florentine artist Andrea del Verrocchio, who, with Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Lorenzo di Credi and Perugino, trained many later very important painters of the Renaissance. The workshop was considered one of the most important in Italy at that time. The place of training was certainly expensive, but well chosen and certainly one of the reasons for Leonardo's later fame.\n\nIn addition, his father continued to support his son's career in later years and tried to use his growing influence as a notary in the Florentine city government to arrange commissions for Leonardo. It was probably through his mediation that Leonardo received the commissions for the unfinished works \"Saint Jerome\" and the \"Adoration of the Magi\".\n\nSer Piero's wives\n\nSer Piero married very young women who came from notary families he knew.\n\nCaterina\n\nSer Piero had an affair with a Caterina around 1452. She became pregnant and bore him the illegitimate child Leonardo. Marriage to Caterina was ruled out due to differences in estates. In addition, there is the possibility that the affair coincided with Ser Piero's engagement to his first wife Albiera. A dissolution of this engagement would certainly have led to legal disputes and financial claims, especially since both families involved were notary families.\n\nAlbiera\n\nStill in 1452, shortly after Leonardo's birth, Ser Piero married Albiera di Giovanni Amadori (*1436), who was only fifteen years old. Albiera was the daughter of a rich Florentine notary and thus a wife befitting her status. Albiera died already in 1464 at the age of 28. The marriage remained childless. Leonardo was probably deeply attached to Albiera, as he maintained close contacts with her family, especially her brother, far beyond her death, as is known from some preserved letters.\n\nFrancesca\n\nSer Piero remarried shortly after Albiera's death in 1465. Francesca di Ser Giovanni Lanfredini (*1449) was also very young at sixteen. She was the daughter of a Florentine notary friend. The marriage remained childless, as did that with Albiera. She also died very young at about 26 years of age around 1475.\n\nMargherita\n\nIn 1475 Ser Piero married the 18-year-old Margherita di Francesco di Jacopo di Guglielmo (*1457). With the birth of Leonardo's half-brother Antonio in 1476, Leonardo loses his status as Ser Piero's only son. Leonardo is now already 24 years old. Margherita and Ser Piero have a total of six children until she too dies around 1486 at about 28 years old.\n\nLucrezia\n\nIn 1486 Ser Piero marries for the last time, the 22-year-old Lucrezia Di Guglielmo Cortigiani (*1464). With her he also fathered six children. The year of her death is unknown.\n\nLeonardo's concern for the father\n\nIn one of Leonardo's notebooks (Codex Atlanticus 178v) is the beginning for a draft of a letter he wanted to write to his father.\n\n\"Dearest father,\n\non the last of last month I received your letter, which gave me joy and sorrow in the smallest of ways: joy because I learned that you were well, for which I thank God. It grieved me when I learned of your misfortune\".\n\nThe entry on the otherwise blank sheet is one of the few notes that Leonardo did not write in mirror writing. It is unclear when Leonardo wrote the letter and whether he completed and sent it. Thus, the note need not be directly related to his father's death.\n\nThe death of the father\n\nWith the fall of the Duke of Milan in 1499, Leonardo lost his patron. After wandering between Italian courts for several years, he returned to Florence around 1503, at the age of 51. During this period, he created artworks like the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, famously known as the 'Mona Lisa.' Leonardo's father, Ser Piero, was acquainted with Lisa's husband, Francesco del Giocondo, so it's possible that the painting was commissioned through the influence of Leonardo's father.\n\nA year later, on July 9, 1504, Leonardo's father, Ser Piero da Vinci, passed away in Florence. In his will, Ser Piero did not explicitly mention Leonardo, his illegitimate son. This led to a dispute among the family members over the inheritance, and Leonardo, as an illegitimate and therefore not legally recognized son, received nothing.\n\nLeonardo's enigmatic notes\n\nIn connection with his father's death, two separate and intriguing notes made by Leonardo are worth noting:\n\n\"On Wednesday at 7 o'clock, Ser Piero da Vinci died, on July 9, 1504, Wednesday at seven o'clock.\" (Codex Atlanticus, 196v)\n\n\"On July 9, 1504, Wednesday, at 7 o'clock, Ser Piero da Vinci, Notary of the Palace of the Podestà, my father, died. He was 80 years old. He left behind 10 sons and two daughters.\" (Codex Arundel, 272r)\n\nThese notes raise several mysteries:\n\nLeonardo recorded the same information in two different notebooks, with slight variations, and repeated the date and time at the end of the line in the Codex Atlanticus\n\nHe stated that his father died on July 9, 1504, which was a Tuesday, not a Wednesday\n\nLeonardo indicated that his father would have turned 80 years old, which contradicts current research that suggests Ser Piero was born in 1426 (see Charles Nicholl, Leonardo). Therefore, Ser Piero would have been 78 years old when he passed away. Leonardo might have rounded up to 80 years when writing the note. Likewise, Leonardo's mother, Caterina, is officially recorded as having died at 60 years old in the parish records of the Holy Narbone, even though she was actually 67 years old. Leonardo might have provided incorrect dates to the scribes, and the reasons for this are unknown\n\nWhen listing the sons, Leonardo did not include himself. Ser Piero had a total of 11 sons, including Leonardo, not 10, and two daughters"
