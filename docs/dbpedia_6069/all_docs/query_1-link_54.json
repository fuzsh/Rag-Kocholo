        "text": "Leonardo da Vinci-Biography\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was born just outside of Tuscany, Italy on April 15, 1452. He was raised by his father and his stepmother for a while before moving to Vinci to live with his uncle and grandparents.\n\nAs a boy, he received some basic schooling, learning fundamental reading, writing, and math skills. As a young teen, he went to Florence to participate in an apprenticeship under Andrea del Verrocchio. Under de Verrocchio, he learned drawing, painting, sculpting, carpentry, leather and metalworking. It was during this time that he created his earliest work, a landscape drawing of the Arno valley (1473).\n\nIn 1472, da Vinci entered the painters' guild in Florence. He concurrently worked with del Verrocchio during this period. Leonardo da Vinci received his first commission in 1478 as he was picked to create a piece for the altar inside of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. After this, he was commissioned to complete the painting \"Adoration of the Magi\". However, da Vinci left Florence without completing either project.\n\nIn the 1480s, da Vinci began to study human and animal anatomy. He dissected both human and animal corpses. He made realistic sketches of skeletal, muscular, and vascular systems. He drew sex organs and a fetus in utero. These were some of the earliest drawings of their kind. This, in turn, made his art far more realistic.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was a well-rounded student-he studied physics, hydraulics, aeronautics, geology, botany, and zoology. He sketched his observations on paper and later organized them into notebooks, categorized into broad topics like anatomy or architecture.\n\nIn 1482, da Vinci moved to Milan to work for the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza. da Vinci's official title was \"Painter and Engineer of the Duke\". While there, he not only painted and sculpted but also worked as an architecture and military advisor and a hydraulic and mechanical engineer. During this time, he was commissioned to paint three more portraits, but they either disappeared or were never completed in the first place. He worked on The Virgin of the Rocks, an alter painting. Shortly after, he painted The Last Supper and a ceiling in the Sala delle Asse. da Vinci also worked on a sculpture to honor Francesco Sforza. He was in Milan until Sforza fell from power.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci left Milan in 1499 as it was taken over by the French (he returned in 1506). He spent some time traveling to Mantua and then to Venice before returning to Florence.\n\nLeonardo left Florence in 1502 to work for Cesare Borgia as a military architect and engineer. He traveled with Borgia for nearly a year, sketching city plans and crafting topographical maps.\n\nIn 1503 he returned to Florence to work on a project that involved diverting the Arno river. He also worked on the painting the Battle of Anghiari and the Mona Lisa.\n\nIn 1506, da Vinci traveled to Milan with a group of students and assistants. da Vinci was commissioned to sculpt a tomb for Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. The work was never finished.\n\nHe moved to Rome in 1513, after being given a stipend and suite to stay in by Giuliano de Medici. He brought students and assistants with him. Medici did not commission many pieces of art, which gave da Vinci the opportunity to study math and science.\n\nIn 1515 he was given the title \"Premier Painter and Engineer and Architect to the King\" by King Francis I. He left Rome for France, never returning to Rome. Leonardo moved to the Chateau de Cloux near the king's summer palace. He did little painting at this time.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci pursued his scientific studies until he died in May 1519. He was 67 years old. It is generally assumed that he died from a stroke."
