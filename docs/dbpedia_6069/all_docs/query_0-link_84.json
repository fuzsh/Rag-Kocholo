        "text": "The Royal Château of Amboise has announced that the Chapel of Saint-Hubert, the final resting place of Leonardo da Vinci, will reopen June 15, 2024 after a vast, nearly 3-year restoration project (just in time for the Paris Olympics from late July to early August 2024 with many visitors expected to France this year).\n\nExciting news! Stepping into the Saint-Hubert Chapel on the grounds of the Royal Château of Amboise and seeing the tomb of Leonardo da Vinci in person is a moving experience. Amboise inhabitants and visitors alike have been patiently waiting for this day!\n\nIn celebration, a rich program of events will take place at the Royal Château of Amboise starting this spring to include an exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci Engraving Masterpieces from the collections of the BNF, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (the National Library of France), on view from June 1 to September 22, 2024.\n\nWhy is Leonardo da Vinci buried at the Royal Château of Amboise?\n\nFrench Renaissance King Francis I was only 20 years old when he was crowned King of France in 1515 and would reign until he died in 1547 at age 52. Soon after his coronation, he waged war in Italy and was victorious at the Battle of Marignan. While in Italy, King Francis I met the genius Leonardo da Vinci, a man he revered and would come to love like a father. He invited Leonardo da Vinci to France to become “premier painter, architect and engineer of the king” and welcomed him to live at the Château du Clos Lucé steps away from the Royal Château of Amboise, the royal residence and the Château Gaillard, where the most renowned Gardener of Europe, the Italian monk Dom Pacello, cultivated the Gardens of the King and the first Royal Orangery under three successive Kings of France: Charles VIII, Louis XII and finally King Francis I.\n\nThe 64-year-old Leonardo da Vinci accepted the invitation from King Francis I and traveled to France in the fall of 1516 with major paintings including theMona Lisa, the Virgin and the Child and St.John the Baptist, plus his notes, sketches and manuscripts later compiled to form the Da Vinci codex. A secret underground passage linked the Royal Château of Amboise with the Château du Clos Lucé enabling the two to meet, share ideas and collaborate on projects over three years until Leonardo da Vinci’s death at the Château du Clos Lucé in 1519 at age 67. In those three years, Leonardo da Vinci created elaborate, sumptuous festivities for the French royal court and heavily influenced the design of the Château de Chambord(about an hour drive from Amboise), the magnificent Royal Palace of King Francis I (the biggest castle in France), which began construction the year of Da Vinci’s death. As he wished, Leonardo da Vinci was laid to rest for eternity at the Chapel of Saint-Hubert at the Royal Château of Amboise.\n\nShare\n\nLeonardo da Vinci in Amboise Today\n\nLeonardo da Vinci is universally revered but has a special place in the hearts of those living in Amboise and the Loire Valley. Families love to visit the Château du Clos Lucé, Da Vinci’s last home, and its vast park with its interactive reproductions of Da Vinci’s inventions. The Chapel of Saint-Hubert is visible above the walls of the Royal Château of Amboise and is a daily reminder of Da Vinci’s presence.\n\nThe elegant exterior of the Chapel has been covered in scaffolding for nearly three years. French craftsmen and experts in historical preservation - decorators, stone cutters, carpenters, stained glass artists - have been meticulous in their painstaking restoration work. At last, this June, all will be able to step inside and experience the beauty of the Chapel again and pay homage at Leonardo’s resting place once more.\n\nLiving here and as a travel guide, I have visited the three castles of Amboise countless times and am always in awe of their rich history. As the Loire Valley Concierge, I have had the honor of organizing private events and dinners at both theRoyal Château of Amboiseand Château du Clos Lucé. Each experience has been magical!\n\nHere’s hoping I’ll be welcoming you here soon for a visit or a special event so you too can experience these illustrious sites and the newly restored Chapel of Saint-Hubert!\n\nHave you visited the town of Amboise and visited any of its three castles?
