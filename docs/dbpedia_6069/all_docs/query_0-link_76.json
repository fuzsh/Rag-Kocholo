        "text": "In 1515, Francis I won the Milan area in the battle of Marignan, and invited Leonardo to come to France.\n\nThe following year, the artist arrived at the Château du Clos Lucé after a journey across the Alps on mule-back. He brought with him three paintings: the Mona Lisa, Saint John the Baptist, and The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. Leonardo was named as “The King’s First Painter, Engineer and Architect”, and received a pension of 1000 gold crowns per year.\n\nIn 1519, the artist died at Le Clos Lucé at the age of 67.\n\n- Château du Clos Lucé - Official Website (online Dec. 2015)"
