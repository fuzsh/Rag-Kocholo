        "text": "Visiting the Loire Valley and Amboise in particular? Visit the Château du Clos Lucé! If you're interested in Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian painter, architect, scientist and engineer born in 1452, this visit is a must. The château, long a summer residence for the kings of France, was also home to the Renaissance genius for three years, before he died in 1519. In the château, its garden and park, you'll find a showcase for Leonardo da Vinci's work in architecture and painting.\n\nIn this article, you'll find a selection of images to help you prepare for your visit and make up your own mind about this unusual château.\n\nWhy visit the Château du Clos Lucé?\n\nIs the Château du Clos Lucé worth it? Our opinion:\n\nIt's well worth a visit if you're interested in Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). This Italian Renaissance genius left his mark on history with his Mona Lisa and his many inventions. We discover all the facets of his work, in every field. The tour of the castle is fairly quick, and it's worth noting that very little is original. Leonardo da Vinci's studio, for example, was designed by the Saint-Bris family, who have owned the estate since 1854. However, the course is fun, and strolling through the garden and park is very pleasant.\n\nWhy is the castle famous?\n\nLe Clos Lucé is famous above all for its connection with Leonardo da Vinci. We were thus immersed in the last home of this Renaissance genius, who came to Amboise in 1516 at the request of the King of France, François I. He did not hesitate to accept the sovereign's invitation, as his protector in Italy, Julien de Medici, had died earlier in the year. Leonardo da Vinci was named \"the king's first painter, engineer and architect\".\n\nHowever, his health was already fragile: he no longer painted or sculpted, suffering from paralysis of the right hand following a stroke. The last years of his life were devoted mainly to town-planning projects and organizing the king's sumptuous festivities. We found it quite fascinating to discover where this genius lived out his final moments!\n\nReserve your ticket now!\n\nOur favorite moments\n\nA visit to Le Clos Lucé is a rich experience that will appeal to a wide range of sensibilities. As far as we're concerned, here are our favorites:\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's bedroom: we found it touching to see this room, which is also richly decorated.\n\nIn the basement, where the models are on display, we really enjoyed discovering Leonardo da Vinci's construction work. We knew him more as a painter and were impressed by all his inventions!\n\nThe park: just like the garden, the park is very pleasant, but what we particularly liked was seeing the models we'd seen in the château's basement reproduced at actual size! It was an ideal way to realize the true proportions of these inventions.\n\nHistory in brief\n\nThe Château du Clos Lucé was formerly known as the Manoir de Cloux. For many years, it was a stronghold of the Château d'Amboise, an important town in the Loire Valley. It has seen a succession of owners, and its condition has deteriorated. In 1471, it was designed according to the layout we know today: a dwelling, a square tower and, above all, a facade in the style of the period, in pink brick and tufa stone.\n\nIn 1490, the château became a summer residence for the kings of France, following Charles VIII's purchase of the estate. He lived there with his wife Anne de Bretagne until her death. The estate then passed into the hands of Charles IV, who sold it to François I's mother, Louise de Savoie.\n\nAfter Leonardo da Vinci's stay, Le Clos Lucé was inhabited by various owners, notably the d'Amboise family, who redecorated it in 18th-century style. This decoration was removed by the Saint-Bris family, who acquired the estate in 1855 and opened it to the public in 1954. The château has been listed as a Historic Monument since 1862.\n\nVirtual visit of the château on video\n\nWatch a short video summarizing our experience at Château du Clos Lucé.\n\nAccess and map: Château du Clos Lucé, Amboise\n\nWhere is the Château du Clos Lucé?\n\nThe château is located in the Centre-Val de Loire region, at the following address: 2 Rue du Clos Lucé, (37400), Amboise.\n\nDriving time from Nantes: 2h40,\n\nDriving time from Angers: 1h40,\n\nDriving time from Orléans: 1h20,\n\nDriving time from Saumur: 1h15,\n\nDriving time from Blois: 40min,\n\nDriving time from Tours: 35min.\n\nHere is a map to help you find your way:\n\nHow to get there?\n\nTo get to Amboise, you can opt for the train. There are regular connections from nearby train stations, such as Orléans (55min direct TER journey), Blois (20min) and Tours (20min). From some departure cities, such as Nantes or Paris-Montparnasse station, you'll need to make a connection at Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. If you want to take a direct train from Paris, it takes 1h45 from Gare d'Austerlitz.\n\nSee the available schedules and book your train tickets now.\n\nFrom the station, it's a 10-minute drive or 25-minute walk to the castle. Some municipal buses run between the station and Amboise town center. Bicycles are also available for hire. For more information, visit the official town hall website here.\n\nIf you're looking for a 3-day train itinerary to discover the chateaux of the Loire Valley, we've put together a dedicated article for you.\n\nYou can also come directly by car, as the town is very well served by the A10 and A85 freeways. If you're planning to visit several Loire castles, we advise you to bring your own vehicle. It's the most convenient way to get from one tourist attraction to the next without wasting too much time.\n\nParking\n\nA parking lot reserved for visitors to the estate is located 300m from the main entrance and opposite the secondary entrance (open from April to August, depending on visitor numbers). Parking is available at an additional cost.\n\nIf you're visiting the Loire Valley by bike, you'll find a bicycle garage and secure lockers on site.\n\nPractical advice: duration, schedules, eating...\n\nBest time to visit the castle\n\nVisitor numbers at Château du Clos Lucé are high, and have been rising in recent years. In 2019, the estate welcomed nearly 100,000 visitors! If possible, we therefore advise you to visit us on weekdays, outside school vacations and public holidays. In terms of timing, we recommend a morning visit. The estate is very busy from 12pm to 6pm, with a peak between 2pm and 3pm.\n\nTo make sure your visit is a success, book your ticket now!\n\nLength of visit and main difficulties\n\nTo visit the château, garden, park and various buildings, we recommend you allow at least 2 hours. There are no major difficulties on the ground, although there are cobblestones in the château courtyard and a staircase to access the first floor.\n\nThe basement, first floor and entire park are accessible to people with reduced mobility. A wheelchair is available on presentation of an ID card at reception. In the park, sound terminals reproduce Leonardo da Vinci's thoughts (English, French, Italian, German). Hearing-impaired visitors can request the texts for the audio terminals from the ticket office.\n\nA left-luggage service is available. Dogs are welcome on the estate (carried in the château, on a leash in the park).\n\nAdvice on how to visit\n\nWe recommend starting your visit at the castle. This will allow you to plunge into Leonardo da Vinci's intimacy, to discover his inventions, before seeing some of them in real size in the château grounds. As far as we were concerned, we first visited the garden, then the galleries, and finally the rest of the park and its various buildings (dovecote...). But there's no obligation to visit! A map of the estate will help you find your way around.\n\nThe castle with children\n\nWith its playful dimension, the estate is perfectly suited to children. They'll love strolling through the garden and seeing the life-size models, which they can even handle! A visit booklet for children aged 7-12 is available at reception (in French and English).\n\nA guided tour for 7-14 year olds is available during school vacations. Leonardo da Vinci's cook will tell you all about the life of this prodigious inventor! For more information, visit the tourist office website here.\n\nYou can also celebrate your child's birthday at the estate, with a fun tour and a treasure hunt. Visit the official Le Clos Lucé website here to find out more.\n\nAt Le Clos Lucé, you'll be able to warm up your baby's bottle, and you'll find adapted toilets (low washbasin, step stool and bowl adapter). However, to facilitate movement around the château, baby carriages are only allowed in the park. So pack a baby carrier.\n\nIn fact, it's on our list of the best Loire châteaux to visit with children.\n\nSchedules and rates\n\nLe Clos Lucé is open every day of the year, except December 25th and January 1st.\n\nSchedules:\n\nJanuary: 10 a.m.-6 p.m.\n\nFebruary to June and September to October: 9am-7pm\n\nJuly to August: 9am-8pm\n\nNovember to December: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nPlease note that the ticket office and château close 1 hour before the park closes.\n\nRates:\n\nFull adult price: €18\n\nChildren (7 to 18) and students: €12.50\n\nFree admission for children under 7.\n\nFamily package 2 adults and 2/3 or 4 children: €49/€52/€54\n\nBook your ticket now!\n\nPlease note that other reduced rates (jobseekers, people with reduced mobility...) are available.

The restaurant is open from February to November.\n\nLa Table du Moulin: set in the park, this restaurant serves grilled meats, salads and desserts at lunchtime, as well as refreshments and delicacies throughout the day. Open from April to September.\n\nL'emporté: located next to the Table du Moulin, this snack bar, open only in July and August, is sure to satisfy your hunger pangs!\n\nL'Auberge du Prieuré: this gourmet restaurant in the park offers historic, Renaissance-inspired cuisine for lunch. The service, provided in period costume and in Old French, will be one to remember! The Auberge du Prieuré is open all year round.\n\nIf you prefer to eat off the estate, we recommend the following restaurants:\n\nL'Ecluse: this gourmet restaurant in the heart of Amboise offers seasonal cuisine that showcases local produce in refined presentations.\n\nLes Arpents: sophisticated cuisine in a warm atmosphere - that's the identity of the Michelin-starred restaurant Les Arpents.\n\nLa Fourchette: if you have a small appetite, La Fourchette, a healthy tapas restaurant, is for you!\n\nChâteau du Clos-Lucé: summer residence of the kings of France\n\nMarguerite de Navarre's bedroom\n\nBefore it became the home of Italian painter and inventor Leonardo da Vinci for 3 years, Le Clos Lucé was a summer residence for the kings of France. That's why the 1st floor houses the bedroom of Marguerite de Navarre, Queen of Navarre and mother of the future King of France Henri IV. She lived there with her husband Charles IV d'Alençon from 1509 to 1515, when the Duc d'Alençon sold the estate to his mother-in-law, Louise de Savoie. Marguerite de Navarre was the sister of François I, King of France from 1515 to 1547, and the daughter of Louise de Savoie. We found this room elegant, with its beautiful tapestries.\n\nThis room was restored in 2011, and decorated with furniture and objects from various periods and origins. Crockery, in particular covered mugs dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, caught our eye.\n\nDon't miss the portrait of Marguerite de Navarre, painted by the king's painter, François Clouet. Admiring this painting made it easier for us to immerse ourselves in the place, and to imagine this Renaissance sovereign living there!\n\nAnne de Bretagne's Oratory\n\nTo continue our visit, we change era and owner. We enter one of our favorite rooms on the tour: the Oratoire d'Anne de Bretagne. This room was created in 1490 by Charles VIII, the new owner of the château, which he transformed into a château d'agrément. In the past, Le Clos Lucé was more of a medieval fortress, as evidenced by the parapet walk that can still be seen today. The Oratory was dedicated to his wife Anne de Bretagne, Duchess and later Queen of France on 2 occasions in the late 15th century. She lived at Le Clos Lucé until her departure for Blois, where she died in 1514.\n\nTake a close look at this Gothic tufa stone chapel. It is adorned with beautiful murals by the disciples of Leonardo da Vinci. Can you recognize the episodes from the Bible? You'll see the Annunciation and the Last Judgment, but what struck us most was a Virgin of Light. Located above the gate, this \"Virgo Lucis\" is said to have given the château its name \"Clos Lucé\"!\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nThe tour continues on the first floor, in a large room known as \"La Salle du Conseil\". We weren't expecting to discover a room so richly decorated with splendid tapestries and reproductions of works by Leonardo da Vinci. It was the first time a Mona Lisa had been seen outside the Louvre!\n\nOne piece of furniture, topped with a parrot, caught our eye. We really had the impression that this stuffed animal was staring at us!\n\nLa Cuisine\n\nStill on the first floor, we then visited the kitchen. It is enhanced by a particularly massive fireplace, which we found impressive. Imagine Leonardo da Vinci seated in the center of the room, served by his servant Mathurine. In this kitchen, there are no utensils for preparing and cutting meat, but rather dishes based on fruit, seeds... Leonardo da Vinci favored vegetarian meals, considering a dietetic diet as a means of maintaining good health.\n\nTake time to admire the tapestries on the kitchen wall. Once again, they're well worth a look!\n\nIn the intimacy of Leonardo da Vinci\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's bedroom\n\nLet's now turn our attention to the rooms in the tour dedicated to the Renaissance master. First, we discovered his room. Very elegant, with its four-poster bed in dark wood and bright red velvet, this room gave us a certain emotion. Leonardo da Vinci died in this room. It was also here that he drew up his will for the benefit of his disciple Francesco Melzi, who inherited his manuscripts, sketchbooks and drawings. The room overlooks the Château Royal d'Amboise, a good reminder of Leonardo da Vinci's links with King François I and his court.\n\nWe really appreciated the Renaissance cabinet in ebony and engraved ivory at the far end of the room. Her delicate ornamentation was sublime!\n\nThe \"reconstruction\" of the master's studio\n\nThe tour continues on the first floor, where you'll find the other rooms dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci. First, we entered a reconstruction of the painter's studio. Although historians have no information on this room, and de Vinci was no longer painting when he arrived at Le Clos Lucé due to the paralysis of his right hand, the owners wanted to create this room to immerse visitors in the spirit of this creator.\n\nIt has been decorated in the atmosphere of Renaissance \"Bottegas\". These painters' studios were at once their place of production, commerce and training. We saw for the first time reproductions of his most famous works: The Virgin, Child Jesus and Saint Anne, and Saint John the Baptist.\n\nWhat really caught our attention, however, were the sketches, which clearly show Leonardo da Vinci's style and interest in the study of movement.\n\nThe Scientific Cabinet\n\nThe immersion in the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci continues in the following rooms. This time, we discovered Leonardo da Vinci the scientist, with his study. On display are old books and facsimiles from the Institut de France, as well as models and globes.\n\nWe were stunned by the beauty of the measuring instruments!\n\nWe were then surprised by an immersive encounter with Leonardo da Vinci, with an audiovisual production showing the Renaissance genius in his study, in the form of a hologram!\n\nBasement: Leonardo da Vinci the inventor\n\nWe were delighted with our visit to the basement! This part of the tour presents Leonardo da Vinci's inventions, which are generally less well known to visitors than his paintings (as was ours!). So it was with great curiosity and interest that we discovered all the inventions of this genius painter, whether in the field of armaments or aeronautics.\n\nNumerous models were on display for educational purposes (bridges, tanks, multi-directional machine guns...). We even saw the first model of a car, admittedly primitive, but designed by Leonardo da Vinci!\n\nJardin du Clos-Lucé: the many facets of Leonardo da Vinci\n\nGarden and botany: sources of inspiration\n\nAfter a tour of the château's basement and a visit to the boutique, you'll come across the estate's garden. The idea of this garden is to show all Leonardo da Vinci's sources of inspiration, which can be found in his paintings and codexes. You'll see trees and plants depicted in his most famous paintings, from Italian cypresses and yews to the Madonna Lily and Mona Lisa rose. Water is an important element in Leonardo da Vinci's work, which is why you'll find numerous springs and fountains.\n\nWhat struck us most about this garden was its main pool, with mist evoking the painter's emblematic sfumato technique. The basin is topped by a 2-level solid oak bridge designed by the artist. We found this place very poetic!\n\nFinally, don't miss the freestanding bridge leading to the Galeries. This bridge, also known as the \"wild bridge\", was designed by Leonardo da Vinci for military purposes. Thanks to its ingenious self-locking system of assembly and embedding, this bridge, using neither nails nor screws, was easily dismantled and transported. This ensured a surprise effect against the enemy, and a win-win situation.\n\nThe gallery: Leonardo da Vinci architect\n\nIn 2021, the Domaine du Clos Lucé has added a new space: the Leonardo da Vinci galleries. Located in the garden, they are housed in a rehabilitated 500m2 former industrial building. The tour begins with an introduction to Leonardo da Vinci as an architect. We learned a great deal about his work, including staircase design (like the one at Chambord). Through models and a modern scenography, we became aware of the breadth of Leonardo da Vinci's thoughts on these subjects.\n\nOur favorite part was the section on the design of centered-plan religious buildings. Don't miss this superb manuscript with Leonardo da Vinci's drawings and architectural studies on the subject.\n\nWe're sure that, like us, you'll be able to get a real feel for it, thanks to this large-scale model based on his drawings!\n\nThe gallery: Leonardo da Vinci the painter\n\nPart 2 features an immersive virtual show immersing us in 17 masterpieces and 200 drawings by Leonardo da Vinci! Projected on walls and ceilings, the master's works are highlighted in an unprecedented way. We felt transported into the world of this Renaissance genius, so much so that the 15-minute show seemed to fly by!\n\nModel exhibition: weapons of war\n\nThe tour isn't over yet! After discovering the garden and galleries, we took a walk in the park. The latter is designed as an \"open-air museum\". Here you can admire some forty translucent canvases, representing elements from various works by Leonardo da Vinci. The tour is punctuated by sound terminals, where Jean Piat, a member of the Comédie Française, recounts the Italian master's thoughts.\n\nThe park's main attraction is its twenty or so giant interactive models. These were built according to Leonardo da Vinci's sketches. Most are on display in the château or in the galleries, in reduced size. Can you find their life-size duplicates? We found the tour very entertaining, and were able to see again the military models we'd seen in the château's basement. Here, for example, is an impressive tank.\n\nModel exhibition: civil constructions\n\nIn addition to armaments-related models (tanks, machine guns, bridges, etc.), we saw civil engineering models. For example, a large wheel, known as the \"squirrel wheel\", has existed since antiquity, but was adopted by Leonardo da Vinci in the design of his cranes and excavating machines. He had seen them in operation in his youth, during the construction of the Duomo in Florence.\n\nLast but not least, we must mention Leonardo da Vinci's iconic construction, the flying propeller! It reveals the Italian master's knowledge of aerodynamics and is considered today as a precursor to the helicopter.\n\nThe other buildings: the museum hall, the dovecote and the priory\n\nAs you stroll through the park, you'll come across other buildings. First of all, you'll see a beautiful 15th-century manor house. This is Le Prieuré, which houses the estate's gourmet restaurant, L'Auberge du Prieuré. Next, you'll come across a former industrial hall, the museum hall. It currently houses the estate's temporary exhibitions, which are accessible in addition to the entrance ticket.\n\nFinally, next to the Priory, you can visit a magnificent 15th-century dovecote. Don't hesitate to come in, we found the ceiling impressive, with its brick and tufa.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nAre photos allowed inside the château?\n\nPhotos are permitted throughout the estate.\n\nAre there any special events or temporary exhibitions at the château?\n\nTemporary exhibitions are regularly organized at Le Clos Lucé. Added to this are the events that punctuate the year. These include the \"Flâneries nocturnes\", which feature live entertainment by candlelight throughout the estate. This event takes place in August, while at the end of September Le Clos Lucé hosts the Festival Européen de Musique Renaissance.
