        "text": "Leonardo da Vinci is most renowned for his artistic creations, his contributions to science and his inventions throughout the Renaissance era. His accomplishments and works helped cement his legacy in history. He incorporated scientific concepts into all facets of life, including music and art. Da Vinci carried out dozens of meticulous studies and produced innovative technologies that were revolutionary at the time.\n\nHe made significant scientific discoveries as a result of his acute eye and fast thinking, yet he never shared his insights with the world. What some may not know about the history of Leonardo da Vinci is that he worked as a military engineer to create cutting-edge and lethal weaponry.\n\nDespite being one of the best historical painters of the Italian Renaissance, he only left behind a small number of finished works.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was the illegitimate son of a lawyer. He was born on April 15, 1452, not far from the Tuscan town of Vinci.\n\nGrowing up, young Leonardo da Vinci had access to academic books that were possessed by family members while being raised at his father’s house in Vinci. He was also exposed to the historical heritage of painting, and when he was approximately 15 years old, his father apprenticed him to the famed Florence studio of Andrea del Verrochio. Leonardo da Vinci showed his exceptional skill even while working as an apprentice. In fact, a number of works created by Verrocchio’s studio in Florence between the years of 1470 and 1475 appear to exhibit his talent. Up until 1477, da Vinci worked at the Verrocchio studio. In 1478, he established himself as a master on his own.\n\nIn 1482, Leonardo da Vinci gave up his first commission in Florence, “The Adoration of the Magi,” in order to work for the Duke of Milan. He was searching for a livelihood and new challenges. The governing Sforza family employed Leonardo da Vinci as an engineer, sculptor, painter, and architect. In the refectory of Milan’s Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie, he created a fresco depicting the “Last Supper.”\n\nThe Duke employed Leonardo da Vinci as a painter, sculptor and designer of extravagant court celebrations, but he also had him create machines, structures and weaponry. Da Vinci researched a variety of topics between the years 1485 and 1490, including nature, flying devices, geometry, mechanics, governmental building, canals and architecture. His research during this time period also included plans for cutting-edge armaments, such as tanks and other military vehicles, different combat gadgets, and even submarines. Da Vinci also created his first anatomical studies around this time. His Milan workshop was bustling with trainees and scholars.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was an accomplished artist with many famous paintings. His most-known paintings have made him go down in history as an internationally known artist. Tourists from all over the world travel just to see some of his work. Here are some of his most notable works.\n\nThe Last Supper\n\n“The Last Supper” is da Vinci’s depiction of an occasion that is described in all four of the Gospels that make up the Christian New Testament. Christ assembled his apostles for dinner the night before he was betrayed by one of them. He also told them he knew what was about to happen and washed their feet as a sign that everyone was on an equal footing with the Lord. Christ gave the disciples specific instructions on how to eat and drink in his memory as they shared a meal and beverage together. It was the first time the Eucharist, a tradition that is still followed, was celebrated.\n\nDa Vinci had never completed a painting of this size before and was unfamiliar with the fresco technique used in most murals. Contrary to frescos, where the pigments are blended with wet plaster, the painting was created using experimental colors straight on a dry plaster wall. As a result, it has not withstood the test of time well. Da Vinci had to fix the paint flaking from the wall even before it was done. It has fallen apart, been bombed, damaged and repaired throughout the years. Most likely, we see just a very small portion of the original today.\n\nIt was commonly known that da Vinci cared for symmetry. The arrangement in his “Last Supper” is primarily horizontal. The enormous table can be seen in the image’s foreground, with all of the people positioned behind it. With the exact equal number of individuals on either side of Jesus, the artwork is substantially symmetrical.\n\nMona Lisa\n\nPrivate commissioners requested Leonardo da Vinci between 1505 and 1507. He not only produced his most well-known work at this time, but also “The Mona Lisa,” which is perhaps the best-known and most well-known piece of art ever produced in the history of humankind.Behind this artifact, there are several hypotheses and tales: Jaundice is mentioned, many people assume it is a portion of a pregnant lady, and some think it is actually a male masquerading as a woman. There are a lot of hypotheses about this work, even if none of the reports are confirmed, and this is part of what makes it so alluring.\n\n“The Mona Lisa” was another ongoing project for Leonardo da Vinci; he never completely finished it and continued to strive for perfection. The actual picture was never delivered to the commissioner who had hired him for the job; instead, he kept it with him until his passing. It is presently concealed behind the thickest bulletproof glass in the Louvre in Paris. It is regarded as the most renowned work of art to have ever been produced by any artist throughout any time period or style of art in addition to being a national treasure.\n\nThe Vitruvian Man\n\nLeonardo da Vinci produced the work “The Vitruvian Man” sometime near the year 1487. It has annotations that refer to the designs created by renowned architect Vitruvius Pollio. The pen-and-ink artwork on paper shows a man with his arms and legs spread in two overlapping postures while also being drawn in both a circle and a square. This picture serves as the ideal illustration of Leonardo da Vinci’s intense attention to proportion. Additionally, this image serves as a fulcrum in da Vinci’s efforts to portray the connection between humanity and nature. Over the years, various efforts have been made to grasp the meaning of the foundation of Leonardo’s representation of Vitruvius’ ideas.\n\nLike the majority of works on paper, “The Vitruvian Man” is only periodically placed on display. The piece is kept in the Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice, Italy."
