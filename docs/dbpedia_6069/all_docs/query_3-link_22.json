        "meta_description": "The Château du Clos Lucé was Leonardo da Vinci's last home. In 1516, the Italian Renaissance genius accepted an invitation from King Francis I and settled in France. From Rome, he brought with him his notebooks and 3 of his major works (the Mona Lisa, St Anne and St John the Baptist), which are now kept in the Louvre. He made his home in Amboise, where he worked for the king on a wide range of projects. Leonardo da Vinci was a prolific and inspired engineer, architect and director of opulent festivities for the French court. He died on 2 May 1519 in his room and was buried not far away in Saint Hubert chapel in the royal château of Amboise. The Château du Clos Lucé (once known as Cloux Manor) is one of the greatest Loire châteaux you can visit in Touraine. The rooms in this vast red-brick residence will take you back to the rich history of the 16th century: two superb bedrooms (Leonardo's bedroom and Marguerite de Navarre, the king's sister's room), the kitchen, the council chamber (where the artist welcomed important guests), as well as the workshops. There is also a unique collection of Leonardo's inventions displayed in several different rooms and an exceptional garden. You can handle the models, which is lots of fun for children (for ages 7 to 12 there is also a special booklet for the visit). Since 2021, a new museum space entitled \"Leonardo da Vinci, painter and architect\" provides an insight into the considerable work of Leonardo da Vinci, prior to his creations. In the summer, evening strolls are organised to enjoy this place at nightfall. Practical information: the Château du Clos Lucé - Leonardo da Vinci Park is 26 km from Tours. There are three restaurants in the garden. The town of Amboise is an ideal weekend destination with a wide range of hotels!",
