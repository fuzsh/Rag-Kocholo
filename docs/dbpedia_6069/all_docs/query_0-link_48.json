        "text": "By Amy Fredrickson\n\nLeonardo died on 2 May 1519; it was not, though, until 12 August 1519 that he was buried in Amboise, France. Leonardo entered the French court through an invitation from King Francis I. It is plausible that Leonardo was in Bologna in 1515 and was in attendance during a meeting between Pope Leo X and Francis I. Leonardo’s inventions and artwork intrigued the French King, precipitating Leonardo’s relocation to France between August 1516 and May 1517.\n\nLeonardo spent his remaining years in France where he focused primarily on his inventions. Leonardo’s title was ‘first painter and engineer’ to Francis I, and the King provided the painter with a place to live in the manor house of Clos-Lucé in Amboise, located in the Loire Valley. Clos-Lucé was the summer residence of the French court. Drawings from Leonardo’s final years prove that he was continuing to invent, draw, and write while living in France.\n\nLeonardo’s assistants relocated with him, including his most prominent assistant, a Lombardian artist and nobleman named Francesco Melzi. Scholars proposed that Melzi may have produced some of the physical works from Leonardo’s drawings.\n\nSome of Leonardo’s most famous works were present in France when he died; however, they were probably painted in Italy and brought with the artist when he transferred. These works included The Mona Lisa and The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. Due to his failing health, Leonardo notarized his will on April 23, 1519. His assistant Melzi was his primary heir and estate executor.\n\nFew men have left Leonardo’s legacy. In Lives, Vasari romanticized his death stating that he died in the arms of the King of France. While this is an intriguing story, there is no evidence that this was the case. In his Treatise on Architecture,Sculptor Benvenuto Cellini quoted Francis I who stated, nearly two decades after Leonardo’s death, that:\n\n“There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture, and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher.“ (Turner, 52)\n\nThe narrative of Leonardo and Francis I influenced neoclassical artists, such as French artists Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) and François-Guillaume Ménageot (1744-1816). An Italian artist named Cesare Mussini (1804-70) also produced a painting that romanticized Leonardo’s death, and shows the High Renaissance artist dying in the arms of the King of France.\n\nReferences:\n\nKemp, Martin, ”Leonardo da Vinci.“ Grove Art Online.
