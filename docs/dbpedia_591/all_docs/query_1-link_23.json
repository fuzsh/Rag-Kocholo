        "text": "The case study about the Vido ossuary reveals all the difficulties the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes met in its effort to deal with the bodily remains of the fallen but also to create a unifying ideological pattern. Simultaneously, the creation of this memorial testifies about additional infrastructural problem that the new state had to solve, due to the very specific ’enlargement’ of its borders. The use of Yugoslavia’s scarce resources had to be now directed abroad as well. Some additional spaces had to be overcome and controlled. However, building an ossuary in a foreign country was also an expression of sovereignty, of power and capability. It was the showcase of the Yugoslav knowledge as well as art. In addition, it is important to stress that the entire social infrastructure of the Socialist Republic of Serbia of the late 1980s had to be set into motion. A myriad of social activities had to be launched in order to bring back the remembrance of the Vido fallen into the center of the Serbian national narrative.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to reveal how, over the time, Avala was put on the map, and became an influential symbolic topos of Serbian national memory. Furthermore, having fostered the evocation of national tradition related to this place, using the natural characteristics of this particular area and by the means of updating its exceptional historical and memorial capacity, Avala gained a highly committed and symbolic meaning in the mental geography of our nation. Later on, this potential was recognized as a tempting opportunity to create a monument with an overwhelming capacity for imposing a newly created Yugoslav cultural model by means of a highly needed transforming and redesigning the ideological identity of Avala. Raising a prominent national monument, the memorial complex to the Unknown Hero on Avala, near Belgrade, is a paradigm of obliteration, redefinition and alteration of tradition and collective memory. In the case of Avala we can clearly follow the process of exploitation and revision of the strategically selected image of the past and its adaptation to the needs of the current period.\n\n'Critical Memorial Practices and Their Forums. Reconfiguring Communities of Memory in Yugoslavia. On the Work of the Monument Group and Four Faces of Omarska Group' (2012) examines the tactics, methods and political potential of critical memorial practices in the new Yugoslav space. Not wishing to construct a rigid definition of ‘critical memorial practices’ I understand these as diverse artistic and intellectual procedures that confront the effects of dominant, nationalistic memorial cultures and work prospectively towards a different understanding of both collective memory and community. In analyzing their political potential in this particular socio-political context, I depart from a general understanding that conventional public monuments, rather than embodying memory, actually displace it, and, moreover, are in fact instrumental in either the production or suppression of specific memories through institutionalized forms of memory politics. While having this expanded version of Young’s premise in mind, I attempt to locate modalities through which the complex and challenging conjunctions of the concepts of embodiment, memory and the collective can be both politically and symbolically reclaimed. In the first part, aside from introducing a more general discussion on memorial cultures and counter-memorial drive, I delineate the specificities of the Yugoslav historical and political context. In the second part I move on to read the above-mentioned postulate by Young in order to argue that a process of reclamation is only possible through the re-situation of these concepts (of the monuments, collective memory and embodiment) outside the realm of singular artistic vision and visual representation and into the wider field of emancipatory politics. Such politics come to being thorough a collective reflection that not only involves an open and exploratory confrontation with the past, but also activates a radical reconstruction, reconfiguration and re-imagination of the idea of community. This reconfiguration, in turn, can only be achieved by forging new, non-essentialist communities of memory similar to “inoperative communities”, as elaborated by Jean Luc Nancy. In defining such an emancipatory idea of community in relation to memorial cultures I will have in mind some interrelated concepts developed by J-L. Nancy, as well as Maurice Blanchot and Giorgio Agamben. These theoretical configurations will be brought into relation with the idea of communism (understood in line with Alain Badiou) and its dissolution already in the Socialist State and brought to ultimate destruction through the genocidal politics of the 1990s. Finally, in the third part, I examine the multifaceted work of the Yugoslav art and theory platform - Monument Group as well as the work of the Four Faces of Omarska Group, by analysing the concrete case of the Omarska Concentration Camp. I contemplate the potential of a specific architectural remain on its as a 'becoming memorial'. In the conclusion, my central argument is that, in the face of a proliferation of monuments and cultures of ethnic and religious commemoration in the current transitional and post- conflict Yugoslav space, we should explore and seek to encourage those forms of the “embodiment of memory” which operate by way of instigating wider, continuous critical memorial forums consisting of different ‘voices’ and unresolvable conversations involving subjects and objects. Such forums reinvest with collective desire and radically politicize the political concepts and events from the past, such as the communist idea on which the Anti-fascist liberation struggle during WWII was based, and potentiate their effects in the present, simultaneously developing forms of memorialization that prefiguratively work towards a radically different, non- essentialist and “inoperative” community of the future.\n\nMemory, individual or collective, is not only closely related to socio-political phenomena, but also to socio-cultural such as architecture and art. As trans-generational witnesses to historical turmoil, still stand the monuments and memorials to the NOB (national liberation struggle). In former Yugoslavia between 1950’s and early 1980’s many monuments and memorial complexes were built to commemorate the great heroic battles against fascists or massacres over Yugoslavian innocent population. Several of them are on the territory of today’s Bosnia-Herzegovina. These memorials were designed with great passion and respect to the fallen victims by the most prominent Yugoslavian architects and sculptors. Each of these monuments is a unique sculptural masterpiece, with its size, form and volume on the border of becoming architecture. As a pride of the social heritage, generations of children, students and proletariat, until 1990’s would visit and pay their respect to the fallen victims of the past in hope for better future. All the ideals these monuments used to stand for are forgotten and those remarkable structures now represent unpleasant cultural and architectural heritage with which the post war society is trying to establish relationship. Unfortunately very often these monuments are left to decay. After dissolution of Yugoslavia and aggression against Bosnia 1992-1995 Partisans’ battles were forgotten. Memorials and monuments for recent victims had to be built. In this paper we want to focus on how today’s society deals with inherited socialist monuments and what kind of memorials have been built in the last 15 years for the victims of the 1992-95 liberation war in Bosnia."
