        "text": "Editor(s): Diana Mishkova, Marius Turda, Balázs Trencsényi\n\nPublisher: 2014\n\nLanguage: English\n\nDiscourses of Collective Identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770-1945) / Vol. IV / Anti-Modernism – Radical Revisions of Collective Identity\n\nEdited by Diana Mishkova (Center for Advanced Study Sofia), Marius Turda (Oxford Brookes University), and Balázs Trencsényi (Central European University, Budapest)\n\nThe last volume of the series presents 46 texts under the heading of “anti-modernism”. Formed in a dynamic relationship with modernism, from the 1880s to the 1940s, and especially during the interwar period, the anti-modernist ideological constructions of national identification had a considerable impact on the political culture of our region. These texts were born in different political contexts and also had different destinies: while some of them became central to the respective national canons, others were completely erased from the political culture of these countries after the Second World War. What is common to them, however, is the emphatic rejection of the linear vision of modernization as well as the liberal democratic institutional frameworks and the search for alternative paths to achieve a national regeneration.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nIntroduction by Sorin Antohi and Balázs Trencsényi; Chapter I. Integral nationalism; Chapter II.The crisis of the European conscience; Chapter III. In search of a national ontology; Chapter IV.Conservative redefinitions of tradition and modernity; Chapter V. The anti-modernist revolution.\n\nTexts by: Nikola Pašić, Georg Schönerer, Roman Dmowski, Nicolae Iorga, Aurel C.
