Ringwood Secondary College opened as Ringwood High School in 1954 and was one of the first high schools to be constructed in the new Light Timber Construction (LTC) style, which was developed by the Public Works Department in Victoria to address a chronic shortage in high school places in the 1950s.

Ringwood Secondary College provides education for years 7-12. Year 11 and 12 students undertake the VCE program. There are currently approximately 1460 students enrolled at the school.

In recent competitions, Melbourne School Bands Festival, Mt Gambier Generations in Jazz and the Royal South Street Competition, the school has received awards for its stage bands, strings ensembles and symphonic orchestra.

The RSC Musical Production is a major highlight of the College Calendar each year. The full-scale theatrical event brings together students from all of the performing arts areas of the college. The professional shows draw crowds of over 3000 each year, with some students having gone on to successful careers both on stage and in the technical areas of theatre production.
