        "text": "In 2013 Penola Catholic College unveiled an updated school uniform featuring new summer dress and winter skirt patters. Students changed to the new uniform during a four year transition period.\n\nAugust 2013\n\nhttp://www.penola.vic.edu.au/_uploads/_cknw/files/New%20uniform%20August%202013.pdf\n\nIMPORTANT UNIFORM UPDATE: CHANGES APPROVED!!!!!\n\nAs you may be aware, we have recently consulted on changes to our school uniform. The following changes have been ratified by the Board of Penola Catholic College for implementation commencing the 2014 school year.\n\nThe new uniform will be phased in over a number of years; with all students required to be wearing the new uniform for the commencement of the 2016 school year.\n\nFirst Phase: 2014\n\n• All Year 7 Students and students new to the College must wear the new uniform.\n\n• All Year 11 students to wear the new College Senior Blazer (The senior jumper and other items are optional).\n\nAll other students may wear the current uniform as long as it is in good repair and fits appropriately but must purchase all new items no later than the 2016 school year.\n\nSECOND PHASE: 2015\n\n• All Year 7 & 8 Students and students new to the College must wear the new uniform.\n\n• All Year 11 & 12 students to wear the new College Senior Blazer (The senior jumper and other items are optional).\n\n• Students in other year levels who have had need to purchase any new uniform items.\n\nFINAL PHASE: 2016\n\nAll students attending Penola Catholic College are to be wearing the new uniform.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: FROM 2014 ONWARDS:\n\nDiscontinued items will no longer be accepted / available for sale by the Second hand Uniform Shop.\n\nOur Official Uniform Suppliers for 2014 are Academy Uniforms. However for students not required to be in our new uniform in 2014 items of our existing uniform can still be purchased from Lowes.\n\nUNIFORM ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN CHANGED: The following outlines what uniform items have been changed:\n\n♦ Senior Blazer (Years 11 & 12)\n\n♦ Senior Jumper (Years 11 & 12)\n\n♦ College Summer Dress\n\n♦ College Winter Skirt\n\n♦ Girls Blouse\n\n♦ Boys Pants\n\n♦ Boys Shorts\n\n♦ PE Track Pants / PE Track Top\n\n♦ Rugby Top\n\n♦ Sports Shorts\n\n♦ Sports Polo Top\n\n♦ Boys & Girls Bathers\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nhttp://www.penola.vic.edu.au/_uploads/_ckpg/files/2015%20uniform%20update.pdf\n\nNEW UNIFORM PHASE IN PERIOD\n\nThe new uniform will be phased in over a number of years with all students required to be wearing the new uniform for the commencement of the 2016 school year.\n\nSECOND PHASE: 2015\n\n– All Year 7 & 8 students and student new to the College must wear the new uniform\n\n– All Year 11 & 12 students to wear the new College Senior Blazer (The senior jumper and other items are optional)\n\nAll other students may wear the current uniform as long as it is in good repair and fits appropriately but must purchase all new items no later than the 2016 school year.\n\nNovember 2015\n\nhttp://penola.vic.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penola-Vol.-17-12-Nov-2015.pdf\n\nChanges to Uniform in 2016 for Year 10\n\nAs a result of significant feedback from parents we have decided to delay the introduction of the new winter uniform for Year 10 Students next year.\n\nGiven the cost associated with purchasing a laptop as well as the new uniform, we are asking Year 10 parents to purchase the new summer uniform for the beginning of 2016 and many parents have already done this.\n\nOur school photographs take place early in Term 1, 2016 so it would be great to have all students in the new uniform.\n\nFor Years 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 all items of the new uniform are to be purchased for next year. A reminder that the\n\ntracksuit pants are optional; the Penola bathers are optional (navy blue one piece bathers as alternative) and Year 10 students can purchase the navy blazer (optional) if they wish.\n\nOne of the initiatives that the PSC set during 2015 was to hold a uniform drive, donating items of uniform that are being phased out. As all families should know, the new Penola uniform will be required as of January 2016, and we, the student leadership team, believe that sending our uniforms, would benefit the needy and disadvantaged in our society.\n\nTherefore, it is an opportune time to send our old uniforms to the Nepalese community to assist in their time of crisis after the two devastating earthquakes earlier this year. The PSC is asking for your assistance in supporting this initiative by donating the items of uniform that students have either grown out of, or are simply in good condition but no longer required/current for 2016.\n\nThe items that may be donated:\n\n– Maroon Blazers\n\n– Navy Blazers\n\n– Old ties\n\n– Boys trousers (without the embroidered PCC)\n\n– Shorts (without the embroidered PCC)\n\n– Old girls dresses\n\n– Plain maroon sports t-shirts\n\n– Sports track pants and shorts (plain navy without the burgundy piping)\n\n– Sports rugby jumper (with tri colour horizontal stripes)\n\n– Any other outgrown Penola uniform that would instead be thrown away\n\nBefore donating, please ensure that the items you wish to donate are not required for 2016 and have been superseded by the new uniform.\n\nWe understand that this initiative has been introduced quite early, however with\n\nTerm 3 coming to a close, many girls’ winter skirts particularly will no longer be\n\nappropriate for 2016\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nhttp://penola.vic.edu.au/download/newsletter/Volume-22.pdf\n\nFrom the first school day of 2016, all students must wear the new style uniform. The old style uniform is no longer accepted to be sold by the Second Hand Uniform Shop.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nhttp://penola.vic.edu.au/?wysija-page=1&controller=email&action=view&email_id=59&wysijap=subscriptions\n\nAt this stage the following changes have been suggested to the current uniform. Girls Summer Uniform to include navy shorts and the white short sleeved shirt. We are also looking at the optional introduction of navy skins to the Sports uniform. As many of you will have noticed, our students are reluctant to wear the navy track pants so navy skins worn underneath the existing sports uniform may enable students to stay warmer in the winter months.\n\nThe only male student at a Catholic girls’ school.\n\n27 May 2016\n\nhttps://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/singlesex-schools-in-transition-as-transgender-students-gain-acceptance-20160527-gp5nkw.html\n\nJeremy was the only male student at his Catholic girls’ school.\n\nHe had short spiky hair, hated wearing the school’s checked skirt and in Year 12, the Avila College student came out as a transgender male.\n\n“It was inherently a very gendered environment. It made it more difficult.”\n\nIt’s a situation many single-sex schools – whose entire existence has relied on rigid concepts of gender – are grappling with.\n\nFor the first time, the region’s peak body for girls schools, the Alliance of Girls Schools Australasia, is urging its members to support transgender students.\n\nThis includes males who transition to females and want to enrol in girls’ schools, and females who transition to males and want to remain in girls’ schools.\n\nEarlier this week, the organisation, which predominantly represents private girls’ schools, held a conference which focused on gender and transgender issues.\n\n“It’s an emerging issue, everyone is still learning what to do and that includes the doctors, the psychologists, the support services,” the Alliance’s president and Mentone Girls’ Grammar principal Fran Reddan said.\n\n“It’s critical that we provide a safe environment where all students can express their gender identity.”\n\nMicah Scott, the chief executive of LGBTI youth group Minus 18, said single-sex schools faced a unique challenge.\n\n“Their existence is based on the concept that the sex you are assigned at birth will match your gender identity,” he said.\n\nHe said teachers needed to avoid gendered language like “good morning girls” and should provide more flexible uniform options.\n\nJeremy agreed, and said he felt very uncomfortable wearing his school uniform.\n\n“A teacher told me that I could wear the trousers but said everyone would look at me funnily,” he said. He claimed another teacher picked on him.\n\nHuman Rights Law Centre director of advocacy Anna Brown said there did not seem to be a clear protection for transgender students in single-sex schools under federal discrimination law. But she said it was a grey area and yet to be tested in court.\n\nShe said schools should let transgender students wear uniforms and use toilets that reflected their gender identity. They should also ensure that sports divided along gender lines are inclusive, and that students are referred to using the name and pronoun of their choice."
