My wife might be one of the few here who was born in Garfiield, NJ. I am not an alumnus but am now one of the food truck volunteers.

As a Des Plaines Vanguard alumnus, I feel that the Cadets were kindred spirits. I marched in Garfield's show in 1962 and 1963. We were glad to be there. They reciprocated by competing in the Vanguard's show. Nice site.\n\nDate:\n\nAug-11-2014\n\nRemote User:\n\nJoseph Triola\n\nComments\n\nAnother successful season for our corp.

I marched along with the dear Cadets, not as a musician but as a little kid from St, Nick's, in the then-annual Holy Name parades the war-year 40's in Passaic, Now, so many years removed, my grandson, Ian Olofson, is in the drumline of the Concord, California Blue Devils. It's been an unbroken line of music from the maroon and gold to the blue and black. Love you all. Play loud.

I would think because of his creation of the Holy Name Cadet / Garfield Cadet Alumni Corp. still active after quite a few years. More so for his excellent solo playing in 60 and 61. A great horn player then, and still an great active lead horn player with the Skyliners Alumni for many years. Congratulations to my dear friend. Proud of you. To get a nomination is a great honor.\n\nDate:\n\nJan-09-2014\n\nRemote User:\n\nowen (scotty)mcgarry\n\nComments\n\n\"Happy New Year to all \"\n\nDate:\n\nNov-22-2013\n\nRemote User:\n\nJoseph Triola\n\nComments\n\nMr. Davidson, The Garfield Cadets closed their 1962, American Legion National Championship show with Maria, and the same \"there's a place for us\" segment, which was used to end their 1961 and 1962 regular season concert music, i.e., Tonight. You can listen to Tonight on the 1961 VFW Nationals album, and the 1962, An Evening With the Corps, at Carnegie Hall album; both albums can be purchased from Fleetwood Records, Drum and Bugle Corps on-line archive. I believe that the 1962 American Legion Nationals album is also available.\n\nDate:\n\nNov-11-2013\n\nRemote User:\n\nGil Davidson\n\nComments\n\nWould someone tell me what year did The Cadets Play \"Maria & Tonight\" as their closer.\n\nDate:\n\nNov-02-2013\n\nRemote User:\n\nLiz Hausler Ouimet\n\nComments\n\nMy father was a member of the Cadets back in the late 30's early forties. His name was Alfred Hausler. He played either bugle or trombone. I had a pic of him in his uniform, but alas a family member took it. He passed in 1985 and I wanted to share his memories with his four grown grandchildren who never met him. Would there be any pictures or news articles from that time ? Liz, We do not have a photo archive, but I will post your request on Facebook on The Cadets' page. Hopefully another Cadet from that era will be able to assist you. There are a number of Cadets who marched the late 30s who might have some information for you. Good luck in your search.\n\nDate:\n\nSep-25-2013\n\nRemote User:\n\nDavid Zins. 1981-82 contra bass\n\nComments\n\nNice to see alumni activities. Keep up the great work!

I write this note with a very heavy heart because a great Cavalier is currently gravely ill. He is bravely fighting the terrible disease that took the life of our own great Cadet, Michael Welch. Most of you probably don't know Bruce, or have ever seen him up on the podium directing our friends, The Cavaliers. Bruce was drum major of the green machine in 1959- 1960. I am one of the lucky ones who did see him front his corps with his majestic stature. He wore a black uniform (this was during the Cavalier's satin blouse era), and a long white sash that made him look twice as tall as the eiffel tower. I did not know Bruce personally. I did however recognize what a unique and powerful symbol of the activity he so proudly represented. I admired him then. I admire him now. Unfortunately, like many others from his era, time has taken its' toll. He is ill. Today a group of Holy Name Alumni sent him a card to let him know he is remembered, he mattered, and he is still admired and respected. Bruce's wife has advised a fellow FMM of The Cavaliers that Bruce's birthday is coming up, and that it would mean a great deal to him if cards began arriving to show that drum corps friends are forever. If you would like to join in this salute to a great drum corps symbol you can send your cards or words of encouragement to Bruce Tietgen, 218 North Fourth St. West Dundee, Illinois 60118. Let's make this birthday his best ever.\n\nDate:\n\nApr-16-2012\n\nRemote User:\n\nGeorge King\n\nComments\n\nThe next rehearsal of the alumni corps will be this Thursday April 19 at the Garfield VFW on Outwater Lane from 7:00 to 9:00 pm.

(EDITOR'S NOTE: This terrible disease that took from us our own Cadet Michael Welch continues to ravage the good and the brave. I personally remember Bruce from my Cadet marching years. He was a towering figure in his black uniform with white sash, and a friendly and always classy adversary much admired by The Cadets of the 1950s-60).

Father Jim was the priest who has been saying the Hall of Fame memorial Mass on the DCA weekend for the last few years up in Rochester. Although he never played in a drum corps, he was a huge fan. He lived near Roosevelt Stadium and used to watch the Dream Contests when he was growing up. I believe he became associated with the Cadets. He was a very nice man and told some great stories. I always enjoyed the Mass at the Rochester Plaza right before the Alumni Show. There were people from several corps in attendance including Garfield and Sky. You might want to pass this along if they haven't already heard. (Editor's Note: Father Jim was not only a long-time friend of The Cadets, but an inspirational icon who personally spoke to The Cadets on many occasions. He was loved and he will be missed.

I am an avid follower of the cadets, and it is my staunch belief that you guy's 2011 show was the best in marching history(ever). I love the split drumline/corp demons/angels thing. I listen and have all the all access videos and the drumline vids. I even managed to find out who you were so I could ask you something. What exact sticks did you guys (the snareline) use besides the Colin McNutts? Were they the AV10 MS1 or MS2s? And where did you guys get the cool shiny metallic reflective tape? I have some too, but I don;t think it's the same kind. Thanks, nathaniel Brusch.

A group of us thought it might be nice for the Alumni to secure a table or two at this very special event and big part of our history. There is no pressure to attend. We thought by attending it would be a nice representation of our group of Alumni. I am sending this to my group of friends and then any of you who wish to pass it along to your friends, please feel free to do so. The information is below. You can send your check ($60 pp) directly to Greg Cinzio's Mom (make out to Most Holy Name Church), at 378 MacArthur Ave., Garfield, NJ 07026, but please email me and let me know if you will be attending so I can keep track of the # of people for the table / tables.

Our next rehearsal will be on Thursday March 8 at the Garfield VFW on Outwater Lane from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. Thank you all for a job well done at last Saturday's show in Hasbrouck Heights. Get well wishes to Walt Taormina who has been very ill and was unable to make the show. As of today Walt said he is begining to feel better, so that is encouraging news. We all missed you Walt. Hurry up and get well ! A big thanks to ex-Cadet Drum Major Jim Messina who did a wonderful job conducting the corps at the show. Three cheers for Andy Swiderski and Dan O'Reilly coming all the way up from South Carolina and Washington DC to do the show. Even further thanks to the 1969 Girls who were in attendance with their support and to cheer us on. Special thanks to John Urspruch Sr. and Jr., Jim Stanko and Rocky Carbone for joining in to tighten up the horn line. It was great to see Fabian Izsa at the show.

I thought perhaps our readers might be interested in George's report on last Tuesdays luncheon. By the way, ALL are welcome to join the group anytime you might be in the area) Now, from George: It was a leaner than usual turnout yesterday with some of our regular attendees faces missing. ( Bart, Dave, Marie and Tommy A. ) As always the pizza personally designed by Jim D'Amico with \" the works \" was as good as ever. The talk was about Whitney Houston's death, the grammy's, rotten movies on TV and some sports. Also Jim Russo's upcoming operation and soloist Kurt Hawkins taking a year off from the Cabs. Doug Tenis, looking as trim as ever, was overjoyed when I suggested suitable replacements in Pat Vazquez and Gene Marotta. Walt Taormina brought his lovely wife Alice along, and she added a hugh helping of class and dignity to our sometimes raucus group. Even Iggy showed up for 20 minutes and had the floor for the entire length of his visit. We were all disappointed when he left so early for a business meeting. Hope you all have a good day, see you next Tuesday. Please don't forget the Alumni Corps is performing at the Skyliners show on Sat. afternoon Feb. 25 at the Hasbrouck Hts. VFW.

Rip joined Archer-Epler in 1950, while his association with the Audubon Bon-Bons dated back to 1938 when his parents founded that organization, and Rips association with \"his girls\" continued to the present, spanning nine decades. His contributions to the drum and bugle corps activity are staggering - I can honestly say that I don't know anyone else who had a bigger impact on so many facets of the activity. We have not yet heard about funeral arrangements, but will send out that information along as soon as we hear anything. In the meantime, please help us reach out to others who who may have known Rip. (Editor's note: The Cadet Alumni who knew and remember Rip extend our most sincere sympathy to his many friends, his family, and to a corps we all admired very much, the famous Audubon Bon Bons. May he rest in peace).\n\nDate:\n\nFeb-14-2012\n\nRemote User:\n\nDave Shaw 50-58\n\nComments\n\nCan anyone provide us with the status of Jim Mennhardt (early 50s Cadet)?

Set the GPS for South Mountain Middle School, 709 West Emmaus Ave, Allentown, Pa. 18103 - we'll see you there! The following alumni have indicated that they will be in attendance: Cindi DeVivo Greg Cinzio George King (tentative) Bill McCullum Ken Shedosky Jack Day Dave Shaw The plan is to arrive in Allentown by noon so we have time to set up a small display in the cafeteria. When the kids come in on their lunch break we can jump around informally from table to table introducing ourselves, asking their names, instrument, if they're enjoying themselves; and of course to answer any questions they might have relative to the alumni. If Eric would like someone from the group to say a few words Cindi will handle that. You will not be able to hear them play in ensemble (that happens on Sunday), but you will be able to listen to various sections rehearsing around the school. Any alumni (and marching Cadets) in the area on either Saturday or Sunday are welcome to be a part of this show of support to our newest young Cadets.

The pic of the color guard in shorts (on the website) is good. But, you don't show a shot of the FULL CORPS in the shorts. Would any Cadet alumni have a picture (best if a field shot) from 1958, with the shorts uniforms?

Comparing ole school drum corp, with DCI drum corp is like comparing a 69 Camaro to a 2011 Camaro. The bottom line is. The 69 Camaro was great. Nice body lines. Great running engines. Cool. Dynamite, just like the drum corps back in the day. Then there is the 2011 Camaro. Also great. Very nice body lines. Great running engine. Cool Dynamite , just like the DCI corps out there in 2011. You can compare them, but the bottom line is the horn lines were great, back in the day, and the horn lines are great-er, now in 2011. Spoken like a true horn player, thats all that I know. The horn lines of the DCI Corps in 2011 were just plain awesome. I think the crowds at the shows this year would agree. Oh and one more thought, the 2011 Camaro, I am sure has alot more engineering and technolgy in it , than the 69 Camaro, even though, and awesome ride. Congratulations Cadets 2011.We are all proud.

Everything in life changes from the clothes we wear to the music on the radio to the foods we eat. The change is not always for the best--e.g \"New\" Coke--but it cannot be stopped. Drum corps were once a way to explore and revel in patriotism. The military influence was obvious in the \"American section\" and the obligatory \"Presentation of the colors.\" But the world around drum corps was becoming less and less enamored of all things military--the ongoing war in Viet Nam was tearing at the very fabric of America, and patriotic activities were becoming less and less popular. Color presentations were shortened reflecting the general climate. In addition the influence of both the American Legion and the VFW had become burdensome with clear favoritism seen on a recurring basis. The rules and requirements of these two organizations caused stagnation in the activity. It was inevitable that a revolution would turn drum corps on its ear. It is now 40 years later and the changes continue. And in order for the activity to remain relevant there will be changes continually until 40 years from now. The past always looks better through the filter of 40 years--you really did look fab in that mini skirt!--we are all beginning to sound like our parents \"we walked to school all 15 miles up hill in six feet of snow.\" Sorry, my fellow oldsters, it's time to put on your big kid panties (or diapers) and deal! Get over it--it's not coming back--we are not traveling by horse and buggy, we're using cars that can be started from a distance, that wake us when we nod off, and that park themselves. And we are seeing drum corps with beautiful music, strange drills, and odd scoring--but it's still our maroon, and so we are all Cadets--FHNSAB...\n\nDate:\n\nSep-08-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nRick Marino 66-71\n\nComments\n\nTo me Drum corps of the old days were the best. Marching in the 60's & 70's, company fronts, high leg lifts, inspection, same uniforms. That is it. Although today is more \"entertainment and show,\" I miss the old style. Put a disc from the old days in your car,turn up the volume and you feel like you are back there. Todays' music for the most part is boring to me and does not have the marches we had.. Just my opinion.....FHNSAB (DS- Yes, the old days were good and we were good as well...but time passes, things change, and if we want our corps to continue to offer to young people what it offered to us, we have to be able to separate yesterdays memories from today's realities. I do understand and respect your viewpoint though. Sometimes, as we get older, change seems to challenge the comfort of our memories. Today's Cadets live in a different world than we lived in though, and our support or lack of it might make the difference between whether the inheritors of our corps, present and future, have the opportunities to make their own memories. Some of us, I guess, can enjoy both what we remember and what we see now, while for others it is more difficult or even impossible. All of us, however, whatever our feelings on yesterdays drum corps versus today's drum corps, share at least one thing. Our love for OUR CORPS, OUR CADETS, and hopefully we will not allow stylistic preferences to separate our past from our present. For 77 years we have all been bound together by our history, our heritage, and our values. Let's keep that bond strong and alive.

Hawthorne Caballero Alumni Drum Corps\n\nDate:\n\nSep-07-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nJoanne Borck\n\nComments\n\nHi Holy Name Cadets. I am Joanne Borck, and I wrote the piece my father-in-law, Dave Borck, has shared with you. I marched in the '60s in a small Illinois corps, the Saint Alexis Vikings, and during that time corps was my life. I lived to march. My husband, Bruce Borck, marched with Norwood Park Imperials (Illinois), and yes I married the cutest brother. Our daughter sold souvies. Our son marched with Phantom Regiment and later joined me to march with the Royal Aires reunion corps. Yes, I am one of those fortunate people who got to do it again and march not only as an adult, but I marched with my son. I have done most of it, bus mom, cook truck, nurse, and sewing crew. My family made plumes out of boas in our garage and if you look there are a few feathers still floating about. There is no part of corps that is easy but that is not why we do it. I cannot explain why we chose to love something that was tough, and the same goes for the kids that do it now. I just know that it helped make me who I am today and taught me how to set goals and achieve them and work with just about anyone. It teaches the same things now. When you meet someone who has marched, no matter what age they are, there is an instant shared bond because we just know what it takes to do corps. Thank you for all the years of wonderful music and marching you have given to the world.\n\nDate:\n\nSep-07-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nJohn Day 64-68\n\nComments\n\nInteresting viewpoint.

I think the proudest moment for us all is when we see the corps in the traditional uniform with Holy Name patches coming down the street with flags waving and drum majors out front in gold trim. Anything they do after that doesn't matter. The one thing that binds us together for all the 77 years is the uniform because it is the one constant in the entire equation. It is the initial visual effect and tradition that gets us all. I can recall a few years ago in Hawthorne when the corps appeared at the reviewing stand. There wasn't a dry eye in the house ( the corps hadn't even done anything yet ) and when I uttered these words, \" absolutely magnificent \" you should have heard the comments from the people standing near me. \" You got that right \", \" Amen brother \", \" now that's drum corps \" and other words to that effect. So I will personally do all I can to get the hard heads to be more involved in our activity so the can see for themselves that magnificence that we speak about. Thanks for all you do to keep the maroon blood flowing.\n\nDate:\n\nSep-07-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nRobert O'Connor 64\n\nComments\n\nGood story, and correct. What old drum corps was then, it was then. The modern stuff has evolved to what it is today - like it or not. Each generation of ' drum and bugle corps ' can only compare itself within its time, at least in my opinion. While I do not follow today's DCI participants closely, what I have seen of it, in snippets on youTube or at some related event in person, I can honestly say that the musicianship displayed by these groups is stellar to what it was in the days I participated. It's not that we weren't good, because we were and truly laid the groundwork for drum corps' evolution just as each succeeding generation does, but we could not compete with today's ' Class A ' groups. The marching percussion sections are fantastic, and the ' pit ' sections are phenomenal. The horn playing is as though it has come from an orchestral foundation rather than a military-type background patterned after WWI military bands. While there are certain parts of modern corps that I personally am not in agreement with, I can say I am astounded when I see the field movement by these groups while they maintain musical control, and create the emotional feeling that matches the theme presentation by that group. It's a wonderful atmosphere to be part of, a fulfilling activity that gives the greatest satifaction and just so much more I will not even attempt to add here because anyone who has been involved with it, or is still in it today, truly knows.\n\nDate:\n\nSep-07-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nBob Philhower 62-65\n\nComments\n\nDave, Like yourself I marched back in the early 60�s with the Cadets. Even up to this day I have to hear the same �flak� from various fellow Cadets (I marched with), and fellow competitors about how this current �state of the art� is not real drum corps. That is �bovine scatology� at its highest���.Yes. back then we had as much energy, zeal, enthusiasm, competitive fire and passion as the young men and women have today. But today, these young Cadets have much more talent for the �state of the art� programs being designed and arranged than we did. THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE�������������.EACH YEAR THE ACTIVITY GET BETTER AND BETTER. That is progress my fellow alumni. Hopefully one of these days, some of my friends �get it�.\n\nDate:\n\nSep-07-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nAl Perugini '68\n\nComments\n\nHi Dave I don�t always make it through all of your emails, but I did this time. It was really an excellent letter about Drum Corps of different generations and it really reflected my feelings about the activity. I have always felt that changes in the activity are not always what I have done, but I have accepted them with little complaint because I do feel that the activity must be regulated by the participants of the activity. It�s that simple. I find that after more than 40 years of following the activity I am rarely disappointed. Maybe it is the changes that have kept my interest throughout the years� The people who turn out the best are the people who make the best out of the way things turn out!\n\nDate:\n\nSep-07-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nDave Borck, Norwood Park Imperials\n\nComments\n\nI received this yesterday from a good friend who marched with The Norwood Park Imperials (Illinois) right around the same time I was marching with The Cadets. I thought I would share it with my fellow maroon and gold alumni. DS REAL DRUM CORPS - ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE9-5-2011 \"First, a story from an RARC (Royal Aires Alumni Corps) member: Several weeks after DCI in 2002, I was at work and talking with the mother of a patient. Somehow we got on the subject of Madison and she said she had just been there for DCI. I asked if she had been at semi-finals and saw RA and she had and enjoyed it. Well, her dad had been there too and had marched in the '40s in drum corps. In fact, he was sitting in the lounge and she wanted me to go talk with him. So away I went, very full of myself because here was a 70-something year old man and I am just betting the Royal Aires Alumni Corps had given him the thrill of his life. WELL, WRONG! When I started talking to him about seeing the real way drum corps should have been, like back in the perfect time of the 50s and 60s, he looked at me like I was crazy! He said we knew nothing of REAL drum corps with TRUE MILITARY MARCHING and REAL INSPECTION! We were the ones who started ruining the whole thing! Wow, I never looked at it that way before. I thought when I had marched, drum corps was at its peak of greatness. His comments gave me a whole new perspective on what we did. In this old drum corps' member's eyes, Truman Crawford was a 'traitor' to old drum corps and 'he moved us along the path to ruination!' The truth I guess is: EVERY drum corps generation feels that way about THEIR era � and that the new drum corps isn�t �real� drum corps. SO, what IS drum corps?? Drum Corps is passion, sweat, tears, triumph, defeat, hard work, laughter, 'one more time and get it right'. It puts you into situations that you never dreamed of and you think you'll never survive, but not only do you survive ...you thrive and grow. It gives you the ability to face anything that comes your way for the rest of your life because you 'did' drum corps and you can pull out that last reserve you didn't even know you had and face whatever is out there. Drum corps gives you the chance to learn what true passion is for something you love. How you cannot wait for the weekend to go to camp or practice and see all those people again, even some you might absolutely hate but learn to work with to put the show on the field. Drum corps gives you friends for life, who have seen you when you aren�t at your best, but are still your friends anyway. There is no other feeling like standing on the field in those moments before you start your show, whether it is on a starting line or in the middle of the field, and are ready to enter that magic world of the drill and the music and the passion one more time. So, do not talk of how much better we were �. as it is not the field programs, the drill, bugles, drums and dancing or even an American Flag section that makes it drum corps. It is you and me and those who went before us and our sons and daughters and those who come after us that make it drum corps. Drum corps is a living thing, an activity that evolves like everything else. I am proud of what my part was in drum corps in the 60s and 2000s. I am also proud of being a traveler with a corps and sewing, nursing and working the cook truck. I loved every minute of it - even when I questioned some of the crazy stuff I saw. Drum Corps is US! \" Written by Joanne Sunko Borck who marched flag with the St. Alexis Vikings (Bensenville, Illinois) in the mid-60s, and later marched in the Royal Aires' Reunion Corps (RARC) in 2002-2003. Her (deceased) husband, Bruce, marched baritone in the Norwood Park Imperials (Illinois) in the 1960s, and their son, Colin, marched baritone in the Phantom Regiment (1999-2001), later also marching in the RARC. Our thanks to Joanne for auithorizing us to share her thoughts with The Cadets' Alumni. It might be added that both our corps hold the color maroon in particular reverence.\n\nDate:\n\nSep-02-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nDavid Borck, Imperials\n\nComments\n\nRegardless of your political leanings, remember to FLY THE FLAG on Sept. 11 to honor and remember the innocent victims of this horrible terror attack, as well as our dedicated troops.

A VIEW FROM BOTH SIDES: As an alumnus of the Garfield Cadets, working as their seamstress for the past 4-5 years and after spending a great amount of time this summer with the Cavaliers working on their uniforms, I consider myself one lucky gal to be associated with both corps.... As I stood in the tunnel below Lucas Oil Stadium I witnessed the Cadets pass by the Cavaliers as they entered the field for their finals appearance. As soon as the first Cadet passed the applause started...by each and every one of our Cavaliers, and their staff, and management, and volunteers. Then it got louder and louder. They yelled, they clapped, they stomped their feet for these young men and women, wishing them great success on this night. The Cavies stood side by side cheering and yelling for them as they passed by in the traditional Cadet form. It was loud, it was gracious, it was class on every level. On the outside the Cadets held true to thier traditions of not breaking into smiles or even acknowledging the accolades being bestowed upon them at the moment, But don't be fooled by this, because as one of them, a Cadet through and through, I shed tears of pride for my new Cavalier family and was humbled that they would show such raw, unadultered compassion and excitement for their fellow competitors, The Cadets. They felt it too...I know they did. It was impossible not to. I am proud to be a Cadet, and I am just as proud to be welcomed into the Cavalier family. Splooie.... For Holy Name Shall Always Be.

While we had hoped to be banging it out for tenths of a point at the very end and come up with the right performance at Finals to win it ourselves, it was not to be this year. However, we are also as proud of the 2011 Cavaliers as you are of your 2011 Cadets, and for the same, and right, reasons. Throughout this year, the marching members of our two corps represented our legacies with effort, grace, and class that was an example to all of us who sometimes forget that the competition is secondary to the long term value provided to these young men and women. The Cadets staff and design team are also to be congratulated for a magnificent and entertaining show and for preparing the corps so remarkably well. Enjoy the well-earned fruits of your victory with our best wishes and friendship. Then get back to work and support your corps any way you can, because we'll be working to beat you again in 2012!! I would never presume to use your fraternity's sign off, \"FHNSAB\", but please accept a respectful \"SPLOOIE!\" in your honor from ours.

As a alum of the Chicago Cavaliers 1961- 1966 , of course I wanted my guys to win ! The next best thing was \"The Cadets\"winning ! I saw the second competition this year and loved \"The Cadets\" Angels and Demons show ! I picked them to win it all at that time ! Lets hope that our 2 corps reach the level of camaraderie we enjoyed in the 50s and 60s it was a great time for 2 great corps.

Her name is Jenny Corujo. Jenny informed me that her dad had a major stroke in the left side of his brain, causing paralysis to his right arm and unable to speak. At times he is aware of his surroundings and gives signs letting all to know he does not want to hooked up with tubes. At present he has pneumonia which for a person in his state can be fatal. Movement and antibiotics are the key to fight this condition and Jenny is fighting the medical staff, at this hospital, to follow through. She will convey to Bob that all of drum corps who know of his exploits in this activity, are praying for his well being.

And we all know that the Cavaliers/Cadets friendship stretches back more than 50 years now and will continue for years to come.

My Dad had a major stroke on May 22 and is currently in the hospital. I felt it was important to let you all know and hope that you will pass this information onto any of his friends and fellow Cadets. At this point he is unable to speak or walk and there is no prognosis. Feel free to contact either Bobby Jr or myself for updates. (Editor's Note: Bob is a much beloved and respected Cadet from the late 40s and early 50s. After aging out of The Cadets he went on to a storied career teaching and marching with many corps, and publishing a number of drum corps publications, most notably Eastern Review and Heritage Magazine. He is also well know for the huge collection of drum corps memorabilia he has amassed. It was always his hope to open a drum corps museum so all these artifacts could be on permanent display as a tribute to the activity he loved so passionately. Please keep Bob in your thoughts and prayers as he battles this demon.

George Hilger sent me a letter (which I cherish) telling me that it was due in large part to my example that he became a teacher. I am of course unworthy of that. He would have been successful at whatever he did. He was that kind of guy. I remember Karen Kopacz as an intelligent and sweet young woman, and Vic Rolleri as a dedicated and most reliable Cadet who always did his job and generously helped others with theirs. Mike Dewey was as solid as they come and could make me laugh on cue, and Randy Meyers was one of the most likable students I ever encountered. Todd Paton and Louie Reda were in the corps during difficult times and both represent the best of the best, Cadets who knew the meaning of teamwork and what it could achieve. John Van Dillewyn and his corpsmates were the reason the Cadets finally climbed into contention in the modern DCI era. All of the people on your list made a major contribution to the drum corps, but they would have done so for any community of which they had been a part. May their memories be honored. I will be there in spirit, believe me.

Sadly, Pete told me that it is only a matter of time. Pete marched with me in the Cadets snare line in 1978, 1979, and 1980 and then in 1981 while I was an instructor. He then went on to win the DCI Snare Individual World Championship in 1984. Pete's dad spent his life playing trumpet with some of the great big bands in the swing era and beyond. He has a love for life and music that defied his age (I believe he played professionally well into his 80's). Pete and his mom and dad were always there for the Cadets, offering us their food, home, and swimming pool no matter when or how many came before and after rehearsals. They always made us feel like we were part of the family. So I ask all of you to keep Pete's dad and his family in your thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.FHNSAB...\n\nDate:\n\nMar-21-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nSteven & Donna Chirichella\n\nComments\n\nOur Thoughts and Prayers go out to Lou Silvestri,Bill Riding and for Cindi's Husband John for a speedy recovery!..FHNSAB...Steven and Gerald.\n\nDate:\n\nMar-19-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nPatrick Zampetti 77-84\n\nComments\n\nSorry to hear of Cindi's husbands condition.

Silvestri.(59-67). As he was residing in Florida , I thought it odd that it would appear here. Actually unknown to me, Louis had lived and worked in the Flemington area for a good number of years, was the service manager at the auto dealer where my wife took her vehicle and was very involved in community / civic activities. His passing is particularly sad to me,in that as we were able to see one another at the 75th, he had been, for a good number of years, hiding here in plain sight; and as I have been on a number of search committees , this was a missed opportunity for me to reach out and share many tales of our Cadet era and to have him join our alumni activities.

Cindi asked me to let you know what is going on with her husband, John, since she is spending every minute possible at the hospital and cannot be in contact with you directly. After going for some tests because of chest pains, John was immediately admitted into Wayne�s St. Joseph�s Hospital. The test results showed that two of John�s arteries were 100% blocked and a third was 60% blocked. He is being moved some time today to Paterson�s St. Joseph�s Hospital and is scheduled for triple-bypass surgery tomorrow. The doctors feel that had this problem not been found in the way it was, John would have had a massive heart attack / stroke before too long and we probably would have lost him (or at the very least, he would have had major heart damage)�..SO as difficult as this situation is, Cindi & John feel this was really a blessing in disguise. When he gets home, he will be out of commission for about 8 weeks and Cindi will take him back and forth to Cardiac Rehab during that time. I know Cindi would appreciate if you would keep John in your prayers, and I will shoot you updates as I learn of any. Stay well my friends, FHNSAB...

I first met Bill as a rookie in the early 60's. His spirit and energy were incredible. He brought that same enthusiasm to the 2007 reunion in Atlantic City. He was very excited as we planned the Alumni Corp's participation for the 75th in the Meadowlands. Bill was an exceptional Cadet and we will miss him dearly.

'Just happened to call Linda this morning to check on his condition when I learned of his passing. Bill was a fighter, always with the positive attitude. We worked together on the 75th Decades Committee for the decade of the 1960's and I can tell you all that he was so driven for our reunion to succeed. Then of all things, he began his first bout with the horrible cancer and had to miss the evnt. I feel so fortunate to have spent some time with he and Tre in San Antonio over the years. May his soul rest in peace with all of our departed Cadet Brothers and Sisters..

As we prepared for that great event, Bill and I started communicating via Email and Phone. After the first phone call it was as if I knew Bill all my life. I was very much looking forward to drumming with Bill during the anniversary weekend. Bill notified me of his condition but assured me that he was going to be fine. The Cadet was pouring out this great, positive attitude and I was convinced he would beat the odds. Bill was called home to be with many other Cadets that have gone before him. He was a great Cadet,a great person who will be missed in our hearts.

It has been emotionally bruising as these events seem to be recurring without pause, allowing for a period of reflection on our relationships with our departed cadets I want to update our cadet family as to the condition of our Cadet brother, Bill Ridings '60-'63 His wife, Linda, has informed me that his condition has taken a definitive turn for the worse. His chances of recovering are not favorable and his status is now day to day. I have just taken a phone call from Linda who advised me that Bill passed from this earth Sat. 2/19/2011 at 1PM. His attitude had been up-beat and determined since his first surgery in the spring of 2009. He could not travel to be with us for the 75th Anniversary activities, so he couldn't perform with the Cadets Alumni and the Cadets en-masse. But he and Linda were thrilled to see both the 2009 and 2010 shows in Huston. The coming days will be difficult for his family and we should, again, offer our thoughts and prayers .. Linda Ridings will contact us as to the funeral /service arrangements. She asks that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made, in Bill's name, to the Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps.

It is somewhat both positive and disappointing.The cancer in Bill's throat and lymph glands seems arrested and may be in remission. The side effects of the chemo and radiation have resulted in breathing difficulties and a weakened condition. The feeding tube has been left in place and a breathing vent opened in his throat. He has been moved to intensive care as he has developed pneumonia and is on antibotics and sedatives. When Linda visited the other morning , the nurse said she could not get him to wake. Linda tapped his hands and face with no response. At a loss for what to do next, she opened her cell phone and connected with U-Tube and by luck, found the Cadets 2010 show. When she put the phone next to Bill's ear. He slowly began to smile and eventually opened his eyes. Linda wants all of us to know how much he loves the Cadets. and his drum clinic in Houston. Bill is fighting with every ounce of energy he can muster and we should give him another round of prayer and communications of support. If you need his address pls contact me. 908-832--7149 Kshedosky76@embarqmail.com FHNSAB\n\nDate:\n\nFeb-08-2011\n\nRemote User:\n\nCharlie Sydoryk\n\nComments\n\nLois, I am deeply sorry for your loss, knew and remember Bill well as I do you, June and Jim.

My husband, William E. Donnelly, was a proud member of The Cadets (french horn) from 1960 - 1966. He passed away on April 18, 1998, and it would be an honor to have his name placed in memoriam.

Jim Messina, our drum major in the early 70s and a continually generous contributor to and supporter of The Cadets over the years, lost his beloved Mom, Stella on January 28. For those of you not fortunate enough to have known Mrs. Messina, she was a loving, caring person with an extraordinary gift for enriching the lives of everyone she touched. We extend our most sincere condolences to Jim, his Dad, his brothers and sisters, and all his family. Visiting hours will be Tuesday, Feb. 1, 5-8 PM, at Mastapeter Funeral Home, 270 Atlantic City Blvd, Bayville, NJ, with a prayer service at 7:30 PM. The funeral will be held on Wednesday at 9:30 AM at the funeral home, with burial to follow at 11:30 AM in the Brigadier General William C.

Herbie was one of those people you come across in life who was a true gentleman; always had a smile and was a joy to be with. I had the honor and pleasure to have marched with him in the '50's and he was one of the special \"Boy's of '57\". Many a time Herbie would stay at my home when we came home late from a contest and we would lie awake for a long time re-living the contest of the night before. Yes, he was special alright and I'm sure that he too, like other cadets who have gone before him, are once again part of a great corps in God's kingdom. I will miss Herbie. I will miss him very much.

Herb was one great Cadet and his loss leaves an enormous gap in our ranks. I marched with Herb in the mid 50s and always looked up to him as someone to emulate. He left the corps in 1955, I think. But when we got together for the 50th anniversary of our 1957 National Championship, Herb was one of the first to sign up. Then, when we celebrated the corps' 75th anniversary all the Bonin brothers - Joe, Rudy and Herb - attended this historic event. Through all these years, Herb has remained the gentleman-Cadet we all knew and loved. May he rest in peace.
