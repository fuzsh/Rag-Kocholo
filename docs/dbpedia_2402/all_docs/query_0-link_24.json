Contains plates 1-63 printed in color half-tone on both sides of the leaves and included in pagination. Also, text maps 1-8 as well as distribution maps for all species. There are a few unnumbered diagrammatic text line drawings as well.\n\nThis monumental work covers 487 species of which 135 are considered “vagrants”.\n\nThis entire work was inspired by the Birds of the Western Palearctic (BWP,1977-1994). Although Africa offers three times as many species as the western palearctic, there is far less literature concerning them and many fewer potential authors with the requisite experience amongst whom to choose. Leslie Brown, the original inspiring spirit, died before the appearance of the first volume. After his death, a committee approach was necessitated and progress was slow.\n\nThe work is much more attractive than BWP, in my view for three reasons: first, a single artist, Martin Woodcock, was responsible for all the colored plates after the first volume; second, all plates subsequent to those in the first volume have white backgrounds; third, despite the use of different firms in their production, the plates are unusually well printed. In volume III, Woodcock remarks (p. xiv) on the difficulty of designing plates with the constraints imposed by having to figure so many individuals in such a small space. He writes \"Overall, I have aimed for plates which are aesthetically pleasing.\" He has succeeded, whereas aesthetic quality seems not to have been a consideration for the plates in BWP.\n\nThe text of this work is, of necessity, not nearly so comprehensive as that in BWP. A shocking omission amongst the many measurements provided for each species is that of simple length. Of course, this can be gleaned from the colored illustration, all of which are referenced to a length standard shown with the facing letter-press.\n\nVolume VIII was produced by a different group of authors, artists and craftspeople almost a decade after volume VII and is somewhat more detailed.\n\nAlbin, Eleazer\n\nA Natural History of Birds Illustrated With a Hundred and one (104, 101) Copper Plates, Curiously Engraven from the Life. Published by the Author Eleazer Albin, and carefully colour’d by his Daughter and Self, from the Originals, drawn from the live Birds Three volumes. 4to. 28 x 23 cm. Later (19th century) half tan calf with red morocco lettering pieces on spine. London, printed for the author and sold by William Innys, John Clarke and John Brindley. Contains 306 plates drawn and colored by Albin and his daughter, Elizabeth and engraved by Henry Fletcher and others. This copy also contains, as a frontispiece for each volume, three hand-colored impressions of a plate entitled “Mites” engraved by J. Scotin from Albin’s Natural History of Spiders (1736) that shows Albin on horseback surrounded by various insects. That frontispiece for volume III is signed “Eleazer Albin 1739” directly under the portrait. It is interesting that Christine Jackson, in her book, Bird Etchings (1985), reproduces this very picture (page 64). Her example, taken from the work in which it originally appeared, is also signed, but as “ E Albin” ,and in the lower right hand corner of the plate rather than under the portrait.\n\n(Vol. I.), 1731.

It was published at just about the same time as Catesby’s work on North America so the two are generally considered the first ornithological color plate books although, of course, specially colored copies of Belon and Gessner had been prepared for important recipients as early as the middle of the 16th century.\n\nThis copy is an example of the rare first issue distinguished by the dates 1731 and 1734 on the first two volumes; by the listing of his daughter as colorist on the title page in all three volumes; by the absence of Derham’s name on the title page of all three volumes and by the inked conversion of II to III in volume III. The first volume lists only 86 subscribers accounting for 89 copies. The first two volumes of the later issue are dated 1838 and the third either 1838 or 1840.\n\nThe work describes and illustrates both British and exotic birds, the single criterion seeming to be that Albin could get an example to draw. The artistry and engraving is quite poor in this work although Elizabeth Albin’s plates are not too bad and far superior to those by her father. Albin seems to have accepted anything that was told to him about these birds and it is easy to understand why the much more serious George Edwards referred to this work with such exasperation.\n\nThis work is of little ornithological or artistic merit but is a pleasure to possess!\n\nMengel, #33; Trinity, p. 12; Wood, p. 184; Yale, p. 5; Zimmer, p. 3.

In addition to this second edition, at least five more were published after 1750 and at least one of those was pirated and anonymous. Although most copies are uncolored, colored examples of the various editions are occasionally seen.\n\nThe work describes the habits, song and best ways of securing and maintaining various song birds not all of which were native to England. The pictures and descriptions are different from those in Albin's quarto, three volume colored work,\"A Natural History of Birds\" (1731-1738).\n\nAlthough it is quite a stretch, this book, based on the title, might be considered a precursor for the two important classes of later ornithological works, the monograph and the regional treatise.\n\nMengel, #37.

It combines the elements of a field guide and a handbook in a pocket-sized work on a subject that had heretofore not been cohesively assembled. The systematic text presents overviews of the various families, keys to identification of the species, and distributions and descriptions including measurements of the individual species. There are also annotations concerning life histories. The pictures are mainly fine photographs selected from the oeuvre of various outstanding ornithological photographers of the era. However, there are also 11 plates after drawings by the author who was a competent artist. The selection of what families of birds to include is debatable. The author decided to list and describe every member of the families that he selected.\n\nThe title page states \"With 140 Illustrations\". It is not clear how the publishers arrived at this figure.\n\nThis book was reprinted many times and a second edition was published in 1954.

Ali, the first Indian ornithologist of international status, had previously written a fine little book on Indian Hill Birds (1949) beautifully illustrated by David Reid-Henry's father, G. M. Henry. The present work may be considered a small handbook of Himalayan ornithology. The accounts of the various species include: original citation; field characters; status and habitat; distribution in Sikkim; general habits; nesting; racial characteristics and measurements. Almost 500 species are described with brief mention of nearly 100 others. The birds are all referenced to \"FBI\" (Fauna of British India, presumably the eight-volume edition by Baker [1922-1930]). The 17 very good colored plates depict about 150 species.\n\nAli was later to write, with S.

The work began with five charts depicting 181 common Indian birds prepared by the Bombay Society of Natural History in 1928. In the mid 1930s, these charts were cut up and the plates corresponding to the various species were mounted in an album and distributed as such without text. An example of the album is in my collection. Ali was then recruited to write the text. He covered size, field characters, distribution, habits and nesting for the 181 species as well as contributing essays on various aspects of ornithology as indicated in the description above.\n\nAli subsequently became a prolific author and the leading figure of Indian ornithology. In the preface to this work, he laments what he considers the poor quality of the illustrations which he attributes to the fact that the artists, H. N. Wandrekkar and K. B. Sawedekar, were not acquainted with natural history. He selected his own illustrators for the numerous later editions. The book is comparable in its influence not only to the Peterson guide (1934) but also to Neville Cayley's What Bird is That? (1931) and Austin Roberts's Birds of South Africa (1940). All these books have gone through numerous editions and impressions and have remained in print for many years.

Also contains three full-pages of anatomical line diagrams and end paper maps.\n\nIt was never Ali's intention to make this work an all inclusive field guide. Rather, it is a kind of layman's handbook of common Indian birds. The original edition of 1941 described and illustrated 181 species. More were included with subsequent editions and colored plates were completely redone and continually added. In the original edition, Ali started with crows and ended with grebes, the standard classification sequence at the time. New species were added at the end in later editions and the sequence was no longer completely systematic. Standard classification became reversed (grebes-crows) shortly before the present edition and Ali paid lip service to this by listing the new sequence in the preliminaries but maintaining the old one in the text. He apparently wasn't ready to reorganize the book completely.\n\nThis book has been in print for well over half a century now and has reached its deserved status as a classic and important contribution to Indian ornithology. Although it deals with a limited number of species, it provides comprehensive accounts for each. The illustrations evolved over the years and those for this edition by J. Pirani and J.

The area covered is increased to include Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh which are the components of the \"Eastern Himalayas\", a bio-geographical unit. The abbreviated accounts for 536 species encompass size, field characters, status, habitat, food and call. Of the colored plates, 21 were created by talented Indian artists for this volume. The other 16 were published previously in Birds of Sikkim. The figures of plate 14 of this work were excised from plate 25 of the Birds of Sikkim and placed on a gray instead of cinnamon background.

A good example is the important list of birds that is found in Jeremy Belknap's History of New Hampshire (1784). Mrs. Allen brings this type of material together and supplies biographies of some of the early visitors and American (native-born and naturalized) naturalists such as William Barton, John Abbot and Benjamin Smith Barton.

I was unaware of Belknap's list which was carefully done and must rank as amongst the earliest important contributions to ornithology printed in America. Allen's list was the first covering the entire state since Belknap's.\n\nAllen covers the distribution and status of 286 species and is well written and authoritative.

The preceding reports were by James Tanner on the Ivory-billed Woodpecker and by Allen on the Roseate Spoonbill. The fate of the Whooping Crane since that era, still rare but increasing, fortunately resembles more closely that of the now common Spoonbill than that of the probably extinct Woodpecker. These Research Reports were meticulous works of scholarship and of field investigation. They drew national attention to the plights of the species they described and to the field of conservation in general. This book was written before the discovery of the principal breeding ground of the Whooping Crane in Wood Buffalo Park, northern Alberta.\n\nTrinity, p. 14.

Contains 828 uncolored text illustrations numbered in Arabic, some full-page.\n\nThis is an important work since it is the first, and still only significant comprehensive national ornithology (exclusive perhaps of Egypt) written in Arabic. The author, obviously highly knowledgeable and internationally connected, was Professor of Zoology and Director of the Iraq Natural History Institute at the University of Baghdad.\n\nWhat an effort the production of this book must have been! The colored plates were adapted from Peterson's Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe . Nine were printed by the Ar-Rabitta Press while the other twelve were done in England and the difference is marked. The paper is very thin and of low quality, and the text illustrations are very poorly printed. Some of them are from the Peterson Guide, others are from Dresser's Birds of Europe of which the University must have possessed a copy, and many others are line sketches which indicate that their artist was familiar with the species. The work contains a fairly extensive introduction to general ornithology and then a systematic treatment of more than 300 species, most of which are illustrated.\n\nThe three parts are bound in the usual western order, i. e. I, II, III left to right. However, the pagination in each is Arabic i. e. right to left save for the English sections of each, which are at the end (i. e. the left) but which are themselves bound left to right. These English sections comprise four leaves in volume I (foreword, acknowledgments, note about plates, table of contents); two leaves in volume two (acknowledgments, contents, list of colored plates) and 17 pages (15 paginated in English) for volume III as follows: (2, title, blank); 1, preface; 3, contents, systematic list; 4, list of colored plates; 5, bibliography; 8, index of English names; 12, index of scientific names.\n\nTrinity, p. 15.

It characterizes European geese in a very detailed and meticulous manner. Accounts of forms include: Latin, English, Russian, Russian dialect and Samoyed (where appropriate), French and German names; synonymy/ bibliography; description of every plumage stage; a series of measurements; a section on bill and teeth; geographical distribution; nesting and habits with egg measurements.\n\nThe illustrations are very attractive. Sushkin's frontispiece tableau of many geese in a Siberian setting projects a special ambiance and Frohawk's more detailed pictures also provide enough background to make them more than just portraits. The chromolithography by the Moscow firm of Kusnerev has its own pleasing character.\n\nAlpheraky also wrote a monograph on Eurasian ducks that was published (ca.1902) in Russian only.

Cameroon on the mainland. Correia collected on the first three of these islands during 1928-29 and Amadon here describes and analyzes the collection publicly for the first time. He supplements the information with additional material from the literature concerning Annobon, the smallest, and much the least significant of the islands ornithologically. There is quite a high degree of avian endemicity on these islands, particularly Principe and Saô tomé, even including four endemic genera. The present work is an excellent overview and synthesis of a very interesting isolated avifauna.\n\nThis article appeared in the Bulleting of the American Museum of Natural History and its presence in a library is usually determined by whether the library subscribes to the Bulletin. I believe that the format of the Bulletin was changed from \"octavo\" to the present \"quarto\" or \"large octavo\" slightly before this article was published.

The present important work of scholarship represents the first systematic treatment devoted solely to this exceptionally interesting group.\n\nAmadon served in the Hawaiian Islands during World War II when he did the field work for this monograph which was submitted as his thesis for the Ph. D. degree at Cornell. He spent his entire career at the American Museum of Natural History where he eventually became Curator of Ornithology.\n\nThis work appeared in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History and is not usually listed by libraries as an individual publication even though the articles making up the various volumes were issued separately. The Bulletin had a notoriously small print run until shortly after World War II at around the time of this publication.\n\nAmuchastegui, Axel (1921-)\n\nPajaros del Mundo 31 x 21.0 Hand-made paper in quarto configuration. Three volumes. Buckram-backed pictorial boards, patterned endpapers. Buenos Aires, Codex S. A., 1957\n\nEach volume with the same eccentric pagination i. e. 53 ll as follows: (viii)13-106[107-109(110). i, half-title; iii, title; iv, copyright and publication data; v, editorial note; vii, contents; 13, text; 109, publication data. Each volume contains colored plates (Láminas) I-XXIV printed on recto only with both sides included in pagination. Volume I has the general title printed in blue and has the volume title Pájaros de Sudamérica; volume II has the general title printed in red and the volume title Pájaros y el amor; volume III has the general title printed in green and the volume title Pájaros y el hogar. Volume III in this copy has a duplicate of plate XXIV and thus one more leaf than the other volumes. Volume I is inscribed on the title page to Frank A. James and signed by Amuchastegui.\n\nThis is an unusual, rare and beautiful book. The illustrations for the first volume appeared originally in Pájaros Sudaméricanos by Gollan published by Codex in 1949. Those for volume II in Selva Andrade's Love Life of the Birds published by Codex in 1952. The texts in the present volumes are entirely different from those which previously accompanied the colored plates. The material in volume III is all entirely new.\n\nThe plates are exceptionally beautiful and show Amuchastegui's development as an artist. Those in the first volume are devoted exclusively to neotropical birds and demonstrate a great influence of Descourtilz in the composition of the birds amongst colorful plants. The pictures in the second and third volumes exhibit more attention to the shapes of the birds and a more complex and interesting background. Although many of the plates were published before, their reproduction here was somewhat different. For example, in comparing the plates of volume I with those in Pájaros Sudaméricanos I noted the following: Amuchastegui's signature could be discerned only on the later plates; the style of lettering of the plate legends, and the legends themselves, are not identical; the colored figures are glossier, the reds are more intense, and the blues contain more green in the later book.\n\nThe text comprises a very brief description and life history and summarizes the distribution of each species. It is not clear whether it was written by Amuchastegui or by an anonymous author hired by the publisher.\n\nThis three-volume set is extremely rare. I found a copy only after looking for 17 years. Laid loosely into volume I is a letter I received from a bookseller in Buenos Aires from whom I solicited either a copy or information about it. After considerable search, he concluded \"I do not believe that this book exists…\". There is a copy in the Rare Book Collection of the American Museum of Natural History.

The brightly colored birds include tanagers, cotingas, cardinals and some spectacular flycatchers as well as woodpeckers and a kingfisher. The placement amongst decorative accompanying plants is reminiscent of the work of Descourtilz. The accompanying text seems to comprise a description with distribution and life history. There is also a general discussion of the families represented.\n\nThe work is supposed to be part of a series about South American birds but I haven't seen or heard of any other books from the series.\n\nThis is a special edition with an extra suite of plates.

The plates are printed somewhat differently from the previous volumes in color half-tone on semi-glossy paper. The birds depicted include; Verreaux's Eagle; Spoonbill; Ross' Touraco; White-headed Buffalo Weaver; and Golden-breasted Starling.\n\nThe paintings of Amuchástegui are often characterized by incredibly meticulous detail with elements such as tree trunks, rocks, even blades of grass, painted as though entire landscapes, and with much attention directed at light and shadow. One of my favorites is the spoonbill in this volume. The entire large surface is replete with detail, the bill of the bird in this case painted as though a whole landscape. Blades of marsh grass cast shadows on those below them. Amuchástegui was also a master at projecting texture and one can feel the plumage of the spoonbill in this picture. In the plate showing the white-headed buffalo weavers, the nests are so closely rendered that one wonders how long he must have spent in creating them.\n\nArtists specializing in natural history rarely have the luxury of publishing works that contain pictures done solely as works of art. Two outstanding examples that come to mind are Joseph Wolf's Zoological Sketches ((1861-1867) and Edouard Traviès' Les Oiseaux les plus remarquables..(ca. 1855). I feel that Amuchágui's works are artistically comparable to those although plates printed in color half-tone suffer by comparison with lithographs colored or finished by hand. It is interesting that Amuchastegui's three large folio volumes were not immediately purchased by the major libraries and, although at least the first two were out of print, did not fetch high auction prices at the end of the 20th century.\n\nListed by AMNH.

The plates are printed on matte paper in color half-tone with what seem to be occasional small areas of gravure for the lighter colors. The first 50 of the 300 copies of this work that were printed for distribution contained an original watercolor by Amuchástegui and 24 of these were reproduced for a smaller trade volume (30.1 cm), entitled Studies of Birds and Mammals of South America(1967) so there is no overlap between that book and this one.\n\nThe plates in this work, unlike those in the two subsequent folios, were printed by van Leer and figured subjects and foliage from the artist's native continent. These factors render this one, in my view, the most attractive of the three. The depicted birds are: Argentine Eagle; Rosy-bill; Bay-winged Cowbird; Blue-and-yellow Macaw; Urraca Jay; Andean Cock-of-the-rock; Toco Toucan; Ornate Hawk eagle; Red-headed Black Woodpecker; Blue-and-yellow Tanager; Black-necked Swan.\n\nThis folio edition unlisted by AMNH, Cornell, Harvard, Trinity, Yale.\n\nAmuchástegui, Axel (1921-)(text by Helmut Sick [1910-])\n\nStudies of / birds and mammals / of South America 30.5 x 23.0 cm.

Helmut Sick, a leading authority on Brazilian birds, has provided interesting and informative accompanying essays. The limited quarto edition of this work differed by its quarter-morocco binding and by the presence of a chromolithographic frontispiece of an ocelot.\n\nIn 1963, Rainbird and Amuchastegui produced a beautiful limited edition folio, Some birds and mammals of South America. That work contained 17 printed colored plates, none of which overlapped with these. However, 50 of the 300 copies were embellished with an original painting and the nicely printed plates here were reproduced from those.\n\nListed by AMNH, Cornell, Harvard, Trinity and Yale.\n\nAmuchastegui, Axel (1921-) (text by Sick, Helmut [1910-])\n\nStudies of / Birds and Mammals / of South America 30.1 x 22.1 cm.

A large, limited edition folio entitled Some Birds and Mammals of South America resulted. That large format work was produced by George Rainbird and finely printed in color by L. Van Leer of Amsterdam, and bound by Zaehnsdorf. It contained a colored frontispiece and 16 colored plates. Of the 300 copies, 50 also contained an original painting by the artist. The present book was an offshoot of the large folio. However, none of its 16 bird or eight mammal pictures overlap with those in the big book and its text is different. I believe that the 24 are taken from the 50 original paintings that were present in special copies.\n\nMost copies of the present work are of the trade edition, not specially bound and lacking the frontispiece. They were published by Murray in London and Van Nostrand in Princeton. This special de luxe edition of the quarto was bound identically to the folio, although allegedly by a different binder (Wigmore Bindery of London) which was perhaps associated with Zaehnsdorf. The frontispiece in this copy is of an ocelot. There is a different picture of an ocelot amongst the standard 24 plates. The frontispiece is highly unusual for a modern book in that it is not photomechanically reproduced and appears to be a chromolithograph. I do not know whether the same or another frontispiece is present in other de luxe copies of this book. There is no indication in this example of the number of copies of the de luxe edition. I believe I have read somewhere that there were 1000.\n\nAmuchastegui's pictures are exceptionally beautiful and the superbly produced frontispiece is something very special. The text is by a very distinguished Brazilian ornithologist but is basically a vehicle for the art work.\n\nThe standard edition of this work is present in the AMNH, BM(NH), Cornell, Harvard, Smithsonian, Trinity and Yale libraries. However, these libraries do not contain either the de luxe quarto or the large folio works.\n\n(Amuchasegui, Axel [1921-]), Santos Gollan, José, Lopez, Rogilio B.\n\nPajaros Sudamericanos Hand-made paper in quarto configuration. 311 x 228 mm.

The plates are printed in half-tone on recto only, accompanied by unprinted tissue guards, and are included in the pagination; Also contains abut 13 decorative initial letters, three printed in red.\n\nAmuchastequi illustrated a children's book about birds in 1947 as well, but this work represents his first serious contribution to ornithological iconography. The plates, printed on mat paper, are very impressive. They were subsequently reprinted and included with a different text as one of three volumes in Amuchastegui's own Pajoros del Mundo (1959).\n\nThe present work is said to be part of a series on ornithology of the Americas but this is the only volume of that series of which I have ever heard. It covers a sampling of families of striking birds such as Cotingas and Tanagers found in South America, mostly Passerine but also including Woodpeckers and Kingfishers. While not systematic, it does provide descriptions and accurate information about the various families and their genera and species.\n\nThis work is present in the libraries of AMNH, Cornell, Harvard, Trinity and Yale.\n\nAnderson, Walter (Inglis) (1903-1965)\n\nBirds 29.0 x 22.9 cm.

Contains 128 (114 colored) unnumbered illustrations of which 74 are full-page, 18 are more than full-page. Most are reproductions of paintings by Anderson and all are included in pagination.\n\nWalter Anderson, a Mississippian, was an artist and designer of pottery and furniture who has posthumously achieved high recognition for his artistry. He was subject to intermittent mental illness requiring hospitalization and spent much of his life living apart from his family in a tiny shack on an island off the coast of Mississippi. After his death, his family recovered an enormous trove of his artwork in the shack and the recovered pictures became the subject of various retrospectives. The present work was put together and written by his daughter. The identification of depicted birds was done by another member of the family and is often inacurate.\n\nApparently Anderson was always especially interested in birds and at one point, before publication of the Peterson guide, was advised by an ornithologist friend to prepare paintings for a guide to bird identification. A few of these pictures are included in the book to indicate that Anderson was capable of drawing birds in a very accurate and traditional way. Most of the pictures, however, are representations of the way he saw the birds as part of nature. The figures of the birds in these pictures remind me of the letters and numbers that are integrated into patterns in tests for color blindness. One can scarcely discern the outlines of the birds so closely are they integrated with the patterns of their surroundings. These are extraordinarily impressionistic tableaux, quite unlike anything I have ever seen. Their originality is comparable to that of the oeuvre of Charles Harper although there in no resemblance of the styles and presentations of the two artists.\n\nPresent at Cornell, Library of Congress, NYPL and Yale.

Edinburgh.\n\nThis is the extracted ornithological section from a work describing an important expedition to a remote and mountainous part of Chinese Asia. Only 250 copies of the complete work were printed. Anderson was the listed author of the main work as well as the author of the ornithological part. 233 Species of birds are listed with synonymy and with the sex, date and location of each collected specimen. There is also usually a brief commentary concerning the abundance, distribution and, if warranted, special aspects of the appearance, behaviour or life history. The author claims that only one species, Arachnethra edeni, is described for the first time in this work but this bird has subsequently been lumped with the Purple Sunbird as Nectarinia asiatica. A few other specimens collected by the expedition were described elsewhere as new, but these also were later grouped with species that had been described before.\n\nThe colored autolithographs by Keulemans are excellent. I believe that they are the only examples of his work, and perhaps the only ornithological illustrations, that were produced by Banks & Co. of Edinburgh.\n\nMengel, 33; Trinity, p. 16; Wood, p. 192; Yale, p. 9; Zimmer, p. 9.\n\nAndersson, C.

He died in the field and was in the midst of writing an avifauna of the region. His friend Gurney, a noted expert on raptors, used the unfinished manuscript and unpublished notes to assemble, organize and edit this important and uncommon regional work which includes synonymy, distribution, habits and descriptions of fresh parts for 428 species. The plates were lithographed by Mintern Bros. The originals for three of them were drawn by Andersson to illustrate anatomical aspects of the Bat Hawk, at that time thought to be a new species distinct from the Asian form described a decade earlier by Westerman.\n\nTrinity, p. 16; Wood, p. 192; Yale, p. 9; Zimmer, p. 9.\n\nAndrade, Carlos Selva (Translated by Clark, Herbert M., illustrations by Amuchastegui, Axel [1921-])\n\nLove Life of the Birds Hand-made paper in folio configuration. 31.0 x 22.7 cm.

In general, it deals with the sexuality of birds at a very esoteric level using many allusions to classical literature, some scientific, some literary. Subjects treated include, among others: leks, displays, bowers, vocalization, monogamy, polygamy and polyandry.\n\nHowever, it is not for the written content that this book is known. Rather, it is because for readers outside of Argentina it provided an introduction to the outstanding ornithological art of Axel Amuchastegui whose only previous published illustrations had appeared in Pajaros Sudamericanos (1947), an uncommon work, little known outside of Argentina. These pictures present the birds in characteristic and attractive settings. They combine ornithological detail and accuracy with beautiful composition and color and Codex did an excellent job in their reproduction. Amuchastegui subsequently published three beautiful folios on some birds and mammals of South America (1966), North America (1971), and Africa (1979) and I believe that his pictures of birds (and mammals) are amongst the finest that were done in the 20th century.\n\nTrinity, p. 216; Yale, p. 260; both listed under Selva Andrade.\n\nAndré, E.\n\nA Naturalist in the Guianas 23 x 15.5 cm.

Guyana. There is some ornithological material and colored plates by Keulemans of the Royal Flycatcher and the Paradise Tanager.\n\nThe original edition of this work was issued simultaneously in 1904 in London and New York. The London issue, as described by Mengel and Zimmer, contained “London, Smith, Elder & Co. Waterloo Place” without any New York imprint on the title leaf, whereas this presumed New York issue is as described above and, in addition, contains “Scribners” in gilt at the base of the spine. Wood gives neither pagination nor place of publication for his copy although he describes it as “a scarce and interesting work”. The Yale catalogue mistakenly lists a 1902 London edition published by T. Nelson & Sons that is 17 cm and contains 382 pages. This refers actually to the “popular “ edition which was published in 1912 not 1902. It is interesting, also, that the advertisement leaf in the present first edition, New York issue, is for Smith, Elder books not for those of Scribners.\n\nMengel, #72; Wood, p. 192; Yale, p. 9; Zimmer, p. 10.\n\nAndrews, Charles W.(illiam)(1866-1924) (ornithology by Sharpe, R.[ichard]Bowdler[1842-1909])\n\nA monograph / of Christmas Island / (Indian Ocean): / physical features / and / geology / with descriptions of / the fauna and flora / by numerous contributors 21.7 x 14.0 cm.

The four colored plates of birds were drawn by J. G. Keulemans, the two of mammals by J. Smit.\n\nChristmas Island is about 190 miles due south of the western extremity of Java. Its birds were first investigated in 1887. This volume is a comprehensive description of the geology and natural history of the island based on a ten-month stay by Andrews during 1897 and 1898. Andrews collected 29 species of birds including some migrants that had not been recorded there before but he did not add any endemic forms to those (approximately eight) already known. The ornithological section (pp. 37-50) is by Richard Bowdler Sharpe and describes the collection. Four species are shown in chromolithographs by Mintern Bros. after Keulemans including the odd local fulvous colored tropic bird which was then considered a full species but is now regarded as a race of the white-tailed tropic-bird, Phaethon lepturus. The three non-ornithological chromolithographs depict a bat and a mouse by Mintern Bros. after J. Smit and various moths by West, Newman after E. C. Knight. Other uncolored lithographs printed by West, Newman after various artists illustrate reptiles, shells and molluscs, lepidoptera, flora and fossils.\n\nWood, p. 193.
