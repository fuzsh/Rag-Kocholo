        "text": "THE school year has just begun, which means parents across Melbourne will have begun studying how to get their children into the right school next year, or even beyond 2018.\n\nWith so much competition and so much at stake, buyer’s advocate and director at Wakelin Property Advisory Paul Nugent said this was one subject where it was important to do your homework.\n\n“The 2017 school year may have just started, but some parents are already looking ahead to 2018 — they are on the hunt for a year seven position for their child in a quality public school,” Mr Nugent said.\n\n“Competition for top performing secondary schools is fierce with the best chance of acceptance going to those who reside within the school’s catchment zone.”\n\nHe said that with some in the past having tried to bluff their way in, it was now routine for a school to demand to see utility bills, rate notices or even a 12-month lease if an applicant is renting.\n\nHe added that for those looking to have the best chance at being in the zone, the first step was to pin down the exact boundaries of the catchment area.\n\n“Not all properties on the one street may be included,” Mr Nugent warned. “It is essential that you do your own homework. While a property may be advertised as being close to a school, double check the zone with the school itself to confirm.”\n\nHomes that are in a school zone will also likely be subject to increased demand, Mr Nugent said. “Real Estate Institute of Victoria data from 2016 shows that some houses within catchments zones are fetching close to a $600,000 premium compared to those just outside,” he noted.\n\nThis meant that doing your homework required you also know what the premium for a particular school zone should be, according to Mr Nugent. “If you are planning to buy in a catchment zone, be aware of this additional competition from parents eager to provide their children with the best public education available,” he said.\n\nIt was also important to keep track of deadlines for applications relating to the upcoming year and to ensure any purchase was finalised within this time frame.\n\n“While the higher cost of a school zone property may hurt the hip pocket initially, this approach may well be financially savvy,” Mr Nugent added. “As well as obtaining a high-quality education without school fees, the property is likely to deliver good capital growth and more than return the additional cost in time.”\n\nThose considering renting as a path into a catchment will also need to plan ahead.\n\n“Not surprisingly, these rental properties are in great demand, so apply early,” he said.\n\nAs for investors, school zone investing was not a failsafe strategy, according to Mr Nugent.\n\nA school’s popularity could wane in time, he noted. “Ultimately it is important to look for property that is well serviced by amenities in a suburb with more than one drawcard,” he advised.\n\nFletchers Maroondah’s Luke Simms said in the Maroondah region school zones have had a noticeable effect on property sales.\n\n“School zones have definitely pushed the market up in the area,” Mr Simms said.\n\nHe added that strong price growth in Ringwood East was in part due to the area being home to one of the state’s top public schools.\n\n“We believe a lot of the growth in that area is due to Ringwood Secondary College,” he said.\n\nMr Simms said other sought-after schools, both public and private, were Good Shepherd, Lutheran Primary School, Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar and Norwood Secondary College.\n\nHe said buyers in the area saw value in paying more for homes zoned for well-regarded schools.\n\n“People will pay up to 15 to 20 per cent more than what they need to in order to get into school zones,” he said."
