        "text": "Athletics\n\nPalmyra High School Panthers had some great seasons in basketball and great athletes that earned medals at the Illinois State Track Meet. We believe the boys of PHS competed in baseball as well. School fight song is one item we are seeking at this time.\n\nFootball\n\nOne fascinating fact about the program was that it holds claim to one of the first night games in Illinois H.S. Football history. This happened in October 20, 1920. Palmyra hosted Mt. Olive in what was supposed to be a regular day game. However, the Mt. Olive squad allrived very late. The people had a solution to this, though. They took their automobiles and pointed their headlights toward the playing field. With the newly \"lit\" field, the two teams played with Palmyra putting a load of points up against the unfortunate team: 98-0.\n\nThe following team records were sent to us by Ken Mayes:\n\n1914 5 - 3 Coach Ogg\n\n1915 8 - 1 Macoupin County Champs Coach Ogg\n\n1916 5 - 4 Coach Ogg\n\n1917 4 - 4 Coach Ogg\n\n1918 No team, World War I in Progress\n\n1919 3 - 5 - 1 Coach Huffords\n\n1920 3 - 6 Coach Huffords\n\n1921 5 - 5 - 1 Coach Huffords\n\n1922 3 - 6 Coach Huffords\n\n1923 3 - 5 - 1 Coach Bramley\n\n1924 2 - 6 - 1 Coach Parcel\n\n1925 3 - 6 Coach C E Reischauer\n\n1926 8 - 1 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1927 8 - 2 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1928 5 - 4 - 1 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1929 5 - 4 - 1 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1930 6 - 4 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1931 2 - 7 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1932 2 - 6 - 1 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1933 1 - 6 - 1 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1934 2 - 6 - 1 Coach Joe Wylder\n\n1935 1 - 7 Football Discontinued Coach Joe Wylder\n\nafter this season\n\nBoys Basketball\n\nThe Palmyra boys basketball team had some nice seasons in the 1940s.
