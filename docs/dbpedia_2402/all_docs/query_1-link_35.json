        "text": "\"I did not know that my Lewis was a poet,\" said Anna; and one of the sad smiles she gave only to her roses passed over her features as she laid the paper next her heart.\n\nSlowly her reason began to gather; large tears rolled down her cheeks, and sighs, so deep that her frame shook with the effort, rose from her breast.\n\nShe spoke little; but her eyes were upraised, her hands clasped as if in prayer; and from this moment a secret communication seemed established between herself and Heaven.\n\nShe never smiled again. I am wrong - the night before her death she beckoned me to her, and taking from her bosom Lewis's stanzas, she showed me his withered rose in the paper's folds, and smiled.\n\nPage 155\n\nDeath had little to do to crush her shattered frame; he checked the last blue veins that lingered on her temple; he severed the almost imperceptible clasp with which she retained my hand; he cast a film more dense over her azure eye, which, with its last look, sought mine; and the throbbings of one of the softest hearts that ever ached under the burden of earth's woes were still.\n\nShe only whispered -\n\n\"I wish I could have shared his lonesome grave.\"\n\nThat midsummer's sun shone on hers.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE PINE-LAND VILLAGE.\n\n\"Death is beautiful - not as the end of man, not as the extinction of a noble and wonderful being, not as the final result and close of existence, but beautiful in its time, as the momentary passage to a fairer land; the extrication of the soul from its temporary dwelling-place; the resting of the no longer needed body; the free ascent of the delivered spirit to its new abode.\" - G. PUTNAM.\n\nIT is a solemn thing when death passes over our homes. Let who will depart, whether it be the infant, whose faint eye scarcely opens on the creation which it is so soon to leave, or the old man, whose orbs, weary and dim, are closed on familiar objects, or the maiden, with the rose bursting on her cheek, and her careless step treading lightly on the earth which is so soon to receive her, or the young man, with vigorous frame and active mind, looking thoughtfully into the mysterious and the true; whether it be the father, towards whom his family turn like flowers to the sunbeam, or a mother, whose smile, like daylight, was scarcely felt in its constancy until it was withdrawn; no matter which of life's varied relations is broken; no matter if it even be a stranger, who, without claim but that of hospitality, comes to your threshold and gives up his lonely spirit to God's\n\nPage 156\n\nhigher household, away from his own hearth-stone, still it is death - there is its stillness - its shroud - its fixed and pale repose; the voice tells not its wants - the eye knows not. We bend over the stiffened form, and turn away, and come not again, for it is death; perchance we lift the bloodless hand, or smooth the straying hair - but only once, for it is death, and we are chilled. We tread lightly - yet the dead hear not. Why does the boy stop his whistle as he passes that door? Why does the housemaid quicken her step and shade her eyes just there as from a phantom?\n\nIs there no way to render death less dark and unlovely? Were it for me to draw its image, the fleshless bone and the darkened scull should no longer image forth its horrors, nor the hourglass and the scythe be its emblems. It should be sad, for death is sad - not horrible. It should be dressed like night, with dark and flowing robes, and solemn, perhaps uncertain step; but, like night, with the new moon lighting up her sombre mantle, and distant stars, images of far-off life, looking down on her brow. Sin is unlovely - is monstrous; but death should only be unlovely when allied with her.\n\nAnd yet I felt its bitterness. Anna was gone. My heart stretched forth its tendrils and they fell, unsupported by her sweet sympathy. Her voice, so gentle in its youthful joy, was hushed; her eye, so full of the deep revelations of love and truth, was closed for ever; her step, light as the motion of an elastic flower, was arrested; and thus it fares, one by one, with all whom we love: but it is well for us; \"the branches are lopped from the tree, that the trunk may fall more easily.\"\n\nI was sitting, a few evenings after Anna's death, in the piazza, musing on her fate. This had been a favourite spot and favourite hour with Duncan. Throwing aside books, he taught me from the great books of nature: he had anticipated such moments as the present for me; he had told me of the probability of crushed affections and blighted hopes. He drew morals from surround objects; for even from the vacancy and barrenness of a pine-land settlement, his mind extracted instruction - his\n\nPage 157\n\nrich mind, whose spiritual chymistry could convert earth's vapours into heaven-tinged clouds; and now those clouds, hidden to my eyes by the recent glare of worldly fashion, came rolling back in their mellowed brightness. Beautiful force of virtue, which, though sunk beneath life's horizon, throws up its rays long after its orb has disappeared! and let not the good spirits who labour on the ground of the human heart be discouraged; the seed will take root, some blessed words will shoot down into the soil of the affections, and spring up in after years.\n\nThere is something picturesque in the evening hour at a pine-land village. A few trees are cleared away, affording just sufficient room for a house, whose whitewashed palings contrast prettily with the dark hue of the pine; from ten to thirty of these constitute a village, where planters reside during the summer months. A fire is kindled at twilight, of brush or lightwood knots, near every house, which, while it drives away insects gives a cheerful illumination to the scene.\n\nThese lights had just begun to blaze, one by one, in the growing shadows of night, while the paler hue of summer lightning broke in fitful lustre between the trees. Here and there might be seen a negro, his dusky form in full relief against the glare of the blazing light; or young ones, dancing and singing around the fire, presenting grotesque images of thoughtless happiness; or a procession of neighbours, preceded by linkboys, passing for a festival or a religious service; while their cheerful human sounds broke pleasantly the song of the night-bird, or the unwearied talk of the winds in the pine-tops.\n\nAs I mused deeply, with my head resting on the window-sill, a string of Anna's guitar broke within. How trifles sometimes touch the soul! I lived an age in the little time until its awakened vibrations died away in silence; but they did die, and grief gathered up its unexhausted stores, and I wept.\n\nAn approaching step made me dry my tears, but they flowed again, for it was Marion's - he who had seen our Anna enthroned on love's temple, breathing the atmosphere of hope and joy.\n\nPage 158\n\nAnd Marion, God be thanked, destroyed not the precious lesson of affliction which the Father wisely sent for his untutored child; no light or careless word from him won me back to earth; the glow of religious thought was in his eye - a holy consolation in his reasoning. He drew me away from Anna's grave - from its loneliness and decay, but not to the world; not to that broken cistern, but to the spiritual fountain of Christian faith.\n\nLet young men be careful of woman's highest interests. In those moments of prepossession when her heart and mind instinctively turn to model themselves on his, whom God has made of stronger fabric, let him not sap those foundations of religious trust which may hereafter be dearer to him than her young loveliness, and which, when that loveliness has faded in the dust, will bloom and ripen in a better world.\n\nMarion breathed not a word of love or preference, but I felt elevated by his sympathy, by the thought that he considered me worthy of it; and when he departed that evening there was a rustling as of happy wings unfolding in my inmost heart, and I was comforted.\n\nBut still my spirits and health failed under the immediate influence of Anna's loss, and papa, believing that our retirement rather increased than softened my regrets, proposed a change to Sullivan's Island. Springland was but too obnoxious to the common charge against pineland settlements, extreme dulness or extreme dissipation. There were there, as there are everywhere else, well-tempered minds preserving the equilibrium of virtue, but it is almost impossible to secure a community from dangerous habits in a territory, realizing in its monotony the satirical description of an American poet: -\n\n\"Where to the north - pine-trees in prospect rise,\n\nWhere to the south - pine-trees assail the skies,\n\nWhere to the east - pine-trees obstruct the view,\n\nWhere to the west - pine-trees for ever grew.\"\n\nThe planter misses the wide range of his fields, and his wife and daughters the bustle of the city. Happy they, under these circumstances, who shun, on one hand,\n\nPage 159\n\nthe unhallowed amusements of associated pleasure-hunters, and the chilling influence of seclusion on the other.\n\nHow often have I blessed my needle for rescuing me from the temptations which assail the other sex!\n\nBright and innocent little implement, whether plied over tasteful luxuries, or gaining the poor pittance of a day, thou art equally the friend of her whose visions tend to wander amid the regions of higher abstractions, and of her whose thoughts are pinned down to the tread-mill of thy minute progress. Quiet rescuer from clubs and midnight revels, amid the minor blessings of woman's lot, thou shalt not be forgotten! Still come, and let thy fairy wand shine on her; still lend an ambitious joy to the playthings of the girl; still move unconsciously under the glittering smile of the maiden planning thy triumphant results; still beguile the mother whose thought roves to her boy on the distant ocean, or the daughter watching by the sick-bed of one who has heretofore toiled for her; still sooth the long, dreary moments of faithful love; and, though a tear sometimes fall on thy shining point, it shall not gather the rust of despair, since employment is thy dower.\n\nPage 160\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nSULLIVAN'S ISLAND.\n\n\"Thus, thus the sunny day went by,\n\nAnd night came brooding o'er the seas;\n\nA thick cloud swarthed the distant sky,\n\nAnd hollow murmurs filed the breeze.\"\n\nS. G. GOODRICH.\n\n\"A whirling ocean now fills the wall\n\nOf the chystal heaven, and buries all;\n\nAnd I, cut off from the world, remain\n\nAlone with the terrible hurricane.\"\n\nBRYANT.\n\nTHERE are no two scenes more widely different than a pine-land settlement and Sullivan's Island. The hum of business or pleasure now sounds at the Cove, but the more remote part of it is lonely in the extreme. A plantation is solitary; shut out from the noise of the world, surrounded by a vast amphitheatre of trees, its occupants see little but the wide fields around, the graduated foliage in the distance, and the over-arching sky; but then the large negro family is there, claiming and giving, in a thousand ways, human recognition. A pine-land village is secluded; files of trees shut out there even the sky; the world is heard not; the resident rises to a monotonous routine, and sleeps but to rise for the same quiet duties, or thrice-told pleasures; but still the habitations cluster in comparative nearness; the night fire blazes cheerfully; and oh, how faithfully does kind neighbourhood come forth in sickness, and tell the sufferer he is not in solitude. But there is little to soften the loneliness of the more remote residences on Moultrieville. Our dwelling stood alone, on a sandy eminence, with the broad beach in the front distance, and wild myrtles scantily rising as a dwarf shrubbery behind. Nothing was to be heard but the dreamy dashing of the waves, or the curlew's cry;\n\nPage 161\n\nnothing seen but what the ocean offered - the porpoise raising its unwieldy form in the waters, the passing sail, whose distance rather adds to the feeling of separation from human ties, and the seabird winging its unwearied flight.\n\nYet in this solitude I breathed a free spiritual, as well as physical atmosphere. I communed with the winds, and the waves, and the stars, and they gave back answers to my heart, thrilling, yet sobering. It was a joy to stand on the beach, and see the setting sun with its glow of glory lighting up sky and sea; to note the stars, as day declined, marshalled in their shining courses, at first singly, then in countless numbers; to watch the lighthouse beacon, man's faint competitor with those higher watches; to see the young moon rising with faint crescent, beautiful as growing youth; to note its progress night by night, until it burst in silvery radiance, making the dark waves glorious. And it was a joy to feel in my inmost soul a capacity to appreciate what was great and fair, to rise in bright abstractions, and throw from me all that was earthly, and feel that my higher powers would thus brilliantly light up, when the mortal part should moulder in the grave; to clasp my hands in unuttered prayer, to weep tears of sacred happiness. This was the privilege of my new solitude, and my soul grew in the process; it was part of the heavenly training by which, I trust, God is leading me to a more spiritual existence. This is not romance; it is the feeling of youth, and will be understood by minds not yet fettered by the world.\n\nThere were other pleasures at the island not so elevating, but more social, and almost defying solitude. I loved to see my brothers and the young negroes revelling in the waves, as Rover, intoxicated with delight, now dashing into the water, now shaking his dripping sides, seemed to feel himself the monarch of the scene, while little Patsey, carried by her maumer, dipped her dimpled feet into the shallow wave; then, clinging to her nursed neck, uttered a cry, half fear, half joy; then grew more bold, until, with a shuddering delight, she permitted the\n\nPage 162\n\ncoming waves to dash her limbs, gleaming through the element like a rose-tinged shell.\n\nThen what joyous shouts went up from the beach from the boys' games, the skipping rope, the bounding ball, the kite, while I searched for shells, or wrote, in idle musings, names on the level sands, or rode on horseback on the sea-washed plain, where the fresh breeze in my face inspired health and spirits.\n\nBut life's pictures are not all sunny; clouds will gather, storms must rise, and whirlwinds sweep over our path.\n\nThere came occasionally from town to visit us an old military friend of my grandfather's. It was a great pleasure to us to hear Captain Hyam's stories, to stroll about the island, as he painted out scenes of historical interest; and it was a touching sight to see an old man, on that spot sacred to so many patriotic associations, leading the boys' young minds from their sports to their country's story.\n\nOne afternoon we strolled to the cove to observe the arrival of the packet-boats, bringing from the city their customary motley group. There were reclining invalids, with their eyes shooting a sudden brilliancy, as the sea-breeze swept over their languid brows; sickly infants, seizing the first relished morsel; the happy and healthy, who would fain add another tinge to a blooming cheek. There was the mechanic, generously recreating his industrious family, the professional man escaping from the stifling court-room, the chamber of disease, or the secluded study, to feel the Atlantic breeze, untainted by human breathing, and gaze on the clear heavens and unfettered sea. I will not enter on this innocent catalogue those whose motives are gross and impure, the sensualist and the gambler, who dare to sojourn where God's mercies rush by in purifying love, and whose stagnant souls are untouched with sensibility by the wave or the breeze.\n\nThe younger passengers, scattered in various parties, shouted in the fulness of excitement as they gained the front beach; shoes and stockings were doffed, pantaloons\n\nPage 163\n\nrolled up, and, followed by their coloured attendants, they sang and danced in the coming and retreating waves.\n\nHow happy were they all; true, there were no hills rising in magnificence to meet the sky; no sloping fields winding gracefully to the shore; no rocks stationed like guardians round the coast; but there was enough that was beautiful and glorious for the old, exciting and cheering to the young. Generous boys and gentle girls in innocent joy resorted there, gathered rough shells, and threw them in the dark waters; greeted their conscious dog as he came dripping, with some prize, from the surge; wrote sweet names on the beach; ran and shouted in careless laughter against the breeze, or mused on those thoughts which come even to childhood from the bounding sea.\n\nCaptain Hyam was one of the passengers, and our boys engaged him for a shooting ramble to the curlew-ground, while I wondered how they could have the heart to disturb the flight of the birds in their aerial processions, now mingling as if for consultation, now extending in a pencilled line, lengthening, until lost in the viewless air. I remonstrated against destroying them, and won my cause, by attaching to the captain's watch a riband, on which I had wrought, in gold letters, 28th June, 1776.\n\nOur good old friend consented to remain with us, and we lingered on the beach, so delicious in its coolness after a sultry day. Nature was as bright as our feelings. A few large, pillowy clouds rested beneath the heavens, softening, but not obscuring the declining autumnal sun; the city, with its spires, rose in the distance; the lighthouse, beautiful emblem of hope and safety, towered on one side; and on the other the main, with its level verdure, seemed like a fringe of green on the azure horizon. Pleasure-boats were darting from the cove, the rocking skiff of the fisherman lay easily on the waves, and the majestic merchantman passed through the channel with its freighted stores.\n\nSome there were who, on that day, had looked with prescient fear on the clouds and fancied evil, and the accustomed ear detected the roar of a distant swell upon the ocean.\n\nPage 164\n\nThe clouds rapidly deepened at twilight, and the wind rose, but we closed the shutters, and gathered round our evening lamp without alarm. As we sat chatting at the table, a sudden gust shook our dwelling, and a drizzling rain began to fall; it increased; in an hour it poured in torrents, and the building rocked like an infant's cradle. A sudden silence prevailed among our circle, and we spoke low, or uttered strong ejaculations. I was fearfully alarmed; and as each gust came, with its roaring accompaniment of angry waves, I could scarcely restrain my cry. I felt the blood rush to my heart; my eyes seemed starting from their sockets, and I covered them with my hands to shut out, if I could, the threat of nature.\n\nSuddenly the recollection of Charles Duncan's teachings of God in his providence came to my mind. I remembered how he had once gently drawn my hands from my eyes, and told me that Heaven's best messages were sometimes heralded by storms. I remembered this, and the spirit's prayer was awakened, and a trust in God followed like a brooding wing, spreading itself over my fluttering heart, and though I trembled, I was calm.\n\nA knocking at the door was heard in a pause of the wind, and two individuals hurried in drenched with rain.\n\n\"How fortunate,\" exclaimed one, advancing, and panting with his efforts, \"to find you. My friend and I were seeking his house in vain, and your piazza-light guided us here.\"\n\nIt was Marion, and for a while I forgot the storm. But it approached, and rose and rose like some living monster preparing itself for a death-struggle, until the waves lifted the piazza. It was no longer safe, and we looked abroad in desperation, while our voices could scarcely be heard amid the roar of the elements. Moving masses of ruins were seen floating on the white foam; beyond, all was intense darkness. Collecting the servants, we resolved to leave the house by the back entrance, as yet not reached by the tide, and attempt to gain the fort. Our dear little Patsey, still sleeping in the arms of her nurse Binah, a strong and active woman,\n\nPage 165\n\nwas in the centre of the group. The darkness seemed supernatural, and we soon approached a gully, when the tide was rushing on to intercept our way. For short time a shout, a word of encouragement, a faint jest had been heard, but this was now hushed; there was an awful pause, too, in the elements; it seemed the nature was preparing a nervous heave; and clinging to each other, we thought to die together. It came - the gale rushed with ten thousand voices, thundering on, roaring and raging over bursting waves; we clung to each other still more firmly, but we were parted as easily as gossamer tufts in the south winds of summer: One arm I still felt grasping mine with a nervous force, one voice was left to me, and it said, \"We must think of death - it is at hand; prayer is not new to us, my dear Miss Wilton; God will hear us now.\"\n\nWe groped in the darkness, but rather sought to return than advance, for we could see by the moving foam the water was before us. We reached a building, and ascended the steps; it was my own home, and no longer in danger, for the wind had changed, and to the wave had been said, Thus far shall ye go and no farther. By I felt bereaved and desolate; there stood the remnants of our evening meal; and the candles, lighted in so much mirth, glimmered dimly in the wind that still rushed through the crevices. I wept, I prayed, and the night passed by, oh, how slowly!\n\nThe morning rose, and the sun shone down on that scene of desolation. One servant never was found, but the other members of the family had been variously preserved. Some fishermen, at the early dawn, in ascertaining the fate of their craft, perceived one of their boats high on the sand, capsized, and resting on some timbers. They raised it, and there lay Patsey, our little cherub, wrapped in her nurse's apron, and sleeping in her arms.\n\nBut our venerable friend was gone. Amid the sad revelations of that day, his form was recognised, but his sleep was the sleep of death. Grasping his hickory cane, his gray hairs wet with surf, lay the veteran on the beach. We looked at him with tearful eyes; and as the\n\nPage 166\n\nsoldiers of the fort raised him in their arms, the sun shone on his watch-chain, and the date of 1776 renewed our tears.\n\nA mournful and respectful train wound its way, with military honours, by the curlew ground, to the myrtles; the muffled drum mingling with air and sea, and the minute guns with sad precision told the tread of death.\n\nFit was the burial. Let the worldling be laid amid the city's hum, let the babe and the maiden rest beneath the green turf, and flowers blossom over their grave, but the heroes of the South - where can they find a better monument than those hallowed sands, or a holier dirge than that which sweeps over the spot sacred to our early fame?\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nTHE PEDLER.\n\n\"Servant. - Oh, master, if you did but hear the pedler at the door!\n\nHe hath ribands of all colours of the rainbow; he has the prettiest\n\nlove-songs for maids!\n\n\"Autolicus. - And you shall pay well for 'em. Aside.\n\nWill you buy any tape,\n\nOr lace for your cape,\n\nMy dainty duck, my dear-a?\n\nAny silk and thread,\n\nAnd toys for your head\n\nOf the newest and fin'st wear-a?\n\nCome to the pedler;\n\nMoney's a meddler,\n\nThat doth utter all men's wear-a.\"\n\nWinter's Tale.\n\nROSELAND once more assumed an air of elegance and comfort; we resumed our old habits, brushed up and regilt like the portraits of my grandparents, which were again suspended from the walls; the friend was welcomed, the stranger sheltered. I must confess there was a little less ease than formerly, for everything was\n\nPage 167\n\nnew. Who has not in his life been checked and restrained by the constantly-recurring exclamations, uttered in a tone of tartness,\n\n\"My dear, take care of that paint! My love, don't touch those clean things! My sweet child, pick up those groundnut-shells! My darling, why will you let Rover track the clean floors?\"\n\nThis state of bondage to cleanliness lasted not long, however, at Roseland. Gradually the children were seen eating their sweet potatoes at all hours; the sight of Ben's powder-horn and fishing-tackle excited no nervous alarm; my music-books were allowed to be in angular instead of parallel lines, and I was permitted to romp out of the nursery with Patsey, while the house assumed that delicious position, where an air of general neatness prevails, without a slavish attention to minute wants, or a perpetual dread of doing or touching something wrong.\n\nI was amusing myself, one morning, by seeing Patsey's efforts to get her big toe into her mouth, as she lay upon the floor, for her figure was too rotund to admit of walking. Puckering up her red lips with as intense an interest as if the world depended on the effort, she at length succeeded, and smacked them with a flavorous relish. As I began to frolic with her, she showed her teeth, white as rice-grains, and her round, fresh laugh rang out in musical peals; at length I jumped over her. Binah, her nurse, caught me by the arm in anger, exclaiming,\n\n\"What for you ben walk over my child,* Miss Neely? Just go back same fashion, or my child an't gauin for grow no more agen.\"\n\nI was really obliged to skip back to pacify her, but I soon offended anew by snatching her from her nurse's arms through the open window, as I stood on the piazza.\n\n\"My lor, Miss Neely,\" cried her nurse, \"how you ben do sich a ting! Put Miss Patsey straight back; if you carry him trou one door fore you ben put 'em back, he just keep leetle so!\"\n\n* This appellation is constantly given by negro nurses to the white children under their care.\n\nPage 168\n\nIt would be interesting to know the origin of these and other superstitions. Perhaps they have some more rational beginning is dreamed of in our philosophy. No nurse at the South will allow a child to be carried to a looking-glass before it is a month old, and its infant sneeze must never be unanswered by \"God bless you.\"\n\nA little incident soon occurred to break the retirement of Roseland.\n\nEvery man has some peculiar taste or preference, and, I think, though papa dressed with great elegance, his was a decided love of his old clothes; his garments, like his friends, became dearer to him from their wear and tear in his service, and they were deposited successively in his dressing-room, though mamma thought them quite unfit for him. He averred that he required his old hunting-suits for accidents; his summer-jackets and vests, though faded, were the coolest in the world; his worm-eaten but warm roquelaure was admirable for riding about the fields, &c. In vain mamma represented the economy of cutting up some for the boys, and giving others to the servants; he would not consent, nor part with articles in which he said he felt at home. Often did mamma remonstrate against the dressing-room's looking like a haberdasher's shop; often did she take down a coat, hold it up to the light, and show him perforations that would have honoured New-Orleans or Waterloo; often, while Chloe was flogging the pantaloons, which ungallantly kicked in return, did she declare that it was a sin and a shame for her master to have such things in the house; still the anti-cherubic shapes accumulated on the nails and hooks, and were even considered as of sufficient importance to be preserved from the fire at the burning of Roseland.\n\nOur little circle about this time was animated by a visit from a pedler. As soon as he was perceived crossing the lawn with a large basket on his arm, and a bundle slung across a stick on his shoulder, a stir commenced in the house. Mamma assumed an air of importance and responsibility; I felt a pleasurable excitement; Chloe's and Flora's eyes twinkled with expectation;\n\nPage 169\n\nwhile, from different quarters, the house servants entered, standing with eyes and mouths silently open, as the pedler, after depositing his basket and deliberately untying his bundle, offered his goods to our inspection. He was a stout man, with a dark complexion, pitted with the smallpox, and spoke in a foreign accent. I confess that I yielded myself to the pleasure of purchasing some gewgaws, which I afterward gave to Flora, while mamma looked at the glass and plated ware.\n\n\"Ver sheap,\" said the pedler, following her eye, and taking up a pair of glass pitchers; \"only two dollars - sheap as dirt. If te lady hash any old closhes, it is petter as money.\"\n\nMamma took the pitchers in her hand with an inquisitorial air, balanced them, knocked them with her small knuckles - they rang as clear as a bell - examined the glass - there was not a flaw in it. Chloe went through the same process; they looked significantly at each other, nodded, set the pitchers on the slab, and gave a little approbatory cough.\n\n\"They are certainly very cheap,\" said mamma.\n\n\"They is, for true, my mistress,\" said Chloe, with solemnity, \"and more handsomer than Mrs. Whitney's that she gin six dollars for at Charleston.\"\n\n\"Chloe,\" said mamma, \"were not those pantaloons you were shaking to-day quite shrunk and worn out?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said she; \"and they dont fit no how. The last time the colonel wore them he seemed quite onrestless.\"\n\n\"Just step up,\" said her mistress, \"and bring them down; but stay - what did you say was the price of these candlesticks, sir?\"\n\n\"Tish only von dollars; but tish more sheaper for te old closhes. If te lady will get te old closhes, I will put in te pellows and te prush, and it ish more sheaper, too.\"\n\nChloe and mamma looked at each other, and raised their eyebrows.\n\n\"I will just step up and see those pantaloons,\" said mamma, in a consulting tone. \"It will be a mercy to\n\nPage 170\n\nthe colonel to clear out some of that rubbish. I am confident he can never wear the pantaloons again; they are rubbed in the knees, and require seating, and he never will wear seated pantaloons. These things are unusually cheap, and the colonel told me lately we were in want of a few little matters of this sort.\" Thus saying, with a significant whisper to me to watch the pedler, she disappeared with Chloe.\n\nThey soon returned, Chloe bearing a variety of garments, for mamma had taken the important premier pas. The pantaloons were first produced. The pedler took them in his hand, which flew up like an empty scale, to show how light they were; he held them up to the sun, and a half contemptuous smile crossed his lips; then shaking his head, he threw them down beside his basket. A drab overcoat was next inspected, and was also thrown aside with a doubtful expression.\n\n\"Mr. Pedler,\" said mamma, in a very soft tone, \"you must allow me a fair price, these are excellent articles.\"\n\n\"Oh, ver fair,\" said he, \"but te closhes ish not ver goot; te closhesman is not going to give me nothing for dish,\" and he laid a waistcoat on the other two articles.\n\nMamma and Chloe had by this time reached the depths of the basket, and, with sympathetic exclamations, arranged several articles on the slab.\n\n\"You will let me have these pitchers,\" said mamma, with a look of concentrated resolution, \"for that very nice pair of pantaloons.\"\n\nThe pedler gave a short whistle expressive of contempt, shook his head, and said, \"Tish not possibles. I will give two pisher and von prush for te pantaloon and waistcoat.\"\n\nMamma and Chloe glanced at each other and at me; I was absorbed in my own bargains, and said, carelessly, that the pitchers were perfect beauties. Chloe pushed one pitcher a little forward, mamma pushed the other on a parallel line, then poised a decanter, and again applied her delicate knuckles for the test. That, too, rang out the musical, unbroken sound, so dear to the housewife's\n\nPage 171\n\near, and, with a pair of plated candlesticks, was deposited on the table. The pedler took up the drab overcoat.\n\n\"Te closhesman's give nothing for dish.\"\n\nMamma looked disconcerted. The expression of her face implied the fear that the pedler would not even accept it as a gift. Chloe and she held a whispering consultation. At this moment Binah came in with little Patsey, who, seeing the articles on the slab, pointed with her dimpled fingers, and said her only words,\n\n\"Pretty! pretty!\"\n\nAt the same moment, Lafayette and Venus, the two little novices in furniture rubbing, exclaimed,\n\n\"Ki! if dem ting an't shine too much!\"\n\nThese opinions made the turning point in mamma's mind, though coming from such insignificant sources.\n\n\"So they are pretty, my darling,\" said mamma to Patsey; and then, turning to the pedler, she asked him what he would give in exchange for the pantaloons, the waistcoat, and the coat.\n\nThe pedler set aside two decanters, one pitcher, the plated candlesticks, and a hearth-brush.\n\n\"Tish ver goot pargains for te lady,\" said he.\n\nMamma gained courage.\n\n\"I cannot think of letting you have all these things without something more. You must at least throw in that little tray,\" and she looked at a small scarlet one, worth perhaps a quarter of a dollar.\n\nThe pedler hesitated, and held it up so that the morning sun shone on its bright hues.\n\n\"I shall not make a bargain without that,\" said mamma, resolutely. The pedler sighed, and laying it with the selected articles, said,\n\n\"Tish ver great pargains for te lady.\"\n\nMamma smiled triumphantly, and the pedler, tying up his bundle and slinging his stick, departed with an air of humility.\n\nPapa's voice was soon heard, as usual, before he was seen.\n\n\"Rub down Beauty, Mark, and tell Diggory to call out the hounds.\"\n\nPage 172\n\nThere was a slight embarrassment in mamma's manner when he entered, mingled with the same quantity of bravado. He nodded to her, tapped me on the head with his riding-whip, gave Patsey a kiss as she stretched out her arms to him, tossed her in the air, and, returning her to her nurse, was passing on.\n\n\"Do stop, colonel,\" said mamma, \"and admire my bargains. See this cut glass and plate that we have been wishing for, to save our best set.\"\n\n\"What, this trash?\" said he, pausing a moment at the table - \"blown glass and washed brass! Who has been fooling you?\"\n\n\"Colonel,\" said mamma, colouring highly, \"how can you -\"\n\n\"I cannot stop a minute, now, wife,\" said he. \"Jones and Ferguson are for a hunt to-day! They are waiting at Drake's corner. It looks like falling weather, and my old drab will come in well to-day.\"\n\nMamma looked frightened, and he passed on up stairs. He was one of those gentleman who keep a house alive, as the phrase is, whether in merriment or the contrary, and we were always prepared to search for his hat, or whip, or slippers, which he was confident he put in their places, but which, by some miracle, were often in opposite directions. Our greatest trial, however, was with mamma's and his spectacles, for they had four pairs between them - far-sighted and near-sighted. There were, indeed, optical delusions practiced with them; for when papa wanted his, they were hidden behind some pickle-jar; and when mamma had carefully placed hers in her key-basket, they were generally found in one of papa's various pockets; when a distant object was to be seen, he was sure to mount the near-sighted, and cry \"Pshaw!\" and if a splinter was to be taken out, nothing could be found but the far-sighted ones, and he said something worse: sometimes all four pairs were missing, and such a scampering ensued!\n\nWe now heard a great outcry up stairs. \"Wife! Chloe! Cornelia! come and find my drab coat!\" We\n\nPage 173\n\nlooked at each other in dismay, but papa was not a man for delay, and we obeyed his summons.\n\n\"Wife,\" said he, beating aside the externals of man that hung about his dressing-room, \"where is my old drab coat?\"\n\nMamma swallowed as if a dry artichoke was in her throat, as she said, slowly, \"Why, colonel, you know you had not worn that coat for months, and as you have another one, and a roquelaure, and the coat was full of moth holes, I exchanged it with the pedler for cut glass and plate.\"\n\n\"Cut devils!\" said papa, who liked to soften an oath by combinations; \"it was worth twenty dollars - yes, more, because I felt at home in it. I hate new coats as I do -\"\n\n\"But, colonel,\" interrupted mamma, \"you did not see the scarlet tray, and the -\"\n\n\"Scarlet nonsense!\" shouted papa; \"I believe, if they could, women would sell their husbands to those rascally pedlers!\"\n\nBeauty and the hounds were now pronounced ready. I followed papa to the piazza, and heard his wrath rolling off as he cantered away.\n\nPage 174\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE DUEL.\n\n\"Some fell for wrong and some for right,\n\nBut mony bade the world gude night.\"\n\nROBERT BURNS.\n\n\"Such I hold to be the genuine use of gunpowder, that it makes all men alike tall. ***\n\n\" With respect to duels, indeed, I have my own ideas. Few things in this so surprising world strike me with more surprise. Two little visual spectra of men, hovering with insecure enough cohesion in the midst of the Unfathomable, and to dissolve therein, at any rate, very soon, make pause at the distance of twelve paces asunder, whirl round, and simultaneously, by the cunningest mechanism, explode one another into dissolution.\" - Sartor Resartus.\n\nIt is a lovely tie that unites brothers and sisters, when the little jealousies of childhood are past. My brothers were expected from college, and my heart beat with curiosity and love. I practiced the tunes they used to prefer, decorated their bedrooms with such trifling articles of taste as the country-house afforded, ran again and again to the window to watch their approach through the avenue, and glanced at the mirror to see what they would think of me. They came - John was unaltered, though of firmer fabric. His chestnut curls still lay clustering on his head; he still idly thrust his hand through them; they fluttered as they were wont in boyhood, when the winds lifted their rich masses, and shook as mirth and laughter stirred his frame. His saucy eyes still looked archly into mine; his old jests were renewed, and his laugh went round like a spell, while his teeth, in their glittering whiteness, fairly fixed our eyes. The hounds knew his whistle, the servants gathered around him to receive the cordial shake of his hand, and every uncle and aunty on the plantation was remembered. There was a mixture of good-will and vanity in all that he did; one could scarcely say which preponderated.\n\nPage 175\n\nBut Richard - one could see the growth of soul in his whole exterior. His forehead had enlarged, and seemed bleached by pure intellect; his light thin hair floated back as though nothing should come between his mind-lit brow and heaven. He was taller than John, and at the same time more graceful and yielding. when his brother laughed he only smiled, and the smile seemed in sympathy for John, and not the ruffling of his serious spirit. There was a repose about him that called one away from his external beauty, of which he seemed unconscious, to his spiritual natures the sense of which appeared ever present with him; not that power which the world calls talent, and which sometimes leads to vanity, but that sense of a connexion with a higher order of hidden creation, which leads to a holy confidence in the Supreme Good. He said little; but when he spoke we paused, and our eyes lingered on him as his thoughts played on his lips after the voice had passed away.\n\nI could not be weary of looking at the manly growth of my dear brothers, of twining John's rebel curls on my finger, or parting the silken locks from Richard's thoughtful brow. As evening approached we sat on the sofa, hand clasped in hand, while mamma looked on us all in love; or I felt their arms encircle me as they gave me a renewed look of approving curiosity, or we listened to John's list of college troubles and college exploits, and I glanced into Richard's eyes to know if they were true. Papa too, his old reminiscences brightening up, gave them his bygone experience, and they chatted together of batter-puddings, whose affinities could scarcely be conquered by a rebound from the floor to the ceiling; Indian puddings, as faithful as the sun in their daily return; rank butter, which disclosed, in its almost interminable kegs, every evil of the palate, with scarcely the benefit of hope at the bottom; milk, which, from its colour, seemed to be under \"skyey influences\" rather than vegetable; coffee, whose geographical experience never reached further than the beet-bed of a Yankee garden; and tea, whose solutions would not have agitated the sensitive nerves of \"Fine-ear, who could hear the grass\n\nPage 176\n\ngrow.\" Then came the stale jokes of a jest-book substituted for the president's Bible; of the diffusion of hellebore by some mischievous wight in the recitation-room, which occasioned the whole class, tutor and all, to burst into fits of inextinguishable sneezing; of the rolling of hot iron balls down entry stairs, to be taken up by some poor unsuspecting martyr proctor; of all sorts of fantastic excuses offered by idle and ingenious scholars for their neglected lessons, disturbing even the gravity of to the instructors; of strange mistakes committed in recitation, some intentional and some unintentional, but all equally adapted to provoke the shout of irresistible laughter; of hairbreadth escapes and impudent subterfuges on the visits of tutors to noisy rooms; of the summoning of two or three frightened freshmen to a government meeting of sophomores and juniors, dressed up in their gowns, and the awful sentence of suspension or rustication passed upon the trembling and believing culprits; of the two, three, four, or five dollars, according to the merit of the composition, given to indigent but talented scholars, for writing themes, and forensics, and commencement parts; of a thousand other exploits, more adapted to a volume than a chapter, and \"thrice they slew the slain.\"\n\nJohn fell naturally into his old pursuits; club dinners, fishing-parties, and the chase soon occupied his leisure moments, while Richard devoted his time to books and to me. I soon perceived that the name of Randolph, a classmate and neighbour who had returned with them, was painful to Richard. Gradually, as we read together, or penetrated our old haunts on horseback, or strolled at sunset, kindling up our common sympathies at the altar of nature, he opened his heart to me. Randolph had insulted him on the voyage. John, in his ardent and careless way, had tried to effect a reconciliation, and thought he had succeeded, but Richard could only be satisfied by an apology. It had been demanded privately since his return and refused, though with explanations, and thus the beautiful repose of his spirit was broken. In John's ease it would have been decided by \"a word and a blow;\" but Richard's mental and physical temperaments\n\nPage 177\n\nwere both different from his; and while John entered into his favourite pursuits, Richard gave himself up to sensitive and jealous misery.\n\nThe subject of duelling had been frequently discussed in former years by papa and Duncan. Duncan thought it an outrage on the law of God, and an impatient interference with the political code of our country, which aims to provide for the rights of its citizens. He argued that the grievances between two private individuals ought not to be placed in the scale against the nuisance of throwing whole families and communities into terror, agitation, and unspeakable distress; that it is full season for an enlightened age to put down one of the most savage and foolish relics of barbarous times; that a spurious and animal bravery is the very highest sentiment which the practice promotes, while a lofty moral courage is exercised in refusing, not in accepting a challenge; that the most valuable lives are now exposed to destruction whenever an unprincipled bully sees fit to offer an insult; that, so far from the stain of dishonour being effaced by duelling, it is generally engrained more deeply, as is evinced by the fact that nothing is considered more uncivil than to allude to a particular duel in the presence of the surviver, or of the friends of either party; that, according to the present practice, virtue, vice, honour, infamy, truth, falsehood, are all made to depend on the most factitious and contingent principle in the world, viz., the event of a combat - the lottery of the pistol; that the conduct and the passions which are thus fostered seem natural to wolves, not to human beings; that the most valiant men of antiquity, the Cæsars, the Catos, and the Pompeys, never dreamed of avenging their personal injuries by private combats; that, since the most brave, enlightened, and virtuous nations on earth have been entirely ignorant of duelling, it is not essentially an institution of honour, but a frightful and barbarous custom, worthy of its ferocious origin; that, by a principle of false shame and the fear of reproach, it transforms the best of men into hypocrites and liars, and drives them out to murder the friends of their youth and their bosoms, for an indiscreet\n\nPage 178\n\nword which they ought to forget, perhaps for a merited reproach which they ought to endure; that the duellist, by a horrible refinement and reduplication of crime, unites at once in his own person the character of murderer and suicide; that the practice is not necessary to vindicate one's reputation from the charge of cowardice, since every brave man has opportunities to expose his life for the sake of his country and of humanity; that no man of true sensibility can ever expect to be serene and happy after having killed his antagonist; and, finally. that genuine honour lies in ourselves, not in the opinion of the world; that it is neither defended by sword nor buckler, but by a life of integrity and irreproachableness; and that this combat is more glorious than any other.\n\nPapa, on the contrary, advocated it as a check on the violence of human passion, as well as on the meanness of dishonour, and a salutary substitute for imperfect laws, particularly in a thinly-populated country, where arbitration is difficult, and the laws slow in their operation. He maintained that the agony of enduring an inset, and especially the scorn and contempt of society, are more intolerable than all the evils arising from the practice of duelling; and that the refusing to fight is an ambiguous action, since cowards may pretend principle to shelter themselves from a danger they dare not meet.\n\nI had often listened with intense interest to these discussions, and found myself leaning to what seemed to me the heroic side of the question, when papa said one day to Duncan, after a long argument -\n\n\"Could you, sir, condescend to bear an insult tamely?\"\n\nI felt my cheek flush as Duncan replied, calmly, \"I would trust to the laws of my country for redress, and never violate what I think to be the will of God.\"\n\nAs papa gave the slightest possible whistle and turned on his heel, I blushed deeper, but it was for Duncan; nor could his calm and dispassionate arguments with me ever separate the thought of cowardice from his views. Alas! I knew not then how my lofty feelings would be tested!\n\n\"What shall I do, Cornelia?\" said Richard, as we struck into a retired foot-path, after pouring out our souls\n\nPage 179\n\nto each other as we were wont to do. \"I feel the sting of this insult rankling like a serpent's fang within me through the day, and at night I see it branded in burning characters, in waking darkness, and yet more hideous dreams. I see it in every man's face calling me coward, and women seem to me to shrink from one who cannot defend them. I have tried to look all round this subject calmly, but it comes to me like a nightmare.\"\n\nWe were thrown together in the company of Randolph. I glanced at Richard, and soon saw a deep red spot gather on his cheek; his lips were compressed, and his manner stately. Randolph asked an introduction to me. I received him like ice, for my heart was my poor Richard's, who sat silent and reserved. Randolph became particularly gay; his wit flashed out, and shone the brighter over Richard's clouds. In the playfulness of his feelings he said things which a jealousy like ours was not slow to misinterpret. We left the circle abruptly.\n\n\"I can bear this no longer,\" said my brother, as he walked on with rapid strides, and pressed his hand to his forehead. \"Randolph scoffs at me. I must have the satisfaction of a gentleman. Even you despise me for my abject submission.\"\n\nI was silent for a while, and then said, \"I can bear anything better than your disgrace, brother.\"\n\nHow little did it occur to me that I might have been a medium of reconciliation instead of a desperate adviser! If the right string had been touched in my brother's mind, all would have been tuned to harmony, but my preconceived views of physical courage overbalanced the claim of high moral duty. Poor Richard! we went home; he threw himself moodily on the sofa, buried his face in his hands, and, rising, poured out his feelings anew in words of burning anger.\n\nOh, woman, beware how you aid in inflaming the passions of man! The courtesan of classic times won her judges by a display of her personal charms, let your manifestation be only of the bright and tender virtues; let not your influence, either of person or mind, swell\n\nPage 180\n\nthe tempest of unlawful excitement. It is not my object here to argue for or against quelling; that is the province of abler minds; but I may venture to show how female influence may \"ride on the whirlwind and direct the storm\" of masculine feeling for good or for evil; how the genius of Christianity, or even worldly philosophy, quietly exhibited in woman's gentle tones, may come with their enlightening power, not for the avoidance of mere physical pain, but with a serious regard to man's true dignity and ultimate destiny. I warn my sex against inflammatory expressions. Beautiful and graceful to the eye, can they be hard and unforgiving? We wonder not that the coarse nettle leaves its sting; but, when the flower that we carry to our lips ejects its poison, grief and surprise are added to the pain. Had I but given those \"soft answers that turn away wrath,\" had I thought of how many good feelings in man's nature may be operated upon - instead of stimulating the evil, I might have been the blessed means of reconciling two noble spirits. But I did not; my haughty soul would not stoop to the thought that my brother should even inquire into the motives of an aggressor. Stoop! mistaken term! The peacemaker stoops not, but rather rises to a high moral elevation, and looks calmly down upon the angry passions that are floating beneath him.\n\nA challenge was sent, unknown to any of our domestic circle but myself. The meeting was to be on the following morning, in a field two miles distant, at early dawn. Papa and John were in the city.\n\nRichard and I sat late in the piazza on that evening. We spoke but little; we did not, as we were often, in the fulness of our confidence, accustomed to do, clasp each other's hands. The voices of our family seemed to me like dreams and echoes rather than realities; to-morrow was spoken of - it was as a vague image for a moment - then the thought of its probable results swept over me like a coming tempest. The family retired to their quiet repose. Richard gave the little ones no kiss, as usual, and answered not their childish prattle; they all went, and we were left alone. Then came the agony;\n\nPage 181\n\nI could not let him go; I clung round his neck and petitioned him to stay. I felt already like a murderer. I offered to mediate - to do anything rather than expose a human life to risk the untried possibilities of a future state of being. Richard was affectionate, but firm.\n\n\"It is too late, my sister,\" he said. \"Had I been a little more patient\" (alas! what duellist has not had a moment like this?), \"I might have prevented this result. Perhaps, after all, I have exaggerated this affair; but it is too late - to stop now would be infamy. And now, Cornelia, for my last charge. I have endeavoured to write to-day, but in vain. I leave the commission to your tenderness.\"\n\nAs he said this, he handed me an unframed miniature of a full-length figure, on which was written \"Eliza.\" He had showed it me before, but now it struck me with tenfold interest. It was feminine almost to childishness, except the eyes; but there beamed forth from those dark orbs a full- formed soul, thirsting for intellectual food. The figure was slight, symmetrical, and waving - one of those that seem formed to lean on man's stronger arm: but the gazer on that portrait turned, as by a spell, and rested on those large dark eyes, beaming in glittering softness, until his heart said, \"I love thee, gentle one!\"\n\n\"Those beautiful eyes,\" said Richard, mournfully, as he leaned over my shoulder, while the moon shed its rays upon the picture, \"must they weep for me - for me, who vowed that the tears of our parting were the last that they should shed? I wiped them then, and Eliza stood like a trusting child as I did so; and when I said I could not leave her till she smiled, she did smile a radiant smile of hope and trustingness. Oh, God! have I not deceived her young heart? And my poor mother, she who has but just begun to reap the labour of maternal love, should I not have borne more for her? Randolph, too, do I hate him? do I wish his death? Would I not heal him if he were wounded, give him drink if he thirsted, and stand with him hand to hand against a common enemy? Strengthen me, Cornelia, I am bewildered; weep not thus, my sister, for God's sake; strengthen me.\"\n\nPage 182\n\nI could not; and we yielded in each other's arms one of those long and passionate bursts of agony that sweep along life's paths, and make the heart and body grow old.\n\nAt twelve o'clock we parted. I listened for his tread in the adjoining room; all was still. I would have given the world to hear his footstep. I could not bear the silence, but went to his door and whispered his name. He answered instantly, and calmly -\n\n\"Go back, my sister. I cannot see you.\"\n\n\"Only one word, Richard - one look more.\"\n\n\"No; go - go!\"\n\nI went to my bedroom. The moon was at full. Everything looked gigantic; the shadows lay in grotesque masses; the trees waved their arms like living things; the whippoorwill's note was like a shriek in my ear. Twice in that long night I went to Richard's door, and sat there; once I heard the click of a pistol. Still his only answer to my petition was,\n\n\"Go, go, Cornelia,\" in his calm, sweet tone.\n\nI laid myself down by the door, with my face upon the boards; their coolness was fresh to my burning cheek. I saw figures in the darkness - wounded forms - gashes - streaming blood - and Eliza was there - unconscious, with her glittering, moonlight eyes.\n\nThe door opened. I would have caught and held my brother, but, seemingly aware of my design, he stooped, and, holding my hands tightly in his, laid a long kiss upon my lips, and escaped rapidly down the stairs. I would have screamed to him to return, but my voice failed me. I was dizzy - faint; it was but a moment, but he was gone; then a ferocious horror came over me like madness. I clinched my hands and teeth, and a shivering went through my frame. It was insupportable. I rushed to mamma's apartment, and told her the horrid tale. Then was all the mother roused: then a throe deeper than birth-struggles tore her heart. It was fearful to see my calm parent thus moved. \"We must go to him,\" were all the words she uttered, but such looks, such piteous, piteous groans! Will they ever leave my memory,\n\nPage 183\n\nor the reproaches of his nurse, who, wringing her hands, shrieked out -\n\n\"Miss Neely, Miss Neely, how you been let my young maussa do such a ting? God have mercy on he soul.\"\n\nWe hurried on in silence, as if a word might delay us. The moon had gone down, and that melancholy moment melancholy even to happy hearts, arrived - the breaking dawn. How is it that awakening nature is thus sad? Does not the analogy of all human feeling tell us to sympathize joyfully with such scenes? How is it, then, that the moon and stars, which play as in jubilee around the form of midnight, look, before the gray dawn, like sad travellers journeying a lonely way?\n\nWe hastened on, nor thought of the stars as they sank, one by one, to shine on other worlds, nor of the purple glow that rose in rich colouring on the eastern sky. We were near the place of meeting - human figures were seen. A flash - a sound - we reached the spot - the cries of our attendants pierced the air. Mamma received her unconscious son in her arms, and I clasped, with a breaking heart, his pulseless hand.\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nMARIA ALWYN AND HER MOTHER.\n\n\"And thou, sad sufferer under nameless ill,\n\nThat yields not to the touch of human skill,\n\nImprove the kind occasion, understand\n\nA father's frown, and kiss his chastening hand.\n\nTo thee the day-spring and the blaze of noon,\n\nThe purple evening and resplendent moon,\n\nShine not, or undesired and hated shine,\n\nSeen through the medium of a cloud like thine.\"\n\nCOWPER.\n\n\"Nous nous aimions tous-deux des la plus tendre enfance,\n\nEt j'avois sur son coeur une entière puissance;\n\nJe trouvais à lui plaire une extrème douceur,\n\nEt les chagrins du frêre étoient ceux de la soeur.\"\n\nRACINE.\n\nAs I saw the face of my brother, on which death seemed to have stamped an instantaneous seal, and\n\nPage 184\n\nheard his nurse's groans and lamentations, and mamma's piercing words of love, and the physician's inquiring voice, it seemed to me as if some wild and fearful tragedy were enacting. Still I felt an awful testimony within me, which declared, \"You have made this ruin - your words, which should have stilled the tempest, have given it force; you, who call yourself the gentle and tender Christian, have held the torch and spread this ruin.\"\n\nRandolph approached; pale as death, he gazed silently for a moment on his fallen victim, and then, with a suppressed voice, said -\n\n\"Would to God that society required not this sacrifice! It is a fearful thing to go thus before one's Maker and Judge.\" With a half-unconscious shudder he was then led away.\n\nLife was not extinct, but it fluttered almost to dissolution. Richard was borne home, and we followed - a sorrow-struck train. His nurse wrung her hands and wept audibly; Bella, the dumb woman, met us with her wild howling; and Jim looked anxious and subdued.\n\nLife struggled fearfully for a few days with the destroyer. Mamma, by his bedside, and I, lying on his pillow, watched his pallid face; it was indeed like death; his silky hair was parted from his noble forehead, and his dark lashes lay on his marble cheek; one could not see that he breathed; to my excited imagination, the fluttering pulse often seemed to stop, his hands fell nerveless, and only now and then a quivering sigh stole from his breast.\n\nSlowly, at length, his eyes unclosed, and a faint smile, as they met our gaze, like the shadow of an infant's dream, parted his lips. Oh, my heart! I was faint with joy. Again came the blessed testimony of life and love; he whispered Mother! She bent over to his pale lips, clasped his clasping hand, laid her face on his pillow and wept. It was a moment for the heart's prayer. His old nurse, with upraised eyes and trembling hands, stood by and uttered hers aloud. Jim looked on anxiously, for he was frightened by mamma's tears.\n\nPage 185\n\n\"He will live!\" I whispered to Jim; \"he has spoken and smiled.\"\n\nA little sustenance was given him; he smiled again, and Jim caught the beautiful glance of coming life as it beamed even on him.\n\n\"Ki!\" said Jim, in a tone a little over a whisper, and snapping his fingers, \"dead an't gwying for catch Maus Dick yet!\"\n\nSo saying, he opened the door softly, slid down the balusters, cut a few somersets through the yard, and proclaimed the good news to the people. Poor fellow! it was the first time he had voluntarily left his young master's room. Night and day he and Richard's old nurse had taken their stations there unbidden; when asleep, a word aroused them; when waking, they watched with active kindness. What Southern family has not this testimony to give of some faithful dependent who thus creates a tie of gratitude?\n\nRichard's recovery was rapid, and the busy kindness devoted to a Southern convalescent was soon discernible. Custards and preserves, and the niceties of the season, decorated with bouquets of flowers, were sent by neighbours; while the coloured people brought eggs in little baskets, with young poultry from their own stores. One old woman came to the door and asked \"just to look in.\"\n\nHis nurse brought her humble offering, and said, with a courtesying apology -\n\n\"I an't raise but one chicken dis year, but I fetch 'em for my child's soup.\"\n\nThe first night that I retired to my own apartment, with a heart weighed low by gratitude, I threw myself upon my knees by the window where the moonlight scene had been so appalling. The stars, from their abodes of darkness, threw down their glimmering rays and lighted my weeping eyes. I felt like one who had been rescued from a precipice, and looked back with trembling on the chasm below. Did I feel that a great duty had been performed, and that noble approval which gives us strength to bear and wings to fly? No; escape was the only\n\nPage 186\n\ncause of triumph; and however men may vindicate duelling on grounds of expediency, will they not find this the predominant feeling when they survive? Not the reward of bravery, not the elevating testimony of high moral courage, but a simple relief from some dark and overhanging necessity, is the best result of this horrid and unnatural violation of social peace.\n\nJohn returned with papa, and, after the first strong emotions were over, laughter and jest echoed through our mansion; but Richard and I for a while dwelt on higher things. He had been too near the unknown abyss of a future world not to feel a cast of solemnity over his soul. We reasoned together of sacred things - of death and a judgment to come.\n\n\"It may be a vain speculation,\" he said to me, \"but I delight in anticipating the future state of disimbodied spirits. What are your thoughts on this subject, Cornelia?\"\n\n\"It is my favourite idea,\" I answered, \"that 'we shall all be changed,' spiritually as well as physically. The world has been more bright to me than to many, but I have no wish to carry away any of its recollections. Young as I am, I am tired of its struggles. I hope for a butterfly transition - a change from this headaching and heartaching scene to a bright and God-sunned atmosphere. I love to think that when I have done weaving (faithfully) my earthly envelope, I shall spring from it, gorgeous and beautiful, and flit away, forgetful of the coarse chrysalis that falls, as I ascend in joy to my heavenly Father's spiritual kingdom. But one thing I must require in my flight\" (and I pressed Richard's hand to my cheek), \"that brother butterflies shall go with me.\"\n\n\"I would prefer annihilation,\" said Richard, \"to a forgetting of my individual self. The spirit must be able to look back, and compare, and judge; it must feel its growth, to be happy. Accession in knowledge is the only test of spirituality. I cannot imagine even the Supreme Mind at rest; it must be experimenting, creating still.\"\n\nThus we discoursed together, or I read to him; a\n\nPage 187\n\nsoothing quiet stole over us, and the spirit of prayer was around us.\n\nThis is the worth of sorrow. Before we suffer, words are said, but the spirit prays not; it is mere form; but, when affliction has struck the rock of our hearts, and its religious waters gush forth, we pray always; that is, a conscious presence of divinity is within us, and our thoughts are prayers.\n\nBut this holy influence is not felt by all, and wretched are those who, having tasted these waters, feel not that the Lord is gracious. While Richard was convalescent, a neighbour, a widow, lost her only child, a daughter. We were not in the habit of visiting her; but, hearing that she was in distress, and without domestic friends, mamma commissioned me to go to her, with such offers of service and sympathy as our own softened feelings dictated. In my own equestrian excursions, I had seen Mrs. Alwyn riding about her fields. Her appearance was remarkable; tall, masculine in her proportions, with full, flashing black eyes, she gave directions to her people, not \"with a low voice, that excellent thing in woman,\" but in coarse tones of encouragement or vituperation. It was said that the love of gain and fear of her neighbours were all that restrained her from positive cruelty. She arose at the dawn of day, and even used agricultural implements herself to stimulate her negroes. She denied herself rest and relaxation, and spent a life of unmitigated toil, and for what? That she might educate and accomplish her daughter; and Maria \"grew like a living flower beneath her eye.\" With her mother's commanding height, she possessed a wavy delicacy of figure; her mother's dark and flashing eyes were, in her, softened by modest sensibility, she touched with taste and skill the piano which her parent's hard labour had earned, and around her apartments were hung, in expensive frames, trophy after trophy of her conquests with the pencil. While Mrs. Alwyn reconnoitred the fields, a terror to idlers, or attended to the drudgery of the house, Maria lived secluded, her soft hands embroidering tasteful attire, or her dark eyes dropping tears of sympathy\n\nPage 188\n\nover fictitious sorrow. It was sufficient happiness to her mother to glance at her white-robed daughter, as she sat apart like an idol in its shrine. Maria often expostulated with her, and wrought tasteful caps and kerchiefs, and playfully arrayed her mother in them, but with little effect. Mrs. Alwyn strode about in her soiled and tattered dress, not hesitating, as occasion demanded, to test the strength of her hand on the ears and shoulders of some unhappy loiterer. I had met Maria at church, and occasionally in my rambles, and had thought of knowing her further, as I heard details of her situation and character, when I learned that she was suddenly withdrawn from this living and moving scene. I willingly hastened to her bereaved mother.\n\nI was ushered in by her frightened-looking servant, with that light and solemn tread which we see where death is. I was shocked to observe the body of the deceased laid out on a table in the parlour, in order to be near, as I learned afterward, to her mother, that she might see her while she prepared the house for the funeral. A white shroud and sheet inwrapped the body, and there seemed to be a supernatural extent in the tall figure, as the pointed toes stood up beneath the thin covering. Over the beautiful eyes, now but partially closed, lay pieces of metal. Was this indeed Maria, thus cold and pale as new-fallen snow?\n\nMrs. Alwyn sat where she could watch the corpse and gaze upon its countenance. She held a plate in her hand, and a towel, as if she had been wiping it. A stern coldness was mingled with her grief, and she rocked to and fro in her chair, with the motion which sorrow loves.\n\nI entered, she regarded me with a slight motion of the head. I took her hand - it was passive. I spoke, but there was no answer, and I sat down in silence. At length, with a look in which distress and anger were strangely blended, she said -\n\n\"There she is, Miss Wilton! see what it's come to! a beautiful corpse she is! That girl an't done a thing to trouble her mother's heart since she came into the world, a stark baby, till now. Do you see them pictures?\"\n\nPage 189\n\n(and she pointed with her soiled dark fingers from one to the other.) \"I have toiled night and day, I've worked like a nigger, and more than any nigger, I've been up early and abed late, to get that girl a genteel education, and what has it all come to? Look at that piano - I put the hay into the loft with a pitchfork with my own hands to let the niggers have time to bring that here. Didn't she sing sweetly? I worked my fingers most to the bone for them pictures and music, and what has it all come to? Just look at her and see. Where's her voice now? What has it all come to? Wasn't she a pretty-faced girl, with her white hands, that I wouldn't let so much as wash up a cup? Look at them now, stiff and still!\" (I turned and shuddered as I looked at Maria's long straight arm as it lay in her shroud.)\n\n\"Miss Wilton, it don't seem to me as if I can bear it, or as if I ought to.\"\n\nI ventured to suggest a reliance on a higher Power, who afflicts only in mercy.\n\n\"It tan't no mercy,\" said she, passionately. \"I wouldn't treat a dog so. If you had a garden full of seeds, and saw them come up and blow out beautiful, and their stalks grow greener and bigger every day, while you was watering them, do you think it would be merciful if anybody was to come and tramp them all down, and pull up your pretty flowers by the root? There wasn't a prettier flower in all creation than that,\" continued she, pointing to the lifeless form, \"and now see what she is.\"\n\n\"She was a lovely girl,\" said I, \"and you had reason to be proud of her. I have often observed her tall, graceful figure as she came into church. I am glad to hear that she was kind and dutiful; that, at least, must comfort you.\"\n\n\"'Tan't no comfort,\" said Mrs. Alwyn, bitterly. \"If she had been cross and ugly, she might have gone and welcome. What is the use of having a person about you that an't pleasant? But I'll tell you what is a mortal hard case, to have something taken away that was the delight of your eyes; one who used to be the first\n\nPage 190\n\nobject you loved to look at in the morning, and the last at night. In the morning, when I came from the field, I used to go to her bedroom and wake her. How pretty she was on her pillow, with one cheek all red like a rose, where she had laid on it, and the other like a lily! and when I said 'Maria!' how she rubbed her eyes like a child, and half pouted and half smiled as I waked her. Where is the rosy cheek now?\"\n\nMy heart thrilled as I saw its paleness.\n\n\"And then,\" continued her mother, \"she sat so ladylike at table, as if she had been born and bred genteel; her frocks like snow, and her cambric handkerchiefs in her lap. At night I used to go in and tuck up her bed; she was always at her books, or her work, or reading her Bible, or on her knees at prayer, for she was a pious child.\"\n\n\"You must at least be grateful that her mind was so pure, and pious, and prepared for death,\" said I.\n\n\"Grateful!\" replied she, angrily. \"What good will it do me? I shall be none the better for her hymns and her prayers. If she had stayed, I could have heard her sweet voice. Now, I've worked my fingers to the bone just for that dead body. I can't bear it, and that's an end of the matter. I don't think it's fair that she should die. Well, I must go to work and bury her,\" muttered she, in a lower tone, and retiring into the next apartment, where she could still glance at her lifeless child.\n\nI stood a while and meditated on the early dead. Her image came before me as I had often seen her enter church, dressed with exquisite care, and a reference to the changing shades of fashion. Her head had a gentle bend or wave, from a consciousness of her height, which, as she did not stoop, was rather graceful, while her cheek, usually pale, was lighted up by the thought of public observation. She often rested an ungloved hand on the side of the pew, which, as it was delicately white, and glittering with jewels, I sometimes thought was for display; but her modest eyes seemed to deny it; and her voice, rising in rich and earnest tones in the hymns and chants, and\n\nPage 191\n\nher air of devotion in prayer, showed an engagedness that comported not with vanity.\n\nNow I saw her stretched on her hard resting-place, death giving that supernatural length to her tall form, those glazed eyes, that were so lately lit up with intellectual glory, but partially closed by the heavy metal on the starting lids; those feet, which had trod the aisles with light and graceful movement, stiff and prominent under the white death-clothing; that fair hand, whose sparkling gems had glittered to the observer, dazzling in whiteness still, but with the unrosy paleness of the grave.\n\nHer wretched mother's unbelief saddened still more this painful picture. Could she have looked on her with Christian trust, and fancied that spirit translated to the garden of heaven, where blight, and frost, and tear-dews fall not; could she have fancied her upward-soaring, and retained but a fold of her garment to aid her own flight, how would her cold heart have felt the change! But alas! the grave was to her the end of all this sweetness and truth; faith stood not by that grave, with patient eye and folded wing, ready to spread, at God's command, either over the path of earthly duty or spiritual joy.\n\nBut grief will be busy. The miserable mother decorated the cold corpse with all that custom and fashion demand; the finest cambric enshrouded it, the sheerest muslin lay on that pale forehead; the coffin glittered with funeral ornaments; ceremony lingered in the well-ordered procession; and in a few months a pompous monument proclaimed to the world the death and the virtues of Maria Alwyn.\n\nThis picture (literally true) is a startling representation of an irreligious, uncultivated mind; but are there not many who secretly carry out these sacrilegious feelings when God lays their earthly blessings in the dust?\n\nPage 192\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nMY BROTHER BEN'S EDUCATION.\n\n\"He saw whatever thou hast seen;\n\nEncountered all that troubles thee:\n\nHe was - whatever thou hast been;\n\nHe is - what thou shalt be.\"\n\nWE were at this period made unhappy by my brother Benjamin's abrupt return from school; and it may not be unprofitable to relate his reverses before and after this time, independently of my narrative.\n\nWhy are there no more ripe and accomplished scholars among us? The secret, I apprehend, will be partially understood, if the progress of his education is examined. It will probably awaken the sympathetic groans of many a young man, who has to mourn over a similar experience. I fear we must look forward to an indefinite repetition of similar consequences, until Charleston shall provide one grand and uniform institution, or system of institutions, for the education of her youth, that shall be unaffected by the death or change of teachers, or the boundless variety of text-books; and until parents shall co-operate cheerfully with the rules of such a system.\n\nAt the age of nine years, Ben was placed at one of the best schools in Charleston, and boarded in a private family. He was a lad of excellent abilities; rather more fond, indeed, of his play and horses than of study, but never wilfully backward at his lesson. His teacher, besides superintending the usual branches of his English education, put him early into the Latin grammar. Ben was punctual at school, and learned two or three of his lessons every evening at home. When we were in town, I gave him what assistance I could, though now and then a hearty cry took place over the difficulties which neither he nor I could comprehend. His troubles at school\n\nPage 193\n\nwere of the ordinary description - sometimes a detention till long after the dinner-hour - sometimes a severe chastisement for noise or carelessness - and sometimes a station far below the middle of his class. Yet he was evidently making an improvement in most of his studies; and could his present opportunities have been continued, Ben might have become, in time, a very respectable scholar. Unfortunately, however, his teacher, at the end of the year, abandoned his occupation for a profession, and Ben was thrown loose on the scholastic world.\n\nAfter some time, another teacher was procured for him. On entering his new place of instruction, he was examined in all his studies, and pronounced to be miserably deficient in every respect. The fact is, this gentleman made no allowance whatever for the perturbation of the poor boy's mind; when suddenly brought before a strange teacher, his attention being distracted by a new and noisy school, and that, too, after a month or more of entire interruption in his studies. The learned gentleman found particular fault with Ben's ignorance of the multiplication table and Latin grammar, and took occasion to express some doubts of the capacity of his former instructer to teach in those departments. I need not say how very unjust was such an inference. Be that as it may, my brother was ordered to begin all his books again, and was stationed in a class inferior to that which he had left at the other school. He came home completely discouraged and mortified; disgusted alike with learning and with his new instructor.\n\nMay I be permitted, with due modesty, to suggest, that much mischief is occasionally inflicted in this way on ingenuous and well-intentioned youth, in consequence of an examination, which can only be superficial and imperfect? Would it not be more proper to take the word of the parents and of the former teacher as to the progress already made by the pupil? It would be found, in a short time, that he could easily revive his former knowledge, without being necessitated to lose his standing for a whole year, or to suffer a mortifying degradation.\n\nBut the feelings of youth are elastic. It is one of the\n\nPage 194\n\nblessings of that period of life, that its mortifications are not attended with enduring bitterness. Ben accommodated himself to his new situation with tolerable grace; and by the close of another year he had just about regained that point in his progress at which he had been left by his former teacher. In consequence, however, of falling into some untoward scrape, he was chastised with undue severity by his tutor, who was a man of violent passions. Papa's temper was equally violent, and the affair terminated in an abrupt withdrawal of my brother Ben from his present school, and his transference to another.\n\nFrom the precipitancy with which this exchange was effected, papa had no opportunity to institute any minute inquiry as to the merits or studies of Ben's new school. The boy trotted off with much cheerfulness on the first morning of his attendance, and with his satchel full of his old schoolbooks. But papa was not a little surprised and mortified in seeing Ben return home at about ten o'clock, with his heavy satchel on his arm, and a note from his new teacher, requesting that the boy should be furnished with an entirely new set of books, since those which he had brought with him to school were now quite out of date. Pike's Arithmetic was to be exchanged for Daboll's; Morse's Geography for Cumming's, Ruddiman's Latin Grammar for Adam's; Webster's Spelling-book for Carpenter's; Bingham's English Grammar for Murray's; the American Selection for the English Reader; the New Testament for the whole Bible; while one set of copy-slips was to be substituted for another; a single-ruled writing-book for a double-ruled one, which Ben had just begun; and the gentleman had even the thoroughgoingness to request that my brother's large, stout new slate might be exchanged for a recently-invented tablet, which would come in requisition at certain times when the blackboard should not be used.\n\nIn general, papa was very liberally disposed as to pecuniary matters, and was always particularly willing to encourage suggested improvements in education. But it so happened, that this year his crops had been lamentably\n\nPage 195\n\ncut short, and the prices of rice and cotton were very much depressed. This, added to the irritability under which he was still labouring from his difficulty with the preceding teacher, excited him, in a moment of self-forgetfulness, to exclaim that he would not procure a single one of those newfangled books, and that he did not care whether Ben attended any of those vexatious schools or not. I knew it was hopeless to attempt to change this unhappy mood immediately, and the result was, that poor Ben ran about the streets for a full week unoccupied, gathering large stores of boyish experience no doubt, but sadly falling behindhand in point of literary cultivation.\n\nIt was now time for me to interfere; indeed, I was conscious that papa, having gotten the better of his temper, and opened his mind to the influence of reason, was only waiting for a word or two from me, in order to enter upon a more praiseworthy course. One morning, therefore, at the breakfast-table, I ventured to express my regret that Ben should continue in his present unhappy state of idleness, and suggested that he might possibly have been fortunate in making an exchange of teachers; for it was to be supposed that improvements must be going on in schoolbooks as well as in everything else. It cost me but a few words to obtain permission to go out that very morning in pursuit of the whole appointed list.\n\nI searched every book-store in the city, finding one book here and another there, but was unable to procure more than half the prescribed number. I was assured that if I had called but two or three days before, I might have obtained some of the most important of those which were wanting. But it was now too late, and we were obliged to await a new importation from the North. Steamboats, in those days, arrived not with weekly punctuality; and, therefore, Ben was compelled to run wild nearly another month before he could enter the wished-for school, equipped, externally at least, with all the educational improvements of the age.\n\nMy brother, who had now arrived at an age of some reflection, found himself, somewhat to his astonishment, at the foot of the hill of science. The preceding years\n\nPage 196\n\nappeared to his view like a vacant dream. Young as he was, he could not help inquiring what had become of them; but supposing that Heaven and parental guardianship had ordered all things aright in this matter, he resolved to dismiss unavailing regrets, and begin anew, with commendable diligence and ardour, the study of numeration, and of the definite and indefinite articles, and of the astronomical introduction to geography.\n\nWe could find no fault with Ben's present teacher. The lad made a satisfactory progress in his studies, and all things flowed along in peace until August of the next year, when his preceptor, who happened to be a native of New-England, was fatally attacked by the yellow fever, and died, leaving his school involved in sorrow and confusion. There was no more study for that season, and we were obliged to wait until late in the autumn before a gentleman could be procured to undertake the school on his own account. My brother was, of course, injured by this unfortunate intermission in his studies. He lost somewhat in his power of application, and gained as much in his inclination for all kinds of youthful amusements. His new preceptor, not only desirous of making up the recently lost time of his school, but being one of those teachers who are overstimulated by the ambition of advancing his pupils with wonderful rapidity, heaped lesson upon lesson, and even required several new branches and books to be learned, in order that he might surprise the parents and the committee, at the succeeding annual examination, with the unequalled results of his labours. Ben humorously requested his father to furnish him with a horse and dray to transport his books between the school and the house. It was indeed no small physical labour for him to carry his little library backward and forward. His satchel, though of large dimensions, could not contain the whole, and he was obliged to carry several books under his left arm. Groaning and perspiring, grumbling and bantering together, he lugged to and fro his heavy loads for a few days, until papa purchased for him a small, strong white horse, with tail and mane closely cropped. I manufactured\n\nPage 197\n\nfor him a new sack, resembling more a clothesbag than a satchel. Putting into this the whole of his school furniture, and placing it on the neck of his favourite pony, he mounted and rode off with a lighter body at least, if not with a lighter heart, than he had lately enjoyed.\n\nHe was now beginning to be ashamed of the backwardness of his learning, compared with his age. He conceived a new and passionate fondness for study. He arose every morning at dawn, and retired not to rest until near midnight. He even refused to devote any hours to recreation, so determined was he to realize the whole system of his present teacher, and to accomplish every one of his lessons in the most perfect manner. But this was more than the powers of nature could bear. He pursued the present course about three months, and found his health and constitution rapidly giving way. The family physician being consulted, directed that he should quit school and books altogether for some time, and reside with mamma in the country. Thus, by making too much haste, poor Ben, as well as his teacher, rather retarded than accelerated his progress. He passed a few weeks in the country, entirely abandoned to amusements, and returned to town in perfect health. On again attending school, he experienced the immense disadvantage of being far behind his class. The studies which he had missed were indispensably necessary to a right understanding of his present lessons. This circumstance, added to the sufferings he had already endured from over-application, threw Ben into complete despair. Finding it impossible to accomplish all his tasks in a tolerable manner, he grew indifferent and inattentive. He was contented to remain at the foot of his class, and was proof against any species of degradation and punishment. He frequently played the truant. He protracted his holydays in the country till near the first of February and the middle of May. His afternoons in town were devoted to riding on his little horse, whose flesh rapidly disappeared by racings on the battery and gallopings through Meeting-street, at the peril of all the negro children in his way.\n\nPage 198\n\nIt was now full time to try a new experiment with my unlucky brother. A school happened to be opened near our residence; and as it was but too manifest that Ben was wasting away his precious youth by his present career, we determined on seizing this opportunity to make an exchange, and give him another chance for improvement. Accordingly, he became a pupil of our new neighbour, whom, if I were devising characteristic names for the teachers enumerated in this chapter, I might call by the appropriate title of Mr. Easy. If Ben was before oppressed with the multitude of his tasks, he had now far too little to accomplish. When a lesson was assigned him to be learned at home, which was but seldom the case, he might attend to it or not, as he chose, for it was never exacted from him. His teacher was all indulgence; going nominally over the common branches of learning with his pupils, but leaving it to their own genius and good sense whether any of them should become scholars or idlers. Now Ben had not quite sufficient independent energy to make much progress under a system like this. He was naturally docile, and would have lent himself kindly to the influences of any good and effective method. But being somewhat of a victim to circumstances, he could not resist the thousand temptations of a city life, when opposed to the feeble prescriptions of an indulgent preceptor. Accordingly, he was in a fair way of being ruined. His talk was of horses. His companions were idlers. He commenced playing on the guitar. He was a precocious dandy. His thoughts were over-much given to dancing, and gallantry, and all those other arts by which the precious sands of time are irrevocably wasted. Fortunately, the school which he now attended died a natural death. It had not sufficient stamina to keep itself alive. One after another of the pupils dropped away, and the incapable teacher emigrated to Alabama, leaving my brother Ben, with only two fellow-students, to seek for better places of education.\n\nJust about this time, advertisements appeared in the daily prints, announcing a new institution, to be conducted on a highly improved and refined plan. The public\n\nPage 199\n\nwere told that appeals would be made entirely to the good feelings of the pupils - that everything like corporeal chastisement would be banished - that the memory and other inferior faculties of the mind would be very little cultivated - while almost exclusive attention would be paid to the development of the reason and other higher powers. Dazzled by these brilliant promises, papa and Ben conceived that all former disappointments were now to be cancelled; and that nothing but the happiest career was opened before the sanguine and ambitious young man. He was one of the earliest candidates for the benefits of this improved and refined system. For a time, everything flowed on smoothly and sweetly in this paradise of academies. The millennium of education seemed to have arrived. The teacher was a man of polished and plausible deportment, and fascinated my brother's imagination and good-will. But before long, Ben discovered that he could make no progress in the classics without a considerable tax on his memory - the declensions and the rules of his Greek and Latin grammars were not always ready on his tongue - and on such occasions his teacher was apt to fret, and assign my brother pretty heavy tasks to commit to memory at home. Those long conversations and processes of reasoning, too, which were to develop the youthful mind, and which were so charming to Ben in the outset, grew at length to be somewhat fatiguing - his attention would too frequently lag, and thus incense his preceptor - and he would sometimes doubt the cogency of his arguments or statements, instead of assenting to them with that beautiful docility which was at first equally agreeable to both teacher and pupil. One day, especially, when all these various grievances had swelled and festered to an outbreaking point, Ben very rudely questioned some position or reasoning of his preceptor. The latter replied indignantly. Ben followed up his insubordination. The teacher, forgetting his own maxim respecting personal chastisement, gave Ben a severe blow, which was immediately retorted by the fiery lad, and a downright engagement between them ensued before the whole school. The consequence was, that my\n\nPage 200\n\nbrother appeared at dinner-table that day with black and blue marks on his countenance, and was soon after expelled from the institution.\n\nHe was now sent to an academy at the North, where he passed another year. But the previous habits and fortunes of his life had poorly fitted him to sustain the duties of this new situation. With shame and regret, he found himself far behind his companions and equals in age, and knew no other way to obtain the notoriety of which youth in general are so fond, than to launch out into a life of brilliant extravagance and dissipation. This course soon exhausted not only the very liberal allowances transmitted by my father, but also the copious remittances secretly forwarded by my mother; and at the end of a year he was recalled home, with an unsettled character and disposition.\n\nA succession of struggles enabled him to enter a Southern college, and, after many suspensions and fines, bring us home a diploma and a blue riband.\n\nThe question now again to be asked is, Where is the remedy for this imperfect education - for evils which so many of both sexes have felt, in common with poor Ben? The most obvious mode that occurs to me is, to convert schools into places for teaching instead of recitation. As the present plan operates, every parent would willingly change offices with the teacher; that is, if a master would superintend the committing a lesson to memory, with the requisite explanations, the parent would very gladly hear it recited.\n\nWould it not be practicable for masters to teach, and explain, and see that a lesson is committed one day, and hear it recited the next? A few parents might complain that the boys and girls were idle at home, merely from habit; but they would soon find their gain in being able to cultivate some favourite study, in exercise, &c. I am confident that if Ben had been taught his lessons at school, it would have changed the whole habit of his mind.\n\nHow ill suited is a bustling parlour for the studies of children, and how few parents know how to teach!\n\nPage 201\n\nI do not mean, in these remarks, to say one disrespectful word of teachers. A more conscientious, self-sacrificing, enlightened class of persons than they cannot be found, and they but comply with the customs around them in their present system; but, to justify my remarks, I have only to state, that the evil referred to has reached such a height, that some parents have been under the necessity of hiring instructors at night to teach their children the school lessons for the following day. If the system continue as it is, the name of teacher should be changed to lesson-hearer.\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nMARION. - DUMB BELLA. - THE INDIAN. - A WEDDING.\n\n\"But who is she, retiring and alone,\n\nThat makes her thoughts by sign and gesture known?\n\nNo voice escapes those lips in accents dear,\n\n'Tis one dead silence all from year to year.\n\nYet let not pity too officious rise;\n\nNature compensates that which it denies.\n\nThe expressive look - the motion fraught with grace -\n\nMay rival language and supply its place:\n\nAnd for that senseless ear perchance are given\n\nEthereal sounds, and intercourse with heaven.\"\n\nS. GILMAN.\n\nIs Marion forgotten? asks some young girl, to whom love is the Alpha and Omega of a story. No, not forgotten; but I never proposed to write a love-story in these simple details, Whose object is to show the habits of Southern domestic life.\n\nI must confess, however, that an expecting look was cast up the avenue as strangers approached, and a tremour felt when he actually came. There was a slight abstraction, too, in his manners, which the students of love-thermometers might have supposed a suspicious circumstance. Whenever he saw me on horseback he\n\nPage 202\n\nlooked wistfully, and his face reddened. My dress was entirely different from that in which he had seen me at the time of my bouleversement; my height and manner were altered, and I always began to jest on trifling topics, for I was frightened at the thought of a disclosure after what had passed. It seemed to me as if feminine pride called on me to keep my secret, since Anna and Lewis, who alone could have revealed it gracefully, were gone.\n\nMarion was preparing himself for usefulness. Inheriting a large estate, he did not feel authorized to enter on its duties without some personal discipline. He attended medical and surgical lectures, that he might supply with advice the accidental wants of his people; and interested himself in mechanics, as a means of saving labour on his plantation. His fine person never looked more noble to me than when, in his workman's jacket, with his tools in his hand, he superintended, and even aided, the works of his people. He felt the responsibility of his situation, and looked with a steady and inquiring eye on his duties, removing evil where it was practicable, and ameliorating what was inevitable. It was not gain only that he sought; he was aware that he controlled the happiness of a large family of his fellow-creatures. He neither permitted himself to exercise oppression, nor tolerated it in others. Happy human faces were his delight, and the blessings that followed his footsteps were like angel voices crowning his cares. He felt how much a planter has to answer to man and to God in the patriarchal relation he holds, and he shrank not indolently from the arduous demand. High responsibility exalts the character of a good man, and I could not but perceive the growth of principle in Marion's words and actions, while I heard among some of the young men who visited us a tone of frivolity that sadly contrasted with his earnest dignity of thought and expression. I insensibly prized him for this difference, and felt how much safer would be the happiness of a wife in his keeping than in that of a mere idler.\n\nThe moral education of Southern youth should be directed to their peculiar duties; indeed, there are passages\n\nPage 203\n\nin the teachings of the New Testament which apply peculiarly to our institutions, and which, though almost negative elsewhere, are exquisitely beautiful in the classification of relative duties here. \"Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven.\" \"Ye masters, forbear threatening, knowing that your master is also in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.\" \"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh.\" \"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour.\" The temptations of power should be diligently pointed out, passion repressed, purity enforced, and then the young Southerner will rise like the sun over the wide sphere of his duty, diffusing light and warmth around him. As Mentor dwelt with eloquence on the expected legislation of Telemachus, so should every father prepare his son, at the South, for the little kingdom over which he is to reign in wisdom and love.\n\nIt would seem, at the first glance, that one of the most difficult offices of the planter would be to restrain the tempers of the uneducated beings under his care; but daily occupation and systematic routine are favourable to harmony, and God has seemed wonderfully to have balanced human passions. There are few Zelucos among fathers. The subject of surprise is, the escape of so many from injury, under the hand of passion, in all communities. Who has not seen a mother of the labouring classes shake a child with her strong arm, until one would suppose dislocation would follow, and the child come out from the operation rather strengthened, as from a Calisthenic exercise? How many shoes, aimed at the head of a culprit, have missed their destination! It is curious to observe how seldom they hit. As far as I have observed, the poorer classes in New-England shake their children in a sudden impulse of anger; while negroes throw something at theirs. There is that which in tremendously exciting in a shake - the chatter of one's teeth, the impotence of one's nerves and sinews, and the trill of the voice as one begs pardon.

The poor mother, standing at her wash-tub, burning over the fire, or delving at her needle, must be summary in her punishments, and the little rebel takes advantage of her limited minutes. Even the dark closet, the resort of leisurely people, consumes too much time for her, and when she thinks her urchin is well seated on a bench in the corner, to which he has been banished, he has slipped off and gone to some new experiment. The poor soul can neither stay to administer a dose of castor oil, as one of my friends does, for bad temper, nor apply a cold bath, nor bind a strip of paper on the forehead, with the offense designated, nor condemn the child to the bed all day - an admirable prescription, by-the-way, for those who sleep too late in the morning. These are all punishments of leisure, and the labourer cannot exercise them. Is it not wonderful, then, that, as correction is necessarily so"
