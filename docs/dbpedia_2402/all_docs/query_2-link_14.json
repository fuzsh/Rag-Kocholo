        "text": "A third Melbourne school has been caught up in a student ranking scandal.\n\nBrentwood Secondary College in Glen Waverley has launched an investigation after a photo was taken of a list written on a toilet door in the girl’s bathroom, ranking students who are the “biggest s****”.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Another Melbourne school caught in ranking scandal\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nThe principal of the co-ed public school wasn’t aware of the list until told by 7NEWS on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a statement, principal John Ballagh later said: “Anyone found to have engaged in such behaviour will face immediate disciplinary action”.\n\nThe demeaning and sexist list is the third of its kind to come out of a Melbourne school in the past week.\n\nTwo Yarra Valley Grammar School boys behind a “cruel and highly offensive” spreadsheet that rated their female classmates were expelled last week.\n\nThe spreadsheet used terms including “wifeys”, “cuties”, and “un-rapeable” to describe female students at the Ringwood school.\n\nOn Tuesday, McClelland Secondary College in Frankston said it was investigating a list which ranked female classmates.\n\nIt’s believed the list, found on a computer, was written by a Year 10 boy.\n\nThe mother of a girl on the McClelland Secondary College list told 7NEWS her daughter “doesn’t feel safe”.\n\n“It’s disturbing,” she said.\n\n“I was told it’s a rape and murder list.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, the child was only suspended for a week. If he is to return, half of the girls in Year 10 won’t.”\n\nAnother parent said the student responsible should be expelled.\n\n“I’d expect they’d be expelled from the school, but then how does that fix it?” she said.\n\n“How does that help the child?”\n\nMcClelland College Year 12 student Sienna Parnacott said: “I certainly wouldn’t feel comfortable if that was me.\n\n“Hopefully (the school can) discipline them in the right way so they don’t do it again.”\n\nVictoria Police is still considering whether it will step in."
