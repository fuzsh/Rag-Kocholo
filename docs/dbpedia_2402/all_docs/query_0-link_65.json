        "text": "One of today’s Legends of Auburn is Denny Renahan, who brought me the idea for today’s piece about the Auburn Maroons. Denny is a former city foul shooting champ and a prison guard. He also worked with me at Sears, and he was also a well-known bartender at Riordan’s Restaurant. Denny discovered that in 1897-1898, Auburn had a baseball team in the New York State League called the Auburn Maroons because they wore maroon baseball sox, much like how Boston became the Red Sox and Chicago became the White Sox — because of the colored sox they wore. So Denny has this theory that this might be how Auburn teams were later named the Auburn Maroons.\n\nI was told many years ago that Auburn High School teams got their name from Joseph Huther, who was Auburn High’s director of physical education and athletics from 1932 until 1958. Joe came here from Hamilton, and he secured Colgate’s old football uniforms for the Auburn football team, which were maroon & grey at that time, and that’s what I was told as to how the Maroons got their name.\n\nBut irregardless of how it came about, “Our Maroons” can use a lot of our community support.\n\nPerhaps one of Joe Huther and his wife Cornelia’s greatest gifts to the Auburn Maroons was their son, Bill, an Auburn Maroon hall of famer. I had the honor of playing sports with him and he was truly the living proof of the old adage, “The apple does not fall far from the tree.” Like his father Joe, Bill played not only sports, but the game of life exactly like it should be played.\n\nJoe and Bill Huther are walking billboards for the good morals and sportsmanship of a wonderful era that, unfortunately, is in the past. Respect can’t be given, it must be earned, and the father-son Huther team not only earned it, but led by examples their whole careers.\n\nBack in our era they used to have dances that were held at Central High after the basketball games, and in fact that was where I met my wife. I recall how Joe Huther was standing above the dance floor on the balcony, with a microphone, and he suddenly turned the lights on and announced that everyone there was dancing too close to each other, and if it didn’t stop, the lights would come back on and the dance would be over. Could you imagine seeing Joe Huther in the same situation in today’s era, with our kids and grandkids!\n\nHere is a poem that Joseph Huther wrote at Colgate in 1929 titled “To be a Man”:\n\n\"Help me in all life’s games to play\n\nSo those with whom I’m matched might say,\n\n'There’s a Man who to the core\n\nIs clean and fair, and furthermore\n\nIt makes no difference win or lose\n\nHe’s the kind of a friend that one would choose.'\n\nLet me victory to attain\n\nIf by my strength and skill I can\n\nI’ll heed the rules and play my best\n\nAnd whether I fail or pass the test\n\nLet me not myself disgrace\n\nI’ll be a Man in either case.\n\nI do not want to steal the show,\n\nBut rather that the team would know\n\nThat I am with them every minute\n\nIn the game to help them win it.\n\nI want to do just all I can\n\nTo help myself – to be a Man.\n\nI want opponents at their peak\n\nIf full benefits I would seek.\n\nFor I know that satisfaction\n\nIs in proportion to the action,\n\nThat it takes from mind and muscle\n\nIn a tense and even tussle.\n\nShould I win I will not boast\n\nBut to them all I’d give a toast\n\n'Here’s to my teammates and opponents\n\nWho helped me in these passing moments\n\nTo make my life a greater pleasure\n\nBy closer to a Man to measure.'\n\nIf I should lose I’ll not complain\n\nI’ll do the thing I know is sane,\n\nCongratulate the team which won\n\nAnd then as soon as that is done\n\nI’ll vow next time to do e’en more\n\nTo be a Man and help my score.\n\nIn closing, it really doesn’t matter whether we were named the Auburn Maroons in 1897-98 or in 1932. Our Maroons deserve our support at every sporting event. When we held Maroon Fever here in Auburn we put 7,000 Maroon fans and supporters in the stadium, so it can be done, and our kids deserve it. It sure beats watching TV or playing with the computer.\n\nOrmie King's column appears Sundays in The Citizen and he can be reached by email at ormieking@yahoo.com.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
