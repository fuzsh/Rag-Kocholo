        "text": "Another Melbourne school is investigating an “offensive list” created by Year 9 students to rank female classmates.\n\nVictoria Police said detectives became aware of the list being circulated at McClelland Secondary College in Frankston on Friday.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Police investigate another ranking list scandal at Melbourne school.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\n“Police have engaged with the school to assess the information and ensure students are adequately supported,” a spokesperson said.\n\n“As there have not been any formal complaints at this stage, investigators are yet to determine future involvement.”\n\nActing principal Laura Spence said she was “very grateful to the students who immediately brought the matter to my attention”.\n\n“The safety and wellbeing of our students is an absolute top priority for us, and we are supporting the students impacted by this behaviour,” she said.\n\n“We have already taken disciplinary action and will consider any further steps when the full facts of this incident have been established.”\n\nThe Victorian Department of Education said the school had “rightly taken swift action”.\n\n“Misogynistic and disrespectful behaviour is entirely unacceptable in any Victorian school and the school has rightly taken swift action,” a spokesperson said.\n\n“More than 1950 Victorian government, Catholic and independent schools are signed up to the Respectful Relationships initiative, supporting them to embed respect and gender equality across their entire school community and stamp out these vile attitudes to women.\n\n“We all have a responsibility to teach students respect and we’ll continue to invest in programs that promote gender equality to embed those attitudes.\n\n“We are grateful to the students who immediately brought the matter to the attention of the school.”\n\n‘Cruel’ trend\n\nTwo students at Yarra Valley Grammar School in Ringwood were expelled earlier this month after producing a “cruel and highly offensive” spreadsheet that rated their female classmates by looks.\n\nFour year 11 students were initially suspended after the list was posted online, and discovered by the school on May 1.\n\nThe spreadsheet used terms including “wifeys”, “cuties”, and “unrapeable” to describe female students.\n\nPrincipal Dr Mark Merry said support had been offered to students who were impacted by the spreadsheet.\n\n“I am saddened that the actions of a few individuals can cause so much harm as social media has the power to amplify the damage that can be done and the anguish inflicted,” he said.\n\n“This needs to be a learning moment for all of us.”"
