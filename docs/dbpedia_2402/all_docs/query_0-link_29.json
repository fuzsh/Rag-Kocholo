        "text": "I dropped flat on the 13th tee box at Karsten Creek Golf Club, the sun beating down on my face. My water bottle dried up somewhere after the turn and my mouth was full of cotton. Dizzy but conscious, I crawled over to a patch of three-inch rough shaded by the thick grove of oaks.\n\nThis was it, I thought. I’m going to die right here – 21 years old… alone… on this damn tee box… on this damn course I had no business playing in the first place. My last thoughts weren’t about my family. They were spent recounting how in the hell I got here…\n\nAs the club’s transportation specialist (cart barn boy), I was lucky enough to enjoy playing privileges. And for some reason on this late July afternoon, yours truly decided to walk the course alone. Teeing off just after lunch, the front nine went as planned. I took full advantage of the water coolers strategically tucked away along the cart paths.\n\nBut somewhere around the turn (a quarter of a mile walk up a hill and around the corner at Karsten), I started to feel it. I was in the best shape of my life, but no amount of hydration could save me on this day. Instead of calling it after nine, I stupidly pushed on. Around the 11th and 12th holes along the creek, the humidity is oppressive. A hundred yards and 20 vertical feet from the 12th green to the 13th tee was the straw that broke my back.\n\nMaybe if I survive here long enough, a member might stumble upon me. Maybe it’ll be one of the guys or gals on the Oklahoma State golf team, who – after laughing at this pathetic sight – can call up to the clubhouse and send a cart (or an ambulance) for me.\n\nThirty minutes and no passersby later, I’d recovered enough to stand on my own two feet. I finished the 13th, then took the maintenance shortcut straight back to the clubhouse. Karsten may have won that battle, but I survived to see another day.\n\nSince that time, I’ve been wary of walking a golf course. Not that I don’t do it – but I’m often suspicious of those psychopaths who exclusively shun carts. They probably wear socks to bed, too. How am I supposed to enjoy a round if I’m barely surviving it?\n\nMark Twain once famously claimed, “golf is a good walk spoiled.” Posthumously, that is, until the quippy line was discovered to have been attributed to no less than seven others. No matter the origin of the quote, its spirit rings true in this author’s bones.\n\nIn a game full of choices (shorts or pants, send it or lay up, Caesar wrap or hotdog at the turn), the first – and possibly most important – choice of the day is encountered from the onset.\n\nFor me, a husky fellow who is riddled with creaky knees from years of church league basketball, that answer is easier than most – if a cart is available, you’ll probably find me in it. But there are many “purists” out there who would admonish me for such a decision.\n\n“You’re lazy,” they may chide, never knowing the hurtful impact of their slanderous statements.\n\n(Laziness is subjective. Energy levels, however, are objective according to the laws of quantum mechanics, and I choose to conserve mine for the far more important decision of never laying up.)\n\nAnd while these pretentious folks sashay about the golf course on their fleet feet, I choose to take the high road. Because at the end of the day, it’s a choice. MY choice. Whether to survive the walk, or to thrive in my game.\n\nBut HOW do you choose? Some may want to walk, but are afraid they may regret the choice somewhere deep in the round. After years of struggling with this myself, I developed a proprietary algorithm that helps me answer that question before I ever get off the couch.\n\nEnter: The Walkability Index\n\nThe ties between Shangri-La and Oklahoma’s political landscape run deep. In 1977, the resort hosted the Midwestern Governors’ Conference. Oklahoma Lt. Gov. George Nigh acted as master of ceremonies for the three-day event, showcasing the resort and its various amenities. Following the event, journalist John Young stated, “The setting, on Grand Lake O’ The Cherokees, undoubtedly was a pleasant surprise to visitors unfamiliar with Oklahoma… It was surely a big plus for the state’s effort to upgrade its tourism industry.”\n\nThe positive reaction of the event lingered as five years later, Shangri-La was once again chosen to showcase itself on the national stage.\n\nNigh, now the Governor of the State of Oklahoma, convinced the National Governors’ Conference to hold their annual meetings at the resort in 1982. Davis pulled an additional $25 million in resources together to expand and improve facilities in advance of the event. Attendees included Pierre S. du Pont IV of Delaware, Bill Clements of Texas and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia. In all, 41 governors from around the United States attended the conference on Monkey Island.\n\nIf the National Governors’ Conference of 1982 was a high point for the resort, then the ensuing three decades were a roller coaster. Falling into bankruptcy in 1986, the property changed hands multiple times and much of its assets fell into disrepair. Shangri-La became merely a distant memory to many who had once held her in such high regard.\n\nEnter Eddie Gibbs.\n\nIn early 2010, the fence magnate purchased the property with one goal in mind – to create a world-class golf resort at Grand Lake. Within 15 months, Gibbs and his team had begun to revitalize the Championship Blue Course and built the towering 13,000-square-foot clubhouse. By the end of 2011, The Champions Nine was open for play. By the summer of 2013, Shangri-La boasted 27 holes of Championship golf.\n\n“One of the reasons we champion the efforts at Shangri-La is Eddie Gibbs’ investment back into a gem of a property inside the state of Oklahoma,” Pinnell said. “We’re always trying to highlight entrepreneurs and developers who take a tourism attraction that may have been hot decades ago and revitalize them. If you build it; they will come. If you demand more than just being ‘OK’, then Oklahoma taxpayers will reward that effort.”\n\nIt's because of Gibbs’ efforts to revitalize a place that holds historic value to the state of Oklahoma that Pinnell is excited to host his golf tournament there each year.\n\n“I hear stories of people who come to my tournament who haven’t been to Shangri-La in decades or have never even been to Grand Lake before. I love hearing that someone came to my tournament and then tell me that they brought their wife or their family out there the next weekend.”\n\nPinnell has served as Oklahoma’s lieutenant governor since 2019. But when asked about his day-to-day, you might be surprised by the answer.\n\n“The lieutenant governor position is a blank slate – it’s kind of what you make it,” Pinnell says. “I ran on a platform of tourism four years ago and we won all 77 counties because of that.”\n\nHe compares his platform to that of Nigh, who in 1958 became the youngest lieutenant governor in state history at age 31. During his tenure, he was noted to be Oklahoma’s greatest cheerleader, pushing the state’s agenda of tourism. As a state legislator, he introduced a bill to make “Oklahoma!” the state song. He was also known to entice movie producers to film on location in Oklahoma. During his time in public office, Nigh saw films such as “Where the Red Fern Grows,” “Rumble Fish” and “The Outsiders” filmed in Oklahoma.\n\n“He was – and still is – one of the best promoters and champions of our state,” Pinnell said. “And that shouldn’t be discounted. We need somebody in the Executive Branch who understands sales and marketing, because if we don’t define who we are as a state, then 49 other states will define it for us.”\n\nThat’s the main reason why Pinnell wanted so badly to hit the ground running. One of his first efforts as lieutenant governor was to establish a consistent brand for the state of Oklahoma. This project brought together some of Oklahoma’s brightest and forward-thinking minds in marketing, sales and communications to develop a visual and verbal identity that the state could utilize. The result can be found on welcome signs at every major highway that enters and exits Oklahoma, on agency websites and on buildings around the state.\n\n“When we came in, we realized the wide perception from people outside our state is ‘Oklahoma is a flat dust bowl,’ and nothing could be further from the truth. But most people didn’t know that because we weren’t promoting a positive, diverse brand. So we got 200 Oklahomans together for a volunteer-led effort to identify that brand.”\n\nOn the heels of the new brand came none other than a worldwide pandemic. For Pinnell, he saw a tremendous opportunity. His team launched #OKHereWeGo, a digital campaign designed to market Oklahoma’s outdoor assets, from hiking and camping to fishing and – of course – golf.\n\n“That gave us an opportunity to show people what was 30 minutes outside their door,” Pinnell said. “From golf courses to state park trails, a lot of people were looking for things to do. Out of a crisis, sometimes there are positives, and I think one of those was Oklahomans got outside again.”\n\nSuddenly, like a mirage against the endless expanse of Southern Great Plains savanna, a heavily timbered spread rises on the horizon. Thickets of invasive eastern red cedars have overtaken much of the vegetation, but remnants of the area remain. Unique rock formations. Sandsage grassland. Dust Bowl-Era constructions. A steady flow of crystal-clear water bubbling from the ground.\n\nArcheological evidence estimates that humans have inhabited this region of Oklahoma for more than 14,000 years. Bone scatter along the nearby Beaver River suggests that Paleoindians used the region as a kill site, driving hundreds of American bison off cliffs and into “arroyo traps,” spearing and butchering the noble brutes for every available resource.\n\nThe first written record of this area appears as early as 1541, when Spanish explorer Francisco Vazquez de Coronado visited in search of the “Seven Cities of Gold.” A century later, Juan de Oñate reported Indian encampments along the cool, natural springs. A fur trading post was established in 1823 by U.S. Cavalry General Thomas James, and pioneers began flocking to the area.\n\nIn 1868, as Young Tom defeated Old Tom by three strokes in the ninth playing of The Open Championship at Prestwick, Col. George Custer set up camp on the other end of the county at Fort Supply. From there, he would plan and execute his government-endorsed annihilation of Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne camp on the banks of the Washita River.\n\nBut it wasn’t until 1935 – on the cusp of the greatest human-influenced natural disaster – that Boiling Springs State Park began to take shape. On the backs of 350 men in Company 2822 of President Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps in the throes of the Dust Bowl, the park began to form. In the span of four years, through torrential dust storms and record heat, these men labored day and night moving rocks and establishing this oasis at the doorstep of No Man’s Land.\n\nThis land requires resilience. Naturally exposed to classic American Interior Plains elements, record temperatures in the area range nearly 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Hail the size of baseballs is common in the spring. In 1947, a 1.8-mile-wide tornado hit the nearby town of Woodward. At 8:42 p.m., the twister – which had traveled for nearly 100 miles to this point – entered city limits. In moments, 100 city blocks were wiped to their foundations. More than 1,000 homes and businesses were destroyed. In Woodward alone, 107 people were killed and 1,000 injured.\n\nThe state park is situated on the banks of the North Canadian River, which separates the Anadarko Shelf from the Anadarko Basin. Along the river’s corridor, rock formations date from the Cenozoic Era – more than 66 million years ago. Doe Creek Limestone serves as bedrock for collecting ground water. Once the underground water meets the topography of the land, a natural spring is formed.\n\nThey’re called “boiling springs” not because of the heat – they are in fact quite cool – but rather the way the water bubbles up from the earth. While you’re not here for a science lesson, it’s important to understand this phenomenon. Because instead of the hard clay soil Oklahomans know all too well, these springs beget a soft, sandy loam.\n\nYou see, here’s the thing about people who hold the title of “Championship Director” for the PGA of America. These are the guys and girls who have the golden ticket - a conspicuous “All-Access” logo on their credentials, sporting hats and shirts that you’ll never find in a souvenir shop and jetting around world-class courses in their topless Club Cars while the golf world graciously takes in the fruits of their labor. They’re golf royalty when it comes to the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup.\n\nIt sounds badass – and much of it is – but there’s another side to this job you need to know about. What that All-Access badge or the media recognition or the rubbing of elbows with some of the most powerful people in golf don’t reveal is the tireless (and often tiresome) work they put in over the last two years and beyond. They don’t show the double-wide trailer they call an office tucked away in the back corner of some of the most coveted acreage in the country. And they don’t offer a glimpse into the scheduled moves across the country every two years to start over and do it all again.\n\nThat's why here and now, Bryan Karns is the luckiest man in the world.\n\nYou see, Bryan is an Oklahoma kid. Diplomas from Stillwater High School and Oklahoma State University hang on his wall. His wife is an Owasso Ram. And for someone who’s spent an entire career moving his family to Chicago and Washington D.C. and Louisville (twice) and Rochester, New York and French Lick, Indiana, it’s nice to be back home.\n\nGolf wasn’t necessarily in the stars for Bryan growing up. He did play junior golf at Stillwater Country Club, a 1966 Donald Sechrest design. In 1994, his dad brought him to Southern Hills for the 76th PGA Championship.\n\n“That was a pretty seminal moment for me growing up,” Karns said.\n\nHis closest connection to the game growing up came from his uncle, Lynn Blevins. Coming from a generations-deep Oklahoma State family, Blevins was the oddball – signing with the University of Oklahoma to play golf. That set up a career in the game – first coaching, then managing golf courses, then coaching again. His stops have included Regis University, Rogers State University, the University of Florida, the University of Iowa and his very first job – coaching his alma mater for three seasons beginning in 1979.\n\n“He’s always been a PGA professional so it’s cool for me to have always had a connection to an actual PGA pro.”\n\nBut Karns was never good enough to play competitively (his words). An amateur sportsman in his younger years, golf just wasn’t a natural fit. When he enrolled at Oklahoma State University, though, he knew a career in athletics was calling his name. At the time, the school didn’t offer a sports management or sports media program, so Bryan studied the next best thing – journalism.\n\n“My first real experience working in sports was as a sophomore at OSU. I had a deal with a couple of local papers. When their teams would come play in Stillwater, they would call me and I’d go out to take a few photos and write a recap for them.”\n\nThat initial experience led to a position with the university’s century-old newspaper, The Daily O’Collegian. Whatever high he was riding from seeing his byline in the school paper, it was swiftly and certainly squashed with his first assignment.\n\n“I started out on the beat for Mike Gundy’s first spring and first season as head football coach. And that was a nightmare season. As much as I was a homer, it became increasingly difficult to write objective storylines.”\n\n(In 2005, Oklahoma State finished dead last in the Big 12 Southern Division and suffered seven defeats in their last eight games, including a loss to the Texas Longhorns after leading the eventual national champions 28-12 at halftime.)\n\n“It’s such a cool thing to me though,” Karns remarked. “If you’re an O’Colly writer, the access you get and confidence you get for being able to walk into a press room or go up to an athlete or coach and ask questions – that’s huge.”\n\nHis time with the Daily O’Collegian led into a position as a student sports information director for the OSU Athletics media relations office. It was here that Bryan seriously began considering career opportunities in sports.\n\n“As a student SID in the summertime, there’s not much to do and I was looking to add to my résumé, so I found an internship posting outside of the Classroom Building on campus advertising a hospitality internship with the PGA of America.”\n\nBy this time, it was 2007 and the PGA Championship was scheduled to be back at Southern Hills.\n\n“Part of what was so incredible about ’07 was you’ve got Tiger winning and the energy and the atmosphere was just unreal. You know, whoever is going to win is great, but Tiger is just different. When Tiger is associated with your club, it just means a little bit more. When he won, somehow I ended up in the ballroom when he was doing his Champions Toast and that was when I knew that I needed to keep doing this.”\n\nWhen he went back to Stillwater that fall, he knew he wanted to stay in touch. He worked his way into a year-long gig at the 2008 Ryder Cup at Valhalla, where a rag-tag bunch of Americans (J.B. Holmes, Kenny Perry and Anthony Kim, anyone?) pulled off a miracle over a world-class European team.\n\nFollowing that eye-opening experience in Louisville, he returned home once more to finish his master’s degree at Oklahoma State before taking a job with the Tulsa Shock – the WNBA franchise relocated from Detroit. With legendary head coach Nolan Richardson at the helm and Olympic gold medalist sprinter former UNC Tarheel point guard Marion Jones coming off the bench, the Shock won six games in their first season…out of 34.\n\n“That’s a great talking point when you’re talking to people from Tulsa. They’re like, ‘you remember the Shock?!’ It was a grind but it showed me here’s one extreme and then there’s the other when it comes to job satisfaction. I remember when I interviewed to get back with the PGA, the guy that hired me said, ‘If you can sell that product in Tulsa, you can probably sell anything.’”\n\nDuring the second half of 2010, Bryan was hired on to work the 2012 Ryder Cup. Following the American team’s meltdown at Medinah, he returned to Louisville to begin working on the 2014 PGA Championship in a corporate hospitality/marketing role. It was on the grounds of Valhalla Golf Club that he decided to work toward becoming a championship director.\n\n“If you go and talk to most people on our staff, their goal professionally is to become a champ director. And they come from all different backgrounds. You have to be willing to be out in front and speak publicly. Not everyone is totally wired for it, but that’s the goal.”\n\nAfter a year of selling corporate hospitality, the PGA of America signed a deal with French Lick Resort in Indiana to host the 2015 Senior PGA Championship. Louisville was the closest market to the resort and the team had done so well selling out Valhalla that Karns got his shot. He successfully operated the event in a town of 1,500 people and earned the same role for the 2017 Senior PGA Championship at Trump National Golf Club in Washington D.C.\n\n“Both of those events were totally different for several reasons, but both were great because it prepared me for so many things. In the spring of 2017, I was kind of at a crossroads. Once you get into the champ director role, you say ‘alright I’m happy to do a Senior PGA, but now I want to do a PGA.”\n\nThere’s not much more to write about COVID-19 that hasn’t already been written. We remember the details vividly. On March 11, 2020 NBA superstar Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. Within minutes, his team’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder was postponed.\n\nWithin days, the entire world was shut down.\n\nPlanet earth was living in a scene from Contagion.\n\nNo one knew what was happening. No one knew if they were safe. No one knew if life would ever be the same.\n\nThe PGA Tour Champions shut down for five months. The 2020 Senior PGA Championship – scheduled for May of 2020 in Benton Harbor, Michigan – was canceled. Even into the first weeks of 2021, Karns and his team were scrambling in Tulsa.\n\n“We got to January and were thinking this is brutal because everything we wanted to do from a tent standpoint, the City of Tulsa Health Department wouldn’t sign off on it,” Karns said. “There were also companies who were saying they couldn’t invite people because of their new corporate entertainment policies.”\n\nThen January 6 happened. Call it what you want – we’re not here to get political – but there was an immediate backlash on properties owned by the former POTUS. Within 96 hours, the PGA of America announced that the 2022 PGA Championship would not be played at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey. And that’s when Karns really got to work.\n\n“The first moment (it was announced), I picked up the phone and called Nick (Sidorakis),” Karns said. “Here’s this perfect pivot. We can go to all these companies that have committed a record amount for the Senior PGA Championship and say, ‘if we were able to get the PGA Championship, would you commit?’ This would allow us to move a lot of hospitality to 2022 and give us an opportunity to offer some hospitality at the Senior PGA in the form of open-air structures and things like that. And within 48 hours we had enough commitments that when the potential venues were being evaluated, it was a no-brainer.”\n\nBy the end of the month, we would know the fate of the 2022 PGA Championship. Before Tiger’s wreck; before Phil’s triumph at The Ocean Course and subsequent self-imposed downfall a handful of months later, Southern Hills was once again in the spotlight of the golf world.\n\nMuch has been told about the life and legacy of Frank Phillips in Oklahoma. About his early employment as a barber, first in Iowa, then Aspen, then Ogden. About his rise to power drilling black gold out of the Osage hills. About his partnership with brothers L.E. and Waite on various enterprises. About the legendary Phillips Ranch southwest of town, a 17,000-acre domain filled with exotic species from every corner of the earth.\n\nOur story begins not with the rise, but in the prime of Phillips’ wealth and influence.\n\nAs the earliest days of oil boomed and Bartlesville swelled, the need for recreation in the area became apparent. The first mentions of a country club came in early 1908, when E.F. Blaise formed a committee of interested parties. Judge J.J. Shea was appointed to organize the club, with stock dues valued at $100 per share. On December 11, 1908, the Bartlesville Country Club was incorporated, with plans to lay out golf links the following year. Frank Phillips was elected as an inaugural officer of the club. Almost immediately, however, the club ran into roadblocks. By March of 1910, the officers and membership had still not settled on a permanent home. This matter would linger another year before firm plans were decided on.\n\nIt wasn’t until March of 1911 that L.E. Phillips claimed, “I have found the most available spot in the country for a country club.” Upon his suggestion and the approval of the club’s officers, plans for the first golf course in Bartlesville were laid. An organization comprised of stockholding members purchased a parcel of land from Pawhuska’s Paul Mason. The allotment was three-quarters of a mile west of the Osage / Washington County border line, on the Pawhuska Road (present-day Frank Phillips Boulevard). The site was “just beyond the mound,” near the present-day Bartlesville Municipal Airport. The club, which hired the services of Scottish-born George C. Fernie of Independence Country Club to lay out the course. L.E. served on the club’s original Board of Directors and was charged with traveling to Kansas City to gather ideas for the construction of a clubhouse. When bids for the construction were reviewed, the contract was awarded to local firm Hatcher and Moffet at the price of $4,200. On Wednesday, Nov. 29, 1911, the game of golf in Bartlesville was born. Invitations to the opening ceremonies were sent to delegates as far as Muskogee and Independence, Kansas. In preparation of the festivities, the Morning Examiner noted, “The ground (is) shaved, shampooed and manicured, so to speak, and a golf expert has laid out the links which have been pronounced by those who know to be the most perfect and complete in the entire southwest.”\n\nOriginal members of Bartlesville Country Club included Huntington B. Henry of Henry Oil and Gas Company, Henry Vernon Foster of the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company, attorney John H. Kane, judge J.J. Shea and of course, the three Phillips brothers – Frank, L.E. and Waite.\n\nThis original nine-hole, par 35 track featured one water hazard off the first hole and five mounded bunkers (some with sand in them). As it was outside city limits, Judge Shea offered his car as public transportation to the club.\n\nThe honeymoon between the club and its members was short, however. Less than five months following the grand celebration, the club required $20,000 in improvements to the grounds, golf course, clubhouse and furnishings. What took less than $5,000 to create now ballooned in cost. By the summer of 1912, William Brown, another Scot, had been hired to take over as the club professional. Golf course maintenance was by committee, and the membership added bunkers on the seventh and ninth holes. The track stretched to 3,100 yards and the greens were covered with “well-oiled sand.”\n\nThe next few years proved rocky for Bartlesville’s first club. As it was outside city limits, the site demonstrated to be significant effort visit on a nice day, and nearly impossible with rain or other inclement weather in the forecast. Financial concerns of upkeep mounted, and membership began to hemorrhage. By June of 1915, what remained of the membership began discussions of moving the club to a more appropriate and accessible site near Tuxedo Park. Instead, it was decided that the Bartlesville Interurban Railway would run a route out to the site of the club and it would be reorganized as the Oak Hill Club. Frank, as an elected member of the Interurban’s board of directors, was integral in the establishment of this line.\n\nIt was also during this time that Frank began to show interest and leadership in the club. When a committee representing Henry Latham Doherty’s Cities Service Company – which would later become the Citgo Corporation – visited town, a luncheon in their honor was to be held at the club. When inclement weather washed out their plans, Frank offered his home on Cherokee Avenue to host the event on short notice. Doherty’s representatives were impressed that one could host nearly 70 men on short notice without importing so much as a single piece of silverware.\n\nBy the early 1920s, the road to the club had once again fallen in disrepair, but Oak Hill was thriving. Local newspapers were filled with notices of dinner parties and other fine affairs at the club. Ed Dudley had taken over at Oak Hill as head professional, coming from a similar position at Miami, Oklahoma’s Rockdale Country Club. He would spend three or four years in Bartlesville, marrying the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W.F. Johnson before becoming the head professional at Pawhuska Country Club. Dudley would go on to have a successful career in golf, winning the Oklahoma Open twice, finishing his career with 11 Top-10 finishes in major championships and boasting a 3-1 record in Ryder Cup matches. Off the course, he would accept a position to be the head professional at Oklahoma City Golf and Country Club before answering the call to be the first professional at Bobby Jones’ Augusta National Golf Club in 1932, a position he would hold until 1957.\n\nHis golden goose, though, was his unique style of integrating golf and prop bets. He taught himself the game at a young age, and was blessed with both extraordinary eyesight and an ambidextrous swing. Armed with this skill, he would travel from club to club across the country, towing young, prodigious talent with him. He would seek out the best golfers with the fattest wallets and challenge them to a big-money round. “I’ll bet my caddy and I can beat your two best guys!” he would say. Some of his “caddies” throughout the years included a young Ben Hogan, Herman Keiser and Lee Elder.\n\nIt was said that Titanic killed five men in his life, none of which he spent time in prison for murder. In 1928, he was playing in the high stakes poker game that left Arnold Rothstein – the boss of the Jewish mob and the man who fixed the 1919 World Series – murdered for debts he incurred during the game.\n\nAnd so it was this smooth-talking, blood-thirsty gambler from the Ozarks who was drooling at the prospects of easy money at the hands of Bartlesville’s wealthiest socialites. Armed with his golf clubs and a young boy named Ky Laffoon, Titanic would come to Hillcrest at least three times for some healthy competition.\n\nIn May of 1931, Thompson and a 23-year-old Laffoon arrived at the club for their first match with head professional Jimmy Gullane and city amateur champion V.T. Broaddus. More than 200 spectators followed as they watched the visitors take down the celebrated Bartians, 2 and 1. The rumored side bet was more than $5,000. Laffoon would go on to have a celebrated career in golf, participating on the 1935 Ryder Cup team and finishing with 12 Top Ten finishes in major championships.\n\nOne night during their barnstorming tour through Bartlesville, Thompson hooked up with John Phillips in a high stakes card game at the elegant Maire Hotel at the corner of 4th and Johnstone. The Maire, built to host clientele and dignitaries of the city’s barons, was celebrated across the state for its one-of-a-kind chandeliers, ceiling fans and electricity. The hotel was rivaled in Oklahoma by only The Mayo in Tulsa and The Skirvin in Oklahoma City. As if Thompson needed an easier target that night, Phillips – ever tormented by his thirst – was polishing off a bottle of 90-proof bootleg bourbon. It wasn’t long before Thompson had wiped out all the cash John had on hand in the game of Seven Card Stud, but Phillips – blinded by the bottle – wasn’t ready to give up easy. On what would be the final hand, he put up the deed to his house on Cherokee Ave., the one Frank had built for John, his bride and his family. The cards were dealt, and John never stood a chance. Titanic Thompson walked away that night with a pocket full of cash and the deed to the Phillips house.\n\nWhen Frank heard about the fiasco, he was livid. Despite the gambler’s killer reputation, the elder Phillips approach him with an offer he couldn’t refuse. He bought the house back from Thompson on the condition that he never approach John Phillips again. When the deal was done, Frank put the title to the house not in his son’s name, but his six-month-old grandson’s.\n\nThompson would continue to return to Hillcrest for years to come, but he never again tried to go after the gullible John G. Phillips.\n\nWe take in our first notes of the pinot and ask Talor to start from the beginning. Long before the wine and the orange and black, Talor was your typical Oklahoma kid, just trying to make it at John Conrad Regional Golf Course.\n\n“My dad was in the car business when I was growing up and he’d work six days a week, but on Sundays he would go golf with his three brothers and he would take me out there with them so he was literally out there changing my diapers on the golf course,” Talor said.\n\nWhen his parents were working, he often let John Conrad be his babysitter.\n\n“I grew up literally across the street from the course. There were times when I would just walk down there and spend all day playing. They had this practice green they called ‘Old No. 8’. It was kind of their nursery green but it had an extended fairway leading up to it, so basically inside 80 yards, I just had the run of the place. I didn’t want to go pay two bucks for a bucket of balls every time, so I spent a lot of time bringing my own shag bag and getting a lot of work in there.”\n\nIt was on tracks like Conrad, Lincoln Park and Lake Hefner that the young golfer grew his game. Fighting through the Oklahoma wind and hardpan, he honed his putter and short irons. The emphasis on his short game worked out, winning 19 individual titles in 40 career events and a state championship in his time as a Carl Albert Titan. More impressively, he was making a name for himself on a larger scale, winning his first national tournament as early as nine years old.\n\nBut it wasn’t until he arrived in Stillwater – and Karsten Creek – that his game began to fully develop.\n\n“Walking around Karsten every day, you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. There are a lot of shots that won’t sit well to your eye and you just have to overcome that. When you’re not comfortable with a situation, Karsten forces you to just man up and hit a good golf shot. The par fives are gettable, but a lot of the par fours can play really long and tough, so you have to be pretty precise with your mid-long irons.”\n\nThe wind, the rough and the long walks drove his pursuit for excellence. On a team stacked with All-Americans, Talor managed to start all 13 events as a true freshman. Peaking at the right time, he had his best finish of the year – a tie for third – at the NCAA Regional in Colorado. But the pressure was building for the top-ranked Cowboys, and they were coming home to host the National Championships.\n\n“The previous year, we had lost in the finals and had all but one of our starters returning. In 2011, it was pass or fail. We were easily the best team in the country and you could absolutely feel the pressure. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a great week as a team.”\n\nAfter years of relentless work on mini tours and Q-School, Talor has solidified his position as a PGA Tour member and one of the elite golfers on the planet.\n\n“It’s so cliché, but it’s been a journey,” he said, swirling the wine in his glass and unlocking the warm, expressive aromas. “I’ll never forget the first Q-School I competed in, I played with a guy who was 40-something with a couple kids and this dude is out here grinding. It made me realize that I used to think I worked hard, but this guy is out here and if he doesn’t succeed, his kids don’t get fed.”\n\n“I used to just put the time in and thought I was working hard and things were going to happen. But then it became a balance of everything being tailored to performing at my best, but also not allowing the game to become my identity.”\n\nTalor is grateful for the grind, though.\n\n“I’m so thankful that it took time to get where we are now, because I was not prepared as a person to be on the PGA Tour. I would not have been able to sustain any success at this level, because my life was not ready for it. It’s incredible to see what Viktor and Matt and Morikawa are doing with their sustained success, because when you get out to the Tour it takes a lot more than just hitting a great golf shot.”\n\nWith a few years on Tour under his belt, the processes and competition levels are becoming more comfortable to Talor, and that’s apparent in his recent finishes: a top 15 at The Genesis Invitational and three top fives since October, most recently at THE PLAYERS. For the most part, he’s traded in his grind at John Conrad for more appropriate practice facilities at Oak Tree National and Gaillardia Country Club. But the boy from Midwest City stays true to his roots. When he’s home, it’s all about Braum’s burgers and beer rounds with the boys.\n\nWith the night running long and their Ted’s Café Escondido delivery getting cold in the kitchen, it was time to wrap things up. But I had one more question – I was curious why Talor didn’t follow the Tour trend of moving to some exotic location like Jupiter or Scottsdale or somewhere income tax doesn’t exist.\n\n“When I’m not traveling, I want to be with my family and friends. This will always be home to me.”\n\nThe first 15 years of the club saw dramatic changes. Originally sand surface greens, they introduced bermuda grass in 1924 and bent grass in 1930. In 1937, deep in the grip of the Great Depression, the club called on Oklahoma’s own Perry Maxwell to rebuild seven of the putting surfaces, who had just completed work on six others at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.\n\nDespite the brilliance and stature of two of the world’s greatest golf architects, the club couldn’t escape the bust of the Depression and World War II. In 1944, Oakhurst was foreclosed on and purchased for $38,600, a mere fraction of the nearly half a million dollars for which it was created just two decades earlier.\n\nOver the years, the track on the hill in southwest Tulsa now known as Oaks Country Club has served as a paramount example of A.W. Tillinghast’s work. Known for his vehement belief of marrying the game to the land on which it is played, Oaks stands unique, even to his other local body of work just seven miles north on the other side of the Arkansas River.\n\nDespite his highly held belief that each course should be unique in its own skin, there are several iconic “Tillie Terrors” that paint the landscape of Oaks Country Club, most notably his elevated greens, closely guarded by deep, imposing bunkers. Tee boxes blend to the natural surroundings and offer a variety of angles, another Tillinghast staple.\n\nAccording to the architect, “A course stands or falls through the character of its one-shot holes.” This statement is such that a round at Oaks Country Club could be considered a success or a failure by the time you putt out at the sixth hole. Nestled in the far northeast corner of the property, this downhill Par 3 is the embodiment of Tillinghast’s iconic “Tiny Tim” golf holes. Stretching to 133 yards at the back of the Tour Tees, you are faced with disaster on all sides of the putting surface. A miss to the left will undoubtedly find the sand with a touchy look back toward a severe false front. Testing the front and right side of the green will either fall off into a collection area or – more than likely – a treacherous pot bunker. Anything long and you’ll be flirting with out-of-bounds."
