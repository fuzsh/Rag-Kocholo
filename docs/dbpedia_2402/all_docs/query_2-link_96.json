        "text": "An online petition detailing thousands of graphic incidents of sexual assault and rape against high school students has ballooned, with at least 50 Victorian private, Catholic and public schools now mentioned.\n\nThe petition launched a fortnight ago by former Sydney schoolgirl Chanel Contos is gaining momentum, with schools and state governments now being forced to address the distressing accounts of assault.\n\nBy Wednesday night, Ms Contos’ website, teachusconsent.com, had amassed more than 2900 anonymised testimonies by former and current high school students — overwhelmingly girls and women — across the country.\n\nIn the first week of its existence, the website and petition, which calls for mandatory consent education to be taught at a younger age, focused on stories of sexual assault and rape against students from private schools in Sydney. But now the harrowing accounts, which are untested, have named public schools in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria.\n\nAmong the testimonies are from students from Our Lady of Mercy College in Heidelberg, Geelong Grammar, Princes Hill Secondary College, Yarra Valley Grammar, Geelong High School, Emmanuel College in Point Cook, Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College in Geelong, Monbulk College, Oxley College, Cathedral College in Wangaratta, St Columba’s College in Essendon, Upwey High School, St Leonard’s College in Melbourne, Canterbury Girls Secondary College, Mentone Girls Secondary College, Eltham College, Chaffey Secondary College in Mildura, Strathmore Secondary College, Ballarat High School, St Catherine’s in Melbourne, Aquinas College in Ringwood, Sacre Cœur in Glen Iris, Salesian College in Sunbury, Emerald Secondary College, Northcote High School, Catholic College Sale, Caulfield Grammar, St Monica’s College in Epping, Mount Evelyn Christian School, Haileybury College, Viewbank College, Melbourne Girls Grammar, St Joseph’s College in Geelong and Methodist Ladies’ College in Kew.\n\nSchools of alleged victims\n\nOur Lady of Mercy College in Heidelberg\n\nGeelong Grammar\n\nPrinces Hill Secondary College\n\nMacRobertson Girls High School\n\nYarra Valley Grammar\n\nGeelong High School\n\nEmmanuel College in Point Cook\n\nMatthew Flinders Girls Secondary College in Geelong\n\nMonbulk College\n\nOxley College\n\nCathedral College in Wangaratta\n\nSt Columba’s College in Essendon\n\nUpwey High School\n\nSt Leonard’s College in Melbourne\n\nCanterbury Girls Secondary College\n\nMentone Girls Secondary College\n\nEltham College\n\nChaffey Secondary College in Mildura\n\nStrathmore Secondary College\n\nBallarat High School\n\nSt Catherine’s in Melbourne\n\nAquinas College in Ringwood\n\nSacre Cœur in Glen Iris\n\nSalesian College in Sunbury\n\nEmerald Secondary College\n\nNorthcote High School\n\nCatholic College Sale\n\nCaulfield Grammar\n\nSt Monica’s College in Epping\n\nMount Evelyn Christian School\n\nHaileybury College\n\nViewbank College\n\nMelbourne Girls Grammar\n\nSt Joseph’s College in Geelong\n\nMethodist Ladies’ College in Kew\n\nSome of the testimonies allege the perpetrators were students of Brighton Secondary College, Melbourne Grammar School, St Kevin’s College, Brighton Secondary College, Berwick Grammar School, Emmanuel College in Altona North, Melbourne Grammar School, Marcellin College in Bulleen, McKinnon Secondary College, Geelong Grammar School, Camberwell High School, Whitefriars College in Donvale and Wesley College.\n\nFormer students or teachers of Castlemaine Secondary College, Maryborough Education Centre, Greensborough Secondary College and Brunswick Secondary College all called for better sex education but did not allege any assaults.\n\nThe website is signed by thousands of former students who graduated years ago but are pushing for future students to receive comprehensive sex education that directly addresses consent at a younger age.\n\n“The worst part is, I think I have been raped. Several times. But until I educated myself (in my late 20s) about consent, I never knew,” says one anonymous testimony from a Monbulk College 2012 alumni.\n\n“And now it’s too painful to open up about my experiences so I have been robbed of ever receiving counselling and having closure either.\n\nLoading\n\n“It’s not too late if we can prevent children from growing up and going through what I have. Not teaching children and teenagers about consent is an absolute robbery of their innocence.”\n\nAt the weekend, the body representing some of Melbourne’s most prestigious Catholic schools – including St Kevin’s College, Parade College, St Mary’s College, St Joseph’s College and St Bernard’s College – said the petition had pushed them to take action and signalled they would work with parents to address the issue.\n\n“The powerful testimonies provided by the many young women in the online petition are disturbing and are an indictment on societal decency,” said Edmund Rice Education Australia executive director Dr Craig Wattam.\n\nSchools of alleged perpetrators\n\nSt Kevin’s College\n\nBrighton Secondary College\n\nBerwick Grammar School\n\nEmmanuel College in Altona North\n\nMelbourne Grammar School\n\nMarcellin College in Bulleen\n\nMcKinnon Secondary College\n\nGeelong Grammar School\n\nCamberwell High School\n\nWhitefriars College in Donvale\n\nWesley College\n\nThe Victorian Acting Premier and Minister for Education, James Merlino, last week told The Age he had directed his department to meet Ms Contos to see where the state could improve on sex and consent education.\n\nLoading\n\nWhile consent is addressed in all Victorian state schools as part of the government’s “Respectful Relationships and Sexuality” program, private schools are free to make their own calls on how and when to run sex and relationship education in their curriculums.\n\n“No state or territory, including Victoria, should be complacent in making sure consent is taught well in classrooms. If we need to make changes to ensure that the issue of consent is taught in a better way that makes a real difference, then we stand ready to make those changes,” Mr Merlino said.\n\nNational Sexual Assault, Family & Domestic Violence Counselling Line: 1800 737 732\n\nStart your day informed\n\nOur Morning Edition newsletter is a curated guide to the most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
