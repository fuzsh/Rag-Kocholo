        "text": "Trip Reports\n\nSaturday 29 June – Crabtree Hill, Forest of Dean Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nNine of us met at 20:00 in the Speech House car park, Forest of Dean. It was good to welcome three who were new to the group. The weather was fine and mild as we set off on our roundabout route to the top of the hill. Walking up through the trees, Siskins and Goldcrests were heard, followed by more vocal Chiffchaff and Blackcap. Later a Whitethroat added its voice. Stonechat, Stock Dove, Buzzard and Jay were all seen. We were early to arrive at the top, so we went on to look across to Cinderford, being serenaded by Song Thrushes. Arriving at 21:15 at the usual Nightjar spot we only had to wait 15 minutes before we heard our first ‘churr’. We were pleased to hear a Woodcock and a distant Tawny Owl; then the churring really got going with a few “quacks” and finally a wonderful flying display; some of our photographers managed some shots in spite of the poor light, showing the white spots on the wings and the distinctive shape. More than satisfied, at 22:30 we started back to the car park, looking out above for bats and below for the toadlets crossing our path. Our meeting finished at 23:00; everyone was very happy with the experience, it had been a great walk giving us 19 species including the very special Nightjars. Thanks to Robert for leading three meetings in succession! Anne Crowe\n\nTuesday 25 June – Saltford Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nOn a hot midsummer morning 26 of us met at St Mary’s Church Saltford for a beautiful three mile walk, a Buzzard hanging high in the sky above us. As we set off along back lanes down to the marina a Great Spotted and a Green Woodpecker were seen and Chiffchaffs were heard. At the marina we watched a Grey Wagtail looking for food on astroturf in the play area and we were treated to a great view of a Grey Heron flying up the river in front of us. Our walk took us back along The Shallows. Many birds were sensibly keeping in the shade but one Jackdaw was seen perched on a chimney pot panting, head flung back and bill gaping open. We continued following the river seeing Swifts, a Red Kite directly overhead with the sun shining through its wings, and an\n\nimpressive group of Crows perched high in the tops of trees. We stopped for a break at The Jolly Sailor (we resisted the temptation to go in!) before making our way back along the sides of fields. An enjoyable if somewhat hot morning’s walk. Thanks Robert for leading again. Gill Phillips\n\nSaturday 22 June – Marshfield Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nThis was the standard walk from Marshfield, down the chest-high grass of Northfield Lane, on to Rushmead Farm, and back by Rushmead Lane. This walk was on a beautiful sunny evening. There was lots of song from Corn Buntings, Skylarks and Yellowhammers all the way through. A very distant Red Kite was caught in a telescope. Swifts, Swallows and House Martins were in small numbers along with lots of Starlings, two Pied Wagtails and three finches, Chaffinch, Linnet and Goldfinch. Treats were a Sparrowhawk going through low near the barn on Rushmead Lane, two Red-legged Partridges calling, and a Little Owl on top of the shed opposite Northfield Lane.\n\nOne Little Owl was photographed in a square hole in the wall. Moving on to Down Road, a Barn Owl was seen prowling against the darkening sky, a Red-legged Partridge heard, and a Quail said “wet”, which was a bit brief. 26 species, a three mile walk, a beautiful sunset, and good company. (Thanks Robert for leading.) Robert Hargreaves\n\nTuesday 18 June – Lower Failand Leader: Alan Craddock\n\n22 of us met outside St Bartholomew’s church at Lower Failand. House Martins were flying around the church as we set off down the lane on a bright sunny morning. A Great Spotted Woodpecker provided our first sighting, along with a distant Greenfinch. Chiffchaff, Wren and Blackcaps were pretty much constant song companions throughout the walk. One of our group had a BTO square which edged the walk and showed us a recently occupied Marsh Tit’s nest in a moss-covered wall we passed, but the birds had flown. Coffee stop gave us some Swifts, Buzzards and Ravens and an amazing view out over the Severn and the “loveliness” of Avonmouth. Moving on, a Whitethroat was singing as we headed downhill past Failand Farm where Goldfinches and Long – tailed Tits were moving through the bushes. An elusive Goldcrest caused a mild upset by distracting the leader. Safely back on track, a Green Woodpecker flew ahead of us. Passing Failand Lodge Farm, two Linnets posed on a wire whilst Skylarks serenaded and a Mistle Thrush flew by. 34 species in total. Thanks to Nick for the bird list (and thanks to Alan for leading). Alan Craddock\n\nTuesday 11 June – Backwell Lake Leaders: Sue and John Princ\n\nIt was a fine cool morning with some sun and a light breeze. Twenty birdwatchers enjoyed a circuit of the lake, where we saw a Little Egret, a Grey Heron, Mallard, Gadwall, Moorhen, and Coots with a nest. Blackcaps sang, a Cetti’s Warbler and Chiffchaffs were prominent. The Mute Swans still have six cygnets but the Canada Goose goslings appear to have been predated (by a Pike?). Dru was lucky enough to see a Peregrine high up. Following lanes to Backwell Bow, we crossed fields by the Blind Yeo river. Here were lots of low flying House Martins and Swallows. A distant Yellowhammer was seen. We were lucky to spot a Green Woodpecker flying up to a rooftop before undulating away. Other birds of note on the walk included three Mistle Thrushes on the hill near The Perrings, two Buzzards, three Goldcrests, two Greenfinches, Goldfinches, and a Linnet. A lovely walk in quiet countryside. Thanks to Nick for keeping the list for us. (Thanks to Sue and John for leading). Sue and John Prince\n\nTuesday 04 June – Sand Point Leader: Nick Hawkridge\n\nOvercast, with rain in the air, but the beauty of this area could not be diminished. A Blackcap, Chiffchaff and Whitethroat were heard up the path but no Stonechat at the trig point. A fresh, west wind whipped about us but only a couple of Shelducks and a few large gulls showed in the bay. Swallows and Swifts appeared as we filed down the path, with a good showing of Linnets and Stonechats. A few Whitethroats sang, as did Goldfinches and Dunnocks, but the Rock Pipit remained silent as it parachuted down behind the cliff face. Another Rock Pipit showed at the coffee stop and fortunately the mizzle gave up, allowing some Skylark s to ascend and sing, and a\n\nlittle further along Middle Hope some Swallows were noted zipping over the grass. We bade farewell to two of our party of 13 at the stile and in sight of the Priory heard our first Lesser Whitethroat. More early finishers departed and the remaining seven ate our lunch overlooking the mud at the mouth of the River Banwell and sheltering behind the pier from a brief rain shower. Back up along the grass beside St Thomas’s Head; here the party again divided, the others to return via the direct route and some of us to cross the field system to the coast. We heard\n\nmore of the same warbler species and enjoyed our buffeting in the strengthening wind. A total of 30 species were seen or heard. (Many thanks to Nick for leading.) Nick Hawkridge\n\nSaturday 01 June – Stockhill Woods Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nOn a glorious sunny morning albeit with a chilly wind four birders joined Graham, two of whom were attending a BOC trip for the first time. A Red Kite was spotted before we set off, which boded well. We crossed the road to the Mineries and recorded both Meadow and Tree Pipit. There was also Stonechat, Reed Bunting, Willow and Reed Warbler. The route took us past the headquarters of the Bristol Exploration Club and back across the Mineries. he usual suspects were seen or heard such as Magpie, Buzzard, Wren, Chiffchaff, Coal, Blue and Great Tit,\n\nTreecreeper, Blackcap and Whitethroat, but sadly only six Swallows. We had a quick walk in the woods and added a few more species. We saw a number of butterflies when we were in sheltered spots and a small basking lizard. In total Graham recorded 30 species. Many thanks to him for a great morning. Beth Yates\n\nTuesday 28 May – Pilning and New Passage Leader: Lois Pryce\n\nThe forecast was for almost constant rain, but 15 brave members attended and luckily we barely got wet. Waders on foreshore, saltmarsh and pools included Dunlin, Ringed Plover, Curlew and Whimbrel. Avocet, Lapwing, Oystercatcher, Mallard, Gadwall, Tufted Duck, Little Grebe and young, with Canada Geese, Shelduck, Little Egret, Grey Heron, Coot and Moorhen, a Mute Swan pair with five small cygnets, Reed Warbler and Reed Bunting. There were plenty of hirundines hunting over the pools – House and Sand Martins and Swallows – and some welcome Swifts. In grassed and hedgerow areas and down the sheltered side lane were Green Woodpecker, Whitethroat, Song Thrush, Grey Wagtails, Linnet, Stock Dove and Skylark, with groups of enthusiastic young Starlings and a Buzzard in the distance. Total 48 species. (Thanks to Lois for leading.) Lois Pryce\n\nSaturday 25 May – Tintern, Angidy Trail Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nA glorious sunny day saw six of us set off from the car park, where already we had spotted a pair of Grey Wagtails. As we climbed up into the wood above the river we were regaled by numerous songbirds: Song Thrush, Blackcap, Wren, Robin, and Dunnock, all singing almost constantly and from all sides! A Goldcrest burst into song by the path. As we came up to a waterfall where Graham had seen Dippers fledging very recently there was no sign of them, but there was a Grey Wagtail. Up on the pond were numerous Demoiselles and a pair of Mallards. Stock Doves were calling to each other in the further woods and as we emerged there were Swallows above. A Cockchafer Beetle was seen nestled on a path-side plant. Returning down the river we were followed by the sound of Nuthatches and many more Wrens. Emerging onto a road there was a comment from Graham that we hadn’t seen any Buzzards and with perfect timing three were seen wheeling high above in the blue sky. A walk full of industrial history and, of course, birds. In total 25 species were seen but it seemed more because they never stopped singing! Thank you Graham for leading this lovely walk. Sue Black\n\nTuesday 21 May – Leap Valley Leaders: Joyce Donkor and Kate Cashmore\n\nNineteen people set off on a warm sunny day to explore this valley tucked away in East Bristol. We crossed the community field where Magpies and Jackdaws foraged in the grass and Feral and Wood Pigeons and Collared Doves flew among the trees, and a Herring Gull flew over. On entering the wood, a Song Thrush was singing. Further along, we had good views of two Great Spotted Woodpeckers bringing food to their nest hole in a tree by the path, so, fortunately, the climbing cat that the leaders had seen in the tree a week before, had not managed to get the young. Across the main road, we continued to follow the stream and the woodland to the Leap Valley Nature Reserve, where a Whitethroat was seen and a Buzzard driven off by Crows. At Moorend Bridge, there were Mallard in the Frome, with a Little Egret, and a Grey Wagtail. Two Jays, a Great Tit, Coal Tit, Blue Tits and Long Tailed Tits were spotted nearby. Walking back by the fields, a Swallow was seen, a Stock Dove heard, Greenfinch and ten Goldfinches seen and heard, and some people watched a family of Pied Wagtails with two young on a fence. Thirteen Chiffchaffs and 13 Blackcaps were heard or seen altogether plus five Dunnocks. The total number of species was 36. (Thanks to Joyce and Kate for leading.) Kate Cashmore\n\nSunday 19 May – Quantocks Leader: Nick Hawkridge\n\nOur party of eight had travelled to Holford in promising sunshine, which persisted all day with a steady north-east breeze. Before entering Hodder’s Combe proper, a pair of Swallows were a delight to see over the houses. Up to the first ford we encountered a pair of Stock Doves “coo-wuping” together on the west fringe of the woods, a Grey Wagtail in the open ground and then our first sound of Redstart, picked up by its song from within the trees. The Pied Flycatchers started to sing as we pushed on to Short Combe, with both females and males being seen around their various nest boxes and a Cuckoo singing from the top of the East flanking woods. Having heard Wood Warbler singing above us, just inside Slaughterhouse Combe, we spent a fair while trying (in vain) to locate him, although the sounds of another Redstart and Pied Flycatchers were a distraction. Breaking into the open top, a pair of Redpolls flew over us and yet another species, Willow Warbler, evaded our sight. A little further up the path a pair of Stonechats showed well. As we feasted our eyes on these two, a dark, long tailed bird flashed through our bins – a Dartford Warbler, the first of three. Flopping down to lunch close under Black Ball Hill, another Cuckoo called, some Skylark sang and a herd of Red Deer saw us but we were ignored. Finding a path down to Sheppard?s Combe and on into Lady?s Combe we heard the scratchy song of Whitethroat which showed, as they do, from the tops of low bushes. As we descended into the wood, a Green Woodpecker yaffled in the distance and a Song Thrush sang close above. A final total of 36 species were recorded. A very special thank you goes to Jeff Holmes for sharing his expertise and brilliant local knowledge. (Thanks to Nick for leading.) Nick Hawkridge\n\nTuesday 14 May – Tintern, Angidy Trail Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nSeventeen members met to walk the trail. From the car park we saw a very pale Buzzard. We set off up a very steep path and we heard Song Thrush all the way to the top. We entered Glyn Woods and we heard Goldcrest, 12 Nuthatch, Goldfinch, Blackcap and more Song Thrushes. We stopped by a pond and two of us were extremely lucky to see a Dipper whiz over the water and down the waterfall, then it flew back 15 minutes later for all to see. Out of the woods and along to the next pond we saw two beautiful Grey Wagtails. We stopped for lunch on a stone wall overlooking the larger of the two ponds, again seeing Grey Wagtails and again serenaded by Song Thrush. We lost one member who had gone off following Stock Dove but he soon found us again.. We didn’t get to see any Goshawk but it was a fabulous walk. Thanks to Graham for leading. Caron Thornton-Trippit\n\nSunday 12 May – Ham Wall Leader: Nick Page\n\nFive of us met in the car park on a lovely morning and were surprised at how much the reserve had dried out after the recent flooding. Some members went on the Bristol Naturalist?s walk that was also happening that day. We bumped into each other a few times and shared our sightings. Ham Wall is alive with birds in the spring and gives a good opportunity to learn the different bird songs. Chiffchaff, Blackcap and Garden Warblers sang near the car park and a sunbathing Grass Snake gave good views too. Great White Egrets and many other water birds were present as always, including Pochard and Pintail, and we heard some Bittern booming. A distant Hobby chased the local dragonflies and a Cuckoo called but did not show itself. A mystery squirrel like mammal was seen and on the way back we saw a Mink swimming. (Thanks to Nick for leading.) Nick Page\n\nFriday 10 May – Highnam Woods Leader: Lewis Thomson\n\nFifteen of us met in the evening in the hopes of hearing Nightingale in one of their last local strongholds. Lewis, the RSPB warden for Gloucestershire, led us around the reserve explaining how they manage it for the iconic songsters. He pointed out many different fauna and flora and answered our questions on these topics. The reserve has many species of insect; we did not see too many on this trip but sounded a good excuse to visit again in the summer. We saw Newts and Tadpoles as well as hearing many Song Thrushes, some who try to mimic the Nightingale song. Other species like Blackcap sang and several Great Spotted Woodpeckers were seen. We heard two Nightingales, one was not singing as much – Lewis said it was paired up – and the other gave us an excellent demonstration of its repertoire. Let?s hope they continue to survive here so there are more opportunities to hear them in the future. Later that night we were treated to an excellent display of the Northern Lights. Many thanks to Lewis for leading the walk. Nick Page\n\nTuesday 07 May – Oldbury Power Station Leader: Di Bunniss\n\nWe had a wonderful walk at Oldbury Power station with a group of 31 people in total. We spotted a Buzzard while waiting for everyone to arrive at the car park. The sun was shining and became quite warm during the walk. Lots of song by Chiffchaffs and Blackbirds along the way. There was a debate whether we were hearing two Cuckoos or just the one, which made us all smile. We stopped first at the lake and saw Mute Swans, Little Grebe, Tufted Ducks, Moorhens and Mallards with chicks. Along Lagoon 3 was the constant song of Reed Warblers, but rarely popping into view. A Linnet perched for a short while for some of the group to admire. We paused on the coastal path at the Severn Estuary for coffee and saw Oystercatchers, Shelducks, a few Grey Herons, gulls and a Whimbrel. We stopped at Lagoon 2 and heard lots of Whitethroat and Blackcap. On the way to lunch we saw a beautiful male Bullfinch. Finally, we had our picnic in the old orchard where we saw a Blue Tit in and out of a nest box. We recorded a total of 42 species. A great day had by all. Thanks to Di for leading. Caron Thornton-Trippit\n\nSaturday 04 May – Inglestone Common Leader: Mike Jackson\n\nFive of us met in Lower Woods car park on a gloriously sunny morning where we watched a Coal Tit taking food to its concealed nest on the other side of the garden wall of the Lodge. As we set off for the Common, a Willow Warbler sang, psychologically helping us cope with the standing water that was persistently underfoot. Here, two more members joined. The scrub on Inglestone Common provided excellent habitat for Whitethroat, Blackcap, Goldfinch and Linnet. Buzzard and Skylark enjoyed the free space above the grassland, and a small raptor kept us momentarily guessing until its hovering declared it as a Kestrel. Three Swallows flew near human habitations and two Song Thrushes foraged with a Blackbird on a horse paddock where we heard our only woodpecker of the day, a Great Spotted. The denser scrub and overgrown hedgerows flanking the north of the common bore Stock Dove, more Whitethroat, two Lesser Whitethroat and Bullfinch, while a Nuthatch called from the trees. Ravens were never far away and we probably saw four throughout. The Willow Warbler welcomed us back to our cars where we took a moment to absorb its dreamy notes. Thanks to the group for achieving 30 species (and thanks to Mike for leading.) Mike Jackson\n\nTuesday 30 April – Puxton Moor Leader: Gareth Roberts\n\nTwenty walkers met by the church with its leaning tower for a walk round Avon Wildlife Trust’s Puxton Moor reserve. The cold wind initially had the birds keeping their heads down, but it settled and the sun brought some warmth. Leaving the village a flock of 13 Canada Geese flew over, and four Swallows in the distance. Along the road approaching the reserve we heard the first of eight Reed Warblers. Sedge Warblers were newly arrived and we heard four, with a brief glimpse of two in the wind. There were also five Cetti’s Warblers and six Reed Buntings, one giving very good views. A Cormorant was trying out one of the new design pylons. Six Skylarks were seen and heard. Two Bullfinches were heard calling, and briefly seen, along the tree-lined lane, where we\n\nhad song from Chiffchaff, Blackcap, and Chaffinch. A sunny interval brought an early Hairy Dragonfly. A number of tracks were seen in the soft mud of the bridleway by the river, including Grey Heron, badger, deer, and, best of all, otter. Nearby a Lesser Whitethroat sang, and one of three Green Woodpeckers flew low over an ant hill field. In all we had 38 bird species. Thanks to Graham for the bird list, and to Simon Reece for the mud print expertise. (Thanks to Gareth for leading) Gareth Roberts\n\nTuesday 23 April – Marshfield Leader: Chris Perry\n\nOur party of 29 were mostly prepared for the chilly north wind that saw us zipping up our coats and fleeces good and tight. An obliging Corn Bunting stayed on its wire until we’d trooped over the road up the lane and could stand virtually beneath it. Skylark started to sing, a couple of Swallows headed east over the track and many Rooks and Carrion Crows could be heard up ahead. Another Corn Bunting stayed on its perch for us to admire, while a couple of Chaffinch trilled from Culverslade Farm and more Skylarks sang and chased around the fields. The first of the Buzzards appeared, suitable escorted by a corvid or three. A distant Yellowhammer was good to see as were the ones we found at the coffee stop on Rushmead Lane. A wander to and from Tormarton Road saw a couple of Red-legged Partridges scuttle up the hedge line before being lost to sight. Deer and a Brown Hare were an added attraction and by the turn, up to seven Yellowhammers and many Linnets had been counted and seen. The local Red Kite put in an appearance as did a Sparrowhawk and a Kestrel. Nearly back, we caught site of a pair of Ravens hedge hopping over the fields heading west. Many thanks to Chris for leading. Nick Hawkridge\n\nSunday 21 April – RSPB Franchises Lodge, New Forest Leader: Izzy (RSPB)\n\nFive members made the trip to Franchises Lodge, the only inland RSPB reserve in the New Forest. Izzy, the reserve manager, led us around a large and varied woodland and described the ongoing work to build a mosaic habitat including felling and removal of rhododendron. A Wood Warbler was heard in the car park and it didn’t take long to hear many more and get great sightings as we moved into open birch woodland where we also saw a pair of dancing Marsh Tits, Treecreepers, Nuthatch, Coal Tit and Blackcap, and a recently fledged Song Thrush. Hearing 30+ Firecrests (probably outnumbering the Goldcrests) the group only caught two or three glimpses but this was made up for by some unfamiliar raspberry noises in an overgrown hedgerow leading us to a flock of Siskins with Redpolls amongst them. A pit-stop at a new RSPB residential centre replete with bird, bat and swift boxes gave us a pair of Grey Wagtails that ignored the facilities to nest in a shed roof. Our sunny lunch stop in some open ground filled out the species list with Long-tailed Tit, Grey Wagtail, Greenfinch and Goldfinch before a brief sighting of a Redstart on our way to\n\na large pond with Canada Goose, Tufted Duck and Little Grebe. We also came across a large herd of Fallow Deer complete with a White Harte which we were told is left alone by hunters to make the herds easier to identify. The highlight of the day was seeing a Buzzard overhead chased away by a Goshawk which followed with a brief victory lap. The walk gave us 42 bird species and unusually no gulls, Woodpigeon or Pheasant. Thanks to Mike Jackson for coordinating and to Izzy for leading. Ian Price\n\nTuesday 16 April – Hanham Mills Leader: Karen Birmingham\n\nThirty walkers set out on a bright and breezy day through woodland full of wood anemones, wild garlic and bluebells, and then back along the River Avon past the heronry. Thirty six bird species were seen or heard including a Treecreeper feeding its mate, Nuthatch, Goldfinch, Greenfinch, Song Thrush, Moorhen, Buzzard, ten Mallard ducklings and, of course, the Grey Herons. Surprisingly there were no Cormorants to be seen but we did watch a roe deer sitting peacefully in a field, unperturbed by us walkers. (Thanks to Karen for leading). Karen Birmingham\n\nSaturday 13 April – Sand Point / Middle Hope Leader: Giles Morris\n\nThis joint walk with the Bristol Naturalists’ Society had more than 30 people meet in the car park with high hopes of hearing Grasshopper Warbler and seeing some spring migrants. It was a beautiful day and we all enjoyed the lovely views as well as good company. The birds did not disappoint either with displaying Whitethroat and Linnet at Sand Point, as well as singing Chiffchaff, Willow Warbler and Blackcap. The local Peregrine patrolled while Meadow Pipits, Tree Pipits and Goldfinches migrated overhead on their journey across the water to Wales. Whilst the first Avon Cirl Bunting since 1991 (seen the week before) was not repeated, we did find an almost\n\nequally rare bird for Sand Point in the shape of a very smart looking Marsh Tit. This was the first one seen on Sand Point since 1996 and was keeping the company of a Coal Tit. Two Grasshopper Warblers gave their distinctive call. On then to Middle Hope where we didn’t see any Wheatear but a very smart male Redstart gave great views, while a Sparrowhawk gave its best Merlin impression. Skylarks delighted with great views and their iconic song, while smart looking Stonechats and singing Greenfinch added to the day. Overall, 37 species were seen by the main group, with another ten seen during the visit. Thanks to Giles for leading. Nick Page\n\nTuesday 09 April – Bath Skyline Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nSeventeen members met at the overflow car park of the American Museum, a re-arranged meeting place as the original meeting point was inaccessible due to road works. Coran, a new member, met with us for the first time. Wind gusts up to 35mph and cold temperatures meant that bird sightings were fewer than usual. We were rewarded early on with a clear view of a Mistle Thrush at the top of a tree. Robins were out in force, (twelve seen or heard in total) and 15 Blackcaps were heard, (but not seen) as we wandered through Bathampton Wood. Nine Herring Gulls and seven Lesser Black-backed Gulls were gathered on Bathampton Down and four Linnets were seen in flight there. We had sightings also of four Blue Tits, one Greenfinch, three Goldfinch and one Jay. Near the end of the walk, two Great Tits were spotted courting and a single Pied Wagtail was in one of the university’s playing fields among numerous Jackdaw. The total bird count for the morning was 21 species. Thanks to Graham for leading and to Nick for the species list. Alison Hooper\n\nTuesday 02 April – Between the Lakes Leader: Jean Oliver\n\nTwenty Five of us met at Herons Green for a walk between Chew Valley and Blagdon Lakes, after the planned walk at Folly Farm was cancelled due to flooding. Spring had arrived with several wild flowers in bloom, birds carrying nesting material, including Jackdaws that were making their home at the top of the Obelisk on Breach Hill, and birdsong – particularly Chiffchaffs and Blackcaps. A Red Kite was seen at the beginning of the walk; assorted tits, finches and a Treecreeper, amongst other birds along the route and, on the return leg, some of the taller birders could see the top of a Cattle Egret in a field whilst others spotted a Swallow and Sand Martin flying past. Including birds seen on the lakes we saw 55 species – and the weather stayed dry. Many thanks, Jean, for leading. Jacky Tonkin\n\nTuesday 26 March – Bristol Centre Leader: Alan Craddock\n\nEighteen members assembled in Millenium Square for a thankfully dry stroll around the docks. Our first halt was outside the Arnolfini where Rich Scantlebury gave us pointers on gull plumage and identified a young Great Black -backed Gull in amongst the immature Herring Gulls. Two Canada Geese, a Cormorant and a Moorhen were locally in attendance. Moving along past M Shed, House Sparrows, two Magpies, a Blue Tit and the first of many Wrens were added to the list. A couple of Collared Doves later we arrived at the coffee stop where a Robin provided the background music. Arriving at the bridge over the New Cut, we spotted a raptor, initially thought to\n\nbe a Peregrine, which morphed into a Kestrel as it flew towards Ashton Court. The riverbank provided three surprise Oystercatchers which we were not expecting but no Redshanks which we were. As we prepared to leave the dockside for Brandon Hill, a Grey Wagtail flew past and gave us a brief display on a rooftop. Climbing into the woods on the hill, we found Bird Central where Wrens, Robins, Goldfinches and Greenfinches were enthusiastically singing in what was almost sunshine! Thanks to Graham for the bird count and Alan for leading. 27 species in total. Alan Craddock\n\nTuesday 19 March Burnett – Elm Farm Leader: Philippa Paget\n\nThirty people gathered in the farmyard in fine, sunny weather. Philippa gave a short talk on the set-up and ethos of the farm. We set-off across the fields, spotting a distant Red Kite and then a closer Kestrel. The trees and hedges of the field boundaries were filled with Chaffinches and bright Yellowhammers in pleasing numbers; Skylarks sang along as we reached the track where Philippa had put seed down for the finches. A flock of 20 Siskins was spotted. We crossed into a field where we could see owl boxes, regularly used by Barn Owls. We had a brief glimpse of a Great Spotted Woodpecker and a Green Woodpecker called loudly. An early coffee stop gave great views across the valley and the company of a loudly singing Chiffchaff. Three Buzzards circled above. We carried on down, looking for the Mistle Thrush whose song rang out in the valley; finally it showed itself in the top of a tall tree ahead. We made a small diversion to inspect the STW and brook; giving us a Goldcrest with other common small birds. Finally we climbed the long, slow hill back to the farm – everyone made it! We arrived to the hoots of Collared Doves and the wheeze and trill of Greenfinches. We had seen several Brimstone utterflies, hare and deer. It had been a lovely spring walk to the sound of singing Robins, Dunnocks, Wrens, Tits and Chiffchaff, with 32 species altogether. Thanks to Graham for the bird count and to Philippa for\n\nleading us. Anne Crowe\n\nTuesday 12 March – Luckington Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nSeven turned up on a very wet day. We set off towards Luckington Court and saw our first of many (40+) Woodpigeons and (100+) Jackdaws. It was hard to spot the birds in all the rain but we heard Robin, Goldcrest, Wren, Mallard, Treecreeper and Great Tit. We did spot a lone male Chaffinch in the trees and a number of Dunnock, four Long-tailed Tits and lots of Blue Tit in the hedges along the route. The first of three Grey Wagtails was seen close to the overflowing stream as we approached Sherston and 100+ Rook were flying around the nearby trees. We abandoned the water-logged paths and kept to the minor roads on the return to Luckington. A Kestrel and Buzzard were seen and Skylark heard when the rain stopped and the weather brightened briefly. Also spotted were Goldfinch and a Linnet. The total bird count for the morning was 28 species. Thanks to Graham for leading. Alison Hooper\n\nSunday 10 March – Forest of Dean Leader: Nick Page\n\nThirteen of us started at a closed in, but dry, New Fancy View. Unfortunately, the birds did not play ball. Goshawks were seen before and after our time there. Some Siskins offered good views, as did a pair of Bullfinches on the way back to the cars. Next stop was Cannop Ponds, where many tits and finches provided quite the show, Marsh Tit the highlight. There were some Mandarins looking splendid as did the breeding plumage Little Grebe. On to Nagshead where we ate lunch by the pond, seeing the difference between frog and toad spawn. The reserve was quiet on our visit but we got good views of Treecreeper and Nuthatch. Parkend Church and Graveyard gave great sightings of two Firecrest, with two Hawfinch seen by some in the party. A few of us ventured back to New Fancy and were rewarded with seeing 15 Waxwings. A nice day, with a total of\n\n46 species noted. (Thanks to Nick for leading) Nick Page\n\nTuesday 05 March – Forest of Dean Leader: Nick Hawkridge\n\nThe day was glorious, sun, no rain and little wind. People arrived, changed and shot up to the viewing platform at New Fancy View. I recall seeing 27 members but many other birders arrived too, who obviously felt the day had potential. Goshawk gave one brief, but good view and a few more of the ‘distant’ sort, Some calling Crossbills, many Chaffinches and Siskins were heard/seen from the platform. With the crush above, orderly couples sloped off, in succession, onto the east facing edge of the downward path, to look at, but not disturb a Common Lizard and an Adder that were enjoying the sun. After coffee, a short drive to Speech House gave us splendid views of\n\nNuthatch, Coal Tit, Goldcrest, Treecreeper and some colourful Chaffinches but alas no Hawfinch. Lunch was taken, surrounded by beauty and overlooking the causeway below the top pond at Cannop, It was a sloshy old walk round the west side of the bottom pond. However, many Mandarins were found plus the two flyover Goosanders we’d seen at lunch had joined up with two others and were really quite approachable. A Mute Swan came over to ‘harrumph’ at us and the Greylag Goose came for a hand-out. As ever the feeders at the stone works were very busy, giving the queuing birds the appearance of Christmas decorations in the surrounding trees. A final tally of 48 species was OK for this brilliant day. (Thanks to Nick for leading.) Nick Hawkridge\n\nSaturday 02 March – Portbury Wharf Leader: Peter Bryant\n\nUnfortunately, this walk had to be cancelled due to adverse weather conditions (Snow!)\n\nTuesday 27 February – Castle Combe Leader: Geoff Hardman\n\nEleven members met for our walk at Castle Combe, reputed to be one of England’s most beautiful villages. After tackling the complexities of the parking app we were able to set off on this lovely walk which led through the village, along footpaths, through wooded areas and open fields, past ponds and along quiet country lanes. From the car park we heard a Great Spotted Woodpecker drumming with Song Thrush, Greenfinch and Goldfinch also calling. An excellent start. In the village we soon spotted a flock of Chaffinches and four Bullfinches, though they seem determined to hide behind branches. Continuing onward we could hear Nuthatch calling and Redwing were\n\nspotted. Leaving the village we stopped at a grassy bank where we had had our coffee break while enjoying splendid views over the valley watching two Muntjac in the far field. Our route then took us past an old water mill and through a field, where we saw Buzzards overhead, gulls circling and a Raven with its ‘cronking’ call. At the pond were three Grey Herons and many Canada Geese. Following the path around the field took great concentration as stepping off the path meant sinking into a morass inches deep! The return path was along a quiet country lane and footpath where the final surprise was a Sparrowhawk that flew up from the hedgerow and gave a short display of speed and agility. Thanks to Alan and Nick for keeping the impressive bird list of 41\n\nspecies, and to Geoff for leading. Di Bunniss\n\nTuesday 20 February – Watercress Farm Leader: Alastair Fraser\n\nOn a rare dry day 66 members turned up to find the leader was sporting wellies. The recent rain resulted in a lot of mud. Watercress Farm has rewilding and rewetting projects and the latter appears to be going very well. Before we set off a Red Kite flew over, which was a good start. The group turned into a crocodile of birders which over the morning recorded 41 species. Apart from the Red Kite, the group also saw Buzzard, Kestrel and Sparrowhawk. Redwing and Fieldfare were spotted along with Mistle Thrush, Song Thrush and Jay. A Great Spotted Woodpecker was seen and a Green Woodpecker that merged with the grass and was very difficult to see. Of the smaller species there were Linnet, Bullfinch and Siskin but, sadly, no Yellowhammer. Many thanks to\n\nAlastair for leading this very popular and interesting walk. I’m informed the 66 birders was a record attendance for the BOC. Beth Yates\n\nSunday 18 February – River Exe Coach Trip Leader: Gordon Youdale\n\nThe weather for this trip was warm, dry and with a little sunshine, a change from usually expected conditions. The first part of the trip took us on a walk from Exminster to Powderham. Looking across the RSPB marshes we could see many species of wildfowl with Canada and Brent Geese, Wigeon, Shoveler, Pintail, Teal and Lapwing. A Water Rail ran along one of the road ditches. In the wet fields there were good numbers of Curlews, with Oystercatchers feeding, the hedges along the roads gave us Goldfinch, Siskin, Goldcrest, a Cetti’s Warbler singing and Chiffchaff in full song. Skylarks were singing overhead as we made our way down the canal towpath to the Turf Hotel, where we took time to look out over the River Exe to Topsham. This is where the majority of\n\nwaders could be seen, large numbers of Avocet, Dunlin, Knot, Golden and Grey Plover, Bar-tailed and Blacktailed Godwits, Lapwing, also a Greenshank and seven Red-breasted Mergansers. As we walked along the footpath towards Powderham Church to meet up with the coach, in a field with sheep we could see many Cattle Egret (possibly 30) and also 20 Little Egret. This first part of the walk produced 62 species. Moving on to Dawlish Warren we first took a look at the sea from the lifeguard station, here we managed to see Shag, Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe and Gannets but no divers. A few decided to take a walk up the beach to see what else we could find, the best being an Eider Duck resting on one of the sand banks. As we walked back towards the coach we had a look around the lake and nature reserve area near the visitors’ centre where we saw Greenfinch, Stonechat, Long-tailed Tit, Goldcrest and Goldfinch with good views of two Cirl Buntings finishing the day off nicely. This part of the walk produced 28 species. (Thanks to Judy for organising the trip and Gordon for leading) Gordon Youdale\n\nTuesday 13 February – Pensford Leaders: Alan Craddock and Mike Landen\n\nThirteen of us met up at Pensford on an overcast morning, although it was quite mild for this time of year. Shortly after the start we heard and then had a good view of a Song Thrush. As we passed through the village, we saw a Collared Dove and a number of House Sparrows. Crossing the fields we found a Dunnock, some Canada Geese as well as Black-headed and Lesser Black-backed Gulls. Approaching a pond, we could hear the sound of Teal and eventually everyone got reasonable views of at least some of the seven birds. At the first very muddy section which we all negotiated successfully we then added Chaffinch, Goldcrest and Coal Tit to our list. We noticed\n\nsome activity at the far side of a large field and estimated that there were about 70 Redwings feeding on the ground. There was also a single Fieldfare. We entered Lord’s Wood and saw a Raven, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Jay, Buzzard and heard a Wren. Further on there was a flock of about 35 Linnets and a Pied/White Wagtail closely followed by a Grey Wagtail. A couple of Greenfinches and a Mistle Thrush were seen. We had a nice view of a Green Woodpecker and as we approached Publow we had about 35 Siskins feeding in a conifer. This was probably the highlight as they looked quite spectacular as they flew in a tightly bunched flock. This was a\n\nreally enjoyable walk. We had a creditable total of 43 species. Thanks to Alan and Mike for co-leading and to Nick Hawkridge and Alan Daniells for the species list. Mike Landen\n\nTuesday 06 February – Northend, Bath Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nFifteen people met at Eagle Road in Northend village on a rather gloomy, windy day. As we set off through the village we heard the hooting Collared Doves. We commenced the long uphill slog to Little Solsbury Hill, to the sound of common small birds. After pausing to view a group of Redwings in distant trees we finally reached the top to be greeted by singing Skylarks; two obligingly dropped onto grass close by, we could see their identifying features. We were treated to wonderful views across Bath and beyond. Heading down the other side we found shelter for our coffee stop; then on down to a gateway – much improved but still very muddy. Ever downward\n\nalongside hedgerows, down steep steps brought us to Chilcombe Bottom. Hedges here brought more Robins, Dunnocks and a small band of Long-tailed Tits; one Song Thrush, then another sang out across the valley. We reached a small wetland reserve; pretty boggy! The usual two Moorhens emerged from the reeds on the pool. Taking the slightly longer route back near a stream we felt the walk had not been full of birds, but as we arrived at the village suddenly the trees were full of finches, Greenfinch, Chaffinch and Goldfinch, a lovely sight. The walk, notable for its wonderful views, had given us 24 species and good aerobic exercise. Thanks to our leader Robert. Anne Crowe\n\nSunday 04 February – Chew Valley Lake Leader: Robin Martin\n\nEleven members met at Herriotts Bridge on an initially blustery and cloudy day with the weather improving as the walk progressed. Two new members attended their first field meeting and we hope the weather conditions did not put them off attending future meetings. At Herriotts Bridge there was a large roost of gulls including a single Yellow-legged Gull and a brief view of a Mediterranean Gull that flew off when the roost was disturbed. There were a few Pintails, four Great White Egrets and a Red Kite. The group then moved to Stratford Hide and Moreton Point. Highlights included two female Scaup, seven Goldeneye, two female Marsh Harriers hunting over\n\nthe reeds and a fly-by Sparrowhawk. After a brief visit to Herons Green, we finished at Woodford Lodge and walked down to the dam. The highlight here was a stunning male Bullfinch calling from the trees. In total we observed 51 species which was a reasonable list for such a blustery day. (Thanks to Robin for leading) Robin Martin\n\nTuesday 30 January – Uphill/Walborough AWT. Leader: Colin Hawkins\n\nIt was a very cold day with a biting northerly wind when our group of 22 gathered on the beach to scan the shoreline and local area. We soon spotted Shelduck, Dunlin and Oystercatchers with a lone Sanderling, pale silver and white, scurrying along the shoreline with the gulls. When the icy wind became too much we headed back along the road and took the path past the yacht club where we heard and saw Dunnock and Robin singing. From the hill we scanned the flatlands below to see over 30 swans, with one egret among them. More exciting was the appearance of two Peregrine Falcons skimming low over the grass and resting on the distant fence posts. Our path wound past a field of stubble where we watched a flock of very busy Chaffinches, some Reed Buntings among them. A flock of Fieldfares and Redwings flew over and at the far end a flock of more than 500 Lapwings took to the sky in a fantastic display. On our return path we kept closer to the creek and saw a few Skylarks soaring upwards, Stonechat perching on the reeds, Teal and Redshank in the water, Meadow Pipits in the field and a Rock Pipit on the bank. On reaching the cars a Raven flew over with its honking call. An excellent walk with a total of 46 species recorded by Alan. (Thanks to Colin for leading.) Di Bunniss\n\nSaturday 27 January – Marshfield. Leader: Nigel Kempson\n\nTen members turned up for this walk around the Rushmead Lane area of Marshfield. It was a dull, dry and windless day and, perhaps because of this, we could not see any large flocks of birds from the main road. The only taster was a compliant Buzzard on a distant post clearly displaying the diagnostic breast band. Commencing the walk, we immediately had good views of three Corn Buntings which were a first UK tick for some members. The Yellowhammers and the winter thrushes were not so obliging, giving only distant views that really needed a scope for 100% identification. In general, the bird numbers increased the further we went down Rushmead Lane and we spent some time around the wetter area at the far end. The final list was for 32 species and my thanks go to Alan Daniels for keeping the tally. (Thanks to Nigel for leading) Nigel Kempson\n\nTuesday 23 January – Shapwick/Ham Wall. Leader: Sue Watson\n\nbeyond the carpark but sadly it did not show itself. We found large numbers of Mute Swans, a flock of Lapwings soaring plus Coot and many ducks. Groups of Wigeons and colourful Shovelers, 200 of each and nearly as many smart looking Gadwalls. A variety of other usual duck species were fairly numerous with the noticeable exception of Mallards, where only ten were seen. There was a single Grey Heron, two Great Egrets, no Little Egrets but we had a brief view of Snipe flying over and heard a Water Rail. A mixed flock of Tits followed our progress along the path, apparently hoping for food. A couple of very confiding Great Tits tried to persuade us by using the outer twigs of bushes closest to us, pointedly “chatting” to us! Three Robins singing in a bush on the edge of the path, sat unusually close to each other. Six Buzzards were also seen. On the Shapwick Heath Reserve it was good to hear Bullfinch, Cetti’s Warbler and to have an amazing seven Marsh Harriers in the air at the same time, near Tower Hide, before thousands of Starlings came in. The Starlings were however, distant, at the furthest point of the reserve, with no great murmurations this time. A total of 46 species. (Thanks to Sue for leading).Sue Watson\n\nTuesday 16 January – River Avon – Leigh Woods to Ham Green. Leader: Judy Copeland\n\n22 people came together at Abbots Leigh and thanks to beautiful weather we had a lovely morning’s walk, despite the near-freezing temperature. Long-tailed Tits were waiting to greet us at the entrance to the Leigh Court drive and there was, of course, a Buzzard in view on a tree. Magpies were everywhere (highest count 22!) and Jackdaws and Crows much in evidence. Most of the birds were found once we had walked through Leigh Woods and arrived at the river. Our first Common Sandpiper was not far away on the mud, and several more were seen. As the tide started dropping, lines of Redshanks flew upriver calling, a lovely sound. Surprising were a flock of 31 Dunlin wheeling over the river in the sunshine and a pair of Wigeons; neither are often seen upriver. A Sparrowhawk was chasing a Raven, a Green Woodpecker was seen in a field, a Curlew flew over, some people saw Snipe emerging from the rushes and Pied Wagtails fluttered around. Along the bank on the far side were six resting Herons, strategically placed at a distance from each other. On Ham Green lake were Mallard, Moorhens and a Cormorant, with a Song Thrush up in the tree beside us. Back towards the cars we added House Sparrows in the hedges. 42 species. (Thanks to Judy for leading.) Judy Copeland\n\nSaturday 13 January – Oldbury Power Station. Leader: Pete Hazelwood\n\n16 people met on a chilly grey day. We started our walk through the orchard and soon spotted Fieldfares, adding all the other commonly seen thrushes including Redwing, Song and Mistle Thrushes over time. Along the shore line we saw a variety of waders including Curlew, Dunlin, Turnstone, Redshank, and a number of ducks including Teal, Wigeon and Shelduck. Three different pipit species were present: Rock and Meadow Pipit,, and significantly a Water Pipit on the saltmarsh near the yacht club. The highlight of the walk for me was seeing a Black Redstart as it posed beautifully for us in full view. There were also very good views of male and female Reed Buntings. Away from the estuary we encountered plenty of other birds of which my favourites were Snipe, Water Rail (heard), Bullfinch, Greenfinch, and a Skylark singing. At the end of the walk we watched a male and female Peregrine interacting with each other on a pylon near the car park. 52 species recorded. (Thanks to Peter for leading) Lynda Moysey\n\nTuesday 09 January – Litton Reservoirs/Hinton Blewitt. Leaders: Sue and John Princ\n\nOn a chilly morning 21 birdwatchers set off from Hinton Blewitt. There were plenty of Goldfinches about, with a few Redwings, Greenfinches, and two Chaffinches. As we walked down the steep hill towards Coley we saw Long-tailed Tits and two Goldcrests. We heard, then saw, a Nuthatch. The rivers were running high and fast in the village, and water levels at the reservoirs were also high. We saw three Grey Herons, also Mallards, Dabchicks, Moorhens, and one Teal. At the coffee break a Red Kite and a flock of Lapwings flew over. A lucky few saw a Kingfisher at the far end of the second lake. We returned mainly by the lanes and saw Siskins, Bullfinches, and a Chiffchaff. The total for the morning was 45 species. (Thanks to Sue and John for leading). Sue Prince\n\nTuesday 02 January – Hengrove Mounds/Manor Woods. Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nFive of us turned up the day storm ‘Gerrit’ hit and did it ever rain! We started with a circular and very muddy walk around the mounds where not a lot was to be seen other than around a dozen Goldfinches to start with a few Herring Gulls and many Black-headed Gulls. Making use of the seating at the Beach Hut Café, we stopped for coffee and were serenaded the whole time by a Song Thrush. After we finished the circuit we had a discussion as to whether it was worth visiting Hawkfield Meadow. As it was under a foot of water we decided best not to and drove to Manor Woods, and were glad we did as the bird count was fairly numerous (and the rain stopped). First we heard, then subsequently saw a Raven, a little while later a Jay was spotted as we continued to the Malago, which is generally little more than a stream but was more like a white water rapid! Entering the woods we found a decent area where we stopped for a good while as we noticed many Long-tailed Tits along with Great Tit, Coal Tit, Blue Tit, half a dozen Goldcrests, Wren plus a lovely Nuthatch fluttering around. Continuing on we managed a Grey Wagtail but alas no Teal which are generally seen here. It all ended in quite a decent day with 24 species. (Thanks to Graham for leading). Graham Blacker\n\nMonday 01 January – Slimbridge WWT. Leader Di Bunniss\n\n21 members met in the car park of Slimbridge on a dry but overcast day, and the only leading was to the main entrance! Once through, the group always scatter as they head for the various hides. As usual some headed straight for the Holden Tower Hide which has great views over the fields towards the Severn estuary, while others made for the Rushy Hide which looks out over one of the lakes. No matter which starting point was chosen, we were together but in smaller groups and the more experienced were able to point out the birds that were less easy to spot. My ‘Bird of the Day ‘ was the Ruff with its startling white head. The other, a close second, was the Spotted Redshank, which was remarkably difficult to pick out from among the many Common Redshanks but, once identified, suddenly seemed so obviously different. Thanks to the very patient people with scopes who let me see the bird clearly. Most of the geese were spotted including Brent, Barnacle, Snow, Ross’s and White-fronted. A Marsh Harrier was disturbing the hundreds of Golden Plovers and Lapwings, which put on an impressive display as they flew up in huge flocks, circled and settled again. It would be impossible to list all the birds seen but a combination of two lists came to an impressive total of 71 species. (Thanks to Di for leading) Di Bunniss\n\nTuesday 26 December -Snuff Mills Leader Nick Hawkridge\n\nAs the Song Thrush sang and the Jay foraged, we 14 set off along the usual route. A Moorhen on the river had found a refuge in the middle of the madly rushing water and up the first stretch were Long-tailed Tit, Goldcrest, the usual Blue and Great Tit all foraging among the trees and never stopping for a moment. A Nuthatch finally stopped long enough to be seen clearly before slipping away down the far side of his tree trunk. Our first and only winter thrushes in the shape of Redwings flew over as we came to Vassall’s Park and our coffee stop (thanks for the bikkies and sweets). Green and Great Spotted Woodpecker were in the trees as we headed towards the river again but most special was a group of c20 Siskin feeding acrobatically in the Alder tops. Splashing through the mud, back along the river, we only really added the expected Mallard and Grey Wagtail. Sadly, Kingfisher and even Grey Heron were missing. It was all in all a lovely walk (32 species) and the first on a Tuesday for Emily F whom we were most glad to welcome. (Thanks to Nick for leading) Nick Hawkridge\n\nTuesday 19 December – Goblin Combe Leader: Alastair Fraser\n\nThe heavy overnight rain was still falling as I arrived at Goblin Combe. My hope of a swift return home was confounded when seven other people turned up so I was compelled to lead the walk. We thought we would be lucky to see the Buzzard perched in its usual tree near the car park, but a dark shape appeared, flew low over the field before disturbing roosting pigeons as it landed. Birds were hard to find as we trudged up the muddy path. A flock of ten Redwings vacated the trees above us. A couple of Coal Tits and a Goldcrest were among the few sightings. The rain eased off, as forecast, by the coffee break with better luck as we went up the hill towards Wrington Warren; two flocks of Long-tailed Tits and a few Blue and Great Tits. Bullfinch as we walked towards Cleeve Toot, a couple of people heard Tawny Owl. The Avon Wildlife Trust has radically thinned part of the woodland but we still heard Great Spotted Woodpecker and Marsh Tit. The weather cleared as we reached the end of the walk and the birds were back in business. Mistletoe covered trees were full of Greenfinches, Goldfinches, Tits and a Song Thrush. We managed 26 species, the weather notwithstanding. (Thanks to Alastair for leading) Alastair Fraser\n\nSaturday 16 December – Chew Valley Lake Leader: Alan Daniels\n\nEight members met at Herriotts Bridge on an overcast day, about 10c with a south-westerly breeze. The water was quite high with few if any waders about. 27 species were present on the pool and the lake including four Egyptian Geese, Great White Egret, a Goldeneye and an unusual Tufted Duck with a bright blue stripe across its bill. Moving on to Stratford Hide, we were greeted by a Sparrowhawk which flew over as we approached the hide. A Kingfisher flew by as we entered and we were treated to views of two Marsh Harrier, the sound of Water Rail and large rafts of waterfowl. At Moreton we picked out one female and one 1st year male Scaup amongst a raft of ducks including several Goldeneyes, along with Tufted Duck and Pochard. At Heron’s Green we saw the Egyptian Geese again. There was a Little Grebe and a Little Egret on the pool and we added Wigeon to the list on the lake. A single Common Sandpiper was working its way along the lake edge. We moved to Woodford Lodge in the hope of finding the Firecrest which had been reported, but no such luck. We did manage to find Goldcrest, Bullfinch and Treecreeper along the Recreational Trail between the Lodge and the Dam, with more Goldeneye and a large (c200) raft of Common Gulls at the Dam. . 63 species seen or heard in all. (Thanks to Alan for leading ) Alan Daniels\n\nTuesday 12 December – Saltford Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nOn an unexpectedly sunny day over 40 walkers met at The Riverside, where the BOC Christmas lunch was to be held. We set off, looking at the very high river level, for our flexible walk. Most took the higher path, affording interesting views and seeing common small birds including two Great Spotted Woodpeckers, four Goldcrest, a Mistle Thrush and seven Blackbirds. Joining up with walkers who took “The Shallows” road next to the river gave us Blackcap, a flock of Fieldfares overhead and Cormorants perched high above the water. The group divided again with either the ‘Jolly Sailor’ or Avon Farm routes being chosen. We saw more small flocks of Fieldfares and Redwings, a showy Mistle Thrush, a smart Jay and the usual small birds. As we neared Avon Farm a Red Kite was spotted along with a Linnet. Then it was an easy walk back down the road to our lunch venue, picking up Green and Great Spotted Woodpeckers and a good number of Greenfinches as well as more Goldcrests, Goldfinch and small groups of Tits. Our splendid Christmas lunch gave us an opportunity to thank Graham Blacker for organising our well-attended, popular Tuesday walks. It was good to keep up the Tuesday Group Christmas walk and lunch tradition. Thanks to Mike Landen for arranging it so efficiently; a most enjoyable occasion all round with fine weather and plenty of birds, 36 species altogether. Thanks to Robert for leading and managing to get us back for lunch in a timely fashion! Anne Crowe\n\nTuesday 05 December – Chew Valley Leader: Mike Landen\n\nIt was a dull, cold day so it was not surprising that just 15 of us arrived at Chew Magna, the new meeting place for this walk. The first part of the walk was quiet with mainly common species including Robin, Blackbird and Blue Tit. Turning off Denny Lane the path widens out. We soon spotted a mixed flock of about 70 Fieldfares and Redwings, a Kestrel was hovering and a Sparrowhawk was in flight. A flock of at least 14 Magpies was noted, followed by a Buzzard. A Grey Wagtail, a flock of about 20 Woodpigeon and a flock of Starlings was seen. A house with garden feeders probably accounted for quite a large number of birds in the surrounding trees that included Blue Tit, Great Tit, Goldfinch, Greenfinch, Collared Dove and Feral Pigeon. A Great Spotted Woodpecker flew over. Towards the lake more Redwings were seen and a Bullfinch heard. At the Lake, we heard the distinctive, loud call of a Cetti’s Warbler from the reed-bed. A Goldcrest was heard and there were good views of a female Stonechat. On the lake itself good numbers of Coot, Tufted Duck, Pochard, Teal, Goosander, Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe, Little Grebe, Little Egret, Great White Egret, Common Gull and Lesser Black-backed Gull were present. We had good views of both male and female Goldeneye and a Kingfisher flying across the Lake. Some had a fleeting view of a Green Sandpiper. On the return leg, a group of seven Long-tailed Tits and a Treecreeper were seen. It was a pleasant walk with a total of 55 species. Thanks to Alan and Nick for keeping the record of birds..\n\n(Also thanks to Mike for leading) Mike Landen\n\nSaturday 02 December – Eastville Park Leader: Rich Scantlebury\n\nFive hardy members met, two of whom were new to the club, myself included. This was my first walk with the BOC. The weather was very cold, still and foggy. Frost laden spider webs were in great abundance throughout the morning. With the weather conditions what they were we had to rely on hearing as well as visual identification. The walk began down past Thingwall Park allotments with Carrion Crow, Magpie, Robin and Blue Tits. We reached the Frome Valley Walkway and turned north to find a single Kingfisher, which we were privileged enough to see actually catching fish. For me this was the highlight of the walk., We continued by the river and saw large numbers of Long-tailed Tits feeding in the trees as well as Great Tits. Also, hiding in ivy on a tree trunk was a Goldcrest. Then we turned south towards Eastville Park lake. Here we heard a Great Spotted Woodpecker drumming in the woods, this sound accompanied us around the frozen lake. On the lake were Mute Swan, Mallard, Black-headed Gulls, Moorhen, Coot, a large flock of Feral Pigeons and a Grey Heron. With the cold becoming more bitter we began our return to the start point. Here we were lucky enough to see a couple of Redwings along with Robin, Pied Wagtail and Jay. We also checked the brook for any signs of Dippers, but today they were elusive. A total of 24 species seen. Thanks to Richard for leading. Chris Holloway\n\nTuesday 28 November – Lansdown, Bath Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nFourteen people set off from Lansdown P&R for an almost five mile level walk; weather, though gloomy remained dry and still. We set off across the playing field passing the first of over a hundred Common Gulls, and then skirted the racecourse. At the busy roadside we found a small group of Collared Doves and a fine pair of Stonechats. Suddenly a big flock of around 500 Golden Plovers appeared in the sky, Peregrine in pursuit. We were treated to a great display. The path through the golf course brought us Goldcrests in the conifers and took us to our coffee stop by the Racecourse stables. Here was a very showy Raven, which turned out to be one of a pair, and many Fieldfares and Redwings enjoying the berries, and a Kestrel. The next leg was through woodland where we had good views of Treecreeper, Nuthatch and other usual suspects. Then it was time to turn back through the muddy fields on the other side of the busy main road, passing a large flock of corvids, mostly Jackdaws. Trees and bushes along the way contained good numbers of Chaffinches with a few Linnet, Goldfinches and Meadow Pipits; Skylarks were seen. Nearing the end we were pleased with a flock of Starlings flying up onto the telegraph wires next to us. It had been a rewarding walk, in spite of the Golden Plover not settling down in their usual field for us, with good sized flocks of birds and 37 species altogether. Thanks to Robert our leader. Anne Crowe\n\nSunday 26 November – Somerset Levels Leader: Nick Page\n\nSix of us met in the RSPB car park for the Club walk. It was well timed, between all the rain and floods and then the cold, allowing us to enjoy a lovely stroll around Ham Wall. A Firecrest was seen right next to car park which didn’t linger until the walk started properly, but we had excellent looks at another later – such a great little bird. We quickly picked up Redwing, Fieldfare and a Great White Egret, before Snipe, grebes and diving ducks at the first viewing platform. The next part along the main path was fantastic with the Firecrest, Goldcrests, Chiffchaff, before we picked up a large flock of finches. There were at least 40 birds, mostly Lesser Redpolls, which gave great views, and some Siskin and Goldfinches. We had seen Marsh Harriers all morning, but as we were heading back, we saw at least seven in the air together – such a great sight. On the way we saw the flock of finches again – the Redpoll were so quiet that they really took some spotting. As we arrived back to the first viewing platform, a Glossy Ibis decided to drop in – a lovely end to a great walk. A total of 58 species was seen. Thanks to those that came along – lots of great company amongst the excellent birds (and thanks to Nick for leading). Nick Page\n\nTuesday 21 November – Hillesley Leader: Alan Craddock\n\nA change of leader; from that advertised, a dull dank day, but 17 wasn’t a bad sized group to squelch our way round the thoughtfully provided route details (thanks Graham). A flight of white doves attracted our notice but were only a distraction from the tail bobbing Stonechat that showed very well. A few Skylarks called as they travelled east across the fields and couple of cock Pheasants strutted their stuff. Many winter thrushes flew over but not in any particular direction, with scope work required to count and check ID. As we drank our coffee a trio of Stock Doves winged over and our displaced leader appeared to wish us well before he departed for home. The first pond contained a nice Little Grebe, a clucking Moorhen, some Mallards, three white ducks and a beautiful ‘small’ greylag shaped goose. Up the hill a nice stand of conifer, Ash, and Alder contained Goldfinch, Redwing and a good number of Siskin. We crossed the stream, continuing uphill; and onto the Cotswold Way, where, not far on, someone spotted a Treecreeper, which was accompanied by Goldcrest, Great Spotted Woodpecker and Nuthatch – a fine collection. More winter thrushes continued to pass through as we headed home, with a final Great Spotted Woodpecker seeing us back to the cars. Many thanks also to the stand in leader, Alan. Nick Hawkridge\n\nSunday 19 November – Uphill and Bleadon Leader: Jane Cumming\n\nFour BOC diehards turned up despite the fact that it was blowing a hooley from the west, so I had to stay and complete the WeBS count instead of going home to warm up by the fire – which is just as well, because the final numbers were pretty good for this much disturbed shoreline. It was hard to count accurately in the wind but together we decided on the duck numbers: 327 Shelduck, 180 Teal, a dozen Wigeon and about 20 Mallard. Then the waders: 42 Oystercatchers, two Ringed Plovers on the beach, a conservative estimate of at least 1500 Dunlins huddled together out on Black Rock, and about 75 Redshanks roosting almost invisibly along the muddy banks of the river. We could only pick out one Curlew until something spooked the birds and 24 more flew out of the long grass; then a Lapwing flock numbering at least 350 got up over the distant levels. Gull numbers were very low although two Common Gulls were of note; on my way home I passed large flocks in fields so a lot of them had probably sought shelter inland. Having done our WeBS duty we decided it wasn’t worth climbing Walborough Hill in the teeth of the gale, so after an hour we got gratefully back into our cars and left the walking bit for another day. (Thanks to Jane and her companions for sticking it out for the hour!) Jane Cumming\n\nTuesday 14 November – Easton in Gordano Leader: Judy Copeland\n\nHeavy rain was forecast but we were undeterred. Our small group of eight set off and in the first field we quickly spotted a large mixed flock of Goldfinches and Chaffinches, twelve Collared Doves all settled in one tree, two Greenfinches, Blackbird, Crow and Jackdaw. A female Great Spotted Woodpecker was perched high on a tree. An excellent start. Squelching onwards the next field provided Green Woodpecker, Blue Tit, Great Tit and Robin. A large flock of Redwings flew over with Fieldfares among them. The Skylark field was a delight with many Skylarks soaring above and singing, even in the rain. We were all rather sodden but fortunately found shelter in an old barn where we could wait out the worst of the storm and enjoy our coffee. The further fields provided more sightings of Skylark, Pied Wagtail, Chaffinch and Linnet. The rain finally stopped at midday, the sun came out and we could return to the start under blue skies while enjoying views over towards Bristol and Avonmouth. It was a lovely walk despite the rain, with a good tally of 25 species seen. Thanks to Judy for leading and Nick for keeping a bird count. Di Bunniss\n\nSunday 12 November – Goldcliff Lagoons, Gwent Leader: John Skinner\n\nFour brave souls arrived at the RSPB Newport Wetlands car park on a day planned to be Wetlands first, then Goldcliff. The forecast was dire, and it wasn’t far wrong. Low cloud and rain encouraged us to take good advice and go straight to Goldcliff and the shelter afforded by the hides. But first we had an interesting chat with a couple of RSPB guys in the Centre, and heard about the seven Bearded Tits seen earlier in the week, as well as the fly-by Bittern. After clocking our first Cetti’s call in the car park, and observing a crowd of Long-tailed Tits flitting in the trees, we headed for Curlew Hide, Goldcliff. In spite of the hanging mist and the rain, we had a good view of a Snipe across Monk’s Lagoon, a Wren called in front of us, and Wigeon, Teal, Shelduck, Shoveler and Gadwall were flushed as a Marsh Harrier wheeled overhead. During an easement of the rain, we walked to the sea wall as three Little Egret flew overhead and examined the estuary mud where Curlews were calling beautifully, Oystercatchers pottered, and Black-Headed and Herring Gulls were seen. No Avocet at Avocet hide but plenty of Curlews, a Cormorant, Greylag Goose, as well as a Stonechat pair and a Robin plus plenty of ducks. The weather was still excessively damp so we decided to finish the day, but on the way back to the cars we enjoyed Redwing, Fieldfare, Goldcrest, several tit species, Mistle Thrush, corvids, Dunnock, Chaffinch, and another Little Egret in the field. Species count was 37, not bad for only half a day and conditions less than ideal. (Many thanks to John for leading.) John Skinner\n\nTuesday 07 November – Between Chew and Blagdon Lakes Leaders; Sue and John Prince\n\n25 birders met at Heron’s Green in fine and sunny weather. The usual Mute Swans, Coots, Canada Geese, Great Crested Grebes, and ducks (Mallard, Wigeon, Teal, Tufted, and Pochard) were present. Little Grebe and Cetti’s Warbler called from Heron’s Pool. As we started up Breach Hill a Green Woodpecker called, and later we saw a Great Spotted Woodpecker. Pied Wagtails, Chaffinches, and a few Redwings were spotted as well as five Mistle Thrushes and a Fieldfare. At the coffee stop sweets were handed out to mark 25 years of Tuesday walks for the Princes. At Ubley Hatchery we had good views of a Buzzard, and heard Siskins. Tree surgeons had closed the lane but John persuaded them to let us through, saving a long detour. The final mile was quiet with just a Chiffchaff ‘wheeting’. In all we had 42 species and saw some lovely autumn colours.\n\n(Thanks to Sue and John for many years of leading). Sue Prince\n\nTuesday 31 October – Winscombe Leader: Sue Watson\n\nDespite heavy rain being forecast for the walk when crossing both the fields and up Sandford Hill, we were very lucky to have sunshine until returning back to our cars, when the rain started. The largest number and variety of birds were in the woods on the hill, including Jay, Goldcrest, Long-tailed Tits, all other ‘makes’ of Tit, Treecreeper and Robin. There were views of nearby terrain, the Mendips and down to Bridgwater Bay. Then as we descended in the open, there were also a couple of Ravens and Buzzards.\n\nThe walk was slightly shortened due to some time being lost, which had resulted in two people returning to the start. Therefore, 17 people set off and 15 finished. It was enjoyed by all with 27 species seen. (Thanks to Sue for leading). Sue Watson\n\nSaturday 28 October – Frampton Pools, Gloucestershire Leader: Peter Bryant\n\nA total of 52 species of bird were seen, testimony to the fact that Frampton Pools has a good range of habitats. Starting at Court Lake, eleven members quickly spotted a Great White Egret across the water. Ducks were relatively thin on the ground but Wigeon and Gadwall were seen as well as Tufted Duck and a single Greylag Goose. Two small birds flitting over the surface attracted our attention, the first being an unexpected Swallow. The second was a small gull, initially some distance away but after a while it conveniently performed a flight over the group who were able to confirm this was a first winter Little Gull. A Grey Wagtail, Grey Heron and Little Egret were also seen at Court Lake. At the Sailing Lake there was not much on the water, just a couple of Great Crested Grebes. The platform held several gulls and, after scoping these for a while, we confirmed they were Black-Headed Gulls, three Common Gulls and a Yellow-Legged Gull that was initially sitting down (which made positive identification challenging) but later stood up to show its bright yellow legs. A Sparrowhawk, two Buzzards, a Kestrel and three Ravens were also seen. There were a few Goldcrests in the trees between the lakes. (Thanks to Peter for leading) Peter Bryant\n\nTuesday 24 October – Wick-Golden Valley Leaders: Geoff and Gill Hardman\n\nA car park filling 27 walkers basked in the autumnal warmth with the calls of Jackdaw, Carrion Crow, and Rook nearly making chatting difficult! A flock of Fieldfares, a Moorhen and a Grey Heron were startled from their foraging as we headed up the valley. No Dipper could be found, but up the path, above the ochre quarry, Goldcrest, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Nuthatch and Treecreeper played hide and seek in the thickets and taller trees. Above the quarry a Peregrine flew and three Little Grebes, various gulls – including five Common plus seven Cormorants made good use of the abundant water. Our second Green Woodpecker was yaffling above us as we ate and supped our coffee. Swinging right at the road, we spotted both Grey and Pied Wagtail on the barns and Kestrel and Mistle Thrush on the power cables, with a lone Redwing in the adjacent field. Straight up the slope, with Blue and Great Tit in the hedges and a solitary Skylark calling as it passed over. Garden feeders at the corner house were well stocked and used by Nuthatch, Coal Tit, Greenfinch and the two Rhea in their garden compound on Bury Lane stood and stared back at us. Our final species count was 45, which included a Red Kite, skirting the hillside above the big house in the valley as we approached the pub. (Thanks to Geoff and Gill for leading.) Nick Hawkridge\n\nTuesday 17 October – Pucklechurch Leader: Graham Blacker\n\n18 members met outside HMP Ashfield for this new BOC walk around the lovely fields of Pucklechurch. As we entered the first of many fields we spotted lots of crows as we overlooked the amazing vista towards Lansdown. Proceeding onwards, Goldfinch were recorded along with Greenfinch surveying the scene from atop the trees. Leaving the first couple of fields we then walked a lovely quiet lane before once again finding a well-hidden footpath leading alongside a private property, the fields of which housed numerous very cute Alpacas who were only too pleased to greet us. We paused for coffee soon after this still enjoying the lovely views whilst three Buzzard gently hovered overhead. We plodded onward through a fairly muddy patch just before Blue Lodge – the house where Black Beauty was written. After a little more lane walking and into the final fields it was nice to see the top of Abson Church above the treetops. We spotted 29 species in all, the highlights being a Red Kite, Coal Tit, Goldcrest, Skylark, Mistle Thrush, Nuthatch, Green Woodpecker, Stock Dove and how lovely it was to see the return of eight Redwings and around 60 Fieldfares. A lovely day was had by all (Thanks to Graham for leading). Graham Blacker\n\nSunday 15 October – Cheddar Reservoir Leader: Nick Hawkridge\n\nI arrived early to check that the Drove was indeed under water, so our party of six had to head round the tank! Some Coot were noted, which we later estimated at 600-700 after they’d been pushed together at the western edge by the yacht club safety boats. A solitary Shoveler was found; the other 28 having been flushed off by a hot air balloon that came over Fry’s Hill early on. A party of Cormorants were hanging out to dry; including some white breasted juveniles, with a flock of Canada Geese cruising about close by. No waders were seen as the popularity of the site “forced” some visitors down to the water’s edge so their precious dogs could drink and play. The regular Red-crested Pochard was found in among some Mallards and Teal but no sign of the Pintail reported earlier. A couple of Grey Wagtails were seen early but cousin Pied were very numerous, as indeed were Meadow Pipit. A single Little Egret was spotted in the farmland to the west of the tank and a Grey Heron to the south. A Raven flew from its roost over to the south west accompanied by a ‘persecution’ of Corvids. A total of 34 species were seen or heard. Thanks to Alan for the bird list (and to Nick for leading). Nick Hawkridge\n\nTuesday 10 October – Tickenham Leaders: Jan Pridie and Lois Pryce\n\n18 members met in mild conditions, but misty to properly foggy. The birds at Tickenham village and moors were: Kestrel sleeping in church tower window, Cormorants including a juvenile sitting on one of the new style electricity pylons, a distant Peregrine sitting on another new pylon – confirmed from a photo after the meeting, Little Egret, Grey Heron including a confiding juvenile with smart black head, a Chiffchaff and a big group of Rooks swirling over the village. At the Golf course and paths in and out of woods: a Sparrowhawk, Pied Wagtail, a third year Herring Gull paddling for worms, a mixed tit flock of 16 or more, a flock of Long-tailed Tits, a small group of Goldcrests, a Bullfinch and Goldfinches, Green and Great Spotted Woodpeckers, Buzzard, and a Jay. At Cadbury Camp were a Mistle Thrush in a distant tree soon to be rendered invisible by thickening mist, Meadow Pipit, Skylark, and an unidentified finch and warbler flock on a Hawthorn tree. Total 29 species (Thanks to Jan and Lois for leading). Jan Pridie and Lois Pryce\n\nSaturday 07 October – Clevedon Leader: Jane Cumming\n\nFive members met in Old Church Road and set off for the harbour, a sixth joining us later. The weather was dry and mild (16-18C) but the westerly wind had a chill. In the harbour we saw the usual gulls and Mallard, plus Grey Heron, Little Egret, Oystercatcher, Cormorant and Curlew. There were a pair of Stonechats, a Common Sandpiper, a Meadow Pipit and a Wheatear in the harbour as we walked on toward the Blind Yeo outlet. Moorhen were on the Blind Yeo and a single Cetti’s Warbler singing. We carried on past the golf course, seeing a family group of Greenfinches and several Skylarks, the latter to be present for the rest of the walk. A single Great Black-backed Gull was spotted when looking back toward the harbour. A Peregrine was seen on one of the radio masts with prey, also a Kestrel. As we carried on past Dowlais, there was another pair of Stonechats, a\n\nWheatear, flocks of Goldfinches and Linnet, more Meadow Pipits and Skylarks. At the farthest reach of the walk (Kingston Pill) there was a flock of 300+ Shelducks, one Wigeon, a few Teal, and Curlews, Oystercatcher, Redshank, Grey Heron and a Common Sandpiper. Out on the mud we managed a Bar-tailed Godwit and six\n\nDunlins. We returned, some by the same route, the rest taking a shortcut by car. Total 39 species. Thanks to Jane for leading. Alan Daniells\n\nTuesday 03 October – Portbury Wharf Leader: Roger Hawley\n\nTwenty two birders gathered and after an early shower the clouds dispersed and sunny skies were a pleasure. The rail bridge made a good viewpoint over the Gordano Valley and yielded Robin, Great Tit and Chaffinch. At Wharf Lane both Chiffchaff and Collard Dove were seen, and from the first hide a Stonechat, Swallows, Gadwall and Skylark. Further on a Little Egret got up from one of the ditches and in the distance a Buzzard turned lazily. Goldfinches were busy on the Teasels and there was a loud protest from a Cetti’s Warbler. The tower hide gave\n\nus good views over the salt marsh with Canada Geese, Black-headed Gull, Teal, Shelduck and Lesser Black-backed Gull showing well. In the fields, on the return leg of the walk, more Little Egret, a Jay and a flyover Raven – calling as it went. Our final species was Kestrel, one hovering and another perched on its nest box platform giving great views and a final and very satisfactory total of 47 species (Thanks to Roger for leading).\n\nSaturday 30 September – Steart WWT Leader: Richard Belson\n\nEight members assembled at the WWT car park. We quickly made our way over to the River Parrett and en route heard Water Rail and Cetti’s Warblers, and enjoyed views of Reed Bunting and Stonechat plus a perched Kestrel. Waders on the edges of the river were in relatively low numbers and distant but Black-tailed Godwit and Curlew were seen as well as a perched Marsh Harrier and a pair of ‘formation hovering’ Kestrels. Next stop was the Quantocks Hide with its view over several shallow pools. In between searching for waders, we identified Meadow Pipits (in their buff autumnal plumage) and Pied Wagtails with a few White Wagtails amongst them. Four Wheatears were seen in the grass edges to the pools with Linnets and Goldfinches adding colour to the scene. As the waders were quite distant, it took some time to identify them with confidence – 30+ lapwings, four Ruff, a Green Sandpiper, single Ringed and Golden Plovers and a long-necked, heavily streaked wader delicately poking its long bill into the mud which another birder later suggested was a juvenile Greenshank. Teal and Gadwall were amongst the Mallards. Two distant white blobs were identified as (very sleepy) Spoonbills. The breach, at the end of the peninsula, was relatively quiet although Little Egrets were numerous here. Birds seen included a fly-over Spoonbill, two Ravens, a Kestrel, two Marsh Harriers and a Sparrowhawk plus our first geese (Canada and Greylag). 47 species seen during the day. (Thanks to Richard for leading and to Alan Daniells for compiling the bird list) Peter Bryant\n\nTuesday 26 September – Stanton Drew Leader: Alan Craddock\n\n25 members set off from the car park of the Druids Inn and headed swiftly down the road to assemble on the farm track. A good variety of birds immediately made themselves known including Dunnocks, two Collared Doves, a Wren and a Chiffchaff. Moving on, a young Buzzard was calling insistently from its perch on a hedge on the skyline. Nearing our coffee stop at Bye Mills, we came across a mixed flock of Long Tailed, Blue and Great Tits and a panicked Moorhen made a desperate dash for the reeds and safety. Whilst we were having coffee a pair of Grey Wagtails put on a lively show whizzing back and forth below the sluice gates and two Kestrels made an appearance. We then came across a very industrious group of biscuit powered young folk on a day out from work who were planting a new hedge for Bristol Avon Rivers Trust. Good habitat for the future! Pensford came and went with no Dippers seen along with a report that they had been driven off by Mink activity. On the hill out, we heard a Green Woodpecker and saw a Great Spotted Woodpecker as we passed a gate into an open field. Approaching Upper Stanton Drew, we sighted four Jays and a Magpie flying across our path. On the way back we spotted Meadow Pipits on the ground and Goldfinches feeding on thistles. 34 species in total. (Thanks to Alan for leading). Alan Craddock\n\nTuesday 19 September – Hawkesbury Upton Leaders: The Committee\n\nAfter a lively discussion on who was taking the walk in the place of our absent leader and where exactly the walk went, seven members set out into the constant wind and lightly drizzling rain. After exiting the outskirts of Hawkesbury, we spotted a couple of Pied Wagtails and a solitary Magpie amongst the Carrion Crows at a field boundary, and a telephone line full of Starlings. Further on, a field ahead of us provided around 50 Common Gulls along with a couple of Lesser Black-backed Gulls. Following the Marshfield Path uphill, we spotted a couple of Stonechats. We then pressed on across a newly ploughed field to our coffee stop in the thankfully windless shelter of Bodkin Hazel Wood. Two House Martins made a distant appearance and a Wren gave us a quick burst of song for entertainment. Back into the wind and a long slog down a track between cornfields seemed birdless but we found a Robin and a Chiffchaff for solace. Crossing Highfield Lane gave us the shelter of the woods above Horton Court and at last some birdlife in variety. Blue Tit, Chaffinch, Blackbird, Robin and a pair of Ravens were seen and a Treecreeper and a Marsh Tit heard. The weather was starting to close in so we beat a hasty retreat back. 28 species in total. (Thanks to the “committee” for leading.) Alan Craddock\n\nTuesday 12 September – Cheddar Reservoir and Yeo Leader: Mark Watson\n\nThe sky was overcast as 16 of us assembled on the reservoir bank to start our walk. On the water were large numbers of Coot, along with Canada Geese, Mallard, Teal, Shoveler, Tufted Duck and Great Crested Grebe. Gulls seen were Black-headed, Herring, and Lesser Black-backed. As we walked along the bank skeins of Canada Geese flew in to join those already on the water. The forecast rain came down quite heavily for about 30 minutes as we left the reservoir and went down the bank to the drove leading us to the Axe. On the way we saw or heard Blue Tit, House Sparrow, Chiffchaff, Magpie and at the Axe a Buzzard in a distant hedgerow tree. On the way back to Axbridge a Sparrowhawk was being chased by a Raven and two Carrion Crows. Suddenly the Sparrowhawk stooped spectacularly into some Swallows below, leaving the Raven and Crow high above. On this occasion the Sparrowhawk did not get its target. Both Great Spotted and Green Woodpecker were seen as well as Linnets, Goldfinch and a Treecreeper. Back on the Reservoir a few Cormorant perched on buoys and numerous Pied Wagtail foraged on the slope down to the water. We saw 36 species (thanks to Alan Daniells for keeping a list) and arrived back at the car park more or less dry. (Thanks to Mark for leading). Mark Watson\n\nSaturday 09 September – Chipping Sodbury Common Leader: Mike Jackson\n\nEleven of us met for a morning walk of the common, but before we got there we spied three warblers feeding on sweet peas in an allotment. Two Chiffchaffs and a Willow Warbler we decided, although it could have gone the other way such are the similarities of this tricky duo! Birds were notably absent as we followed the fruit laden hedgerow onto the common but a Chaffinch showed, and a Kestrel perched atop a distant bush, while Sparrowhawk and Buzzard soared above us. Eventually we caught up with some target species; at least two Spotted Flycatchers hunted from some dead branches above Blackcap, Lesser Whitethroat and Redstart which remained much more skulking. It was easy to locate a couple of flyover Skylarks, and a Raven honked unseen. The temperature was now uncomfortably hot, and with no shade or breeze two or three members decided to leave. Two Whitethroats arrived at another hedgerow at our walk mid-point but from now on only Redstarts seemed to have the energy to show themselves as we walked on in a temperature of 28°C. We recorded at least eight Redstarts and probably heard a couple more, definitely the star bird of the day. Thanks go to Alan for keeping the score (he had seen a Whinchat on his way to meet us pre-walk start time) and thanks to the group for being so patient. (Thanks to Mike for leading.) Mike Jackson\n\nTuesday 05 Sept – Puxton Leader: Colin Hawkins\n\n15 members met at Puxton Church of the Holy Saviour on a glorious sunny day. We wandered through the grounds of the 13th century church where one Goldfinch was spotted. We proceeded through to Puxton Lane and across Puxton Moor Nature Reserve. En route we saw two Collared Doves, over 30 Starlings perched on the telegraph wires, about nine Swallows in different places, one Long-tailed Tit, one Swan and one Cormorant flew overhead, and one Robin(heard, not spotted), as well as many Magpies and Crows in the fields. Some of the group saw two Stonechats. Goldfinches, approximately 50, were feeding on the thistle seed in the fields too. Further on we heard a very loud Cetti’s Warbler, two Buzzards were spotted in the distance, and a Green Woodpecker in the lanes. Later we heard and saw two Buzzards fly overhead. We headed down along Oldbridge River where we encountered at least five Mute Swans, including a family with one adolescent cygnet. On the way back at least five Long-tailed Tits flew across our path into the nearby trees and there were two Herons, two Kestrel (not together), one Lesser Black-backed Gull, a Coot and two Moorhens, one Great Tit, two Mallards, House Sparrows, House Martins and Jackdaws. Dragonflies accompanied us throughout our walk. Thanks to Colin for leading us in this very interesting and enjoyable walk. Alison Hooper\n\nSaturday 02 September – Goldcliff Pools, Gwent Leader: Peter Bryant\n\nThe weather seemed fair and the walk started with a perched Kestrel and fly-past Marsh Harrier. Three Stonechats were perched on a gate and a pair of Chiffchaffs were flitting in the nearby hedgerow. For most of the morning, there were over a hundred hirundines in flight, mostly House Martins but with a few Swallow. At Curlew Hide, overlooking Monks Lagoon, we initially only saw a half dozen Greylag Geese. but soon we were picking out waders, including Ringed Plovers by the dozen and four smart Ruff. The Lagoon held seven Little Egrets. As we were past high tide, we decided to head round to the Avocet Hide which had a view of both Priors Lagoon and Becs Lagoon. Highlights here included four Snipe, several Redshank, ten each of Knot and Black-tailed Godwit, a Curlew Sandpiper, a Greenshank, an Avocet and a Great White Egret. Six Little Grebe were on Priors Lagoon. The ducks included Shoveler, Wigeon, Tufted Duck, Gadwall and Teal. As we were preparing to leave the hide, a Kestrel flew across joined by a Sparrowhawk – a good chance to see the different flight patterns of these birds of prey side by side. The beach, viewed from the seawall, eventually produced 180 Curlew and an Oystercatcher. From the Lapwing viewing platform, we had a good view out to the recently cut hay fields and some birds sitting on the hay bales attracted our attention. A few were Meadow Pipits but most were Yellow Wagtails, over twenty in all. 62 species seen with a good variety of waders and other passage migrants. (Thanks to Peter for leading.) Peter Bryant\n\nTuesday 29 August – Hambrook. Leaders: Joyce Donkor and Kate Cashmore\n\nOn a cool, overcast day, with some very light misty showers, 26 birders started on the Frome Valley Walkway from the White Horse Inn, after a look from the stone bridge where a Grey Wagtail was seen in the river. At Moorend, 16 Mallards and a Moorhen were swimming in the river. The garden feeders there attracted Blue Tits and a Chaffinch. Soon Great Tits, Coal Tits and a Long-tailed Tit were added. A Swallow and 33 House Martins flew above the houses. The walk along the lane and up through the woods produced two calling Stock Doves, two Jays, a Bullfinch, four Goldfinches, three Goldcrests, and two Treecreepers. A Chiffchaff was also seen and heard. Some lucky people saw a Kingfisher flash past at the coffee stop by Damsons Bridge. Despite careful looking from all the bridges, no Dippers were seen this time, but a Grey Heron was striding through a field. The final fields were mostly quiet except for Robin, Wren and Woodpigeon. The only bird of prey for the day was a Buzzard. 28 species were seen. (Thanks to Kate and Joyce for leading). Kate Cashmore\n\nTuesday 22 August – East Harptree Woods. Leader: Geoff Harris\n\n19 members joined Geoff in the East Harptree car park, not realising what was in store for them. Our route took us past Smithams Chimney, then downhill across fields. It took some time to safely cross the cattle field but the reward was Spotted Flycatchers. We then went down Harptree Coombe which was difficult going with many fallen trees and a lot of mud. Then across to Morgan’s Cottage and eventually back to the car park, a distance of just over three miles. In total the group identified 27 species including Red Kite and Sparrowhawk. There were great views of Swallows and House Martins feeding on the wing and among the other birds were Great Spotted Woodpecker and Blackcap. One member of the party was particularly pleased to see a Nuthatch as this was a lifer for them. Many thanks to Geoff for leading the walk on a lovely sunny morning and to Alan for his bird list. Beth Yates\n\nSunday 20 August – Blagdon Lake. Leader: Robert Hargreaves\n\nNine people met at The Lodge at 10.00 on a pleasant, sunny morning. A few early birders had already had a look at the dam and found two Common Sandpiper. We were greeted by Nigel Milbourne, who took us down to the water’s edge to scan around the lake. Sand and House Martins were flying around and we could see other birds on the dam including three Egyptian Geese and two Pied Wagtail. We set off around the lake finding many small birds in the trees and bushes including Willow Warbler, Chiffchaff, Blackcap, Goldcrest, Nuthatch, and Treecreeper.\n\nTuesday 15 August – Sandford Wood. Leader: Graham Blacker\n\nDespite August being a slow month for birds and Graham warning of steep and possibly muddy paths, 20 members met in the car park of the Railway Inn. Our route took us up into Sandford Wood, then Lyncombe Wood and through the grounds of the Ski Centre (Mendip Activity Centre) where elevenses were enjoyed. Then along tracks to Pylewell and back via Sandford Batch. Birds were hard to find but we were compensated by many lovely flowers and butterflies. Eventually the group recorded 32 species, of which my highlight was a flock of Swallows stocking up on food for their migration flight. The group also located Sparrowhawk, Kestrel, and Peregrine as well as Great Spotted and Green Woodpeckers. Of the smaller birds, the group’s list included Blackcap, Nuthatch, Bullfinch and Spotted Flycatcher. Many thanks to our leader Graham for a lovely rain-free morning and to Alan for his bird list. Beth Yates\n\nTuesday 08 August – Arlingham. Leader: Alastair Fraser\n\nOur optimistic band of twelve set out in the drizzle, beginning our walk beside drainage ditches at the village edge. Apart from Woodpigeons, not much to see, even on the bird feeders in the gardens. More luck later with a variety of woodland and farmland birds: eight Long-tailed tits, Blue tit, Great tit, Chiffchaff, Wren, Blackbird, Robin, Feral Pigeon, Stock Dove, Collared Dove, Greenfinch, Linnet and 33 House Martins. Just past the farm buildings the hedgerow was alive with c100 House Sparrows which flew off as we approached, and over the wheat fields we saw Skylarks and Swallows. The low tide exposed extensive sand banks, and from the sea wall, thanks to Alan’s scope, we saw 26 Ringed Plovers, also Black-headed Gull, Herring Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Little Egret, Mallard and Grey Heron. There was a good view of a Whinchat, and over 50 Goldfinches moved to and fro between the trees and the thistle seeds near the river and flew off en masse, perhaps due to the Sparrowhawk that came over soon afterwards. As we passed the slurry pit a Green Sandpiper and a Hobby went over and Reed Warbler was heard in the reeds nearby. Other birds spotted were Buzzard, Magpie, Jackdaw, Carrion Crow, Willow Warbler, Swift, Pheasant, Pied Wagtail, Moorhen and Dunnock. The intermittent drizzle did not spoil the walk, and we were rewarded with a very pleasing count of 40 species. Thanks to Alan for the tally and Alastair for leading. Carol Clark\n\nSunday 06 August – Clevedon Pill. Leader: Jane Cumming\n\nThere were 15 in the group that gathered on a warm but windy Sunday for this popular walk. We were fortunate that the tide was coming in, bringing the birds into closer view. Common Sandpipers were resting on the lowest edge of the cliff, Oystercatchers were on the shore line and Whinchat and Meadow Pipit on the near shore among the rocks. Walking on, we saw Swifts, soon to leave us for another year. Rock Pipits were flitting along the rocky shore, and a solitary Skylark soared. A flock of Linnets flew past, and more were seen as we walked. At the far end where the path ends, we could see many Curlews among the gulls, with Redshank, Turnstone, Dunlin and many Black-headed Gulls with a few Lesser Black-backed gulls among them. The sun was rapidly disappearing behind ominous clouds and rain threatened but held off as we made our way back. An Egret landed in the reeds, more Linnets seen and a Heron flew over. The tide was by now very high and the waves were coming over the path forcing us to dodge the spray. Hastily leaving for higher ground we were soon retracing our steps back to the Blind Yeo, where there were a few Moorhens to be seen. At the Pill the tide was now well in and on the lower cliffs were many Oystercatchers sheltering with the gulls. 43 species recorded. Thanks to Jane for leading. DI Bunniss\n\nTuesday, 01 August – Prior’s Wood, Portbury. Leader: Judy Copeland\n\nSunshine and warmth – No rain! And 26 people. Jackdaws foraged on the Green, a Collared Dove on a roof and a Herring Gull above. In the wood we heard Great Tit, Wren, Coal Tit, Chiffchaff, Blue Tit, Robin and Chaffinch. A Goldcrest was quite close on a hanging conifer branch and our first Nuthatch was calling loudly. Several more heard and seen during the walk, Treecreepers too. At the coffee break by the gate to Charlton Farm, an Avon Wildlife Trust van arrived with helmeted staff and chain saws – fallen trees. On the path down to the stream were more helmeted people cutting bracken – hard work! We heard a Buzzard and saw a Great Spotted Woodpecker on a high branch. The odd Swallow and Swift flew over. Among the fungi we encountered, Jean identified Black Bulgar which grows only on dead oak branches. A really good sighting was a Spotted Flycatcher, very white at the top of a Silver Birch, then flying. We climbed to the field above the wood, then crossed into a field bordering the drive to the Downs School. A Kestrel on a wire flew up causing 50 plus Jackdaws to lift off and circle over. Out in the open, after returning through the wood, were several hawker dragonflies flying over the path. Butterflies included Green-veined White, other Whites, Speckled Wood, Comma and Gatekeeper. We heard Greenfinch back in Portbury with House Martins flying over. Total species 32. (Thanks to Judy for leading). Judy Copeland\n\nSaturday 29 July – Chew Valley Lake – Leader: Nick Page\n\nTwelve of us met at Herriotts Bridge to look at a very full pool, which is not currently as good for waders as it used to be. There were many Teal and a Little Grebe family among the usual suspects. After a while we managed to pick out the Spotted Redshank that we hoped for and a Great White Egret was splendid in flight. As we started to move to Herons Green, some of the party picked up Green and Common Sandpiper before they left. At Herons Green there was a Common Sandpiper, and a juvenile Little Ringed Plover was well found. A pale Buzzard, many Pied Wagtail and a Great Crested Grebe with a young chick were the other highlights of this stop. We then walked to the Villice Bay hide and most of the way around Nunnery Point. The day was a warm one without much rain, and butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies were out in force in the un-mown meadows, testing our knowledge and ID skills. There were many nice conversations and I really enjoyed ‘leading’ my first BOC walk; thanks to everyone for making it an enjoyable morning (Thanks to Nick for leading). Nick Page\n\nTuesday 25 July – Woodchester – Leader: Di Bunniss\n\nWe gathered in the car park and set off along the downhill path towards the mansion. The woodland was quiet but the display of butterflies was a source of great interest, with the Silver-Washed Fritillary being the star. A Treecreeper was seen, House Martins were circling high above, and Chiffchaff called. Our designated Coffee break at the Boat House was enhanced by a National Trust volunteer who gave an informative talk on the history of the valley and the work being done in the surrounding woods and fields. From the Boat House to the lunch spot was but a short stroll along a board walk fringing the lake and through a field, where we heard the call of the Bullfinch to add to the bird list. More butterflies and flowers were identified and admired. Once at the lunch spot, some sought the shelter of the old Dog Kennels (a large barn with picnic tables) while the others rested at the lakeside. On the lake were two Mandarin ducks in the rather drabber eclipse plumage, and a small family of Blackcaps feeding close by. On the return path we had more Blackcaps and Chiffchaffs with Buzzards circling overhead. By the mansion a Raven was calling close by. Another long rest here was required before we tackled the gentle uphill path back to the car park. 29 bird species recorded and eight species of butterfly. (Thanks to Di for leading and organising the NT talk.) Di Bunniss\n\nSunday 23 July – Oldbury Power Station – Leader: Di Bunniss\n\nEight of us met to walk around the lake, lagoons and riverside. The weather was cool and "
