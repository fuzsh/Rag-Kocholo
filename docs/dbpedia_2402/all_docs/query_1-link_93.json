        "text": "CIS Accreditation\n\nWe received confirmation this week that our application for re-accreditation with the Council of International Schools (CIS) has been successful. This is an excellent achievement and comes as a result of the dedicated commitment of the staff, College Advisory Council, many students and parents\n\nwho contributed in various ways to both the report and the Team Evaluation visit in March. CIS Accreditation is rigorous and benchmarked against international standards of school excellence. It demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement and the recommendations from the review team of international educators will help shape our next 5 year School Improvement Plan. Special thanks to Mrs Janet Blackwell who coordinated our application for accreditation.\n\nNAPLAN\n\nStudents in both Year 7 and Year 9 have commenced NAPLAN tests this week. We see NAPLAN providing another avenue of feedback to supplement the various sources of assessment undertaken at the College by the classroom teacher which, combined, help to build a picture to measure progress for each student. These tests also play a role at the systems level of education as there are benchmarks set for performance in various aspects of Literacy and Numeracy and governments value these measures to assess the effectiveness of our education systems. There is, of course, continued public debate and diversity of opinion in the educational community about the value of NAPLAN. Some see these tests as an unnecessary additional stress on young people and, while some performance anxiety is actually healthy, we endeavour to reassure those who seem worried that there is little to fear. Thanks to Mrs Rachel Crawley, Head Middle Years, and the middle years’ teachers for ensuring that the NAPLAN tests have been administered as smoothly as possible. I also congratulate the students for participating conscientiously and giving their best effort.\n\nAll State Jazz Championships\n\nGenerations in Jazz in Mt Gambier was cancelled for the second year straight amid CovidSafe guidelines and it was a real pleasure to see an event for Victorian schools offered instead at St Leonard’s College over recent weekends. Aquinas students from Senior Harmony, Harmony Tribes, Senior Stage Band, and the Intermediate Stage Band represented the College with pride and performed very well. Some great results were achieved as you will see in this edition of The Lighthouse. A special mention needs to go to Mrs Lisa Sully who led both choirs and was awarded the inaugural “All State Jazz Vocal Director Award”. Our Harmony Tribes choir was invited to perform in a showcase of talent on Saturday night amidst the outstanding musicians from the competing schools and a cast of professional performers.\n\nEISM Athletics Champions Carnival\n\nOn Monday afternoon a group of athletes represented Aquinas College at Lakeside Stadium as part of the EISM Champions Carnival. This carnival provides an opportunity for individuals to test themselves against the top performers in our association and I congratulate all of the competitors for taking on this challenge. Thanks to Mr Bernie Brummel and Ms Jess Lane for supporting the participants on this occasion.\n\nRestaurant Night\n\nLast week I had the great pleasure of attending a Restaurant Night in the Wurundjeri Trade Training Centre and must commend the students on the high standards of food preparation and service. It is clear that there are high expectations from their teachers and the students strive to meet or exceed these professional standards. I highly recommend that you book in via the College website to partake in this excellent opportunity.\n\nRe-accreditation as a Registered Training Organisation\n\nOn the topic of our Wurundjeri Trade Training Centre, I am pleased to announce that we have been formally re-accredited as an RTO for the next five years by the Victorian Registrations and Qualifications Authority (VRQA). Thank you to Mrs Judy Zuccon, Mr Owen Stott and Mrs Heather Neil who put together the information in response to our audit to demonstrate that we meet or exceed all of the required standards.\n\nYear 8 Camps\n\nYear 8 Camps have now finished and the feedback has been very positive. The students appear to have risen to the challenges that were presented with great enthusiasm and an appreciation of the opportunity to test themselves. I want to acknowledge the dedicated staff who make this experience possible by generously giving of their time and expertise. Reports from the camp leaders have been glowing in their praise for the students. Camps often bring special challenges and we are blessed at Aquinas to have outstanding professionals who are able to make sure that the students have a rewarding and safe experience.\n\nSchool Closure Day - Advance Notice\n\nWednesday, June 9 is a whole school closure day and there will not be any scheduled classes conducted. All students undertaking a VCE Unit 3/4 subject will be required to undertake the General Achievement Test (GAT) on this date and this is a major logistical exercise at the College. Teachers will have an opportunity on this day to work in an area of their choosing around planning, assessment, reporting, or other professional development. Thank you for your continued support.\n\nDarren Atkinson\n\nPrincipal\n\nParent Teacher Night Feedback\n\nThis week is a report from the Parent Teacher Night Survey. The survey is still open and you can still respond, but I thought you might appreciate knowing some of the findings while the event is still fresh in our minds. At the time of writing 275 responses had been tabled. This represents around a 22% response rate for the community. (Inside these parentheses will be a brief discussion on response rates and margins of error which you can skip if you just want to get to the information. On a survey which is sent out a response rate of between 5-30% is usual, above 50% is an excellent response. Statisticians then determine a margin or error based on the responses versus the total population, so for results such as ours the margin of error is about +/-5%. What this means is that if we have a preference of 80% in agreement, we can be confident that that number is somewhere between 75 and 85%. If you want to know more about this you can read here and here).\n\nSo here is what the survey responses said.\n\nIn a choice between in person and online interviews, more than 80% of respondents preferred online Parent Teacher Interviews\n\nWhen asked to rate three statements where 1 represented very difficult and 5 very straightforward, respondents rated signing up, getting timeslots and connecting to the PTIs in the following ways\n\nRespondents were asked to rate ten statements as to which were the four most important. This was to help us to focus on what was most important for teachers to cover in an 8 minute interview. The table below shows how many respondents rated the statement in the first four (% total header) and in the second column how many rated it as most important (%MI).\n\nFrom this example you can see that 79% of all respondents included “I want to know about academic progress” in their top four and 41.8% rated this as most important. While “I want to know how well the teacher knows my child as a person” was included in 32% of all responses, many parents felt it was the most important feature.\n\nSome of the many comments made included:\n\n“All my important questions were addressed”\n\n“All the teachers we met were well organised with work to discuss.”\n\n“Conversations were good but short. I asked to find out what could be done to improve performance.”\n\n“I find that the systems you use enable me to stay pretty much up to date with my kids' work progress and results, so I have not prioritised that here, although I do very much value having access to this information. I do value getting a chance to meet their teachers”\n\n“Unable to book slots with some teachers. Slots exhausted.”\n\n“I was keen to see how my child had settled into class this year. It is another way I can show my child I am supportive of his learning. It helped me understand teachers' expectations more.”\n\n“They were impersonal and lacked structure and content that I have previously experienced with face to face PTIs.”\n\n“The main focus to me is how my child is going and suggested strategies for improvement.”\n\n“Loved it being online. Felt we got the same experience but better than being face to face”\n\n“Very well run and I loved the ease of being at home, however, I did miss the social connection with other staff, leadership and other parents that the school based interviews provides, but that said, this is also a great opportunity for all to be online and in comfort.”\n\n“If it is decided that face to face interviews will run in the future, it would be great to have a mixture with an option for online interviews as well.”\n\nAs you would expect not all comments were positive. We understand that some people had difficulty signing up, some people had issues with connectivity, some felt that more detail about who should attend would have helped and some felt that the meetings were not as personal or developed as in person. Some felt they should have been earlier in the year. These are all views that we will take into account when making future decisions.\n\nIn Term 3 we will run Senior School PTIs and progress meetings as part of Subject Selection for the Years 7 to 10. We will use this information to contribute to how the meetings should be conducted.\n\nThe form will close on Friday May 14th (today).\n\nTo express your view click here to access the form.\n\nMichael Box\n\nDeputy Principal Learning\n\nOn happiness…\n\nThere is no doubt that we are a very fortunate society and for most people living in it, the prevalence of opportunities that exist to make a difference illustrates the gifts that we share in our lucky country. There is a call upon each one of us to make the most of those blessings in order to give to those less fortunate, and to be thankful and responsible in the use of our gifts as we do our part in making our society a better place for all. Over the last year, this ideal was challenged by the impact that 2020 had on the mental health of most people, and the extent that COVID-19 continues to pose as a threat to our idealistic world. As a society, we have always had a clear goal when seeking happiness. However, this goal seems to be an obsession to many people who continue to repair the impact that 2020 may have had on their wellness, and in being obsessed with seeking happiness, may be restricting achieving it in the first place.\n\nSeeking happiness is something that we all do in our daily lives. Society as a whole sends a strong message about the importance of happiness, and each person aims to ensure to achieve their happiness by working hard so that the happiness is not, ever compromised. Religions, both ancient and modern, have provided us with ways to seek happiness, even in challenging situations. The offset of the experiences of 2020, although a distant memory for many now, may have links to the way that many people in our society continue to be challenged both mentally as well as physically in their return to what is now the norm. Not having the ability to simply get up and go out, spend adequate time outside, catching up with friends and family, playing sport, going on holidays, etc, had its toll on many people. We are, after all, social beings, and degrees of isolation have negatively impacted on the ability of some students to return to the necessary routines required for engaging in school.\n\nResearch carried out by health authorities during the major lockdowns of 2020 revealed that many young people lived with increased levels of anxiety, feeling overwhelmed by remote learning, confusion, sadness, boredom, and feelings of helplessness, just to name a few of the outcomes. The government enhanced the support available to address mental health by facilitating extra mental health sessions with accredited practitioners with the use of the Medicare system. This action reflects the notion that the impact of the lockdowns could have delayed progress and development amongst young people, and that repairing this should be prioritised. Professor Brock Bastian from Melbourne University suggests that “Happiness itself isn’t overrated. I think happiness is great and I like being happy as much as possible, but sometimes what we don’t realise is the psychology behind happiness”. In a recent podcast, he explains further that “we know from psychology that the human mind often works in fairly ironic ways, so when you’ve focused on something too much, or try not to experience something, it actually produces the opposite. A good example is pink elephants, where you ask people not to think about pink elephants... (but then) they tend to think about them more”.\n\nProfessor Bastian explains that many of us have a mistaken idea that we can continually build happiness and become ever happier. In trying to protect our young ones, we may be guilty of painting a picture of happiness that is unrealistic and unattainable. I recall being a young person seeking happiness, not as an end result, but as the goal and the process in the lead up to it. This is simply impossible to achieve. Winning a game of sport or achieving a good result in school takes effort and preparation. Not all training sessions or practices to improve a skill are necessarily happy moments, nor may be studying content that is challenging. Yet, we feel happy when rewarded and acknowledged for our efforts. The point that I try to emphasize here is that happiness is not always possible to be achieved the way that we try to bring it to the lives of our children. Facing the challenges of life is what brings happiness when the person is able to find ways to achieve and rejoice the experiences at hand.\n\nAs professor Bastian explains, \"no matter what we do in life, we do tend to come back to somewhat of a resting baseline around happiness and this can be slightly different for different people”. He continued in his podcast to say that “I think it’s fair to say that it’s very hard to really experience any happiness in life if we don’t also have its opposite. That means sometimes leaning into, I suppose fearlessly in some way, those experiences which can seem difficult, challenging, hard, even painful. It’s actually through that process that we achieve happiness”.\n\nUnfortunately for our society, there has been an increase in diagnosis as ways to treat depression, anxiety and related psychological states. More and more, children find themselves under the microscope and wrongful approaches to treating any diagnosed disorder could in fact be damaging in the long term. It is for these reasons that the best way to ensure that children find happiness in their lives, is for them to have access to you as parents unconditionally. Finding a sense of happiness is only possible after being challenged. Not winning a game of sport or getting a poor result at school should be a great learning experience, and motivation to do better at the next opportunity. It should not be a reason for unhappiness.\n\nIf your child seems to be challenged by the return to school and is behind in his/her progression, you have a great role to play in supporting them. Maintaining open communication with the teachers and pastoral leaders is essential. Establishing a strong partnership with the school is highly relevant as a way to maintain open communication. Where most students have been able to return to school and achieve within the parameters set out for them at Aquinas, some haven’t. Delays in progression may lead to students feeling overwhelmed and continually under pressure. It is for this reason that addressing their happiness, as a goal that is oriented on development and positive reinforcement is crucial. If your child needs assistance, please reach out. The College has excellent support systems in place to support you in this process. I urge you to make contact with your child’s pastoral leaders or the Youth and Family Centre (yfc@aquinas.vic.edu.au).\n\nTrue happiness is the result of overcoming the adversities attached to life, even in our wonderful rich and blessed society. The ability to embrace the challenges, discomforts and realities of life is key to our continued need to develop resilience. Struggling to complete a degree at university, an apprenticeship at the hands of a tough boss, being cut from a sporting team, feeling pain as we complete a marathon or losing out on a job will all lead to happiness, eventually. Feeling overwhelmed in the process may be upsetting but crucial to our resilience. If you have any questions regarding this article, please contact me at the College.\n\nYou may find Professor Bastian’s podcast and my source for some of the script here.\n\nDr Napoleon Rodezno\n\nDeputy Principal\n\nLast week I had the pleasure of attending the Annual VCSSDPA Women In Leadership dinner with members of our Aquinas College staff. Due to COVID, the evening was postponed but we were fortunate to listen to Nicole Livingstone, who was booked for 2019, as our keynote speaker.\n\nNicole began her swimming career at the age of 13 when she joined the Australian swimming team, going on to be one of Australia’s most successful swimmers. Nicole then transitioned into media commentary before really making her mark as a leader. Nicole is now the AFL’s Head of Women’s Football, a board member of Swimming Australia, the Australian Olympic Committee and is the Deputy Chair of VicHealth. Along with her sister, Karen Livingstone, Nicole founded Ovarian Cancer Australia, after their mother sadly passed away from the disease. She is now patron of the organisation.\n\nNicole spoke of heroes and role models in her life, especially her Primary school teacher who encouraged her that she could do anything she set her mind to. This was where her love of swimming and dream to represent Australian at the Olympics began. (An interesting note: Linley Frame was Nicole's classmate and fellow Olympic team member!) The fact that her teacher had such a huge impact in her life stuck with Nicole, and she was so grateful that her teacher saw the potential in her ability.\n\nI reflected back on the teachers who made an impact on my life; my Grade 4 teacher who decorated our classroom and immersed us in everything Moscow Olympics for the whole year (coincidently, Nicole recalls the same memory at her Primary school in the very next suburb!); my Year 7 Music teach (Sr Margaret Mary) who taught us Chiquitita on the recorder (we thought that was very cool!); a Year 11 teacher who supported me and my family through some tough times. I also remember the teachers who encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone, (particularly my Year 12 Drama teacher) to eventually follow my passion for the Performing and Visual Arts, and like them, become a teacher.\n\nNicole also spoke of the pioneering women who were the first female Olympic swimmers for Australia, and the first female AFL footballers who began playing in the 1920’s. These women also overcame adversity in male- dominated sports to earn the right to complete and represent their teams and country with outstanding results. Their stories, like Nicole's, were awe-inspiring and a testament to their will and determination to achieve - no matter what obstacles came their way. Nicole also shared her experience in leadership as well as balancing that with being a wife and mother of three children.\n\nAs educators, we are mindful of the influence we have on our students and encourage them and celebrate their talents regularly. At Aquinas, our teaching and non-teaching staff work together to empower our students to use their gifts and talents to build relationships with others, share experiences, strengthen their resilience in this ever changing world, and to prepare them to become the young men and women they can be for the future. I thank all of our staff who work actively everyday to bring out the best in our students - maybe they will be the “hero” that will inspire our students to achieve their dreams in the future.\n\nGina Goss\n\nAssistant Principal - Staff\n\nMs Gina Goss, Ms Natalie Zuccon, Ms Jacqui Street, Ms Mary-Jo Chard, Mrs Rachel Crawley, Ms Alicia Feeney, Ms Alyce Cudmore and Ms Madeleine Kalla at the 2021 VCSSDPA Women In Leadership Dinner\n\nAre you old enough?\n\nIf you’re immediate reaction to the title was the sing the next line of Dragons song (a band in the 80s) you are probably not a parent who had social media, smart phones and online gaming as key features of your childhood.\n\nThere are few things in our lives not dependent on some form of digital technologies. In fact it is difficult to think of anything not connected (pun intended). Rapid advancements in technology have enabled us to achieve amazing things. Healthcare, Research, Neural Engineering (neuroscience and the way neurological diseases and disorders will be treated in the future) to name but a few. Technology has positively enhanced lives because of monumental advancements. However when we consider human use of technology, it may be prudent to also consider potential less desirable aspects.\n\nThis term Wellbeing Matters and our Child Safety and Wellbeing program focuses predominately on digital dramas commonly faced by families, children and young people. There is no shortage of material offering varied perspectives on what young people need to know and do growing up in a digitally dominated landscape. Holistic learning experiences provide young people with opportunities to gain knowledge and insight, and become empowered, confident navigators of challenges in daily life. Staff spend considerable time developing and adapting curriculum materials to suit our Aquinas community. On occasion it can be difficult for families to navigate the plethora of content marketed to families on raising young people in the digital age. To make this a little easier we have included a couple of links to credible sources of information we think most useful.\n\nCheck out school TV interviews with Dr Michael Carr Gregg and Susan McLean:\n\nhttps://aquinas.vic.schooltv.me/newsletter-full-interview/952/692\n\nhttps://aquinas.vic.schooltv.me/newsletter-full-interview/953/692\n\nThere are a few common elements research literature suggests provide children and young people with opportunities, resources and a safe and nurturing environment where they can thrive. Safeguarding all students remains one of the most important priorities we share with our families and the wider community. Knowledge is an important ingredient yet only one piece of the puzzle. Working alongside children and young people in respectful partnerships to develop critical health and wellbeing literacy is another valuable piece. Whilst many safety messages remain the same the timing, context and source of information can change. We seek multiple ways to engage, educate and encourage the capacity building of our students knowing that appropriate repetition and variety of pedagogy and voice support learning.\n\nBrainstorm Productions (Years 7 and 8) and the Victoria Police in School Program (Years 7 to 10) are long-time partners utilised to explore key safety and wellbeing messages for our students. We are excited to reconnect with the Police in Schools Program reoffered to Victorian schools last month by the Victorian Government. Aquinas College has built a positive connect with local Youth Resource Officers in our eastern region and welcome their return. The Think You Know Program reinforces the importance of being safe and respectful in all aspects of our digital lives. Whilst we appreciate neuroplasticity changes cognitive function in an adolescent brain, we also acknowledge behaviours firmly aligned with a strong moral compass can support the development and acceptance of pro social behaviours. The age recommendations placed on various sites are a guide for parents and users. While young people mature at different rates and in different ways the guidelines offered are worthy of closer consideration. Robyn Treyvaud discusses the age of access for social media https://knowledge-centre.familyinsights.net/knowledge-base/why-is-13-years-old-the-legal-age-for-having-a-social-media-account/\n\nSocial media platforms can be spaces where health and wellbeing can be enhanced or damaged. It is the responsibility of each and every user to harness the potential for these platforms to be constructive and avoid destructive and harmful communication. We all have a role to play with each post we chose to share, comment we leave and content we decide show support for. Sometimes the comment we don’t make actually makes the most obvious statement.\n\nI encourage every family to visit the E Safety commission website https://www.esafety.gov.au/ and peruse the valuable content on an array of topics.\n\nCheryl Kane\n\nChild Safety and Wellbeing Coordinator\n\nThe scientific journey through secondary education\n\nScience has a long and fascinating history of human attempts to appreciate, understand, control and manage our world. The study of science is dynamic and progressive, providing us with a view of the world that changes as our knowledge and understanding evolves.\n\nOur Year 7 students arrive at Aquinas with eager anticipation of commencing their secondary scientific education. Whilst many have experienced the study of Science at a primary level, their access to the Science Laboratories and specialised science equipment is cause for great excitement.\n\nThe Year 7 students commence their secondary science journey with a semester-based unit titled ‘Being a Scientist’. As the name suggests, this unit of work essentially allows students to explore what it means to be a scientist and how and why we include such studies in our curriculum.\n\nAt its core, the study of science is about helping our students to better explore and understand the amazingly complex world in which they live. Key science skills are explicitly taught from Years 7 to 9 as part of our core science curriculum. These skills are then further developed in senior pathways under the context of the life sciences, physical sciences and social sciences, depending on a student's electives. At Year 12, these skills culminate in the students being responsible for the planning, conduct and reporting of an extended student design investigation.\n\nKey scientific skills that are embedded in our science curriculum include:\n\nThe ability to work safely and effectively in the science laboratory\n\nDesigning and conducting scientific investigations to collect precise and accurate results\n\nMeaningful presentation and accurate analysis of qualitative and quantitative data\n\nThe drawing of valid conclusions based on scientific data\n\nThe ability to work independently and collaboratively in a variety of laboratory contexts\n\nConsideration for and adherence to the ethical guidelines in scientific investigations\n\nAn appreciation for the link between scientific theory and its application to everyday life.\n\nFor students who study more than one VCE Science, these key skills are explicitly taught and assessed across all VCE Sciences. Our work towards developing confidence and competence in these skills begins in the Year 7 classroom and continues with each progressive year. Students are challenged to grow in their scientific understanding and skills through a variety of different contexts and activities, whilst seeing the relevance in what they have learnt previously.\n\nIn supporting your child’s scientific journey you can prompt them to discuss what they are learning in their science class and share with them in the excitement of practical work and activities and celebrate their understanding of new ideas and how these might be applied to their lives. In addition, the media provides a rich resource to explore scientific ideas and their applications, and reflect on students’ learning in a contemporary context.\n\nSo as our Year 7 students start their journey into the study of science at Aquinas it is helpful to look ahead to where and how this journey might unfold, fostering a deeper understanding of the world in which we live and potentially a career in a science-related pathway. The images included depict some of the learning taking place in our Year 7 program.\n\nLynda Schulz\n\nScience Learning Area Leader"
