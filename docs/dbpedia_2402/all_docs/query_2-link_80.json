        "text": "Ringwood\n\nTo career educator Dr. Nicholas Bernice, the destination and the journey are equally important, even if the two are not intrinsically linked. As reflected by his personal history, the Ringwood school district's new top administrator knows that plans are subject to change.\n\n\"If you told the Nick Bernice who arrived at Fordham University in 1995 that he would become a superintendent of schools,\" Bernice said, \"he would not have believed you. It was not in the trajectory that I saw for myself.\"\n\nIn fact, he was working for a small health-care company shortly after graduation when the owner suggested his talents might be better utilized elsewhere.\n\n\"I thought I was going to be a scientist,\" Bernice said, \"but he told me I should be a teacher.\"\n\nHe knew his former boss was right when he began working in the science department at Immaculate Heart Academy in Washington (Bergen County) and realized it was \"a great job.\" That stint was followed by a longer one at Northern Highlands Regional High School in Allendale. His first administrative position was as vice principal at West Brook Middle School in Paramus. Since 2011, he has been principal of Leonia Middle School.\n\nAll the while, Bernice pursued his own education, earning advanced degrees from Ramapo College, St. Peter's College and St. John's University. He'd already completed a master's degree in technology and a doctorate in administration and supervision when the principal in Paramus suggested he take a few classes in literacy. Never prone to doing anything halfway, Bernice subsequently earned a certificate as a reading specialist, which required more than 100 hours of hands-on training.\n\n\"I knew I needed to have a better understanding of early-childhood education,\" he said.\n\nWhile Bernice is conscious of the fact that many of Ringwood's students are younger than those he's worked with previously, he feels prepared for the challenges that await. He sees the cumulative effect of those early grades through the eyes of a science teacher.\n\n\"Children have to be good readers and know mathematics in order to succeed in science,\" he said. \"It was part of the draw for me to come to a K through 8 district.\"\n\nReadying young learners to solve the problems of the future is a cornerstone of the way Bernice views education. It's all part of the big picture.\n\n\"We have to ensure the children will have a skill set not only in science and technology, but also in critical thinking,\" he said. \"It's about giving them the knowledge they need to ask questions and arrive at conclusions.\"\n\nAlthough he understands the value of STEM learning, which brings together science, technology, engineering, and math, Bernice says there is another element to the interdisciplinary approach.\n\n\"STEM is an important study, but I don't want to ignore the arts, either,\" he said. \"Often art helps us understand other principles. Sometimes you need an artist to illustrate something or an author to explain it.\"\n\nWhen it comes to standardized testing, Bernice recognizes that PARCC may not be perfect, but a consistent measure of student performance is necessary.\n\n\"Otherwise, we don't know how we're doing,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, he added, it's not enough to hit a statistical benchmark in proficiency. Such tests should also show improvement in how children learn year over year.\n\n\"We need to look at how the students continue to grow as learners,\" he said.\n\nCiting a second-grade lesson on multiplication that he sat in on last year, Bernice acknowledges that instruction has changed considerably since he was in school. While the math isn't really new, he says that the manner in which children are learning it is different.\n\n\"The students weren't simply memorizing that 2 times 4 equals 8,\" he explained. \"They used different color blocks representing the numbers so that they could see the math and assemble it themselves.\"\n\nTo that end, Bernice respects that some parents are baffled by their children's homework, but says they need not understand the methodology in order to support the cause behind it. Instead of fretting over their inability to help, he thinks mom and dad should encourage kids to work it out on their own.\n\n\"Let your children sit and struggle with the hard problems,\" he said. \"At some point, their teacher gave them the skills they need to solve it. It's in the struggle that they arrive at their own learning.\"\n\nThe Board of Education selected Bernice from a pool of 24 candidates for the position; he was among a half dozen to make the initial cut. Because he's known since February that he would be coming to Ringwood, interim superintendent Dr. Jeffrey Feifer was able to spend several days showing him around the district and introducing him to most of the staff before the school year ended in June.\n\n\"He was very helpful during the transition - acquainting me not only with the people, but with the district organization as well,\" Bernice said.\n\nIt's no surprise that the new super is looking forward to meeting students and engaging with them on their return to school this Tuesday. He's hoping he'll have adequate time to sit in on every classroom at some point.\n\n\"The most rewarding part of being a school administrator is going to see the children learning and asking teachers what they need to do their work,\" he said.\n\nAs for being a rookie, Bernice takes it in stride.\n\n\"Everyone's new at something sometime,\" he said with a casual shrug. \"There are very knowledgeable people around me. If I run into something that I haven't before, I'm confident that there's someone here who can help me figure it out.\"\n\nCoast Guard service\n\nFittingly, Bernice is also an educational administrator with the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, with which he has more than 18 years of service. As a senior chief boatswain's mate, he is currently the reserve training chief out of Station Sandy Hook, where he trains others to drive rescue boats. In October, however, his billet is moving to Washington, D.C., where he will become the reserve force manager and coordinator for the boatswain mate rating.\n\n\"It's funny; both of my jobs are changing pretty dramatically at the same time,\" he said. \"After 20 years of driving boats, I'm ready to be an advisor.\"\n\nHe calls the Coast Guard a great opportunity for anyone because of the variety of jobs available.\n\n\"It's a nice marriage of service without necessarily having to prepare for a war operation,\" he said. This sets the Coast Guard apart from the other branches of the military, where they are \"are training for a war they hope they never have to fight.\"\n\nBernice was mobilized into active duty twice in the past 15 years, patrolling New York Harbor for almost a year after 9/11, and for another five days following Superstorm Sandy. Although he could be called up again, he feels that to be somewhat unlikely.\n\n\"It would have to be something big,\" Bernice said.\n\nHe's a strong believer in building - and rebuilding - on the accomplishments of those who have come before.\n\n\"We all benefit from standing on the shoulders of giants,\" he said. \"We're a resilient society, so we get back up on those shoulders.\"\n\nEmail: stewart@northjersey.com"
