        "text": "Millstadt Public School\n\nThe History of Millstadt High School\n\nMillstadt (population 2,794) is located in southwestern Illinois about 12 miles southeast of East St. Louis. This southwest St. Clair County town is situated at the intersection of Illinois Routes 158 and 163. The Douglas Creek flows by the northeast side of town while their are three ponds also sitting about Milstadt.\n\nA great history of the town of Millstadt can be read the Millstadt Consolidated School website at http://www.millstadt.stclair.k12.il.us/history/town.htm . The following is an exact copy of that article:\n\n\"The first settlers of this area were of English ancestry and came from the original thirteen colonies because they received land grants for their services in the military in the late 1700's .The first Germans came up the Mississippi from New Orleans as a group in 1834. Millstadt was laid out in 1836 on a section of Henry Randleman's land and was named Centreville due to its central location. It was incorporated in 1875. The story of how Millstadt developed out of \"Centreville\" goes something like this. The current Centerville and our Centreville each had a post offices through which a great deal of mail became confused and miss delivered. Our town's forefathers, upon applying for formal organization through the state, supposedly decided on the name \"Mittlestadt or Middlestadt\" which means literally \"center city\"; somehow the state misread the writing and sent back the papers reading \"Millstadt\". As you can guess, the governing group decided to keep that name as we had several mills at that time and the name fit.\"\n\nThe history of the school system was not as well documented. The only information we found is that the many small country schools that were in the area of Millstadt were closed in the early 1950s. Some consolidated to Millstadt while most consolidated to Belleville.\n\nWe believe that Millstadt supported a high school because there are photos of the school's marching band uniforms on the museum page of the school's website. There is not any mention of Millstadt High School that we could find. As you may be able to decipher, we are in need of help regarding the history of Millstadt High School.\n\nMillstadt High School Quick Facts\n\nYear opened: late 1800s?\n\nYear closed: 1950s?\n\nConsolidated to: Belleville School District\n\nMIllstadt HS team nickname: unavailable\n\nMillstadt HS team colors: unavailable (possibly maroon & white)\n\nSchool Fight Song: unavailable"
