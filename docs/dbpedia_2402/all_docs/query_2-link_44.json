        "text": "Welcome to Croydon Community School.\n\nOn behalf of our school community, I acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land our school sites stand on. The Wurundjeri people and the Kulin nations’ culture and customs have nurtured this land and we value their contributions to life and the education of generations of Australians past, present, and future.\n\nI am extremely honoured to continue to lead Croydon Community School. The school is a Big Picture Learning school, which means that we are part of a worldwide network that prioritises the needs, interests, and passions of each individual learner. The requirements of the Victorian Curriculum and Senior Certificates are of critical importance in our pursuit of educational excellence for every young person within our community. However, we value to International Big Picture Learner Credentials (IBPLC), student portfolios, exhibitions, and narratives as the most accurate and descriptive assessments of our students’ true abilities.\n\nIn term 2, 2022, we moved to our beautifully designed, purpose-built facilities on Croydon Rd, Croydon (main entrance off Samuel St). The sadness of leaving our old, well-loved site has been replaced with the endless potential our new facilities provide. We have adapted our timetable to better reflect our Big Picture Learning model, with students making smooth transitions between specialist areas to extend their individual learning plans and passion projects.\n\nOn behalf of the North East Region of DET we manage other educational programs to assist children and young people in our area successfully complete secondary education and transition to rich post-secondary opportunities. These programs are:\n\nAn onsite re-engagement program that provides a stepped program for 12–17-year-old students who have not attended any school for a long time.\n\nWoori Yallock Farm School, which primarily provides Certificate courses in Conservation and Land Management, and Horticulture. It is accessed by many schools in the outer east.\n\nOur approach across the school ensures we realise the Victorian Government’s Education State targets of:\n\nLearning for life. More students achieving excellence in reading, maths, science, and the arts.\n\nHappy, healthy, and resilient kids. Building the resilience of our children and encouraging them to be more physically active.\n\nBreaking the link. Ensuring more students stay in school and breaking the link between disadvantage and outcomes for students.\n\nPride and confidence in our schools. Making sure every community has access to excellence, in every government school and classroom.\n\nAll our staff are responsive to the individual learning and wellbeing needs of every student. We are all committed to the principle, “One Student at a Time in a Community of Learners” and we truly enjoy watching our young people develop confidence, knowledge, skills, and a positive future focus on their learning journey through secondary school.\n\nI look forward to meeting you at one of our school events."
