        "text": "Ringwood Secondary College is a co-educational public secondary school located in the eastern suburb of Ringwood in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\n\nRingwood Secondary College opened as Ringwood High School in 1954[1][2] and was one of the first high schools to be constructed in the new Light Timber Construction (LTC) style, which was developed by the Public Works Department in Victoria to address a chronic shortage in high school places in the 1950s.\n\nRingwood Secondary College provides education for years 7-12. Year 11 and 12 students undertake the VCE program. There are currently approximately 1460 students enrolled at the school.\n\nRSC offers an extensive range of Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) subjects as well as the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) programme. The college has developed a centre of excellence for Automotive, Engineering and Manufacturing."
