If you buy tickets to three shows you get the fourth show for free, just type in Season in the promotional code box.\n\nThe Texas Shakespeare Fest: \"Where Do They Get Those Costumes?\" Great article with video of the costume shop.\n\nCostume Department\n\nDesigner, Brandon R. McWilliams holds a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Theatre Studies from The University of Texas at Austin and a Master of Fine Arts in Costume Design from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama. He has designed regionally for the past fifteen years and is the recipient of the Zelma H. Weisfeld USITT Costume Design Award and two-time recipient of the Elizabeth Shrader Kimberly Award in Costume Design. His work has been on display at the Prague Quadrennial ’07, as well as at the Carnegie Mellon University campus in Qatar. He has taught at Carnegie Mellon University, Salisbury University, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Louisiana State University and currently heads the costume design program at Texas State University. www.brmcwilliams.com.\n\nUPDATE: I sent Brandon a list of questions and he was nice enough to answer them. Here's the transcript of our conversation below:\n\nMe: I've been going to TSF for the last three years now, so I have a basic understanding of the rehearsal schedule, build schedule and how much time each show is allotted in the shop. The schedule is insane so kudos to everyone involved for getting so much done in so little time.\n\nBrandon: “Thank you, yea it’s a pretty tight schedule”\n\nMe: There is one thing I am confused about. I was told three years ago by Nick Jones, who was the shop manager at the time, that the designs were submitted in February with final renderings to the shop in March. What I am confused about is, who is there to begin patterning in March and shopping for fabrics if all the staff seem to be employed at other colleges or in grad school?​ Who is doing all the preliminary work until everyone else finishes with their own finals? If the shop only has 5 days per show to get the whole thing built with fittings starting on Wednesday, who is doing the pulling and shopping? I'd also love to know how much time you spent in residence during the build compared to how much was accomplished through email or phone calls.\n\nBrandon: “I haven’t really noticed any pre-production work done by the shop before the company arrives, but yea, you are right that final designs along with supporting paperwork gets delivered in March. I do all pulling and shopping for the shows with the exception of foundation garments that the shop staff can typically pull. I was in residence for 6 weeks, May 18th through July 3.”\n\nMe: Clearly a lot of things were built for both of your shows. Can you point out which pieces were built for the show compared to how much was adapted from pre-existing stock?\n\nBrandon: “For Much Ado, it was pretty much fabricated in house and purchased, we did pull the townspeople from their stock, but the rest was built. Cyrano was probably a solid 50/50 at the end of the day.”\n\nMe: What I'm especially curious about, having read the costume book they published awhile back and being able to talk to Nick Jones (I got to see the shop and storage three years ago while everyone was on a break for lunch) is this: The original philosophy was to build sturdy period pieces in a neutral color palette that could be used in a lot of different shows and then to keep adding to that collection to amass a really good stock and they've clearly done that over the last 30 years.\n\nBrandon: “I’m always surprised at how usable their stock is, I’m not entirely sure that it came from a directive to design in neutrals per say, but it's happened many a times that I’ll need something and you just walk back into the stock and there it is.”\n\nMe: But after three years of seeing period pieces in neutral colors I'm wondering when/if more color in the designs is going to happen? Surely they have enough brown and creme things by now. So what were you told, if anything, about color? I have started assuming that anything I see that's an actual color was built for the show and anything that's beige, creme, tan, brown, or navy is pre-existing stock.\n\nBrandon: “I’ve never been told that I have to operate in a certain palette when I’ve worked at TSF. Color has always evolved in collaboration with the Director and other Designers.”\n\nMe: I see that you did Camelot back in 2013. What was it like coming back? What did you do differently because of your experience earlier?\n\nBrandon: “I did, I also did Winter’s Tale that year, it was great coming back, for my 3rd year now. TSF is kind of special and I have always enjoyed my time with them. Coming back in my 2nd and 3rd year was somewhat easier having known how they operate and what actually exists in their stock, its like you are just better prepared having danced the danced before.”\n\nMe: I'd love to know what your budget was for both shows.\n\nBrandon: “They seem to budget with a lump sum amount rather than in response to the sketch.”\n\nMe: Much Ado they've done three times before, Cyrano twice. Was there any conversation like, \"Well, we've done it this way before, you need to be different\" or the opposite \"we have all this stuff from last time in stock, you should use some of it\".\n\nBrandon: “There is always a bit of comfort in knowing that they have some 30 years of stock to be utilized in various ways, but there really wasn’t any directive given to be like, or different from past productions.”\n\nMe: I feel like Raymond Caldwell and John Dodd have had such a long range vision for so long, I am interested to know how much control they exert over the designs.\n\nBrandon: “A producer always has that stewardship over the visual language in a way, but I’ve never had Mr. Caldwell or Mr. Dodd exert themselves in a way that was in opposition to the direction of the design of the shows I’ve done at TSF.”\n\nI emailed Ms. Herin (Richard III and The Marvelous Wonderettes) and was fortunate in that she agreed to answer some questions about her involvement in the festival. I found out that she also designed two of the shows we saw last year, Henry V and Carousel. Here's the link to last year's blog on the Festival so you can see more of her work. Texas Shakespeare Festival 2016 Christopher Roton, the scenic designer, also designed all the shows last year. When you click on the link you'll notice that it's not up to my usual descriptive standards and I apologize for that. My mom died last July after a long illness and it's a miracle I got anything published at all. That's why I was surprised to find out that both Angelina and Christopher had designed the shows last year--my brain just wasn't taking in any information at the time. Back to the interview with Ms. Herrin:\n\n\"The design process for the shows follows what I'd consider an industry standard for professional summer theaters. The designs begin in late fall, around mid-November, when conversations with the directors begin. At this point, I've been officially engaged as a designer, received copies of the scripts, read the scripts, and done some basic analysis on the texts and characters. I have a general sense of the plays, the playwrights intentions, and can discuss the characters with a certain level of depth and understanding. I like to have all this completed before my initial conversation with the director. Conversations with the director help to give my research focus, sometimes there's a concept that needs to be reconciled with the script, and the designers need to discuss and collaborate on the overall production. The production needs to be unified so we (the director and designers) need to communicate regularly, especially at the initial stages. Between these initial conversations and the mid-February initial design deadline, I do A LOT of research and sketches. Thanks to the Internet, it's pretty easy to share my ideas and receive feedback in an expedient manner. Sketches are often modified, especially as the overall costume design takes shape and a clearer vision is realized.\n\nFinal designs, which means color renderings of each character and any costume changes they undergo, are due in mid-March. Renderings include hair or wigs and makeup details, which can include tattoos, piercings, or scars in addition to basic makeup choices. This deadline may seem rather early but these designs need to be reviewed by the director of the show, the Artistic Director, and the Costume Shop Manager. While the directors of my individual shows and I may only be interested in the unification of our particular production, the Artistic Director needs to evaluate whether the season is balanced in terms of harmony and contrast; the Costume Shop Manager needs to consider the technical and logistical requirements of the season. Furthermore, costume renderings are often used in publicity materials that are created in advance of the company arriving in Kilgore. Construction of the costumes does not begin until late May when the entire company is in residence.\n\nA final design packet is due in early May. This packet includes all the accompanying paperwork in addition to the costume renderings. Paperwork can include dressing lists, build lists, character/scene breakdowns, quick change plots, technical drawings depicting how garments should be patterned, fabric swatch cards, and comprehensive garment lists. The build period is brief and designers need to be completely prepared when they arrive.\"\n\nScenic Department\n\nI don't know any of the scene shop people, but clearly they have a sense of humor. And their TD/Shop Foreman is FEMALE! Look at all those men so happy to work for a woman! I hope the matching Hawaiian shirts are their actual shop uniforms. Even if there is only one of these shirts running around, the fact that they all wore it for the publicity photos makes me smile. There's a group of people who know how to have fun.\n\nCyrano\n\nWe saw Cyrano Friday matinee. The set design was lovely and very versatile, having to be 5 different locations: the Hotel Burgundy, Rageneau's patisserie, Roxanne's abode, the battle, and the convent.\n\nSet Model.\n\nAct I: A Performance at the Hotel Burgundy.\n\nThe web banner.

It's a huge costume build with many layers of foundation garments for the ladies in order to achieve the correct Cavalier silhouette. The men all need lace collars and cuffs, capes, hats with feathers, swords and belts, and boots. There's the entire Gascon regiment that needs uniforms, several Musketeers, and three nuns. Plus all the other characters. That's a lot of changes.\n\nHere's what Brandon McWilliams had to say about Cyrano: “Ben Reigel (the director) came to the table with such experience with the play that we quickly decided it was a period piece that would be lived in in such a way that it wasn’t about costumes, but more about clothes that are lived in in a way. There were many discoveries along the way as the process seemed to be a bit more organic on this show and a lot was created based around an existing stock of clothing as opposed to building a great deal of items.”\n\nHere's Cyrano. He keeps this look through most of the show. His nose is clearly a prosthetic. It's a bit large, but not outrageously so.\n\nHere's Cyrano's duel with Valvert. You can see the background characters in their lace collars and cuffs.\n\nHere's Christian and the rest of the Gascons at Rageneau's patisserie. They clearly identify as a unit even though their \"uniforms\" are not identical. Two or perhaps three different fabrics were used to create doublets with separating sleeves that laced in. Both Christian and Cyrano have unique costumes that are similar to the Gascon uniform but not identical.\n\nHere's the gown Roxanne wears in both Act II and III. It's a yellow bodice with overskirt worn over a blue underskirt. it has white sleeves and trim.\n\nHere's her dress from Act I, seen here in Act IV at the battle with the Gascons.\n\nHere's the black dress she wears in the convent, still in mourning for Christian.\n\nRichard III\n\nIn case you are not up on your English Civil War history, here's a wonderful video that the Festival linked to on You Tube that explains one hundred years of bloody treason, betrayal, murder, and mayhem for you in less than 12 minutes.\n\nRichard III was directed by Stephen Wyman who played Shylock last year in Merchant of Venice as well as directed Henry V. Mr. Wyman said that directing Henry V last year made it easier for him to approach directing Richard III this year as he was already familiar with the space and with what kind of audience he could expect. Richard III is the second longest of all of Shakespeare's plays and Mr. Wyman didn't feel that the audience would thank him for presenting a four hour or longer version of the complete text. Discussing his version of the show he said, \"You have to know where you're going\" which meant that he had to cut out everything in the script that didn't take him there. To that end, he began cutting the script early on and eventually went through six revisions before he was happy with the final version.\n\nMr. Wyman didn't just cut lines out, he also added in portions of an adapted version by Colley Cibber that was popular a hundred years after Shakespeare's version premiered. He said that he incorporated those bits of text into his production because he felt that Lady Anne's character arc needed to be completed and Colley Cibber's version did just that. The added scenes showed Lady Anne lamenting her marriage to Richard, their fierce argument about it, and later her suicide. One of the major elements he wanted to highlight with his version was the \"portrait of the kind of people that would allow a person like Richard to come to power\", which meant that it was vitally important for the play to not just be about watching a great actor chew the scenery but about all of the other characters and their backstory; that they need to exist in a world in which superstition and curses are real.\n\nHis design concept was \"expressionistic, grotesque, and eccentric\" to expose the inner torment of each character to the audience and to wear it on the outside of their bodies like clothing. He stressed that he couldn't make subtle choices because as we are an American audience we don't have strong associations with all these characters the way an English audience would, being much more intimately familiar with the history of the War of the Roses. The director worried that (unlike Henry V last year) the audience would be unwilling to go on this journey with him since it was a descent into a hellish nightmare rather than a glorious journey toward victory. He needn't have worried. The direction, acting, and design of the show were compelling enough to keep our attention riveted on his goal for the entire two and a half hours.\n\nSet Model\n\n​The set was designed by Christopher Roton. The concept he was given was Wyman wanted the world of the play to be a \"living, breathing nightmare\". You probably can't tell from the photos, but the wooden supports have runes carved into them and the platforms seem to be mortared together with human skulls. There were rusty hooks on chains hanging from the ceiling along with metal chandeliers. The whole atmosphere was one of catacombs turned torture chamber. I felt like I was in The Cask of Amontillado--as each successive victim was murdered, I felt walled up in this tomb of a set. Here's a good one of the skulls in the mortar.\n\n​The lights and projections were designed by Jeff Greenberg. As you can see from the \"curtain warmer\" photos, projections were used throughout the show to enhance the \"living, breathing, nightmare\" concept that Mr. Wyman wanted. The Kilgore College theatre department had just purchased a new projection system so Adobe After Effects was used to project the faces of Richard's ghosts onto the back drop during Richard's nightmare before the battle of Bosworth Field. Pre-show projections were the title of the show superimposed on three femur bones, while the intermission projection was Richard's skeleton from the car-park superimposed over the skeleton of a boar, Richard's sigil.\n\nPre-show projections\n\nIntermission projections\n\nThe com system went down right after the curtain speech on the night we saw it. After what seemed like way too long but was probably only a few minutes, the announcement went out that the show had been delayed due to technical difficulties and it would be just a few more minutes. We found out in the panel the next morning that they never did get the system up and running and had to call all the cues on their cell phones! I have no idea how that even worked, but it did, and I couldn't even tell anything was wrong. The problem turned out to be a short in a wire that they replaced the next day. Michael Redondo must be the best stage manager in the history of ever because we also found out the next day that this version of Richard had the most cues he's ever had to call in a show. I can't imagine doing that on cell phones. Way to go, Michael!\n\nCostume Gallery\n\nRenderings by Angelina Herrin\n\n​Photography by TSF staff.\n\n​I designed Richard III back in 1999, so I know from experience that it's a huge show! ​ When we did it at MCC, we incorporated the end of Henry VI part 3-- the Battle of Tewkesbury--in which Margaret is captured, and Prince Edward and Henry VI are killed, to give our audience some context for what they were about to see. In Wyman's version we get the scene where Richard stabs Henry VI in the Tower (from Henry VI part 3) before we get the scene where he woos Anne over Henry's corpse. In this version Henry's corpse bled spontaneously just like in the text: \"O gentlemen, see, see dead Henry's wounds Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!\" It was a great bit of theatrical magic that took the audience by surprise. In the panel discussion, we were told how they did it. The corpse was rigged with blood bags and tubing with holes. The actors who were bearing the corpse had the trigger for the release mechanism in the handles of the bier.\n\nThe costumes were designed by Angelina Herrin. Here's what she had to say about Mr. Wyman's concept:\n\n\"The concept for Richard III was \"1480 meets 'Mad Max' and 'Halloween.'\" Mr. Wyman wanted the costumes to reflect the inner corruption of the characters. There is something rotten and not quite right in this world and costumes are the outer manifestation on this festering. The costumes needed to walk the line between contemporary and Late Gothic silhouettes. This was achieved through mixing contemporary materials with older silhouettes and or manipulating a contemporary garment. Since the play is about the War of the Roses, there are a lot of roses and insignia to assist the audience in identifying who is aligned together and who is in power. (We go through four kings during the play.) Lesser characters, like the soldiers and messenger, switch out the insignia on their costumes to indicate this change of power. I incorporated a lot of spikes into the clothing - my version of rose thorns. Everyone has some sort of thorn or armour.\n\nA secondary goal was to play with proportion and to support the sense of unease created in the scenic design. One example is the women's veils are a bit too long and may concern some viewers - will they catch on the stage or get pulled off? why are they such odd colors? Again, the spikes create a sense of danger: when Richard is assaulting Queen Elizabeth the audience may actually feel concern for Richard as Elizabeth swings her bejeweled pauldrons, complete with 5\" spikes, toward his face and neck.\n\nIn terms of what was built vs. what was pulled from stock, it's a 45-55 ratio. All of the primary women, Richard's costumes, and several of the jerkins and capes were built. Headdresses for the women was also built. I painted all the insignia found on Richard, the messenger, and the soldiers. Heavy modifications were done to the motorcycle jackets and vests. The armour was modified or constructed then painted and distressed for this show, including the spiked knee pads. The items pulled from stock or purchased were generally pants, undershirts, capes, puffy vests, and accessories (gloves, shoes, studded belts). We also employed the skills of some wonderful artisans to build the Duchess of York's scaled pauldrons, Lady Anne's crown, Richard's crown, Queen Margaret's headdress, and some of the leather jerkins and leather armour worn by Catesby. I designed Henry V last year and chose to incorporate several pieces from that show into Richard III, although the concepts were different, I found the pieces I chose from Henry V added some depth and personal meaning to the design.\"\n\nAs Ms. Herrin said, most of the characters had some pieces of armor on their costumes and there was a lot of black leather in the show. Here is what Richard wore in most of the play. I liked the choice of putting Richard's weak arm in armor to protect it and it seemed that the paldron was helping to keep his \"withered\" forearm from dangling with the straps and chains holding it up. I felt sorry for his left boot. I imagine that the pair will be trashed after the show closes.\n\nMicah Goodding as Richard\n\nThe chorus had skull balaclavas that covered just the lower halves of their faces. The actor playing Brakenbury the Jailer, Domonique Champion, said that he felt they symbolized the \"power of death\" that was always following you as well as always ahead of you, impossible to escape. ​In the background you can see the ever-present chorus members in their skull balaclavas.\n\nAs the director said, the women were the important part of this show and Richard's relationships to them had to be developed. We see Richard's evil deeds better by the cruelty he inflicts on the women in his life.\n\nElizabeth is the wife of Richard's older brother Edward IV, who's just won the crown by defeating Henry VI at the Battle of Tewksbury. Here's how Queen Elizabeth starts the show. Notice the crystal pauldrons with the 5\" spikes. They are difficult to see in the photo, but from the second row, they looked deadly. Also, notice the use of white crown and lining accents on the dark gown. The white rose is the symbol of the York House.\n\nLea Di Marchi as Queen Elizabeth,\n\nHere's her change into a black mourning gown after Edward dies from grief over having to order his brother George's execution. George was rumored to be rebelling against Edward. Richard started the rumor of course. In a fit of sentimentality, Edward declared a stay of execution and told Richard to deliver the message. Richard lied and said he was too late. Later Richard has both her brother, Rivers, and her son from her previous marriage, Grey, arrested and executed for plotting against him. They actually were plotting against him. Elizabeth takes her daughters to seek sanctuary with Lord Hastings, but Richard also has him executed for being a traitor. Then Richard declares her two surviving sons from her marriage to Edward, illegitimate, has them locked up in the tower, never to be seen again. Notice she keeps the crystal pauldrons on, but loses the crown. Also, she loses all the white accents.\n\nRichard's mother is the Duchess of York, Cecilly Neville. Shakespeare portrays her as having deep affection for her sons Edward and George, but none for Richard. She sees his physical deformity as a \"false glass that grieves me when I see my shame in him\" and blames herself for it. Naturally she is horrified when Richard manipulates Edward into having George executed. Once her grandsons, the Princes, disappear in the Tower, she blames Richard for their deaths and curses him: \"Bloody thou art, Bloody will be thy end!\" She wears this deep burgundy velvet gown with scale mail pauldrons and a white underskirt.\n\nKimberly Braun as Duchess of York\n\nMargaret of Anjou was the wife to Henry VI and the mother of Prince Edward. No mere decorative Queen she, Margaret actually led the Lancastrian army with her husband at the Battle of Tewksbury, in which her son was killed by Richard before her very eyes. Richard captures Henry VI and later kills him in a fit of rage in the Tower. After the Battle of Tewksbury, Richard has her taken prisoner and keeps her at court so he can keep an eye on her. Margaret has lost her husband, her son, her sanity, her crown, and her freedom all in one day, and all because of Richard. Shakespeare also has her practicing witchcraft, a plot device that Mr. Wyman made much use of. She curses Richard and all the other Yorkist nobles who had a hand in the downfall of the House of Lancaster, and Cassandra-like, all of her curses come to pass, each man betrayed and murdered by Richard. Richard also dies at the hand of the future King of England, Henry Tudor, at the Battle of Bosworth.\n\nIn her first entrance, she is wearing what I would describe as an Evil Queen ensemble, a black horned headdress and veil with a red cape with silver/crystal pauldron only on one shoulder. In the second photo, she loses the cape and we see that she's wearing a red corset over a black gown. It's a very striking costume. I wish someone had gotten a better photo of it under normal lighting The third photo is her influencing Richard's dreams the night before the battle, giving him the nightmare of seeing all the victims of his murderous bid for power. She was in shadow so I'm not sure what she was wearing but it looks like she's just thrown a darker colored cape over her other costume.\n\nLisa Crosby Wipperling as Margaret\n\nAnne Woodville was the wife of Prince Edward and Margaret's daughter in law. Anne has lost both her husband and father-in law because of Richard. She first meets Richard while accompanying Henry VI's corpse to chapel. It is in this scene that Richard, a master of manipulation, tells her that he's killed her father in law and husband out of a desperation to marry her, because he's so in love with her. He offers his sword to her so that she can take her revenge and kill him, but she can't do it, being a Christian and not capable of murder. He then skillfully talks her into marrying him. It's not like she really had any other options. So she says yes and joins House York.\n\n​Anne is wearing a heavy grey velvet cape with black accents. Her veil is red. You can't really tell in this photo, but the rose appliqués on her cape have red beadwork on the black backgrounds. The House of Lancaster's symbol was the red rose.\n\nHere's what's under the heavy velvet cape. The third photo is the gown she wears in the emotional scene by Colley Cibber where she confronts Richard about their failure of a marriage, and then later commits suicide.\n\nThe men wore costumes too, I didn't want you to think I was ignoring them.\n\nLea DiMarchi as Elizabeth, Rick Higginbotham as Archbishop and Jason Shores as King Edward IV\n\nDJ Canaday as George, Micah Goodding as Richard, and Domonique Champion as Brakenbury\n\nJake Lesh as Ratcliff, Michah Goodding as Richard, Brock Vickers as Lord Mayor\n\nCody Davis as Buckingham\n\nBrock Vickers as First Murderer\n\nRichard's coronation robe\n\nRichard III Panel Discussion\n\nRichard III panel (from left to right): Michah Gooding as Richard, Director Stephen Wyman, Domonique Champion as Brakenbury, and Lisa Crosby Wipperling as Margaret.\n\nThe panel was held Saturday morning after the Friday evening show. Many interesting questions were brought up and we were so fortunate to have the director on hand to answer them. I was particularly curious about the concept for the show especially as it related to the unusual costume and scenic design.\n\nThis play was rehearsed six days in total. All the actors began rehearsals with their lines memorized. ​​​Micah Goodding, who played Richard, had been cast before last year's season closed and was able to start working on his character in September. Micah's take on playing Richard was that he (Richard) does genuinely care about (some) people right up until he's through with them. The scene with Lady Anne is especially troubling for a lot of people who work on this play. Why does she end up married to the man who murdered both her husband and father-in-law? It seems beyond belief that she could be manipulated like that. Micah wanted to show a version of Richard in which Anne's seemingly improbable choice would make sense. He felt he had to make Richard vulnerable enough in that moment so that Anne would accept him. This choice was further supported by the director's concept that their world had become such a nightmare, that being married to Richard was the safest option for her, the widow of his enemies, than remaining unmarried and vulnerable.\n\nIt was wonderful to hear Mr. Wyman talk about the importance of the female characters in the play. I'm so glad we got to hear from Lisa Crosby Wipperling, who played Margaret, on her perspective of her importance in the play, her curse on Richard, and her conjuring the dead to influence the outcome of the battle. She said that her character realized that the other women weren't ready to go to her side yet because they were still grieving for the Princes, so that's why she needed to conjure the ghosts in order to bring Richard down.\n\n​We weren't given any child actors to play the Princes in this version. I was told it's notoriously difficult to find child actors who can adhere to the crazy rehearsal schedule that the festival must keep. I felt their absence most keenly in the scene where Cecilly, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Anne were asking to see them in the Tower only to be denied by Brakenbury the Jailer. The women were grieving for faces that I had never seen. It was an emotional cue that was missed.\n\n​Matthew Simpson, festival director, was hosting the panel and also revealed that each season is built around one show and that Richard was the anchor play. He also said that usually the musical is the last piece of the puzzle, but this year when they chose Marvelous Wonderettes (which only has a cast of 4), they replaced the other non-Shakespeare with Cyrano which had a much larger cast.\n\nThe Marvelous Wonderettes\n\nI had never even heard of this musical when we saw it on Saturday at the matinee. According to the lighting designer, Jeff Greenberg, this show had the most lighting cues.\n\nSet Model\n\nAct I pre-show\n\nAct II intermission\n\nCostume Gallery\n\nRenderings by Angelina Herrin: Betty Jean, Cindy Lou, Missy, and Suzy.\n\nPhotography by TSF staff.\n\nCostumes designed by Angelina Herrin again. Here's what she had to say about this show.\n\n​\"The Marvelous Wonderettes is small, sweet musical. I think it's one of those shows that you have to experience rather than read or listen to at home. The audience is the fifth performer in this show. The key, in terms of the costume design, is to not reduce the characters to stereotypes. The costume designer needs to do character analysis and approach the design with a subtle hand or the costumes will cease to look like actual clothing and will indeed become costumes. For this production, the director and I decided to approach the first set of costumes - 1958 prom - with a muted/pastel palette and some sense of modesty. The dresses needed to look period appropriate, reflect the adolescent tastes of the characters, and look like they could have been sewn by one of the characters (as the dialogue dictates). Since the characters are trying to portray themselves as a signing group, I sought to create some unity in the costumes by giving the characters matching footwear and corsages. They all wear white gloves as well.\"\n\n​\"Moving into Act Two - 1968, a 10-year reunion - the characters are a bit more mature and have more clearly defined personalities and tastes. White is still used as a unifying factor - this time it's the go-go boots - but the costumes are less unified, a reflection of the women growing apart. The color palette for this act is more saturated has more diverse textures. Most of the hair and makeup is reflective of internal character growth; Suzy is the only character with similar hair and makeup in both acts, reflective of her minor character growth.\"\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\n\nI've done Much Ado at MCC in 2003. I'm a big fan of the Branaugh film. We saw it Saturday evening.\n\nSet Model\n\nThe scenic design was amazing. it really felt like an Italian villa--colorful and lush. I was shocked to find out that there was really water in the fountain. Couldn't believe Beatrice got wet when she fell in! And I was curious about how the balconies were built to support the weight of the actors crawling up them and then standing out there when the one on stage right only seemed to be supported on three sides and the one on stage left barely seemed supported at all. Likewise the curved staircase that didn't seem supported at all, but just magically hung in mid-air. What a clever display of safe building techniques.\n\nCostume Gallery\n\nWhen I designed Much Ado for MCC back in 2003, the Branagh film was 10 years old. We weren't supposed to doing it as our season finale that year; the last show was supposed to have been Tony and Tina's Wedding. But there was a big kerfuffle about the rights, which got pulled, and at the same time, that was the year that another big kerfuffle happened to the state budget and MCC (and I assume all the other Texas colleges) had to give back $1 million to the state. So we were left at the end of the season with no show and no money to do it with. It was decided rather than do no show, we'd do a show that didn't require us to pay for rights and one that we could do with stock costumes and scenery. Several Shakespeares and Greek tragedies were suggested and Much Ado was the winning title. It's a charming play that I never get tired of.\n\nRenderings by Brandon McWilliams\n\n​Photography by TSF staff.\n\nHere's what Brandon McWilliams had to say about Much Ado: “George Judy (the director) and I had worked together quite a bit over the years so coming into Much Ado was almost like having lunch with an old friend in a way. He is incredibly articulate and super organized in how he stewards his vision. I also think there was an established sense of trust having worked together before. We wanted to create a romantic silhouette, with elements from a variety of period really, so no one is going home with marks for authenticity here really, we pulled from Renaissance all the way to Regency in a way. But at the core was this desire to really depict these three various groups of people in this seaside Italian village.\"\n\nTaylor Alexis Bass as Ursula and Kimberly Braun as Hero\n\nLeonato, Benedict, Friar Francis, Hero, Beatrice, Antonio, and Ursula.\n\nJason Richards as Dogberry\n\nThe capture and interrogation of Borachio and Conrad by the Men of the Watch.\n\nThe Company\n\nIn case you missed the earlier posts on this topic, here's the links to them. They will open in a new page.\n\nPART ONE: COMIC BOOKS\n\nPART TWO: THE ORIGIN OF THE SUPER SUIT\n\nPART THREE: DC UNIVERSE\n\n​Before we can even start talking about individual characters, I have to deal with the fact that Marvel studios sold the screen rights to their characters off to other studios way back in the 1990's and for the last 10 years or so have been desperately trying to get them back. The Geek Twins made this handy-dandy visual guide so that you can refer to it if/when you get confused as we go on this supersuit journey together. Stupid Marvel!\n\nFantastic Four Franchise\n\nThe Fantastic Four are Silver Age superheros first appearing in 1961. Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm were exposed to cosmic radiation while on a scientific mission of space exploration. Reed became super-stretchy and called himself Mr. Fantastic. Sue became invisible and able throw a defensive shield around an item or person. and called herself Invisible Woman. Johnny can become fire and has the power of flight, calling himself The Human Torch. Ben becomes an orange rock monster and calls himself The Thing. Of the four, he's the only one who is permanently his super persona, being unable to change back into his human form. Eventually Reed and Sue get married and have two children Franklin and Valeria.\n\nTheir costumes traditionally are a medium blue jumpsuit with black collars, belts, boots, and gloves, with the number 4 on the chest. Mr. Fantastic's suit stretches with him, Johnny's always survives the fire, Sue's turns invisible with her, and Ben only wears the pants because the shirt was too constricting. The collars become wider, skinnier, and then wider again, and sometimes they are white rather than black. And, if you weren't already a fan, this is the team that The Incredibles are based on.\n\nTimeline of Comic Costumes\n\nLive Action Appearances\n\nThe Fantastic Four, 1994 Reve Richards\n\nFantastic Four, 2005 Jose Fernandez\n\nFantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer 2007 Mary E. Vogt\n\nFantastic Four, 2015 George L. Little\n\nGallery of Costume Design\n\n​Marvel sold the film rights to Twentieth Century Fox. Unlike the 1990 Captain America film that finally got released straight to video after two years, the 1994 Fantastic Four was never going to be released when they filmed it. Fox only made the movie to keep the rights. I bet Reve Richards was super pissed when he found out. All that hard work and no one will ever see it. And it's too bad because at least from this one photo, they look pretty good. These costumes are based on the 1983 \"Negative Zone\" run. Unfortunately, Ben Grimm's The Thing prosthetics make him look more like a prehistoric lizard monster rather than the big orange rock monster we all know and love.\n\nFrom left to right: Carl Ciarfalio, Rebecca Staab, Alex Hyde-White, and Jay Underwood,\n\n​On to the next iteration. First, a word about casting choices. Don't cast a Latina actress and then white-wash her to make her look like Chris Evans' sister. That was a bad decision. This is the only time where you should cast an actual white girl. I'm looking at you Doctor Strange casting director. The best thing about these movies is The Thing. Michael Chiklis is a great Ben Grimm. Other than that, these are weak movies. I watched them both when they came out and there was just nothing that made me want to go see them again.\n\nLet's talk about the supersuits in the first two movies. Long black gloves, and tall black boots, off-center number 4 on the upper left chest: That part they got right. The suits are too dark (just like everything else these days) and the black belts around the waist seem to have been replaced with a black V design line on the chest that points to the crotches on the men and undercuts Jessica Alba's boobs. it's just weird and doesn't evoke Fantastic Four to me. And I never thought I'd have to write this, but thank you Jose Fernandez and Mary E. Vogt for putting pants on The Thing.\n\nFrom left to right: Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffdd, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis.\n\nFrom left to right: Michael Chiklis. Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffdd\n\n​The middle two films are weak, but the re-boot version, directed by Josh Trank, is just bad. Not that it's HIS fault. I could enumerate all the things that are wrong with this reboot, but we just don't have time for that. One thing I do want to mention is that this movie got a lot of heat for casting Michael B. Jordan to play Johnny Storm. I am all for diversity in casting. In fact, instead of casting a white actress to play Sue, I thought it would have been better to cast a black actress and let Sue and Reed be an interracial couple, assuming this iteration ever got a sequel for them to be a couple in (NOT). Anyway, that one casting choice was not what made this movie suck. It doesn't matter to me what color or gender the actors are who play these roles. Those details change over time in the source material, sometimes with every new writer/artist team that creates them. What made the movie suck is the script and the fact that Trank fought with the cast the whole shoot.\n\nFrom left to right: Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, and Michael B. Jordan.\n\nLet's talk about the costumes. The suits have nothing to do with comic book canon and if Ben Grimm weren't in the photo I would have no idea what movie it was from. A word about CGI. CGI can't save a bad movie but it can kill a weak one, cough cough Green Lantern. I like The Thing being in heavy prosthetic makeup and real pants rather than CGI. It worked just fine for Michael Chiklis and going back much further, Ron Perlman in Hellboy. I'd much rather see a real actor in makeup than a motion capture suit that you've animated a costume on top of. Everyone's acting is better when you're acting with another actor rather than a green screen. Not that that would have saved this movie. But for god's sake, please put some pants on The Thing. He's still a man, he still has some dignity, right? Because all I can think of when I watch this is, \"Poor guy, he lost his penis.\" Because he looks like a cross between a naked GI Joe doll and the rock monster from Galaxy Quest. And at least Gorignak had a penis.\n\n​So we've had two weak films and a bad reboot. You'd think Fox would be ready to sell back the rights to these characters, You'd be wrong. Due to bad negotiation, Marvel now can't get them back. In an act of high dudgeon, Marvel canceled the comic series as well as all merchandise licensing, before the release of the last movie because one of the clauses is that any new character Marvel creates, automatically belongs to Fox. So Marvel has taken their ball and gone home. Fox has responded with the announcement that Fox is going to re-reboot FF as a kids' show along the lines of The Incredibles, but where the lead characters are the kids of Sue and Reed, rather than the actual FF team. Looks like it's going to be animated though, rather than live action, but with a script by Seth Grahame-Smith. Well Fantastic Four, Fox is just never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry (just the fans) never gonna say goodbye, never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.\n\nInterviews with Designers\n\nSpider-Man Franchise\n\nSpider-Man first appeared in 1962 and was the first teenaged superhero that was THE HERO and not the hero's sidekick. Peter Parker was just an ordinary NYC high school student when he was bitten by a radioactive spider giving him super powers. Peter struggles with taking care of his family, juggling his school work and job at the Bugle, trying to date girls, all the while fighting crime on the side. It's a tough life, but with great power comes great responsibility and it's his personal life that always seems to lose out.\n\nSpider-Man's suit is a classic one: patriotic red and blue suit with black lines of spider webbing running all over. He's got a black spider logo on his chest and another one on his back. His mask has white eyes outlined in black. Sometimes he has white webbing under his arms and sometimes he doesn't.\n\nTimeline of Comic Costumes\n\nLive Action Appearances\n\n​The Electric Company (TV series), 1971-77 Ramsey Mostoller\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (TV series), 1977-79 Frank Novak\n\nSpider-Man, 2002 James Acheson\n\nSpider-Man 2, 2004 James Acheson\n\nSpider-Man 3, 2007 James Acheson\n\n​The Amazing Spider-Man, 2012 Kym Barrett\n\n​​The Amazing Spider-Man 2, 2014 Deborah Lynn Scott\n\nCaptain America: Civil War, 2016 Judianna Makovsky​\n\n​Spiderman: Homecoming, 2017 Louise Frogley\n\nGallery of Costume Design\n\nSpider-Man was introduced as a new character in the fourth season of a PBS educational program for kids called The Electric Company, a show I watched religiously. Spider-Man would appear for short segments throughout the season to foil villains, nab bad guys or just generally help out. Danny Seagren looks great in his sleek Spidey-suit. It's not wrinkly, baggy, or saggy. The suit itself is a nice matte stretch-knit, not shiny, not latex. No built in fake muscles, no armor.\n\nDanny Seagren The Electric Company, 1974-77\n\nThe only odd thing about this version of the web-slinger is that he doesn't have a voice and only talks in thought bubbles while the other cast members speak. I didn't get why that was until my husband pointed out that the whole point was to get kids to practice reading. Duh. I was 8 when Spider-Man joined The Electric Company and could already read. I was probably too busy showing off for my mom and baby sister to notice that Spidey didn't talk. Here's a typical segment from the show.\n\nBecause the Spider-Man segments were so popular on The Electric Company, when the show got canceled, Spider-Man took his act on the road and starred in his own show that ran for two seasons on CBS, the network that was also responsible for all of the other superheroes on TV at the time: Wonder Woman, Shazam!, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Strange. Nicholas Hammond played Peter Parker and he looks equally good in his suit. The eyes are a tad weird looking probably because they are too small in proportion to his head. And I'm not sure what the deal is with that white utility belt he's wearing in this photo.\n\nNicholas Hammond The Amazing Spider-Man, 1977-79\n\n​For the time Spidey's wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities were really great special effects for TV. And the reason that the show was canceled after only 13 episodes was that it was too expensive to produce. Here's a clip. Peter's stunt double Fred Waugh, who is in the suit in this clip, was also the stunt coordinator for the show. It's fairly long and drawn out but at least watch until he's done fighting Ninjas in the hallway. After that they go up on the roof. It's fairly obvious how they did the wall-crawling now, but back then it was genius!\n\n​Marvel sold the film rights to Sony in the 90's. Sony made $800 million off of the first three movies, starring Tobey Maquire. Tobey Maguire found out early in filming that he was highly claustrophobic and couldn't wear the suit with his face covered. So it's only Tobey in the suit when you can see his face. All other shots are of stuntman Zach Hudson. And the suit does look fantastic on him.\n\nAs discussed in a previous blog, Peter Parker made his own suit. Yeah, right, sure he did. The only suit Peter Parker is capable of making is his wrestling costume. His actual suit was designed by James Acheson as one piece, except for the hood. He takes his hood off a lot. Later on a fly vent was added so that the poor man in the suit could go potty without having to take the whole thing off. You'd think that Acheson would have thought of that early on in the process. The Spidey suit really did look amazing. It was the peak of perfection of supersuits of its time. The one thing that bothered some fans, but not me, was that his spider webbing goo was organic and not something he invented. I didn't have a problem with that. It went right along with his improved muscle mass, eyesight, and coordination. The first movie was great, the second was not as great and the third movie was just crap. No one wanted to see Emo Spidey no matter how cool the Venom suit looked.\n\n​The reboot films star Andrew Garfield. The problem with these films may have been that Peter Parker was played by a 34 year old Englishman whose accent kept wandering. ​Also, he skateboards all over New York City, but now that he has super-powers he has to practice his skateboarding tricks in a \"training montage\". Shouldn't he be practicing web-slinging from building to building? It seems like that might be a harder trick to master. My husband joked that he should have been called Peter Parkour. Really the best and most believeable thing about the first movie was the relationship between Sally Field and Martin Sheen as Aunt May and Uncle Ben.\n\nAgain we are given the trope that Peter makes his own costume. I was laughing my ass off when he was hand-sewing his hood. Then he does a google search for fabric, \"spandex, spandex, spandex\". Am I really supposed to believe he hand-sewed his suit from a bolt of fabric with no pattern? Who did his fittings? Then he screen prints the spider logo on the chest, incorporates sunglass lenses into the hood, and his costume is all done and fits perfectly. And he does his own laundry. I guess the suit is machine washable. Also, he didn't invent his web shooting goo, he stole it from Oscorp. What?\n\nThe real problem with the supersuit in the first movie is that it's from Bizzaro-world. In no iteration is there a stripe up the leg or does the red area of the torso go that low down into his crotch. In fact, it ends in a princess waistline that is poking out on top of the bulge of his penis. This is not a good look for a superhero. There are curvilinear lines that travel all around the suit like they're drunk. If you look at the detail view of the fabric, it resembles a basketball with tiny holes punched into the fabric. The spider logo both front and back has super long legs that just keep going and going. And what is up with the white striping details on his boots? If you are from Texas, that totally reads as a cowboy boot heel. But these are aesthetic complaints. A more practical complaint is that he made his eyes out of sunglasses, fine for daytime crime-fighting, not so hot for nighttime vigilantism. This Spidey looks like he has a perpetual wedgie. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! Mama mia, mama mia! Mama mia, let me go! Beelzebub has a devil put aside for Sony! Sony! Sonyyyyyyy! And don't get me wrong, I feel really sorry for Andrew Garfield because he loves this character so much (it was his first Halloween costume when he was 3) and really wanted these movies to be good. But they just weren't.\n\nAndrew Garfield front\n\nAndrew Garfield side view\n\nI don't know if it was the nerd rage over the suit that influenced Sony's decision to get a new costume designer and redesign the suit for the sequel, but it didn't fix the inherent problems with the reboot, which is that the actors playing Peter and Gwen were too old to be graduating high school and that the script was bad. Nevertheless, Sony felt it was worth a shot, so Spider-Man's eyes went from small and black to large and white, the random leg stripe disappeared, the cowboy striped boot heel and toe also vanished, and the red area on the torso was raised, curved off at center front, and no longer points at his penis. So, yes, thank you for the fixing the most egregious problems with the suit. It still didn't fix the casting or the acting or the screen-writing. ​​The reboot movies tanked so hard that the third one was canceled. Thanks for not beating a dead horse, Sony, a la Fox and Fantastic Four.\n\nAndrew Garlield in Amazing Spider-Man 2, 2014.\n\nMarvel has now reached an agreement in which Sony retains the stand alone movie rights while Marvel regains creative control over the character in all formats. Which is why Spidey got to be in Civil War with the rest of the Avengers. Tom Holland is the new Spider-Man and he's a wee 5'8\" and just turned 20 when Civil War was released. I was surprised to find out that he's also English because his accent doesn't wander all over the place. Looking at his baby face I totally believe that he's 15. Also, Tom is a gymnast and a dancer--he played the lead in Billy Elliot: The Musical.\n\nSo here's the new suit that Tony Stark made. The spider logo on the chest is much smaller than we've seen before. You probably didn't notice but the eyes actually change sizes on camera, just like real eyes, they can squint with suspicion or open up really wide in surprise. The spider web lines only show up on the red parts of the costume and are actually two faint lines drawn right next to each other, rather than the thick, raised lines from the Tobey Maguire run. The blue parts have lines that resemble a technical drawing rather than spider webbing. I'm not sure what practical function these darker, thicker black lines serve, but maybe we'll find out in Homecoming. His web shooters take the form of grey bracelets probably a product of Stark Industries as well.\n\nI hear that we'll get a home-made version of the Spidey suit as well in the new movie but thank you, screen writers, for letting Tony Stark take all the credit for manufacturing this suit. Costume designers everywhere are applauding. I can't wait to see the crappy, home-made version.\n\n​Homecoming will be a collaboration between Sony and Marvel. Smart Sony! Smart Marvel! Hopefully Homecoming (release date July 7) will prove that collaboration makes better movies and more money and then Fox will fall in line with FF, because them giving up any control over X-Men is probably just too much to ever hope for.\n\nInterviews with Designers\n\nX-Men Franchise\n\nThe X-Men appeared in 1963. The X-Men are a group of mutants at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. They are born with an eXtra gene that manifests at puberty which gives them unique abilities that they must learn to use and control. It is my belief that these themes are the reason that this franchise is so overwhelmingly popular among teenagers because it connects with them on a personal level. The X-Men are trying to be accepted as human, to gain equal rights, and to be left alone to lead ordinary lives. Unfortunately, human-kind is prejudiced against them and fears them. Politically, humans are persecuting the mutant population, trying to get all mutants put away or locked up. Some mutants believe ordinary humans should be wiped out and mutants should rule the world. This faction of mutants is led by Charles Xavier's frenemy, Magneto. The title was concerned with social issues and used the anti-mutant themes to explore a variety of minority issues specifically racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, and LGBT persecution. As Chris Claremont said, \"The X-Men are hated, feared, and despised collectively by humanity for no other reason than that they are mutants. So what we have here, intended or not, is a book that is about racism, bigotry, and prejudice.\"\n\nThe original 1963 team members were Iceman, Angel, Beast, Cyclops, and Jean Grey in her Marvel Girl persona with Professor X as their teacher. Magneto was leading the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with his children Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver as well as Mastermind and Toad. Havok and Polaris were added as good guys later on to increase sales but it didn't work and Marvel stopped producing new stories. Eventually the title was canceled at the end of the Silver Age for 5 years.\n\nLen Wein, Dave Cockrum, and Chris Claremont revived the title in 1975 with new team members from all over the world. The Uncanny X-Men were Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Banshee, Sunfire, Thunderbird, and Storm, and were led by Cyclops. The bad guys got a new character as well: Mystique. The 1980's saw the greatest moment in X-Men canon: the Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix saga. Other important storylines include \"Days of Future Past\", \"The Trial of Magneto\", and \"God Loves, Man Kills\" all of which were incorporated into the film franchise.\n\nBy the early 80's X-Men was Marvel's top selling title which spawned five spin-off titles and longer stories were carried across all titles. Toward the end of the decade more new characters were added: Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Psylocke, Dazzler, and Jubilee. Apocalypse and Sabretooth were added to the ranks of bad guys. In a strange turn of events, Magneto becomes a good guy and takes over the teaching of the young mutants in Xavier's school.\n\nIn the 1990's a new title was launched in which the teams were broken up into two--Cyclop's blue team and Storm's gold team. New characters were Gambit, Cable, and Bishop. Emma Frost becomes a good guy and also teaches at the school. More new titles were launched, including Deadpool which we will get to in a minute. The animated series was launched in 1992 and ran for 5 seasons. Then 3 years later Fox starts making movies.\n\nTimeline of Comics Costumes\n\nCyclops\n\nCyclops is an original team member. His powers are laser beam eyes that he must shield with special glasses so as not to blow up everyone he sees. His real name is Scott Summers and he is dating Jean Grey. He has a younger brother named Arthur who is also a mutant and becomes Havok later on. Cyclops is the leader of the team and he prefers blue and yellow for his supersuit, the original team colors. Later on, when they split into two teams, Cylcops leads the blue team and Storm leads the gold team.\n\nJean Grey/Phoenix/Dark Phoenix\n\nJean Grey is also an original team member and a ginger. Jean's mutant powers are telepathy and telekinesis. In addition to being a mutant, she's also a designer and a model and takes it up on herself to design the team uniforms. She starts off as Marvel Girl, then she dies, and comes back to life as Phoenix, then gets taken over by evil and becomes Dark Phoenix, then sacrifices herself to save the universe. Then comes back (again) and finally marries Scott in 1994.\n\n1963-76 Accompanying text by Savage Mouse Part 1 of 13\n\n1973-1985 Accompanying text by Savage Mouse Part 2 of 13\n\n1991-94 Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 4 of 13\n\nStorm\n\nStorm joined the X-Men in the relaunch effort of Uncanny X-men. She's from Africa and is the daughter of a priestess. Here real name is Ororo Munroe and her mutant power is that she can control the weather. She has white hair and blue eyes. She went through punk phase in the late 70's before losing her powers and running off to Asgard to be a goddess. She then regains her powers, and heads the gold team. Later on she marries Black Panther and becomes his Queen.\n\n1975-83 Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 1 of 12\n\n1991-96 ​Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 4 of 12\n\nRogue\n\nRogue is from Mississippi and is very Southern. Her real name is Anna Marie and she has a streak of white in her brown hair. Her mutant power is that she sucks the life out of anyone she touches and (if mutant) absorbs their powers for a time. Rogue joined the team in 1981, absorbed Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) who remains a distinct personality in her head until killed by Magneto. She is assigned to Cyclop's blue team with Gambit, who she had a relationship with, although what that entailed we are not sure since she can't touch or be touched without deadly consequences.\n\n1981-85 ​Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 1 of 12\n\n​1985-91 Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 2 of 12\n\n1991-2000 Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 3 of 12\n\nPsylocke\n\nPsylocke first appeared in 1986. She was originally named Betsy Braddock and was English. When her mutant powers manifested, she got purple hair. Her powers are telepathy but not fighting skills until she fell into enemy hands during a mission and was altered with purple cameras for eyes and brainwashed. She was then rescued, killed and resurrected, but then lost by the X-Men and found by Mandarin, unconscious with no memories. Mandarin had her consciousness transferred into an Japanese brain-dead ninja woman and she became the assassin Psylocke. Don't worry, she was eventually found and rescued by the X-Men again.\n\n1986-89 Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 2 of 9\n\n​1989-91 Accompanying Text by Savage Mouse Part 3 of 9\n\nWolverine\n\nWolverine was added to the X-Men in 1975 as part of a plan to diversify the team and boost sales. Wolverine was born James Howlett in Canada, although he's actually the illegitimate son of his parents' groundskeeper, Thomas Logan who killed Wolverine's father. Wolverine manifests his bone claws and then kills Logan in return. His mutation allows him to live a very extended life and he eventually serves in WW I and II. At some point the military gets ahold of him and coats his skeleton with adamantium to turn him into Weapon X. Later he joins the X-Men when Charles Xavier recruits him. He has since become the most popular member of the team.\n\nLive Action Appearances\n\nX-Men, 2000 Louise Migenbach\n\nX2, 2003 Louise Migenbach\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand, 2006 Judiana Makovsky, Lisa Tomczeszyn\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine, 2009 Louise Migenbach\n\nX-Men: First Class, 2011 Samantha Sheldon\n\nThe Wolverine, 2013 Isis Mussenden\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past, 2014 Louise Migenbach\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse, 2016 Louise Migenbach\n\nLogan, 2017 Daniel Orlandi\n\nGallery of Costume Design\n\nMarvel sold the rights to the movies to Fox in 1993, so that's who's responsible for this mess. The problem is that it's a highly profitable one, unlike Fantastic Four. This is more complicated than the other two. Fox owns the right to the term mutant and any characters who were part of the X-men team, but they need Marvel to sign off on all television deals, which is why you haven't seen any live action X-Men on TV yet. There was an animated series in 1992 (before the legal wheeling and dealing) as a Saturday morning cartoon that ran for 5 seasons. What we're talking about now is the nine feature films and Hugh Jackman got to be in every single one of them. Many different characters have been part of the X-Men film franchise. The most popular characters that have made it into the films are Professor X, Magneto, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, Archangel, Mystique, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Psylocke, Quicksilver, but not Scarlet Witch.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the entire franchise is that the team is no longer in their classic costumes and everyone looks the same in all black leather. Cyclops even makes a joke about it.\n\n​Yes, actually, I would prefer yellow spandex. This is how the team looked in The Uncanny X-Men in 1991. At this point in time the X-Men have gone back to wearing team uniforms newly designed by Jean Grey, inspired by the original black and yellow uniforms but with blue instead of black. with the addition of the red belts.\n\nI blame this entire phenomenon of all black costumes on The Matrix which dropped in 1999. Kym Barrett was the designer on that film. In The Matrix, everyone is in black. It was a great look for The Matrix because that film is a dystopian sci-fi thriller. And it worked. With the immense popularity and financial success of The Matrix, (it made $463 million world-wide) and it's continued franchise success with two sequels, nine animated films, three video games, and a reboot currently in the works, it's hard not to get sucked into thinking that this is the best way to costume a movie. Everybody had Matrix fever.\n\nThe Matrix, 1999. From left to right: Carrie-Anne Moss, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne.\n\nHowever, The X-Men comics are not a dystopian sci-fi thriller, they are a superhero fantasy that is equal parts funny and action/adventure. My husband's opinion is that The Matrix just stole this look from Hellraiser, so it's all Clive Barker's fault. Keanu just needs to shave his head and have pins sticking out of his face, I'm surprised no one has done a parody mashup version already. Seth Green: Please, please, please do this on Robot Chicken! But I digress.\n\nHellraiser, 1987. From left to right: Butterball, Pinhead, The Female, and Chatterer.\n\nSo let's just take a minute to remember what the X-Men looked like on TV from 1992-1997. There's Wolverine in his yellow spandex and Rogue and Banshee, Gambit and Jubilee. Not only were the costumes colorful and unique to each character but, more importantly, this was a good show. The stories were straight from the comic books, there were good lessons for kids, good role models too. Strong female characters that get equal screen time and more lines than, \"Yes, Professor.\" Half of Season 3 was the Dark Phoenix saga.\n\n​​So why just three years later, do we lose all the color and uniqueness of each character and get this exactly the same black leather team uniform? Louise Migenback is the designer who's mostly responsible for this all black version of The X-Men. She was responsible for the first two and 3 more of the nine total films, which translates into 4/6 of the films I'll be talking about here. ​The problem here, Fox and Louise, is that any time you have a group of people who are all wearing uniforms, it's that much harder for the audience to tell them apart. And the minute bits of differently colored trim outlining the X just isn't enough. Especially in a two hour movie (compared to a TV series) when you just don't have that much time to get to know these dozen or so characters, you need more differentiation between their costumes to help the audience keep them all straight. Scroll down and look at all the group photos: a sea of heads in black suits. BORING! ​ And it just keeps going, and going, and going like the Energizer Bunny.\n\nX-Men, 2000\n\nX 2, 2003\n\nLast Stand, 2006\n\nAnd now I'm going on a feminism rant so bear with me. Storm is regarded as Marvel's most important female superhero. Not only was she one of the first black superheroes in general, but Storm was also the first female black superhero. Her historical significance is that the two defining aspects of her personality are her racial identity and her social status as a mutant. Because the debut of the series coincided with the Civil Rights Movement. the plight of the mutants has always mirrored that of African-Americans. Storm's creation in particular is seen as a strike against the hey-day of Blaxploitation films. Which is why it is so very distressing to me that these films gave Halle Berry almost nothing to do. Storm is a team leader. She took over running the team for Cyclops at one point and then led her gold team while Cylcops led the blue team. She is strong and makes good decisions in clutch situations. Where is the Storm stand alone film? Halle Berry really wants to do one.\n\nHere's the costume problem with Storm. Darker skinned actors don't show up as well in all black costumes as their lighter skinned counterparts. The artists who drew her knew that and fairly soon she ended up in white. Where is Storm's white costume, Louis? Also, this wig is super awful and doesn't add any height. Her hair should be a mane that flies out all around her when she's using her powers.\n\n​Mystique has lost all her clothes and developed some sort of skin disease, which I feel was just an excuse to sell a bunch of repeat tickets to teenage boys because Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was naked the whole time. She wears a white dress with a skull belt in the comics, but not in the movies. She has clothes on when she's impersonating someone else in the movies, so she's clearly capable of shape-shifting herself with clothes. Why is Mystique, one of only 4 lead female characters in the whole franchise, naked all the time? Yes, it's a really cool makeup job but you'd have had to do less of it if you'd just given her a costume and some dignity. Also, she hardly has any lines either.\n\n​Last Stand completely screws up the Jean Grey/Phoenix/Dark Phoenix story arc. The whole point of her character arc is that when she is recruited by Charles she is Marvel Girl. She becomes Phoenix when she sacrifices herself to save her teammates but is saved by an alien entity The Phoenix Force. She rises from the shipwreck as Phoenix in a green and gold costume. Later she is overwhelmed by evil and becomes Dark Phoenix and her costume changes to the very similar red and gold one. Dark Phoenix goes on a destructive rampage and after consuming a star and killing millions of people, Jean's personality finally resurfaces, manages to gain control over her body and commits suicide to save the world.\n\n​So the real problem here is that at no point do we ever get her transformation from Marvel Girl to Phoenix in the films, which is fine as long as you start the films with her already being Phoenix. Then when we do get her transition to Dark Phoenix her costume has to change colors. Instead what we get is this horrible black leather outfit that everyone else is wearing. Her Dark Phoenix costume looks like clothes, not a uniform nor a supersuit. Is it really too much to ask Fox for a supersuit, Judiana Makovsky and Lisa Tomczeszyn? Just one? Because I absolutely hate what she's wearing. In fact, it looks no different than what Marvel put Scarlet Witch in for Civil War, another design decision that was equally as bad.\n\nFamke Janssem\n\nDark Phoenix\n\nFamke Janssen\n\nThen there's Rogue. Rogue is the character Fox gets the most wrong. First, she was taken in by Mystique and Magneto and spent her first years as a bad guy until Professor X saves her and brings her to the school, which means she's not traveling with Wolverine until rescued by Storm and Cyclops. Second, Rogue doesn't show up at the school till the 80's, but the present day of the first film is 2000. Third, when she sets her sights on a boy it's Gambit not Iceman (Bobby), because Iceman was an original character and by the present day of the first film would be the same age as Cyclops and Storm. The whole thing is just all screwed up. But, even if you ignore how off the timeline of these characters are, Rogue still has more problems. She does not have a thing for Wolverine, ever, that was Kitty Pryde. And she is one tough cookie. Fox's Rogue is a weak victim whose only purpose is to make goo-goo eyes at Wolverine, and get stabbed, killed, kidnapped, manipulated, pitied, and rescued.\n\nClassic Rogue is always in green. Green is her signature color. Partially because she sucks the life out of anyone she touches and partially because she's jealous of everyone else who can touch and be touched by others. Of all the X-Men, Rogue is the most physically isolated. Fox at least gives her gloves to wear so that she doesn't accidentally touch anyone, but more often than not when she's not in the black leather suit, Anna Paquin has got so much exposed skin, that I'm sure she accidentally touched all her fellow actors while filming which is something that Rogue the character was always super cautious about. I just don't see that level of care taken with her character or her character's clothing choices.\n\nAnd thus ends the first trilogy about adult X-Men in the present day in 2000. Now we're going back in time. So once we remove the three installments about just Wolverine (Origins, Wolverine, or Logan) what we have left is the prequel trilogy that takes place at various stages in the past and is about the characters' younger selves. So the prequel trilogy starts with First Class which is set in the 1963. Finally we get some actual yellow on the uniforms, thanks to a new designer, Samantha Sheldon. First, let's remember how the original 1963 team looked in the comics, which is who this group of characters is supposed to be. There's Erik in his Magneto supervillian costume, Angel, Beast, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Iceman being all icey, his uniform is underneath all the ice. Notice that Beast did not start out being blue.\n\nFirst issue, 1963 Characters are from left to right: Magneto, Angel, Beast, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Iceman.\n\nHere's the team in First Class: Charles Xavier, Banshee, Havok, Erik, and Mystique. Everything about this picture is wrong. First, Charles should be wearing a suit, not the team uniform, because in the 1963 he was old, bald, in a wheelchair, and was running the school. Erik was already Magneto and they were already enemies. The other three kids in this photo shouldn't have been there. Havok showed up in 1969, Banshee and Mystique showed up in 1975. This should be a photo of Jean, Cyclops, Angel, Beast, and Iceman. If you can't even keep the players straight I don't know how you expect to do your source material justice. Timeline rant over. Now we can talk about what they are wearing.\n\nX-Men First Class, 2011\n\nThese uniforms are clunky. They do not look retro 60's in comparison to the black leather ones. X-Men uniforms are supposed to be aerodynamic so they can do all their running, jumping, and flying. At least Samantha added yellow and blue (albeit really dark blue) to the basic black. And each costume has a tiny bit of individualizing to it. There are some minute differences on the jackets--not everyone has the same collar, Banshee has some piping detail that the others don't, and Havok has a subwoofer in his chest. However, the costumes are still not individualized enough-- the sleeves, belts, pants, and boots are all identical. My husband said, \"They look like they're going to The Transformers Club on Bumblebee Fetish Night.\" I have provided you with Bumblebee from the animated series in 2008 for comparison.\n\nJames Macavoy as Charles Xavier\n\n​The point is that they don't look like X-Men. Now let me introduce you to Negasonic Teenage Warhead, from Deadpool, in her black and yellow costume which does look like an X-Men uniform. This is a much better design choice for that classic, sleek uniform, Fox! Be smart. Be like Deadpool!\n\nJean Grey\n\nNegasonic Teenage Warhead\n\nFor Days of Future Past we're back to Louise Migenbach and her sea of all black, all the time. This installment moves the events of the past ahead 10 years into the 70's and the events of the present ten years into the future where the mutants are at war with the self-aware Sentinels, invented by the humans to defend themselves from mutants. Future mutants use their powers to send present Wolverine to the past to prevent the war that will start ten years in Wolverine's future. Yes, I know, time travel plot-lines are both confusing and full of holes which is why Zimbio has drawn up this handy-dandy infographic to help us.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, here's answers for another eleven questions that you probably still have.\n\n​The yellow costumes from the past are gone. There is no 1970's team uniform because there is no team. Wolverine has to fix that. The present costumes get updated for the future with a bit more colored trim bits in among the black. And yes, that's Bobby with a beard, but no Rogue in this film, it's now Kitty Pryde that helps Professor X send Wolverine back to the past. I have no idea how her phasing powers allow her to do that and you won't find the answer in the link above either, because she can't, it's stupid, thanks a lot Fox!\n\nDays of Future Past, 2014: all the mutants.\n\nDays of Future Past, 2014: future mutants\n\nBy the time we get to Apocalyspe, the costumes get even worse. The team spends most of their time on a mission in all black Kevlar tactical gear.​Rogue got completely cut out of the last two movies, but worse than that, Storm is now a bad guy that the team is having to fight, along with Magneto, Psylocke, and Archangel.\n\nApocalypse, 2016\n\nApocalypse, 2016\n\n​Storm has had almost nothing to do on screen in this entire franchise and by the time we get to Apocalypse and she's the bad guy helper monkey, she's almost mute. What the hell, Fox? Storm is not a bad guy, never has been, never will be. Rogue is the one who's origin story includes hanging out with the bad guys. Get your alignments straight! And if you still have unanswered questions from all the damn plot holes, here's answers to twelve burning questions from Screen Rant.\n\n​​In this final installment we sort of get the classic 80's punk Storm, played by Alexandra Shipp. Well, we at least get the mohawk. This is the only X-Men who actually dressed in all black leather from her skin-tight pants to Callisto's war-trophy vest with popped collar. She accessorizes with knee-high boots, two belts, a studded choker, gloves, and lightning bolt earrings. This is a popular and well loved costume that lasted a long time in the comics. Your movie is set in the 80's why didn't you give us this costume? Instead what we get is this super-futuristic, cyborg armor- looking, grey-on-grey thing. And I see what you were trying to do, to unify the four Horsemen so that they all look like they belong on the same team with Apocalypse. And I would applaud you for that, if these were the actual Four Horsemen and not Storm, Psylocke, and Magneto.\n\nAlexandra Shipp\n\nLast, but not least, Psylocke is in this movie as one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen. Are you seriously going to give us Psylocke at the very end of the prequels, have her play for the wrong team, lose, and then just leave and not repent of her evil ways and join the X-Men with Storm? Seriously? At the very least we get the most comic book accurate costume to date and only because the actress, Olivia Munn, is such a comic book nerd that she insisted on it. And even then, the boob armor is from out of nowhere. OK, Psylocke, I see you've protected your boobs. Fine. Then I shall stab you in the heart and you'll die instantly or I'll stab you in the guts and you'll bleed out much more slowly. Which do you prefer?\n\nOlivia Munn\n\nAt the very end of the movie, the costumes are finally beginning to resemble colorful supersuits: Cyclops is wearing something that really does resemble his actual comic book costume. Beast is in blue, Nightcrawler is in red and has exaggerated shoulders. Mystique finally gets something that resembles her white dress from the comics, even if it's just the top and not the whole dress. Jean Grey is still in mostly all black but they've added small sections of yellow on her arms. Quicksilver and Storm are all matchy-matchy in grey on grey both with white/grey hair. They look like they're supposed to be brother/sister. Ignore the man in the plaid shirt, that's the director Bryan Singer. Meh.\n\nApocalypse, 2016\n\nApocalypse, 2016\n\nAnd now we're getting two more movies-- New Mutants and Dark Phoenix which are scheduled to start filming immediately. I have no idea what those will have in store for us other than, because we didn't learn our lesson rebooting Wolverine's origin story, now we're going to take the worst thing about the first trilogy and do it again. I swear, if they don't do right by Dark Phoenix this time, the nerd rage will be strong with this franchise.\n\nInterviews with Designers\n\nRotten Tomatoes: \"X-Men movies ranked worst to best by Tomatometer\"\n\n​I don't fully agree with their ranking, but the commentary points out the worst problems with each of the films in the franchise.\n\nTyranny of Style: \"The Latest from the Set of X-Men: Days of Future Past\"\n\nTyranny of Style: \"The Digital Costume Illustrations of X-Men: Days of Future Past\"\n\nHello, Tailor: \"The Costumes of X-Men: First Class, Part 1: Womenswear\"\n\nHello, Tailor: \"The Costumes of X-Men: First Class, Part 2: Menswear\"\n\nHollywod Reporter: \"'X-Men Apocalypse': Why Nightcrawler Got a Makeover\"\n\n​CDG: \"X-Men Apocalypse\"\n\nScreen Crush: \"X-Men Apocalypse Concept Art Reveals Ben Hardy's Archangel\"\n\nDeadpool Franchise\n\nDeadpol was created in 1991 and is the baby of the Marvel Empire. He is an anti-hero, something you really hadn't seen in comics before. Deadpool started out as Wade Wilson, a mentally unstable mercenary soldier. Because of his mental condition he doesn't remember his personal history, which changed depending on who's writing the stories. He was based on a cross between Spider-man and Wolverine. His first origin story made him part of the Weapon X program, like Wolverine; another made him seek a cure for his cancer and instead was given the super healing serum. He is the only character who knows he's fictional and continuously breaks the fourth wall. He is the wise-cracking, taunting, hilarious \"Merc with a Mouth\". His primary superpower is accelerated healing; his weapons are two katana swords. His skin is heavily scarred from the serum's effects and in a 2004 Cable & Deadpool comic said that he looked like a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a Shar Pei and the rest, as we say, is history. His costume has become part of our mainstream pop culture and shows up everywhere these days. It's just as iconic as Spider-Man: red and black full body coverage, not as aerodynamically stretchy as Spidey, more tactical, in case he gets shot, than practical, which he does A LOT.\n\nColossus is a Russian mutant who's skin turns into metal. He wears a bright red and yellow Eugene Sandow leotard in the comic books. The only character you probably haven't heard of before is Negasonic Teenage Warhead. She was only in one issue--New X-Men No. 115 in 2001. She was a student at Professor X's school but was killed. She was a telepath and could see three days into the future. I guess she didn't see that coming. For this movie her powers get an update, but not her attitude. She's an Emo girl who took her name from a song by Monster Magnet that was released in 1995. I included the video because I knew you'd want to see it for yourself.\n\nTimeline of Comic costumes\n\nLive Action Appearances\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine, 2009 Louise Migenbach​\n\nDeadpool, 2016 Angus Strathie; supersuit by Russ Shinkle\n\nGallery of Costume Design\n\n​The rights to Deadpool are also owned by Fox, with no loopholes like the X-Men. In the first movie he's part of the Weapon X program and gets his mouth sewn shut by the Doctor who gives him the super soldier serum. Fans hated that. You can't take the character known as \"The Merc with a Mouth\" and sew his mouth shut. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! Also if you have Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool and Deadpool is supposed to look like Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei, then this makeup is a disaster. If you don't know what a Shar Pei dog looks like, I've included a handy reference photo.\n\nIn terms of costuming Deadpool, Louise Migenbach is back with another sea of black para-military costumes. Everybody in Team X is a mutant and all of them could be wearing supersuits, but no. This is why I didn't bother talking about this movie earlier. For Wade Wilson you get two looks: Pre-superserum special-ops Kevlar vest over red t-shirt and OD pants and Post-superserum no Deadpool supersuit just wierd black lines on naked chest. WTF, Louise?\n\nThe first appearance of Deadpool was such a disaster, it's amazing that Ryan Reynolds was able to get his movie made at all. Luckily for us, he succeeded and it was so successful, ($783 million worldwide) it's going to get a sequel. And NONE of that money goes to Marvel. Poor Marvel.\n\nSo, the Deadpool suit is amazing. It looks exactly like the comic book and even though we can't see Ryan Reynold's mouth move that doesn't hinder his snappy dialogue a la Bane in Dark Knight 3. If you read the Tyranny of Style article, you'll find out that the studio responsible for engineering his suit is Russ Shinkle of Film Illusions. They are the real-life Edna Modes. You may not have heard of them before, but they were also responsible for all of the Avengers supersuits. Russ and his team had to make multiple copies of Deadpool's suit for Ryan and his two stunt men, (really just two stunt men? Wow.) and each headpiece was designed with multiple removable eyes that were tailored to the needs of each particular stunt... that's singular.\n\nHere's what Ryan Reynolds looks like as Deadpool. It looks a lot like what was drawn on the comic book cover.\n\nI could wax poetical about the awesomeness of their achievement in costuming, but we also need to talk about the two X-Men in this film: Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. We've seen a Colossus before in The X-Men Franchise, as played by Daniel Cudmore (who is an impressive 6'6\" and was even asked to play the part but turned it down because it was going to be all CGI) and he's no wimp, but just like Lou Ferrigno's Hulk, he suffers only by comparison to the comic book. Yes these guys are huge and muscley, but they aren't GIANTS. Colossus has to be a giant. If you read the Collider article it tells how they actually used 5 actors to bring Colossus to life because none of them were the 7'6\" tall that director Tim Miller wanted. Even Andre Tricoteaux, who wore the motion capture suit on set and is pictured below doing stunt work, is only 6'11\". He's huge, but he's bulky rather than sculpted and Colossus really needs to be a modern day Eugene Sandow.\n\n​​In terms of Colossus' costume, you already know how I feel about all of the costumes in the X-Men franchise up to this point. They are boring because they are all black and all the same all the time. So this version of Colossus is a vast improvement. No, he's not in the bright red and yellow Eugene Sandow leotard of the comic book as pictured above. They have kept the same basic X-marks-the-spot splashed across the chest but at least they've colored some of the X in red. Also, I'd like to point out that this is the best CGI rendering of clothing I've seen to date. When I watch this movie I totally believe that the CGI character is wearing IRL clothes. Just look at the cast shadow of his left arm on his vest and pants. Wow, CGI department, you did a great job.\n\nAndre Tricoteaux wearing a motion capture suit\n\nCGI Colossus\n\n​​For Negasonic Teenage Warhead, they've also kept the basic black and yellow suit from First Class but made it way sleeker with more area in yellow. The other improvement over First Class is that there's no cleavage- revealing, zipped all the way down to her navel thing going on in this movie the way Mystique wore it. Yes, in general these two costumes are still mostly black and yes they are tactical rather than spandex, however, I am not being forced to look at a dozen or more actors all wearing black. There are three actors: Deadpool is in red with black accents, Colossus is in black with red accents, and NSTW is in black with yellow accents, you know who's in ALL black? The bad guys. So where does our eye go in fight scenes? To the color! We are naturally drawn to watching the heros who stand out against a background of black. The one exception is NSTW's first costume is entirely black, but that's part of her character as an Emo girl.\n\nBrianna Hildebrand Negasonic Teenage Warhead\n\nBrianna Hildebrand Negasonic Teenage Warhead\n\nInterviews with Designers\n\nThe Avengers Franchise\n\nThe Avengers debuted in 1963 with a group of pre-existing superheroes that had only just been created a year or less before. Marvel got the idea of joining their characters together from DC's Justice League. The original team included Ant-Man, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, and the Wasp with Captain America (the only Golden Age hero) joining them as soon as he was discovered frozen in ice. Each character or team gets its own section so keep scrolling down and you'll find all of your favorite superheroes assembled here.\n\nThe Avengers, 1952\n\nWith the exception of Captain America, none of the Avengers had been invented by 1952 and in fact wouldn't be for another 10 years. But Ivan Guerrero brilliantly edited these films into a trailer for a film that predates most of its characters by a decade. There's a ton of easter eggs in there for the old movie fan.\n\nThe Avengers 2012-Present\n\n​Universal owned Hulk, New Line cinema owned Iron Man, Sony owned Thor, Lion's Gate owned Black Widow, and Columbia owned Black Panther, but by 2006 Marvel had gotten them all back.

He's the original Super Soldier. Steve Rogers, an actual WW II soldier is the product of a covert military experiment. He carries an indestructible shield. Near the end of the war he was frozen in ice and remained trapped in suspended animation for years until he was discovered and awakened to join the newly formed team of Avengers. That's not just his origin story, that is literally what happened to the character. Superheroes fell out of popularity after the war so his title was retired in 1949. He stayed on ice until 1964 when he was brought out of his golden age retirement to do battle with a team of new Silver Age superheroes.\n\nLike Wonder Woman at DC, he wears the most patriotic supersuit of all the Marvel characters. His costume is mostly blue with red and white stripes around his abdomen. His gloves and boots are red and the lower part of his sleeves are white. He wears a white star on his chest and his hood has a white A on the forehead with white wings above the ears.\n\nTimeline of Comics Costumes\n\nLive Action Appearances\n\n​​Captain America, 1944 Adele Palmer, Robert Ramsey\n\nCaptain America (TV movie), 1979 Charles Waldo\n\nCaptain America II: Death Too Soon (TV movie), 1979​ Yvonne Wood\n\nCaptain America, 1990 Heidi Kaczenski\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger, 2011 Anna B.

Because his suit was being filmed in black and white, it is difficult to recognize his colors as red and blue since the saturation level of both those colors in our flag are about the same. The \"blue\" reads black and the \"red\" and white stripes on his abdomen read too light to be red. His lower sleeves are white in the comic books, but here they are the same \"blue\" as the saggy tights and briefs. His gloves, boots, and briefs read the same color--black--not red or blue. Speaking of boots, he's not wearing the tall red boots with a cuff from the comics, he's in a pair of dressy ankle-length work boots.\n\nColorized Poster\n\nDick Purcell, 1944\n\n​1979 saw the release of two Captain America movies; Captain America and its sequel Captain America II: Death too Soon. Reb Brown played Steve Rogers in both of them but wore two different suits; the movies had two different designers. The first one is reminiscent of the jumpsuit Evel Knievel made famous but it could just be the addition of the motorcycle and helmet. This suit is not comic book canon. It's a high-necked, long-sleeved leotard worn over tights made from the same shiny lycra. The red and white stripes are worked into the leotard not around the abdomen but over the shoulder like a vest. The motorcycle helmet has the white wings painted on with the A in front. The boots, gloves, and belts are all matching red leather with white stars and a stripe. The shield is attached to the motorcycle and looks to be made from clear acrylic with the red stripes painted on. It seems to be functioning as the windshield. The central star is blue rather than white.\n\nReb Brown, 1979\n\nEvel Kneivel, 1971\n\n​​In the sequel, the stripes move to the abdomen where they belong, but become all wrinkley, the lower sleeves are white, the gloves lose their stars and stripe, and the wings on the helmet are now 3D rather than painted on. Also, his belt is blue not red.\n\nReb Brown, 1979 Death Too Soon\n\n​Then there was the low budget 1990 movie which was a vast improvement over the 1979 ones. The suit is much closer to the Silver Age comic that the previous one--no motorcycle helmet or goggles, no clear acrylic shield, much smaller wings. The problem with this version is it's got sculpted-in muscles, the fabric doesn't look like fabric at all, and it makes Matt Salinger's body look like a Stretch Armstrong doll.\n\nMatt Salinger, 1990\n\nStretch Armstrong\n\nComic books weren't selling well, this movie didn't help and by 1996 Marvel filed for bankruptcy. Marvel was about to sell Captain America to Warner Bros. when the idea for Marvel Studios was hatched and the deal was stopped before the papers were signed, thanks to David Maisel.\n\nIn the 2011 movie designed by Anna B. Sheppard, the USO version of the suit looks remarkably similar to the Golden Age comics even down to the shape of the shield. The only thing that's off is there are no blue stripes on the shield. Because this is really a period film, all the fabrics are made from fibers that were actually around in the 1940's: wool, cotton, flannel, etc.. The suit is clearly made from natural fibers and not some lycra/spandex/latex blend. The boots have a cuff, the gloves are the appropriate length and taper away from his arm. The hood includes eyeholes and the wings are both 3D and small. And in case you're still wondering how they made Chris Evans so puny at the beginning of the first movie, fxguide: \"Case Study: How to Make a Captain America wimp\" will divulge all the fx secrets.\n\n​Chris gets three suits in the first movie, two in Winter Soldier, one in Ultron, and two in Civil War. There are tiny little differences between all the suits and if you're really interested you can read Geek Tyrant: \"The Evolution of Captain America's Uniform\" who will painstakingly point them all out to you. At this point I am not interested in doing that because the costumes are great, and if I can't point out bad things, then what's the point? They're all great movies that you can watch over and over again without getting tired of them.\n\nBucky Barnes and Falcon\n\n​Bucky Barnes debuted right alongside Steve Rogers as Captain America's teen-aged sidekick in the very first issue in 1941. Cap and Bucky fought Nazis together throughout WWII until the plane exploded killing Bucky and dropping Cap into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Later, it is revealed that Bucky didn't die in the explosion but instead was rescued by Russian submarine and taken to Moscow where his severed arm was replaced by a bionic one. Due to his amnesia, he was trained as an assassin and called Winter Soldier during which time he had an affair with KGB spy, Natasha Romanova soon to become Black Widow.\n\nBucky starts off in a blue military style tunic with what looks like attached briefs trimmed with a yellow collar. He has red tights and gloves, blue boots and a black domino mask. As the Winter Soldier, he is in all black with his vibranium bionic arm with Soviet red star on the deltoid. He stays in the black domino mask. His hair is now long and shaggy and he looks like a cross between Severus Snape and Peter Pettigrew with his silver hand. It makes me wonder if Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting (the writer and artist) were big Harry Potter fans.\n\nFalcon was introduced in 1969 and was the first African-American superhero. When he was introduced it was not as a sidekick, but as a partner throughout the 1970's; the comics were titled Captain America and The Falcon. Sam Wilson was stranded on an island where he finds and befriends a falcon that he names Redwing. Also on the island is a group of exiled Nazi's who were supporting Red Skull during WW II. Sam actually got his powers from Red Skull when he fuses Sam and Redwing's minds giving Sam telepathic control over birds. Captain America tracks the Exiles to the island, teams up with Sam to help create the mechanical wings he uses to fly, thus creating the Falcon persona. They eventually defeat the Exiles and Red Skull, and remain a team thereafter. By 1979 Falcon has become so popular he gets his own title, but by 2004 he and Cap have teamed up again. Ten years later, Sam becomes Captain America when Steve Rogers steps out of the role in 2014.\n\nFalcon starts off in a green and orange costume that has a deep V cut out in the chest. but no wings. He wears one thick glove, a mask, and a falcon necklace. Later, his unitard changes colors to become the classic red and white keeping the same deep V with red wings. Now he has a white mask and two white gloves\n\nGallery of Costume Design\n\n​Bucky is a full-fledged soldier and thus gets a General Issue uniform to start. His Howling Commando uniform is certainly influenced by the comic book original but has been updated considerably. The top is a blue tunic with collar (not yellow) and he has boots and a belt. The tights and briefs combo has been replaced with brown fatigues.\n\n​In Winter Soldier we finally get to meet Falcon but he only gets a prototype of his wings in this movie. Bucky's costume is taken directly from the source material: all black, para-military. The vibranium arm looks fantastic on camera and his hair is perfectly shaggy and hanging in his face a la Severus Snape. The only real difference is that instead of the domino mask covering his eyes, he wears a half mask that covers the lower half of his face. I'm not sure what the idea behind this is. He's not snow skiing, so all this is really doing is making it difficult for the actor to eat, breathe, and talk and therefore for us the audience members to understand what he's saying.\n\n​​We finally meet Sam Wilson in Winter Soldier. Sam retired from active duty USAF to help vets suffering from PTSD at the VA, where he meets Steve who is now working for SHIELD and they become friends. Falcon gets his wings and goes on a mission with Cap and Black Widow to take out the Winter Soldier who attacked Nick Fury, only to discover that it's Bucky. It takes until Ant-Man before Sam gets his upgrade costume. It's still not great, but it's a vast improvement. You'd think that since Tony Stark made it, it would be more colorful. At the bottom of this section is an interview where Anthony Mackie is pissed because he didn't get the full on red spandex and wings treatment with an actual falcon from the get-go. It does my heart good to hear an actor saying he wants a more colorful and outrageous costume.\n\nInterviews with Designers\n\nAnt-Man and Wasp\n\nAnt-Man debuted in 1962, while Wasp was added a year later in 1963 as a love interest for him. Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym and Janet van Dyne met when Janet's father, noted scientist Vernon van Dyne was killed when he unleashed an alien force during one of his experiments Janet turned to her father's associate Hank to help her avenge her father's death. Hank has invented Pym particles which reduce the size of a human to the size of an ant. It also allows Janet to grow wings. They join forces to defeat the alien and in the course of working so closely together, Janet falls in love with Hank and eventually they start dating. Over the course of their crime-fighting partnership they discover that they can also use the Pym particles to grow giant sized. After Janet's death, Hank allowed his successor Scott Lang to take up the Ant-Man persona. Scott was an electronics expert working for Tony Stark when he stole the Ant-Man suit from Hank in order to save his daughter Cassie from a heart condition. Later, upon her father's death, Cassie also becomes a crime-fighter called Stature, and can now change sizes without the need of the suit as well as communicate telepathically with the ants. Too many second-hand Pym particles?\n\nTimeline of Comics Costumes\n\nLive Action Appearances\n\nAnt-Man, 2015 Samantha Howarth-Sheldon Differ​\n\n​Captain America: Civil War, 2016 Judianna Makovsky\n\n​Ant-Man and Wasp, 2018 Louise Frogley\n\n​Avengers: Infinity War, 2018 Judianna Makovsky\n\nGallery of Costume Design\n\nThe first Ant-Man suit was designed to be the original Hank Pym suit from the 1960's. It functions much like an astronaut's suit, delivering oxygen along with the Pym particles, cooling Ant-Man's body from the excessive heat generation, and defying the excessive density created by his shrinking. That's a lot to ask of one simple suit. The face mask has an elongated snout to suggest anty-ness and there's tubing coming out the back like antenna.\n\n​We get a brief glimpse of the original Wasp suit worn by Janet Pym in the first movie. It's design is also very 60's retro. I wish we'd gotten "
