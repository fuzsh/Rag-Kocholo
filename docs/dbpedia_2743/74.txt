Guy Ritchie’s marital meltdown and impending divorce from Madonna have a stranglehold on tabloid headlines, but the British director steered the focus on his new movie in a recent interview at Toronto’s York Hotel.

In the $15 million “RocknRolla,” Ritchie returns to the London gangster setting of his hit 1998 debut, “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.” This time, an old-time thug (Tom Wilkinson) and two bad-boy newcomers (Gerard Butler, Idris Elba) tangle with a femme fatale (Thandie Newton) and a coked-out rock star.

Richie, 40, “didn’t think about casting my wife in this movie” instead of Newton.

As to whether the two will ever work together again, he smiled. “I don’t know is the answer.”

It’s been eight years since his last gangster flick, “Snatch.” Ritchie says he needed the time “to derive enough nutrition” to write another caper.

“Also, London to a degree is the star of this movie, and it has changed so much in the last 10 years that it’s kind of not recognizable from the London of my previous movies.”

Dubbing it a “new kind of Wild West and the new New York,” Richie said London has “so much international money that it seemed pertinent and the timing right to make a story about that. Where there’s money involved, there’s crime involved. The human condition is uniform.

“The characters I’m interested are almost caricatures to a degree,” he said. “I’m interested in the comic book notion on celluloid, and I think you have to commit to that.”

Madonna’s brother, Christopher Ciccone, claimed Ritchie was uneasy with his sister’s circle of gay friends. As for the gay gangster who pops up in “RocknRolla’s” macho milieu, Ritchie laughed.

“I think it’s just an issue that I’m trying to get over and come to grips with my own sexuality.”
