        "text": "Lionsgate's Angel Has Fallen performed slightly above expectations this weekend, with a $21.2 million Fri-Sun frame. That's just below the $21.635 million debut ($22.7 million adjusted-for-inflation) of London Has Fallen in March of 2016 and (understandably) well below the $30 million debut of Olympus Has Fallen in March of 2013. Since this is the first time the \"Mike Banning saves America!\" series hasn't opened concurrently with a big animated feature (The Croods in 2013 and Zootopia in 2016), this is the first time this series has topped the weekend box office charts.\n\nMoreover, this is Gerard Butler's first chart-topping debut weekend for a live-action movie since he became \"a star.\" If you consider Zack Snyder's 300 and its gonzo bananas $70 million debut in March of 2007 (the third-biggest R-rated opening ever at the time) as Butler's \"coming out\" moment, then we should also note that he hasn't had a no. 1 opener since then. That's more trivia than anything else, but it points to the changing nature of the theatrical movie business and Butler's value as a B-movie film star.\n\nTo wit, the success of 300 led to Butler being hoisted up as a possible next big thing. However, in a reverse Patrick Swayze situation, his success in a blustery action movie led to a series of romantic comedies and romantic melodramas. Hilary Swank's P.S., I Love You legged it to $54 million domestic (and $156 million worldwide) from a $6.4 million opening in December of 2007. Kathryn Heigl's The Ugly Truth opened with $27 million in July of 2009 and earned $205 million worldwide on a $38 million budget.\n\nThat is Butler's third-biggest live-action opening weekend (we're obviously not talking about DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon movies) behind 300. It also opened in third place behind G-Force ($31 million) and the second weekend of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ($29 million). Jennifer Aniston's The Bounty Hunter earned $136 million on a $40 million budget in early 2010. Absent a bankable co-star (all due respect to Jessica Biel, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Teri Hatcher, Uma Thurman and Judy Greer), Playing For Keeps bombed with just $13 million domestic in late 2012.\n\nThe rom com wasn't dead until Hollywood stopped making them, but I digress. Butler was still making action movies here and there. In terms of wide releases (sorry, RockNRolla), Gamer opened with just $9 million over Labor Day 2009 and earned $41 million worldwide. A month later, again with a viable co-star, Jamie Foxx's Law-Abiding Citizen, a wholly original, R-rated, adult-skewing thriller, opened in second place behind Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are ($32 million) with a $22 million debut toward a $126.6 million worldwide cume on a $50 million budget. I'll let you decide which of those two movies and their respective successes is more mind blowing by today's standards.\n\nHe made something of an indie detour with Marc Forster's Machine Gun Preacher in 2011 and Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus along with Michael Apted and Curtis Hanson's surfing flick Chasing Mavericks in 2012. He started out as one of a dozen or so major movie stars roped into Movie 43, but it was March of 2013 where he more-or-less embraced his destiny as a meat-and-potatoes action hero. Antoine Fuqua's \"Die Hard in the White House\" flick was one of two such movies in 2013, along with Roland Emmerich's White House Down.\n\nWhile White House Down was a $150 million ode to Die Hard, the $70 million (and far more violent) Olympus Has Fallen had the crude carnage and stretch-the-bucks production values of a straight-to-VHS Die Hard knockoff. The unabashedly jingoistic actioner was more-or-less the first \"big budget\" R-rated action movie in a generation, coming after a decade where Hollywood had stuffed everything into the PG-13 box at the expense of \"just for kids\" movies and \"just for adults\" flicks. Love it or hate it, Olympus Has Fallen was a breath of fresh air in a PG-13 world, and it opened with $30 million (behind the $44 million debut of The Croods) toward a $98 million domestic cume and $162 million worldwide sum.\n\nSince then, Butler has made almost exclusively action movies. He returned to live-action three years later with Alex Proyas' controversial (it was a movie set in ancient Egypt that starred mostly white people) but delightfully insane action fantasy Gods of Egypt. The film earned $150 million worldwide, but it cost $140 million to produce. It opened with $14 million for second place behind Deadpool's third ($31 million) weekend. London Has Fallen opened with $21.635 million, second to the $75 million launch of Walt Disney's Zootopia, while Warner Bros.' Geostorm opened in second place ($13.7 million) behind the $22 million debut of Boo 2: A Madea Halloween.\n\nThe \"your weather is trying to murder you\" disaster flick earned $221 million worldwide, but only $33 million of that came from North America on a $120 million budget. STX Entertainment's Den of Thieves, a \"rip-off, don't remake\" riff on Michael Mann's Heat, opened with $15.2 million, third behind 12 Strong ($15.5 million) and the $19.5 million-grossing fifth weekend of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It eventually earned $80 million worldwide, and a sequel is currently in the works. The submarine thriller Hunter Killer flopped late last year.\n\nAngel Has Fallen, which cost just $40 million (the first two Mike Banning flicks cost $70 million and $60 million), has opened with $21 million. And, like the John Wick series (whose first film opened against Ouija and whose sequel opened against The LEGO Batman Movie and Fifty Shades Darker), it has scored its first chart-topping victory as a result of being the big movie of the weekend for once. Moreover, by default, it has given Butler himself the first live-action chart-topping opening weekend since 300 12 years ago.\n\nEven counting pre-stardom fare like Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, The Phantom of the Opera and Timeline, it's still only his second chart-topper outside of the first and third How to Train Your Dragon movies. What this means, to the extent that it's not just mere trivia, is two-fold. First, rank remains immaterial as much of it depends on when a movie opens in relation to the rest of the competition. Had Olympus Has Fallen opened two weeks later, it may well have opened with $30 million and been tops over the $25 million debut of the Evil Dead remake.\n\nSecond, Gerard Butler is a movie star for our current IP/tentpole era. By that, I mean that he can pull in a $15-to-$22 million debut weekend for action movies like Den of Thieves, Angel Has Fallen and Law-Abiding Citizen and those films can be big hits because the films didn't cost $100 million-plus to produce. A $13 million opening for Geostorm or Gods of Egypt is a disaster because those films cost $120-to-$140 million to produce. It's not that movie stars can't put butts in the seat, it's that often the movies are too expensive to depend on stardom as a primary pull.\n\nAs noted back when Den of Thieves opened, the mid-1980s/early 1990s movies that made Tom Cruise into a star were $15 million-$45 million studio programmers. When a big budget movie is $40 million and you can expect post-debut legs from a $10-15 million opening weekend, movie stardom is possible and real with or without IP. But when your big movies cost $150 million, and you have conditioned audiences to want movie stars as marquee characters, well it’s not entirely Chris Pine’s fault that Walt Disney’s The Finest Hours couldn’t justify an $80 million budget or that Chris Hemsworth can't open $100 million-plus vehicles outside of the MCU.\n\nIn a summer where unrequested sequels stumbled, Angel Has Fallen nearly matched its predecessor's opening weekend. It's a sequel to a sequel, but it's a franchise that began as a \"rip-off, don't remake\" original action movie, one that stood out by being unapologetically R-rated in a PG-13 world. In a season where alleged star power fumbled, Gerard Butler again showed that he is a genuine B-movie action star. He may not be worth the biggest salaries, and his films may not justify the biggest budgets. But if you put him in an over/under $40 million \"macho hero shoots bad guys and punches villains\" actioner, he's a pretty safe bet."
