        "text": "Psycho, by Robert Horton\n\nWhat good came from Gus Van Sant’s 1998 remake of Psycho? Well, it was nice to hear Bernard Herrmann’s music throbbing out of Dolby stereo theater speakers. The color design confirmed Van Sant’s talent as an inventive art director. Anne Heche was alert and vulnerable in the birdlike role Janet Leigh had played in the original version of the movie.\n\nOther than that, Van Sant’s faithful-but-flat update mainly served as an inadvertent testament to Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 masterpiece, simply by reminding Psycho fans of how good Hitchcock’s film was in the first place. Psycho has withstood critical disdain (upon its first release, anyway), three sequels and a remake, frequent lampooning, slavish imitations, and thousands of shower jokes. Its survival gives ample evidence of its status as an American classic.\n\nOne other aspect of Van Sant’s full-color, visually handsome remake is worth mentioning: its sheen throws the cheapness of the Hitchcock film into focus. Crucial to Psycho’s power is its drab, black-and-white, quietly depressed ambiance. Hitchcock’s technical mastery was not in doubt at this point, the director having just finished the impeccably-produced Vertigo and North by Northwest, so his decision to shoot the film with his TV-series collaborators, rather than his regular crew, is fascinating and defining. Supposedly Hitchcock was being a good businessman; he saw the rewards being reaped by low-budget producers of the drive-in era, and saw a chance to make a bundle on a small investment (which he did, since Psycho became an enormous hit). Another motivating factor was studio nervousness about the dreadful subject matter. Psycho was adapted from a horror novel by Robert Bloch, who based his book on the saga of Ed Gein, the Wisconsin madman whose misadventures would later inspire the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies.\n\nNot a subject in the classy Hitchcock vein, to be sure—so, yes, the producer-director was hedging his bets with a low-budget production. But I wonder if Hitchcock also instinctively understood the perfect match of budget and story. Psycho’s world, captured in the flat light of John L. Russell’s camera (he was a regular DP for the Alfred Hitchcock Presents TV series), is one of small apartments and shitty jobs and drab motel rooms, a series of private traps for sorry people. The movie turns a light, in a particularly merciless way, on the empty corners of the human soul; everywhere you look, it is a spiritual Phoenix, Arizona.

Here are some time-capsule looks at Godzilla pictures that orbited during my watch.\n\nGodzilla 1985 (published in The Herald, 1985)\n\nThirty years ago, a monster was born in the minds of some Japanese filmmakers: Godzilla, an enormous fire-breathing dinosaur who loved to stomp on Tokyo. The film made a lot of money, but when it was exported to the United States, somebody worried that it needed an identifiable American actor. So new scenes were shot and blithely spliced into the original. They featured Raymond Burr trying to find a way to defeat the indestructible monster.\n\nGodzilla spawned a raft of Japanese monster movies, and the big guy himself starred in many of them, often doing titanic battle with other monsters as Tokyo was repeatedly trampled underfoot. Now, just when you thought the trend was waning, it’s Godzilla 1985, a comeback picture that did good business in Japan last year. Once again, someone on the American side decided to put an American actor in place — and who better than Raymond Burr, reprising his original role?\n\nSo now, when Godzilla breaks out of his grave early in the film, there’s a cut to Burr’s face, bearded and bulkier, registering some kind of cosmic tremor. For a few minutes, it looks as though this remake/sequel might be fun.\n\nYou have the usual badly dubbed Japanese actors saying to each other, “We don’t know for certain Godzilla will attack Japan” (obviously, they’ve never seen a Godzilla movie).

This shot is a gag, a reference to the opening shot of Citizen Kane, which also surveys a fence and a No Trespassing sign. It’s not every el cheapo exploitation killer fish pic that starts with an homage to Kane, but this particular low-budget wonder is the work of director Joe Dante and writer John Sayles. The title Piranha had been handed to Sayles by legendary low-rent mogul Roger Corman, who found that the word “piranha,” in marketing tests, scored high on the cinema Richter scale, a Jaws cash-in just waiting to be made.\n\nThe opening shot does duty beyond the in-joke. It establishes that there’s something secretive and probably nasty out there in the forest. And with this gambit, Dante displays an attitude he will continue to to flaunt — and improve on — through his next films. This attitude is: When you’ve got to convey narrative information, why do it simply? If, in the space of a few seconds, Dante can make his plot point and an impertinent joke, why not? There’s that early moment in Gremlins when the young hero jogs down main street; in Dante’s layered treatment, we get 1) the information that a guy is in a hurry 2) camera movement and town layout imitative of It’s a Wonderful Life, which is about to turn up on TV and be a key source of the film’s parodistic energy 3) a movie theater marquee flitting by with the titles A Boy’s Life and Watch the Skies, which just happen to be the working titles of two films by Steven Spielberg (E.T. and Close Encounters), who just happens to be the “presenter” of Gremlins. Not everybody will get all that, but Dante doesn’t seem to mind.\n\nPiranha continues, in its opening moments, to a spooky nighttime forest, and we hear a voice: “It’s got to lead somewhere.” And as far as Dante and Sayles are concerned, if it’s got to lead somewhere, why not let it lead to the super-secret laboratory of a slightly-mad scientist who has been cultivating for military purposes a deadly strain of piranha that attack at will and can live in both fresh and salt water? Which is exactly where it leads. Two backpackers slip under the fence, see the pool, and decide the time is right for a dip. Well, you remember how Jaws began. The piranha start nibbling and the credits start rolling (white letters that slide into the pool and turn red — what else?). After the credits, another brazen shot: a close-up of the word “Jaws,” from which the camera pulls away to reveal a video game based on the movie.

A faraway look came into her eyes. ‘The last person who asked me that,’ she said, ‘was Mr. von Sternberg.'”–Roman Polanski, from Roman\n\nThat anecdote doesn’t lead anywhere, really, except to suggest the link between the craftsmanship of exalted glory-days directors such as Josef von Sternberg and the latter-day classicism of Polanski. In a peculiar way, the casting of Rosemary’s Baby (which, adapted from Ira Levin’s novel, was the hefty script Polanski handed to the Paramount secretary) makes this link, too. The weird denizens of the Bramford and the unforgettable Dr. Sapirstein are all played by Hollywood characters whose heyday was the 1930s and 40s: Elisha Cook, Jr., Sydney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon, Patsy Kelly, and Ralph Bellamy. It’s a gallery of waxworks, people we identify as being from another time, mustily recognizable although we haven’t seen them in a while (Gordon had been making films, but not in terribly important parts–it was after her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Rosemary’s Baby that she began her mostly intolerable string of pixies). Their identifiability as golden-age movie folk lends a touch of the fantastic, as though they constituted a movie colony looking for a pair of actors to play the leading parts in their (literally) diabolical plot. So they get Guy, who actually is an actor, and the malleable Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, daughter of the old-pro Hollywood couple Maureen O’Sullivan and director John Farrow. They’re all in the employ of Old Scratch himself, who might be akin to a cruel and golden-eyed studio head.\n\nAfter all, Polanski had just come from a disappointing job on Dance of the Vampires, which producer Martin Ransohoff had cut, dubbed, and saddled with a cartoon prologue. Polanski describes viewing the cut version: “Watching this, I felt the way a mother must feel when she finds out she’s given birth to a deformed child. The man had completely butchered my work.” The natal imagery can’t be casual, coming into Rosemary’s Baby.\n\nAnd consider too that Polanski, while no slavish homage-monger, does bring a sense of cinema history to his films. Rosemary’s new Vidal Sassoon haircut, for instance, invokes the cinematic memory of Falconetti in Carl Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc; both films emphasize close-ups of their close-cropped heroines, their prominent cheekbones flashing in the stark lighting. Joan led her people into a new age; that seems to be what Rosemary is going to do, albeit unintentionally. Both women hear voices, too–Rosemary hears them in her dreams, through the walls, and eventually must wonder whether her witch-fancies are in her head or across the hall.\n\nAnd this uncertainty is crucial to the film’s delicious suspense.

Link broken; review here:\n\nby Robert Horton\n\nI don’t remember the high school musical being quite like this. But then Disney didn’t finance Blanchet High’s senior-year production of “Fiddler on the Roof,” so no wonder.\n\nDisney stutter-stepped into a gold mine with its two made-for-TV “High School Musical” movies, squeaky-clean phenomena that bounced into tweener culture in 2006 and 2007. No surprise that “High School Musical 3: Senior Year” makes its debut on the big screen. And so we return to the hallowed halls of East High in Albuquerque, where kids sing and dance about their lives—and that’s before they take the stage. Despite their past success, the seniors don’t really want to do the school musical this year. Well, except for drama twins Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), who are a little weird that way. The school royalty, Troy (Zac Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens), will of course eventually join the ranks. Other less dazzling kids are also around, including Troy’s basketball buddy Chad (Corbin Bleu).\n\nAnd what conflicts will arise during senior year? Not much that’s really worth an OMG or an LOL, actually. Troy and Gabriella must face their college choices, which threaten to separate them. Other than that, there’s just a bit of facing-your-future angst floating around, but not enough to cause much trouble. Sure, Troy dances alone in a darkened gym with dozens of basketballs falling from the ceiling (huh?), but otherwise life is good. There are big production numbers (the biggest being Sharpay and Ryan’s fantasy about making it in showbiz), and small duets. The music and voices sound equally manufactured, like objects produced by a computer program geared for 2008 hit-making.\n\nZac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens (real-life sweethearts, as if you didn’t know) exude some measure of authentic, if minor, movie-star wattage. I don’t know to what extent their singing voices might be electronically enhanced, because everybody sounds the same. “HSM3” is energetically directed by Kenny Ortega, the choreographer of “Dirty Dancing” and the director of “Newsies,” an underrated Disney musical. He’s been the godfather of the “HSM” franchise, and the success of the thing owes a lot to his cheery attitude and his dancer’s eye, which lends some energy to every scene—whether people dance or not. Will there be another class at East High? A few juniors are groomed here, but remember the lessons of previous attempts at maintaining sequels without the original stars: Lest ye have Travolta and Newton-John, so shall ye end up with “Grease 2.” And nobody wants to see that happen to “High School Musical.”\n\nTomorrow, I launch a seven-day countdown to Halloween: horror pieces from the Archiva Hortonia. First up: Freaks.\n\nOn KUOW, I talk with Jeannie Yandel about Happy-Go-Lucky and a classic horror series: listen here. The film bit begins at 34:20.\n\nFiled under: Uncategorized | Tagged: Changeling, Happy-Go-Lucky, High School Musical 3, Pride and Glory, The Unknown Woman, Tru Loved | Leave a comment »"
