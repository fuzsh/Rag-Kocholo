        "text": "“It’s impossible to describe any artist’s style – Guy Ritchie”\n\nYes, the above line contradicts the title itself. Guy Ritchie was once asked in an interview to explain his style of filmmaking so he replied with those above words. Let me start with a brief introduction of Guy Ritchie. He was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire England in 1968. He left school at age 15 and started working at entry- level jobs in film industry. Guy didn’t go to any prestigious film schools, instead he has worked on his own from bottom literally. He used to do short films and commercials and the profits that he made during those times invested into writing and making his first short film – The Hard case (1995). It’s a 20-minutes short film and also a prequel to his first movie Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998).\n\nList of Movies by Guy Ritchie\n\n1. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) IMDB- 8.2\n\n2. Snatch (2000) IMDB-8.3\n\n3. Swept Away (2002) IMDB-3.6\n\n4. Revolver (2005) IMDB-6.4\n\n5. RocknRolla (2008) IMDB-7.3\n\n6. Sherlock Holmes (2009) IMDB-7.6\n\n7. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) IMDB-7.5\n\n8. The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015) IMDB-7.3\n\n9. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) IMDB-6.7\n\n10. Aladdin (2019) IMDB-7\n\n11. The Gentlemen (2019) IMDB-7.9\n\nNow, we can see the genre of all his movies fall under (Crime, Comedy), (Action, Adventure, Crime),(Comedy, Romance),Drama(Adventure,Fantasy). So, like he said - It’s not possible to describe any artist’s style. But If we look closely the movies that are good on IMDB ratings are mostly under Crime, Comedy, Action genre. So, I would like to analyse his style of filmmaking only for that genre but will keep in my mind some more of his movies too.\n\nGuy is admired as one of the best British Filmmakers and a director with distinct flavour of films. Let’s see what makes Guy a Mainstream Cult Director that separates him from other directors.\n\nSignature Style Analysis –\n\n1. Title Sequence - Guy is known for his stylish opening titles sequence. In movies like Snatch and RocknRolla we can see Stylish opening titles followed by music and characters\n\nintroduction. It’s really important to make the opening titles as best as they can be to make the movie’s first impression much impressive. My all-time favourite opening titles is of\n\nmovie “RocknRolla” that starts with the soundtrack of song “I am a Man” in background and the music continues throughout the movie to maintain its theme at same pace. If you are a Bollywood fan you must have seen the same soundtrack of RocknRolla manipulated and presented in movie Once Upon a time in Mumbai that added extra charm to its gangster theme.\n\n2. Multiple Characters with significant Role – So many times we see multiple characters in a movie but some of them do not fit as a significant role. But If we see Guy’s movie his characters are bold and significant.\n\n3. Music along with storytelling – Don’t you love a story while a strong music is playing in background that supports the story? That’s our Guy’s style if you will watch his movies you\n\nwill find the style of his storytelling totally unique. But this style is mostly in his Crime, Comedy, Action genre. Yes, Like I said I will focus mostly on this genre but wait will come to his other movies as well.\n\n4. Character’s Nickname and exceptional description – Guy not only includes multiple characters but sometimes he also gives nickname that suits the character. Like in movie Snatch – Bullet Tooth Tony (who got shot 6 times, had the bullets molded into gold and fix them into 2 two of his teeth), Boris the Blade or Boris the Bullet Dodger (who can dodge a\n\nbullet and it’s hard to kill him). His characters describe themselves and can give their own introduction. One more important thing is that Guy’s character repeats his characteristics\n\nthroughout the movie or you will find the actions of the character will define itself throughout the story. In movie Snatch there’s a scene where Brick Top explains his method\n\nof feeding human flesh to hungry pigs and the process in detail and he keeps on bringing his pig ideas.\n\n5. Parallel Multiple Scenes and Quick Cuts- Guy presents parallel multiple scenes that will be happening to create some tension in the movie but in the end they become mutually dependent for each other that leads to burst the tension of the movie. Guy is also known as “The Jump Cut Specialist” as he uses quick cuts in movies like Snatch and Lock, Stock… and RocknRolla these quick cuts explains the characteristics of individual characters and their relevance in the plot.\n\n6. Fast Dialogues and Cockney slang – You will see fast dialogue delivery by characters like Mickey from snatch to Sherlock from Sherlock Holmes. He also uses some cockney (east\n\nLondon native) slang and Humour in his movies. For Example, in the introduction scene of Turkish in movie snatch you will hear the fascinating cockney accent performed by Jason Statham.\n\n7. Slow Motion Action Scenes and Chutzpah – In Most of his movies like Snatch, RocknRolla and Sherlock we can see fight scenes in Slow motion with a Bang. His movies mostly include Foot chase scenes, Knuckle fight in slow motion.\n\n“Chutzpah” is what makes his movie separate from others and his crime,comedy genre are his best works as of now also they are amazing because of some chutzpah included in them. Like in movie RocknRolla the robbery scene in which One – Two and his friend Mumble steal the car but forget to ask for the key and then One-Two lowers the window of the car then asks for it."
