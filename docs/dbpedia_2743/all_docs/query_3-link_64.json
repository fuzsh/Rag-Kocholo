I have actual proof of this one, unlike Rolla :p\n\n1 – It isnt moral or legal to play live casino games at a casino and be sponsored by the casino. Kick off with that one. Also Davo doesnt promote any live casinos or specific land based places, so thats just not even close to anywhere near truth.\n\n2 – It IS possible to buy an old slot/pokie and use it in your garage for this type of thing. You can buy them wholesale or black market.\n\n3 – His streams do use casino based money, ive said this before. I know 2 of the casino he plays at. Ive spoken to their head of casino. I could have proved this in 30 seconds if he asked me, rather than days of looking for clues.\n\n4 – I do like the guy. He is a quality presenter, possibly best online for this type of thing aimed at under 40s. But i dont like his methods. He lies about his funds clearly.

He has money, thats easy to see, he makes it on affiliate income.\n\nCan we stick to the topic please.\n\nWhy on earth is @rbreen91 blabbing on about Australian casino’s. It’s not even relevant to this subject.\n\nAll that is being said, is that they could deceive not that they are deceiving. So end that pointless part.\n\nDavoSlots and Roshtein “could’ be deceiving, manipulating and lying.\n\nThe overwhelming evidence and coincidences towards them being decievers is fucking obvious.\n\nThey invest nothing personally but time. And then have the gaul to say they are good guys. By doing giveaways and giving to charity.\n\nThe money they give away isn’t fucking theirs. It’s all fraud-con and manipulation money.\n\nJesus can no one see the absolute cancer behind all this?\n\nIf you have no morals then by all means defend them. But don’t expect people like me to stand in a corner and allow you to make them out to be doing nothing wrong.\n\nYour just as bad as they are if you in any way support what they do.\n\nJesus Christ.

He has money, thats easy to see, he makes it on affiliate income.\n\nIt’s very easy to buy any old/new fruit/slot machines nowadays…EBay and GumTree are full of them, create an atmosphere in the background to make it appear your there? Possibly.\n\nId like to point out the telephone conversation between Paul and a representative of a casino in which he was offered a free roll balance…that is clear as day.\n\nWhy would you risk your own money if you don’t have too…? If you simply want to be “YouTube famous” then why not? It’s obviously popular or sites like this wouldn’t exist, so I get why it’s done, I get Roshstein doing it with 10k viewers, collecting the affiliate money without any risk to his own money? I think most would also.\n\nBut it’s not right, morally it’s disgusting and god knows how many children now think “fuck work I’m gonna gamble instead”, I think this Aussie guy has too just be honest like Labowsky, Spintwix and Bandit who show transactions. Kudos to Paul for finally making me like/respect him after all this time, good lad."
