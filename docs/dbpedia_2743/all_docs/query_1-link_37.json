        "text": "Lee Sorensen’s Property is in a 38-home neighborhood in Westminster. Mr Sorensen wanted to create a backyard oasis that was both beautiful and water-efficient. He worked with Abby Rupsa, one of our favorite landscape designers, with Boranical Living to create a plan that included a variety of xeriscaped plants, as well as a stamped concrete patio and wood planters. We don’t typically suggest stamped concrete, but Lee appreciated the cost of stamped concrete as opposed to pavers.\n\nFrom fire pits to grills and pavers in-between, our work is inspired by the success of those around us. More specifically, our humble clients enjoying a more customized space to fit their individual needs. Here we’ll tour you through our 3 favorite projects and share why we thought they stand out above the rest.\n\nOne of our passions as a hardscaping company is to provide our customers with a place to spend more time outdoors enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. However, during extreme weather conditions, such as when it’s raining or in the hottest part of summer, it’s hard to get outside and enjoy your space. That’s why we offer many options for pergolas and enclosures, so that everyone has a space to enjoy outdoors, no matter the weather conditions. We value quality materials for all our projects and that’s why our favorite brand of enclosures to install is Suncoast Enclosures.\n\nAn outdoor kitchen is a great addition to any home, not only for the convenience it offers, but also for the added value it can bring. When done right, an outdoor kitchen can increase your home's value significantly, making it a smart investment for homeowners.\n\nWhether your space is for entertaining guests, cooking meals, or spending time with family, it's important to choose the right appliances and features to make your outdoor cooking and dining experience as functional and enjoyable as possible.\n\nI spoke with one of the owners, Becky, landscape designer Kristen Whitehead at Helios Landscape Design, and Jason Beck with Rock N Roll Stoneworks about their project in downtown Louisville. As you can see in the before photos, their backyard needed work. Becky and Rob’s dogs had made their own private escape: digging in the dirt, tearing out and killing much of the grass. The front porch and entryway also needed some attention. The left side of the patio had sunk three inches and although it had since been sured-up, it required some leveling before anything further could be done to it.\n\nContinuing our design series, we immediately thought of this project project in Boulder, Colorado. It was designed by one of our favorite designers, Kristen Whitehead, at Helios Landscape Design. We routinely work with Kristen and this project has many design aspects that we absolutely love and would like others to find inspiration in.\n\nWe spoke with Abby Rupsa, the owner and landscape designer at Botanical Living, LLC on a project we completed in late 2022. We regularly work with Abby on projects and we think this one was particularly successful. It received some recognition with one of the largest paver companies, Belgard, in one of their catalogs.\n\nWhen you look outside during this time of year, planning for upgrades to your backyard is possibly one of the last things on your mind. In reality, winter is actually one of the best times of year to attend to or start planning hardscaping projects for your yard.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to create an outdoor space that's both stylish and functional, and add comfort during sunny, a pergola is a great option. At Rock and Roll Stoneworks, we offer both wood and metal pergolas that can be customized to suit your needs. Wood pergolas are a classic choice that can provide both shade and protection from the elements. Metal pergolas are a more modern option that are known for having durability and being low maintenance.\n\nWe'll discuss how to design a new fireplace, which inserts are best, and how to incorporate stonework into your fireplace surround. So if you're ready to give your fireplace a makeover, keep reading!\n\nif your patio isn't looking its best, you might not be able to enjoy it as much as you'd like. Follow these five tips for cleaning your stone patio and you'll be sure to have a space you can enjoy until fall firepit season arrives with leaves to be blown away.\n\n“Patio of your dreams desired? Want a meticulous craftsman with a fabulous professional crew and the utmost integrity? Rock n Roll Stoneworks just finished our patio which was a fairly large job because of our sloping yard (6 ft. retaining wall) and desire to have it nearly level with our patio door. He spent countless hours with us and was very patient as we selected our materials, changed, and tweaked the design more than a few times. He listened to what we wanted and designed a patio to fit the look we envisioned. His crew is phenomenal, courteous, and easy to work with. We couldn’t recommend them more…”\n\n— TRICIA F - 5/13/2019\n\n“I would highly recommend Rock N Roll Stoneworks for any hardscape project you are considering. Jordan and his team are professional, courteous and true craftsmen. They are dedicated to customer satisfaction well beyond the contract. We are really glad that we chose them for our project!”\n\n— JASON B. - 10/4/2018\n\n“It seemed like my patio was done in no time and made the house look incredible with the little details! Not only did an amazing job but was very attentive and punctual making sure they got the job done in spectacular fashion!”\n\n— CHRIS G. - 2/16/2018\n\n“Quality work by quality people. If you want your stonework to be perfect without having to pay an egregious amount, give them a call. Jordan is a stand up guy with the craftsmanship and work ethic I needed for my big project. Highly recommend!”\n\n— KATIE J - 2/17/2018"
