        "text": "I may be prejudiced. But it seems to me the talent gene pool in the Ritchie family is a lot deeper on Guy’s side.\n\n“RocknRolla,” the latest film from the man soon to be the ex-Mr. Madonna, is a terrifically entertaining, if mostly merely stylish exercise in laddish, London-gangster-movie tropes. If “The Long Good Friday” (1980) were an Abbott and Costello movie, it would have looked and sounded a lot like this.\n\nMeet Mr. One-Two (Gerard Butler) and his partners Mr. Mumbles (Idris Elba of “The Wire”) and Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy). Bob’s about to go to the slammer for a “five stretch,” and on the eve of the event confesses to Mr. One-Two that he is in love with him. What’s a big, dumb, good-looking, supposedly straight tough guy gonna do when a best buddy is in need?\n\nYou’ll have to find out. Ritchie makes a travesty of plot by throwing in everything except the kitchen sink and then throwing in the sink. It involves the barbaric, suspiciously Putin-esque Russian mobster Uri (Karel Roden), who is looking to cash in on London’s real-estate boom, whose loaned-out “lucky painting” gets lifted; a crack-addicted rock star Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell of “Control” in a star-making turn), rumored to have fallen off a yacht and drowned; and a couple of Chechen hit men who are hell’s own equivalent of the Energizer bunny.\n\n<div style=\"width:425px;padding:10px; margin:0 auto;\n\nbackground-color:#efefef; font-size:10px;\n\ncolor:#555;text-align:center”>RocknRolla trailer (Story continued below)\n\nAlso in the mix are the “dirty Cossack’s” beautiful accountant (Thandie Newton, yippee, letting hair down), who recruits One-Two, Mumbles and Bob to rob the Russian, and brutish London mobster Lenny (a hilariously simian Tom Wilkinson), who dips low-lifes into a Thames teeming with ravenous crayfish in an effort to find who has the painting.\n\nThe painting, which we only see from behind, is the film’s MacGuffin, and if “RocknRolla” sounds like a riff on such masters as Hitchcock and Quentin Tarantino, that’s what it is.\n\nBut nobody riffs like Mr. R (“Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” “Snatch,” “Revolver”). He may be making the same movie over and over again with varying results, but when it works it puts a pint-addled smile on your face and a spring in your step. That is to say: Who needs meaning when what you’re looking at is a dazzling demonstration of the art of filmmaking?\n\nRitchie, who also wrote the gangster-patter-sodden script, also has a Fellini/Tarantino-esque eye for a striking face and idealized male and female forms. His cutting technique combines a whooshing sound and a sudden shift to the right or center. Unlike the moronic “Wanted,” “RocknRolla” can afford to be outrageously violent in a cool sort of way.\n\nThe soundtrack, featuring such titles as “Have Love Will Travel” “The Gun” and “Bankrobber,” is as propulsive and concussive as you might expect from a man married to Madonna for the past seven years. Sorry about the divorce, Guy.\n\nBut “RocknRolla” is a gas.\n\n(“RocknRolla” contains profanity, violence and sexual situations.)\n\nRated R. At AMC Loews Boston Common, Regal Fenway Stadium and suburban theaters."
