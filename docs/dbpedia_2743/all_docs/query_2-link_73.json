        "text": "Episode 45 - RocknRolla (2008) - Full Review Movie Podcast\n\nIf Guy Ritchie isn't the most polarizing filmmaker working today then he's in the playoff, is he now a cheap imitation of his once great self or does he still have \"IT\".\n\nRocknRolla is the last great Guy Ritchie film! That was the statement from Dan on the Land, we are about to find out as we dig deep into the London underworld and discover just what a RocknRolla is. An All-Star cast brings to life another Guy Ritchie joint with beats similar to its predecessors, we know early on what we will get— a great serving of cockney humour and action with a side dish of Thames crayfish.\n\nRocknRolla, released in 2008 and directed by Guy Ritchie, is a stylish crime comedy that has become a beloved part of his filmography. The movie follows a group of criminals hoping to get their hands on an illicit fortune involving shady real estate deals. By weaving multiple subplots together, weaving in memorable characters with colourful dialogue, and using snappy editing to great effect, the film creates a dynamic atmosphere where anything can happen.\n\nThe influence of Rocknrolla on popular culture today lies largely in the legacy of director Guy Ritchie’s body of work. His earlier films such as Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) also explored similar themes—namely London’s underbelly—but RocknRolla took these ideas to the next level by adding an extra layer of poignancy and humour. As a result, it not only kickstarted a new wave of British gangster films but also became essential viewing for fans of ironic yet exciting crime capers.\n\nOf course, the most endearing feature about RocknRolla is its cast; it features some amazing performances from Tom Wilkinson as Lenny Cole, Mark Strong as Archie, Thandie Newton as Stella and Gerard Butler as One-Two among others. Each character has their own distinct mannerisms that make them instantly recognizable while still staying within the confines of Guy Ritchie's unique style. Audiences have certainly noticed their presence—many actors from this movie would go on to appear in several other big-budget productions afterwards because they were recognized for their incredible performances here.\n\nBeyond the awesome acting though, one thing that people tend to remember most about RocknRolla is its soundtrack—in addition to having songs from U2 and AC/DC it also includes some classic covers (such as Iggy Pop’s version of Bowie’s Moonage Daydream). This music perfectly captures the moody yet tongue-in-cheek vibe that the movie was going for; it entrances you into its story and helps keep your interest level up even during its slower moments.\n\nFor all these reasons and more, it’s no wonder why RocknRolla continues to be remembered fondly by fans today; this is without a doubt one of Guy Ritchie's best movies! It strikes just the right balance between keen plot development and raw energy while setting up its own unique world full of fascinating characters. Whether you are familiar with Guy Ritchie or not his work here should be celebrated for its creativity and dynamism; if you haven’t seen it before now is definitely the time!\n\nPlease follow the Podcast and join our community at\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/borntowatchpodcast\n\nIf you are looking to start a podcast and want a host or get guests to pipe in remotely, look no further than Riverside.fm\n\nClick the link below"
