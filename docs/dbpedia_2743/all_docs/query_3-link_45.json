        "text": "Before booking an appointment please read our booking policy as once you have booked an appointment you have agreed to our terms and conditions.\n\n​\n\nCancellation policy\n\n​\n\nWe understand that emergency cancellations can occur and we will try and be as understanding as possible. We are a small business and late cancellations or no shows can majorly impact us financially. We are self employed and if we don't fill that space then we are going to work effectively coming into work for free. Please understand that we also have families and bills to pay.\n\nOnce your appointment has been booked and a non refundable deposit has been made please be aware that we need 72 hours notice to cancel a colour service and 48 hours for all other services.\n\nIf a cancellation has been made within this time we will move your deposit over to your next appointment, if its after the allocated time 50% of the original appointment will be required before booking again. If its an on the day cancellation full payment for the appointment will be required before another appointment will be allowed to be booked. We hope you understand why we have to put this policy in place.\n\n​\n\nAAT (Allergy Alert Test) IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD A PATCH TEST AND ATTEND YOUR APPOINTMENT WE WILL CANCEL YOUR SERVICE AND YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO PAY. PLEASE PLEASE CALL US IF YOU ARE UNSURE ABOUT THIS.\n\nFor your first AAT with us or if it is 6 months since your last AAT; Make an appointment to attend the salon at least 48 hours before your appointment. We will apply a small amount of colour formula to the inside of your elbow. Leave for 48 hours, should you experience any signs of irritation, reddening, swelling, inflammation or itching please contact us. If you develop symptoms that make you unwell please contact a medical professional. When you attend the salon we will observe the test site and ask you to complete a questionnaire. Subsequent colour services may not require an AAT test subject to screening questions. We advise you to speak to your stylist about what is best for you. All our stylists have been trained to test and screen for suitability for colour services. We have vast experience in safe colouring – you can be sure we only use the best products and invest in the most up to date practices. We take your safety and our work seriously. Please let us know if you have had covid since the last time you had your AAT. As we will need to re test.When you visit us you can have peace of mind that we are taking the best care of you and your hair. We thank you for your co-operation in our preliminary procedures before your service with us.\n\n​\n\nHow long does an AAT take and how much does it cost?\n\nYou will need an AAT appointment at least 48 hours before your colour appointment. It only takes 10 minutes in the salon and is a free test.\n\nWhy do I need a skintest?\n\nReactions to hair colour can be serious and even life threatening. There are strict guidelines from manufacturers, insurers, industry bodies and the MHRA around using hair colour. We endevour to give you peace of mind so that you can safely enjoy your visits to the salon.\n\nWhy don't you test me every time?\n\nWe use screening to monitor the need for testing you before your service. If nothing has changed since your last test and we have a valid record (typically within the last 6 months) it will be OK to proceed with your service."
