        "text": "British actor Tom Wilkinson, known for films like The Full Monty, Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has died aged 75.\n\nWilkinson won a Bafta for 1997's The Full Monty, and reprised the role of Gerald when a Disney+ streaming series revisited the characters 26 years on.\n\nHe received six Bafta nominations in total as well as two Oscar nominations, for Michael Clayton and In The Bedroom.\n\nHe died suddenly at home with his wife and family, they said in a statement.\n\nGeorge Clooney, who starred with Wilkinson in the 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, praised the actor as \"the epitome of elegance\".\n\nPaying tribute, he told Variety magazine: \"Tom made every project better. Made every actor better.\n\n\"He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us.\"\n\nWith more than 130 film and TV credits in total, Wilkinson was as comfortable in period dramas like 1995's Sense and Sensibility and 2013's Belle, as he was playing criminal masterminds in movies like Rush Hour opposite Jackie Chan in 1998, or Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla in 2008.\n\nHe also earned an Emmy for playing US political figure Benjamin Franklin in 2008 mini-series John Adams and an Emmy nomination as John F Kennedy's father Joe in The Kennedys. He played President Lyndon B Johnson in 2014's Selma, and appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel and Girl with a Pearl Earring.\n\nHis death on Saturday was confirmed in a statement shared by his agent on behalf of his family.\n\nWilkinson was, according to the Encyclopaedia of British Film, \"a major character star, with a remarkable gift - one among several - for conveying inner pain\".\n\nRobert Carlyle, who starred alongside Wilkinson in The Full Monty, described him, as \"a huge performer, a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his, but of any generation.\"\n\nIn a tribute on X, formerly Twitter, British actor Phil Davis called him \"powerful and delicate and hugely intelligent - one of the very best\", while singer and actor Will Young described him as \"British acting royalty\".\n\nUS film maker Scott Derrickson said Wilkinson was \"an amazing talent\" and recalled a time when the actor gave him a surprise kiss on the lips on the set of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\n\nBorn in Leeds before moving to Canada and then Cornwall in childhood, he found his calling at the age of 18 when he was asked to direct a play.\n\n\"For the first time in my life, I started doing something I knew how to do,\" he said.\n\n\"I realised it wasn't necessarily just these southern middle-class types that got to be actors; it could possibly be people like me. And once I knew, I never changed my mind.\"\n\nHe trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) before following the well-worn path to theatre and television work. In 1986, he got his first major screen role in mini-series First Among Equals, based on Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novel.\n\nPlaying alongside him was Diana Hardcastle. The couple married in 1988, and also went on to play husband and wife in The Kennedys in 2011, and in 2014 action film Good People. The couple had two daughters, Alice and Molly.\n\nWhen he portrayed Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit for the BBC in 1994, Wilkinson said: \"I looked at it and I thought, I can't get it any better than that. It came out exactly as I meant it to come out. It won a couple of prizes and I thought, I can act, there's no question.\"\n\nThree years later, he was cast as a former factory foreman who joins fellow unemployed workmates in staging a strip show in The Full Monty.\n\n\"I was simultaneously offered the lead in a TV series and a possible part in a low-budget movie,\" he told The Guardian.\n\n\"I remember phoning a friend and he said, 'Take the TV, take the TV'. But I didn't follow his advice, and the TV turned out to be crap.\"\n\nThe low-budget movie, meanwhile, turned out to be the highest-grossing British film up to that point, and took his career to a new level on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nWilkinson received high critical acclaim for Todd Field's 2001 US domestic drama In the Bedroom, in which he played a bereaved father. He was nominated for an Oscar for best actor.\n\nHe hoped the film would do two things for him, he later said. \"One, [prove] I could play the lead role in a movie. Two, I could play an American lead role. And it did both of those things.\"\n\nThe actor earned his second Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Tony Gilroy's 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney.\n\nIn the 2005 New Year Honours, Wilkinson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama."
