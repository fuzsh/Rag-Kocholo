Elvis brought him to Los Angeles as his personal aide and Schilling worked in several capacities, whilst continuing his studies in liberal arts and film at UCLA. He started as Elvis’ movie stand in, learning Hollywood from the ground up, but later branched out into areas of public relations, film editing and producing on projects that Presley executive produced.\n\nAs Presley’s career moved from hit films to sold out concerts, Schilling went on the road with him and learned the many duties & responsibilities of the business of concert touring. In 1974, Jerry was commissioned by Elvis to head his own production company, Elvis Presley Films ‘EPF’.\n\nJerry served as Creative Affairs Director for Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) for ten years. He negotiated the first contract between RCA and EPE since the death of Presley 10 years earlier. Schilling was the liaison to Elvis’ label RCA Records, making significant progress to make Elvis’ image and likeness available, which cleared the way for numerous feature films and TV projects.\n\nMost recently Jerry served as an Executive Producer with Priscilla Presley on a documentary project with HBO titled Elvis Presley: The Searcher. The two-part documentary, following Elvis’ creative journey from childhood through his final 1976 Jungle Room recording sessions, recently premiered at SXXW and was voted as one of the Top Ten picks of the Festival. Elvis Presley: The Searcher, airs on HBO in April 2018.\n\nFew men in popular music have enjoyed a career comparable to bassist and producer Norbert Putnam. As a teenager in Alabama, Putnam made history as part of the original Muscle Shoals rhythm section, playing bass on hits by Top 40 artists like Arthur Alexander, Tommy Roe, and The Tams. By the mid-1960s, he had moved to Nashville and quickly joined a loose group of young musicians regularly called upon for the rock, folk, and R&B recordings coming out of Music City. Putnam played bass on thousands of recordings with some of the most iconic artists of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Putnam retired from the music business. Selected to design the recording studios and serve as director of the new Delta Music Institute at Delta State University, he developed the multi-disciplinary curriculum and taught for two years.\n\nFrom recording and producing with icons like Jimmy Buffett and Joan Baez to playing bass on 120 recordings with Elvis Presley from 1970-77, and touring Europe and Brazil with the big screen “Elvis in Concert” show; Putnam’s recent memoir “Music Lessons, Vol. 1” captures it all.\n\nJack Soden is the CEO of Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. Jack grew up in Kansas City, Missouri and attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado.\n\nAfter graduation, he went to work in the investment banking industry. While working as Executive Director of a money management firm, he met a client, Priscilla Presley. Upon her request, he came to Memphis and helped develop a business plan for opening Graceland.\n\nToday the company has more than four hundred employees, and Graceland has become one of the nation’s premier tourist attractions with annual visitors in excess of 600,000, bringing an estimated $200 million per year to the Memphis economy.\n\nThe organization has grown into a worldwide entertainment, licensing, merchandising and music publishing enterprise. The company also owns and operates The Guest House at Graceland resort and hotel.\n\nJack serves on the boards of The Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, The TN Tourism Committee, The ALSAC Leadership Council for St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, University of Memphis College of Communication and Fine Arts, and the National Advisory Board for the National Civil Rights Museum. He is a member of The Society of Entrepreneurs and has served as chairman and a board member.\n\nTom Brown served as Vice President of original productions at Turner Classic Movies in Atlanta for 17 years. During his tenure, he oversaw production of all long form documentaries and in-studio shoots. He also served as executive producer on five Emmy-nominated documentaries and series.\n\nIn addition, Tom was the executive in charge of production on special Elvis Presley projects featuring Priscilla Presley, Jerry Schilling, D.J. Fontana, and the TCB Band among others. He is one of few producers who has been allowed to shoot at RCA Studio B in Nashville, Radio Recorders Studio in Los Angeles and inside Graceland Mansion in Memphis.\n\nFor more than 15 years Tom has served as the host of Elvis Week events at Graceland interviewing Elvis’ family, friends, musicians and movie co-stars. He has been a frequent guest DJ on Sirius/XM Elvis radio and serves as a host of the EPE produced web series, “Gates of Graceland.” In addition, every year Tom hosts the Tupelo Elvis Festival and for the last two years has co-produced and hosted the Nashville Elvis Festival.\n\nHe is a graduate of Tupelo High School and the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theater Arts.\n\nSCHEDULE OF EVENTS (TIMES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE)\n\nFriday, April 20, 2018\n\n9:00AM - Registration with coffee and pastries in the Lobby\n\n10:30AM - 11:30AM - A Conversation with Jerry Schilling moderated by Tom Brown in the Sanders Soundstage\n\nFeaturing clips from the new HBO documentary “Elvis Presley: The Searcher,” for which Jerry Schilling served as an Executive Producer\n\n12:00PM - 1:00PM - Lunch around town\n\n1:00PM - 2:00PM - Behind the Scenes of Graceland & Elvis Presley Enterprises with Jack Soden, CEO of Elvis Presley Enterprises in the Sanders Soundstage.\n\nModerated by Tom Brown\n\n3:00PM - 5:00PM - Screening: He Touched Me: The Gospel Music of Elvis Presley in the Sanders Soundstage\n\n5:30PM - 7:00PM - A Conversation with Norbert Putnam on Music Lessons in the Sanders Soundstage\n\nWith Norbert Putnam’s first memoir, Music Lessons: Volume One, he looks back on a career unrivaled in its diversity.
