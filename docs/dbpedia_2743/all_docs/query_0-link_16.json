        "text": "Music\n\nLissy Taylor revels in single girl summer on ‘Your Girl’\n\nFresh off a main stage performance at Derbyshire’s Y Not Festival alongside British legends like Noel Gallagher and The Vaccines, Lissy Taylor’s summer is nothing if not busy. With a slew of high profile gigs in the rearview and another in the field, the Stoke-on-Trent native’s also got her hands full with “Your Girl,” a punchy alt-rock ode to being single.\n\nMusic\n\nPilar Victoria gets personal on poignant new single ‘Dancing In The Sand’\n\nPilar Victoria is only 18 years old, but she’s hardly a rookie. Having released her debut single, “Wilted Flower,” at just 13, the Argentine-American teenager has racked up millions of streams and reportedly major label interest as well. Her latest, “Dancing In The Sand,” arrives courtesy of a collaboration with Grammy-winning producer Happy Perez and a relationship that went awry.\n\nMusic\n\nROSEYE explore humanity on jazzy debut album ‘Every Move’\n\n“We’re all about diving into that deep connection music brings – mixing up explosive, groovy vibes with some trippy and peaceful sounds. Our upcoming album ‘Every Move’ touches on some personal themes like sexuality, spirituality, nature, and grief, we wanted it to be liked a journey through the highs and lows of life”\n\nMusic\n\nExpress Office Portico deliver anticipated debut EP “Incommunicado”\n\n“‘Incommunicado’ similarly displays not only an exposing set of lyrics written about topics such as childhood trauma, substance abuse, and unstable relationships, but also includes the overarching theme of an inability to communicate with and fully understand the world we live in due to this.”\n\nMusic\n\nAzul Kechi goes classic R&B on new single “No Drama”\n\n“‘No Drama’ is my response to all the crazy things life can throw at you. Keeping peace of mind is so important to me, and it’s pretty damn hard to stay sane in this thing we call life. As I say in the song, ‘protecting my peace, never take that for granted,’ It’s my daily mantra and something I try to live by.”\n\nMusic\n\nMyrillion and Leoné Murphy explore waves of infatuation on ‘La Petite Mort’\n\n“We wanted ‘La Petite Mort’ to sort of wash over you again and again. To feel like a fever dream – a bit like that initial madness you go through when falling in love. The strings and cinematic elements definitely bring some romance but the bass and deep groove try and evoke that intensity, and at times the instability.”\n\nMusic\n\nSwiss songwriter Anastasia Solay feels evolution in “Start a Fire”\n\n“‘Start a Fire’ is about how even though you can go through hard times, you can always learn something that is helpful to evolve as a person.” Hailing from Geneva, but born in San Francisco, Anastasia creates a brand of indie that’s difficult to describe with just one genre. Groovy, haunting, and organic, her sound touches on everything from soul to jazz to rock.\n\nMusic\n\nDutch indie darlings Loupe return with new single “Tested Waters”\n\nAfter an eventful 2023, in which the group released their debut full-length, Amsterdam indie rock quartet Loupe are quick to strike again. Their newest comes in the form of “Tested Waters,” an indie rock earworm that haunts as much as it drives. Devout female vocals fall against a smooth alternative soundscape distinctly marked by a string section that wastes no fretboard.\n\nMusic\n\nArtistic Freedom & Small Town Rock ‘n’ Roll : A conversation with The Glorious Sons\n\n“We’re a small town band” Says Brett Emmons, lead singer of Kingston, Ontario’s The Glorious Sons. The group, which has been together for over a decade now, can be found playing arenas in their homeland of Canada, but carry themselves with a scrappy populist swagger that’s fit for a dive bar.\n\nMusic\n\nLiverpool’s Toy Car ponder humanity on “Better Than Before”\n\nFresh off a sold out hometown show and a BBC Radio 1 debut, Liverpool’s Toy Car are back with their newest track, “Better Than Before.” Beneath proper drums and distortion is a yearning for humanity, says frontman Shaun Hough. “We are all human and we all make the same mistakes and can learn from them,” he remarks.\n\nMusic\n\nIndie band Pompeya keep things groovy on new single “Cold”\n\nThe Muscovian group have kept fairly quiet in terms of new releases since 2020’s LP Bingo, but after long wait, are back. Their new single “Cold” is classic Pompeya – groovy, dancey, and retro – but moves with a sort of presence that is undeniably current. It’s an exploration of location, and what lead singer Daniil Brod calls a “peculiar” form of “sad travel.”\n\nMusic\n\nOld World, Underground… Here They Are Now: A Conversation With Metric\n\nNorth American indie rock stalwarts Metric may call Toronto home, but what’s in a home anyways? The four-piece band, which is centered around songwriters Emily Haines and Jimmy Shaw, has…\n\nMusic\n\nDutch Criminal Record stay dreamy and warm on “Apathy”\n\nClean guitars, lush harmonies, and some implied sunshine. That’s the vibe on “Apathy,” the new single from Brighton-based indie rockers, Dutch Criminal Records. A bit of a nod to the Beach Boys, it reaches for breezy alternative flavors that have been repurposed time and again in indie rock – most notably the American 60s, British 90s, and Australian 2010s. It’s no surprise the band hails from where they do, as at any given moment, the mixtape would be well-fit for surf and sun.\n\nMusic\n\nThe Cost of Loving keep grooving on new single “Esports Player”\n\n“I’m… bewildered by the idea of people playing video games as a professional sport or filming themselves in the act for their millions of followers,” he says of the song’s title, a nod to athletes of the now-multi-billion dollar industry centered on professional gaming. It’s a smooth play in sequence with the Nottingham-based band’s other two singles this far, and perhaps a good flash of what else they’ve got in store."
