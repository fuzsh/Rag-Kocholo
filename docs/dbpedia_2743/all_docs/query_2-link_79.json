        "text": "Madonna and Guy Ritchie will soon be battling in divorce court, but first they'll square off at the box office. Madonna's directorial debut, \"Filth and Wisdom,\" arrives Friday at the Cedar Lee Theatre in Cleveland Heights. Her husband's raucous gangster flick, \"RocknRolla,\" lands here next Friday.\n\nSince Madonna recently labeled Ritchie \"emotionally retarded\" in one of her opening splitsville salvos, it's only fair to note that her ex-in-waiting made a much better movie. But then he's had more practice.\n\nMadonna stayed behind the camera for \"Filth and Wisdom,\" though she does manage to weave a few of her songs into the soundtrack, along with her one-time smooch-partner Britney Spears. Her low-budget film is more of a salute to the grit of Gogol Bordello, the gypsy punk band fronted by Eugene Hutz.\n\nHutz, a Ukrainian singer, plays A.K., the Ukrainian singer-poet-philosopher who pays the rent with a part-time gig as a role-playing cross-dresser. He shares a London flat with Holly (Holly Weston), an aspiring ballerina who moonlights as a stripper, and Juliette (Vicky McClure), who works at a pharmacy and steals drugs to raise money for suffering children in Africa. They trade pieces of dignity for a greater cause, even if, in A.K.'s case, that greater cause is self-promotion. We learn that degradation leads to wisdom, and once you've attained wisdom you end up back in the filth, and so on.\n\n\"Filth and Wisdom\" reaches desperately for cutting-edge commentary. But it strains at nearly every turn, underlining its BIG POINTS in clumsy ways. (I won't even mention the bitter blind tormented writer guy.)\n\nA.K., who serves as narrator and conscience, offers some charms, but he cavorts with characters lacking depth, energy and chemistry. Madonna, who also co-wrote the script, aimed for a free-form art-house romp, but produced something far more lumbering, like an earnest term paper from sophomore year."
