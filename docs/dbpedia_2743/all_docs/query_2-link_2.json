        "text": "People ask the question what's a RocknRolla? And I'll tell 'em it's not about drums, drugs, and hospital drips, oh no. There's more there than that, my friend. We all like a bit of the good life - some the money, some the drugs, others the sex game, the glamour, or the fame. But a RocknRolla, oh, he's different. Why? Because a real RocknRolla wants the fucking lot. -Archy (Mark Strong)\n\nWhen Archy goes to pick up Lenny's two million from the Spealer, he says in his narration, \"the Wild Bunch have had to put a little extra money on top to ignite Lenny's contacts and maybe, just maybe, Lenny's magic wand can make Bob's legal paperwork mysteriously disappear\". Cut to the scene where Bob surprises One Two at Spealer, Archy calls him and tells him, \"someone lose a bit of paperwork did they, One Two? Yeah well next time you remember that's exactly why you pay Lenny, understood?\""
