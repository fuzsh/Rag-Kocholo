        "text": "The gangster of gab is back with his most ambitious film. Should you dive back into the wild world of Guy Ritchie? Here is my full review of THE GENTLEMEN and the answer to that question.\n\nYes, of course, you need to dive back into Guy Ritchie’s world, you silly cunt!\n\nWhy?\n\nFirst off Guy Ritchie never went away. After the world noticed his genius from Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells and Snatch he gave us Revolver and RocknRolla. Those R films were done during his “Madonna” days in which the first chink in Ritchie’s armor started to appear. He would get big budgets and take on famous characters. First was his quirky Sherlock Holmes that was a super adept fighter more so than a smart sleuth. He’d also remake The Man from U.N.C.L.E, King Arthur and Aladdin. Granted U.N.C.L.E. had some quality the typical Guy Ritchie edge was not present in any of his films post RocknRolla. Sherlock had the pacing but felt a little off. In fact his long time producer partner turned director Matthew Vaughn would end up taking over the Ritchie mantle. Vaughn’s Layer Cake was everything Guy Ritchie was leading up to until he met Madonna of course. Vaughn would go on his own big budget hiatus but his Kick Ass, Kingsman and even his X-Men take were all better than Ritchie’s output. So why does THE GENTLEMEN work as the “return” of Guy Ritchie? Simple it has all of the new tricks and big budget style but is a story Guy has had in his mind for over a decade.\n\nProducer Bill Block sums it all up nicely, “Guy wanted to venture back to his roots for this project, and the cast he pulled together was phenomenal”. Couldn’t agree more!!\n\nSpeaking of that tremendous cast. Well originally the idea was a TV show so an epic ensemble was always on the table. But Guy has called all his A-list friends on this one! Starting out with Texas’ finest Matthew McConaughey as our lead gangster Mickey Pearson. There’s the sultry and quick witted wife Rosalind played by Downton’s Michelle Dockery (her red bottomed LBs deserve their own film). Charlie Hunnam is Mickey’s right-hand man Ray and he is basically the audience as he guides the journey from Hugh Grant’s wild Fletcher. Grant’s performance alone is worth your time and money! If Hugh ain’t enough than Colin Farrell’s gypsy Coach is quite possible one of the funniest characters created for 2020. There isn’t a moment on screen with Colin that isn’t hilarious and filled with supreme violence. Coach and his “boys” deserve a tv series. Jeremy Strong rounds out the American characters with the conniving Matthew. Tom Wu and Henry Golding play the rival Asian gang leaders who have their own beef. And add in British gangster movie royalty with Eddie Marsan. A tremendous cast that is pure fire anytime they are on screen. But Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell are worth seeing by themselves!\n\nGuy Ritchie’s fast paced dialogue is mirrored by the camera work. Ritchie even pushes his fun antics to tongue-in-cheek tackle camera aspect ratio, digital vs film, and delivers a car crash for the ages. The film also interweaves its twisty tale with such bravado and gangster appeal you can’t help but go…yep that’s right.\n\nSimply put.\n\nThe guns, gangsters, glamour, and tons of ganja welcome us all back to the wonderful wacky world of Guy Ritchie. Incredible ensemble seems to be having as much fun trying to out do each other that Ritchie’s glitzy grammar hits new epic heights.\n\nHere is my first favorite film of 2020!\n\nTHE GENTLEMEN.\n\nDirected by: Guy Ritchie\n\nWritten by: Guy Ritchie, Ivan Atkinson, Marn Davies\n\nRated R\n\nSelig Rating 5 Stars\n\nRunning Time: 1hr 53min\n\nAction / Comedy\n\nWide Release: January 24th\n\nStarring: Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan, With Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant\n\nThe Selig Rating Scale:\n\n5 Stars – Excellent movie, well worth the price.\n\n4 Stars – Good movie\n\n3 Stars – OK movie\n\n2 Stars – No need to rush. Save it for a rainy day.\n\n1 Star – Good that I saw it on the big screen but wish I hadn’t paid for it."
