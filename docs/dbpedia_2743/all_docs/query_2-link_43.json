        "text": "Guy Ritchie's next project will be the low budget caper movie RocknRolla, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film, said to be in the vein of early Ritchie hits Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, will start shooting in the summer. Ritchie has written the script himself and is currently in the process of assembling a cast.\n\nSandra Bullock has been granted a three-year restraining order against a stalker who reportedly tried to kill her husband at the pair's California home last month. Marcia Valentine is said to have driven her Mercedes onto the couple's Orange County estate and attempted five times to run over TV mechanic Jesse James. A Santa Ana judge ordered Valentine to stay at least 152 metres (500 feet) away from Bullock and her family. The woman is currently on bail awaiting trial on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon."
