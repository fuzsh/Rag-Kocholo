        "text": "Meet Your Photographer\n\nI’m a daydreamer. A hopeless romantic. Best friend to all animals. I wanna experiment. I wanna try new things and push the narrative. The day might feel quick but we’re gonna vibe together while I get the shot. If you’re having fun, I’m having fun. If you’re crying you bet your ASS I'm crying. (Hi, cancer over here. What’s your sign?) I want the candid, the raw, the emotional. I want the lovers who wanna run away and buy ice cream after the ceremony. Or the ones who want to hide away to make out. I want the people who smoke a j before their ceremony or the ones who take shots. Got a petting zoo? Hell yeah. Bringing a tattoo machine? Lets fuckin go. I wanna celebrate YOUR LOVE. I want to celebrate what makes y’all, y’all.\n\nWHAT I BELIEVE AND LOVE\n\nI believe black lives matter. I believe love is love. I think the more tattoos you have the cooler you are. I'm from Austin so I love live music. Music festivals are the greatest thing ever. I love traveling as you can see, but I believe there is power in learning when you visit other cultures. I think west Texas is one of the greatest places in the world. I love trying new food, although my significant other is a great cook I'll choose going out to eat any day. I believe we should be nicer to the environment. I like true crime podcasts like Last Podcast On The Left and My Favorite Murder (#SSDGM). I think minimalism, although it's beautiful, is a death to all things creative. I wear many hats and do more than photography! I think Wes Anderson is a far better director than Quentin Tarantino. I love all kinds of movies, but Lords of Dogtown takes the cake. I love skating and BMX. Photography is my biggest way of expressing myself and it always will be."
