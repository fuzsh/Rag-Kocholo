        "text": "I would have no problem on this issue if the fake streamers were upfront and transparent but they are making money by misrepresenting themselves. I can say for a certainty people sign up to support a channel and also enter giveaways etc so if they are not playing with or making real money except through affiliation earnings they are conning the audience who have created their wealth based on a lie. With that said can you also trust their giveaways? What’s to stop them rigging giveaways to fake accounts?\n\nIt basically all boils down to one thing, personal responsibility. If you lose money based on watching this person, guess what, its down to you.\n\nI don’t back the next goal scorer in some random match just because Ray Winstone tells me to. But if I did, I wouldn’t blame him. Guess what, it’d be down to me.\n\nGamblers are the absolute worst for this type of thing. No one anywhere can ever MAKE you lose your money. It is literally always down to you. People just need to grow up, stop blaming everyone else and take some responsibility.\n\nSome of the commets on Rollas video were asking about the live casino thing and some that watch Davo have said its the same machine and theres no normal casino noises. Dont know what video it is I have never watched him but the comments on you tube are from both sidesand pretty much agreeing with a few saying they had never noticed it before."
