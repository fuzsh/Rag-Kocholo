        "text": "King Gustav V of Sweden, Oscar Gustaf Adolf (June 16, 1858 - October 29, 1950), was the eldest son of King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway. At birth he was created Duke of Wermelandia (VÃ¤rmland). On December 8, 1907 he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian two years earlier.\n\nHe married Princess Victoria of Baden on September 20, 1881. She was the granddaughter of Sofia of Sweden, and her marriage to Gustav V united the reigning Bernadotte dynasty with the former royal house of Vasa.\n\nDuring a series of scandals in the 1950s known as the Haijby affair, which was in turn a continuation of the Kejne affair, it came to public knowledge that the king was, and had always been a bisexual. This is said to have \"made virtually no difference to his marriage\".\n\nGustav V was the last Swedish King to intervene directly in the politics of the country, in 1914 on the disputes over defence budgets.\n\nGustav V was also a devoted Tennis player, appearing under the pseudonym Mr G.\n\nChildren\n\nKing Gustav VI Adolf (1882-1973)\n\nPrince Wilhelm, Duke of Sudermannia (1884-1965)\n\nPrince Erik, Duke of Westmannia (1889-1918)\n\nImportant\n\nOpener of the 1912 Summer Olympics\n\nPreceded by:\n\nOscar II King of Sweden\n\n1907-1950 Succeeded by:\n\nGustav VI Adolf\n\nde:Gustav V."
