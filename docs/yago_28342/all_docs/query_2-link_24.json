        "text": "Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden (born Prince Carl Gustaf of Sweden on 14 January 1947) is the current reigning King of Sweden. He is the fifth child and only son of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Vasterbotten and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He is also a member of the British Royal Family as the husband of his late wife Theresa, Princess Royal.\n\nLife[]\n\nCarl Gustaf's father died just twelve days after his birth in a plane crash in Denmark. Carl Gustaf thus became heir apparent to his grandfather, King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, then Crown Prince of Sweden.\n\nMarriage and Issue[]\n\nCarl Gustaf first met his cousin, Theresa, Princess Royal, during a state visit to the United Kingdom in 1983. Carl Gustaf and Theresa's engagement was announced on 9 November 1984. The couple were married in Stockholm on 14 April 1985. Carl Gustaf and Theresa had four children: Ingrid, Carl Johan, Margaretha, and Amelie.\n\nCarl Gustaf was widowed in November 2019, after Theresa passed away due to breast cancer.\n\nResidences[]\n\nTitles and Honours[]\n\n1947-1950 Prince Carl Gustaf of Sweden\n\n1950-1965 Carl Gustaf, Crown Prince of Sweden\n\n1965-1974 Carl Gustaf, Crown Prince of Sweden, Duke of Jamtland\n\n1974-present Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden\n\nNational Honours[]\n\nOrder of the Seraphim (1965)\n\nOrder of the Sword (1974)\n\nOrder of the Polar Star (1974)\n\nOrder of Charles XIII (1974)\n\nOrder of Vasa (1965)\n\nForeign Honours[]\n\nOrder of the Garter (1983) (United Kingdom)\n\nRoyal Victorian Order (1985) (United Kingdom)\n\nAncestry[]\n\nParents Grandparents Great-Grandparents Great-Great-Grandparents Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Vasterbotten King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught\n\nKing Gustaf V of Sweden\n\nPrincess Victoria of Baden\n\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn\n\nPrincess Louise Margaret of Prussia\n\nKing Oscar II of Sweden\n\nPrincess Sophia of Nassau\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich I of Baden\n\nPrincess Louise of Prussia\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom\n\nPrince Frederick Charles of Prussia\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Anhalt-Dessau\n\nPrincess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Duke Charles Edward of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nPrincess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nPrince Leopold, Duke of Albany\n\nPrincess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n\nDuke Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nPrincess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom\n\nGeorg Victor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n\nPrincess Helena of Nassau\n\nDuke Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg\n\nPrincess Adelheid of Schaumburg-Lippe\n\nDuke Frederick VIII of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nPrincess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg\n\nLines of Succession[]"
