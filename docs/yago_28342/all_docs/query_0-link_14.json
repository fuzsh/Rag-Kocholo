But it didn't turn out that way, and Sweden had to wait until the next generation for a brittish princess to marry a swedish prince. Gustav's and Victoria's son Gustav (VI) Adolf first married Margareth of Connaught, who would become the grandmother of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Margarethe II of Denmark, and after her premature death, he married again, and this time, his bride was Louise Mountbatten, who didn't have any children, but eventually became the queen of Sweden. But back to Gustav and Victoria. Queen Sophia wanted her son to marry the brittish princess Beatrice, but finally, everything spoke in the favor of the german princess Victoria of Baden. Her mother was the daughter of the german emperor, and her father's mother was a swedish princess. We have no idea what a marriage between Gustav and Beatrice would have been like, but even if Gustav and Victoria kind of fell apart over the years, their marriage started as a happy one. Queen Sophia was however never pleased with Victoria and despised her daughter-in-law's love for militarism.\n\nHere are some pictures of Gustav and Victoria.\n\nhttp://img434.imageshack.us/img434/4373/4c7dd.jpg Gustav as a crown prince in 1899.\n\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/9182/4d3ue.jpg Victoria of Baden in her younger days.\n\nhttp://img128.imageshack.us/img128/6450/3030su.jpg King Gustav V in his older days.\n\nhttp://img128.imageshack.us/img128/6804/3044qt.jpg Queen Victoria in 1915.\n\nLast edited: Apr 5, 2006\n\nMAfan\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nSep 14, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n6,401\n\nCity\n\nN/A\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nhttp://i50.tinypic.com/ao5r8y.jpg\n\nI have found this picture, I think it portrays the Swedish Roya Family, during King Gustav V later years.
