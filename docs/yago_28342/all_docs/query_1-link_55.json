        "text": "I definitely loved this thread although I have some questions\n\n1- I think that Victoria and Christian could get married in 1891 - since he marrying 16 would be unlikely\n\n2- I would like to see Maud with a more important role in this scenario haha marrying Nicolas II in 1889\n\n3 - Victoria Melita could have married Haakon instead of maud - They could marry in 1894 - he could be chosen king of Norway before 1905, perhaps in 1893, which would motivate him to get married early\n\n4- Alberto of Belgium could form a beautiful couple with Margaret of Connaught - 1899\n\n5 - Alice could marry Maximilian of Baden - 1889\n\n6 - Beatriz Saxe Coburg could marry the prince heir of Wurttemberg (1878) in 1902\n\nSome marriages I had never thought of and even with different religions could be very pleasing as =\n\nLouise Wales - Carlos I of Portugal\n\nHelena Victoria - Victor Emanuel III - Maybe I would advance the marriage of Helena Victoria and Victor Emanuel to 1891\n\nMarie Louise - Frederick August III - They would certainly be a couple in love\n\nI definitely loved this thread although I have some questions\n\nThanks for the appreciation\n\n1- I think that Victoria and Christian could get married in 1891 - since he marrying 16 would be unlikely\n\nI was just showing the youngest so these two marrying later is fine.\n\n2- I would like to see Maud with a more important role in this scenario haha marrying Nicolas II in 1889\n\nThats fair enought, I only kept her with Harold as she quickly to adapt to her new country and duties as Queen Consort of Norway, as well as playing a strong and dominant role within the court and family.\n\n3 - Victoria Melita could have married Haakon instead of maud - They could marry in 1894 - he could be chosen king of Norway before 1905, perhaps in 1893, which would motivate him to get married early\n\nYer thats true.\n\n4- Alberto of Belgium could form a beautiful couple with Margaret of Connaught - 1899\n\nAgain this works\n\n5 - Alice could marry Maximilian of Baden - 1889\n\nI avoided Baden due to its lack of power not only one the world stage but even in the German sphere.\n\n6 - Beatriz Saxe Coburg could marry the prince heir of Wurttemberg (1878) in 1902\n\nPrince Heir is fine as well.\n\nSome marriages I had never thought of and even with different religions could be very pleasing as =\n\nLouise Wales - Carlos I of Portugal\n\nHelena Victoria - Victor Emanuel III - Maybe I would advance the marriage of Helena Victoria and Victor Emanuel to 1891\n\nMarie Louise - Frederick August III - They would certainly be a couple in love\n\nIt's not completely outragous of a British princess converting to Catholicism, as I stated that IOTL Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg did marry Catholic King Alfonso XIII of Spain as well as Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha marrying Infante Alfonso, Duke of Galliera."
