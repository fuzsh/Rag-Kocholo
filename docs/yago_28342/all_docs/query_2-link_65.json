        "meta_description": "After World War I had been raging for six months and the pressure to choose a side was mounting, the kings of Denmark, Norway and Sweden met to find a common position. On the surface, the meeting was a success - the three countries were united in their neutrality. But, behind the scenes there were bubbling tensions due to differing perspectives on Nordic cooperation and the wider geopolitics of Europe.",

        "text": "At the beginning of World War I, every belligerent country was pressuring the Nordic nations to choose a side. Sweden shared a border with Russia, and Denmark with Germany. The Nordic countries were also important trade intermediaries for German imports; buying goods from the Nordic countries allowed Germany to circumvent the blockade imposed by the United Kingdom and France. The German U-boat campaign against British ships also made the Oresund strait between Denmark and Sweden of great importance to both sides. This region was at the heart of the Northern front of the First World War.\n\nDespite their absence at the Three Kings Meeting, the influence of the Great Powers was strong. The British Foreign Secretary E. Grey explicitly asked the British journalists in Malmö to avoid making remarks that could offend the Scandinavians. The British Foreign Office was particularly concerned that its ally Norway would form stronger ties with Stockholm, which could lead to a lessening of the Norwegian’s pro-British foreign policy. The Central Powers were also not to be outdone: Kaiser Wilhelm II gave a message to the Swedish queen (who was visiting Berlin at exactly the same time as the Three Kings Meeting) to give to her husband, Gustaf V, in order to try to persuade him to join Germany’s side.\n\nWith each of the Scandinavian states facing such international pressure, this meeting was crucial. The three kings, national figures who could embody each nation on the international stage, held important symbolism, and the meeting was meant as a way of showing – loud and clear – each of the three countries’ solidarity in Nordic neutrality.\n\nThe Malmö meeting was the first time King Gustaf V of Sweden and his Norwegian counterpart met, and this was particularly significant as Norway had only become independent from Sweden 10 years before. In 1905, Norway unilaterally dissolved the personal union with Sweden which had begun in 1814, becoming fully independent after a referendum. Norway’s independence came about for many reasons, but one key disagreement with Sweden was its refusal to allow Norway’s previous king (Oscar II, 1829-1907) to represent Norway abroad autonomously. This meant that, in 1914, Sweden was mindful of the conciliation necessary with the Norwegian royal family.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries in the 1910s was not warm. The divorce between them just a few years before had marked the end of Sweden's self-conception as a political and military power in Europe, an understanding which went back to the 17th century. The Swedes’ pride had also been jilted by the 1905 separation and the two countries did not enter into a non-aggression pact until 8th August 1914, finally ending the Norwegian conception of Sweden as a potential enemy. For its part, the young Norway was seeking to impose itself on the Nordic stage.\n\nConsidering the global geopolitical context more important than national divisions, the Swedes initiated the Three Kings Meeting in order to extend the hand of friendship to Haakon VII. When the Norwegian king received the Swedish proposal, he immediately informed the British Foreign Office, expressing his doubts and fears about a multilateral meeting that could create more friction than traditional bilateral negotiations, a response which demonstrates the climate of distrust between the two Nordic powers at the time.\n\nBy organizing the meeting, Gustaf V intended to show the world that Sweden was a pillar of peace, neutrality and solidarity in the region. In making his counterparts come to him, he made Sweden the symbolic center of the region. Abandoning its idea of being a traditional, realist country after the dissolution of Sweden-Norway, the meeting was part of Stockholm’s realignment of its priorities to become a peaceful power.\n\nThe choice of location was also an attempt to be as neutral as possible. In order to circumvent a Norwegian refusal if the meeting was held in Stockholm (the former “imperial” capital), Gustaf V organized the meeting in Malmö, a smaller city near the Danish border. This was also of symbolic value to the Danes as the city was – and still is – influenced by Danish culture and history.\n\nThe way the meeting was organized was also intended to lower intra-regional tensions: all the events (patriotic songs, concerts, a church service etc) were to be perfectly balanced between the three countries to avoid hurting any national pride and to put the emphasis on common traits and factors of unity rather than on differences.\n\nIn Malmö, the three kings appeared together, united, to show that the divisions of the past were at an end and in order to solemnly unite for peace in the region. It was a ceremonial sublimation of the Nordic countries, of their fraternal and peaceful relations, aimed at a transnational Nordic audience.\n\nThe Three Kings Meeting definitely warded off World War I extending into the Nordic region to a greater extent than it did otherwise. It clearly presented a peaceful and neutral region - as well as one largely under the leadership of Sweden - to a Europe which was violent and chaotic. Gustaf V’s initiative was clearly an exercise in public relations. It was a way of promoting Swedish “soft power” and of getting the diplomatic leadership of the region back after decades of division.\n\nWhile the Malmö encounter can be said to be the first time Scandinavian neutrality was first truly asserted and became known on the world stage, this approach did not come out of nowhere. It emerged at the end of the 19th century in reaction to the russification of Finland and to the germanization of South Schleswig. Frightened by Russian and German aggression and aware of their limited capacity for resistance, the idea of neutrality developed favorably in the Nordic countries. It was not only seen as a legal right which every sovereign country had, but as a pragmatic response to the geopolitics of the time."
