        "text": "It is hard to imagine from a modern royal-watching standpoint the frame of mind that lead several countries at various times to say \"we don't have an obvious person to put on the throne, so let's pick someone from another nation to fill the position.\" Sweden did it twice, Greece did it when they established a monarchy, Russia did it at least once, I may be forgetting some other nation. I've never fully understood why Sweden didn't pick a Swede, Greece didn't pick someone Greek, etc. But hey, it clearly made sense to the people at the time.\n\nBut beyond Queen Victoria being everyone's great-whatever grandmother, the more I look into these things the more it feels like just about every royal line is overwhelmingly made up of Germans. It makes sense, though. There were so many small royal houses in what is now Germany that for several centuries the bulk of the marriageable princes and princess at any given time were probably Germanic.\n\nI know that for instace Romania chose a foreign prince so as not to upset the power balance between the often infighting Romanian princely houses. Thats also the reason behind the rule not to allow a member of the Royal house to marry a native.\n\nWhen Gustav VI was deposed a member of the House of Augustenborg was chosen and after his death many nobles favoured another Danish prince or even the Danish king himself to resurrect the old Kalmar union. Even though a big part of the population, the royal family included, wanted the former Crown prince Gustav to be reinstated in the succession this was vetoed by many nobles who feared that he would take his revenge on the men who had deposed his father. A funny fact is that after the death of said Prince Gustav of Vasa & his daughter, Queen Carola of Saxony, the next in line for the claim to the Swedish throne was his grand-nephew Grand Duke Frederick II of Baden. After his death in 1928 the claim devolved upon his sister Victoria, wife of King Gustav V of Sweden thus making the Bearnadottes the legitimate heirs to the House of Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nIt is hard to imagine from a modern royal-watching standpoint the frame of mind that lead several countries at various times to say \"we don't have an obvious person to put on the throne, so let's pick someone from another nation to fill the position.\" Sweden did it twice, Greece did it when they established a monarchy, Russia did it at least once, I may be forgetting some other nation. I've never fully understood why Sweden didn't pick a Swede, Greece didn't pick someone Greek, etc. But hey, it clearly made sense to the people at the time.\n\nBut beyond Queen Victoria being everyone's great-whatever grandmother, the more I look into these things the more it feels like just about every royal line is overwhelmingly made up of Germans. It makes sense, though. There were so many small royal houses in what is now Germany that for several centuries the bulk of the marriageable princes and princess at any given time were probably Germanic.\n\nThe Bourbons in Spain and the Hanoverians in Britain both came to the throne of their respective countries about 300 years ago or so, but, in both cases, it could at least be argued that they descended matrilineally from previous royal houses of the countries where they reigned, which is now not unlike the situation of the Bernadottes in Sweden.\n\nA more interesting case is actually that of Belgium, which \"imported\" a royal family from Germany in 1831 , and there was actually no infusion of so-called \"pure Belgian blood\" in that family AFAIK until Philippe married Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz and had four children with her. Nonetheless, we don't often hear criticism of the Belgian Coburgs for \"not being Belgian\". The deposed Greek royal family provides a similar example.\n\nThat's a strange thing to say in this day and age, IMO. If anything, I've found that Americans are much more likely to count themselves as still being Irish or German or whatnot based on ancestry (Irish-American, German-American, but you get what I'm saying), while Europeans look at us and say \"silly goose, doesn't matter that your great-grandfather was born and raised in Dublin, if you weren't born in Ireland you're not Irish-Anything.\" And if anything the history that we're talking about just illustrates that Europeans have long been willing to adopt someone from outside their own citizenry to be head of state, while we Americans live under a constitution that doesn't allow such a thing.\n\nMarco Rubio's parents were both born outside the United States. Nevertheless, no one questioned that Marco Rubio was American, and being first generation didn't prevent him from running for president. The fact that people use hyphenated words like Irish-American or Cuban-American doesn't mean that they don't see themselves or are seen as Americans , but rather that they consider themselves Americans who also value and honor the culture of their ancestors who came from other countries.\n\nAgain, I insist on my point on why I called this discussion \"silly\", if not plainly racist. The opening question in this thread was if the Swedish royal family had \"Swedish blood\". To an American, the answer is obviously yes, not because Victoria of Baden descended from some 18th century Swedish king (which is the answer the OP probably expected), but rather because Carl XVI Gustaf's father, grandfather, great-grandfather and so on so forth all the way up to Charles XV were all born and raised in Sweden, and were therefore Swedish. To Americans, nationality is not a matter of \"blood\" that requires your ancestry in the country to be traced back five hundred years (not least, because 500 years ago, no Europeans or Africans lived in the Americas anyway !). Instead, it is a matter of place of birth and place of upbringing.\n\nBTW, your point that , if one is not born in Dublin, he/she is not considered Irish may be true in Ireland (I don't know much about it), but it is certainly not true in other European countries. The Germans definitely considered ethnic Germans who were born and lived in the Czech Republic, or Poland, or Russia as \"Germans\", and actually that was one of the Nazi arguments for invading Eastern European countries. Even today, several European countries give out passports and citizenship to descendants of immigrants who left their country many generations ago, including members of my family, who have Italian citizenship even though only our great-grandfather was Italian.\n\nYou keep harping on what things mean \"to Americans.\" You do realize I'm American, right?\n\nMarco Rubio's parents were both born outside the United States. Nevertheless, no one questioned that Marco Rubio was American, and being first generation didn't prevent him from running for president.\n\nThat's about as far from the point as you can be. Rubio was born in the US. His parents are neither here nor there. I was comparing the US requirements to people who became heads of state despite never having even lived in the country in question, who were invited from afar in a request that boiled down to \"hey, will you please move here and become our king? We're not happy with the options we have in-house and you look like an alright guy. Thanks!\" IIRC, the first time Jean Bernadotte ever stepped on Swedish soil was when he moved there to take the throne (well, technically, to become their aging king's crown prince). He was invited by the Riksdag on the basis of his skill as a military leader and the kindness he'd shown to Swedish prisoners of war.\n\nI happen to find that fascinating, precisely because I'm American. Even if you moved here as a child and have been a citizen your entire adult life, you aren't eligible to run for President unless you were born here. A naturalized citizen can be a governor, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, did, but the highest office is off limits if you're foreign born. So yes, Marco Rubio could run for President, but his parents never had that option.\n\nYou find this silly. Fine. It's not for you.\n\nNo one is saying the Bernadottes are less than or don't have a right to the throne. It's just interesting to see that, even if you look at generation after generation after generation of monarchs in this dynastic house and their partners, this century was the first time that someone in line to their their throne chose a spouse from their own country. Especially given that they started with the importation of a foreigner to the throne.\n\nThat's noteworthy because the first however many generations of the house were living in an era when (a) royal marriages were first and foremost political, (b) monarchs still had a degree of power, and (c) politicians tended to have some concern that a monarch with strong familial or cultural ties to another country might offer an unwise level of favor that country of origin in international disputes. That concern wasn't helped by the very small amount of contact royals used to have with their nations' people. Given that context, it's remarkable to me that the Bernadottes never felt the need to shore up their \"Swedishness\" by, for instance, marrying off one of the first Bernadotte heirs to a princess from the prior ruling house.\n\nThis discussion has lead me to read up a little more on the family, so I now know that Jean Bernadotte himself made a choice that probably made a very big difference in how accepted his family was by the Swedish people: when he decided to accept the offer of the throne, Bernadotte went to Napoleon to offer his resignation and ask to be emancipated from his French citizenship. Napoleon tried to make him promise never to take up arms against France. But Bernadotte refused to make that pledge, saying quite firmly that he was obliged to consider the needs of Swedish ahead of his own Frenchness or ties to Napoleon.\n\nBringing him in had been a Riksdag plan; the king didn't much like it. But Bernadotte won him over after he arrived in Sweden. He seems to have worked pretty hard to earn his status as an adopted Swede. He was running everything even before the old king died, and he was popular. In other words, he really did do the work to become seen as Swedish.\n\nThe lack of Swedish-born brides in the family tree could have been a sign that generations of the Bernadotte house holed up in their palaces and didn't care to mix with people from their country. It's nice to see that, in this case, it was actually a matter of them not needing to make that kind of political statement with a marriage because the founder of their line did a good job of making the Bernadottes Swedish in ways that mattered to the nation's people and politicians.\n\nAnd that's why I like these conversations. Little questions like the one that started this send me off along rabbit trails of data, the details of which hint at a nation's political story and help me find interesting times in their history that are fun to learn about."
