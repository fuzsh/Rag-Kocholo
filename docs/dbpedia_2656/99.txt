Edward Garnier QC, MP, is the Solicitor General for England and Wales. He prosecuted the first juror to be found guilty of contempt of court for communicating via Facebook with a defendant in a criminal trial.

As a barrister in private practice at 1 Brick Court, he specialised in defamation and media law. He acted for former MP and minister Edwina Currie, who recovered substantial damages for the suggestion that she was as unpopular as a member of a Serbian death squad; and for The Daily Mail in the longest ever civil jury trial – six months and over 100 witnesses – in its successful defence of the Moonies’ libel claim.
