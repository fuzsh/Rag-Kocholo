        "text": "The Queen has been pleased to approve that the honour of Knighthood will be conferred upon Edward Garnier QC MP.\n\nThe Prime Minister requested the honour be granted following the recent government reshuffle, in recognition of Edward Garnier’s longstanding public service to the country.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nKnight Bachelor\n\nA knighthood rewards a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity usually, but not exclusively, at a national level, or in a capacity which is recognised by peer groups as inspirational and nationally significant, and which demonstrates sustained commitment.\n\nA Knight Bachelor is an appointment, not a membership of an Order of Chivalry. Recipients can adopt the title “Sir” and there are no post nominal letters associated with the award.\n\nEdward Garnier QC MP\n\nFollowing a successful legal career which saw Edward Garnier called to the Bar (Middle Temple) in 1976, he entered Parliament at the 1992 General Election as the Member for Harborough, a seat he has represented since.\n\nThroughout the Major Government, Edward held a number of junior Ministerial posts. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Alastair Goodlad and David Davis as Ministers of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office 1994-1995; and Sir Nicholas Lyell as Attorney-General and Sir Derek Spencer as Solicitor-General 1995-1997. In 1995 he was awarded Queen’s Counsel.\n\nIn Opposition, Edward used his considerable legal experience in a number of senior Shadow Ministerial posts between 1997 and 2010. He was Shadow Minister Lord Chancellor’s Department 1997-1999; Shadow Attorney-General 1999-2001; Shadow Minister for Home Affairs 2005-2007; Shadow Minister for Justice 2007-2009; and Shadow Attorney-General 2009-2010.\n\nIn May 2010, Edward was appointed Solicitor-General, a position he held until September 2012."
