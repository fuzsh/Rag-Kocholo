The beauty giant has unveiled its new slogan, ‘By Garnier, Naturally’, to highlight its commitment to doubling down on environmental issues. The L’Oréal USA-owned brand has also promised that by the end of 2019, all shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner bottles from its top-selling hair care range, ‘Fructis Sleek & Shine’, will be made from 100% post-consumer recycled waste. Fructis hair care products are currently produced in a zero-waste facility and use packaging containing 50% post-consumer recycled waste.\n\n\"Garnier’s mission is to develop beauty products that are both good for you and good for the planet,\" said Anncy Rowe, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Garnier, in a statement. \"The announcement of our new signature, 100% PCR initiative for Fructis Sleek & Shine and the Greenhouse Tour serves as a commitment to our customers that we continue to aspire to bring the highest quality, most efficacious naturally-inspired formulas in the most sustainable quality packaging to the masses at a price point that’s attainable.\"\n\nThe ‘Greenhouse Tour’ refers to an educational roadtrip the company is undertaking throughout the US, which will kick off on March 17 in Miami and end on April 22 in New York. The tour, which will call in to retail locations in 22 cities, will allow audiences to discover the world of ‘By Garnier, Naturally’ via product and recycling demonstrations and interactive experiences. It will also highlight the brand’s long-standing partnership with waste management company TerraCycle, and let visitors recycle their beauty empties on site.\n\nGarnier and TerraCycle have been working together since 2011 to raise awareness of the importance of responsible recycling, but the beauty giant has noticeably ramped up its efforts to improve its eco-friendly credibility across the board recently. Since the start of this year, the French division of the brand has launched a new ‘Garnier Bio’ organic skincare line in France, and teamed up with the ecological NGO Fondation GoodPlanet to work with French farmers on developing agroforestry in tandem with the French Agroforestry Association."
