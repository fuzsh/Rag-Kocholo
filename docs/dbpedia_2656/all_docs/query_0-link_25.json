        "text": "There was that and Para One was also making solo stuff that... it was before he was making 4/4 stuff. He was just experimenting with rap and instrumental, weird club music. We were coming out of our IDM phase and were like, âOKâ¦ This is music people are going to dance to,â but we had no idea how to make dance music. It still sounded really weird and really bizarre and we didnât know how to make pure dance music or house music or electro music. We were just... it was clubby in our head, but it really sounded weird. This is a track by Para One called âNobody Cares,â from his first EP on Institubes, which is the second release on Institubes.\n\n(music: Para One â âNobody Caresâ)\n\nThere was a bunch of French people making that, mostly from our entourage. We felt like Diplo and the early Hollertronix stuff that was going on in the States was a sort of... had affiliation with that. We felt like Modeselektor were like the German version of that. There was a lot of people all over Europeâ¦ the Radioclit guys in Scandinavia and the UK were sort of like-minded. We all loved the first grime records. We saw grime as Ludacris and gabba put together. For us, it was really exciting. âItâs OK to listen to Lil Jon now, itâs OK to mix that with electronic influences, itâs OK to dance to it even though we didnât have a clue what dance music really was.â It was just an exciting time where everyone was experimenting and not really knowing what they were doing and Feadz was playing an Ellen Allien song mixed with a Noreaga song and it totally made sense. Orgasmic was also playing Missy songs into Dopplereffekt and it totally made sense. We loved it. We thought this could have maybe given birth to a movement. For a second, one of the Radioclit guys... I donât know if youâre familiar with Radioclit. They were... one of them was from Sweden and heâs called Johan and he now has the group the Very Best. The other one was Ãtienne, DJ Tron, who was French. They were based in the UK. It was a very multicultural group. They had the idea to market this whole scene as [Euro-crunk and they had a connection in the hip-hop magazine... in the UK hip-hop magazine... called, I think, Hip-Hop Connection, if Iâm not mistaken. They had a big article called âEuro-crunk is coming,â with all the artists showcased but it was more of a joke. The name is silly and the name really never caught on.\n\nBasically what happened was around the same time Justice were putting out their first records and Vitalic was really big and 2ManyDJs were starting to be interested in the whole French scene and they were playing the Justice record, âWe Are Your Friends,â all over the place. This became super popular. All these French producers started to think to themselves, âWell, maybe if we do 4/4 music and make it sound like bangers, weâre going to be more popular and weâre going to get some bookings outside of France.â\n\nThat scene sort of cannibalized all the experimenting that was going on and a lot of people just started doing 4/4 stuff. Some of them still kept the spirit and people, like Surkin and Bobmo, these guys sort of retained some of the spirit from those early-2000s days when we didnât know what we were doing. But still, no one was doing half-time stuff anymore because it was considered electronic rap, which was becoming a little bit of a dirty word and a nerdy thing that wasnât cool anymore. We sort of abandoned this, and scenes like... the beat scene sort of took over and occupied that space. I feel like a lot of stuff coming out of Montreal too, sort of took that space. It was really a pity, because we were in the center of it and we sort of abandoned it in order to make big bangers. Iâm always a little bit sad when I think of this.\n\nVivian Host\n\nI want to show video number, which is TTC âTelephone,â just to give people an idea of what you guys looked like when you came out and what you were doing.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nThis is not when we came out, though. This is like 2006.\n\nVivian Host\n\nIn the middle. Mid-career.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nLast album. Telephone was from our third and last album.\n\nVivian Host\n\nLet me about the making of this video that weâre going to watch.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nItâs just like a... thereâs nothing really to sayâ¦\n\nVivian Host\n\nYou guys got video number one back there? Anyone? Bueller?\n\n[Video is played]\n\nSpeaker: Teki Latex\n\nJust basically like very Baltimore-influenced. The beat is produced by Orgasmic, the guy with long hair in the video, who has since cut his hair. Yeah, it was just a fun track. Very gimmicky. We were thinking, âHow can we control the world and how can we become the biggest thing in the world? Oh, we should make a song about phones because everyone has a ringtone now and itâs a thing. So, we were going to make a song about that and maybe everyoneâs going to use it as a ringtone and it happened a little bit.â We were just trying to go pop and trying to do it in a fun way and trying to make a fun song and wear bright colors and just be cool.\n\nVivian Host\n\nI think you achieved that.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nSort of. Yeah, a little bit.\n\nVivian Host\n\nWell, I wanted to play this, too, even though it might not be your favorite because you guys became really big in France, and now when you walk down the street a lot of people are stopping you.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah. This was super big in Montreal, this song. A lot of people were stopping us on the street because of this song, and doing the dance that I do at the end of the video, which we wonât show.\n\nVivian Host\n\nWeâre all going to learn it later.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, so a lot of people liked it. I donât think itâs the best TTC song, but itâs a good one. Itâs a good little pop number. It has the disposable quality of a good song.\n\nVivian Host\n\nWhile you were in the middle of doing TTC and releasing records, you also started a label called Institubes.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nVivian Host\n\nYou actually started that to put out a rap record.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. It was like a rap super group of like indie rap. French indie rap kids called L'Atelier. We had nowhere to put it out, so we decided to make our own label. Soon after we wanted it to be a more dance-oriented label. But, then again, it was still our version of dance music which was a little bit warped and weird and so the first Para One EP came out on Institubes and the first Tacteel stuff too. A lot of that stuff sounds like... can I play a Tacteel song?\n\nVivian Host\n\nSure.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nHereâs a Tacteel song that sounds like a Kanye beat from 2015, except it came out in 2004.\n\n(music: Tacteel â unknown)\n\nThis is what we were putting out, basically, at the beginning of Institubes.\n\nVivian Host\n\nWho all was involved in that label with you?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nIt was me and a bunch of really fun intellectuals. Jean-RenÃ© Ãtienne, whoâs a big mastermind and very important figure for me. He really made us discover a whole world of music. Him and Ãtienne Menu, who was also a journalist, who has impeccable taste and a real vision in music. There was many other people involved but the originators were Tacteel, me, Jean-RenÃ©, Ãtienne, and a guy called Olivier who then left. It was just some... a crew of people who were... a lot of them were very... they had done really big studies in political science and they were applying the same kind of nerdism that they applied to their studies, to music. They were listening to Autechre and Boards Of Canada and all that kind of stuff and making the rap kids in my entourage listen to that stuff very early on. They were very defining for our musical tastes.\n\nVivian Host\n\nOne of the things that was so notable for me seeing Institubes in the States, which was a huge electro-house label alongside Ed Banger... you guys were like the biggest thing for us, and the branding and all the ideas around not just that you guys were a supergroup, but also the label looked impeccable and the logos and the sleeves and you had scarves and everything was so perfectly done. You basically made a whole world that you could tap into.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, thank you. That was important for us to have coherence in what we did and to tie the visual aspect with the music as well, but I think every label is like that. We didnât invent that kind of stuff. Obviously Mo' Wax and people like that paved the way. Ninja Tune, Warp paved the way for that kind of aesthetic and tying the design with the music.\n\nVivian Host\n\nDuring that time you were also hanging out a lot at a club called Paris Paris.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah. I just wrote an article about it for RBMA. Yeah, it was an important club for us. It was a small club in Paris, where we used to hang out and it was a very hedonistic place, where anything could happen. Some very dirty things happened. We were just living the life. TTC was very popular at the time. Institubes kind of had its place and Ed Banger were, of course, blowing up. We were flossing and the pace to floss was Paris Paris.\n\nVivian Host\n\nDo you have video number six that we could show please? If we can show this video, this is a video of an iPod battle that you were creating. The reason that I picked this is just to show... it shows DJ Mehdi in the video and also So-Me, whoâs the graphic designer for Ed Banger. I donât know who else is in it.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nProbably the Justice guys. Emil from Sound Pellegrino, Tacteel, a bunch of journalists. Hip people from the mid-2000s. We were doing this iPod battle thing that started as a rock-versus-rap thing and then it was just anything goes. It was kind of like our dandy French version of a soundclash. Each one plays a song... each team plays a song and at the end of the day we measure the applause and whoever gets the more applause wins.\n\nVivian Host\n\nOK. We can roll it.\n\n[Video plays]\n\nSpeaker: Teki Latex\n\nYeah, a lot of fist pumping and just like us being bros. That was, again, it might sound wack but it was dope at the time.\n\nVivian Host\n\nFor sure. I want to move on from that, but first I was hoping we could drop a couple tracks from Institubes just to get the flavor of what you were putting out.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nAre you going to select them?\n\nVivian Host\n\nYeah, Iâm going to select them. This is just a sample of a couple things. First one is Surkin, âGhetto Obsession,â 2006.\n\n(music: Lio & Teki Latex â âLes Matins De Parisâ)\n\nTeki Latex\n\nItâs still a great song. Itâs still a perfect pop song and it was on the radio and I achieved what I wanted to do with it and, basically, I still love it. This happened in 2008. I was very busy with this stuff and also very busy touring with TTC so I was a little bit less involved in Institubes at the time and Institubes had been taken over by other members of the crew. They were doing a great job with it but they took it in a different sort of direction. After a while, Orgasmic... it was mainly Orgasmic... I was, of course... because he is one of my best friends, I sort of followed his lead into playing a little bit more house-music-influenced stuff and a little bit more club-music-influenced stuff.\n\nBasically, what everybody was doing at that time as far club music goes in Paris was big, distorted bangers. Big bro stuff that... and it had a metal aesthetic almost. Everyone was wearing leather jackets and being like rock and being like âYeah, lets rock this.â Very bro-ey and nobody danced anymore. The clubs were just a bunch of kids wearing loud colors or like heavy metal jackets going like this, you know? Fist pumping, and it felt like concerts more than dancefloors.\n\nWe wanted to go back to the DJ and the dancing element of it and we were influenced by other stuff, different stuff from what was popular at the time in Paris and we... Institubes had gone a different way and Institubes was releasing stuff by Midnight Juggernauts, Chateau Marmont, which was more like â70s-pop-oriented. We had Crystal. Unfortunately Ryota [Miyake] from Crystal was going to be in the second term of the academy but he didnât come. We had some really strong, more like home-listening stuff going on on Institubes, and I wanted to bring it back to the clubs. Me and Orgasmic wanted to have an outlet where we could just release the club music that we loved and pump out club hits every month and not have to worry about waiting and oh no, this guy need to put out an album, so we have to wait. We needed to create something different from Institubes so we created Sound Pellegrino, which started as an offshoot of Institubes and was digital only so we didnât have to wait all this time for vinyls to be made. We could just pump out records every month. It was very liberating for us to have Sound Pellegrino. That was in 2009, when it started.\n\nVivian Host\n\nYou also have a DJ team with Orgasmic.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, thatâs when I started DJing, actually. After the pop stuff... when the pop stuff happened, I wanted it to be larger than life. The single was big, but the album was never big. We didnât have... soon after I got dropped from EMI, so we didnât have the budgets to go on tour with a full band and give life to this pop music that I had in mind, in a live form, in a concert form.\n\nI was still being asked to perform so I started doing DJ sets and I wasnât a DJ, so I was terrible at first. But then I started thinking, âYou know what? I want to do this seriously because I love DJ culture and I love... Iâve been hanging out with people like Feadz and Orgasmic and DJ Fab and all of these guys all of my life. I want to take this seriously, out of respect for all of these people who have paved the way.â\n\nI was fascinated by the fact of taking two tracks and putting them together and creating a third track with them. I was just genuinely fascinated by that. I decided to take DJing seriously. We started performing together with Orgasmic as some sort of window for the label, under the name Sound Pellegrino Thermal Team and we made tracks as well.\n\nVivian Host\n\nDid you bring some tracks with you from Sound Pellegrino that you wanted to play?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nI donât think I have them on this key.\n\nVivian Host\n\nI got a few. What... you mentioned what sort of the driving quote of Institubes was. Do you have a similar thing for Sound Pellegrino? Like a banner?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nItâs not a punchline but it was basically going back to more like minimalist tracks and going back to dance music as a form of music, where... well, basically, a form of music you can dance to. You can... the fact that... influenced by labels like Dance Mania, but even like dance labels like Dirtybird that were just putting out a lot of records all the time and it doesnât matter if all of them... if some of them are a little bit disposable, as long as you can keep putting them out and giving an identity to the label and feeding the DJs with music, basically. You wanted to feed the DJs with music with Sound Pellegrino.\n\nVivian Host\n\nYou have some releases that are kind of just club tools.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, exactly, and itâs not a problem. We love that. Itâs part of our aesthetic.\n\nVivian Host\n\nEven though you have people all over the world releasing on Sound Pellegrino, there is quite a few French artists, Parisian artists as well.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.\n\nVivian Host\n\nCan you name some of them?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nWell, right now thereâs Coyote whoâs French DJ who actually... heâs actually one of the people who made ghettotech and juke a big thing in France at some point. He was silent for a while and then he released three EPs on Mixpak. We were always supporting it, and now heâs releasing on Sound Pellegrino. Thereâs a new kid called Doline, who makes sort of weird trance-based music. Very elegant and very pure and not at all like EDM-sounding, but rather more like ambient sounding actually, but still with a beat and still with some drums. Itâs sort of hard to describe but heâs making a very unique sound and he love him very much. There was Douster, whoâs actually from Lyon, who released the second Sound Pellegrino record and whoâs still around and who has a track with Feadz on our next compilation. Even though heâs not on the roster officially heâs still making stuff with us. Thereâs a lot of people... and also people from the UK who we did records with L-Vis 1990 early on in his career. We had Tom Trago and Bok Bok together on a release. We had Surkin and Todd Edwards together on a release. We had people like Teeth from Finland. Aero Manyelo from South Africa. Harvard Bass from the states. Who else? A lot of different people from different places in the world.\n\nVivian Host\n\nRather than playing that, I actually want to play a bit of this mixtape that you did called Deconstructed Trance. I think one of the things that youâre doing at the moment is really looking for new frontiers in club music, whether that be through Sound Pellegrino, especially your compilations, or of mixtapes and DJ sets that youâre doing.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nLike I said, Iâm fascinated by the sort of construction element of DJing and of dance music and the fact that itâs like Lego. You take different elements and put them together to create something new. That very... itâs a very important thing for me. Thatâs how I channel my creation now. Now that I donât make my own music anymore and now that I donât make vocals anymore, because I stopped that a little while ago and I sort of ran out of ideas in that area a little while ago, and now Iâm just channeling it through DJing 100%. I donât want to just be a selector. I really want to create something original with my mixes and do something a little bit... itâs a dirty word but a little bit conceptual. Well, at least, yeah, channel my creation through things like that.\n\nI made a mix. Itâs actually called Deconstructed Trance Reconstructed. I came across the music of Lorenzo Senni who makes... heâs an Italian produce who makes drumless trance. I saw him live at the Macba in Barcellona. Blew my mind. Itâs just him playing these beautiful arpeggios without drums and thereâs a big laser... thereâs a laser being coordinated with the music and itâs really, really beautiful. I really like him. Impressed me a lot. I love his music and inspired by what he made. I sort of started sticking beats on top of his music from other genres from techno to grime to just like club music in general.\n\nI started... I was always fascinated by the idea of drum tools. When you play a lot of drum tools, it get a little bit boring and thereâs... when thereâs no melody whatsoever in your DJ sets, you kind of look for things to make your music a little bit more lighthearted and a little bit more colorful. These trance beats without drums were a way for me to include more melody in my sets while keeping that sort of construction game aspect of it. I started looking for trance buildups from original trance songs and looping them. I made that mix with three CDJs. Itâs all made live. Iâm really proud of it. Part of it is drumless tracks, like ambient tracks. Tracks by... thereâs a track by, I think, Pearson Sound thatâs just like a drumless melody track.\n\nThereâs a bunch of tracks from grime guys like Slackk and stuff like that. I made the connection between that, the trance thing, classic trance tracks, and also... you can buy trance tools on certain digital platforms. Itâs like separate tracks from... itâs like CDs with... they used to have CDâs with just the drums and just the trance beats and stuff like that. I started digging in that kind of stuff and picked up my favorite stuff from that and put that all together over techno beats and grime beats and the result is this.\n\n(music: Teki Latex â Deconstructed Trance Reconstructed)\n\nVivian Host\n\nThat was Teki Latex, Deconstructed Trance Reconstructed. Right now, moving into the future, youâre actually in search of new forms of club music, or specifically French club.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nWell, I tried to bring together some young French producers who are influenced by bass music and the kind of stuff that I like and try to find out with them why there has been no typical French club music in a while. The last time we tried to have our own French identity in club music was the French touch stuff. Itâs a very... the French touch thing is a kind of a middle-class thing. There was never... it was kind of a bourgeois thing. It was a thing that... made by people from Versailles who... it was basically very pop also except for some nervous exceptions that we heard a little bit earlier on. It was a very clean and radio-friendly thing.\n\nThere hasnât been pure club music from the hood or from young people who... like underground people. There hasnât been stuff like that in a while whereas in the UK, there is the whole genealogy of soundsystem music that evolved into drum & bass, and grime, and dubstep and all that stuff. These are very specific and local English styles that influenced the whole world.\n\nPeople from France are going to look for these artists and book them in France because they want to hear that sound. Same thing for the kuduro stuff with Angola and Portugal. Same thing for the Baltimore stuff, the Jersey stuff, the South African stuff. All these places have... out of the struggle and the local way of consuming music were born all these styles that are very specific and why donât we have that in France? Why is French club music nowadays sort of very influenced by stuff that comes from all over the place, but doesnât really have an identity. Itâs always someone trying to make grime or someone trying to make techno or someone trying to make this or that but thereâs no... thereâs very little specific Frenchness to these styles.\n\nThereâs exceptions, of course, and in the techno world itâs a little bit more complicated because techno really doesnât have a specific sound connected to a country, but thereâs no equivalent to kuduro in Paris. Thereâs not equivalent to grime in Paris. Thereâs no equivalent to kwaito or gqom in Paris.\n\nI put together a team of French kids to try and find out why and maybe explore what could be done to change that and if it needs to exist or if itâs just something that exists by itself and that comes together because of non-music-related reasons. Thereâs a lot of questions to be asked and I think itâs important to think about those things.\n\nRight now, techno is omnipresent in France and thereâs a lot of... techno is everywhere in Paris. Thereâs a lot of big festival and big parties and stuff like that, but itâs a very... I find that the French club identity is... thereâs a lot of Paris trying to be Berlin. I think itâs a shame that we donât have our own thing. As far as producers go, itâs always like that; trying to emulate sounds coming from other cities, rather than creating our own. Iâm trying to think of a way to do that. Itâs an ongoing reflection.\n\nVivian Host\n\nAmazing. Well Teki, thank you so much.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nThank you.\n\nVivian Host\n\nWeâre going to take questions right now, if anyone has any questions.\n\nAudience member\n\nHi.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nHi.\n\nAudience member\n\nYou said you are looking at how a city develops its own sound, right? Has there been any epiphanies that youâve had so far in your thought processes towards that in your conversations with other artists?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nNot really. I mean, aside from the obvious, the fact that people make music to forget about the reality and try to escape the problems they have in their ongoing lives, aside from that, aside from what we all knowâ¦ we havenât had the real answer except that maybe France is, like I said, very... the culture in France goes through channels that are more literary than body-centered.\n\nThereâs not... dancing is looked down upon. Dance culture is always attached to cheesy electro house or David Guetta and stuff like that and people donât take you seriously when you tell them that youâre a DJ or that you go to... going to clubs is always like... thatâs not a real cultural activity. You have to go to museums and you have to read books.\n\nEvery rapper that... in order for a rapper to really blow up in France, it goes through emulating poets or being compared to poets. Even the most hardcore French rapper, when heâll have an article in mainstream magazine, heâll be compared to CÃ©line or heâll be compared to a French writer and even though he has never read that guy, even though heâs just making his own thing, which is rap, heâs always going to be compared to that sort of literal heritage. Literary... excuse meâ¦ heritage. There was... I think what happened is that we never had pirate stations in France. We had underground radios, but we never had a real pirate station culture like they had in the UK. We... dance culture was always looked down upon, and itâs changing now with the new generations and with the internet, but there was always... underground music... we didnât need to have our own genre of underground music, because rap was so big. Mainly because of that radio thing were we had to have lyrics in French, so for something to blow up, it had to have lyrics in French.\n\nPeople from the projects and people from the hood didnât feel the need to create their own style of dance music, because they had rap and they could be really successful with it. They could make real money out of it. Why invent something else, you know? I think thatâs one of the reasons but thereâs no epiphany of how weâre going to create our own thing yet.\n\nAudience member\n\nFor the dance music side, Iâm guessing that French people, from what you said, would be more accepting of more sophisticated forms of dance music?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nOf course thereâs a real romantic and intellectual way of making dance music in France. Itâs a good thing, too.\n\nAudience member\n\nOK, yeah. Thank you.\n\nVivian Host\n\nAnyone else?\n\nAudience member\n\nIt was interesting watching you talk about other peopleâs music and get really into it and vibing on it. Then, when you were playing your own music, you seemed to be quite self-critical. Do you find that thatâs an obstacle when youâre creating? I know that lots of people have that problem, getting too precious almost.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, itâs an obstacle to the point where I stopped doing it.\n\nAudience member\n\nYeah, OK.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nI mean, Iâm critical in general, and for... I mean, because Iâm passionate about music and I played a lot of music I really love from the bottom of my heart, but thereâs a lot of music I hate with the same passion. Part of it is my own music. Thatâs how it is when you become an old person like me, and youâve lived through a lot of different phases, and a lot of different trends in music. You start to become very critical of it in general.\n\nLike I always say, some of it sounds bad but it sounded great at the time. It has its own importance in a way and thatâs how you evolve and yeah, but in my mind Iâm still... when I do a mixtape like the one that we just heard, the Deconstructed Trance Reconstructed one, I still feel like in a way, thatâs kind of production in a way. Even though Iâm just playing with other peopleâs music, itâs... thereâs a real sense of trying to make something new with it.\n\nAudience member\n\nOK.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nI do it and I love it and I think thereâs so much stuff out there that pleases me. When I started making rap it was also out of not being happy with the French rap that was out at the time, and so trying to create my own version of it because there was nothing that I could relate to. I mean, so little things that I could relate to in French rap. Now, I guess that thereâs enough dance music for me to be happy so Iâm just going to play it instead of making it.\n\nAudience member\n\nCool. Thank you.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nI think itâs also important to differentiate the work of a DJ and the work of a producer. I think there can be great DJs who donât produce music. Itâs not because youâre a producer that you have to feel the need to force yourself to become a DJ and do it badly. Iâd rather listen to a good DJ who doesnât make his own music play other peopleâs music in a great way. Itâs two different jobs and some people have trouble making that difference.\n\nAlso, thereâs a lot of pressure on producers to perform in front of a live audience, and sometimes itâs not easy to make an electronic live show and to sell a lot of tickets by doing that, so a lot of producers are tempted to just go and DJ and they donât do it seriously and they just do it to make an easy buck and keep... be able to keep creating music in the studio. I think these are two different things, you know?\n\nAlso, a lot of DJs think that theyâre not going to have bookings if they donât produce so they hire a ghost producer or they just make shitty music and stuff like that, where theyâre just really good DJs and should stick to making this. But in the mind of people, these two things come together whereas I think they should really be separated.\n\nAudience member\n\nAbout this moment that you were really interested in pop music, where does that come from? Is that part of your wish to forward, or advance French music and... what was your motive? It seems very contradictory at the same time.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I know, but it makes sense to me. For me, when I played those songs early on in the lecture that are super-big pop songs, this is what I got into music... this is what I listened to before I made music, so itâs part of my DNA, and I wanted to recreate that. These are still forward-thinking songs.\n\nI had the illusion... that was 2008 so you have to put yourself back in the context of there was no Pussy Cat Dolls and no EDM and no... the pop music that was coming out at the time was still kind of forward-thinking. It was OutKast, it was Justin Timberlake produced by Timbaland, it was Gwen Stefani who was also making sort of â80s-influenced music but it was still the Neptunes behind it and Timbaland behind it so it was still sort of cool and new and futuristic and there was real excitement behind it. There was the Knife as well in all the European, like Scandinavian pop people who... again, EDM didnât exist yet so it was still a little bit experimental and not big and loud and... I mean, not cheesy. I donât know. It was cheesy but thereâs a difference between â80s pop cheesy and EDM cheesy.\n\nI think that difference is the emo aspect of it where â80s pop is pure and based on pure feelings, and romantic feelings, and EDM cheesiness is based on, âLook at me! I have emotions. Look at me! Iâm emo.â That kind of stuff makes the difference, and I donât like emo stuff. So yeah, I was influenced by that when I made this album and I wanted to live that fantasy and I wanted to be like a big fat bald Gwen Stefani. Punchline.\n\nAudience member\n\nDo you think itâs still possible? Sorry, one more question. Do you think itâs still possible or do you think the world is... do you think that phase is over?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nItâs hard to say. Itâs hard to say. I want to believe itâs still possible but I donât think I have it in me to make it possibleâ¦ anymore.\n\nAudience member\n\nThanks for doing this, first of all.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience member\n\nItâs very interesting. How do you see the current French rap thatâs maybe more popular right now with the young audience, like maybe more street-oriented stuff like Kaaris or Gradur? How do you see them fit into the narrative for what you were just talking about? Is there any sort of connection? Because from the outside perspective it really feels like this lives in a silo, and it doesnât really cross over with any of the things that you and your friends will do.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nWell, what they do is great and some of it really has a French identity to it, I think. For example, stuff like PNL really has a French identity to it, but it reflects a state of mind that I donât really... that I canât get into because, I donât know, I sort of gave up on it for some reason. I donât know. It sounds like... the stuff like Gradur and... well, the contemporary French stuff is just a reflection of the US stuff, which has become slower and more wavy and a little bit more emo as well.\n\nI canât really connect with it anymore, and I think that itâs a reflection of our times. The last wave of rap I was really into was the mid-2000 stuff. The crunk stuff and the Diplomats stuff and people had big outfits, and it was larger than life and everything looked like a Hollywood movie and it was over the top and Camâron was wearing pink and he didnât give a shit and he was just being very extravagant, and there was a lot of positivity to be taken from that and a lot of bragging, and thatâs what I loved about it; the cartoonish aspect of it without being silly and without being goofy.\n\nThey were really serious about their stuff and it was talking about real subject and real hood stuff, but it was done... he was referencing The Goonies and he didnât give a shit. It was just fun stuff. He was very... all of these guys were really flamboyant and stuff like that, whereas... and since then there was the recession, and now people have a little bit more of a sad approach to rap and I canât really relate to that.\n\nIt doesnât mean that Iâm not aware of the world we live in and the financial situation that we live in, but I just donât want to hear that in entertainment. I want to escape from it. I want to hear boasting, colorful stuff when I listen to music. I want to escape from my everyday life, so I donât want rappers to talk about stuff that makes me depressed.\n\nAudience member\n\nThank you.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience member\n\nHello Teki.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nHey.\n\nAudience member\n\nThanks for doing that. I was just thinking about what you said regarding incorporating grime or drum and bass into rap music or club music and in other time and then feeling futuristic about it. In with regards to what you said about your quest of creating a new type of French identity in club music and finding it, is that possible to create something like that, without traces of the past, do you think?\n\nTeki Latex\n\nIt has to be subconscious, you know? It has to be basically something that comes out naturally, instead of sticking a drum & bass beat on top of a rap song in 2001, you know? Or rapping over techno beats or whatever. It has to be something thatâs in our DNA, because we grew up listening to it and it comes out naturally in the music we make, but itâs a hard thing. This is why itâs an ongoing process.\n\nI havenât found the right way to do it yet. Weâre trying to also analyze what makes... whatâs the specificity of French music and what do we love about the French touch or the French pop, or African-influenced French stuff that came out in our childhood and trying to take the best elements of that and make something new out of it. Itâs all about making something new out of it and not just rapping over drum & bass.\n\nAudience member\n\nThanks.\n\nVivian Host\n\nAnyone else? All right. Well, then I guess weâll go eat dinner. Teki, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nDinner already?\n\nVivian Host\n\nI think itâs time for dinner.\n\nTeki Latex\n\nThank you so much."
