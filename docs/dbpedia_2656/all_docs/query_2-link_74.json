Damages have been agreed.\n\nWhat were the main challenges and possible implications? The legal principles to be applied to the tweet were neither in doubt nor at issue between the parties. The difficulty lay in applying them to the facts and persuading the judge that although the tweet might look harmless it most certainly was not. If this case reminds people that tweets can cause serious harm, so much the better."
