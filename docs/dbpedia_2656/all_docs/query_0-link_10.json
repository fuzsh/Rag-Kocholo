        "text": "When you're out at a trade show and there are promotional, branded merchandise available, do you think about the sustainability of the product before you decide whether or not to pick it up? The reason I ask is that we're seeing more sustainable merchandise products become widely available, which may be driven by the corporate customer initially. But if we as delegates at these events made more conscious decisions to only take sustainable items, it could encourage suppliers to create even more sustainable alternatives. The ones I’ve spotted more recently which I think are great are items made out of cork (really lightweight and durable) and moulded pulp packaging (which takes me back to the start of my career in the pulp and paper industry!) Do share any great examples of sustainable merchandise you've seen - it's always useful to share ideas. #OutsourcedMarketing #Sustainability #Merchandise\n\n🛍 𝙀𝙘𝙤-𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙘𝙞𝙤𝙪𝙨 𝙍𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡: 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙫𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝘽𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝘾𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢 𝙋𝙖𝙥𝙚𝙧 𝙎𝙝𝙤𝙥𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘽𝙖𝙜𝙨 In the world of retail, the customer experience is paramount.

They're biodegradable, recyclable, and often reusable. • 𝐃𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Kraft paper, a popular choice for shopping bags, is surprisingly strong. It can handle heavier items than you might expect, ensuring your customers' purchases arrive home safely. • 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫: A custom-printed paper bag is a walking billboard for your brand. It extends your marketing reach beyond the store, catching eyes and sparking conversations. • 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐋𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲: Studies show that customers are more likely to return to stores that offer eco-friendly packaging options.

Last night, I was super excited to open a package with an absolute SCORE of a find from a major resale site. While the product was as excellent as I'd hoped (a $1000 wool coat for $150 that fit like 💫 ), I was super disappointed to find that it was wrapped in loads of plastic, and on a completely unnecessary plastic hanger. 🤯 Why? Aren't we shopping resale because we want to shop better? 🌏 Let's face it, traditional packaging with its non-recyclable plastics and paper overuse is a no-go. Forward-thinking brands (like many of my clients 😎) are turning packaging into a sustainability initiative. Here's Why It Matters: → First Impressions Count: Your packaging is your brand's hello. Make it count with materials and designs that show you care about the planet. → Stand Out: Innovative packaging isn't just good for the earth; it makes your brand pop in a crowded market. → Spread the Word: Your packaging can educate and inform, turning every unboxing into a lesson in sustainability. → Fit for the Future: With e-commerce booming, smarter packaging means reduced transportation costs and waste. 👋 Want to see what your ecommerce brand could change to kick off your sustainability journey?

Maybe you can repurpose some of the boxes like one of our suppliers? It's great to see more and more branded merchandise suppliers thinking 'outside the box' when it comes to packaging - not just using recyclable materials, but designing packaging in a way so it can be easily reused for something else! Let us know if you come up with any innovative ways to repurpose your packaging... #brandedmerchandise #productpackaging #repurpose\n\nStarting with take-back may not be the usual path for a lifestyle product company. However, at RTV ReturnToVendor since we are a circular ingredient platform, we love to emphasize take-back. We believe companies should take responsibility for the products they put out in the world. One of our three pillars is responsible take-back. In our many discussions with brands across a broad spectrum of companies we tell the story of how the idea of RTV ReturnToVendor was born from the concept of reverse engineering how products should be made by thinking of end of use at the design phase. That is how we locked in on monomaterial design as a path to circularity. The image you see is from our sorting facility. What you will notice is an amalgam of clothing and textiles, with all types of blends and accessories that make them both difficult and expensive to recycle. RTV ReturnToVendor can handle all the products we put out in the world as part of our built in take back but also can help any brand who would like to put there stamp on take back with any material. We will customize a program that works best for your company. If you, or anyone you know has needs with clothing reuse and recycling we are here to help. DM us here or email info@rtv.earth"
