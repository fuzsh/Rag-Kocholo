        "text": "Voting summaries\n\nMPs have many roles, but one of the most important is that they make decisions. These decisions shape the laws that govern us, and can affect every aspect of how we live our lives. One of the ways MPs make decisions is by voting.\n\nOn TheyWorkForYou, we create voting summaries that group a set of decisions together, show how an MP has generally voted on a set of related votes, and if they differ from their party.\n\nYou can see these groups, randomly ordered, below.\n\nYou can read more about how this works, the kinds of votes we include, how we compare MPs to parties, and why we think this is important.\n\nThese summaries are created by the team at TheyWorkForYou. We are independent of Parliament and receive no public funding for this work.\n\nIf you want to support and help us improve these summaries, please consider donating.\n\nLearn more about how we'll use your donation and other ways to help.\n\nLord Garnier’s voting in Parliament\n\nLord Garnier was previously a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues would have followed instructions from their party and voted the same way as Conservative MPs.\n\nHowever, Lord Garnier sometimes differs from their party colleagues, such as:\n\nLord Garnier almost always voted for fewer obstacles for access to abortion; comparable Conservative MPs generally voted against.

Votes cast remotely are shown as normal on the TheyWorkForYou voting record.\n\n2nd to 9th June 2020\n\nThe option of online voting was removed, and a number of MPs may have been unable to vote because they were not physically able to attend.\n\n10th June 2020 onwards\n\nThe requirements on proxy voting were relaxed, allowing MPs to designate another MP to cast a vote on their behalf.\n\nIf an MP votes by proxy, it is effectively exactly the same as if they cast the vote in person and it shows up on their TheyWorkForYou voting record.\n\nMPs are not required to designate a proxy, and may instead pair with an opposing MP to miss a vote. Parliament does not record when two MPs have come to a pairing arrangement, so on TheyWorkForYou, they will both appear to have been absent for the vote.\n\nSee more detail on votes during the COVID-19 period here.\n\nNote for journalists and researchers: The data on this page may be used freely, on condition that TheyWorkForYou.com is cited as the source.\n\nThis data was produced by TheyWorkForYou from a variety of sources.\n\nFor an explanation of the vote descriptions please see our page about voting information on TheyWorkForYou.\n\nProfile photo: Open Government License version 1.0"
