Laurent Garnier is one of electronic music's best-known acts, a pioneering household name responsible for decades of clubland classics. From experiencing the acid-house movement first-hand as a DJ at The Haçienda through to timeless hits such as the breakout \"Crispy Bacon\" and the enduring \"The Man With The Red Face\", his tireless enthusiasm has permeated the dance music landscape via six celebrated albums, numerous singles and a relentless touring schedule. On 33 Tours Et Puis S'en Vont, Laurent Garnier's first solo LP in eight years and his most dancefloor-oriented yet, a total mastery of house, techno, and beyond is on full display. Club-leaning cuts from \"Liebe Grüße Aus Cucuron\" through to \"Granulator Bordelum\" all distil his years of warehouse, club, and festival experience into thrilling expressions of musical tension and release. Vocal-led tracks tastefully borrow from a range of genre influences; from the hip-hop inflected \"In Your Phase\" with 22Carbone, an incendiary number that will be firmly burnt into the memory of any attendee of Garnier's recent DJ sets, to the punk of \"Saturn Drive Triplex\", which features vocals from the late Alan Vega, of influential duo Suicide notoriety. Elsewhere, sprinklings of broken rhythms appear in the leftfield downtempo cut \"...et puis s'en Va!\" and drum & bass experiment \"Sado Miso\", offering listeners a further view into his wide-ranging taste. Across 2022, Garnier released five EPs, each containing a special hidden code referencing a fairground ride from his childhood, alluding to the album. 3LP version features Alan Vega, Scan X, and 22Carbone.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nCOD3QR33TEPSVCD\n\nLaurent Garnier is one of electronic music's best-known acts, a pioneering household name responsible for decades of clubland classics.

In the middle of my set I dropped '1-4 Doctor C'est Chouette'. A fan came up to the DJ booth to ask me what I was playing. When I told him it was one of my new tracks, he replied - to my surprise - 'There's so much melancholy in this track, what were you thinking about when you made it?' His question struck a deep chord: he had understood what I was feeling when I made the track...\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n12\"\n\nBEC 5161353\n\nEd Banger and Laurent Garnier work together once again to give birth to a new remix EP of the track \"Jacques in the Box.\" The first remix, by the French/German Brodinski & Gesaffelstein, offers a rhythmic, delicious and heady collaboration strongly inspired by German influences. On the flip, Chicago Bordelo delivers a clearly dynamic and electric sound, putting forth a new techno take on the track.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n12\"\n\nBEC 5161187\n\nThe first rave CD head-honcho Pedro Winter bought was Laurent Garnier's A Bout De Souffle EP in 1993. He discovered Paris night life at Rex Club like most Parisian party monsters. Thursday was \"Wake Up,\" where, once a week Laurent Garnier invited the cream of Detroit, the Chicago mob or the UK techno godfathers. We're in 2012, and the man is still spreading electronic music everywhere. This EP presents two pure and modern techno joints. Includes download card.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n12\"\n\nIV 016EP\n\n\"Laurent Garnier delivers his first dancefloor 12\" release in five years, Back To My Roots EP, released on Âme and Dixon's Berlin house imprint, Innervisions. This release represents a truly inspirational night that saw Laurent Garnier's welcome return to the club that represents Berlin's electronic music scene to perfection -- Panorama Bar. It's 5a.m., and Garnier, five hours since his set began, is supposed to finish and let Dixon take over. But, the intensity and energy asks him to play on. So he does, for another three hours of magic. 'During that time I played the demo mix of the \"Back To My Roots\" track, which I'd made that week. Dixon jumped on me to ask what it was. He said that he loved the sound of it and asked me what I wanted to do with it, mentioning that he would really like to release it on Innervisions. I went back home on the Monday and worked straight away on another track, which I named \"Panoramix\" (a tribute to that night at Panorama). I sent a very rough demo to Dixon via download and received a text five minutes later saying that he wanted it. It happened really fast without me having any plans at all.' - Laurent Garnier. Closely guarded within the Innervisions and Garnier camp, Back To My Roots EP, goes well beyond the hype that it is naturally receiving. An excellent pairing brings one of the most highly revered electronic artists in the world, together with one of the most highly revered house music labels in the world. It works. 'When Laurent played \"Back To My Roots\" at Panorama, I immediately had the feeling that I was listening to a classic. It's a very unique, timeless production. Not hip, not modern, not old school. It is also a 12 minutes journey that is worth to play for that long. We are very happy that Laurent told me straight away in the club that he would be cool with releasing this EP on our label.'\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2LP\n\nMUTE 9282LP\n\nDouble LP version.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nMUTE 9236CD\n\n\"30 is Laurent Garnier's second artist album originally released on his own F Communications label in 1997, and long out of print in the United States. 30 spawned the classic singles 'Crispy Bacon', 'Flashback', and 'The Hoe'.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n12\"\n\nF 127 EP\n\nFeatures the same three remixes of \"Greed\" found on the CD version, plus an exclusive Ashley Beedle mix of \"The Man With The Red Face\".\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nF 127 CD\n\n\"\"Laurent Garnier proves that he is not only a great DJ but more important a musician apart.

This surprising record does not shy away from exploring more diverse and tormented sounds than we have previously been accustomed to in his work. The jazzy echoes of 'City Sphere' and 'The Man With The Red Face', are undoubtedly a direct link with Garnier's live experience, the saxophonist playing on these tracks, Philippe Nadot, accompanied Laurent Garnier on his tour. The first single released from the album, 'The Sound Of Big Baboo', and also 'Dangerous Drive' are exercises in driving techno in a similar vein to 'Crispy Bacon', and are sure not to disappoint the dancefloor. Other tracks such as 'Communication From The Lab' and 'Downfall' are as haunting as the soundtrack to a terrifying thriller, as with the surprising 'Greed'. And of course we can discover in tracks such as 'Last Tribute To The 20th Century' and 'Cycles D'Opposition', Garnier's love for the American productions that have been an inspiration to him for so long. With this third ambitious album, Laurent Garnier proves that he is not only a great DJ but more importantly a musician apart.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nF 111 CD"
