        "text": "Stand up, Simon Hoggart. Yes, you in the back of the press gallery. And stand up straight, you miserable reptile. You are accused and will be found guilty of puncturing the self-importance of a member of Majesty's loyal opposition, to wit one who used to work for your miserable rag, the Guardian, as a night lawyer checking for libel.\n\nIt is a gross contempt of parliament to single me out for especial mention in your column last Friday for telling the truth: namely, that I went shooting near Warlingham in January as a guest of the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association and admitted as much in my entry in the House of Commons Register of Members' Interests. Did we not stand shoulder-to-shoulder against the massed ranks of the spin doctors in a Durham University Union debate, just after the end of the last shooting season, to argue for something which has been erased from my mind by this calumny laid at my door, this charge of obeying the rules of the House?\n\nBefore you are sentenced, let me explain the background to your offence. I like shooting. I go shooting as often and wherever I can. This annoys my wife, who thinks I should be at home at weekends tending to my family, the garden or my constituents; and because she cannot stand me plucking and drawing dead game in the kitchen. If I am invited to shoot during the week, I should be working, either as one of Her Majesty's Counsel, learned in the law, or as a tribune of the people.\n\nShooting is just one of the things allowing me to forget that I am a barrister or an MP. It clears my head of the tedium of powerlessness. It gets me out into the country, allows me to wear clothes almost as strange as those I wear in court and enables me to bring down the quarry when I fire at it - more than can be said for my party political life at the moment.\n\nThe public affairs director of the TMA is a friend of mine. You will have heard of him. He is a farmer, who enjoys shooting. He also happens to be a former member of parliament who decided not to stand at the last general election, John Carlisle. He and I could not be further apart in many aspects of Tory politics. We share, though, an old-fashioned love of the English countryside and all that implies, including shooting. We both took part in the countryside march last July to protest against the Foster Bill to ban hunting and this government's refusal to appreciate that there is an England outside the M25 that has rights and interests which (if different from those of the New Labour project) are valid and entitled to protection.\n\nA few days before the day, John rang, confessing that one of his guests had had to cry off and would I like to take his place? A few days later I set off on a dark, cold, pre-dawn morning to Surrey to meet up with John and his other guests.\n\nFrom where we met that cold, windy morning we could see Canary Wharf and the City of London. Greenwich was almost touchable (200 years ago, MPs shot partridge in fields just off what is now Oxford Street). The keepers and beaters could have been getting ready for a day's sport in Norfolk, or Leicester or Shropshire. Dogs, boots, tweeds, waterproofs, hats, large red- fingered hands, sticks and leads. To be there was to be far away from London, only 12 miles off.\n\nWho were my fellow non-PC guests? None was an MP apart from me. One was an MEP who had to leave shortly after lunch to fly to Strasbourg. One was a director of a tobacco company. The rest, my dear Hoggart, were members of Her Majesty's loyal press corps, journos to a man and I suspect well-known to you. By the end of the day, we had bagged 164 pheasants and 14 partridges that would soon be hanging in butchers' windows, delicious food at low prices. There is enough meat on a cock pheasant to feed a family of five and it costs £2.50.\n\nWhen my father was alive and running my uncle's estate shoot in Norfolk, he used to explain the economics of it: up flies £10, bang goes 10p and down falls £1. When my great-great-uncle was claiming the record grouse bag in a day to one gun -over 1,000 - on his moor in Yorkshire at the end of the 19th century, he was not fussed about the economics.\n\nNow shooting is part of the leisure industry and agricultural estates rely upon corporate days, like the one I enjoyed, to supplement much reduced farm incomes. The men and women beating out the woods are paid - and pay tax on - a good daily rate. The keepers' salaries are protected by the Agricultural Wages Board. The woodland is husbanded and the Surrey country kept unbuilt for Londoners to play in.\n\nIf now a few others know that, it is no a bad return for my 15 minutes of fame. But I have two things I must do: take my wife's hunting coat to the cleaners and write to the Registrar of Members' Interests to tell him about the fee for this piece."
