        "text": "F Communications is an icon in the world of electronic music. Without them, the French Touch movement would have been pretty one dimensional. They have been pretty quiet over the last decade, but F Com returns for 2020 with a strong reissue campaign. Why should anyone care today? This Parisian label has put out some of the best electronic music ever released and much of their catalogue has dated well. F Com has released everything from Techno to Downtempo. And they have done it in style. Their music is for the dancefloor but also for the home or the office. I believe that they are equally as important as British independents like Warp, Ninja Tune and XL. As they say themselves, “Electronic with no limit”.\n\nThe iconic generic record sleeves helped F Com stand out from the very beginning. The water submerged F was a work of genius by Parisian graphic designer turned illustrator Geneviève Gauckler. The label did not start from nothing, but rose from the ashes of Eric Morand’s Fnac Music Dance Division. Eric Morand brought in celebrated French Techno DJ and producer Laurent Garnier to help him launch F Com in the mid 1990s. In fact, the label was initially set up as an outlet for the productions of Garnier and Fnac label buddies Ludovic Navarre, Scan X and Shazz. It wasn’t long before F Com had a burgeoning roster of individualistic producers from France and the rest of Europe. In the early years, the imprint was known for releasing powerful Techno and House, later diversifying across the dance music spectrum. Many of the artists on the label built up their musical careers through their releases and association with F Com. A deal with PIAS meant that releases on the label were easy to get hold of in the UK and elsewhere from the start. According to F Com themselves, 70% of their records were sold outside France.\n\nF Communications is back, but the playing field has changed. In F Com’s heyday, labels used to sell thousands of copies of 12” singles on vinyl. Now selling a few hundred is considered successful. Another thing that has changed is that today vinyl buyers are as interested in looking back as they are forward. The number of reissues has skyrocketed over the last few years and there is now demand for old House and Techno records, as well as Japanese ambient records from the 1980s. It is a smart move for F Com to join the reissue party, instead of licensing their material to other labels. Spring 2020 has been a difficult time period for all record labels, but if anyone can weather the storm it is F Communications.\n\nThe label went dormant in 2008, only briefly returning in 2015 to release a single and an LP box set by Laurent Garnier. Now the label is back to celebrate 25 years with an ambitious reissue project. Twenty five 12” records. One for each year. The first batch contains Dune aka Laurent Garnier and Pascal F.E.O.S’ The Alliance EP, Toni Mono’s self titled Toni Mono EP, Mr Oizo’s M-Seq EP, St Germain’s French Traxx EP (originally released on Fnac Music Dance Division) and a Scan X collection, F Com 25 Remastered EP1. These EPs go back to the roots of F Com. This is the label’s DNA. The Alliance EP has melodic and acid Techno flavours, whilst the Tony Mono EP offers grooving 90s House. Mr. Oizo’s M-Seq EP provides cut and paste beats and squelchy basslines and St Germain’s French Traxx EP showcases Ludovic Navarre’s effortless House and Techno cool. The F Com 25 Remastered EP1 compiles four Scan X tracks from different releases, showing the space age Techno stylings of Stéphane Dri.\n\nThe second batch features Aqua Bassino’s Deeper EP, Deepside’s Tolerance EP, Laurent Garnier’s Club Traxx EP, Jori Hulkkonen’s F Com Selkaraasi EP and an EP from The Youngsters. Jay Robertson aka Aqua Bassino supplies just the sort of silky jazzy Deep House grooves that made the Scotsman a label mainstay. Deepside’s Tolerance EP sees Ludovic Navarre in Techno mode, with plenty of Detroit and Acid influences. Laurent Garnier’s Club Traxx EP is energetic Techno spread over five tracks and four slices of vinyl. Jori Hulkkonen’s F Com 25 Selkaraasi EP is actually compiled of tracks from both original Selkäsaari Tracks Episode 1 and 2 EPs. The Youngsters’ EP is full frontal driving Techno, with tracks from some of the various releases they did for F Com. Musically, this second set of reissues sets the bar even higher than the first did!\n\nThe third set contains Frederic Galliano’s Plis Infinis n°2, Laurent Garnier’s Flashback, Ready Made’s Opack, Scan X’s FCOM 25 EP2 and Elegia’s From Nowhere With Love. Plis Infinis n°2 is a magical modern Jazz effort from Frederic Galliano, which is accompanied by choice remixes. Flashback is one of Laurent Garnier’s finest moments. New listeners can now discover its swirling beauty. Opack shows the breadth of Ready Made’s sound. My favourite is the groovy Transcontinental. Scan X’s FCOM 25EP2 is another journey into the back catalogue of Stéphane Dri. Elegia completes this set with From Nowhere With Love, his magical debut EP for F Communications.\n\nThe fourth collection comprises Square’s Square EP, Llorca’s Precious Thing, Laurent Garnier’s Astral Dreams, Deepside’s Deepside EP and Alexkid’s Don’t Hide It (Acid Mixes). Square’s self-titled EP is thumping Techno that still sounds just as energetic as it did in the 1990s. Llorca’s Precious Thing is a magnificentsong that is well worthy of a reissue. The original is accompanied by the original Rollercone remixes. Astral Dreams is Garnier at his most punishing, backed by the stream lined LFO remix. We get four sides of vinyl from Ludovic Navarre and Guy Rabiller’s Deepside project. This EP originally came out on FNAC Dance Division. The smooth Detroit influenced Prelusion is my favourite on this doublepack. The selection ends with the self explanatory Acid Mixes of Alexkid’s Don’t Hide It.\n\nThe fifth and final collection contains A Reminiscent Drive’s Flame One, Jori Hulkkonen’s A Letter From Cardassia, Nuages’ Blanc EP, Laurent Garnier’s Coloured City and Sound of K’s Silvery Sounds. A Reminiscent Drive’s Flame One is a thing of pure beauty, as one would expect from Downtempo master Jay Alansky. Jori Hulkkonen’s A Letter From Cardassia is from his later F Com period and is heavily influenced by Electro soundscapes. Nuages’ Blanc EP sees Ludovic Navarre and Shazz strut their Techno stuff, with the glorious thrusting groove of Move being an obvious highlight. Coloured City is Garnier on the dancefloor, backed by the equally delectable Jackin’ Zone. Sound of K’s Silvery Sounds reasserts F Com as a Techno label before everything else.\n\nI have always had a close relationship with the music of F Communications. France was a regular childhood holiday destination, I learned the language at school and French culture loomed large. It was natural that I developed an interest in French music. In the mid 1990s, French electronic music was particularly strong. F Communications has been one of my favourite labels since I first came across their releases during that period. I was impressed by the fact they would put out such different records. Techno, Jazzy House and Downtempo on the same label? This was almost unheard of, even in the 1990s. The downtempo records were as good as the Techno ones, not an afterthought like the slower releases put out by some labels. Consistency is not something often associated with electronic music labels, but F Com were more consistent than most. I don’t love everything that has been released on the label, but F Com has put out a hell of a lot of good records. My favourite period for the label is from the mid 1990s to 2002. For many years, records on F Communications could be found in record shops’ bargain bins, but that’s generally not the case anymore. A cursory glance on Discogs shows that many releases are held in high regard and a select few sell for high prices. But, with a back catalogue of over 200 releases, bargains can still be had.\n\nWith the label reaching the milestone of twenty five years, I thought this was a perfect opportunity to reflect on my favourite artists and records on F Com. This is my personal journey with F Com. Therefore, I have written about the artists and records that have had an impact on me. For a fuller picture of the label, head to discogs.\n\nFor a playlist of my favourite 50 records released on F Communications, see HERE.\n\nMy F Com story starts with St Germain, Boulevard to be precise. Boulevard introduced me to the label and it inspired me to begin searching for deeper and jazzier sounds. I first read about Ludovic Navarre aka St. Germain in Muzik magazine, when they featured Boulevard at the top of their 1995 chart. Their gushing write-up made the album sounded incredible, so I bought it on cassette. The distinctive blue artwork and the white cassette intrigued me, even before I’d heard the music. The album itself was like nothing I’d heard before. It was broadly speaking a Jazzy House album, but it also displayed other influences such as Blues, Trip Hop and Dub. It was very different to the commercial dance music that I was listening to at the time. Boulevard made a huge impression on me. I didn’t ‘get’ all of the tracks to start with, but repeat plays helped me to understand Ludovic Navarre’s genius. Listening to it today, the album has aged very well. One of my favourite tracks is Deep In It, with its cool keys and clean percussion.\n\nIn 1999, I used to finish college at lunchtime on Fridays. I spent my Friday afternoons hanging out at Quadrastate Records in Stockport. Sometimes I helped out behind the counter and one afternoon I was given a 12” promo sampler for St Germain’s From Detroit to St Germain as payment. From Detroit to St Germain is a compilation of Ludovic Navarre’s early records that were released under different pseudonyms. I think the best track on the sampler is Todd Edward’s energetic remix of Alabama Blues, with its infectious keys, bumping bass and deft use of vocal samples. At the time I didn’t pay a great deal of attention to the other EP tracks, but they still hold their own today. These tracks predate Boulevard and show another side to Ludovic Navarre’s sound. Walk So Lonely is a tough bluesy sampling House effort from 1994. Move is a driving Detroit Techno influenced groover that was produced with Shazz, whilst 1993’s French is an acidic dream. On the surface, these tracks seem a world away from his later material, but they have the melody, deft sampling and raw energy that can be found on all of Navarre’s releases.\n\nFrom Detroit to St Germain was Ludovic Navarre’s final release on F Com. The jazz fanatic then achieved his dream by signing with Blue Note for the Tourist album. I remember that I first heard Rose Rouge in Piccadilly Records, a shop that I would later work in. From a brief listen via headphones at the shop’s counter, I knew that I had to buy it. The insistent percussion, commanding vocals and muted trumpet hooked me instantly. This record was House, but it was also Jazz (at least to me). Rose Rouge was a huge record. It was remixed by Blaze and Erik Truffaz at the time, and has been sampled and covered by countless others since then. Rose Rouge was the lead cut on the Tourist LP. The album was nice enough, but it was no Boulevard.\n\nIn 2015, St. Germain’s self titled album arrived on Warner Music. This was twenty years after Boulevard and fifteen years after Tourist. The new album was heavily influenced by Malian music, which according to Ludovic Navarre was his ‘new blues’. The influence of American blues can also be felt on this LP, but it is less pronounced than on previous albums. The lead single Real Blues gained all the attention with its urgent percussion, repeated bluesy vocals and beautiful kora work. With the exception of Rose Rouge, all my favourite Ludovic Navarre records have been released on F Communications. If I hadn’t heard Boulevard in the mid 1990s, I may never have discovered the rest of the label’s output.\n\nThe first vinyl I bought on F Communications was Shazz’s Back In Manhattan EP in 1996. This EP was revolutionary to my ears because it contained House, Jazz piano and instrumental Hip Hop tracks. This was a vinyl doublepack that emanated Parisian cool, despite the title track being written about New York. Back In Manhattan appears on the EP in four guises. There is a ‘12” Old School Mix’, an ‘Acapella’, a ‘7” Instrumental’ despite there never being a 7” issue of this record and a ‘Remix’ version. The ‘12” Old School Mix’ is my favourite, with its thrusting beats, uplifting chords and silky smooth vocals from Derek Bays. His vocals are barely understandable in places, but it doesn’t matter. The second track on the EP is La Seine, a piano led groover in a similar vein to Back In Manhattan that delves a bit deeper courtesy of a fat bassline and Alex Destrez’s virtuoso piano display. Place St. Georges also picks up Destrez for a beatless piano voyage in the same mould as La Seine. The swooning strings produce feelings of well being yet also melancholia. Intro confusingly appears on side D1. It is an erect House bumper with pointed key stabs and a golden bassline. Le Marais rounds off the EP. It is a majestic smoky Downtempo affair that features almost beat boxed vocals, hulking beats and a wistful keyed melody. It is a fantastically versatile EP that can now be picked up for less than its original retail price.\n\nThis record started my obsession with F Communications and French House in general. French House music was on fire at this point, even if F Com stayed away from the crowd pleasing filtered Disco side of things. Years later I found another copy of Back In Manhattan at Subwax in Barcelona and it brought back so many memories. Back In Manhattan was an important record in my musical development. Today, it still sounds fantastic.\n\nUnfortunately, Shazz only recorded three EPs for F Communications under his own name. He released a couple of Trance records as Aurora Borealis, but I was unaware of this alias in the 1990s. There were also collaborations with Ludovic Navarre that I assumed were Navarre’s solo releases, as they appeared on the From St Germain to Detroit compilation. Nuages’ smooth grooving Move is a particular standout from their collaborative work. Shazz had previously released three EPs for Eric Morand’s Fnac Music Dance Division. I never saw any of these in the 1990s, as the Fnac back catalogue wasn’t available in the record shops I visited.\n\nAfter the EPs on F Com, Shazz signed to Columbia and released a self-titled album. I never saw the album on vinyl, but the remix EPs were almost ubiquitous at time. My favourites are the slouching Matthias Heilbronn versions of Carry On and Bob Sinclar’s smoky remixes of Pray. A few years later, I picked up a dusty copy of the In The Light album whilst working at Piccadilly Records in Manchester. This LP was released on Epic in 2001. It was a poor seller for Piccadilly and I don’t remember it getting much attention in the UK full stop. Today, it actually sounds quite cute. I heard little of Shazz until 2019, when remixes of some early material surfaced on a new label called Electonic Griot. The remixes came from the likes of Ian Pooley, Butch, Dan Ghenacia and Folamour. The new versions are all pretty functional, but I prefer the originals!\n\nOne of the names synonymous with F Communications is Jori Hulkkonen. The Finnish producer released six albums on the label and more than 20 singles under his own name and aliases like Hösh and Jii Hoo. My introduction to Jori’s music was 1996’s Selkäsaari Tracks – Episode 2, an EP of clean cutting Techno and House that was both functional and exciting. My favourite tracks on the EP are the sharp synth driven 3rd Line and the driving The Vinci. I loved Jori’s music from the first listen because it was deep, emotive and tough. Purely functional Techno did little for me, but the deeper stuff drew me in. After hearing this EP, I always looked out for Jori Hulkonnen’s records.\n\nThe next record I heard by him was 1999’s Deatch Yorself. The complex percussion and deep seated groove made this an instant favourite. I tried to follow all of his releases after this, but his high level of productivity made it difficult to keep up. A few years later, I found a promo copy of the When No One Is Watching We Are Invisible vinyl sampler. My favourite track on it is the breakbeat led Versus. Almost UK Garagey in flavour (at least to my ears), the combination of piano loop, warbling bassling and sunshine synth washes works really well. This track is unlike anything I’ve heard Jori produce before or since then. I had the opportunity to hear Jori DJ twice in around 2002, when he toured Europe off the back of his incredible BBC 1 Radio Essential Mix. His DJ sets were excellent. They featured his own productions and remixes alongside exciting House, Techno and Electro tracks from that era and beyond. For his gig in Manchester, I picked him up from the airport with the promoter in a Mini car that was unable to reverse.\n\nI didn’t initially realise that Jii Hoo was a Jori Hulkkonen alias. I thought it was a project of Jori’s with another producer. The Shelter record was actually a collaboration with the vocalist Lu. Shelter is one of Jori’s deepest moments, with its searing strings, textured beats and lovestruck vocals. Elegia’s remix is true to form, stretching out the strings further and adding musical intrigue. In 1999, I was unaware that Hulkkonen had already released my favourite record under his Jii Hoo guise. This was the peerless Let Me Luv U, which came out in 1997 on F Communications and PAN in the UK. I picked up a copy of the Pan promo a few years later, not knowing that it had even been released on F Com. Armed with a poignant vocal sample from a Willie Hutch record, sturdy beats and overarching synths, Hulkkonen created a monster. Let Me Luv U still gets to me, every time I hear it.\n\nOver the years, Jori has released everything from Electro Pop to Techno under close to twenty names. As well as F Com, there have been releases for labels such as Turbo, My Favourite Robot and many others. Jori even had a brush with commercial success as Zyntherius alongside Tiga. Their booty shaking Electro cover of Sunglasses at Night was a big hit in 2001.\n\nA Reminiscent Drive aka Jay Alanski makes music with real emotions. Anyone can make Ambient or Downtempo music, but few do it in a way that really hits home. Jay Alanski does this. He chose the A Reminiscent Drive name when signing for F Com in 1996. The first fruits of this musical marriage were a handful of EPs that were collected on the gorgeous Mercy Street long player. On this album, Alanski wooed listeners with his ability to create heartfelt melodies and astonishing sound textures. This was followed up by the simply beautiful Ambrosia long player in 2000. Alanski’s music is very stylish, as well as being deep.\n\nMy introduction to A Reminiscent Drive was a remix EP that came out in 1998. It led with Jori Hulkkonen’s uplifting ‘Slick Latin Heart’ mix of NYC Dharma. It also contained Charles Webster’s stunning remix of Two Sides To Every Story, under his Love From San Francisco guise. This slow burning Deep House remix is one of Webster’s deepest and best moments. After enjoying this EP, I decided to check out A Reminiscent Drive’s original productions. In 2000, a promo sampler for the Ambrosia album was released on vinyl. This contained the track of the same name, which became an instant favourite. Characterized by open percussion, calming keys and a soft brass line that guides the melody, Ambrosia is a thing of beauty. It was only later I learned that Jay Alanski had been releasing music since the late 1970s. Although, his Jay Alanski records were funky Pop and Rock albums as opposed to Downtempo electronica. To confuse matters, his parting shot on F Communications was an album released as Jay Alansky in 2003, which seemed to fuse both of his musical worlds.\n\nLudovic Llorca has always been one of my favourite F Com artists. My introduction to Llorca’s music was the jazzy Can’t Take It EP, which came out in 1997. It was Llorca’s first release on F Com and it is one the best. The Jazz influences were even more prominent on 2001’s New Comer LP. If St Germain had instrumental and spoken Jazz House down to a tee in mid 1990s, Llorca showed what could be done with singers. The most enduring tracks on the album are the songs, collaborations with singers such as Lady Bird and Nicole Graham. My favourites from the LP are the enchanting Indigo Blues and My Precious Thing. It is a shame New Comer did not receive the same level of acclaim as Boulevard. A number of remixes came out after the LP, my favourite being Llorca’s bassy ‘Old School Remix’ of My Precious Thing.\n\nThat was it for Llorca on F Com. Ludovic then began to focus on a ‘techier’ alter ego, Art of Tones. The first few releases as Art of Tones came via Leeds based 2020 Vision, with more recent material surfacing on the Swedish Local Talk imprint. Unexpectedly, Llorca resurfaced as Llorca with a jazz influenced album in 2017 called The Garden. Llorca has done tonnes of remixes over the years. My favourites being the understated ‘Pommes Noisettes’ version of Mazi and Colette’s Do You Want Me? and the triumphant revision of Mambo Urbano Orchestra’s Devotion. I was also a huge fan of the strutting Frantz Kromer remixes of Miss Me’s Surprise Me, which I didn’t even realise was a Llorca alias until 2020.\n\nF Communications has its roots on the dancefloor. One of my favourite club records is Elegia’s Basic. It is a synth driven groover with ghostly disembodied vocals and running water type keys. Basic was released in 1999 and I’m pretty sure I heard it around this time. The Laurent ‘Laboratoire Garnier’ mix of Basic is one of Garnier’s finest moments. It is a stomping version with unfurling synths, smart stabs and crowded percussion. Elegia is Laurent Collat. His music can be characterized as House and Techno with intense melodies and bottomless grooves. Collat released an album and a number of 12”s for F Communications as Elegia. Basic is my favourite. I was also a big fan of his Lushlife 12”, which appeared under The Kick Inside moniker on David Duriez’s Brique Rouge imprint in 2001. Collat has continued to make music since F Communications went on hiatus. In 2019 he self-released the Father album, which can be found on Bandcamp. It goes down the same Deep-Tech path as his earlier material.\n\n1999 was the year that Alexkid came into my life. This was via the Soul College EP. The EP is a sultry collage of low slung Deep House grooves and jazzy edges. I picked this up for next to nothing. It was another unloved promo that some DJ or journalist had left at Manchester’s Vinyl Exchange. Jazz Course is my favourite track on the EP. It features oozing guitars that groove over simple House beats. In 2001, the Bienvenida album followed. It is a positively joyous album that mixes Jazz, House and Hip Hop influences. The title track Bienvenida is a particular favourite. After this, Alexkid took a darker musical path. He released two more albums and a bunch of singles for F Communications, before moving to other imprints such as Ovum, Rekids and Rawax. His later work is less jazzy. Some of it can be classified as Techno and Acid House.\n\nYou can’t talk about Mr. Oizo without Flat Beat. It became the label’s biggest hit, after it soundtracked a Levi’s jeans commercial featuring a playful yellow puppet named Flat Eric. Flat Beat is a damn good record. More than two decades after its original release, the bassline is addictive as ever and those jumpy electroid beats are still just as fun. The commercial was directed by Mr Oizo himself aka film director Quentin Dupieux. On the 12”, the bumpy basslined electroid house banger was backed by the melancholic instrumental Hip Hop vibe of Monday Massacre and the cut and paste Sick Dog Try To Speak. This seemed like a bit of a weird combination, but for Oizo this was business as usual.\n\nIt comes as no huge surprise that his early cut and paste style morphed into something more abrasive. Listening to his playful music today, it is obvious that Mr. Oizo is a very talented producer. It is a shame that many people only know him for Flat Beat. His second and final album for F Com was named Moustache (Half A Scissor) and it dropped in 2005. It features the fantastic sticky dancefloor burner Half A Scissor, which pre-dated the recent rave revival by more than a decade. Further albums followed for Ed Banger and Brainfeeder. Ed Banger is undoubtedly the perfect home for Dupieux’s glitchy raved-up cut and paste sound.\n\nFrederic Galliano is a painter and a visual artist, as well as a music composer. Galliano released two electronic Jazz albums on F Com named Espaces Baroques and Live Infinis. Despite being experimental in focus and not that far away from the dancefloor, these LPs were probably the nearest that F Communications got to straight up Jazz. This was followed up by his African Divas project, which was recorded on location in East Africa and featured vocalists from the region. My favourite Frederic Galliano record is Sabar. It was a precursor to the African Divas project and features African stylings and vocals. Sabar was released as a 10” single encased in a multicolored cloth bag made by Aminata and Yacine Enterprises in Senegal. The two tracks are Le Vent (the wind) and La Poussèrie (the dust). Both are haunting compositions with strong basslines and punishing percussion.\n\nBoss of the label alongside Eric Morand, Laurent Garnier dominates the F Com catalogue. He released 5 albums on the label during its first incarnation, as well as a large number of singles. The label was even brought the label back in 2015 just to release Garnier’s La Home Box and the Honey I’m Home! single. A DJ comfortable playing across the board, Garnier’s best productions are records for the dancefloor. The Man With The Red Face is his most triumphant record. It is perhaps even his theme song. A sax driven scorcher with eternal appeal, The Man With The Red Face still sells today.\n\nIn the 1990s, Garnier was a big name. I had read cover story interviews with him in magazines like Jockey Slut and Muzik before I had heard any of his records. The first record I heard by him was 1997’s Flashback. This Acid House tribute record is actually more Techno than House. Backed by a Lil Louis remix, it was a fitting homage. Next up in 1997 was the now classic Crispy Bacon. It is a powerful Techno stormer that is one of Garnier’s best productions. Aux 88’s Electro re-shape and Gilb’R’s Drum & Bass remix still sound pretty good today, too. So does the B side, a razor sharp booty banger named The Hoe. The next Garnier release that caught my attention was The Sound Of The Big Babou in 1999. I actually prefer the deep percussive workout of the B side, Sore Fingers, to the A side. 2004 saw the release of the ambitious The Cloud Making Machine. Ultimately, it was the remixes of the singles that made a lasting impression and Carl Craig’s lofty version of Barbiturik Blues is my pick.\n\nI have tried to pay attention to Laurent Garnier’s releases over the years, but in reality I have heard little of his post F Com releases. The exception being 2014’s phenomenal Bang (The Underground Doesn’t Stop) on Still Music. Laurent Garnier has always been celebrated as a phenomenal club DJ. I’ve always thought of Garnier as a better DJ than producer, but revisiting his back catalogue for this feature has made me realize that he created some exceptional records.\n\nWhen F Communications went to sleep in spring 2008, the world of electronic music lost one of its greatest labels. Many artists have had their finest hour on F Com. Today the Parisian label returns, twenty five years after the first release. Is it time for a new chapter in the F Com story?"
