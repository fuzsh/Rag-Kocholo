        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path?\n\nIn my youth, I was introduced to electronics by my stepfather who worked for Rockwell. I found his work interesting, and I always wanted to keep learning more about it. After finishing school, I landed a job at a communications company that manufactured and installed computer networking equipment. From there, I got into engineering and eventually to the business side of things. I was fortunate to grow up around technology since it ended up becoming my career path.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began leading your company?\n\nSix degrees of separation in our business is really more like two degrees. I’ve known some of my team for decades, others through business dealings, and quite a few were referred from trusted sources. Once you start to compare notes, you quickly realize how intertwined we are in this industry and how we share very common experiences. There have been many times when an obscure reference to a long-gone company has been met with equally obscure anecdotes by team members.\n\nCan you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nMy first foray into leadership happened many years ago. I made the transition from individual contributor to management, but still carried myself as one of the team, and as such, responded to an all-company email with a quip that the main recipient and I thought was quite funny. Senior management did not find it as funny. And the main recipient found my all-company apology even more funny. That easy, yet embarrassing lesson taught me that there are different expectations on how you carry yourself as you lead. We still have fun, but I watch those reply-all emails.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nOver 30 years ago, on a random flight, I was fortunate enough to meet a young lady who would eventually become my wife. She herself is a CEO of a women’s health company called LisaHealth, and just as she pushed herself, she always pushed me to live up to my potential and then to use that position to find a way to help others. Being in leadership allows a platform that can do good business while simultaneously doing good things. She taught me that.\n\nLeadership often entails making difficult decisions or hard choices between two apparently good paths. Can you share a story with us about a hard decision or choice you had to make as a leader?\n\nA difficult decision has been deciding if we’re the type of business that tries to cater to everyone’s needs, or if we streamline products and services for our industry. We’re fortunate to have fantastic customers and a team that wants to provide the best service possible for them. The only downside is that sometimes we find ourselves saying ‘yes’ to things to be helpful, when an honest assessment would lead to a ‘no’ answer and perhaps a referral to a partner who’s better suited for the job. Know what you do and be good at it.\n\nOk, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. Most of our readers — in fact, most people — think they have a pretty good idea of what a CEO or executive does. But in just a few words can you explain what an executive does that is different from the responsibilities of the other leaders?\n\nIn my view, the CEO sets the pace and tone for the entire organization. It’s a key difference that sets them apart from other leaders within the company. The management team often looks to the CEO as a guiding example of how the organization should function. In an orchestra, the conductor directs the band members, establishes the rhythm, and enables them to work together harmoniously. They set the pace and tone, and the rest of the team follows suit.\n\nWhat are the “myths” that you would like to dispel about being a CEO or executive? Can you explain what you mean?\n\nMany people, myself included in the early days of my career, tend to think of CEOs and other executives as people you rarely interact with, and when you do, should be approached with caution. Now, my belief is that executives should be approachable. They shouldn’t be seen as people to fear or avoid in the workplace, but rather as individuals you can trust and rely on.\n\nWhen someone has a concern or even an idea, I want them to entrust me with their thoughts and not fear pushback or repercussions. This kind of open and trusting atmosphere creates a positive work environment and encourages innovation at all levels.\n\nWhat is the most striking difference between your actual job and how you thought the job would be?\n\nWhen I first became a CEO, I expected that I would have to undertake much of the company’s responsibilities on my own. However, I quickly learned that when you surround yourself with people you trust, they take that burden off the CEO as an individual. I have a wonderful team around me that I trust to elevate myself, our company, and those around us. Of course, there is a lot of pressure on the CEO as the face of the company, but I feel relieved knowing that my team embodies our values and consistently works hard to instill them throughout the company.\n\nDo you think everyone is cut out to be an executive? In your opinion, which specific traits increase the likelihood that a person will be a successful executive and what type of person should avoid aspiring to be an executive? Can you explain what you mean?\n\nI believe that everyone has their own journey. Becoming a successful executive is all about the magic that happens when preparation meets opportunity. We all have that potential within us, but need to be prepared to meet an opportunity when it comes our way, especially when we have ambitious goals. I didn’t know what I wanted to be until I was almost fifty, so there’s no limit on what you can achieve when you have the drive to accomplish it.\n\nWhat advice would you give to other business leaders to help create a fantastic work culture? Can you share a story or an example?\n\nCelebrate people and make them feel comfortable sharing their experiences and background. At Evocative, we are a diverse company. That range of thought, of background, and of culture makes us stronger. We have an ever-growing team that consistently engages in sharing their experiences of world holidays, religious and non-religious observances, cultural learnings, and local information about where they live or grew up. And I am fortunate enough to lead this charge.\n\nHow have you used your success to make the world a better place?\n\nAt Evocative, we focus on DE&I and on our people. With team members spread across various countries, the fascinating aspect is that bridging the geographical divide through shared experiences makes the world seem a bit smaller. We actively encourage the exchange of experiences and insights, allowing us to learn from one another regardless of our physical location. As a result, our team not only accepts but embraces our differences. This openness inspires individuals to share more, continuously learn, and integrate these experiences into their lives.\n\nFantastic. Here is the primary question of our interview. What are your “Five Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Became A CEO” and why? (Please share a story or example for each.)\n\n1. Closely Monitor Your Industry’s Changing Momentum\n\nWhen I took on the role of CEO at Evocative, I quickly realized that a significant shift was happening in the digital infrastructure industry. Since 2015, there has been a notable transformation in the market landscape, with hybrid cloud emerging as the primary focus for data storage. Unlike the public cloud, which relies solely on remote servers, hybrid cloud combines on-premises storage with cloud deployments through providers like Evocative.\n\nWhile the public cloud gives companies fast access to their data, reaching it can become a variable. On the other hand, a hybrid cloud approach allows companies to optimize their workloads by keeping a direct connection to their critical information while minimizing costs and improving security. Once I recognized that, I began to challenge Evocative to find better ways to service our customers with hybrid cloud as a focus. Moving forward, our plan is to prioritize and excel in this area to better serve the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n2. Build on the Customer Experience\n\nAt Evocative, our company’s core focus revolves around the customer. However, I have learned that it’s not just about customer service; it’s about delivering an exceptional customer experience. While customer service is a post-sales function, the customer experience encompasses all our efforts throughout the entire customer journey. Every member of our team plays a role in interacting with customers, and it’s not limited to a specific individual’s responsibility.\n\nMy philosophy is that we’re all privileged to have direct involvement in engaging with our customers on a day-to-day basis. As the CEO, it’s my job to instill this customer-centric mindset into our company’s culture and nurture it across the organization. By embracing this mindset, we ensure that delivering an exceptional customer experience becomes ingrained in our company’s DNA.\n\n3. Hire the Right People\n\nOver time, I’ve learned that the CEO sets the tone and framework for the management team and the company’s culture as a whole. I believe in trusting the people I hire and empowering them to carry out their roles effectively. It ensures that as a collective group, we can steer the company together rather than as individual contributors. Trusting my team members is essential because it enables us to accomplish tasks more efficiently and effectively. If I couldn’t trust the people I hire, then all the burden would be on me, and that’s not how things get done.\n\n4. Know Your Goals and Celebrate Accomplishments\n\nAs executives, we set larger objectives for the company. But these objectives are always comprised of planning and goals within our teams. These incremental team wins are milestones to measure our progress as a whole toward the larger company objectives. So while achieving the big company goals is incredibly important to us, it’s equally important to celebrate team accomplishments along the way.\n\n5. Effectively Use Your Position to Drive Your Values Forward\n\nThis idea is particularly important to me. I see being CEO as a place of privilege because of the impact it has on an organization and everything it touches. That’s why, like I’ve mentioned previously, the CEO sets the pace in terms of company values. For Evocative, inclusion is a core value. We have so many locations around the world and want to celebrate the people, places, cultures, and ideas that make us what we are. We’ve built a culture where everyone can share and contribute.\n\nOne thing I always strive for is to use my position within the company to amplify others’ voices. Welcoming our people from all over the world to educate us has become a great motivator for me, and it ties directly to the success of the business. When people feel celebrated and valued, we share a common passion to grow and progress together. It becomes a sort of ‘business with purpose.’\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good for the greatest number of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.\n\nI would say my ultimate goal is to help as many people as possible become the best version of themselves. The mission is to make sure those who don’t enjoy the same opportunities and privileges as someone in my position can still fight to achieve their goals. It’s very personal, which makes it that much more fulfilling.\n\nFor example, Evocative’s worldwide locations allow us to bring opportunities to areas that may otherwise have limited access. It gives me a tremendous sense of accomplishment when we can impact communities in that way. I think this is our own movement and one in which we have the power to make a tangible difference.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n“I walk around like everything’s fine, but deep down, inside my shoe, my sock is sliding off.” In addition to this anonymous quote just making me laugh, to me it means that keeping a positive attitude no matter the situation is always the best course of action.\n\nWe are very blessed that some very prominent names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them.\n\nThe late Orson Welles, but unfortunately you may need a wider distribution to reach him. To me he is one of many pioneers who embodied a spirit of fearless adventure, traveling and meeting the people of the world, then drawing on those experiences to move people through the art of storytelling. He was a motivator.\n\nThank you for these fantastic insights. We greatly appreciate the time you spent on this.\n\nThank you for the opportunity."
