        "text": "Musical artist\n\nLaurent Garnier (born 1 February 1966), also known as Choice, is a French electronic music producer and DJ. Garnier began DJing in Manchester during the late 1980s. He became a producer in the early 1990s and recorded several albums.\n\nEarly influences\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1984, Garnier started working as a waiter at the French Embassy in London.[1] He started playing with DJ Nelson, a.k.a. DJ Stan, at a French club. He stayed there for a year and a half before moving to Manchester in 1986. Living in England he discovered the booming UK house scene and started DJing, including at the Haçienda.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1987, he discovered The Haçienda in Manchester, and met Mike Pickering the resident DJ. Chicago house and Detroit techno became popular, and Garnier started mixing there under the name of DJ Pedro.[1]\n\nIn 1988, he went back to France to fulfill his military obligations.[1] He also spent some time in New York City where he met Frankie Knuckles.[1] Garnier shifted his attention back to France in the early 1990s, running the Wake Up parties at the Rex Club in Paris for three years,[1] and in Dijon from 1990 to 1994 at L'An-Fer while in 1992 he played a three-night long Weekender set at the Cork venue, Sir Henry's. He also mixed in clubs such as Le Palace or Le Boy, DJing in rave parties and gradually moving into recording as well. For the FNAC label, Garnier released \"French Connection\" and the A Bout de Souffle EP. After that label went out of business, he formed the F Communications label with Eric Morand (a friend who had also worked for Fnac).[1][3]\n\nHis first album, Shot in the Dark, was released in 1995.[4] His second, 30, appeared in 1997 and included one of Garnier's best selling singles, \"Crispy Bacon\". 30 was followed by the retrospective Early Works. After appearing worldwide with DJ appearances during the late 1990s, Garnier returned to production with Unreasonable Behaviour, released in early 2000, which featured one of his best known songs,[5] \"The Man with the Red Face\".\n\nSelected discography\n\n[edit]\n\nCharted albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak chart positions FR[6] BE BE (V) BE (W) UK[7] Shot in the Dark 1994 — — — — 87 30 1997 42 — — — 92 Early Works 1998 66 — — — — Unreasonable Behaviour 2000 42 11[8] — — 94 My Excess Luggage 2003 139 — — — — The Cloud Making Machine 2005 73 — — — — Tales of a Kleptomaniac 2009 45 — 28[9] 74[9] — La Home Box 2015 98 — 98[10] 111[10] — 33 tours et puis s'en vont 2023 — — — 41[11] —\n\nCharted singles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak chart positions FR[6] UK[7] Astral Dreams\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n1994 — 85 Crispy Bacon\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n1997 — 60 Flashback\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n1998 — 82 Coloured City\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n2000 100 98 Mega Single: Techno 2003 95 — The Sound of the Big Babou\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n— 92 Man with the Red Face\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n2005 — 65 Gnanmankoudji 2009 99 — Greed/The Man with the Red Face\n\n(with F Communications)\n\n2009 — 36\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nShot in the Dark (1994), F Communications\n\nRaw Works (US only compilation) (1996), Never Recordings\n\n30 (1997), F Communications/PIAS France\n\nUnreasonable Behaviour (2000), F Communications\n\nEarly Works (compilation) (1998), Arcade\n\nThe Cloud Making Machine (2005), F Communications/PIAS\n\nRetrospective (compilation) (2006), F Communications/PIAS (includes a track with Håkon Kornstad)\n\nPublic Outburst (2007), F Communications, live album with Bugge Wesseltoft, Philippe Nadaud, Benjamin Rippert\n\nTales of a Kleptomaniac (2009), PIAS\n\nla HOME box (2015), F Communications\n\nDe Película (2021), with The Limiñanas, Because Music\n\n33 tours et puis s'en vont (2023), COD3 QR\n\nSingles and EPs\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Ed Banger records\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Timeless EP\" (2012)\n\nWith FNAC Music Dance Division\n\n[edit]\n\nAs French Connection (1991), with Mix Master Doody\n\nStronger By Design EP (1992)\n\n\"Join Hands\" (remixes) (1992)\n\nParis EP (1993), with Shazz, as Choice (also published by Fragile Records)\n\nA bout de souffle EP (1993) (also published by Warp Records)\n\n\"Wake Up!\" (1993) (\"One year of music for house music lovers\" – free to people who went to the first anniversary of the \"Wake Up\" club in Paris)\n\n\"Lost in Alaska\" (1993), with Nic Britton, as Alaska\n\nPlanet House EP (1993)\n\nWith F Communications\n\n[edit]\n\nAlliance EP (1994), with Pascal FEOS, as Dune\n\n\"Astral Dreams\" (1994)\n\nDeuxième EP (1995), as Alaska\n\nClub Traxx EP (1995)\n\n\"The Hoe\" (1996)\n\n\"Crispy Bacon Part 1\" (1997) UK No. 60[12]\n\n\"Crispy Bacon Part 2\" (1997)\n\n\"Flashback\" (1997)\n\n\"Coloured City\" (1998)\n\nClub Traxx EP Vol 2 (1998)\n\n\"The Sound of the Big Babou\" (1999)\n\n\"The Man with the Red Face\" (2000) UK No. 65[12]\n\n\"Greed\" / \"The Man with the Red Face\" (2000) UK No. 36[12]\n\n\"Sambou\" (2002)\n\n\"Returning Back to Sirius\" (2003), as Alaska\n\n\"6 Months Earlier\" (2004), with Ludovic Llorca, as Marl Chingus\n\n\"The Cloud Making Machine\" (reworks vol 1 & 2) (2005)\n\nWith Innervisions\n\n[edit]\n\nBack to My Roots EP (2008)\n\nDVDs\n\n[edit]\n\nGreed DVD single – F Communications, Film Office, TDK Mediactive (2001)\n\nLive à l'Elysée Montmartre – F communications (2002)\n\nCompilations and DJ sessions\n\n[edit]\n\nX-Mix – Destination Planet Dream (Studio !K7 – 1994)\n\nMixmag Live Vol. 19 (1995)\n\nLaboratoire Mix (2xCD, React, 1996)\n\nEarly Works (2xCD, 1998)\n\nFashion TV: Spring – Summer 2001 Collection\n\nClassic And Rare : La Collection Chapter 3 (F Communications, 2002)\n\nExcess Luggage (3xCD, F Communications, 2003)\n\nThe Kings of Techno (Rapster Records, 2006)\n\nMixmag 25 Years Anniversary (2008)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
