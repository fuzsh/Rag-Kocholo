Graffeo, ilā Kamalagharan and Sabah Choudrey for making this discussion so impactful! “I loved seeing other trans and intersex people discussing the struggles trans people in general face but also the hopeful messages. I felt a sense of community and also have some cool resources to check out. My take away is that I need to find queer community.” - Participant feedback 💬 We're eager to do more of these sessions, so if you'd like to bring it to your organisation get in touch at hello@wecreatespace.co 💌 🧑🏽💻 Check out ten more trans training programme suggestions: https://lnkd.in/ef82uUS4 #DEI #TransRights"
