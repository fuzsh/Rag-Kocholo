Figshare\n\nTracking Data records the x and y coordinates of every player on the field, as well as the ball, a number of times per second (usually 10-25). For this reason, the dataset is quite large, much larger than event data at around 2-3 million rows per game.\n\nThe data is collected by cameras installed in a stadium and is therefore not widely available, with teams usually only having access to the data in their own league.\n\nThe main providers of this data are Second Spectrum, STATS Perform, Metrica Sports, and Signality.\n\nName Comments Source / method(s) to get the data Last Row Tracking-like data by Ricardo Tavares Tracking-like data collected by Ricardo Tavares.

For access, contact Novosom Salvador Twitter and rsalvadords@gmail.com, or feel free to contact myself. Note, that the 2nd half of the Hammarby-Örebro match is incomplete.\n\nBroadcast Tracking is collected from broadcast footage using computer vision techniques. Unlike in-stadium tracking data, the dataset is not complete and missing players out of shot of the broadcast footage. However, the great benefit is that the data collected is much cheaper and the coverage for what leagues are available is much greater which is extremely useful for tasks such as recruitment analysis.\n\nThe main providers of this data are SkillCorner and Sportlogiq.\n\nName Comments Source / method(s) to get the data SkillCorner broadcast Tracking data 9 matches of broadcast tracking data, including matches from 2019/2020 for the league champions and runners up in English Premier League, French L1, Spanish LaLiga, Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga.
