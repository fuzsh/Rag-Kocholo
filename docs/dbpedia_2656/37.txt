Sir Edward Garnier QC is the former Conservative Party MP for Harborough. He is a Queens Counsel in private practice.

Garnier was appointed Solicitor General in May 2010.[1] He left the Cabinet in September 2012.[2]

Garnier stood down ahead of the 2017 general election. In the general election in May 2015, Garnier retained his seat gaining a majority of 19,632. [3]

Outside interests

Garnier has come under scrutiny for being one of the highest earning MPs who have jobs outside of parliament. In 2014 he earned £275,584 working as a QC in addition to his salary as an MP. He has defended this, saying his experience as a barrister has made him a better MP, and that his constituents were able to vote him out if they objected to it. [4]

Garnier told the Guardian he felt it is 'essential that the Commons, and thus the frontbench teams in both government and opposition, are not just reserved for professional politicians without experience of the world outside Westminster … Parliament is the better for having MPs who do not spend and have not spent their whole time inside politics'.
