        "text": "Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger visited USC Wednesday for a conversation on the rise of hatred around the world.\n\nAs part of the former actor’s campaign to quote: “Terminate Hate” Schwarzenegger and other distinguished figures in the USC community joined in conversation on how to address extremism in our society.\n\nCNN’s Dana Bash, USC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay, Dr. Erroll Southers and Dr. Robert Williams were all featured during the two-hour lecture held in the Annenberg Auditorium.\n\nThe panel discussed the rise of hate crimes and anti-Semitism, and the increasingly polarizing political climate in America, and potential solutions to these issues.\n\nIn his lecture, Schwarzenegger emphasized the importance of communication in healing conflict, and praised USC Annenberg for its achievements in the discipline.\n\nSchwarzenegger: I think the issue that we are dealing with has to do with prejudice and hate. A lot of it has to do with communication. This is why this [Annenberg] is the appropriate center to have this event here today, and that’s why I know that Willow [Bay], you will be important in the future because I told you already, communication is the number one issue here. This is the perfect center and you are the perfect team for that, so you are going to help in the future in stopping some of those problems.\n\nCombating racial and political prejudices has been an integral part of Schwarzenegger’s platform, dating back to his time as governor of California to now, where he advocates to millions of fans and followers through social media and global summits.\n\nLast summer, Schwarzenegger received the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation Award for Fighting Hatred for his advocacy against anti-Semitism.\n\nA recorded version of Schwarzenegger’s conversation at USC can be found on YouTube, titled: “Terminating Hate: Breaking the Cycle of Extremist” posted by USC Price.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I’m Chris Bibona."
