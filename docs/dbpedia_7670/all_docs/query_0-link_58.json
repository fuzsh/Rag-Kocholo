        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has never apologised for smoking pot – and loving it — at the height of his bodybuilding career in the 1970s. Now, as a struggling Republican governor of California reaching a crossroads in his political career, he might yet become America's most visible advocate for legalising marijuana.\n\nThe actor-turned-politician gladdened the heart of every joint-roller and dope fiend across the Golden State earlier this week when he said it was time for a full debate on legalisation.\n\nSchwarzenegger was careful not to say too much – he stopped shorting of saying he was in favour of legalising cannabis now – but his words broke a long-standing taboo among both Republicans and Democrats who have previously felt obliged to say marijuana must remain illegal, and marijuana users and pushers be subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nThe governor spoke in response to a new public opinion poll showing that 56% of registered voters in California favour legalising and taxing marijuana – in part to help the state out of the worst budget crisis in its history. The state faces a shortfall of billions of dollars a year because of the bad economy, and public services from schools to hospitals to fire-fighting services are under mounting threat.\n\nAsked if he too favoured legalisation, Schwarzenegger told reporters: \"Well, I think it's not time for that, but I think it's time for a debate. I think all of those ideas of creating extra revenues [are worth considering] … I think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalised marijuana and other drugs. What effect did it have on those countries?\"\n\nThe redwood forests of northern California are famous for their marijuana cultivation, creating an underground economy that has continued to thrive despite America's decades-long war on drugs. The Golden State has been a leading rebel against the federal government's strict interdiction policies, becoming the first of 14 US states to allow marijuana for medical use as far back as 1996.\n\nLegalisation, however, has never been a serious part of the agenda.\n\nThe most immediate effect of the governor's comments is likely to be a boost for a legalisation bill recently introduced in the state assembly by a San Francisco liberal Democrat called Tom Ammiano. Such bills pop up every few years and are almost always ignored or defeated, but this one may just be different now.\n\n\"I look forward to working with the governor and my colleagues in the effort to be the first state in the nation to enact commonsense policy on marijuana,\" an elated Ammiano said. His proposed system of legalising and taxing marijuana would raise an estimated $1.3bn a year in tax revenue alone, according to state legislative analysts. The savings in law enforcement and incarceration costs could be many billions more.\n\nSchwarzenegger may feel he has little to lose. He feels out of step within an increasingly rigid, increasingly hardline conservative Republican party, and the economic crisis in California has pushed his popularity ratings below 40%."
