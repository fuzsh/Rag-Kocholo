        "text": "Actor and bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger revealed that he underwent a secret heart surgery to fit a pacemaker and become “more of a machine,” humorously comparing himself to his famous on-screen persona in ‘The Terminator.’\n\nThe 76-year-old action hero, who has undergone different heart surgeries over the years, posted a health update on the Arnold’s Pump Club website and opened up about getting the pacemaker.\n\n“Last Monday, I had surgery to become a little bit more of a machine: I got a pacemaker,” said the Austria-born star.\n\nThe action hero shared a health update and said, “I want you to know I’m doing great!”\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“I have to tell you, just saying this to all of you goes against so much of my upbringing in Austria, where nobody — ever — talked about medical issues. Everything related to healthcare was kept to yourself,” he went on to say. “But I’ve gotten so many messages and emails from people who were born with a bicuspid aortic valve, like me, telling me that talking about my valve replacement surgeries has given them courage and hope to deal with their own.”\n\nThe actor revealed that he was able to have his surgery on Monday, March 18, at the Cleveland Clinic and then attended a big event the following Friday.\n\nThe Hollywood star revealed he is living with a genetic heart issue and has had heart surgeries in the past\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“First of all, I want you to know I’m doing great!” he said. “ … Nobody would ever have thought I started the week with a surgery.”\n\nHaving lived a life “with a genetic heart issue,” Arnold revealed that he could have kept the pacemaker a secret but knew that his fans are “dealing with” their own “health challenges.”\n\n“I want you to know you aren’t alone,” said the Batman & Robin actor. “And if you’re putting something off out of fear, I hope I inspire you to listen to your doctors and take care of yourself.”\n\nAs he shared the update, Arnold Schwarzenegger included an emotional message to remind people that they are not alone in their health struggles or their fight against a medical condition or disease\n\nHe provided a special message to the Arnold’s Pump Club subscribers and reiterated that they “are never alone here.”\n\n“This village is a place for us to be open and honest because it’s impossible to be truly positive when you keep everything bottled up,” he added. “That’s what Arnold’s Pump Club is all about. There are weights that none of us can lift alone. But together, we can lift anything — we can lift up the world. You are never alone here.”\n\nArnold, who has always received praises for his excellent physique, spoke about growing older and candidly shared what it’s like for his body to change with age.\n\n“I kind of smile because every day I do look in a mirror and I say, ‘Yep, you suck,” he told Howard Stern last year. “Look at this body. Look at the spectral muscles that used to be firm and perky and really powerful. Now they’re just hanging there.’ I mean, what the hell is going on here?”\n\nOpening up about the very relatable sentiment of watching one’s body change over the years, the actor added, “When you’ve been hailed for years as this supreme body, and you have the definition and you see the veins coming down your abs, and you see veins on top of your chest and then cut, you roll the clock 50 years and you’re standing there and you don’t see that anymore.”\n\nArnold also told Howard that he believes confronting difficult challenges can help individuals with their personal growth.\n\n“The more you experience the things you really don’t like, the more you can grow, and the tougher you get and the more you can handle. It’s just that simple,” he added. “So many young kids today kind of shy away from that.\n\nFans online wished the Hollywood hero a “speedy recovery” and gave him their best wishes"
