        "text": "Big Oil concedes; withdraws referendum on 3200’ setbacks law\n\nIn a major win for NRDC, environmental justice communities and our allies and supporters, the oil industry pulled its referendum on the critically important 2022 oil well setbacks law from California’s general election ballot. The referendum stalled the 2022 law (SB 1137) but once withdrawn, the law took effect immediately. All new wells and redrilling of existing wells must have a 3200-foot setback distance from homes, schools, and daycare centers.\n\nThe Campaign for a Safe and Healthy California to keep the law succeeded due to a legislative effort to pressure the oil industry to withdraw the measure, a $1 million ad buy featuring LA County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, activist Nalleli Cabo, and philanthropist Wendy Schmidt, and the support of celebrities including Jane Fonda, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Julia Louis Dreyfus. May campaign polling showed supermajority support for the law. The oil industry stated that it intends to shift the fight to the courts, but it is unclear whether they have a case.\n\nCalifornians to decide on $10 billion for clean drinking water, wildfire prevention and family farmers\n\nCalifornians will have an opportunity to support climate action, health, and natural resources this November. On July 3, the legislature passed, and acting Governor Mike McGuire signed SB 867 which will go on the general election ballot as Proposition 4. The measure would provide up to $10 billion in bond funding for land conservation, habitat restoration, parks, safe water, and support for family farmers and farmworkers, and NRDC Action Fund is in full support of Proposition 4. The bond also includes money for offshore wind upgrades at California’s ports and for transmission infrastructure, which will help keep these costs from accruing to electric bills. Proposition 4 is supported by environmental and environmental justice groups, fishing associations, sustainable agriculture and small farmer advocates, and the offshore wind industry. Recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California shows support from majorities of Californians throughout the state. Should Proposition 4 pass, NRDC will work diligently with our partners and the State to ensure that the bond funding supports only the most beneficial projects for communities and the environment.\n\nInitiative that would have stalled funding for environment and health protection declared ineligible by CA Supreme Court"
