        "text": "Movie star and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wants environmental activists to give more attention to immediate health hazards like air and water pollution.\n\nSchwarzenegger spoke Sunday at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, where diplomats from around the world are discussing implementing the Paris climate accord.\n\nHe said: “It’s time we wake up and talk about what really matters: 25,000 people dying every day because of pollution.”\n\nSchwarzenegger also criticized the environmental community for “missing the point” with its messaging on global warming.\n\nHe said: “People do not focus as much on 2 degrees energy increases in temperatures or increases in sea levels rising.”\n\nSchwarzenegger thinks calling attention to concrete issues, like “so many people having problems with cancer and kids with asthma,” is a better approach."
