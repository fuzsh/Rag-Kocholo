        "text": "🌟 **Heartfelt Actions, Healthier Hearts** 🌟 🔖 **#HeartHealth #KindnessMatters** \"There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up.\" Today, let's explore this profound message and how it benefits our heart, both literally and metaphorically. 🧡 **Kindness: The Unseen Cardio Workout** Kindness and compassion are not just moral virtues; they are catalysts for positive physical changes in our heart: 1. **Reducing Stress:** Acts of kindness release oxytocin, which reduces blood pressure and protects the heart. 2. **Elevating Happiness:** Helping others triggers the release of endorphins, the brain's natural mood elevator. 3. **Creating Connections:** Social bonds strengthen through acts of kindness, providing emotional and psychological support. 👐 **Every Act Counts:** - A comforting word to someone in distress. - Volunteering for community services. - Lending a hand to those in need. 🌱 **Small Gestures, Big Impacts** Each small act of kindness is like a heartbeat, vital and life-affirming. It's about creating a ripple of positivity that not only uplifts others but also enhances our own heart health. Let's make kindness a habit. Our hearts will thank us for it! #SpreadKindness #HealthyLiving\n\nWe get so lost in accomplishing goals: - losing weight - overcoming disease - making $X at work or in our business - not yelling at our kids as much - having better relationships - reaching a certain level in our career - getting certified in X or obtaining X degree - etc… But have you ever thought about who you are designed to BE in the process? Are you just collecting accolades? Are you just trying to look better than someone else? Are you trying to prove something to someone who hurt you? Are you trying to beat the system amd get rid of your pain, disease, circumstances??? Let THAT sink in…. We weren’t called to DO any of that. We are called to BE a light 💡. To forgive. To set healthy boundaries. To focus on cultivating family relationships. To change generations to come, means focusing on who God designed YOU to be. Stop trying to show off or do everything for others. BE you 💕 and things will change for the better!\n\n🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲 Forgiving someone who hurt us, is like navigating through a dense forest. It can be challenging and we might think it's easier to cut trees down. But real freedom comes from forgiving. Holding onto anger is like holding onto a hot rock, ready to throw it, burning yourself in the process. Forgiving, is opting to be wound free, by placing it down out of reach. We might feel forgiveness means accepting the hurtful actions, but it's more about letting go of the pain, not condoning what happened. It is a personal process, freeing ourselves from our own suffering, much like a tree shedding old leaves to make way for new growth. As we persevere, we reach a clearing where the past no longer holds us back and is akin to climbing a mountain....the uphill struggle might seem endless, but reaching the summit brings the better view. This pathway helps us to understand, that pain can bring more pain and to foster compassion, even for those who hurt us, is like a river carving its course through rocks. #Forgiveness #HealingJourney #LettingGo #ForgivenessJourney #NatureOfHealing #FreeYourself #EmbraceCompassion #LetGoOfThePast #StrengthInForgiveness #ForestOfResilience #MountainOfClarity #NewGrowth #HealingPath #InnerFreedom\n\n🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲 Forgiving someone who hurt us, is like navigating through a dense forest.

We are talking about things we can do to take care of ourselves and to make a difference during this turbulent time. You might hear about the atrocities that are happening across the globe and, because you are a compassionate person, you want to help but feel helpless to do so. I understand...me too! Yesterday, we talked about taking care of yourself so that you remain calm and strong. Today we think about one thing we can do that will help us feel like we are making a difference, and that is to reach out and do some tangible thing that will help someone around you and will contribute goodness to the world. The ugliness we are watching unfold is contributing mountains of awfulness into the world - pain and suffering...destruction and death - and the only way to counteract this much hate is with love. I realize most of us can't get to the people right now who are genuinely suffering from the actual attacks, but we absolutely can intentionally pour goodness and love into our communities and that IS adding goodness and love to our world...plus the acts of kindness that we do, will help feed us with the sense that we genuinely are making a difference...because we are! Who do you know around you who could use a kind word or helping hand? Think about your neighbors or co-workers. Do you have any family members that need a little help? Could you volunteer at an animal shelter or take them food? Could you spend a couple of hours listening to lonely seniors at a nursing home? Could you offer to watch a young mom's children so that she could rest? Now is a perfect time to invest time and energy into helping someone else. No doubt, it would help others, but it also will fill your own soul with the satisfaction of helping and it also pours goodness and love into the world, which absolutely makes a difference in our planet. You CAN make a difference, even if you can't reach out across the world!

It’s human nature to seek comfort, especially during the holidays. The thing is, when we numb the stress or discomfort, we also inadvertently numb our joy. 😬 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Whether your go-to is alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, sweets, shopping, gambling, or endless scrolling, remember, you’re not navigating this journey alone. Perfect isn’t the goal here. We’re all in this messy, imperfect human experience together. The good news? You have the power to decide when “enough” is truly enough. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Join me tonight at 7pm MST live on Zoom as I share about my sobriety journey and the tools that have helped me make choices aligned with Joy. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ In essence, sobriety is less about battling addiction and more about having the courage to feel our feelings. It’s about embracing and appreciating the highs and navigating the lows. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Join me for a FREE Joy Session for our incredible Joy Club community night. We’re diving into “BUILDING A JOY HABIT: Release the need to numb & THRIVE this holiday season and beyond…” ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Sign up below and let’s light up this holiday season from the inside out! 🎄🎉 https://lnkd.in/g-CqrH8U ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\nMany of you have wanted a deeper dive into exploring life and death after Let's Chat About Death - and here it is. 🎉 🤗 ✨ We are launching BEFRIENDING DEATH, BEFRIENDING YOUR LIFE: A year long course, aligning your wild and precious living with what matters most.
