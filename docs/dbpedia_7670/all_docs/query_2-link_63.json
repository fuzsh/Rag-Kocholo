        "text": "If Netflix documentary The Game Changers well and truly changed the eating game for you, you’ll be familiar with The Terminator’s lifestyle. If not, buckle up. Things are about to get wild as we share five reasons why Arnie is the ultimate vegan hero the world needs right now.\n\nImage source\n\n1. Arnold Schwarzenegger is 99% vegan\n\nAnd is the star of my 100% favourite Christmas film, Jingle All The Way. The 72-year-old action legend has been living on a meat and dairy-free diet for the past three years, only making very few exceptions regarding his food intake and usually when filming. Arnie's new vegan menu is a far cry from his competitive bodybuilding days when he consumed a diet consisting mostly of tuna, meat, eggs and chicken to build muscle mass.\n\nAnd we’re convinced that if Arnie lived in the UK, he’d be a keen allplants subscriber.\n\nallplants offers an exciting range of over 60 plant-based, chef-made meals that have been flash-frozen to lock in their nutrients. Check out the latest menu in the shop now.\n\nImage source\n\n2. He encouraged the world to follow the rules and stay at home during lockdown with the help of his donkey, Lulu and miniature pony, Whisky\n\nNo, honestly. During lockdowns, Arnold Schwarzenegger was staying home with his animals to avoid coronavirus ​​and eating vegan food and suggested that others do the same. Schwarzenegger references the importance of listening to advice from health officials in a video published on his Instagram, “especially when you are 72-years-old!” In the video, he feeds the animals carrots at the dinner table and adds: “I just had my little bit of vegan food.” “See that is what we do. We don’t go out, we don’t go to the restaurants, we don’t do anything like that,” explained Schwarzenegger. “We just eat with Whisky and Lulu have a good time and be entertained and we have a good time eating here together!” Sounds pretty good to us.\n\nImage source\n\nNext time you want to eat like Arnie, Lulu and Whiskey, why don’t you reach for our Teriyaki Udon. It's a spicy, sticky teriyaki sauce coating soft udon noodles, with sesame mushrooms, mixed fresh veg, a sprinkling of toasted cashews and crunchy carrots (just for Lulu.)\n\n3. He has even shared online workouts during lockdown with Lulu\n\nAgain, not joking. Arnie shared the short workout video on his Twitter. In the clip, he completes a number of workout exercises while his animal companion, Lulu the donkey, observes and joins in. If that is not the most wholesome thing you’ve ever seen, we need to talk.\n\nImage source\n\n4. Arnie told the world his hero is teen climate change activist, Greta Thunberg\n\nArnie lent Greta Thunberg his electric car to travel to Montreal for a climate change rally, in one of the most bizarre but brilliant occurrences of 2019. And it’s not the first time the two legends have crossed paths. Schwarzenegger’s environmental organisation held a climate summit in Vienna last May. Thunberg was joined by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen in opening the R20 Austrian World Summit. Schwarzenegger was “starstruck” to have met her, according to an Instagram post by Schwarzenegger himself. At the summit, the former California Governor “praised Thunberg as a dreamer who had created a grassroots youth movement to hold those in power accountable for their pledges to roll back climate change”.\n\nImage source\n\n5. He is working to change the vegan game\n\nPerhaps most importantly (donkey workout videos aside), Arnie produced and featured in The Game Changers, where he shared his new-found love of eating plant-based food over meat.\n\n“As I got older and I started reading up on it, I recognized the fact that you really don’t have to get your protein from meat — or from animals,” he shared. “So we started going more in the direction of a vegetarian kind of diet. Now we’re doing it the right way, with spices, and all of a sudden, I love it much more than the meat.”\n\nDid The Game Changers terminate your relationship with meat? (Sorry, couldn’t resist). If so, we’d love to know, as well as hearing about other vegan heroes you admire!"
