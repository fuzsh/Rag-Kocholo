        "text": "Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger surprised many advocates of gay marriage last week when he warned on national television that the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples could result in bloodshed.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger was on television again on Monday night but this time he threw opponents of gay marriage for a surprise, including many from his own Republican Party.\n\nThe governor said it would be ''fine with me'' if Californians changed the state's family code to allow for same-sex marriages. He also said he opposed a constitutional amendment backed by President Bush that would ban them.\n\n''I think since we have a state law, I think those issues should be left to the state,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said on NBC's ''Tonight Show.'' ''So I have no use for a constitutional amendment or changing that at all.''\n\nThe apparent softening of Mr. Schwarzenegger's public stance had proponents of same-sex marriages rejoicing on Tuesday and opponents feeling betrayed. But advocates on both sides predicted he had not spoken his final words on a subject that has provoked a national debate.\n\n''I think that after the election, we will try and have a serious talk with him and see if we can come out with a more reasonable position,'' said State Senator William J. Knight, a conservative Republican who was the author of a successful ballot measure in 2000 opposed to same-sex marriages.
