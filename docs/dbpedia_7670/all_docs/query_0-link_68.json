The subcommittee met at 10:40 a.m., in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter (chairman) presiding. Present: Senator Specter. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER Senator Specter. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education will now proceed. 21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS Our hearing this morning is to consider the budget request by the Department of Education for fiscal year 2004 for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. The request by the Department is for $600 million, which is a very sharp reduction of last year's appropriation, which was $993 million. This is a program which serves approximately 1,300,000 students in 1,400 communities throughout the United States. It provides a wide variety of educational experiences and has generally been regarded to be a highly effective program until the Department of Education this year has cited what they conclude to be, quote, ``disappointing initial findings from a rigorous evaluation.'' In light of this conclusion, albeit preliminary, the subcommittee concluded that it would be important to have a hearing and go into this issue in some detail. We have respect, obviously, for what the administration has to say, but constitutionally the responsibility for the appropriations process rests with the Congress, and it begins with this subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Education. STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM D. HANSEN, DEPUTY SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ACCOMPANIED BY RUSS WHITEHURST, DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Senator Specter. Our first witness is Deputy Secretary Bill Hansen, who has had that position since May of 2001. Prior to that appointment, he was president and chief executive officer of the Education Financial Council. He has a bachelor's degree from George Mason University. He's accompanied by Mr. Russ Whitehurst, who is the director of the Institute of Education Sciences at the Department of Education. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Hansen. Our subcommittee rule on testimony is 5 minutes, and we ask witnesses to adhere to that to the extent possible. Some people think that 5 minutes is brief. We recently had a memorial service for Ambassador Walter Annenberg, and the speakers included President Ford, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and myself, and we were limited to 3 minutes. So I want you to know what a generous allocation 5 minutes is. Secretary Hansen, the floor is yours. You may proceed. Mr. Hansen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And everything I have to say, I will say in 5 minutes here. Thank you for the invitation to be before your subcommittee this morning, and I am grateful that the name card is here on the table, so that nobody is going to mistake me for a major Hollywood star. But I have seen what happens when Mr. Schwarzenegger walks into a building. When he came to meet with Secretary Paige at the Department, we practically had to call the fire marshal in to clear the hallways. Senator Specter. Excuse me, is he one of the students involved in this testimony? Mr. Hansen. That is right. Senator Specter. I am surprised to hear your star is Mr. Schwarzenegger, as opposed to the students, but proceed. Mr. Hansen. But everybody wanted to grab a glimpse of him, and I must also say I have testified dozens of times on Capitol Hill, and this is the first time my children have come to see me, so they are not here for me. Anyway, Mr. Schwarzenegger does have many fans, and it is not just those who flock to the theaters to see his films. Many of his biggest fans are the schoolchildren all across America, who have found him a good friend and an inspiration, and a strong advocate on their behalf. And in this mission, he has strong allies in President Bush, Secretary Paige, and all of us at the Department of Education. AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM--ASPIRING YOUTH As Houston school superintendent, Secretary Paige helped launch an after-school program called Aspiring Youth that blended both academics and the athletic focus that Mr. Schwarzenegger's Inner City Games Foundation produces. I am also pleased to have with me today--behind me, Texas Juvenile Court Judge Eric Andell, who led that program when he was in Houston. Judge Andell now heads the Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools. President Bush and Secretary Paige believe in the bright potential of every child, and I know you do, and the subcommittee does, as well, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the bipartisan support of many here in Congress, the President last year signed the most sweeping reform of Federal education policy in over three decades, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. This new law lays out a loud and clear message that every child can learn, no matter what their background, where they live, or how much money their parents earn. 21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS FUNDING An important part of this effort is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program that calls for safe and caring places for children to go to after school lets out, where they can make quality use of their time by getting help with homework or playing sports or studying. We backed that commitment with significant funding, $1 billion last year, and $993.5 million this year. Our commitment to children, great as it is, is also matched by our commitment to use hard-earned taxpayer dollars more wisely. And President Bush and Secretary Paige have been very clear on this point. Our focus is the child. We will fund only what works to help children. We will not pour limited resources into programs that fail their mission. MATHEMATICA STUDY OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS So you can imagine our concern, Mr. Chairman, when some troubling findings turned up in a rigorous evaluation by Mathematica Policy Research of the 21st Century After School Program. The study found that many of the after-school providers did not improve academic performance, did not decrease delinquent behavior, and did not make students feel safer. FISCAL YEAR 2004 REQUEST FOR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS Clearly, this was not our definition of success, so we made the decision to reduce funding for this program in our 2004 budget request to $600 million and spend those resources on proven effective programs where they have demonstrated results. In particular, the Title I program for educationally and economically disadvantaged children, and also special education for children with disabilities. The President's budget request for both of these programs received a billion-dollar increase representing our priorities. But to help ensure future success, we are also taking action steps to ensure that the billion dollars we are spending this fiscal year and what Congress appropriates for 2004 will be driven towards results for children. AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS SUMMIT Let me just highlight a couple of our initiatives that we are working on. Next month, the Department will co-host a summit with Mr. Schwarzenegger that will bring together experts, after-school providers, educators, and parents to talk about what it takes to create a quality after-school program. And, I must say, when Secretary Paige met with Mr. Schwarzenegger in Palo Alto several months ago, this was Arnold's suggestion, and it was a wonderful idea. We are looking forward to working with him on it as we move into the summer months. MODEL PROGRAMS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Second, the Department is about to begin researching the effectiveness of some promising after-school models that have come to our attention. And, finally, we are providing technical assistance to many new applicants for State grant funds to help strengthen their programs. ADMINISTRATION COMMITMENT TO QUALITY AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS This administration is totally committed to quality after- school programs that will provide a safer place for more young people to grow and learn, away from the temptations and dangers of the streets. It is a goal that we share with Mr. Schwarzenegger. We look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, and also your distinguished colleagues on this subcommittee, to accomplish these noble goals on behalf of America's children. PREPARED STATEMENT I would also just like to conclude by saying that we very much look forward to, as this Committee and as this Congress maps out their budget resolution and their priorities for the upcoming appropriations process, working with you as we prioritize where our funding levels should go. We look forward to working with you in that capacity. Mr. Chairman, thanks again for the opportunity to be with you this morning. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of William D. Hansen Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the benefits of after-school programs in the context of the Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. The Administration supports the development of local after-school programs, and believes they play an important role in many communities. The Administration also supports the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, but has taken three important factors into consideration in setting forth its 2004 budget proposal for this program. First, the recent rigorous evaluation of this Federal program indicates, among other things, that grantees are not having a positive impact on students' achievement. This Administration is dedicated to funding programs that work, and this rigorous evaluation, initiated by the Clinton Administration, indicates this Federal program has shortcomings. Second, this Federal program is undergoing a significant, legislatively directed change. Congress established that the Federal Government shift 21st Century grant funding from Washington-selected grantees to those selected by States. Third, the program has grown rapidly with little consideration of its effectiveness. In light of these three factors, the Administration believes the most responsible use of Federal funds would be to fund the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program at $600 million in 2004. Today I will place 21st Century funding in the context of the President's 2004 budget. Then I will go into more detail about the specific evaluation findings that led us to believe that this is a good time to reconsider and improve our support for after-school and other extended learning programs. EDUCATION IS A MAJOR DISCRETIONARY BUDGET PRIORITY As you know, earlier this year we celebrated the first anniversary of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which President Bush signed into law on January 8, 2002. State officials, administrators, and teachers across the country now are working hard to strengthen their accountability systems, identify research-based strategies for improving student achievement, and offer new choices to parents whose children attend low-performing schools. The President's budget seeks $53.1 billion for Department of Education programs in 2004. That represents more than a 25-percent increase since 2001, and a 130-percent increase in Federal education funding since fiscal year 1996. Key increases for the cornerstones of the Federal role in education include: --$12.4 billion for Title I, a 41-percent increase since the passage of No Child Left Behind; --$9.5 billion for IDEA grants to states, a 50-percent increase since he was elected; and --$12.7 billion for Pell grants, for a record 4.9 million students. The challenge for the President is balancing all of the priorities within and outside education in a responsible budget. The President believes that the limited sums of available Federal funds should be concentrated on programs that have the greatest impact; impact derives from programs that are effective and demonstrate results-in other words, programs that are accountable. This discipline is more difficult in light of the competing demands of the war on terrorism and efforts to restore economic growth. REALLOCATING SCARCE RESOURCES Program accountability links to resource allocation. The 2004 budget proposes the elimination of funding for 45 education programs totaling $1.5 billion, and reduces funds for other programs to focus on higher priority activities. In making such decisions we considered the history of the program, recent legislative changes, and program effectiveness. Each of these factors contributed to our decision on the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. First, program funding had grown very rapidly, from just $1 million in fiscal year 1996 to $1 billion in fiscal year 2002. This rapid growth was due in large part to the program's presumed contribution to improving academic achievement, particularly for students in low- performing schools. Second, the No Child Left Behind Act changed the program from a federally administered competitive grant program to a State formula- grant program under which States will make competitive awards. Since all previously awarded projects will conclude during fiscal year 2003, all of the $600 million requested for 2004 would be available to States for new awards during a natural transition year. The requested level actually represents a slight increase over the amount that States will have in 2003 for sub-State awards. The remaining $400 million is for federally administered continuation grants that will end in 2003. Third, recent evaluation findings strongly suggested that the 21st Century program was not having the desired impact on student achievement. Nor was it effective in achieving other goals, such as reducing delinquent behavior. For all of these reasons, and in combination with the tremendous challenges involved in the implementation of the NCLB Act, we made difficult choices and funded programs that benefit our greatest needs most effectively-Title I, Special Education, and Pell Grants. EVALUATION FINDINGS SUGGEST A NEED FOR PROGRAM CHANGES To gain a better sense of future program directions for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, I think it helps to take a closer look at our initial evaluation findings. This evaluation, which was conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., uses far more rigorous methodologies than other studies cited in the after-school program literature. The research design included random selection of elementary-level program participants and matched comparison groups for middle school participants. While no single study can ever provide a final or complete picture of the effectiveness of a program, good budgeting in times of scarce resources demands that decisions be made on the best available evidence. This study, which is the strongest to date in the after-school literature, points out very basic shortcomings in the current Federal program: --Content.--After-school programs should emphasize and result in improved academic achievement. Those funded under the 21st Century program do not. Children's reading scores did not improve. They did not perform better on homework or other assignments. --Behavior.--The Federal program had no positive impact on delinquent behavior. In fact, program participants in federally funded programs were slightly more likely to have sold drugs or smoked marijuana than non-participants. --Safety.--The program did not make students feel safer, with program participants actually suffering greater property damage than non-participants. --Participation.--Put simply, participation was weak. Children in federally funded programs attended just two days a week, on average, and more frequent participation in the program did not lead to better outcomes. Current investments in the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program have not paid off. We believe the program's implementation should be reformed, and in light of the transition to State grants, we believe there should be a reallocation of a portion of the funds supporting previous rapid growth. KEY CHANGES ARE UNDER WAY With the transition of the 21st Century program to a State- administered competitive grant program, we are taking a number of steps to improve program quality and outcomes. These include: (1) developing model after-school programs based on sound theory and scientific evidence; (2) new research to test the effectiveness of various interventions; (3) improving the availability of research findings and effective after-school practices through our What Works Clearinghouse; and 4) expanding technical assistance at both the State and local levels. For example, the Department is helping to establish networks of State and local program coordinators so they can share best practices and effective approaches. The Department will continue its practice of convening annual summer grantee institutes in which States and local grantees share ideas on building programs that include high-quality academic instruction. The Department also plans to work with States to implement successfully the statutory requirement that States establish performance indicators and measures for 21st Century projects to help ensure that this is truly a performance-based program. For example, we plan to issue guidance providing a model of a performance-based competitive grant system that States could use to guide their efforts to comply with the statute. Such a model would help States quantify and monitor the value of academic achievement, behavior and safety performance, and student participation levels linked to recipients of the new State grants. CONCLUSION Mr. Chairman, Congress and the President share the same goals with this program: supporting local after-school programs that provide a safe environment for students that improve their academic and social outcomes. And we agree that federally funded programs should be rigorously evaluated for their performance under those goals. In light of the evidence, the President believes the best avenue to reach those goals in 2004 will be for the Department of Education to implement the reforms that I have mentioned, and to support this program at the level requested in the President's budget. EVALUATION OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS Senator Specter. Well, thank you, Mr. Hansen. This is the first of three studies? Is that correct? Mr. Hansen. It is. Senator Specter. When are the other two studies going to be completed? Mr. Whitehurst. Well, we have an ongoing study, the first reports of which occurred in the publication that is referenced in Mr. Hansen's testimony. The second wave of that study is being analyzed now, and the results should be available within 6 to 12 months, if not sooner. Senator Specter. And how about the third phase? Mr. Whitehurst. I am not aware of a third phase, Senator. I will have to check on that and get back to you. [The information follows:] Reports From 21st Century Community Learning Centers Evaluation The current study of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program includes three reports. The first report was recently released (February 2003) and includes implementation and impact findings from the first year of data collection from the Department's study. The second report will include implementation and impact findings from the second year of data collection from the study and is projected to be available within the next 6 months. The third report is a synthesis report. 21ST CENTURY LEARNING CENTERS EVALUATION Senator Specter. Well, is there a third phase? Mr. Whitehurst. I am saying I am not aware of the third phase of that---- Mr. Hansen. We do have program evaluation monies that we are working with and national activities funds that we are contemplating using for some further look into the program. Mr. Whitehurst. What we have---- Senator Specter. And what, specifically, is the ``further look into the program''? Mr. Whitehurst. What we have decided to do with evaluation money for the after-school program going forward is to try to identify and develop programs that are likely to be more effective in addressing safety needs and academic needs for children, to demonstrate that those programs are effective, if, in fact, they are, and, then to disseminate those programs widely. Senator Specter. Well---- Mr. Hansen. Mr. Chairman, I think the third report you are referencing is going to be a combination of the first two reports. It is going to be a summary report. It will not have new research or new data. It will be a summary report. FISCAL YEAR 2004 BUDGET REQUEST Senator Specter. Well, the question, the initial question, which comes to my mind is why such a drastic reduction, when these are only preliminary findings and you have a second survey which is in process which you have not analyzed? To take it from $900-million-plus and reduce it to $600 million really is an enormous reduction. It may really gut the program in many respects. Why is it sound to do that before your studies are complete? CHANGE FROM DISCRETIONARY TO STATE GRANT FUNDING Mr. Hansen. Mr. Chairman, the information we received from the studies also aligned with the changing of this program. This program, from 1997 up until last year, was a discretionary grant program. The applications came into the Department, and we funded them based on the quality of those applications. In the No Child Left Behind Act, the program was changed to a State grant program. And 2003, our current funding year, will be the last year of funding for all of those discretionary grants that we had given out before. So it is also what you might call a natural turnoff time in the way that the program is operated under the new reauthorized law. CHANGES IN PROGRAM OPERATION Senator Specter. Mr. Hansen, I do not understand that at all. What is the relevancy of whether it is a discretionary program or a State grant program on the question as to how well it is working? Mr. Hansen. Because of the way that the program has worked before--under the previous statutory construction--we do not believe, and I do not think Congress believed, that the program was designed effectively, and that is why the changes were made in the No Child Left Behind law. Senator Specter. Well, now just a minute. Speak for yourself; do not speak for Congress. Do not tell this subcommittee what Congress thinks unless you have some factual basis for it. Do you? Mr. Hansen. There were changes that were made in the reauthorization of the program that now require that States run these competitions and that also open up the program not just to school districts, but to other community-based providers and faith-based providers and nonprofit organizations. Senator Specter. Well, there are frequently changes in reauthorization which do not bear on a determination that the program is ineffective. Do you have something specific from the reauthorization legislation which supports your statement that there is a congressional conclusion that the program was ineffective? Mr. Hansen. I did not say that Congress said it was ineffective. They made changes to strengthen the program and change the direction of the program. Senator Specter. No, you said that the Congress as well as the administration--adopted language to the effect of being disappointed in the program, not satisfied with it. Mr. Hansen. They made changes in the program, in the 2001 reauthorization of the program. Senator Specter. Well, aside from the changes, do you have any basis for saying that Congress was dissatisfied with the program? Mr. Hansen. We do not, sir. TRANSITION TO STATE-ADMINISTERED PROGRAM Senator Specter. Well, when you talked about a change from discretionary funding to State grants, how is that relevant on the quality of the program? Mr. Hansen. We think that the way that the States are going to work with these grants, also the changes that were made in the reauthorization include a provision that States also have to focus the after-school programs on schools that are identified as needing improvement, and this is, we think, a better targeting of those school districts, to the schools within those school districts, that need the monies targeted for the after-school program. Senator Specter. Well, if you are talking about targeting, that could be the object of a discretionary program, as well, could it not? Mr. Hansen. Absolutely. Senator Specter. So I still do not understand the relevancy of your distinction between discretionary and State grants. Mr. Hansen. We think this gives States more control and more authority over how to spend their funds, and also by aligning the way that they are going to be approving the applications at the local district level to make sure that they are targeting those schools that are in need of improvement. Senator Specter. But does that say anything about the inadequacy or failure of the discretionary program? Mr. Hansen. No, sir. PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT FINDINGS IN EVALUATION Senator Specter. The studies show that, as summarized, that there was more parental involvement in the program. Is that an accurate conclusion from your preliminary studies? Mr. Hansen. Yes, sir. MATH PERFORMANCE FINDINGS IN EVALUATION Senator Specter. And it showed that math scores were at least slightly higher? Mr. Whitehurst. Yes, but we had very small numbers of children who were tested in math. But your conclusion is correct; math scores were slightly higher. Senator Specter. And that African American and Hispanic middle-school students had better grades, had less absenteeism and tardiness? Mr. Whitehurst. Those subgroups did better than other groups in the after-school program. Senator Specter. Is it not pretty important how it impacted on the Hispanic and African American students where there is customarily a greater concern about the quality of education? Mr. Whitehurst. We think that the subgroup analysis is very interesting and suggests an avenue to proceed, in terms of designing new programs. Clearly, there are subgroups that are likely to benefit. How one could structure a program so that it is particularly appealing to those subgroups and serves their needs would be an avenue for future development and research. MATHEMATICA STUDY OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS Senator Specter. Well, does not it also support the conclusion that it is a good program? Mr. Whitehurst. It is very difficult to go in after the fact, analyze for subgroups, and be sure that the effects would be the same as they are generalized to programs at large. This study, the study you are referring to, the Mathematica study, is a very carefully designed study in the context of typical research and education evaluation. It, for one thing, involved a randomization, which is very rare in education research. It also involved, at the middle-school level, a carefully matched comparison group. So it is one of the stronger studies we have available in the whole of the education evaluation literature, and it spoke generally to weak effects--no increases in reading scores, a slight increase in the possibility of drug involvement at the middle-school level--some positive effects, some negative effects; added up, all small in both directions and an overall sense that the program is simply not accomplishing what everyone hopes it would accomplish, at least in those sites that were studied. Senator Specter. Well, you have moved from the area where there had been improvement to your generalization of dissatisfaction. And your last answer identifies the difficulties of evaluation. And that is why, frankly, I am surprised that, when your studies are incomplete, you come in and want to reduce it from $933 million to $600 million. Your last answer articulates the difficulty of making an evaluation. And the evaluation is incomplete. Mr. Whitehurst. Well, my comments are intended to indicate that this is one of the strongest evaluations that exists in the education literature. There are a number of policy decisions that could be made with respect to a particular evaluation outcome. This study does not compel a budget reduction, but it is a very strong study, and I am here to speak to the qualities of the study and not to the budget decision. Senator Specter. Mr. Hansen or Mr. Whitehurst--we had heard you were not going to testify, Mr. Whitehurst, but we are glad to have you testify. Mr. Whitehurst. Thank you, sir. BENEFIT-TO-COST FINDINGS IN TWO AFTER-SCHOOL STUDIES Senator Specter. Are you familiar with the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, which found that after-school programs can yield a benefit-to-cost ratio to taxpayers and crime victims of $1.87 to $5.29 for every dollar spent? Mr. Whitehurst. I am aware of that conclusion, yes, sir. Senator Specter. And the Rose Institute study finds that quality after-school programs can reduce costs related to welfare, crime, and education, remedial services, and grade repetition, for an average net benefit of between $79,000-plus to $119,000-plus per participant? Mr. Whitehurst. Yes, sir, I am aware of that conclusion. CENTER FOR THE STUDY AND PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE Senator Specter. And are you aware of the studies, without detailing each of them, which have concluded that after-school programs assist students in achieving in school--most notably the conclusion drawn by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence? Mr. Whitehurst. I am aware of a number of studies that examine many of the---- Senator Specter. How about the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence? That is the question. Mr. Whitehurst. I am not sure of which study that is. I have probably read it, but I am not sure, Senator. Senator Specter. Well, would you take a look at it and tell us what---- Mr. Whitehurst. I would be pleased---- Senator Specter [continuing]. You think of it? Mr. Whitehurst. I would be pleased to. [The information follows:] Analysis of the Brandeis University Study of the After-School Quantum Opportunities Program, as Commented on by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence Below is the Department's brief analysis of the Brandeis University study, which is the basis for the comments by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence. The Center's statement on the Brandeis study's findings is followed by the Department's analysis of the study. STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``Participation in the Quantum Opportunities Program led to higher rates of graduation: 63 percent of participants graduated high school compared to 42 percent of the control group.''----Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence references a summary of a report by three researchers from Brandeis University of the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP). --The finding is from a study of a program that offers more expensive, different services from those offered through after- school programs.--QOP was a small demonstration program operating with approximately two and a half times the funding per student than a 21st CCLC program. It also paid cash incentives to participants for various accomplishments and to staff based on student participation hours. --Methodological problems with the study.--Although originally the study was a random assignment design, the study appeared to include follow-up information only for a subset of the originally selected study participants who remained in the program (Hahn, Andrew, Tom Leavitt, and Paul Aaron. ``Evaluation of the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP). Did the Program Work? A Report of the Post Secondary Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of the QOP Program (1989-93).'' Waltham, MA: Brandeis University, Heller Graduate School, Center for Human Resources, 1994: p. 2). Not following the full sample of study participants invalidates the random assignment design. To the extent that program participants who benefit less from the program are more likely to be those who dropped out of the program, the estimated benefits from this study are exaggerated. DISCUSSION OF TWO AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM BENEFIT-COST STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE WASHINGTON STATE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY, AND THE ROSE INSTITUTE In addition, the Department has included a brief analysis of the two studies conducted by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, and the Rose Institute--discussed during the hearing--which looked at the cost-effectiveness of after-school programs. Both of these benefit-cost analysis studies are either based on studies that are not of after-school programs or of studies where long-term follow- ups of services provided were so long ago--the early 1940s or early 1960s--that their relevance to today's programs is at least questionable (the Perry Preschool study and the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study). A brief description and discussion of the two cited benefit-cost analysis studies follows: STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``The Washington State Institute for Public Policy finds that effective after-school programs can yield a benefit-to-cost ratio to taxpayers and crime victims of $1.87 to $5.29 for every dollar spent.''----The Washington State Institute for Public Policy Discussion and Analysis The calculated benefit-to-cost ratios cited here are based on evaluation studies of three programs--the Quantum Opportunities Program, the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program, and the Cambridge- Somerville Youth Study, as well as the estimates of cost implications based on the criminal justice system operating in Washington State. --Estimates are based on programs that offer different services from those offered by after-school programs.--The Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP) is an intensive comprehensive service program including mentoring for youth. The other two are mentoring programs. In contrast, after-school programs are offered in group settings with typical student to staff ratios of 10:1. Therefore, attributing the benefits found in these studies to typical after-school programs is likely to misstate the likely benefits of after-school programs. --Estimates only compare one program to another.--The intention of the report was to provide relative costs and benefits of various programs. The authors caution about using such results as actual dollar benefits--``it is probably more useful to compare [the] results from one program to another, rather than solely focusing on the absolute value of any particular benefit-to-cost ratio.'' (Aos, Steve, Polly Phipps, Robert Barnoski, and Roxanne Lieb. ``The Comparative Costs and Benefits of Programs to Reduce Crime. Version 4.0.'' Olympia, WA: Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2001: p. 3). STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``The Rose Institute finds that quality after-school programs can reduce costs related to welfare, crime, and education (remediation services and grade repetition) for an average net benefit of between $79,484 and $119,427 per participant.''----Rose Institute Discussion and Analysis The calculated benefit-to-cost ratios cited here are primarily based on two evaluation studies--the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP) and the Perry Preschool Project. --Estimates are based on programs that offer different services from those offered through after-school programs. QOP was a demonstration program providing intensive services to a small number of high school students. The Perry Preschool project provided a high quality active preschool environment for 3 to 4 year olds. --Imprecise benefit estimates. Most of the estimated benefits in this report originate from estimated increased lifetime income and estimated benefits associated with estimated reduced crime-- both of which are difficult to estimate with much precision or credibility. ACADEMIC GAINS OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS Senator Specter. How about the study by Gansk & Associates reporting gains in standardized test scores and reading and math were greater for students participating in after-school programs than for comparable students according to a study of 19 elementary schools in five States? Are you familiar with that study? Mr. Whitehurst. I do not have that one in front of me. I would have to check, again, to give you my reaction to it. Senator Specter. Does not come to mind. Mr. Whitehurst. It does not come to mind, sir. LA'S BEST AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM EVALUATION Senator Specter. Uh-huh. And how about the UCLA Center for the Study of Evaluation? In the initial year of study, LA's BEST students began with the math achievement scores that were significantly lower than nonparticipants. After long-term participation in the after-school programs, these students increased their test scores to be comparable to their peers. Familiar with that one? Mr. Whitehurst. I am very aware of that study, yes, sir. Senator Specter. Is there some defect in that study that would lead you to disagree with its conclusion? Mr. Whitehurst. Most of the studies that have addressed after-school programs are flawed in the following respect. Senator Specter. Well, I do not want to hear about most. Mr. Whitehurst. I will talk to you about this one then, as an example---- Senator Specter. That is what I would like to hear. Mr. Whitehurst [continuing]. As an example of a flaw that is present in many of the studies like this. Senator Specter. Well, now---- Mr. Whitehurst. The flaw---- Senator Specter [continuing]. I am interested in this study---- Mr. Whitehurst. I am responding to the question, sir. Senator Specter [continuing]. And if you could respond to flaws in it, as to this study. DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM OUTCOMES OF EVALUATION SUBSETS Mr. Whitehurst. I am glad to respond simply to this study then, Senator. Senator Specter. Thank you. Mr. Whitehurst. The problem with the L.A.'s BEST study is that it examines the differences between children who were long-term participants in the after-school program and compares the findings for those children with children at large in the district or children who were similar to children who entered the program in the initial years. So there is a comparison between a small subset of children, who chose, either because of their own interests or the interests of their parents, to participate over an extended period of time, over a period of years, with the outcomes of children who never volunteered for an after-school program and did not participate. It is a very awkward and potentially misleading comparison. If you, Senator, were out looking for a diet program--you would not need one; I might add--and I asked the diet program how participants in the program do, and the diet program said: ``Well, those people who participate in our program for 5 years lose a lot of weight.'' That would not, for me, be a compelling comparison. I would like to know how people, in general, the typical customer of that program, performs. That is the question that has to be asked for after-school programs. How does the average, the typical, child who enrolled in the program do compared to similar children who did not enroll, and that comparison is not present in the L.A. BEST program. Senator Specter. Would that critique apply to your studies? Mr. Whitehurst. No, it would not. MATHEMATICA, INC. FINDINGS ON TARDINESS AND MATH SCORES Senator Specter. Are you familiar with the study of Mathematica, Inc., which concluded that after participating in a 21st Century Community Learning Center programs, its black and Hispanic students reduced tardiness to class and increased math scores compared to nonparticipants? Mr. Whitehurst. Yes, I am aware of that. Senator Specter. Do you disagree with those conclusions? Mr. Whitehurst. I do not disagree with the conclusions. The conclusions---- Senator Specter. Is there some problem---- Mr. Whitehurst [continuing]. Are there---- Senator Specter. Is there some problem with that study? Mr. Whitehurst. The problem is the subgroup analysis. There was no directly comparable group among the nonparticipants. So it is a very promising finding. It is not a conclusive finding. Senator Specter. It is a very what? Mr. Whitehurst. A very promising finding, something we certainly need to follow up on. Senator Specter. Would you do that? Mr. Whitehurst. We are planning on doing that, yes, sir. Senator Specter. Uh-huh. If you have enough subgroups, Mr. Whitehurst, do you not have a pretty solid basis for a generalized conclusion? Mr. Whitehurst. If you have enough subgroups, you have a pretty good basis for a finding that some of those subgroups do better than other of the subgroups, and that is the problem with the subgroup analysis. Once you start---- Senator Specter. Well, but if you had---- Mr. Whitehurst [continuing]. Going in and trying to look for findings in particular subgroups, you are likely to find them for some of those groups, and it is very difficult to know whether that would replicate. That is why it is a very interesting and encouraging finding that we are very intent on following up. NRC FINDINGS AND SCHOOL-SPONSORED ACTIVITIES PARTICIPATION Senator Specter. Are you familiar with the National Research Council, which found students who reported spending no time in school-sponsored activities after school versus students spending 1 to 4 hours in such activities were 57 percent more likely to have dropped out before reaching 12th grade? Mr. Whitehurst. I am aware of that, Senator. It would probably be the same finding for participation in sports or music or anything else. Kids who choose to participate in activities compared to those who do not are likely to finish school, do better in terms of grades, and a number of other factors, which represents differences in the motivation and background and interest of children who are voluntary participants versus children who do not avail themselves of opportunities that are present at school. Senator Specter. Well, the subcommittee would like you to give us an analysis of those programs without further questioning at this time---- Mr. Whitehurst. Thank you, I would be pleased to do that. Senator Specter [continuing]. And compare them to the studies which you have undertaken. [The information follows:] Analysis of the Findings of Six Studies on After-School Programs Overall, we find that the studies cited at the Congressional hearing on May 13, 2003, do not provide scientifically based evidence of effectiveness of after-school programs. First, some of the cited studies are not of after-school programs. Second, most of the studies did not use scientifically rigorous methods and thus the results cannot be reliably attributed to participation in the program. Other factors, such as student or family background characteristics, could result in the outcome differences between participants and non-participants. In some cases, the researchers of the original reports openly discussed the limitations of the methods they used, cautioning readers about placing too much weight on the findings. Below is the Department's response to Senator Specter's request to provide a brief analysis of a list of study findings on after-school programs. 1. STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``Gains in standardized test scores in reading and math were greater for students participating in after-school programs than for comparable students, according to a study of 19 elementary schools in five states.''----Gansk & Associates Discussion and Analysis The statement refers to a report on the Foundations After-School Enrichment Program (Klein, Stephen, and Roger Bolus. ``Improvements in Math and Reading Scores of Students Who Did and Did Not Participate in the Foundations After School Enrichment Program During the 2001-2002 School Year.'' Santa Monica, CA: GANSK & Associates, 2002). --Study design is not scientifically rigorous.--The authors calculate test score gains for a small number of program participants and nonparticipants at the same schools in five counties in which this program operates. The study design is seriously flawed constructing an inappropriate group of students for comparison. Since the unsophisticated analyses fail to account for potentially important differences between participants and non- participants (e.g., initial test score differences and likely motivational differences since the non-participants elected not to participate in the program even though it was available), the findings cannot be attributed to participation in the program. 2. STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``In the initial year of study, LA's BEST students began with math achievement scores that were significantly lower than non-participants. After long-term participation in the after-school program, these students increased their test scores to be comparable to their peers.''----UCLA Center for the Study of Evaluation Discussion and Analysis This is an evaluation of a single program, LA's BEST after-school program, with two reports conducted by the Center for the Study of Evaluation at the University of California at Los Angeles (Brooks, Pauline E., Cynthia M. Mojica, and Robert E. Land. ``Final Evaluation Report. Longitudinal Study of LA's BEST After School Education and Enrichment Program, 1992-94.'' Los Angeles, CA: Center for the Study of Evaluation, UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, 1995; Huang, Denise, Barry Gribbons, Kyung Sung Kim, Charlotte Lee, and Eva L. Baker. ``A Decade of Results: The Impact of the LA's BEST After School Enrichment Program on Subsequent Student Achievement and Performance.'' Los Angeles, CA: UCLA Center for the Study of Evaluation, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, 2000). --Study design is not scientifically rigorous.--The 1995 study compares a select sample of 130 students: a nonrandom sample of program participants with 66 students who participated in the program for less than 3 months and left the program. The 2000 study compares a group (an unspecified number) of program participants with those who elected not to participate in the program (even though it was available to them). Constructing groups for comparison in these manners results in likely group differences that are unmeasurable and thus unable to be taken into consideration in the analyses. Therefore, the findings in both reports cannot be attributed to participation in the program. --Study findings are mixed and incomplete.--Both reports, but particularly the more recent report, lack proper documentation (e.g., response rates, sample size, full reporting of findings, and details of analysis techniques) that is routinely reported in high-quality research. In the 1995 report, the findings were sensitive to estimation method (LA's BEST participants scored lower than the comparison group when one method was used, and an alternative method showed opposite findings). The first method ``controlled for length of time the students attended the program and statistically adjusted the before program' performances of both groups of students . . . this analysis yielded little in the way of encouraging results. The only significant effects were associated with ethnicity and gender'' (Brooks et al. 1995:13). With this method, LA's BEST students had lower grades than the control group in all areas. The second method ``controlled for initial differences by eliminating outliers'--students who had unusually high or low performances--from both groups'' (Brooks et al. 1995:14). With this method, LA's BEST students had higher grades than the control group in all areas. 3. STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``After participating in the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, black and Hispanic students reduced tardiness to class and increased math scores compared to non-participants.''--Mathematica, Inc. Discussion and Analysis This is one select finding from the Department's evaluation of the 21st CCLC program conducted by Mathematica Policy Research. As mentioned at the hearing, this is a promising subgroup finding among many other findings for the program that indicate, on average, the program fails to demonstrate effectiveness. Due to the nature of statistics, given enough different outcomes, it is possible to find one or two findings or a single subgroup that is statistically significant. It is impossible at this point without further data and additional studies to know the importance and reliability of this finding. 4. STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``Students who reported spending no time in a school-sponsored activity (after school) versus students spending 4 hours in such activities were 57 percent more likely to have dropped out before reaching the 12th grade.''----National Research Council Discussion and Analysis This finding is based on analyses of the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) a longitudinal survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (Zill, Nicholas, Christine W. Nord, and Laura S. Loomis. ``Adolescent Time Use, Risky Behavior, and Outcomes: An Analysis of National Data.'' Rockville, MD: Westat, 1995). --Finding not related to after-school programs.--This finding is based on sophisticated analytical techniques to investigate high school student responses to the question: ``In a typical week, how much total time do you spend on all SCHOOL-SPONSORED extracurricular activities.'' Inclusion of activities such as band, orchestra, and organized sports clearly indicates that responses were not necessarily referencing after-school programs. --Study also includes negative findings.--Although the statement highlights a positive finding, the study also found that students who participated in particular extracurricular activities actually increased their chances that they would engage in certain risky behaviors. 5. REPORTED SOURCE Sacramento START program--two reports by Minicucci Associates-- (Minicucci, Catherine. ``Students Today Achieving Results for Tomorrow: Evaluation Report for START 1999/2000.'' Sacramento, CA: Minicucci Associates, August 2001. Minicucci, Catherine. ``Students Today Achieving Results for Tomorrow: Evaluation Report for START 2000/ 2001.'' Minicucci Associates, Sacramento, California. October 2001.) Discussion and Analysis The evaluation compared data on program participants for which there was test score data for the school years 1999-2000 and 1998-99. --Study design is not scientifically rigorous.--All analyses are based only on program participants. With such a design, it is impossible to determine whether program participants fared better or worse than they would have without the program. Because students generally improve their academic proficiency with an additional year of schooling, any gain in test scores could reflect normal progress. --Reported findings are mixed.--Reported results indicated that participant math scores increased while participant reading scores declined between the two school years. 6. STATEMENT AND REPORTED SOURCE ``Participation in the Quantum Opportunities Program led to higher rates of graduation: 63 percent of participants graduated high school compared to 42 percent of the control group.''----Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence Discussion and Analysis The Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence references a summary of a report by three researchers from Brandeis University of the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP). --The finding is from a study of a program that offers more expensive, different services from those offered through after- school programs.--QOP was a small demonstration program operating with approximately two and a half times the funding per student than a 21st CCLC program. It also paid cash incentives to participants for various accomplishments and to staff based on student participation hours. --Methodological problems with the study.--Although originally the study was a random assignment design, the study appeared to include follow-up information only for a subset of the originally selected study participants who remained in the program (Hahn, Andrew, Tom Leavitt, and Paul Aaron. ``Evaluation of the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP). Did the Program Work? A Report of the Post Secondary Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of the QOP Program (1989-93).'' Waltham, MA: Brandeis University, Heller Graduate School, Center for Human Resources, 1994: p. 2). Not following the full sample of study participants invalidates the random assignment design. To the extent that program participants who benefit less from the program are more likely to be those who dropped out of the program, the estimated benefits from this study are exaggerated. Senator Specter. Okay, thank you very much. Mr. Hansen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Specter. The subcommittee would now be pleased to hear from Senator Barbara Boxer. Good morning, Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer. Good morning, Senator. Senator Specter. Thank you for joining us. STATEMENT OF SENATOR BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. It is wonderful to be here with you. Senator Specter. We are going to turn on the lights for you, like we do for everybody, if---- Senator Boxer. Yes, that is fine. Senator Specter [continuing]. That is satisfactory. Senator Boxer. I will not--I will endeavor to stick within the time. If I go over, it will be a mini-go-over. So let me, first of all, thank you for the last 7 years, you have been working with me and others in a bipartisan way. I want to start off by thanking you, because for the last 7 years you have worked with me and others in a bipartisan way to make after-school something that we do here, that we do well here, and that we can assist the States and the local school districts in doing. I want to just--because I was so interested in the first panel and your questioning of them, I wanted to ask if I might put in the record an executive summary of a report that was done on the Sacramento START Program, just the executive summary. Senator Specter. Certainly, without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] Supporting Student Achievement: Evaluation Report for START 2000/2001 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The is a summary of the 2000/2001 evaluation of the START after school program, an innovative regional after school program operated by the City of Sacramento in collaboration with the County of Sacramento and six area school districts. The evaluation includes findings on student learning and attendance, findings from student interviews, and results of staff focus groups. The evaluation team would like to express its appreciation to the school district staff who assisted in the gathering of the information on student learning and attendance needed for this report. Highlights Include --Student learning gains in math (3 NCE points) with higher gains for English --Language Learners (4 NCE points) --Slight decline in reading (1 NCE point) for all students and English speakers and no change in reading for English Language Learners --Attendance improvement for students who missed 10 or more days of school in the previous year: 4.7 fewer absent days in the year they were in START compared to the previous year --Steady gain in math achievement over two years for students followed for two years --Improved attendance for students in the program for two years with improved attendance evident in the first year of START continued into the second year. 2.2 fewer days absent over two years. For problem attenders there was a two year decline in days missed of school of 6.2 days Background START was founded in 1995 with 18 elementary schools in five districts. In 2000/2001, the program involved six school districts and 32 elementary schools. START programs on school sites served 3,820 students in grades 1-6 in 2000/2001. The total number of participants by site range from 52 to 359 students, with an average of 119 students. Participating elementary schools serve low income neighborhoods. The City of Sacramento Department of Neighborhood Services serves as the fiscal agent for the program, employs and trains staff, and prepares reports to funders. The schools and districts provide space for the program on elementary school campuses, collaborate on curriculum planning and support the program financially with matching funds. In the 2000/2001 school year, the following districts participated in Sacramento START. The number of elementary schools in the program within each district are in parentheses: Del Paso Heights School District (1), Elk Grove Unified School District (1), Natomas School District (2), North Sacramento School District (4), Rio Linda Union School District (3) and Sacramento City Unified School District (21). Evaluation Methods The evaluation consultant selected 1,200 students in grades 3 through 6 who had participated at least 30 days in START in February and March of 2001. State requirements for evaluation call for a comparison between student achievement and attendance in the program year (2000/2001) compared to the previous year (1999/2000)The evaluators researched school district records and found that 748 of these students had complete SAT9 testing information for spring 2000 and spring 2001 and 705 students had complete attendance information for the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 school years. The evaluation group in 2000/2001 included 227 students who were included in last year's evaluation for the 1999/2000 report, Achieving Results. A separate analysis of results for these 227 students enabled the evaluation to examine the impact of START on students who remain in the program two consecutive years. The state also asks local programs to administer four interview question to students as they begin the program and at the end of the program. These four questions about student behavior and connection to school are also used in the federal government's 21st Century Learning Community evaluation of federally funded after school programs. Preparing the 2000/2001 evaluation report was a collaborative effort between the evauation team, school district staff, and START staff. During the process, the school district staff expressed a desire for additional analyses by district and school and potential for comparison groups of non participating START students. The extent of district staff involvement and engagement with the evaluation has grown over the past six months as Minicucci Associates have prepared two evaluation reports for the program under state guidelines. District preferences and desires for enhancements for the evaluation analysis have become more prominent in the 2000/2001 study and will become even more apparent in the 2001/2002 evaluation next fall. Findings The 748 students in the evaluation group were more female (54 percent) than male (44 percent). (For 2 percent of sample students, gender was unknown.) Younger students were more heavily represented that upper grade students in the program. Third graders comprised 30 percent of the students, fourth graders were 33 percent, 24 percent were in the fifth grade and 13 percent were in the sixth grade. Ethnically, the students were diverse with 29 percent Hispanic, 27 percent African American, 23 percent Asian, 15 percent White and the remaining 1 percent other. For 5 percent of sample students, ethnicity information was not available. Slightly over one third of the students (34 percent) were English Language Learners and spoke a language other than English. Major languages represented included: Spanish (45 percent), Hmong (31 percent), Hindi (7 percent), Mien (5 percent) and Chinese (5 percent) (both Mandarin and Cantonese.) 1. Student Learning Outcomes on SAT9 Overall, the average results on SAT9 reading for the 748 students showed a 1 point decline between 1999/2000 and 2000/2001. In math there was a 3 NCE point gain. Both changes were statistically significant. English Language Learners remained stead in math with no gain or loss in NCE points in spring 2001. English speakers lost 1 NCE point in reading. In math, English Language Learners gained 4 NCE points compared to English speakers who gained 2 NCE points. These findings are similar to those in the 1999/2000 report on START: English Language Learners make greater achievement test gains and all students do better in math than in reading on the standardized tests. The state requests districts to examine growth in learning for students in the bottom 25 percentile rank or quartile. For reading, 37 percent of START students were in the bottom quartile in 1999/2000 and 20 percent of those students moved up to a higher achievement level out of the 25th percentile rank in spring 2001. In math, 30 percent were in the bottom quartile in 1999/2000 and 42 percent of those students moved up in spring 2001 to higher quartiles in math achievement. Overall, there were 2 percent more students in the bottom quartile in reading in spring 2001 than in spring 2000. In math, there were 31 percent of students in the bottom quartile in spring 2000 and 24 percent in spring 2001, a drop of 7 percentage points. English Language Learners showed a 1 percent drop in the proportion scoring in the lowest quartile in reading and a 10 percent drop in the lowest quartile in math. English speakers showed a 3 percentage point gain in the lowest quartile in reading and a 6 percent drop in the lowest quartile in math between spring 2000 and spring 2001. Turning to the group of 227 returning START students who were in last year's report, they showed steady gains in math while continuing to struggle in reading. In reading, the students declined 2 NCE points between spring 1999 and spring 2001. In math, the students gained 4 NCE points between spring 1999 and spring 2001. Low performing students in this group did slightly better than the 748 evaluation group students as a whole. In the spring of 2000, 38 percent of the returning group was in the lowest reading quartile and 28 percent was in the lowest math quartile. When the students were tested in the spring of 2001, 22 percent moving out of the lowest performing cartel in reading and 45 percent moving out of the lowest quartile in math. 2. Student Attendance Students in START in the 2000/2001 school year showed a small improvement in overall school attendance compared to the 1999/2000 school year: from 5.5 days missed to 5.4 days missed for 0.1 fewer absent days. In missing fewer than 10 days of school, these children can be characterized overall as good attenders. Students who had been problem attenders in the previous year, missing 10 or more days of school showed a dramatic gain in attendance and a reduction in days absent, dropping from 14.8 days absent to 10.1 days, a reduction of 4.7 days absent. These children got five more days of instruction in the year they particpated in START. The group of 227 returning START students showed improved attendance in the first year they were in START and that that improvement continued into the second year. These students missed 7.3 days in 1998/1999, 5 days in 1999/2000 and 5.1 days in 2000/2001 or a two year drop in days absent of 2.2 days. The problem attenders missing 10 or more days of school went from 15.9 days absent in 1998/99 to 9.8 days to 9.7 days absent in 2000/2001. Their two year drop in days absent was 6.2 days. These results suggest that students who continue in START sustain their improved attendance over a two year period. By attending more days in school, these children have more opportunity to learn academic content. 3. Student Interviews Students in federal and state funded after school programs are asked four questions at the start and end of the program. A total of 76 responses to the pre and post questions for participants in START were gathered, about 10 percent of the achievement test sample for 2000/ 2001. The children are asked: ``In the past 30 days --How often have you wanted to go to school? --How often have you studied for a test? --How often have you felt unsafe at school? --How often has your mom, dad or guardian talked to you about school or homework?'' In general, the pre-tests show that the START students like going to school, about two thirds of them reported studying hard for a test in the past month, almost 60 percent report never feeling unsafe at school and 45 percent speak with their parent or guardian daily about school. On the post test, the proportion of children wanting to go to school dropped, as did the proportion reporting they studied hard for a test in the past month. About the same number as on the pre-test reported feeling safe always at school on the post test. A higher proportion, over half, reported speaking daily with their parent or guardian about school on the post test. 4. Focus Groups With START Staff The evaluation team conducted end-of-the-year reflection discussions with 25 Site Directors and 5 Regional Directors in May 2001. Staff related their pride in START as a safe alternative for children after school, providing reliable after school care for parents to enable them to work. This is particularly helpful for families coming off of welfare. Milestones in the 2000/2001 school year included: involving high school students as tutors and mentors in a science program, participation in 4H Cooperative Extension enrichment activities, UC Davis ``Steps to College'' program at eight START sites, the Grant High School art and garden project at four START schools and a special nutrition program at eleven START sites. START also participated in the Sacramento County Fair ``Chicken in the Egg'' contest in which student efforts resulted in 47 blue ribbons for the program. Site Directors report that many of the children they work with in START need support services: basic needs like food and clothing, social services or health services. They also report that students come into the program often are tired and in need of some fun, a snack and a break. They feel the kids need a break to unwind so it is very hard to launch immediately into academic program content with them when they start the after school program. The largest challenges for Site Directors and Regional Directors is turnover in Program Leaders. The need to train new Program Leaders during the school year is time consuming for Site Directors. All staff voiced the belief that consistent, well trained after school program staff is key to ensuring a high quality program. Many Site Directors were previously Program Leaders or school aides so they bring valuable experience to their assignment in START. Successful strategies for training staff include shadowing experienced START staff, observing skilled classroom teachers during the school day and having classroom teachers observe the new hires and offer suggestions. Site Directors and Regional Directors feel that a lower staff/child ratio (lower than the current 20:1) and higher hourly pay would be desirable. A key requirement of START is the need to collaboratively share classroom space with teachers at each site. In about half of the schools, staff report that the relationships have been carefully worked out. In the other half, the challenge continues of trying to operate a program in space that is used during the day by the regular faculty of the school. START staff felt that regular communication between the START staff and the school faculty would help bridge the gap. START staff feel pressure to advance academic learning of students, particularly in literacy. Students want, more music and art which is often lacking in the regular school day. Staff expressed frustration with the pressure to stress reading with students who crave enrichment and fun. The challenge is how to make reading fun and worthwhile for students. START staff offered a number of concrete suggestions for strengthening the program, including adding more enrichment opportunities and field trips. Site directors would like a parent volunteer component integrated into the program. Site Directors appreciated the opportunity to reflect together and requested that this discussion opportunity be repeated on a regular basis. Quarterly reflection discussions will be continued in the 2001/2002 school year with evaluation team members facilitating the discussion. ``In established START sites, students tell their teachers what they're doing in START, their homework gets completed and the teachers learn the value of the program directly from the children.''---- Site Director ``Get college students to be Program Leaders in START, especially those who want to be teachers. START could be a laboratory for people who want to work with kids.''----Site Director THE SACRAMENTO START PROGRAM Senator Boxer. That was outsourced to a group called Minicucci Associates, and they did this report. And without going into too much time on the findings, they said, ``START fosters enthusiasm for learning by engaging children in fun, literacy-focused activities in a safe and caring environment. START expands the school day and supports district goals.'' And then they actually quantify the increase in learning, Mr. Chairman, compared to the kids who do not go, which was one of the things, criteria, that was laid out here. So thank you for allowing me to do that. I want to start off by showing you an ad that ran in yesterday's New York Times and USA Today and all over the country, ``It is 3 p.m. Do you know where your kids are?'' I have to just go up so I get this right. The Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is an arm of this administration, and what a wonderful ad this is, I might say. It really caught my attention, and I think everybody who would see it, on a big, you know, newspaper page, blank except for that. And it goes into saying how kids can get in trouble. So it seems like an anomaly to me, Mr. Chairman, that while the administration is working hard to give this message to parents, how important it is they know where their kids are; on the other hand, we are looking at deep cuts in after-school. And I wanted to point that out, because I think those two things are contradictory. FISCAL YEAR 2004 BUDGET REQUEST I also just wanted to quickly show you the numbers. I know you know them, but for the record, make it really simple as to where we are, with your help, again on a bipartisan basis, and I was able to write the authorization bill with Senator Ensign, who has a very compelling story about his life as a kid and the fact that he did not have a dad in the home and that he got in a lot of trouble as a kid and that he feels very strongly that our children need to be protected and need to be accounted for. And he teamed up with me, and we were able to get so much support. And we are up to the billion-dollar level this year. The Bush proposal, as you noted, would take this down a huge amount, 40 percent. That means the number of children kicked out of the program, 570,000. So, I mean, if you hold up, again, that first chart, Liz--thank you for being such a wonderful helper--we are going to have 570,000 kids, if we do not do something about that number, who are now unaccounted for. It makes things worse. Now, the next chart I wanted to show you is where we should be under the Leave No Child Left Behind Act, which our President signed and we all, so many of us, supported. Under that bill, we should be, in 2004, at 1.75 billion. And, again, taking that where it is, it will wind up--if we were to fully fund it, we would be taking care of a 1,600,000 more children. It is a pretty stark cut, and I think that your questioning, which I followed closely, and your prodding, was essentially this is a pretty deep cut when we do not really have the final studies. And, Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to place my entire statement in the record, and I am going to---- Senator Specter. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator Boxer [continuing]. And I am going to try to finish this in 1 or 2 minutes at the most. L.A.'S BEST AND SACRAMENTO START: AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS I have gone all over the State to look at these programs, from L.A.'s BEST to Sacramento START. Those are very large programs. There are also smaller programs. And I have seen the kids, and I see the look in their faces, and I talk to their parents. And I know what these programs have meant to these families. Our studies show the kids do better. But you know what, Mr. Chairman? You can see. You can see it when you look at the kids, how good they feel about themselves and how motivated they are to do their homework, because they have support there. I have here two stories. I only have time to read one. And this is a young man from L.A.'s BEST. Let me make sure I get the right story. As a first-grader at Langdon Elementary School in North Hills, Mauricio faced the strong possibility that his lifestyle would be one of gangs, crimes, drugs, and violence. Instead, he became one of the first participants in L.A.'s BEST after-school program when he was in the first grade. Through L.A.'s BEST, Mauricio came into contact with police officers, tutors, and others, who gave them an alternative to gang life. Mauricio continued to be a part of L.A.'s BEST by working at the Langdon site all through high school. He said: ``I saw a lot of young people doing drugs and crime and dying when I was growing up. But today I am the first member of my family to attend college.'' And after graduation he plans to become a teacher because: ``Young people need someone to look up to and someone to help them. I want to give them what people gave to me.'' So we can talk numbers, and we should, and we must, and we have to, but this is real. And I know when I talked to you about this, you really said to me: ``Senator, I want to work with you on this.'' I hope, Mr. Chairman, through your efforts and that of Senator Harkin and other Members of the Committee, that we can take a stand for our children. PREPARED STATEMENT And my final word is this. In the 1970s, I had little kids, and I started to work part-time, and I realized there was no after-school program. We worked, we set up an after-school program in the Kentfield Unified School District in a suburban area. It is still going strong today, and the people think it is just the best. It is a sliding scale, because some people can afford to pay more than others. Bottom line, it works for our children, and that is what our country is really all about. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your leadership on this. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Barbara Boxer Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here today. I would first like to bring to your attention an advertisement printed in the New York Times yesterday. One arm of the federal government, the Administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy agrees that afterschool programs keep kids safe and away from drugs. A full-page advertisement from the Drug Control Policy Office states that ``kids involved in after school activities are less likely to use drugs.'' Meanwhile, based on one study on afterschool programs conducted for the Department of Education, the President's Budget has proposed a $400 million cut to afterschool programs because the President concluded that afterschool programs do not work . If Congress goes along with the Administration's proposed funding cut, 570,000 kids already in programs will be turned out onto the streets. This deep, unprecedented cut would leave lots of children behind after school--not just leave them behind, but leave them home alone or leave them to join a gang. However, this is not even the full story. In 2001, I teamed up with Senator John Ensign in offering an amendment to the No Child Left Behind bill to authorize funding for afterschool programs. It passed the Senate 60-39--the first afterschool amendment ever to pass the Senate on a roll call vote. As enacted, authorized funding for afterschool programs increases $250 million each year until it reaches $2.5 billion by 2007. This would cover 4 million kids. By not funding afterschool programs at the level promised--$1.75 billion--1.6 million children will be left behind [Chart 3]. We cannot let this happen. A bipartisan letter that I circulated--signed by 3 Democrats and 3 Republicans--was recently sent to you Mr. Chairman, urging full funding of afterschool programs. The federal afterschool program is vital to so many children and families across America. I would like take a moment to share just two stories of the millions of stories. As a first grader at Langdon Elementary School in North Hills, Mauricio faced the strong possibility that his lifestyle would be one of gangs, crime, drugs and violence. Instead, he became one of the first participants in LA's BEST afterschool program when he was in the first grade. Through LA's BEST, Mauricio came into contact with police officers, tutors and others who gave him an alternative to gang life. Mauricio continued to be a part of LA's Best by working at the Langdon site all through high school. Mauricio said, ``I saw a lot of young people doing drugs and crime and dying [when I was growing up] but today, I am the first member of my family to attend college.'' After graduation from college, Mauricio plans to be a teacher because ``young people need someone to look up to and someone to help them-I want to give them what people gave to me.'' A second story: Jerry had received several written warnings for his behavior during the regular school day. During a parent conference, it was discovered that problems existed at home, too. Jerry was ``hanging'' with gang members and beginning to act like them--and he was only 10-years old. Rallying their resources, his concerned parents began to work with the LA's Best site coordinator and school staff to ensure close supervision of Jerry while he was on the playground (where his gang member friends would be looking for him). Family counseling and increased emphasis on academics were also part of the plan. Soon Jerry was involved in computer and geometry classes, the science club and the LA's Best sports program, where he led his teams to several tournaments. LA's Best kept Jerry off the streets and out of a gang. But it's more than these 2 examples. Dozens of respected, independent studies--some of them going into great depth and conducted over many years--confirm that afterschool programs keep children safe, reduce crime and drug use, and improve academic performance. For example, an evaluation of the Sacramento START afterschool program compared students who participated in afterschool programs and those who did not. Among students who were low performing in reading and writing on state tests, those who participated in afterschool programs improved their scores 3 times greater than those who did not participate. Mr. Chairman, I have visited some 20 afterschool programs all around California, from LA's Best to Sacramento Start, to programs in San Diego and San Francisco, among many others. I have talked with students, parents, and instructors to understand how to give every child the best quality experiences after the school bell rings. When doing so, it is obvious how important afterschool programs are to keeping our children safe, keeping them out of gangs, and keeping them off drugs. As the Senate begins working on this year's appropriations bills, I hope that you will get us back on track to fully funding afterschool programs. Finally, I would like to mention another Californian who has become a tireless advocate for afterschool programs. Since accepting the National Chair of ``Lights on Afterschool'' in 2001, Arnold Swartzeneggar has brought attention to the importance of afterschool programs throughout California and across country. I am so pleased to see him here today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Boxer, for your devotion to this very important cause. We appreciate your testimony. Senator Boxer. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. Senator Specter. Thank you. INTRODUCTION OF SECOND-PANEL WITNESSES We will now turn to our second panel, Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mayor John DeStefano, Mr. Harvey Sprafka, Mr. Steven Kinlock, and Ms. Madison White. If you would all come forward. STATEMENT OF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, NATIONAL CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL INNER-CITY GAMES FOUNDATION Senator Specter. As you are being seated, I will introduce our first witness, Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has appeared in many blockbuster films, including The Terminator, True Lies, Kindergarten Cop, Twins, won numerous body-building awards from Mr. Europe, Junior, to Mr. World, three times winner of the Mr. Universe competition, and an unprecedented seven-time Mr. Olympia champion. During President Bush's administration, he has served as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He is the founder and national chairman of the Inner-City Games Foundation, which is currently operating a program called Arnold's All Stars, an after-school program offering academic, recreational, and cultural enrichment programs for middle schools in California. He received his business degree from the University of Wisconsin. Mr. Schwarzenegger, thank you for your leadership in this field, and thank you for joining us today. And thank you for drawing this big crowd. Mr. Schwarzenegger. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman and honorable members of the subcommittee, it is an honor to be here today to discuss one of my greatest passions, improving the lives of children. That is the reason that I am here today, to advocate for continued funding of the 21st Century Learning Grant Program. There are many problems in the world today. And given enough time and my Terminator-like determination, I might be able to tackle them all. Nevertheless, I have chosen to focus my time and energy for the past quarter century on our children, because they are, quite literally, our future. Ronald Reagan so eloquently told us, ``America is the shining city on the hill. Welcome all who enter to follow their dreams.'' There is no greater American dream than to hope that our children will live a better life. A better life for our children can only happen with a good education, and educating our children should not stop at 3 p.m. when the school bell rings. For millions of American children, this is exactly what happens. Law enforcement, teachers, parents, and students know that between 3 and 6 p.m. is the danger zone for our kids. This is the time when our children are most likely to become victims of violent crimes, more likely to use drugs, abuse tobacco and alcohol, get pregnant, or commit violent crimes themselves. I was lucky growing up. I had two parents who kept me on the straight and narrow 24 hours a day. Every day when I came home, my mother was there to greet me at the door. She sat down with me, helped me with my homework, made me read out loud until I got every word just right. Only after my homework was finished I could go outside, where my dad or a coach would take over my instruction and take me skiing, sledding, ice skating, or work on my ice-curling techniques or soccer kick or whatever sport was in season. The bottom line is that there was someone there for me 24 hours a day, coaching me, teaching me, mentoring me, telling me that they loved me, and always reminding me that I can turn any dream that I have into reality. It was this foundation that built my self-confidence, enabled me to achieve so much in my life. When I came to America in 1968, I had empty pockets, but I was full of dreams, desire, and determination. I believed that I could accomplish anything I set my mind to, a belief that has strengthened with time. I became the world champion 13 times over. I have made dozens of successful movies, grossing billions of dollars worldwide. I became successful in real estate and in the business world. I took English classes at night until I spoke and wrote well enough to earn a bachelor degree. I make these points not to share with you my life's accomplishments, but, more importantly, to make the point that none of this, absolutely none of this, would have been possible without the foundation built by caring parents, coaches, and other adults early in my life. Because of my experience, I had every reason to believe that what I had been told all my life was true, that America is the greatest country in the world and that America is the land where dreams can come true. I always said, ``If a little farm boy like me from Austria can make it in this country, then anyone can make it.'' PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON PHYSICAL FITNESS AND SPORTS Then I had an experience that would change my point of view forever. In 1990, I was appointed by President George Bush as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. I visited schools in all 50 States, pumping up the kids to get them off the couch and to get them into fitness and sports activities, and all the time spreading the word that winners stay away from drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Our fitness program was a huge success. NEED FOR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS But while I was promoting fitness, I saw something that was disturbing to me. I saw, in the inner cities, too many children who seemed to have no aspiration, no dreams, and no hope. They were involved with gangs and drugs, spending their afternoons hanging around the street corner, shopping malls, video arcades, often getting into serious trouble. I realized how wrong I was when I said, ``Everyone in America can turn their dreams into reality.'' In fact, I used to say, ``Everyone should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.'' Only I had to learn that not everyone had boots. Many of our children are not getting the same foundation I did as a child. Half of the American children come from a working single parent and from a family where both parents work outside the home. Millions of children are left unsupervised when the bell rings, ending the school day. This takes its toll on our children, our neighborhoods, and on the moral fabric of our country. If our children are our future, our future is in jeopardy every afternoon between 3 and 6 p.m., when unsupervised children are roaming the streets. But it does not have to be this way. After-school programs can reduce crime, make our streets safer, and improve the lives of our most vulnerable children. I have seen it work all over this country. CREATION OF INNER-CITY GAMES FOUNDATION I do not believe in talk. I believe in action. And so in 1991, with the help of Danny Hernandez and the Los Angeles Hollenbeck Youth Center, we started providing after-school programs for thousands of children in Los Angeles. As a matter of fact, the program was so successful that, nearly 10 years ago, I decided to take it national and we created the Inner- City Games Foundation, which has reached almost 200,000 children in 15 different cities in this country. ARNOLD'S ALL-STARS A couple of years ago, we decided to target at-risk junior- high-school students and started Arnold's All-Stars, a model after-school program co-chaired by Los Angeles Mayor Jim Hahn and City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo that is operating successfully in some of the most disadvantaged middle schools in Los Angeles County right now. PROPOSITION 49--CALIFORNIA COMPREHENSIVE AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM But as Columbine and other school shootings across the Nation have shown us, troubled children come from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Every public school that chooses should have the resources to offer their unsupervised students a safe, educationally enriching place to go to after school. With that goal in mind, last year I sponsored Proposition 49, a California statewide ballot initiative that the voters passed overwhelmingly. I am proud to report to you today that California is the first State in the Nation to make it possible for every public elementary and middle school to provide a comprehensive after-school program. The support that we have received for the initiative was unprecedented. We received tremendous support from across the political spectrum. Hundreds of elected officials endorsed our initiative, including Republicans such as former Governor and United States Senator Pete Wilson and Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte, and also Democrats such as San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and Attorney General Bill Lockyer. Over 80 organizations representing nearly 6 million members joined together to support California's children--groups as diverse as the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the National Tax Limitation Committee, and the California Taxpayers Association, as well as the California Teachers Association, the California AARP, and the California PTA, and nearly every law enforcement organization in the State--endorsed our proposition, which just goes to show you, when it comes to children, there is no room for partisan politics. I agree with President Kennedy, who said, ``Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.'' FINDINGS OF STUDIES OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS There are many studies from across this country, which I have footnoted in my comments. These reports, sponsored by universities and organizations, looked at various after-school programs and clearly demonstrated that children that participate in after-school programs are more likely to stay in school and graduate, get higher grades, and go on to higher education, improve their test scores, avoid gang membership, as well as stay away from violent and dangerous behavior. For example, studies show that students who did not join an after- school program were six times more likely to get a criminal conviction than kids in the same school who participated in after-school programs. According to a study by the University of Southern California, being unsupervised after school doubles the risk an eighth grader will smoke, drink, or abuse drugs. But crime prevention is not the only benefit. Studies show that students who participate in after-school programs were half as likely to drop out of high school, and 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to go on to further their education. COST EFFECTIVENESS OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS After-school programs are cost effective. If run correctly, they actually save taxpayers dollars. I consider myself fiscally conservative. Simply throwing taxpayer dollars at a problem is not the solution. The facts show that investing in after-school programs makes good financial common sense. A recent study by the Rose Institute on State and local Government at California's Claremont McKenna College found that for every dollar invested in an after-school program by the State of California, taxpayers saved three dollars by reducing juvenile arrests, incarceration, grade repetition, and other costs to society. It costs the State of California under $1,000 a year to provide a comprehensive after-school program for a child, but over $49,000 a year to incarcerate a juvenile offender in the California Youth Authority and over a million dollars a year in direct and indirect costs if a juvenile becomes a career criminal. Simply put, we can invest in our children now, or we can pay for it a much higher price later on. The benefits of after-school programs are clear. And, frankly, you do not need a stack of academic studies to come to that conclusion. Just ask any parent, teacher, or law enforcement official in your State, and they will tell you that a child who participates in after-school programs do better in school and stay out of trouble. NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT I know that, for most of you here today, I am repeating what you already know and believe about after-school programs. President Bush and you, in Congress, have shown your tremendous commitment to children by passing the No Child Left Behind Act and for making significant investment in the 21st Century Community Learning Centers and other federally funded after- school programs over the last several years. Clearly, you and your colleagues have recognized the benefits of after-school programs. I am confident that your recognition of this opportunity and your continued commitment to provide Federal funding for after-school programs will, in the full light of history, prove to be a pivotal decision for our Nation. Current funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers provide over 1.2 million kids in 6,800 centers with educationally enriching and youth-development activities. And thanks to the changes made by the No Child Left Behind Act, after-school programs have even greater flexibility because community-based organization can now run programs. RESPONSE TO MATHEMATICA, INC. EVALUATION FINDINGS Recently, some of you may have heard about the first installment of the 3-year study on the progress of the 21st Century Community Learning Program. The study found that some of the after-school programs need improvement. I and others in the after-school community would agree with some of those findings. But it would be a big mistake--and let me reiterate, a big mistake--to use that study as a justification to reduce current funding levels for after-school programs. Instead of cutting back the funding for after-school programs, we should begin to work together to focus on finding ways to improve them--such as participation. IMPROVING AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS We need to make sure that kids want to join and want to stay in an after-school program. These programs are not mandatory, so kids are reluctant to join an after-school program they perceive as an extension of the school day. My experience is that we must offer programs that interest kids, not just give them study hall or Government-sponsored babysitting. If we hope to have after-school programs help with grades and behavior, we must first get the child to participate in the program. We must also train after-school program providers to include the children in the decisionmaking process so that they feel some ownership. At my Arnold's All-Stars after-school program, for instance, the kids chose the name of the program, designed the logo and the T-shirt, and played a role in deciding what types of activities we offer. And, to date, we have had almost no dropouts, and we have had a long waiting list for kids that want to join. CONTENT A comprehensive after-school program should include academics, homework assistance, reading, computer classes, and language skills, et cetera. But a quality program must include much more. It should also offer enriching activities, such as drama, music, physical fitness and other experiences that build self-esteem, maturity, and social responsibility. Offering a variety of activities and experiences might give the child that one spark that excites them about learning and encourages them to do better in their studies. The last is accountability. How do you judge if an after- school program is a success? Today, there are only vague standards of measurement. The No Child Left Behind Act directs States to develop performance indicators by which an after- school program can be evaluated. But many States have yet to develop them, or use vague standards and need some additional guidance. 21st Century after-school program providers are eager for clear standards so that they can judge the success of their programs. Therefore, we must work together to institute standards by which a successful after-school program can be evaluated. I, for one, believe that after-school programs should be judged---- Senator Specter. Mr. Schwarzenegger, may I inquire as to how much longer you will need? Mr. Schwarzenegger. One minute. Thank you, Senator. NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, 21ST CENTURY AFTER-SCHOOL SUMMIT I, for one, believe that after-school programs should be judged not just on how they impact the child, but also how they impact the parents, our schools, our neighborhoods, our workforce, and our society. Without such stan"
