Muskie, played a pivotal role in the enactment of several landmark federal air and environmental laws. His role in getting the Clean Air Act and its amendments passed is well known across the country. He successfully resisted efforts to make the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws preemptive, thus preserving the ability of California to enact its own statutes and adopt more stringent regulations when necessary. Throughout his public and private careers, Mr. Billings not only mobilized efforts to defend the laws enacted, but also mounted campaigns to expand their effectiveness at the state and federal levels. Absent his efforts in the 1980s, it is likely that fundamental provisions of the Clean Air Act would have been effectively repealed. In the 1990s when federal air pollution programs were languishing, he helped kindle a spirit of innovation and commitment in state legislatures. For nearly 40 years, Mr. Billings has persistently pursued (sometimes as a lone crusader) a drive to reduce air pollution in not only the United States, but throughout the world.\n\n2003 Recipients\n\nJohn Seinfeld, Ph.D. - Air Pollution Research\n\nDr. John Seinfeld is the Louis E.
