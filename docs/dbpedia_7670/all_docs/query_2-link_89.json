        "text": "To: Interested Parties\n\nFr: White House Communications\n\nDa: April 22, 2009\n\nRe: The Obama-Biden economic plan: creating jobs, strengthening the economy for California families\n\nFacing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, President Obama started his Presidency with decisive action -- proposing and quickly passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Since the bill went into effect, the ARRA has already helped put money back in the pockets of 95 percent of working Americans, created and saved jobs across the country and made key investments in our community to help kickstart the economy. To ensure that the funds are spent efficiently and effectively, President Obama tasked Vice President Biden with overseeing the implementation of ARRA, and projects have already begun to come in under budget across the country. As the President prepares to introduce the details of his budget and further plans to revitalize the economy, here’s a look at how his policies have impacted California in the first three months of his administration.\n\nIMPACT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA’S ECONOMIC POLICIES ON CALIFORNIA\n\nWorking Families:\n\nMaking Work Pay: The President’s tax-cut – which covers more Americans than any in history – is putting more than $6.4 billion back in the pockets of more than 12.6 million hard-working California families.\n\n$ 220,273,864 to support child care for working families.\n\nEnergy:\n\n$351,658,900 in block grants to foster energy efficiency in building, transportation, and a wide range of other improvements.\n\n$185,811,061 to support the weatherization of homes, including adding more insulation, sealing leaks and modernizing heating and air conditioning equipment.\n\n$226,093,000 to the State Energy Program, available for rebates to consumers for energy saving improvements; development of renewable energy projects; promotion of Energy Star products; efficiency upgrades for state and local government buildings; and other innovative state efforts to help save families money on their energy bills.\n\nEducation:\n\n$8,921,033,447 potentially available to California to lay the foundation for a generation of education reform and help save thousands of teaching jobs at risk due to state and local budget cuts.\n\nHealth Care:\n\n$15,600,000 to fund 12 new Community Health Centers, which will serve an estimated 80,890 patients and create a projected 600 jobs.\n\n$48,088,867 to expand services at 117 existing Community Health Centers, which will expand service to an additional 303,474 patients and create or save a projected 896 jobs.\n\n$9,827,504 to provide meals to low-income seniors.\n\n$1,991,907,534 made available in Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) to protect health care for the families hit hard by the economic crisis and some of the nation’s most vulnerable citizens.\n\n$23,446,251 in vaccines and grants to ensure more underserved Americans receive the vaccines they need.\n\nTransportation:\n\n$2,569,568,320 in highway funds to help build and repair roads and bridges.\n\n$1,068,448,693 to repair and build public transportation infrastructure.\n\n$57,582,000 to address airport safety and security, infrastructure, runway safety, increased capacity, and mitigation of environmental impacts.\n\nLaw Enforcement:\n\nMore than $225.3 for state and local law enforcement assistance available through the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. The JAG Program supports a variety of efforts such as hiring and support for law enforcement officers; multijurisdictional drug and gang task forces; crime prevention and domestic violence programs; and courts, corrections, treatment, and justice information sharing initiatives.\n\nREAL RESULTS IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThanks to the Obama Administration’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, real impact is already being felt across the state.\n\nCalifornia Governor Announced State Schools Would Receive $3.1 In Stimulus Funding To Preserve Jobs And Programs; State Was The First Approved For Fiscal Stabilization Funds. \"California school districts and universities can immediately begin applying for $3.1 billion in federal economic stimulus funds, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Saturday in Long Beach.\"This is $3.1 billion coming from the federal government,\" he said. \"This is not the federal government's money, this is the taxpayer's money, so it's going in the right direction -- it's going into the classroom to help our kids, and this is great, great news.\" The money can be used to minimize layoffs of teachers and other school employees and preserve school programs, he said. Schwarzenegger and the U.S. Department of Education announced Friday that California was the first state to be approved for a share of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund dollars under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act sought by President Barack Obama.\" [ABC-7, 4/18/09]\n\nCalifornia Governor Appointed Stimulus Watchdog To Make Sure Funds Were Being Spent Responsibly. \"Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has appointed an inspector general to act as watchdog over the estimated $50 billion in federal stimulus money to be disbursed to cities and organizations in California. Mr. Schwarzenegger is the first state leader to create such a position. His choice for the job, the Los Angeles controller, Laura Chick, is a Democrat who has caused headaches for city officials and agencies by exposing waste and incompetence and extending her reach across government. Ms. Chick was once threatened with a lawsuit by the Los Angeles city attorney, Rocky Delgadillo, over her decision to audit the work of elected officials, including his, and she caused embarrassment at the Los Angeles Police Department over a backlog of 7,000 rape-kits awaiting testing.\" [New York Times, 5/4/09]\n\nIn CA, \"Bids Are Sometimes Close to Half as Much as Public Works Officials Had Projected.\" \"From major highway construction to small sidewalk improvements, bids are sometimes close to half as much as public works officials had projected… When the Santa Clara County Roads & Airports Department recently sought a contractor to do bicycle and pedestrian improvements along three streets, it expected the cost to be about $975,000.

Schwarzengger Vowed to Distribute Funds Quickly to Help Protect Teachers’ Jobs.\"Education Secretary Arne Duncan on Friday released nearly $4 billion to California, the first state to benefit from a special fund for states that was created by the economic stimulus law. Duncan said the money will ‘save jobs and lay the groundwork for a generation of education reform.’ The fund will replenish state budgets that have been cut or threatened because of the recession. Most of the money is intended for schools, since education accounts for a big share of state spending. President Barack Obama promises it will rescue hundreds of thousands of teaching jobs…Nearly 30,000 teachers in California received layoff notices last month. And Schwarzenegger said he will send the dollars out quickly. ‘We're the first to pass these dollars immediately to local school districts, and we're the first to protect teachers' jobs with Recovery Act dollars,’ Schwarzenegger said in a statement.\" [AP, 4/17/09]\n\nStimulus Funding In Santa Cruz Will Help Preserve Jobs And Complete Projects During Multimillion Dollar Budget Cuts. \"The city might face a $6.5 million deficit next year, but federal stimulus money could help keep some jobs, as at least $2.3 million is expected to roll into town this year for road repairs, energy conservation and emergency response. ‘It's our intention to use the money as quickly as possible to get people back to work,’ City Councilman Ryan Coonerty said. ‘We worked really hard to put ourselves in a good position to receive the funds, and we think we'll put them to good use.’ Already the federal government has promised Santa Cruz $1.4 million to pave Market Street, Morrissey Boulevard and West Cliff Drive. About $550,000 should pay for energy-efficient lighting, solar-panel projects and other conservation projects. Another $219,000 should pay for roughly two police officers for one year. Those officers might otherwise lose their jobs due to budget cuts, said department spokesman Zach Friend.\" [San Jose Mercury News, 4/20/09]\n\nSacramento Business Journal: California School Districts and Universities Are Eligible for $3.1 Billion, Eliminating the Need to Lay Off Teachers, Professors, and Other School District Workers. \"The Golden State has been approved for a share of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund dollars within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the first state to receive the much-needed money.

We were starving,’ Murphy says.\" [USA Today, 4/1/09]\n\nBids for Inland Empire Highway Projects Are Coming in Lower than Estimated, Providing Additional Capacity to Do Other Projects. \"If there is a silver lining to the collapse of the Inland construction market, it's that more bids for highway improvement jobs are well below state estimates. With millions of dollars in federal stimulus money heading for construction sites in the Inland area, the low bids might be the up side to a terrible economic time, officials said. When bids come in lower than expected, officials are better able to absorb later cost increases. The extra money can also be used for other road work. ‘When these bids come in lower, it does give us additional capacity to do other projects,’ said Christy Connors, deputy district director for design for the Caltrans office covering Riverside and San Bernardino counties…\"[Press-Enterprise, 4/11/09]\n\nRecovery Act Funding Will Help Clean Up Superfund Site Leaking Dangerous Heavy Metals. \"From $10 to $25 million in federal economic stimulus money will be used to speed the cleanup and create jobs, at Iron Mountain Mine near Redding.
