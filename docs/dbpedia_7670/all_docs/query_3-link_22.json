        "text": "Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger has revealed he recently underwent pacemaker surgery, joking he's become \"a little bit more of a machine\".\n\nTalking on his podcast Arnold's Pump Club, the Terminator star said he underwent surgery last Monday.\n\nHe said he was disclosing the news to inspire listeners to check in with their doctors.\n\n\"I know a lot of you are probably dealing with your own health challenges and I want you to know you aren't alone,\" he says.\n\n\"If you're putting something off out of fear, I hope I inspire you to listen to your doctors and take care of yourself.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger said he got the device after doctors found scar tissue from previous surgeries due to a genetic heart condition called bicuspid aortic valve.\n\nHere's what we know so far:\n\nWhat is a bicuspid aortic valve?\n\nKnown for his physical prowess, it may be a surprise to hear Schwarzenegger was born with a genetic heart condition called bicuspid aortic valve.\n\nThe abnormality in the aortic valve in the heart means the valve has only two small parts, called leaflets, instead of the normal three, according to John Hopkins.\n\nThe research university says over time the abnormal valve can become harder to open, or can become leakier meaning the normal flow of blood to the body is interrupted.\n\nThe defect tends to run in families.\n\nSchwarzenegger disclosed on the podcast both his mother and grandmother had the condition.\n\nHe goes on to add his mother, who died in 1998, had refused to get a valve replacement surgery.\n\nValve replacement surgery is the \"only certain treatment\" for a bicuspid aortic valve, John Hopkins says.\n\nHas Schwarzenegger had previous heart surgeries?\n\nThe star has had three heart surgeries, in 1997, 2018 and 2020.\n\nHis 1997 open-heart operation replaced two valves.\n\nTissue replacement valves can generally last around 15 years.\n\nIn 2018, his replacement was due to be non-invasive but Schwarzenegger says there was a \"screw-up\" which led to another open-heart surgery replacing one valve.\n\nDuring that surgery, Schwarzenegger previously said unexpected internal bleeding led doctors to \"open me up very quickly to save my life.\"\n\n\"I was really freaking out,\" Schwarzenegger recalled in a YouTube video about the surgery.\n\n\"I woke up and all of a sudden the doctors were in front of me saying, 'I'm so sorry but it was unlike what we planned.'\n\nThe star attributed a \"positive attitude\" and a good support system to getting him back to gym training for Terminator: Dark Fate which started filming three months later.\n\nIn 2020, Schwarzenegger underwent a successful non-invasive surgery to have his other valve replaced.\n\nHe says scar tissue from these operations, which caused an irregular heartbeat, is what prompted doctors to install the pacemaker.\n\n\"With all of those surgeries, my doctors told me it was more important than ever to stay on top of the situation,\" he says on the podcast.\n\nSchwarzenegger says he visited doctors annually, and shared heart rate information from home.\n\nWhat is a pacemaker?\n\nA pacemaker is a small device which helps maintain a healthy heart beat using electrical impulses.\n\nIt sits under the skin on the left or right side of your chest and sends electrical signals to your heart to help it to beat at a normal rate, St Vincent's Health Australia says.\n\nDoctors may commonly recommend a pacemaker if your heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or irregular.\n\nThis may be for a number of reasons, including a previous heart attack/ heart problem, viral infections of the heart or cardiac surgery.\n\nRecovery from a pacemaker installation is typically quick, and most return to their normal routine within a few days, John Hopkins adds.\n\nHow's Schwarzenegger recovering?\n\nFortunately, Schwarzenegger says he's \"doing great\" post-surgery.\n\nHe says he's able to attend an environmental activism event by Friday.\n\nHe adds filming for the second season of his Netflix show FUBAR will continue as planned.\n\n\"I can't do my serious training in the gym for a while but I will be 100 per cent ready for FUBAR next month,\" he says."
