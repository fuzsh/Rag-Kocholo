        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger underwent secret surgery last week after years of having an irregular heartbeat.\n\nThe action star revealed on his podcast, \"Arnold's Pump Club,\" that he had an operation at the Cleveland Clinic. \"I have some personal news to share. Last Monday I had surgery for a pacemaker and became a little bit more of a machine,\" the 76-year-old told listeners.\n\n\"Just saying this to all of you, goes against so much of my upbringing in Austria. Where nobody, ever, talked about medical issues. Everything related to health care was kept to yourself,\" he added.\n\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER RECALLS NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE AFTER BOTCHED HEART SURGERY: 'IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISASTER'\n\nHaving been transparent about his multiple open-heart operations in the past, including one which almost resulted in death, Schwarzenegger shared more about the procedure.\n\n\"Since I know going against my own secretive instinct and being transparent helps people, it only feels right to talk about this. First of all, I want you to know I'm doing great. I had my surgery on Monday and by Friday, I was already at a big environmental event,\" he said, referencing a conference held by the Campaign for a Safe and Healthy California. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and actress and activist Jane Fonda were also in attendance.\n\n\"Nobody would have ever thought I started the week with a surgery,\" he admitted.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOUâ€™RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nBorn with a bicuspid aortic valve, Schwarzenegger's first dual valve replacement was during open-heart surgery in 1997. In 2018, in what was supposed to be a non-invasive procedure, Schwarzengger had one of his two valves replaced, but he was rushed into open-heart surgery as a result of an error made by doctors.\n\nIn 2020, the \"Fubar\" star went to the Cleveland Clinic, where his second valve was replaced. Having stayed in touch with the team there, returning for yearly check-ups, Schwarzenegger was told in early March that he would need a pacemaker after doctors ran a series of tests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"They also advised me that it was time to go through with this because some scar tissue from my previous surgery had made my heartbeat irregular. It had been like that for a few years,\" he admitted.\n\n\"That's life with a genetic heart issue,\" he said. \"But you won't hear me complaining. My mother and her mother's bicuspid valves killed them. I am still here because of medical innovation and being very diligent about staying in touch with my doctors and listening to them.\"\n\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW INSTAGRAM\n\n\"My mom refused to have valve replacement surgery. But back then, the only option was open heart. Today, they're replacing valves with non-invasive procedures where you can go home the same day.\n\n\"I could have kept it a secret,\" he told his audience. \"I know a lot of you are probably dealing with your own health challenges, and I want you to know you aren't alone. And if you're putting something off out of fear, I hope I inspire you to listen to your doctors and take care of yourself.\""
