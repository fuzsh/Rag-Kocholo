        "text": "Aram Nadjarian\n\nAram Nadjarian is a former Senior Environmental Policy Advisor under California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Founder of Mozaic Media & Communications. He graduated from Sussex with an International Relations MA in 2007.\n\nSussex became my home away from home - my incubator that inspired me to listen more‚Äù Aram Nadjarian\n\nGrowing up in Los Angeles as the child of immigrant parents I understood from an early age the importance of recognizing and seizing every opportunity that might help me advance, both socially as well as educationally. I was only nine years old when I recognized the importance of identifying mentors and have relied on these relationships on my journey through life. My first mentor introduced me to the intricacies of working in the entertainment industry, and later, a community and labor activist in inner city Los Angeles inspired and guided me to first attend rallies and protests and ultimately to serve in support and leadership roles (graduating from a mere spectator to a proactive, passionate advocate for a variety of issues, the environment being one of them).\n\nThe disparities I saw, especially in inner-city communities with marginalized populations made up of ethnic minorities (Latino, African-American mainly) made me want to do something. I felt that the source for any sound community was the health of its population and that environmental degradation and negligence would cause that health to deteriorate. These communities are called environmental justice communities and \"hotspots\" are areas where negative environmental impacts hit them the hardest.\n\nI fought, through advocacy organizations, environmental groups and my local elected officials, to support their passions and share their stories. I did this through my work as a young 13 year old producing a syndicated children's television show called KidsTalk Voices of Tomorrow, which empowered young people to speak their minds about issues affecting them in their own community... one of the major issues being air and water pollution, asthma in young children and toxic substance exposure. But my biggest accomplishment was bringing awareness to community and educational opportunities tailored to incarcerated youth in LA County juvenile halls. This was through a program called \"A Second Chance\" that won a Telly Award for the documentary I produced following this dynamic program in LA's juvenile halls. Through a TV medium, I felt I was able to share with the largest number of people and it essentially became a passion. Yes, I was 13, and many think I am crazy but it's because my mentor took a \"chance\" on me... that's all some of us need.... a CHANCE to make a difference. I turned that CHANCE into resounding success but it took a VILLAGE to get me there.\n\nI ended up at Sussex through the generosity of a Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Scholarship. Rotary promotes community service and professional development and its mission around the world translated into an opportunity to study at a world class institution, on global matters like the environment and apply my best self to my cause each and every day. From the professors, to my counselors to my flatmates and Brighton itself... Sussex became my home away from home... my incubator that inspired me to listen more, research more, learn more and to thrive.\n\nDirectly after I graduated, I had the incredible honor of actually landing in an environment where my specific exposure to international relations and environmental policy at Sussex enabled me to apply my Master's degree in helping countless others. I was selected into the prestigious Capital Fellows program in the State of California under then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. For the next 6 years, I proudly served Arnold and quickly became Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and Senior Policy Advisor to the Governor on Environmental Policy matters. A dream come true!\n\nI helped that state implement AB32, the Global Warming Solutions Act which was the first of its kind policy that set new standards for carbon emission reduction in the state. Our state effort was followed by other US states and other states around the world. This catapulted my career as an environmental advocate, working for environmental justice communities and business communities. It allowed me to help lead 4 Global Climate Summits with Governor Schwarzenegger, to participate in the UN Global Climate Conferences (COP) in Copenhagen and in Durban, South Africa along with meetings with White House climate officials and global leaders in the space. I helped influence and promote sound policy... I helped directly make a difference and my Sussex degree laid the foundation upon that work."
