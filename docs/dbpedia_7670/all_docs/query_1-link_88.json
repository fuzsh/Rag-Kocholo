        "text": "Schwarzenegger had an affair in 1996 with Mildred Baena, the family’s housekeeper, which resulted in the birth of his fifth child, Joseph Baena, 25, who was born less than a week after his and Shriver’s youngest son.\n\nSpeaking in the new Netflix docuseries, the former governor of California said that did not know for sure that Baena was his for many years, but as the years went by, their resemblance could not be denied.\n\n“In the beginning, I really didn’t know, I just started kind of feeling [it]. The older he got, the more it became clear to me,” he said. “And it was then just really a matter of, how do you keep this quiet? How do you keep this a secret?”\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Schwarzenegger’s five children.\n\n1. Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger\n\nKatherine Eunice Schwarzenegger was born on December 13, 1989. Her middle name was chosen to honour her maternal grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who died in 2009 at age 88.\n\nKatherine, 33, has made a name for herself in the self-help sphere, having written several books since she was 21 years old on different topics, including positive self-image, navigating life after graduating university and forgiveness. She has also written two children’s books.\n\nDuring an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2022, Arnold, 75, opened up about his growing family, saying it was “the easiest thing to be a grandfather”. The former governor of California also praised Pratt, 43, describing him as a “fantastic guy” and “a great son-in-law”.\n\n2. Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger\n\nChristina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger was born on July 23, 1991. Like her older sister, her middle names have significance, as Aurelia is the name of Arnold’s late mum and Maria is obviously her own mum’s name.\n\nMost recently, she has turned her attention to documentaries and is credited as an executive producer on Netflix’s 2018 documentary Take Your Pills and its 2022 follow up, Take Your Pills: Xanax. She also serves on the council for the Special Olympics, a sports organisation for children and adults with intellectual disabilities that was founded by her maternal grandmother in 1968.\n\n3. Patrick Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nPatrick Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on September 18, 1993. His middle name honours his father and he shares his first name with his cousin. His uncle, Meinhard Schwarzenegger, sadly passed away at the age of 24 in 1971, leaving behind a three-year-old son – who now goes by Patrick Knapp – who Arnold helped financially while he was growing up.\n\n4. Christopher Sargent Schwarzenegger\n\nChristopher Sargent Schwarzenegger, 25, is the youngest of Shriver and Arnold’s children together and was born on September 27, 1997. His middle name honours his maternal grandfather, Sargent Shriver, who was an American diplomat, politician and activist.\n\nChristopher largely remains out of the spotlight, and having only graduated from the University of Michigan in a virtual ceremony in 2020, appears to have not settled on a career just yet. However, while celebrating Christopher’s 24th birthday in 2021, Arnold shared in a social media post that his son has an interest in a variety of sports.\n\n“Between your boxing classes, your weightlifting classes, your stretching classes, your cycling classes, and on and on, I can’t even keep up with you!” he wrote. “I love you and I’m proud of you every day!”\n\n5. Joseph Baena\n\nJoseph Baena, 25, is the son of Arnold and Mildred Baena, his housekeeper who worked for the family for more than 15 years. He was born on October 2, 1997, five days after Arnold and Shriver’s youngest son was born. Joseph has Guatemalan heritage on his mother’s side, and also has four siblings who are all now in their 30s and 40s.\n\nJoseph has followed in his father’s footsteps and is an aspiring bodybuilder and actor as well as a property agent. In an interview with Men’s Health in 2022, the Dancing with the Stars contestant said he doesn’t use his dad’s last name while auditioning because “he doesn’t believe in handouts”.\n\n“He believes hard work pays off, and so do I,” he said. “I love the word honour, and I’m very prideful in the sense that if I use my dad’s contacts or ask him for favours, I wonder what honour is that gonna bring me?”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Joseph said he “very vividly” recalls the day his father’s identity was made public when he was just 13 years old.\n\n“I was in the eighth grade,” Joseph said. “And I get called out of class to leave. And my mum’s there, and she’s like, ‘We gotta go – everyone is finding out about you and who your father is.’”\n\nJoseph shared on the podcast Unwaxed in 2022 that it “took a little while” for him and Arnold to become “close” in the aftermath of the scandal. In Arnold, which is now streaming on Netflix, Baena makes a brief appearance with his father, although he does not speak on camera.\n\n“It was wrong, what I did,” the former governor said of his affair in the docuseries. “But I don’t want to make Joseph feel that he is not welcomed in this world – because he is very much welcomed in this world. I love him and he has turned out to be an extraordinary young man.”"
