        "text": "20 Years of\n\nClimate Action\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has been fighting pollution and climate change for over 20 years. His approach has always centred around the idea that we need “less talk, more action”. As Governor of California he worked to pass the Global Warming Solutions Act to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the Million Solar Roofs Initiative.\n\nGlobal Leader California\n\nSchwarzenegger´s efforts helped make California the global leader in combating climate change and promoting renewable energy it is today. It has reached all of its environmental goals. At the same time, California’s economy has boomed, adding more jobs than any other state and rising to the fifth largest economy in the world.\n\nStill a lot of work to do\n\nAfter leaving office in 2011, he continued to promote state and local clean energy efforts through the work of the Schwarzenegger Institute at the University of Southern California. Arnold Schwarzenegger is committed to terminating pollution and wants to continue to expand his activities and collaborate with partners throughout the world.\n\nThe Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative\n\nHe therefore established the “The Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative,” the logical next step in his crusade for a clean and sustainable future. Monika Langthaler, who launched the climate conference AUSTRIAN WORLD SUMMIT together with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2017 is now also the Director of his initiative, which is based in Vienna.\n\nAwareness\n\nWe work on building awareness of the climate crisis and the urgent need for action every day and once a year at our AUSTRIAN WORLD SUMMIT (AWS). The AWS has become one of the largest environmental gatherings in the world and provides a platform for highlighting concrete solutions and measures from global decision-makers committed to preserving a healthy planet and decarbonizing the economy by 2050."
