        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably a household name to anyone who has ever stepped into a gym. It is not without reason that the former governor of California is regarded as the legend of bodybuilding 🏋️. But he has also secured himself a permanent place on the big screen 🎥 as the Terminator – Schwarzenegger has never missed an opportunity in his life. Today, however, we don’t want to talk any more about the Austrian-American jack-of-all-trades, but instead focus on three fitness icons who are not Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n3) Ronnie Coleman\n\n“Lightweight, baby!” This muscle package should also be familiar to most people who have ever been involved in bodybuilding. Coleman is – together with Lee Haney – Mr. Olympic record holder. “Big Ron” has won bodybuilding’s highest award a whopping eight times 💪 Fun fact: At his best time, he had a chest circumference of 156 centimetres (kraftmahl.de) – that’s just one centimetre shorter than Shakira‘s entire height. But Coleman is also multi-talented: he has a bachelor’s degree in accounting and was once a police officer 👮. The gym, where he was allowed to train for free with the police, changed his life (essentiallysports.com).\n\n2) Jane Fonda\n\nKnown to some as a successful actress and activist, Jane Fonda is also a real fitness icon. Back in the 80s, the two-time Oscar winner got millions of people moving with her legendary aerobics videos and made them fit for life 🤸. Fonda taught us that the program should not only include weightlifting, but also stretching, yoga and endurance training. And even today, many fitness enthusiasts swear by her workouts. Fonda herself is also still active: at 86, the native New Yorker is a prime example of how important sport is and that it’s never too late to get fit 🚀!\n\n1) David Goggins\n\nThe “toughest man alive” and former Navy SEAL is best known for his motivational speeches circulating on social media and incredible achievements in endurance sports. He has taken part in over 70 ultramarathons and has often finished in the top 5 (davidgoggins.com). And for those who think that endurance athletes can only run and have no strength, please let the following melt in your mouth: Goggins held the Guinness World Record for no less than 4030 pull-ups in 17 hours 😲! Need a motivational boost? Goggins was once around 100 kilos overweight – today he has a place in the International Sports Hall of Fame! Well, if that’s not enough incentive to really get going in the gym 🏃.\n\nSo, which is your favorite fitness icon? We hope that they have given you that extra dose of motivation and that we will soon see you working out in an ACTIV FITNESS studio – whether it’s pumping muscles à la Coleman, as an aerobics queen like Jane Fonda or in Goggins-style on the treadmill. See you at the next FitFact: Hasta la vista, baby!"
