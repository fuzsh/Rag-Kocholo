        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California and former bodybuilder, has raised his voice against a silent health hazard lurking in the state. Collaborating with renowned figures like Jane Fonda, current California Governor Gavin Newsom, and environmental advocates, Schwarzenegger launched a campaign in Los Angeles to support a crucial law passed in 2022.\n\nThis law prohibits the establishment of new oil and gas wells within 3,200 feet (975 meters) of sensitive community sites such as homes, schools, and hospitals. Advocates argue that this measure is essential for safeguarding residents from the harmful effects of pollution. However, despite its significance, the law has not yet been enforced due to the oil industry’s successful qualification of a referendum seeking to overturn it in the upcoming November elections.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger questions whether oil executives live near oil wells\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nSchwarzenegger highlighted the unity among leaders and public servants in support of the cause. In an Instagram story, he remarked, “It works in Washington for them and worldwide, but it never works in California, especially when we have the governor, Jane Fonda, and so many community leaders and public servants come together. We have a great team together.”\n\nAddressing concerns over the impact on the oil and gas industry, Schwarzenegger questioned the proximity of oil executives to these wells, revealing a stark reality. “Let’s find out how many oil executives live next to oil wells. You see what I’m saying? Out of the 2.7 million people that live next to oil wells, there were none. No oil executives living close by,” he stated.\n\nSchwarzenegger and Governor Newsom stressed the need to uphold a law crucial to California’s climate goals. However, the California Independent Petroleum Association opposes this law, fearing its impact on a sector that provides significant tax revenue.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom’s take on the matter\n\nAccording to the ABC News Governor Newsom has taken steps to reduce the oil industry’s sway. “Big Oil is the polluting heart of this climate crisis,” Newsom said. He recently approved a law requiring the disclosure of top backers behind referendum proposals. The phrasing of the referendum on the ballot has also been changed to offer voters a clear choice between “keep the law” or “overturn the law.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nYet, challenges remain in holding the oil industry responsible. A bill requiring oil companies to compensate those affected by health issues linked to wells was stopped by the Senate Appropriations Committee last year.\n\nREAD MORE: Arnold Schwarzenegger Warns Against the Dangers of Using Plastic Water Bottles\n\nAs California faces this health threat, Schwarzenegger and allies lead a campaign advocating for community well-being and environmental preservation.
