        "text": "With Congress sharply divided over global climate change — and the GOP, including President Donald Trump, expressing denial over its causes and effects — one prominent Republican leader recognizes that human activity is a major factor and is leading a worldwide effort to attack the problem.\n\nAt a unique forum Thursday, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proclaimed a message of hope, saying solving the problem is a matter of will, of never taking “no” for an answer and communicating the message person-to-person.\n\nSchwarzenegger, a Republican who cut taxes and also ushered in some of the most progressive clean air laws in the state, led a Talanoa Dialogue an inclusive, bottom-up discussion at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator Thursday in an effort to hear solutions from non-government groups.\n\nI’ve heard of this kind of communication effort from the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, a grass-roots group that sends speakers to community events to gently inform and propose a sensible message about fighting global warming that usually includes a “revenue-neutral carbon tax” that would go back to consumers.\n\nTalanoa is a Fiji word reflecting an inclusive, participatory process with transparent dialogue. The idea originated with Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of the Republic of Fiji and president of the COP23, the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties, a United Nations group centered on climate change.\n\nFiji is pushing for rapid reduction of the burning of fossil fuels. Sea level rise, only one result, is already wiping out buildings and threatening schools in this island country.\n\nThe latest report from the International Panel on Climate Change says holding the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is an extremely arduous goal and must be done in 12 years or the effects will be irreversible.\n\nDespite the gloomy report, Schwarzenegger and Bainimarama heard from numerous groups in a circular auditorium at LACI, and had this to say: “It is extremely important about communicating. We can have the best ideas about renewable energy or about financing, but when the mayor of some little town doesn’t know that technology exists and it can be profitable, we don’t have anything.”\n\nHere’s a few examples I thought you might want to know about:\n\n— The Irvine Company and Advanced Microgrid Solutions teamed up with Southern California Edison to build 21 high-rise hybrid electric office buildings. The energy usage switches from the grid to battery power stored in Tesla Powerpack battery systems, like a hybrid car does from gasoline to battery power. The effect? A 25 percent reduction in peak demand and 10 megawatts available to balance demand and perhaps preclude some GHG-emitting peaker plants from getting built.\n\nEven Schwarzenegger invested in the technology.\n\n“My goal now is to make Arnold Schwarzenegger rich and famous,” joked Susan Kennedy, CEO of AMS.\n\n— The Goldhirsh Foundation started a crowd-sourced grant called the LA2050 Grants Challenge. So far, the foundation gave grants to 20 community-based organizations. One of them went to the Trust For Public Land, which beautified 2,400 alleys in L.A. with permeable surfaces to receive rainwater into underground aquifers and drought-tolerant plants and fruit trees on the surface, said Tara Roth, foundation president and member of L.A. Sustainability Leadership Council.\n\n— The Nathan Cummings Foundation voted in April to align all of its $400 million endowment toward fighting global climate change and social inequality, said James Cummings, a grandson of the founder, owner of a food conglomerate that included the Sara Lee Corp. He called it “impact investing.”\n\nSchwarzenegger told of the fight to get AB32 — a bill to reduce green house gases in California — passed by working with Democratic lawmaker Fran Pavley. They went to Washington to convince the EPA that greenhouse gases were a pollutant harming the planet.\n\nAfter hearing “no,” the state sued and won that fight in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“You have to go out and fight. Fight, fight and fight. One person can make a difference,” he told the group.\n\nSteve Scauzillo covers public health, environment and green transportation for the Southern California News Group.
