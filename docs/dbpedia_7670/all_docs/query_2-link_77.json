        "text": "The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced key advisors who have been providing input on Rudy Giuliani's commitment to providing affordable free-market-based solutions to health care aimed at giving Americans more control over and access to their health care.\n\nThe Mayor's group of advisors includes well-known advocates of consumer-driven health care and recognized leaders in their respective areas of expertise. The group consists of Dr. Daniel Kessler, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute, associate professor at Stanford University, and co-author of Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise. Other advisors include Dr. Scott Atlas, Dr. David Gratzer, Sally Pipes, and Don Moran.\n\n\"Rudy Giuliani strongly believes in limited government and giving American families more control over their health care decisions,\" said Steve Goldsmith, the campaign's Chief Domestic Policy Advisor. \"He understands that failed mandates and wasteful, unaccountable bureaucracies lead to the exclusion of millions of Americans from quality care and health insurance.\"\n\n\"Empowering American consumers is the key to reforming our nation's health care system,\" said Dr. Kessler. \"Rudy will encourage innovative solutions to provide affordability and increased access to heath care options.\"\n\nThe group of advisors will provide assistance in developing a wide range of heath care proposals including reforming the tax code and the medical liability system and providing more families with expanded health insurance choices.\n\nAbout the Health Care Advisors:\n\nDan Kessler, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Kessler is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, where he teaches courses on economics, public policy, and the health care industry.
