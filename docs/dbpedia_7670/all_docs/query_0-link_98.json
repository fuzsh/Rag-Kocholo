        "text": "Film star and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has urged environmental activists to pay more attention to immediate health hazards like air and water pollution.\n\nSchwarzenegger was speaking on Sunday at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, where diplomats from around the world were discussing implementing the Paris climate accord.\n\nHe said: “It’s time we wake up and talk about what really matters – 25,000 people dying every day because of pollution.”\n\nSchwarzenegger also criticised the environmental community for “missing the point” with its messaging on global warming.\n\nHe said: “People do not focus as much on 2C energy increases in temperatures or increases in sea levels rising.”\n\nSchwarzenegger said calling attention to concrete issues, like “so many people having problems with cancer and kids with asthma”, was a better approach."
