        "text": "By hosting symposia, summits, and academic conferences, the USC Schwarzenegger Institute will gather thought leaders from business, government, nonprofits, and academia, as well as students, to discover approaches that unite, rather than divide, and that focus on innovation rather than isolation. Focusing on solutions that can be put into action, the Institute will maintain strong collaborations with other organizations doing important work in these focus areas as well as policymakers who will ultimately implement these strategies.\n\n“People are hungry for a new kind of politics. The people want their leaders not to ask what are the needs of their political party, but to ask what are the needs of the people.” – Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger"
