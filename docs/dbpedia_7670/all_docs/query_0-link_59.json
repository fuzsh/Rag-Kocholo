        "text": "Maria Shriver (born November 6, 1955, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) is best known as the first lady of California (2003–11) and an American television journalist. She is recognized for her work as a reporter for the NBC (National Broadcasting Company) program Dateline and as the host of First Person with Maria Shriver, an interview-based program featuring public figures.\n\nShriver was born into a politically prominent family as the daughter of diplomat Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy, a sister of Pres. John F. Kennedy. In 1977, after earning a B.A. in American studies from Georgetown University, she began her career in television journalism as a writer and producer for station KYW in Philadelphia. She advanced rapidly in her career, becoming a writer and producer for the Baltimore, Maryland, show Evening Magazine in 1978 and a national news correspondent for CBS in 1983. She was soon named coanchor of CBS Morning News, where she remained for three years. In 1986 she left CBS for NBC, where she was a news correspondent and the anchor of the young-adult television newsmagazine Main Street. That year she also married actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. From 1987 to 1990, Shriver coanchored the Sunday edition of the NBC news program Today. She worked as a correspondent for Dateline from 1989 until 2004, when she resigned because of conflicts of interest that arose after her husband became governor of California (2003–11). In 2013 she returned to NBC."
