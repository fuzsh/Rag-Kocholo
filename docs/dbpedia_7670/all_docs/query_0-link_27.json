        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has lived one hell of a life. Depending on when you first became aware of The Austrian Oak, you could know him for being a bodybuilder, a Hollywood action hero, a politician or a venerated elder statesman who advocates for various causes including climate action. In fact, the only thing that hasn't changed about Schwarzenegger during his 50 years spent in the public eye is his devotion to fitness and his physique.\n\nA seven-time Mr Olympia winner, Arnie starred in the 1977 documentary, Pumping Iron, which explored his rivalry with bodybuilder and The Incredible Hulk actor Lou Ferrigno, as well as Schwarzenegger attempting to defend his Mr. Olympia crown. This was his final act in bodybuilding before he seamlessly made the shift into the movie business.\n\nList your favourite movies from the 80s and there's a good chance that at least one Schwarzenegger film makes the list. Between 1982 an 1989, the former bodybuilder appeared in Conan the Barbarian (1982), The Terminator (1984), Commando (1985), Predator (1987), The Running Man (1987) and Twins (1988). A run that any actor would be proud of.\n\nDuring the 90s, Schwarzenegger went on to star in Total Recall (1990), Kindergarten Cop (1990), True Lies (1994) and The Terminator sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) before throwing his hat into politics in the early 2000s when he became the Governor of California. He served two terms in office before returning to the entertainment industry to make some more legendary movies.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Sarah Douglas on the set of ‘Conan the Destroyer’\n\nIn 2010, he teamed up with former frenemy Sylvester Stallone in The Expendables. Schwarzenegger went on to star alongside Sly in Expendables 2 and 3. Unfortunately, he won't be in the forthcoming Expendables 4, but he will be teaming up with Stallone again.\n\n‘I did [the first Expendables] as a favour to Sly. I shot it on a Saturday for two hours quickly in a church with Bruce Willis. Sly said, 'Oh, can you do Expendables 2?' and I did that for a weekend,’ Schwarzenegger said. ‘Then it was expanded for Expendables 3. And that was it. We're going to do something together one day.’\n\nThe new issue of Men's Health is out today!"
