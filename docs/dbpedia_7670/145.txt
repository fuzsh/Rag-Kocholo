Film star and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has urged environmental activists to pay more attention to immediate health hazards like air and water pollution.

Schwarzenegger was speaking on Sunday at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, where diplomats from around the world were discussing implementing the Paris climate accord.

He said: “It’s time we wake up and talk about what really matters – 25,000 people dying every day because of pollution.”

Schwarzenegger also criticised the environmental community for “missing the point” with its messaging on global warming.

He said: “People do not focus as much on 2C energy increases in temperatures or increases in sea levels rising.”

Schwarzenegger said calling attention to concrete issues, like “so many people having problems with cancer and kids with asthma”, was a better approach.
