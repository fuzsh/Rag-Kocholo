In 1973, Eileen Dietz played two roles in the horror classic The Exorcist (watch it HERE, pick up William Peter Blatty’s novel HERE). She was the face of Pazuzu the demon, and also played the possessed girl Regan in some scenes that were too violent or disturbing for young Linda Blair to perform. Now Dietz stars in another exorcism movie, writer/director Kelton Jones’ Of the Devil, and Deadline has broken the news that Uncork’d Entertainment is planning to release the film sometime in August.

Based on a story by James Cullen Bressack, who also serves as executive producer, Of the Devil follows

a family desperate to find a cure for their young son’s brain cancer. When unconventional treatments lead to the child being possessed by an ancient evil, the parents must fight not only for the child’s life but also his soul.

Dietz is joined in the cast by Vernon Wells (The Road Warrior), Devanny Pinn (Crossbreed), and Robert LaSardo (The Mule).

Keith Leopard, the President of Uncork’d Entertainment, had this to say about his company acquiring the Of the Devil distribution rights:

Fans of The Exorcist will eat up this frighteningly fun possession thriller from Kelton Jones – it sent shivers up my spine!”

August is right around the corner, so we shouldn’t have long to wait before Uncork’d starts releasing some promotional materials for Of the Devil. The first image from the movie can already be seen at the bottom of this article, but it doesn’t give away any of the horror Of the Devil has in store for us. It just shows Dietz hanging out with an adorable little dog.
