        "text": "Text © Richard Gary / Indie Horror Films, 2021\n\nImages from the Internet\n\n100 Acres of Hell\n\nDirected by Hank Leigh Hump\n\nScreenshot Entertainment; KOA Nation; Jersey Lights Productions;\n\nLionsgate; Indican Pictures\n\n84 minutes, 2019\n\nwww.facebook.com/100AcresOfHell/\n\nhttps://100acresofhell.com/\n\nwww.indicanpictures.com/new-releases/100-acres-of-hell\n\nTo be honest with yaz, I have never been on a “Bro’s Weekend,” where my macho friends gather to camp out with guns. Yeah, I’ve done the tent thing while out on multi-day road trips or have gone on photo-taking sojourns into the wilderness of farm country with a bunch of guys, but it didn’t entail drinkin’ and huntin’ and carousin’. It has been tame, just the way I like reality (as opposed to cinema versions). But it’s a bit different for the protagonists in this film. And where do they put up their tents? Trespassing at Foggy Creek Nature Preserve aka 100 Acres of Wildlife Fun, of course.\n\nBut before that, there is the obligatory prologue, which features a nice cameo by Eileen Dietz (she played Pazuzu in the original 1973 The Exorcist), taking place in the 100 Woods at a time when Nixon was president (remember when Kinky Friedman’s detective novels referred to going to the bathroom as “Taking a Nixon”? Actually, one of the characters in this release mentions he “has to take a weasel.” But I digress…). I won’t go into details, but two important things to note from this: pay attention to the prologue dialogue, and that it is extremely bloody. Early on, this is showing some promise.\n\nGene Snitsky\n\nFor the story, the hero of our tale is Buck (wrestler Gene Snitsky), who when we meet him, is in recovery from a devastating accident that took his family and broke his back. While he is healing, we get informed on his mental condition by the number of pills he takes, washed down with a straight-from-the-bottle swig of Jack D. When I fractured my vertebrae last year, hydromorphone was a blessing, so I understand, somewhat).\n\nWith the push of his friend record producer Trent (Jeff Swanton), the two join banker Morgan (Ernest O’Donnell, who was in a bunch of early Kevin Smith films, including Clerks in 1994), and sex obsessed car dealership owner Bo (Jim Roof), who is trying too hard to fit in. Of course, like all macho studs, they belittle each other and reminisce back to High School. Past resentments are bound to come up during this Bro’s Weekend, as they are wont to do in not just genre releases, but all macho bros-above-hoes mentality films.\n\nAfter the traditional warning not to go to their planned location from the local gas station owner (Robert Waldron), our quartet of differing personality types head to where they were told not to go. A bit cliché, but the trope is there for a reason beyond the red herring. The road trip to the Preserve makes up the entirety of the first act. The arrival starts act 2.\n\nFrom the prologue, we know they are not going to be alone, so I don’t feel like I’m giving anything away. We – I mean our guys – are warned numerous times along the way, but who listens to old men and a “creepy girl” with yellow teeth (Olivia Parulis)?\n\nIt will not take genre fans long to figure out this is a mash-up of the genres of camping in the woods while being hunted, and the inbred cannibal family trope, commonly used since at least The Hills Have Eyes (1977). You may think, four guys? That’s not much of a body count. Au contrare, as they are visited by a few of the local girls they run into along the way, Kitty (cute Katie Walsh) and Sissy (Catherine Corcoran, who died the most infamous death in 2016’s Terrifier), and a couple of their male friends. And then there are the bikers…\n\nSamu Anoa'i\n\nThey are being hunted one by one (or in pairs on occasion) by the masked pater of the clan, Jeb Tucker (Samu Anoa’i – aka Sam Anoai – who is a title winning part of the professional wrestling Samoan Swat Team under the noms de ring the Great Samu and The Tahitian Prince; this is his first non-wrestling acting role), who uses a bow and arrow in a The Most Dangerous Game type of scenario, hence the film’s working title, Manhunt. There is no surprise at all that at some point, the two wresters, Anoa’i and Snitsky will come face to face sometime in Act 3.\n\nFilmed in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the woods look very Northeastern, and being near Autumn, a bit foreboding and forbidding. It’s the perfect setting for hunting and being hunted. The old cars and trailer looks like the kinds of places I like to photograph with my friends, so I know how scary those kinds of deep woods can be, even if not that far from civilization, and the director uses the space wisely.\n\nWhile this is not a comedy, there are some funny moments, but it does not get in the way of the arrows or deaths. The gore is minimal, but looks really good, especially in one instance in the middle of the film, though I have to say the whole prologue looks great in this – err – vein. The make-up, especially for Jeb, looks fun and satisfying.\n\nThere are certainly moments in here where you just want to tell a character or two to just shut the hell up (especially Bo), but the fact that he is so annoying speaks to the quality of Roof’s work. Speaking of roles, everyone does pretty well, but Walsh comes out the most natural.\n\nEileen Dietz\n\nMy only real complaint is that the box cover makes it appear as if this is similar to The Strangers or The Purge franchise, but it is not. Written well by Ed McKeever, Snitsky and Producer Jason Koerner, the end of the film is a bit predictable while at the same time it made me go, “really?” I’m sure it will satisfy, and between my “why?,” I also smiled. This is the kind of release that is pleasant to watch, and if you like these murderer-in-the-woods types, you won’t be sorry."
