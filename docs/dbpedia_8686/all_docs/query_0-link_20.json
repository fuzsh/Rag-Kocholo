        "text": "Few films have had as much of an impact on the horror genre as The Exorcist, and a big reason is the presence of Pazuzu, as portrayed by Eileen Dietz. Now Eileen has a new book coming out called Exorcising My Demons, and we have the early details right here.\n\nThe full title of the bio is Exorcising My Demons: An Actress’ Journey to The Exorcist and Beyond. It is co-written by Daniel Loubier (Dead Summit) and published by AuthorMike Ink, which is the home of several other horror icons’ official biographies such as Kane Hodder and Tom Savini.\n\nEileen tells us Exorcising My Demons is coming out in hardcover in March and on Kindle and Nook a bit sooner. It’s not yet listed on Amazon so be sure to keep your eyes on the official Eileen Dietz website and the Eileen Dietz Facebook page for updates.\n\nVISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!\n\nGot news?
