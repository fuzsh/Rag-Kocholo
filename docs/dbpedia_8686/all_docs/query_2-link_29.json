        "text": "Thriller actress to greet guests at Scream Park\n\nPublished 8:34 am Tuesday, September 27, 2016\n\nThe Niles Scream Park announced recently it will welcome actor Eileen Dietz for an exclusive engagement.\n\nDietz will appear Friday and Saturday nights, Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. She will be available on the midway to meet with fans and sign autographs. In case of long lines, a Fast Pass will be available for purchase.\n\nWhile Eileen Dietz cut her acting teeth in New York, appearing in several soap operas and the drive-in favorite “Teenage Gang Debs,” she is best known for playing the demon known as “Captain Howdy,” in the Oscar-winning “The Exorcist.”\n\nAfter appearing in the Tony winning, off-Broadway production of Steambath with Tony Perkins, Dietz left New York for a role as a member of the infamous Manson clan in the Emmy winning “Helter Skelter.” She continued onto roles on “Happy Days” and “General Hospital.”\n\nSince then, Dietz has been happily working on a variety of other projects like “The Queen of Screams,” Rob Zombie’s “Halloween 2,” “Constantine,” “Night Tales” and “Grimm.”\n\nMost recently, Dietz has appeared in “Kids vs. Monsters,” and has a number of films set to be released and filmed this year. While Eileen may be typecast in the horror genre, she says she is not only OK with that, she said that she absolutely loves it.\n\nIt will be possible to have a picture taken with Eileen and signed for $15 (cash only). There also will be pictures of her available that she will personally autograph for $10 (cash only).\n\nThe park is open from 7 to 11 p.m. this Friday and Saturday. The Scream Park is located on Mayflower Road in Niles, and can be accessed by taking Exit 5 (Niles- Buchanan Road) from the US 31 Expressway.\n\nFor more information call (269) 687-FEAR or check out the website at www.haunted.org."
