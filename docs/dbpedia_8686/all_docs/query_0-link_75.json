        "text": "Yes, this psychological, shock horror classic did not end up on the\n\nAFI list of 100 Greatest American movies - instead they chose the\n\noriginal Frankenstein (no, Bride was definitely better). Still, there\n\nare good reasons to celebrate this horror classic's 25th anniversary\n\non video. The Exorcist is also, gasp, a thinking man's horror film - a\n\ndeeply spiritual film about faith. It is also the only horror film to\n\ndate that has made people believe in the Devil. \"She doesn't say she's\n\na demon. She says she is the Devil himself,\" as Father Karras (Jason\n\nMiller) declares of his confrontation with Regan, played by Linda\n\nBlair. I couldn't have said it better myself, and what a shame this\n\nfilm wasn't re-released in theatres first. It would've been a scream -\n\na hark back to what compelled audiences in 1973.\n\n\"The Exorcist\" is not what you expect each time you see it. It's not\n\nthat I find multiple meanings in this film with each viewing or that I\n\nam astounded by some of the surprises in it, but I am always riveted\n\nby the experience. One example: I am more surprised by the exorcism\n\nscenes in particular. They have the power to frighten me each time I\n\nsee them. The levitating bed, the subliminal fast cuts of a demon in\n\nwhite face, the way that Jason Miller and Max von Sydow circle Regan's\n\nbedroom while she spews obscenities galore and pea soup and rotates\n\nher head 180 degrees, the terrific shot of Regan sitting up on her bed\n\nand reaching for the superimposed shot of the demon statue of Pazuzu,\n\netc. There is genuine tension and terrific horror imagery throughout\n\nthis amazing sequence.\n\nThe performances still rank among the best in contemporary horror: Wes\n\nCraven, take note. Ellen Burstyn's fits of rage as Chris MacNeil and\n\nRegan's abuse towards her have become Burstyn's trademark ever since.\n\nWhat is more impressive are Burstyn's quiet scenes, particularly with\n\na youthful, pretty Linda Blair, and I like how they cavort in the\n\nbedroom about the men in Chris's life, or when they play in the\n\nbasement with the Ouija board. I think Linda Blair is quite underrated\n\nin this movie: she undergoes a thrilling, painful transformation from\n\npubescent little girl to raging, raving maniac with green eyes and a\n\nlarge tongue - interestingly, she is not that different from the way\n\nBurstyn acts in her manic scenes. What helps Blair's performance is\n\nnaturally Mercedes McCambridge's gargling, deep, multilayered voice,\n\nbut Blair's expressions that run the gamut from happy, innocent, and\n\nconfused to angry, pathetic, and fearsome is clearly a bona fide work\n\nof acting.\n\nKudos must also go to the late Lee J. Cobb as the private detective\n\nKinderman who has seen everything (and is a film buff), but nothing\n\nlike the desecration at the church or the bizarre killing in front of\n\nthe giant stairwell (an ominous image). And it is always a profound\n\npleasure to see Max von Sydow, treading on Ingmar Bergman's religious\n\nGod-fearing waters, in his role of the sickly 70-year-old Father\n\nMerrin who's performed exorcisms before.\n\nA final note is the hard-edged performance by Jason Miller as Karras,\n\nthe psychiatrist/Jesuit priest who questions his own faith and feels\n\nresponsible for the death of his mother. He's a torn man with doubts\n\nthat are wiped away once he confronts the Devil. The scene where he\n\nvisits Regan and records her growling voice while speaking to each\n\nother in Latin is probably the only humorously eerie scene in the\n\nentire movie.\n\n\"The Exorcist\" would not have endured for this long had it not been\n\nfor William Friedkin's realistic direction, and his acute sense of\n\ntime and place. The cinematography is superbly realized, employing\n\neffective use of both lights and darks. The best examples are the\n\nopening Iraq sequence, taking place mostly in sunlit digging areas,\n\nand the justifiably famous shot of a silhouetted Father Merrin\n\nstanding outside of Regan's bedroom where a shaft of light bursts\n\nthrough. And you can also savor the documentary-like scenes where\n\nRegan undergoes a spinal tap and several excruciating medical tests\n\nfrom doctors.\n\nThe documentary I watched on the Special Edition tape (known as The\n\nFace of God) is enlightening and informative on the making of the film\n\nand the various accidents, deaths and mysteries surrounding it. Most\n\nrevealing are William Friedkin's tactics in getting his actors to\n\nreact honestly by firing a gun in the air - a tactic shared by Roman\n\nPolanski. I also liked the scenes cut from the original version, which\n\ninclude the infamous \"Spider-Walk\" by Regan where she wiggles her\n\ntongue like a serpent at the nanny's legs after Chris learns of her\n\ndirector's death, and a final scene between Father Dyer (Reverend\n\nWilliam O'Malley) and Kinderman.\n\nIt may be easy for people to laugh at \"The Exorcist\" now since there\n\nhave been several unwarranted rip-offs, sequels, and parodies (the\n\nonly exception being the flawed The Omen). Still, the film continues\n\nto be compelling, powerful, scary, haunting and shocking (the\n\nmasturbation with the crucifix is one of the most disturbing scenes\n\never shot on film). \"The Exorcist\" is a real horror film because it\n\ntakes itself seriously, and that is part of its emotional power. It's\n\nthe seminal horror film of the century, unsurpassed in its ugly vision\n\nof the genuine force of evil.\n\nCHILLER THEATRE UPDATES: In April of 1998, I visited the Chiller\n\nTheatre expo at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, and guess who was\n\nsigning autographs? Mrs. Linda Blair, of course. She was a witty\n\ndelight to talk to, and seemed eager and open to talking about (what\n\nelse?) The Exorcist. Certainly not Roller Boogie, although she might\n\nhave answered some questions about it. It was a delight for me to meet\n\nher because it was the first film to really scare me out of my wits. I\n\nthink she would have been great as Gale Weathers or some competing\n\nreporter in the Scream movies.\n\nAfter the horrific success of The Exorcist, Linda Blair made a career\n\nof playing brutalized victims in such films as Born Innocent and Sweet\n\nHostage, not to mention the abonimable Airport '75. But it was in 1977\n\nthat her career became cursed, to say the least. She starred in what\n\nwas sure to be a classy production called Exorcist II: The Heretic.\n\nThere were big name talented stars such as Richard Burton (nominated\n\nthe same year for Best Actor for Equus) and Louise Fletcher (who won\n\nan Oscar the previous year for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), and\n\nan admired director named John Boorman, who helmed the brilliant\n\nDeliverance. What could have gone wrong? The absence of writer William\n\nPeter Blatty? Yes, that's one factor, and he later wrote and directed\n\nthe significantly better The Exorcist III.\n\n\"Exorcist II\" begins a few years later after the events of the first\n\nfilm. Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) is now living in a high-rise New\n\nYork apartment building with her nanny/tutor Sharon (short-haired\n\nKitty Winn returning from the original). Chris MacNeil (Regan's\n\nmother) is conspicuously absent, apparently shooting a film in Europe.\n\nProbably Ellen Burstyn refused to be in it after seeing the script, no\n\ndoubt. Anyway, Regan now sees a psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) who\n\ntries to uncover her memories from that fateful exorcism. Of course,\n\nRegan doesn't remember anything - she's still a happy-go-lucky kid who\n\ntap-dances badly to the mental patients in the hospital.\n\nEnter Father Lamont (Richard Burton, giving new definition to the term\n\nstoic) who knows a thing or two about exorcisms and Pazuzu from his\n\ntravels in Africa. He asks the diocese to investigate Father Merrin's\n\ndeath, and seeks Regan who may have the clues. Father Lamont indulges\n\nin telepathic communication with Regan through the miracles of\n\nhypnosis by using a clunky-looking head strap, a blinking light with\n\nan ominous tone, and some wires. Poor Louise Fletcher watches them\n\nlike a gaping idiot - there are endless stares throughout this film.\n\nLamont later discovers that an African high priest named Kokumo (James\n\nEarl Jones) has the answers to Pazuzu's whereabouts courtesy of a big\n\nAfrican bug and some locusts. At least, that is what I made of the\n\nplot but it is as confusing as Ned Beatty's brief appearance as a\n\nhelicopter pilot.\n\nDuring its sneak previews and recutting for a re-release, \"Exorcist\n\nII\" was laughed off the screen both times and bombed badly at the\n\nbox-office. No amount of recutting could do justice to it. The\n\ndialogue is full of unnatural, unintentionally funny lines such as,\n\n\"Don't feel bad. I was possessed by the Devil once. I am okay now,\" or\n\nso Linda Blair should think. I also love Burton's classic delivery of\n\na line he shouts to the bus driver, \"NOW, GO!\" Or how about the\n\nbiggest howler when Ms. Fletcher asks Lamont: \"Have you ever been with\n\na woman, Father?\" Lamont's response: \"No,\" he says with a stupefying\n\nstare.\n\nPeople and events are depicted in \"Exorcist II\" so carelessly that we\n\nhave no clue who or where people are in relation to a given setting.\n\nBurton seems to go back to Africa, Georgetown and New York so often\n\nthat I was convinced he was a migrating Mephistopheles. At one odd\n\nmoment, James Earl Jones is a high priest who turns out to be...an\n\nentomologist! I am still not clear how Lamont knows of Merrin's death\n\nor how he finds the MacNeils or why he would want to get close to\n\nRegan in the first place - she isn't possessed by Pazuzu in the entire\n\nfilm! And none of this makes Lamont a heretic since he embraces the\n\ndogma of the church, not oppose it.\n\nThe ludicrous hypnosis scenes seem to go on forever and are akin to Ed\n\nWood's territory, along with absurd close-ups of a moth approaching\n\nthe screen as it flies around Africa looking very much like Mothra\n\nattacking Godzilla. The special-effects have been described as superb\n\nyet none is more ridiculous than Sharon's death by fire using obvious\n\nsuperimpositions, or the destruction of the MacNeil house that looks\n\nmore ethereal than hellish using obvious matte shots. I can understand\n\nwhy Mr. Blatty laughed and snickered when he saw this with an audience\n\nin Georgetown.\n\nNone of this would matter if \"Exorcist II\" was at least scary, but it\n\nisn't. It's all boring spiritual mumbo-jumbo with affectless\n\nperformances and incompetent direction and writing. What's amazing is\n\nthat everyone in this laughable production took it so seriously. The\n\ndemon's voice sounds like a soft-spoken female Reverend with none of\n\nthe vocal power evident from Mercedes McCambridge in the original -\n\nshe must have seen the script, too. And pity poor Linda Blair with fat\n\ncheeks, who at one point sees a whorish demonic double of herself.\n\nChills and thrills begin to accumulate and, for a moment, you begin to\n\nthink that director Boorman is finally getting it right. Too bad that\n\nit is at the end of the film.\n\nGeorge C. Scott as Lt. Kinderman in \"The Exorcist III\"\n\nAfter the debacle of \"Exorcist II,\" no one expected anyone to make\n\nanother sequel. Sure enough in 1990, Mr. Pazuzu came back minus Linda\n\nBlair, who was doing a parody of \"The Exorcist\" called Repossessed.\n\nWilliam Peter Blatty was also back, this time writing and directing a\n\ndirect sequel to the original based on his 1983 novel Legion.\n\n\"Exorcist III\" is not bad, and it is a considerable improvement over\n\nthe second one, but it is still miles away from the classic original.\n\nLieutenant Kinderman (George C. Scott replacing the late Lee J. Cobb)\n\nis back in Georgetown investigating a series of brutal killings, and\n\nthe chief suspect is the Gemini Killer (chillingly played by Brad\n\nDourif) and his large pair of shears. Only problem is that the Gemini\n\nKiller is dead; so who's that demented cellmate at the local\n\nGeorgetown jail? And why he sometimes look like Father Damien Karras\n\n(Jason Miller), who supposedly died when he fell onto the steps at the\n\nend of the original? Is Pazuzu back?\n\nThe worst is expected with a title like \"Exorcist III\" since everyone\n\nexpects it will be full of blood and gore considering the standards\n\nset by the original and all the trashy horror films since. The truth\n\nis that there is no visible gore or blood in the entire film - we hear\n\nabout graphic, gruesome depictions of mutilations but we see precious\n\nlittle. That was a wise move for Blatty, and he opts for old-fashioned\n\nscares by employing effective use of shadowy, empty rooms,\n\nominous-looking hallways, and wind-swept churches. One scene set in\n\nlong shot in a hospital corridor where an evil presence awaits is as\n\nscary and heart-stopping as anything I've ever seen.\n\n\"The Exorcist III\" is hardly a great film. George C. Scott is fun to\n\nwatch but he overacts to the hilt bringing little of the subtlety that\n\nLee J. Cobb brought to the role. Too much of his character is\n\nunderdeveloped, and I would have loved to have seen more of his\n\nfamily. The film is also structured as a surreal police thriller with\n\nmany plot twists and turns that don't add up too much. An unnecessary,\n\ndeliberately over-the-top exorcism at its conclusion seems like a\n\nlast-minute editing job to justify its title (test audiences\n\ncomplained originally that there was no exorcism). \"Legion\" would have\n\nbeen a better title.\n\nOn the plus side, the movie is genuinely creepy and occasionally\n\nscary. Blatty still writes with panache, particularly the entertaining\n\nconversations between Kinderman and Father Dyer (played by the late Ed\n\nFlanders of St. Elsewhere fame, replacing O'Malley) on the value of\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life, Women's Wear Daily, and mental health. It is\n\nalso wonderful (no pun intended) to see Jason Miller back, this time\n\nwith green eyes and an attitude. Brad Dourif gives the most impressive\n\nperformance as the demonically possessed Gemini Killer - his erudition\n\nand somber voice are amazing to behold.\n\nEXORCIST III TRIVIA\n\nBrad Dourif makes a reference to \"child's play\" as far as getting in\n\nand out of jail without being seen. Dourif of course voiced the Chucky\n\ndoll in all the Child's Play films.\n\nThere are cameos by Everett C. Coop, Larry King (both restaurant\n\npatrons), Samuel L. Jackson, Fabio, John Thompson (coach of the\n\nGeorgetown Hoyas Basketball team), and Patrick Ewing as an angel.\n\nEXORCIST IV: THE BEGINNING\n\n\"The Exorcist\" still stands as the supernatural horror film of the\n\ncentury, and Linda Blair is still aching for a comeback. As for\n\nWilliam Peter Blatty, well, the latest news is that he may be writing\n\nExorcist IV: The Beginning, which will focus on Father Merrin's\n\nactivities in Africa before the events of the first film. Morgan Creek\n\nproductions will take charge, as they did with \"Exorcist III.\" Blatty\n\nis writing the film along with William Wisher, whose previous writing\n\nchores included The Terminator films, and some uncredited writing on\n\nEraser and Broken Arrow. Not the best choice for horror I am afraid.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly issue #496, production will commence\n\nthis fall though no cast or crew has officially signed yet.\n\nThe film itself sounds suspiciously like Psycho IV: The Beginning\n\n(documenting Norman's childhood), and we know how badly that turned\n\nout. If that is not gratuitous enough, there will be a TV series (!)\n\nwhere we will follow a priest who investigates mysterious conflicts\n\nbetween good and evil (How original and enigmatic!) My advice: find a\n\ngood role for Linda Blair in some film by Wes Craven, John Carpenter\n\nor the filmmakers of the Blair Witch Project, and leave the Pazuzu\n\nwell enough alone.\n\nThere are so many subtleties and clues in \"The Exorcist\" that they are\n\neasy to miss and/or dismiss. I am surprised at the number of \"E\" sites\n\nI've looked at that have not picked up on the importance of such\n\nminute details. Although the film may not have the understatement of\n\nRosemary's Baby, it still manages to be just as implicit in its\n\nmysteries about faith and belief in the forces of good and evil.\n\nFirstly, let's correct some misconceptions and unsubstantial rumors\n\nregarding specific shots in the film:\n\nThe Projectile-Vomit scene\n\nIt has been assumed that an actress (Eileen Dietz) was used as Linda's\n\ndouble for the vomitting scene, and that is only partially true. Just\n\nafter Father Karras (Jason Miller) asks Regan about his mother's name,\n\na stream of green vomit splashes on his face (originally, it was\n\nsupposed to hit his jacket only but it missed). The very first shot of\n\nRegan is a medium shot of her strapped to the bed, and it is obviously\n\nLinda Blair vomitting (look at it slow-motion if you don't believe\n\nme). The next shot is of Karras being hit, and then we see a shadowy,\n\ndarkly lit shot of Eileen spewing what's left out of her mouth. How\n\nrepulsive!\n\nThe White-Faced Demon - PAZUZU\n\nThere are three-half second shots of a demon in white face in \"The\n\nExorcist.\" These are called subliminal cuts - one of the greatest,\n\nmost powerful tools of cinematic expression since Eisenstein's montage\n\nediting system. The first subliminal shot occurs during Karras's dream\n\nwhere he sees his mother crying by a subway station. He runs towards\n\nher. We see quick shots of his mother in a dark room, a grandfather\n\nclock, and a cross or necklace of some kind falling in slow-motion. In\n\nbetween these shots, we see a single-frame shot of a white-faced demon\n\nwith red eyes staring down at the screen looking frighteningly gaunt\n\nand skeletal-like. The next two shots of the demon are during the\n\nexorcism sequence: there is another single-frame shot while Regan is\n\nwrithing in bed and the lights are flashing on and off. The last shot\n\nof this demon is in a famous, intensely ugly close-up of Regan staring\n\nat Karras. We see Blair's face and a superimposition of the demon's\n\nright eye and part of his/her mouth.\n\nThere has been some talk about who actually plays the white-faced\n\ndemon. The Internet Movie Database lists Eileen Dietz in the credits\n\nas the demon, but I've heard that Jason Miller may actually be the one\n\nwho plays the demon. There is still no confirmation on this fact, but\n\nit is mentioned in Picard's Pad, another \"Exorcist\" site, and in the\n\ncolorful Booperville site. This would make sense since the white-faced\n\ndemon could be construed as Karras's death mask, thus leading to his\n\nfinal jump to the death at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nTHE REAL TRUTH - According to Mark Kermode's wonderful book on \"The\n\nExorcist,\" he states that Eileen Dietz is in fact the white-faced\n\ndemon. Director Friedkin had pointed out that there were makeup tests\n\nof the demon...and he decided it was best to use flashes (subliminal\n\ncuts) of the demon since they would not work as separate whole scenes\n\nfor the film during the exorcism. So my Jason Miller theory is thrown\n\nout the window, but it is still a good one.\n\nStrange, bizarre moments (and some strangely beautiful ones, too)\n\nThere are moments in \"The Exorcist\" that are so strange and so\n\nmystical, both aurally and visually, that it is indeed one of the most\n\naesthetically beautiful films ever made. The one famous image, used in\n\nadvertising, is of a silhouetted Father Merrin standing by the MacNeil\n\nhouse where a shaft of light bursts through Regan's window. Below are\n\nother fascinating examples of image and sound:\n\n1.) The slingshot sound effect is first heard when Chris MacNeil walks\n\nup to the attic thinking that there are rats in there. The second time\n\nshe hears them, she enters the attic only to discover that her servant\n\nKarl is there and tells her, \"See, no rats.\" The next time we hear the\n\nslingshot sound effect is just after Chris's meeting with Lt.\n\nKinderman. She hears the sound followed by Regan's cries for help and\n\nthe demon yelling at her: \"You bitch!\" As Chris races to help Regan,\n\nshe's horrified to find her masturbating with a bloody crucifix. As\n\nChris tries to stop her, she's hit and falls on the floor. When she\n\nlooks back, she sees Regan rotating her head and screaming at her with\n\na British accent mimicking Burke Dennings: \"Do you know what she did?\n\nYour c---ing daughter!\"\n\nThis scene is significant on many levels: it cleverly builds the\n\nhorror subliminally from the onset, and serves as a turning point in\n\nChris's character. She first discovers that Regan is exhibiting a\n\nsplit personality, then she gets more bad news that her director and\n\nclose friend Burke is dead (originally followed by the Spider-Walk\n\nscene), followed by finding her daughter masturbating and bringing up\n\nthe memory of Burke, resulting in her desperate consultation with\n\nKarras to perform an exorcism.\n\n2.) During the Iraq sequence, Father Merrin is inside a room with\n\nanother priest. We hear the clock ticking and suddenly, it stops. This\n\nchilling moment is repeated in \"The Exorcist III.\"\n\n3.) Kinderman discovers a piece of clay at the bottom of the long\n\nstaircase. This piece of clay seems to come from Regan since he later\n\ndiscovers other pieces of clay in Chris's house. The way that the\n\nlieutenant brushes the dirt off of the clay piece is similar to\n\nMerrin's discovery of a head piece of Pazuzu covered in dirt.\n\n4.) Father Damien Karras, one of the most important characters in \"The\n\nExorcist,\" undergoes quite a few changes in the film. At the\n\nbeginning, he seems to be a man losing his faith in God and in his own\n\nlife, particularly the health of his mother. When he first confronts\n\nRegan, she says to him off-camera, \"Can you help an old altar boy,\n\nfaddah?\" Karras recollects that this was the same voice of a homeless\n\nperson he ignored in the subway. Regan also verbally attacks Karras\n\nabout his mother's death on many occasions. She tells him that his\n\nmother's soul is within her, and pretends to be his mother by\n\nmimicking her Greek accent. At one point, during the exorcism, Regan\n\nyells to Karras: \"You killed your mother! You left her alone to die!\n\nShe'll never forgive you for that!\" All of these moments underlie\n\nKarras's lack of faith in himself and in others, particularly his\n\ninability to help the mentally ill or the homeless. When he tells Tom,\n\nanother priest, that he's losing his faith, there's a quick\n\ntransitional cut to the MacNeil house where the wind blows the leaves\n\noff the ground.\n\n5.) When Chris tearfully tells Karras that her daughter is possessed\n\nand needs an exorcist, we hear young girls and boys playing in a\n\nnearby playground. This is an indication that Chris wants things to go\n\nback to normal, and she wants the youthful, sweetly innocent Regan\n\nback whom we see at the beginning of the film.\n\n6.) Ellen Burstyn undergoes several emotionally traumatic moments as\n\nthe tormented Chris - it must have been pure hell to be in such an\n\nemotional state for nine months of production. My favorite moment is\n\none that is easy to miss: when Kinderman visits the house, she asks\n\nhim if he would like some tea. As she approaches the kitchen, she\n\ntries to maintain her composure. Another moment is her horrified look\n\nwhen Regan yells and makes obscene gestures at the doctors: \"F--- me!\n\nF--- me!\"\n\n7.) Regan's demonic giggle when Karras tries to bring back Father\n\nMerrin is heard briefly on the soundtrack of \"The Exorcist III\" when\n\nKinderman is at the church and hears the wind blowing.\n\nCOMPARISONS BETWEEN THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE\n\nTo read William Peter Blatty's brilliant book of \"The Exorcist\" was\n\ndeeply educational for me in seeing how a screenwriter adapts a book\n\nto the screen and the changes that are made as a result. There is an\n\nawful lot of exposition in the book before Regan starts to exhibit\n\nanother personality, which shows primarily in the scenes cut from the\n\nfilm such as Chris and Regan's walk to the monuments. I have read\n\nother novels made into films and the best were Edith Wharton's The Age\n\nof Innocence and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. There is\n\nalways more character development in a book than in the film version\n\nso here's a list of some differences in terms of context, and the arc\n\nand shape of the characters' personalities.\n\n1.) Chris MacNeil is a much more sarcastic character in the book,\n\nespecially in her conversations with Karras, Dennings and Kinderman.\n\nShe is also more worrisome at the beginning, particularly when Regan\n\nstarts playing with an Ouija board and mentions that Captain Howdy is\n\nher invisible friend. In the film, she feels that Regan is just a\n\nprecocious little prankster. One other fact that is not really\n\nmentioned in the film is that Chris is an atheist, and still doesn't\n\nknow where her beliefs lie after the exorcism.\n\n2.) In the book, it takes Father Karras much longer to be convinced\n\nthat Regan is possessed. He tries to come up with rational\n\nexplanations for her behavior, including the rappings and her physical\n\nstrength. It isn't until he hears Regan's language in reverse on audio\n\ntape and checks the medical tests that he's convinced that an exorcism\n\nis the only solution.\n\n3.) The servants, Karl and Willie, are virtually window dressing in\n\nthe film. In the book, it is discovered that Karl and Willie are\n\nactually a married couple who lost their daughter at an early age -\n\nthey also have been servants of the MacNeil family for several years.\n\nIt turns out that Karl has been secretly seeeing his daughter, a\n\njunkie, and giving her money to pay for drugs, unbeknownst to Willie.\n\nWhen the possessed Regan encounters Willie, she tells her that her\n\ndaughter is alive causing Willie to have a sobbing fit.\n\n4.) The exorcism in the film lasts one night. In the book, it occurs\n\nover a period of five days and includes one break in the exorcism\n\nwhere Karras speaks briefly to Kinderman. Also, in the film, Karras\n\nand Merrin are the only ones in the room performing the exorcism on\n\nRegan. In the book, they are continuously interrupted by Karl, Willie,\n\nChris and Sharon.\n\n5.) Some moments are actually more graphic and unrelenting in the book\n\nthan in the film. One example in the book is when Regan is writhing\n\nand being thrashed on her bed causing Sharon and Chris to call the\n\ndoctors. As the doctors enter the bedroom, Regan becomes momentarily\n\npossessed and says, \"The sow is mine. F--- me!,\" while pointing to her\n\ncrotch. Afterwards, she sticks her finger in her crotch and licks it.\n\nShe then crosses her arms and says, \"Ah, my pearl. My sweet, innocent\n\npearl.\" Chris's reaction is to cry uncontrollably, and then she leaves\n\nthe room. The masturbation scene is worse. When Regan hits Chris in\n\nthe face causing her fall to the floor, she continues to jam the\n\ncrucifix into her already bloodied crotch.\n\n6.) In the film's climax, Kinderman arrives at Chris's house while the\n\nfinal stages of the exorcism take place. When Karras jumps out of the\n\nwindow, Kinderman and Chris rush into Regan's bedroom and he observes\n\nthat Karras has fallen down on the steps. In the book, Chris and\n\nSharon are the ones who rush to Regan's bedroom, and we never see what\n\nactually takes place in there when Karras jumps out, we only hear the\n\nwindow glass break.\n\n7.) In the book, there are two to three desecrations at the church\n\nrather than one. One example is the red paint found in an obscene\n\nletter written on a card in Latin that matches the red paint on one of\n\nRegan's drawings.\n\n8.) In the book, the possessed Regan says to Merrin and Karras, \"this\n\ntime, you will lose.\" The line was never said in the film, but it was\n\nuttered by the possessed Karras in \"Exorcist III.\"\n\n9.) The Spider-Walk scene and the last scene between Kinderman and\n\nFather Dyer (where they comment on the girl's condition and\n\nCasablanca) are in the book. The last scene was cut in the film\n\nbecause director Friedkin thought that it made the film too long. The\n\nSpider-Walk scene was cut in the film because, according to writer\n\nBlatty, it was too soon and awkward to have a climax of a possessed\n\nRegan approaching Sharon after Chris discovers that her friend, Burke,\n\nis dead. According to Friedkin, he couldn't get the appropriate\n\nreaction from Ellen Burstyn. Another scene that was cut in the film\n\nwas a conversation between Karras and Merrin on the Devil's reason for\n\nentering the poor girl's body - this takes place in a break during the\n\nexorcism. Merrin rationalizes that the point is to make them see how\n\nugly and beastly they are as humans, and to reject the possibility\n\nthat God loves them. The scene is in its entirety in the book.\n\nAll these elements and minute details show that \"The Exorcist\" is not\n\njust another thrill horror show. It is the most powerful, humanistic,\n\nsupernatural horror film ever made.\n\nEXORCIST COMMENTS\n\nHere are a few comments, feelings, arguments, positive and negative\n\nreactions I would like to share from some movie buffs and general\n\naudience members who have seen \"The Exorcist\" - most are regular\n\ncontributors to Moviething forums and IMDB forums.\n\nI don't think one has to believe in the supernatural to be frightened\n\nby this film. I saw the whole possession thing as an allegory to the\n\ngeneration gap. The separation of youth from the adult society. After\n\nall this film came in on the tide of \"the summer of love\" and the\n\nwhole rebellion movement. What I found, however, to be truly\n\nfrightening with this film are the subtleties. There was something\n\nprimal to the whole thing. It played on the fears that most animals\n\nhave: separation anxiety. To be separated from the mother. As children\n\nwe always expect our mother to come to our rescue. As a good mother\n\nshe always does. The most terrifying scene in the film is when\n\nRegan,in the clutches of the demon,screams out:\"Mother make it\n\nstop!!.\" A terrified Ellen Burstyn looks on helplessly. There is\n\nnothing she can do.The worst fears of both parent and child are\n\nclearly exploited here. Another scary element for me was the shaking\n\nof the faith in science. Science,in my view,has always come to the\n\nrescue of man. In this situation it comes up bankrupt for the young\n\nRegan. Even the doctors conclude that a priest might be helpfull. As\n\nan atheist,it is not that I don't believe in God and the Devil,it is\n\nthat I don't WANT to. I find science and humanism much more\n\ncomforting. This is how THE EXORCIST affected me. Thank God it was\n\nonly a movie (I hope!)! - Thanks to Bobo-40\n\nIt should be noted that many people see 'The Exorcist' today with some\n\nof the most shocking footage deleted--the scene where Reagan\n\nmasturbates with a crucifix. This might make a big difference in how\n\none views the film. - Thanks to Hermit C-2\n\nThe Exorcist was great! One of the truly great horror films of all\n\ntime. The original was the only one worth talking about. That's\n\nusually the case unfortunately. - Thanks to Steve-214\n\nI saw The Exorcist at the drive-in when I was a kid. And it remains\n\none of the scariest cinematic experiences I've ever had. I wonder how\n\nmuch of its power stemmed from Mike Oldfield's (Tubular Bells)\n\nsoundtrack? - Thanks to charmaS\n\nI remember when it opened in theaters in Washington, D.C. It was the\n\n70's equivalent of the mania that surrounds movies like The Phantom\n\nMenace --- lines around the block and no one talked of anything else.\n\nAnd the lines were full of adults who'd obviously skipped work to see\n\nit in the afternoon (I did.) - Thanks to Whidbey-2\n\nI live in the UK where the Exorcist was banned until this year, so\n\nlike most I went to the cinema to watch it - what I saw was one of the\n\nworst films I have ever seen. It lacked any real story line,\n\nabsolutely nothing happens in the first hour, you could cut it from\n\nthe film and you would lose nothing. The film totally relies on slang\n\nin order to scare people who watch it, that and the fact that the girl\n\nis also talking to priests. The film may have been good in it's day\n\nbut it just dosen't cut it in comparison to films today, it was a big\n\ndisapointment. Thanks to Slp3\n\nMany have said that the Exocist is the scariest movie ever made. That\n\nmay be the case, but it should have a proviso on it.... If you believe\n\nin that sort of thing. I am a horror enthusiast. I like horror a lot.\n\nWas I disappointed with the Exorcist. No way. Did it scare me? Not one\n\nbit. The reason - I am completely un-religious. I don't believe in the\n\nafterlife, demons, angels, heaven or hell. All the religious imagery\n\nand mythology was of no consequence to me. The only way for someone to\n\nbe scared of something is if the believe there is a chance that it\n\ncould happen to them. As I don't believe in demons, I don't believe in\n\npossesion. To me it was an imaginary situation, but to someone who\n\nbelieves in all the stuff I don't, it scared the bejeezus out of them\n\nbecause in the back's of their minds, there was a chance that it could\n\nhappen to them. For me, the Exorcist is an excellent well written,\n\nwell acted piece of cinema. I liked it so much I bought the 25th\n\nAnniversary special edition. Was it a great movie? Absolutely. Was it\n\nscary? For me - No. For millions of others - Too darn right. Either\n\nway, if you haven't seen it - do so. - Thanks to Exar\n\nOn a sound note, I've heard that a microphone was placed into a jar of\n\nbees and this sound was persistant at low levels throughout the film\n\nwhich, in effect, created an instinctual response in the audience to\n\ncringe. I think \"The Exorcist\" is the scariest movie I've ever seen,\n\nalongside \"The Haunting.\" - Thanks to Gryphon-7\n\n\"The Exorcist\" didn't scare me at all. I thought it a lot of religious\n\nnonesense and quite silly. I recently saw a screening of an excellent\n\nprint with an audience of fans. I wanted to have another look and\n\nreasses it. Again, for me, it didn't do much. I've long maintained\n\nthat the soundtrack is what really scares. It is, indeed, nerve\n\nwracking and does get to me, but the story strikes me as silly and the\n\nimages as overkill. I have a friend, who saw if when it was first\n\nreleased, and it struck him as hilariously funny. So, much so that he\n\nlaughed hysterically and was kicked out of the theatre. - Thanks to\n\nhumble-2"
