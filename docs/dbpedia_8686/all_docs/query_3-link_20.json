        "meta_description": "This project delves into the intersection of Mesopotamian mythology and world music through the lens of Pazuzu, a prominent demon from ancient Mesopotamia. Pazuzu's presence and malevolent attributes in Mesopotamian lore have sparked curiosity and fascination, transcending ancient civilizations to influence contemporary cultural expressions, including music. This research explores how Pazuzu's imagery, symbolism, and mythology have influenced various world music genres, ranging from metal to modern electronic compositions. This study will examine how Pazuzu's character is portrayed and interpreted within diverse musical traditions worldwide by analyzing musical compositions, lyrical themes, and cultural contexts. Through a comparative approach, it examines how Pazuzu's archetype resonates differently across cultures, reflecting varying perceptions of evil, chaos, and spiritual forces.\nMoreover, the study investigates the role of Pazuzu in shaping musical narratives and evoking emotional responses within listeners. Drawing upon methodologies, including ethnomusicology, cultural studies, and mythology, this research offers insights into the enduring significance of Pazuzu within the global musical landscape. It highlights how ancient mythological figures inspire creativity and imagination among contemporary artists—fostering a dialogue between past and present, tradition and innovation. Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the cultural resonance of Pazuzu and its impact on world music.",
