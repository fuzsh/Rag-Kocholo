        "text": "Demon Lord, Pazuzu, Demon Prince of Air\n\nFamily: Demons\n\nLarge fiend (demon), chaotic evil\n\nArmor Class 19 (natural armor)\n\nHit Points 364 (27d10 + 216)\n\nSpeed 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 25 (+7) 20 (+5) 27 (+8) 18 (+4) 19 (+4) 23 (+6)\n\nSaving Throws Strength +15, Dexterity +13, Constitution +16, Wisdom +12\n\nSkills Acrobatics +13, Arcana +12, Athletics +15, Deception +14, Insight +12, Perception +12, Stealth +13, Survival +12\n\nDamage Resistances cold, fire, lightning\n\nDamage Immunities poison; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\nCondition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned\n\nSenses truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 22\n\nLanguages Auran, Aquan, Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Giant, Infernal, Terran; telepathy 120 ft.\n\nChallenge 27 (105,000 XP)\n\nSpecial Traits\n\nSpecial Equipment. Pazuzu wields the greatsword Carriontooth.\n\nEvasion. If Pazuzu is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Pazuzu instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.\n\nFlyby. Pazuzu doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.\n\nInnate Spellcasting. Pazuzu’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells, requiring no material components.\n\nAt will: animal messenger, arcane eye, call lightning, detect magic, feather fall, giant insect, gust of wind, insect plague, lightning bolt, sending, wind wall (no concentration necessary)\n\n3/day each: control weather, darkness, dispel magic, dominate person, freedom of movement, suggestion\n\n1/day: storm of vengeance\n\nLegendary Resistance (3/day). If Pazuzu fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n\nMagic Resistance. Pazuzu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\nMagic Weapons. Pazuzu’s weapon attacks are magical.\n\nUnholy Aura. An unholy aura surrounds Pazuzu out to a radius of 40 feet. A creature who enters or begins their turn in the area must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, they are paralyzed. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.\n\nActions\n\nMultiattack. Pazuzu makes two attacks with Carriontooth and two attacks with its claws.\n\nCarriontooth. Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (8d6 + 10) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage.\n\nClaws. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d8 + 7) slashing damage.\n\nCorrosive Gas (Recharge 5-6). Pazuzu exhales a cloud of acidic gas in a 100-foot cone that spreads around corners. Creatures in the area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 18d8 acid damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nDominate Aerial Creature. Pazuzu can target up to six beasts or monstrosities with a fly speed and an Intelligence lower than 8 and cause them to make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by Pazuzu for 24 hours. The charmed target obeys Pazuzu’s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours. Pazuzu can have up to six targets charmed at a time. If it charms another, it can end the charmed condition on one target of its choice.\n\nSummon (1/day). Pazuzu summons 2d4 succubi, 1d4 nalfeshnees, 1d4 vrocks, or 1 balor. The summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Pazuzu, but can’t summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or Pazuzu is slain, or until Pazuzu takes an action to dismiss it.\n\nLegendary Actions\n\nPazuzu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Pazuzu regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\nShriek. Pazuzu releases a blast of concussive sound in a 40-foot cone. Creatures within the area must make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 26 (4d8 + 8) thunder damage and is pushed 15 feet. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not pushed.\n\nPossess (Costs 2 Actions). Pazuzu uses its dominate person innate spellcasting ability. If it casts it as a legendary action, it does not need to maintain concentration.\n\nWing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). Pazuzu beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of Pazuzu must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be forced prone. Pazuzu can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n\nLair Actions\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Pazuzu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Pazuzu can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\nGale. Pazuzu causes strong winds to immediately gust, choosing a 60-foot cube within its lair that wraps around corners (Pazuzu does not need to see this area). Any creatures within this area must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed 60 feet in a random direction and be forced prone. If this would push that creature into a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled.\n\nInsect Storm. Pazuzu causes a storm of swarming insects to fill a 30- foot cube. Until the next initiative count 20, that area is heavily obscured, and all creatures within the cube treat the area as difficult terrain.\n\nRegional Effects\n\nThe region containing Pazuzu’s lair is warped by its magic, creating one or more of the following effects: Aviary. Avian creatures crowd into the area surrounding Pazuzu’s lair and have advantage on saving throws against magical effects that charm or frighten them cast by creatures other than Pazuzu himself.\n\nTempests. Strong winds whip through the area around Pazuzu’s lair, and lightning storms crash through the days and nights.\n\nClairvoyance. Pazuzu can hear its name spoken by any creature in any language within 10 miles of its lair. It knows the exact location of the creature who spoke its name.\n\nAbout\n\nThis powerfully built humanoid has the head of a hawk and four great feathery wings spanning its shoulders. Its feathers are red and gold, fading to black at the tip. Its eyes are red and its hands and feet end in hawk-like talons.\n\nPazuzu is the demon prince of aerial creatures and is revered as such on both the Abyssal plane and the Material Plane. Unlike other demon princes, its lair is not confined to a single plane or multiple adjoining planes; Pazuzu rules the sky realms above all layers of the Abyss. (No demon prince has contested its rulership of the skies thus far.)\n\nPazuzu has a great many dealings with creatures on other planes, including devils. It seems to be on fairly good terms with several powerful dukes and arch-devils of Hell. Pazuzu never enters that plane but has been known to meet with such a duke on Acheron or Tarterus.\n\nPazuzu stands 8 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds.\n\nPazuzu prefers to use its spells and spell-like abilities, subjecting its opponents to a magical onslaught of great power. If cornered or forced into melee, it prefers to use its claws or weapon. If it is outclassed or overmatched, it summons aerial creatures and demons to his aid.\n\nServants of Pazuzu\n\nFollowers of Pazuzu are evil humanoids that respect and revere the air and sky. Devout followers of Pazuzu are called Aerial Lords and must sign a pact of evil with Pazuzu.\n\nSpecial Equipment: Carriontooth\n\nWeapon (greatsword), artifact (requires attunement)\n\nThis single-edged, blood-stained greatsword is the personal weapon of the demon lord Pazuzu. Legend has it Pazuzu created the weapon from the claw of a bird goddess it dueled and lost to before being trapped in the skies above the Abyss. Carriontooth is serrated and jagged, rending flesh as it slices and slashes.\n\nAttunement. If you attempt to attune to Carriontooth, your maximum hit points are reduced by 10 unless your alignment is chaotic evil. This reduction remains as long as you remain attuned to Carriontooth; magic cannot return the lost hit points.\n\nMagic Weapon. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Carriontooth also functions as a sword of sharpness, a sword of wounding and a vicious weapon.\n\nRend. You deal an additional 6d6 necrotic damage when you hit with Carriontooth.\n\nNatural Enmity. Celestials of all kinds find Carriontooth abhorrent and are always hostile to you if you carry the weapon.\n\nDestruction. To destroy Carriontooth, it must be used to slay Pazuzu, and then returned to the bird goddess whose claw it was made from; the goddess needs to only touch it to undo the artifact.\n\nSection 15: Copyright Notice\n\nTome of Horrors Â© 2018, Frog God Games, LLC; Authors: Kevin Baase, Erica Balsley, John âPexxâ Barnhouse, Christopher Bishop, Casey Christofferson, Jim Collura, Andrea Costantini, Jayson âRocky' Gardner, Zach Glazar, Meghan Greene, Scott Greene, Lance Hawvermale, Travis Hawvermale, Ian S.
