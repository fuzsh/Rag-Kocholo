        "text": "This year marks the 50th anniversary of William Friedkin’s terrifying horror film The Exorcist, and a man by the name of Paul Davis has gotten his hands on some extremely rare, never-before-seen footage from the production.\n\nThis video below shows us the creepy rare footage of the original Pazuzu demon makeup test with actress Eileen Dietz. The image of this demon in the movie scared the living shit out of me when I first saw this film as a kid. I’ll never forget the petrifying fear it sent through my body. It’s pretty cool to see this makeup screen test.\n\nDavis, who directed films such as Beware the Moon: Remembering An American Werewolf in London and The Body and Uncanny Annie, calls the clip the “holy grail of outtakes from The Exorcist,” and he promised more footage.\n\nHe actually did release some footage on Halloween, but the video he shared on YouTube was taken down. I hope that he finds another place to share it! When he does, I’ll make to to share it here for you to watch! The video is 37 minutes long, and it consists of rare and never-before-seen outtakes from The Exorcist."
