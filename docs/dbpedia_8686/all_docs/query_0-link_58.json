        "text": "\"Do you think this is some form of obsession?\" Uncork'd Entertainment has revealed an official trailer for Of the Devil, an indie supernatural horror thriller from filmmaker Kelton Jones. This will be arriving on VOD in August, and hasn't played at any festivals. Of the Devil follows a family desperate to find a cure for their young son's brain cancer. When unconventional treatments lead to the child being possessed by an ancient evil, the parents must fight not only for the child's life but his very soul. Sounds quite unspectacular, unfortunately. With Vernon Wells, Robert LaSardo, Devanny Pinn, Vicki Gunvalson, Jonathan Stoddard, and Eileen Dietz (who was \"Pazuzu's Face\" in The Exorcist). This looks like bargain bin junk, but that's obvious considering no one has heard of this film. Not worth it unless you really dig cheap horror.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Kelton Jones' Of the Devil, direct from YouTube:"
