She was that terrifying subliminal face of death which appeared throughout the movie and she performed many of the controversial scenes that portrayed Regan being possessed by the demon.\n\nI recall it was announced early last year that she had been cast in Rob Zombies Halloween II but when the movie came out she was nowhere to be found… Until the “Bigfoot” deleted scene surfaced and … there she is screaming down the phone at the Haddonfield Police department while Michael Myers raids her trash.\n\nvery cool info fellas! i didnt recognize either one of those characters.\n\nby the way i thought some of the deleted scenes were awesome and should have been left in the movie.\n\nnow i know for some folks Michael digging in the trash just backs up their “Hobo Myers” joke but i thought it was a very cool scene and honestly, for a guy that will kill and eat a raw dog i can completely see him picking over scraps he finds in the trash.\n\nwell bud you goota remember even rob was adressing him as a hobo…some people really arent joking when they say that, i beleive he really is a hobo…but i dont think there is anything wrong with it i cant see michael really being anything else if he were to be real…i think he would still be considered a hobo even if he lived in his abandond house still…"
