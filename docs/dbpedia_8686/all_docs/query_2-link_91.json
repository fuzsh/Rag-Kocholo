        "text": "The Red Symbol in The Handmaid's Tale\n\n1155 Words | 3 Pages\n\nRed is a scandalous and dishonorable color, outlining the Handmaids as such. Everything correlated with the handmaids is red; Offred’s own name, for instance, which so distressingly epitomizes dualism can be read as \"Of Fred,\" signifying her ownership to her commander-yet furthermore can be read as \"Off Red,” suggesting off with the red dress, symbolizing her yearning for nonconformity from the red dress and all the afflictions correlated with red in her life- blood, death and violence, which have come to “define” her.\n\nFeminism In Marge Piercy's Barbie Doll\n\n1169 Words | 3 Pages\n\n“Lipsticks the color of cherry candy” (4) suggests quite a lot. “Cherry candy” obviously represents an extremely bright red color. Red lipstick has an intense connotation of being associated with sexy and sexually promiscuous women. Because red is such a sexualized color, the line really calls back to the idea of being both a young, innocent child and a girl, inescapably female. Further, the “cherry” part has quite a lot of significance as well, if not more than the color. Cherry is often used as a sort of slang term for the hymen where “popping your cherry” means to lose one’s virginity (What Does Pop). It could be that the cherry colored lipstick is encouraging the “girlchild”’s sexuality or perhaps referring to the value of holding on to her “cherry,” or, in other words, her virginity. In the last stanza of the poem the “girlchild” is “displayed on satin” (19) in her casket and “dressed in a pink and white nightie” (22). Satin is reminiscent of luxurious satin sheets on a bed or even of the material of a slinky, sexy pink and white nightie. While a nightie is a rather obvious sexualization, the colors are significant as well. Pink is often associated with women, especially young girls. It has a certain\n\nRepresentation of Colors in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale\n\n1784 Words | 4 Pages\n\n... responsible for conceiving and giving birth for a Commander and his wife wear red. The Commander's wives wear blue which is the most prestigious color worn by a woman. Guardians, as well as Martha's, wear green, which is not an authoritive color, putting them in a lower class. White is the color to be worn only by the virgin daughters until they are given to a soldier to marry. Econowives are wearing dresses that are mixed colors because they have multiple functions and little value. The Republic of Gilead believes in showing levels of hierarchy, by the color of clothing worn.\n\nWhat Does The Red Candle Symbolize In The Joy Luck Club\n\n568 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThroughout the novel, The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan there are numerous symbols to help the reader to understand the characters and their backgrounds with broader depth. Among these metaphorical images includes Lindo’s unbreakable marriage bond tied together by the red candle. The red candle not only symbolizes the powerful meaning of Lindo’s marital promise, but also her ability to honor her family, and her revelation to finally put her nearly forfeited destiny back in the control of her own hands.\n\nBeetlejuice Analytical Review\n\n1481 Words | 3 Pages\n\n...orny” gave him his well deserved bragging rights for this mastermind film. Beetlejuice won an Oscar for best makeup and went on to win 6 other awards and 8 nominations. People liked this movie, because it was unlike the others being made in its time and was one of only few ever made from a Ghost’s point of view. The music that was used along with creative camera shots helped build excitement and kept the audience attentive. The slight raise of the volume when the camera made a close up on the fly in the cemetery along with others was highly effective with the scene action. Tim Burton was able to balance comedy and the more morbid aspects of the film brilliantly. The use of various colors, especially blue has become his trademark. All the actors fit perfectly in their roles in this movie, and their acting styles only contributed to the overall success of the film."
