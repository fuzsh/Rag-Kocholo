        "text": "I got this from this guy 'Techno18' at creating a character. For his idea, he would want a demon that has a system that makes him evolve and has zero morals.\n\nBut then, I realized.\n\nNah, not only is that cliche but playing as an irredeemable villain protagonist is like playing Patrokolos Alexander (Soul Calibur V), Mitchell Shepard (Hunt Down the Freeman), Jake (Ride to Hell: Retribution) and other characters that you do not want to put your shoes into.\n\nFurthermore, using a Gaming System is just stupid. Why can't anything just act rather realistically that can be understood on a logical standpoint.\n\nSo, here is my character. Whether, this character deserves sympathy or not, it's all up to his interesting concept about it.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nName: Pazuzu\n\nReal Name: Hank Aaron\n\nTitle: The Pathogen. The Infected. The Bio-Mutant. The Evolution Embodiment. The Evolving Ascension.\n\nCharacter Information:\n\nFrom a normal kid having a normal life to a being that has been infected with a mutation by the infamous criminal known as Alex Mercer, Hank Aaron wants nothing more than to escape from the horrid existence as a monstrous mutant abomination and free from Alex's control when he finally get his wish by wisely not participating in the final battle with Alex Mercer and James Heller.\n\nFinally living a free man but doomed to an existence as an ever hungry shape shifting abomination, he would have escaped from New York and lived a free man when some kind of glowing symbolic circle appears and he blacked out.\n\nFinally waking up from his coma, he found out that he has become a Demon Lord in a new world of magic and fantasy where the previous Demon Lord was supposed to summon his own 'Chosen Hero' when the 'Chosen Hero' from the 'good guy' side, barge into his home and interrupted the ritual to a completely catastrophic level that doomed the whole world to a far more dangerous Demon Lord as when the ritual got interrupted, the previous Demon Lord has fallen under the castle where his body is being slowly devoured by a gelatinous mass of flesh until finally, their Demon Lord and instead, the title goes to the mass of flesh-like abomination that wants to consume everything with its horrifying tentacles.\n\nWaking up to find himself being granted exponential powers that increased his already powerful mutant abilities to an unbelievable level, Hank Aaron, now known as Pazuzu, will show this new world that there is no such thing as good or evil or even a peaceful life.\n\nThere is only an evolution to new heights.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nBefore, he was Hank Aaron, a normal man with a normal life and is nothing special.\n\nNow, he is Pazuzu, a shape-shifting humanoid abomination that can transform his entire body into weapons and all the while, absorbed the corpse of a demon that has granted him an exponential power that increase his already powerful mutation abilities to newer heights."
