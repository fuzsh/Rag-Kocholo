        "text": "Princess of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms Pazuzu (a.k.a. Dark Angel of the Four Winds, The Winged One, The Lady of Corruption)\n\nPazuzu was a powerful demon lady and one of the eldest and most reprehensible of them. She was also called the Dark Angel of the Four Winds and the Princess of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms. She held sway over all evil flying creatures, even among the different layers of the Abyss. Pazuzu was described as being tall and well-proportioned with unmistakably demonic features, such as avian feet, four wings that both smoked and gleamed with oil. Personality-\n\nShe was fond of corrupting mortals, especially the innocent and honest. She enjoyed offering aid that at first appeared beneficial, but which ultimately spelled doom on the victim in the long run. Her favourite prizes were the most pure and Pazuzu believed the living world provided the best opportunity for such prey. Pazuzu had a personal guard called the Six Wings of Pazrael at his command, and almost always by his side. They comprised six vrocks led by a balor, and were well-versed in reconnaissance and assassination. https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pazuzu\n\nDivine Domains\n\nChaos, Corruption, Demonic, and Evil\n\nMental characteristics\n\nPersonal history\n\nPazuzu was among the oldest of beings, predating the Abyss itself. She was a primordial, called an obyrith. As such, Pazuzu manipulated the god Tharizdun, causing the interloping god to create the Abyss. The Winged One was also responsible for the corruption of the angel Asmodeus. Seen as her ultimate prize, Pazuzu corrupted the one-time servant of the lawful gods and convinced the angel to turn on those she served. This corruption and Pazuzu's further aid led to victory, though only Asmodeus and the other obyriths knew of the demon lady's help. This costly aid was yet to be paid by the fallen angel. The Lord of Corruption was also instrumental in bringing the Blood War to fruition. Playing both sides through her connection to Asmodeus, Pazuzu maintained a balance of strength between the devils and demons, prolonging the endless war. Both Asmodeus, and a group called the Queen's Conclave, used the Blood War for their own ends.\n\nDivine Classification\n\nDemon Lady\n\nAlignment\n\nChaotic Evil\n\nCurrent Location\n\nSpecies\n\nChurch/Cult\n\nChildren\n\nCurrent Residence\n\nPronouns\n\nShe/Her\n\nGender\n\nFemale\n\nRuled Locations"
