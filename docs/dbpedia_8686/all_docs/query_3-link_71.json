        "text": "This paper examines the demons Pazuzu and Lamaštu from a cognitive science perspective. As hybrid creatures, the iconography of these demons combines an array of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic properties, and is therefore marked by a high degree of conceptual complexity. In a technical sense, they are what cognitive researchers refer to as radically \"counterintuitive \" representations. However, highly complex religious concepts are difficult in terms of cognitive processing, memory, and transmission , and, as a result, are prone to being spontaneously simplified in structure. Accordingly, there is reason to expect that the material images of Pazuzu and Lamaštu differed from the corresponding mental images of these demons. Specifically, it is argued here that in ancient cognition and memory, the demons would have been represented in a more cognitively optimal manner. This hypothesis is further supported by a detailed consideration of the full repertoire of iconographic and textual sources.\n\nLamaštu is known as a baby-snatching demon that attacks especially children and pregnant women but also men and cattle. Rituals and apotropaic amulets were used in Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the Levant to protect persons and animals from this malevolent demon. These amulets were canonized in Assyria during the 1st millennium BCE. As a result, elaborated amulets depicting Lamaštu herself and several Zwischenwesen (urigallū, ugallu and lulal, apkallu and Pazuzu), as well as the afflicted patient and the āšipu-priest were created. This paper aims to examine the congruency between iconographic narrative and performed ritual. Furthermore, the visual perception of the magico-religious imagery of the amulets will be examined by identifying the agents and recipients of the pictorial message. By untangling the levels of visual communication and embedding them into ritual context, some light is to be shed on one of the most intriguing subjects in the ‘Arcane Arts’ of Mesopotamia.\n\nThis paper focuses on two inscribed Pazuzu-head amulets. One is an unpublished bronze object which originates from the collection of Charles-Louis-Marie de l’Écluse, kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France since 1906. The other, which was bought in Baghdad and given to the Musée du Louvre by G. Maspero in 1883, was published by le Père J.-V. Scheil in 1894. The two Pazuzu-head amulets bear different versions of the Standard B incantation, named “Die akkadische Beschwörung” by R. Borger. The present paper analyses the characteristics of the two amulets and compares their inscriptions to other examples known from cuneiform tablets originating from Nineveh, Sultantepe, and Uruk, as well as to the other Pazuzu-head amulets. The different versions of the Standard B incantation allow us to date and identify their Assyrian or Babylonian background and their sphere of application."
