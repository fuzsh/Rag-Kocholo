Her first starring film role in TEENAGE GANG DEBS, a film noir portraying the 50's gang life, which became a popular drive-in attraction.\n\nAnother starring role followed in DAVID HOLTZMAN’S DIARY, the award winning Indy film, featured in \"Life Magazine\" and voted by the magazine \"Cinema Verite\" as number 17 out of the 50 most important Independent films ever made.\n\nEileen was cast in Pulitzer Prize winner Joyce Carol Oates' first play, ONTOLOGICAL PROOF OF MY EXISTENCE, where she portrayed an androgynous runaway. This role led directly to an audition and a screen test for THE EXORCIST, in which she was cast for two parts: The Demon (better known as The Face of Death), and the possessed Regan (the Linda Blair character). For this role, Eileen performed many of the controversial scenes that portrayed the child being possessed by the evil demon, exorcised by Father Marrin. For six months, Eileen vomited, levitated, spit, and abused the cross. Following her memorable and legendary performance in THE EXORCIST, Director William Friedkan brought her to California.\n\nAfter enduring four hours of Exorcist/Demon makeup every day, Eileen underwent two hours of makeup for a chimpanzee in the TV show THE PLANET OF THE APES and two hours for Sala, a Neanderthal Woman on the kid show KORG 70,000 BC.\n\nShe went \"bald\" to play a member of Charles Manson's gang in HELTER SKELTER. Then in the comfortable confines of ABC Studios, she played Sarah, a mental patient, on GENERAL HOSPITAL. Eileen insisted on light makeup, and asked for \"foundation, eye liner and a little lipstick, please\" -- which led viewers of this number one soap opera to identify with little Sarah.\n\nEileen's most recent projects include the independent film, SIN-JIN SMYTH in which Eileen plays a receptionist at a County Jail. Eileen's scene is set at a pivotal piont in the film where she acts alongside Roddy Piper (They Live), Richard Tyson (Kindergarten Cop), Charles Cyphers (Halloween) and Sin-jin Smyth himself.Eileen is also playing the lead in an upcoming indie film called, THE QUEEN OF SCREAMS. The film is about a former scream queen who terrorizes a group of high school kids by locking them in the local theater where she proceeds to act out her favorite roles from the silver screen."
