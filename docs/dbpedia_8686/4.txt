About the Episode

For episode 127, we welcomed actress, stuntwoman, and author, Eileen Dietz to the show! Eileen portrayed all of the iconic scenes from the film, The Exorcist, to include the pea soup vomit, levitation, abuse with the cross, and fight with Father Karras. Eileen has also starred on The Guiding Light and General Hospital, as well as work on Creepshow 2 and Halloween 2 (Rob Zombie). She is also author of the book, Exorcising My Demons: An Actress’ Journey To THE EXORCIST And Beyond, and an avid rodeo barrel racer. This is part of our Halloween 2022 Guest Series.

In our discussion, we covered the legacy of The Exorcist, working with Linda Blair and director William Friedkin, the makeup and filming of the “Pazuzu” scene, her love of becoming a monster hidden behind prosthetics and makeup, her love of nature and being outdoors, how she got into barrel racing, how she maintains her prolific work ethic, and much more!
