To celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Exorcist in 2023 we are delighted to announce that Eileen Dietz will be appearing at HorrorConUK on the 20 & 21st May 2023!! With over 100 film and TV roles to her credit, Eileen is best known for her work on 1973 Oscar winning film classic The Exorcist where she portrayed two memorable roles in the film, Pazuzu the demon (AKA the face of death), and the ‘possessed Regan’. She performed in scenes that were too violent or disturbing for the young Blair to perform. After The Exorcist, Dietz had a highly active career on television, appearing as a guest star on such shows as Planet of the Apes, Korg: 70,000 B.C., Barnaby Jones, and Happy Days, among others. She then went on to appear in Constantine, Creepshow III., Tim and Eric’s Awesome Show, Great Job as well as Winnie Gilmore in Halloween II,directed by Rob Zombie.
