This is a 8″x10″ Photo signed by Eileen Dietz and inscribed “Its an excellent day for an exorcism”. Eileen played two very important roles in The Exorcist: Pazuzu the demon (better known as the face of death), and the ‘possessed Regan’. She performed in scenes that were too violent or disturbing for Linda Blair to perform (due to Linda being a minor). This item has been fully examined by James Spence Authentication (JSA).
