For SunGard Public Sector, finding the time to properly train employees on applications has always been difficult historically. Many employees learned by jumping in without any formal training. Additionally, many areas of the SunGard organization have only one subject matter expert (SME) who holds all the knowledge on an application. This puts SunGardâ€™s customers, employees, and the company itself at risk if SMEs were to leave the company.

Agile/Scrum is a methodology that SunGard successfully implemented for developing their newest software products. However, Agile/Scrum can also be applied to non-software development. To address the training needs of the next SME for applications where they had very few SMEs, Sungard formed a Scrum team with members from all areas of the company. They then developed a generic framework with the Scrum team that could be applied to all their applications.

Participants in this case-study session will learn how to successfully use the Agile/Scrum process across departments on non-software-development projects.
