        "text": "Anyone who has wrestled with data architecture and information management on an enterprise scale understands the problem: things take a long time!\n\nAny time a new data shape or source appears, changes will be required. Any time there is a new interpretation of a particular data element, changes will be required. Any time an action is required because of an interpretation, changes will be required.\n\nNo one change is inherently difficult. Coordinating many changes across many touchpoints is very difficult.\n\nSo, it takes a long time and is very expensive, not unlike rewiring your house – but having to do it on a perpetual basis.\n\nNot to sound trite, but in the digital era, constant change is the new normal. Agile responses are demanded to new data, new interpretations, and new actions. And while many organizations might be agile in some aspects, few are agile around facts and what they mean.\n\nSo, what does good look like? It’s being agile with data and its meaning.\n\nData agility is the ability to make simple, powerful, and immediate changes to any aspect of how information is interpreted and acted on.\n\nData agility is important in any digital business model. Much like a physical business wants to be agile in regards to supply chain, manufacturing and distribution, so does any digital one.\n\nWhy Data Agility Is Becoming More Important\n\nThe reason is simple: facts and what they mean can change, often very quickly. Many examples abound of competent organizations that were caught flat-footed when facts and meanings changed quickly.\n\nFor example, the concept of “Russian investments” means something quite different now than it did a short while ago.\n\nAnytime you are managing risk, you want data agility.\n\nLife sciences may need to pivot their focus quickly in light of new information and health care concerns, such as a global pandemic.\n\nIntelligence agencies may need to quickly reposition their information security posture after a new development, such as a public leak.\n\nOnce you get past the headlines, there is a vast universe of more pragmatic concerns: getting new products to market faster, taking exceptional care of customers, managing risk in better ways, and so on. All demand data agility.\n\nWithout a better way to store, share, manage and protect data along with everything we know about it, data agility will remain an elusive goal for many.\n\nHow Is Data Agility Created?\n\nMany organizations will invest in three areas.\n\nThe first is a data layer, usually a mix of internal systems. This is how things get done on a granular level.\n\nThe second is an integration layer that tries to make the disparate pieces work more as a whole: both from a workflow perspective, but also from a reporting perspective.\n\nThe third is an interpretive layer of knowledge, guidelines, dictionaries, ontologies, knowledge graphs, and other artifacts that help people interpret what the data might mean in context.\n\nThe challenge is simple: these are disconnected investments. Facts live in one place, while their meaning lives somewhere else, or perhaps in people’s heads.\n\nIt will never, ever be agile when done this way.\n\nBy deeply integrating data (digital facts) with what we know about the data (encoded metadata) along with what the facts mean (semantic interpretations), data agility is created.\n\nData agility is created by connecting active data, active metadata, and active meaning.\n\nThe Implications Are Magical\n\nDepending on which aspects of the enterprise data challenge one has personally wrestled with, the transformative results are – well – magical. It would be inaccurate to describe it differently, unless you prefer words like transformational, revolutionary, game-changing, and so on.\n\nBy removing substantial friction, new things are now possible.\n\nThe ideal situation is any use case that has (a) smart people making decisions of consequence by interpreting complex data, or (b) important organizational knowledge that needs to be used everywhere, updated, kept compliant, etc., or (c) likely combinations of both.\n\nIf one were to take horizontal slices – that is, problems that everyone has – one could start with any aspect of information security.\n\nWith data agility, any infosec policy that can be thought of can be implemented – immediately and verifiably. Thinking more broadly, good infosec demands being able to interpret the meaning of facts quickly and authoritatively. As does being able to act immediately.\n\nNext up, the vast landscape of data warehouses, marts, shares, reporting systems, and similar. The facts are there, but what do they mean? Data agility creates the capability to quickly construct individualized lenses on shared facts, and what they mean to each user.\n\nPerhaps the next best industry target would be the burgeoning investment of analytical tools and platforms. Again, no shortage of facts for people to analyze – but is there shared and trusted understanding of what the facts mean in context?\n\nShifting to specific industries, once again we have a deep well of fascinating use cases.\n\nAnytime incoming information has to be immediately interpreted and acted on are always strong candidates.\n\nAnytime organizational knowledge is itself underpinning the product or service is also a strong candidate.\n\nAnd we often see both together.\n\nIntelligence agencies, security, fraud, and other threat-detection functions. Financial services, life sciences, aerospace, and other areas where innovation and risk must be balanced.\n\nThere is no shortage of examples in the private and public sectors that want to get much better at interpreting facts and what they mean. They want to be able to make simple and powerful changes to how information is interpreted and acted on.\n\nThey want data agility.\n\nThe Reality in Larger Organizations\n\nIf you’ve ever worked in a larger organization, you realize that there are things that might get done, and things that can’t get done.\n\nYou want to spend your time working on the former, not the latter.\n\nSomeone sees that there might be a better way to do things. But enormous friction makes it fall into the category of “can’t get done” – at least for now.\n\nPerhaps someone will try and integrate a “solution” around the existing pillars, and that fails to reduce friction as well.\n\nThe historical evidence is that the new model – a semantic data platform – is almost always introduced into a compelling use case where all others have tried and failed. By keeping active data, metadata and meaning together, it delivers outsized results in a surprisingly short amount of time.\n\nPeople notice, and are impressed. Another use case follows, and then another. After a while, a footprint is created of different functions and groups who are assembling and reusing organizational knowledge to create new business processes. As a result, they can easily share digital facts and what they mean amongst themselves.\n\nNew patterns of information management and knowledge sharing start quickly replacing old ones. New things are now possible, as substantial friction has been removed.\n\nSome might think this is a technology argument – that there is now a better way to manage both data and its various interpretations, and that would be correct. But it also is a leadership argument – that any organization needs a better way to manage facts and what they mean.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nIf you are on the front lines of helping to shape modern digital business models, you will want to know that there are new ways of doing things.\n\nWe’ve talked about the importance of facts and what they mean. Connecting active data, active metadata, and active meaning creates data agility. Data agility is the ability to make simple, powerful, and immediate changes to any aspect of how information is interpreted and acted on.\n\nData agility is important literally everywhere you look, with the only variable being “just how important is it?” There are powerful adoption patterns both horizontally and vertically, as shared knowledge about data can be a useful thing.\n\nAs a result, the early adopters are now managing information in a new and very different way than their peers.\n\nThis new way could be described as knowledge-centric vs. data-centric. In their eyes, what is known about the information becomes more important than perhaps the information itself.\n\nGoing forward, we’ll spend some time looking at the inner workings of a semantic database platform, and how it is substantially different from familiar data, metadata, and semantic tools. You’ll see familiar concepts, just used in a new way.\n\nWe also want to spend some time on organizational impact, and lessons learned. Anytime a new way of doing things is introduced into an organization, heavy lifting is required.\n\nFinally, there are wonderful implications for current and future digital business models, which are very much worth exploring.\n\nLearn More"
