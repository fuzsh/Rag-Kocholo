As companies look for ways to accelerate digital transformation within their businesses, Sungard AS Private Cloud offers a solution built to scale with customers at the speed they need to grow, with flexible minimum commitments and on-demand scalability.\n\nBuilt on industry-leading hyper-converged technology from its longstanding relationships with Dell Technologies and VMware, Sungard AS Private Cloud delivers the resiliency, control and commercial flexibility businesses are seeking.

This gives customers the ability to shift solution spend across resource consumption and services to grow and adapt at whatever speed or direction is required.\n\n\"Dell Technologies' Global Alliances partner ecosystem is critical to delivering the solutions our customers are asking for,\" said Bill McCarthy, Vice President, Americas Alliances, at Dell Technologies. \"Sungard AS' resiliency services paired with Dell EMC VxRail and Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance ensure the Private Cloud performance, flexibility and security needed to help enterprises drive digital transformation.\"\n\n\"Leveraging the right virtual infrastructure is key to every digital transformation strategy,\" said Jim Aluotto, Senior Director, Cloud Provider Business at VMware. \"By combining Sungard AS' world-class resiliency strengths with VMware Software Defined technology behind this new Private Cloud offering, global businesses can better navigate their digital journeys with confidence.\"\n\nBased on more than 40-years of award-winning experience in IT resilience and availability, a key differentiator is Sungard AS' fully automated, stateful recovery of complex solutions within Private Cloud.
