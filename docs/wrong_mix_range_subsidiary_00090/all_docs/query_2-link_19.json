        "text": "Some of my highlights from day 1 of #agile2024: - Lean coffee is always a great way to meet lots of great people and discuss interesting topics! Also, you never know when you will bump into a fellow Wolverine (Betsy Irizarry - Go Blue!) - ðŸ’œHeather R Younger, J.D., CSPÂ® gave a meaningful keynote on some of the critical attributes of an effective leader - I learned that there are 7 different types of rest from Christina Hartikainen. It's not just about sleep anymore! ðŸ˜€ - Got to see some of my friends from the Moose Herd in person for the first time: Ryland Leyton, CBAP, PMP, CSM, SA4, Leslie Lowman, ICP-ENT, ICP-CAT, ICP-PDV, PMI-ACP, and Nick Yingling - Also got to meet some of my friends from Jardena London's Transformational Leadership Community group in person for the first time: Tim Nolan and Ivan Gekht - Got to participate in a very interesting fashion show in the Audacious Salon thanks to Charlotte Chang - \"Adopted\" a cute little rubber duck from the Gehtsoft USA LLC booth - I skipped the reception last night to go to the Rangers game last night for my first visit to Globe Life Ballpark #agile #rest #mooseherd #transformationalleadership #organizationalleadership #leancoffee\n\n#Agile2024 starts in full force this morning! Gehtsoft USA LLC, one of the conference sponsors, has once again graciously assembled an Agile Bulletin they are distributing at the conference. This year's Agile Bulletin is 64 pages long and features articles from 11 different authors. My contribution to the Bulletin is entitled, \"Beyond the Buzz: The Interplay Between Agile Practices and AI Advancements.\" I share some thoughts on how agile practices can help in developing AI-based products and how AI will impact our product development practices. In the article, I reference two approaches I suggest you look into further: Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits and Quinton Quartel's Fast Agile. Links are included in the article. As a side note, I'm really impressed by my fellow authors and the insightful thoughts they shared in their articles. You don't want to miss checking it out. The best news is that you don't even need to be at the conference to read the Agile Bulletin. The nice folks at Gehtsoft have also made it available online at https://lnkd.in/e2KRKckn. #GenAI #ArtificialIntelligence #agile #productdelivery #productdiscovery #productdevelopment\n\nI'm ready for Agile Alliance's #Agile2024 and am all unpacked in my hotel room! As excited as I am for the conference to start in a bit, I had to take care of some business first. I arrived a day early to spend some time across the Texas border in Oklahoma, the 40th state I have visited. Oklahoma was more than OK (you should see their ice cream prices!). I spent this morning at the Fort Worth Stockyards where I got to take in a cattle drive. I now understand why they call them Longhorns! I am looking forward to seeing my fellow conference attendees all week. Hoping to see many old friends and make many new friends!\n\nHow do you talk with your organizational leaders about change and adaptation from your original plan? Last week, I had the honor of speaking at the Agile Practitioner's Virtual Special Interest Group meetup run by Alexander Frumkin. I shared insights about how Agile Coaches and other change agents can communicate, collaborate and partner effectively with organizational leaders to cultivate positive and enduring change in the organization. The meetup group was very engaged and interactive. One interaction I wanted to share was related to how leaders view predictability versus adaptability when looking at deviations from an original plan. Here's a snippet that captures some of the highlights from that discussion: https://lnkd.in/eMaw6n-r Thanks to Juan Carlos Sanchez, PMP for the initial thoughts that led to this interaction. Done the right way, showing leaders how you have thoughtfully adapted because you have learned that you would not hit your desired outcomes with the current plan should give them greater confidence in the team and the chances of achieving a positive business outcome. #organizationalleadership #agilecoaching #changeagent #productdiscovery #communication #organizationalchange\n\nThe next meeting of the Philadelphia Area Agile Coaching Dojo meetup group is this Thursday, July 18, at noon EDT. We are currently experimenting with focusing each meeting on one of the elements of the Agile Coaching Growth Wheel. This month's focus is on the Transforming aspects of Agile Coaching (things like org design and organizational change). If you are interested in how to cultivate organizational change, make sure you join us at this meetup! This is a virtual meeting, so if you are from the Philly area, great, but you can also join us even if you are not from Philly! We love our out of town members just as much (even if you don't know Bryson Stott's walkup song is A-O-K! ðŸ˜‰ ) In fact, we regularly have participants from across the US as well as Canada, South America, UK, and other global locations. The more, the merrier. In our dojo format, we give ourselves the gift of a safe and nurturing space for all of us to practice our agile coaching skills through role-playing. No better way to improve our skills than by doing, so why not take advantage of the chance to do so within the friendly confines of our supportive group? Given our focus this month on transformation coaching skills, we are aiming to practice with scenarios that require us to develop our organizational change skills. If you want to participate, you can sign up here: https://lnkd.in/gjJ2WY3A. Can't make it on Thursday but want to be in the loop for future sessions? You can join the Meetup group here: https://lnkd.in/gm8EVGup We hope to see you on Thursday! #agile #agilecoaching #organizationalchange #transformation #phillytech\n\nI am proud to Mentor at the Philadelphia Founder Institute, a program designed to provide structure, feedback, and a supportive network for the next generation of entrepreneurs. I am finishing up my first cohort as a Mentor and am exceptionally proud of all the founders who will be graduating shortly! The experience has been very rewarding for me. The Philadelphia Fall 2024 program is coming up soon, and you can apply using my referral link for priority access: https://lnkd.in/dfXM4eij. If you have the entrepreneurial drive and have a problem you want to solve for your customers as a pre-seed startup, I encourage you to apply for the fall cohort so that you can benefit from the support, knowledge, and experience that you will find in the Founder Institute program! #phillytech #startup #accelerator #founderinstitute\n\nThe next meeting of the Philadelphia Area Agile Coaching Dojo meetup group is this Tuesday, July 9, at 4 PM EDT. We are experimenting with focusing each meeting on one of the elements of the Agile Coaching Growth Wheel. This month's focus is on the Transforming aspects of Agile Coaching (things like org design and organizational change). If you are interested in how to cultivate organizational change, make sure you join us at this meetup! This is a virtual meeting, so if you are from the Philly area, great, but you can also join us even if you are not from Philly! We love our out of town members just as much (even if you aren't sure how to pronounce Bala Cynwyd! ðŸ˜‰ ) We are going to use a lean coffee format for this session where everyone suggests agile or agile coaching related topics they'd like to discuss. Remember this month, we'll give special priority to topics related to cultivating organizational change. Participants will vote on the topics they'd like to discuss and we'll spend the meeting talking about as many of the topics as possible! You'll get the chance to discuss agile coaching challenges and questions with peers in a safe, judgment-free space. It is a great learning experience for all us regardless of our level of experience. If you haven't RSVP'd yet and are interested in joining us, you can RSVP for the session at: https://lnkd.in/ef-TzJcj. If you can't make it on Tuesday and would like to join our group, you can do so at: https://lnkd.in/gm8EVGup. Hope to see you on Tuesday afternoon! #agilecoaching #phillytech #orgdesign #organizationalchange #leancoffee #agile"
