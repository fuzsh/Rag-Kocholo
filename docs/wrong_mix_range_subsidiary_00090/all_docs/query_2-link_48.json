        "text": "City of London Recovery Centre\n\nOne of these investments witnesses the opening of a new Workplace Recovery centre in central London, the first of its kind in a decade. The facility, which offers capacity for over 700 staff, is equipped with the latest conferencing equipment and IT infrastructure. Users have access to 10GB-ready networking infrastructure, able to cope with heavier data traffic and increasing workloads.\n\nThe new facility is perfectly positioned within walking distance of the City and works as part of a ‘near-far’ business availability solution, with many customers also provisioning workspaces within Sungard AS’ alternative facilities across the country. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook demands that financial services companies, including insurers, must implement reasonable measures to maintain continuity of all core systems in the face of loss or failure of resources, loss of information, and even external events such as vandalism or ‘acts of God’ – making this site’s location of great strategic importance for our customers and the market.\n\nProfile Park, Dublin\n\nSungard AS recently made a significant investment to expand its presence in Ireland, following a partnership with Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty), the leading global provider of data centre solutions. This partnership will provide the data centre and underlying infrastructure from which SungardAS can host its award-winning[3] global cloud platform and a full range of production and recovery solutions, and addresses Ireland’s growing demand for agile, flexible and resilient IT services. This expansion also enables Sungard AS to further invest in its dedicated Workplace Recovery capabilities, in order to cater for the increasing number of businesses choosing to base themselves in Ireland. The underlying infrastructure provided by Digital Realty’s new technology hub in Dublin enables the building out of Sungard AS’ pre-existing facility to create up to 300 additional dedicated end-user positions, where firms can relocate their critical personnel during a time of disaster.\n\nBangalore\n\nThis commitment to providing Workplace Recovery is not just limited to Europe, with Sungard AS also announcing the opening of its fourth Workplace Recovery site in India. The new 270 seat facility in Bangalore joins existing award-winning [4]facilities in Noida (National Capital Region), Mumbai and Chennai. This takes the total number of seats in the region to over 2,000. This expansion has allowed for continued new business wins and growth for Sungard AS in the area.\n\n“In today’s All-Time™ world it is vital for customers to act with an ‘always on mentality’. For us this makes it more important than ever to provide the very best Workplace Recovery facilities to our customers, using both physical and virtual solutions in the process.” said Keith Tilley Executive Vice President, Global Sales & Customer Services Management at Sungard Availability Services. “The expansion of our portfolio is part of a wider push in ensuring our customers have access to the services they need to maintain business-as-usual in even the most difficult circumstances.”\n\nThe new state-of-the-art facilities are also supported by Sungard AS’ Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) solution – for which industry analysts Gartner awarded Sungard AS the highest overall scores in the completeness of vision and ability to execute categories in the Magic Quadrant for DRaaS[5]. Sungard AS’ DRaaS solutions offer a holistic approach to business resilience that continues to reaffirm Sungard AS as a leader in the highly complex market for advanced recovery solutions."
