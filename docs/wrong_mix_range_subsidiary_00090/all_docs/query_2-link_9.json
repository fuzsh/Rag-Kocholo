        "text": "WAYNE, Pa., Nov. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sungard Availability Services (Sungard AS) today announced Managed Backup – Amazon Web Services (AWS) for enterprises looking to protect and preserve their data in the cloud. Managed Backup – AWS is a fully managed, Service Level Agreement (SLA)-backed data protection service that allows companies to back up data from their on-premises environments to AWS, giving them a more agile backup solution while enhancing their business resilience.\n\n\"Sungard AS' Managed Backup – AWS solution is well-suited to address the needs of organizations looking to refresh or augment their in-house legacy backup solutions, as well as those just starting their journey to the cloud,\" said Josh Crowe, Chief Technology Officer, Sungard AS. \"This is yet another example of how Sungard AS is leveraging its status as an AWS Managed Service Provider Partner to provide our customers with resilient, recoverable IT solutions on AWS.\"\n\nManaged Backup – AWS is ideal for organizations building a strategy to support them through their digital transformation, and aiming to modernize, optimize and cut the costs of legacy data protection facilities based on traditional physical infrastructure.

As the worldwide leader in enterprise data protection and the software-defined storage market, Veritas is pleased to help advance Sungard AS' solution that enables customers to protect their hybrid cloud data with a simple, reliable and highly cost-effective service.\"\n\nSungard AS is a recognized leader in backup and recovery, with the AWS skills expected of an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Consulting Partner.
