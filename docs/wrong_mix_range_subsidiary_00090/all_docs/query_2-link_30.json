AssuranceCM Business Continuity Software IT’S TIME TO GO BEYOND COMPLIANCE. Most business continuity solutions available today are built to help you satisfy compliance requirements, and it’s not enough. Your business and your people need more than that. YOU NEED CONFIDENCE IN AN ASSURED OUTCOME WHEN IT MATTERS MOST. Most business continuity solutions were designed in an earlier time to meet a set of requirements narrower than what you’re facing now. Those solutions are unresponsive to the minuteby-minute dynamics of a real-world incident. They’re difficult to use — even for experienced planners. They are reactive, and incapable of adapting to meet today’s requirements for business continuity assurance. Compliance risk is real and meeting compliance requirements is critical. But you know better than anyone that a fully compliant plan can also be fully irrelevant when it’s up to you to face down a real crisis. WE KNOW THAT, TOO. 1\n\n4. 2 AssuranceCM Business Continuity Software PLANS AND TESTING DON’T DELIVER OUTCOMES. PEOPLE DO.\n\n5. AssuranceCM Business Continuity Software IT’S TIME FOR A FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND POWERFUL NEW INNOVATIONS. EMBRACE AN EXPANDING USER COMMUNITY For your business continuity solution to deliver Business Continuity Assurance, it has to drive full stakeholder engagement at every level of your organization and at every stage of the planning cycle, including plan design, testing, and implementation. The solution must have the intelligence and power to capture valuable input and drive effective collaboration between business continuity management (BCM) practitioners and their less-technical stakeholders. During a crisis or incident, it has to deliver all of your people universal access to business-critical applications from any device, anywhere. It has to equip them with highly secure, real-time connection to their colleagues, plans and the most current information. That’s because empowering your people to respond effectively is crucial to driving an assured outcome. GET THE CONFIDENCE TO MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES AT THE RIGHT TIME What’s true in managing an incident is true in planning for one: Expect change and accommodate often. Your entire organization is challenged with adapting to changing environments, shifting priorities, and evolving technologies. At the same time, you’re facing evergrowing and changing risk. You can’t get ahead of that risk with a static planning tool no one’s using. In fact, your business continuity solution can only be effective when it has widespread adoption across your organization. By making your people and your process the guide, you draw on your organization’s collective wisdom quickly and accurately. You reduce the risk of incomplete and unreliable information. You prevent local incidents from becoming major business interruptions. It all comes down to gaining widespread adoption of your business continuity planning solution. AND THAT’S WHERE WE COME IN. 3\n\n6. 4 AssuranceCM Business Continuity Software ENGAGEMENT MATTERS SunGard AssuranceCM is a very different approach to business continuity planning. It’s built to drive widespread adoption, which builds business continuity competency and trust across your organization.\n\n7. AssuranceCM Business Continuity Software WELCOME TO THE NEW ERA OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY ASSURANCE. It’s not about software. It’s not about compliance. It’s not even about plans. It’s about building confidence and driving better outcomes. ALWAYS AVAILABLE, ALWAYS RELEVANT AssuranceCM is about engaging everyone to find the vulnerabilities that matter, to guide the next best action, to expect change, and to accommodate often. It’s about taking what we learn back to the planning cycle and sharing it across the organization.

The reliable data that results from engaged users helps ensure the most compliant and actionable plans. “ he biggest threat I face every T day is convincing people that BC/DR planning is important, especially in the wake of the past few mild hurricane seasons.
