SunGard announced today that it has acquired New York based Finetix LLC, a leading technology consulting firm focused primarily on the financial services sector. The transaction, the terms of which were not disclosed, is not expected to have a material impact on SunGard’s financial results.

Finetix has delivered systems for customers trading in capital markets for over a decade. Using agile and other iterative software development approaches, Finetix specializes in custom trading, risk management, and e-commerce solutions for global financial institutions, service providers, and hedge funds. Finetix will be integrated into SunGard’s existing Consulting Services business.

“The acquisition of Finetix supports our commitment to providing comprehensive business and technology solutions to the financial services industry,” said Doug Wendler, president of SunGard Consulting Services. “Finetix brings technology innovation and leadership as well as extensive industry experience to our organization that will help us to expand our offerings and thus better serve our customers.”
