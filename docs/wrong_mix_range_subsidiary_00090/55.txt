News this morning that Sungard Data Systems, the 30-something year old vendor that was itself a spin off form the Sun Oil Company, announced that Sungard Availability Services, a Sungard division responsible for disaster recover and availability services, has been spun out into an independent company.

As disaster recovery services are increasingly seen as a critical, but largely undifferentiated service, the pressure has come on vendors to react as competition from DR solutions built on top of commodity cloud infrastructure cuts into their margin base - in order to remain relevant, existing vendors need to be more agile and innovative and this is likely the reason behind the move. Sungard needs to respond to services like Zerto or solutions like Cloud Velocity that help encapsulate applications to move to DR. This point was reiterated by CEO Andrew Stern who said that:

Now that we are an independent firm, we have the flexibility to evolve our culture, our industry relationships and our investments to maximize our business and best serve customers

The new company has existing revenues of some $1.4B and operates in 11 countries with some 7000 customers. Stern is promising to ramp up investment in the company's newer service offerings such as Enterprise Managed Services, Enterprise Cloud Services,Recovery as a Service and Sungard's business continuity offering.

While this spin off will indeed give Sungard AS the flexibility to be more nimble, it strikes me that much of the barrier to legacy vendors competing is an organizational culture one - as such the challenge now is to imbue a cultural of agility within the organization - the jury is out on how well Sungard will be able to execute upon this need - some wholesale executive changes within the company are likely to be needed.
