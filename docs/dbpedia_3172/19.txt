Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is a 1974 crime film starring Clint Eastwood as the "Thunderbolt", a legendary retired bank robber who teams up with Lightfoot (Jeff Bridges), an up-and-coming thief, to recover the stolen money hidden after Thunderbolt's last job. The movie was the directorial debut of Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter), who also wrote the screenplay.

The following weapons were used in the film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot:

Mauser C96

Dunlop (Roy Jenson) opens fire on the church where Thunderbolt (Clint Eastwood) is preaching with a rare Mauser C96 equipped with a 20-round fixed magazine.

M1 Carbine

Red Leary (George Kennedy) is seen opening fire on Thunderbolt and Lightfoot with a suppressed M1 Carbine.

Colt Police Positive

Both Red and Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis) pull suppressed Colt Police Positive revolvers on Thunderbolt and Lightfoot in the car. Thunderbolt later pulls one on the bank manager. As with most instances of suppressed revolvers in films, this would not work as the Police Positive is not a gas-seal revolver.

Winchester 1887

The Crazy Driver (Bill McKinney) uses a Winchester Model 1887 shotgun to shoot at some rabbits he had in the trunk of his car.

Ithaca 37

One of the police officers opens fire on Thunderbolt's fleeing car with an Ithaca 37 shotgun.

Remington 760

When Red tries to evade the police, a sniper opens fire on his car with a Remington 760 fitted with an M3 IR scope from an M3 Carbine.

Oerlikon 20mm Cannon
