Robert McGinnis is the artist for the poster.\n\nThe poster measures 27” x 41” and has been linen-backed for long-term preservation and display. It was in good to very good condition prior to backing with pinholes in the corners from theatrical display and a few smudges and light scuffs from handling. It was folded at the time of printing with some wear along the folds and cross-folds. The poster was linen-backed in the European style without restoration to noted defects. Linen-backed posters are stored flat and rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.\n\nPlease look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you will receive). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.\n\nThis rare and collectible poster, printed in 1974 to promote the theatrical release of Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
