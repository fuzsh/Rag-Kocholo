        "text": "The Grindhouse Film Festival presents an extremely rare 35mm print of this underrated '70s crime masterpiece, for its 50th anniversary!\n\nSeven years after a daring robbery, a group of thieves temporarily put aside their mistrust of each other to repeat the crime after they are unable to find the hidden loot from the original heist. Hardened criminal \"Thunderbolt\" (Clint Eastwood) and irresponsible young drifter \"Lightfoot\" (Jeff Bridges) form an uneasy alliance with the rest of the dangerous thieves to pull the job. Stylish, hilarious and bizarre, this was the directorial debut of Michael Cimino (THE DEER HUNTER). One of the great, overlooked American films of the 1970’s, don’t miss this rare big screen appearance!\n\nDirector: Michael Cimino\n\nRated: 115 mins\n\nFormat: 35mm\n\nIn general, the Hollywood Theatre does not provide content advisories about the subject matter shown in our theatre.
