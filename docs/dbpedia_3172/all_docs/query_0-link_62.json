Extortion. Sometimes, even assassination. For the tradition-bound mob bosses of Manhattan’s Chinatown, there are age-old ways of running things. And now there’s police captain Stanley White’s way.\n\nMickey Rourke portrays White, a war veteran who has a Vietnam-sized chip on his shoulder when dealing with an emerging blood feud in Chinatown. John Lone plays the crime lord standing in the line of fire of White’s relentless campaign. And Academy Award®-winning* director Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot), working from a screenplay based on the novel by Robert Daley (Prince of the City) and coscripted by Oliver Stone, fills the screen with adrenaline rushes of action and excitement."
