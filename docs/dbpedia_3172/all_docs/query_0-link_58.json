        "text": "NOTE: The below Blu-ray captures were taken directly from the Blu-ray disc.ADDITION: Imprint Blu-ray (April 2021): Imprint has released Michael Cimino's \"Year of the Dragon\" on a new dual-layered Blu-ray disc. The 1080p HD image is in the 2.34:1 aspect ratio, and features a high bitrate. When compared to the previous Warner DVD, not only is the picture quality leaps and bounds better in most categories (detail / contrast /color / texture) but the frame has shifted, showing more information in the right side of the frame while losing a bit on the left, with the top of the frame opening up just a tad. There is no press release info (to my knowledge) as to what source was used for this new Blu-ray other than this is a \"1080p high definition presentation from MGM.\" I have heard through the grapevine that this is the MGM HD master from years back, previously released to the Region 'B' side of the world. I am also aware that there was a new 2K scan restoration of the film a few years back from Warner Archive, which could be in the actual 2.39:1 ratio (a guess, since we can assume that this Imprint Blu-ray and the older Warner DVD omit some information on one side of the frame, depending on which version you are watching). This is a picture full of colors, with large exterior scenes featuring many extras, so the added level of detail (and the more accurate colors) that Blu-ray provides is very evident in this new Image Blu-ray disc. While I can only speculate, I imagine that if one day in the future someone gets a hold of the original film negative (if they haven't already), there could theoretically be a better transfer, though this is no slouch.\n\nNOTE: Chris O'Neill tells us in FB: \"Im the chap who contributed a video essay to this release and while putting it together did some comparisons. Ignore the DVD colour timing, its been boasted and brightened, as is often the case for DVD transfers. Ive seen both the US Blu and the Australian Imprint Blu. The US Blu is a much brighter transfer, and initially I thought it looked nicer BUT the darker, slightly muted colours are more like I remember the film from when I saw a 70mm print almost twenty years ago. Foggy memories admittedly - however, if you watch the original theatrical trailer youll see that the colour timing looks pretty darn close to Imprints transfer. I think the Carlotta transfer is the same as Imprints. Honestly - I believe the Imprint edition is the best, and Im not just saying that because I contributed to it.\"\n\nImprint's new Blu-ray of \"Year of the Dragon\" offers two audio options. The first is the film's original stereo 2.0, in 24-bit linear PCM. Imprint has also included a 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio option, also in 24-bit. While the surround effects are certainly working during the more explosive scenes, while keeping the dialogue in the front channel, purists may decide that the original stereo track is for them. David Mansfield's (Heaven's Gate, The Apostle) unique score shines through no matter which track you choose. There are optional English subtitles, and English HOH subtitles on this Region 'Free' Blu-ray from Imprint.\n\nImprint has included the previous extras (the 2005 Cimino commentary/theatrical trailer) as well as a handful of new ones that are worth your time. First up is a brand new commentary with film critic / essayist / journalist / author Peter Tonguette. The author has written books on Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich but here he sets his sights on the man of the hour, Cimino. Tonguette starts out by discussing some genre distinctions and how this film avoids certain stylistic choices, while going all-in on some others. The writer then mentions the significance of this 4th film by Cimino as opposed to the 4th films of directors such as Hitchcock, Scorsese, etc. (they went on to make dozens more, Cimino didn't). This is all just the first 5-minutes but I guarantee you that what follows is a thoughtful and scholarly look into the film, the genre(s) and Cimino's work. The 13-minute \"From Heaven To Chinatown: David Mansfield on Michael Cimino\" is an interview with the composer, wherein he discusses how he came to work with Cimino first as an on-screen musician in \"Heaven's Gate\". The collaboration went so well that Cimino asked him to work on the \"Year of the Dragon\". The composer explains how his choice of score is a hybrid of synth/orchestra which reflects the picture with its depictions of the underworld and the police. Whether it is the funeral procession band music or the score itself, Mansfield was involved in the music, and this is an interesting, if much too brief, audio interview (edited to images and shots from the film). \"Prince of The City: Talking Triads, Cops & New Yorks mean streets\" is a 17-minute interview with author Robert Daley. Daley grew up fascinated by books and his passion turned into a profession. The author talks of getting the gig to write about the real-life Serpico, which led to Daley having real power and influence with the Police Dept. Daley goes on to discuss how he has written 8 books that were optioned for films (with 6 of them becoming actual pictures) and how little say he had in what lines of his were actually in the finished product. I won't spoil the rest but any fan of the film (or Daley's writing) should check out this interview. \"Introducing Ariane\" is a roughly 18-minute video essay on model/actress Ariane Koizumi (by Chris O'Neill). This is a fascinating look into \"The Year of the Dragon\", Koizumi (referred to as \"Ariane\" only, in the titles), and her career. The film's theatrical trailer and an image gallery round out this Region 'Free' Blu-ray from Imprint.\n\nCimino's small but interesting body of work is a varied lot. While some may think that the film was a misfire or that Rourke was miscast, the film equally has legions of fans. Certain aspects of the film are quite successful, from the set design to the completely go-for-broke script. Imprint's new Blu-ray is really a noted advancement over the Warner DVD from years ago. The new extras are also worth checking out, especially Peter Tonguette's audio commentary. While I know fans are divided on this title, this is surely a beneficial release for Year of the Dragon.\n\nColin Zavitz"
