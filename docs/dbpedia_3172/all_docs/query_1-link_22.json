        "text": "Sometimes after coming out of yet another lackluster movie—the\n\nkind made without any sort of personal touch or unique vision—I find myself\n\nthinking about what I would do if I wound up in the highest corridors of power\n\nin the film industry with the ability to make anything that I wanted. Although\n\nI have come up with any number of such dream projects in my head over the years,\n\none of my favorites was the notion to bring back controversial filmmaker\n\nMichael Cimino, the man who became the toast of Hollywood with only his second\n\ndirectorial effort, the Vietnam epic “The Deer Hunter” (1978) and its ultimate\n\npariah with his third, the Western epic “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), and let him do\n\nwhatever he wanted. Sure, the results might have outraged or annoyed certain\n\nportions of the moviegoing audience, and the financiers might have had\n\ncoronaries at the thought of letting the man behind one of the industry’s most\n\ninfamous (and infamously expensive) box-office flops indulge himself once again,\n\nbut whatever this dream project might have been, it certainly would have been\n\nmore interesting than the vast majority of what has been passing for filmed\n\nentertainment in recent years.\n\nAlas, even if the machinations to give me that sort of power were\n\nto somehow occur, that dream officially ended with the announcement of Cimino’s\n\ndeath today at the age of 77 by Thierry Fremaux, the director of the Cannes\n\nFilm Festival. Since it has been 20 years since the release of his last feature\n\nfilm and nearly a decade since his last directorial effort, a contribution to\n\n2007 anthology feature “To Each His Own Cinema,” the impact of his loss may not\n\nbe immediately felt, but for those who equate his name with the impact of his\n\nadmittedly brief artistic output (a mere seven features) rather than the\n\ncircumstances of his downfall in the industry, his passing should inspire\n\nreflection on what proved to be one of the most audacious careers in modern\n\ncinema as well as a bit of ruing over the tantalizing projects that wound up\n\nnever getting made along the way.\n\nBorn in New York on February 3, 1939—though some have questioned\n\nthe veracity of this date, along with other aspects of the personal life that\n\nhe tended to keep shrouded in as much secrecy as possible—Cimino attended Michigan\n\nState University before graduating from Yale in 1961 and receiving his MFA from\n\nthere two years later for painting. After that, he went into the advertising\n\nbusiness and made successful commercials for companies like Pepsi, United\n\nAirlines and Kool cigarettes—considering how he would be criticized in later\n\nyears for the elongated nature of some of his films, it is ironic that he would\n\nfirst achieve success in a medium in which economy of narrative was so\n\nimportant. In 1971, he went to Los Angeles to break into films and began\n\ngetting work as a screenwriter. He first served as a co-writer of the\n\necologically-oriented science-fiction hit “Silent Running” (1972) and later did\n\na rewrite on John Milius’ screenplay for “Magnum Force” (1973), the first\n\nsequel to the enormously popular Clint Eastwood vehicle “Dirty Harry.”\n\nThat film might not have been a profound or powerful work, but it\n\nmade a lot of money, and, more importantly, those screenplay contributions\n\nimpressed Eastwood so much that he agreed to star in what would be Cimino’s\n\ndirectorial debut, the action-comedy “Thunderbolt & Lightfoot” (1974). In\n\nthat film, Eastwood played a legendary bank robber who winds up joining forces\n\nwith a goofy auto thief (Jeff Bridges) and his former partners (Geoffrey Lewis\n\nand George Kennedy), who think that he double-crossed him. Combining violent\n\naction with oddball comedy and culminating with an unexpectedly downbeat\n\nending, the film never quite caught on with audiences—those who might have\n\nliked the humor stayed away because of the violence and vice versa—but those\n\nwho did see it tended to like what they saw—Bridges received an Oscar\n\nnomination for Best Supporting Actor while critics singled out Cimino, who also\n\nwrote the screenplay, as someone to look out for in the future.\n\nCimino was courted by producer Michael Deeley to do some work on\n\n“The Man Who Came to Play,” an unproduced screenplay that he owned dealing with\n\npeople playing Russian roulette in Las Vegas. There are many stories about how\n\nthis piece eventually became the film that we know as “The Deer Hunter”—Cimino\n\nclaimed to have rewritten the entire thing himself while credited co-writer\n\nDeric Washburn (who collaborated with Cimino on “Silent Running”) said that he\n\ndid much of the writing only to be unceremoniously fired by Cimino. Whoever did\n\nwhat (the final credits gave Washburn sole screenplay credit and Cimino story\n\ncredit along with Washburn and the two authors of the original “The Man Who\n\nCame to Play”), the results were strong enough to get Cimino the go-ahead to\n\nmake the film and to bring in a cast that included Robert De Niro, Christopher\n\nWalken, John Cazale and the virtually unknown Meryl Streep. Despite the film\n\nbeing a risky project—Vietnam films were considered to be box-office poison\n\nback then—Cimino indulged in his penchant for realism at all costs (such as\n\nfilming the harrowing Vietnam sequences in Thailand instead of in a studio),\n\nand by the time shooting wrapped up, he had gone over schedule and nearly\n\ndoubled the budget in amassing over 600,000 feet of printed film that would\n\nfinally boil down to a three-hour film that Universal Studios was\n\nunderstandably nervous about distributing. Astonishingly, the gamble paid off\n\nas the film went on to become a surprise commercial hit and won five Oscars,\n\nincluding two for Cimino for Best Picture and Director.\n\nIt makes some perverse sense, I suppose, that Cimino’s most\n\npopular film would turn out to be the one that I find the most difficult to\n\ndefend. As many critics of the film (and there were many, including Jane Fonda,\n\nwhose own Vietnam-related film, “Coming Home” was coming out at the same time)\n\nremarked at the time, the depiction of the Vietnamese as little more than\n\nsubhuman savages straight out of an old propaganda movie was somewhat troubling\n\nand there was no proof that there was a single documented case of Russian roulette—the\n\ngame that makes up the film’s central metaphor—being played during the Vietnam\n\nWar, let alone at the level depicted by Cimino, who rebutted by stating that\n\nhis movie was not necessarily meant to be literally accurate. Beyond those\n\ncontroversies, there is the inescapable fact that the film is more than a\n\nlittle self-indulgent at times—the much-discussed opening wedding sequence goes\n\non for so long (almost an hour of screen time) that even the most patient of\n\nviewers may find themselves wishing that they were at a real wedding instead.\n\nAnd yet, while I seriously dislike this particular film, I cannot deny that\n\nthere is a special power to it—it has the kind of epic and\n\nnovelistic sweep that few American films other than the “Godfather” movies and\n\n“Nashville” were attempting at the time and Cimino proved to be equally good at\n\ngetting performances out of his actors (including Walken, who would win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his haunted portrayal of the one who survived Vietnam\n\nphysically but not mentally) as he was in creating big and showy moments that\n\nsimply overwhelmed viewers.\n\nAt that point, Cimino was in the rarefied position in which he\n\ncould essentially do anything that he wanted as his next project and decided to\n\nuse that to take a screenplay that he wrote back in 1971, a historical Western\n\ntitled “The Johnson County War.” Loosely based on the 1890’s skirmish of the\n\nsame name between European settlers and the American land barons driven to\n\nviolent measures to claim their lands for themselves, the project was shelved\n\nback in the day for not being able to attract big stars, but at this point\n\nCimino was the star, and he was able to convince United Artists, a studio that\n\nwas reeling from the recent defection of five top executives and needing to\n\ndemonstrate to the industry that it was still a player, to give him a cast\n\nincluding Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (then a complete unknown to\n\nAmerican audiences) and Walken, an initial budget of $11.5 million and complete\n\ncontrol over everything to bring it to the screen under the new title of\n\n“Heaven’s Gate.” What happened next is now Hollywood legend and if you do not\n\nalready know the story, you should read “Final Cut,” a blow-by-blow account of\n\nits production and ultimate reception by then-studio executive Steven Bach that\n\npulls few punches in showing how the combination of an out-of-control\n\nproduction and a corporate mindset that had no real idea of how to deal with\n\nartistic types could lead to the kind of disaster that occurred here. Suffice\n\nit to say, the film was such an enormous critical and commercial failure that\n\nit was pulled from release after a week and recut from nearly four hours to two\n\nand a half, and when that shorter version failed to inspire any interest, certainly\n\nnot enough to recoup the then-record-breaking $36 million price tag, the studio\n\nitself went actually went under and was eventually bought up by MGM.\n\nAs I said, read “Final Cut,” because while it does have an\n\nundeniably anti-Cimino perspective, it remains one of the most fascinating and\n\ncompulsive readable books about the eternal struggle in Hollywood between art\n\nand commerce. At the same time, you should also watch “Heaven’s Gate” as well\n\nbecause, despite all the rumors and scandals and reports of megalomania, not to\n\nmention the massive overruns regarding the schedule and the budget directly\n\ntied into Cimino’s always-expanding artistic vision, the final film is, quite\n\nsimply, a masterpiece. Cimino may have been vilified for his profligate ways but\n\none cannot say that the money isn’t up there on the screen—shooting on location\n\nin Montana and Idaho and inspired by period photographs, Cimino,\n\ncinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond and the army of technicians deployed created a\n\nfilm that, with the possible exception of “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” has an\n\nauthenticity to it that puts most other movies of its genre to shame. It is\n\nalso a film that is as grandiose in its dramatic ambitions as it is in its\n\npurely cinematic ones. Cimino presents a view of a cherished part of the\n\ncollective American experience that is distinctly at odds with how the\n\ntextbooks have chosen to depict it and, lest anyone think that it is merely a\n\ndusty bit of history with nothing to say, the angry story it tells about the\n\ntensions between the haves and have-nots boiling over into violence and\n\nintolerance arguably feels even more timely and relevant today than it did when\n\nit was first released. The film also contains moments of such sheer beauty that they practically take your breath away—there is one extended sequence featuring\n\na group of immigrants celebrating at a roller rink that runs on for about 10\n\nminutes or so and while it adds little to the drama, it is so formally\n\nravishing that I cannot imagine it existing without it.\n\nAlthough “Heaven’s Gate” would undergo a much-deserved critical\n\nrehabilitation in subsequent years, it made Cimino persona non grata in the\n\nindustry. And while his name would occasionally crop up in conjunction with\n\nprojects from time to time—including unproduced biopics on Frank Costello and\n\nLegs Diamond and such eventually realized (by others) titles as “The Pope of\n\nGreenwich Village” and, inexplicably, “Footloose” (the mind reels)—it would be\n\nfive years before Cimino returned to the director’s chair with “Year of the\n\nDragon,” a crime drama that was adapted from the Robert Daley novel by Cimino\n\nand Oliver Stone. In it, Mickey Rourke plays Stanley White, a highly decorated\n\npolice captain who makes it his personal mission to break up organized crime in\n\nNew York’s Chinatown district, specifically the organization belonging to the\n\noutwardly charming and inwardly ruthless triad leader Joey Tai (John Lone). The\n\nbattle between the two of them escalates rapidly with many people caught in the\n\ncrossfire (including both White’s wife and his news reporter mistress) until\n\nthe startling last scene in which the two, having pretty much destroyed everything\n\nthey had, end up charging at each other on a dark railroad bridge while wildly\n\nfiring their guns in a final gasp of misguided machismo.\n\nAlthough Cimino brought the film in on time and on budget, much\n\nof that possible goodwill was overwhelmed by charges that the film’s depiction\n\nof the Asian community was racist, eventually leading to a disclaimer being\n\nadded to the beginning of the film. Though the film did get some decent\n\nreviews, not even the controversy was enough to bring people into the theaters\n\nand it died quickly. Cimino manages an effective balance between the\n\nover-the-top action beats (there is a restaurant shootout so elaborate that if\n\nyou are watching it on DVD, you immediately want to watch it again the moment\n\nit concludes) and the quieter moments showing life in Chinatown. And Rourke\n\ngoes so all-out in his performance that you cannot help but find his character\n\nintriguing despite his general loathsomeness.\n\nAlas, that would prove to be Cimino’s last great directorial\n\nstatement. “The Sicilian” (1987) was an adaptation of the Mario Puzo novel\n\nabout famed Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano and his efforts to liberate his\n\nhomeland and make it a part of America in the 1950s. It ended in a dustup with\n\nproducers over the running time that led to it being recut by others before\n\nbombing in theaters. “Desperate Hours” (1990) was a remake of the 1955 Humphrey\n\nBogart crime film of the same name that featured Mickey Rourke and Anthony\n\nHopkins that just simply did not come together, though Rourke’s performance\n\ndoes offer up a few live-wire moments. “Sunchaser” (1996), a sort-of road movie\n\nin which a 16-year-old juvenile offender (Jon Seda) dying of abdominal cancer\n\nkidnaps his oncologist (Woody Harrelson) and forces him to drive them to a\n\nsacred Navajo mountain lake in Arizona, had moments of real style that were\n\nunfortunately linked to a clunky screenplay and the film went almost directly\n\nto video."
