        "text": "First timer? In this formerly once-a-day blog (and now pretty much a once-a-week blog), I use an app that provides a random latitude and longitude that puts me somewhere in the continental United States (the lower 48). I call this “landing.”\n\nI keep track of the watersheds I land in, as well as the town or towns I land near. I do some internet research to hopefully find something of interest about my landing location.\n\nTo find out more about A Landing A Day (like who “Dan” is) please see “About Landing” above. To check out some relatively recent changes in how I do things, check out “About Landing (Revisited).”\n\nLanding number 2437; A Landing A Day blog post number 872.\n\nDan: Today’s lat/long (N47o 9.389’, W110o 5.490’) puts me smack dab in the middle of Montana:\n\nBefore continuing, I thought I’d pause a moment on the expression “smack dab.” I put it in the search block of my blog and found that I have landed smack dab in the middle of:\n\nthe lower 48 (Gypsum and Linsborg, KS)\n\nthe Florida peninsula (Poinciana)\n\nIowa (Kamrar)\n\nSouth Dakota (Fort Pierre)\n\nUtah (Ephraim)\n\nTexas (Rising Star)\n\nthe heartland (Hyannis, NE)\n\nMontana (Lewistown)\n\nKentucky (Liberty)\n\nColorado (Fair Play)\n\nMud Swamp (Valdosta, GA)\n\nSouth Dakota (Fort Pierre)\n\nColorado (High Creek Fen)\n\nIllinois (Elkhart and Mount Pulaski)\n\nCalifornia (Upper San Joaquin Valley)\n\nUtah (Manti)\n\nMinnesota (Royalton and Little Falls)\n\nColorado (Palmer Lake)\n\nOf course, I did some research about the origin of the phrase but came up empty. It’s an American phrase and first appeared in a publication in 1892.\n\nAlso – I’ve been told I tend to overuse some words and phrases. Maybe so . . .\n\nSo – here’s my local landing map:\n\nI landed in the watershed of the Sage Creek, on to the Judith River (4th hit); on to the Missouri (435th hit); rolling to the MM (945th hit).\n\nMoving over to Google Earth (GE), I couldn’t get a decent look at my landing or any look at Sage Creek. But I could persuade the Orange Dude to head up to a bridge over the Judith River:\n\nThe lighting was great the day the GoogleMobile traversed the bridge (a mostly-cloudy-yet-beautiful day in October of 2009). Here’s the look downstream:\n\nAnd up stream:\n\nOf course, I checked out all of the towns shown on my landing map (plus a few more not shown). I found no clear, obvious hooks, but did find a little something to write about for each of my titular towns.\n\nI’ll start with Denton. Wiki mentions that one Don Koehler was born in Denton. His name was Wiki-clickable:\n\nDonald A. Koehler (1925 – 1981) is one of 17 known people in medical history to reach a height of 8 feet or more. At his tallest, he measured 8’ 2”. He was generally recognized as the tallest living man in the world from at least 1969 until his death in 1981. His extreme height was a result of the medical condition acromegalic gigantism.\n\nHe was “only” 7’ 10” at his death, due to curvature of the spine. He died of a heart condition at age 55.\n\nHere he is with talk show host David Frost in 1973:\n\nSo what about Hobson? In the Wiki section entitled “In Popular Culture:”\n\nSeveral scenes of the 1974 movie, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot starring Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges were filmed in Hobson, Montana. These scenes were shot in the St. John’s Lutheran Church, the adjacent wheat field and in the Black Bull Bar & Steakhouse.\n\nThe movie’s producer Robert Daley traveled extensively around the Big Sky Country in Montana for thousands of miles and eventually decided to shoot the film in the towns of Ulm, Hobson, Fort Benton, Augusta and Choteau and surrounding mountainous countryside. St. John’s Lutheran Church in Hobson was used for the opening scene.\n\nTime magazine called the film “one of the most ebullient and eccentric diversions around.” Thunderbolt has an 87% “Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The RT consensus is “This likable buddy/road picture deftly mixes action and comedy, and features excellent work from stars Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges and first-time director Michael Cimino.” Jeff Bridges received the film’s only Oscar nomination – Jeff Bridges for Best Supporting Actor. Thunderbolt has since become a cult film.\n\nHere’s the opening scene, shot in Hobson:\n\nWiki lets us know that the church was shut down in 1971, before the filming of the movie. It was dismantled with the intention of reassembling the building as a Lutheran Church 400 miles away. The church’s various parts never made it to the intended destination; their final disposition (with the exception of wood for a floor in a cabin 100 miles away) is unknown.\n\nHere’s a 2008 Street View shot of the Black Bull Bar and Steakhouse:\n\nBacking up a little:\n\nI’m not sure if it was still open in 2008, but it did close down at some point and was reopened as the Tall Boys Tavern in 2015.\n\nMoving along to Windham. There’s no Wiki entry, but I did find this about Windham, from MontanaPictures.net:\n\nWINDHAM IS THE BEGINNING OF THE “BALE TRAIL”\n\nWe first discovered Windham, Montana when we made our first visit to the annual “What the Hay Contest.” You see, Windham is the landmark you look for to alert you to turn south off Highway 87 onto State Road 541 to Utica, Montana. Most years they post a colorful statue made of hay, like the one pictured below, to help catch you attention.\n\nThe ‘What the Hay’ contest takes place on the Montana Bale Trail every September. The Bale Trail, a 21-mile stretch of road from Windham to Utica to Hobson, Montana features over 50 hay-bale sculptures made by locals and folks from around the region.\n\nHere’s a smattering of the hay bale exhibits:\n\nI’ll close with this GE shot taken by David Cure-Hryciuk about 20 miles west of my landing:\n\nThat’ll do it . . .\n\nKS\n\nGreg\n\n© 2019 A Landing A Day"
