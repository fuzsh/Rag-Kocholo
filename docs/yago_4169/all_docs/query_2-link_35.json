        "text": "Archival history The Convent and Biblical School archives' fonds is surprisingly small compared to the amount of activities of the institution since its creation nearly 130 years ago. It was found as such in the archives’ room of the school at the beginning of 2014.\n\nSeveral reasons needs to be considered to explain the relative thinness of the fonds.\n\n- During the First World War, the convent was occupied by troops; a number of documents may have been destroyed or loosed at that time.\n\n- Until recent times, clercs were often used to destroy their personal records when they were feeling the end of theirs lives, probably for the sake of humility and discretion.\n\n- The documents located in the archives' room are the only ones that have been arranged and described. It is highly probable that an amount of historical archives (documents from the general administration, the Procuracy, the Priory, etc.) is still in the rooms dedicated to these offices. These documents will need to be described in the future. Moreover, current and semicurrent records also stored in the various offices will be arranged only after they become historical archives. Currently there is no records retention schedule dealing with them.\n\nThe documents from the EBAF's repository were arranged as a whole for the first time in February-March 2014. Before that, only Lagrange's collection had been arranged, by Father Montagnes, o.p., in order to prepare the beatification request for the said Lagrange. At the same time, Father Montagnes had also began to arrange Father Couroyer's collection.\n\nThese two arrangement operations, along with the inventory realised, were processed again in 2014 to get an identical arrangement plan for the whole fonds. The present inventory results from this new process of arrangement.\n\nThroughout this arrangement work, only duplicates and day-to-day accounting documents (invoices) aged more than 25 years have been destroyed.\n\nThe whole materials have been rehoused into archival containers and folders. The available quantity of pH neutral supplies at that moment was not sufficient to rehouse all the files. They might be rehoused in the future; espcecially to remove the current boxes, which are far from an adequate storage container: they do not prevent dust from penetrating into them and they are made from acid plastic"
