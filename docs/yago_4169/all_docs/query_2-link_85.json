This book is about a female figure, Lydia of Thyatira, and the difference between the pictures of her that have been evoked through the history of scholarship and those that would have unfolded within the imaginations of the first audiences of Acts. I have sought to show how the Philippi episode in Acts 16 is structured rhetorically, thereby allowing us to perceive its rhetorical force. I could not have made my way into this new rhetorical landscape without the remarkable support of my advisor and mentor, L. Gregory Bloomquist. Greg’s sharing of his unparalleled expertise in the analytics of sociorhetorical interpretation, his questions, challenges, and astute insights, provided me with the analytical mooring that pulled me back from what, on many occasions, could have been an untethered drift in a sea of research. Greg has been a gracious teacher in the truest sense of these terms, and I will always be deeply grateful for his academic acuity and generosity. I am thankful to Normand Bonneau and Christian Dionne, for their ongoing engagement with my project, for their encouragement not to lose sight of the forest for the trees, and for their faith that a forest ultimately would come into view. I am also appreciative of the support of many faculty at Saint Paul University and wish especially to recognize Andrea Spatafora, James Pambrun, and the late Kevin Coyle. Thank you as well to my cherished colleagues at Saint Paul; our talks and discussions were immensely helpful in bringing this project into articulate form. I am especially indebted to Vernon K. Robbins, the founder of sociorhetorical interpretation, for welcoming me into the Society of Biblical Literature’s Rhetoric of Religious Antiquity group: a group of sociorhetorical scholars devoted to the development of their work through regular collegia meetings. Our lively discussions over the years -vii-\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nhave nurtured my understanding of sociorhetorical interpretation and opened the possibility for this current incremental contribution to its ongoing development. I am especially grateful to Vernon for bringing new questions to this project and for the benefit of his astute editorial eye in helping to bring this book to publication. The skilled people of SBL Press have been wonderful, and I owe everyone there a debt of gratitude. This project was supported through the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada, and I will always appreciate their generous support. Also, I am highly appreciative of the generous support of the Pierce Program in Religion of Oxford College of Emory University, which made possible the publication of this volume. There are so many others who played key roles in supporting me from this project’s beginning to its end, and I remember and treasure each and every kindness. Finally, I cannot find adequate words to express my gratitude for the remarkable support I received from my husband, Doug, our son, Chris, and daughter, Alanna. This book is dedicated to them.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nPrimary Sources 1 Tars. Dio Chrysostom, Tarsica Prior 3 Philip. Demosthenes, Philippica iii Acts Paul Acts of Paul and Thecla Ad Act.

Just as significantly, the contemporary image of Lydia seems to leave scholarship at a loss as to why the author would have introduced this figure into the narrative of Philippi in the first place. The following quote aptly sums up the current state of scholarship on Lydia: The story of the conversion of Lydia and her household is a brief story (primarily vv. 13–15) that has not attracted much scholarly attention. It is hard to find any remarks in the literature of scholarship concerning the function of this story in Luke-Acts. Even Haenchen fails to comment on what Luke was trying to do with this story.4\n\nThe presentation of Lydia in Acts 16 does not seem to contribute much to the overall development of the Philippi episode. For example, Richard Hillier observed the curiosity that Arator, an early commentator on Acts, omitted any mention of Lydia’s baptism, this despite his interest in baptisms in Acts. Offering a rationale as to why that may have been the case, Hillier suggests: His reasons for doing so can only be surmised. Lydia occurs only briefly in the narrative of Acts and is of little interest for Arator: she is not of the significance of, say, Cornelius, nor does her name provide him with an excuse for a digression in which to exercise his ingenuity.5\n\nIn turn, a narrative-critical approach, which is especially attuned to the flow of narrative unity, hits an obstacle when it attempts to ascribe purpose to Lydia’s role in the overall structure of the narrative. Literary 4. Robert Allen Black, “The Conversion Stories in the Acts of the Apostles: A Study of Their Forms and Functions” (PhD diss., Emory University, Atlanta, 1985), 166–67; Matson, Household Conversion, 136, 149. Black’s suggestions regarding the function of Lydia are twofold: “The story of Lydia’s conversion functions primarily as the story of the first convert in Macedonia. It marks the beginning of an important new geographical step in the Christian mission”; and, “Another function of Lydia’s story is to give an example of the conversion of a woman of some standing” (Black, “Conversion Stories,” 169). For Matson’s suggestions see §1.2. More recently, a monograph dedicated to Lydia has been published by Richard Ascough, see §1.1.5. 5. Richard Hillier, Arator on the Acts of the Apostles: A Baptismal Commentary, OECS (Oxford: Clarendon, 1993), 23.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ncritic Luke Timothy Johnson writes: “The entire episode with Lydia and the women can be seen as a narrative interlude.”6 Yet while biblical narrative might contain rhetorical digressions that contribute to a text’s rhetorical impact, it is difficult to find occasions of narrative “pauses” as intended by Johnson.7 Rather, biblical prose is marked by its economy of narration to such an extent that literary theories have been constructed around it.8 Although the Lydia passages may indeed function as a pause between narrative events, the uncommon nature of such a biblical literary structure invites us to consider other possibilities. Two important clues that help to point the direction to further investigation are offered by Robert Tannehill’s analysis of the narrative structure of Acts. Tannehill observes, first, that the “references to Lydia and her household form a frame around the rest of the episode,” and second, that Lydia forms a literary bridge between the place-of-prayer context that introduces her and the ensuing reference to a place of prayer that introduces the slave woman with the Python spirit.9 These two narrative structural attributes, framing and bridging, invite us to explore further the possible interplay between the Lydia passages and the broader Philippian episode. Yet the lack of a defined causal connection between the episode introducing Lydia and that of the slave woman has limited the ability of a narrative-literary approach to suggest how the two bridged episodes might be linked within the narrative’s logical structure. Such unanswered questions call for an approach that can bring new questions to the role played by the figure of Lydia in the narrative. A plotline-based literary-historical approach to the text has not yielded much insight into what the author of Acts may have intended to bring to the narrative by introducing Lydia and portraying her as a Lydian purpleseller. Yet, as Tannehill’s insights suggest, even the surface-level structure of the text signals that the author did have something in mind. A first step leading toward a possible new direction of inquiry involves taking the\n\n6. Luke Timothy Johnson, The Acts of the Apostles, SP 5 (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1992), 293. 7.

For texts written in a rhetorical communicative milieu, as was Acts, rhetorical structure was an important component in meaning-making. When, in his now legendary presidential address, James Muilenburg called the academy to rhetorical criticism, he stressed that a major concern of the rhetorical critic is to recognize the structure of a composition and to discern the configuration of its component parts, to delineate the warp and woof out of which the literary fabric is woven.10\n\nIn the case of Lydia, it is highly significant that, as Tannehill observed, the Philippi visit both opens and closes with Lydia (Acts 16:14–15, 40). Moreover, the opening and closing “Lydia passages” share common lexica with each other as well as other passages in the Philippi episode.11 In other words, the Lydia verses point to an inclusio at work, a framing device that does not simply delimit boundaries but also imbues meaning to the discourse found within its limits.12 We would expect, therefore, the frame to be somehow in dialogue with the narrative situated within. While the enigmatic role of the Lydia passages presents an interesting interpretive puzzle, given Lydia’s prominent opening positioning within a narrative context of high anticipation (“immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us,” Acts 16:10), the question of the function of these passages has possible ideological implications as well. The Pauline group’s crossing to Macedonia has typically been understood as the launch of a new phase of the Pauline mission. Moreover, this new initiative is understood by the disciples as a response to a divine commission. If the encounter with Lydia is a point of departure for this apparently divinely sanctioned new phase of the Pauline mission, then the function of the Lydia passages warrants a closer investigation in order to more fully discern the ideological perspective represented by the Philippi episode. Although ideological implications for the passages have been suggested, such as that Lydia “the illustrious first convert on European soil” 10. James Muilenburg, “Form Criticism and Beyond,” JBL 88 (1969): 10 (the presidential address delivered at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature on 18 December 1968, at the University of California, Berkeley). 11.

The few attempts at connecting Lydia with the events that follow continue to be constrained by the influence of prior constructions of the personage of Lydia.14 As a result of the pervasive influence of the history of interpretation on Lydia’s portrayal, such attempts at joining the Lydia passages to the broader narrative are built on data that limit our ability to discern the rhetorically active points of connection between Lydia and other key elements of the Philippi visit and the rhetorical fabric of Luke-Acts generally. As a rhetorical figure, Lydia would both influence and be influenced by the ideology of the surrounding text of Acts 16, as well as the approach throughout Luke-Acts to people who are somehow like Lydia. In order to explore the rhetorical function of Lydia in the narrative, this investigation seeks to expand the data field and to ask questions of the Lydia passages that engage fully with the complex network of topoi evoked by Lydia. Sociorhetorical interpretation (SRI) is ideally suited to this task: it programmatically explores the rhetorical movement of a text informed by social, cultural, economic, religious, political, and literary elements that shape and configure this movement. As a result of SRI’s focus on the multitextured nature of a text’s rhetorical discourse, the questions brought to the Lydia passages can be expanded to explore the rhetorical function of Lydia within the context of Acts 16:9–40 specifically and Luke-Acts generally.15 As I entered this project with special interests in the interpretiveanalytical strategies of SRI, I found myself drawn to Lydia “the businesswoman.” She seemed to call to me from the pages of Acts, a kindred sister through occupational affinity, although removed through time and space. 13.

Armed with knowledge of ancient economics, I presented my first paper on the role of Lydia at a conference on rhetorics at the University of Redlands, California, chaired by James D. Hester and J. David Hester.16 The polite verdict: at best a marginally interesting sociohistorical investigation but without any rhetorical-critically derived insight. I had not yet managed to discover the entryway into a rhetorical analysis of the role of Lydia. My early inability to move from the sociohistorical into the rhetorical stemmed from two main impediments: I was insufficiently self-aware of the way in which the history of interpretation of Lydia was guiding my choice and perception of the elements associated with her, and I had not come to appreciate that topoi are formed dynamically and, moreover, that it is this very dynamis of their formation that animates the rhetorics of a passage. I was confident of, however, that Lydia’s prominence in the opening and closure of the Philippi narrative was strategically intentional, as was the symbolism of her name. An entryway into the Lydia puzzle came to me one day from Professor L. Gregory Bloomquist, who is at the forefront of sociorhetorical interpretation’s understanding of the key function of the topos in rhetoric. Responding to my frustration over the enigma of Lydia’s name, he suggested I look to see what Der Neue Pauly had to say about Lydian ethnography. There it was: within a distinguished tome of German historical scholarship lay the doorway to Lydia’s rhetorically constructed Lydian profile, waiting for a sociorhetorical-sensitive lens to perceive its import.17 Throughout this project, a postcard of the University of Redlands pinned up in front of my computer monitor has reminded me to keep to the task of rhetorical criticism. More specifically, as a sociorhetorical critic, I have had to examine my own presumptions and ideological perspective in order to become aware of my relation to the history of interpretation.18 It has 16.

Curiously, from the fourth century to the twentieth, we also will see one topos, that of the “courtesan,” resurface time and again in comments on Lydia only to be swiftly subsumed by an image of noble Lydia. After observing the milestones of Lydia’s image making, I move in chapter 2 (“Method”) to my choice of analytics, sociorhetorical interpretation, and explain how this systematic topos-based approach will help us to uncover the image of Lydia situated in first-century antiquity and the role she performs in the rhetorical development of the passage. In this chapter, I also discuss how Greco-Roman physiognomy, the cultural-social logic of stereotypes and conventions, is crucial to uncovering the topoi that shaped the personage of Lydia. In chapter 3 (“Inner Textural Analysis”), I seek to remove the prevailing assumptions about the meaning of Acts 16 and take a fresh look at the inner lexical, argumentative, narrational, and sensory-aesthetic dynamics of the text. Then, in chapter 4 (“Intertextural Analysis”), I will examine the historical, cultural, social, economic, and religious constituents of the narrative’s key topoi that were used rhetorically by Luke. In chapter 5 (“Ideological Texture”), I will link my findings of inner textural analysis with the, by now, culturally contextualized topoi discussed in intertextural analysis to suggest how Luke developed the rhetorical movement of this passage and how this movement fits within Luke-Acts. I will conclude in chapter 6 with observations on the rhetorical force of Lydia’s portrayal in Acts 16, as well as implications of my analysis for the future study of Luke-Acts.\n\ntion of data” (Vernon K.

History of Interpretation of the Lydia Passages Today’s image of Lydia as a pious, resource-sharing, wealthy patroness of the Pauline mission is so ubiquitous that it might seem that even the earliest audiences would have pictured “Lydia the hostess” when hearing the text of Acts 16.1 Yet, a survey of the history of interpretation will evidence signs that key elements of Lydia’s profile have been suppressed in subsequent commentary, while at the same time others have been reconfigured. This book will argue that such shifts in Lydia’s portrayal gradually reshaped the first-century profile of Lydia of Acts 16 to the point that the Lydia of the history of interpretation clashes dramatically with the personage who would have naturally been prompted in the minds of Acts’ first audiences.2 Support for this claim will unfold principally through the 1. The focus of this book is on investigating how the rhetorical role of Lydia of Thyatira contributes to the overall development of the message of the rhetorical unit, Acts 16:9–40 (for the rhetorical unit’s boundaries, see §3.3 below), and therefore the concern of this chapter is with the history of interpretation of the figure of Lydia. For the history of interpretation of episodes that fall outside of the Lydia passages but that are within the rhetorical unit, the reader is directed to John B. Faulkenberry Miller, Convinced That God Had Called Us: Dreams, Visions and the Perception of God’s Will in Luke-Acts, BibInt 85 (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 65–90, for a survey of criticism of Paul’s dream-vision at Troas; William Sanger Campbell, The “We” Passages in the Acts of the Apostles: The Narrator as Narrative Character, StBibLit 14 (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2007), 1–12, regarding the shift of narrative voice to first-person plural in Acts 16:10; and to John B.

Initial arguments for the “reimaging” function of the history of interpretation were presented in Alexandra Gruca-Macaulay, “Reading ‘Lydia’ in Acts 16: A Figure\n\n-9-\n\n10\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nensuing intertextural and ideological phases of analysis. First, a number of representative works will be surveyed in order to highlight how the history of interpretation produced the template for today’s discussions of Lydia. 1.1.1. Patristic As Ward Gasque observed in his survey of the history of interpretation of Acts, “very little information has come down to us concerning the study of the Book of Acts during the fifteen centuries prior to the reformation.”3 Even less did early commentators show interest in Lydia. However, during this period five commentaries on Acts signaled the possibility of an underlying issue with Lydia and the women by the river. In the late fourth century, John Chrysostom’s portrayal of Lydia launched a key trajectory of interpretation. In only one work does Chrysostom call Lydia by her name; in nine others he refers instead to a “purpleseller” or “purple-selling woman.”4 Chrysostom casts the “purple-seller” as a “lowly” or “humble” woman on account of her profession who, despite her lowly occupation, displays an inner nature that is “philosophic” and full of “wisdom”:\n\nin Rhetoric or a Rhetorical Figure?” (paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature, San Diego, CA, 21 November 2007). 3. W. Ward Gasque, A History of the Interpretation of the Acts of the Apostles (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1975; repr., Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2000), 7. 4. Chrysostom refers to Lydia by name in Hom. Act. 36 (twice in reference to her house, i.e., “house of Lydia”). Chrysostom refers to the “purple-seller,” “purple-selling woman,” “seller of purple” in Hom. Act. 35, 36 (Bareille); Ep. Cyr. 125; Hom. 1 Cor. 15, 14 (Bareille); Hom. Matt. 73; Ex. Ps. 113 (Bareille); Homiliae in epistulam ad Philippenses. Epistulae ad Olympiadem uses the plural “female sellers of purple.” Augustine (354–430 CE) also referred to Lydia only as “that seller of purple” in his argument on predestination. He wrote: “This gift of heavenly grace had descended to that seller of purple for whom, as Scripture says in the Acts of the Apostles, ‘The Lord opened her heart, and she gave heed [intendebat] unto the things which were said by Paul; for she was so called that she might believe. Because God does what He will in the hearts of men, either by assistance or by judgment; so that, even through their means may be fulfilled what His hand and counsel have predestined to be done” (Praed. 41 [Holmes and Wallis]). Augustine’s characterization of Lydia’s heart as a passive receptor both of divine intervention and Paul’s teaching will be further developed under Hugo Grotius, as discussed below.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n11\n\nLook again at the lack of arrogance [of the Pauline group]. A lowly/ humble woman, as is evident from her trade/craft, but look at the philosophic [heart] of her [ὅρα τὸ φιλόσοφον αὐτῆς].… Furthermore, look at her insight, how she importunes/shames the apostles, how full of humility her phrase [Acts 16:15b] is, how full of wisdom. (Hom. Act. 35 [NPNF1 11:219, modified])5\n\nChrysostom elaborates on the specific quality of this “philosophic” inner heart: And in the apostles’ time also both men and women were together. Because the men were men, and the women women, but now altogether the contrary; the women have urged themselves into the habits of courtesans, but the men are in no better state than frantic horses. Had you not heard, that the men and women were gathered together in the upper room, and that congregation was worthy of the heavens? And very reasonably. For then women were philosophically [φιλοσοφίαν ἤσκουν] formed, and the men in dignity and moderation [σεμνότητα καὶ σωφροσύνην]. Hear, for instance, the seller of purple saying, “If you have judged me worthy of the Lord, come in, and abide with me.” (Hom. Matt. 73 [NPNF1 10:443, modified])6\n\nIn the homily, Chrysostom raises the topos of courtesans and presents Lydia as its paradigmatic antithesis. Chrysostom argues that while women of the apostolic age practiced φιλοσοφία—when “men were men and women were women”—in contrast, the degenerate women of Chrysostom’s time have abandoned themselves to the customs of courtesans, and the men have assumed the nature of wild beasts. In this argument, the feminine nature of φιλοσοφία stands in direct opposition to the practices of 5. Ὅρα τὸ ἄτυφον πάλιν. Γυνὴ καὶ ταπεινὴ αὔτη, καὶ δῆλον ἀπὸ τῆς τέχνης· ἀλλ’ ὅρα τὸ φιλόσοφον αὐτῆς … εἴτα βλέτε σύνεσιν, πῶς δυσωπεῖ τοὺς ἀποστόλος, πόσης ταπεινότητος γέμει τὰ ῥήματα, πόσης σοφίας.

Πολλὴν γὰρ καὶ γυναῖκες τότε φιλοσοφίαν ἤσκουν, καὶ ἄνδρες σεμνότητα καὶ σωφροσύνην. Ἀκούσατε γοῦν τῆς πορφυροπώλιδος λεγούσης· Εἰ κεκρίκατέ με ἀξίαν τῷ Κυρίῳ, εἰσελθόντες μείνατε παρ’ ἐμοί.\n\n12\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\ncourtesans and, accordingly, infers socially normative feminine modesty and moral rectitude.7 Lydia’s words demonstrate her “philosophic” attribute: chaste modesty. In this way, Chrysostom presents the “modest purple-seller” as a biblical example of feminine propriety. Although Lydia may be a purple-seller and therefore is “lowly” in terms of status, she is not base in terms of moral character. After Chrysostom’s treatment, the audience is assured that if the Pauline disciples were to stay in the home of a female purple-seller, a home without evident male presence, it would be a proper and modest home, headed by a humble and virtuous woman. In addition to shaping the “purple-seller” into a model of feminine virtue, Chrysostom also introduced another element that has endured in interpretations of Lydia: resource sharing suggested by an offer of hospitality. Chrysostom writes: And throughout the world all houses were open to them [the disciples], and they who offered them took coming as a favour, and they came to them as to friends and kindred. For so they came to the woman who was a seller of purple [πορφυροπώλιδα], and she, like a handmaid, set before them what she had. And to the keeper of the prison; and he opened to them all his house. (Hom. 1 Cor. 15.14 [Parker])8\n\nDespite the fact that the text of Acts is silent on Lydia having set anything before the disciples, Chrysostom groups the jailer’s meal sharing with Lydia’s offer. Inferentially, Lydia becomes a modest meal provider under Chrysostom’s hand. Explicitly, in Hom. Act. 36, Chrysostom refers to Lydia as a “hostess” (ξενοδόχον), launching the prevailing trajectory of interpretation of Lydia. In contrast, three pre-Reformation commentaries on Acts—Ephrem (306–373 CE), Arator (sixth century CE), and Bede (672/673–735 CE)— simply bypass Lydia and move directly from Paul’s vision of the Mace7. To illustrate the modesty of the women of days gone by, Chrysostom cites the words of “the purple-seller” of Acts 16:15 and modifies them by replacing πιστός with ἄξιος so that “if you have judged me faithful/loyal, to the Lord” is reconfigured into the social language of honor/shame: “if you have judged me worthy of the Lord.” 8. Καὶ γὰρ αἱ κατὰ τὴν οἰκουμένην αὐτοῖς οἰκίαι ἦσαν ἀνεῳγμέναι πᾶσαι, καὶ χάριν εἶχον οἱ παρέχοντες, καὶ ὡς πρὸς φίλους καὶ συγγενεῖς ἤρχοντο. Καὶ γὰρ πρὸς τὴν πορφυροπώλιδα ἤλθον, καὶ ἐκείνη καθάπερ θεραπαινὶς τὰ ἑαυτῆς προὔθηκε· καὶ πρὸς τὸν δεσμοφύλακα, κἀκεῖνος τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῖς ἀνέῳξεν ἅπασαν.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n13\n\ndonian man to Paul’s encounter with the slave woman with the Python spirit; in addition, Isho‘dad of Merv (ca. 850 CE) skips from Timothy’s circumcision to the slave woman, omitting the Macedonian man as well as Lydia.9 Although it is certainly possible to adduce from these omissions that the writers simply found Lydia inconsequential to their discussion, Arator and Bede do comment obliquely within the very sections where discussion about Lydia would rightfully be located. The nature of these comments, discussed in ideological texture, point to the presence of an issue far greater than the omissions might first indicate.10 1.1.2. Reformation When we turn to the material on Acts from the Reformation, we find that Chrysostom’s characterization of Lydia’s feminine modesty begins to take on a more targeted profile of feminine Jewish religious piety. Also, Lydia’s occupation, which under Chrysostom simply suggested “humble modesty,” becomes a growing point of interest. In addition, the Reformation commentators show an increasing focus on Lydia’s place of origin, her name, and the possible connection between these. For example, John Calvin’s commentary on Acts (1554 CE) introduced two elements related to Lydia: reference to the women by the river as a Jewish ritual gathering and situating the geographic location of her city of origin, Thyatira, within Lydia. In addition, much of Calvin’s remarks related to the role played by Lydia’s heart in the narrative, an aspect of Lydia’s portrayal that has all but disappeared from subsequent discussion, yet one that further analysis will show is key to the rhetorical development of the text. Calvin suggested that the mention of the Sabbath suggests that “Luke is speaking about Jews” and moreover that, since the author “commends 9.

Furthermore, Calvin conforms the text’s presentation of a gathering of women into a more conventional synagogue configuration by assuming the presence of men: Since it is likely to me that prayer was shared by men and women in that place, I think that Luke made no mention of men, because either they were unwilling to listen, or they got no benefit out of what they heard. (In Act. 16.13 [Fraser, CalC])\n\nWhereas John Chrysostom had referred to Lydia through her occupational epithet, Calvin does not refer to her purple-selling at all and shows no compunction about using the name Lydia. In his remarks on Acts 16:14, he points out a key detail—“Geographers teach that Thyatira is a city of Lydia”—but makes no comment on the correlation between Lydia’s name and ethnic origin. Instead, much of Calvin’s discussion deals with the role played by Lydia’s heart: By the word heart Scripture sometimes means the mind, as when Moses says (Deut. 29.4), “until now the Lord has not given you a heart to understand.” So also in this verse Luke means not only that Lydia was moved by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to embrace the Gospel with a feeling of the heart, but that her mind was illuminated to understand.… If the mind of Lydia had not been opened, the preaching of Paul would have been mere words (literalis); yet God inspires her not only with mere revelations but with reverence for His Word, so that the voice of a man, which otherwise would have vanished into thin air, penetrates a mind that has received the gift of heavenly light (In Act.16.15 [Fraser, CalC]; brackets and emphasis original)\n\nIntroduced as a pious Jewish woman, Lydia is also profiled by Calvin as someone who has been endowed with a capacity that allows her to engage cognitively with Paul’s teaching. While the Jewish element will be retained in later commentary, the presentation of Lydia as one who receives the intellectual capacity to comprehend Paul’s teaching on a par with the most perspicacious disciples will all but disappear. In his influential 1644 commentary on Acts, Hugo Grotius made abundant use of patristic sources, including the works of Chrysostom.11 11. Henning Graf Reventlow, “Humanistic Exegesis: The Famous Hugo Grotius,”\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n15\n\nAccording to Henning Graf Reventlow, Grotius was fully versed in Greek and Latin literature and considered one of his most important tasks “to be the explanation of the historical background of [biblical] names and events that are mentioned,” using a wide range of Greek and Latin sources, including Herodotus.12 Whereas Chrysostom avoided using the name Lydia, Grotius, in his commentary on Acts 16:14, made explicit the link already suggested by Calvin’s comment on Thyatira’s Lydian location: named Lydia. It is said that the name is derived from her birth place [Ita dicta à solo natali]: for Thyatira is in Lydia wrote Stephanus. The women of Lydia were noble by the weaving of garments. (Hugo Grotius, Ad Act.16.14)13\n\nThe added gloss—“the women of Lydia were noble by the weaving of garments”—introduced an unstated premise that Lydia, the Lydian woman, was a noble weaver. Although weaving was indisputably a common female domestic pursuit, Acts itself does not characterize Lydia in terms of weaving or indeed any form of textile production. In fact, as we shall see, the uncommon designation πορφυρόπωλις squarely situates her in the realm of sellers and the marketplace, rather than the looms of domestic space. Moreover, there is no literary evidence of any kind to support a portrayal of Lydian women as illustrious weavers.14 Nonetheless, Grotius’s is an enduring image: in 1992 Ivoni Richter Reimer claimed that Lydian women were “celebrated in poetry for their textile work and dyeing.”15 The three cited supporting sources are less than definitive: (1) Homer’s Iliad (4.141) has ivory cheek-pieces for horses dyed scarlet by Lydian women; (2) Clauin Creative Biblical Exegesis: Christian and Jewish Hermeneutics through the Centuries, ed.

There is some ancient support for presenting the people of Lydia as dyers but not for depicting Lydian women as noble weavers, Pliny writes: “The Egyptians invented weaving; the Lydians of Sardis the art of dyeing wool” (Nat. 7.57 [Rackham et al., LCL]). 15. Ivoni Richter Reimer, Women in the Acts of the Apostles: A Feminist Liberation Perspective, trans. Linda M. Maloney (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1992), 139 n. 161.\n\n16\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\ndian’s Rape of Proserpine (1.275) again refers to the ivory-dyeing Lydian women; and (3) Valerius Flaccus’s sexually suggestive reference in the Argonautica (4.369) to a “Lydian bride who bespeckles her ‘web’ or ‘warp’ [tela] with flecks of purple.” Grotius’s conjecture is, however, not surprising. In the seventeenth century, the prevailing image of the ideal woman was deeply rooted in the trope of the ideal wife of Prov 31, who “puts her hands to the distaff and … spindle” (31:19). Indeed, the essence of feminine high moral character, which since classical times had been located metaphorically in the distaff and spindle, by the Renaissance had developed into a commonplace, prolifically recurring in the literature and personal correspondence of the day. Not only was the “distaff and spindle or needle” an emblem of feminine virtuosity, but also, importantly, this trope was particularly incompatible with typical symbols of masculine intellectual pursuits. When Dutch scholar Anna Maria van Schurman argued for access to education for women in a letter written to André Rivet, coincidentally, also a correspondent of Hugo Grotius’s, she decried the view that “pulling the needle and distaff is an ample enough school for women.”16 The Jesuit Pierre Le Moyne argued that women are indeed capable of “true philosophy,” as long as they do not convert their “needles and distaffs” into “astrolabes and spheres,” that is, the tools of navigators, geographers, and astronomers. Rather, female minds are illuminated with the philosophy of “decency in manners” and “stability in life.”17 By recasting Lydia as a woman of the loom, Grotius also recharted Calvin’s suggestion that the opening of Lydia’s heart involved her cognitive faculties as active participants in a divine-human collaboration: “The Lord opened her heart”: “ ‘God opened,’ by her permitting to be opened, but not by an opening in her own way, as it appears in Rev. 3.20. So, ‘to be drawn’ is said of one who willingly follows the drawer. So ‘to be given’ of what is received.” (Hugo Grotius, Ad Act. 16.15)18\n\n16.

Lydia was framed by an entire network of images connected to seventeenth-century notions of femininity. Chrysostom had begun with presenting a “purple-seller” as a model of feminine modesty; Grotius completed the picture by drawing this modesty into an ethnographic profile of Lydia as a seventeenth-century weaver. 1.1.3. Modern Historical-Critical With Heinrich Meyer’s commentary on Acts (1835), we move to modern commentary.19 During this period, Lydia’s occupation will become increasingly linked with epigraphic evidence of Thyatiran dyers. At the same time, Lydia’s elevated moral profile will develop into socioeconomic high status. Chrysostom’s and Grotius’s characterizations of Lydia’s feminine virtue remained operative in Meyer’s account, but with the advent of the historical-critical lens of his time, Meyer implicitly reshaped Lydia’s occupation by overmapping it with archaeological data related to a different purple-related profession. Whereas Grotius linked Thyatira both with Lydia’s name and with weaving in general, Meyer attempted to divorce the name from its corresponding Lydian location and instead shifted the focus to Thyatira as a center of cloth dyeing, thereby converting Lydia’s occupation of “purple-seller” into “dyer”: Πορφυρόπωλις: ἠ τὰ πορφυρά, fabrics and clothes dyed purple, πωλούσα. The dyeing of purple was actively carried on, especially in Lydia, to which Thyatira belonged, and an inscription found at Thyatira particularly mentions the guild of dyers of that place.20\n\nIn his comments on the use of παραβιάζομαι to describe Lydia’s urging of the disciples (Acts 16:15), Meyer also converted Grotius’s presentation of Lydia’s heart into a demonstration of the intensity of Lydia’s 19.

Lydia is not a forceful woman, but rather an extremely grateful one. In casting παραβιάζομαι as an expression of gratitude, Meyer also removed any suggestion of resistance to the offer on the part of the disciples. The narrative no longer leaves off with Lydia’s unratified invitation, but instead the audience can assume that the Pauline group went on to stay with Lydia before the narrative moves on to the episode with the slave woman with a Python spirit: “That Paul and his companions accepted this pressing invitation of Lydia, and chose her house for their abode, Luke leaves the reader to infer from καὶ παρεβιάσατο ἡμᾶς.”21 With Meyer, Lydia now becomes increasingly associated with Thyatira’s dyeing industry.22 Some years later, Eugène Jacquier (1926) continued the exploration of Lydia’s name and concluded that it was intentionally ethnic, but to create a contrast with other Lydias of the day he wrote: Λυδία: this woman was from the city of Thyatira, in Lydia. We can conclude that she had received her name from her country of origin, as was the case for other women, Λυχίη, Μιλησία, Ῥοδία, Φρυγία. Names, such as these, derived from their countries of origin were taken mainly by courtesans, slaves, or freed slaves. It can therefore be concluded that Lydia was a freed slave, perhaps Jewish from birth. But the name of Lydia is frequently encountered as a name of courtesans in the Roman poets, Horace, Odes, 1.8, 1; 13, 1; 25, 8; 3, 9, 6; Martial, Epigr. 11.21.—Zahn had conjectured that Paul hadn’t named Lydia alongside Euodia and Syntyche in his letter to the Philippians, 4:2, because Λυδία was not a given name, but rather a nickname: the Lydian.23\n\n21. Ibid., 312. 22. Meyer also raised a tangential trajectory of interpretation that used the baptism of Lydia’s household as a point of departure for doctrinal debates about infant baptism. Meyer rightfully observes: “Of what members her family consisted, cannot be determined” (ibid., 311). 23. “Λυδία: cette femme était de la ville de Thyatires, en Lydie. On en a conclu qu’elle avait reçu son nom de son pays d’origine comme ce fut le cas pour d’autres femmes, Λυχίη, Μιλησία, Ῥοδία, Φρυγία. Ces noms tirés du nom de leur pays étaient portés surtout par des hétaïres, des esclaves ou des affranchies. Il faudrait donc conclure que Lydia était une esclave affranchie, peut-être juive de naissance. Mais ce nom de Lydia se rencontre fréquemment chez les Romains comme nom de courtisanes, Horace, Odes, 1.8, 1; 13, 1; 25, 8; 3, 9, 6; Martial, Epigr. 11.21.—Zahn conjecture que Paul ne nomme pas Lydia dans son épître aux Philippiens, à côté de Evodie et de Syn-\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n19\n\nIn this manner, Lydia of Thyatira gains some distance from the potential tarnish found in the Lydias of literature, who were all courtesans. Jacquier’s work strikingly made clear how the formed image of Lydia of Thyatira’s propriety rendered impossible any connection with the courtesans and prostitutes who command the same name. Jacquier also associates Thyatira with purple-dyeing and then takes an inferential step that will be found in most future interpretations of Lydia: “Lydia must have possessed considerable capital to have traded in such expensive wares.”24 In other words, because a seller of a good such as purple would need considerable capital to keep up an inventory of an expensive good, Lydia was wealthy, including as a householder having servants.25 Lydia the woman of means was clearly taking shape, as was a growing focus on her economic status. Jacquier concluded: “It is probable that Lydia, whose wealth permitted her certain liberties, contributed a good part of her goods. She was one of those Christian women who supported Christian propaganda and by which Christianity was propagated.”26 Lydia, still honorable, takes on the role of a hospitable financier economically enabling the expansion of the Christian church. The historical-critical trajectory for Lydia the prominent, wealthy noblewoman reaches its apex with the 1956 authoritative commentary on Acts by Ernest Haenchen. Haenchen also begins with the issue of Lydia’s name but immediately curtails any speculation about a connection between Lydia and the Lydias of literature by invoking Lydia’s honor: “[The personal name Lydia] is frequently found in Horace, e.g. Odes 1.8, 13, 25. Since there courtesans are meant, but Lydia here is an honourable woman, Zahn conjectures that she was called ‘the Lydian’ to distinguish her from\n\ntiche, 4, 2, parce que Λυδία n’était pas son nom, mais un surnom: la Lydienne” (Eugène Jacquier, Les Actes Des Apôtres, Ebib [Paris: Gabalda, 1926], 489). 24. “Lydia devait posséder un capital considérable pour faire le commerce de ces marchandises de prix élevé” (ibid.). 25. Ibid. Jean-Pierre Sterck-Degueldre extrapolates Lydia’s access to capital even further by suggesting the possible need for transport animals, carts, tools, etc. (Eine Frau namens Lydia: Zu Geschichte und Komposition in Apostelgeschichte 16, 11–15.40, WUNT 2/176 [Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004], 237). 26. “Il est probable que Lydia, à laquelle son état de fortune permettait des libéralités, contribua pour une bonne part à ces dons. Elle fut une de ces femmes chrétiennes qui aidèrent la propagande du christianisme et dont la race s’est propagée” (Jacquier, Actes, 491).\n\n20\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nother merchants of purple.”27 Haenchen effectively closed down any future speculation that Horace’s Lydias may have been closer to what Luke had in mind.28 Haenchen also placed a finer point on Jacquier’s claim of Lydia’s economic status. Whereas Jacquier made a pragmatic argument for Lydia’s wealth, arguing for access to capital, Haenchen subtly shifts the argument. Instead of capital, purple’s symbolism as a luxury good is brought to the fore and concurrently so too are the implied purchasers of purple goods— “rich people”: “Purple goods were a markedly luxury item for rich people; Lydia will have been wealthy herself.”29 Lydia increasingly becomes associated with wealth and now too with high status by means of her relation to other wealthy people. Haenchen also shows how the wealth and its materials are put at Paul’s disposal. Haenchen suggests that prior to Lydia’s offer to the Pauline group, the disciples “had probably up to this time lived in an inn at their own expense,”30 and he concludes: 27. Ernst Haenchen, The Acts of the Apostles: A Commentary, trans. Bernard Noble and Gerald Shinn, rev. Robert McL. Wilson, 14th ed. (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1965; repr., Oxford: Blackwell, 1971), 494 n. 8. 28. Haenchen omits Horace, Ode 3.9. The Roman poet Martial too wrote an ode to Lydia, see p. 126 below. Although he does not give credence to it, Haenchen continues on with Ernest Renan’s proposal that Lydia was actually married to Paul. Renan suggested that Lydia became Paul’s wife: “The absolute purity of Christian morals precluded any suspicion. Although, perhaps it is not too bold to suggest that it is Lydia whom Paul calls ‘my dear spouse’ in his letter to the Philippians. This expression would be, if one wishes, a simple metaphor. Is it, however, absolutely impossible that Paul had engaged with this sister in a more intimate union? We cannot confirm this. The one certain thing is that Paul did not bring this sister with him on his voyages. Notwithstanding, an entire branch of ecclesial tradition claimed that he was married.” (“La pureté absolue des mœurs chrétiennes écartait tout soupçon. Peut-être, d’ailleurs, n’est-il pas trop hardi de supposer que c’est Lydie que Paul, dans son épître aux Philippiens appelle ‘ma chère épouse.’ Cette expression sera, si l’on veut; une simple métaphore. Est-il cependant absolument impossible que Paul ait contracté avec cette sœur une union plus intime? On ne saurait l’affirmer. La seule chose qui soit sûre, c’est que Paul ne menait pas avec lui de sœur dans ses voyages. Toute une branche de la tradition ecclésiastique a prétendu, nonobstant cela, qu’il était marié” [Ernest Renan, Saint Paul, Histoire des Origines du Christianisme 3 (Paris: Michel Lévy Frères, 1869), 148–49]). Renan’s speculation about Paul and Lydia rests in part on Clement of Alexandria’s claim that the “yokefellow” (γνήσιε σύζυγε) addressed by Paul in Phil 4:3 is a metaphor for “spouse” (Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 3.53.1–3). 29. Haenchen, Acts, 494. 30. Ibid., 495 n. 3.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n21\n\nIn Thyatira, a centre for the manufacture of purple dye which lies southeast of Pergamum in Asia Minor in the Lydian district, she has grown up as a pagan child. Now she lives here as a well-to-do lady known as “Lydia” or “the Lydian.” She has joined the small Jewish congregation as a listener. Now she dares to cross over into the new community and lets herself be baptized. Her “house,” relatives and slaves, follows her. Her faith is linked with action. She will not tolerate that the missionaries should stay in just any quarters. They must move to her house, and living there they now assemble the brethren who are gradually won.31\n\nHaenchen’s work thus completed the historical-critical construction of the image of Lydia as a high-standing, wife-like woman whose principal role in Philippi would be to provide material resources to the Pauline mission. This image has pervaded most of the subsequent historical-critical discourse on Lydia. 1.1.4. Feminist Approaches When feminist biblical criticism emerged, it began to ask new questions of how the history of interpretation had presented female figures. Yet despite the advent of a new critical lens, the figure of Lydia remained an unyielding construct. Lydia, now commonly represented as a “businesswoman,” retained the essential attributes developed by historical criticism. For example, in The Women’s Bible Commentary, Gail O’ Day writes: Lydia is a businesswoman who sells purple cloth, which was a luxury item for the wealthy (cf. Luke 16:9). Her business therefore put her in contact with the elite of Philippi. Her offer of her home as a missionary center and the information that she was the head of her household (16:15) suggests that Lydia is wealthy herself. Once again Luke draws attention to a wealthy woman who acts as benefactor to a growing Christian community. Lydia embodies Luke’s ideal of women’s contribution to the church: to provide housing and economic resources.32\n\n31. Ibid., 499. 32. O’Day, “Acts,” 400.\n\n22\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nA new turn, however, is created by finding fault with the author of Acts precisely for this presentation, which is critiqued for limiting the role of women to that of providing economic resources.33 In contrast, Reimer’s liberationist approach to Lydia retained historical criticism’s focus on Lydia’s status but inverted it in order to reframe Lydia as a nonelite, hard-working woman involved in cloth production and especially purple-dyeing.34 In her extensive discussion on types of purple dyes and dyeing processes, Reimer drew attention to the wide variety of purples available in antiquity and to the widespread use of purple, even by slaves. For Reimer, however, this spectrum of grades of purple, and of clientele for its products, did not in the end lead her to conclude that Lydia’s income and status were indeterminate, but rather to invert the argument raised by Haenchen and his predecessors: The common notion that Lydia’s house was very large and that her business had “brought her a substantial fortune,” that is, that she had enjoyed “economic success,” is unpersuasive for two reasons: On the one hand, at that time there was no large-scale textile production. On the other hand, it cannot be demonstrated that people who worked in the production and sale of purple goods ever played an important economic role in Philippi; there is only one purpuraia(ii) inscription at Philippi. From what has been said thus far, we are more inclined to conclude that Lydia’s work was a subsistence occupation for herself and her house.35\n\nNevertheless, the pull of historical-critical scholarship’s portrayal of Lydia’s economic success remained strong even for Reimer. Whereas most commentators extrapolated Lydia’s presumed economic comfort into high social status, Reimer rightfully distinguished between economic and social measures of worth. Yet in so doing, Reimer subtly shifted her argument to suggest that while Lydia may have enjoyed a level of financial comfort, she would have been devoid of social status from an elite vantage point. In this way, Reimer retained an echo of the history of interpretation’s view 33. For another similar example, see Clarice J. Martin, “The Acts of the Apostles,” in Searching the Scriptures, ed. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza (New York: Crossroad, 1993), 784. 34. Ivoni Richter Reimer, “Lydia and Her House,” in Women in the Acts of the Apostles: A Feminist Liberation Perspective, trans. Linda M. Maloney (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1992), 71–149. 35. Ibid., 112.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n23\n\nof Lydia as enjoying economic advantage but repositioned her argument concerning Lydia’s status in the social rather than economic sphere: Craftspeople and small merchants were also part of the plebs urbana. Even when they had a “better” economic status (in comparison, say, to beggars), so that they even employed a few slaves or freed people, they were socially despised by the upper classes. In the eyes of the upper class their economic position was insignificant.36\n\nHaving astutely raised the historic reality of a wide variety of types of purple being produced and sold in antiquity, Reimer does not move to the logical conclusion that it is not possible to form an opinion on Lydia’s economic status; instead, through a liberationist lens, she reframes Lydia as a socially oppressed textile worker whose offer of hospitality to the disciples enacts a form of resistance to Roman imperial rule.37 Though Reimer’s arguments had little impact on the mainstream presentation of Lydia as a woman of means, they did destabilize the argument on which future interpreters could present high-income, high-status Lydia. Shelly Matthews, in the monograph First Converts, argued that Lydia’s high status was used by the author of Acts to help legitimize the new Christian movement.38 Matthews acknowledged Reimer’s portrayal of Lydia’s low status; however, she did not find it convincing since, according to Matthews, the author of Acts employed “the conversion of prominent women” as a rhetorical strategy “in support of a propagandistic agenda.”39 Implicitly for Matthews, the image of historical criticism’s high-standing Lydia provided the point of departure for her argument regarding the author’s rhetorical strategy. The findings of Reimer and others that the status of female purple workers and purple sellers would likely be found at the lower end of the social scale did not alter Matthews’s claim that Lydia was a tool of propaganda, but rather served to narrow the audience for Acts. Matthews argued:\n\n36. Ibid. 37. Ibid., 114. 38. Shelly Matthews, First Converts: Rich Pagan Women and the Rhetoric of Mission in Early Judaism and Christianity, Contraversions: Jews and Other Differences (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001). 39. Ibid., 75, 87.\n\n24\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nThe audience for whom Luke writes is more appropriately identified as a group of people with some wealth and education into which persons of low status with wealth were also included. Such an audience would view a character involved in trade, who has also achieved a measure of respectability, as mirroring their own social and economic aspirations. Lydia’s status markers—a dealer in purple who is also a householder— thus positions her at least among the ranks of this “quasi-elite” class.40\n\nIn this manner, Lydia retains a high-status profile but within a smaller sphere of influence. Matthews suggested that new cults, such as the one introduced by Dionysus, frequently “drew on the topos of high-standing women as one means of mediating between their adherents and the larger culture.”41 Citing long-acknowledged similarities between Euripides’s Bacchae and Acts 16, Matthews argued that the author of Acts used Lydia toward a similar propagandistic goal.42 In the end, Matthews presented the prevailing image of Lydia: “Lydia is a well-to-do Christian convert and patroness of Paul, who extends hospitality to the missionaries in her house.” Matthews concluded with a critique of Lydia’s “portrayal only as a convert accommodating Paul and his mission, and not as a Christian missionary/leader in her own right.”43 Although Matthews did acknowledge a “symbolic richness” in Lydia’s name, she did not delve into this symbolism but instead considered the name’s symbolism a sign that she is a “character created by Luke.”44 The character of Lydia, concluded Matthews, is a rhetorical device intended to bolster the perceived status of early Christianity. 1.1.5. Most Recent Interpretations Though utilizing the name “sociorhetorical,” Ben Witherington’s interpretation simply confirms most of the insights derived from historical criticism.45 Returning to the question of Lydia’s name that had long vexed past interpreters, Witherington claims: 40. Ibid., 88. 41. Ibid., 72. 42. Ibid., 73. 43. Ibid., 94. 44. Ibid., 93. 45. Ben Witherington III, The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998).\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n25\n\nWhile it is possible that the Greek means “the Lydian woman,” there is now clear evidence for Lydia as a proper name (e.g. Julia Lydia from Sardis), and that is the most natural way to read the Greek here—she was named Lydia.46\n\nMissing the paradox of his warrant regarding Lydia’s name, since Sardis was interchangeable with Lydia and first-century audiences would therefore naturally have understood “Julia Lydia from Sardis” as “Julia Lydia from Lydia,”47 Witherington carries on: That she is mentioned by name may be quite significant. Roman women were normally called by their family’s cognomen, not by a personal name or nickname. That Lydia is called by her personal name suggests she is of Greek extraction, and it probably also indicates she is a person of some status, since it was normal in such a Greco-Roman setting not to mention women by personal name in public unless they were either notable or notorious.48\n\nLest any reader turn to the possibility of “notorious,” Witherington immediately asserts that Lydia’s occupation situated her in the “notable” category by speculating on a connection between Lydia’s occupation and a conjured imperial monopoly on purple. Witherington argues: The term πορφυροπωλις refers to someone who is a seller of purple cloth. It is clear enough from the reference to Lydia’s house and household that she should not be seen as someone of servile status, and the term πορφυροπωλις also suggests the opposite. There is evidence that dealing in this color was an imperial monopoly, though it may date from later than this period, in fact those involved in this trade were members of “Caesar’s household.” This would not be patricians but the elite among the freedmen and freedwomen (and some slaves) who were in the imperial service.… She is clearly being portrayed here as a person of some social importance and means, and as we have already seen Luke has an interest in recording the conversion of this kind of folk perhaps because they were of a similar station to Luke’s audience.49\n\n46. Ibid., 491. 47. See pp. 120–21 below. 48. Witherington, Acts of the Apostles, 492. 49. Ibid., 492.\n\n26\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nAt this point, Witherington’s use of purported historical data signals an ideological agenda rather than a historically grounded argument, since, while certain emperors had occasionally attempted to limit the broader public’s access to purple with limited degrees of success, there did not exist an imperial monopoly in purple cloth or dye in antiquity.50 Nonetheless, Witherington found recourse in earlier speculation that had linked Lydia to the imperial household. In NewDocs, G. H. R. Horsley had mused: One further tantalizing question may be raised here. AE 800 reports a fragmentary inscription from Miletos: [… Τιβ]ερίου [Κ]λαυδίου Νέρω[νος] Καίσαρος ἐπάνω τῶν πορφυρῶν. The importance of this brief wording is that it shows that the imperial monopoly on purple goes back at least to Nero.51 The person whose name is lost must have been a slave or freedman, whose function is described in Greek by the equivalent of the Latin a purpuris. The implication flowing from this is that those involved in the purple trade—who appear to be of freed status, as noted above—are members of the familia Caesaris. If this imperial monopoly were initiated prior to Nero—by Claudius, perhaps, since he is often claimed to be the great innovator in centralized administration?—we might just be able to identify Lydia more exactly, as being a member of\n\n50. “As early as the Fourth Century B.C., and continuing through the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire, there existed many industries engaged in producing inexpensive substitutes that simulated all sorts of costly products for individuals desiring to imitate the status symbols of richer strata of the population.… It was these imitation purples that made possible the widespread arrogation by middle and lower classes of the elite color everywhere. Thus, despite incipient efforts in the First Century A.D. to restrict some uses of purple for official purposes, the Second Century would appear to be the period when the general use of purple, both the most expensive qualities and the various substitutes, was at its highest intensity in the ancient world” (Meyer Reinhold, History of Purple as a Status Symbol in Antiquity, Latomus 116 [Brussels: Latomus, 1970], 53–54; see also 58). 51. Horsley’s recourse to any form of “imperial monopoly” seems to be derived from an implied link between Eusebius’s account of a eunuch being granted charge over a purple-dye works at Tyre (Hist. eccl. 7.32.4) and an inscription that reads: φῖσε μνῆμα μαρμάρινον Καθηκουμένων, διαφέρον Θεοκτίστου κογχυλοπλυτοῦ τοῦ εἱεροτάτου βαρίου. Both this and the “Nero” inscription can be understood any number of ways including an honorific acknowledgment of a patron; Eusebius speaks of a dye works not a dye monopoly. See G. H. R. Horsley, “The Purple Trade, and the Status of Lydia of Thyatira,” NewDocs 2:26.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n27\n\n“Caesar’s household.”… It must be emphasized, however, that this particular suggestion about Lydia is no more than an intriguing possibility.52\n\nBut, in the next issue of NewDocs, Horsley qualified his prior comments about the connection between Lydia and Caesar: The account of the purple-trade in New Docs 1977, 3, does not raise the possibility that the purple in which Lydia dealt was not the Tyrian murex but a less expensive dye from the roots of the madder plant (Rubia), the so-called “Turkey Red,” whose use has a very long history in Western Anatolia.… Shifts of perspective here could affect our conception of Lydia’s social status. If in fact her trade was separate from the imperial monopoly in the expensive marine dye, it does not support the attractive suggestion that she was a freedwoman of the imperial household. The possibility is of course not excluded (cf. Phil. 4.22).53\n\nHorsley’s view, therefore, is that discussion about Lydia’s purple trade needs to consider the possibility that Lydia’s purple may well have been sourced from a less-expensive dye. For Witherington, however, neither a historical lack of evidence supporting any imperial monopoly on purple nor Horsley’s retraction had any impact on his framing Lydia as a socially “appropriate” convert to the Christian mission. As Haenchen had earlier curtailed any suggestion of courtesan-Lydias with his authoritative warrant that “Lydia here is an honourable woman,” so too did Witherington with his claim that Lydia’s name signaled that she was a “notable” woman of the highest status. Moreover, not only did Lydia enjoy high social status, but also: “It was money and social status that procured women or men important roles in such religious settings, and it is no accident that higherstatus women played important roles in early Christianity as well, in this case providing a venue for the church to meet and be nurtured.”54 Lydia remains a woman of substantial financial means. Her role in the narrative is to show paradigmatically how “Luke connects spiritual dispositions to the disposition of possessions.”55 Ultimately, under Witherington’s treat-\n\n52. Ibid., 2:28. 53.

Ibid., 493, quoting Luke Timothy Johnson, The Acts of the Apostles, SP 5 (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1992), 297.\n\n28\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nment, Lydia is the “right” kind of convert who has the financial wherewithal to provide the right kind of home for the expanding church.56 Both the degree to which the history of interpretation has etched Lydia’s profile into the imaginations of interpreters and the limitations of historical criticism to tackle questions raised by the presentation in Acts of Lydia have come to full expression in Richard Ascough’s recent monograph on Lydia.57 Ascough’s point of departure for his investigation of Lydia is the historical-critical a priori conclusion: “Luke is portraying Lydia as a woman of means who owns her own house.”58 Despite Acts not providing any information about the size, physical makeup, economic or social status of Lydia’s household, nor narrating any mention of the Pauline group eating at Lydia’s, Ascough goes on imaginatively to lay out a dining room and seating plan—complete with a pictograph—for the meals that Lydia would have served Paul in her ample home: In the case of Lydia, we can again extrapolate from the typical to suggest that as their host she would have entertained Paul and his companions in the proper fashion by having her slaves prepare a triclinium and her cook prepare a meal.… The meal would have been tailored to reflect the honor of the guest, while bringing praise and honor to the host. It would certainly have included leafy vegetables and bread, along with garum (the ubiquitous highly salted fish sauce of the Roman diet), and perhaps fish or meat if Paul was considered a particularly honored guest. The food would have been accompanied by wine, diluted appropriately with water. The cook might have been cautioned against preparing stuffed dormice—a frequent delicacy—since the most common stuffing involved pork. The final course would have involved dried and fresh fruits and perhaps some pastries.59\n\nThese types of detailed descriptions clearly bring “Lydia the hostess” before the reader’s eyes; however, they also preclude any form of critical engagement with them.\n\n56.

Ibid., 48–50.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n29\n\nHistorical-critical claims, which in some cases are incompatible regarding Lydia’s status, are simply blended and quickly followed by a detailed rehearsal of types of purple, its uses, its sources, including the historically speculative “imperial monopoly”: The manufacture and trade of purple dye and purple goods was a wellorganized and important industry during the Roman Empire, and it is within this scope of occupations that Acts 16:14 locates Lydia by noting that she was a “purple dealer” (porphyropōlis). The trade of purple dye became an imperial monopoly, controlled by various emperors over time, perhaps from as early as the time of Claudius. If Lydia dealt with true purple she would have been under imperial control and may even have been a member of “the emperor’s household” (Phil 4:22). The slaves and freed persons that belonged to the imperial household were probably the most mobile group in Roman society, and thus it would have been no surprise to find one of them in Philippi. Against this suggestion, however, is the existence of the manufacture of cheaper quality (nonimperial) purple in Thyatira and the use of the name Lydia for freeborn women (as opposed to it being a slave name meaning “the Lydian”). Thus, a direct connection cannot be assumed between Lydia of Acts and the household of Caesar.60\n\nFollowing his discussion of the varied sources of, and uses for, purple, Ascough summarizes: “Again, we find in the social world of Paul’s day evidence for the type of person Lydia would have been—an independent woman working in the trade of a luxury good and supporting others, perhaps even being a benefactor to an elective social formation through her income.”61 While questions regarding Lydia’s religious background and economic and social status continue to produce incompatible assertions, what does remain fixed in Ascough’s descriptive details is moneyed Lydia—the product of the history of interpretation. Ascough writes: “In the end, I imagine Lydia as a Romanized immigrant living in Philippi, well-off, but not elite, involved in ritual piety and expressing all the typical patterns of householder hospitality one would expect in antiquity.”62 In spite of his use of social-scientific modeling, Ascough does not raise questions such as how it is that in a highly gendered honor-shame society, 60. Ibid., 76. 61. Ibid., 80. 62. Ibid., 99.\n\n30\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nan “un-manned” female of indeterminate status could publicly “press” a group of men to come into her home, or, if Lydia might have been engaged in the widespread use of inexpensive low-quality purples, how she could be seen as a woman of financial means.63 1.2. Conclusion: History of Interpretation The contemporary image of Lydia was launched when Chrysostom featured the “purple-seller” of Acts 16 as a model of modesty and feminine propriety. Within the social honor codes of the ancient world, gendered moral qualities such as modesty would have conferred elevated status to a woman. Grotius’s recasting of Lydia as a weaver solidified her genderappropriate status but also opened the way for future connections between Lydia and textile production. The historical-critical period moved Lydia into the realm of the purple-dyeing industry, while it retained her feminine honor. Purple’s symbolic elite status linked with Lydia’s elevated feminine status led sociohistorical critics to shade Lydia’s purple with wealth. What began with Chrysostom as gender-appropriate, morally derived status transformed over the centuries into socioeconomic status. Moreover, Chrysostom’s casting of Lydia as a hostess has worked alongside the developing image of a woman of means to create today’s profile of a generous “patroness.” Any number of critics’ comments could be cited to illustrate how the prevailing image of Lydia almost exclusively focuses on her perceived economic means and restricts her role to providing resources to the Pauline mission. As a God-fearer loosely connected to the synagogue, her conversion represents the winning of one on the margins of Judaism to the messianic community centered in the house. As a Gentile of some status and economic means, she represents the type of convert that creates jealousy on the part of “the Jews.” By offering her house to Paul, she uses her resources to advance the mission, resulting in the separation of the community from the synagogue. As the first convert on European soil, Lydia provides a proper example of the use of wealth by foreshadowing the conversion of other prominent women.64\n\n63. Ibid. 64. Matson, Household Conversion, 150.\n\n1. history of Interpretation\n\n31\n\nIn such interpretations, the financially endowed Lydia is moved by the Spirit to finance the church’s expansion in her well-appointed home. Increasingly, feminist interpretations have critiqued Lydia’s limited economically sourced role but have understood this role to have been advanced through the interests of the author of Acts. The image itself, with the possible exception of Reimer’s work, has not, since the historical-critical period, been in question. Against this solidly entrenched, authoritatively warranted figure, argumentative inconsistencies are swiftly overlooked and questions that should be raised remain invisible, outside of the interpretive reach of commentators. Yet throughout the history of interpretation, there have been consistent signs that on the other side of the coin lies an alternate image of Lydia. For example, the possible implications of Lydia’s name, remarked on and swiftly overwritten by a number of authorities, bear closer examination. Unearthing this alternate image, the image most closely shared by the first audiences of Acts, will be the objective of this book.\n\n2\n\nMethod\n\n2.1. Choice of Sociorhetorical Interpretation to Address the Role of Lydia in Acts 16 The goal of this book is to bring sociorhetorically framed questions to the figure of Lydia in Acts 16. By narrating Lydia as the first point of contact with an important new step in the disciples’ mission, Acts 16 emphasizes that Lydia is of interest to the author. In addition, the author focuses heightened attention on Lydia by opening and closing the Philippi episode with Lydia (Acts 16:14–15, 40), by detailing God’s explicit interest in Lydia’s heart, and by according Lydia a narrative speaking voice. Given these indicators of Lydia’s narrative prominence, it is necessary to reexamine the prevalent scholarly suggestions concerning the Lydia episode. These include the suggestion that the Lydia episode plays no role other than being an “interlude” in a seemingly isolated passage and the conclusion that Lydia enjoys high status and wealth despite an absence in the narrative of any clear indication of these attributes. Such inconsistencies raise questions about the suggestion that Lydia is introduced as a figure solely to showcase appropriate status and wealth sharing. Perhaps of greater importance, though, is the need to explore further the tantalizing enigma of the role of Lydia’s name. A full rhetorical analysis of the material here seems to require dealing with these several matters. Sociorhetorical interpretation is ideally suited to bring new light to bear on the Lydia texts of Acts 16. 2.1.1. Rhetoric and the Rhetorical Communicative Culture of the FirstCentury Mediterranean Environment Sociorhetorical interpretation (SRI), a multidisciplinary approach to the rhetorical analysis of texts, conceived and inaugurated by Vernon K. -33-\n\n34\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\nRobbins,1 arguably is the contemporary interpretive approach most sensitive to the rhetorical communicative culture from within which the New Testament texts were created. Robbins has rightfully contended that nineteenth- and twentieth-century biblical interpretation was shaped by inherent assumptions about scribal communicative culture, that is, communication that is sourced in scribal reproduction and recitation. After these assumptions produced textual criticism, the skills of textual criticism were transported first to source criticism and then to form criticism. These procedures of analysis and interpretation are biased toward New Testament compositions as reproductions of preceding texts or events, even when the final form of a writing is interpreted through strategies of redaction criticism. This “reproductive” view of New Testament texts gained further momentum as photocopying technology advanced beyond the printing press in the dominant print culture of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The result, according to Robbins, has been a “failure to recognize the pervasiveness of rhetorical culture throughout Mediterranean society during the Hellenistic period.”2 In contrast to the scribal view of culture, in a rhetorical culture “oral and written speech interact closely with one another.”3 While rhetorical culture may suggest to most people rhetorical oration and specifically the types of speeches orators delivered in the traditional rhetorical venues of the courtroom (judicial), political assembly (deliberative), or civil ceremony (epideictic), Robbins recognized that by the first century a rhetorical culture implied a fusion between oral and written communication. This fusion was materially illustrated within the education system of the time through the progymnasmata, handbooks of written rhetorical exercises taught and practiced in grammar schools.4 The progymnasmata trained students to write “traditional materials … persuasively” as a means of teaching students how to redeploy the 1.

In this way, a student was taught to move “away from verbatim reproduction of an oral or written text” and instead shift the materials into a reconfigured argument.5 An important implication from Robbins’s insights into the rhetorical culture of the progymnasmata is that the building blocks of rhetoric came not only from the common topics of elite civic oratory but also from popular anecdotes, stories, and oral traditions imbued in cultural memory. The most comprehensive articulation to date of the constitutive characteristics of writing produced within a classically influenced rhetorical communicative culture is found in Chaïm Perelman and Lucie OlbrechtsTyteca’s The New Rhetoric.6 Using the insights of The New Rhetoric, it is possible to identify four key assumptions that undergirded writing within a rhetorical culture in texts such as those found in the New Testament: 1. Broadly, the goal of rhetorical argumentation is “to create or increase the adherence of minds to the theses presented for their assent.”7 2. Rhetorical texts respond to a perceived exigence within an author’s environment.8 As a result, rhetorical argumentation is oriented toward human decision-making, and as Perelman and OlbrechtsTyteca claim, it is “oriented towards the future, it sets out to bring about some action or to prepare for it by acting, by discursive methods, on the minds of the hearers.”9\n\n5.

[Brussels: Éditions de l’Université de Bruxelles, 1958], 62). “L’esprit” was translated as “mind,” but the sense conveyed by the biblical heart, i.e., the seat of the inner human encompassing thought, emotions, and volition, would be closer to Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s intent: “Rhetoric gives first place to the\n\n36\n\nLydia as a Rhetorical Construct in Acts\n\n3. In contrast to the type of argumentation found in mathematical logical proofs that rely on the “rational self-evidence” of their premises, rhetorical argumentation relies on social logic: If judgments of reality are to provide an indisputable object of common understanding, the terms they contain must be free of all ambiguity, either because it is possible to know their true meaning, or because a unanimously accepted convention does away with all controversy on the subject. These two possibilities, which are respectively the approaches of realism and nominalism in the linguistic field, are both untenable, as they regard language either as a reflection of reality or as an arbitrary creation of an individual, and forget an essential element, the social aspect of language, which is an instrument of communication and influence on others. All language is the language of community, be this a community bound by biological ties, or by the practice of a common discipline or technique. The terms used, their meanings, by definition, can only be understood in the context of the habits, ways of thought, methods, external circumstances, and traditions known to the users of those terms.10\n\n4. Although at times rhetorical figures have become associated in the popular imagination with stylistic embellishment, such as certain cases of alliteration, when used in argumentation that is intended to function rhetorically (i.e., to influence human decision-making), figures can be considered “rhetorical” to the extent that they contribute to a change of perspective in the audience: “Forms which seem at first to be used in an unusual manner may come to appear normal if their use is justified by the speech taken as a whole. We consider a figure to be argumentative, if it brings about a change of perspective, and its use seems normal in relation to this new situation.”11 The following succinct summary of Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s presentation of the function and means of rhetoric essentially summarizes this project’s understanding of rhetoric: influence which a speech has on the entire personality of the hearers” (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, New Rhetoric, 54). 10.

Furthermore, the speaker wins adherence by creating “presence” for the main premise of the proposition. Presence, or foregrounding, is created using the topics. The different types of argument create “liaisons”—not necessarily [formal] logical connections—between premises and conclusions.12\n\nFrom Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s insights into rhetorical communicative culture, it is possible to identi"
