It gathers studies on the exegesis of various crucial passages in both Testaments and at Qumran, especially on the function of First Testament passages cited and alluded to in the Second Testament, and on critical methods developed since the mid-twentieth century in order to do so.1 The author has for years taught students that the New Testament is also biblical, that is, for a growing Jewish sect of the first two centuries of the common era it was added to a Jewish “canon,” but more importantly it fit well as an addition to the earlier collections that Judahites and increasingly hellenized Jews found helpful in attempts to understand how God worked through adversity to bring blessing both to them and to all God’s world. It brings together in one volume twenty-one studies that focus on how exegesis and its results can be developed to understand various parts of Scripture, how the hermeneutics of antiquity can be discerned by modern exegetical work, and how crucial understandings of God expressed in the Bible can be ferreted out of critical study of Scripture. All of it is an effort to understand how Scripture that was first expressed in ancient cultural contexts can be re-expressed in modern cultural contexts. Needless to say, “critical” in this context means, not being critical of Scripture, but being aware of and attempting to set aside what the modern reader instinctively brings to Scripture, and instead attempting to understand what the ancient speakers, authors, editors, and schools thereof understood of what they were trying to say that caused these particular writings to make it into a canon of Scripture. The writer is a product of twentieth-century, Western / European culture and hence of necessity thereby limited, as are we all in modern scholarship, to that extent in perceiving what our ancestors meant when they said and wrote what they did in their ancient cultural and political contexts. We believe, nonetheless, that with the tools developed since the Enlightenment, we increasingly have the means to probe as deeply as is possible into what ancient Scripture meant in its ancient contexts and can yet mean in the various cultures to which we are 1\n\nSanders, “Dead Sea Scrolls and Biblical Studies,” 328 – 29.\n\nVIII\n\nPrologue for Scripture in Its Historical Contexts II\n\nourselves limited today in all our varied cultural contexts. But we also believe that though Western scholarship is of necessity limited by its particular values, Enlightenment study of Scripture is becoming more and more equipped to probe into ancient cultural expressions of what life was / is about in order to express them in today’s varied terms. The assumption that we can do so is based on the critical observation that the Bible itself emerged out of ancient Israel’s struggles with adversity from the ancient Egyptian, Canaanite, Philistine, Syrian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman threats to her very existence. What was found helpful enough to be repeated, shared, and then passed down to their heirs emerged as something we moderns call canon. The followers of Jesus in their turn searched those Scriptures in an attempt to find answers to why God let happen to their Galilean teacher what God had let happen to ancient Israel through the preceding centuries when life beyond collective death emerged in new forms and realities. That alone is reason enough to pull together in two volumes what one has been trying to do over the last six decades so that students of more recent and future generations can winnow through such efforts to see what can be built on, and what is more limited in purview, to do what they in their time must do. The writer was brought up in an American form of Christianity that he early on saw was a form of apologia for the suppression of cultures that weren’t northern European in origin. That form so focused on individualistic understandings of Christianity and its Bible that its adherents could find support in it for stealing others’ lands on the excuse of bringing European understandings of the faith to indigenous peoples, sometimes committing genocide to do so, then finding support in it for slavery, segregation, prohibition, suppression of women’s and gays’ rights, and those of anyone different from them who claimed rights for themselves. They made the untenable claim that their understanding of the Bible was inerrant and harmonious, but it was actually based on passages that formed a sort of scrap-book Bible that supported their biases. They in essence wanted the whole nation to practice what they preached but rarely fully practiced themselves.2 By contrast I found in critical readings of Scripture applied to current issues the challenge humans need to live lives of Torah, or lives in Christ, indeed to respond in any adequate way to the biblical command to love the enemy (Jer 29:7; Matt 5:44; et al.) and to come to realize that all humans inhabiting this very small planet in an ever-expanding universe need each other, no matter how varied and different, to make sense of it all. The realization that we live on an ever-shrinking ball of fiery rock in a universe impossible to envisage in its immensity, coupled with the realization that all of us on it are born to die, and that all of life on it must return to the dust whence it came, should bring us all to learn to appreciate all the cultures on it into which and through which God has reached out to touch humanity in various ways around the globe. It should also bring us all to learn to 2 See Sanders, Re-birth, and the review of it by Prof. Walter Brueggemann, “A Scholar’s Faith.”\n\nPrologue for Scripture in Its Historical Contexts II\n\nIX\n\nlove and appreciate all the “others” on the same shrinking planet. The message of the “death of death and hell’s destruction” is the biblical re-assurance that God is the God of death (1 Sam 2:6; Deut 32:39) as well as of life, and that birth and death both remain the divine gifts they have always been. Such thinking brought me to the conviction that the central message of the Bible critically studied is the monotheizing process, that we all are part of the same Reality, and should think, live, and act like it.3 There is indeed but One Reality or God of (us) All. With all our diversity of skin colors, sexual givens, cultures, stories, and religions we are all integral parts of a God-given whole. Hence the efforts assembled in this volume are offered, probing as deeply as the writer has been able to probe, the amazing, continuing relevance of the messages of Scripture we inherit from ancient Near-Eastern and Eastern Mediterranean antiquity. As in Volume I, the essays are reproduced here basically as previously published, though style conventions have been harmonized; however, where it has been felt necessary to add updating, current information has been added inside square brackets.

It is a pleasure to be able to thank Professor Blank, in this manner, for all that he gave me during my three years at the Hebrew Union College and since then in his writings. It was clear on first perusal that the Qumran Hebrew and the LXX-Syriac Ps 151 differed considerably. The most obvious difference lay in the lacunae in the LXX-Syriac, and especially in the total lack of anything corresponding to 11Q vv. 3 and 4. I fixed my attention immediately on these, and though it was apparent that one could read it in different ways (see, e. g., the circelli I affixed above each waw / yod in the Clarendon publication),2 it seemed only logical that one should prefer the plainest, simplest reading that would explain the glaring omissions in the LXX and Syriac versions – the heterodox idea that mountains and hills did not witness to God’s works. This was so clearly non-biblical (and against everything I had been taught) that it commended itself as the explanation for the salient and lengthy lacuna in the clearly orthodox LXX Ps 151 and, of course, the Syriac 151, its faithful daughter. Once thinking along this track, I wondered just how heterodox the “original” psalm was. I was asked by Paul Lapp, director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, and by Roland de Vaux, director of the École Biblique there, to share my findings in the scroll with the scholarly community of (then) Jordanian Jerusalem. At a meeting in the library of the ASOR (now the Albright Institute) in the late winter of 1962 I presented what was published soon thereafter.3 The reaction was positive. Fr. Jean-Paul Audet was among those present, and it was he who suggested the figure of Orpheus as the explanation for the 11Q verses lacking correspondence in the versions.4 I delved straightaway into the question of whether 11QPs 151 did not perhaps provide the missing literary link to the frequent artistic presentations of an Orphic understanding or “resignification” of David. I published Ps 151 making that suggestion.5 Jean Magne has 1\n\nSanders “Ps 151 in 11QPss.” Sanders, Psalms Scroll. 3 Sanders, “Scroll of Psalms” and then Sanders, “Ps 151 in 11QPss.” 4 See Sanders, Dead Sea Psalms Scroll, 99. 5 Sanders, “Ps 151 in 11QPss”; Sanders, Psalms Scroll; Sanders, Dead Sea Psalms Scroll. 2\n\n4\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nsince then provided a sane, clear statement of why one would logically expect such a literary link to appear sometime.6 The first reactions to the suggestion were mixed. The first to come to my attention was that of Isaac Rabinowitz.7 Upon reading his rebuttal in manuscript form, I decided to let the debate take its course, for in the meantime other responses were quite favorable.8 Since then more scholars have tried their hand at reading the text in what each has been confident was the author’s intention. Most of them tried to deal with the question of whether there had been a Hebrew recension Vorlage to the present LXX and Syriac version. But only two, to my knowledge, have suggested that the 11Q text is corrupt and offered reconstructions of the original.9 Magne thinks that the negative particles in 151:3 are later insertions, while Smith thinks all of 151:4 is a later insertion; the latter thinks a full line dropped out of 151:3. Neither of these had appeared when I did a first review of the situation.10 The two scholars who have studied the script of 11QPsa the closest in attempting to determine readings in these two verses of Ps 15111 disagree at every crucial point (see the synopsis below), so that it would appear that paleography provides no obviously clear answers. No one who has written on Ps 151 since the Nida Festschrift12 appeared had apparently read it, for no one has referred to it. Nor have I seen any clear references to the fresh observations I made in 1967.13 But then it is very interesting to note that none of those who prefer to read haqqol as a genitive has offered a satisfactory explanation of the accusative translations of it in LXXS, OL, et al. If Sinaiticus can be ignored . . . ! John Strugnell, noting and respecting Sinaiticus, reads haqqol, with me, as accusative.14 Yigael Yadin understood that, like the Temple Scroll,15 the Psalms Scroll was functionally canonical for the Essenes at Qumran.16 D. Barthélemy,17 E. Puech,18 and G. Wilson,19 among others also agree.20 I will here simply reaffirm my assessment of Ps 151 as stated in 1967 and 1974, and offer in the manner of 1967 a synopsis of the sixteen scholarly attempts 6\n\nMagne, “Orphisme, pythagorisme, essénisme,” 533 ff.

Smaller was I than my brothers and the youngest of the sons of my father, So he made me shepherd of his flock and ruler over his kids. 2. My hands have made an instrument and my fingers a lyre; And (so) have I rendered glory to the Lord, thought I, within my soul. 3. The mountains do not witness to him, nor do the hills proclaim; The trees have cherished my words and the flock my works. 4. For who can proclaim and who can bespeak and who can recount the deeds of the Lord? Everything has God seen, everything has he heard and he has heeded. 5. He sent his prophet to anoint me, Samuel to make me great; My brothers went out to meet him, handsome of figure and appearance. 6. Though they were tall of stature and handsome by their hair, The Lord God chose them not. 7. But he sent and took me from behind the flock and anointed me with holy oil, And he made me leader to his people and ruler over the sons of his covenant. 21\n\nSanders, “Ps 151 in 11QPss,” 75 – 76.\n\n6\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nOther Translations of 11QPs 151:3–4 Skehan22 the mountains cannot witness to Him nor the hills relate: Neither the boughs of trees, my words, nor the flock, my compositions; Who indeed can relate, and who can tell, and who can recount the works of the Lord?

Some of the world’s most respected scholars have worked on the text, and still there is no compelling argument for a single grouping of readings of the above six crux words or phrases. While I do not want to appear dogmatic about my own read-\n\n12\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nings, I at the same time have seen no compelling reasons to abandon them. And I can readily imagine my colleagues all making the same point. In other words, we have a treasure in 11QPs 151 to use as a model for illustrating the literary phenomenon of multivalency at its most basic level. While there is multivalency in good literature beyond the basic textual level with many examples to illustrate it, rarely have we been given, in less than four lines from a scribe’s hand, six ambiguous readings on which seventeen world-class scholars have worked with no consensus emerging twenty full years after publication. Indeed, the latest efforts have been among the most divergent! While multivalency of texts is a universal literary phenomenon, the hermeneutics by which texts are read determines how the reader chooses readings. This is no less the case when the multivalency is a basically textual one than when it is of a supposedly higher literary sort. In the case of 11QPs 151, I must admit that I have at times sensed a hermeneutic of avoidance as much at play in the work of some of my colleagues as I discerned in 1962 in the work of the early translators, or perhaps in the revised Vorlage they worked with. Be that as it may, we can all at least celebrate the fact of a richly multivalent text to illustrate the point that really good texts are to some extent beyond the manipulation even of first-rate scholarship. It might even be seen as a further contribution to the efforts in the 1980s of scholarship to be a bit less singularist and a bit more humble about recovering “authorial intentionality” of these texts we all love so much. This alone should make a true scholar like Sheldon Blank happy indeed.\n\nBibliography Referenced in the Article Auffret, Pierre. “Structure littéraire et interprétation du Psaume 151 de la grotte 11 de Qumrân.” RevQ 9, issue 34 (1977) 163 – 89.

(Critique of Ufenheimer.)\n\n2 The Function of Annunciations in Scripture (2007) Annunciations occur at numerous junctures in the Bible. They are a primary expression of the biblical belief that God would intervene in history at crucial intervals by providing for the eventual birth of a new leader in order to save his people, despite all their sins, from disaster or even extinction. Annunciations had a recognizable form that the reader or hearer would have understood as indication that God as Lord of history intended to provide the next generation a savior or helper in crisis situations to ensure that the people survive with identity to continue their mission on earth. I am pleased to offer the following observations as a gesture of appreciation for the work and friendship of my esteemed colleague, Lee McDonald, with whom I have worked on several projects and from whom I have learned much. My students and I have over the years identified some twenty passages (in the Tanak and Protestant Bible alone) that exhibit the annunciation form or at least reflect it sufficiently to have functioned as good news for the future. The single-verse accounts (in Gen 35:17 and 1 Sam 4:20) barely qualify but need to be recognized for their function in context. An annunciation was notice that God was aware of the need of the people and intended to send a leader for the next generation to save them or to provide the leadership necessary for continuity. Seven of the passages are in the book of Genesis with six in the Early Prophets, one in Chronicles and three in Isaiah, for a total of seventeen in the First Testament. There are three in the Gospels, two offering authenticating credentials for Jesus and one for John the Baptist. Annunciations served in part the same role as genealogies in the Bible, some of which showed ancestral lineage back to those whose conception and birth had been foretold in annunciations. Genealogies, however, focused attention on the inherited credentials of the generations of humans involved, while annunciations focused attention on the future but also back on the promise of progeny by God to Abram and Sarai in Gen 12. Gen 15:1 – 6 Gen 16:7 – 12 Gen 17:1, 3, 15 – 22 Gen 18:1 – 2, 10 – 15 Gen 25:21 – 25 Gen 30: 22 – 24\n\n– to Abraham about progeny generally – to Hagar re Ishmael – to Abraham re Isaac – to Abraham and Sarah re Isaac – to Rebekah re twins – to Rachel re Joseph\n\n20\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nGen 35:17 – to Rachel re Benjamin Judg 13:2 – 23 – to wife of Manoah re Samson 1 Sam 1:9 – 20 – to Hannah re Samuel 1 Sam 4:20 – to wife of Phineas 2 Sam 7:12 – 16 – to David re Solomon 1 Chron 22:7 – 10 – to David re Solomon 1 Kgs 13:1 – 3 – to the altar re Josiah 2 Kgs 4:14 – 17 – to Shunnamite woman re son Isa 7:10 – 17 – to young woman re Emanuel Isa 8:1 – 4 – to Isaiah re Maher-shalal-hash-bas Isa 54:1 – 8 – to Jerusalem in exile re future generations Matt 1:18 – 25 (20 – 21) – to Joseph re Jesus Luke 1:5 – 25 (11 – 20) – to Zechariah re John the Baptist Luke 1:26 – 38 – to Mary re Jesus In each case Israel was in trouble, sometimes even despair. The ongoing story of Israel as God’s people was threatened in some way and hope was waning. In each case it appeared as though a chapter of Israel’s life was closing with no future in sight. In the case of the patriarchal stories in Genesis, the issue was whether the promises of progeny and land to Abram and Sarai in Gen 12:1 – 7 would be fulfilled, and whether the story would even get off the ground. All of them dealt with whether there would be progeny yet to come. Four of them in Genesis deal with the issue of progeny in the first place, and three address the issue of children for Isaac and Jacob, the second and third generations of the called people of God. The annunciations in Judges and 1 Samuel came in the midst of the Philistine threat to Israel’s very existence while those in Samuel / Kings and the one in Chronicles offered assurances that the Davidic dynasty would endure. Those in the Second Testament story came in the crucial period of Roman oppression between the end of the first century BCE, and the outbreak of the Jewish revolt against Rome in the 60s of the first century CE, when Rome tried to obliterate Judaism from Jerusalem entirely. In other words, annunciations meant hope that the story would continue beyond the crisis, and that Israel would not cease to exist. These are parallel to stories of women in the Bible who went to great lengths to assure that there would be progeny, even to the point of grievous sin. The salient such story was that of Tamar (Gen 38) who seduced her father-in-law Judah into having sex with her at a sheep-shearing fair because Judah had failed to enforce the custom of levirate marriage in order that her deceased husband have heirs. Tamar had married Judah’s son, Er, one of three sons Judah had by the Canaanite woman, Shua. One of Er’s brothers was Onan and the other Shelah. When Er died Judah gave Onan to Tamar, but Onan was loath to serve the interests of his deceased brother and refused to consummate the marriage, but then died prematurely. Judah failed then to give Shelah to Tamar, as would have been the custom. He was reluctant to do so because he feared Shelah might also die like his brothers.\n\nThe Function of Annunciations in Scripture\n\n21\n\nWhen Shelah had grown to marriageable age and Judah did not arrange for him to marry Tamar, she went herself to the fair, took off her widow’s garments, redressed as a woman of the street, and seduced her father-in-law. In a marvelous story of personal intrigue, Tamar later forced Judah to recognize that she was bearing his own son. But not until Judah had accused her of harlotry and was about to have her burnt to death did Tamar show him the signet, the cord, and the staff he had given her on the occasion of the tryst at the fair. Thereupon Judah declared Tamar “more righteous than I in that I did not give her my son, Shelah” (Gen 38:26). By law and by custom Tamar deserved death by burning for playing the harlot, but when Judah acknowledged that the personal tokens of pleasure were indeed his, he declared her righteous. Canonically speaking, that is, to later readers / hearers, this would have meant “righteous” because Tamar was a true “mother in Israel” who assured the continuity of the promise of God to Abram and Sarai, despite her flaunting the law. Tamar’s son by her father-in-law, Judah, was named Perez, who is cited as ancestor to Jesus in the genealogies in both Matthew (1:3) and Luke (3:33). The story serves to show that continuity of the people sometimes overrode particulars of the law. The Tamar story occurs in the Bible just after the beginning chapter of the story of Joseph’s brothers, including Judah, plotting to kill Joseph but instead selling him into slavery in Egypt (Gen 37). It has long puzzled scholarship as to why the Tamar story intrudes into the Joseph story. But in a close reading of the text it is clear that the editors of Genesis intentionally chose to place the story of Tamar’s bravery / effrontery in providing an heir for her deceased husband just after the threat to Joseph’s life by his own brothers. The Joseph story is about how God converted the evil of Joseph’s brothers into the reason for their later survival of a drought. Joseph, whom they detested as their youngest brother, had become a powerful leader in Egypt where food was available. The Bible, in such stories as well as in the genealogies, shows more concern about Israel’s survival and continuity than about strict obedience to the law. The governing factor was the two promises of God to Abram and Sarai in Gen 12, progeny and a place to live, as indeed it is in much of the biblical story from Genesis on. Annunciations gave evidence of God’s continuing concern for survival and continuity of the people promised, especially when the circumstances were threatening, while genealogies provided evidence that God had indeed kept the promise generation after generation – a particular concern during the Persian period of the Chronicler and of the priestly editors of the Pentateuch, as well as of the Gospels. In the First Testament, the woman to whom the annunciation referred was generally too old to have children, or was barren, or both – as is succinctly stated in the case of Elizabeth in Luke 1:36. Only in the case of Mary was it different. Mary is described as neither old nor barren, but a young virgin. The shift undoubtedly reflected the later Hellenistic context in which claims of virginal conception were a cultural factor lacking in the earlier Semitic contexts.1 The 1 Cf. the annunciations in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 3.1 – 2; Flavius Philostratus, Life ofApollonius of Tyana 1.4 – 6; Plutarch, Life of Numa 4; Moralia 9.114 – 19; Aeschylus, Suppliants 17 – 19. I am indebted to Craig Evans for these references.\n\n22\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nform of the annunciation in the Bible had distinct traits, with some, as in the cases of Isaac, Samson, Samuel, and Jesus, fuller and offering more details. The annunciation to Mary in Luke is a good example of the full form. Luke 1:26 – 38 may serve as an example of the form, which would have had six parts with the third having six subparts: 1. The appearance of an angel or representative of God’s presence (Luke 1:26 – 28) 2. A reaction of fear by the parent-to-be (common in the presence of divinity, Luke 1:29) 3. The annunciation proper by the angel 3a. “Fear not” (Luke 1:30) 3b. The woman is with or about to be with child (Luke 1:31) 3c. She will give birth (come to term; Luke 1:31) 3d. A name is given the child to come (Luke 1:31, 35b) 3e. An interpretation of the name is offered (Luke 1:32a) 3f. Future accomplishments of the child are noted (Luke 1:32b –33) 4. The putative parent demurs or shows disbelief (Luke 1:34) 5. A sign is given (Luke 1:35 – 37) 6. Acceptance and close (Luke 1:38) The import of most of the annunciations lies not only in their early meanings to early audiences but also in their canonical dimension. By canonical in this sense, as in most of my work, I do not mean the issue of what is contained in a canon or how and when it got there, nor indeed in meanings discerned by reading a text in its larger canonical context, but in the force of the stories when they were reread and reheard in later or different contexts because they apparently had value enough to be heard again and again, and had then later become part of regular cultic recitations in communities that found their identity in the stories recited.2 Though it does not precisely reflect an annunciation form, in Gen 15 Abram’s plaint to Yahweh sounded a note of frustration bordering on loss of belief in the promise of Gen 12 that he and Sarai would have progeny. He confronts God with the fact that if he continues heirless his Syrian servant, Eliezer his major domo, would be his heir. That may well have reflected an “original” Bronze or Iron Age custom concerning the importance of a major domo in an heirless household, but the canonical importance of the story lay in the threat it conveyed to the later worshipper and hearer, that God’s blessings might have been 2 Once a canon was stabilized and accepted, each part of it had to continue to be interpreted as relevant to ongoing generations; but in the early, critical stages of the canonical process the various books or parts had to speak meaningfully to varying situations in order to get onto a kind of tenure track toward a canon. Relevance of a canon then continued to be the expectation of the believing community for which it functioned as canon. While my friend Brevard Childs was mainly interested in the meanings of texts in their “final,” stable, literary, canonical contexts, my interest has been in the fact that a text intended to address the needs of one community when first composed, spoke also to other needs of other communities by later repetition and recitation in quite different situations and times. Canonical texts are hence inherently multivalent. The subdiscipline of comparative midrash was developed to probe this dimension of the canonical process. See Sanders, “From Isaiah 61 to Luke 4.”\n\nThe Function of Annunciations in Scripture\n\n23\n\nassigned to Israel’s longtime enemy, Syria. Where then would Israel be? In the annual lectionary readings, every year God’s total freedom had to be faced in the recitation, before the comfort of the rest of the story could be realized. The same importance can be seen in the story of the annunciation to Hagar and the birth of Ishmael, Abram’s only heir at that point. But it can be even more poignantly seen in the annunciation to the aged Abraham that the aging Sarai (now Sarah) would bear him a son (Gen 17:15 – 16). In complete disbelief, Abraham fell on his face and laughed (17:17) because he was a hundred and she ninety, well past menopause. The story is graphic. Abraham fell prostrate before God, in a posture of great piety, but in that humble position he snickered at the annunciation. “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?” He indeed “demurred” as indicated in the fourth part of the annunciation form noted above. But the most poignant moment for the later reader or hearer came next in v. 18 when Abraham pled: “Oh, that Ishmael might live in your sight!” Abraham needed a little rationality injected into his relation with God. Since he could not believe that the annunciation was realistic because of their advanced age, he asked God to let Ishmael be the heir, or “live in your sight,” not just live, but live in God’s sight and thus be the heir of the blessings and the promises. The later Jewish worshipper in hearing the recital could not but have an existential moment at hearing Abraham’s plea for a little sanity in the situation. No longer are Eliezer or the Syrians the threat but now it is the whole Arab world through the patriarch, Ishmael, that threatens to be the heir – if Father Abraham had had his way! God comforts Abraham’s fatherly concern about his son, Ishmael, saying that Ishmael will indeed be the progenitor of a great nation of people, but not the heir of the promises or the covenant; that will be reserved for Sarah’s son to come. But the editors of Genesis saw fit to include a second, equally poignant account of the same annunciation. So, in the next chapter, Gen 18, we find Abraham and his retinue camped under the shade of a mighty tree in Mamre. Abraham was seated at the entrance of his tent during the heat of the day when he looked up and saw three men standing over in front of him. He hastened to greet them, according to the custom of the time, and bowed to the ground before them to welcome them and ask them to stay awhile and accept his hospitality. After a rather sumptuous meal, the visitors asked Abraham where his wife was. She was just inside the tent, listening intently to the conversation. Thereupon the visitors proclaimed that she would bear Abraham a son. The text goes on to make it explicit that Sarah was too old and beyond the ability to have children so that she laughed at what she heard. Though the text assures us that Sarah laughed “to herself,” the visitors could hear the snickering and asked why Sarah laughed. Sarah went on to ask how such a thing could even be possible at their age. This time it was Sarah who did the laughing. And this time, like Abram in Gen 12:11 – 13, it is Sarah who lied, claiming that she had not laughed. The visitors closed the interview by insisting that she had lied. Whew! Yet again the later reader / hearer of the story has lived through another narrow escape, as it were, and been confronted by the fact that these\n\n24\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nancestors were indeed but frail humans like themselves. Israel’s and Judaism’s very existence was many times threatened so that the later worshipper would, in hearing the stories again, be comforted that such threats did not stump God. They would be forced to the one and only conclusion possible: Isaac, the lad yet to be born, was, despite the parents’ incredulity, a gift of God. The humanity of Abraham and Sarah would well reflect that of the later worshipper. But the point of the stories through it all was the more poignant: the second generation of the called people of God was a gift because the parents were biologically incapable of having a child. One need but think of how the Torah is read through every year in shul, or synagogue. And every year these stories, precisely because they are canonical, have to be heard and heard again year after year in ever-changing circumstances until the point strikes home: every generation of the called people of God, no matter its needs or situation, is a gift of God; in fact, everything a human has or is, is a gift of God. If these stories do nothing else for the hearers they underscore the biblical insistence that one’s very existence is a gift of God, all the more so that of Israel as a people. A sure way to miss the point is to moralize on reading the stories and hence either remain skeptical, or worse, try to defend them on rational grounds – such as claiming that some women don’t have menopause until late in life, or refer to experiments with old rabbits, or some other irrelevant claim – as though the Bible were somehow a textbook in accord with modern understandings of biology. These come from those who fight a totally different battle – the question of the authority of the Bible. But that cannot be achieved by seeking the approval of modern science. The only way to understand them is to “theologize” while hearing them by asking instead what the text indicates God was up to in the story. One of the falsehoods of popular religion is to claim that the Bible is scientifically compatible with modern enlightenment understandings of science, but superior to them. The Bible, on the contrary, is a foreign and strange book that has to be understood critically on its own ancient terms, the on-going relevance of which is theological and not “scientific.” These annunciations insist that the continuity of the called people of God in every crucial phase – indeed every generation – was a gift of God, often despite the inability of the people involved then or later to believe or understand God. God is ultimately the most important single factor / character in the Bible – but incomprehensible, since God is, according to the Bible, of a totally different order of being. The truncated annunciations to Rebecca and to Rachel concerning the following generations (in Gen 25, 30, and 35) are not so dramatic or explicit, but the point about annunciations has been made, especially when the going got rough and prospects for the future seemed dim indeed. In a similar manner there is only one annunciation concerning one of the judges. All of these early, difficult conceptions and births focus on God’s faithfulness to his promises in Gen 12 and his ability to fulfill them despite the human limitations involved. The annunciation to Manoah’s wife, in Judg 13, is the fullest and most complete in the Bible. Israel was under the domination and hegemony of the Philistines and future prospects seemed so bad that the whole venture threatened to\n\nThe Function of Annunciations in Scripture\n\n25\n\ncome to an end. But just as the end seemed to be in sight, an angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah’s wife: “Behold you are barren and have no children but you shall conceive and bear a son” (Judg 13:3). He would be a Nazirite, and would start Israel’s journey back away from possible oblivion: “He shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” The story is the most elaborate of all the annunciations in the Bible. Manoah asked the question that elicits from the heavenly visitor who has spoken to his wife the points in 3d – f in the above form of the annunciation: “What is to be the boy’s manner of life and what will he do?” Manoah wanted to prepare a meal (as Abraham had done for his visitors) but the angel refused and said Manoah should instead prepare a sacrifice for Yahweh (Judg 13:16 – 20). The angel then returned whence he had come by ascending the flame from the altar of sacrifice. Because the angel appeared to them no more, Manoah knew, in his husbandly heart, that it had been an angel and not a man attracted to his wife (Judg 13:8 – 14). She bore a son and “called his name Samson.” Yahweh blessed him with exceptional gifts, as the story goes on to say in the following chapters. It may seem strange that such an elaborate annunciation would be told about such a character as Samson, but the careful reader / hearer knows that the Philistine threat to Israel’s existence was very real and needed a dramatic turn if there was to be a future for the promises. Israel in all periods and eras needed to know that there was no crisis fatal enough to stump God. This point would become extremely important in the later Babylonian exile when the kingdoms of Israel and Judah had been destroyed and there seemed no future at all for the called people of God. Very important in this regard was the annunciation to Hannah concerning Samuel. Her husband, Elkanah, had two wives: one, Peninnah, who bore him many children, and Hannah who was barren. Peninnah did not spare Hannah her joy at her superior place in the household, and because of it, and because of her own barrenness, Hannah was miserable. She wept bitterly and prayed at the sanctuary in Shiloh that Yahweh would open her womb and give her a son. She vowed to dedicate him to Yahweh if he would but bless her with issue. She prayed so fervently that Eli, the priest there, could see her lips move but heard no voice, and hence thought her drunk. What the priest took for inebriation was rather that Hannah was “a woman sorely troubled” who poured out her soul to Yahweh because of vexation and anxiety (1 Sam 1:16). After they had returned home to Ramah, Hannah indeed became pregnant, and after Samuel was born and weaned she took him with sacrifices back to Eli at Shiloh and dedicated him to service in the temple there. When the ceremony was complete, Hannah again prayed to Yahweh, but this time it was a prayer of thanksgiving – one of the great anthems of the Bible (1 Sam 2:1 – 10). The Song of Hannah provided the model for the Magnificat of Mary in the Gospel of Luke.3 The story and Song of Hannah occupy an exceptional place in the Bible. They introduce the Book of Samuel, a crucial part of the story of ancient Israel. Samuel 3 They are both included among the Odes in Codex Alexandrinus and other MSS beginning in the fifth century; see Rahlfs, Psalmi cum Odis, 78 – 80, 341 – 65.\n\n26\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nbecame a pivotal leader in the history of the people. The Philistines were camped at Aphek and were a dire threat to Israel, so the people took the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh to Aphek. This dramatic move on Israel’s part both scared and inspired the Philistines, who proceeded to defeat Israel in battle there. They captured the Ark of the Covenant and took it to Ashdod in Philistine territory. That proved to be a mistake on their part, for wherever they took the Ark, during the seven months it was in Philistine hands, disasters befell them. What Israel’s fighting men could not accomplish, the Ark did on its own. The Philistines wanted rid of the Ark and mounted it on a cart drawn by two milch-cows from whom their calves had been separated and locked away. The cows went straight up to Bethshemesh in Israelite territory, lowing as they went, veering neither right nor left. Their lowing was bovine mourning, the cows desperately wanting to rejoin their calves but nonetheless driven (by God, it is assumed) to take the Ark back to Israel (1 Sam 4 – 6). Samuel was Israel’s judge or principal leader during the continuing Philistine menace, riding circuit out of his home at Ramah. This was the great turning point for Israel from the period of the Judges, of whom Samuel was the last, to the period of the Early Prophets when, because of the Philistine threat, Samuel gave them a king, which they thought would be the answer to their plight. The monarchy brought with it its own problems as the Latter Prophets make abundantly clear, but not until David and Solomon had brought fame and glory to the people of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. What Hannah foresaw in her eucharistic prayer in 1 Sam 2 of the risings and fallings to come would indeed take place under the aegis of God “who kills and brings to life, makes poor and makes rich, defeats and exalts, for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s and on them he has set the world” (1 Sam 2:8). The Song of Hannah is thus a witness to the monotheizing process that had started earlier and would continue through the rest of the Bible.4 Nathan’s communication of his revelation from Yahweh to David in 2 Sam 7:4 – 17 is important in a number of ways in the story to this point. Nathan assures David that God does not want or need a house built for him, his son Solomon will do that. God nonetheless reaffirms the promises of a place to live and progeny that were made in Gen 12. As a part of the divine reaffirmation, in 2 Sam 7:12 – 16 Nathan includes an annunciation of sorts concerning the coming birth of Solomon, who will indeed build a temple for Yahweh. Little of the form of the annunciation is used but there is enough to include the passage here. It is an example of an echo of the form in order to establish the Davidic dynasty; which was clearly an interest of the Yahwist and Deuteronomic historians. The next important annunciation takes place in Isa 7:10 – 17 where Isaiah, in another truncated form of an annunciation, proclaimed to a distraught King Ahaz that his worries (around 734 BCE) concerning the threats from the alliance of northern Israel and Syria against the southern kingdom of Judah would 4 See the arguments advanced in Sanders, Torah and Canon [and in The Monotheizing Process].\n\nThe Function of Annunciations in Scripture\n\n27\n\ncome to naught. He assured the king of relief by the time a woman who had come to where they were with other water-drawers to the upper pool off the road to the Fuller’s Field to fetch water – a common, even daily, occurrence – would conceive and bear a son (in nine months or so) and name him Emanuel, meaning “God with us.” That is, the threat would dissipate to the point that the relief would cause the mother of a child to name him “God-with-us” in order to celebrate the relief from the Syro-Ephraimitic menace, which itself would soon thereafter be confiscated by the king of Assyria. It is this annunciation (in a Greek translation of it) that caught the attention of some early Christians who resignified it as foretelling the birth of Christ (Matt 1:23). In the next chapter (Isa 8:1 – 4) Isaiah reports that God told him to write his future son’s name on a tablet “in common characters,” as in writing a deed, for which he got “reliable witnesses.” Thereupon the prophet went in to the prophetess (his wife) who then conceived and bore a son whom the parents called by the name that had been written on the tablet by divine dictation. The message was a follow-up to the case of the young woman in the previous chapter: the wealth of the Syro-Ephraimitic alliance would be looted by the king of Assyria. The northern kingdom of Israel (Ephraim) would fall to Assyria in 722 BCE, only some twelve years after the threat of the alliance had failed. The apostrophe to Jerusalem in Isa 54:1 – 9 is a poetically developed expression of hope that contains major elements of the annunciation. Mary Callaway has brilliantly shown how this passage in the Second Isaiah echoes the Genesis accounts but resignifies Sarah and Rachel into Jerusalem or Zion. “Sing, O barren one, who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of her that is married, says the Lord” (Isa 54:1).5 This is a poignant example of how a familiar form could be adapted to speak to a new situation with the authority and power needed to console those who were in despair (cf. Isa 51:1 – 3; 66:10 – 12, and the “Apostrophe to Zion” in 11QPsa col. 22). In the Gospel of Matthew, Mary’s pregnancy disturbed her betrothed Joseph, who became suspicious as to whose child it was (like Manoah in Judg 13) until an angel appeared to him in a dream (Matt 1:20). The angel assured Joseph that the pregnancy was by the Holy Spirit and that Mary was due to give birth to a son whose name would be Jesus for he would save the people from their sins. Matthew claimed that this should be understood in the light of the annunciation in Isa 7. Joseph’s suspicions were allayed but not those of non-Christians who made much of the illegitimacy of Jesus.6 It has not disturbed all Christians, however, who have been able to see, if need be, in such a questionable view of Jesus’ birth, a testimony to God in the incarnation being identified with an outcast, marginalized Jew of the first century – the view that God so loved the world that he stooped to pick up the lowliest of the low and, lifting him on high, proclaimed 5 Callaway, Sing, O Barren One. Callaway shows how this resignification of the barren matriarch into Jerusalem continues in Isa 66:10 – 12; cf. Bar 4:11 – 20; 4 Ezra 9 – 10, and Gal 4:21 – 31. 6 See Schaberg, Illegitimacy of Jesus.\n\n28\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nhim his own beloved son! Given the biblical stories of continuity assured by women who flaunted the law (some, like Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba appearing in the genealogical lists in Matthew and Luke) such would clearly be a biblical view. Be that as it may, Matthew viewed the story of Isaiah’s consolation of King Ahaz as sufficient prophetic indication of what God was doing through Mary and in Jesus, whether with the Hebrew word in Isa 7:14 being “young woman,” or with the Greek translation in one manuscript being “virgin.” The annunciations in Luke 1 were delivered by the angel Gabriel to Zechariah in the case of John the Baptist (1:5 – 25), and to Mary in the case of Jesus (1:26 – 38). Both follow the form of the biblical annunciation faithfully, indicating to the reader and hearer that these were indeed legitimate proclamations of the intention of God to intervene once again in the history and lives of his people during one of the most threatening periods of their whole history, Roman occupation and oppression. Rome was generous enough to those who submitted to its yoke and domination but cruel and merciless to those who did not, and the Jews basically did not. The story of Jesus’ life and ministry is set in the time frame between the revolts against Rome that took place in the large Jewish community in Egypt, then in Palestine upon the death of Herod in 4 BCE, the all-out rebellion marked by what Josephus the historian called The Jewish War, of 66 to 73 CE, and finally the disastrous “messianic” revolt by Bar Kokhba in the early second century CE. It was a period of troubles and threats as dire as Israel had experienced in all her history, equal to or exceeding the earlier Philistine threats or those at the hands of the Assyrians, Babylonians, or Seleucids. The annunciation to Mary by Gabriel is deeply scriptural. Jews tended to write what new they had to say in the terms and cadences of Scripture in order to give authority to it. Luke, probably a Gentile convert to the Christian Jewish sect, though maybe a hellenized Jew, followed the form of the annunciation with faithful intention. Though it is clear that Luke knew no Hebrew, it is equally clear that he was intimately familiar with Greek translations of Scripture in his time. In addition, he put into the mouth of Mary a song that echoes the Song of Hannah noted above – the Magnificat. If one reads Hannah’s song (1 Sam 2:1 – 10) and then reads Mary’s (Luke 1:46 – 55), one knows that Luke wanted to convey the message that Mary’s was scripturally authentic. Jesus might well have been understood as one who would occupy in the history of the Jewish people in his time the place that Samuel had had in ancient Israel. Whereas Samuel had ushered in the Kingdom of Israel over against the Philistines under David, Jesus would proclaim the Kingdom of God over against the Roman Empire. The message would have been very clear to those with scriptural ears to hear. The experience of the shepherds in the field near Bethlehem was that of hearing a “proclamation of royal birth” (not an annunciation) by a heavenly host proclaiming and singing the doxology, “Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among those with whom God is pleased” (Luke 2:14). The model for the angelic proclamation of Jesus’ birth in Luke 2 would have been that in Isa 9:6: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given” (cf. Isa 11:1 – 9). It was probably composed to celebrate the birth of Manasseh to King Hezekiah after Isaiah had\n\nThe Function of Annunciations in Scripture\n\n29\n\ninformed the king that even though Jerusalem had survived the Assyrian siege of 701 BCE it would later succumb to Babylonian invasion. Manasseh’s birth after the narrow escape of 701 was sufficient reason to celebrate “peace in our time” for the Kingdom of Judah (cf. 2 Kgs 20:21). Luke thus wove aspects of the form of the annunciation (Luke 2:10 – 12) into the angelic birth proclamation to the shepherds in the field that “to you is born this day a savior who is Christ the Lord.” But perhaps the most striking echo of the “proclamation of royal birth” is in Luke 24. On the first day of the week, following Jesus’ crucifixion and burial, women of his group went to the place he was buried to administer spices to the body, which would have begun by then to decompose. Upon entering the tomb they did not see the body. Despondent as to how the body might have been taken away or even stolen, they saw two men in dazzling apparel. The women were frightened, but the angels comforted them with the news that God had raised Jesus up from death to life, as Jesus himself had earlier told them. “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here but has risen” (Luke 24:5). The women immediately understood, and believing the information of the angels went to tell the men, who were skeptical. This form of the “proclamation” is not complete in Luke 24 but familiar enough to make the point I’m sure Luke wanted to make, that God had converted Jesus’ tomb into a womb of life beyond death. And thus the deeply biblical claim that God can convert evil into good provides the climax for Luke of the gospel story. The annunciation had a clear message conveyed by the literary form in which it was cast, or which it echoed. All that was necessary was to fill in the blanks, as it were, with the names and circumstances of each case. It would not have been necessary for every annunciation to be recited in full form; often in the Bible, as in all good rhetoric, a feather-touch allusion to the essence of a tradition is quite enough to ring in the changes on what it meant and could mean again without belaboring the obvious to those who knew Scripture and tradition. Luke’s congregation would have known a Greek translation of Scripture because I am quite sure Luke, the theological historian and teacher of his flock, would have fervently taught them all he knew of Scripture. As his two volumes, the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, show clearly, Luke knew Scripture amazingly well, in Greek of course, but well indeed; and he would have taught his flock everything he knew of it. That is not the problem that some students of Luke have imagined. In fact, the New, or Second Christian Testament, is written as scripturally as any Jewish Hellenistic literature of the time, especially Luke–Acts. And if Jaroslav Pelikan and others are right that all forms of Christianity in the first four centuries, despite their many differences otherwise, believed in (1) monotheism and (2) the church’s being the true successor of early Israel rather than rabbinic Judaism, the promise of continuity would have been as interesting to Christians as to Jews at the time.7 7 Pelikan and Hotchkiss, Creeds and Confessions. If Marcion’s proposal to eliminate the First Testament had succeeded, the churches, all of them, would have lost both points – the reason, I am sure, it failed.\n\n30\n\nPart 3: Exegesis\n\nWhile each annunciation has a common form, each has its own special contours and shape. Luke’s account of the annunciation by Gabriel to Mary illustrates the point. When Mary demurred, and asked how what the angel had said could be true since she was without a husband, Gabriel explained the role of the Holy Spirit in the matter and then chided her a bit, as if to say (Luke 1:36), “Young lady, if you knew Scripture well you would know that your cousin Elizabeth fits quite well the role of the mothers in the earlier annunciations, since like most of them Elizabeth is both old and barren.” Luke would have had the annunciation to Abraham and Sarah in Gen 18:14 in mind when he had Gabriel speak to Mary by answering the heavenly visitors’ question in the earlier incident (in Greek translation) in the very terms of their question to Sarah, “Is anything impossible with God?” In Hebrew they asked, “Is anything too difficult for Yahweh?” Luke probably did not know the Hebrew question, but he knew its Greek translation well enough to have Gabriel answer it in its own terms: it is as though Gabriel shouted back across the centuries his answer to the question his heavenly colleagues had earlier asked of Sarah, “No, colleagues, with God nothing is impossible.” The promises in Genesis kept Israel alive. Recital of the old traditions kept identity and hope alive, especially when they were most threatened – the Egyptian, the Philistine, the Syrian, the Assyrian, the Babylonian, the Persian, the Seleucid, and the Roman threats to Israel’s very survival. In fact, the times in Israel’s history when the canonical process was most decisive were those when outside forces threatened but did not kill the promise or the people – those times when memory and recital of the traditions breathed new life into a remnant, no matter how small, that refused to forget who they were and why they survived. As Joseph told his brothers (in Gen 50:20), God transformed their evil into good “to bring it about that many may be kept alive as they are today.” The promises in Genesis were a generating force for life behind much of the Bible in whatever canonical form it later took.8 Bibliography Callaway, Mary.
