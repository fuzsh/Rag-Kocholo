        "text": "[1]\n\n“The Pagan Religious Background,” in Ian Hazlett, ed., Early Christianity : Origins and Evolution to A.D. 600, Nashville, 1991, p. 59. Cf. Luther H. Martin, Hellenistic Religions : An Introduction, New York, 1987, p. 43 : “More than any other such form [of divination], it captured the Hellenistic imagination.”\n\n[2]\n\nOn this see David Amand, Fatalisme et liberté dans l’Antiquité grecque, Louvain, 1945.\n\n[3]\n\nThis is the argument of my dissertation Attitudes to Astrology in Early Christianity : A Study Based on Selected Sources, Centre for the Study of Religion, University of Toronto, 2000.\n\n[4]\n\n[G.] Delling, s.v., “Magos,” TDNT vol. 4, p. 356-359 ; A.D. Nock, “Paul and the Magus,” in Essays on Religion and the Ancient World, vol. 1, Oxford, 1972, p. 308-324.\n\n[5]\n\nOn the Greek view of the Magi see Roger Beck, “Thus Spake Not Zarathustra : Zoroastrian Pseudepigrapha of the Greco-Roman World,” in Mary Boyce and Frantz Grenet, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 3, Leiden, 1991, p. 511-521.\n\n[6]\n\nRaymond E. Brown, The Birth of the Messiah, new updated edition, New York, 1993, p. 167-168, arguing against scholars who see an implicit apologetic against false magi and astrology in the text ; Engelbert Kirschbaum, “Der Prophet Balaam und die Anbetung der Weisen,” Römische Quartalschrift für christliche Altertumskunde und Kirchengeschichte, 49 (1954), p. 135 : “[…] ohne sich in irgendeiner Weise über die Herkunft ihres Wissens zu äussern.”\n\n[7]\n\nBrown, Messiah, p. 168-170. Persia reflects the historical origin of the Magi (as in Herodotus), while Babylon (Chaldea) reflects the background of astrology ; Brown adds that gold, frankincense and myrrh would also have been associated with Arab traders.\n\n[8]\n\nThe plural is more commonly used when referring to the east (LSJ s.v. ἀνατολή, p. 123), though this is disputed by Franz Boll, “Der Stern der Weisen,” Zeitschrift für die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, 18 (1917), p. 44-45. The New RSV has “at its rising”. According to Krister Stendahl, since Num 24.17 is the only place in the LXX where the Hebrew verb דרך (“tread, march forth”) is rendered by ἀνατέλλειν this text presumably lies behind the phrase ἐν τῇ ἀνατολῇ in Matt 2 (The School of St. Matthew, 2nd ed, Lund, 1968, p. 136). The Lukan infancy narrative also mentions ἀνατολή (Lk 1.78), where it may carry an astrological sense (the rising of a heavenly body), a temporal sense (“dawn”), or may be a directly christological term (deriving from the translation of the Davidic “branch” of Zech 3.8, 6.12 as ἀνατολή in LXX) (see Brown, Messiah, p. 373-374 ; Reginald Fuller, He That Cometh, Harrisburg, PA, 1990, p. 92-93). Cf. also the references to Jesus as the “morning star” in Rev 2.28 and 22.16 (ὁ ἀστὴρ ὁ πρωϊνός) and in 2 Peter 1.19 (ἕως … ϕωσϕόρος ἀνατείλῃ). On ἀνατολή as a Christian messianic title see [Heinrich] Schlier, s.v. “ἀνατολή,” TDNT vol. 1, p. 352-353, and Eusebius, Demonstratio Evangelica 4.17 and Eclogae Propheticae 3.23.\n\n[9]\n\nBoll, “Stern,” p. 45-46.\n\n[10]\n\nGeminus, Introduction to the Phaenomena 13.3 (and see p. 68, n. 1, of Aujac’s edition).\n\n[11]\n\nThe Star of Bethlehem : The Legacy of the Magi, New Brunswick, NJ, 1999, p. 64-101.\n\n[12]\n\nBoll, “Stern,” p. 44-45. For Plato, see Timaeus 41D-E.\n\n[13]\n\nSee David H. Clarket al., “An Astronomical Re-Appraisal of the Star of Bethlehem — A Nova in 5 BC,” Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 18 (1977), p. 443-449, citing Chinese astronomical records.\n\n[14]\n\nThe identification of the star as a comet was already made by Origen (Contra Celsum 1.58). See more recently William E. Phipps, “The Magi and Halley’s Comet,” Theology Today, 43 (1986-1987), p. 88-92.\n\n[15]\n\nSee the discussion of these three possible identifications in Brown, Messiah, p. 171-173, 610-612. (On p. 610, n. 110, Brown mentions a recent fourth proposal — a U.F.O. !) Brown (ibid., p. 166-167, 172-173, 607-608, 611-612) suggests that the most reasonable of these proposals is a planetary conjunction : the best candidate is a triple conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn which occurred in 7-6 B.C.E., about the same time as Jesus’ birth which took place some two years (cf. Matt 2.16) before the death of Herod the Great in 5‑4 B.C.E. (on the latter date see T.D. Barnes, “The Date of Herod’s Death,” Journal of Theological Studies, n.s. 19 [1968], p. 204-209). The triple conjunction hypothesis has been maintained, with some variations, by Roger W. Sinnot (“Computing the Star of Bethlehem,” Sky and Telescope, 72 [1986], p. 632‑635) and Colin J. Humphreys (“The Star of Bethlehem — A Comet in B.C. — and the Date of the Birth of Christ,” Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 32 [1991], p. 389-407). However, the triple conjunction took place in Pisces, a sign which only came to be associated with Judea in the Middle Ages ; Molnar (Star, p. 27-28, 42-48) rightly points out that Greco-Roman astrologers such as Ptolemy and Vettius Valens held Aries to be the sign of Syria and Judea. Thus Molnar’s point undermines the triple conjunction hypothesis. Molnar also argues persuasively that Matthew does not refer to a celestial phenomenon that was astronomically impressive (such as later astronomers have looked for), but rather to a sign whose significance was primarily astrological.\n\n[16]\n\nBrown, Messiah, p. 173.\n\n[17]\n\nBoll, “Stern,” p. 40-43, emphasizes that ἀστήρ almost always refers to a single star.\n\n[18]\n\nThis is further complicated if we accept the reading of the “western” manuscript tradition which inserts ἐστάθη ἐπάνω after ἐλθὼν. According to Eusebius, to believe that the star came down and stood over the roof of Mary and Joseph’s house is madness (cave existimes eam de caelo in terram descendisse, et supra domus tectum stetisse : nam qui ita credit, insanit) ; his solution is that the star still moved on high though not very far from the earth (ea alte quidem sed tamen a terra haud valde distans decurrebat) (SupplementaQuaestionum ad Stephanum ; trans. of the Syriac in PG 22.982B). However, Eusebius has not always been heeded. Thus Humphreys (“Star,” p. 392-393) claims that Matt 2.9 can only be explained as a comet : he bases this not on astronomy but on ancient portrayals of comets as standing still or lying low over the earth.\n\n[19]\n\nBrown, Messiah, p. 174.\n\n[20]\n\nBoll, “Stern,” p. 46. Brown, Messiah, p. 176, merely notes that “the precision of leading them to a house is unusual”.\n\n[21]\n\nMessiah, p. 612 ; the discussion that follows (p. 612-613) of how Biblical scholars and astronomers talk past each other on this issue is insightful. Similarly, Boll questions the significance of identifying the star astronomically for understanding the Matthean account (“Stern”, p. 47-48).\n\n[22]\n\nNote the term “anointed” one (i.e. “messiah”) applied to Cyrus in Is 45.1, and in the same context the reference to the wealth of nations being brought to Israel (Is 45.14 ; cf. Is 60.6) ; on this as background to Matt 2.1-12 see R.D. Aus, “The Magi at the Birth of Cyrus, and the Magi at Jesus’ Birth in Matt 2.1-12,” in Jacob Neusner, ed. et al., New Perspectives on Ancient Judaism, vol. 2, Lanham, MD, 1987, p. 99-114.\n\n[23]\n\nNote particularly the description of Tiridates’ homage to Nero (according to Dio, Tiridates said “I have come to thee, my god, to worship thee as I do Mithras”) and that the king returned home by a different route than that by which he had come. Pliny, Natural History 30.6.16-17, writes that Tiridates was accompanied on this journey by Magi.\n\n[24]\n\nBrown, Messiah, p. 110-119.\n\n[25]\n\nJean Daniélou, “L’Étoile de Jacob et la mission chrétienne à Damas,” Vigiliae Christianae, 11 (1957), p. 121-138 ; Id., “The Star of Jacob,” in Primitive Christian Symbols, trans. Donald Attwater, London, 1964, p. 102-123 ; Brown, Messiah, p. 190-196.\n\n[26]\n\nTargum Neofiti 1 : Numbers, ed. and trans. Martin McNamara, and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan : Numbers, ed. and trans. Ernest G. Clarke, Collegeville, MN, 1995, p. 140, 261. The “sceptre” was also understood messianically in the Syriac versions (ibid., p. 140, n. 23). On the use of Num 24.17 at Qumran see Brown, Messiah, p. 195, n. 47 (preferable to Daniélou, “Star of Jacob”). The same exegetical tradition is also evident in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Testament of Levi 18.3 and Testament of Judah 24.1 ; these passages may reflect the contexts in which early Christianity read these texts (see H. Dixon Slingerland, The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Missoula, MT, 1977, p. 106-115).\n\n[27]\n\nThe Zealots, Edinburgh, 1989, p. 237-240.\n\n[28]\n\nSee Brown, Messiah, p. 193, n. 43, for various suggestions regarding the origin of Balaam and correspondences with possible identifications of the homeland of the Magi.\n\n[29]\n\nPhilo explicitly refers to Balaam as a μάγος in Life of Moses 1.50. (On Philo’s portrayal of Balaam in Life of Moses, see Harold Remus, “Moses and the Thaumaturges : Philo’s De Vita Mosis as a Rescue Operation,” Laval théologique et philosophique, 52, 3 [1996], p. 671-674.) The view of Balaam as μάγος presumably lies behind the description of Balaam in Eusebius, Quaestiones (PG 22.979C-982A).\n\n[30]\n\nBrown, Messiah, p. 193-194, who also notes the parallel between Balaam’s being accompanied by two servants (Num 22.22) and the later Christian enumeration of the Magi as three.\n\n[31]\n\nIbid., p. 178-179, 182-183, 196. Moreover, this positive behaviour of the Magi is implicitly contrasted with that of the Jews and of Herod.\n\n[32]\n\nSupplementa Quaestionum ad Stephanum (extant in Syriac) (PG 22.979C-D).\n\n[33]\n\nHomilien zum Hexateuch in Rufins Übersetzung, ed.

Geburtstag, Münster, 1984, p. 101-102.\n\n[35]\n\nQuoted in Photius, Bibliotheca cod. 223 (p. 47.26-32 Henry) : the Magi were ὁμοτέχνοι of Balaam. In Eusebius’ Quaestiones, Balaam is termed a magus (PG 22.979C-982A). Gregory of Nyssa calls Balaam an οἰωνιστής (augur) in a Christmas sermon (p. 245.12 Mann [GNO]). The early fifth century Consultationes Zacchaei Christiani et Apollonii Philosophi 2.4.12-13 refers to Balaam as “auctor suae artis” [i.e. of the Magi] (vol. 2, p. 30.70 Feiertag [SC 402]). In De Fide Catholica 1.12, Isidore of Seville refers to Balaam as the first astrologer (PL 83, 471B).\n\n[36]\n\nJoseph Bidez and Franz Cumont, Les mages hellénisés : Zoroastre, Ostanès et Hystaspe d’après la tradition grecque, vol. 1, Paris, 1938, p. 48-49 ; David Winston, “The Iranian Component in the Bible, Apocrypha, and Qumran,” History of Religions, 5 (1966), p. 213-214 ; Boyce and Grenet, A History of Zoroastrianism, p. 438 ; Beck, “Thus Spake Not Zarathustra,” 521ff. A parallel tradition also developed in which Zoroaster was credited with prophesying the star of Bethlehem and the coming of Christ : see Richard J.H. Gottheil, “References to Zoroaster in Syriac and Arabic Literature,” Classical Studies in Honour of Henry Drisler, New York, 1894, p. 24-32 ; Bidez and Cumont, Les mages hellénisés, vol. 2, p. 117ff.\n\n[37]\n\nVol. 1, p. 238-240 Borret (SC 132). Cf. the identification of Moses as a “Chaldean” in Philo, Life of Moses 1.5. See also the lines of Orphica quoted by Clement of Alexandria (OTP, vol. 2, p. 796) where the reference is to Abraham or Moses, as well as the fragment of Artapanus’ On the Jews preserved by Eusebius, where Moses is identified with Mousaeus the teacher of Orpheus as well as with Hermes who gave the “interpretation of sacred letters” to the priests of Egypt (OTP, vol. 2, p. 898). Cf. Garth Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes, Princeton, 1993, p. 36-37 ; W. and H.G. Gundel, Astrologumena, Wiesbaden, 1966, p. 23, n. 32.\n\n[38]\n\nP. 245.14-16 Mann (GNO). Gregory uses the technical term for the star’s heliacal rising, ἐπιτολή.\n\n[39]\n\n“As it is written in the scripture, distant peoples saw the star that the near People might be put to shame. O the learned and proud People who by the peoples have been retaught how and where they saw that rising of which Balaam spoke ! A stranger declared it ; strangers were those who saw it. Blessed is He Who made His kinspeople jealous !” (P. 197, trans. McVey.)\n\n[40]\n\n“O beati magi, qui ante conspectum crudelissimi regis, antequam Christum cognoscerent, Christi facti sunt confessores !” (PG 56.637.) Cf. Leo the Great, Sermo 34.2, where the discovery of the Saviour by the Magi is deemed “a gift of divine honour” (CCL 138, p. 179).\n\n[41]\n\nP. 74-76 Camelot (SC 10). The above translation is from William R. Schoedel, Ignatius of Antioch, Philadelphia, 1985, p. 87.\n\n[42]\n\nSchoedel, Ignatius, p. 93. In “Ignatius and the Reception of the Gospel of Matthew in Antioch,” in David L. Balch, ed., Social History of the Matthean Community : Cross-Disciplinary Approaches, Minneapolis, 1991, p. 156, Schoedel examines the relationship of Ephesians 19.2-3 to Matthew, concluding that both Ignatius and Matthew were independently responding to an earlier tradition regarding the appearance of a star at Jesus’ birth. John P. Meier’s response to Schoedel’s essay is critical on this point (ibid., p. 184-185), but there is no evidence for Meier’s view that Ephesians 19.2-3 is an Ignatian “homiletic midrash” on the Matthean passage. Moreover, Meier’s claim that “By making the Gentiles in chapter 2 astrologers who bear the title μάγοι, Matthew may indeed be hinting at the overcoming of pagan magical belief by the light of Christian faith” ignores the absence of anti-astrological polemic in the Matthean text. A nuanced discussion of the evidence for Ignatian usage of Matthew is found in Wolf-Dietrich Köhler, Die Rezeption des Matthäusevangeliums in der Zeit vor Irenäus, Tübingen, 1987, p. 73-96 ; Köhler sees in Ephesians 19.2-3 a quite possible, though not probable, reference to the Matthew text.\n\n[43]\n\nThis is denied by Schoedel, Ignatius, p. 92.\n\n[44]\n\nIbid., p. 88, 91-92.\n\n[45]\n\nJean Daniélou, The Theology of Jewish Christianity, trans. John A. Baker, London, 1964, p. 223. Cf. the version found in a “certain book of Scripture written in the name of Seth” (quaedam scriptura, inscripta nomine Seth) referred to in the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum according to which for generations the Magi had ascended a mountain (which is called in their language Mons Victorialis) to await the star : when at last the star appeared it contained the form of a tiny boy and was accompanied by the likeness of a cross above it (habens in se formam quasi pueri parvuli, et super se similitudinem crucis) (PG 56.637-638 ; Boyce and Grenet, A History of Zoroastrianism, p. 448).\n\n[46]\n\nSchoedel, Ignatius, p. 93. Cf. Daniélou, Theology, p. 221, who notes that Ignatius’ use of the term μαγεία may also imply a polemic against Magi ; however, it does not necessarily follow that this passage provides evidence for polemic against Magi among Jewish Christians in Syria (contra ibid., p. 222, cf. Daniélou, “Star of Jacob,” p. 121-123).\n\n[47]\n\nRichard Broxton Onians, The Origins of European Thought, Cambridge, 1951, p. 321-338, 349-351, 378-382, 425, 431-433. The image of “bonds” is used to refer to the power of astrological fate in particular in a papyrus (Berolinensis 8502) of the Gnostic Apocryphon of John (72.2-12) ; see Walter C. Till, ed., Die gnostischen Schriften des koptischen Papyrus Berolinensis 8502, Berlin, 1955, p. 184.\n\n[48]\n\nAccording to Schoedel, Ignatius, p. 93, n. 39, ἠϕανίζετο here is a “stylistic variant” of ἐλύετο. The verb λύειν is regularly used for breaking the bonds of evil powers : see Mk 7.35 ; Lk 13.16 ; Ignatius, Eph 13.1 ; Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel 4.33 ; and Iamblichus, De Mysteriis 3.27, where an example of the power of magic is δεσμεῖν τε ἱερούς τινας δεσμοὺς καὶ λύειν τούτους (p. 138.17-18 des Places).\n\n[49]\n\nSchoedel, Ignatius, p. 89. A clear parallel is Paul’s reference in 1 Cor 2.6-8 to the demonic powers that unwittingly accomplished their own defeat by crucifying the Lord of glory. With regard to the hiddenness of Christ’s birth, the Ascension of Isaiah 11 describes Christ’s incarnation as “hidden from all the heavens and all the princes and every god of this world […] in Nazareth he sucked the breast like an infant, as was customary, that he might not be recognized” (11.16-17), with the result that at Christ’s ascension the angels and Satan recognize him and worship him but are forced to ask “How did our Lord descend upon us, and we did not notice the glory which was upon him ?” (11.24) (trans. Knibb, OTP, vol. 2, p. 175 ; cf. Jonathan Knight, The Ascension of Isaiah, Sheffield, 1995, p. 75-76). Ignatius’ view that Christ’s birth from Mary was hidden from the cosmic powers was taken up by later writers such as Origen, Eusebius and Jerome (see G. Bardy, “La littérature patristique des ‘Quaestiones et Responsiones’ sur l’Écriture Sainte,” Revue Biblique, 41 [1932], p. 233-234).\n\n[50]\n\nÉmile de Strycker, La Forme la plus ancienne du Protévangile de Jacques, Bruxelles, 1961, p. 168-170. This passage is not found in Papyrus Bodmer V. On the date of the Protevangelium of James see ibid., p. 412-418, and Michael Testuz, Papyrus Bodmer V : Nativité de Marie, Cologny, Genève, 1958, p. 23-26. Cf. the description of the Bethlehem star as a “great light” (ϕῶς μέγα) in Protevangelium of James 19.2 (p. 154-156 Strycker).\n\n[51]\n\n“[…] cessisse anguem, fugisse leonem,/ contraxisse pedes lateris manco ordine cancrum,/ cornibus infractis domitum mugire iuvencum,/ sidus et hirquinum laceris marcescere uillis./ Labitur hinc pulsus puer hydrius, inde sagittae ; palantes geminos fuga separat, inproba virgo/ prodit amatores tacitos in fornice mundi,/ quique alii horrificis pendent in nubibus ignes/ luciferum timuere novum” (CCL 126, p. 98-99).\n\n[52]\n\n“Haec stella, quae solis rotam/ vincit decore ac lumine […]/ sed sola caelum possidens/ cursum dierum temperat. […]/Quod ut refulsit, ceteri/ cessere signorum globi/ nec pulcher est ausus suam/ conferre formam Lucifer” (CCL 126, p. 65-66).\n\n[53]\n\nHans Lietzmann, A History of the Early Church, vol. 1, The Beginnings of the Christian Church, trans.

Stanley Jones, An Ancient Jewish Christian Source on the History of Christianity : Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions 1.27-71, Atlanta, 1995, p. 76).\n\n[55]\n\nἀνέτειλεν ξένος ἀστὴρ καὶ καινὸς καταλύων τὴν παλαιὰν ἀστροθεσίαν, καινῷ ϕωτί, οὐ κοσμικῷ λαμπόμενος, ὁ καινὰς ὀδοὺς καὶ σωτηρίους τρεπόμενος, αὐτὸς ὁ κύριος ἀνθρώπων ὁδηγὸς ὁ κατελθὼν εἰς γῆν, ἵνα μεταθῇ τοὺς εἰς τὸν Χριστὸν πιστεύσαντας ἀπὸ τῆς Εἱμαρμένης εἰς τὴν ἐκείνου πρόνοιαν (p. 86.650-654 Casey).\n\n[56]\n\nοὐράνιος δ᾽ ἐγέλασσε θρόνος καὶ ἀγάλλετο κόσμος./ καινοϕαὴς δὲ μάγοισι σεβάσθη θέσϕατος ἀστήρ (p. 172 Geffcken [GCS]).

Leclerq, “Astres,” DACL 1.2, 3017 and figure 1047. Leclerq argues that the pre-eminent star was replaced by other christological symbols in early Christian art : among examples he cites are pieces of art on which the chi-rho by itself, a lamb, and a cross are each portrayed dominating fields of stars.\n\n[59]\n\nDeichmann, “Zur Erscheining,” p. 104.\n\n[60]\n\nοὐ γὰρ τῶν τις ἔην ὅσσον ϕραστῆρες ἔασιν/ ἀστρολόγοι, ξεῖνος δὲ καὶ οὐ πάρος ἐξεϕαάνθη (p. 24-25 trans.

In v.61 Gregory refers to it as “a star newly shining” (ἀρτιϕαῆ) (ibid., p. 26-27).\n\n[61]\n\nτὴν τοῦ καινοῦ ἀστέρος ἐπιτολήν (p. 245.16 Mann [GNO]).\n\n[62]\n\nἄστρον μέγα καὶ ἐξηλλαγμένον, ὥστε καὶ τῷ μεγέθει καὶ τῷ κάλλει τῆς ὄψεως αὐτοὺς ἐκπλῆξαι, καὶ τῷ τρόπῳ τῆς πορείας (PG 57.65). The “manner of its course” refers to the curious movement of the star in Matt 2.9. John’s text of Matt 2.9 seems to have belonged to the “western” manuscript tradition, according to which the star guided the Magi to Bethlehem and then stood over the house of Mary and Joseph : in Homilia 7.4 he says that this “is itself also an indication of a greater power than was in keeping with an [ordinary] star, now to hide itself, now to appear, and when it appears to stand still” (ὅπερ καὶ αὐτὸ μείζονος δυνάμεως ἦ κατὰ ἀστέρα ἦν, τὸ νῦν μὲν κρύπτεσθαι, νῦν δὲ ϕαίνεσθαι, καὶ ϕανέντα ἴστασθαι [PG 57.77]). Cf. the more didactic interpretation of Origen, Homilia in Numeros 18.4, that the star was like the dove which rested on Christ at his baptism [Matt 3.16-17 et parr.], i.e. a sign of his deity (vol. 2, p. 173-174 Baehrens [GCS]) ; and of the anonymous author of the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, that the star’s movement shows that the physical elements wait upon those who seek God, and the star’s stopping was its way of saying to the Magi “here he is” since it could not speak (PG 56.641).\n\n[63]\n\nSermo 31.1 “stella novae claritatis apparuit, quae inlustrior ceteris pulchriorque sideribus” (CCL 138, p. 161.13-14) ; Sermo 33.1 “novi sideris” (p. 171.33-34), “stellis ceteris stella fulgentior” (p. 172.36) ; Sermo 34.1 “Nova etenim claritas apud magos stellae inlustrioris apparuit” (p. 179.23-24) and 34.2 “fulgore insoliti sideris” (p. 180.37-38) ; Sermo 36.1 “novi sideris” (p. 195.5).\n\n[64]\n\nδύναμις τις ἀόρατος εἰς ταύτην μετασχηματισθεῖσα τὴν ὄψιν (PG 57.64). This interpretation was offered earlier by Diodore of Tarsus, who wrote that the star was not one of the many other stars of heaven but rather a divine power represented by a star (τὸν ϕανέντα ἀστέρα μὴ ἕνα τῶν πολλῶν καὶ κατ᾽ οὐρανὸν εἶναι, ἀλλὰ δύναμίν τινα θειοτέραν, εἰς ἄστρον μὲν σχηματιζομένην [p. 47.23-25 Henry]) — a curious type of exegesis from a representative of the Antiochene school.\n\n[65]\n\nΤί οὖν τὸ πεῖσαν αὐτούς; Τὸ παρασκευάσαν οἴκοθεν ἀναστῆναι καὶ τοσαύτην ἐλθεῖν ὁδόν‧ τοῦτο δὲ ἦν ὅ τε ἀστὴρ καὶ ἡ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ γενομένη τῇ διανοίᾳ αὐτῶν ἔλλαμψις… (PG 57.83).\n\n[66]\n\nπάλιν ἄγγελος αὐτοὺς παραλαβὼν πάντα ἐδίδαξε (PG 57.77).\n\n[67]\n\n“[…] tam pinnatus rapidoque simillimus austro/ nuntius” (CCL 126, p. 98).\n\n[68]\n\nP. 9 Peeters ; on the date of this passage see ibid., p. vii-xi, l-liv.\n\n[69]\n\nJ.
