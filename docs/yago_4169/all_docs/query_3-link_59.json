In August 1992 Paul Mirecki and Marvin Meyer invited a series of colleagues from a variety of disciplines to an international conference, held at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, on “Magic in the Ancient World.” The scholars in attendance all addressed the phenomena of ancient magic and ritual power from the perspectives of their own disciplines, but they did so with a particular concern for the general issues of definition and taxonomy. From that conference there emerged a volume, edited by Meyer and Mirecki and published in 1995 by Brill, entitled Ancient Magic and Ritual Power. As noted in the introduction to the volume, “An understanding of ‘magic’ as ‘ritual power’ … permeates many of the essays in this volume” (4). The present volume comes from a similar scholarly conference. In August 1998 Meyer and Mirecki assembled the magoi once again— many of them the usual suspects—at a second international conference, held at Chapman University in Orange, California, and the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity of Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California, on “Magic in the Ancient World.” (This conference was made possible through the generous support of the Griset Lectureship Fund and the Wang-Fradkin Professorship of Chapman University and the Coptic Magical Texts Project of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity.) As at the Kansas conference, Jonathan Z. Smith delivered a plenary lecture, and the scholars at the California conference similarly employed the methods and perspectives of their disciplines to discuss ancient magic and ritual power. And as at the Kansas conference, the volume emerging from the conference, Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World, seeks to contribute to the continuing discussion of magic and ritual power in the ancient Near East, Judaism, Greco-Roman antiquity, and early Christianity, with an additional contribution on the world of Coptic and Islamic Egypt. The strength of the present volume, we suggest, lies in the breadth of scholarship represented. While, as in the previous volume, issues of description and classification are everywhere apparent or assumed in these essays (and especially in Part 2), and the understanding of magic\n\n\n\n\n\nas ritual power runs as a scholarly thread through the book, the essays themselves are remarkably wide-ranging in their approaches and concerns. Taken together, the essays thus provide an excellent glimpse of the status quaestionis of the study of magic and ritual power in Mediterranean and Near Eastern antiquity and late antiquity. * * * The essays in this volume are organized into six sections: 1) “New Texts of Magic and Ritual Power,” 2) “Definitions and Theory,” 3) “The Ancient Near East,” 4) “Judaism,” 5) “Greek and Roman Antiquity,” and 6) “Early Christianity and Islam.” Part 1 presents four essays in which new magical texts and new interpretations are made available. In an essay entitled “A New Magical Formulary,” William Brashear and Roy Kotansky present the editio princeps of P. Berol. 17202. This fourth-century papyrus sheet from a magical handbook preserves six recipes in Greek: a Christian liturgical exorcism with historiolae focusing on Jesus’ miracles, a pagan invocation to silence opponents, a hymnic invocation, an adjuration with ritual procedures, a spell to achieve an erection, and a sacred stele termed the “second.” In “Two Papyri with Formulae for Divination,” David Jordan improves upon two previously published papyri with formulae for divination (PGM XXIVa and LXXVII). The first involves a ritual with 29 palm leaves, each with the name of a god written upon it, and the other involves instructions for receiving an oracle through an invocation. In “An Early Christian Gold Lamella for Headache,” Roy Kotansky presents the editio princeps of a Greek text from a private collection in London. This second-century lamella may derive from a Hellenistic Jewish milieu that appropriated Jesus’ name for its magical purposes, or from an early type of Jewish-Christianity. The text apparently dates from a time when magical texts had not yet been “commercialized” to the extent that can be observed when later formulaic language replaced the more independent style of amulet composition. In “A Seventh-Century Coptic Limestone in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Bodl. Coptic inscr. 426),” Paul Mirecki presents the editio princeps of a series of short texts written on a large Coptic limestone. The titles and incipits of the four gospels and a list of the apostles’ names often occur together in Christian magical texts, suggesting a context of ritual power for these texts and even for the limestone itself. The wide-ranging possibilities for the stone’s function suggest either that it was a scribe’s display copy for school texts or for the writing of amulets, or else that it was a monastic boundary stone with inspirational or apotropaic words of power.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2 presents five essays that address explicitly theoretical matters of definition and description. In “Great Scott! Thought and Action One More Time,” Jonathan Z. Smith opens his essay with a discussion of the origin and meaning of the popular thaumatic ejaculation “Great Scott!,” which serves as an entree into the scholarly debate on the definition of magic as a phenomenon that is either primarily “thought (belief)” or “action (ritual).” Smith concludes with a plea for a theoretical resolution to this question of duality. In “Theories of Magic in Antiquity,” Fritz Graf responds to R. A. Markus’ study on pre-Augustinian theories about magic and Augustine’s own neglected semiotic theory. Graf demonstrates that there were several different pre-Augustinian theories of magic in both Greek and Roman thinking, and that Augustine’s theory was not as neglected as Markus supposes. Graf offers suggestions on how the results of his study are useful for the further history of theoretical reflections on magic. In “The Poetics of the Magical Charm: An Essay on the Power of Words,” Henk Versnel addresses poetics in the double sense of “the art of making poetry and the art of creation.” Through a careful exegesis of several texts, Versnel demonstrates that the magical charm is the product of a happy alliance between the expectancy of a marvelous potential in an “other world,” beyond the boundaries of space and time, and oral utterance, which can belong to common communication or can even transcend speech and help create the “other world.” In “Dynamics of Ritual Expertise in Antiquity and Beyond: Towards a New Taxonomy of ‘Magicians,’” David Frankfurter offers a cross-cultural analysis of what he calls “the dynamics of ritual expertise,” in the service of constructing a spatial (center/periphery) model for understanding indigenous conceptions of ritual expertise. This model, which allows for a certain fluidity among types, engages current discussions of taxonomy in the history of religions (definitions of “magic” and “magicians”) beyond the static classifications of M. Weber and G. Van der Leeuw. In “Fiat Magia,” Christopher A. Hoffman begins with E. E. Evans-Pritchard’s observation that all labels (such as the term “magic”) are essentially arbitrary, and proceeds to survey some of the major approaches and taxonomies in the modern history of the study of magic. Hoffman ends by noting that the approaches he surveys have been valuable in helping scholars move away from the essentially negative evaluation of magic that once dominated the field. Part 3 presents four essays on magic and ritual among ancient Mesopotamians, Hittites, Canaanites, and Israelites. In “Dividing a God,” Richard H. Beal examines Hittite terms and rituals used in priestly instructions for “dividing a deity.” Hittite ritual specialists\n\n\n\n\n\nwere able to create two separate cult centers for the same deity by performing specific rituals that caused the deity to divide itself. Then, through a pattern of rituals of considerable interest to scholars of magic and ritual power, the allomorph was coaxed into moving to the new cult center. In “Translating Transfers in Ancient Mesopotamia,” JoAnn Scurlock applies to ancient Mesopotamian studies the classic analysis of modern Moroccan ritual and belief by E. Westermarck. Scurlock identifies and analyzes Mesopotamian rituals and beliefs concerning “transferal,” in which a concrete or abstract quality, such as a disease, is transferred out of an afflicted person, animal, or object into another person, animal, or object. She identifies a striking congruence between ritual and belief in ancient and modern religions. In “Necromancy, Fertility and the Dark Earth: The Use of Ritual Pits in Hittite Cult,” Billie Jean Collins analyzes Hittite texts concerning ritual pits and the sacrifice of pigs to the supreme underworld deity. Collins shows that previously separate porcine associations of fertility and purification/offering were combined to generate a ritual koine in which fertility became chthonian by virtue of its symbolic association with the pig and the ambiguity inherent in the term “earth” (fertile soil and underworld). In “Canaanite Magic Versus Israelite Religion: Deuteronomy 18 and the Taxonomy of Taboo,” Brian B. Schmidt proposes that the prevailing interpretive mode, which avers that ancient Israel syncretistically adopted Canaanite magic, finds only partial justification in isolated biblical traditions. Schmidt argues that the Hebrew Bible, taken as a whole, hardly yields a unified portrayal of what constitutes magic over against religion, let alone how one is to distinguish ancient Canaanites from ancient Israelites. Part 4 presents three essays on aspects of magic within Judaism. In “Secrecy and Magic, Publicity and Torah: Unpacking a Talmudic Tale,” S. Daniel Breslauer investigates the rejection of magic in the Talmudic tractate Sanhedrin and seeks to understand the type of Judaism contrasted with magic. Breslauer focuses on the ideas of Rabbi Aqiva and the story of his martyrdom, and the approach to magic by Aqiva that later dominates the Talmudic approach. Breslauer suggests that the Talmud, through its narrative of Aqiva’s death, teaches that magic is a process and an attitude, not a particular action, that the difference between magic and liturgy lies not in what it accomplishes but in its public display, and that magic is antithetical to Judaism because the Jewish mission is one of public proclamation rather than secretive ritual. In “Shamanic Initiatory Death and Resurrection in the Hekhalot Literature,” James R. Davila explores an aspect of the Hekhalot tradition of the shamanic vocation of the “descenders to the chariot”: an experience of initiatory disintegration\n\n\n\n\n\nand reintegration that establishes the shaman’s supernatural power. Those who “descend to the chariot” in their quest to gaze directly at God face great dangers, specifically personal disintegration that burns and rends its victims; but worthy mortals like Enoch and Rabbi Aqiva (Akiva) are transformed rather than destroyed. This is an experience strikingly similar to that of shamans who undergo a personal destruction and resurrection in order to function in the supernatural world. In “Sacrificial Themes in Jewish Magic,” Michael D. Swartz discusses how the image of the ancient sacrificial cult influenced the literature of Jewish magic. Both magic and sacrifice deal with physical aspects of religion, and each is concerned with dispelling the demonic and attracting the divine. The two elements that make a ritual specifically magical in its appropriation of the Temple ritual are the power of the divine name and the means by which the ritual makes an exclusive cult available to all who possess its secrets. Both elements entail a shift in focus from the collective concerns of the Temple cult to the concerns of the individual. Part 5 presents five essays on magical texts and practices in GrecoRoman antiquity. In “The Ethnic Origins of a Roman-Era Philtrokatadesmos (PGM IV 296-434),” Christopher A. Faraone reconsiders arguments for the Egyptian origin of a Roman-era philtrokatadesmos found in a PGM text (with five other attestations). Faraone argues, primarily against Robert Ritner’s analysis, that this philtrokatadesmos in fact derived not from Egyptian models and traditions, but rather is an amalgam of two originally separate Greek and Semitic practices that entered Roman Egypt, when it accommodated local practices by acquiring Egyptian features. In “Sacrifice in the Greek Magical Papyri,” Sarah Iles Johnston examines a neglected area of research, the roles that sacrifice played in magical rituals. Focusing on three spells found in PGM IV, Johnston argues that the practitioner of sacrifice innovated within standard patterns, neither ignoring traditional rituals nor reversing or corrupting them. Such a practitioner was a “creative conservator” of traditional rituals, who used expert knowledge to extend sacrificial rituals while preserving their underlying ideologies. In “Beans, Fleawort, and the Blood of a Hamadryas Baboon: Recipe Ingredients in Greco-Roman Magical Materials,” Lynn R. LiDonnici examines the four types of substances used in recipes within the PGM and focuses on the fourth type, which consists of exotic substances with no ordinary roles in temple life or domestic shrines, and which may or may not have any actual pharmacological effects. A primary concern of scholars has been the identification of these substances. LiDonnici suggests that synonyms and descriptions of these substances in the PGM are not a license for\n\n\n\n\n\nsubstitution with other more normal materials, and that common plants cannot be assumed to lie behind rare and unusual substances required in the PGM handbooks. In “The Witches’ Thessaly,” Oliver Phillips focuses on the ancient Greek reputation for sorcery in the geographical region of Thessaly. Phillips investigates primary texts indicating this reputation for sorcery and, at the end of his analysis, suggests that the popular legend of Medea is the primary source, associating her with the Thessalian port of Iolcus. In “Speech Acts and the Stakes of Hellenism in Late Antiquity,” Peter T. Struck argues that in order to understand Iamblichus’ work de Mysteriis, which advocates the practice of mysterious sacred rites to achieve spiritual ascent in contrast to the strategies of pure contemplation extending from Plato to Plotinus, scholars must be attentive to two entangled visions: magic and Eastern foreigners. Struck analyzes the debate between Iamblichus (irrational, magic, foreign languages) and Porphyry (rational, contemplation, Greek language), and demonstrates that both thinkers agreed on the terms of the dichotomy, though they valued them in different ways. Part 6 presents three essays on magic and ritual power in early Christianity and Islam. In “The Prayer of Mary Who Dissolves Chains in Coptic Magic and Religion,” Marvin Meyer discusses several texts, especially P. Heid. Inv. Kopt. 685, featuring the Virgin Mary offering a prayer of power in order to provide release from bondage. Meyer provides an overview of the larger setting of the prayer of Mary, and illustrates how the prayer of Mary and rituals of liberation from bondage also function within the context of the Coptic church. This raises the question of whether the magical Mary of texts of ritual power may be distinguished from the miraculous Mary of the Coptic church. Or, as Meyer puts it, “Mary still is in control of the chains, but the question remains, who is in control of Mary?” In “The Magician and the Heretic: The Case of Simon Magus,” Ayse Tuzlak studies the figure of Simon Magus in the light of differing early Christian portrayals of him as a heretic and as a magician, with a view to understanding the way some early Christians understood the terms “magic” and “magician.” In “Ancient Execration Magic in Coptic and Islamic Egypt,” Nicole B. Hansen investigates the extent to which the folklore of modern Egypt can be traced back to pharaonic times. Taking as a point of departure Ritner’s observation that ancient Egyptian execration praxis remained virtually unchanged for 4000 years, Hansen demonstrates the continuity of the mechanics of execration practice in Egypt in later times. In this way she shows that the ancient religious beliefs and practices have been recast by practitioners of magic in terms of the\n\n\n\n\n\ntwo religions dominant in Egypt in later times: Coptic Christianity and Islam. The Index of Primary Sources at the conclusion of the volume has been prepared by Linden Youngquist. * * * Among the essays in Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World is the papyrological presentation of the Greek text from Berlin, P. Berol. 17202. Our late colleague William M. Brashear presented the text at the California magic conference, and Roy Kotansky completed the work on the essay after Bill’s untimely death. This essay is placed at the beginning of the volume in order to give prominence to this study in particular and to Bill’s papyrological work in general. Bill Brashear was educated at Oberlin College, the Freie Universität in Berlin, and the University of Michigan, from which institution he received his Ph.D. in Classics. Bill was a long-term staff member of the Ägyptisches Museum in Berlin where he was keeper of Greek Papyri from 1979 until his untimely death, and he lectured throughout Europe, North America, and the People’s Republic of China. His brilliant papyrological contributions are well known. We need only recall his bibliographical essay, “The Greek Magical Papyri: an Introduction and Survey; Annotated Bibliography (1928-1994) [Indices in vol. II 18.6],” his edition of A Mithraic Catechism from Egypt, and his most recent book, Wednesday’s Child is Full of Woe, in order to appreciate his knowledge, his control of scholarly information, and his papyrological exactness and creativity. In February 2000 Bill died, after battling illness for a period of time. We miss him very much, both personally and professionally. With sadness at his passing and appreciation for his life and thought, we dedicate this volume to Bill.\n\n\n\n Selected Bibliography\n\nAnkarloo, Bengt, and Stuart Clark, eds.

Papyrus codex sheet Provenance unknown (?)\n\nThis fragmentary leaf from a papyrus codex preserves, in part or in full, six separate recipes for magical spells, separated from one another with horizontal lines that run the full width of the column: I. an exorcism with allusions to the birth and miracles of Jesus (1-12); II. a pagan fimvtikÒn to silence opponents (13-19); III. a prose, hymnic invocation (20-22); IV. an adjuration with ritual procedures against a thief (ı kl°ptvn, 23-30); V. a spell to achieve an erection (31-33); and VI. a “Sacred Stele” (ﬂerå sthlÆ), called the “second” (34-36). The papyrus sheet measures 19.0 cm. across and 24.1 cm. high. Whether the sheet was originally a single looseleaf, one of several, or part of a complete codex, cannot be determined. It is also impossible to establish with certainty whether one side, in fact, preceded the other; however, we have designated one as side A (vertical fibers) and the other as side B (horizontal fibers) to facilitate discussion. We have 1 We would like to thank the able staff of the Papyrussammlung in Berlin for their permission to present this important papyrus text, and Margarette Büsing for the excellent photograph. The initial reading and decipherment of this difficult text is due to the tireless and indefatigable efforts of the late William M. Brashear, without whom this edition would not have been possible. Dr. R. Kotansky is responsible for the editing and the commentary on the text. Any outstanding problems of interpretation remain his. Professor Paul Mirecki has provided the introductory description of the papyrus sheet. Additional improvements in the reading of the text come through the keen insights of David Jordan, Paul Mirecki, Marv Meyer, and the rest of the team of the Kansas Papyrology Conference, whose fruitful discussions and interpretations on this unusual text have contributed greatly to its overall interpretation. Although it is hoped that the spirit of the commentary and analysis of the text reflect the sort of scholarship Bill would have enjoyed, we can only regret that we have been unable to benefit from the full range of analysis that his exacting brand of research would have doubtless brought to its explication.\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nalso numbered the lines seriatim from side A across to side B. Side A may indeed precede side B, as B appears to end in line 36 in a list of magical letters (xarakt∞rew). Although such characters often conclude magical texts, barring any further evidence this alone cannot serve to establish the priority of one side over the other. The loss of text at both the top and bottom margins (see below) further confounds the issue. The papyrus leaflet is constructed of two smaller sheets which had been glued together and presummably formed part of a blank scroll, or an uninscribed portion of a used scroll. The kollesis, or glueing between the sheets, is clearly visible and measures ca. 2.3 cm. wide. The overlapping edges of the two sheets are visible on side A between lines 7 and 8, and on side B between lines 27 and 28. The upper sheet measures ca. 19.0 x 7.0 cm., and the lower sheet, ca. 19.0 x 19.4 cm. The kollesis, a naturally stronger portion of the sheet, has caused enough stress on the weaker portions outside of the kollesis to result in some damage at the bottom edge of the kollesis: there one finds a long horizontal lacuna between lines 7 and 8 of side A (= lines 28 and 29 of side B). Where the papyrus is intact, strips of fiber once inscribed have loosened and fallen away from the sheet. This type of damage is clearly evident on side A, where vertical strips have fallen away resulting in a loss of letters from the same sections of lines 1 through 12, and on side B, where horizontal strips have fallen away resulting in the loss of text below line 36. Other inscribed portions have lost ink through abrasion (side B, lines 25-29). The scribe has drawn several horizontal lines across both sides of the sheet as text separators (following the lines 12, 19, 30 [two parallel lines], 33, and 38). There appears to be only one scribal hand which varies greatly in both style and size. This variation suggests that the recipes were occasionally copied by a single individual over an indeterminable period from either another sourcebook (or sourcebooks), or from amulets randomly acquired. The scribe might also have used more than one pen and certainly more than one solution of ink. He (or she) writes large square letters with a slant to the upper right in the first four recipes but in recipes five and six changes style. There the writing becomes more hurried and cursive, and the ink lighter through dilution. Overall, the scribe writes in a practiced but hurried style typical of documentary hands of the fourth century CE. The text shows typical late features in spelling, including the intrusive final -n in 3rd declension accusatives (monogenÆn for monogen∞ in lines 3f.; pe'dan [viz. pa›dan] for pa›da in line 4; l°ontan for l°onta in line 16). A number of minor corrections are supplied above the line\n\n   \n\n\n\n(7, 8, 12, 21, 30, 31); the first recipe shows phrases added, in somewhat smaller letters, interlinearly. The text itself also presents a number of morphological and syntactical anomalies. In line 1 there may be an apparent use of the active voice for the passive, although the reading is questionable. Several of these difficulties in the text can only be explained from the thesis that the scribe was working with from a cursive model that had, at some time, been formerly misunderstood in transcription. Thus »xleukÒtvn, if correct, would presuppose an original Ùxloum°nvn (1); oem[Ònvn an original dem[Ònvn (leg. dai[mÒnvn [1]); ı nÊs[aw an original ı lÊs[aw (2); pod«n an original pÒdaw; klÒuda (sic) an original klãsma (23); and énallabã (sic) an original énalab≈n (31). In any event, the text in these places is unusually corrupt. Elsewhere, the syntax and sense has gone awry, especially with spell IV (lines 23-30), where little more than disjointed, meaningless phrases seem to be preserved. Two of the extant titles (rubrics) use the genitive (of advantage?) without any preposition to introduce the spell: t≥[«]n »xl≥euk≥Ò≥t≥vn (1) and cv≥ ≥ l∞w (31); another is a simple title in the nominative, eﬂerå s≥thlØ deu≥[t°ra] (34), indented in the text (34). An earlier phrase, tÚn kl°ptont≥a≥ pnig›n{e} (28), also seems to be in eisthesi, and thus begins a rubric, as well. P.

Magical Signs\n\nCommentary  Christian Liturgical Exorcism. The text begins with an apparent exorcism (see Commentary below, ad loc.). A similar liturgical exorcism using Biblically based historiolae is preserved in P. Cairo 10263 (= PGM 13), a 4th or 5th cent. papyrus that had been buried with a mummy. Preisendanz-Henrichs II, p. 220 gives references to earlier literature that provides good parallels to the Christian elements in the text. One may also compare Suppl. Mag. I. 31 ( = P. Turner 49) “with extracts from the Christian credo,” and PGM 18 (5th / 6th cent.), a text that lists the account of the raising of Lazarus and the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law, along with a kind of generic summary. PGM 23, as well, contains a free reading of Matt 14:1831 (the Stilling of the Storm) for use as an amulet. For specific Greek parallels from liturgical exorcisms see, e.g. A. Strittmatter, “Ein griechisches Exorzismusbüchlein: Ms. Car. 143 b der Zentralbibliothek in Zürich,” Orientalia Christiana (De Oriente documenta, studia et libri) XXVI-2 (1932), no. 78: 127-144 (Text), p. 131, 5-20, and the literature cited in the Commentary below. On “Greek Liturgical Exorcisms” see in general the literature in R. Kotansky, “Remnants of a Liturgical Exorcism on a Gem,” Le Muséon 108 (1995), 143-156, esp. 147-149. Our text also seems to include credal language along with an apparent liturgical response, sometimes interpolated as interlinear phrases set into the main body of the text (lines 1a, 5a). In lines 57 and 10-12, these “responses” must have been previously copied into the main body of the text, since they are not an interlinear addendum, per se, but read as a natural continuation of the previous credal material. They must have begun life as responsive verses some time before the present edition of our text. Further-\n\n   \n\n\n\nmore, the first interlinear response (line 1a) is probably out of place. Accepting the alternating scheme presented below, this initial kyrie-type address is better suited if reconstructed to follow line 2 rather than to precede it. All this suggests that our text has enjoyed a number of prior generations, of which this, the latest, shows the most recent “responses” added in as our lines 1a and 5a (see reconstruction below). All of the “responsory” lines, whether interlinear additions or contiguous text, display the same general character: the subjects of the verses invoke Jesus directly (in abbreviated form: kÊrie, 1a, 11; kÊrie ÉIhsoËw Xr¤ste, 7); use the 2nd person pronoun “you(r)” in their invocation (t“ s“ , 1a; sou, 7; toË soË, 11; ±y°lhsaw, 4a); and present themselves antithetically as a kind of group whose human condition (én≥[yr≈poiw, 1a; t∆ g°now ény≈pvn≥, 5; pãnta, 11) stands in obedience (§p[Æ]kousan, 11) to a divine command (prostãgmati, 1a, 11). These lines are characteristic of antiphonal replies by a liturgical group of some kind, perhaps a laity. For the featured use of “you” in similar contexts, one may compare A. D. Nock’s remarks in “Liturgical Notes,” JTS 30 (1929), 381-395, esp. p. 384 (on so¤ gãr as an “aside” in the Anaphora of Serapion). The contrasting “verse” material, on the other hand, uses only the 3rd person in its description of various divine acts (Christian historiolae) related to the kerygmatic life of Jesus (lines 2-5; 7-10). These are features that are not in themselves typical of personalized charms and amulets, even Christian ones, which routinely quote Biblical verses and Psalms verbatim and do not make reference to more theological allusions and responses of a liturgical sort. Only in line 12 does our text seem to revert back to a concept of an individual to be protected in its use of the singular (“me, the sinner”). This, too, however, probably has its origin in credal and liturgical material, not in magical and amuletic texts, even if exorcism seems to be in question. The exorcism here seems to be based on Christian liturgy and may indeed have been baptismal or eucharistic in function. The use of similar liturgical “antiphonies” is echoed, albeit in an abbreviated form, in P. Louvre E 7332 bis (7th c.), ed. William M. Brashear, Magica Varia (Papyrologica Bruxellensia 25; Bruxelles: Fondation Égyptologique Reine Élisabeth, 1991), no. 2: A Christian Prayer Amulet. There the phrase, “For all are obedient to you with fear,” in a manner similar to the apparent antiphonal reading of the Berlin papyrus here, occurs with but a single miraclehistoriola. PGM 6d also preserves a fragment of a kindred text (cf. Brashear, Magica Varia, p. 66, for a corrected reading). The follow-\n\n\n\n  ‒        ing reconstruction illustrates how one might arrange such credal texts to highlight the antiphonal character of their purported liturgies. In the case of the Berlin papyrus, it is clear that some of the responses fall slightly out of sequence, for which see the Commentary below. Liturgical Reconstructions\n\nP.

Cairo 10263 (= PGM 13) the long list of kerygmatic items at the beginning of the prayer is capped by the formula, “Come, Mercy, the God of Eternity” in line 9 (for text, see Commentary below). This, in turn, is followed by the liturgical response, “Jesus, the voice that appeases sinners, as many as we who call upon Your Name” (line 14). This use of the communal “we” stands in contrast to the singular “I call upon you” that occurs at the beginning of that papyrus. The original context of these liturgical texts with refrain seems to be eucharistic. Each ends with an appeal to the Lord to “come” (§ly°), with mercy, to the sinner (or the sufferer). Although in each context both the recounting of miracles and the unison-like responses of the group, described collectively as “men” (“people”) or “all”, may be part of a pre-existent eucharistic text, they have been adapted for exorcistic and other kinds of healings. Even this therapeutic function, however, may have been original to the eucharistic setting itself. The ridding of demons and illness was a common prerequisite for both baptism and Eucharist in post-Apostolic Christianity; see R. Kotansky, “Excursus: Liturgical Exorcism, Solomon, and Magic Lamellae,” in Greek Magical Amulets I (Opladen, 1994), pp. 174-180 (= GMA), and literature there cited. In instructions for the Mass given in Cyril of Jerusalem (see Alfred Adam, Liturgische Texte I. Zur Geschichte der orientalischen Taufe und Messe im II. und IV. Jahrhundert [3. Auflage. Kleine Texte 5; Berlin: deGruyter, 1960), Cyril von Jerusalem, Messe, V.2 (p. 15-17)], responses between priest and laity are given in the form of antiphonal readings. 1 t≥[«]n v≥xl≥e≥u≥k≥o≥[.]vn: inevitably t«n »xleukÒtvn (Brashear). But the presence of ÍpÒ (“by”) and the general sense suggest the passive not active voice (»≥xl≥e≥u≥m≥°≥[n]vn, for Ùxloum°nvn). Although the reading »≥xl≥e≥u≥k≥Ò≥[t]vn seems secure, it is possible that this represents the misidentification of certain cursive letters in a previous model that a scribe drew upon. Also, the cursive kappa here is wholly unlike those of the rest of the papyrus and looks almost identical, for example, to the mu of monoge/nÆn in 3f. Further≥ n in -k≥o≥tv ≥ n is also the favored reading, this more, although the -o≥t v too may have derived from an originally cursive -envn. See further the comments below, and those on line 23. That »xl≥e u≥ ≥k≥Ò≥t≥vn is perhaps an articial reading of sorts, is suggested at first blush by the unusual form of this verb. ÉOxleÊv is a rare variation of the common Ùxl°v, a variation preserved only in Homer, Iliad 21.260f., toË m°n te pror°ontow ÍpÚ chf›dew ëpasai/ ÙleËntai (said of pebbles that are disturbed by the rush of flowing\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nwater). Were it not for the presence of certain poetic forms elsewhere in the Berlin text (e.g., ¶rdv and proskul¤v in 35; oÈrãnh in 28), this form here would not otherwise be expected. On Ùxl°v used in demonological contexts, cf. esp. Luke 6:18 (ka‹ oﬂ §noxloÊmenoi épÚ pneumãtvn ékayãrtvn §yerapeÊonto; cf. Acts 5:16); Tobit (LXX) 6:8B (§ãn tina Ùxlª daimÒnion µ pneËma ponhrÒn); Act.

Sol. (ed. McCown) L: I.2; II.5; IV.12; V.6,9,12; VII.8. OEM [ca. 9]: probably understand DEM[Ònvn], viz. daim[Ònvn] (e.g. da m[Ònvn kak«n]), as suggested by the parallels, above (a reading of ÍpÚ Ùs≥m[∞w?, “by an odor”, does not seem possible here—the epsilon is rather certain). The omicron, which is clearly written on the papyrus, is almost certainly an error for delta, albeit an error that originated in an earlier exemplar. Several readings in the text, as noted above, presuppose an earlier, corrupted model whose misspellings probably arose out of the misidentification of cursive writing. On spells against demons, cf. the formulary in Suppl. Mag. II. 94 ii. 17: p≥r≥(Úw) da≥imo≥niazom°nou≥[w, ktl.; David R. Jordan & Roy D. Kotansky, “A Solomonic Exorcism,” in Kölner Papyri (P.

This interlinear line reads like a collective response to the programmatic “liturgy” of the rest of the text, of which response there are several in our text. In this sense, what we have imbedded here is a liturgical reading (versicle) to which is added a congregational response (responsory), as noted above. PrÒstagma does not occur in the New Testament, per se, but is used by postApostolic writers, mostly in the plural: Diognetus 12:5 (sg.); 1 Clem. 2:8; 3:4; 20:5; 37:1; 40:5; 50:5; 58:2; 2 Clem. 19:3; cf. the verb pros°tajen of the angel’s command to Joseph in Matt. 1:24.

(Oxford: Clarendon, 1905), p. 394, 13. 2 The Redemption of the Punished (?). The order and reference of this introductory element in the kerygmatic catalogue, preserved as t≥[Ún] kolazÒmenon ı n≥Ês[aw ... (leg. l≥Ês[aw ... ), is problematic (see below). The phrase probably refers to some initial redemptive act of God the Father in reference to the entire Christ-event that the exorcistic text is meant to catalogue, even though there is nothing from the New Testament narratives from which this might be derived (see § to follow). The subject of the main participial verb, ı lÊsaw, appears to be God, as is that of the two that follow, §japost(e)¤law and §noikÆsaw. With the liturgical vocative that comes next, “O Lord Jesus Christ” (line 7), the main verbs in the form of participles switch to Jesus as subject. It should also be pointed out that the nu may be a lambda with an extra vertical stroke, l≥i ,≥ or, there may be a phonetic confusion between the two liquids l and n. The liturgical ‘exorcism’ in Pradel, Gebete, p. 260, line 18f. begins with a more ‘standardized’ version of this kerygmatic element: YeÚw ı aﬁ≈niow ı lutrvsãmenow §k t∞w aﬁxmalvs¤aw toË diabÒlou tÚ g°now t«n ényr≈pvn; see also Louis Delatte, Un Office byzantin d’Exorcisme (Académie royale de Belqique, Mémoires, 52; Bruxelles, 1957), p. 38, 27f.; p. 74, 6f.: ... KÊrie, ı diå toË monogenoËw sou uﬂoË lutrvsãmenow tÚ g°now t«n ényr≈pvn. In the same text, Delatte, Un office byzantin, p. 64, 17, the phrase, SÊ, KÊrie, diå toÊtvn t«n èg¤vn kolasthr¤vn (“you Lord, through these holy punishments ...”) refers to the suffering and crucifixion. Does the P. Berol. text refer to Christ’s redemption? The Supplementum ad Liturgiam S. Chrysostomi, “A Prayer of Chrysostomus for Those Suffering from Demons,” etc. ( = Migne, PG 64C, p. 1061, from Goar, Rituale Graecorum [Paris, 1647, p. 583 [corr.]) gives a similar text, with numerous parallels from related liturgical kerygmata (e.g., p. 1064C / 1065B); cf. esp. Orationes sive Exorcismi Magni Basilii (= Migne, PG 31, §697, p. 1634A): ı tåw desmeuye¤saw t“ yanãtƒ cuxåw lÊsaw ... ı lÊsaw tåw ÙdÊnaw ≤m«n; see further, Commentary below, on the ‘Sending of the Son.’ 3-4 The Sending of the Son. The precise phrasing ı §japost¤law tÚn monoge/nÆn sou pa›da (pap. pedan) does not correspond to any Biblical passage. The closest parallel is that of John 3:16-17 (oÏtvw går ±gãphsen ı yeÚw tÚn kÒsmon, Àste tÚn uﬂÚn tÚn monogen∞ ¶dvken ... / oÈ går ép°steilen ı yeÚw tÚn uﬂÚn ktl.; cf. John 1:14, 18). The motif of the Son having been sent (by God) is preserved in the logion of Matt. 10:40; Mark 9:37; Luke 9:48. The use of pa›w\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\n(either “servant” or “child”) of Jesus seems to be special to older kerygmatic material found in the Book of Acts (3:13, 16; 4:27, 30). In a magical context, one may also compare PGM 5d.3f.: tÚn uﬂÚn monogen∞ perib°blhma[i:, ktl.]. The aorist participle, ı §japost(e)¤law, continues a historiolae-sequence of a liturgical nature that begins with Christ’s Pre-existence and mostly enumerates his miracles: Redemption of Humankind (?), Sending (into the World), Virgin Birth, Walking on Water, Feeding of 5000. The example from PGM 13, above, has a similar participial sequence, but is based on a chronological, rather than a miracle-based kerygmatic scheme: Entrance into the World, Virgin Birth, Youth in Nazareth, Crucifixion, Rending of Temple Veil, Resurrection, Appearance, Ascension, and so on. In Pradel, Gebete (Comm. supra), p. 260, 1f. a similar formulaic verse comes at the very beginning of a related “catalogue” which, as here, is typified by the use of a set of participial phrases: ı p°mcaw tÚn monogen∞ uﬂÚn tÚn kÊrion Ím«n, ktl. The order suggests that the two elements in the Berlin liturgical text should perhaps be reversed. In the Didache 9.3 a eucharistic formula similarly uses pa›w of Jesus (see Commentary. below, line 23). 4-5 The Virgin Birth. As with the rest of this text, the couplet ka‹ §n lagÒs≥i pary[°]/no≥u §noikÆsaw finds no exact New Testament parallel. This element, however, does not narrate the Virgin Birth, per se, as much as the Divine Indwelling, as alluded to in the Biblical Annunciation (cf. Luke 1: 26-38). In Luke 1:30 Mary is said that she will “conceive in her womb”, sullÆmc˙ tª gastr¤ (cf. however Matt. 1:23, the Christi nativitas, proper). The notion of the Virgin being “indwelled” (§noikÆsaw) by God may be a distant echo of Luke 1:35, where, however, it is said that the Holy Spirit will “come upon” (§peleÊsetai) Mary, and the power of the Highest will “overshadow” (§piskiãsei) her. In the Berlin papyrus the subject of the verb “having indwelled” is God himself, the same as that of “having sent.” Sensu stricto, the formula §noike›n + §n means “to live in (the womb).” God the Father “lived in” the womb of Mary in the form of Jesus. Lag≈n (“hollow”; “flanks”) in the plural in late Greek means “womb”. The word does not appear in the Biblical versions. Our text preserves an entirely independent textual witness, probably oral in derivation. Once again with the Berlin papyrus we have non-Biblical recollection of traditional Christian themes. For pary°nou, cf. Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:27, etc. The Cairo exorcism (PGM 13), cited above, contains the formula ı §ly∆n diå toË GabriØl §n tª gastr‹ t∞w Mar¤a[w], t∞w pary°no[u], ktl., which stands more in line with the Biblical text. 5 t≥∆ g°now ényr≈pvn: the putative tau is difficult to read, but looks\n\n   \n\n\n\nlike it was squeezed in between the letters. Again, the material is non-Biblical. The overall formula appears in the Christian exorcisms cited above, Commentary line 2; see, further, Delatte, Un office byzantin, p. 61, 6f.: ı dvrhsãmenow t“ g°nei t«n ényr≈pvn. For the expression in pagan contexts, cf. PGM IX. 5: ... katadoÊlvson pçn g°now ényr≈pvn. This parenthetical remark appears to be one of the antiphonal addresses discussed above that elsewhere in the text appear sometimes as interlinear glosses (cf. én≥[yr≈poiw] in 1b). Its presence in the liturgy seems to acknowledge a doctrinal difficulty with understanding the nature of the concept of a virgin birth. 6-7 tØn g°nes¤n / sou: This is a faint echo of Matt. 1:18 (ToË d¢ ÉIhsoË XristoË ≤ g°nesiw oÏtvw ∑n), which begins the pericope of the Virgin Birth; cf. Delatte, Un office byzantin, p. 73, 3f.: Ka‹ sÊ, KÊrie ÉIhsoË Xrist°, diå t∞w §nanyrvpÆsevw ka‹ t∞w gennÆse≈w sou, ktl. (“And you, O Lord Jesus Christ, through your becoming human and your birth”). 7-8 The Walking on the Water. Although loosely based on the text of the New Testament (Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52; John 6:16-21), the language here is different. Only the verb peripatÆsaw echoes peripat«n in the Biblical text. Instead of §p‹ t«n Ídãtvn, the Gospel parallels have §p‹ t∞w yalãsshw. In the Pradel exorcism (Gebete), p. 265, line 9f., we read ÉIhsoË XristoË, ˘w §p°bh eﬁw tØn yãlassan peripat«n, ktl.; cf. Conybeare, Rituale Armenorum, p. 392, 7f.: katÉ §ke¤nou gãr se ırk¤zv, toË peripatÆsantow …w §p‹ jhrçw §p‹ n«ta yalãsshw, ktl. The reference in the Berlin papyrus to Jesus not “defiling” his feet is not in the Bible. The genitive of “feet” here following the verb is peculiar; the sense—if this is not a simple error for pÒdaw (see above)—must be that of “having defiled (himself) in respect of his feet.” It is also possible, however, that pod«n has been influenced by Ídãtvn in the line above. 9-10 The Feeding of the 5000. Cf. Matthew 14:13-21 / Mark 6:32-44 / Luke 9:10-17 / John 6:1-15. Again, the phrase ı [§]k p°nte ért«n pentakisxi/l¤ou êndraw xortãsaw is not an exact quotation of any single New Testament verse (there is no mention of the two fish); cf. Mt. 14:19: toÁw p°nte êrtouw, ktl. (cf. 14:17); John 6:13: §k t«n p°nte êrtvn, etc. Mark 6:42’s §xortãsyhsan corresponds exactly to the wording of our text at line 10 (cf. Matt. 14:20), and Mark 6:44 (toÁw êrtouw pentakisx¤loi êndrew) comes closest to the wording of lines 9f. of the papyrus; cf. the Johannine summary at John 6:26. The whole of the preserved portion of the miracle historiola shows a loose chiastic arrangement in the first part, followed by a\n\n\n\n  ‒        parallelismus membrorum in the second (a syllabic count is provided in parentheses):  tÚn kolazÒmenon ı lÊsaw [...] ka‹ ı §japoste¤law\n\n(= 6 syll.)

An apparent variant also occurs in PGM 13.8: §l[y]°, tÚ ¶leo[w], ı yeÚw toË aﬁ«now. The use of the imperative “Lord, come!” (addressed to Jesus) is clearly eucharistic and originates in the famous “Maranatha” formula; cf. for the Eucharist, Didache 10:6. The original context of the liturgies addresses Jesus to come to the Eucharist in the form of the loaf, which becomes his body. The apparent reapplication of the formulas in the Louvre and Wien texts to healings—and in the Berlin text to exorcism— may be original to the liturgies themselves: ritual healing and exorcism were standard prerequisites for both baptism and Eucharist; see H. A. Kelly, The Devil at Baptism (Ithaca & London, 1985). §p‹ §mo¤ t“ èmartoÅl“Ä: for a similar expression in a liturgical context, cf. Delatte, Un office byzantin, p. 70, 24: moi t“ èmartvl“; Strittmatter, Exorzismusbüchlein, p. 133, 14. The line separator seems to end with an abbreviation KOI, presumably for koi(nã), an indication of where the practitioner is to insert the client’s name, here the “sinner.” Thus KOI is, in fact, to be read as a marginal abbreviation, written below t“ èmartoÅl“Ä.

PGM VII. 396-404 (a ritual requiring the inscribing of a lead curse-tablet); XLVI. 4-8 (an inscribing of a potsherd); cf. Th. Hopfner, “Ein neues yumokãtoxon. Über die sonstigen yumokãtoxa, kãtoxoi, Ípotaktikã und fimvtikã der griechischen Zauberpapyri in ihrem Verhaltnis zu den Fluchtafeln,” Arch. Or. 10 (1938), 128-148. 14f. [? éno¤ja]te moi: [? éno¤ja]te pãnta tå t¤xh ... 15 [? éno¤ja]te moi ≤ t°sarew gvn¤e, with left margins in eisthesi? The sense is obscure, unless one is to envision the opening up of spatial dimensions (walls or corners of heaven or the cosmos), by which the deity then enters through (supplying ¶lyat]e, oﬂ fim≈santew, ktl.). 15 ≤ t°sarew gvn¤e: cf. PGM 15a 8-10: tÚ f«w §k t«n tessãrvn gvni«n. 16 l°ontan / [ka‹ drãk]onta: Who are they who have hushed the lion and the serpent? Is the reference to some strong gods who have silenced the power of the constellations of Leo and Draco? (cf. the citation on line 22 below). Here, though, the reference seems to be “sympathetic” in nature. Just as dangerous animals are “silenced,” that is subjugated, so shall the practitioner’s opponents. The defeat of the adversarial pairs “lion and serpent”, who represent quintessential foes put “under foot” by God, by Jesus Christ, by Solomon, or some other saintly figure, is typical of Christian texts (cf. Pradel, Gebete, p. 288, p. 17f.; Delatte, Un office byzantin, p. 81, 8). Here, however, the plural subject argues for a more pagan origin. Although there is nothing Christian in the immediate context, the Christian material elsewhere in the formulary suggests that the writer may have identified the adversarial foes of lion and snake as the devil himself (cf. 1 Peter 5:8; 2 Timothy 4:17; Rev. 12:9, etc.). 17 fim≈sate: cf. also PGM VII. 966; IX. 4, 9; etc. 18 [toÁw §na]nt¤o[u]w mou §n tª sÆmeron: for similar language in the papyri, see Suppl.

One expects,\n\n\n\n  ‒        perhaps, a form of ¶rxomai (viz. ¶rxetai [ai = e], “he comes” / “he will come”; or, [pro]s≥°rxetai?), although the singular belies the sense of the context, which addresses a plurality of walls, corners, and theriomorphic silencers. The text may simply be corrupt (read ¶rxete for ¶rxeye ?). Other less likely possibilities include ¶rxatai (from ¶rgv, here “to hinder; prevent” [?], an unexpected poetic verb), or some corrupt form of §rgãzomai (cf. §rg«mai in P. Cair. Zen. 107.4, *§rgçta , indicating that the spell works?) \n\nFragmentary Hymn. The fragmentary section preserves portions of a hymnic invocation, although any trimeters or trochaic tetrameters are difficult, if not impossible to identify. The invocation, coupled as it is with the seeming astrological elements that proceed it, points to a practitioner who may be invoking the presence of the constellation of Draco. The invocation, then, may be part of an aÎtoptow or sÊstasiw, as we have in PGM IV. 930-1114—spells that invoke the very presence of powerful stellar, or light-bearing, deities (see Comm. below). 20-21 t≥r°xousa tÚn é°ra ... éstrodoËxe ÙreodrÅÒÄ[me] (the last syllable of this word may, indeed, be part of the lacuna in the next line): cf. PGM III. 255/257: oÈrodrÒme ... §ly¢ ... éerodrÒme PÊyie Paiãn (= Hymn 12, in dactylic hexameters, Preisendanz-Henrichs, II, p. 247). The hapax éstrodoËxe is supposedly an attempt at rendering éstro + oËxow (¶xein), for which perhaps *ésteroËxe might have been more feasible (a euphonic delta does not seem morphologically tenable here); more likely, it is corrupt. No such form exists, although magic hymns do preserve examples such as tartaroËxe (voc.) in PGM IV. 2242, etc. ( = Hymn 17, iambic trimeters, idem, p. 250); cf. further, d&doËxe in Hymn 20.32 (idem, p. 257 = PGM IV. 2522-2567), etc.; éllhloËxe in Hymn 22.3 (idem, p. 261), etc. Our texts ÙreodrÅÒÄ(me) may be a corruption of éerodrÒme; however, it should be pointed out that ÙreidrÒmow is a special Dionysiac epithet (cf. Eurip. Bacch. 985), and in Bacch. 1018, 1019 Dionysus is urged to appear (fãnhyi) in the form of bull, dragon (drãkvn), or lion (references courtesy Professor Michael Shaw). 22 §ly° mo¤ drãkon: cf. PGM IV. 2786, for §ly° mo¤ in dactylic meter (= Preisendanz, Hymn 18). In the example of PGM IV. 930-1114, the hymn invokes serpent and lion (drãkvn ... l°vn, line 939) in a context that suggests that the power of Draco and Leo are being called upon. For the invocation of the constellation of the Bear\n\n   \n\n\n\n(Ursa Minor) with its pole-star (Polaris), cf. PGM IV. 1275-1322; 1331-49; VII. 687-702; for the power of Zizaubio of the Pleiades, cf. PGM VII. 829. If drãkon is the subject of the feminine tr°xousa in line 20, it too would have to be feminine (drãkaina, “shedragon”; cf. l°aina, fem. of l°vn). But such distinctions in the animal-kingdom are morphologically inconsistent in Greek (cf. ı/ ≤ kÊvn; ı/≤ ·ppow, etc.), since it is often difficult to differentiate gender in animals.  Spell to Capture a Thief. The formulary of Suppl. Mag. II. 86 ( = P. Oxy. LVI. 3835) is concerned exclusively with this genre, to which the editors compare PGM V. 70-95, 172-212 (see below); III. 479-494; GriffithThompson, Demotic Magical Papyrus, III. 29 (translation in Betz, GMPT, p. 200); Bell-Nock-Thompson, “Magical Texts from a Bilingual Papyrus,” 244, col. vi ( = Betz, GMPT. p. 288f.). All the examples in Suppl. Mag. II. 86 deal with methods to detect a thief (ı kl°caw / tÚn kl°pthn). 23-24 KLOUDA ı lab∆n mØ katape›n: see the Commentary below on line 29. The syntax of this phrase and several of the others in the lines below make no sense; they may be corrupt, or the fault may rest in our own readings which must, at best, remain tentative. Assuming a cursive Vorlage, KLOUDA would appear to be a corruption of KLASMA. Eucharistic overtones in this text are unmistakable; cf. Mark 6:43; 8:8, 19f. (and Synoptic parallels), where, however, this noun is reserved for the Feeding Miracles. In the Didache 7.3 (19), the rubric Per‹ d¢ toË klãsmat≥ow describes rituals of the Eucharist, in which context Jesus is addressed toË paidÒw sou (see line 4, above). 24 ˜ti ırk¤zv Ímçw, ktl.: On the use of the adjuration, see Kotansky, “Remnants of a Liturgical Exorcism,” pp. 145-147; Kotansky, “Greek Exorcistic Amulets,” in Marvin Meyer & Paul Mirecki, edd. Ancient Magic & Ritual Power (Religions in the Graeco-Roman World, 129 Leiden; E. J. Brill, 1995), 243-277. In the thief spell of PGM V. 70-95 we find a similar adjuration, but of “holy” names: §jork¤zv se katå t«n èg¤vn Ùnomãtvn, ktl. (l. 175). 25-26 erikissh : aea : arara/xarara, ktl.: this is a slight corruption of the Erikisithphê-logos, a famous palindrome; cf. Suppl. Mag. II, p. 19, on 54.1 (Commentary, with references); further, 55 A. 1-19; 57.1631, 39, etc. Here the formulary appears to provide only the first half of the palindrome (corrected: erhkisiyfharaxararahfyisikhre), with the added note tracew, evidently some (corrupt?)\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nform of tr°pv (Dor. trãpv), “turn (it) back / around”, the sense being that the palindrome is to be “run back” in the other direction. Despite this, there seems to be a series of indiscernible traces following the traces. 27 iv pataynaj iv épotr≈gon: The usual logos is something like, iv Erbhy iv Pakerbhy iv Bolxoshy iv Pataynaj iv Apomc, or some such sequence (PGM XII. 370-371, 445-452, 459-462, 466468; cf. Suppl. Mag. II. 95. 8-12, with add. refs.). Probably haplography with apotrvgon—a meaningful Greek word—caused Apomc to drop out. On this logos, see Paul Moraux, Une Défixion Judicaire au Musée d’Istanbul (Académie Royale de Belgique, Classe des Lettres et des Sciences Morales et Politiques. Mémoires 54/2; Bruxelles: Palais des Académies, 1960). tã≥dÉ ßto≥im≥ a (sc. prokeim°na ?): The sense and reading are obscure; accordingly, the interpretation must remain tentative. Does the phrase refer to “preparations” that are being “nibbled”, or does it stand alone as some kind of incipit? If the following phrase in line 28 begins a new spell, however, then tã≥dÉ ßto≥i m≥ a will end with line 27, despite the fact that there is no dividing line. Even if this is related to the preceding épotr≈gon, the context is uncertain. A ritual to detect a thief, like that of PGM V. 172-212 (esp. 181 + 211), seems to underlie the context as a whole (see discussion to follow). 28 tÚn kl°ptonta≥ pnig›n{e} (leg. pnige›n). The modest indentation suggests a title, “To choke a thief.” The topos of “throttling” or grabbing the thief by the throat occurs in the thief formula of PGM V. 172-212 (vide infra), esp. lines 192-196: “I call upon Hermes, finder of thieves, (etc .) ... to grab the thief’s throat (§pikrat∞sai tØn toË fvrÚw katãposin), and make him manifest this very day, this very hour!” The reading of pnige›n looks rather like a case of the scribe having first written pnig›n, to which an epsilon was added in an attempt to emend the text as pnigÅeÄ›n (viz. pnige›n). What occurred instead was that the epsilon got copied at the end of the word, creating the distortion * pniginÅeÄ (which eventually corrupted to the simple pnigine of our MS). tØn »rãnhn (leg. oÈrãnhn): This rare term for “chamberpot” (= ém¤w) is unexpected. The noun is found only in Aeschylus, Frag. 42C 486a 2, 7; Sophocles, Frag. 565.1 (ap. Athenaeus, Deipnosoph. 1.30.7,12; cf. Eustathius, Od. 2.156.11, 13), of the “foul-smelling chamber pot” (tØn kãkosmon oÈrãnhn). One has to believe, therefore, that the original composer of our formulary has gleaned his reference from an anthology of Greek tragedians, or has read Athenaeus. Why a chamber pot would be singled out as an object\n\n   \n\n\n\nof theft is not clearly understood. The use of the present participle with tØn oÈrãnhn to identify the thief suggests a “generic” act of stealing: “the man who steals the chamber pot,” as if it were a common occurrence in late antique households. 29 mØ kata...grh tÚn értãturon (l. értÒturon): the syntactical context and reference to the food item (cf. also the possible “nibbling” in épotr≈gon = épotr≈gvn) is obscure, due to the lacunary nature of the text. Clearly some detail has been omitted. One may suggest, possibly, mØ katafã≥ ≥ g{r}˙, contrasting katapine›n in 23f., but this is far from certain. Remarkably, the only other apparent reference in ancient literature to this “bread and cheese” foodstuff occurs in another formula, also to apprehend a thief (PGM V. 172-212), esp. line 181 (lÒgow toË értotÊrou). In this “bread / cheese” formula, the thief is to be pointed out (tÚn kl°pthn §mfan∞ poi∞sai, l. 185f. and “handed over” (parãdow f«rÉ, ˘n zht«, l. 210; cf. also lines 192-196, cited above). This is eventually enacted by means of a ritual involving the bread-cheese: “If any one of them does not eat (mØ katap¤˙ tÚ doy°n) what is given him, this one is the thief (ı kl°caw).” This suggests a context of diners, probably slaves, who would have been familiar to the victimized owner rather than unknown housebreakers who have run far away with the stolen goods. It is probable then that mØ katafã≥ ≥ g{r}˙ (?) tÚn értãturon, in a manner similar to the spell of PGM V, identifies the thief who does not eat the bread-and-cheese. In line 23f. of this spell, the phrase klãsma (?!) ı lab∆n, mØ katape›n might, somehow, refer to the same method of detection. On the whole “bread/cheese” ritual, cf. P. de Labriolle, “Artyrotyritae,” RAC 1 (1950) 718-20. 30 ≥dh bÄ taxÅÁÄ bÄ: cf. Suppl.Mag. II. 92.18, with refs.  Spell for an Erection (?). The interpretation of the spell, overall, is uncertain. The reading would tend to confirm a spell for an erection, although the mention of a house is odd (see below, line 31). The same sort of brief sexual recipes (part of the genre of Pa¤gnia, “Jocular Recipes”) are preserved in PGM VII. 167-185; Suppl. Mag. II. 83 (cf. II. 91); II. 76, the latter of which contains rather a spell to relax an erection (with reference to Aristophanes, Thesm. 1187b [cod. R], in the participle, épecvlhm°now). 31 cv≥ ≥ l∞w, ktl.: Again, an unusual genitive as a rubric, “for an erect penis” (?). The original reading of the text here by Bill Brashear seems rather certain, despite the difficulties that follow. The genre of text is commonplace (cf. Suppl. Mag. II. 96.61, p. 249, with\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nreferences). With the mention of a house being sprinkled (below), on the other hand, one may expect, rather, a spell to dispel “fleas” (cÊlla / cÊllon), as suggested by David Jordan, who draws attention (per litteras) to the use of Delphinium Staphisagria as an insecticide in Mediterranean climates (M. Blamey & c. Grey-Wilson, Mediterranean Wild Flowers [London, 1993), p. 57, no. 261; O. Polunen, Flowers of Europe [Oxford, 1967], p. 99). 32 rJãn≥aw ... oﬁk¤an: Is one to read here tØn oﬁk¤an mikrã≥n, tÒpon, ktl. or tØn oﬁk¤an, mikrÚ≥n tÒpon, ktl.? The papyrus seems to read mikrãn rather clearly, but “little house” (euphemism for penis?) is not attested (this would necessitate the emendation tØn oﬁk¤an mikrãn). Assuming that “a little (mikrÒn) place” is to be read, it is still one’s house that is to be sprinkled. (The former reference would assume a reference to the “dribbling” or dripping of the liquid onto the penis itself, here called a “little house”, an interpretation difficult, at best). Then, presumably, an area on the penis would to be left unsprinkled by the mixture. More likely, however, is that mikrãn / -Òn goes with tÒpon: “and having sprinkled your house, leave a little place not sprinkled ...” (making a restoration, e.g., ¢≥p≥[ ‹ c]v≥ [l]ª≥ unlikely). On sprinkling, cf. Suppl. Mag. II. 97.2 (p. 261), with references.  “A Sacred Stele”. For the title, cf. Suppl. Mag. I 23.11 (èg¤a stÆlh, with a depiction); 45.18; II 60.1. In Suppl. Mag. I, p. 65 (Comm. on 23.11), the editors distinguish two types of “stele” in the magic papyri: 1) a drawing (with or without writing); and 2) an inscribed charm. ¶rde ka‹ proskÊl[ison: the first word is poetic and unexpected here. For sacrificial rituals in magic, cf. Suppl. Mag. II. 100, although the general sense may be merely to “do” or “perform” a rite. Proskul¤[son, an inevitable reading, is sufficiently rare, despite its appearance in the Gospels (Matt. 27:60; Mark 15:46; Luke 23:53 [vario lectio]; cf. Aristophanes, Vesp. 202; Polyaenus 2.31.3), to suggest the specific appropriation of poetic terms in this papyrus text. This, curiously, brings us full circle again to the possibility of ÙxleÊv in line 1.\n\nTWO PAPYRI WITH FORMULAE FOR DIVINATION D J Here I discuss two papyri, each with a formula for divination, whose published texts, in my view, admit of improvements.1 1. “Great Isis the Lady” (Pl. 1) Provenance: Oxyrhynchos.

Take 29 leaves of a male palm, and inscribe on each of the leaves the names of the gods; then after a prayer lift them up two by two, and read that which is left at the last, and you will find wherein your omen consists, and you will obtain an illuminating answer.”\n\nThe text invites a few comments. 1. “Great is the Lady Isis.” All translators but Hopfner (“Die große Isis, die Herrscherin”), follow the ed.pr., which had no comment here. Milligan cited as a parallel “a stock phrase of Artemis-worship” at Acts 19.28, megãlh ≤ (om. ≤ D*pc) ÖArtemiw ÉEfes¤vn, and Preisendanz referred to this phrase and to a discussion by Peterson, who, after several not particularly relevant examples of acclamations of the type EÈtux«w to›w numf¤oiw, states, without argumentation, that “wenn das Zauberbüchlein P. Oxyrh. VI 886 ... also anhebt: megãlh âIsiw ≤ kur¤a, so haben wir hier eine akklamatorische ... Eingangsformel vor uns.” In the majority text of the New Testament, however, we may note that the position of megãlh is predicative position, while in the papyrus it is attributive; the New Testament phrase is not a perfectly useful parallel. One should understand the line as Hopfner does: “Great Isis the Lady.” The papyrus phrase occurs elsewhere, though, in a graffito on the Monte della Giustizia in Rome (Brizio, Anon. 1873:36), eÂw ZeÁw Sãrapiw / megãlh âIsiw ≤ kur¤a. Its “One Zeus Sarapis” does seem to be an acclamation: at the end of an invocation of the Sun at PGM IV 1596-715, the operant, if successful, is to utter the phrase (cf. the obscure Poublikian°, eÂw ZeÁw Sãrapiw, §l°hson, IG XIV 2413.3, on a gold amulet from Rome). Whether or not, properly speaking, the second line of the graffito is also an acclamation, “Great Isis the Lady,” at least in the papyrus, is certainly the title of the recipe: it is set off from the rest of the text by a blank area, and it stands in ecthesis. It may be compared with the title GraËw ÉApollvn¤ou Tuan°vw Íphret¤w of the spell that makes up PGM XIa: like the old assistant of Apollonios of Tyana, Isis was a magician, and below in the Oxyrhynchos papyrus (7-10) we learn that the magical operation is one from which she actually benefitted.\n\n     \n\n\n\n5.-6. As the printed text of the ed.pr. suggests and as the photograph shows, the letters ky are written somewhat to the right of the rest of the line and are no doubt a later note, perhaps a gloss, by our scribe or another. In other words, the original sense must have been independent of the two letters. What remains, ı d¢ trÒpow §st‹n tå per[‹] / tå grãmmata, is not very smooth Greek and does not explain the operation, which uses 2n (katå dÊo dÊo) + 1 leaves, each inscribed with presumably one letter—in other words, it uses an odd number of letters. (That there are 29 letters suggests the Coptic alphabet, as Hopfner noted, offering as examples a = anoup or amoun, b = bysa, etc.) The Greek adjective that expresses “an odd number of” is perittÒw: cf. Arist. Inc Anim. 708b6ff. ˜sa d¢ polÊpodã §stin, oÂon aﬂ skolÒpendrai, toÊtoiw dunatÚn m¢n ka‹ épÚ peritt«n pod«n pore¤an g¤nesyai, kayãper fa¤netai poioÊmena ka‹ nËn, ên tiw aÈt«n ßna phr≈s˙ t«n pod«n, “Polypods, however, like the Centipede, can indeed make\n\nprogress on an odd number of limbs, as may be seen by the experiment of wounding one of their limbs” (transl. A.S.L. Farquharson, my emphasis). Restore and translate: ı d¢ trÒpow §st‹n tå per[it]/tå grãmmata—kyÄ, “The method is the odd number of letters (i.e. 29).” 7.-10. The smooth paraphrase of diÉ œn ı ÑErm∞w k¢ ≤ âIsiw zhtoËsa •aut∞w tÚn édelfÚn k¢ êndra ÖO≥sirein in the ed.pr. disguises the fact that certainly one verb and possibly two have disappeared. Better: “through which Hermes and Isis, searching, her own brother and husband Osiris.” is Hopfner’s suggestion, loc.cit. 10.-14. Ed.pr.: “The vestiges following m suit e better than a. m°[n is not very satisfactory, and §pikaloËmai constantly occurs in magical formulae of this character ...; but to read §pikaloËme (= §pikaloËmai) here makes the change to the second person singular in l. 13 very difficult.” I have not found elsewhere in the magical papyri the imperative §pikaloË “invoke.” If we assume that after 7-10 a bit more is missing, the difficulty is easily resolved: «§pikaloËme (for -mai) ... yeoÁw pãntaw»—per‹ œn y°liw klhdonisy∞nai, “ ‘I invoke the Sun and all the gods in the deep’—about whatever you wish to receive an omen.” Abbreviations of words related to lÒgow being frequent in the magical papyri we may wonder if the model of our text had such an abbreviation (e.g. ^e for l°ge), which was misunderstood and then ignored. 16. Something may have dropped out of the Greek here as well, for obviously only one divine name, not tå t«n ye«(n) ÙnÒmata, is to be written on each leaf.\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nRevised text: P.Oxy.

On the other hand, Preisendanz considered as conjectural his own §pikaloËma¤ se and g∞ ÍpopÒdion for Powell’s §p‹ kax≥u≥mm°t˙ in 5 and g∞ tÚ pÒdion in 14, but he would have\n\n     \n\nPlate 1\n\n\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nPlate 2\n\n     \n\n\n\nseen in the photograph that both phrases stand on the papyrus; and he probably would have easily seen that there is no room in 23 for both agela!to! and his conjectured pragmato! and that the lengths of some of the supplements that he proposed for the lacunae are impossible. Even though he read ≤ d¢ g∞ tÚ pÒdion in 14, Powell noted that the phrase was similar to one in a passage at LXX Isaiah 66.1; with the correct reading ÍpopÒdion, we see that we in fact have in 12-13 and 14 direct quotations from Isaiah: OÏtvw l°gei kÊriow: ÑO oÈranÒw moi yrÒnow, ≤ d¢ g∞ ÍpopÒdion t«n pod«n mou “thus says the Lord: ‘for me heaven is a throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet.’” The Christian proto-martyr Stephen quotes the sentence in his defence before the council at Jerusalem (Acts 7.49), and to presumably less learned audiences Jesus could allude to it, both in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5.4), in which he says, “do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is God’s throne, nor by earth, for it is a footstool for his feet (mÆte §n t“ oÈran“, ˜ti yrÒnow §st‹n toË YeoË, mÆte §n tª gª, ˜ti ÍpopÒdiÒn §stin t«n pod«n aÈtoË),” and in the “Whited Sepulcher” sermon (23.22), “he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God.” Somewhat intrusive in this imagery from Isaiah is the kvmastÆrion “dancing-floor” of 13. In Egypt—and I have found the word nowhere else—it was a place for the village kvmasta¤ to welcome the coming of an Egyptian god. In three passages in the magical papyri, we find that the Almighty has an “eternal dancing-floor” (é°nnaon k.: PGM XII 252, XIII 774, XXI 10), and, in three other passages, that “heaven became his dancing-floor (⁄ oÈranÚw §g°neto k.: IV 1628, XII 183, an unpublished formulary), but our text is, so far, unique in placing the dancingfloor simply in the “air.” Something has obviously gone wrong. In XII, as part of the invocation that includes mention of the “eternal dancing-floor,” we find, among the attributes of the Almighty, oÈranÚw m¢n kefalÆ, aﬁyØr d¢ s«ma, g∞ pÒdew. This phrase, I would hazard, may be the source of the mistake; presumably the composer or the copyist of the model of our text began with the quotation from Isaiah and then, under the influence of the phrase “heaven the head, air the body,” etc., inserted a word for air (his a‡yra); may he have then realized that “body” (s«ma) has no natural place between “throne” and “footstool,” and supplied a word that begins with a similar sound (kvmastÆrion), familiar from celestial imagery? For the voces magicae that immediately follow the reference to God’s footstool I have no parallels that would allow restorations,2 but the 2 We may wonder whether the syllables yomara/arabrv may have some connection with the frequentie found yvbarrabau, which R.D. Koansky (1994) would interpret as Hebrew phrase that came to be used as a vox magica.\n\n\n\n  ‒       \n\nspace available in the lacuna in 17 suggests that Isaiah may have been the source there too. At LXX Isaiah 6.1-3 we read: “... and I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and the house was full of his glory. And the seraphim stood around him.... And they cried out one to another and said “Holy holy holy, lord of hosts, all the earth is full of thy glory (ëgiow ëgiow ëgiow kÊriow Sabavy, plÆrhw pçsa ≤ g∞ t∞w dÒjhw sou).” As a restoration êgie, [ëgie, ëgie] is virtually inevitable,3 and there is room in the lacuna for the expected full triad, ép°rate, / ép°rat[e, ép°rate], even though, as far as I know, no religious or magical text is yet quotable with this latter phrase. Almost equally rare is the éstroy°ta of 18, the noun being found elsewhere only in an Orphic hymn (64.2). As for 19-20, the little that is preserved of Preisendanz’ p[ur¤]p[noe in 19 invites agnosticism, the photograph shows that there is no room for the restoration [vr, xruso] later in the line, and the preserved traces rule out the p°di[le ye°] of 20. Having rejected Powell’s ke]xrhmãtis≥/mai in favor of his own xrhmãtis[on.’] / ka¤ in 20-21, Preisendanz, in his app.crit., wonders how to fit eÎdhlon into the construction. The invocation runs in fact from 5 until the long punctuating mark at the end of 23; it includes the claim that “I have requested” (reading ke]xrhmãtis≥/mai with Powell), “without fear or trembling, a clear oracle” (eÎdhlon xrhsmÒn rather than the editors’ e. xrhmatie›). In this he can take some pride, for he has calmly addressed the Almighty, “before whom the demons tremble, whom the mountains fear.” The silent speaker is to add, as part of the invocation, the subject of his inquiry (per‹ toË d∞na proãgmatow for de›na prãgm.); we find other silent or whispered incantations at PGM IV 475, 1271-73 (see Kapsomenakis 1938:58), LXX 23 (see Jordan, forthcoming), and LXXVII 3-4. The gravity or gloom of the silent speaker is, however, a ghost. The papyrus has a misspelling that I have not seen before, proãgmatow for prãgmatow, but the transcription is unavoidable: there is no ég°lastow.
