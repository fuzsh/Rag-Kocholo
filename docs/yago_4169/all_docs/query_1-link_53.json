Jeff Astley, Stephen Barton, Sarah Boss, Thomas Hummel, Michael Ipgrave, Penny Minney, Peter Robinson, Walter Moberly, and Clare Stancliffe read and commented on one or more chapters, while David Fuller and Ann Loades gave detailed attention to the work in its entirety. Both of them did much to widen my horizons. As the narratives of two women, Mary Magdalene and the Mother of Jesus, ﬁgure prominently in what follows, I am particularly grateful to Ann for the care she took to try to ensure that, in my eagerness to make the nature of their discipleship equally available to both sexes, I did not discount the importance of feminist issues. As the work was reaching its completion, I was fortunate in being invited to give a week's course of lectures and seminars at the Free University in Amsterdam. I am most grateful for the stimulus provided by Henk Vroom, Aard van Egmond and the students who participated. The following week I spent as a guest of the Redemptorists in Poland. To the outsider the Reformed church in the Netherlands and the Catholic church in Poland can appear to have little in common. It was a particular pleasure therefore to ﬁnd myself learning from both. Integral to the discussion that follows is my belief that disciple- ship is made possible only by community. So, while in no way discounting the inﬂuence on me of other individuals, not least the example of my mother, Catherine, I must also thank God for my present context, set as I am in the worshipping community of Durham Cathedral. Joint posts are not the current fashion, but personally I regard myself as singularly fortunate in being both a professor in such a university as Durham and a residentiary canon of the city's splendid Romanesque cathedral. What is required of lecture and sermon is of course quite different. Nonetheless, the measurement of one against the other does generate a rich and\n\nvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nlively internal dialogue that I have found hugely beneﬁcial to my own life of discipleship and prayer. Some of the theses in this book and its predecessor have already percolated into sermons and prayers. Encouraging comments from members of the cathedral's various congregations have played no small part in pursuing what at times seemed a daunting task to its completion.

In its predecessor, Tradition and Imagination, I worked on a rather larger canvass.1 Current debates between modernism and postmodernism, the signiﬁcance of other religions, the function of myth in the classical world, and changing attitudes to revelation, all played their part in shaping how I suggested we perceive the relation between the Bible and the Church's subsequent history. So far from setting them in opposition to one another, I argued that a developing tradition needed to be seen as the motor that kept both engines running, and thus granted the Church the potential to respond effectively to changing social conditions. Revelatory insights were thus by no means to be conﬁned to the canonical dispensation, but instead God must be seen as continuing to speak equally across the subsequent two millennia. This was not intended to suggest inevitable progress. There is no escaping the admission that, from the perspective of the later community, both Bible and Church can alike be seen at times to err. Not infrequently, it will be insights from the biblical period that provide the most effective critique of what comes later. That aspect, however, has received little mention here, not because I deem the matter unimportant but because it is already a well-worn theme in the writings of numerous theologians. Instead, I have chosen to focus on the less familiar implication, the ability of the developing tradition to modify and sometimes even ‘correct’ its biblical roots. Because Christianity lays claim to an historical revelation, the temptation is to suppose that only what is ﬁrmly grounded in its historical past could be relevant or true, whereas it is precisely the contention of this volume and its predecessor that,\n\n1\n\nOxford: Oxford University Press, 1999.\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwhile it remains important to identify what the original perspectives were, trajectories have been opened up which have the inherent power to turn back upon the tradition from which they come and force a new reading of its implications. In Tradition and Imagination detailed consideration was given to some examples from the patriarchal narratives in the Old Testament and from the life of Christ in the New, and in particular due note was taken of how this brought about changes in Christian doctrine and self- understanding. Here our focus will be subtly different. Although doctrinal issues will still sometimes be allowed to emerge, our main concern will now be with how such change affects the practice of Christian discipleship. To that end, this volume is divided into three parts. The opening chapter of Part One uses changing attitudes to the status of women as a mean of focusing the question. I argue that relating neither to Christ as human example nor Christ as Lord is best mediated through the New Testament alone. Chapter 2 then ﬁnds conﬁrmation of this from the history of Christianity in some of the factors that help explain the rise of the cult of the saints, as also, more recently, in some of the uses to which the novel has been put. The third chapter of this part of the work then considers how these discoveries relate to the social dimension of discipleship, and argues that, so far from the notion of the communion of saints in heaven being an optional extra, it must be seen as integral to Christianity's conceptual frame, if adequate sense is to be made of the social shaping of human discipleship. If Part One was concerned with the general structure of discipleship as imitation and relationship within a community, Part Two then tackles the speciﬁcs of change by considering in some detail two key types of transformation that have occurred over the centuries, attitudes to suffering, and to family and sexuality, as these have been mediated through the Book of Job and the cult of the Virgin Mary respectively. In both cases, I shall be concerned to illustrate how the Church has much to learn from what happened at almost all the various stages in the story of these developments. So my argument is certainly not that all that matters is where we have now reached, but equally it is important to insist that, while Scripture is entitled to the ﬁrst word, it is not necessarily to be given the last. That kind of verdict does, of course, raise acute questions about\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nauthority and truth. So, although the relevance of the latter issue in particular is noted throughout this work, detailed attention is given to both questions in Part Three. While Chapter 3 speaks of the unity of the community in heaven, Chapter 6 addresses the Church's present reality but, so far from ﬁnding its divisions a subject for inevitable condemnation, argues that conﬂict is integral to the growth of the community's self-understanding. Heresy is thus indispensable to the growth of orthodoxy, and so, though the ultimate aim should still be a common mind, there remains danger in supposing any issue completely resolved or closed. That might seem to make all religious truth provisional, and in one sense it clearly does, but no more so, I think, than what happens with scientiﬁc or historical truth. What I regard as the more fundamental issue of types of truth is addressed in the ﬁnal chapter, in particular the question of how truth can be said to attach to the non-historical or ﬁctional. Early chapters will have already amply demonstrated the indispensable role of ﬁction, as the lives of Christ and of his saints were rewritten or redrawn to ensure continuing imaginative engagement. Since such later versions cannot possibly provide one-to-one mapping onto any factual reality, the temptation is to suppose that they can therefore mediate, if truth at all, only an inferior form, but, the ﬁnal chapter will suggest, so far is this from being so, ﬁction can sometimes embody the greater and more profound truth. It is thus the imagination that best preserves the continuing tradition's grasp on divine reality and our subjective appropriation of it in our own discipleship. No bibliography is provided. Instead, complete bibliographical details are to be found at the ﬁrst mention within any chapter of the particular work concerned.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPart One Appropriating Christ for the Present In the earlier volume I sought to draw attention to two implications of the way in which I believe modern historical research now requires us to regard the life of Jesus.2 The ﬁrst concerned the radical nature of the kenosis that took place in the incarnation. God in entering into the human condition did not exempt himself from the normal rules of historical conditioning that apply to us all, and so the signiﬁcance of Jesus' life for us today lies not in him standing apart from the particular culture and assumptions into which he was born but in bringing them to the fullest and best expression that that particular context allowed. Then, secondly, precisely because later contexts have often been very different, what was then initiated was not the appropriation of an unchanging past but its development as new contexts made possible the building of fresh insights upon those initial foundations. The process had begun with Paul's different attitude to the Law, but continued well beyond the closure of the canon in numerous ways, not least in attitudes to art, as the chapter on ‘Art as revelation’ sought to illustrate. Not only was the incarnation seen as legitimating the violation of the second commandment forbidding images of the divine, that violation eventually made possible a much deeper sense of God's identiﬁcation with us in all our humanness, especially in our suffering. In establishing a connection with this volume, one of my main contentions in Tradition and Imagination needs to be put bluntly and starkly: were Christ only a ﬁgure in the history of ﬁrst-century Palestine, then much, if not most, of what was later developed in\n\n2\n\nTradition and Imagination, ch. 6 for ﬁrst implication, passim for second.\n\n6\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nhis name would have been permanently incomprehensible to him. The only way that conclusion can be resisted is if one believes, as I do, that Christ was very much more, and in particular with his resurrection and ascension now enjoys a humanity in heaven that is available to every age and time. Ironically, sometimes a pre-critical age perceived the truth of this observation more clearly than our own day. So, for instance, the modern funeral service of the Church of England opens with the priest declaring: ‘Jesus said, I am the resurrection, and I am the life.’ By contrast, the Book of Common Prayer offers us: ‘I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord.’ Therein lies considerable irony, in that almost certainly the modern version records an historical falsehood, whereas the Prayer Book provides, to my mind, a profound truth: that, though Jesus made no such speciﬁc claim in his own lifetime, it is indeed precisely through him that we can discover eternal life and of that fact he himself is now fully aware in his continuing present existence.3 Yet, whether we think of Christians living prior or subsequent to critical readings of the New Testament, appeals to the now resurrected Christ can hardly be expected to solve all the problems generated by later contexts quite different from that of the historical Jesus, central though Christ's resurrection is to Christian self- understanding. The problem is twofold. First, we do not have deﬁnitive, independent access to the mind of Christ as it now is, and so the question of continuity with that original life has still constantly to be raised, and some answer given. That is where the whole issue of trajectories and their subsequent modiﬁcation raises itself. In the three chapters that follow a number of trajectories will therefore be identiﬁed, and their status ascertained. Life would have been much simpler had every biblical trajectory been allowed to follow its natural path to a conclusion, but what in fact we ﬁnd is some doing so, while others are either modiﬁed or radically undermined by the impact of new perspectives given by fresh cultural contexts; not that these contexts achieve automatic priority over the biblical witness, but they can require alterations, both\n\n3\n\nFuneral Service in Alternative Service Book of 1980; Order for the Burial of the Dead in Book of Common Prayer of 1662. The modern service has treated the original scriptural text more literally, by using the same past tense as the original narrative: John 11: 25.\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\n7\n\nsmall and large, as the pronouncements of Scripture are seen in a new light. As subsequent chapters will illustrate, this can come about as a result of quite a wide range of different factors: sometimes, for instance, because of new empirical data (Chapter 1); at other times, the drawing out of implications from Scripture that turn back on the text to cast doubt on some of the Bible's other emphases (Chapter 3). There is no simple pattern, and that is why close attention to the details of my argument is required. But, secondly and more directly relevant to the question of discipleship, there is also the issue of what it means to relate to Christ in our own quite different context, no longer the world of ﬁrst-century Judaism. Chapter 1, ‘Prostituting and valuing women’, indicates the nature of that problem by linking two apparently unrelated issues—modern attempts to establish the equality of the sexes from Scripture and attacks on the later Church's use of the composite ﬁgure of a penitent Mary Magdalene. The second half of the chapter will argue that, despite repeated assertions that her image was used only to malign women, Mary did in fact function successfully as a means of establishing any penitent disciple in intimate relation with the risen Lord. In effect, the ﬁctional elements in the way in which she was identiﬁed allowed sinners in general, both male and female, to locate themselves within the narrative of Jesus' story and so appropriate for themselves the same forgiveness and relationship. Relating to the risen Lord is one thing, however; quite another, trying to imitate the human Jesus. This is far from as simple an issue as many an exegete or preacher seems to suppose. To illustrate this, the ﬁrst half of the chapter contends that there is insufﬁcient evidence to justify treating the sexes as equal on the basis of Christ's explicit example or teaching. Rather, an underlying trajectory from that example and teaching needs ﬁrst to be identiﬁed, to explain why the Church of today might be justiﬁed in jettisoning aspects even of Jesus' own behaviour and attitudes. In the earlier volume I suggested that this is what in effect happened at an earlier stage in Christian history when Paul adopted a different attitude to law from Jesus. Here, though, it would be a matter of a post-biblical transformation. In that ﬁrst chapter I talk of two competing principles, equality of status and equality of regard, with the former reinterpreted in the light of the latter. To express matters this way helps, I believe,\n\n8\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nwith the clarity of the argument. The danger, though, is that I am interpreted as claiming that Jesus' life is only relevant in yielding general principles. That is not at all my point, and I try to indicate why meditating on the details of Christ's life still remains essential in giving shape to a life of discipleship. Even so, I do believe that the search for exact parallels is mistaken, and there is need therefore to identify a more complex type of relation between the original example and the often quite different shape its imitation will take in a different cultural milieu. Why that is so is clariﬁed in my second chapter, ‘Pattern and particular: Saint and novel’. There it is noted that, whereas in the early history of Christianity the lives of saints were made to conform as closely as possible to Christ's own actions, later history perceived the considerable problems that confronted any such methodology and so sought a more indirect correspondence, in effect one of analogy. The ﬁrst experiments with this latter type of approach, it will be suggested, are in some ﬁctional lives, such as those of Catherine of Alexandria and Margaret of Antioch. Not only shall I argue for their intrinsic importance and the truth of some of the values they contain, but also I shall indicate why in some ways they may be seen as an anticipation of the characteristic modern pattern for such exploration: through the novel. Discipleship is thus both a matter of locating ourselves within Jesus' story and acknowledging the way in which our own situation differs signiﬁcantly from his. Christian discipleship needs to be aware of these differences if it is not to make impossible demands upon the Scriptures or judge later developments by the wrong criteria. But discipleship is not simply a matter of individual relationship to Christ as Lord or even of following his example, however indirectly, wherever it might lead. It also has a strong social dimension. In contemporary theology this is pursued overwhelmingly through reﬂection on eschatology, the realization of Christ's kingdom within this world ‘at the end of the age’, and our present contribution towards that goal. While in no way decrying the importance of such reﬂections, this emphasis has in my view led to the neglect of other important elements in the history of Christianity. It is those neglected aspects that will be the focus of the ﬁnal chapter of this part of the work, ‘ Heaven and the defeat of the Beast’. Its ﬁrst half will contend that the modern tendency to deny any importance to an already existing heavenly reality\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\n9\n\npopulated with ‘saints’ (however understood) in actual fact undermines the social stress that is rightly sought elsewhere. Quite a number of arguments are offered to this effect, but, to clarify my meaning, perhaps one will sufﬁce at this stage: that it is hard to see what all this current talk of social interdependence could amount to if the present existence of Christ's humanity in heaven is itself robbed of any effective social dimension. But it is not only the present existence of the communion of saints that is adversely affected by current preoccupations, no less affected is understanding of the kind of impact exercised by the more negative aspects of traditional eschatology. It is easy to treat the doctrine of hell as a place of eternal punishment as pure aberration, but much can be learnt, in my view, from the history of its use. I shall argue that imaginative engagement in the battle to ensure that ‘the Beast’ did not triumph helped generate within the Church a powerful sense of mutual interdependence that is not reducible simply to dependence on Christ. A rich notion of community was thus an incidental result. Throughout I shall draw attention to the way in which the biblical picture was modiﬁed, and what justiﬁcation for this might be given. Such a brief résumé inevitably highlights argumentative and doctrinal themes. Although these are important, the reader should not lose sight of the wider context. My overall aim is to defend the legitimacy of changing patterns of discipleship and to draw attention to the indispensable role that the imagination has played in bringing about such changes. So far from regarding these as optional extras, they seem to me integral to the continuing health of the Christian faith. The Bible remains indispensable for Christian discipleship, but the danger is that too great a burden is placed on it. Like everything else in our world it emerged within a speciﬁc context, and that could not help but create tensions as the Church faced new situations. Although the Christian imagination came to the rescue, often its new responses were simply projected back into Scripture. The rise of biblical criticism forces us to be more honest, and face those tensions between biblical past and our own present. It is to consideration of some of these that I now turn, beginning with attitudes to women then and now.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Valuing and Prostituting Women: Equality and Mary Magdalene We begin then with consideration of what continuities and discontinuities it is important to afﬁrm or deny in respect of the history of Christian attitudes to the status of women. It is only one of a number of possible examples which might have been considered. My reason for making this choice is less its importance or topicality, greatly relevant though these are, more that it illustrates so well what I perceive to be the two most common hermeneutical faults of our own day—how both too much can be claimed for Scripture and too little for subsequent tradition. On the one hand, I shall reject the view that Scripture offers in itself an adequate treatment of how the question of the equality of the two sexes should nowadays be appropriated. On the other, I shall contend that the much maligned treatment of Mary Magdalene in later tradition, so far from denigrating women, actually offers an indispensable model for human discipleship, both male and female. What unites both questions is the exercise of the imagination, the need to acknowledge its capacity to operate with quite different agendas from our own immediate, analytic concerns. At the same time, both illustrate well how revelation operates through the particularities of our human situation, not despite them. The way in which the legend of Mary Magdalene has been treated over the centuries is the topic of the second half of the chapter. We begin, though, with the question of how Christian support for the equality of the sexes might most satisfactorily be maintained.\n\nValuing Women and Sexual Equality Here I shall argue against the view that equality of status between women and men can be justiﬁed on the basis of New Testament\n\n12\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nprecedent alone. At most what may be deduced is equality of regard, something entirely compatible with hierarchical assumptions. Biblical attitudes were in fact less advanced than pagan, and it was really only the latter's interaction with Christian views on celibacy which generated the ﬁrst major change in perspective, with a new sense of independence on the part of women. Thereafter in many ways there is regression until the changes consequent on industrial society helped to generate our own present understandings. In attributing the key impetus for change to non-biblical factors, I intend thereby no denigration of the Bible. Its authors operated within a particular set of cultural assumptions that were plausible in their own day, and it needed fresh input from the wider culture before the Bible's more basic principle of equality of regard could be given a fresh, and very different application. An unsympathetic critic might respond that, in making such a distinction between equality of status and equality of regard, I have already abandoned a biblical or imaginative frame of reference for the language and terminology of the Enlightenment. The reasons why I do not believe this to be so will be given in due course, but ﬁrst let me indicate in more general terms the signiﬁcance I see in the contrast.\n\nThe New Testament Principle: Equality of Regard Because of the dominance of concern for the status of women in contemporary culture, it is a natural, but, I believe, dangerously seductive temptation for Christians to desire to establish the direct relevance of the Bible to the issue. History then becomes rewritten as the failure of successive generations to take its message with sufﬁcient seriousness, all neatly encapsulated in Paul's famous declaration in Galatians that ‘there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus’ (Gal. 3: 28 RSV).4 But that to my mind is to make the theologian's task all too easy.\n\n4\n\nMost modern commentators still fail to give due attention to the difﬁculties behind any radical, egalitarian reading: cf. e.g. F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Galatians (Exeter: Paternoster Press, 1982), 187–91; J. D. G. Dunn, Galatians (Edinburgh: A & A Black, 1993), 205–8 . My own view has been much inﬂuenced by Johannes Munck, Paul and the Salvation of Mankind (London: SCM Press, 1959 ), esp. ch. 2, whose general approach has been followed by many scholars since.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n13\n\nConsider ﬁrst that very verse. Pulled out of context, it does of course sound as though Paul is giving an unequivocal endorsement to equality of race, class, and sex, together with all that that might imply. But, if one examines what he says elsewhere on these matters, such a contention becomes increasingly implausible. Thus in Romans 11 he leaves us in no doubt about the continued privileged position of the Jew; the Gentile wild olive shoot has been grafted on to the cultivated olive tree that is the Jew, and we are not to boast since it is not we who support the Jewish root but the Jewish root which supports us (cf. vv. 17–18). Again, so far as the speciﬁc issue of women is concerned, though much contemporary scholarship argues that neither of the two most obviously subordinationist passages in the Pauline corpus—1 Timothy 2 and 1 Corinthians 14—come from his actual hand, that still leaves 1 Corinthians 11 where Paul uses J's creation story (with the man created ﬁrst) to argue for a prioritizing of male over female, with the woman consequently required to have her head veiled in church.5 But in any case can it really be maintained that the relation of men and women was at the forefront of Paul's consciousness when not only does he fail even to mention the women witnesses to the resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15, but also in his parallel uses of a Galatians-style argument women likewise fail to reappear, though Jew and Greek, slave and free do? (1 Cor. 12: 13; Col. 3: 11) So it would seem to me certain that we must look elsewhere for the right interpretation. Perhaps the easiest way of rendering Paul consistent is to say that what he means in Galatians 3 is not that\n\n5\n\nIt is possible that Paul here is reinforcing existing Corinthian social practice (cf. Dio Cocceianus, Speeches 33.48) with religious argument, just as the leading role of women in some Pauline congregations (Acts 15: 14–15; Phil. 4: 2–3) may have no higher explanation than the more liberal attitudes that Macedonia had inherited from some of its princesses: E. Ferguson, Backgrounds of Early Christianity (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1987), 58. Although I ﬁnd them forced, more positive readings are of course possible: e.g. A. Padgett, ‘Paul on women in the church’, in Journal of the Society of New Testament Studies 20 (1984), 69–86 . Equally, there are some pointers to suggest that the original J passage carried no such negative implications: e. g. M.-S. Heister, Frauen in der biblischen Glaubensgeschichte (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1984), 135–59 , esp. 138–43. But it is hard to discount altogether the notion of inferiority implied by the taking of a part from a whole, rather than, say, an equal division of what was once a single body, as in the Greek version of the myth.\n\n14\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nChrist brings absolute equality in everything but rather, and more fundamentally, equality of access to the most important thing of all—salvation. One might compare a modern politician declaring that we are all equal as British citizens; that certainly would not carry with it any automatic commitment to equality in all respects, for instance, equality of incomes. Signiﬁcantly, both Luther and Calvin in their commentaries on the passage adopt just such an interpretation. Luther, for instance, speaks of the distinctions as ‘divinely ordained’ and then goes on to comment: ‘in the world and according to the ﬂesh there is a great difference and inequality of persons, and these must be diligently observed. For were a woman to wish to be a man . . . there should be chaotic confounding of all estates and things. In Christ, on the other hand . . . there is but one body, one spirit, one hope of vocation for all.’6 Such an interpretation would bring Paul's position more closely in line with what I think we may legitimately infer from the actions and teachings of Jesus. Here also it is all too easy to be beguiled by our desire to make Jesus say what we want him to say. Certainly, women were numbered among his followers and he had close relations with some of them, but that in itself hardly shows that he regarded them in every respect as equals of men, any more than does his openness to children or Gentiles. In my earlier volume I argued that the recognition of the value and legitimacy of a Gentile mission was almost certainly subsequent to Jesus' earthly ministry, while his remark about food given to the dogs could well be taken to indicate that he held a very similar, if not still more exalted, view of the privileged status of the Jew to what Paul offers us in Romans.7 Likewise, then, with women, we need to bear in mind that, in Jesus' selection for positions of leadership, only men are to be found among the Twelve, with consequently only men spoken of as sitting on thrones, ‘judging the twelve\n\n6\n\nMy trans. of his 1535Commentary on Galatians: Luthers Werke (Weimar edn, 1911), vol. 40.1, 542 and 544–5. Calvin likewise insists that the verse must be read in a way which does not abolish a law that God the Father has himself established: ‘il y au mesnage l'homme qui est le chef, et la femme qui luy doit estre suiete’. Quoted with the old French spellings from his Twenty-third Sermon on Galatians : Calvini Opera (Brunswick edn, 1893), 568.\n\n7\n\nMark 7: 27 for ‘the children's bread . . . thrown to dogs’; Matt. 10: 5–6 for the priority of the Jewish mission; cf. also Tradition and Imagination, ch. 6, esp. 302–13.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n15\n\ntribes of Israel’ (Matt. 19: 28; cf. Luke 22: 30). The Pauline communities are often said to have adopted a different attitude, but single verse allusions to a female ‘deacon’ and a female ‘apostle’ need to be approached with caution, since we have no precise information as to what these terms implied while any extensive description of leadership roles that we do have is always ascribed to men.8 Again, however we interpret it now, the presence of women at the tomb would not have indicated any particular importance for Jesus' ministry but merely their customary role as principal mourners.9 Yet, none of this should be taken to deny a key role to Christ in providing an example that would eventually strike the axe against the assumptions upon which such hierarchy was based. For what most certainly can be deduced from his life and teaching is what I called earlier equality of regard, as distinct from equality of status: a unique and irreplaceable value assigned to each and every human being, with everyone he encountered valued and afﬁrmed, his critics included, since reasoned argument is itself a form of afﬁrmation. As friend of ‘publicans and sinners’ he certainly valued and afﬁrmed the despised in society, but once again it needs to be emphasized that there is no necessary connection between such behaviour and insisting that they should, for instance, serve on the Sanhedrin, any more than today valuing and afﬁrming those with severe learning disabilities or the mentally disturbed carries with it any entailment about the appropriateness of regarding them as potential Members of Parliament or managers of a large industrial concern. In the latter case what makes the difference is what we believe, rightly or wrongly, the empirical facts to be and the way in which they condition possibilities.10 In a similar way, then, was\n\n8\n\nPhoebe and Junia: Romans 16: 1 and 6. At 1 Cor. 15: 9 ‘apostle’ appears to mean someone commissioned by a resurrection appearance, but it would be dangerous to infer from this verse alone that identity of function and status in other respects was thereby also envisaged.\n\n9\n\nAs in Jeremiah 9: 17–22. As we shall see later, there are difﬁculties in regarding Mary Magdalene as the ﬁrst witness to the resurrection.\n\n10\n\nOne might compare recent arguments within the English charity Mencap over whether some of those for whom they care ought also to be represented on the charity's governing body. The decision has been taken that with sufﬁcient education this is indeed both possible and appropriate.\n\n16\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nthis so in ﬁrst-century Palestine, with regard to women. Nowadays, of course, we would wish to question the nature of the ‘evidence’, but that should not blind us to the fact that it was taken seriously at the time, and not always implausibly so. Most obviously, there was simply the lack of experience of women in positions of power or with education. It is easy to believe a negative, if there is no opportunity of experiencing examples to the contrary; indeed it becomes selffulﬁlling. But added to that were, of course, further contributing factors. Unfortunately, we do not possess accounts of Jewish understandings of physiology comparable to those on offer in the classical world,11 but it is possible to infer similar assumptions. Thus J's version of the creation myth (Gen. 2: 18 ff.) surely suggests dependency of the rib on the source from which it has come, while much Jewish purity legislation seems to assume, for whatever reason, the inferiority of women. So, for example, in Leviticus 15: 16–24 menstrual impurity takes seven days to purge as against one day for comparable male pollution, and that disparity seems further accentuated in the rule that double the time was required to purge the birth of a female child as against a male. It is of course possible that such legislation was intended to emphasize the holiness of child-bearing, with the woman seen as joining in God's work of creation (Lev. 12: 1–5),12but such an explanation loses plausibility when set against so much other evidence of negative attitudes. Equally problematic is the attempt to locate an explanation in a post-exilic assertion of the priority of culture (circumcision) over nature (menstruation),13since suspicion of the latter was already widespread throughout the ancient world. Though positive attitudes are found, much more common is the notion that menstruation represents some form of\n\n11\n\nFor a good exposition of pagan understandings of female anatomy and their impact upon questions of equality, L. Dean-Jones, ‘Medicine: The Proof of Anatomy’ in E. Fantham et al.

Soskice (ed.), After Eve (London: Collins, 1990), 38–61 .\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n17\n\ninstability in the female constitution.14 Almost certainly such suspicions and the consequent fear of pollution were also a factor in the exclusion of women from the annual Jewish festivals, a phenomenon that itself led to the well-known Mishnah prayer for men which thanked God ‘for not making me a woman’. In generating such attitudes, sexual intercourse itself probably also had an inﬂuence, since it would be very easy to move from assumptions of receptivity in that sphere to a general endorsement of female passivity and inferiority.15 In noting such attitudes it has been no part of my intention to imply cultural determinism, as though this were the only way history could have gone. Though problems of adequate interpretation are complex, some early civilizations may have been more egalitarian in their attitude to the two sexes,16 while, as we shall see, it is incontestable that Jewish attitudes lagged behind those in many another ancient society. My point rather is that once a certain pattern of thought is established it can so deeply imbed\n\n14\n\nIn some Greek writing menstruation appears to have been viewed wholly positively. So, for instance, some early Hippocratic writings equated it with a return to order after the instability of virginity: H. King, ‘Bound to bleed: Artemis and Greek women’ in A. Cameron and A. Kuhrt (eds.), Images of Women in Antiquity (London: Croom Helm, 1983), 109–27. But the most common image seems to have been that of purgation, which could easily be taken to suggest a balance that has gone wrong, and indeed in some writers menstruation came to be associated with death because its absence in later life meant an end to conception and new life: J. Delaney, A Cultural History of Menstruation (New York: Dutton, 1976) ; J. Shuttle and P. Redgrove, The Wise Wound (London: Gollancz, 1978) . This is the key which Rachel Biale uses to unlock Jewish attitudes: Women and Jewish Law (New York: Schoken Books, 1984), ch. 6. Herself a Jew, she calls for a rabbinical revolution of a kind which has happened in the past: 264–5.\n\n15\n\nThus, for example, it is surely plausible to detect behind Philo's justiﬁcation for the sacriﬁcial whole-offering being male an implicit allusion to a particular view of sexual intercourse: ‘The sacriﬁce used as a whole burnt offering should be male because the male is more complete and more dominant than the female, as well as more akin to an active cause, for the female is incomplete and in subjection and more to be accounted among what is passive rather than active’ (De Specialibus Legibus I, 200 (my trans.)).\n\n16\n\nFor Spartan attitudes compared favourably with Athenian, and Etruscan with early Roman: Fantham et al., Classical World, chs. 2 and 8. The ‘evidence’ needs, however, to be read with care, as the authors in question (e.g. Plato) are often more concerned with making points against their own society. Equally, Egypt may not have been as egalitarian in this respect as is sometimes claimed: for the positive claim, J. Tydesley, Daughters of Isis (London: Penguin, 1994) .\n\n18\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nitself in a particular society, that to talk of ‘prejudice’ is in fact totally to misunderstand the extent to which its rationale now functions as internalized ‘reasons’; it has become an ingrained assumption. The paucity of evidence offered on the other side fails to convince me that either Jesus or Paul escaped from such cultural conditioning, and it seems best therefore to think of their attitude in similar terms to how we now regard some of their assumptions about the Hebrew Scriptures, as plausible in terms of the thought- forms of their own day but not requiring any endorsement on our own part.17 What Jesus indicated by his practice (and Paul endorsed) is a far more fundamental insight: that, irrespective of any empirical differences, we are all of equal value in the eyes of God, and must therefore be treated accordingly. That idea may already have been present in Old Testament times but, if so, not only is it nowhere made explicit but also there is much that runs counter to any such notion, not least attitudes to those of different cultures.18 Where the life of Jesus has a unique contribution to make is, if I may put it like this, in its character as a worked example. The Gospels portray Jesus encountering a great range of different individuals, and him valuing each in their own unique particularity without regard to their worldly standing. It was thus possible to see clearly for the ﬁrst time what such valuing might mean. But of itself that did not entail that, for instance, differences between child and adult or between centurion and criminal ceased to be relevant, but only that in principle at least such customary differences in treatment could founder, were the conventional perceived reasons for drawing the distinctions ever found to lack justiﬁcation. In my view women do themselves a great disservice whenever they insist that Jesus must have made that further inference. For it suggests to me an insight that could have been won without too much difﬁculty, whereas in fact the assumptions behind the prejudice have run deep through almost every aspect of the history of Western civilization. This in part explains why I want to resist the accusation of\n\n17\n\nNote, for instance, Paul's (to us) strange use of the Sarah/ Hagar analogy in Galatians or Jesus' appeal to Psalm 110: 1 in his arguments about the nature of the Messiah: Gal. 4: 21 ff; Mark 12: 35–7.\n\n18\n\nIt is easy to forget how seldom other peoples are valued in their own right. Even the eschatological imagery in Isaiah more often than not leaves other peoples in a ﬁrmly subordinate role, e.g. 40: 17; 60: 5–7.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n19\n\nintroducing irrelevant Enlightenment distinctions. For even Enlightenment thinkers were as deeply imbued with such assumptions about the weaker or more dependent character of women as were the rest of their contemporaries. That women are by nature less rational than men is a notion that one ﬁnds in intellectuals as otherwise varied as Bacon, Descartes, Kant, Rousseau, Hegel, and Freud.19 It is not, therefore, our reason on its own that is likely to defend us from such pitfalls. Nor is it a matter even of getting the right general principles, for ‘equality of regard’ or even love itself only gain adequate deﬁnition through careful contextualization. Notoriously, for example, both Kant and Mill alike thought that their fundamental principles were a variant on Christ's love commandment.20 Following Christ is thus not just a matter of abstracting the right principles from the narrative. It is more a matter of meditating on that life in a way that takes seriously how the particularity of Jesus' love was expressed in all its speciﬁcity. Even so, though, there seems to me nothing in and of itself in the narrative to suggest a further inference to equality of status. For that some further general shocks to the culture as a whole were required, and these were not as yet forthcoming.\n\nRevelation Interacting With Culture The full implications for women of Jesus' underlying example were thus to take centuries even to begin to reach their proper application. Even so, some progress was already being made in the more immediate post-biblical period. Tempting though it is to ascribe this exclusively to Christianity, once again caution is necessary. For the status of women in the pagan world was already in advance of Jewish understanding, and what therefore appears to have happened is that further progress was made possible by a\n\n19\n\nFor a survey and some pertinent examples, G.

That paganism was in advance of the Jewish world is well illustrated by the different attitudes to divorce and property rights. In the Jewish case divorce remained a male prerogative, and while it would probably be unfair to observe that the Hebrew for ‘husband’ literally means ‘owner’, it is true that under Old Testament law a wife had no independent property rights, and inherited nothing on her husband's death (Num. 27: 7–11).21 By contrast, in the Code of Hammurabi and in Assyrian laws the widow not only had automatic right to part of the estate, she could even regain control over her dowry.22 Some scholars have argued that early Israel had also once displayed a similar degree of liberality,23 but, while it is plausible to contend that later treatments of the issue show greater negativity, it is very hard to establish any period at which Israel was truly as positive as Assyria. Likewise, though the sexes were probably not yet segregated in the synagogues of Jesus' day and there is also clear evidence to suggest that women acted as benefactors of them, it would be rash to jump from such facts to any suggestion that women sometimes acted as their leaders,24 when we lack all evidence of any corresponding change in legal status. Though Greek and early Roman society was in many ways as oppressive as Jewish,25 by the time of Jesus signiﬁcant advances had\n\n21\n\nThough this passage does speak of the daughter inheriting, even this could only happen in the absence of any male children.

Though this estimate of the situation is exaggerated, Greece and early Rome were clearly in some ways considerably worse than ancient Israel.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n21\n\nin fact taken place in Roman law. In early Roman law, as in Greek, the wife's dowry and any other property came under the husband's full ownership, but by the late Republic this practice (cum manu) had been abandoned, the woman became the primary heir of her father, and upon his death an independent property owner. With that right also went very much greater freedom generally, partly perhaps under the impact of male absence during the protracted Second Punic War (218–202 BC), when Italy was occupied for more than ﬁfteen years;26 certainly Greeks were shocked at the results.27 Then, with the Emperor Augustus, women no longer had to await the death of their father for independence, as all mothers of three or more children were now automatically exempted from guardianship, while under one of his successors, Claudius (d. AD 54), even this limited guardianship was abolished.28 As a result it is not surprising that we ﬁnd plenty of examples in the later imperial period of women freely dispensing their own wealth in public benefactions.29 One other important point to note is that Roman, unlike Jewish, law allowed the wife to divorce her husband.30 Even so, a number of factors inhibiting equality remained, among them the fact that girls seem generally to have been much younger than their partners when they married. It was, then, into just such an environment that Christianity emerged, with pagan attitudes to women in certain important\n\n26\n\nE.

Goodman, The Ruling Class of Judaea (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 70 . Even up to modern times Orthodox Judaism has refused to allow divorce for desertion, or even the presumption of death, except on the evidence of witnesses.\n\n22\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nrespects signiﬁcantly in advance of the Jewish society from which the new religion had emerged. In seeking to determine the precise nature of its contribution, it is necessary to guard against any simplistic projection back of the assumptions most of us would hold today, for, as we saw earlier, most of the evidence seems to point in a rather different direction. Where Christianity had a marked impact was in insisting on the basis of Christ's example upon equality of regard. Even if it was only many centuries later that this was reinforced by a claim to equality of status, new possibilities were already being opened up by that underlying conviction. But it would be a mistake to suggest that Christ's example worked this change alone. For it was precisely because pagan women already enjoyed a greater degree of freedom that upon conversion to this new faith they could perceive where its doctrine of spiritual equality might lead, in generating fresh possibilities of freedom. Recently, the Christian cult of virginity in the patristic period has been plausibly reinterpreted, and it is no longer seen purely negatively as a rejection of the world, but rather as a means of signiﬁcantly advancing the freedom of women: their choices ceased to be controlled by larger family concerns.31 The case seems to me a convincing one, but it would be hard to explain the change entirely in terms of Christianity's Jewish inheritance, for that offered no signiﬁcant precedents for female monasticism. Was it not more a case of some female Gentile converts allowing their own classical culture to interact with Scripture and in consequence being seized by the promptings of the Spirit to go one stage further in terms of personal liberty for women? They already had some control over property; now they hoped for the right to determine their own spiritual formation. As a matter of fact such freedoms were eventually to be severely curtailed. Under Christian emperors divorce legislation was introduced that worked to the disadvantage of women.32 The dual\n\n31\n\nP.

Clark, Women in Late Antiquity (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), 21–7 , though she warns against interpretation in terms of an exclusively Christian motivation.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n23\n\nmonasteries that allowed for an abbess to be in overall charge were eventually to disappear, while the role of the male priesthood came to be given greater and greater prominence, with all sacramental acts eventually reserved to them and to them alone.33Again, the difﬁculty of projecting such freedoms beyond the convent is well illustrated by the opposition which was encountered by attempts to found female educational orders, most notably the Ursulines.34 Nevertheless, something did survive. Women were seen as competent as men to give spiritual advice, as relevant literature surviving from the Middle Ages clearly indicates. So at least the question could now be raised: if spiritually as competent, why not in other ways as well? It took one set of social circumstances to generate this change; it took another to produce the more radical transformation that is with us today. In pre-industrial society women were of course often expected to perform heavy agricultural work, sometimes even when pregnant. Even so, there is an important sense in which their inferiority in physical strength mattered in a way which became less and less important as industrialization advanced. In societies without a proper police force women remained dependent for everyday protection upon the men in their family, while in societies where war and brigandage were more common than they are in the modern world, again it fell exclusively to the male to exercise the necessary degree of brute force. Industrialization, however, brought in its train a number of changes, many of which could be expected to change perceptions of the role and status of women. An effect of populations congregating in towns was that the primary use of power ceased to lie exclusively with the male head of the family, while an effect of women working in factories was that they were given some perception of themselves as also wage earners, even if\n\n33\n\nLay confession continued even as late as the fourteenth century.\n\n34\n\nIf we take Jerome as illustrative of patristic attitudes to female education, he can veer between extreme suspicion (e.g. Letter 228) and very positive encouragement (e.g. Letter 107), though this must still be under a man as teacher (‘doctus vir’). Even as late as the sixteenth century, women were still being regarded as unsuitable instructors, as the initial reaction to the ﬁrst teaching order (the Ursulines) well illustrates, with even the founder's father doubting a woman's competence: M. Monica, Angela Merici and her Teaching Idea 1474–1540(New York: Longmans, Green & Co, 1927 ).\n\n24\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\ninitially the husband continued to try to exercise control. The computer revolution has in fact only accelerated a process that has been going on for several centuries, whereby the physical superiority of the male has become less relevant to the structuring of society, and so with that has gone any sense that such physical superiority is also indicative of other, more insidious forms of supposed superiority. Also relevant in bringing about new attitudes is the very quantity and speed of change in modern society, for, inevitably, it has opened eyes to the possibilities of change elsewhere, as did also the development of a cheap press and other modern forms of mass communication. The rise of female education also helped, as did increasing professionalism in medicine which, long before contraception became an issue, brought with it the realization that women could do something themselves, substantially to better their living conditions. Even with this number of factors mentioned, I hasten to add that this is unlikely to be the complete tally; historical change is immeasurably more complex.35 My point is simply that with so many other factors at work it would be naïve to claim that biblical insight was the principal medium in bringing about such change. Indeed, it is arguable that the Bible acted as a restraint, because sufﬁcient care was seldom taken to distinguish between its application to a particular cultural milieu and what might more properly be regarded as its foundational teaching. This is well illustrated by the regression which took place within the history of Christianity on the subject of women's property rights, where the Bible was used, quite plausibly, to argue for a more negative view.36 On the other side, however, must be set the key role played by some Christian women in moving society towards equality of status, conspicuous among whom were Josephine Butler and Maude Royden. Even\n\n35\n\nTo give but one other relevant factor, note the discovery of the ovum in 1826 and the resultant acknowledgement required of a more active role for the woman in shaping the identity of her children.\n\n36\n\nFor a brief outline of the various changes in English law in the latter half of the nineteenth century, see A. Loades, Searching for Lost Coins (London: SPCK, 1987), 6–7 ; for a detailed presentation of how iniquitous the previous situation was, see H. N. Mozley, ‘The Property Disabilities of a Married Woman’ in Josephine Butler (ed.), Woman's Work and Woman's Culture (London: Macmillan, 1869), 186–245 .\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n25\n\nhere, though, there is a certain irony in that it was partly the Victorian exaltation of women as preservers of the sanctity of the home which ﬁrst led many a woman beyond its conﬁnes in order to further its defence.37 Those early advocates of women's rights, like many of their twentieth-century counterparts, frequently read back into the Bible the position they wished to advocate. Some Muslim feminists are now attempting a similar task on Islam's behalf.38 Both strategies, however, seem to me misguided. To my mind the evidence is insufﬁcient to speak of the presence in either Old Testament or New of anything approaching what we would now mean by movements for sexual equality.39 Certainly, much of what followed in the later history of the two religions was much worse,40 but we do our understanding of revelation and God's action in the world a disservice if we ignore the effects of social conditioning. In the patristic period it took contact with the larger rights of women under paganism to precipitate a fresh application of Jesus' example and teaching, and it was to take the huge changes of modern times before Christians could see that this also carried with it full equality of status. The most promising analysis is to suggest that our understanding of revelation becomes deepened as the Bible interacts with each fresh social matrix and we try to draw from each such interaction a fresh account of what revelation should mean for our own day.\n\n37\n\nAs with Josephine Butler herself, over the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1864, 1866 and 1869.

Mernissi, Women and Islam (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991) .\n\n39\n\nLess well known than Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza's attempts to detect an original Jesus movement along these lines is the work of Carol Meyers in arguing for similar presuppositions in early Israel (1200–1000BC ): Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988) . My rejection of that aspect of their work is in no way intended to decry their insistence in detecting the role of women hidden behind the text.\n\n40\n\nComplementary imagery is perhaps the most insidious because of its pretence at equality. So, for example, Augustine insists that men and women possess both male and female aspects to their minds, but signiﬁcantly Christ loses the feminine aspect (scientia ) when he leaves this earth.

Power, Veiled Desire: Augustine's Writing on Women (London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1995), 131–57 , esp. 155 ff.\n\n26\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nScripture's Continuing Relevance Though in all I have said thus far there has been a consistent concern to apply the example and teaching of Christ, it may be objected that the style of discipleship implied suggests a certain distance and perhaps even some lack of engagement. The text is allowed to speak, but only in its historically conditioned original context, and thereafter greater interest is shown in contemporary society. At one level, I would reject the criticism, for it seems to me that it is only by taking the past seriously as past that we can properly allow its impact upon the present; otherwise, the danger is that we simply project on to Scripture our own present concerns. However, once that caution has been fully endorsed, I would then have no objection to using Galatians 3: 28 in its new modern sense as a ringing endorsement of the equality of the sexes, for pulled out of context it does admirably express what seems to me the legitimate implication that the Church should draw in our own day from New Testament teaching. Revelation interacting with culture has legitimated the new way of reading the text. Yet that may still sound as though all the work is being done by changes in the wider culture rather than through Scripture, but this, it seems to me, has not been true of the past, nor need it be true of the future. Consider ﬁrst the past. The New Testament may not have accorded women what we now mean by equality of status, but Jesus' example did open up the possibility of new claims for women that would in the end help with the undermining of factors alleged to legitimate subordination. Jesus' relations with Mary and Martha, for instance, were soon being used to argue for equality in religious instruction, reading, and prayer, and these could be used as springboards for wider claims.41 Again, if we turn to our modern context, the awareness of two quite different senses to the Galatians verse, instead of encouraging retreat from Scripture as a model for practice, could be used to encourage a more lively engagement in deeper awareness of the inevitable pitfalls to which all human thinking is subject. Hearing God's address to us through the Bible would then cease to be a simple ‘reading off ’ of surface\n\n41\n\nAs, for example, in double monasteries, with a female abbot over a joint community of both men and women. Apart from other examples mentioned in this chapter, more are given in the chapter on Mary, Ch. 5.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n27\n\nmeaning; instead, prayerful readiness would be required to confront the extent to which the experience of women alluded to in the text still lies hidden from our immediate understanding and so requires effort if it is to be brought to consciousness. A number of women are doing excellent work in this ﬁeld. Luise Schottroff, for instance, has done much to highlight hitherto ignored aspects of women's work experience and its impact on Jesus' parables and teaching.42 Some have carried the argument one stage further, and sought to identify a transformation in Jesus' consciousness as a result of some key experiences with women.43 Perhaps this did happen to some degree, but more plausible in my view are those feminist theologians willing to accept an ambiguous, complex history.44 It is natural to want to enrol Jesus in support of a position one endorses, but the incarnation inevitably must have involved limitations. If Jesus' attitude to privileges of race was one of them, I fail to see why gender issues might not also have been another.45 Equally, at the other extreme, it is tempting to place all the blame for what happened on men, but a resultant danger is that we end up with what one writer has labelled a ‘deadly innocence’, the inability of women to accept any form of self-critique.46 This is in no way to exempt\n\n42\n\nL.

West, Deadly Innocence: Feminism and the Mythology of Sin (London: Cassell, 1995) . She questions whether it is either true or advantageous for women to believe themselves less sinful than men, noting, for instance, the extent of female support for Hitler (30–7), as also the way in which a good image for white women in the southern United States was bought at the expense of their black sisters (38–48, esp. 41 ff.).\n\n28\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nmen from condemnation for past injustices, but it is to protest against parody and over-simplistic histories. Take the history of art. It is true that the female is often represented as temptress and thus as implicitly the real culprit, but that is by no means always so. Even where convention demanded a strongly erotic element, such as paintings of the incident of Susanna and the Elders, examples are not wanting where the male voyeurs are indisputably made the guilty party, while even with the fall there are famous examples, not least from Michelangelo, of the primary responsibility being laid at Adam's door.47 Nor is it true that women have always been trapped by the prejudices of men into debilitating forms of self-perception. Narratives from Christine de Pisan onwards provide obvious literary examples to the contrary, but so sometimes also, perhaps surprisingly, do convents. The recent discovery of a series of late medieval coloured drawings from St Walburg's near Eichstätt provides fascinating insight into women successfully deﬁning themselves apart from men even in a context often thought to be the most male dominated of them all.48 One ﬁnds women replacing the Magi, joining in prayer at Gethsemane, enjoying a eucharistic banquet with the Trinity, and even present in the very heart of Jesus.49Again, much the same point could be made of the greatest female painter of whom we are aware until modern times, Artemisia Gentileschi, working in the early seventeenth century. If the\n\n47\n\nMargaret Miles has argued that ‘in Christianity the body scorned, the naked body, is the female body’: M. R. Miles, Carnal Knowing: Female Nakedness and Religious Meaning in the Christian West (Boston, Mass.: Beacon, 1989), 185 . Paintings of Susanna are one of her artistic examples, in which even Rembrandt does not remain immune from critique: 124–5. She strengthens her general case by making extensive use of an atypical artist like Hans Baldung (seven out of thirty-one illustrations), whereas even with Susanna the distorted faces of the lewd elders in Jacob Jordaens' version is not altogether untypical: illustrated in D. Sölle, J. H. Kircheberger, H. Haag (eds.), Great Women of the Bible (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1994), 237 . On the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo's Adam reaches eagerly for the forbidden fruit, quite independently of Eve, who in fact shows more hesitation.\n\n48\n\nIn the sense of wholly dependent on male priests for Mass and confession, and also subject to their decisions as controlling external ‘Visitors’.\n\n49\n\nJ.

For Magi, 14, 56–9; for Gethsemane, 92–4; for trinitarian banquet, 140, 144–5; for heart, 102–6.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n29\n\nnature of the commissions she received from men frequently required her to paint seductive looking representations of her own sex, she did so in a way that not only preserved her own integrity but also implicitly asserted a female identity that refused to be deﬁned by the dominant male culture of her own day.50 Of Gentileschi's piety or otherwise, we have no knowledge, but matters are quite otherwise with the anonymous nuns and Michelangelo. Religious belief, context and personal experience, all combined to force, however implicitly, new ways of approaching the biblical text. One way in which that process might be expressed, and which I utilized in the earlier volume, is to speak of a trajectory from the Bible turning back on itself and requiring a new reading of the scriptural text as a whole. Not all will be happy with that way of putting things. Perhaps the most obvious advantage it provides is the stress thereby given to the new frames of references that are periodically thrown up which force upon us new ways of reading Scripture. So, for example, in Tradition and Imagination I noted the way in which the trajectory that eventually led to a full-blown doctrine of incarnation necessitated a re-examination of scriptural hostility to images, and that despite the fact that nowhere within the New Testament are Old Testament attitudes challenged. In the case before us here, particularly worthy of note is the fact that not only is a re-examination of the often hidden references to women required but also continuing reﬂection on the more basic practical principle of equality of regard. For, if the acceptance of ‘relevant’ empirical differences where there are none is one way in which things can go wrong, another and perhaps even more worrying is the supposition that empirical difference necessarily legitimates radical difference of treatment. Christ may have shared the cultural assumptions of his day, but he consistently treated women with dignity and respect. The same cannot always be said\n\n50\n\nFor a detailed analysis of her paintings, M. D. Garrard, Artemisia Gentileschi (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press, 1989) . Although occasionally her detection of a hidden agenda stretches the bounds of probability, particularly her identiﬁcation of an Isis theme in the Cleopatra paintings (244–77, esp. 266 ff.), Garrard in general establishes her case well. To my mind convincing is her suggestion that Lucretia's pose is intended to question the traditional assumption of the necessity of suicide (228 ff.), while Judith is meant to assert readiness in the face of fresh danger (278–336, esp. 315, 328).\n\n30\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nof the Church in our own day, nor that it emulates Christ where relevant empirical differences would still be widely admitted. One need only think of those with physical handicap or severe learning difﬁculties, or again of those suffering from mental illness, to see the extent of the problem. Of course, some forms of contribution may be precluded, but that hardly legitimates the slowness of the Church in ensuring some kind of access and role. Jean Vanier's L'Arche communities or the earlier experiments at the shrine of the legendary St Dympna at Gheel remain rare illustrations of a better way of doing things.51 So I would emphatically reject any contention that my argument precludes a key continuing role for reﬂection on the example of Christ. It remains pertinent in two key ways. First, as the case of those with learning difﬁculties indicates, Christ's underlying principle of equality of regard is still far from receiving universal application. Secondly, Jesus' valuing of all irrespective of empirical difference provides a salutary caution against supposing that equality of status, however legitimate and important it is in correcting biblical attitudes to women, is all that matters. In this particular case imitating the example of Jesus has become more a matter of pursuing where reﬂection on the details of his life might lead rather than literally copying his mind-set, and for that some degree of imagination is clearly required. But of itself that can hardly take us the whole way in reconceiving the relevance of Christ to the status of women, for Christianity has only ever been secondarily a religion of a book. Its engagement is primarily with the person of Christ, and it is to the question of how the historical and temporal distance which I have been so emphasizing can be overcome in respect of our relation with him that I now want to turn. Much has been written in recent years hostile to what was done in Christian history to the ﬁgure of Mary Magdalene. What, however, I would invite the reader to consider is the possibility that her story was developed and retold precisely in order that\n\n51\n\nFor the work of Jean Vanier, The Challenge of L'Arche (London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1979); Man and Woman He Made Them (London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1985) . The shrine of St Dympna near Antwerp became a great pilgrimage centre for the mentally ill. Already by the fourteenth century a system of boarding them in the local community had been established, and with the formalization of this practice in 1850 this early system of ‘care in the community’ became one of the most famous and effective in the world.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n31\n\nboth women and men might engage more effectively with their risen Lord. Imaginative closeness, not imaginative distance, will thus now be our concern.\n\nDiscipleship and Mary Magdalene In my earlier volume I was much concerned to underline the way in which the imagination has functioned in the history of religion, and within Christianity in particular, as a means of generating new insights, insights which the Christian may legitimately regard as revelation, not merely human responses but divinely motivated. Change is effected not so much by explicit logical argument as by the biblical text in effect being rewritten. Imagination builds upon history to say something rather different from what the original human authors intended. Thus in the chapter on the incarnation I argued that the later Church rightly made explicit a commitment to Christ's divinity that would not have been acknowledged at the time, while in an earlier chapter I drew attention to the various ways in which the stories of the patriarchs were modiﬁed in Islam and Judaism no less than in Christianity, in order to function more effectively for a later age. My analysis was necessarily somewhat complex, since in outlining the history of such developments I also wanted to emphasize three further points. The patriarchal narratives may be used by way of example. First, tradition does not develop in a single straight line but by exploring a range of possibilities, some of which are rightly subsequently discarded. So, for instance, the attempt to blame someone other than God for the sacriﬁce of Isaac was eventually recognized to be a false trail. Secondly, triggers for change play a crucial, if not indispensable, role. Even if unfairly ascribed to the Pharisees as a group, the way in which the model of obedient action could degenerate into selfrighteousness identiﬁes one major incentive towards the retelling of the story of Abraham in terms of faithful trust. Finally, so far as the justiﬁcation of change is concerned, we cannot escape the messiness of history. Though it is tempting to look for a single criterion, such as a christological one, change occurs against a particular backdrop, and that is essential to assessing legitimacy. Tenuous though the parallels in the life of Joseph were to what happened with Christ, they were sufﬁcient\n\n32\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nto inhibit any fruitful use of the story of Joseph within Christianity, and he became a cardboard ‘type’ or anticipation of what was to come. In this case Christology thus actually inhibited rather than encouraged reﬂection. As we shall see, all these points can be illustrated from developments in respect of the story of Mary Magdalene. Had the person responsible for the conﬂated ﬁgure not been as historically signiﬁcant a personage as Pope Gregory the Great, it is doubtful whether there would have been a sufﬁcient trigger to generate the wealth of reﬂection that was to follow. Even then, it was not without its false avenues, not least in its detours into an obsession with sexuality. Yet ironically it was precisely the presence of that feature that ensured the absence of any cardboard copy of Christ as in the treatment of Joseph, and instead generated extensive reﬂection on what it might mean to grow into identiﬁcation with Christ from something quite different. Yet so deeply entrenched is the notion that historical fact must remain the ﬁnal arbiter of truth that for many it is hard to envisage what could justify giving the greater weight to the imaginative construct. Nonetheless, that is what I wish to argue for here. For my contention is that, though what emerged was less than loyal to history, it embodied the more important truth, one which has very effectively engaged the imagination of believers over the centuries in establishing and deepening their relation with Christ and one which we will now lose at our peril: what is involved in the dialectics of discipleship, in the growth of the disciple from sin and misunderstanding through forgiveness to intimacy and empowerment. I realize in advocating such an approach I go against the great weight of contemporary opinion on the signiﬁcance of Mary's legend. That is why I ask readers to suspend judgement until they have read this particular section as a whole.\n\nThe Contemporary Context Another way of putting my present concern is to ask: is there any level of reﬂection at which an appropriate justiﬁcation can be found for the decisive stimulus Pope Gregory the Great gave towards the Western tradition's conﬂation of Mary Magdalene (the witness of the resurrection), Mary of Bethany (the sister of Martha and Lazarus), and the unnamed penitent sinner (who\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n33\n\nwashes Jesus' feet with her tears)?52 Biblical scholars have been trying to unravel that integrated ﬁgure since at least 1517 with Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples' inﬂuential essay,53 but in recent years such attempts have received powerful reinforcement from feminist theologians, who see later theology producing in Mary Magdalene negative images of woman as the great temptress while at the same time robbing her of her full and proper historical dignity as the ﬁrst disciple to be charged with preaching the good news of the resurrection. That she was an historical ﬁgure seems certain. Luke mentions her as someone from whom Jesus cast out ‘seven devils’ and who later accompanied him on his itinerant ministry; Mark, that she was one of the women who stood ‘looking on afar off ’ at the cruciﬁxion; while to John is reserved the longest reference with Christ's appearance and dialogue with her at his tomb, apparently brieﬂy alluded to also in Matthew and in the appendix to Mark's Gospel.54 The common modern view, therefore, is that we should conﬁne ourselves to this historical core, especially as otherwise we present a picture which is fundamentally deleterious to the status of women. Frequent is the complaint that later tradition not merely altered but actually perverted Mary Magdalene both as a person and in her role. In attacking that earlier tradition much is made of its unhealthy attitude to sexuality. The most recent major study, for instance, speaks of ‘wilful misrepresentation, to suit the purposes of an ascetic Church’.55 Again, a major German feminist theologian describes herself as ‘very angry’ at what the tradition has done: ‘At the expense of women, a provocative imaginary picture had been created in the patriarchal church. What is left of the great\n\n52\n\nFor Mary of Bethany as anointer, John 12:1–8; for anonymous penitent sinner as anointer, Luke 7: 37–50; neither is identiﬁed with Mary Magdalene. For Gregory's identiﬁcation, e.g. Homilies on the Gospels 2.25 (PL 76. 1188–96, esp. 1189); 2.33 (ibid., 1238–46, esp. 1239).\n\n53\n\nDe Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi disceptatio (Paris, 1517), written under the Latin version of his name, Jacobus Faber Stapulensis.\n\n54\n\nFor resurrection, John 20: 1–18 and Matt. 28: 1, 9 with Mark 16: 9; for seven demons and itinerant preaching, Luke 8: 1–3; for her presence at cruciﬁxion, Mark 15: 40.\n\n55\n\nS.

What would our tradition look like if it had made Peter a converted pimp?’56 Without doubt such charges need to be addressed. But, as I shall attempt to demonstrate shortly, they are greatly exaggerated, in large part because they fail to address the question of how the imagery in fact functioned. In the meantime, we may note how reaction against such a reading of history can generate accounts that are no less short on historical justiﬁcation. Two illustrations of this may be given. The ﬁrst and more obvious concerns the question of sexuality itself. Although some modern writers seek to retain a strong erotic component in Mary's relations with Jesus,57 it is often assumed that any mention of a sexual sin must automatically partake of the generally negative attitude to sexuality in the patristic and medieval period.58 But in fact one has to wait until the sixteenth century for the visual image to become strongly sensual, and it was to take until the nineteenth before it became an excuse for photographic pornography, with a similar development to be detected in presentations in literature and ﬁlm.59 Again, in rightly locating bad motives in the past it is no less important to acknowledge the presence of bad (as well good) reasons in the contemporary desire to extricate Mary Magdalene from such a sexual reputation. With one modern commentator the argument appears to be that, thus released, she is the superior of Peter and Paul since unlike them she committed no great wrong in either betrayal (Peter) or persecution (Paul).60A famous scholar of an earlier generation even concludes his discussion by declaring that she now emerges ‘with unblemished reputation’, having earlier argued the implausibility of the alternative case partly on the grounds that Joanna, the wife of Herod's\n\n56\n\nE.

Brill, 1993), 141 .\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n35\n\nsteward, would hardly have consented to be ‘travelling about Galilee with a notorious courtesan’.61 Such assessments are far removed from the radical inclusiveness promised by the Christian doctrine of forgiveness. The tradition, as we shall see, exalted Mary Magdalene because of a past which forgiveness had put behind her, whereas much contemporary thought seems sometimes only able to think of any such past merely pulling her down. My second example concerns the nature of the ‘demons’ which afﬂicted her. So concerned are some exegetes to avoid any of the traditional connections with sexual sin that speciﬁc alternative explanations are offered. Thus for one commentator the ‘seven demons’ refer to the sort of mental insecurity from which many of us suffer today,62 while for another the cause was in the suffocating life-style imposed on women at the time.63 But the truth surely is that we do not know. The fact that Mary Magdalene is picked out by this designation despite the fact that earlier in the same verse we had already been told that all the women who accompanied Jesus ‘had been healed of evil spirits and inﬁrmities’ does suggest that her condition was more severe than others, though not so severe as that of ‘Legion’ described later in the same chapter. None of this of course argues for sexual sin, but again can we really be quite so certain that it must be excluded?64 Guilt and/or rejection is one of the most common sources of mental breakdown, and ﬁrst-century treatment of a loose woman might well generate both guilt and rejection.65 In saying this my intention has not been to argue that the tradition was right after all, but only to observe that modern expansions are really no more secure than their earlier rivals. As one biblical scholar has wisely observed, for all we know to the contrary, she may have been ‘eighty-six, childless, and keen to mother unkempt young men’.66\n\n61\n\nF. C.

Our own age, like all its predecessors, has also its characteristic prejudices and distortions. What therefore I want to suggest in what follows is that a fresh, sympathetic look at the composite ﬁgure, so far from undermining the dignity of women, can actually add signiﬁcantly to it. Not only that, we will ﬁnd that in creating that composite ﬁgure the later Church was building on similar imaginative concerns already present within the New Testament itself. I shall proceed by two stages, examining ﬁrst the relevant biblical texts, and then the further expansions and employment of Mary's story in later church tradition.\n\nRebuilding the Tradition: The Biblical Imagination My sub-heading here will to many seem itself a misnomer, since so often is the contrast drawn between the historical factuality of the scriptural portrait and later ‘invention’. To illustrate why matters are not that simple, I want to begin with the alleged historical core of Jesus' resurrection appearance to Mary. While in no way wishing to deny that she was among those who had a resurrection appearance and that this was probably at the tomb, it does seem to me that not only are there serious historical grounds for doubting that it was the ﬁrst, but, more importantly, that to put the stress there is to distort the main point of John's narrative. John was already using the appearance for other purposes, and we shall ﬁnd that matters are not signiﬁcantly different when we turn to the anointings. Resurrection appearance Though many distinguished biblical scholars endorse the view that this was the ﬁrst resurrection appearance,67 we need to take seriously not only contrary indications, but also the weakness of some of the apparently supporting evidence. None of the Synoptics offer strong support. Luke\n\n67\n\nSo e.g. R. E. Brown, ‘Roles of women in the Fourth Gospel’, Theological Studies 36 (1975), 688–99 , esp. 692, n. 12: ‘has a good chance of being historical’.\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n37\n\nmakes no mention of the incident at all. This is particularly puzzling, for, as the evangelist most sympathetically disposed to women, one would have expected him to have recorded such a strong acknowledgement of the role of women, had he known of it.68 Again, the reference in Mark is to be found in the concluding section of the Gospel upon which there is general agreement that it does not derive directly from the original evangelist's own work, but through dependence on the other Gospels. Moreover, the verses immediately prior to Mark 16: 9 ff. seem to imply the contrary, that the ﬁrst appearances were in Galilee. That leaves us with Matthew, where the evidence also turns out to be problematic. One female scholar, commenting on the appearance to Mary Magdalene and another Mary, expresses the difﬁculties well: The subsequent appearance of Jesus cutting them off at the pass as they ran (28: 9–10) is the most difﬁcult part of the narrative and may be an addition. It adds nothing to the angel's message to go to Galilee. Moreover, it seemingly contradicts the angel, who has just told them to deliver the message that ‘you will see him in Galilee’.69 Indeed, as a piece of writing it seems somewhat crass, since it makes the greater theophany the appearance of the angel rather than that of Christ himself: unlike Jesus of whom no description is offered, the angel's ‘appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow’ (Matt. 28: 3 RSV). It looks therefore as though the evidence of John stands rather insecurely on its own, with some signiﬁcant indicators actually pulling us in the opposite direction. For on the other side must be placed not only the assumption of our earliest Gospel that the ﬁrst appearances were in Galilee but also Mary's absence from Paul's list of resurrection appearances. The common attempt to explain the latter by Jewish attitudes to female witnesses is not nearly as well founded as is often believed, while conﬁrmation of Paul's acceptance of precedence for Peter's resurrection appearance may well be indicated by Luke's quotation of what reads suspiciously like an early confessional formula to the\n\n68\n\nCf. N. M. Flanagan, ‘The position of women in the writings of St Luke’, Marianum 40 (1978), 288–304 , esp. 292–3.\n\n69\n\nC. Osiek, ‘The women at the tomb: what are they doing there?’, Ex Auditu 9 (1993), 97–107 , esp. 99.\n\n38\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nsame effect: ‘The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon’ (Luke 24: 34 RSV; cf. Mark 16: 7; 1 Cor. 15: 5).70 Then we need also to consider the narrative intentions of John himself. Modern biblical scholarship has increasingly come to recognize the degree to which reactions of Jesus' disciples towards him have been moulded in the Gospels to make theological points about our own discipleship. So, for instance, it has been suggested that the strength of the contrast between the behaviour of Jesus' disciples in the ﬁrst and in the second half of Mark's Gospel has a deliberate narrative purpose: the reader is led initially to identify with them, only to experience all the more powerfully the critique of inadequate discipleship which then follows.71 If that is so in Mark, the case would seem even stronger for John, with his introduction of the mysterious ‘beloved disciple’. Attempts continue to be made to give him a deﬁnite historic identity. Apart from the most popular candidate, the apostle John, suggestions have included Lazarus and, most recently, doubting Thomas.72 The absence of any obviously equivalent ﬁgure in the Synoptics, however, argues against historicity, but even if he were historical, we miss the point of his introduction unless we acknowledge how he functions in John's narrative which is to represent ‘the ideal follower of Jesus’.73 It is his seeing and believing at the empty tomb without needing to await a personal appearance of Christ which is intended as paradigmatic for our own discipleship (John 20: 8–9).74 By contrast, therefore, Mary Magdalene's encounter is intended (like Peter's) to be read as less than perfect. Like the beloved disciple,\n\n70\n\nThat Jewish laws of evidence could have led to her omission by Paul is challenged by Osiek, ‘Woman at the tomb’, 103–4.\n\n71\n\nR. C.

Brown, The Gospel According To John XIII–XXI (New York: Doubleday, 1970), 1005 .\n\n74\n\nContrast Mary's unbelieving response to the empty tomb at 20: 1–2. The question of how ‘seeing’ and ‘believing’ relate is an issue that runs through John's Gospel, and is among those features unique to him: J. Marsh, Saint John (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1968), 625–30 .\n\nVALUING AND PROSTITUTING WOMEN\n\n39\n\nMary shows the eagerness of love to continue in some sort of relationship with Christ, but Christ has to come further towards her before she can believe, and even then she misunderstands the nature of his presence. She tries to cling to him as though his presence were still a purely earthly one. Jesus has therefore to reprimand her (in much the same way as later he chides Thomas): ‘Touch me not’ or, more accurately, ‘Do not keep clinging’.75There was thus a good catechetical reason why the evangelist should have placed this resurrection story ﬁrst: it sets the context for the further accounts that are to follow by indicating how they are not to be appropriated. But there is also a further reason in the logic of the narrative. In Tradition and Imagination I noted that the natural development of the story as a whole requires the experience of Christ as ascended to follow more intimate and material resurrection experiences even if the historical order had been quite different. Similarly, in this particular case it would have made little narrative sense, even if appearances at the tomb had occurred later than those in Galilee, to return to the tomb for descriptions of them, since the entire narrative structure requires us to move away from the tomb and towards heaven. If we compare John with the Synoptics, we ﬁnd him elsewhere making major changes in chronology for symbolic purposes, as with the cleansing of the Temple or the precise time when Jesus was cruciﬁed (John 2: 13–23, cf. Mark 11: 15–18; John 19: 4, cf. Mark 14: 12); so it would not be out of character to ﬁnd a similar change here. In raising such doubts let me stress once more that my concern is not to deny a resurrection appearance to Mary; only to question whether we can be quite so conﬁdent, as so many modern writers apparently are, of when precisely it occurred. It could have been simultaneous with other experiences, or even subsequent to them. Where we can be more conﬁdent is that she was the ﬁrst to report the empty tomb, but even then we need to note that what interested John more was her ability to say something about our discipleship in the here and now. In contemporary society individual identity is an ultimate value, but for most of history this has not been so, and therefore we ought not to judge such adaptation of\n\n75\n\nThe former is the AV translation of John 20: 17, the latter my own attempt to bring out more forcefully the sense of the present imperative; for Thomas, 20: 29.\n\n40\n\nAPPROPRIATING CHRIST FOR THE PRESENT\n\nhistorical fact to te"
