        "text": "Abstract: The gruesome reality of horror films and the cruel reality of everyday life reside in the image; a parallel universe, which may be retained from the torrent of images of the spectacle in a hyperreal global society. The catharsis one hopes to experience when attending horror films suggests that there be an emotional and intellectual clarification of one’s everyday existence. How this is done however, appears to be contrary to the world slipping into a consumerist, technocratic global world. The purpose proposed in this paper is a notion that horror films offer a re-examination, through a catharsis, which offsets the pragmatic and materialistic ideologies of a technocratic, global world, and hence, presses for reflection of the carnage framed in not only of aspects of the objective, descriptive world, but also of aspects of one’s inner world: how to understand and value through an art form, what is happening in real life, and to believe in the intrinsically good of oneself and the greater community.\n\nThis essay rethinks previous approaches to the notorious subgenre of American horror known as “torture porn” by drawing attention to the new media technologies that regularly deliver and disseminate its abuses. Films such as James Wan’s Saw (2004), Eli Roth’s Hostel (2005), and Roland Joffé’s Captivity (2007) are frequently read as allegories for American foreign policy under George W. Bush. Central to these accounts are the sites and sights of torture that the films make visible. Though hardly wrong, these accounts overlook the relationships to bodies in pain that television, digital video, and the Internet organize for characters and spectators alike. Ultimately, I argue, torture porn has more to say about the entangled encounters these media make possible than about the various images of brutality they deliver into individual homes.\n\nThe proliferation of North American horror films in the 21st century has engendered an increase in critical and academic response which has almost exclusively focused on the conventions of mainstream horror cinema. That is, films sanctioned by classificatory bodies, released through mid to large production companies and exhibited via selected to wide theatrical releases. While academic work, drawing from film and cultural studies, has provided a much needed engagement with the popularity and themes of contemporary U.S. horror they have tended to exclude marginal or ‘hidden’ horror film examples. Therefore, working from Antonio Lázaro-Reboll’s work on the ‘archaeology of horror’ put forward in The Spanish Horror Film (2012), this paper (which is part of a monograph on the subject) will similarly seek to “reintegrate marginal filmic and cultural practices” (p.7) into 21st century U.S. horror. Within the paper an account of the aesthetic and thematic strategies of the films will be provided which will work toward supplying a definition of the term hardcore horror. A number of filmic examples will be given (such as films by Fred Vogel, Shane Ryan and Lucifer Valentine) and areas such as production, marketing, and consumption will be addressed. The importance of looking at hardcore horror is that these films operate outside of normative filmmaking practice and in doing so provide a wider examination of the cultural field of U.S. horror in terms of how it is made and experienced. The paper will hope to provide a redefinition of the boundaries of the genre within the context of contemporary U.S. horror, so that overlooked horror films and their revisions and alterations of commercial production, marketing and consumption practices can be included. In turn, this will help to better understand the interface between filmmaker and audience (and scholar), especially when it comes to cultural representations of and experience toward horror.\n\nSince its inception, the horror genre has been reflective of cultural fears. In neoliberal society, horror cinema has experienced a cultural revival that has challenged the conventional boundaries of the genre and expanded our current understandings through a convergence of neoliberalism and gothic horror with unprecedented popularity in the cultural imaginary. The conjuring universe, one of the highest grossing and most popular horror universes to date, presents a key space for cultural criminologists, like horror and film fans, to engage with the terror of the neoliberal world through mediated new gothic images, resulting in a gothic criminology. Through an ethnographic content analysis of the conjuring cinematic universe, this dissertation addresses three primary questions: 1) What emerging cultural anxieties can we discern from new patterns in horror related to demonic possession as it relates to the neoliberal era? 2) How can existing understandings of horror be elaborated in ways that extend gothic criminology? 3) What do demonic horror films teach us about criminological understandings of neoliberalism? I use the conjuring universe as a case study to analyze how neoliberal social formations have changed the face of American horror with a focus on the revival of possession. The cultural revival of gothic metonym and tropes, coupled with an explicit link to true crime genres, culminates in a neoliberal gothic criminology centered upon the tension of declining social institutions in relation to personal responsibility as a key response to neoliberal logics.\n\nThis chapter examines the ways in which horror film has become preoccupied with the part it plays within representational systems of violence. Firstly, it analyses the significance of post-millennial horror cinema in the context of new digital cultures and considers the implications of its development in relation to the increasing presence of violence in the media, particularly after 9/11. Secondly, it proposes that a number of contemporary horror films foreground the pejorative consequences of the mediated consumption of violence and thus problematise spectators’ ethical responsibilities. The chapter presents three illustrative case studies, FeardotCom (2002), The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007), and Untraceable (2008), and focuses on the contradictory viewing experiences these films propose, one of self-reflexive exploration through uneasy spectatorial complicity.\n\nAssuming a connection between violent periods and a violent pop culture, this article explores the present conjuncture of fear, horror and terror in American films and TV through comparison with matching themes in 1970s Hollywood cinema. Both the 1970s and 2000s can be categorised as“ages of fear, horror and terror”, shaped by political, social and economic crisis. Since 9/11 and the beginning of the War on Terror a new brand of explicitly violent horror movies has scored major box office hits. “Shoot ’em up”-scenarios and revenge thrillers feature prominently, as well as conspiracy and paranoia motives. In a similar way splatter horror and dark thrillers referred to the Vietnam War, political scandals and economic problems of the 1970s. Just as the then cultural products tell us: ‘There is something profoundly wrong with our world.’ Dark and nightmarish fantasies express anger and frustration about forces out of control, warlike events and estrangement between the public and elites. The conclusion is that real/reel violence and horror overlap/mirror each other.\n\nHorror’s longstanding reputation as a popular but culturally denigrated genre has been challenged by a new wave of films mixing arthouse minimalism with established genre conventions. Variously dubbed \"elevated horror\" and \"post-horror,\" films such as The Babadook, It Follows, The Witch, It Comes at Night, Get Out, The Invitation, Hereditary, Midsommar, A Ghost Story, and mother! represent an emerging nexus of taste, politics, and style that has often earned outsized acclaim from critics and populist rejection by wider audiences. Post-Horror is the first full-length study of one of the most important and divisive movements in twenty-first-century horror cinema. CASE STUDIES include: It Follows The Witch The Babadook Get Out Hereditary Midsommar Goodnight Mommy It Comes at Night The Invitation I Am the Pretty Thing that Lives in the House mother!
