        "text": "My topic is history in film. Specifically, I will conduct a critical reading of Kaneto Shindō’s Kuroneko (1968) focusing on his blending of film, history, and social commentary as a means to empower the viewer. Shindō originally started his film career with social commentaries on World War Two produced by major film companies. That social commentary was extended to a retelling of Medieval Japan in his mainly self-produced jidaigeki (films set any time before the Meiji Restoration in 1868). Shindō was in conversation with popular jidaigeki from the 50’s, such as Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950) and Inagaki’s Samurai trilogy (1954-1956). These films portray their protagonist samurai as male heroes who undergo demanding physical and mental challenges in order to live by the bushido code (which exemplifies honor, loyalty, and Buddhist piety), thereby conceptualizing Medieval Japan as a world of good vs. evil in which the virtues of Japan—as lived by the samurai—win over evil. In contrast, Shindō’s jidaigeki portray female protagonists struggling against the perverse, antagonistic samurai who are more concerned with wealth and sex than honor in a primal Medieval Japan devoid of virtue. What this vision amounts to is an alternative historical conception of Japan. Kuroneko probes the borders of the viewer’s conception of Japan’s history through the use of spectacle and narrative. Shindō constructs a radical vision of Japan’s past wherein the supernatural world, embodied in the female protagonists, collides with the mortal world of samurai to form a horrific mindscape. The blurring of history and fiction opens a discursive space that empowers the viewer to reconsider the heroism of the samurai and challenge the validity of Japan as virtuous and honorable. The broader significance of my project is how history in film, free of the limits of the non-visual historical text, can reconstruct the viewer’s conception of the historical past and reformulate the viewer’s assumption of cultural identity. My project engages with alternative forms of history given the globalization and availability of cinema—from both indie producers and production companies—and the increasing use of history in film."
