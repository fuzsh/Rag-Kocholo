The information is considered initial until it is published in our annual publications and data sets. Please contact ODOT TDS Crash Report Request Group for any questions or clarifications. This information will be updated weekly where applicable.\n\nODOT CAR Unit - Initial Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities 2024\n\nODOT CAR Unit - Initial Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities 2023\n\nInitial Fatal Crash Information Viewer - Now Available!\n\nThe CAR Unit Initial Fatal Crash Information Viewer contains initial information on fatal crashes in Oregon and is subject to change on a daily basis as more information becomes available and is evaluated. Some fatal crashes may be removed if they do not meet our reporting criteria, others may take time to get entered as there are often delays in receiving information.\n\nA higher number of crashes are reported for the 2011 data file compared to previous years. This does not reflect an increase in annual crashes. The higher numbers result from a change to an internal departmental process that allows the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit to add previously unavailable, non-fatal crash reports to the annual data file. Please be aware of this change when comparing pre-2011 crash statistics."
