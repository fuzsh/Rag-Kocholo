Hashtag Think Safe. A car follows another car with about two car links between them.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nWe usually think of stopping in terms of space, but what really matters is time. It takes about 1 and 1/2 seconds to notice a potential risk in front of you, and another 1 and 1/2 seconds to react, hit the brakes, and slow down. So you want to give yourself at least 3 seconds between the car in front of you and your vehicle.\n\nTo measure, wait for the car ahead of you to pass a set object-- tree, road sign, light pole, any clear marker will do. After it passes, start counting 1,001, 1,002, 1,003. If you reach that same object before you reach 3, you're too close.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nA warning sign appears on the diagram with arrows showing the amount of distance 1.5 seconds is in between the two moving vehicles. A second photo appears of a foot stepping on a brake pedal showing that another 1.5 seconds is needed to stop before hitting the car in front of it.\n\nOf course, this 3-second baseline is right for a car in normal driving conditions. Driving in bad weather, add one more second. Driving an SUV, add another second. If you're driving a commercial vehicle, it's got to be at least 6 seconds. So don't forget the 3-second rule, and don't forget to share the safety with your friends and family.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nA pole and a tree are shown as the two vehicles are moving to show how to count the seconds being spaced in between each vehicle. It begins to rain. Arrows appear on the screen showing the distance length of 4 seconds for bad weather. An SUV appears and arrows show the amount of distance for 5 seconds. Then a commercial vehicle appears and shows the amount of distance for 6 seconds.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
