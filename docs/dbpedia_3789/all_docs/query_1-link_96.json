However, here is a list of known distributors.\n\nExemptions\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 1)\n\nExemptions - Overview\n\nCanada's rules for transporting dangerous goods are called the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) Regulations. The TDG Regulations have 16 Parts and 3 Schedules.\n\nUnlike the regulations in the United States, which are called the 49 CFR (Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations) and only apply to hazardous materials in commerce, Canada's TDG Regulations apply to everyone. They even apply when someone transports dangerous goods such as gasoline, oxygen and propane for personal use. However, certain exemptions exist for small quantities or for specific situations. You can find most of these exemptions, which are called \"special cases\", in Part 1 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nHow does the 150 kg gross mass exemption (Section 1.15) work?\n\nThe \"150 kg gross mass exemption\" will exempt a person from most parts of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) Regulations if he/she meets all exemption conditions. It is the most commonly used exemption under the TDG Regulations. In fact, most people use this exemption without even knowing it. You use it when you bring small amounts of dangerous goods such as gasoline, propane, paint, etc. home from the place of purchase.\n\nThis exemption can only be used if the dangerous goods are available to the general public. In addition, the dangerous goods must be transported by the user/purchaser or by a retailer to or from a user/purchaser. This means that carriers, who are not the retailer, cannot use this exemption.\n\nSince you may not transport all dangerous goods under this exemption, it is important to check the restrictions in Subsection 1.15(2). It will list the products that CANNOT be transported under this exemption.\n\nBelow are some key points to remember:\n\nThe total gross mass of all dangerous goods (e.g., oxygen, propane, gasoline, etc.) must not be greater than 150 kg. \"Gross mass\" includes the weight of the means of containment (MOC) and all of its content.\n\nThe dangerous goods must be packed in MOC that weigh 30 kg or less (except for gases – see below).\n\nThe dangerous goods must be available to the general public and transported by the user/purchaser or by a retailer to or from a user/purchaser.\n\nThe MOC must be designed not to leak under normal conditions of transport.\n\nYou must not combine this exemption with:\n\nExemptions in Sections 1.16, 1.21 or 1.22; or\n\nWith a shipment of dangerous goods that requires a shipping document.\n\nFlammable gases, such as propane or acetylene, are limited to a cylinder capacity of 46L.\n\nAs with any exemption, if you cannot meet one of the specified conditions, then the exemption does not apply and you must comply with the entire TDG Regulations. This means you might need a shipping document, a label, a placard, a training certificate and/or a certified container or package, etc.\n\nWhat is a \"Limited Quantity\" and how does the exemption work (Section 1.17)?\n\nA limited quantity is a small quantity of dangerous goods to which the general public normally has access, such as aerosol sprays and small cans of paint. Since dangerous goods cannot all be shipped as limited quantities, you need to consult Column 6(a) of Schedule 1. You must not ship dangerous goods as a \"limited quantity\" when the index in Column 6(a) is \"0\".\n\nWhen shipped as limited quantities, dangerous goods are exempt from several sections of the TDG Regulations. For example, shipping documents, labels, placards, standardized packaging, etc., may be exempted if you meet all of the conditions. It is therefore important to read Section 1.17 thoroughly.\n\nWhen using this exemption, each outer means of containment (e.g., box, etc.) must have a gross mass of 30 kg or less and display one of the following international marks:\n\nImage A\n\nImage B (in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air)\n\nUntil December 31, 2020, instead of the international mark, the means of containment may display:\n\nThe words \"Limited Quantity\" or \"quantité limitée\";\n\nThe abbreviation \"Ltd. Qty.\" or \"quant. ltée\";\n\nThe words \"Consumer Commodity\" or \"bien de consommation\";\n\nThe UN number of each limited quantity of dangerous goods, preceded by the letters \"UN\", on a square on point (see example below).\n\nThe dangerous goods in the inner means of containment (e.g., a box inside another box):\n\nIf solids, have a mass that is less than or equal to the number shown in column 6(a) of Schedule 1, when that number is expressed in kilograms;\n\nIf liquids, have a volume that is less than or equal to the number shown in column 6(a) of Schedule 1, when that number is expressed in litres; or\n\nIf gases, including a gas in a liquefied form, are contained in one or more means of containment each of which has a capacity less than or equal to the number shown in column 6(a) of Schedule 1, when that number is expressed in litres.\n\nI use medical oxygen (UN1072) for personal use. What are the rules?\n\nSince the requirements change depending on the type of vehicle you intend to use, this question is divided into three parts.\n\nPersonal vehicle\n\nPassenger vehicle (e.g., bus or taxi) / passenger vessel\n\nAircraft\n\n1. Personal vehicle\n\nUnder Section 1.15 of the TDG Regulations, there is an exemption that will allow you to transport a \"gross mass\" of up to 150 kg of oxygen. The term \"gross mass\" is defined as the combined weight of the cylinder and its contents. This exemption can be used for spare cylinders that are being transported as long as the valves are in the closed position. A person requiring the oxygen during transport should use the exemption under Section 1.18\n\nTo use this exemption, the cylinder must be authorized for use in Canada.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation on cylinders purchase in the United States, please read the FAQ titled:\n\nCan I fill a cylinder (scuba, paint ball, BBQ, etc.) in Canada that I bought in the United States?\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of Section 1.15, please read the FAQ titled:\n\nHow does the 150 kg gross mass exemption (Section 1.15) work?\n\n2. Passenger vehicle (e.g., bus or taxi) / passenger vessel\n\nBefore travelling, you should notify the bus or vessel operator that you plan to transport the compressed oxygen (UN1072). Since they are private companies, they have the right to refuse your cylinders for transport.\n\n3. Aircraft 1.19\n\nRefer to Section 12.14 of the TDG Regulations for domestic flights or the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions and Part 12 of the TDG Regulations for international flights (originating or arriving in Canada).\n\nHow many jerricans of gasoline may I transport in my private vehicle?\n\nThere is an exemption titled \"150 kg Gross Mass Exemption\" that allows you to transport a gross mass of up to 150 kg of gasoline. When using this exemption, the weight of the means of containment and the gasoline may NOT exceed 30 kg. A typical 25 L jerrican of gasoline would most likely weigh less than that. If each jerrican weighed 25 kg, then you could transport up to 6 jerricans (i.e., 25 kg x 6 = 150 kg).\n\nThe \"Limited Quantities Exemption\" (Section 1.17) may allow you to transport more than 150 kg without having to comply with the entire TDG Regulations. For more details, please see the following question: What is a \"limited quantity\" and how does this exemption work (Section 1.17)?\n\nFor a more detailed explanation on the \"150 kg Gross Mass Exemption\", please consult the FAQ titled:\n\nHow does the 150 kg gross mass exemption (Section 1.15) work?\n\nHow much propane may I carry when I go camping?\n\nWe will address this question in two parts:\n\nPersonal vehicle / recreational vehicle\n\nVessel\n\n1. Personal vehicle / recreational vehicle\n\nUnder Section 1.15 of the TDG Regulations, there is an exemption that will allow you to transport a \"gross mass\" of up to 150 kg of propane. The term \"gross mass\" means the combined weight of the cylinder and its content (propane). The cylinders may NOT have a capacity larger than 46 litres. Note that a typical BBQ cylinder has a capacity of approximately 21 litres.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of this exemption, please consult the FAQ titled:\n\nHow does the 150 kg gross mass exemption (Section 1.15) work?\n\nIn a recreational vehicle (RV), any propane that is connected to the heating, ventilation, or refrigeration system of the RV, would not count towards the 150 kg limit. This exemption for the propane connected to the RV is listed under Section 1.27 of the TDG Regulations. Any additional propane cylinders that you wish to carry, and that are not connected to the RV, would be counted towards the 150 kg limit.\n\nFinally, the cylinder(s) must be authorized for use in Canada.\n\n2. Vessel\n\nBefore travelling, you should notify the vessel operator that you plan to transport propane (UN1978 or UN1075). Since they are private companies, they have the right to refuse your cylinders for transport.\n\nHow many cylinders may I carry in my vehicle?\n\nThe answer depends on:\n\nThe type(s) of gas you are transporting;\n\nThe size of each cylinder; and\n\nThe total gross mass of all the cylinders.\n\nCertain exemptions exist for small quantities or specific situations. You can find most of these exemptions in Part 1 of the TDG Regulations. Some exemptions that can be used for gases can be found under Sections 1.15 and 1.32.3.\n\nSection 1.15 allows a person to transport a gross mass of up to 150 kg of dangerous goods. To learn more, please consult the FAQ titled: \"How does the 150 kg gross mass exemption (Section 1.15) work?\"\n\nMost tradespersons (for example welders) may use the exemption under Section 1.32.3. This exemption relieves a person from shipping document and TDG training requirements. This exemption allows a person to transport up to 500 kg of the gases listed below. When using this exemption, the maximum number of cylinders is limited to five and the labels must be visible from outside the vehicle. If the cylinders are stored in a cabinet, in order to use this exemption the cabinet must have a volume of 450 L or less so that it is considered a small means of containment. The label(s), the shipping name and UN number would then need to be displayed on the cabinet so that the required dangerous goods safety marks displayed on it are visible from outside the vehicle.\n\nUN1001, ACETYLENE, DISSOLVED,\n\nUN1002, AIR, COMPRESSED,\n\nUN1006, ARGON, COMPRESSED,\n\nUN1013, CARBON DIOXIDE,\n\nUN1060, METHYLACETYLENE AND PROPADIENE MIXTURE, STABILIZED,\n\nUN1066, NITROGEN, COMPRESSED,\n\nUN1072, OXYGEN, COMPRESSED, or\n\nUN1978, PROPANE.\n\nCargo truck tanks are sometimes furnished with additional small tanks, permanently attached to the truck frame and filled with an ammonia solution (UN 2672). These small tanks are rigidly plumbed to the main tank and its purpose is to scrub hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from sour crude oil during the main tank loading. Can the ammonia solution in the scrubber tank be exempted as per Section 1.27 taking into account that the ammonia is only used to safeguard the fill-in operation and protect the environment?\n\nThe ammonia contained in the tank (scrubber) is necessary for the safe operation of the means of containment and is necessary for the safety of the people loading and unloading the crude oil. The ammonia and the tank (scrubber used to contain it are therefore exempt under Section 1.27.\n\nDoes the exemption under Section 1.25 apply to all transportation within a facility?\n\nWhen a segment of transportation is due to occur or has occurred outside the boundaries of a facility, the whole transportation must be done in compliance with the TDG Regulations, including those segments taking place within a facility.\n\nCan a police officer on travel status by air transporting ammunition or ammunition loaded in a firearm be exempt from the TDG Regulations, except Part 6 (Training) according to Subsection 12.4(2) of the TDG Regulations?\n\nYes. Since a police officer is considered on duty while he is on travel status by air.\n\nWhat is the intent of Section 1.26?\n\nThe \"Emergency Response Exemption\" applies to vehicles dedicated solely to emergency response. It does not apply to vehicles or equipment that might be used in emergency response but are also used for different purposes. Therefore, dangerous goods onboard a vehicle not exclusively used for emergencies are not exempt under Section 1.26 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen using a dangerous goods (such as ethanol or formaldehyde) to preserve a biological sample (such as a frog or an animal organ) during transportation, should the dangerous goods be exempt from the TDG Regulations?\n\nNo. Sections 1.19.1 and 1.19.2 do not apply to this situation. They apply only to samples that are believed to be dangerous goods. In this case, the sample is not a dangerous goods; it is the substance used to preserve the sample that is a dangerous goods.\n\nCan you explain the requirements of Subparagraph 1.35(a)(ii) in regards to placards or labels displayed on a means of containment that is visible from outside of the road vehicle?\n\nThe provision states that where placards cannot be displayed on all four sides of the means of containment because of its configuration (i.e., if only two or three sides are visible from outside the vehicle), placards are required only for those sides that are visible.\n\nCan I use CANUTEC's phone number when using exemption 1.39?\n\nYes, CANUTEC's number may be used as the 24-hour required by Paragraph 1.39(c) if the consignor complies with the requirements of Subsection 3.5(2), namely that to use CANUTEC's telephone number, the consignor must receive permission, in writing, from CANUTEC.\n\nClassification\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 2)\n\nWhat do the letters « N.O.S. » mean?\n\nN.O.S. means « Not Otherwise Specified ». It describes dangerous goods that do not have a specific entry by name in Schedule 1 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nFor example, both gasoline and diesel fuel are listed by name in Schedule 1. If these two substances were mixed, the resulting mixture of these two products would still be regulated as a dangerous goods. However, the mixture could no longer be described as \"gasoline\" or \"diesel\" since it would no longer have a specific name in Schedule 1 of the TDG Regulations. As such, the mixture would be classified as UN1993 - FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S.\n\nHow do I know if my product is regulated under the TDG Regulations?\n\nCheck with the manufacturer/consignor or the safety data sheet (SDS) to find out if your product is regulated.\n\nIf you are the manufacturer, you must test your product in accordance with Part 2 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhere can I get my product analyzed for classification?\n\nThe TDG Directorate keeps a list of laboratories that provide dangerous goods analysis and classification.\n\nNote: The TDG Directorate has not examined or certified any of the laboratories. As such, being on this list does not mean Transport Canada or the TDG Directorate endorse or approve their services.\n\nHow do I get my company's name on TDG's list of analysis / classification laboratories?\n\nIf you want your company's name added to TDG's list of analysis/classification laboratories, email us at tdg-tmd@tc.gc.ca.\n\nIs new motor oil classified as dangerous goods?\n\nGenerally, new motor oil isn't classified as dangerous goods since its flash point is too high. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which the liquid (oil) produces enough vapours to ignite. The TDG Regulations do not regulate flammable liquids with a flash point above 60°C. If the liquid has a flash point of 60°C or less, then the product would be classified as a flammable liquid. The lower the flash point, the more dangerous the product becomes.\n\nNote: Never assume that an oil is not regulated. Always check the safety data sheet (SDS) from the oil manufacturer.\n\nIs waste oil classified as dangerous goods?\n\nWhile dangerous to the environment, Transport Canada does not usually consider used oil or waste oil a dangerous goods unless it is contaminated by other products. This contamination could make the used oil either toxic (PCB), flammable (gasoline) or corrosive (acids).\n\nSection 2.2 of the TDG Regulations states that the shipper / manufacturer is responsible to determine the classification of the dangerous goods. In this case, the shipper /manufacturer must determine if the used oil is classified as a dangerous goods or not. One thing you can do to avoid oil from becoming a dangerous goods is to ensure that you only put used oil in the means of containment and nothing else— no gasoline, no solvent, etc. This can prevent contamination of your used oil and as a result, can be transported as non-regulated under the TDG Regulations.\n\nIf you want to ensure that your oil is not regulated, you must test a sample of the waste oil. You may ship small samples under Section 1.19.1 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nFinally, shipments of used motor oil may be subject to Environment and Climate Change Canada regulations and provincial regulations. To learn more, visit the Environment and Climate Change Canada website.\n\nCan I use a UN number that is not included in the TDG Regulations?\n\nYes. Subsection 2.2(4) and Parts 9 and 10 of the TDG Regulations authorize you to use the classification from the:\n\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the transport of dangerous goods by air;\n\nInternational Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code for the transport of dangerous goods by vessel; or\n\nCode of Federal Regulations (49 CFR) (U.S. Regulations) for the transportation of dangerous goods by road. Note: The NA numbers in the 49 CFR are not permitted in Canada.\n\nWho is responsible for classification?\n\nThe consignor is responsible for determining the classification of dangerous goods. For dangerous goods included in Class 1, the consignor must use the classification determined by the Department of Natural Resources in accordance with the \"Explosives Act\". For dangerous goods included in Class 7, the consignor must use the classification determined by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in accordance with the \"Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015\". For dangerous goods included in Class 6.2, the consignor may use the classification determined by Health Canada or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nThe consignor may also use the classification of the manufacturer or a previous consignor. However, the consignor is responsible for making a proof of classification available to the Minister. The consignor is also responsible for certifying that the dangerous goods are properly packaged, classified and identified (see Consignor's Certification, Section 3.6.1 or FAQ, Part 3).\n\nWhat is a proof of classification?\n\nA proof of classification is a document that the consignor must provide, upon request, to the Minister of Transport. This document may be:\n\nA test report;\n\nA lab report; or\n\nA document that explains how the dangerous goods were classified.\n\nThe proof of classification must include the following information:\n\nThe date on which the dangerous goods were classified;\n\nIf applicable, the technical name of the dangerous goods;\n\nThe classification of the dangerous goods; and\n\nIf applicable, the classification method used under Part 2 of the TDG Regulations or under Chapter 2 of the UN Recommendations.\n\nHow do I classify a product that contains methanol as the only dangerous goods?\n\nAs per Section 2.3 of the TDG Regulations, when the name of a dangerous goods is shown in Schedule 1, that name and the corresponding data for that shipping name (class, subsidiary class(es), packing group (PG)) must be used. Therefore, when methanol is the only dangerous goods in the product and it meets the criteria for Class 3, Flammable Liquids, it should be transported as UN1230, METHANOL, Class 3 (6.1), PG II. Note that PG II is the only packing group available for methanol as per Schedule 1 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nNote: Subparagraph 1.3(2)(d)(iv) of the TDG Regulations allows a person to indicate the word \"SOLUTION\" or \"MIXTURE\" and also the concentration of the solution or mixture after the shipping name, as applicable.\n\nFor any questions related to the classification of a product, contact: TC.TDGClassification-ClassificationTMD.TC@tc.gc.ca\n\nTests results for a solution containing methanol as the only dangerous goods indicate that the packing group associated with Class 3 should be III. How do I choose the proper shipping name?\n\nEven if a dilution would lead to a change in packing group (PG) from PG II to PG III for Class 3, methanol must be transported as UN1230, METHANOL, Class 3 (6.1), PG II because:\n\nThe diluted solution still meets the criteria for Class 3, Flammable Liquids, as per Paragraph 2.18(1)(a) of the TDG Regulations;\n\nSection 2.3 of the TDG Regulations specifies that, when the name of a dangerous goods is shown in Schedule 1, that name and the corresponding data for that shipping name (class, subsidiary class(es), PG) must be used; and\n\nPG II is the only packing group available for methanol as per Schedule 1 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nTherefore, despite the fact that methanol solution meets the criteria for PG III for Class 3, the classification of methanol must remain UN1230, METHANOL, Class 3 (6.1), PG II.\n\nFor any questions related to the classification of a product, contact: TC.TDGClassification-ClassificationTMD.TC@tc.gc.ca\n\nHow does Special Provision 43 apply to the classification of a substance including UN1230, METHANOL?\n\nUN1230, METHANOL is assigned to Subsidiary Class 6.1, Toxic Substances, based on human experience and not based on numerical data. As such, a person cannot remove Subsidiary Class 6.1 from its classification. As long as the substance has a flash point low enough to meet a Class 3, Flammable Liquids, then Subsidiary Class 6.1 has to be shown. Therefore, test results or calculation method cannot be used to discard the toxic subsidiary hazard of the mixture or solution.\n\nFor any questions related to the classification of a product, contact: TC.TDGClassification-ClassificationTMD.TC@tc.gc.ca\n\nHow do I classify a product that contains a mixture of methanol and another dangerous goods?\n\nScenario – Methanol mixed with a Class 8, Packing Group (PG) II dangerous goods\n\nAs per Section 2.5 of the TDG Regulations, if a substance meets the criteria for inclusion in more than one class or PG, the substance is dangerous goods and its classification is determined in the following manner:\n\nThe classes in which the dangerous goods are included are ranked in order of precedence in accordance with Section 2.8 to determine the primary class and the potential subsidiary class or classes;\n\nThe potential PG is the one with the lowest roman numeral;\n\nThe shipping name in Column 2 of Schedule 1 that most precisely describes the dangerous goods and for which the corresponding data in Columns 1, 3 and 4 are the most consistent with the primary class, the potential subsidiary class or classes and the potential PG is selected; and\n\nThe shipping name and the corresponding data in Columns 1, 3 and 4 of Schedule 1 are used as the classification of the dangerous goods\n\nFor example, a mixture containing methanol and meeting the requirements of:\n\nClass 3, PG II\n\nClass 8, PG II\n\nAs per the table of precedence of classes found in Section 2.8 of the TDG Regulations, Class 3 would be the primary class of this mixture. Furthermore, since the mixture contains methanol and meets the criteria for a Class 3, Flammable Liquids, the Subsidiary Class 6.1 must be shown. Therefore, the shipping name for this dangerous goods would be:\n\nUN3286, Flammable Liquid, Toxic, Corrosive, N.O.S. Class 3 (6.1, 8), PG II\n\nNote: UN1230, METHANOL is assigned to Class 6.1, Toxic Substances, based on human experience and not based on numerical data. As such, a person cannot remove Subsidiary Class 6.1 from its classification.\n\nFor any questions related to the classification of a product, contact: TC.TDGClassification-ClassificationTMD.TC@tc.gc.ca\n\nDocumentation / Shipping Papers / Waybill\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 3)\n\nWhere can I find a transportation of dangerous goods form?\n\nIn the TDG Regulations, this is called a \"shipping document\". Transport Canada does NOT provide shipping documents. For a sample shipping document, see our TDG Bulletin entitled: \"Shipping Documents\".\n\nThe consignor (i.e. shipper) is responsible for creating a shipping document. To transport dangerous goods in accordance with the law, the information on the shipping document must meet the requirements set out in Part 3 of the TDG Regulations. The shipping document also requires a consignor's certification as set out in Section 3.6.1.\n\nHere is a sample of a consignor's certification that you can find in Section 3.6.1:\n\n\"I hereby declare that the contents of this consignment are fully and accurately described above by the proper shipping name, are properly classified and packaged, have dangerous goods safety marks properly affixed or displayed on them, and are in all respects in proper condition for transport according to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations.\"\n\nNote: When shipping dangerous goods by air, the shipping document must have red hatchings that slant to the left or right.\n\nWhat is a consignor's certification?\n\nThe consignor's certification is a note on the shipping document confirming that the dangerous goods have been properly classified and packaged, have dangerous goods safety marks properly affixed or displayed on the means of containment, and are in proper condition for transport according to the TDG Regulations.\n\nThe certification must be made by the consignor or an individual acting on behalf of the consignor, and his or her name must appear on the shipping document. The consignor's certification may appear on the back of the shipping document, as long as it is after the information required under Section 3.5.\n\nThe consignor's certification must be one of the five certifications proposed in Subsection 3.6.1(1).\n\nHere is a sample of a consignor's certification that you can find in Section 3.6.1:\n\n\"I hereby declare that the contents of this consignment are fully and accurately described above by the proper shipping name, are properly classified and packaged, have dangerous goods safety marks properly affixed or displayed on them, and are in all respects in proper condition for transport according to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations.\"\n\nAre the words \"Residue – Last Contained\" optional? How can a person display them on a shipping document?\n\nThe words \"Residue – Last Contained\" are optional. As stated in Subsection 3.5(4), if conditions are met, you have the option of either using the words \"Residue – Last Contained\" before or after the description of the dangerous goods or indicating the quantity of dangerous goods as per Paragraph 3.5(1)(d).\n\nBelow is an example on how a person could display the words \"Residue – Last Contained\" on a shipping document:\n\nUN # Shipping name Class Packing Group Quantity Residue – Last Contained UN1203 Gasoline 3 II 7500L X\n\nOn a shipping document, what unit of measure must be used to express the quantity of dangerous goods being transported?\n\nParagraph 3.5(1)(d) of the TDG Regulations requires that the unit of measure must be one that is included in the International System of Units (SI) or a unit of measure acceptable for use under the SI system..\n\nNote: For dangerous goods included in Class 1, Explosives, the quantity must be expressed in net explosives quantity or, for explosives with UN numbers subject to Special Provision 85 or 86, in number of articles or net explosives quantity.\n\nRegarding single trip deliveries of petroleum crude oil from well site to battery, can one shipping document identifying numerous shipments from well site to battery be left with the consignee at the end of the day?\n\nSubsection 3.2(6) requires the carrier to provide the consignee with a copy of « a document » (not the shipping document) identifying the dangerous goods for every shipment. This document can be of any type and as such, a waybill would be acceptable. The TDG Regulations also allows electronic documents. Therefore, an email would be acceptable AND the document could be delivered before the dangerous goods are delivered to the person.\n\nWhen the person in charge of the train prepares a consist and later finds out that it is incorrect or incomplete prior to the departure of the train, must the person prepare a new consist or can he just indicate the required changes to the train crew?\n\nSection 3.3 requires that a consist be prepared by the person in charge of the train and given to a member of the train crew. The information on the consist must be kept up to date by the train crew and kept with the shipping document. This requirement applies when the train leaves the yard and therefore the information included on the consist must accurately correspond to the dangerous goods included in the railway vehicles, as specified in Subsection 3.3(2). Therefore, if the person in charge of the train finds out before the departure of the train that the consist is incomplete or incorrect, the person must ensure a new consist is prepared and given to a member of the train crew before the train leaves the yard.\n\nIs it permitted to have an ERAP reference number and activation telephone number on a shipping document when there are no dangerous goods that require an ERAP on the document?\n\nA shipping document must contain the required information as set out in the TDG Regulations for the particular dangerous goods to which it relates. However, it may also contain any other information the consignor wishes, as long as the required information is easy to identify on the shipping document. Therefore, if the shipping document contains the required information, the remainder of the information - including a valid ERAP reference number and activation telephone number constitutes \"additional information\" and does not contravene the TDG Regulations.\n\nAre the \"technical names\" that appear in parentheses for some N.O.S. shipping names (such as UN1993 FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS, N.O.S.) considered to be part of the shipping name, or are they considered « descriptive text »? Must they be written in lower case?\n\nThe technical names are not part of the shipping name and are not considered descriptive text. The technical names are specifically mentioned on a shipping document and on a small means of containment if required by Special Provision 16. There are no set requirement in terms of upper or lowercase letters.\n\nWhat happens when the consignor and carrier are the same individual? What about retention of permanent shipping documents?\n\nIf the consignor is also the carrier, then that person must comply with both the consignor and carrier requirements of Section 3.11.\n\nLabels and Placards\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 4 – Dangerous Goods Safety Marks)\n\nWhat placards and UN numbers are required on a compartmentalized highway tank that contains both UN1202 Diesel Fuel and UN1203 Gasoline?\n\nSubsection 4.19(2) of the TDG Regulations explains when and how to display placards and UN numbers on a compartmentalized large means of containment.\n\nAs per the requirements, you must display a Class 3 placard and only the UN number for gasoline (UN1203 without the prefix ʺUNʺ), since it is the product with the lowest flash point. Gasoline has an approximate flash point of -43 °C, while diesel fuel is around 55 °C.\n\nNote: If a compartment contains UN3475, ETHANOL AND GASOLINE MIXTURE, the number \"3475\" must be displayed, in addition to the UN number (without the prefix \"UN\") of the dangerous goods with the lowest flash point on each side and each end of the compartment.\n\nCan you explain the current placarding requirements?\n\nThe placarding requirements can be found in Part 4 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nHere are the five basic steps:\n\nStep 1 – Placards on a Large Means of Containment (Section 4.15)\n\nThe basic rule for displaying placards is simple: the primary class placard for each of the dangerous goods transported in a large means of containment must be displayed on each side and each end of the means of containment, regardless of the quantity.\n\nStep 2 – Subsidiary Class Placards on a Large Means of Containment (Section 4.15.1)\n\nA subsidiary class placard is not always required. A placard indicating the subsidiary class of dangerous goods must only be displayed if:\n\nAn emergency response assistance plan (ERAP) is required; and\n\nThe dangerous goods have one of the subsidiary classes listed in Section 4.15.1.\n\nStep 3 – UN Numbers on a Large Means of Containment (Section 4.15.2)\n\nA UN number must be displayed on a large means of containment if the dangerous goods:\n\nRequire an emergency response assistance plan; or\n\nAre a liquid or a gas in direct contact with the large means of containment.\n\nStep 4 – Danger Placard - Optional (Section 4.16)\n\nDANGER placards are optional. A DANGER placard may be displayed on a large means of containment, instead of any other placard required under Section 4.15, if:\n\nThe large means of containment contains two or more dangerous goods that require different placards; and\n\nThe dangerous goods loaded into the large means of containment (i.e. vehicle, etc.) are contained in two or more small means of containment.\n\nSubsections 4.16(2) and 4.16(3) describe situations where a DANGER placard cannot be displayed. These subsections must therefore be consulted to ensure that the safety marks are compliant.\n\nStep 5 – Placarding Exemption for Dangerous Goods Having a Gross Mass of 500 kg or Less - Optional (Section 4.16.1)\n\nA placard does not need to be displayed on a road vehicle or railway vehicle if the dangerous goods have a gross mass of 500 kg or less. This exemption does not apply to the dangerous goods listed in Subsection 4.16.1(2). Here are two examples:\n\nIn the first example, a road vehicle contains 400 kg of dangerous goods. These goods are not subject to the restrictions listed in Subsection 4.16.1(2), and since the road vehicle contains 500 kg or less of dangerous goods (400 kg), we can use this exemption and not display placards.\n\nIn the second example, a road vehicle contains 2,300 kg of dangerous goods. Of this quantity, 2,000 kg are subject to one of the restrictions listed in Subsection 4.16.1(2), while 300 kg are not subject to any of the restrictions. The 2,000 kg of dangerous goods that are restricted under Subsection 4.16.1(2) require a placard since these dangerous goods can't be exempted from placarding. However, when calculating the gross mass of the load, the gross mass of the non-exempted goods (2,000 kg) must be deducted from the total (in this case 2,300 kg). The gross mass of the exempted dangerous goods is therefore 300 kg. Since the amount is less than the 500 kg limit, there is no need to display placards for these dangerous goods.\n\nIn addition to the above five steps, it is also important to consult the sections pertaining to explosives and gases (Sections 4.17 to 4.18.3).\n\nCan you explain the placarding requirements through examples?\n\nFor examples of how to placard a shipment, please review the following scenarios:\n\nWhat placard(s) and/or safety mark must be displayed for a 400 kg shipment of Methyldichlorosilane (UN1242) in drums transported by road vehicle?\n\nSince the basic placarding rule states that a placard must be displayed for each of the dangerous goods transported in a large means of containment regardless of quantity, the Class 4.3 placard must be displayed. A placard does not need to be displayed for the subsidiary classes, since an emergency response assistance plan (ERAP) is not required for this dangerous goods (which is one of the conditions required for displaying a subsidiary class placard). Also, the UN number does not need to be displayed since an ERAP is not required and it is not a liquid or a gas in direct contact with the large means of containment (road vehicle).\n\nThe DANGER placard cannot be displayed in this scenario, since we do not have two or more dangerous goods that require different placards. The \"Placarding Exemption for Dangerous Goods Having a Gross Mass of 500 kg or Less\" cannot be used either because Class 4.3 is subject to the restrictions set out in Subsection 4.16.1(2).\n\nHere is a second scenario:\n\nWhat placard(s) and/or safety mark must be displayed for 200 kg of Gasoline (UN1203) and 200 kg of Sulfuric Acid (UN1830) transported by road vehicle?\n\nClass 3 and Class 8 placards must be displayed in accordance with the basic placarding rule found in Section 4.15. No subsidiary class placard is required, since gasoline and sulfuric acid do not have subsidiary classes. No UN number is required either since these two dangerous goods do not require an ERAP and are not liquids or gases in direct contact with the large means of containment. Therefore, the first option is to display Class 3 and Class 8 placards (without a UN number).\n\nIs it possible to replace these placards with the DANGER placard? Since the means of containment contains two or more dangerous goods that require different placards and the dangerous goods are contained in two or more small means of containment, and are not subject to the restrictions listed under Subsection 4.16(2), the DANGER placard may be displayed instead of the two primary class placards. Displaying the DANGER placard is the second option.\n\nLastly, can we use the \"Placarding Exemption for Dangerous Goods Having a Gross Mass of 500 kg or Less\"? Since the total gross mass of the dangerous goods is 400 kg (less than the 500 kg limit), and the dangerous goods are not subject to any restriction listed in Subsection 4.16.1(2), the third option could be to transport the dangerous goods without any placard.\n\nIs it mandatory to display the DANGER placard (Section 4.16) or to comply with the \"Placarding Exemption for Dangerous Goods Having a Gross Mass of 500 kg or Less\"?\n\nNo. The use of the DANGER placard, as well as the placarding exemption, is optional. You may choose to comply with the basic placarding rule (Section 4.15) and display placards for each of the dangerous goods.\n\nAre placards and UN numbers required on a highway tank that only contains a residue of liquid or gas?\n\nYes. Placards and UN numbers are required even for residue liquids or gases. However, once the tank has been cleaned and purged, the placards and UN numbers must be removed.\n\nThe \"Placarding Exemption for Dangerous Goods having a Gross Mass of 500 kg or Less\" can't be used since the gross mass includes the mass of the means of containment (highway tank in this example).\n\nWhen shipping UN3373 (BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE, CATEGORY B) in accordance with Section 1.39, do I need to display the Class 6.2 label and the Category B mark?\n\nNo. While Section 1.39 exempts the consignor from Part 3 (Documentation) and Part 4 (Dangerous Goods Safety Marks), it does not exempt the consignor from Section 4.22.1, Category B Mark.\n\nSection 4.22.1 states that the Category B mark must be displayed, instead of the Class 6.2, Infectious Substances label, on a small means of containment containing infectious substances included in UN3373, BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE, CATEGORY B.\n\nSection 4.6 of the TDG Regulations states that dangerous goods safety marks must be visible, legible and displayed against a background of contrasting colour. Could you define contrasting colour?\n\nA contrasting background refers to the surface immediately surrounding the placard. This surface must be large enough to create, from a distance, a perception of different colour immediately surrounding the placard, also producing a contrasting effect with the colour of the placard. There is no prescription in the TDG Regulations as to how the contrasting colour effect should be obtained, or what should be considered an effective contrast. Common sense should prevail in this matter.\n\nWhere does the subsidiary label need to be affixed on a small means of containment?\n\nSubsection 4.10(3) of the TDG Regulations states that when a subsidiary class label is required, it must be displayed on any side of the small means of containment except top or bottom. There is no requirement for both primary and subsidiary label to be on the same side. However, we do recommend, when there is sufficient space, that both primary and subsidiary class labels be on the same side.\n\nWhen dangerous goods classified as Class 2.3 are transported from the United States into Canada, the large means of containment are placarded with the poison inhalation placard as required by the 49 CFR. When these large means of containment are returned to the U.S., the TDG Regulations requires that the Class 2.3 placard be displayed. Can we display both the poison inhalation placard and the Class 2.3 placard on the large means of containment at the same time to satisfy the requirements of both 49 CFR and the TDG Regulations?\n\nYes. Both the poison inhalation placard and the Class 2.3 placard may be displayed at the same time. The poison inhalation placard is not a prescribed dangerous goods - safety mark under the TDG Regulations, but it would not be considered misleading if it was displayed on a large means of containment at the same time as a Class 2.3 placard.\n\nIs a placard with \"Drive Carefully\" or a similar message considered to be a misleading safety mark, and therefore non-compliant with the TDG Regulations?\n\nNo. Judgment must be used in such cases. It is prohibited to display, on a means of containment or a means of transport, a mark other than a dangerous goods safety mark if the other mark is likely to be confused with a dangerous goods safety mark or is misleading as to the presence or nature of any danger. To be considered misleading, the mark must be similar enough to a safety mark to be mistaken for one.\n\nNote: This scenario would be considered misleading in the United States.\n\nA road vehicle is transporting 5 cylinders of propane each properly labeled in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.10 to 4.12. The cylinders are stored in a cabinet on the back of the vehicle. If the cabinet is labeled with the proper dangerous goods safety marks so that the labels are seen from outside the vehicle, would this satisfy the requirements of Subsection 1.32.3?\n\nIf the cabinet that contains the cylinders has a volume of 450 L or less, it would be considered a small means of containment. Therefore, the label(s), the shipping name and UN number would also need to be displayed on the cabinet. If the required dangerous goods safety marks displayed on it are visible from outside the vehicle, the requirement of Paragraph 1.32.3(d) would be satisfied.\n\nWhen shipping Anhydrous Ammonia (UN1005) from the U.S. to Canada, can I display the American Class 2.2 placard?\n\nNo. We do not allow the American Class 2.2 placard in Canada to represent dangerous goods that are classified in Canada as a Class 2.3. However, one of the acceptable Canadian placards may be displayed together with the American Class 2.2 placard.\n\nIn Canada, there are two options for displaying placards for UN1005, Anhydrous Ammonia (Section 4.18.2):\n\nClass 2.3 placard and UN number UN1005 (without the prefix ʺUNʺ); or\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia placard and, on at least two sides of the means of containment, the words \"Anhydrous Ammonia, Inhalation Hazard\" or \"Ammoniac anhydre, dangereux par inhalation\" in letters:\n\nat least 6 mm wide and 100 mm high in the case of a tank car;\n\nat least 4 mm wide and 25 mm high in the case of a portable tank;\n\nat least 6 mm wide and 50 mm high in the case of all other large means of containment.\n\nNote: Since anhydrous ammonia is subject to Special Provision 23, please refer to Schedule 2 for more information.\n\nNote: In general, labels and placards from the United States are accepted in Canada by virtue of the reciprocity that exists between the two countries. However, this reciprocity does not apply to American labels and placards for dangerous goods included in Class 2.3 and Class 6.1 (Paragraph 9.1(1) (c)). For these two classes, labels and placards must be those required by the TDG Regulations.\n\nA highway tank is loaded with UN1203, Gasoline. Its next load is UN1202, Diesel. However, the pump and hoses have not been cleaned and still contain gasoline residue. Which UN number should be displayed on the trailer?\n\nOur approach has been to placard for what is on board the vehicle. If it is emptied and refilled with diesel, then UN1202 should be displayed.\n\nIs displaying the words « non-odorized » or « not odorized » on a rail tank car of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that contains an odorant considered an infraction to the TDG Regulations?\n\nDisplaying « non-odorized » or « not odorized » on rail tank cars is not misleading under the current TDG Act and Regulations as these words are not considered prescribed safety marks. Therefore, this would not be an offence, even if the rail tank car does contain odorized product.\n\nCan a forward facing placard be positioned at a 45 degree angle on a truck trailer?\n\nNo. Subsection 4.15 (1) of the TDG Regulations states that the placards must be displayed on each side and on each end of the large means of containment. Therefore, the display of a placard on a truck trailer in a 45 degree angle (see image) would be considered a non-compliance. Section 4.6 specifies that a placard must be visible.\n\nDisplay of a placard in a 45 degree angle is considered a non-compliance.\n\nIf a road train or combination vehicle (multiple trailers being pulled by one truck) is carrying dangerous goods, is it required to reproduce a dangerous goods placard at the rear of the last trailer if the last trailer does not contain dangerous goods?\n\nNo. When dangerous goods are placed in a road train, such as A, B or C train trailers, placards must only be displayed on all 4 sides of the trailer that contains the dangerous goods. Displaying a placard on the rear trailer would be considered misleading as to the presence of dangerous goods if it does not contain dangerous goods.\n\nWhen a dangerous goods is subject to Section 4.23 or Special Provision (SP) 106 of the TDG Regulations and is transported in a large means of containment, can I display the required wording on a method of display that is shaped like a placard?\n\nTransport Canada finds it acceptable to display the wording required under Section 4.23 or SP 106 using a method of display that is shaped like a placard, provided the minimum letter size is complied with. The method of display that is shaped like a placard must be affixed in addition to the placard(s) required by Part 4 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nNote that you must not display the required wording on a dangerous goods safety mark found in the appendix of Part 4 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nContainer manufacture, selection and use (highway tanks, cylinders, drums, etc.)\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 5 – Means of Containment)\n\nWhat rules apply to mobile IBCs commonly referred as slip tanks or tidy tanks?\n\nAs per Part 5 of the TDG Regulations, UN standardized mobile IBC (or an equivalent specification) commonly referred to as \"slip tanks\" or \"tidy tanks\" must be selected and used in accordance with the CAN/CGSB-43.146 standard. There are certain times when a UN standardized mobile IBC is NOT required. For example:\n\n1) SLIP TANK FOR DIESEL ONLY (450 L limit – Section 1.33)\n\nA tank with a capacity of 450 L or less does not need to comply with a safety standard listed in Part 5 of the TDG Regulations if it only contains diesel. You will find this exemption under Section 1.33 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nNote: You may NOT use this exemption to transport gasoline.\n\nAlso, when using this exemption:\n\nYou do NOT need a shipping document (Part 3);\n\nThe tank or the truck does NOT need labels or placards (Part 4); and\n\nYou do NOT need training certificate (Part 6).\n\n2) SLIP TANK FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL (2000 L limit – Section 1.35)\n\nYou will find another exemption for slip tanks under Section 1.35. This exemption states that when you are transporting gasoline or diesel:\n\nYou do NOT need a shipping document (Part 3);\n\nYou do NOT need to display a UN number on the tank (Part 4) (Note: A label or placard must still be displayed); and\n\nYou do NOT need a training certificate (Part 6).\n\nYou are NOT exempt from Part 5 (Means of containment). This means that:\n\nThe slip tank (i.e., mobile IBC) must be a UN standardized mobile IBC or an equivalent specification permitted by the CAN/CGSB-43.146 standard;\n\nThe tank is subject to periodic leak tests and inspections by a facility registered with Transport Canada; and\n\nThe tank(s) is/are limited to a total maximum combined capacity of 2000 L.\n\nHow much diesel / gasoline may I carry in a mobile IBC, commonly referred as slip tanks or tidy tanks?\n\nThe answer depends on whether you plan on using an exemption under Section 1.33 or 1.35 of the TDG Regulations. For a more detailed explanation of these sections, please read the FAQ titled: \"What rules apply to mobile IBCs commonly referred as slip tanks or tidy tanks?\"\n\nIf you do not want to use any of these exemptions, there is a limit of 3000L per mobile IBC transporting gasoline and a limit of 5000L per mobile IBC transporting diesel. This means that:\n\nYou will need a shipping document for the dangerous goods in the IBC ;\n\nYou must be trained and hold a valid training certificate as set out in Part 6 of the TDG Regulations;\n\nThe IBC must be a UN standardized mobile IBC or an equivalent specification permitted by the CAN/CGSB-43.146 standard and must be within its prescribed period of use; and\n\nThe IBC has been leak tested and inspected by a facility registered with Transport Canada.\n\nDo I need double-walled mobile IBCs (i.e., slip tanks or tidy tanks) to carry diesel / gasoline?\n\nNo. There are no Transport Canada requirements that currently exist for using \"double- walled\" IBC for transporting products such as diesel fuel, fuel oil or gasoline.\n\nEven though it may seem safer to use a double- walled IBC to contain leaks, the inter-wall space of double-walled IBC might collect contaminants and moisture that can accelerate corrosion. Also, these IBC make it harder for inspectors to detect corrosion between the IBC walls. Conducting effective and adequate periodic inspections of mobile IBC, and leakproofness tests when possible, is key to preventing leaks and other failures. Since double-walled IBC are more likely to corrode and are more difficult to inspect, they may be less reliable over the long term.\n\nWhere can I buy a certified means of containment (cylinder/ highway tank / drum / intermediate bulk container or IBC)?\n\nClick here to search our database of facilities registered with Transport Canada in your area.\n\nCan I fill a cylinder in Canada that I purchased in the United States?\n\nYes, but only if the cylinder is authorized for use in Canada.\n\nIs a « cluster pack » of cylinders itself a means of containment or is it a number of means of containment permanently connected together?\n\nAt first glance, permanently manifolded cylinders in a cluster pack would seem equivalent to a compartmentalized tank that is a single means of containment with sections within it. However, each cylinder is a self-contained unit that can exist apart from the others while the compartments in a tank are integral to the tank. On this basis, the TDG Directorate believes that a « cluster pack » of cylinders is NOT a single means of containment.\n\nAre propane tanks on paving equipment required to comply with Section 5.10 of the TDG Regulations when transported on the highway and used on highway paving jobs?\n\nThe propane tanks must comply with Section 5.10 of the TDG Regulations. However, if the propane tanks are required for heating units that are necessary to maintain environmental conditions, then Section 1.27 might apply.\n\nSpecial Requirement (SR) 45 in the CSA B622-14 standard indicates that TC 331 and TC 51 tanks shall have a Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP) greater than or equal to 1725 kPa, gauge (250 psi). However, 250 psi converts to 1723.69 kPa. Should a person use 250 psi or 1725 kPa as the minimal MAWP under SR 45?\n\n250 psi should be used as the minimal MAWP under SR 45. As a result, Transport Canada considers a tank with a MAWP value between 1723.69 kPa and 1725 kPa compliant with the CSA B622-14 standard. When it was originally converted, the kPa value was rounded. The standards will be revised to ensure consistency in values that are shown in different units of measure.\n\nTraining\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 6)\n\nWhen do I need training?\n\nYou should always assume you need training. The only time training is NOT required is when you are using an exemption (i.e., special case). You will find most exemptions in Part 1 of the TDG Regulations. You will find some other exemptions listed in Schedule 2 (Special Provisions) of the TDG Regulations that may exempt you from the training requirements.\n\nOnce a person is trained, who issues the training certificate?\n\nIt is the employer's responsibility to issue a training certificate once his/her employee has received adequate training.\n\nIs there a standard format for the training certificate?\n\nNo. Even though there is no standard format, the certificate must contain all of the information required by Section 6.3 of the TDG Regulations. You will find a sample of a training certificate in our TDG Bulletin titled: TDG Training.\n\nAre training certificates transferable from one company to another?\n\nNo. Training certificates are NOT transferable. Once an employee has been adequately trained, it's the responsibility of his/her employer to issue the training certificate. If an individual works for more than one company at the same time, the person should have more than one training certificates.\n\nI'm a self-employed contractor. Who issues my training certificate?\n\nA self-employed person will issue his/her own training certificate. The purpose of the training certificate is to demonstrate that if someone handles, offers for transport or transports dangerous goods, he/she is trained to fulfill his/her duties.\n\nDo you have a list of organizations that offer TDG training?\n\nA list of organizations that offer general and specialized TDG training can be found at http://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/saf-sec-sur/3/train-form/search-eng.aspx\n\nThe TDG Directorate has not examined or certified any of the courses offered and the inclusion of this information does not imply endorsement or approval by Transport Canada or the TDG Directorate.\n\nHow do I add my company to the list of organizations that provide TDG Training?\n\nIf you wish to have your company's name added to the list of organizations that provide TDG training, please use our online form to submit your information.\n\nCan the employer's signature on the training certificate be mechanically printed?\n\nA mechanically printed signature, a scanned signature or any other signature mark produced by the employer is recognized as satisfactory, according to Paragraph 6.3(3)(a) of the TDG Regulations.\n\nParagraphs 6.1(1)(a) and 6.1(1)(b) refer to untrained personnel working in the presence of someone who is trained. Is it acceptable to have untrained personnel doing the work and being watched by a trained person via an on-line camera?\n\nAn untrained person must be working in the presence of and under the direct supervision of a trained person. The TDG Regulations does not allow supervision to take place via an on-line camera. The trained person must be physically with the untrained person for the notion of « in the presence of » to be complied with.\n\nIs there any reciprocity regarding a valid training document issued to a U.S. driver transporting dangerous goods on a road vehicle in Canada?\n\nYes. Subsection 6.4 (1) of the TDG Regulations states that if a valid document was issued to a driver of a road vehicle indicating that the driver is trained in accordance with Sections 172.700 to 172.704 of the 49 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), it is recognized as a valid training certificate as required in Part 6 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nHow does the U.S. training document differ from the Canadian training certificate?\n\nIn the U.S., drivers transporting HazMat (dangerous goods) in quantities that require placards must successfully complete a state-level exam required by Section 383.93 of the 49 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations). The state will then add a HazMat endorsement to their Commercial Driver's Licence.\n\nIn Canada, Canadian drivers are not required to have a HazMat endorsement on their driver's licence when transporting dangerous goods.\n\nWhat is considered a valid training document according to the Canada-U.S. reciprocity agreement?\n\nTransport Canada recognizes:\n\nThe HazMat (dangerous goods) endorsement of the Commercial Driver's Licence;\n\nA copy of the certification stipulated in Section 172.704 (d) (5) of the 49 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations); or\n\nA TDG training certificate issued under Part 6 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nIt is important to note that the U.S. Department of Transportation–Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will accept a Canadian driver's TDG training certificate in lieu of a HazMat endorsement.\n\nEmergency Response Assistance Plan (ERAP)\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 7)\n\nDoes the person who answers the telephone need to be able to provide technical information about the product being transported?\n\nThe person who answers the telephone must be able to provide technical information to the caller, or be able to find someone who can provide the required information quickly. Placing the caller on hold in order to contact a third person who would have the proper technical information is acceptable. However, hanging up the phone to call someone else or asking the caller to call a different number would NOT be acceptable.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 8)\n\nWhat is considered an undeclared or misdeclared dangerous goods?\n\nAs per Section 8.14 of the TDG Regulations, a dangerous goods is considered undeclared or misdeclared when it is:\n\nNot accompanied by the documentation or dangerous goods marks prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization Technical Instructions; and\n\nDiscovered at an aerodrome, an air cargo facility, or on board an aircraft.\n\nA dangerous goods has been incorrectly labeled or incorrectly identified on a shipping document and the air operator/carrier has not accepted to transport it. Is an undeclared or misdeclared dangerous goods report required?\n\nNo. An undeclared or misdeclared dangerous goods report must not be made when the package has not been accepted by the air operator/carrier.\n\nA dangerous goods is found to be incorrectly labeled or incorrectly identified on a shipping document after it was accepted for transport by the air operator/carrier. Is an undeclared or misdeclared dangerous goods report required?\n\nYes. An undeclared or misdeclared dangerous goods report must be made after the package has been accepted by the air operator/carrier and is discovered at:\n\nAn aerodrome;\n\nAn air cargo facility; or\n\nOn board an aircraft.\n\nWhat are the types of reports that could be required under Part 8 of the TDG Regulations?\n\n1. Reports for the transportation of dangerous goods by Road, Rail and Marine\n\nEmergency Report – Road, Rail or Marine Transport (Section 8.2)\n\nRelease or Anticipated Release Report – Road, Rail or Marine Transport (Section 8.4)\n\n30-Day Follow-Up Report (Section 8.6)\n\n2. Reports for the transportation of dangerous goods by Air\n\nDangerous Goods Accident or Incident Report — Air Transport (Section 8.9)\n\n30-Day Follow-Up Report (Section 8.11)\n\nUndeclared or Misdeclared Dangerous Goods Report (Section 8.14)\n\nDangerous Goods Occurrence Report (ICAO) (Section 8.15.1)\n\n3. Reports Relating to Security – All Modes of Transport\n\nLoss or Theft Report (Section 8.16)\n\nUnlawful Interference Report (Section 8.18)\n\nWhat is the definition of release?\n\nAs per Section 1.4 of the TDG Regulations, a release means, in relation to dangerous goods:\n\nA discharge, emission, explosion, outgassing or other escape of dangerous goods, or any component or compound evolving from dangerous goods, from the means of containment being used to handle or transport the dangerous goods; or\n\nAn emission, from a means of containment being used to handle or transport dangerous goods, of ionizing radiation that exceeds a level or limit established under the \"Nuclear Safety and Control Act\".\n\nWhat are examples of anticipated releases?\n\nUsually, when there is an anticipated release of dangerous goods, the integrity of the means of containment is compromised. However, there is no release of dangerous goods yet.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn incident has occurred and dangerous goods will likely have to be transferred to another means of containment.\n\nA means of containment is damaged to the extent that its integrity is compromised and dangerous goods could be released.\n\nA means of containment is lost in navigable waters.\n\nWhat is the definition of public safety?\n\nAs per the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992, public safety is defined as: the safety of human life and health and of property and the environment.\n\nIf there is a release or an anticipated release of dangerous goods, when should an individual make an emergency report?\n\nFor a release of dangerous goods\n\nThe person who has the charge, management, or control of the means of containment at the time of the incident should make an emergency report if the dangerous goods released are in excess of the quantity set out in the table found in Section 8.2 of the TDG Regulations AND if the release endangers public safety.\n\nFor an anticipated release of dangerous goods\n\nThe person who has the charge, management, or control of the means of containment at the time of the incident should make an emergency report if the dangerous goods anticipated to be released would be in excess of the quantity set out in the table found in Section 8.2 of the TDG Regulations AND if the anticipated release could endanger public safety.\n\nTo whom should the emergency report be made to?\n\nThe emergency report must be made to local authorities responsible for responding to emergencies. You can find a list, by province, of local authorities on this page: https://tc.canada.ca/en/dangerous-goods/canutec/reporting-requirements.\n\nTo learn more on information to include in the emergency report, refer to Section 8.3 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen should an individual make a release or anticipated release report?\n\nA release or anticipated release report must be made if:\n\nAn emergency report is required; AND\n\nThe release or anticipated release of dangerous goods results in any of the consequences listed in Subsections 8.4 (2) and (3) of the TDG Regulations.\n\nNote: When a release or anticipated release report was required, the person who made the report, or his/her employer, must make a 30-day follow-up report. For more information on the 30-day follow-up report, refer to Sections 8.6 and 8.7 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen should an individual make a loss or theft report?\n\nAny person who had the charge, management, or control of the dangerous goods immediately before the loss of theft must, as soon as possible after the loss of theft, report it by telephone to the persons listed in Subsection 8.16 (3) if the lost or stolen dangerous goods are in excess of the quantity set out in Subsection 8.16 (2) of the TDG Regulations.\n\nTo learn more on what information to include in the loss or theft report, refer to Section 8.17 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen should an individual make an unlawful interference report?\n\nThe person who had the charge, management or control of the dangerous goods must, as soon as possible after the discovery of the unlawful interference, report it by telephone to the persons listed in Subsection 8.18 (2) of the TDG Regulations.\n\nTo learn more on what information to include in the unlawful interference report, refer to Section 8.19 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nIn Part 8, we often refer to ʺa closure of…ʺ. What is considered a closure?\n\nFacility\n\nIn the transportation of dangerous goods, a facility closure refers to the full or partial closure of any facility where dangerous goods are handled.\n\nFor example:\n\nA release occurs on loading dock No. 10 of a plant. The plant closes one dock for the day for cleaning, though the plant's other departments continue operations.\n\nA derailment occurs in the yard of a plant. The lines are closed for a few hours while responders transfer the cargo to another tank car and place the derailed tank car back on the rails.\n\nRailway Line\n\nIn the transportation of dangerous goods, a railway line is considered closed when traffic is impossible for any period of time (whether for a few minutes, a few hours or a few days) due to a release or anticipated release of dangerous goods.\n\nFor example:\n\nA train carrying dangerous goods derails on the main railway line, causing a release due to damage to a tank car. Trains cannot move until the site is cleaned up.\n\nA tank car carrying dangerous goods is involved in a collision at a level crossing. Railways are closed until the site is cleaned up.\n\nRoad\n\nIn the transportation of dangerous goods, a road closure is any change in the traffic patterns of a private or public roadway including its full or partial closure, whether due to the release of dangerous goods or their transfer in the event of an anticipated release.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter a release occurs on the westbound Highway 417, one westbound lane is temporarily closed while the two eastbound lanes remain open to traffic.\n\nA tank truck is on its side in a ditch on a rural road and the dangerous goods are transferred to a second tank truck. After creating a buffer zone with pylons, traffic is allowed through one lane at a time.\n\nA train derails, and a release occurs on the railway lines near a road. The road is closed to all traffic to protect the public, secure the perimeter and clean-up.\n\nIn Part 8, we often refer to a facility. What is considered a facility?\n\nIn the transportation of dangerous goods, a facility is a permanent or temporary building (or part of a building) used for the handling of dangerous goods.\n\nWhen should an individual make a dangerous goods accident or incident report (air) if there is a release or anticipated release of dangerous goods?\n\nFor a release of dangerous goods\n\nWhen there is a release of dangerous goods being offered for transport, handled or transported at an aerodrome, an air cargo facility, or by aircraft, the person who had the charge, management, or control of the means of containment at the time of the release should make a dangerous goods accident or incident report (air) if:\n\nThe dangerous goods released are in excess of the quantity set out in the table found in Section 8.9 of the TDG Regulations; AND\n\nThe release endangers public safety; AND\n\nThe release of dangerous goods results in any of the consequences listed in Subsection 8.9 (3) of the TDG Regulations\n\nFor an anticipated release of dangerous goods\n\nWhen there is an anticipated release of dangerous goods being offered for transport, handled or transported at an aerodrome, an air cargo facility, or by aircraft, the person who had the charge, management, or control of the means of containment at the time of the anticipated release should make a dangerous goods accident or incident report (air) if:\n\nThe dangerous goods anticipated to be released could be in excess of the quantity set out in the table found in Section 8.9 of the TDG Regulations; AND\n\nThe anticipated release could endanger public safety; AND\n\nThe anticipated release of dangerous goods could result in any of the consequences listed in Subsection 8.9 (3) of the TDG Regulations.\n\nNote: When a dangerous goods accident or incident report (air) is required, the person who made the report, or his/her employer, must make a 30-day follow- up report.\n\nFor more information on the 30-day follow-up report, refer to Sections 8.11 and 8.12 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nTo whom should the dangerous goods accident or incident report (air) be made to?\n\nThe dangerous goods accident or incident report (air) must be made to:\n\nCANUTEC at 1-888-CAN-UTEC (226-8832), 613-996-6666 or *666 (cell phone);\n\nIn the case of dangerous goods included in Class 7, Radioactive Materials, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.\n\nTo learn more on what information to include in the dangerous goods accident or incident report, refer to Section 8.10 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen should an individual make an undeclared or misdeclared report and to whom?\n\nA person must make an undeclared or misdeclared report as soon as possible after discovering, at an aerodrome or air cargo facility or on board an aircraft, dangerous goods that are not accompanied by the documentation or dangerous goods marks set out for the dangerous goods in Parts 1 to 6 and 8 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions.\n\nThe report must be made to CANUTEC at 1-888-CAN-UTEC (226-8832), 613-996-6666 or *666 (cell phone).\n\nTo learn more on what information to include in the undeclared or misdeclared report, refer to Section 8.15 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen should an individual make a Dangerous Goods Occurrence Report (ICAO) and to whom?\n\nA person must make a Dangerous Goods Occurrence Report (ICAO) within seven days after discovering, at an aerodrome or air cargo facility or on board an aircraft, dangerous goods that have been transported on board an aircraft without:\n\nbeing loaded, segregated or secured in accordance with Chapter 2 of Part 7 of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO) Technical Instructions; or\n\nthe pilot-in-command having been informed in accordance with section 7;4.1 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions.\n\nThe report must be made to the Director General of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Directorate by mail, by fax or by email to:\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods Directorate\n\nTransport Canada\n\nPlace de Ville, Tower C, 9th Floor\n\n330 Sparks Street\n\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nK1A 0N5\n\nFax: 613-990-2917\n\nEmail: dor-rcd@tc.gc.ca\n\nTo learn more on what information to include in the Dangerous Goods Occurrence Report (ICAO), refer to Section 8.15.2 of the TDG Regulations\n\nRoad Transport\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 9)\n\nDoes Transport Canada consider \"cross-docking\" (the process of transferring dangerous goods in a small means of containment (SMOC) or large means of containment (LMOC), from one road vehicle to another, before reaching their final destination on the original shipping document, or where the LMOC is transferred to a different tractor unit and/or the driver is changed) to be reshipping for the purposes of Section 9.4 of the TDG Regulations?\n\n\"Reshipping\" is when the dangerous goods imported into Canada or transported through Canada after the shipment arrives at the destination specified on the original shipping document and a new shipping document is created to put the dangerous goods back in transport.\n\nTransport Canada does not consider \"cross-docking\" (the process of transferring dangerous goods in a small means of containment (SMOC) or large means of containment (LMOC), from one road vehicle to another, before reaching their final destination on the original shipping document, or where the LMOC is transferred to a different tractor unit and/or the driver is changed) as \"reshipping\" for the purposes of Section 9.4 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen handling occurs such as being transferred from one large means of containment (i.e. trailer, container, truck, railcar) to another large means of containment while in transport and prior to arriving at the final destination on the original shipping document the DG may continue to be transported with safety marks in accordance with 49 CFR, the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code without the notation specified in subsections 9.4(2) and 10.4(2) of the TDGR; however, the large means of containment (trailer, container, truck, railcar) must have placards displayed in accordance with Part 4 (Dangerous Goods Safety Marks).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the guide on Transporting dangerous goods shipments from the United States to Canada by road or rail.\n\nRail Transport\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 10)\n\nIs displaying the words « non-odorized » or « not odorized » on a rail tank car of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that contains an odorant considered an infraction to the TDG Regulations?\n\nDisplaying « non-odorized » or « not odorized » on rail tank cars is not misleading under the current TDG Act and Regulations as these words are not considered prescribed safety marks. Therefore, this would not be an offence, even if the rail tank car does contain odorized product.\n\nDoes Transport Canada consider \"cross-docking\" (the process of transferring dangerous goods in a small means of containment (SMOC) or large means of containment (LMOC), from one railcar to another railcar, or to a truck or trailer before reaching their final destination on the original shipping document) to be reshipping for the purposes of Section 10.4 of the TDG Regulations?\n\n\"Reshipping\" is when the dangerous goods imported into Canada or transported through Canada after the shipment arrives at the destination specified on the original shipping document and a new shipping document is created to put the dangerous goods back in transport.\n\nTransport Canada does not consider cross-docking (the process of transferring dangerous goods in a small means of containment (SMOC) or large means of containment (LMOC), from one railcar to another railcar, or to a truck or trailer before reaching their final destination on the original shipping document) as \"reshipping\" for the purposes of Section 10.4 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nWhen handling occurs such as being transferred from one large means of containment (i.e. trailer, container, truck, railcar) to another large means of containment while in transport and prior to arriving at the final destination on the original shipping document the DG may continue to be transported with safety marks in accordance with 49 CFR, the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code without the notation specified in subsections 9.4(2) and 10.4(2) of the TDGR; however, the large means of containment (trailer, container, truck, railcar) must have placards displayed in accordance with Part 4 (Dangerous Goods Safety Marks).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the guide on Transporting dangerous goods shipments from the United States to Canada by road or rail.\n\nMarine Transport\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 11)\n\nWhat is the difference between a passenger carrying vessel, a vessel and a ferry?\n\nUnder the Canada Shipping Act, 2001 (CSA 2001), a “vessel” means a boat, ship or craft designed, used or capable of being used solely or partly for navigation in, on, through or immediately above water, without regard to method or lack of propulsion, and includes such a vessel that is under construction. It does not include a floating object of a prescribed class.\n\nIn the TDG Regulations a “passenger carrying vessel” means a vessel that is carrying one or more passengers.\n\nSection 1.10 of the TDG Regulations specifies that:\n\nthe requirements of the Regulations respecting the transportation of dangerous goods other than explosives on board a passenger carrying vessel apply to a passenger carrying vessel that is transporting more than 25 passengers or more than one passenger for each 3 m of the length of the vessel.\n\nthe requirements of the Regulations respecting the transportation of dangerous goods that are explosives on board a passenger carrying vessel apply to a passenger carrying vessel that is transporting more than 12 passengers.\n\nA ferry is, therefore, considered a vessel and the requirements of the Regulations related to the transportation of dangerous goods on board a passenger carrying vessel apply if the ferry meets the description set out in Section 1.10.\n\nCan I use the Ferry Exemption?\n\nThe Ferry Exemption applies to ferries operating over the most direct water route between two points not more than 5 km apart.\n\nDistance of ferry route Ferry Exemption 0-5 KM\n\nFerry exemption (Section 1.30)\n\nExemption for propane and gasoline in highway tanks on passenger carrying vessels (Section 1.30.1)\n\nMore than 5 KM\n\nNo exemption for transport of dangerous goods on ferries\n\nRequirement Ferry Exemption\n\nWhich three provisions apply to ferries?\n\nThe following provisions apply to ferries:\n\nRequirement that the limits indicated in the passenger carrying vessel index (Column 8 of Schedule 1) must be met if dangerous goods are transported on board a vessel that is carrying more than 25 passengers - Section 1.6 of Part 1 (Coming into Force, Repeal, Interpretation, General Provisions and Special Cases);\n\nRequirement that the master of the vessel have a copy of the shipping document readily available on or near the bridge of the vessel - Section 3.9 of Part 3 (Documentation); and\n\nRequirement to report a release or anticipated release of dangerous goods to a Vessel Traffic Services Centre or a Canadian Coast Guard radio station - Paragraph 8.4(4)(d) of Part 8 (Reporting Requirements).\n\nIs the marine pollutant mark included in the Ferry Exemption?\n\nAn exemption from this provision is not required in the ferry exemption as Paragraph 4.22(2)(a) states that the requirement does not apply when marine pollutants are transported on board a road vehicle or railway vehicle on a ro-ro ship. Since the ferries to which the exemption applies would meet the definition of ro-ro ship, they are exempt and therefore, no additional exemption is required.\n\nWhat does the exemption found in Section 1.30.1 allow?\n\nThe exemption found in Section 1.30.1 allows the transport of gasoline and propane in highway tanks on a passenger carrying vessel operating over the most direct water route between two points not more than 5 km apart as long as certain conditions are met.\n\nWhen transporting propane under UN1075, LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES, can the exemption found in Section 1.30.1 be used for propane and gasoline in highway tanks on board passenger carrying vessels?\n\nYes. This exemption does not apply to UN1075, LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GASES as there are multiple dangerous goods (such as butane and propylene) that can be transported under that UN number and Transport Canada wants to limit the exemption to gasoline and propane. However, propane transported as UN1075, LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES may be transported under this exemption because Section 1.32.1 allows the use of UN1075, LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES for UN1978, PROPANE. It is important to note that the highway tanks would only be allowed if the dangerous good is listed on the shipping documents as per Subsection 1.32.1(3).\n\nAir Transport\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 12)\n\nAre survival kits exempt from the TDG Regulations when transported by aircraft?\n\nThe Canadian Aviation Regulations (CAR) require an aircraft to carry survival equipment that provides ways to start a fire, take shelter, drink or purify water and visually signal their distress.\n\nWhile the CAR don't mention protection from bugs, bears and other wild creatures when describing survival kits, Section 1.27 of the TDG Regulations exempts many dangerous goods on board a means of transport that people need for their safety.\n\nThis means that:\n\nAircraft survival kits that are carried for the safety of persons onboard are exempted from the TDG Regulations. The kit may contain \"explosives\" such as the actuating cartridges (cartridges, power device of division 1.4C and 1.4S) used to inflate an article such as a dingy, or signal devices such as smoke and illumination signal flares.\n\nNOTE: Even though Subsection 1.27(2) of the TDG Regulations states that ammunition cannot be transported under this exemption, there is a provision under Part 8 of the ICAO Technical Instructions that allows a person to transport onboard an aircraft up to 5 kg of cartridges (i.e., ammunition classified as UN0012 or UN0014) provided certain conditions are met.\n\nSpare aircraft survival kits (UN3072) handled, offered for transport or transported as cargo must fully comply with TDG Regulations.\n\nPersonal survival kits someone carries for use at destination must also fully comply with TDG Regulations. For example, someone being taken to a remote area to conduct survey activities may carry bear spray / pepper spray for protection. In this situation, the survival equipment is not for the aircraft and the person transporting it must either:\n\nApply for an equivalency certificate, or\n\nPackage the dangerous goods according to the requirements of Part 12 and the ICAO Technical Instructions.\n\nNote: A 2001 Commercial and Business Aviation Advisory Circular (CBAAC) No 184 entitled \"Stowage and Packaging of Survival Equipment and Emergency Flares\" contains this same message in more technical terms.\n\nProtective Direction\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 13)\n\nCan you provide guidance or simplify Protective Direction no.36?\n\nA summary of Protective Direction 36 has been published on the TDG website. However, it doesn't replace the official legislative document also found on the TDG website.\n\nEquivalency certificates / Permits\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 14)\n\nWhat is the difference between an \"equivalency certificate\" and \"permit for equivalent level of safety\"?\n\nThey are the same thing. In June of 2009, the TDG Act was amended and the term \"permit for equivalent level of safety\" was changed to \"equivalency certificate\" but the meaning remains the same. However, in the TDG Regulations, the term \"permit for equivalent level of safety\" still exists. In the future, the TDG Regulations will include the new term.\n\nWhat is an equivalency certificate and when do I need one?\n\nYou need an equivalency certificate only when you wish to transport dangerous goods in a way that is NOT allowed by the TDG Regulations. For example, you wish to use a type of cylinder that is not allowed in Canada. To use the cylinder, you must apply for an equivalency certificate to Transport Canada and prove that the cylinder is as safe as a cylinder required by the TDG Regulations. Without an equivalency certificate, you can't legally transport or fill the cylinder in Canada.\n\nPlease note that there is no guarantee that you will be granted a certificate.\n\nHow do I apply for a permit / certificate?\n\nTo learn how to apply for an equivalency certificate, please visit the \"Equivalency Certificates\" section on our website. You may also consult Part 14 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nHow long does it take Transport Canada to grant an equivalency certificate?\n\nWhile it usually takes three months, more complex cases could take longer. However, if the same equivalency certificate already exists for another company, the application process will likely be shorter. Before TC grant a certificate, TC may need to consult with its engineers or other government departments. This consultation process can delay the approval process.\n\nCan we use a special permit issued in accordance with the United States 49 CFR to transport dangerous goods arriving in Canada by road or rail?\n\nYes. The special permit may be used to transport dangerous goods originating from the United States into or through Canada, but only until the first destination shown on the shipping document for each dangerous goods. Please note that the special permit number must appear on the shipping document in accordance with Subsection 9.1(3) of the TDG Regulations.\n\nHere are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: A shipment of two boxes of dangerous goods is transported under a special permit on a road vehicle from Detroit (United States) to Canada. The shipping document accompanying the first box indicates Ottawa as the destination while the second box indicates Montréal. Therefore, the special permit may be used for both boxes until they reach the destination indicated on the shipping document for each one (Ottawa and Montréal).\n\nScenario 2: A highway tank transporting a dangerous goods under a special permit from the United States and required to deliver a specific quantity to three different companies in Canada. In this case, the dangerous goods is in one container and the destination will be indicated on the shipping document(s) accompanying this dangerous goods. Therefore, the special permit may be used until the carrier has delivered the dangerous goods to the three destinations indicated on the shipping document(s).\n\nNote: Please note that for the two scenarios, each shipping document must include the special permit number issued in accordance with the United States 49 CFR.\n\nWhat happens when the dangerous goods transported from the United States under a special permit arrive at their destination in Canada (i.e., the destination indicated on the shipping document), but the company or the person receiving it wants to reship it to another destination in Canada?\n\nThe special permit issued in the United States cannot be used for reshipping in Canada. Since the special permit is valid until the first destination shown on the shipping document following its entry into Canada, the company or the person must, as the case may be:\n\nComply with an exemption (Sections 1.15 to 1.50, or Schedule 2 of the TDG Regulations);\n\nComply with the entire TDG Regulations;\n\nApply for an equivalency certificate issued in Canada under Part 14 of the TDG Regulations.\n\nNote: An equivalency certificate issued in Canada is not required for shipments of dangerous goods that have been transported from the United States to Canada under a 49 CFR special permit and are refused and returned to the United States. In this case, the special permit may be reused. The same goes for means of containment of dangerous goods previously transported from the United States to Canada under a special permit and returned to the United States as residues.\n\nSite Registration Requirements\n\nTDG Regulations (Part 17)\n\nMore information about Part 17 is available online.\n\nClient Identification Database (CID) Webpage\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nSpecial Provisions\n\nTDG Regulations (Schedule 2)\n\nWhen a person uses the lithium batteries exemption found in Special Provision 34, he/she must ensure to include a telephone number (on the lithium battery mark or until December 31, 2018, on the means of containment) in order to obtain additional information on the shipment. Could this telephone number be CANUTEC's telephone number?\n\nNo, it cannot be used because Special Provision 34 does not explicitly allow the use of CANUTEC's telephone number.\n\nWhile Subsection 3.5 (2) of the TDG Regulations allows the use of CANUTEC's telephone number as the 24-hour number on the shipping document under certain conditions, the telephone number that must be displayed in accordance with Special Provision 34 must be the consignor's telephone number or that of a person who is able to provide additional information on the shipment."
