We Have a Label for That, Too\n\nThe benefits of a vehicle fuel economy and environment label now extend to the used car market, too. If you are selling a car or truck, you can print or download a used vehicle label on fueleconomy.gov, making it easy for you to provide fuel economy and CO2 information for your vehicle. The web-tool allows you to easily search by model year, make, model, engine, and transmission options to find the appropriate vehicle.\n\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/UsedCarLabel.jsp\n\nThe used vehicle label displays:\n\nthe fuel economy and CO2 grams per mile;\n\na stock photo of the vehicle; and\n\na QR code that shoppers can scan with a smartphone to personalize the fuel economy information with their annual mileage, percent of driving in the city, and current fuel prices.\n\nThe electronic label graphic can be downloaded and included in online advertisements on the web, while the paper label can be printed and affixed to the vehicle window. As a vehicle’s fuel economy changes very little over a typical 15-year life with proper maintenance, the original EPA fuel economy estimate remains the best indicator of a used vehicle’s average gas mileage.\n\nEvolution of the Label\n\nDownload full size infographic"
