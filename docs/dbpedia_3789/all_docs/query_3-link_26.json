        "text": "Requesting Specific Crash Data\n\nMore specific crash data requests (intersection, corridor, city, county, etc.) can be provided through an open records request (typically in excel format). Local agencies and MPOs/TPRs can contact CDOT directly for crash data within their own jurisdiction. When requesting, please provide specific location(s) and date ranges (e.g., January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2021) or state the desired number of years of the most recent available crash data (up to five years). CDOT does not release personal identifying information including names, driver’s license numbers, addresses, birth dates, license plate numbers, VIN numbers, local and state identifiers such as case numbers, etc.\n\nFor requests of individual crash reports, requests should be sent through the Department of Revenue (DOR). CDOT is not the legal custodian of these records and will refer requests to DOR. Copies of original crash records may also be available directly from the responding law enforcement agency.\n\nProcess\n\nWhen a crash occurs, after an officer investigates and fills out a crash form (DR3447), the form is sent to the Department of Revenue (DOR). DOR processes the records and enters them into a database called DRIVES where the official, legal record is maintained. CDOT receives data from the DRIVES system for all crashes, excluding private property and counter reports. (Counter reports are self‐reported by drivers and are not investigated by a law enforcement officer)."
