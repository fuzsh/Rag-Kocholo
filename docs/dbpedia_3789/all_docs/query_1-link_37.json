        "text": "Nutritional labels give you the information you need to understand which products are healthier. By checking the label each time you buy something, you will take more control of your shopping habits.\n\nWhilst it is mandatory for nutrition information to be displayed on the back of all food packaging, some supermarkets and food manufacturers also display nutritional information on the front of pre-packed food in a handy traffic light system.\n\nUsing the traffic light label is very helpful when you want to compare the calorie, fat, sugar and salt content of different food products at a glance. On this page, we will give tips on how to check the nutritional information on pre-packaged foods and help you understand what it means.\n\nFind out more about nutrients on our webpage.\n\nTraffic light labels\n\nThe traffic light labelling system will tell you whether a food has high, medium or low amounts of fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt. It will also tell you the number of calories and kilojoules in that particular product.\n\nenergy (kilojoules (kj) and calories (kcal))\n\nfat\n\nsaturates\n\nsugar\n\nsalt\n\nThis is an image of the traffic light label found on some foods. The traffic light label is colour coded and shows that green is low in a particular nutrient, amber means medium and red is high in a nutrient.\n\nRed means the product is high in a nutrient and you should try to cut down, eat less often or eat smaller amounts.\n\nAmber means medium. If a food contains mostly amber, you can eat it most of the time.\n\nGreen means low. The more green lights a label displays, the healthier the food is.\n\nTips\n\nDid you know? When you see ‘kcal’ on the nutritional label, it means the number of calories that product has.\n\nReference Intake indicators\n\nReference Intake is shown in percentages and provides information on how the amount of fat, saturates, sugars and salts within that product fits into your daily recommended diet. In the case of this food label, the amount of sugar is 38% of the total recommended daily intake, therefore you should be careful of the amount of sugar consumed in other foods throughout the day.\n\nTraffic light label highlights the reference indicator\n\nCalories\n\nEating and drinking more calories than we need can lead to weight gain. Excess weight gain can lead to obesity. Obesity increases the risk of some types of cancer including bowel cancer and breast cancer and increases the likelihood of developing serious conditions including coronary heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.\n\nKnowing the calorie content of food and drink can help ensure you're not consuming more calories than you need.\n\nTips\n\nDid you know? The recommended calorie intake for men is 2500 calories per day and 2000 calories per day for women.\n\nUseful food shopping tips"
