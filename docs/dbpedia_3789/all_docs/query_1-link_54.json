        "text": "In addition to the aircraft you're flying, other aircraft—flown by artificial intelligence (AI)—cruise the simulated world. You can choose how much AI traffic you want flying around the skies with you using the Traffic dialog box.\n\nDuring installation, the setup program automatically chose the best overall settings for your computer's hardware. The Traffic tab lets you customize traffic to make the world as busy as you want it to be.\n\nDepending on your computer, traffic settings may affect performance. Experiment with the settings to find the combination of performance and realism that you like.\n\nTo open the traffic tab\n\nOn the Options menu, click Settings, and then click Display.\n\nClick the Traffic tab.\n\nTraffic Global Settings\n\nTo adjust the Traffic Global Setting\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic Global Settings drop-down, select Custom, Minimal, Very Low, Low, Medium Low, Medium High, High, Ultra High.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nAviation Traffic\n\nAir traffic consists of both airline traffic and general aviation traffic. Airline traffic includes regularly scheduled air carriers while general aviation traffic refers to all other non-military aircraft.\n\nThe Density sliders determine how busy the traffic is. You can turn off all traffic by setting the sliders to zero (moving the sliders all the way to the left), or you can make traffic very busy by moving the sliders all the way to the right.\n\nBe aware that if you're flying from a small airport in the middle of nowhere, even with a high air traffic density setting you'll encounter less traffic than you would using a medium setting at a busy international airport. On some computer systems, a high density setting may affect simulator performance.\n\nYou can choose to have airline, general aviation, or both kinds of traffic flying during your flights. You'll see the aircraft on the ground and in the air, and you'll hear them communicate with the tower if you're using air traffic control on the same frequency.\n\nTo add more realism, there is also airport vehicle traffic, including baggage handlers and fuel trucks.\n\nTo adjust the aviation traffic density\n\nAdjust the slider left for less density and right for more traffic.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nTo adjust the general aviation traffic density\n\nAdjust the slider left for less density and right for more traffic.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nTo adjust the airport vehicle density\n\nAdjust the slider left for less density and right for more vehicles present at airport.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nAircraft Labels\n\nAll aircraft, including the one you are flying, have labels in the air above the aircraft that provide useful information that you can see from a distance. When you're using air traffic control and the controller gives you a traffic warning, these labels prove particularly useful. You can choose the type of information you want displayed in labels, or you can choose to turn the labels off.\n\nTo display aircraft labels\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the Show aircraft labels checkbox.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nUser Aircraft\n\nWhen you select User aircraft, your own aircraft will be labeled; this is a useful feature if you're flying in dense traffic conditions and viewing your aircraft from Tower or Spot plane view.\n\nTo label your aircraft\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the User aircraft check box.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nManufacturer\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer's name can be useful to identify traffic when using air traffic control. Traffic advisories from ATC are often given as \"...traffic is a <manufacturer>: <model>.\" In this case, \"manufacturer\" is the manufacturer's name.\n\nTo see the manufacturer's name in labels\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the Manufacturer check box.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nModel\n\nThe aircraft model can be useful to identify aircraft mentioned in ATC traffic reports. Traffic advisories from ATC are often given as \"...traffic is a <manufacturer> <model>.\" In this case, \"model\" is the model name. If you're looking for the traffic, the model name in the label can help differentiate2 or more aircraft from the same manufacturer operating within the same region.\n\nTo see the model name in labels\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the Model check box.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nTail Number\n\nThe tail number is useful when listening to air traffic control. The controller may be issuing instructions to an aircraft near you that is not currently close enough to warrant giving you an advisory. Seeing the tail number allows you to identify who ATC is talking to. Tail numbers are usually the aircraft registration number.\n\nTo see the tail number in labels\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the Tail number check box.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nDistance\n\nWhether or not you're listening to air traffic control, aircraft labels can show you the distance between your aircraft and another. Depending on your current International settings, the distance is displayed in miles or kilometers.\n\nTo see the distance between you and other aircraft\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the Distance check box.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nAltitude\n\nIt's often difficult to determine by sight whether another aircraft is flying at the same altitude as your aircraft. Air traffic advisories always include the altitude of the other aircraft, so seeing the altitude in the label can help identify the traffic. Depending on your current International settings, the altitude is displayed in feet or meters.\n\nTo see altitude in labels\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select the Altitude check box.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nLabel Color\n\nExperiment with setting different colors for aircraft labels to determine which color is easiest for you to see. Different weather conditions may dictate using a different label color.\n\nTo change the label color\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select a setting from the Label color drop-down list.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nCycle Rate\n\nIf you select all of the Aircraft labels options, the labels will contain a lot of information. The information cycles, or changes, by displaying one piece of information at a time. Experiment with different cycle rates to determine which rate works best for you. You can select an interval, ranging from one to five seconds, which determines how long each piece of information remains on screen before cycling to the next piece of information.\n\nTo set the label cycle rate\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, select a setting from the Cycle rate list.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nLand and Sea Traffic\n\nLand and sea traffic includes highway and freeway traffic, large ships, ferries, yachts, and small pleasure boats.\n\nTo adjust road vehicles traffic\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, move the road vehicles slider to the right or left to increase or decrease traffic.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nTo adjust ships and ferries traffic\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, move the ships and ferries slider to the right or left to increase or decrease traffic.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nTo adjust leisure boat traffic\n\nOn the Display Settings Traffic tab, move the leisure boats slider to the right or left to increase or decrease traffic.\n\nClick Accept.\n\nResetting Default Values\n\nYou can easily return to the default display settings at any time.\n\nTo reset the display settings on any tab"
