The possible fields are:\n\nData\n\n—The quantity of data that is processed during the selected time period.\n\nFiles\n\n—The number of files that a Discover Server scanned.\n\nMessages\n\n—The number of message components (email message components, Web post components, and so on) that were processed.\n\nIncidents\n\n—The number of incidents\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nhas captured.\n\nEncrypted Attachments\n\n—The number of encrypted attachments.\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\ncannot analyze encrypted attachments.\n\nUnprocessable Files\n\nor\n\nUnprocessable Components\n\n—An item is reported as\n\nUnprocessable\n\nif the file cannot be opened for unknown reasons. Files that do not contain text or that cannot be opened for a known reason (such as graphics or password-protected files) are not labeled\n\nUnprocessable\n\n.\n\nThe following events can cause\n\nUnprocessable\n\nfiles and components:\n\nA corrupted network stream\n\nA long timeout or short timeout occurs when\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nwaits to receive extracted content (ContentExtraction.LongTimeout or ContentExtraction.ShortTimeout)\n\nAn extraction size that is larger than the limit that is specified in FileReader.MaxFileSize\n\nA file that is larger than the size limit that is set in ContentExtraction.MaxContentSize (30MB default).\n\n“Components” include the individual items that comprise an archive, or compressed file.\n\nDiscarded Packets\n\n—The number of packets\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\ncopied (for analysis) but then discarded before they were analyzed.\n\nMessages or Files/Incidents Over Time\n\nA graph representing the data processed. Graphs show the following types of information:\n\nMessages\n\n—The number of messages (files, email message components, Web post components, and so on) that were processed.\n\nIncidents\n\n—The number of incidents\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nhas captured.\n\nData\n\n—The amount of data processed (in gigabytes).\n\nDiscards\n\n—The number of packets\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\ncopied (for analysis) but then discarded before they were analyzed."
