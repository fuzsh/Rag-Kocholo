        "text": "Traffic Management: Given its capability to identify different types of vehicles, this model could be used by city planners and traffic management authorities to monitor vehicular activities at various intersections. This data could aid in optimizing traffic signals timings for smoother flow and reducing congestion.\n\nSafety Enhancement: The model could be used to enhance safety in accident-prone areas by closely monitoring the type and numbers of vehicles crossing any particular junction. This could act as a preventive measure against potential accidents, especially involving heavier vehicles and smaller ones like bicycles and motorbikes.\n\nUrban Planning: By analyzing the types of vehicles predominantly used in a particular city or region, the model could provide valuable insights for urban planning. For instance, regions with a high number of bicycles may benefit from more bicycle lanes.\n\nFleet Management: Companies with large fleets of cars, trucks, buses or bikes could use this model to monitor and assess their vehicles' movement in real time. It can help optimize routes and schedules, thus improving logistical efficiency."
