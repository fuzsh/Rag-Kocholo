        "text": "We will be exhibiting from 16. to 19.04.2024 at the DELTA – a Part of FORCE Technology stand. Find out about our current product range in the field of traffic monitoring/classification and weigh-in-motion systems as well as instruments for measuring the optical properties of road markings and retroreflective sheetings. We look forward to your visit (Stand 07.314).\n\nOn 30.10.2023, the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) certified the traffic monitoring system TMCS-IP with accuracy class A1 with feeder cables of 50m, 300m and up to 1.050m. The certification was carried out according to the TLS 2012 suitability test.\n\nOn 30.10.2023, the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) certified the traffic monitoring system TDS 824-R/TDS 821-U with accuracy class A1 with feeder cables of 50m, 300m and up to 1.050m. The certification was carried out according to the TLS 2012 suitability test.\n\nOn 30.10.2023, the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) certified the traffic monitoring system TDS 824-H/TDS 821-H with accuracy class A1 with feeder cables of 50m, 300m and up to 1.050m. The certification was carried out according to the TLS 2012 suitability test.\n\nAs part of the above event, we will be exhibiting static and dynamic instruments for measuring the optical properties of road markings on 30.11.2023. We look forward to your visit.\n\nOn 16.05.2023, the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) re-certified the traffic monitoring system TDS 821-U/VDK 900 with accuracy class A1 with feeder cables of up to 300m. The certification was carried out according to the TLS 2012 suitability test.\n\nAs part of the above event, we will be exhibiting static and dynamic instruments for measuring the optical properties of road markings on 24.11.2022. We look forward to your visit.\n\nOn 14.10.2022, Traffic Data Systems (in the person of Florian Weiss) was accepted into the project group ‘Automatic Road Vehicle Scales’ of the Rule Determination Committee set up at the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, National Metrological Institute of Germany).\n\nIn the course of the opening of the German Road and Transport Congress 2022 in Dortmund, the Federal Minister for Digital Affairs and Transport, Dr. Volker Wissing, together with the Minister for Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Oliver Krischer, as well as the Mayor of the City of Dortmund, Ms. Uta Mais, visited the stand of Traffic Data Systems (Florian Weiss) to get informed about current developments in the automatic detection and court-usable documentation and enforcement of overloaded heavy goods vehicles for the protection of roads and bridges (photo: mbphotographie Michael Bahlo).\n\nVisit us at stand WH.D14 and let us show you the latest developments in weigh in motion systems (WIM) and loop-based traffic monitoring systems. We will also show optical instruments for road markings, traffic signs and safety clothing as well as systems for noise measurement, counting of people and bicycles and noise calming. We look forward to seeing you.\n\nTraffic Data Systems was founded on 27 August 1997 and immediately started its activities in the development, production, sales and service of traffic monitoring systems. Since then, the product range has been expanded to include weigh-in-motion systems as well as optical instruments and acoustic systems and consulting activities in the field of traffic technology.\n\nWe would like to thank our national and international customers and suppliers for the trustful cooperation.\n\nOn 23.01.2020 the company ‘TDS Traffic Data Systems GmbH’ was registered at the Regional Court of Wiener Neustadt (Austria). We would like to point out that our company was already founded in August 1997 under the name ‘Traffic Data Systems GmbH’ in Germany. We do not have any business relations with the company in Vienna and we are not involved in it.\n\nWe are represented in Austria exclusively by PRT Computersteuerungen Gesellschaft m.b.H. in Vienna.\n\nDue to the current Corona situation, the 2G rule (vaccinated/well) still applies in our offices. Visits must be registered in advance in writing and digital vaccination certificates with QR code must be brought along, which will be checked on site via app. FFP2 or surgical masks are to be worn in the offices. Our staff can be reached by phone and email. Please understand that we do not receive unannounced visitors.\n\nOn 10 May 2021, DELTA’s LTL 3500 Retroreflectometer was approved by StrAusZert for the measurement of day (Qd) and nighttime (RL) visibility of road markings. The system fulfills the requirements of ZTV M 13, Annex 7.1 and 7.2.\n\nIn March 2021, the OIML R134 certification of the WIM-DSP 32 was again nationally recognised by LAT MB in Latvia (2021-2024).\n\nMobile phone operators O2, Vodafone and Telekom informed us in November 2020 that their UMTS mobile phone network (3G standard) would be switched off on 30 June 2021. Vodafone will be terminating the CSD standard (Circuit Switch Data) on 31 December 2020. Telekom will successively withdraw this service between now and 31 December 2022.
