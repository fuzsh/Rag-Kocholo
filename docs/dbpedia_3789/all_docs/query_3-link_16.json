The totals in some charts may be greater than the number of crashes, because of several factors, including multiple sources for the same crash, multiple entities reporting the same crash, and multiple entities reporting the same crash but with different values. Also, vehicles could have collided with more than one object and damage may occur in several areas of a vehicle.\n\nData\n\nData and Limitations\n\nUnderstanding the terms and requirements of the General Order, the data it aims to obtain, and the limitations of those data are crucial for accurate interpretation and analysis. The following should be considered when reviewing these data and other information.\n\nADS: Entities named in the General Order must report a crash if ADS was in use at any time within 30 seconds of the crash and resulted in property damage or injury.\n\nLevel 2 ADAS: Entities named in the General Order must report a crash if Level 2 ADAS was in use at any time within 30 seconds of the crash and the crash involves a vulnerable road user or results in a fatality, a vehicle tow-away, an air bag deployment, or any individual being transported to a hospital for medical treatment.\n\nMore information on the reporting requirements is available in the General Order.\n\nCrash data recording and telemetry capabilities may vary widely by manufacturer and driving automation system. ADS-equipped vehicles typically utilize multiple sensors and cameras and tend to have relatively advanced data recording and telemetry capabilities. As a result, crashes involving ADS-equipped vehicles can generally be reported in a timely manner with great detail. However, it is important to keep in mind differences and variation in data recording and telemetry capabilities for different reporting entities when reviewing the summary incident report data.\n\nMany Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles may be limited in their capabilities to record data related to driving automation system engagement and crash circumstances. The vehicle’s ability to remotely transmit this data to the manufacturer for notification purposes can also widely vary. Furthermore, Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles are generally privately owned; as a result, when a reportable crash does occur, manufacturers may not know of it unless contacted by the vehicle owner. These limitations are important to keep in mind when reviewing the summary incident report data.\n\nManufacturers of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles with limited data recording and telemetry capabilities may only receive consumer reports of driving automation system involvement in a crash outcome, and there may be a time delay before the manufacturer is notified, if the manufacturer is notified at all. In general, timeliness of the General Order reporting is dependent on if and when the manufacturer becomes aware of the crash and not on when the crash occurs. Due to variation in data recording and telemetry capabilities, the summary incident report data should not be assumed to be statistically representative of all crashes.\n\nFor example, a Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle manufacturer with access to advanced data recording and telemetry may report a higher number of crashes than a manufacturer with limited access, simply due to the latter’s reliance on conventional crash reporting processes. In other words, it is feasible that some Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle crashes are not included in the summary incident report data because the reporting entity was not aware of them. Furthermore, some crashes of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles with limited telematic capabilities may not be included in the General Order if the consumer did not state that the automation system was engaged within 30 seconds of the crash or if there is no other available information indicating Level 2 ADAS engagement due to limited data available from the crashed vehicle. By contrast, some manufacturers have access to a much greater amount of crash data almost immediately after a crash because of their advanced data recording and telemetry.\n\nA reporting entity is required to submit an incident report within a certain time from when it receives notice of a crash that may be reportable. This report is required regardless of whether the reporting entity has verified or agrees with the information. Therefore, initial reports may reflect incomplete or unknown information. This means that a reporting entity with access to vehicle telemetry may quickly become aware of an air bag deployment incident subject to the General Order, but it may not become aware of all circumstances related to the crash, such as surface conditions, whether all passengers were belted, or whether an injury occurred. Similarly, a reporting entity may receive a consumer complaint or claim that includes incomplete information. A reporting entity that receives new or additional information after the initial report is submitted is required to submit an updated report but is not required to take additional affirmative actions to gather further details.\n\nConfidential business information requests have been made by multiple reporting entities for five data fields available to the public: ADAS / ADS System Version, ADAS / ADS Hardware Version, ADAS / ADS Software Version, Was vehicle within its ODD [operational design domain] at the time of the incident? and Narrative. Information received by NHTSA, for which a properly filed confidentiality request is submitted, will be kept confidential until the chief counsel makes a determination regarding its confidentiality. All personally identifiable information has also been removed from the summary incident report data. Redactions of CBI and PII are noted in the data except for the VIN of the subject vehicle and the dates recorded in the report. The last 6 digits of the subject vehicle VIN have been withheld as PII, and dates are reported as month and year without the day. Additional information regarding NHTSA's procedures for reviewing, processing and releasing information claimed to be confidential by a reporting entity can be found in Appendix B of the General Order and in 49 C.F.R. Part 512.\n\nFor crashes that meet the reporting requirements of the General Order, the reporting entity may be required to submit multiple reports for a single crash (an initial report, a 10-day followup and any subsequent updates). In addition, more than one entity may be responsible for reporting the same crash. For example, the vehicle manufacturer, system developer/supplier and operator of the vehicle may all be named in the General Order. This means that a single crash may have multiple reports from multiple entities. Consequently, the overall number of reports submitted does not equate to the total number of incidents and is not a meaningful safety metric.\n\nReporting entities are not required to submit information regarding the number of vehicles they have manufactured, the number of vehicles they are operating, or the distances traveled by those vehicles. Data required to contextualize the incident rates are limited. Data regarding the number of crashes reported for any given manufacturer or operator have not, therefore, been normalized or adjusted by any measure of exposure, including operational design domains or vehicle miles traveled. For example, a reporting entity could report an absolute number of crashes that is higher than another reporting entity but operate a higher number of vehicles for many more miles.\n\nUnderstanding the Data Files\n\nSummary incident report data reported to the agency under the General Order are available for download below. Information from initial reports, updates and monthly reports will be updated on a monthly basis. These publicly available incident report data include all information reported by the reporting entity except information that is or may lead to the disclosure of personally identifiable information and information claimed by the reporting entity to be confidential business information. NHTSA is legally prohibited from disclosing this information, which has been redacted from the CSV file.\n\nIt is important to understand the requirements of the General Order to understand the data and other information reflected in these reports. Although the General Order requires that all reports be submitted using the same Incident Report Form, there are different reporting requirements under the General Order’s Request No. 1, Request No. 2, Request No. 3 and Request No. 4. The General Order also includes specific definitions of various terms, including notice, crash, ADS, ADAS, and subject vehicle. When reviewing a report, it is important to consider all fields for additional context.\n\nDetailed data element definitions and the report log can be found in this document.\n\nDownload Data\n\nThe below CSV files contain incident report data through July 15, 2024.\n\nADS Incident Report Data Level 2 ADAS Incident Report Data Other Incident Report Data Data Element Definitions & Log (PDF)\n\nDownload Summary Incident Report Data\n\nIn this section, you can download incident report data (CSV format) for ADS and Level 2 ADAS. For some incidents, the system type (ADS or Level 2 ADAS) was not reported and data for those incidents are listed in the Other data file. Data files include the following information:\n\nName of the reporting entity\n\nMake, model and model year of the vehicle involved in the incident\n\nA unique vehicle identifier\n\nIncident information (e.g., incident month and year)\n\nA unique incident identifier\n\nIncident scene (e.g., roadway type)\n\nCrash description (e.g., object crash occurred with)\n\nPost-crash information (e.g., indication of any investigation by a law enforcement agency)\n\nNarrative (e.g., description of the pre-crash, crash and post-crash details)\n\nSummary incident report data reflects information as reported to NHTSA. With the exceptions of personally identifiable information and confidential business information, which NHTSA is prohibited from disclosing, and the five NHTSA generated fields discussed below, all information included in the summary incident report data is reproduced as submitted by the reporting entities. Redactions of personally identifiable information and confidential business information are noted in the data except for the VIN of the subject vehicle. The last 6 digits of the subject vehicle VIN have been withheld as personally identifiable information.\n\nFive data fields in the summary incident report data are generated by NHTSA. They are: Report ID, Report Version, Report Submission Date, Same Incident ID and Same Vehicle ID. Each report submitted by a reporting entity is assigned a unique Report ID. Updates to that report retain the original Report ID but are assigned a new Report Version. The Report Submission Date reflects the date on which the report was first submitted by the reporting entity. To assist the public in reviewing the data, the summary incident report data also includes the Same Incident ID field, a unique identifier that allows the user to determine if multiple reports refer to the same incident and the Same Vehicle ID field, a unique identifier that allows the user to determine if multiple incidents involve the same vehicle. Note: In cases where certain field values (such as the VIN) are missing or incorrect, values for the Same Incident ID and Same Vehicle ID fields may be unavailable, inaccurate, or different between versions of reports with the same Report ID. For more information and an explanation of the data and information included in each field see the Data Dictionary, which is linked in the Data section of this webpage.\n\nThere may be multiple reports for the same crash. Depending on the circumstances of the crash and the automation system type, the General Order may require multiple reports to be submitted for a single incident in the form of initial reports and subsequent updates. In addition to this, more than one entity may be responsible for reporting the same incident. This means that a single incident may have multiple reports from multiple entities. The Same Incident ID field is provided to allow users to determine if multiple reports refer to the same incident.\n\nEntities must tell us when they have nothing to report. The summary incident report data includes reports that do not include any crash information. These reports are intended to be a monthly check-in and are required when entities have not received notice of crashes reportable under the monthly criteria or have no new reportable information to provide from previously submitted reports.\n\nUse caution when comparing crash data between entities. Entities subject to the General Order manufacture or operate different types of vehicles with different capabilities in various locations. The number of vehicles an entity has on the road, its access to crash data, operating location and many other factors could all impact a comparison.\n\nFAQs"
