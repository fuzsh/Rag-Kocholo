        "meta_description": "The National Human Trafficking Hotline maintains one of the most extensive data sets on the issue of human trafficking in the United States. The statistics contained on this website are based on aggregated information learned through signals -- phone calls, texts, online chats, emails, and online tip reports -- received by the Trafficking Hotline. The data do not define the totality of human trafficking or of a trafficking network in any given area. The Trafficking Hotline uses this data to help human trafficking victims and survivors and to provide the anti-trafficking field with information to help combat all forms of human trafficking.In order to ensure a high quality of data, Polaris reviews cases of potential trafficking and records the information included below. Recently, the increasing volume of information that needs review has delayed our ability to release fully validated data for the years 2022 and 2023. To meet this challenge, Polaris is transitioning from a manual data validation process to an AI and machine-learning assisted processes. During this transition, in recognition of the need for data by many stakeholders across government, law enforcement, and nonprofit organizations, the Trafficking Hotline has released partially validated data for 2022 and 2023. Partially validated data is data that has not undergone a complete review by data quality analysts. Based on analysis of previous hotline data, partially validated data for 2022 and 2023 has an estimated false positive rate of 13.70% and a false negative rate of 11.04%. We will update both 2022 and 2023 with fully validated data as soon the new data validation processes are in place. In addition, data is dynamic and subject to change as the hotline continues to respond to victims of trafficking. Therefore, even fully validated data reported is likely to have minor fluctuations based on when the data for the report was retrieved. The current report is based on data retrieved on April 22, 2024. Total National StatisticsThe National Human Trafficking Hotline uses the word \"case\" to represent distinct situations of trafficking reported to the hotline. A case can involve one or more potential victims of trafficking and can be reported to the hotline through one or more conversations via call, text, email, online report, or webchat. The use of the word case is not an indication of law enforcement involvement in the situation.Polaris has changed the way we present certain data to include contacts initiated by text and chat. As a result, data obtained before this change may not match what is currently available on this site.",
