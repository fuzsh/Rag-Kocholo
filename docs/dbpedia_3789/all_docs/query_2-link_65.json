        "text": "The monitoring tools in a single application screen help you to evaluate your application's traffic data over time. Use these tools to ensure that a newly configured application, or application changes, are performing as expected.\n\nFor general traffic analysis, you can use the Traffic Management charts found in the ANALYTICS area of a single application screen. The charts include indicators of alerts within the chart's time line, and advanced data filtering options in the Dimensions pane. For example, you can monitor the average application response time of a single pool member, by selecting an entity from the Pool Member Address dimension.\n\nTo monitor traffic data changes over time, you can use the Alerts History to evaluate raised alerts and when they were mitigated.\n\nApplication health alerts are based on specific traffic data. Active application alerts reflect an application performance issue. A critical or warning alert that is active indicates that there has been a sustained threshold violation for over five minutes.\n\nA metric threshold violation must be sustained for 5 minutes to trigger an alert. A subsequent alert is triggered once another threshold is crossed (either an increase or decrease in severity, or cleared). To ensure that conditions are improving, an alert for declining severity (critical to warning) or a cleared alert, is triggered only when the value is sustained for five minutes at ten percent below the threshold value. For example, if a threshold value is configured for greater than 60 percent, a declining severity must be sustained at 54 percent or less to trigger an alert.\n\nIf the performance indicator or threshold does not reflect your application's performance, you can customize the application's alert rule settings. (Click the health icon at the top left of the application screen.) The application health is defined in the application template.\n\nTo manage LTM objects to mitigate a performance issue that you isolated using analytics, you use essentially the same screens that you used to find the problem. But instead of using the ANALYTICS option in the details area, you use the CONFIGURATION option.\n\nThe workflow for resolving the issue is essentially the same, regardless of what kind of object is triggering the issue.\n\nCreate a replacement for the object triggering the issue.\n\nDelete or remove the object from service.\n\nIn these tasks, we provide an example of a problem pool member. But you can use essentially the same strategy for other LTM object types in your application.\n\nWhen you are troubleshooting the traffic performance of an application, additional data can help you isolate details that characterize potential, or ongoing, issues. On the Application screen, the Enhanced Analytics option provides you with the ability to collect more information about the HTTP traffic management from your application's BIG-IP® host device. When this feature is enabled, the enhanced data displays additional dimension objects and data for the HTTP traffic management dimensions found in the ANALYTICS area.\n\nThe Enhanced Analytics option does not impact your BIG-IQ® system performance. By default,you can enable up to 20 applications simultaneously in Enhanced Analytics mode.\n\nNote: System administrators can adjust the maximum number of applications by modifying the maxNumberOfApps parameter value in the /var/config/rest/config/restjavad.properties.json file."
