        "text": "Bot Defense protects your Internet applications from automated attacks by identifying and mitigating malicious or bad bots. For more information about Bot Defense, see About Bot Defense.\n\nWhen you deploy Bot Defense, F5 recommends that you set up a test environment to configure and test different configuration options before you set up your production environment.\n\nAfter you decide on your final configuration options and are certain they provide the results you want, you can then set up a production environment.\n\nYour configuration and testing process should include the following steps:\n\nEnable Bot Defense in the Distributed Cloud Console.\n\nThoroughly review Bot Defense deployment prerequisite information and decide what resources you want to protect.\n\nBuild a test system to test different configuration options. If you plan to use Bot Defense with BIG-IP v14-16, you can follow the instructions in the Bot Defense Quick Start to help you quickly set up your test system. Otherwise, see Configure Bot Defense for configuration instructions.\n\nBuild your production system. After you finish working with your test system, configure your production system based on the settings you tested and finalized in your test system.\n\nTest your production system and confirm that it is functioning as you intended.\n\nWhen you are ready to go live with your production system, update your DNS settings to route traffic to your production system.\n\nImportant: Make sure you have permission to change DNS settings for your organization or that you coordinate with an administrator that has the necessary permissions.\n\nCheck for false positive results to make sure Bot Defense is correctly identifying traffic. This step allows you to see how Bot Defense is handling live requests rather than just your test requests.\n\nWhen you are sure that Bot Defense is properly configured and functioning as you intended, you can enable mitigation actions for your endpoints.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou must have a valid Distributed Cloud Console account. For information, see Create a Distributed Cloud Console Account.\n\nYou must have an Organization plan. To see plan information, from the Distributed Cloud Console Home page, click Billing.\n\nYou or another admin must have the following assigned roles:\n\nf5xc-bot-defense-admin: For advanced administrative access, including Bot Defense subscription management.\n\nf5xc-bot-defense-user-role (or ves-io-power-developer-role or greater): For general administration, such as managing protected applications.\n\nf5xc-bot-defense-monitor-role (or ves-io-monitor-role or greater): For read-only operations such as dashboard and report access.\n\nYou can also create custom roles that include access to the required API groups. Use the above roles for guidance on the required API groups. For a complete list of the API groups included in the above roles, see View RBAC Policy Rules and API Groups.\n\nYou must have permission to change DNS settings for your organization.\n\nDepending on how you host your applications, you must have sufficient permissions to configure Bot Defense with your BIG-IP, application platform or content delivery network.\n\nDecide What Resources You Want to Protect\n\nDuring your planning process, you must decide which applications and application pages you want to protect. Bot Defense can protect both web and mobile endpoints. For information on the following configuration options, see Configure Bot Defense.\n\nFor applications that route traffic through F5 Distributed Cloud Mesh, you can use the Distributed Cloud Console to configure the Bot Defense service on your HTTP load balancers.\n\nFor applications that route traffic through BIG-IP, you can download a BIG-IP iApp template to enable Bot Defense with BIG-IP.\n\nFor applications that route traffic through BIG-IP:\n\nIf you use BIG-IP version 17.0 or later, you can configure Bot Defense directly on BIG-IP.\n\nIf you use BIG-IP version 14-16, you can download a BIG-IP iApp template to enable Bot Defense with BIG-IP.\n\nFor web pages hosted on third-party content delivery networks, you can configure Bot Defense on Adobe Commerce Cloud, Amazon CloudFront, Salesforce Commerce Cloud or Cloudflare.\n\nFor many other third-party applications, you can configure Bot Defense using a custom connector.\n\nFor mobile endpoints, you can either embed the F5 Mobile SDK in the application you want to protect, or you can use the F5 Mobile SDK Integrator to automatically integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your application with no coding required.\n\nEnable Bot Defense\n\nTo use Bot Defense, you must first enable it in the Distributed Cloud Console.\n\nOn the Distributed Cloud Console Home page, click Billing.\n\nClick Manage > Billing Plan and scroll to the Organization Plan.\n\nUnder the Organization Plan, click Bot Defense. The Bot Defense landing pages appears.\n\nNote: If Bot Defense is already enabled, the Bot Defense Monitor page appears and you can begin using Bot Defense.\n\nFrom the Bot Defense landing page, click Request Service.\n\nBest Practices\n\nCommon best practices\n\nWhen configuring endpoints, use wildcards to terminate the match. For example: /login*\n\nThis prevents attackers from adding a slash to the end of the request (for example, /login/) when both variants reach the same application endpoint.\n\nThe mitigating response should try to mimic how the application responds when the request is invalid (for example, when invalid credentials are used).\n\nWeb application best practices\n\nIdentify all URL paths to be protected by Bot Defense.\n\nUse wildcards cautiously. Avoid enabling Bot Defense protection for more URLs than required by adding wildcards.\n\nProtect Mobile Endpoints\n\nTo protect mobile endpoints with Bot Defense, you must complete the following high-level steps:\n\nReview the best practices for protecting mobile endpoints.\n\nDownload the base configuration for the F5 Mobile SDK.\n\nComplete one of the following tasks to integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your mobile application:\n\nIntegrate the F5 Mobile SDK library into your Android or iOS application.\n\nUse the Mobile SDK Integrator, which enables you to integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your application without making code changes.\n\nMobile application best practices\n\nWhen you configure protection for mobile endpoints, F5 recommends that you follow these best practices:\n\nAdd Bot Defense headers only to those requests which are also configured for Bot Defense protection in WAAP or iApp. This helps avoid filling up bandwidth unnecessarily.\n\nBefore you onboard a mobile application, identify all URLs that must be protected.\n\nF5 recommends that you integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with applications that have forced-upgrade capability. This allows you to upgrade users to the version of the application that you have integrated with the F5 Mobile SDK.\n\nF5 recommends that you integrate the SDK as described in the F5 Mobile SDK documentation. If you need to deviate from those recommendations, see the F5 knowledge base for other integration considerations or contact F5 Support.\n\nInitialize the F5 Mobile SDK as early as possible in the application lifecycle to ensure the SDK is initialized and ready to add headers before a protected request is made.\n\nIf you use push notifications on Android, you must be aware of special integration considerations when push notifications are sent to many applications at once. See your Android documentation for information.\n\nSo that you can examine traffic filtered by a specific version of your application, F5 recommends that you include an application version marker in the User-Agent header of the request.\n\nExample: User-Agent: sometext MyApp/3.3 sometext\n\nFor all responses returned to protected requests, execute parseResponseHeaders().\n\nEach set of headers contains a unique token. Do not send the same set of headers more than once.\n\nThe F5 Mobile SDK is obfuscated. If you use code obfuscation, exclude the F5 Mobile SDK so it is not obfuscated again.\n\nIf your application uses WebView to access the protected content, consider using the JavaScript solution to add telemetry headers to protected requests. See the F5 knowledge base for information about how to use JavaScript with WebView or contact F5 Support.\n\nTo help you identify SDK integration problems early during development, in your test environment, F5 recommends that you keep your mitigation actions set to Block.\n\nAdd a Mobile Base Configuration\n\nTo use the F5 Mobile SDK or Mobile SDK Integrator to protect mobile endpoints, you must create a mobile base configuration file and bundle it with your mobile application before you release the application in the app store. The mobile base configuration file contains configuration information needed to initialize the SDK and is used during the first launch of an application that uses the SDK. After the initial launch of the application, the SDK calls the Bot Defense server and downloads new configuration information each time the application launches.\n\nYou can create and download the mobile base configuration in either Bot Defense or in Web App and API Protection (WAAP).\n\nTo download the Mobile Base Configuration file:\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nIn Bot Defense, click Manage > Mobile > Mobile Base Configurations.\n\nIn WAAP, click Manage > Bot Defense Management > Mobile Base Configurations.\n\nIn the Actions column, click the Action menu (…) next to your operating system and click Download Mobile Base Configuration file.\n\nSave the file in a location you can access easily.\n\nNext Steps\n\nAfter you download the mobile base configuration file, provide it to your application developers so they can bundle the file with your mobile application that uses the F5 Mobile SDK or Mobile SDK Integrator before you release the application in the app store.\n\nThen either work with your developers to integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your application or configure the F5 Mobile SDK Integrator to automatically integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your application.\n\nAdd Bot Defense SDK to your mobile applications\n\nTo protect your native applications from malicious automation, you can integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your native applications, which allows applications to route traffic to Bot Defense for evaluation. You can download iOS and Android versions of the SDK from either Bot Defense or Web App and API Protection (WAAP) in the Distributed Cloud Console.\n\nTo download the F5 Mobile SDK\n\nPerform one of the following steps:\n\nIn Bot Defense, click Manage > Mobile > Mobile SDKs.\n\nIn WAAP, click Manage > Bot Defense Management > Mobile SDKs.\n\nIn the Actions column, click the Action menu (…) next to the SDK for your operating system and click Download Mobile SDK.\n\nFor instructions on how to integrate the F5 Mobile SDK, see the following documentation included in the SDK download file:\n\nF5 Mobile SDK for iOS Integration Guide (XC_iOS_IntegrationGuide.pdf)\n\nF5 Mobile SDK for Android Integration Guide (XC_Android_IntegrationGuide.pdf)\n\nNote: You can also integrate Bot Defense with Flutter, React Native, Xamarin, Xamarin.forms, and Cordova. Contact F5 Support for information about integrating with these frameworks.\n\nKeep the following best practices in mind when you update your app to integrate the F5 Mobile SDK:\n\nUse getRequestHeaders and parseResponseHeaders API, rather than the generateHeaders and analyzeResponse. This API is simpler and meets the needs of Bot Defense.\n\nFor body, you can pass in nil on iOS and null on Android.\n\nFor Bot Defense Standard Edition, getRequestHeaders always returns headers, regardless of which URL is passed. For this reason, your developer should only add headers to requests that require protection.\n\nSimilarly, parseResponseHeaders should be called for every response to the protected requests.\n\nIntegrate the F5 Mobile SDK using the Mobile SDK Integrator\n\nThe Mobile SDK Integrator is a no-code solution for integrating the F5 Mobile SDK with your mobile application, which saves you both the time and expense of a traditional SDK integration. For more information, see F5 Mobile SDK Integrator.\n\nYou can download the Mobile SDK Integrator either from Bot Defense or from Web Application and API Protection (WAAP).\n\nTo download the Mobile SDK Integrator:\n\nOn the Distributed Cloud Console Home page, click Billing.\n\nClick Manage > Billing Plan and scroll to the Organization Plan.\n\nUnder the Organization Plan, click Mobile SDK Integrator. The Mobile SDK Integrator landing page appears.\n\nNote: If Mobile SDK Integrator is already enabled, the Mobile SDK Integrator download page appears.\n\nFrom the Mobile SDK Integrator landing page, click Request Service.\n\nAfter F5 fulfills your service request to enable Mobile SDK Integrator, perform the following steps:\n\nFrom the Distributed Cloud Console dashboard, do one of the following:\n\nClick Bot Defense and then click Manage > Mobile > Mobile SDK Integrator.\n\nClick Web App & API Protection and then click Manage > Bot Defense Management > Mobile SDK Integrator.\n\nFrom the Actions column next to the operating system for your app, click the Action menu (…) and then click Download Mobile SDK Integrator.\n\nExtract the contents of the download file.\n\nNext Steps\n\nAfter you download and extract the Mobile SDK Integrator, from the extracted file directory, open the documentation for your operating system:\n\nAndroid: F5-XC-Mobile-SDK-Integrator-Android.pdf\n\niOS: F5-XC-Mobile-SDK-Integrator-iOS.pdf\n\nReview the documentation for additional information about the contents of the extracted download file directory, system requirements and instructions for using the Mobile SDK Integrator.\n\nTest your Bot Defense configuration\n\nUse the following information to help ensure that Bot Defense is properly configured, that it is injecting JavaScript tags in your application pages correctly, or that you have correctly integrated the mobile SDK.\n\nTo confirm that Bot Defense added JavaScript tags to an entry page, use the following procedure to inspect the page in your browser and look for Bot Defense-specific headers.\n\nOpen one of the application pages you chose to protect.\n\nUse the developer tools in your browser or view the page source to inspect the page and confirm that Bot Defense has inserted JavaScript tags with the query string parameters: ?matcher, ?cache, and ?async. For example:\n\nyourscript.js?matcher\n\nyourscript.js?cache\n\nyourscript.js?async\n\nIf the JavaScript tags appear correctly, then Bot Defense is injecting JavaScript tags into your application pages. If you do not see all three JavaScript tags, check your configuration to confirm it is correct. If necessary, contact F5 Support for additional assistance.\n\nVerify Mobile SDK integration\n\nIf you chose to integrate the F5 Mobile SDK with your mobile application, perform the following tasks to verify that you integrated it correctly:\n\nReview the SDK integration documentation that you received from F5 and confirm that you followed all integration steps.\n\nSDK Initialization\n\nDeploy the application on a device for the first time (if the device already has the application, remove it before this test).\n\nStart the application.\n\nOn the Bot Defense Dashboard or the Traffic Analyzer, filter by your client IP address and look for a GET request configuration fetch from your application. If you do not find the GET request, recheck your configuration. For additional assistance, contact F5 Support.\n\nDecorated Request\n\nMake a request for every protected URL.\n\nOn the Bot Defense Dashboard, filter by your client IP address. All protected requests should be marked as “Human.”\n\nMitigation\n\nTemporarily alter the application code so that it does not call getRequestHeaders.\n\nLaunch the application and make protected requests.\n\nOn the Bot Defense Dashboard, filter by your client IP address. All protected requests should be marked as “Automation.” A GET request configuration fetch should appear immediately after each blocked mitigated request.\n\nUpdate your code to call getRequestHeaders again.\n\nIf you successfully completed all test cases, then your integration is working correctly.\n\nNote: F5 recommends that you incorporate these mobile SDK test-cases into your standard regression testing.\n\nBefore you release a new application into your production environment, F5 recommends that you set the mitigation action for the application to Continue or Flag and then perform a false positive analysis on your traffic.\n\nAnalyze Bot Defense Results\n\nAfter you enable Bot Defense in your production environment, before you enable mitigation actions for your web and mobile applications, you must confirm that Bot Defense is working as expected and that no legitimate traffic is marked as automation. F5 recommends that you also explore your traffic reports and examine anything unexpected. Resolve all issues before you enable the Block or Redirect mitigation actions.\n\nAnalyze protected website traffic\n\nPerform the following tests to help confirm that Bot Defense is identifying web traffic correctly.\n\nReview the Bot Defense dashboard to see the types of traffic identified by Bot Defense. From the Bot Defense Home page, click Overview > Monitor.\n\nIn the Protected Apps Overview widget, check that your protected application is listed and that the amount of traffic is appropriate.\n\nIn the Traffic Overview widget, check that the level of human, benign bot, bad bot and other activity is appropriate.\n\nFigure: Bot Defense dashboard\n\nFrom the time-period drop-down menu, select Last 24 hours. In the Traffic Visualized section, check whether traffic marked as malicious increases during the day and decreases at night. If so, this might indicate human traffic.\n\nFigure: Timeframe controls\n\nFrom the Bot Defense Home page, click Report > Traffic Analyzer.\n\nLook at the distribution of IP addresses and the countries of origin. Decide if this distribution looks like it comes from your normal user base.\n\nLook at the User Agent column and decide if there are any suspicious user agents present. You can also use this technique to identify wanted automation (benign bots), such as test tools or SEO bots.\n\nClick Add Filter. From the drop-down menu, select Bot Reason, select In, select Token Missing and click Apply. Review the traffic and determine if it looks legitimate.\n\nIf a normal user request is missing a token, it could mean that the Bot Defense JavaScript did not run, that another JavaScript on the page interfered with the Bot Defense JavaScript, or that the request was made before the Bot Defense JavaScript loaded.\n\nWhen this happens, change the Web Client JavaScript Mode for the endpoint to Sync JS with no Caching, and change the JavaScript Location for the endpoint to After <head>.\n\nThese configuration changes help rule out interference from other JavaScripts that are being executed on the page, help eliminate any potential race conditions when the Asynchronous option is used and minimize any potential network issues.\n\nFigure: Traffic Analyzer report\n\nIf you see legitimate traffic flagged as automation, determine if you can add it to an Allow list.\n\nAnalyze protected mobile traffic\n\nPerform the following tests to help confirm that Bot Defense is identifying mobile traffic correctly.\n\nConfirm that the number of protected requests with no telemetry headers is low or non-existent and that requests with headers are marked as Human.\n\nConfirm that configuration update requests are made at an expected rate. Each configuration fetch corresponds to approximately one user session.\n\nReview your traffic reports and examine any unexpected results. Resolve all issues before you enable mitigation actions.\n\nAnalyze protected requests\n\nPerform a false positive analysis to determine if Bot Defense marks any legitimate traffic to your mobile application as non-human.\n\nIn the Bot Defense Traffic Analyzer report, add the User Agent filter.\n\nSelect In and then select your application version.\n\nThen click Apply.\n\nImportant: Make sure the Bot Reason and Traffic Type columns are displayed.\n\nIn the list of filter results, is any traffic marked as non-human? For example, is traffic identified as Benign Bot or Bad Bot? If yes:\n\nIf the Bot Reason column displays Token Missing, look at the IP distribution and decide if the traffic looks like user traffic or automation. Is the traffic limited to a particular platform (iOS or Android)?\n\nIf the Bot Reason column displays something other than Token Missing, but the traffic looks human, this is unexpected behavior. Investigate or contact support@cloud.f5.com for assistance.\n\nIf the IP Address distribution looks organic and is not concentrated on only a few specific IP addresses, this might indicate that there is a problem with your SDK integration.\n\nIn the Path column, carefully examine the URLs that are being marked as illegitimate. If traffic from the URLs that are marked as malicious increases during the day and decreases at night, this might indicate human traffic. Additionally, if the traffic is from a wide range of IP addresses, it can also indicate human traffic.\n\nIf the flagged traffic is an expected automation, for example, for a monitoring service, determine if you can add the IP addresses to an Allow list.\n\nMobile applications that are integrated with the F5 Mobile SDK fetch new configuration settings from Bot Defense at specific times during the application lifecycle, including:\n\nAt application launch\n\nAt mitigation\n\nAfter four hours (if the application is in the foreground).\n\nTypically, there is approximately one configuration fetch during each active user session. Since some users launch an app but do not proceed further, and others have two sessions within the same four-hour period, it is normal to see an average of 0.5-2 sessions per configuration fetch.\n\nHow you view configuration fetches depends on how you host your application pages you want to protect. The following sections provide information about how to find the number of configuration fetches in each platform.\n\nNote: For all third-party platforms, including Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Adobe Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Commerce Cloud, use the native logging and reporting capabilities of your platform to view configuration fetches. For information, see the documentation for your platform.\n\nView configuration fetches in Web App & API Protection\n\nWhen you use Bot Defense enabled on an HTTP load balancer in Web App and API Protection (WAAP), you can use the Security Dashboard in WAAP to view configuration fetches requested by the mobile application you integrated with the F5 Mobile SDK.\n\nTo view the number of configuration fetches:\n\nLog into Web App & API Protection (WAAP) and check to make sure you are in the correct namespace.\n\nFrom the Web App & API Protection navigation panel, click Overview > Dashboards > Security Dashboard.\n\nIn the Load Balancers widget, click the name of the load balancer that services your production traffic.\n\nClick the Requests tab.\n\nAdd one of the following filters:\n\nFor Android applications, enter req_path in /v1/android/update.\n\nFor iOS applications, enter req_path in /v1/ios/update.\n\nLook at the number of items returned by your search. The number of items should be equal to the number of user sessions you observed during the same period.\n\nFor example, the number of configuration fetches should be equal to the number of login requests you observed during your false positive analysis.\n\nView configuration fetches in BIG-IP\n\nFor BIG-IP versions 14-17 and later, use your native BIG-IP log files to view configuration fetches. For information on viewing BIG-IP log files, see your BIG-IP documentation. View configuration fetches in your third-party platform\n\nNext steps\n\nAfter you confirm that Bot Defense is functioning as expected, that legitimate traffic is not being marked as automation, and that your mobile applications are communicating properly with Bot Defense, you can enable mitigation actions. For information see Configure Mitigation Actions.\n\nConfigure Mitigation Actions\n\nWhen Bot Defense detects automated traffic, you can configure the system to take any of the following actions:\n\nContinue: Allows traffic to continue to the origin server where your application resides. You can choose to add a header that enables you to monitor traffic in reporting and analytics dashboards.\n\nNote: When you configure Bot Defense on Web App and API Protection (WAAP), this option is called Flag.\n\nRedirect: Redirects automated traffic to a different page. You provide the appropriate Status Code and URI where you want to redirect the bot. Use this option to deceive bots into thinking their request successfully went through. You can also redirect to a page with more information for human users that may have been incorrectly redirected.\n\nBlock: Prevents automated traffic from reaching the origin server where your application resides. You can customize the status code, content type, and body of the response message or use the default values provided by the system.\n\nImportant: In the message you display to blocked requests, do not mention “automation”, F5, or Bot Defense so that you do not expose additional information attackers.\n\nNote: Mobile clients only allow Continue and Block. If you select Web and Mobile Client, you can select mitigation actions for each client type.\n\nF5 recommends that you select a mitigation response that mimics how the application responds when a request is invalid (for example, when invalid credentials are used).\n\nIf you enable Bot Defense through an HTTP load balancer in Web App & API Protection (WAAP), you can configure Bot Defense to distinguish between malicious automation (bad bots) and benign bots (good bots). This allows you to apply mitigation actions only to malicious automation or to both malicious and benign bots.\n\nEnable mitigation actions\n\nWhen you initially set up your Bot Defense deployment, F5 recommends that you set your mitigation actions to Continue (Flag), which logs, but does not block, any traffic. When you complete your testing and are sure that the system is properly configured and functioning as intended, you can enable the Block or Redirect mitigation actions to protect your application pages from malicious traffic.\n\nImportant: Before you enable mitigation actions, F5 strongly recommends that you complete a false positive analysis of your traffic.\n\nTo enable mitigation actions for malicious traffic:\n\nUpdate the mitigation actions in your web and mobile endpoint configurations.\n\nIf you configured web scraping protection, make sure to update the mitigation actions in your web scraping configuration.\n\nFor information about how to configure mitigation actions on your specific platform, see Configure Bot Defense and then view the configuration documentation for your platform.\n\nImportant: To disable mitigation actions, reset the mitigation action to Continue.\n\nManage Bot Defense\n\nThe following sections explain how to perform tasks that are periodically required to manage your Bot Defense deployment.\n\nTest changes to your deployment\n\nWhen you make changes to your deployment, F5 recommends that you make them in a test environment before you deploy them in your production environment.\n\nIf you protect a new web-based endpoint:\n\nWhen you add the endpoint to your test system, verify that Bot Defense injects JavaScript tags correctly. For information, see Verify that Bot Defense is injecting JavaScript tags in your application pages.\n\nWhen you add the endpoint to your production system, you must confirm that Bot Defense is working as expected and that no legitimate traffic is marked as automation before you enable mitigation actions. For information, see False positive analysis.\n\nIf you protect a new mobile application, you must perform a false positive analysis before you enable mitigation.\n\nManage protected applications\n\nUse the Distributed Cloud Console to manage your protected applications, for example, to update your configuration, add a protected endpoint or to delete the protected application. For information about specific settings, see Configure Bot Defense and then view the documentation for your platform.\n\nImportant: Be sure to adequately test all changes to your deployment.\n\nView and edit protected applications in Bot Defense\n\nFrom the Distributed Cloud Console Home page, select Bot Defense.\n\nClick Manage > Applications.\n\nTo view configuration information for an application, from the Applications page, in the Actions column, click the Action menu (…) for the application you want to view and click Manage Configuration.\n\nTo edit application configuration information, click Edit Configuration.\n\nIn the Connector Type section, click Edit Configuration to view and edit configuration information.\n\nView and edit protected applications in Web App and API Protection (WAAP)\n\nFrom the Distributed Cloud Console Home page, click Web App and API Protection.\n\nClick Manage > Load Balancers > HTTP Load Balancers.\n\nFrom the HTTP Load Balancers page, in the Actions column, click the Action menu (…) for the load balancer you want to manage and then click Manage Configuration.\n\nTo edit Bot Defense configuration information for the load balancer, click Edit Configuration and then click Bot Protection and Edit Configuration.\n\nBot Defense Dashboards & Reporting\n\nF5 Distributed Cloud Bot Defense includes multiple ways to view detailed information about the traffic that Bot Defense analyzes. Automated Threat Summaries deliver insights to you automatically each month, while a variety of dashboards provide you with instant, detailed access to analysis of your data.\n\nNote: Bot Defense dashboard and report widgets display the message, \"'Undefined' Data Discovered\" when requests reach a protected endpoint that does not have an assigned endpoint label. Make sure you use the latest connector configuration and that you apply an endpoint label to all endpoints.\n\nNote: Bot Defense dashboard and report widgets display the message, \"Data Gap Discovered\" when there is no data to display. Make sure Bot Defense is configured correctly and that you select a time period for the dashboard or report for which you have collected data.\n\nAutomated Threat Summaries\n\nAutomated Threat Summaries are emailed reports that summarize your monthly network traffic and Bot Defense activity. Automated Threat Summaries include information about the percentage of your traffic that is automated, the numbers of good and bad bots detected, the number of human visitors to your protected applications and endpoints, and a breakdown of your overall web traffic that is analyzed by Bot Defense.\n\nTo enable Automated Threat Summaries:\n\nFrom the Distributed Cloud Console Home page, click Bot Defense.\n\nFrom the Bot Defense navigation menu, click Manage > Reports > Reports Management and then click Add Report.\n\nEnter a Name for the report and then, from the Report Type drop-down menu, select Bot Defense.\n\nClick Add Item and then choose the User Group to which you want to send the report. If you need to create a new user group to receive the report, see Users.\n\nClick Save and Exit.\n\nLoad Balancer Bot Defense Dashboard\n\nAfter you enable Bot Defense, the Load Balancer Bot Defense dashboard provides a snapshot of bot and human activity in your web traffic on your HTTP load balancers.\n\nTo view the Web App & API Protection Bot Defense dashboard:\n\nFrom the Web App & API Protection navigation menu, click Overview > Dashboards > Security Dashboard.\n\nIn the Load Balancer widget, from the list of load balancers, click the name of the load balancer you want to view and then click Bot Defense.\n\nThe Load Balancer Bot Defense dashboard includes the following information:\n\nTraffic Types: The total number of transactions in the selected time window and how many were bad bots, benign bots or humans.

Before you begin the configuration process, make sure you have thoroughly reviewed the section, Best Practices to help you make the correct configuration decisions.\n\nImportant: When you configure Bot Defense, F5 recommends that you set all mitigation actions to Flag or Continue until you finish testing that the system is configured properly and working as intended.\n\nFor applications that route traffic through F5 Distributed Cloud Mesh (WAAP), see Configure Bot Defense on an HTTP load balancer (WAAP).\n\nFor applications that route traffic through BIG-IP, see one of the following topics:\n\nEnable Bot Defense on BIG-IP v14-16 (iApp Connector).\n\nEnable Bot Defense on BIG-IP v17.0 or later.\n\nFor applications hosted on a third-party content delivery network, see one of the following topics:\n\nEnable Bot Defense on Adobe Commerce Cloud (Magento).\n\nEnable Bot Defense on Amazon CloudFront.\n\nEnable Bot Defense on Cloudflare.\n\nEnable Bot Defense on Salesforce Commerce Cloud.\n\nFor all other applications, you can configure Bot Defense with a custom application.\n\nNext Steps\n\nWhen you finish configuring Bot Defense, review Bot Defense results to help ensure the system is properly configured and working as intended. See the following information:\n\nTest your Bot Defense configuration\n\nAnalyze Bot Defense results\n\nConfigure Bot Defense on an HTTP load balancer (WAAP)\n\nThe following information explains how to configure Bot Defense on an HTTP load balancer that you have configured with F5 Distributed Cloud.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou must have an active F5 Distributed Cloud account. If you do not have an account, see Create a Distributed Cloud Console Account.\n\nYou must have Bot Defense enabled in the Distributed Cloud Console. See Enable Bot Defense.\n\nYou must have Web App & API Protection (WAAP) enabled and have an HTTP load balancer configured.\n\nWAAP or Distributed Mesh best practices\n\nIf your site is served from an apex domain, configure a redirect from the apex domain to the FQDN domain (for example, customer.com redirects to www.customer.com). This is required because your domain must point to a Distributed Cloud-provided CNAME. Pointing a CNAME from an apex domain is not recommended as that prevents you from having SOA and all other DNS records at apex.\n\nDo not use IP-based session persistence to load-balance internally. F5 Distributed Cloud has a range of egress IPs and if you have IP-based load balancing at the origin, this may break your session persistence. Use cookie-persistence, if possible.\n\nLock down your infrastructure to Distributed Cloud egress IPs only. This prevents attackers from bypassing Distributed Cloud altogether and hitting your origin directly.\n\nValidate your internal tools (such as logging tools or fraud tools) see the traffic accurately when going through Bot Defense.\n\nIf you have a CDN (such as CloudFront) implemented before F5 Distributed Cloud (Client > CDN > F5 Distributed Cloud > Origin), ensure:\n\nThe Bot Defense JavaScript file is excluded from the cached entities.\n\nThe CDN passes the origin User-Agent rather than injecting CDN User-Agent, such as \"Cloud Front\".\n\nConfigure a Bot Defense Test System in Web App & API Protection\n\nThe following video explains how to set up a basic test system for Bot Defense in Web App & API Protection. To configure a production system, see additional configuration options included in the sections below.\n\nEnable Bot Defense on an HTTP Load Balancer\n\nFrom the Distributed Cloud Console dashboard, click Web App & API Protection.\n\nFrom the navigation menu, confirm that you are in the correct namespace.\n\nClick Manage > Load Balancers > HTTP Load Balancers.\n\nFrom the Actions column, click the Actions (…) menu next to the load balancer where you want to configure Bot Defense and then click Manage Configuration.\n\nClick Edit Configuration and then click Bot Protection.\n\nIn the Bot Protection section, from the Bot Defense drop-down menu, select Enable.\n\nImportant: For load balancers with types “HTTPS with Custom Certificate” and “HTTPS with Automatic Certificate” set the Path normalize field to Enable path normalization. This is the default setting for new load balancer objects.\n\nNext Steps\n\nConfigure protected application endpoints. For information, see the following sections:\n\nTo protect web-based endpoints, see Configure Protected App Endpoints.\n\nTo protect mobile endpoints, see Configure F5 Mobile SDK Settings for WAAP.\n\nConfigure Protected App Endpoints\n\nTo protect web-based endpoints, such as a web page, in the Bot Protection section, perform the following steps:\n\nFrom the Bot Defense Region drop-down menu, select the region where the origin server for the application is located.\n\n(Optional) Enable Show Advanced Fields. In the Timeout field, enter the number of milliseconds Bot Defense should wait for the inference check to complete before timing out. The default value is 1000.\n\nIn the Bot Defense Policy section, click Configure.\n\nIn the Protected App Endpoints section, click Configure and then click Add item.\n\nEnter the following information for each endpoint:\n\nName: Enter the name of the message. Must follow DNS-1035 format.\n\nHTTP Methods: Select the HTTP methods you want to monitor on this endpoint.\n\nANY: Includes GET(XHR/Fetch), POST and PUT. Does not include GET(Document). To select all methods including GET(Document), instead of ANY, you must select each method from the list.\n\nGET(XHR/Fetch): Use when the protected application makes an XHTTPRequest or Fetch API call to get the content of the page. GET requests are protected only if they are sent by XHTTPRequest from a page with Bot Defense JavaScript injected, not from direct navigation using the address bar or link.\n\nPOST\n\nPUT\n\nGET(Document): Use to protect pages on a web site that can be accessible by GET requests without visiting the main page. When you configure an endpoint using GET(Document), Bot Defense displays an interstitial page that is transparent to the user but that allows it to collect telemetry data about the requests. Note that you cannot use GET(Document) with mobile endpoints.\n\nYou can select multiple methods.\n\nNote: If you select both GET(XHR/Fetch) and GET(Document), only GET(XHR/Fetch) requests are monitored. If you need to monitor both methods, add the endpoint separately for each method.\n\nImportant: If you choose to protect all pages and endpoints (/*), F5 recommends that you select specific HTTP methods to monitor and that you do not select the ANY option. Protecting all HTTP methods for all pages can adversely impact performance.\n\nEndpoint Label: F5 strongly recommends that you select endpoint labels to allow more granular attack intent identification and reporting when Bot Defense detects automation.\n\nFor example, to identify a multi-factor authentication flow on an endpoint, select Specify Endpoint label category > Authentication > Login MFA.\n\nFor a full list of available endpoint labels, see Endpoint Labels.\n\nNote: For web scraping labels, select Specify Endpoint label category > Search and select an available flow label.\n\nProtocol: Select the protocols you want to protect. Select HTTP, HTTPS or Both.\n\nDomain Matcher: Specify the domains you want to protect. Enter an exact value, a suffix value, or a regex value.\n\nPath: Enter the path to the endpoint you want to protect. For example, enter /login. Enter a prefix, exact path, or regex value.\n\nTraffic Channel: Select the type of traffic that accesses this endpoint. Select Web Traffic, Mobile Traffic or Web and Mobile Traffic. If you select Web and Mobile Traffic, you must provide a header to distinguish mobile request from web requests. You can use a wildcard (*) in the header value to match a substring.\n\nBot Traffic Mitigation: Specify what action to take when a bot is detected.\n\nBlock: The endpoint returns a status code and message. You can enter a status code and edit the message here.\n\nRedirect: The endpoint forwards the browser to the URI that you specify. You can only select Redirect for web endpoints.\n\nFlag: Allows requests to continue to the origin. Select No headers to create a log record only or select Append Headers to create custom headers for inference and automation type.\n\nGood Bot Detection Settings: Specify whether the mitigation actions you selected above apply to both bad bots and good bots. You can choose to flag good bots but allow them to continue to origin, or you can apply the mitigation actions to all automation. By default, mitigation actions are applied to all automation.\n\nImportant: Good bots, also called benign bots, are bots that perform specific, helpful tasks, such as search engine bots, social media crawlers and aggregator bots. Many of these bots can be useful to your business and therefore you might decide to allow them to continue to origin.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nClick Add Item to add another endpoint or click Apply when you finish adding endpoints.\n\nNext Steps\n\nConfigure how Bot Defense injects JavaScript into your application pages.\n\nConfigure JavaScript Injection\n\nTo protect web-based endpoints, Bot Defense injects JavaScript tags. The Bot Defense JavaScript collects telemetry data about requests to your endpoint. If you configure web-based endpoints, you must configure how the Bot Defense JavaScript tags are injected into the pages that you want to protect.\n\nIn the JavaScript Insertion section:\n\nIn the JavaScript Download Path field, enter the path from where the HTTP load balancer can download the Bot Defense JavaScript to serve to the client browser.\n\nF5 recommends that you choose a URL or path that is similar to your existing JavaScript files, but that does not include “F5,” “Bot Defense” or other indications that it is used for security purposes. Enter a simple path that starts with / or a complete URL such as https://example.com/customer1.js. The URL or path you choose cannot conflict with your existing JavaScript files.\n\nFrom the Web Client JavaScript Mode drop-down menu, determine how the protection JavaScript is loaded into the entry page. The JavaScript is loaded in two parts. The larger part can be loaded in two possible ways:\n\nAsynchronous: The JavaScript runs as soon as it is loaded and does not block the page from loading.\n\nSynchronous: The page does not continue loading until the JavaScript has been loaded and executed.\n\nYou can also choose to cache the larger part of the JavaScript, so it does not have to be downloaded each time it is loaded into a new page.\n\nChoose one of the following options:\n\nAsync JS with no Caching\n\nAsync JS with Caching\n\nSync JS with no Caching\n\nSync JS with Caching\n\nFrom the JavaScript Insertion Settings drop-down menu, specify if the HTTP load balancer should insert JavaScript into all pages, or if some pages should be excluded.\n\nImportant: When you choose the JavaScript location, F5 recommends that you select After <head> so that the Bot Defense JavaScript is executed early. This allows time for the Bot Defense JavaScript to be fetched and executed while the rest of page is rendered. If you select After </title>, be sure your application pages have the <title> tag.\n\nIf you select Insert JavaScript in All Pages, choose where you want to insert the JavaScript:\n\nAfter <head> tag\n\nAfter </title> tag\n\nBefore <script> tag\n\nFigure: Configure JavaScript Injection\n\nIf you select Insert JavaScript in All Pages with the Exceptions:\n\nChoose where you want to insert the JavaScript:\n\nAfter <head> tag\n\nAfter </title> tab\n\nBefore <script> tag\n\nCreate a list of pages where Bot Defense should not insert JavaScript tags:\n\nIn the Exclude Pages section, click Configure and then click Add Item.\n\nEnter the following information for each page in your application where you want to insert the Bot Defense JavaScript.\n\nName: The name of the message. Must follow DNS-1035 format.\n\nDescription: A human-readable description of the endpoint.\n\nDomain Matcher: Specify domains you want to exclude. Enter an exact value, a suffix value, or a regex value.\n\nPath: Specify protected paths here. Enter a prefix, exact path, or regex value.\n\nClick Apply. Click Add Item to add additional JavaScript insertion paths.\n\nWhen you finish configuring JavaScript insertion settings, click Apply.\n\nFigure: Configure JavaScript Injection with Exceptions\n\nInsert JavaScript Tags in specific pages\n\nYou can optionally configure Bot Defense to only insert JavaScript tags in specific pages. Be sure to select paths to HTML pages that end users are likely to visit before they browse to any protected endpoint. In Bot Defense, these are called “entry pages.”\n\nNote: F5 recommends that you use wildcards to select JavaScript insertion paths for HTML pages to which end users are likely to go, such as /index.htm and /login/*.\n\nClick Show Advanced Fields.\n\nFrom the JavaScript Insertion Settings drop-down menu, select Custom JavaScript Insertion Rules.\n\nUse the descriptions above to configure the JavaScript Insertions and Exclude Paths sections.\n\nDisable JavaScript Insertion\n\nIf necessary, you can optionally disable JavaScript insertion.\n\nClick Show Advanced Fields.\n\nFrom the JavaScript Insertion Rules drop-down menu, select Disable JavaScript Insertion.\n\nClick Apply and then click Apply again.\n\nNote: When you select Disable JavaScript Insertion, you are required to have a value in the JavaScript Download Path and Web Client JavaScript Mode fields even though Bot Defense ignores the actual values in those fields.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf you configured mobile endpoints, you must you must configure F5 Mobile SDK settings for WAAP. The F5 mobile SDK must be integrated with your mobile application to route requests to Bot Defense for inspection.\n\nIf you did not configure mobile endpoints, you do not need to configure the F5 Mobile SDK settings and can test Bot Defense to make sure it is handling requests to your web endpoints correctly. For information, see Verify that Bot Defense is injecting JavaScript tags in your application pages.\n\nConfigure F5 Mobile SDK Settings for WAAP\n\nImportant: Before you configure mobile settings, see Protect Mobile Endpoints for important best practices, required configuration, and information about integrating the F5 Mobile SDK with your mobile endpoints.\n\nIf you added a mobile endpoint in the Protected App Endpoints section, you must enable the F5 Mobile SDK and specify a specific header for mobile requests. If you did not add any mobile endpoints, then you do not need to configure F5 Mobile SDK settings.\n\nIn the Mobile SDK Settings section, click Show Advanced Fields.\n\nFrom the Mobile SDK Settings drop-down menu, select Mobile SDK Configuration.\n\nFigure: Configure Mobile SDK Settings\n\nIn the Mobile Traffic Identifier section, click Add Item.\n\nEnter a Header Name to identify mobile requests. The header name is case sensitive.\n\nFrom the Match Options drop-down menu, select one of the following options:\n\nPresent: Matches only if a header is present.\n\nNot Present: Matches only if a header is not present.\n\nMatch Values: Click Add Item to enter an exact value or a regex value. You can enter multiple values. When you finish adding values to match, click Apply.\n\nIf you selected Match Values, click Show Advanced Fields. From the Transformers drop-down menu, optionally select any transformers, such as converting the path to lower case or removing blank spaces, that you want to apply to your paths before matching. Transformers are applied in the order you add them.\n\nFigure: Configure Mobile Header\n\nWhen you finish configuring SDK settings, click Apply.\n\nNext Steps\n\nMake sure you have configured Bot Defense correctly. For information, see Test your Bot Defense configuration.\n\nEnable Bot Defense on BIG-IP v14-16 (iApp Connector)\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you deploy or upgrade an iApp in the F5 BIG-IP system, you must meet the following requirements:\n\nYou have access to the F5 Distributed Cloud Console to download the latest iApp template.\n\nYou have BIG-IP versions 14.1 or later.\n\nNote: The Distributed Cloud Bot Defense iApp template is required for BIG-IP versions 14 to 16.

Enter a simple path that starts with / or a complete URL such as https://example.com/customer1.js. The URL or path you choose cannot conflict with your existing JavaScript files.\n\nIf you require Manual JavaScript Insertion, add the following tags to one of the recommended locations:\n\nImmediately after <head>\n\nImmediately after </title>\n\nBefore <script> (first script tag on the page).\n\nMatcher Config JavaScript:\n\n<script type='text/javascript' src='INJECTION_PATH?matcher'></script>​\n\nI/O Hook JavaScript​:\n\n<script type='text/javascript' src='INJECTION_PATH?cache'></script>​\n\nAsync Telemetry JavaScript​:\n\n<script type='text/javascript' src='INJECTION_PATH?async' async></script>​\n\nReplace INJECTION PATH with the value you specified for Web Client JavaScript Path.\n\nF5 XC Bot Defense Protected Endpoints Configuration\n\nSpecify pages and sources on the website that should be protected by Bot Defense.\n\nThe Mitigation Handler field is informational only. You do not need to make any changes to this field.\n\nIf you previously enabled F5 XC Bot Defense Mobile SDK support, select the type of client requests that should be inspected and then mitigated by F5 XC Bot Defense: Web, MSDK (Mobile Client), or Both (Web and Mobile).\n\nNote: If you select Both, you must provide a header which distinguishes Mobile requests from Web. For example:\n\nUser-Agent: Android 10; MyApp/1.0\n\nUser-Agent: Android 9; MyApp/2.0\n\nX-App-Version: 4.1\n\nX-App-Version: 4.3\n\nThe specified header value can use a wildcard (*) to match a substring.\n\nIn the Host field, enter the host domain of the protected endpoint. For example, enter identity. <your domain>.com.\n\nIn the Path field, enter the path to the endpoint. The path must meet the following requirements:\n\nOnly uses lowercase letters.\n\nStarts with ‘/’. For example, enter /login/.\n\nCan use glob patterns: * ? [ ].\n\nCloses any open bracket [ with ].\n\nBrackets must include only valid URL characters.\n\nDoes not specify /* as a protected URL.\n\nUses / to protect the root.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample 1: /application/version[0-9]/login\n\nExample 2: /myapp/service/*\n\nExample 3: /*/login.aspx\n\nExample 4: /api/*/connection/*/*\n\nExample 5: /api/connection/[a-zA-Z0-9_]*/set*\n\n(Optional) In the Query field, if you want to protect specific sections of a page, enter the criteria for the section you want to protect.\n\nFor example, if the query string of a URI you want to protect is <yourdomain>/account.do/issue? account=moneytransfer, enter the parameter name and parameter value ‘account=moneytransfer’ to protect the “moneytransfer” function.\n\nWhen you enter a Query parameter, the Bot Defense service looks at the Path and Query values. The Query field is regex matched.\n\nChoose the HTTP Methods are monitored on this endpoint. You must set at least one of the options to Yes. HTTP requests are not routed if no methods are set to Yes.\n\nSelect Yes or No for each of the following methods:\n\nANY: Select Yes to protect the path with any type of method. Select No to limit protection to only certain methods.\n\nGET: Select Yes to protect the path when it has a GET method.\n\nPOST: Select Yes to protect the path when it has a POST method.\n\nPUT: Select Yes to protect the path when it has a PUT method.\n\nImportant: If you choose to protect all pages and endpoints (/*), F5 recommends that you select specific HTTP methods to monitor and that you do not select the ANY option. Protecting all HTTP methods for all pages can adversely impact performance.\n\nIn the Action drop-down menu, select the mitigation action you want to take for this endpoint if Bot Defense detects automation:\n\nContinue (request continues to origin). For reporting purposes, you can optionally add a header to capture traffic that is going to the origin. You provide the header name in the Define Mitigation Actions section.\n\nImportant: When you initially deploy the iApp connector, F5 recommends that you set mitigation action to Continue for the first 24-48 hours and then monitor the system to confirm that it is functioning properly.\n\nRedirect. The Bot is sent to a different page. You provide the URL where the Bot is redirected later in the Define Mitigation Actions section. The redirect must go to:\n\nAn absolute URL, for example, https://acme.com/redirect.html\n\nA domain that you own.\n\nBlock. The Bot is presented with a message that it has been blocked. You provide the Response Code and Body of the response message later in the Define Mitigation Actions section.\n\nDrop. This is not a valid selection. If you select Drop, Bot Defense defaults to Block.\n\nWhen you select mitigation actions, you must be aware of the following important information:\n\nClient TypeValid ActionsAdditional InformationMSDK (mobile)Continue, Block-- Redirect and Drop are visible but are not valid actions.

Otherwise, Bot Defense treats the endpoints as a web endpoint by default.\n\nIf your endpoint type is Web, then you do not need to choose a setting. This field is ignored for web endpoints.\n\nSpecify whether you want to ignore letter case while matching request paths. If you select Yes, letter case is ignored when matching the path of a request URL. If you select No then matching is case sensitive.\n\nFigure: iApp Connector Protected Endpoint Configuration screen\n\nSelect Add to add additional protected endpoints.\n\nAfter you finish adding endpoints, all protected endpoints are displayed in a table. You can modify or delete endpoints.\n\nWeb-Scraping Protection Endpoints\n\nConfigure web scraping protection for documents and pages on a web site that is accessible by GET requests without visiting the main page, for example, from a link on social media, from an email or from a saved bookmark. This direct access to resources prevents Bot Defense from inserting the protection JavaScript. When you configure an endpoint for web scraping, Bot Defense displays an interstitial page that is transparent to the user but that allows it to collect telemetry data about the requests.\n\nThe Mitigation Handler field is informational only. You do not need to make any changes to this field.\n\nIn the Host field, enter the host domain of the protected endpoint.\n\nIn the Path field, enter the path to the endpoint.

If you select Yes, letter case is ignored when matching the path of a request URL. If you select No then matching is case sensitive.\n\nFigure: iApp Connector Web Scraping Configuration screen\n\nDefine Mitigation Actions\n\nIn the Specify redirect path field, enter the URL to which you want to redirect Bots when you select Redirect as a mitigation action.\n\nIn the Specify ‘Block’ response fields, enter a Response Code and then enter the body of the response message that you want to send to malicious traffic if you specify Block as a mitigation action. You must include the correct HTML tags in the body of the response.\n\nWhen you select Continue as a mitigation response, specify whether you want to add a header to requests that provides F5 XC Bot Defense information. If you select Yes, add an F5 XC Bot Defense info header to requests sent to origin, then specify the header.\n\nFigure: iApp Connector Define Mitigation Actions screen\n\nAllow-listed Entities\n\nOptionally, create an Allow List that allows requests to reach the origin destination without being evaluated by Bot Defense. You are not charged for request that are not evaluated by the Bot Defense Engine. You can create a list by IP Address or by request headers.\n\nTo specify an IP Address Allowlist, in the IP field, enter the IP addresses you want to allow. Click Add after you enter each IP address.\n\nSpecify if you want to Use advanced header matching.\n\nIf you select Yes, Bot Defense uses regex to match the header name and value.\n\nIf you select No, then header names are matched exactly as you specify and header values are matches using simple * and ? wildcards.\n\nHeader name matching is always case insensitive.\n\nTo specify an HTTP Header Allowlist, enter a Name and Value for each header you want to allow. Click Add after you enter each name and value.\n\nFigure: iApp Connector Allow List screen\n\nApplication Virtual Servers\n\nIn the Application Virtual Servers section, select the application virtual servers that you want to assign to your iApp. You iApp does not run if it is not assigned to at least one virtual server.\n\nNote: You create virtual servers in BIG-IP. For information, see your BIG-IP documentation.\n\nKnow the following about selecting a virtual server:\n\nThe virtual server you select must have an HTTP profile attached to it.\n\nThe virtual server you select must have a default pool attached to it.\n\nF5 recommends that each protected server have a Client SSL profile and SNAT profile, but these are not required.\n\nNote: If you have deployed an application on an iApp using a virtual server, you cannot deploy Bot Defense on an iApp using the same virtual server. You must choose a different virtual server.\n\nF5 XC Defense Engine API Service Settings.\n\nDefine the API settings that allow you to route traffic to the Bot Defense engine and define pools.\n\nThe Application ID is automatically populated in the template.\n\nEnter a Timeout value for API response. The default is 700 milliseconds.
