        "text": "Each new passenger motor vehicle must be labeled with the following six items of information:\n\nThe percentage U.S./Canadian equipment (parts) content;\n\nThe names of any countries other than the U.S. and Canada which individually contribute 15 percent or more of the equipment content, and the percentage content for each such country (a maximum of two countries);\n\nThe final assembly point by city and state (where appropriate), and country;\n\nThe country of origin of the engine;\n\nThe country of origin of the transmission; and\n\nA statement which explains that parts content does not include final assembly (except the engine and transmission), distribution, or other non-parts costs.\n\nThe percentage U.S./Canada equipment content, as well as content percentages for other countries are calculated on a \"carline\" basis rather than for each individual vehicle and may be rounded to the nearest 5 percent. The term \"carline\" refers to a name of a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction, e.g., body and chassis. Light duty trucks are considered to be different carlines than passenger cars. A carline includes all motor vehicles of a given nameplate.\n\nVehicle manufacturers must calculate the equipment content percentages for their carlines prior to the beginning of the model year. They estimate the number of vehicles and subgroups of vehicles that will be built within each carline, e.g., the number of base level and high-line models. For each carline, the calculation of U.S./Canadian content percentage also includes:\n\nThe U.S./Canadian content (by value) of each item of motor vehicle equipment that will be used to assemble the vehicles within the carline;\n\nThe total value of each equipment item, i.e., the price the manufacturer will pay for it (this information is typically provided by the manufacturer's suppliers); and\n\nThe total number of each of the equipment items that will be used to assemble the vehicles within the car line during the model year.\n\nWhen optional equipment is offered for vehicles within the carline, the vehicle manufacturer estimates the installation rates for that equipment. For example, if vehicles are offered with a manual and automatic transmission, the manufacturer will estimate how many vehicles will be built with each transmission.\n\nThe label must be placed in a prominent location on each vehicle where it can be read from the exterior of the vehicle with the doors closed. It may be part of the Monroney price information label, part of the fuel economy label, or a separate label.\n\nThe tables that follow list information that was submitted to NHTSA by vehicle manufacturers. The tables include what we believe is the most important information that is displayed on the labels, i.e., the percentage of U.S./Canadian content; whether the vehicles within the carline are passenger cars or other vehicle types, e.g., multipurpose passenger vehicles or MPVs; and where they are manufactured, in the U.S./Canada, elsewhere, or in some cases both. A vehicle's type can be found on its certification label located on the driver's door or door jam.\n\nIn addition, NHTSA has other information about safety equipment and systems that are standard or optional equipment on new vehicles at NHTSA.gov. Also included on the website are data from the agency's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) including the relative frontal and side crash protection in new vehicles as well as a vehicle's likelihood to roll over from a single vehicle crash. Information on vehicles that NHTSA has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained by calling the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236.\n\nIf you want to review the original submission from the manufacturers or request research done on the Part 583 submissions, please contact the NHTSA Technical Information Services (TIS). The TIS Reading Room (E12-100) is open to the public during the hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time). Users may visit the Reading Room to perform their own research. TIS staff members are on duty to assist users. Due to security, have the guard call our Reference Desk at 202-366-2588 for an escort.\n\nThose unable to visit TIS in person but requiring extensive searches of the collections are requested to put the details of their requirements in writing, authorizing a fee search for which they agree to make payment. Customers should also provide a daytime telephone number where they may be contacted. This request can be made by mail to the address shown below, or by e-mail to: tis@nhtsa.dot.gov, however the material will be mailed as indicated below.\n\nThe address is:\n\nTechnical Information Services (NPO-411)\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\n1200 New Jersey Avenue SE.\n\nEast Building (E12-100)\n\nWashington, DC 20590\n\nThe telephone number is 888-327-4236, and is answered by Vehicle Safety Hotline representatives in order to provide general assistance. However, any specific reference requests must be made in order for TIS to be able to log in and assign it to an analyst for response. The fax number (202-493-2833) may be used to submit requests to TIS, but TIS will respond by mail or courier. The following link describes TIS Services and associated fees. Also described is the TIS Reading Room, where visitors can view and/or copy documents and files."
