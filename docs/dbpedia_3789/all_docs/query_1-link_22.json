        "text": "Why Your Agency Needs a Web Analytics Report Template\n\nMost digital marketing and social media marketing campaigns are designed to drive website traffic to your clients’ sites and sell more products or services, but many of today's web analytics tools add more complexity than clarity.\n\nMake website data more accessible to your clients with dedicated web analytics report templates that clearly show what marketing activities your agency is doing to drive their success.\n\nAgencyAnalytics automatically compiles metrics from different data sources so that agencies don’t have to spend hours to create a web analytics report manually on platforms like Google Analytics. Include all of the important information in your customized marketing report template, where you add your own analysis and discussion points for each client. Alternatively, use the web analytics dashboard to display the data in real time.\n\nA web analytics report helps demonstrate how your agency is spending your client’s money and how you’re going to capitalize on your successes. It also helps formulate data-driven solutions for how to fix things that aren’t going well in the campaign and present those to your client in an easy and intuitive way.\n\n8 Sections Included In the Web Analytics Report Template\n\nA detailed and well-structured web analytics report is a time-saving necessity. The Web Analytics Report template is crafted to provide an in-depth view of your client's online performance by automatically pulling the most important data from Google's web analytics tool. This report is a strategic resource that significantly elevates the understanding of website visitors and their interactions with a website.\n\nThis web analytics report includes 8 crucial sections, each designed to offer valuable insights into different aspects of a client's web analytics. By integrating data from their Google Analytics account, this report template seamlessly brings together complex data in an easy-to-understand format. From tracking user journeys to scrutinizing the number of pages viewed, each section serves a unique purpose in painting a comprehensive picture of a larger marketing strategy. Let's get started.\n\n1. Cover Page\n\nThink of a Web Analytics Report as a detailed roadmap to website performance and user engagement. Use the Report Cover and Section Design Customization Feature to apply a background color or upload a custom image matching your agency's professional brand. Additional customization through title and image widgets allows for a cohesive branding approach throughout the report's content.\n\nWhen a design truly aligns with your brand, save it. Doing so ensures a uniform brand presentation and simplifies the creation process for future reports.\n\nThe cover page is one page that serves a key function: it establishes the context for the high-quality analysis that follows. More than a visual entry point, it's a direct reflection of your agency's expertise. By setting the tone right at the beginning and then carrying it throughout your report, you subtly enhance your agency's credibility and nurture a positive client relationship.\n\n2. Monthly Summary\n\nThe monthly write-up section gives you a free space to give clients your own personal analysis and summary of what’s happening on their website. Use this section of the report to maintain that relationship with your clients by discussing goals, deliverables, and results in plain English.\n\nTalk about exactly what you did during a specific date range, perhaps the last month, to push you and your client’s goals forward. Clients appreciate real-world data and examples, which should be placed in this section. Use this space to present new strategies to your clients and iterations on existing strategies so they know just what you’re doing to maximize their ROI, save money, as well as trends that help show the bigger picture.\n\n3. All Channels\n\nTraffic comes to your client’s website from any number of channels, and this section displays all of the statistics related to these different traffic sources. You’ll see where traffic is coming in from each data source – search metrics, direct linking, referrals and social media – as well as key metrics like bounce rate and conversion rate.\n\nThis is a comprehensive section of the report that may get overwhelming for some clients, so make sure you give them a clear and succinct explanation of what they’re seeing in their web analytics metrics and how you’re acting upon them. For example:\n\n4. Devices\n\nIt’s important to know what devices potential customers are using to visit your client’s website. This section of the report displays a list of device names customers along with their average session duration, bounce rate and number of goal completions. It’s no secret that more and more customers are using mobile devices to browse the web, and you can see that directly in the Devices section of the Google Analytics report.\n\nUse this section to show your clients exactly where potential customers browsing their site are coming from. This is valuable information you can use to push your clients to a more mobile-friendly configuration if they aren’t already.\n\n5. Location/Geographic\n\nReprot templates that include a Location/Geographic section gives you and your client a deeper look into the demographics of the people visiting your client’s web pages in a specific time frame.\n\nYou’ll also be able to see specific user behavior and conversion rates for each location, which can be insightful. Use this section to see how many people from different locations visit the site, how long they stay and how many of them convert in the end.\n\nThese metrics tell your client how you’re leveraging different geographic locations to drive more conversions and what you can do better in areas that aren’t performing well.\n\nHere’s how these insights can be strategically employed:\n\nFor example, if there are site visitors in a specific city that have a high bounce rate, maybe there is misleading content on their web pages regarding addresses or services. Explaining the user journey with geographic-specific insights helps guide new strategies.\n\n6. Organic Search\n\nThis section of the web analytics report pulls data from a Google Analytics account. It shows the traffic and related metrics around organic search. You’ll also get to see which keywords perform the best in terms of conversions to help inform organic search marketing efforts .\n\nUse this section to drive your SEO strategy with your client. Incorporating top KPIs in custom web analytics reports is the best way to prove the value of your SEO services, by showing them the specific data points like direct conversions from organic traffic.\n\nIf you're specializing in SEO be sure to check out our SEO report template too!\n\n7. Ecommerce\n\nThe ecommerce section of the web analytics report template displays all of the relevant key performance indicators for your client’s online shop. You’ll be able to tell which products are selling the best and what kind of revenue your client is earning from each product from the landing pages on their ecommerce site.\n\nUse this section to start a discussion with your clients about focusing on specific products in new ad campaigns in the future.\n\nThen, build a marketing strategy to either capitalize on popularity or drive more customers to products that aren’t selling as well.\n\n8. Paid Search\n\nWith paid search, you use pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns to display your ads on a client’s search engine results page (SERP) before any of the other results.\n\nAgain, like the other sections on this web analytics report template, the Paid Search (PPC) sections gives your clients a more in-depth look at the success or failure of your PPC campaigns.\n\nYou’ll be able to see how much traffic each campaign is driving and what kind of goal conversions are coming from them. Use a Google Analytics report template as an opportunity to make informed decisions and strategize with your clients, maximizing revenue and goal conversion rate.\n\nTake their PPC reporting section one step further and include information on their paid Facebook Ads or email marketing initiatives. This helps you track leads different sources and paint a full picture of what is driving results and selling products most effectively.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nAgencyAnalytics is automatically collecting data that your clients care about in one, easy-to-understand report template. It pulls data from over 80 marketing channels like Google Analytics, Facebook, and more, giving your clients a full SEO report of their marketing key performance indicators. The time spent manually pulling clients' marketing data and updating spreadsheets is put toward analyzing data and driving more results.\n\nClients want to know about their website development, where their web traffic is coming from, and customer satisfaction. Website analytics tools, like Google Analytics, show exactly how their marketing campaigns are performing and provide actionable insights to make the necessary improvements resulting in more conversions."
