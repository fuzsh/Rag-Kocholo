        "text": "It's the law! (Alaska Statute Title 28, Chapter 35, Article 2, Section 28.35.080 (b))\n\nIn motor vehicle crashes where the damage is less than a certain dollar amount, no apparent significant injuries occurred, and police or local law enforcement jurisdiction did not investigate, Alaska developed the driver report (Form 12-209) to provide the user a way to self-report a crash and provide documentation to his or her insurance company.\n\nAs well, Alaska Statute Title 28, Chapter 22, Article 1, Section 28.22.021 requires the owner or operator of a motor vehicle to provide proof of motor vehicle liability insurance when that person is involved in an accident that results in bodily injury to or death of a person, or damage to the property of a person exceeding $501.\n\nYou must complete and submit these reports electronically to the Division of Motor Vehicles using the links above.\n\nThe 12-209 crash report information is used by the Alaska Department of Transportation (DOT) to identify sections of the road system that experience higher numbers of motor vehicle crashes. These higher crash areas are then proposed for capital improvement projects that improve road safety. The 12-209 crash form also includes the same information that the COI requests. When a motor vehicle crash results in no personal injury or results in property damage between $501 and $2,000, completing the 12-209 provides valuable crash and location information that helps DOT and still meets the requirement for proof of liability insurance to DMV shown above. Please consider completing the 12-209 in lieu of the stand-alone COI."
