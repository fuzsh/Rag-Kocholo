        "text": "Diversely sourced, uniquely cross-referenced traffic speed and incident data, custom-delivered\n\nClearData™ is the enhanced mobility data output of the Iteris ClearMobility™ Cloud data analytics engine, which aggregates and validates proprietary and diversely sourced mobility data such as incident, speed and connected vehicle probes, and then delivers it as ClearData to public- and private-sector clients via subscription-based direct computer data feeds or application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\nIn some cases, ClearData is also augmented by experienced Iteris traffic analysts to resolve data conflicts other traffic software platforms typically miss. The resulting data feeds are extremely reliable, accurate and current, eliminating redundancies and other errors for best-in-class traffic pattern analysis, forecasting and planning.\n\nValidated Incident Data\n\nDerived from over 200 sources of accident, construction and traffic impact events, ClearData Incident Feeds are delivered as real-time incident data feeds or as a historical incident archive.\n\nClearData Incident Feeds are created from public sources, agencies, media partners and verified crowdsourced data with an extensive historical incident archive and real-time incident event tracking.\n\nDynamic Speed Data\n\nDerived from over three billion GPS probe points analyzed in real time each day, Clear Data Speed Feeds include speed and travel time data, and are delivered as historical and predictive data feeds.\n\nClear Data Speed Feeds are created from a broad combination of connected vehicles, mobile applications, Bluetooth and roadside sensors, as well as from the historical impacts of weather and an extensive archive of speed trends.\n\nData Types Are Cross-Referenced\n\nThe complex, dynamic nature of roadway traffic cannot be explained by any single data source. Speed data without incident and historical data for context can lead to critical mistakes. By cross-referencing Iteris’ distinct data sets, ClearData avoids erroneous road closure reporting through algorithmic closure validation reviews. For example, incident reports from agencies can help override deceptive or misunderstood flow data.\n\nThe Iteris Difference\n\n200 +\n\nData sources\n\n160\n\n+\n\nsources of accident, construction and traffic impact events\n\nIteris identifies redundant reports by monitoring traditional and social media, satellite radio, state 511 and local agency information to integrate and standardize incident and speed data.\n\n3 bn\n\nProbe data\n\n0\n\nbn\n\nGPS probe points\n\nClearData is created from connected vehicle, commercial fleet and mobile GPS probes. As such, it avoids legacy probe bias toward commercial trips that can be off-road or on non-mapped roads. Connected vehicle probes offer a more accurate type of GPS data, as they better reflect consumer vehicle movement.\n\n24/7 /7\n\nData Reliability\n\n24/7\n\n/7\n\nsoftware-driven conflict detection\n\nWhen required, the ClearData validation process leverages Iteris expert staff analysis of historical patterns and of the incidents themselves. The unique combination of software-driven event detection and conflict resolution overseen by human editors provides unparalleled mobility reporting, mapping and advisory information.\n\nClearData Feeds\n\nSpeed Data Feeds\n\nEstimate of current real-time road speeds in the US and Canada, available in geographic territories and road segment categories\n\nHistorical Data\n\nArchive of road speeds and trends derived from real-time speeds available through seasonal and daypart filters\n\nPredictive Data Feed\n\nProjection of near-future road speeds that adds influence of current reports of incidents, events and weather to the historical speed trends\n\nIncident Data Feed\n\nCurated and normalized reports of accidents, roadworks, events and other incidents currently impacting traffic flow in the US and Canada\n\nHistorical Incident Archive\n\nMulti-year archive of incident data available through seasonal and geographic filters\n\nGeographic Feed Options\n\nData can be focused or parsed based on location and need\n\nSchedule a Demo\n\nTalk to Us"
