        "text": "NHTSA's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards regulate how far our vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. NHTSA sets CAFE standards for passenger cars and for light trucks (collectively, light-duty vehicles), and separately sets fuel consumption standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines. NHTSA also regulates the fuel-economy window stickers on new vehicles. This site contains information about many aspects of these programs, and we encourage you to check back as new information is posted.\n\nJune 7, 2024: NHTSA Announces Final Rule for CAFE and HDPUV Standards\n\nModel Years 2027-2031 Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards and Model Years 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Standards\n\nAfter reviewing the tens of thousands of public comments submitted on NHTSA’s August 2023 proposal for MYs 2027-2031 Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards and MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans (HDPUV) Fuel Efficiency Standards and the accompanying Draft Environmental Impact Statement, NHTSA announced the final CAFE and HDPUV standards. The final rule establishes standards that would require an industry-wide fleet average of approximately 50.4 miles per gallon (mpg) in MY 2031 for passenger cars and light trucks, and an industry fleet-wide average for HDPUVs of roughly 2.851 gallons per 100 miles in MY 2035. The final CAFE standards increase at a rate of 2 percent per year for passenger cars in MYs 2027-31 and 2 percent per year for light trucks in model years 2029-31. The final HDPUV fuel efficiency standards increase at a rate of 10 percent per year in MYs 2030-2032 and 8 percent per year in MYs 2033-2035.\n\nThe agency projects the final standards will save consumers nearly $23 billion in fuel costs and avoid the consumption of about 70 billion gallons of gasoline (equivalent) through 2050. The agency also projects the standards will prevent more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, reduce air pollution, and reduce the country’s dependence on oil. The final standards provide critical savings at the gas pump for American consumers and set goals that are consistent with Congress' direction to conserve energy and provide flexibility to industry on how best to meet those goals from proven, available fuel-saving technologies.\n\nLight-Duty Vehicles\n\nFinal Rule: CAFE Standards for MYs 2027-2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Fuel Efficiency Standards for MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans\n\nPress Release\n\nFinal Rule\n\nCorrection notice published July 29, 2024\n\nFinal Technical Support Document\n\nFinal Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\nAnalysis\n\nAppendix I – Passenger Car and Light Truck Standard Setting Runs\n\nAppendix II – Passenger Car and Light Truck EIS Runs\n\nAppendix III – HDPUV Runs\n\nFinal Environmental Impact Statement\n\nSummary\n\nComplete Final EIS\n\nAppendices\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nCAFE Model\n\nOther Technical Work Supporting the Final Rule\n\nData Visualization Tool\n\nThe Data Visualization Tool has been updated to include visualizations of fuel consumed over time (by fuel type, alternative, and vehicle regulatory class) and greenhouse gas emissions over time (by upstream and tailpipe sources, fuel type, alternative, and regulatory class). Note: This data visualization tool presents existing information in the FRIA and CAFE Model output files in an easy-to-use dashboard and does not create or provide any new data beyond what is already included in the proposal and related materials.\n\nNPRM: Proposed CAFE Standards for MYs 2027-2032 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Fuel Efficiency Standards for MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans\n\nPress Release\n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nNPRM; correction notice published August 25, 2023\n\nDraft Technical Support Document\n\nPreliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\nAnalysis\n\nAppendix I – Passenger Car and Light Truck Standard Setting Runs\n\nAppendix II – Passenger Car and Light Truck EIS Runs\n\nAppendix III – HDPUV Runs\n\nDraft Environmental Impact Statement\n\nSummary\n\nComplete Draft EIS\n\nAppendices\n\nNotice of Intent to Prepare an EIS (published August 16, 2022)\n\nCAFE Model\n\nOther Technical Work Supporting the Proposal\n\nData Visualization Tool\n\nThe Data Visualization Tool has been updated to include visualizations of fuel consumed over time (by fuel type, alternative, and vehicle regulatory class) and greenhouse gas emissions over time (by upstream and tailpipe sources, fuel type, alternative, and regulatory class).

PIC allows researchers, analysts, media, and the public to easily access dynamic data about how manufacturers are complying with NHTSA’s fuel efficiency programs and provides self-service portals for easy access to the data. For manufacturers, PIC provides the most up-to-date resource tools for compliance. Public information is routinely updated on PIC to provide timely, reliable compliance data, which can be viewed in reports, and interactive table and graph formats. The interactive data can be easily sorted and filtered based on specific areas of interest to produce custom reports, which can also be downloaded as Excel or PDF files. NHTSA will add reports and additional resources for manufacturers to PIC sites as regulations and needs arise.\n\nPublic Information Center\n\nCAFE and Fuel Efficiency Updates\n\nFebruary 20, 2024: This final decision responds to petitions filed by several low-volume manufacturers requesting exemption from the generally applicable corporate average fuel economy standards for several model years.\n\nDecember 13, 2022: A new compliance report for NHTSA’s heavy-duty (HD) fuel consumption program covering MY 2013-2020 vehicles is available in CAFE's public information center.\n\nRulemaking on Civil Penalty Rate\n\nMarch 25, 2022: NHTSA final rule withdrawing the January 2021 interim final rule and reverting to the December 2016 final rule, restoring the application of the increased CAFE civil penalty rate as mandated by Congress beginning with Model Year 2019, instead of Model Year 2022.\n\nCAFE Civil Penalty Final Rule\n\nPrevious Rulemaking\n\nAugust 17, 2021: NHTSA supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comment on whether NHTSA should proceed to a final rule that withdraws the January 2021 interim final rule and reverts to the December 2016 final rule, restoring the application of the increased CAFE civil penalty rate beginning with model year 2019, instead of model year 2022.\n\nCAFE Civil Penalty Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nJanuary 14, 2021: NHTSA interim final rule adjusts the CAFE civil penalty rate to $14 beginning in model year 2022; if the August 31, 2020, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Case No. 19-2395 is vacated, however, the rate will remain at $5.50 instead.\n\nCAFE Civil Penalty Interim Final Rule\n\nJuly 12, 2019: NHTSA final rule retains the $5.50 penalty rate applicable to automobile manufacturers that fail to meet CAFE standards.\n\nCAFE Civil Penalties Final Rule\n\nOMB Concurrence re Negative Economic Impact\n\nOMB Concurrence re Non-Applicability of Inflation Adjustment Act\n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)\n\nHeavy-Duty Vehicles\n\nNHTSA Announces Final Rule for HDPUV Standards\n\nJune 7, 2024: NHTSA finalizes new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans (commonly referred to as class 2b and class 3 vehicles) built in model years 2030-2035.\n\nMarch 15, 2024: NHTSA finalizes technical amendments to the test procedures for heavy-duty engines and vehicles to improve accuracy and reduce testing burden.\n\nPhase 2\n\nThe compliance dates for NHTSA’s fuel efficiency regulations, to the extent they apply to truck trailers, are currently stayed, pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued on September 29, 2020 in case No. 16-1430.\n\nFinal Rule for Phase 2 fuel efficiency and GHG emissions standards for medium- & heavy-duty vehicles, MY2018-2027\n\nFinal Rule\n\nFinal Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\nFinal Environmental Impact Statement\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement Summary\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement Appendices\n\nResponse to Comments\n\nCompliance and Effects Modeling System\n\nDocuments relating to the Phase 2 proposal for medium- & heavy-duty vehicles, MY 2018-2027\n\nTrailer Fact Sheet\n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\nCAFE Model for HD Pickups and Vans\n\nResearch supporting Phase 2 proposal\n\nSubmit comments to docket NHTSA-2014-0132\n\nPhase 1\n\nPhase 1 of Fuel Efficiency and GHG Emission Program for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Trucks, MYs 2014-2018\n\nTechnical Amendments\n\nPartial Withdrawal of Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle, and Nonroad Technical Amendments\n\nHeavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle, and Nonroad Technical Amendments\n\nFinal Rule\n\nFinal rule\n\nCorrecting Amendments for Base Tire Definition\n\nFinal Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\nNEPA Process\n\nFinal Environmental Impact Statement\n\nSummary cover sheet\n\nFEIS summary\n\nFEIS complete report\n\nAppendices\n\nDraft Environmental Impact Statement\n\nSummary\n\nAppendices\n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nCorrection Notice for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\nNHTSA Study: Factors and Considerations for Establishing a Fuel Efficiency Regulatory Improvement Program for Commercial Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles\n\nNotice of Public Hearings for Proposal\n\nNAS Study: Technologies and Approaches to Reducing the Fuel Consumption of Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles\n\nFuel Economy and Environment Label\n\nNHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that will be posted on the window sticker of all new automobiles sold in the U.S.\n\nLearn More"
