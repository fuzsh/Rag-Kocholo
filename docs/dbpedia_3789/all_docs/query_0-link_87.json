        "text": "With Wix Analytics traffic reports you can find out how visitors find and navigate around your site. Drill down into your reports to answer questions like \"How many people visited my site through a marketing email in the last 30 days?\"\n\nAnalyze your site traffic over time or during a specific time of the day. You can also see which locations, devices, and site pages are bringing the most viewers to your site.\n\nFiltering your own visits from traffic reports:\n\nIf you are logged into your Wix account, any visits you make to your own site using the same device & browser won't be counted in traffic reports.\n\nNote: Other metrics outside traffic reports (e.g. store orders, event RSVPs, post likes and comments) still include your interaction(s) as the site owner. For example, the number of times you view a blog post is still counted in the total post views.\n\nIf you wish to exclude a specific IP address from your traffic reports, please vote for this feature and we'll keep you updated.\n\nHow to access your traffic reports\n\nGo to Reports in your site's dashboard.\n\nScroll down to the Traffic Reports section.\n\nSelect the report you'd like to view.\n\nIn this article, learn more about:\n\nTypes of traffic reports\n\nClick a report type to learn more about it.\n\nTraffic over time\n\nLearn which days or months get the most traffic on your site. Use this report to identify trends in traffic over different time periods.\n\nTraffic by time of day\n\nSee which time of the day is most active for site visitors. The heat map displays the hours people are most visiting your site. The darker the color, the more people are viewing\n\nTip: If you have Wix Chat on your site or are deciding on business hours, use the data in this report to make sure you are available during peak periods.\n\nTraffic by entry page\n\nSee which site page visitors land on first when entering your site.\n\nTip: Make sure the most important call-to-actions are visible on the pages that visitors are landing on the most.\n\nTraffic by location\n\nSee where in the world you are getting the most traffic. You can filter the information by country map or city map.\n\nUse this report to:\n\nOptimize your marketing efforts or paid campaigns to the locations where you are getting more traffic.\n\nPrioritize locations where you want to increase your marketing presence.\n\nNote on location accuracy: We are working on improving the accuracy of traffic by location reports. In isolated cases, you may see inaccurate city names, or ‘N/A’ where the information from IP addresses is untrusted or unknown. Site traffic received through VPN, anonymizers, cloud providers, and bots can affect the accuracy of this data.\n\nTraffic by device\n\nSee if people are viewing your site from desktop, tablet, or mobile.\n\nUse this report to:\n\nMake sure your site on mobile is up-to-date and functions for your mobile visitors.\n\nCreate offers and content that are targeted to specific devices.\n\nNew vs. Returning visitors\n\nSee how much site traffic comes from new visitors vs. visitors who have viewed your site before. You can use this report to tailor marketing activities and promotions to visitors at different stages.\n\nFAQs\n\nClick a question below to learn more about Wix Analytics traffic reports.\n\nHow do I switch views within a report?\n\nClick the relevant tab at the top of the report to access different chart types: Line/Bar Chart, Line/Bar Chart Split, or Table.\n\nNote: Depending on the traffic report you may see different viewing options such as Heat Map or City or Country Map.\n\nHow do I view report definitions?\n\nClick into a report and then click View report definitions under the report name to see the terminology of that report.\n\nWhat is a traffic category vs. a traffic source?\n\nA traffic category refers to the broader category where traffic is coming from (e.g. paid social traffic vs. organic social traffic).
