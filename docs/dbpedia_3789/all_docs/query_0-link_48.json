You may plead not guilty and a trial date will be set. You may also plead guilty to the charge, and the judge will set the appropriate fine at that time.\n\nOption 2: Fill in the blanks, attach a written statement to the court, send the summons, the written statement and the check or money order for the bail amount to the court. You waive your right to a trial and consent to the judgment of the court. The court may forfeit all or part of the bail and will return that part, if any.\n\nOption 3: Fill in the blanks, attach a check or money order in the amount of the bail, and send the summons and money to the court. You are pleading guilty to the charge and waive the right to have a trial by the court. You may still send a written explanation if you choose.\n\nOption 4: Fill in the blanks, and send the summons to the court. This will be asking the court to enter a plea of Not Guilty, and a trial date will be set. The court will notify you of the court date. The court may impose penalties if you do not appear at the time given in the notification.\n\nOption 5: Go to the Court Clerk, before the time the summons requires you to appear, and determine if you qualify to proceed with a trial by affidavit. If so, the trial will be based upon sworn, written statements; future court appearances may not be necessary.\n\nIn all cases where you will be sending the summons via mail, remember that you must send all paperwork to the court, and they need to receive it, prior to the arraignment date and time set at the bottom of the citation. Failure to either appear at the appointed date/time, or failure to notify the court by mail prior to the court date/time, may result in suspension of your driver's license and/or issuance of a warrant for your arrest.\n\nI have questions about a photo radar citation I received in the mail, who do I contact?\n\nPlease follow this link to our Photo Enforcement page for more information on photo radar questions.\n\nWhat if I have questions regarding my court date and/or payments?\n\nRead the back of the citation, and then if you still have questions, contact the Multnomah County Circuit Court:\n\nPortland 971-274-0545\n\nGresham 971-274-0700, then dial zero (0) for the operator.\n\nMul.TrafficDept@ojd.state.or.us\n\nFor online payments: https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/online/Pages/epay.aspx\n\nHow do I handle a parking violation?\n\nPlease visit the Portland Bureau of Transportation website for parking violation information\n\nHow can I get my vehicle out of impound?\n\nIf your vehicle was towed due to any of the following reasons:\n\nPublic Safety\n\nHazard\n\nSafekeeping\n\nAlarm Disturbance, per City Code\n\nPossible Stolen\n\nVIN Inspection\n\nEvidence\n\nForfeiture\n\nThen visit the Records Division website and follow their instructions on how to retrieve your vehicle.\n\nHow can I find out if my vehicle was towed?\n\nYou may either contact the Records Division in person at Central Precinct in the Justice Center Lobby, 1111 SW 2nd Ave or call 823-0044.
