        "text": "Reporting in the Google Maps Platform provides a set of predefined visual reports of basic API usage, quota, and billing information in the Google Cloud Console. Use these reports to determine the number of API calls you've made, how close you are to hitting API usage quotas, and monitor your billing usage over time.\n\nThe types of reports include:\n\nUsage reports: Reports the number of requests your project makes to the Google Maps Platform APIs using credentials associated with your project.\n\nQuota reports: Reports quota usage in graphs that can be grouped in requests per minute. The current quota limits for selected APIs are displayed in tables below the quota usage graphs.\n\nBilling reports: Reports costs over time as a stacked line chart. View the current month’s quota usage, inclusive of any usage-specific credits applied, as well as the total forecasted cost for the entire current month.\n\nscienceEngagement reports: Provide business insights about how users engage with your map apps.\n\nFor a complete list of the response statuses and response codes that define whether a request appears in the Usage, Quota, and/or Billing reports, see Response status and reports.\n\nView the reports of Google Maps Platform usage, quota, and billing using the Cloud Console.\n\nUsage reports\n\nUsage is based on the number of requests your project makes to the Google Maps Platform APIs using the credentials associated with your project. Requests include successful requests, requests that result in server errors, and requests that result in client errors. Credentials include API keys and client IDs (for Premium Plan and migrated Premium Plan projects). For details, see the Premium Plan Overview and information on using a client ID.\n\nUsage metrics are displayed in tables (Requests, Errors, and Latency) and graphs (Traffic, Errors, and Latency). For tracking purposes:\n\nAll APIs: You can filter and group usage metrics for all APIs in these ways:\n\nFilter by time period and API.\n\nSee traffic, error, and latency grouped by response code, API, and credential.\n\nA specific API: You can filter and group usage metrics for a specific API in these ways:\n\nFilter by time period, API versions, credentials, and methods.\n\nSee traffic, error and latency grouped by response code, API method and version, and credential.\n\nAPIs & Services Dashboard page\n\nThe APIs & Services Dashboard provides an overview of the usage metrics for all APIs enabled for your project: the Google Maps Platform APIs as well as other APIs and services.\n\nThe Dashboard page features three graphs and a table. You can filter the usage displayed in the graphs and tables by selecting a time period from 1 hour up to the last 30 days.\n\nThe Traffic graph shows usage in queries per minute (QPM) per API.\n\nThe Errors graph shows percentage of the requests that resulted in errors per API.\n\nThe Latency graph shows the median latency of the requests per API.\n\nBeneath the graphs, a table lists the enabled APIs and services. Requests are the number of requests (for the selected time period). Errors are the number of these requests that resulted in errors. Latency (medium latency and percentile) is the latency for these requests.\n\nTo access the APIs & Services Dashboard page:\n\nOpen the Project selector page in the Cloud Console:\n\nProject selector page\n\nSelect your project. The APIs & Services Dashboard page appears.\n\nIf the page does not appear, select the menu button and then select APIs & Services.\n\nFor more information, see Monitoring your API Usage.\n\nGoogle Maps Overview page\n\nThe Google Maps Overview page includes a table listing enabled APIs and usage requests for the last 30 days. Requests by API are also shown in graph form. A billing graph shows your current bill and total usage for the last 3 months.\n\nTo access Google Maps Platform Overview page:\n\nOpen the Google Maps Platform page in the Cloud Console:\n\nGo to Google Maps Platform page\n\nIn the left menu, select Overview.\n\nGoogle Maps Platform APIs & Services page\n\nThe Google Maps APIs & Services page contains a grid of tiles representing the APIs, SDKs, and other services available to your project. Within each tile, you can enable or disable that service by selecting Enable or Disable, and you can access credentials information, metrics, and user guides for enabled APIs. You can also use the page filters to view enabled or disabled services and other service categories.\n\nTo access Google Maps Platform APIs & Services page:\n\nOpen the Google Maps Platform page in the Cloud Console:\n\nGo to Google Maps Platform page\n\nIn the left menu, select APIs & Services.\n\nGoogle Maps Metrics page\n\nThe Google Maps Metrics page displays three graphs: Traffic, Errors, and Median Latency. The usage data in the graphs can be grouped by Response Code class, API, API method, Credential, Platform and Domain.\n\nBeneath the graphs, the Metrics page includes an APIs table that shows requests, errors, and latency for the APIs you have selected.\n\nUsing the API drop-down at the top, and the grouping and filtering options in the right pane, you can group and filter displayed usage metrics by selecting specific or multiple APIs, Credentials, Response Code classes, Platform type and/or Domain. You can also select a time period (from one hour up to the last 30 days) and granularity (per second or day) for the displayed usage metrics.\n\nThe following images show Platform and Domain filters for a single API when grouping by Platform and Domain is selected in the Grouped by drop-down list:\n\nTo access Google Maps Platform API Metrics page:\n\nOpen the Google Maps Platform page in the Cloud Console:\n\nGo to Google Maps Platform page\n\nIn the left menu, select Metrics.\n\nCredential reporting\n\nYou can filter and group metrics by the credential that was used to load the API.\n\nCredential format Meaning Key name\n\nFor example, \"Mobile app key\" An API key was used to load the API using ?key=...: You can find the key names on the Maps Platform Console under Keys & Credentials. Project Number\n\nFor example, \"project_number:123456\", where 123456 is your project number. There are two possibilities if you see this credential:\n\nFor APIs that accept Maps Platform client IDs: A Maps Platform client ID was used to load the API. For example, using &client=gme-_mycompany_.\n\nThese APIs accept client IDS: Maps JavaScript API, Maps Static API, Street View Static API, Elevation API, Directions API, Distance Matrix API, Geocoding API, Time Zone API. For more information, see Premium Plan client ID Management.\n\nFor APIs that accept OAuth: The API was loaded using OAuth without an API key.\n\nResponse code graphs\n\nThe Traffic by response code and Error by response code graphs split usage by HTTP response code class. This table shows the mapping between the Google Maps Platform API response status and HTTP response code class:\n\nMaps API status HTTP response code class - Usage report\n\n(2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) Notes OK 2xx Successful response.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota. OK 3xx Successful response.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota.\n\nFor example, the Place Photo successful requests return 302 redirect to the referenced image. DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE 4xx(1) Successful response indicating that there's no available data for the input locations.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota. ZERO_RESULTS 4xx(1) Successful response returned no result.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota. NOT_FOUND 4xx(1) For the Directions API, this message indicates that at least one of the locations specified in the request's origin, destination, or waypoints couldn't be geocoded.\n\nFor the Places API this message indicates that the referenced location (place_id) was not found in the Places database.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota. INVALID_REQUEST (invalid parameter value),\n\nMAX_WAYPOINTS_EXCEEDED,\n\nMAX_ROUTE_LENGTH_EXCEEDED, and others. 4xx Error caused by invalid parameter value. Check the API response for more details.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota. REQUEST_DENIED 4xx Client error caused by authentication error, access error, and others. Check the API response for more details. OVER_DAILY_LIMIT,\n\nOVER_QUERY_LIMIT,\n\nRESOURCE_EXHAUSTED,\n\nrateLimitExceeded,\n\ndailyLimitExceeded,\n\nuserRateLimitExceeded 4xx Client error caused by too many requests per allowed time period. Retry the request at a later time. Check the API response for more details. INVALID_REQUEST (invalid or missing parameter, request parsing or validation error) 4xx Client error caused by invalid request. Check the API response for more details. NOT_FOUND (404) 4xx For the Geolocation API, this message indicates that the inputs weren't sufficient to produce a location estimate.\n\nFor the Roads API, this message indicates that the inputs couldn't be reasonably snapped to roads.\n\nThis is a billable request and will consume quota. UNKNOWN_ERROR 5xx Server error indicating that request cannot be proceeded: internal error, service overloaded, not available, time out, and others.\n\n1 To improve the consistency of error code reporting, Google Maps Platform APIs are migrating: 1) from HTTP response code class 2xx to 4xx for Maps API statuses: DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE, NOT_FOUND, ZERO_RESULTS - status, 2) from HTTP response code class 2xx to 4xx for Maps API statuses: REQUEST_DENIED, OVER_DAILY_LIMIT, OVER_QUERY_LIMIT, dailyLimitExceeded, rateLimitExceeded, userRateLimitExceeded, 3) from HTTP response code class 2xx to 5xx for Maps API status: UNKNOWN_ERROR. You can see both response codes during the transition period. Response codes returned in Maps API responses are not changing. Confirm that an increase in 4xx and/or 5xx in Google Maps Platform Metrics is related to this migration by checking which exact response code increases in the Metrics Explorer (learn more on using Google Cloud Monitoring for Google Maps Platform).\n\nFor more information about status codes and error messages, see the response documentation for the API you are interested in (for example, Geocoding Responses or Directions Responses).\n\nGoogle Maps Platform solutions parameter\n\nGoogle Maps Platform provides many types of sample code to help you get up and running quickly. For example, you can use Quick Builder in Cloud Console, follow the industry solutions implementation guides, and learn from codelabs.\n\nTo understand usage and ways to improve our solutions, Google includes the solution_channel query parameter in API calls to gather information about sample code usage:\n\nThe solution_channel query parameter is included by default in solution sample code.\n\nThe query parameter returns analytics on solution adoption to Google to improve solution quality in future iterations.\n\nYou can opt out by deleting the solution_channel query parameter and its value from sample code.\n\nThere is no requirement to keep the parameter. Removing the query parameter does not affect performance.\n\nThe query parameter is only used for sample code usage reporting.\n\nThe query parameter is separate from any API-specific analytics and reporting. That means removing the parameter from solution sample code does not disable internal Maps JavaScript API reporting.\n\nQuota reports\n\nQuotas set limits on the number of requests your project can make to the Google Maps Platform APIs. Requests can be limited in three ways: per day, per minute, and per user per minute. Only successful requests and requests that cause server errors count against quota. Requests that fail authentication don't count against quota.\n\nQuota usage is displayed in graphs on the Quotas page in the Cloud Console, and can be grouped in requests per minute. The current quota limits for selected APIs are displayed in tables below the quota usage graphs.\n\nTo get your per-minute quota value for any GMP API product, use this calculator.\n\nGoogle Maps Quotas page\n\nThe Google Maps Quotas page shows quota limits and quota consumption for the specific API you have selected.\n\nThe quota usage chart on the Google Cloud Console shows the total traffic for your API keys and client IDs. Client ID traffic is also available in the Metrics chart on the Cloud Console.\n\nThe page shows only requests that consume quota: successful requests (OK, ZERO_RESULTS, DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE) and requests that cause server errors (NOT_FOUND, INVALID_REQUEST/INVALID_VALUE (invalid parameter value), UNKNOWN_ERROR).\n\nRequests that cause client errors — authentication, authorization, and invalid argument errors (REQUEST_DENIED, OVER_QUERY_LIMIT, INVALID_REQUEST (invalid parameter, request parsing error)) — don't consume quota and are not displayed.\n\nThe quota unit is a request for most of the Google Maps Platform APIs (Maps Static API, Street View Static API, Geocoding API, Directions API, Places API, Time Zone API, Geolocation API, and Elevation API), but there are some exceptions:\n\nFor the Distance Matrix API, the quota unit is an element which is an origin-destination pair.\n\nFor the Maps JavaScript API, the quota unit is a map load.\n\nFor the Maps SDK for Android and Maps SDK for iOS, the quota unit is a Street View request or Panorama load. Map loads are available at no charge and don't consume quota.\n\nTo access Google Maps Platform Quotas page:\n\nOpen the Google Maps Platform page in the Cloud Console:\n\nGo to Google Maps Platform page\n\nIn the left menu, select Quotas.\n\nSelect an API from the API drop-down list.\n\nQuota units\n\nThis table shows the quota unit for the Google Maps Platform APIs.\n\nGoogle Maps Platform API Quota Unit Maps Maps SDK for Android 1 Panorama Maps SDK for iOS 1 Panorama Map Tiles API 1 Request Maps Aerial View API 1 Request Maps Static API 1 Request Maps JavaScript API 1 Map Load Street View Static API 1 Request Maps Embed API 1 Map Load Routes Routes API (Compute Routes) 1 Request Routes API (Compute Route Matrix) 1 Element (origin-destination pair) Directions API 1 Request Distance Matrix API 1 Element (origin-destination pair) Roads API 1 Request Route Optimization API 1 Request Places Places API 1 Request Address Validation API 1 Request Geocoding API 1 Request Geolocation API 1 Request Time Zone API 1 Request Environment Air Quality API (CurrentConditions and HeatmapTile) 1 Request Air Quality API (History) 1 page Pollen API 1 Request Solar API 1 Request\n\nBilling reports\n\nView your billing report\n\nBilling reports for your use of the Google Maps Platform products are available in the Google Cloud Console. For more information, see Billing.\n\nTo access the billing reports:\n\nOpen the Project selector page in the Cloud Console:\n\nProject selector page\n\nSelect a project.\n\nSelect the menu button and then select Billing.\n\nIf you have multiple billing accounts, select Go to linked billing account to open the Overview page for the linked billing account.\n\nIn the left menu, select Reports to open the billing Reports page for the linked billing account.\n\nHow to read the billing report chart\n\nBilling reports plot cost over time as a stacked line chart. The default view displays the current month's daily usage-specific costs grouped by project (for all products), inclusive of any usage-specific credits applied, as well as the total forecasted cost for the entire current month. Each line in the chart (and row in the summary table) corresponds to the project, ranked largest to smallest by cost. Learn more about interpreting the billing report chart.\n\nTip: Analyze the usage and cost per SKU\n\nTo more accurately understand the details of the pay-as-you-go pricing model and how it impacts your implementation, look at your usage and cost by SKU.\n\nTo change the report view to display line items by SKU:\n\nIn the panel to the right of the chart, expand the Group by filter.\n\nSelect SKU.\n\nOther billing-report filters available include Time range, Projects, Products, SKUs, and Locations which lets you filter by where the API requests are served from.\n\nTo categorize the source of your usage in addition to the product, group billing reports by one of the listed values. The three keys that relate to Google Maps Platform APIs are goog-maps-api-key-suffix (the final four characters of an API key), goog-maps-platform-type (the platform: Android, iOS, JavaScript or webservice), and goog-maps-channel (a set numeric channel value from an API query). More information on filtering and grouping.\n\nYou can change the chart view to exclude usage-specific credits by clearing the Include credits in cost checkbox in the right panel.\n\nMonitor and restrict consumption\n\nTo help you to plan your budget and control costs, you can do the following:\n\nSet a budget alert, to track how your spend is growing toward a particular amount. Setting a budget does not cap API usage, it only alerts you when your spend amount gets near the specified amount.\n\nCap your daily API usage, to manage your cost of use of billable APIs. By setting caps on requests per day, you can limit your spend. Use a simple equation to determine your daily cap depending on how much you want to spend. For example: (Monthly spend /price per each SKU)/30 = requests per day cap (for one API).\n\nUsage tracking per channel\n\nTo track your usage via numeric channels, you must add the 'channel' parameter to your API requests. The only acceptable channel values are numbers from 0-999. Here are a few examples:\n\nGeocoding Web Service API\n\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&key=YOUR_API_KEY&channel=1\n\nMaps JavaScript API\n\n<script src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&channel=2&callback=initMap\" async defer></script>\n\nMonitor your channel usage directly on your Billing Report. Channels will reflect under Labels as key goog-maps-channel.\n\nTo filter your billing report by SKU and channel\n\nUse the Group by SKU filter.\n\nSelect the Labels caret.\n\nSelect the Key dropdown and select goog-maps-channel.\n\nSelect the Value dropdown and select the numerical channels you want to filter.\n\nGroup by Label key goog-maps-channel to see the cost generated by each channel.\n\nOnce you have implemented channel usage data in your requests, there may be a short delay (up to 24 hours) before the data is reflected in your billing report.\n\nExport your billing data with BigQuery\n\nYou can also export your billing data to BigQuery.\n\nBigQuery Export enables you to export detailed Cloud Billing data (such as usage and cost estimate data) automatically throughout the day to a BigQuery dataset that you specify. Then you can access your billing data from BigQuery for detailed analysis. This gives an extra layer of granularity in understanding the source of your Google Maps Platform usage.\n\nIf you'd like to get started with BigQuery exports and querying the data, you can try the sample query below. Prior to running this query, you must:\n\nEnable billing and BigQuery billing export on your account.\n\nThe table format is PROJECT_ID.DATASET_NAME.gcp_billing_exportv1BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID where:\n\nPROJECT_ID is your actual project ID (e.g. \"my-project-123456\").\n\nDATASET_NAME is the name of the dataset you created (e.g. \"SampleDataSet\").\n\nBILLING_ACCOUNT_ID is a reference of your Billing Account ID, prefixed with \"gcp_billing_exportv1\", and changing dashes (-) to underscores (_). For example, billing account ID 123456-7890AB-CDEF01 would become gcp_billing_export_v1_123456_789AB_CDEF01.\n\n#standardSQL SELECT Date(usage_start_time, \"America/Los_Angeles\") AS billing_day, invoice.month AS invoice_month, service.description AS service, sku.description AS sku, ( SELECT l.value FROM Unnest(labels) AS l WHERE l.KEY = 'goog-maps-channel' ) AS goog_maps_channel, Round(Sum(usage.amount), 2) AS usage_amount, usage.unit AS usage_unit, Round(Sum(cost), 2) AS cost, cost_type, currency FROM PROJECT_ID.DATASET_NAME.gcp_billing_export_v1_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID WHERE invoice.month = '202002' -- Change the invoice month with the same format as the example. GROUP BY billing_day, invoice_month, service, sku, goog_maps_channel, usage_unit, cost_type, currency ORDER BY billing_day, service, sku\n\nRelated resources\n\nCloud Billing:\n\nCreate, modify, or close your Cloud Billing account\n\nModify a project's billing settings\n\nView Your Billing Reports and Cost Trends\n\nSet budgets and budget alerts\n\nCapping API Usage\n\nGoogle Maps Platform:\n\nGoogle Maps Platform Billing\n\nOptimization Guide\n\nAPI Key Best Practices\n\nResponse status and reports\n\nThe table below shows mapping between the Maps API status, HTTP response code returned in Maps API responses and HTTP response code class in Usage Report, and indicates if the corresponding request appears in the Usage, Quota, and Billing reports.\n\nThe Usage Report in Google Maps Platform Metrics provide HTTP response code class granularity. If you need a higher level of granularity see Response status codes available in Google Maps Platform Usage monitoring.\n\nResponse codes available in Maps API responses Available in Usage Report Reported to Maps API status HTTP response code HTTP response code class Usage Quota Billing OK 200,\n\n204,\n\n302 2xx,\n\n3xx Yes Yes Yes DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE,\n\nNOT_FOUND,\n\nZERO_RESULTS 200,\n\n404 4xx1 Yes Yes Yes INVALID_REQUEST (invalid parameter value),\n\nMAX_ROUTE_LENGTH_EXCEEDED,\n\nMAX_WAYPOINTS_EXCEEDED,\n\netc. 200,\n\n400 4xx Yes Yes Yes INVALID_REQUEST (invalid/missing parameter, request parsing error) 200,\n\n400 4xx Yes No No REQUEST_DENIED 200,\n\n400,\n\n403 4xx1 Yes No No OVER_DAILY_LIMIT,\n\nOVER_QUERY_LIMIT,\n\nRESOURCE_EXHAUSTED,\n\ndailyLimitExceeded,\n\nrateLimitExceeded,\n\nuserRateLimitExceeded 200,\n\n403,\n\n429 4xx1 Yes No No UNKNOWN_ERROR 200,\n\n500,\n\n503 5xx1 Yes Yes No\n\n1 To improve the consistency of error code reporting, Google Maps Platform APIs are migrating: 1) from HTTP response code class 2xx to 4xx for Maps API statuses: DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE, NOT_FOUND, ZERO_RESULTS - status, 2) from HTTP response code class 2xx to 4xx for Maps API statuses: REQUEST_DENIED, OVER_DAILY_LIMIT, OVER_QUERY_LIMIT, dailyLimitExceeded, rateLimitExceeded, userRateLimitExceeded, 3) from HTTP response code class 2xx to 5xx for Maps API status: UNKNOWN_ERROR. You can see both response codes during the transition period. Response codes returned in Maps API responses are not changing. Confirm that an increase in 4xx and/or 5xx in Google Maps Platform Metrics is related to this migration by checking which exact response code increases in the Metrics Explorer (learn more on using Google Cloud Monitoring for Google Maps Platform).\n\nEngagement reports\n\nBusiness Insights\n\nGoogle Maps Platform gives you insights into how users engage with your maps. These insights include key engagement metrics such as views on a map or interactions with a POI. You can analyze these insights to uncover popular locations for advertising and marketing or to optimize your user experience.\n\nBusiness insights reporting capabilities include:\n\nViewing a high-level business insights snapshot to see key trends in business insights at a glance\n\nDrilling down to analyze a specific metric within the console to deep dive into understanding metrics in more detail\n\nExporting metrics to CSV so you can analyze business insights data in your favorite business analysis tool\n\nEngagement metrics available include:\n\nMap Views: Track views on the map resulting from pans, zooms, or tilts. Map Views are computed by postal code on a weekly basis (Sunday to Saturday Pacific time). New data is released weekly on the first Wednesday following the observation period.\n\nUsers can view business insights in the Metrics Page in Cloud Console. The project must have Maps JavaScript API enabled.\n\nYou can analyze engagement metrics directly in the console with Filter and Group By capabilities to deep dive into metrics in more detail. For instance, you might choose to filter by a specific region to learn how map views are trending for only postal codes in that region. On the other hand, you might want to group by a specific region to aggregate interactions within that region.\n\nUsers can export the entire data set or a filtered view to CSV to analyze further in your favorite business analysis tool. You can download up to 90 days at a time and downloads greater than 60K cells will be truncated. Exporting map views data to CSV may take a few minutes depending on the selected time range.\n\nBusiness insights metrics are anonymized and therefore only reflect overall trends in engagement with your maps. Low counts may be rounded to zero and contributions from outliers may be reduced.\n\nYou can control access to business insights for your Cloud project in the Google Cloud Console using the Maps Analytics permission. Project Owners are granted this permission by default and can provision access to other users as needed.\n\nBusiness insights should not be used to estimate your usage costs. Please refer to usage reports for more usage information.\n\nLocator Plus\n\nFor Locator Plus users, an analytics dashboard helps you analyze and generate insights from your data, giving a clear picture of how well your shoppers are engaging with your store locator. You can measure your performance week over week, including number of views, number of interactions with Search and Place Details, and overall engagement rate. In addition, the dashboard provides important benchmarks on how your implementation compares against other retailers.\n\nGo to Locator Plus in the Google Cloud Console.\n\nGo to the Engagement Reports section of the Google Cloud Console to see the analytics dashboard.\n\nThe benchmarking report lets you compare your data with aggregated industry data from other companies who share their data. The comparison provides valuable context, helping you set meaningful targets, gain insight into industry trends, and find out how you are doing compared to your competition."
