        "text": "The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a system for classifying sensitive information created in the early 2000s by the UK Government's National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre, in order to encourage greater sharing of sensitive information. It is also being championed in the US by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\nI first discovered the concept while researching Microsoft Purview Information Protection. I came across Alexander Fields' great post Adopting the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) with Microsoft 365's Sensitivity Labels. Given our focus on external sharing in Microsoft 365, I’ve written this article with that specifically in mind. Let’s start by understanding the base TLP. It consists of easy to remember names and colours to indicate sensitivity. In our case, we’re going to be applying those labels to both containers and documents in Microsoft 365, but we’ll get to that.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an additional layer of security that requires users to verify their identity with more than one piece of evidence before accessing a system or a resource. MFA typically combines something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a phone or a token), and something the user is (such as a fingerprint or a face scan). MFA can prevent unauthorized access even if someone's password is compromised, and it can enhance the protection of sensitive data and systems.\n\nRequiring MFA for guest access to Microsoft 365 significantly improves security, but it can also present a barrier to entry for guests that are unfamiliar with it. We recommend balancing the need for MFA with the sensitivity of the content being accessed, which we’ll explore further.\n\nDocument Encryption\n\nFor highly sensitive documents, document encryption can be applied to add another level of protection. Encrypted documents can have very granular permissions applied, defining who can view, edit, save, print, or copy content. Content marking can also be used to apply custom headers, footers, and watermarks to content.\n\nTLP and External Access in Microsoft 365\n\nBelow is a suggested implementation of TLP for defining external (guest) access in Microsoft 365.\n\nTLP External Access Guests Require MFA Document Encryption M365 Member Licensing Red+Strict No N/A Yes E5 Red Yes Yes Yes E5 Amber+Strict No N/A No E3 Amber Yes Yes No E3 Green Yes No No E3 Clear Yes No No N/A\n\nStrict protocols are for content that is not to be shared outside the organization, so external access is not permitted\n\nRed and Amber protocols can be accessed by guests, but those guests need to go through MFA to access the content\n\nRed documents are also encrypted to further protect them, both in Microsoft 365 and also when downloaded and stored outside of Microsoft 365\n\nGreen and Clear content can be accessed by guests without going through MFA and no encryption is applied\n\nMicrosoft Purview\n\nLicensing and Applying Labels\n\nMicrosoft licensing is never a simple topic, and Purview is no exception. A few good resources to help navigate this are:\n\nMicrosoft Compliance and Information Protection Licensing Guide\n\nAll About Microsoft Purview Sensitivity Labels\n\nMicrosoft 365 Licensing\n\nThe simple version is that users require Office 365 E3 or above to apply a label manually, while automatic policy-driven application of labels requires Office 365 E5, Microsoft 365 E5, or Microsoft 365 E5 compliance licenses. Automatic is a broad term and involves assigning a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint document library or using a workflow to apply a label.\n\nWhere this manual versus automatic discussion becomes important is primarily when we are focused on labels applied to documents rather than sites, so let’s dig into the differences there.\n\nContainer (Site) Labels\n\nWith Microsoft Purview enabled in your tenant, labels can be applied during or after creation of Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites. Label settings can be applied to control the following:\n\nPrivacy (public or private) of team sites and Microsoft 365 groups\n\nExternal user access\n\nExternal sharing from SharePoint sites\n\nAccess from unmanaged devices\n\nAuthentication contexts\n\nPrevent discovery of private teams for users who have this capability\n\nShared channel control for team invitations\n\nDefault sharing link for a SharePoint site (PowerShell-only configuration)\n\nSite sharing settings (PowerShell-only configuration)\n\nDefault label for channel meetings\n\nSee the Microsoft Learn article Use Sensitivity Labels with Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, and SharePoint Sites.\n\nThe key settings we’ll be focused on are external access and sharing, and authentication contexts.\n\nFile Labels in SharePoint and OneDrive\n\nSharePoint and OneDrive have built-in support for Office files and PDF files. Once configured, SharePoint and OneDrive are able to process the contents of Office and PDF documents that have been encrypted by using a sensitivity label. This allows coauthoring, eDiscovery, data loss prevention, search, and other collaborative features to work.\n\nBecause files are encrypted, labels can control access and apply content marking regardless of where the files are located. Even when downloaded from SharePoint or OneDrive, the files retain their encryption and protection settings.\n\nAccess control for labelled files is very granular. Labels can define who can view, edit, save, print, or copy content. These permissions can be assigned to all users and groups in your organization, any authenticated users, or specific users, groups, email addresses, or domains.\n\nPurview content marking is a feature that allows administrators to apply visual markings to files that have been labelled with sensitivity labels. These markings can include headers, footers, and watermarks that display the label name, classification, or other information. Purview content marking helps to deter unauthorized sharing or leakage of sensitive data by making the label visible on the file.\n\nAuthentication Contexts\n\nAn authentication context is a set of conditions that must be met before a user can access a resource or perform an action. Authentication contexts can be used to enforce different levels of security depending on the sensitivity or risk of the resource or action. For example, an authentication context can require a user to provide additional factors of authentication, such as a one-time password or a biometric, or to use a compliant device that meets certain security standards. Authentication contexts can also be based on the location of the user, such as requiring a user to be within a certain geographic area or network.\n\nPurview Implementation Phase One\n\nFor our recommended phase one implementation of Purview Information Protection for external guests, we’re going to focus on Green and Amber sensitivity. These are the simpler levels to implement, as the licensing is more common (E3) and we are just focused on container level labelling.\n\nRepeating the table from above, we’ve highlighted the changes in the Red protocol, where we are not ready to do document encryption yet, so no external access is permitted to those documents. Depending on preference, you could choose not to implement the Red protocols during this phase, or they could be defined and available for tagging, but not yet fully implemented.\n\nTLP External Access Guests Require MFA Document Encryption M365 Member Licensing Red+Strict No N/A Yes E5 Red No N/A Yes E5 Amber+Strict No N/A No E3 Amber Yes Yes No E3 Green Yes No No E3 Clear Yes No No N/A\n\nThe main steps to be completed are:\n\nDefine the container level sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview.\n\nDefine the authentication context for each label.\n\nBuild the conditional access policies to allow access from members and guests as appropriate.\n\nInventory and label the existing sites.\n\nUpdate the sharing rules for each site to correspond to its sensitivity label.\n\nPurview Implementation Phase Two\n\nIn the second phase of the implementation, we are going to target the implementation of the Red labels which require document encryption. While these can be manually applied by E3 licensed users, we typically recommend E5 licensing to allow auto-labelling and default labels.\n\nIn this phase the main steps are:\n\nDefine the container and document level sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview.\n\nDetermine the appropriate access controls and document marking rules.\n\nSet the default label rules based on the container labels.\n\nConfigure Azure Information Protection and Azure Rights Management.\n\nApply the default labels to the existing content.\n\nCreate the additional authentication contexts and conditional access policies."
