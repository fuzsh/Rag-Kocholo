        "text": "Prompt Description Pre-set Date Filter From the list, choose a time period on which to report, and move it to the Selected list. Start Date Choose the first day from which to gather report data. End Date Choose the last day from which to gather report data. Queue Group Optionally, select a queue on which to report. Queue Optionally, select a queue on which to report. Media Type Optionally, select the type of media to include in the report—for example, VOICE, EMAIL, and CHAT. Interaction Type Optionally, select the type of interaction to include in the report—for example, Inbound, Outbound, and Internal. Tenant For multi-tenant environments, optionally select the tenant(s) for which to include data in the report. Attribute Description Tenant This attribute enables data within the reporting interval to be organized by tenant. Media Type This attribute enables data to be organized by the interaction’s media type—for example, VOICE, EMAIL, and CHAT. Queue This attribute enables data within the reporting interval to be organized by the name of the ACD queue, virtual queue, interaction queue, or workbin. Interaction Type This attribute enables data to be organized by the interaction’s type—for example, Inbound, Outbound, and Internal. Day This attribute enables data within the reporting interval to be organized by a particular day within a month and year. Day values are presented in YYYY-MM-DD format. Metric Description % Accept Service Level The service level of this queue measured as a percentage of interactions that entered this queue and were accepted within the acceptance threshold, relative to all interactions that entered this queue and were offered to a resource.\n\nThis metric yields results other than 0 only for interactions that were accepted by an agent. This metric relies on the value of the acceptance threshold as configured in the [agg-gim-thld-QUEUE-IXN] section.\n\nOffered The total number of interactions that entered this queue and were subsequently offered to a resource.\n\nThe count excludes short-abandoned interactions and includes handling attempts that agents rejected, as well as warm consultations, conferences, and collaborations that agents received. This metric does include interactions for which no threshold was set by Router. This metric relies on the value of the short-abandoned threshold as configured in the [agg-gim-thld-QUEUE-IXN] section.\n\nDistributed The total number of times that customer interactions or established warm consultations were distributed or pulled from this queue.\n\nDistribution includes the interactions that were:\n\nDistributed to another queue.\n\nDistributed to an unmonitored resource.\n\nAccepted, answered, or pulled.\n\nRejected/redirected upon no answer.\n\nAbandoned by the customer while they were alerting at the agent.\n\nIf the interaction passes through more than one queue before it was distributed, the count is increased only for that device from which the interaction was distributed or pulled.\n\n% Distributed The percentage of customer interactions or warm consultations that entered this queue and were subsequently distributed to a resource, relative to the total number of interactions that entered this queue and were offered to a resource.\n\nThis metric relies on the value of the short-abandoned threshold as configured in the [agg-gim-thld-QUEUE-IXN] section.\n\nAccepted The total number of times that customer interactions and warm consultations that were distributed from this queue, were accepted, answered, or pulled by an agent, voice-treatment port, IVR port, or nonagent-associated DN (such as contact center resources that can alert). % Accepted The percentage of customer interactions and warm consultations that entered this queue and were subsequently distributed and accepted, relative to the total number of interactions that entered this queue.\n\nThis metric relies on the value of the acceptance threshold as configured in the [agg-gim-thld-QUEUE-IXN] section.\n\nAbandoned Waiting The total number of times that customer interactions entered this queue and were abandoned or dropped for any reason before the interactions could be distributed.\n\nThe count includes short-abandoned interactions and excludes interactions that were abandoned after distribution, such as abandoned-while-inviting interactions.\n\n% Abandoned Waiting The percentage of customer interactions that both entered this queue and were subsequently abandoned before the interactions could be distributed, relative to the total number of interactions that entered this queue. Avg Accept Time (Fmt) The average amount of time (HH:MM:SS) that customers waited before their interactions—distributed from this queue—were accepted by a handling resource.\n\nThis metric is identical to Queue\\ASA.\n\nMax Accept Time (Fmt) The longest amount of time (HH:MM:SS) that customer interactions that were distributed from this queue spent in a queue before they were accepted by the target resource.\n\nDuration starts when the interaction enters the member queue and ends when the interaction is accepted—thereby, including alert (ring) time.\n\nAvg Abandoned Waiting Time (Fmt) The average amount of time (HH:MM:SS) that customer interactions spent at this queue before they were abandoned or dropped for any reason.\n\nThis average includes the duration and count of short-abandoned interactions."
