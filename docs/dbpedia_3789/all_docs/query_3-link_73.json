        "text": "An MVR, which stands for motor vehicle record or motor vehicle report, is a type of public record pertaining to an individual’s driving history. The department of motor vehicles (DMV) or a similar government entity in each state maintains a MVR for each licensed driver in the state. What’s included in this driving record may vary slightly, but usually involves information such as the person’s driver license status and class, accident history, driving-related convictions, moving violations, suspensions, and outstanding fines.\n\nAn MVR check, sometimes called a driver’s license verification or driving records check, searches a candidate’s driving record in the state where they are currently licensed to reveal information about their driver license status and driving history. Generally, a motor vehicle records search reports all data as provided by the DMV for the past three to ten years, depending on the state. MVRs may show violations from other states. For example, if a driver moved and obtained a license in a new state, the DMV may transfer the driving record information to the new state where the individual’s new license was issued. However, whether this occurs is at the discretion of the DMVs.\n\nInformation that may appear on an MVR report includes:\n\nWhat shows up on an MVR report varies by state. For example, screenings in most states return driving records from the past seven years, but other states only return motor vehicle records from three years, and a few as far as 10 years. In some states, driving-related felonies and misdemeanors do not show up on a criminal search, so an employer may consider using a comprehensive criminal background screening with an MVR check included for the most accurate information.\n\nIn states with digitized motor vehicle records, employers may receive MVR screening results the same day. At Checkr, most MVR reports are completed within a few minutes. In some instances MVR reports may not be available electronically, which may cause delays. Errors in MVR report requests, such as a spelling error in a name or an incorrect driver license number, can slow results, too.\n\nHow long an MVR check takes also depends on whether you are conducting the search directly with the state’s DMV, requesting the candidate provide the report, or working with a third-party provider.\n\nUsing a qualified background check provider, like Checkr, to conduct MVR screenings is generally the fastest option due to our advanced technology and extensive data networks.\n\nEmployers have several options for requesting an MVR report for a job candidate:\n\nMVR checks are a valuable tool to help reduce risk, minimize insurance costs, and create a safer environment for employees and customers. However, obtaining MVR reports yourself can be time-consuming, and failing to remain compliant with relevant laws could expose your company to legal liability. Partnering with Checkr streamlines the MVR check process so you can focus on building a team you can trust.\n\nCheckr’s advanced platform delivers accurate results with speed, while a mobile-friendly candidate portal keeps applicants in-the-know. MVR Rule configuration is highly customizable to meet your needs, allowing customers to more easily make the best decisions for their business needs in a compliant manner.\n\nGain peace of mind and protect your brand reputation with our user-friendly MVR checks.\n\nHiring talent for key positions at your company can be a time-consuming process that includes several important steps. Any time you’re making a hire, you’re investing in a person to help grow your business. When companies are hiring for positions in which employees will operate motor vehicles as part of their duties on the job, an important step in the process is reviewing driving records. Specifically, an MVR check provides reliable information to help employers evaluate a candidate’s driving history.\n\nDriving records may also assist employers in creating a safe environment on the road, protecting both the employee and the company, mitigating overall risk, upholding a top-of-the-line company reputation, and safeguarding against liability claims and higher insurance costs.\n\nTo help businesses best understand how valuable MVR checks can be when hiring, and how safety on the roads impacts employees as well as employers, Checkr analyzed driving data from across the United States to reveal the safest places for drivers in each US state.\n\nTo conduct the analysis, Checkr reviewed data from the United States Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (USDOT), the Office of Highway Policy Information, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer.\n\nNow, let’s get into the key findings to learn more.\n\nThe graphic above shows the top ten safest states for driving in America. Within this data set, businesses can review states that are highly rated for the most important key safety metrics, including DUIs, average driving age, average daily traffic, fatal crash rate, and fatality range change. The high-ranking states should be viewed as top places for those looking for a safe driving area both for business and personal reasons.\n\nLet’s start with the top-ranked state in America for driver safety—Massachusetts. This state boasts fantastic safety metrics, showcasing a top 15 ranking for four key categories, including fatal crash rate, DUIs, fatality rate change, and average driving age.\n\nFollowing Massachusetts and rounding out the top ten are Hawaii, New York, Alaska, Utah, North Dakota, Nebraska, Maryland, New Jersey, and Wyoming.\n\nThe data also reveals the states falling just outside of the top ten, which include Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Alabama.\n\nNext, let’s take a look at the other side of the data to reveal the least safe states for driving in the US.\n\nThe graphic above shows the ten least safe states for driving in America using the same key metrics.\n\nTo start, Oregon ranks last among all US states as the least-safest state for driving. Oregon ranks last in fatality rate change and in the bottom 15 among all US states for fatal crash rate, average driving age, and DUIs. Based on the metrics analyzed within this report, Oregon ranks as a potentially unsafe state for drivers navigating the roads for work or personal reasons.\n\nFollowing Oregon on the least safe states for driving list are South Carolina, Idaho, South Dakota, Nevada, California, Tennessee, Vermont, Florida, and Montana.\n\nJust outside the least safe states top ten list are Colorado, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Arizona, and New Mexico.\n\nNext, let's take a look at some key individual metrics that make up a safe driving environment and which states stand out.\n\nWhen it comes to a safe state for driving, three metrics stand out as extremely important—DUIs, fatal crashes, and average daily traffic.\n\nAccording to the NHTSA, drunk-driving-related incidents claim more than 10,000 lives per year. Clearly, this is a major issue for drivers and others on the roads.\n\nSo, how do the states rank?\n\nAs shown in the graphic above, Florida leads the way as the state with the least amount of DUIs per 1,000 people, followed by Delaware, Louisiana, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Finishing out the top ten are New York, Illinois, Alabama, West Virginia, and North Carolina.\n\nUp next, we’ll take a look at the fatal crash rate. Fatal crashes are defined as death as a result of an injury sustained in a crash and accounted for nearly 43,000 deaths in 2022 alone. When it comes to the states with the lowest rates of fatal crashes, according to the data, Massachusetts lands in the top spot, followed by Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Wyoming.\n\nIt’s not a surprise that average daily traffic has a significant impact on driving safety. With that in mind, Checkr uncovered the states with the lowest average daily traffic. The top spot for this key driving safety metric goes North Dakota, followed by Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, South Dakota, West Virginia, Iowa, New Mexico, Vermont, and Kansas.\n\nDriving safety is important for anyone operating a vehicle on today’s busy roads, and should not be ignored by corporations and small businesses that employ individuals who operate vehicles as part of their job. To help support safety of all people on the roads, a proper MVR check can be used during the driver hiring process.\n\nFinally, let’s take a look at the full rundown of the safest states for driving, along with the overall safety scores.\n\nFor more information on Checkr’s research or to request graphics for this study, please contact press@checkr.com.\n\nTo rank America’s safest states for driving, Checkr analyzed the most recent traffic density and driving age data from the United States Department of Transportation’s (US DOT) Federal Highway Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) fatal crash data, and the FBI Crime Data Explorer’s DUI arrest data. All states were ranked for each of the five factors—fatal crashes (per 100 million vehicle miles traveled), DUIs (per 1,000 people), average weighted daily traffic per lane, fatality rate change, and driving age percentages—then given a total driving safety score based on their weighted sum of the ranks. Fatal crash rate and DUIs were assigned a 25% weight, traffic density was assigned a 20% weight, and fatality rate increase and driving age were assigned a 15% weight.\n\nThe resources provided here are for educational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice.
