        "text": "Regulatory road signs are an important type of traffic sign to know, as they establish rules and regulations that all road users must adhere to. Regulatory signs serve as explicit directives that specify speed limits, parking restrictions, and other mandatory rules essential for maintaining order and safety on the road.\n\nMost regulatory signs have a white background, however, some regulatory signs such as stop signs and yield signs have a red background. Regulatory signs with a red background will have a white legend, and those with a white background will have a red or black legend, or a combination of the two.\n\nWarning signs are an essential category of road signs designed to inform drivers and other road users of potential hazards, dangers, or changes in road conditions. The primary purpose of warning signs is to provide advance notice and encourage caution, so that drivers can take appropriate steps to avoid accidents or navigate challenges safely.\n\nRegulatory road signs are typically characterized by their distinctive yellow background and black symbols or text. They are also commonly made in diamond shapes, which helps to catch the attention of drivers and ensure they're warned of any upcoming hazards.\n\nGuide signs are a category of traffic signs that provide valuable information to drivers to help them get around safely and efficiently. They offer information about destinations, distances, and directions, guiding motorists to specific locations such as cities, tourist attractions, and services. Additionally, guide signs may include exit numbers and route markers, aiding travelers in making informed choices and staying on the right path.\n\nThese signs typically have green backgrounds with white legends, but can also be found with blue or brown backgrounds. These signs are most commonly seen along interstates and highways, especially near exits or junctions.\n\nService and recreation signs are designed to inform travelers about nearby services and recreational facilities. They guide motorists to essential amenities like gas stations, rest areas, food, and lodging options, ensuring that drivers can make timely and informed stops during their journeys.\n\nSimilar to guide signs, these signs typically feature white legends on blue, brown backgrounds. In some cases, such as directional parking signs, the background of the sign is white and the legend is green.\n\nTemporary traffic control signs are used in a variety of settings. These signs play an important role in managing and redirecting traffic during road construction, maintenance work, or special events. They can provide information on detours, speed limits, lane closures, and any other temporary conditions.\n\nTemporary traffic control signs are helpful for minimizing confusion and potential hazards. Since adhering to these signs is critical for safety, they are generally orange in color to stand out and grab the attention of road users, especially in construction zones.\n\nIncident management signs (commonly referred to as pink road signs) are designed to manage and mitigate the impact of emergencies, accidents, and other unforeseen incidents on roadways. They provide crucial information on detours, road closures, and alternative routes, helping to provide efficient emergency response and management of incidents.\n\nPink road signs are typically made with a bright pink background and black legend to ensure high visibility. These signs utilize a diamond shape that alert drivers to special road hazards, such as temporary detours, road closures, flooding, and more.\n\nPedestrian and bicycle signs are designed to enhance the safety of both bicyclists and pedestrians on the road. These include, but are not limited to, pedestrian crossing signs, bicycle crossing signs, yield to pedestrian signs, playground signs, school crosswalk signs, and bike lane signs. These signs provide clear directives for both drivers and other road users to guide them while sharing the roadway.\n\nPedestrian and bicycle signs utilize several different colored backgrounds because they can serve a wide range of purposes. They also utilize different shapes, depending on if the sign is meant as a warning, traffic regulation, or guide."
