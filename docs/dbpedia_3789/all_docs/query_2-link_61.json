        "text": "Mapping & Data\n\nTDOT maintains a variety of applications to access and analyze traffic data across the state. Included are mapping products, analysis and reporting tools, data request forms, and downloadable content. Traffic data is updated on each platform annually and is available by clicking on the links below.\n\nTennessee Traffic Information Management and Evaluation System (TN-TIMES)\n\nTDOT Traffic History\n\nTDOT Traffic Maps\n\nTRIMS Data Request\n\nTDOT Traffic Data Collection Methods\n\nTemporary Count Systems\n\nPneumatic Road Tubes - TDOT uses road tube counts throughout the state to collect classification and volume counts over a 24-hour period.\n\nEmbedded Detection Loops (EDL) - Embedded Detection Loops are used on select Tennessee roadways for traffic surveillance purposes.\n\nPermanent Count Systems\n\nAutomatic Traffic Recorders (ATR) - Automatic Traffic Recorders are used for recurring traffic counts all year round. They are continuously downloaded through cellular and IP communications and can be used within government, quasi-government, and other agencies.\n\nTruck Percentages\n\nTruck percentages are expressed as a part of AADT. As a Federal requirement and based on the high number of trucks traversing Tennesseeâ€™s highways, it is important that truck percentages are calculated. For more information on data collection methods, contact the Road Inventory Office.\n\nSeasonal Factors & Axle Correction Factors\n\nThe 24-hour counts are adjusted to reflect seasonal changes in traffic volumes and are computed using historical traffic data collected from permanent count stations. Seasonal factors can be assigned to traffic counts based on the functional classification of the roadway and the month in which the counts were taken. Axle Adjustment Factors, on the other hand, are determined by using the traffic data from strategically placed classification count stations."
