        "text": "In 2009, Dr. Ann Thorndike and a team of researchers implemented a change in the Massachusetts General Hospital cafeteria. Foods received green, yellow or red dots to show where foods were ranked on a spectrum of choices. As the hospital described it, “green for the healthiest items, such as fruits, vegetables and lean sources of protein; yellow for less healthy items; and red for those with little or no nutritional value.”\n\nKnown to many as “traffic light” labels, this system had been championed by everyone from the hospital’s wellness program to its VP of human resources. “Everyone was talking about it,” Dr. Thorndike says. “If we were going to do this, I wanted to study it and make sure that it worked.”\n\nAt a time when the obesity rate for Americans is over 32 percent, and related medical costs could put the U.S. out over $209 billion dollars, traffic light labels are often seen as an easy behavior modification tool. But big questions remain about how well they work. The latest results of the Massachusetts General study were encouraging. Now in the fifth year of the study, sales of soda and other beverages marked “red” dropped from 26 percent to 17 percent of total beverage sales in two years. The study also found that green food sales went up from 41 to 46 percent.\n\n“The labels are a great way to communicate,” says Dr. Thorndike. “They don’t need any literacy or numeracy. They create a visceral reaction.” The program has been so successful that other private cafeterias have taken up a traffic light label as well. Memorial Medical in Springfield, Illinois started adding red, green, and yellow dots to their food in March 2014.\n\nBut hospitals aren’t the only institutions concerned about health. Schools are also considering traffic light labels to mixed success. Glenbrook High School in Illinois considered using them in their cafeteria and schools like California’s Chapman University have studied the potential benefits of these labels in their own dining halls.\n\nMichael Seward, a Harvard undergraduate student majoring in biology, was recently allowed to use two of the university’s dining halls to conduct a study on the effect of traffic light symbols on student eating. Though the results haven’t been tabulated, the hope is that seeing a red light will be enough of a jolt to get students to think twice about the food they’re about to consume.\n\nPrivate companies who want their employees to eat better are also investing in these systems. Workers with diet-related illnesses miss more workdays than their healthy co-workers. This costs employers in lost time and money.\n\nGoogle, which is known for serving local, seasonal, and healthy foods in its cafeterias, uses stoplight labels. When National Public Radio moved into its new headquarters in April 2013, it also added red, green, and yellow signage to its cafeteria menu. Surprisingly, even the Army created a Go for Green initiative which color-codes menu items in participating military cafeterias.\n\nGuiding eaters toward healthier options without promoting obsessive eating behavior has been a concern of many labeling systems. For instance, members of a Harvard eating disorder awareness group and other students protested the study on their campus, worrying that any nutritional information could be a trigger for those who struggle with eating disorders."
