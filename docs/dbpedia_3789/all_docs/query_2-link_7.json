        "text": "Data Section\n\nThe Data Section provides a foundation for roadway enhancement, intersection design, traffic calming, trail improvements, safety analysis, transportation plans, and traffic signal timing. Our goal is to provide essential information to improve the traveling environment within the Municipality; such information can be found online at: http://traffic.muni.org/\n\nCollection and Processing\n\nUsing several different methods, the Data team conducts studies of traffic characteristics, collects related data, and interprets collision information provided by various law enforcement agencies.\n\nShown here is just one of the many devices used to obtain traffic data.\n\nTypes of Collected Traffic Data:\n\nRoadway Volume Counts (Vehicular and Pedestrian)\n\nTrail Volume Counts\n\nVehicle Speed Studies\n\nTraffic Gap Studies\n\nTravel Time Delay Studies\n\nVehicle Classification Studies\n\nOther studies (circulation, cut through, travel behavior, license plate, etc.)\n\nIntersection Safety Analysis\n\nCollision Information (APD, UAA, Aiport Police, State Troopers, etc.)\n\nOther traffic related information\n\nAnalysis and Traffic System Care / Maintenance\n\nEssentials like: volumes, studies, collisions, traffic control and roadway characteristics (directional flow, intersection geometry, approach lanes, road class, etc.) are compiled, edited and loaded into the Traffic Data Management System (TDMS).\n\nData is then geographically related and all particulars are added to TDMS such as: average annual daily traffic figures, road classifications, appropriate federal/state safety factors, collision diagram templates, equations, and other necessary features.\n\nLoaded information is analyzed and subjected to various quality assurance measures prior to creation/release of any traffic statistics.\n\nTDMS, a Data Group maintained system is publicly available for query and access.\n\nPublication\n\nAnnual traffic data is compiled and statistical analysis is performed for all information gathered along roads or trails within the Municipality of Anchorage. The Data Section uses this information to create and publish the Annual Traffic Report.\n\nInformation contained within the report is used to evaluate and determine proper techniques for meeting transportation needs within the municipality such as: traffic safety improvements, transportation planning, and optimal signal operations. The information can also be used to determine locations where redesign could possibly decrease the number of traffic collisions."
