        "text": "Network traffic is the amount of data moving across a computer network at any given time. Network traffic, also called data traffic, is broken down into data packets and sent over a network before being reassembled by the receiving device or computer.\n\nNetwork traffic has two directional flows, north-south and east-west. Traffic affects network quality because an unusually high amount of traffic can mean slow download speeds or spotty Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connections. Traffic is also related to security because an unusually high amount of traffic could be the sign of an attack.\n\nWhen data travels over a network or over the internet, it must first be broken down into smaller batches so that larger files can be transmitted efficiently. The network breaks down, organizes, and bundles the data into data packets so that they can be sent reliably through the network and then opened and read by another user in the network. Each packet takes the best route possible to spread network traffic evenly.\n\nNon-real-time traffic, also known as best-effort traffic, is traffic that network administrators consider less important than real-time traffic. Examples include File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for web publishing and email applications.\n\nNetwork traffic analysis (NTA) is a technique used by network administrators to examine network activity, manage availability, and identify unusual activity. NTA also enables admins to determine if any security or operational issues exist—or might exist moving forward—under current conditions. Addressing such issues as they occur not only optimizes the organization's resources but also reduces the possibility of an attack. As such, NTA is tied to enhanced security.\n\nIdentify bottlenecks: Bottlenecks are likely to occur as a result of a spike in the number of users in a single geographic location.\n\nTroubleshoot bandwidth issues: A slow connection can be because a network is not designed to accommodate an increase in the number of users or amount of activity.\n\nImprove visibility of devices on your network: Increased awareness of endpoints can help administrators anticipate network traffic and make adjustments if necessary.\n\nDetect security issues and fix them more quickly: NTA works in real time, alerting admins when there is a traffic anomaly or possible breach."
