Good vinyl, very nice clean gloss flipback cover.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer is the debut album by the British progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, released in 1970. The album was intended not as an effort by a unified band, but as a general collaborative recording session, and as such, some of the tracks are essentially solo pieces.
