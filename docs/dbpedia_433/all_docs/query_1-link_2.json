        "text": "Emerson, Lake and Palmer are quite possibly the world's most reviled band. Now, they were extremely popular in the early 70's among those who 'took themselves seriously' (especially college students), and even today they maintain a sizable cult following, so it would be unfair to say that absolutely nobody likes them. Regardless, however, this is a perfectly legitimate statement on the general level. Fans of punk have always detested them as they would any prog band, but this extended far beyond normal levels of loathing; as an example, one of the staples of late 70's Sex Pistols shows was to burn life-size statues of Keith Emerson in effigy (or so the legend goes, and I really hope it's true because it's a hilarious legend).\n\nNow, this normally wouldn't be such a bad thing, since after all hatred of art-rock and prog-rock was one of the most important principles upon which the punk movement was founded. No, what distinguished ELP was the amount of venom spewed upon them by other \"high-brow\" artists and their various followers. Fans of classical music absolutely despised them (sometimes) for \"butchering\" various well-known pieces in their attempts to interpret these standards in a rock idiom. There is a nugget of truth to this, of course (Pictures at an Exhibition is often quite a stretch from the original Mussorgsky piece, to put it mildly), but ... I dunno. I'm sure that a good number of the band's fans became fans of classical music due to their efforts, so that should be worth something. Or maybe the older generation was just mad about all these young whippersnappers infiltrating their societal niche ....\n\n(AUTHOR'S NOTE): There used to be a paragraph here where I made some asinine statements about the borders of what exactly constitutes prog rock. Some comments below reference that paragraph, but I'm so tired of looking at it that I don't even care about making them anachronistic at this point.\n\nThe greatest insult of all, of course, is that even among some prog lovers, they're hated like crazy! Among the list of widely acknowledged \"classic\" prog rock groups (note that \"widely acknowledged\" ends up excluding a lot of the major players in prog rock, such as Gentle Giant and Van Der Graaf Generator; by widely acknowledged I basically mean bands that somebody who knows older music solely through classic rock radio or games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero might be familiar with) they often tend to be rated near the bottom, even below some bands that I despise (like Styx or Kansas). Now, for many, a sufficient explanation of this is simply, \"ELP sucks!\". Needless to say, I think that is a grave mistake, but I think I can make a good estimation on the real reasons people despise this band. The first, and the most obvious, was the group's relatively heavy emphasis on classical music in their sound. Yes, progressive rock almost always has at least a tinge of some classical elements, but ELP's music had the greatest concentration of it in their music, BY FAR. Now, it's not as if that was the only type of music they did, not at all, but among their discography you can find covers of Copland, Holst, Bartok, and they even did a full album rendition of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. Their self-penned material would also sometimes have a pure 'orchestral' feel as well, and they even managed to help create a new and totally bizarre genre, the 'rock-symphony.'\n\nThe band's classical leanings, however, are not the only significant difference between ELP and the others on the list. A key thing to note about ELP is that, besides King Crimson, most other widely known prog rock groups weren't prog-groups from the get-go. Yes started as a jazzy, psychedelic rock band, and it wasn't until their third LP that they really became Yes as we know them. Rush began as a hard-rock garage band, modeling themselves after Led Zeppelin and Cream. And Genesis, well, Genesis started as a bunch of teenagers trying to sell pop songs to the public and not succeeding one iota (which is a shame, seeing as there are tons of great melodies on their debut). ELP, however, was \"pretentious\" and progressive from the very beginning, which makes sense. Both Keith Emerson (The Nice) and Greg Lake (King Crimson) were former key members of groups that had pretty much created the genre, and as such one could only expect them to continue what they seemed to have a knack for. Add in Carl Palmer's technically perfect drumming, and you have a group created for pretentiousness and lots of it.\n\nThere is one more aspect that sets ELP apart from the other groups, and that deals with the center of the band's sound. Rush focused on the blistering chops of their guitar and bass players. Yes, regardless of Wakeman's presence, rotated around their amazing bassist, Chris Squire. Genesis tried to emphasize Peter Gabriel's vocals and his bizarre fantasies over the chops of the group, which were definitely fine overall but hardly in the super-elite level of the rock world. In the Court of the Crimson King, regardless of all of the mellotrons, was extremely guitar heavy, not to mention the saxophones and other reed instruments. ELP, however, did not revolve around a guitar or bass player like the others. ELP was always centered on the keyboards of Keith Emerson (the songwriting and guitar work of Lake was an essential counterweight to Keith's keyboards, but it was still secondary). Now, it's not that he was a bad player, FAR from it. It's just that, well, he could be a bit too showoffy. Plus the fact that he often employed some extremely bizarre and occasionally annoying synth tones that few others would even touch. And since most people would rather hear guitar wanking than synth wanking, it's only natural that there would be a huge turn-away from this group.\n\nI think I have made it sufficiently clear that ELP is not for everyone. The thing is, for the longest time I refused to give them even the slightest chance, and that's a shame, because they're really quite good! For starters, each of them was a highly talented and extremely professional musician, and even haters of the band have to give them that. Keith Emerson, let's face it, was almost indisputably the greatest keyboardist on earth, hands down (I think he was officially given the title by some renowned magazine twenty five times in a period of thirty years). Hence, he was often able to make large parts of the group's compositions come alive by the sheer force of his talent alone, whereas in the hands of any lesser player it might have been deadly boring. Meanwhile, just as important for the group was vocalist/guitarist/bassist Greg Lake. With the exception of Justin Hayward and a few others, almost nobody was a better rock singer than him in the 70's. He was always able to add incredible power and powerful emotional content to the highly abstract and bizarre lyrics that always accompanied the group's music. And one should certainly not minimize his guitar and bass playing, not at all. And finally, there was drummer Carl Palmer, as fine a prog drummer as one could find in the world; with an impeccably fluid and solid playing technique, his playing abilities in the prog universe were surpassed only by Bill Bruford himself.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that impeccable instrumental technique is not the only requirement for being a good and distinctive progressive rock band. After all, if all I cared about was great playing abilities, I would be sitting here reviewing various jazz recordings rather than talking about rock and its various forms. You see, it's a common misconception that the band was primarily a medium for the grandiose ambitions of Emerson. Now, don't get me wrong, the man could write an excellent and supremely catchy synth passage (Karn Evil 9.1 in particular), but in no way was Keith the sole creative epicenter of the band's music (at least, most of the time, when the band was at its best). No, that honor fell just as much to Lake, who was an extremely talented pop song and ballad writer. I mean, grandiose and overblown as Tarkus is, it's really just three short, very catchy Lake numbers whose various musical themes are expanded upon with the help of Keith's synths and are reprised in just the right amounts. And that's hardly the only example, as great songs like Lucky Man or Still, You Turn Me On will show.\n\nIn any case, the point I'm trying to make is that the music of ELP, in general, is nowhere near as intimidating as it is often made out to be. If you're looking for solid pop and rock embellished with a bit of jazz and a healthy amount of classical and symphonic aspirations, you shouldn't be afraid to give them a try. I used to rate them as a two-star band, but surprisingly found that my enjoyment of the band has only increased over time (in particular, the debut REALLY grew on me, as you'll see in a bit), so a three-star rating (out of five) seems appropriate enough. Now go ahead and flame me for liking them as much as, say, Led Zeppelin.\n\nWhat do you think of ELP?\n\nBarry Allen Schnorr (bas29.cornell.edu)\n\nAlso, I'd like to respond to a few things on your general discussion of ELP...right or wrong, King Crimson is my favorite band, and I hope that by the time you get around to reviewing them, I will have forgotten who you were and say \"John McFerrin? He was the quarterback for the Baltimore Orioles back in the 90's, wasn't he?\" What on earth were you thinking when you called '80s crimson \"primarily New Age\"? It bears no more similarity to New Age (author's note: that's WAVE Barry, New WAVE) nonsense than Yes's foray into '80s pop, and maintains the band's old artistic sense. As to the latest incarnation, THRAK included Soundscapes and songs like \"Inner Garden\"--not their best work, I admit, but to call it \"progressive-*gasp*-punk\"...I can't ask what you were thinking, I must ask what you were _smoking_.\n\nAnd limiting the number of aceepted progressive groups to 5? I can understand your leaving out the Moody Blues and Procul Harum and even Jethro Tull (though I don't) but calling Pink Floyd not-prog? I simply cannot agree with you there, and neither can the people who compiled The Progressive Rock Era. When people ask me for examples of prog, I always mention Pink Floyd because they may be the only group the ignoramuses have heard of. Gentle Giant is too obscure to make the list? What about early period Alan Parsons Project, which even Dr. Evil's kid knew was a progressive rock band? Well, my point is not to disagree with what you said about the bands, it's just that to say there was only 5 \"widely acknowledged\" progressive rock groups sounds kind of silly. And, of course, just to contradict for the sake of it, because I'm an agressive, objectionable prick, just like all ELP fans.\n\nGeorge Starostin (gstarst.yahoo.com)\n\nI'd just like to mail an objection to Barry Allen Schnorr...\n\nI think, Barry, that it all boils down to what one actually calls 'progressive' music (or progressive rock). Why argue about the term with foam at your mouth when it's obvious that you and John mean different things under it? Apparently, you use it in the broader term, that's rather the equivalent of 'art-rock' in general. John, on the other hand, is limiting the term to a specific genre of music - rock music with a very heavy classical influence and an overall obscure, mystical, and most often bombastic atmosphere around it. That's what I usually understand as 'progressive' as well; it's better to limit the term so that it wouldn't be confused with 'art-rock' in general, which, in my understanding, is a far wider sphere of music (basically, 'prog' is one of the numerous form of 'art-rock').\n\nIn this respect, Pink Floyd are certainly NOT prog-rock: they had glimpses of prog in the early Seventies around them, like with Atom Heart Mother, for instance, but since Dark Side, they abandoned all prog in favour of a more commercial, simplified approach. I do not make any positive/negative statements here, mind you, just telling facts as they are.\n\nAlso, John is right in saying there are only five 'widely acknowledged' prog bands. If you are a prog lover, you'll be offended by this, of course; but I'm sorry, the name 'Gentle Giant' says nothing to the general public (a shame, but so it is), and Alan Parsons Project is crap, so it SHOULD say nothing. As for Jethro Tull, they certainly were a prog-rock band, too, but only somewhere in between 1972-79. And, of course, it's ridiculous that you should confuse 'New Age' with 'New Wave'. And what do you mean by 'New Age nonsense'? Have you ever listened to Brian Eno?\n\nGeorge Starostin\n\nBarry Allen Schnorr (bas29.cornell.edu)\n\nOK, I'm sorry I parsed \"New Wave\" as \"New Age\". I don't use the term \"New Wave\" very often, even though I do like some New Wave music and, now that I think about it, '80s King Crimson could definitely be said to be New Wave. When I originally read your site, I had King Crimson's Three of a Perfect Pair in my CD player with \"That Which Passes, Passes Like Clouds\" playing and I parsed your phrase as \"New Age\" and thought, \"This song for one is kind of ambient and a half assed attempt to be trippy, kind of like Enya, so maybe you could call this version of Crimson New Age BUT ONLY BY AN EXTREME STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. Which is true. But irrelevant. I missed the boat on that one. Then again, I may have a completely wrong idea of what the definition of New Age is, but I don't care.\n\nBy the way, I'm not budging on this \"progressive punk\" thing. Whether you use a more narrow definition of 'prog' or a broader one, I think you have to agree that prog and punk are not only opposites but mortal enemies.\n\n(author's note): In theory yes, but on the other hand, we did have groups like Metallica, who in their early days could certainly have been called both a progressive and a punk (well, thrash actually, but thrash is more or less descended from punk) band. Also, Barry, you should know that before I said anything about Crimson, I made sure to consult with my brother, a HUGE fan of the Fripper gang, and it was he who proposed the punk-prog idea. I merely agreed with him.\n\nMaybe Fripp has said that he admires punk, but that is just one more reason why I cannot take seriously anything he has said since about 1989.\n\nFleetwood the Artistite (fleetwoodwm.yahoo.com)\n\nWe, as with anyone else agree and disagree on ceratin points, such as what we like and dislike about particular ELP songs. I shan't argue that. Opinions are opinions. However there are a few factual flaws and points that need mentioning:\n\n- \"various tones he could coax out of his mellotrons and keyboards\" Keith Emerson never played a mellotron - it would be interesting to know why he never did\n\n- besides, you're not the first person to metion mellotrons sepaearately from keyboards. On King Crimson's first album, Ian McDonald is credited with playing \"keyboards and mellotron\" I thought the mellotron is, without doubt, a keyboard instrument, and therefore needn't be mentioned sepearately.\n\n- I never before thought of \"The Three Fates\" and \"Tank\" as being one large piece, but as sepearate tracks. I listened to the CD and realised that the continuity and lack of space (which exists between most tracks on CDs) would suggest such. The fact that a CD is divided into distinct tracks emphasises...anyway - the clavinet on \"Tank\" has a fantastic sound!\n\njesusmyth.arabia.com\n\nIch habbe gelost ein fohrtz. I had one grunch but the eggplant over there. Close cover before striking. 5 years or 50,000 miles. No interest until February. Accept credit cards at your website! Toora Loora Loora, it's an Irish melody.\n\nYour opinions ain't worth shit, buddy.\n\nELP and Brain Salad Surgery is up there among the gods of Rock.\n\nKerry Canfield (keriz.teleport.com)\n\nDon't know how long your site's been going, so I don't know if this is new news or not. While we were listening to \"Emerson, Lake & Palmer\" (that is, the first album) at my parents' house, my mom told me that much of \"The Barbarian\" is adapted from Bela Bartok's piece called \"Allegro Barbaro\" (seems I had even played the original at one time myself and had forgotten about it!). Then a year or so later I happened to check out of a library a classical album with a Hindemith piece on one side and some piece called \"Sinfonietta\" by some Hungarian guy named Janacek of whom I'd never heard. Just for the heck of it I listened to the Janacek first. When I heard the first few chords, my jaw dropped--it sounded like the opening to \"Knife Edge.\" The further I listened, though, I realized it was definitely not coincidence; except for the Bach excerpt in the middle and the organ soloing, the entirety of \"Knife Edge\" was lifted--melody, harmony, and rhythm--from the first section of the Janacek piece.\n\nAnd yet Mr. Best Rock Keyboardist never gave these composers he RIPPED OFF (and how can one call it anything else?) until years later in \"Keyboard\" magazine, where he admitted when questioned by a reviewer that, yes, he'd used someone else's music, but he'd thought his \"borrowings\" were sufficiently removed from the originals not to be plagiarism. Interesting, though, that he credited Copland on other recordings, and Mr. Copland happened to be alive at the time--whereas Bartok and Janacek were definitely long dead (and presumably their estates lacked the international clout to claim their due).\n\nIt gets worse (though going back in time). Emerson had the unmitigated gall to state in the same interview that he \"thought\" that \"Rondo\" by the Nice had \"contained some quotes.\" Not even one oblique reference to the fact that the core of the piece (and the unfortunate excuse for several minutes of additional keyboard wankery) was an unabashed reworking into 12/8 meter of Dave Brubeck's \"Blue Rondo a la Turk,\" which was in 9/8 time. To add insult to injury, then, not only did he not credit the true composer, he turned a piece with a truly captivating meter and rhythm (especially when considered in the context of most jazz of the time) into a pointless, heavy handed 4/4 jig!\n\nI've been an Emerson fan ever since the first LP, but this business always sat wrong with me, and since I've seen no one else mention it on this page, I felt compelled to do so. Thanks for listening.\n\nEric Williamson (erwill.suitandtieguy.com)\n\nI think that one of the things your forget to mention is that ELP had a shameless sloppiness about them that was not present in any other prog bands, the exception being the Islands-period King Crimson.\n\nThe sloppiness is one of the things I find charming about the band. The other is their extreme emotional dynamic, half the time super-serious and half the time super-ridiculous.\n\nJohn Capogreco (capogreco.CIDTEC.COM)\n\nYou were correct when you stated that Keith Emerson has played a Mellotron. If anyone doubts this, just check out the intro to \"Eruption\" on Tarkus. Those layered human voice \"ahhh's\" that slowly fade in are indeed played on a Mellotron. Besides, the instrument is listed in the liner notes along with all the other keyboards used.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think that it's impossible for anyone who doesn't personally know Keith to say with certainty that he \"has never played\" any particular instrument.\n\nrob kipp (rkipp.si.rr.com) (8/25/01)\n\nFirstly, Keith Emerson has NOT used a Mellotron. Tarkus was recorded in 1971, there were no choir sounds on the Mellotron at that time (The M400 came out at the end of 1971, Tarkus was recorded at the beginning). Keith has said that he does not use it because it is playing playing back what someone else recorded, which would go against his \"principles.\" (I don't understand why, that's what he said though). However, Greg Lake used one on stage only once or twice in 1972 when they tried to play \"Abaddon's Bolero\" live, which obviously did not work. All of the choir or string sounds used up until \"Works\" (where he used a whole orchestra) came from the Modular Moog or Minimoog.\n\nHaving said that, some people have complained about the narrowing down of the important prog groups to only five. I think the list is pretty good. These five band have had the most commerical influence on other groups, so they are the most important, but not necessarily the best. (My favorite is Genesis personally). I could not count Pink Floyd under the criteria of quasi-orchestral fullness and bombast, but in terms of sheer ambition, I don't think any other band has released FIVE concept albums, one a double! Lyrically, their scope is as far-reaching as the \"real\" prog groups, if a little more direct. Jethro Tull I wouldn't consider as well, because their influences came not from European classical music of the 19th and 20th century, but from folk and Renaissance music influences, which is not classical in the sense that we use it in now.\n\nI do enjoy ELP's music, but I think their instrumental virtuosity was definitely overpowering, and sometimes overbearing, when compared with the virtuosity of Genesis and Gentle Giant (sort of middle-ground) and Pink Floyd (no real virtuousity, though I love David Gilmour as a guitarist). They were the most directly classically influenced-group, and were very important in bringing some classical music to a mainstream audience. Keith Emerson, like it or not, has to be regarded as the best keyboard player ever to emerge from the rock era, no \"rock\" musician has ever attempted anything like their own piano concerto!? Greg Lake is a distinctive bassist and unbelievable singer (though I still believe he never sounded as good as he did on \"In the Court of the Crimson King\") and Carl Palmer is an unbelievable drummer. It's a shame their output since 1977 has been so spotty, unlike Crimson or Yes or Genesis. They are very much an important part of prog-rock who deserve respect at least if not the adoration of music fans or prog fans alike.\n\nSteven Knowlton (knowstev.med.umich.edu) (10/11/01)\n\nTo weigh in on the \"is a mellotron a keyboard instrument\" issue, I'd like to say: The mellotron is not a musical instrument at all - it's a form of tape recorder. The playback function is controlled by a keyboard, and the tapes can be arranged to play a pattern like that of a keyboard instrument, but technologically, it's still a tape recorder. The same effect could be achieved, much more laboriously, by splicing tape together.\n\njohn sieber (oneofakind151.hotmail.com) (10/15/01)\n\nMr. Knowlton:\n\nA Mellotron is indeed a tape recorder. And both the Synthesizer and Hammond organ are computers. And the piano and pipe organ are machines. Please.\n\nNo offense intended here, but... please.\n\nTheeRubberCow.aol.com (12/28/01)\n\nIt is a shame that they get so much hatred. I don't like when they do classical pieces like \"Fanfare For the Common Man\" and stuff like that, but they have got some great stuff! \"From the Beginning\" has some of the best sounds I've ever heard on the radio, and the really electronic sounds that Keith uses on \"Brain Salad Surgery\" are awesome. Not to mention some good songwriting, and a great singer....esp. on \"The Enless Enigma.\"\n\nsplazo.telus.net (1/08/03)\n\nI often hear the claim that Keith Emerson is the best rock keyboard player of all time, but I have yet to figure out why people say such things. For starters, he can't really play a decent solo. Perhaps the fact that he's tone deaf is the thing holding him back. Just listen to the rubbish solo in lucky man. He's sliding the pitch bend on his synth allover the place and never really hitting an in tune note. I'd always figured that being the petulent wanker that he is, he was simply trying to sabotage Lake's pretty little ballad, but maybe that's just really the best he can play.\n\nAnother serious shortcoming of his playing is that he can't really play all that quickly. Not that I put much stock in sheer speed as a redeeming feature of music, but it seems a fairly objective measure of chops. It's pretty obvious that when he's getting himself all worked up into a lather in one of his frenzied wankathons that he's playing as quickly as his big dorky hands will carry him, and that speed simply isn't up to par compared to the competition.\n\nAlso, his melodic sense is more than a little lacking. Just listen to the solo in Tiger In A Spotlight for instance. It's like he's used up everything he meant to play before the allotted number of bars had elapsed and he's just stuck there without a plan running down the clock. Best keyboard player in the world and he can't count to 16. Then consider all the sheer crap that he dared to slap on a record and try to pass off as music on Pictures At An Exhibition. Shameless meowling without metre melody or chops.\n\nI'm not saying he outright sucks. Just that he's far from head and shoulders above the competition. Rick Wakeman at full gallop is easily 50% faster than Emerson at full throttle. Compare the solos from White Rock to those on Karn Evil 9. No contest. Also notice that Wakeman can bend the pitch all over the place and land on in tune notes at will. That's the difference that having an ear makes. ( White Rock, imho, isn't an especially good Wakeman record, just one where his synth soloing admits of direct comparison to those of Emerson, much to the disadvantage of the latter. Almost any Wakeman album will have solos beyond the technical abilities of Emerson.)\n\nTony Banks can only play a solo at about the same speed as Emerson, but his melodic sense and ability to ration his chops evenly over the time allotted for the solo similarly leaves him as an overall more impressive soloist. As an accompianist his chops put those of Emerson to shame. ( Well, not really since Emerson is totally shameless, but if he were capable of shame they would. ) Check out the intricate overhanded tremello chording throughout The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway for instance. A truly amazing display of virtuosity if you take the time to notice. The nice thing is though, that you don't have to notice, because the song works just fine without drawing your attention to the incredible workout that Banks is getting on the song. What strikes the listener is a richly textured song rather than some hyperactive prima dona who has to keep his hands busy.\n\nGiven that Emerson simply doesn't measure up when compared to either of his chief prog rival keyboardist, I'd have to conclude that the wildly hyperbolic claims as to his abilities arise more from the manner in which his sub par skills have been packaged. While Wakeman ( even on his solo outings ) and Banks are generally presented in the context of a full 5+ piece band, Emerson was only able to hog the amount of ice time he wanted by dispensing with all other treble clef instruments in his band. ( In fact, when Lake left King Crimson to join ELP, Fripp offered to come along too, but Emerson nixed that proposal on the grounds that he wasn't interested in working with a guitarist. ) It's pretty easy for a keyboard player to shine when he's just working with bass and drums, even a tone deaf noodler like Emerson.\n\nphil robertson (philrobertson.shaw.ca) (9/02/03)\n\nhaha man you sure put a lot of energy into hating a band! Whatever, thats your perogative I guess. They were pretentious yes but at least Keith Emerson was a great musician on a technical level, you have to give him that. They had a few nice accoustic ballads too here and there.\n\nMarie (marie.xpressweb.com) (9/08/03)\n\n\"Styx, Journey, Kansas ... all are talentless buffoons with large egos but little else,\"\n\nI'll grant you Styx, but Journey and Kansas talentless? Steve Parry is possibly the greatest male vocalist of the late 70s and early 80s. Journey's talent wasn't in the writing, it was in the execution. They were excellent on stage, and their playing was about as perfect as any artists could hope.\n\nKansas was the opposite. Not that they were bad musicians, but their talent was in their songwriting. They were superb song-smiths. From simple pieces like \"Dust in the Wind\" to complex creations like \"The Wall\" and \"Play the Game Tonight,\" listening to Kansas was always an emotional experience.\n\nYou may not like the mainstream rock musicians from the late 70s and early 80's, but please give credit where credit is due. Were Journey and Kansas over-hyped? Probably. Talentless? Not even close.\n\nPAUL RASANEN (rasanenp.gte.net) (8/07/04)\n\nI saw ELP in 1977 at the coliseum in Seattle. I believe their concert was about a month after I saw Led Zep in the Kingdome. ELP was a far better concert than Zep put on that year. Actually it was one of the best I've seen. How you can rate Bill Bruford over Carl Palmer is beyond me. I have not seen a better drummer ever! Emerson, well, lets just leave that! There's no one close to him. Lake is awesome. Why do you think the Who used him for their latest release! There's my two cents! I like their music! I like a hell of a lot of other rock music. I'd probly say The Who is my favorite.\n\nJoshua Raisen (joshuaraisen.comcast.net) (12/09/04)\n\nStumbled across your page on them, and I bet you wrote all that ten years ago, but hope you don't mind if I felt like writing. Wouldn't know a mellotron if it bit me in the ass, but I always thought Wakeman was a better keyboard player than Emerson, and never thought Greg Lake was anything better than an average guitarist. I dug some of his bass lines, though, and I have to mention the little screeching fills in \"Stones of Years,\" probably the most gut-wrenching thing he ever played. Loved Tarkus. Fucking loved it. Man that album is great alll the way through, and I like side one better than side two. When I was like 19 or 20 I once played side one all the way through and then dd it again before playing side two. Wouldn't even do that with Close to the Edge. Trilogy and Pics at an Exhibition are excellent in my bag, too, but the first one is only OK, and everything else is totally boring. ELP sucked in 1977 like Yes wouldn't suck until 1984, and King Crimson has never sucked that bad, unless maybe 1971.\n\nKansas were a great prog band who rocked like none other (coz they weren't English Art School wankers, of course).\n\nI always thought Genesis were more boring than golf.\n\nGreat story about the Sex Pistols burning effigies of Keith Emerson (and I'm sure you know that John Lydon wore (I Hate) Pink Floyd T-shirts as early as 1975), but in the end ELP made three great records and the Pistols made one.\n\nI liked those stupid Eglish pub rockers like \"Are you Ready Eddie\" and \"Jeremy Bender. Didn't you?\n\nListened to all this prog stuff in high school, when I ranked them Yes, Kansas, ELP, King Crimson, then got into Iron Maiden and Metallica, and did up the punk and hardcore thing in college. Listen to Godpeed you Black Emperor and 90 Day men now. But I'll still pull out Trilogy from time to time.\n\nsailing2427 (sailing2427.rogers.com) (12/16/04)\n\nBill Bruford a better drummer than Carl Palmer; man you are out to lunch!!!!\n\nSteve Winkler (spwinkler.hotmail.com) (03/06/04)\n\nSo you don't like prog rock as a style of modern music? Fine, but what I'd like to know is how many of you are serious musicians? What I have typically found is that those who are the most critical of prog rock musicians can't even play chopsticks on the piano. Back in the day, prog rock groups tended to be the favorites of a lot of serious rock musicians because of the technical structure of the music and the challenge it presents to write and play it. Look, Led Zeppelin was a great rock band but you gotta admit, the stuff that Zeppelin wrote was a heck of a lot easier to write and play than say what ELP, Yes, Kansas or Rush wrote. And speaking of groups like Kansas, have you lost your (#$%#*.$) mind? Give a listen once again to songs like \"Spider\" or \"Paradox\". Prog rock players/writers like Keith Emerson, Steve Howe, Greg Lake, Steve Walsh, Bill Bruford, Alex Lifeson, Rick Wakeman, Kerry Livgren, Chris Squire etc. could WRITE AND OR PLAY \"circles, squares, rectangles etc.\" around 95% of the NO TALENT feces of today who try to pass themselves off as musicians. I mean you have got to be kidding me! Let any one of your suck ass punk band no-counts come to one of my rehearsals and just see how lost they would be. \"duhhhhhh, what's a DMaj7? Sharp, what's that mean?\". \"I'll tell you what it means, it means get the (#$^%) outta' here and go get yourself some lessons or a chord book and learn how to play your ($#%&*#.) intrument!\"\n\nSolomonsOther.aol.com (03/15/05)\n\nI admit it. Keith Emerson can PLAY! Greg Lake can SING! Carl Palmer can DRUM!\n\nI just... god, I just get bored with Emerson's technique so quickly. The man has a lot of energy and can write seriously complicated music... I just wish he'd have been more interested in jazz and not classical music. That rapid fire style of his would've done wonders. Procol Harum and the Moody Blues (two awesome yet underrated bands) have proven than you can blend classical and popular influences and yet not overwhelm the listener. The thing about Emerson is that he rarely takes the time to write out interesting melodies and instead piles layers of keyboards on eachother. Works some of the time, but usually I feel the need to put on Simon and Garfunkel to remind myself of the power of simplicity or something really nasty by Zappa to remind me great art doesn't need to be grandiose... just interesting.\n\nOh, and I wish Greg Lake would play something more often. He's shown himself to be a pretty decent instrumentalist, whenever Emerson is too tired to more or less perform EVERYTHING in a particular song.\n\nPedro Andino (pedroandino.msn.com) (06/25/05)\n\nwhy don't ya' shut your fucking mouth fagwads! buncha 50 cent loving cocklicking fags! nothing like a little prindle styled humor to start your fucking day, bitches! I say the 5 synth players it had to be wakeman! I like wakeman! and trust me his goofy soloing in the song golden age was pretty funny! but when songs like and you and I came out his solos are tastefuly done. tony banks is the best. the intro to firth of fifth was the most beautiful intro by tony. emerson was good but guys I'm sorry I must say love beach is better than failed flops like black moon and calling all stations and union. I like the sound of mellotrons. journey rocks you fag! kansas rocks to! 50 cett is a faggoty CONSUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fuck off ya' trendwhores!\n\nTrfesok.aol.com (06/07/06)\n\nThe thing about ELP, I think, is that they became victims of their own ambitions. Particularly Emerson's. They were willing to try anything at least once, continually pushing at the boundaries between rock, classical and jazz. Part of the problem is that most of the fans were not willing to go the distance. Not everybody wanted to hear a full length piano concerto on one of their albums, for instance. They were bound to, sooner or later, run up against the limits of their deep talents sooner or later, and unable to go backwards into standard pop territory too well. Nonetheless, they did come up with some music that still is mind-boggling today.\n\nYou do point out one thing -- that they steered a lot of listeners towards the classics. By starting to look for \"real\" versions of the pieces that ELP used, I began to develop appreciation for and enjoyment of classical music. Even today, I'm still seeking out some of the more obscure ones!\n\ndelettao.peoplepc.com (06/07/06)\n\nELP was/is the absolute pinnacle of ostentatiousness and pretention! I find all of their material to be thoroughly unlistenable and almost everyone I knew back in the seventies that was a big fan of this band was a pen clicking self-important quasi-intellectual blacklight poster trip art bongbrain asshole as well. I find their keyboard oriented progressive rock approach to be sterile, boring, extremely condescending and just basically full of shit. I also agree with your estimations of Kansas, Journey and Styx, three other godawful reasons to avoid classic rock radio stations. Give me the Circle Jerks or something, please! This band was never any good or any fun. And I don't want to be \"coaxed\" into listening to revamped classical music compositions by Mr. Emerson either...go to hell!\n\nPedro Andino (pedroandino.msn.com) (07/24/06)\n\nshut the fuck up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! goddamn I am tired of faggots like you insulting my band. hey! faggot just bought the new 50 cent album! eat cock you fucking trendwhores!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRay Worden (rworden.inebraska.com) (01/30/07)\n\nWell I just stumbled across this site. So I will offer my opinion on Emerson Lake and Palmer as band, and how this band impacted my life and musical career. I should say at this point that I am a professional musician, and I earn my living making music. I was exposed to Emerson Lake and Palmer in the 70's. I must tell you that I had never heard music like this before. It just blew me away, it was so different than anything I had heard before. I had been listening to the Beatles and the Stones which I really love to this day. Yet in the 70's we were exposed to all that disco crap ! When I heard Emerson lake and Palmer it was breath of fresh air ! Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgury just blew me away ! I wore out those records because I listened to them so many times. I really think that was their best work. So Creative ! Lucky Man, well that was their big hit, yet not my favorite song.\n\nMaybe these guys were not the best musicians on the planet, yet they created something special for us back then. One of the reasons that I do what I do now is because of that band !! And Maybe that is the endless enigma !! :-)\n\nSteve Winkler (spwinkler.hotmail.com) (04/29/08)\n\nYou are a pathetic, clueless \"buffoon with a huge ego\" and have little or no idea of how to judge musical talent. I'd like to know how YOU define prog rock because your opinion of who is and who isn't a true prog rock band does not square with the general consensus from the late 60's and 70's. Aside from YOUR narrow opinion of what constitutes prog rock and or talent, prog rock came to be known as a style of music which drew mainly upon classical, jazz, and other influences. It was typified by the variety of time signatures, syncopation, counterpoint, modal chord progressions, allusions (or direct \"ripoffs\" as you would probably say) from well known and not so known Baroque, Classical and Romantic pieces, atonal and even at times expressionist music styles which were totally alien to pop rock and heavier rock of the time. Granted, most fans and self appointed music critics of prog rock may not have known the nomenclature which I just mentioned, but it was not as \"open ended\" as what you are trying to imply. Although Fan and critic alike may not have been able to define the exact musical definitions, their ear recognized the concepts and so there was a real consensus between fan and music critic alike as to which bands were in the progressive rock genre and which were not. I remember this well because I became a big fan of prog rock in the mid 70's, a musical style which played a part in shaping my identity as a musician.\n\nNow you may hate ELP, and question why Kansas, Jethro Tull and Rush should even be included in the genre of prog rock but all of these bands drew on the use of some or all of the musical styles listed above and were AT THE TIME widely considered to be and included in the genre of prog rock. In 1975 Kansas was rightly considered to be the hottest up and coming prog rock band at the time with their use of different time signatures, counterpoint, a violin which at the time was unheard of in a rock band, syncopation, modality, snippets from baroque and classical pieces. Just because they didn't use the dissonant and expressionist style of a prog band like Genesis or King Crimson doesn't mean they were any less \"prog rock\".\n\nKansas talentless? For you to say they were \"talentless buffoons\" is laughable! Kerry Livgren was a prolific song writer who, on many songs they performed live, would switch back and forth from guitar to keyboards in the course of one song. Both Kerry and Steve Walsh brought their strong classical influences to bear on keyboards as well as Robby Steinhardt on violin. Kansas was WIDELY known at the time by fan and critic alike as one of the tightest bands who were nothing short of phenomenal in concert. What they accomplished is astounding when you consider the level to which they were able to take a prog rock style of music mainstream while staying true to their prog rock roots.\n\njohn erickson (jcerickson1005.msn.com) (12/13/08)\n\nEmerson Lake & Palmer as a group is very much a product of the time with the aspirations to bring classical and rock together. I don't think you could have done it to the effect they did in another time. As such, it is hard for those who come to ELP now with out the background to have an understanding of the band. Much of the music does stand on it's own merit, some does not translate to today's musical ideals since rock music and pop music has shattered into genres that do not allow for the experimentation we saw with ELP. For all that shattering we are not better off today musically, music is divisive not inclusive today.\n\nI give the 4 stars, often brilliant sometimes simpering but they tended to give it all they had every time what ever they were trying to do and that counts for much also. Today there is too much playing it safe with the usual offerings and a lot less ballsy chances being taken.\n\nELP stands alone in their music as pioneers.\n\n\"Bruce\" (Bruxxx.ValleyBeat.Com) (09/13/10)\n\nWow, lots of nasty stuff here to read. It's boring and stupid when people have to argue about this kind of thing.\n\nI like Yes and Rick Wakeman, \"Six Wives Of Henry The Eighth\" used to be one of my favorites of his ... but, as technical as it was, I never hung on to that record because when I played it after a while, it just lacking life. I really don't mean this in a bad way, but there was not vibrancy to it.\n\nI contrast that with Keith Emerson, say playing \"America\". I can listen to it over and over and still as undone as the recording is, and apparently a rehearsal session of that song was released accidentally, it has life in it.\n\nBut I like Yes and I like Rich Wakeman, and there are really very few musicians, actors or people or whatever that I say I like and associate my ego with so that I want to go all over the Internet arguing with people about it. I sure hope people get tired of this at some point.\n\nI liked the classical ELP, and the music, the improvisation of the songs. One thing that bothered me was the pomposity of it. On the one side there was \"Take a Pebble\" for example, a sort classical kind of instrumental (mostly) piece and many others that are just fun to listen to. Then there are the classical wanna-be type songs, Enigma, that are done sort jazz-rocky ... I love that stuff.\n\nThere is always something about most music except some instrumentals that I have a problem with. Most musicians really have nothing much interesting to say, so the lyrics are just boring stuff, like \"Still You Turn Me On\" ... and \"someone get me a ladder\", or \"Trilogy\" the lyrics really make me cringe, but I liked the driving beat and emotion to it. I can't get past those lyrics anymore.\n\n> We tried to lie\n\n> But you and I\n\n> Know better than to let each other lie\n\n> The thought of lying to you makes me cry\n\n> Counting up the time that's passed us by\n\nStill, they're millionaires celebrity musicians that get all the girls and I'm just a dude that used to buy their music.\n\nBut ... when I was a kid I loved ELP, and the sci-fi aspects of Karn Evil 9, was so much fun, and that steel drum interlude solo, fantastic. Iconoclastic, and just energetic. I really liked it. Their later stuff I just found boring. I don't know what accounts for why I thought ELP's early stuff was so remarkable, and I still listen to it today. I pretty much stopped with \"Fanfare For The Common Man\" which is the last thing they did that I really loved.\n\nNow ... me, I have really nothing to say much about the Sex Pistols. I just found that whole scene to be negative, ugly, pointless, self-destructive ... kind of like rap. Guess that just makes me uncool and boring. That's OK, I'd rather outlive the cool people anyway.\n\nJethro Tull is probably my favorite band, so maybe that makes me a progressive fan ... I never really thought of it that way, I just like music that seems interesting and has energy to it.\n\nMusic does not mean the same thing to me now that it once did. I don't listen to too much music anymore, I just get tired of it everywhere and all of it used to sell stuff as well.\n\nKeep arguing! ;-)\n\nismaninb.teacher.com (12/13/10)\n\nI am a fan of classical music and not thanks to ELP. In fact I don't clearly remember which music I listened first to in my life, Tchaikovsky or ELP. I have never been a fan of ELP in the real meaning of the world, ie being a fanatic. But I certainly did never despise the band; until today I find ELP highly interesting. And that's mainly because of the efforts to fuse classical music and rock. Still I am going to argue that exactly in thisrespect ELP was inferior to Ritchie Blackmore. ELP's music is based on three pillars. Besides (1) the (pseudo)classical stuff (Emerson plays synthesizers) there is (2) Lake's balladry and(3) the goofy stuff: jazz, country, ragtime, boogie etcetera which revolves around Emerson's piano. And here we meet the first problem with ELP: the band usually strictly separated the three. I think that's a shame as ELP wanted to be a fusion band. Indeed the songs that try to integrate these three aspects are usually the best. It's a pity that there are so few of them, which makes me conclude that overall ELP as a project was a failure.\n\nWhat a huge difference with Blackmore's career! When he was inspired by classical influences he invariably managed to make those rock in a way Emerson and co hardly ever could. It's no coincidence that Blackmore's adaptation of Beethoven's Ode to Joy was artistically far more successful than ELP's adaptation of Pictures at an Exhibition. Blackmore always remained much more independent from the original. Blackmore wanted classical music to rock as hard as possible, often successfully hiding the classical source.\n\nFrom the opposite angle I come to exactly the same conclusion: ELP as a project was a failure. The more obscure Gentle Giant wanted pop/rock music to approach classical standards as much as possible by applying classical composing techniques to poppy themes. One can wonder if GG actually wrote pop music. ELP never went that extreme. Their attempt to write a rock symphony was almost as clumsy as Deep Purple's effort. Compare that to the perfect fugue called On Reflection (live, not the lame and tame studio version) which matches any fugue by Bach and Beethoven! So from an artistical point of view also GG was more successfull than ELP.\n\nStill the fans don't need to desperate. Certainly fans of classical music should know that failures can be extremely interesting - even more interesting than successful projects, which always carry an element of predictability. A failed project can produce excellent, first class music and ELP is a perfect example of this statement. And first class music is what matters in the end. Compository perfection is not always a pre or Rimsky-Korsakov would be the most praised composer in history.\n\nI agree with McFerrin that the three members were perfectly equipped for their band. Emerson was a virtuoso, superior to everybody on keyboards except to Jon Lord on the Hammond. Jon Lord on synthesizers way too often is a horreur. In contrast Emerson generally had an excellent feel for what sounds suited the songs best, at least during ELP's heighdays. Palmer was also a virtuoso, but somehow manages to remain unremarkable. He never spoils a song, but I can't name even a fragment either where his drumming actually adds to the music. Alas I have to disagree with McFerrin about Lake. I can understand why he is so fond of his singing; his voice is very familiar to his beloved Moody Blues indeed. That also means that Lake's singing, with precious few exceptions, is very limited in expression. I know it is a bit of an exaggeration, but I maintain that Lake specialized in tickling the underbelly. That's the kind of perverted romanticism I despise indeed. While recognizing it's qualities, I think Nights in White Satin a very dubious song. Lake's ballads have the same tendencies. This kind of stuff neglects the darker side of human nature, something 19th Century romanticism never did. Fortunately when Lake threatened to become too corny there was usually Emerson's synth arrangement to compensate. The contrast worked very well, so still Lake was the right vocalist for the band. I also maintain that McFerrin overrates Lake's vocal qualities. Sure he had a powerful voice, but it's range was by far not as wide as Gillan's in his prime or Dio's. No way Lake ever could sing stuff like Child in Time or Catch the Rainbow, while neither young Gillan nor Dio would have had any problem with any of ELP's songs. Neither would David Byron of Uriah Heep. Fortunately for ELP prog in general does not require as much from a vocalist as early hardrock did, something which I always have found peculiar, as prog rock demands so much from the instrumentalists. So this is how I evaluate ELP's output. Did they manage to merge the three influences, while making best use of their technical skills? When yes, the songs are excellent.\n\nPS: I don't get Kerry Canfield. It was 1979 or 1980 that I listened to ELP for the first time and I knew from the very beginning that The Barbarian and Knife Edge were adaptations from Bartok and Janacek respectively. So what the heck is he complaining about?!\n\nPPS: not ELP is the most reviled successfull band in the history of rock, Uriah Heep is. Even ELP did not receive a comment like \"If this band is gonna make it I'll have to commit suicide.\" This quote is a Rolling Stone Magazine classic.\n\n\"Alpine Professional Answering Service\" (apas.heritagetelecom.net) (01/13/11)\n\nLucky Man, Jerusalem, Still....You Turn Me On, Karn Evil 9 3rd Impression, The Sage, Pictures at an Exhibition, Nobody Loves You Like I Do, From the Beginning ....sure I'm skipping around albums but those are GREAT songs! I'm 36 years old and just recently discovered ELP when a friend let me listen to Still....You Turn Me On from Cal Jam 74 (which, coincidentally, was the same year I was born). Greg Lake's voice is powerful, haunting, breath taking even and if you doubt me, just listen to Turn Me On from Cal Jam. It's him all alone, no Keith, no Carl, nothing to make his voice anything it isn't. I'm not a huge fan of Keith Emerson although I must admit he's talented. And Carl Palmer...to say anyone compares to him is sheer nonsense. No one then or now even comes close. The band WAS progressive! They pushed boundaries that I've never seen another band push. So maybe they did drag out some songs or even sample classical music through channels that weren't completely legal. They were and are magnificent! THEY were REAL music and musicians....and I will always be a fan! Long live ELP and their fans!\n\n\"Greg Hill\" (ghill003.neo.rr.com) (03/13/11)\n\nEmerson Lake and Palmer was a great band with faults just like any other band. Some of the music is good and some of it is not. Emerson to me was actually the first punk rocker with the Nice. Throwing knives, burning flags and destroying organs if that isn't a punk rock act then explain to me what is? They did overdo the classics but that was expected of them by fans. I personally liked their own stuff over re-do classical or other music. It is sad they always get the bum rap. Speaking of rap, hip hop, pop I can honestly say I'll take any ELP album over any of those forms of music.\n\nMarco González (magonzalez.malaga.es) (04/13/11)\n\nSorry for my english, I'm spanish.\n\nYes, ELP are one of the best bands in the history of popular music. And the fact that even today people keep talking about the old things: pretentiousness, pomposity, and so on, is not important at all. It is just another sample of majority's stupidity. And what, if they are pretentious? Any musical video from any band is pretentious (they think they're so modern, so handsome, who do they think they are?, many songs from early rock'n'roll or early Beatles are silly, a lot of great bands have flaws, and not for that they must be despised.\n\na.. Elvis is overrated. When I listen to music I don't mind about hips movement. Buddy holly is much better, more genuine.\n\nb.. U-2, Nirvana, Radiohead, Sex Pistols are overrated. Any 60's or 70's group is better.\n\nc.. Guitar is overrated. People are obssesed with guitar. Is like if you play a trio with piano/bass/drums, they say \"are you mad?\".\n\nd.. People are dumb. It's not that ELP or Genesis are complicated or pretentious, is just that people is not capable of listening to complicated music. Or maybe they don't mind about it, they are so simple that just want to listen to 3 minutes guitar/bass/drums songs.\n\ne.. And is sad, very sad, because they are even proud of being dumb or simple (the exact word in spanish for what I mean is \"simplón\").\n\nf.. The only people that have the right to critisize ELP are the real experts in classical music. The rest, shut up.\n\n50 years from now, Elvis, U-2, Radiohead, Police will be forgotten (and they are great bands!!). Just the likes of Beatles, Rolling, Zeppelin or ELP will resist the passing of time (of course, just among the music experts; the rest will be listening to what is in fashion then).\n\nLong live MUSIC. Fuck fashion, long/short hair, hips movement and all the rest.\n\nJohn (duroby.gmail.com) (01/13/13)\n\nHello John.\n\nThank you for your site.\n\nI find some of the comments to be interesting, others quite abusive; and for what reason? The most unfortunate aspect of the comments, to me, is how many comments make absolute statements in the form \"I think xxx is best, so yyy is crap.\"\n\nTo me it does not matter if ELP, or the performers in the band, were the very best. The simple thing is that they had a vision for a style of music, brought it to us, and I enjoyed their music when I was introduced to them. When I listen all these years later, I usually find that same enjoyment. I am quite cautious when it comes to listening to new material, and I first heard Tarkus at the friend's home. It was interesting, and I ended up buying a few ELP LPs. It was quite interesting to hear what Greg Lake had moved to after King Crimson. Nevertheless, over the years I have to say ELP are not a band I listen to all that often.\n\nThere do seem to be a few things unstated on your site. Around the time ELP formed, there were several other bands and musicians working around the various different ways that pop or rock music could be merged with various classical music elements - so Pete Townsend was using a bow on his guitar, and creating rock operas. Led Zeppelin did rather similar things, particularly in creating something like a rock opera movie. Orchestral instruments were finding their way back into the backing elements (this is a repeating process, for instance Buddy Holly had used them). Genesis' Lamb Lies Down On Broadway was mentioned, but it was also Gabriel trying to create a kind of rock opera. Magna Carta was trying to create something along those lines with Lord Of The Ages. Brian Eno was working through his fascination with Pachelbel, and much later working with David Bowie on Philip Glass' Low and Heroes symphonies. Sky was a merge of classical, jazz and rock musicians, and so their music followed that mix. These groups and performers are very far from a complete list.\n\nSo I viewed ELP's efforts within the context of a lot of experimenting with this overarching approach, and over quite a few years. Did all of it succeed for me? Not really, despite the good work by most of them, the main thing it achieved was to encourage me to listen to more classical music.\n\nBut I hasten to add that this is my appreciation, nobody else's. Equally, I do not care if Emerson was/is better than Wakeman; they are both very good, but I do not happen to like everything either did. Is Greg Lake the best singer? I do not care, he is very good, and his singing has provided me with many hours of enjoyment. Is Carl Palmer a better drummer than Bill Bruford? Again, I do not care, I like material from both, and from Keith Moon and Phil Collins. I could inject another comparison, between guitarists; and again, I do not really care who is the best. I enjoy Fripp, Howe, Zappa... etc etc. They all bring something different to the world of music, they tend to influence each other, and it would be a lesser place without all of them. RIP Frank.\n\nThere are genres of music where I have not found much I like - rap for instance. But I am far too old to have come to rap when young, and that seems necessary for any genre of music. I do not have the sort of background that spawned rap either, that background provided so many people with an expression they have made their own. So, even as I now choose not to listen to it, I do not criticise the music.\n\nI hope this does not start a flame war against me; but the fact is that I try to accept the songs I like regardless of who writes or performs them. Despite being drawn back to my progressive rock collection all the time, I also have punk in there, and all sorts of other genres in between. I try to open myself up more as I get older, not criticise the musicians and bands I have not personally found interesting.\n\nI hope this might encourage such an approach in some of the other visitors to your site.\n\nMeans Johnston (meansiii.me.com) (05/13/16)\n\nI was able to see ELP on their Trilogy tour in 1972. They were still playing \"America/ Rondo\" as the encore. Mr Emerson liked to have fun at this point in the show and rocked that Hammond B3 organ. He was emulating Mr Hendrix only on the organ.\n\nI saw the Brain Salad Surgery tour and it was quite a show!\n\nI saw subsequent tours and they were always good.\n\nI really appreciate their studio work as well. I do not have to listen to the recordings. I can just think of a recording and it comes to mind!\n\nGael Prigent (gael.t.prigent.gmail.com) (05/13/16)\n\nI have been re-listening to some of their albums since Keith Emerson just pasted away (RIP Keith, you will be missed).\n\nAfter thinking about bands, composing, and reading about their internal politics (being an amateur musician/songwriter myself) something struck me about this band: every subsequent album was less interesting than the one before. And this for a simple reason: they couldn't write material together.\n\nEmerson came from the Nice where he eventually became the dominant figure and was doing overblown symphonic music, interesting in form but lacking substance (aka melodies). After partnering with Lake, they managed to integrate their qualities and that gave us the first ELP album and the song Tarkus afterward. I believe this was their more interesting period and what made ELP a band to revisit.\n\nSee how Take a Pebble, Knife Edge and Tarkus have both great vocal parts/melodies, merged with proggy instrumentals. Nothing is too long, just the right balance and both aspects fairly complement each other regarding musical themes. Even the Lake song Lucky Man has some proggy Emerson development.\n\nThen internal dissension comes (Lake almost quit during the recording of Trilogy) and more and more you have Lake doing its ballad, and Emerson doing Emerson Extravaganza. You start to feel Lake sings a song (i.e. Trilogy) and then you have Emerson soloing without much connection with the vocal part. Compare this to Close to the Edge where every new theme is feels like a natural progression, coming full circle eventually.\n\nThis becomes very obvious in Brain Salad Surgery where the only collaboration is in some part of Karn Evil in the first Impression, and that's it. I do enjoy the album, I do feel the material itself is a bit stronger than Trilogy, but it is already Emerson doing its thing like it is his solo album, and Lake doing its thing (being covering an English classic or his own ballad). And then you get Works where each member has it's own side!\n\nSo I think the problem with the band, like many other, was that they discovered they couldn't work very closely together. A very real and difficult issue, and I find it fascinating to see how important the human factor can be.\n\nNathan McCue (superquizzie.gmail.com) (07/13/16)\n\nThanks so much for putting that review up there. It is really detailed and It is cool to see someone else's opinion on my favorite band right now. I remember when I read through it (quite a few months ago) and I really disagreed with some things, but I really appreciate all of the information. Thanks!\n\nJames Rinehart (amtmachining.outlook.com) (12/13/16)\n\nThanks for your review.\n\nI was there, most every tour in the US from the early days to the final days. I was there to watch the cathartic and almost hypnotic effects of the music they instilled upon the masses, including the California Jam where they were the headliner that played to near 400K music lovers. I saw tears streaming down faces of young and old as they played their enhanced version of Pictures at an Exhibition, and yes, their enhancements to some may be perversion, but the fact that millions found a new way to listen to those tired old tunes helped to reinvigorate classical music that very few bands ever had the balls to do.\n\nTo insult any musical entity, whether it be classical, big band, rock, punk, metal, rap, or prog, shows a basic lack of the mental capacity to understand the nuances and depth(whatever that may be) that the musician, artist or composer has attempted to display, whether in the moment, or in their struggle to impart some meaningful offerings. People dont have to like it as a daily diet, but for those of you calling it crap shows ignorance and the inability to understand music as one the most powerful forces in the human consciousness.\n\nBirth Of A Band - Isle Of Wight Festival - 2006 Eagle Vision\n\n8\n\n(Good / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Rondo (minus the drum solo)\n\nThe thing that irritates me most about this album is the fact that, despite lots of leftover space, it heavily abridges this performance from the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. There apparently used to be a limited release version of this concert, with full performances of The Barbarian (conspicuously absent here), Take a Pebble and Pictures at an Exhibition, and I'd have really appreciated having a chance to hear them. On the other hand, that album lacked the band's performance of Rondo, so I guess this isn't a total loss. It's done just as it was when Emerson was with The Nice, and aside from the rather pointless drum solo (though done in Palmer's usual technically immaculate manner), it's a lot of fun to listen to. It's not quite on the level of The Barbarian in the realm of rock adaptations of non-rock numbers, but it's close, and Emerson's keyboards are always entertaining when they're angry-sounding (the original Nice version is amazing, this version is good but doesn't have quite the same apocalyptic charm).\n\nThe bulk of the album is taken up by the opening rendition of Pictures at an Exhibition, which is cut from its actual length by about a third, but is edited fairly well. Unlike the much later Works Live edit, this at least touches on all the parts that show up on Pictures at an Exhibition (The Sage is here, as is The Old Castle/Blues Variations), and it ends up working well as an effective 'timesaver' version of PaaE. And actually, Nutrocker is here too, so I guess that, were one so inclined, one could opt for purchasing this instead of PaaE, even if I definitely wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWhat's here of Take a Pebble is nice as well, but unfortunately that's the only other track here. In the end, then, I'm kinda disappointed by the sparseness of this release, even if it is one of those dualdisc albums that also features a 5.1 mix of the audio. It's a neat historical document (it was the band's second performance, predating the release of its fabulous debut album), and it's fun to imagine the cannons going off at the end of The Great Gates of Kiev, but except for the rousing Rondo, I can't highly recommend it.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nDaniel Bosch (bicycle_legs.optusnet.com.au) (09/29/07)\n\nCouldn't agree more. Thankfully I picked this up cheap. I think it's a matter of expectation - I was expecting a concert DVD, what I got was a documentary. There is a CD version of the actual concert, and it's pretty neat, but I would love to see ALL the footage of the performance. It must exist.\n\n\"Graham Berrisford\" (grahamberrisford.gmail.com) (09/13/10)\n\nOn their first four or five albums and on Black Moon, most ELP tracks are interesting and enjoyable; and some are thrilling in a way it is hard to find elsewhere. Some lyrics are naive or nonsensical, but who cares are about the words when Keith's keyboards and Greg's voice are so briliant? I do wonder at people taking such a dislike to them, and wonder if you need to have learnt to play a musical instrument to appreciate the complexity of the music?\n\n*Emerson Lake And Palmer - 1970 Atlantic*\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: Lucky Man or anything on side one\n\nBoy, did THIS album ever grow on me. When I first reviewed it, I basically liked it, but only gave it the equivalent of an 8 (which explains a shocked email below). Then a couple of days later, I realized I was being a bit of a hardass and upped it a smidge. Then when I thought it would go no further, I eventually found something that basically shocked me - not only had this album managed to sneak its way into my top 100 overall (for a while, anyway), it had managed to be an important reason in my upgraded opinion of ELP as a great band. Brain Salad Surgery may be the focus of ELP's fame (for better or for worse), but THIS is the album that makes them deserving of that fame.\n\nIndeed, the first half of this album is just about PERFECT, one of the best sides of any prog album I own. The Barbarian is an astounding opener, an update of an old Bartok piece that takes on a life of its own here. If you're a cynic who says that Emerson's playing is merely self-indulgent tripe that cannot be easily enjoyed by a casual listener, you really need to give this track a listen or three. It took me a while to get into the rest of the album (to varying degrees, anyway), but this track sucked me in right away. The opening distorted bassline/guitarline is much moodier and \"tougher\" than one would stereotypically expect out of ELP, and once Emerson jumps in with his keyboards and begins driving forward theme after theme with his whole array of piano and organ tricks, any expectation of archetypical British \"wussiness\" on the album should fly right out the window. All three are at their very best throughout this track, managing to both demonstrate their huge talent AND make sure that the listener actually cares about what they can do with that talent, with the final result an unabashed prog classic.\n\nThe next track is no slouch either, and quite possibly even better. Take a Pebble is based around an absolutely gorgeous ballad courtesy of Greg, and what truly makes the song magnificent is the soaring and powerful vocal effort that Lake graces it with. Now, I appreciate Jon Anderson's vocal approach as much as anybody, but I will admit that prog tunes benefit when the vocalist is able to (almost) convince the listener that the bombastic and meaningless ravings are actually relevant and, well, emotionally move the listener. And Lake does just that; not that the lyrics are all bad (\"the sadness on your shoulders like a wornout overcoat, in pockets greased and tattered hang the rags of your hopes,\" there's a good line), but they really need that extra oomph in order to make them work. In any case, there's also a really nice middle instrumental section. Parts are in typically bombastic classical motifs, but they really sound interesting (once again, Emerson is at his beautiful best, this time on piano), especially after we get to be enchanted with, of all things, a nice Mississippi-style acoustic ditty (which once again provides a perfect example of ELP's ability to deflate itself at needed times, at least in the early days of the band). As you might imagine, when they performed it in concert, they would stick tons of music between the bookends of the piece, often sticking several of their other tunes in the middle, but this 'miniature' seven or eight minute middle section is wonderful in and of itself.\n\nNext up is Knife Edge, which I once disliked for whatever reason, but I was a F-O-O-L. An adapation of a classical piece (the name and author of which escapes me at the moment), this track is a nearly perfect summary of all of ELP's talents, with almost none of the flaws (except possibly \"self-indulgence,\" but that's just something you have to accept with ELP, and besides, nothing about this track is particularly self-indulgent). The basslines RULE, Lake's vocal delivery is aggressive and forceful in a manner that he didn't use nearly enough in the rest of the band's career (yup, I actually prefer aggressive Lake to bombastic Lake, even though the latter is just great), Emerson's playing is a perfect mix of jarring organ dissonance and blazing organ solos (ALL of which are interesting), and of course Palmer is Palmer. I tell you, when Lake blasts out his, \"CAN YOU STILL KEEP YOUR BALANCE?!!\" vocal near the end, it's absolute meaningless (but not imageless, make the distinction people) bombastic prog bliss for me, and when taken all together, it's little wonder that this is the track (along with The Barbarian, heh) that I use to try to introduce people to ELP (and with a decent level of success, considering that it's ELP, heh).\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of the second half of the album doesn't come close to matching the sheer brilliance of the first, and for many people this is what causes the rating of this to come crashing down like a ton of bricks. The first two tracks of this side, you see, comprise a lengthy (about 15 minutes) instrumental suite, consisting of a multi-part classically-influenced keyboard piece (The Three Fates) and a drum solo (Tank). Upon first (and possibly second, and third) listen, these will come across as a completely self-indulgent mess, and it's possible you may want to dismiss them outright (I know I basically did). On the other hand, though, by making the three sections of The Three Fates distinctive from each other in both sound and mood, not to mention actually somewhat memorable (even for somebody who doesn't spend all day listening to this sort of thing), Emerson found a way to make me enjoy the piece much more than theory says I should, and as such I'm not at all offended by its inclusion on this album. As for Tank, well, it's a drum solo, and I don't much like drum solos, so it does somewhat offend me. That said, I'm amused that the band employs one significant variation on virtually every other drum solo ever recorded, namely that the main riff of the piece is played by keyboards and not by guitar, and as far as the actual solo goes, I think that Palmer is better suited for \"show-off\" soloing than most others I've heard (just because of his incredible technical ability), so I don't hate it as much as I do other solos.\n\nFortunately for all, the album ends not on an ambivalent note (regarding my attitude towards it), but rather on an extremely strong one, courtesy of the radio hit Lucky Man. The song does a wonderful job of reminding the listener that the foundation of the band's greatness lay not with all their instrumental pyrotechnics, but with their ability to create solid \"normal\" songs, with their playing abilities serving as an augmentation and not as a replacement for true inspiration and creativity. The ultimately tragic lyrics work well with the sea chanty-style melody, and while some might gripe that the ending synth solo (filled with all sorts of cool pitch-bending) is tacked on and completely inappropriate (not me, though), there can be no question that it leaves a major impression (for better or worse, depending) on the listener come album's end, and I'm all for leaving strong impressions. Besides, it functions well on a symbolic level as well, a sort of trumpet's call proclaiming the band's entrance into the pantheon of significant artists (at least for a couple of years).\n\nIn short, this is a solid D, and without a doubt my very very favorite ELP album. It's the one that entertains me the most, and furthermore it's the one that interests me the most - after all, even if it doesn't define an entire genre like In the Court of the Crimson King does, it does represent an intriguing projection of modern-classical values onto conventional rock ideas, and that's definitely worth something in my book.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nBarry Allen Schnorr (bas29.cornell.edu)\n\nYou gave ELP a 7? A mere 7? Is that the same 7 that you gave to Octave? The Three Fates is an interesting piece and does not drag the album down as much as you say. And Tank kicks ass! I'm not a fan of drum solos either, and I love it! C'mon, borrow another point off of Pictures at an Exhibition and give it to this album. I'd give it a high 8, maybe even a 9.\n\n(On your system, I'd rate them: ELP-8, Tarkus-7 (maybe high 6), Trilogy-10, PaaE-4, BSS-9, don't have any albums from then on, I'm told they're so-so, I might get them eventually but not before finishing off the Moodies' first 7)\n\nDaniel and Corine Bosch (dcbosch.optusnet.com.au) (6/17/02)\n\nA good debut, but they would do better. To be honest, it has a feeling of \"we need to get something into the marketplace to establish our new group in the public eye\". Still, some great stuff here. \"The Barbarian\" is a fantastic opening, and still my favourite on the album. \"Take A Pebble\" does drag in the middle a bit but the piano is wonderful - one of these days I would love to hear an album of Keith Emerson solo piano pieces. \"Knife Edge\" rocks, \"The Three Fates\" is indulgent but still cool and \"Tank\" rocks - Carl's drums solo is relatively brief and very tasteful, if a little uninventive. \"Lucky Man\" is typical Greg Lake - a nice acoustic ballad with Keith just coming in on the end. I'd give it 8 out of 10.\n\nMeldrain.aol.com (9/15/03)\n\nWow, a 13 for the debut? Can't say I agree with that one. To me their eponymous debut is an exercise in frustration, featuring the best and worst sides of the band (the latter, predictably, manifesting itself in the forms of extreme self-indulgence and unbearable pretentiousness, elements inherent to prog yet not so noxious if a band can control them). Three songs are undeniably (well, technically anything can be denied, so don't take it literally) amongst the trio's best; obviously I'm referring to Lucky Man, Take a Pebble and (especially) Knife Edge. These three alone guarantee a high rating (and Barbarian's good too, of course) but the rest of the album conspires to consign the CD to the chthonic abyss of prog hell, a much nastier representation of it than the mild Vangelis version. The Three Fates suite isn't bad per se, but it is rather tedious. If I want to hear Emerson noodle around I'll listen to the awesome Rondo, or, well, anything that cultivates at least a modicum of excitement. Tank is, of course, atrocious, as is par for the course for drum solos. It's depressing that such an abomination can exist on an album that contains sporadic instances of prog nirvana. In other words, a bipolar album, and Lithium wouldn't help because grunge is incompatible with prog anyway. If the entire album were up to the standards of the three peaks I'd give it at least a thirteen (bad movie, haven't played the videogame). As it is it barely manages to secure a twelve. I'd say their best album is the uber pretentious but immensely enjoyable Brain Salad Surgery, followed by Tarkus. Speaking of that, if you see him would you ask Carl Palmer who'd win in a fight between Tarkus and an Atomic Rooster?\n\n\"Akis Katsman\" (watta502.yahoo.gr) (2/11/04)\n\nExcellent debut. Not 'perfect' by any means (perhaps the two instrumental tracks on side B should have been shorter), but there are some real gems here. \"Take A Pebble\" might be my second favourite ELP composition ever (after KE9), awesome. Greg Lake is a godlike singer. And what about the notorious epics \"The Barbarian\" and \"Knife Edge\"? Essential for any serious prog fan. There's also \"Lucky Man\", a great ballad which was one of the first songs ever to have a synth solo on it. Second best ELP album, after Brain Salad Surgery. 9/10.\n\nFinbar Conlon (finbar.conlon.gmail.com) (10/12/05)\n\nOn your review of ELP's first album, (http://www.johnmcferrinmusicreviews.org/elp.html) I agree with your rating of 10 out of 10. Everything you said about side 1 is right on the money, and your review of Lucky Man, couldn't have said it better myself. A good friend of mine, who got me into ELP (and prog) in the first place, despises that song and anything that has \"Greg Lake\" and \"ballad\" in the same sentence. As such, when he was originally getting me into the band, it was with prog-themed mix CD's, and I got a very skewed picture of the awesomeness of ELP. (Not to mention hearing Karn Evil 9 out of context in a whole new way! Third impression alone!) But yes, bravo. Everything you say about Lucky Man and side one, right on the money.\n\nThe difference here, I guess, is I loved the CD instantly, track to track, more so with each note. Particularly the Three Fates, which is probably my favourite track, and Tank. We'll get to Tank in a second, but first, c'mon! What exactly is everybody's problem with the Three Fates!? That track is pure evil! (Which I mean in a good way.) Sure it's long, but I think the length can be savoured rather than sighed through much like the deserved length of a Pink Floyd solo section or Bach dabbliness. You just gotta listen right, and it's sweeter than sugar.\n\nTank, I think, is actually the balancing track of this album. It's unmatched here, or on any of the other definitive ELP albums, for that matter, in structure. If it isn't to your taste, I guess that really can't be helped, but it's awesome for what it is, plain and simple.\n\nI take issue with you commending Keith's \"organ solos\" on Knife Edge. If the \"organ solo\" that I'm supposing is in question is the Bach-ish stuff over the cowbell in the bridge, it's not an organ solo at all. It's Bach-ish because, well, it IS Bach. Knife Edge, being one of the first ELP tracks I ever heard was, I thought, an amazing example of creativity. It is. Just, Janacek's and Bach's. Not Emerson's.\n\nAll in all, yes, production-wise and creativity-wise, the album sounds rushed, which it is. But it's the good kind of rushed.\n\ndsn2.Lehigh.EDU (04/25/06)\n\nWith regards to the extensive ELP review, the author says in the review of the first side of ELP's first album: \"an adapation of a classical piece (the name and author of which escapes me at the moment), this track is a nearly perfect summary of all of ELP's talents...\"\n\nthat piece is a Bach French Suite. It's the first half of the Allemande that opens the piece. I just learned it in my piano studies.\n\nTrfesok.aol.com (08/28/08)\n\nIt is indeed a solid, high quality release, although I wouldn't say everything quite works. However, two tracks that do work are the ones that \"adapt\" classical pieces. The band did get a lot of heat for initially not crediting their classical sources, but at least they are very creative in rearranging them. For instance, Bartok's original \"Allegro Barbaro\" is a brief, frenetic dance played on solo piano. What they do with the intro to \"The Barbarian\" is brilliant -- they slow down the tempo for the organ/guitar intro, conjuring images of the barbarians slowly creeping up on their victims for conquest. Then Keith goes into the original piano, accompanied by the rhythm section, and the barbarians invade and cause havoc. Very cool.\n\nTo be exact (on the verge of anality!), the verses on \"Knife-Edge\" use the main theme from Leos Janacek's \"Sinfonietta\", while the bridge is indeed the \"Allemande\" from Bach's first French Suite. \"Sinfonietta\" is a slow, ominous military march, and the group slows the tempo even more to make it sound even more menacing. On the other hand, the \"Allemande\" is a gentle, sad piano piece that Keith totally changes, speeding it up and making it extremely violent. The dark lyrics by Lake and roadie Richard Fraser match the music perfectly.\n\n\"Take a Pebble\", on the other hand, qualifies as filler, but highly entertaining filler. The actual song portion is really quite slight (my guess is that it's a King Crimson reject), and that middle guitar jam threatens to disintegrate into \"Moonchild\"-type ambience. What saves the track is Keith's creative piano variations on Greg's melody, although I wonder if he did that to pad time on the album.\n\n\"Lucky Man\" was no doubt so popular at the time because it dove tailed with the anti-Vietnam war movement. Today, it comes off as a bit melodramatic lyrically, but it is a beautiful song, great vocals, great Moog solo.\n\n\"The Three Fates\" has proven to be the most obscure piece here (was it ever played live?). I can hear why -- the first portion with the organ really rambles, although the jazzy piano section at the end with L & P joining in adds some diversity to the album. Finally, \"Tank\" is nothing but two Keith themes linked by a drum solo \"composed\" by Carl (just to get him more songwriting royalties, no doubt). I used to find it really annoying (I find drum solos recorded in the studio to be quite pointless), but it has grown on me over time (the Works Live version, with the orchestra, better emphasizes the jazzy sounds of the music).\n\nAlthough it certainly is part of the band's classic period, I would not vote it the best from ELP. For one thing, the band hasn't really gelled yet -- Keith's keyboard noodlings don't sit entirely comfortably along Lake's folky tendencies. As far as prog rock albums go, there's a little bit too much \"prog\" and not quite enough \"rock.\" The tone is deadly serious -- there aren't any of the more \"fun\", lightweight tracks or enough of the heavier rockers alongside of the classical and jazz influences. Still, it's a must once someone starts getting into ELP. Just don't make it the first stop.\n\n\"Robert Oglesby\" (robert_o1971.sbcglobal.net) (07/13/10)\n\nI just listened to the debut album for the first time in decades and was amazed at how much I did not appreciate what they played when I listened to them when I was 15-18 years old. We just thought it was cool and turned it up real loud!\n\nismaninb.teacher.com (12/13/10)\n\nProgression means going forward, pushing limits. So progressive rock means pushing the limits of rock. ELP certainly did rock now and then, more or less, but I never have noticed much progression after their debut. All the elements I mentioned are already here. Afterwards they would be applied better, but essentially the band never went any further. So is ELP a progressive rock band? For two albums (Tarkus being the other one) at the most. That is as much as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, to put things in perspective.\n\nAll this is just labeling and nothing more. I won't make the mistakes of the progsnobs. What counts is if the music works. Alas in my opinion it doesn't always on this album. The three Fates, Tank and the Barbarian all leave me unimpressed. Lake's acoustic noodling in Just take a Pebble bores me the pants off. Is he inferior to Geddy Lee and Ken Hensley. Even Jimmy Page and Steve Howe are on acoustic guitar more tolerable.\n\nOn to the highlights. Knife Edge is a perfect rockadaptation of a classical theme.by Janacek. Compare Knife Edge with the original and realize how dirty it sounds. Add some mean guitar and it would fit in Deep Purple's catalogue; still it's good as it is. Emerson's Bach paraphrase also rules.\n\nLucky Man has a tendency to drag; fortunately Emerson's almost sardonic play just prevents it from cheap sentimentalism. This kind of tightrope walking is highly fascinating.\n\nSomething similar is true for the vocal parts of Take a Pebble. Lake's voice gives the first example of pseudoromanticism. It is saved by Emerson's play. This time Emerson choses a couple of somewhat stereotypal loops with a lot of notes. He reaches his aim though: crystalclear beauty. McFerrin forgot to mention the first instrumental part. The contrast that the jazzy interplay provides works perfectly. Essentially in those first five minutes ELP strives for beauty from at least three different angles: Lake's vocals, Emerson's piano arrangement and the delicate jazzy piece immediately after the second verse.\n\nOne last remark Usually I don't give a (fill in your favourite abusive word) about ratings. They are subjective anyway and thus far less important than the content of the reviews. But here I notice an inconsistency. McFerrin criticizes this debut album more heavily than In Rock and Machine Head, still rates it with a 10, but not the two Deep Purple albums. Must have to do something with his Moody Blues past, I guess. Never mind, it is quite unimportant.\n\nNo Witty Moniker (11/13/13)\n\nI feel that one must look at an album both as a stand-alone achievement and how it ranks within the context of a bands entire output. As far as first albums go it is exceptional. It has a world-wide hit and their hands-down strongest rocking track. Im not an exceptional Lucky Man fan though I like it. But Knife Edge? Wow. My all-time favorite ELP rocker. I wasnt able to decipher all the lyrics back in the day but now that I know them (by heart, alas) I dont rate the lyrics as meaningless; just very, very dark. And that gets into that whole liberal-conservative philosophy with resulting viewpoints. Liberals see them as meaningless whereas conservatives feel that the images, like 1984 as very possibly prophetic. Greg was even warning us about the incredible things celebrities will say, think & do: Theatre kings of silver wings fly beyond reason. His use of the word talents near the end is a wonderful double-entendre: talents meaning that we are wrapped up in our occupations as opposed to our lives as well as loaded down with a great weight of wealth we will not let go of.\n\nPer Wikipedia:\n\nA Greek, or Attic talent, was 26 kilograms (57 lb), a Roman talent was 32.3 kilograms (71 lb), an Egyptian talent was 27 kilograms (60 lb), and a Babylonian talent was 30.3 kilograms (67 lb). Ancient Israel, and other Levantine countries, adopted the Babylonian talent, but later revised the mass. The heavy common talent, used in New Testament times, was 58.9 kilograms (130 lb).\n\nI also like the way he purposely butchered the word balance by multitracking himself saying the word out of sync 3 (4?) times.\n\nWhen I was younger I wasnt crazy about this album (but alas, all my 8track mix tapes were tossed in the late 80s which would be the only way to tell today which tracks I liked enough to commit to tape). But today I rate it as almost entirely listenable. Tank is a far better drum solo than Moby Dick. But then Carl is the best drummer I ever saw and was able to make a drum solo something to stay for instead of the signal for a run to the bathroom or concession stands. The Three Fates and The Barbarian rate 3 out of 5 but only coz they lack Gregs voice and lyrical touch, the music is great. If you really like Lucky Man there are other versions available though I like Keiths solo on the original as it was one of the few things he did that sounded like something he might do at a party to appease the host as opposed to his usual I got an entire studio at my disposal and I am going to nuke your ears und you vill like it!!\n\nTarkus - 1971 Atlantic\n\nB\n\n(Very Good)\n\nBest song: Tarkus\n\nLook at that cover! That, my friends, is an ARMADILLO TANK. Now, there have been many weird, weird album covers in the history of rock music, but for sheer psycho and bizarre effect, Tarkus has to take the cake. Plus, the theme extends to the pictures on the inner sleeve, which apparently are supposed to illustrate the 'epic story' told by the side-long title track. Basically, this creature is born on the side of a volcano, kills a giant grasshopper with a ... something-shaped head and a large robot pterodactyl, does battle with a metal manticore, and afterwards retreats into the safety of a nearby river....\n\nBut never mind all of the weird imagery and insane story, one that confused Lake so much that he came close to quitting during the album's sessions. What matters is that ELP solidifed their greatness amongst early prog bands by immediately following their best ever album with their best ever song, one that has had a longtime solid hold as my favorite ELP track. And it wouldn't be if it were totally faithful to this story (well, maybe it would, but I'm trying to make a point here). See, although the seven sections of the track have names like Eruption, Manticore, and AquaTarkus (?), the lyrics have almost nothing to do with the 'story.' Rather, the whole piece, when you get down to it, is (as stated in the intro) nothing more than three Lake ballads and pop songs highly augmented by complex and VERY interesting arrangments. Not that the instrumental themes are bad either. For instance, the opening Eruption has a terrific groove, with highly aggressive drum playing and Emerson's amazing keyboards leading the way and setting the tone for the rest of the piece.\n\nFollowing that, we get the very solid Stones of Years, which has yet another great melody, good singing, and of course lots more of Keith. Actually, come to think of it, that's probably what bothers people most about this song. The playing is fantastic, sure, but Emerson was in a highly experimental mode when it came to the various tones he could coax out of his mellotrons and other keyboards. This unfortunately causes many to denounce the piece as dated as anything can possibly be - I mean, these keyboard tones really have no equivalent to anything that had ever come in ANY format of music to that point. But dagnabbit, they're novel, and if you're a dork, they're so freakin' fun to listen to. And speaking of fun to listen to, next comes the instrumental Iconoclast, which it does a great job of creating in your mind the image of a psychotic tank moving through the countryside and blowing things to bits (all of those tight rolling keyboard lines with fast martial drumming actually can create imagery, fancy that). Plus, it's short, so one can never accuse it of becoming boring vis a vis an overstay of welcome.\n\nBut then ... what the heck?? Mass has NOTHING to do with the story, but that's just fine with me. It's too bad that Greg couldn't be in a band with less, um, ambition, since with a less intimidating arrangment it could have at least been a novelty hit. I mean, that melody, regardless of how annoying Keith's synth tones might be at times, is SO CATCHY AND SO MUCH FUN. And besides, I don't want to give the impression that this part is an otherwise great track marred by Keith, because that's not how I feel at all; the insane amount of energy and intensity and energy that goes into the keyboard playing is quite a sight to behold, weird tones or no, and that gives it a license to stick around me as much as it would like. And besides, Lake gets in some really nice guitar licks in the middle (ah, Lake's guitar, the great forgotten ELP asset), so you can choose to listen to those instead.\n\nAfter yet another solid instrumental reprise of Eruption (Manticore), we get piece number three, the majestic Battlefield. The lyrics rule, Lake's voice makes them come to life, and his guitar (dig that weeping solo in the middle, especially when it doubles up!) complements Emerson's organ and piano chords perfectly, which present an enjoyable sort of bizarro dignity to the proceedings (a compliment, of course). Yup, Lake makes the words come to life in that good ole Take a Pebble and Epitaph manner once more, making total nonsense find a way to resonate in a way only he can. And, of course, no symphony (heh, rock-symphony) would be complete without an extended, grandiose finale, and for that we get the synth-fest AquaTarkus. Now, if you want to punch a hole through your stereo while listening to Keith conjure up all of the most annoying synth tones possible (while Palmer plays his military rhythms, heh), I won't blame you in the slightest. I myself once felt that way, but now I wouldn't think of it. Maybe my tastes have just down the drain through the years, I dunno, but it's so funny. Genuinely funny. Besides, it ends eventually, and we close out with another short reprise of Eruption and the huge, important-sounding conclusion. And there you go; seven entertaining and short parts, with a good balance of original themes and timely reprisals, showing all of ELP's good sides and none of the bad (except for the key tones, but that's not so much bad as it is \"just part of ELP.\")\n\nOh, by the way, there's a second side to this album too. And it's good! The opening Jeremy Bender introduces to us a side of the band that we hadn't heard before, the lightweight cabaret-style piano band. I used to not be very fond of it, considering it too lightweight and even bland, but now I don't see much reason for that; the lyrics are amusing, talking about a guy who decides to become a nun, among other things, while the vocal melody and piano lines are perfectly enjoyable during its two minutes, so what else should I ask for? Well, actually, I guess I'd want something that sounds like a Tarkus outtake, like the very next track, Bitches Crystal. Yup, the synth-drum-bass pattern is quite like Eruption, but is also augmented with much more piano than the majority of Tarkus has, and whenever Lake brings out that insane Knife Edge belting, it's just ELP heaven for me.\n\nUnfortunately, we finally crash into a low point of the album with the next two tracks. The seven minute Only Way/Infinite Space suite is quite on the dull side (though Prindle really likes it), and the anti-religion lyrics are absolutely pathetic and childish. In fact, I feel no choice but to subtract a full point from the album for this lame and dreary piece of crud. Sorry, Greg, you should've known better - if you want to put together an anti-religion rant, that's fine, but you'd better avoid such tasteless lines like the one about six million Jews. Give me Aqualung RIGHT NOW... To be fair, though, the Infinite Space part is alright on its own, with some low key discordant piano wanking that's pretty moody, so this part isn't as much a black hole as it could potentially be.\n\nLet us forget the bad things of this world, though, and think of the good. The next track, Time and a Place, RULES. Greg is belting his lyrics like there's no tomorrow, and Keith is playing his synths and organs LOUD and AGGRESSIVE (of course Palmer is great, but that just goes without saying). Like I've inferred before, I like the majestic Lake as much as anybody does, but when the band gets into a Knife Edge mode like this, giving Lake a chance to have screaming moments like \"Show me those that underSTAAAAAAAAAAAND!\" this is when ELP becomes a great band for me. Three minutes of aural bliss.\n\nAnd finally, to remind us that they're not all serious, though, they close out with the absolutely HILARIOUS 50's R&B parody, Are You Ready Eddy?. It's just neat to hear one of the most serious and majestic singers in rock belting \"Bop me Eddy, bop me all night long.\" Or maybe it's just me. \"Sock it to me\"!\n\nA great album this is. An acquired taste, yeah, and a VERY guilty pleasure, but once you can realize just how funny the title track is despite all of its pomp, and how neat these second half tracks mostly are, you should have a blast. Unless, of course, you can't get past all of those weird synths, in which case you should just give up ELP for good.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nMike DeFabio (defab4.earthlink.net)\n\nWow! Somebody out there actually likes Tarkus! I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who love this song, but besides me, I haven't come across one. The thing is that people are simply scared by pretentiousness, which makes no sense. I love bombast, as long as the songs are good (it's the song quality, not the pomposity, of Tales from Topographic Oceans that make it a bad album.) I'm not sure why, but I just have an uncanny affection for songs in danger of sinking under their own weight. I enjoy a speedy punk number as much as anyone, but I just love it when a song jumps out at you in an overly-theatrical manner. This is quite definitely my favorite ELP album after Brain Salad Surgery. I absolutely love all those crazy noises Keith squeezes out of those keyboards. Aquatarkus, for example. I LOVE that synthline. It actually sounds like it's underwater. He even makes typical everyday organs sound bizarre. In Eruption and Iconoclast, the organ sounds less like an organ and more like bones hitting each other. The song parts are good too.\n\nAnd hey! There's a whole nother side! Those songs are pretty good too, INCLUDING Are You Ready Eddy?. It's a perfectly good boogyin' rock song that closes the album in a completely different way than it began. And that's Tarkus.\n\nAnd how bout that cover, huh? Gotta love it!\n\nEcho Albarn (whoneedsthisreality.hotmail.com)\n\n\"Are You Ready, Eddy?\" is an ode to the sound engineer/sometime producer Eddy Offord, who's worked with both Yes and ELP, in addition to some other bands whom I've forgotten just now.\n\nRobert Grazer (xeernoflax.jack-the-ripper.com)\n\nIs that the greatest album cover or what? I mean I love the covers of Atom Heart Mother, Sgt. Pepper, and most Iron Maiden and Yes albums, but Tarkus is my all time favorite. The inner art is also great.\n\nBut there is more than great artwork on this album, we got some good songs too. The \"Only Way\" and \"Infinite Space\" thing is great, containing some great bass by Lake.\n\nBEST TRACK: \"Tarkus\" is, of course, the greatest thing on this album. However my experience with this song differs very little from everyone else's so I will not comment too much on it. It's great.\n\nCOMPLAINTS: This may be the only album that I like that I will end up spending more of the review writing in this section than the others. You see, the problem with Tarkus is that after such a spectacular opener (apart from \"Only Way\" and Infinite Space\") the rest of the album ends up sounding like filler. It might not be, but that is how it sounds. Even though I like a lot of these little songs like \"Jeremy Bender,\" I still get the feeling that ELP was rushing to make the album full length and show the world how great \"Tarkus\" the song is. Think about it, \"Bitches Crystal\" and \"Are You Ready Eddie?\" are really pretty stupid. They aren't terrible, but it is a rather big let down to hear those cheap attempts at songs after such a spectacular side-long. It doesn't ruin the album, but if the entire second side came out as good as \"Only Way\" and \"Infinite Space,\" this could have been an easy 14.\n\nRATING: My Scale: John McFerrin's Scale: 9(12) Maybe a *10(12)*\n\nAwake600.aol.com\n\nI think your review here is pretty much right on the money. \"Tarkus\" is an absolutely great epic, mainly because it merges a few awesome pop songs ('Mass' especially - how could anyone NOT love that one to death??) together with gripping instrumental 'battle' interludes to create an impressive experience that even me, who's not really a great fan of Keith Emerson'"
