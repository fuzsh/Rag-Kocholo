        "text": "One of the ’70s fave band, Emerson, Lake & Palmer – or better abbreviated to ELP – were fan darlings who could do no absolute wrong (until their reviled Love Beach set, anyway). During their early ’70s ascension, they created four classic studio sets (Emerson, Lake & Palmer – 1970, Tarkus – 1971, Trilogy – 1972, Brain Salad Surgery – 1973), and a much-loved live set – Pictures At An Exhibition from 1971. Those were the band’s classic moments. These sets were further appreciated by their second live set – Welcome Back My Friends… (1974). After these came the two Works volumes, and then four more studio sets not including Emerson, Lake & Powell (1986). Needless to say, ELP are one of the essential poster bands for the the ’70s expansion. Unfortunately, Keith Emerson, and Greg Lake are no longer with us leaving Carl Palmer as the surviving member. (Also, Cozy Powell is no longer with us as well.)\n\nOn November 10, BMG will roll out a collection that feature the first five albums as released by ELP in that short span of 1970-1973. Between them, those five represent sales of more than 40 million copies, all Top 10 in the UK, and Top 20 in the US. And while it might appear to be overkill as pertains to the multitudinous issuance of ELP albums, it is a nice collection set for those that like compact box sets.\n\nOriginal Albums – Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP)"
