        "text": "Actually, hats off to producer Mike for his work on this episode in general.\n\nKudos also to producer Mike for correctly referring to “stalactites” when it would have been so easy to make a mistake and refer to them as “stalagmites.” C for ceiling, G for ground!\n\nSo, about Brain Salad Surgery being secretly gross: Take a closer look at that beam of light on the album cover. That’s not actually a beam of light. Also, it turns out that “brain salad surgery” is a euphemism for what’s about to happen there.\n\nJohn makes a brief reference to Emerson stabbing his Hammond organ. While with The Nice, Emerson developed a routine of inflicting physical abuse on his Hammond, which included sticking a knife (given to him by Lemmy!) into it during performance (other parts of this routine included whipping it and pretending to ride it like a horse). Emerson continued this practice into his ELP days.\n\nIt’s not directly pertinent to this episode, but the members of this podcast take great pleasure in the fact that The Nice have a live version of “Rondo” called “Rondo ‘69’” on an album called “Nice.”\n\nJohn incorrectly pronounced “Janacek” as “Jana-sek” when it’s actually much closer to “Jana-tchek.”\n\nJohn also betrayed his Greek heritage by incorrectly pronouncing “Lachesis” with a soft “ch” rather than a hard “ch” in the “Three Fates” discussion.\n\nJohn strongly regrets that he did not think to follow Amanda’s comment that the “Clothos” part of “The Three Fates” is Dracula’s favorite song by immediately saying “Yeah, because it sucks”\n\nDuring recording, the idea occurred to your hosts to have a group sing-along to the ending Moog solo of “Lucky Man.” The idea was much better in theory than in practice and ultimately did not make the final cut for release. Perhaps we can resurrect the idea for the eventual live podcast.\n\nIn his Bartok recommendations, John made two small mistakes regarding the Fritz Reiner recording he mentioned. First, these recordings are from the 1950s (as Mike correctly observed), not from the 1940s. Second, he stated that the album contains a recording of Bartok’s “Hungarian Dances,” when he meant to say “Hungarian Sketches” (the “Hungarian Dances” are a separate set of solo piano works).\n\nOn the topic of Bartok, while we included excerpts from “Sinfonietta” and Bach’s first French Suite, we did not include excerpts of “Allegro Barbaro” or any other Bartok pieces. The Bartok musical estate is notoriously litigious regarding unauthorized use of his material, and we decided to save ourselves a potential headache by simply not including anything (a recorded performance of “Allegro Barbaro” by Bartok himself is available in the links below). If you are looking for excerpts from “Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta,” a good place to find them is in the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name.\n\nWe’ve made TWO playlists to go along with this album! First, we have the official Discord & Rhyme Emerson, Lake & Palmer episode playlist; the other is a prog rock primer for those of you who want to go deeper into the genre."
