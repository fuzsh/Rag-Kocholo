        "text": "Emerson, Lake and Palmer, one of the first supergroups to effectively introduce the synthesizer into rock music; the band debuted at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, disbanded in 1979, and eventually re-united in 1992. Membership: Keith Emerson, kybd. (b. Todmorden, England, Nov. 2, 1944); Greg Lake, bs., gtr., voc. (b. Bournemouth, Dorset, England, Nov. 10, 1948); Carl Palmer, drm. (b. Birmingham, England, March 20, 1947).\n\nOne of the first British rock bands to provide classical music within the rock format during the late 1960s was the Nice. After their debut album, they were perhaps the first rock group to explore the trio format utilizing keyboards rather than electric guitar as the primary musical focus. Disbanding by 1970, the Nice were superseded by Emerson, Lake and Palmer. The group continued the progressive, keyboard-based power-trio format, and became one of the biggest American concert attractions by the mid-1970s. Emerson, Lake and Palmer were one of the first rock bands to tour with a truly quadraphonic sound system (in 1974) and perhaps the first to attempt to tour with a full symphony orchestra (in 1977).\n\nOriginally formed to back soul singer Pat Arnold, the Nice began touring on their own in October 1967. Signed to Andrew Oldham’s Immediate label, the Nice’s debut album featured Emerson’s rousing “Rondo.” With the departure of David O’List (b. Chiswick, London, England, Dec. 13, 1948), the group’s primary singer and songwriter, Emerson became the musical and visual focus of the Nice. His flamboyant stage act, which included stabbing and assaulting his electric organ, brought the group widespread notoriety in Great Britain and Europe. As a keyboard-based power trio—Emerson; Lee Jackson (b. Newcastle upon Tyne, England, Jan. 8, 1943) on bass, guitar, and vocals; and Brian “Blinky” Davison (b. Leicester, England, May 25, 1942) on drums—the group recorded Ars Longa Vita Brevis, which showcased the title composition performed in four movements with coda. By 1970 the group was on the verge of an American breakthrough but elected to disband. Ironically, the Nice soon entered the American album charts with Five Bridges Suite, perhaps their finest work.\n\nIn late 1969 in San Francisco, Keith Emerson, still with the Nice, met guitarist-bassist-vocalist Greg Lake, a founding member of King Crimson. With the demise of the Nice, they formed Emerson, Lake and Palmer with drummer Carl Palmer, a former member of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown (1968’s smash “Fire”) and Atomic Rooster. With Emerson exploring the sound of the synthesizer, the group garnered a reputation for their furious stage act and virtuoso abilities. Their first two albums were best-sellers, with the debut yielding a minor hit, the somber ballad “Lucky Man’ Their third album was an ambitious live recording based on Modest Mussorgsky’s classical composition Pictures at an Exhibition. The follow-up, Trilogy, contained Aaron Copland’s “Hoedown,” Maurice Ravel’s “Bolero,” and the subtle and intricate “In the Beginning,” a moderate hit.\n\nIn 1974 Emerson, Lake and Palmer recorded Brain Salad Surgery for their own Manticore label. To support the album, they completed a spectacular American tour, transporting 36 tons of equipment. Emerson played six Moog synthesizers, two organs, a Steinway, and an electric piano. Each of Palmer’s drums had its own synthesizer, and his equipment included two timpani, two gongs, chimes, and a large church bell. In addition, the tour used the first truly quadraphonic sound system. The live set Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends was issued following the tour.\n\nThe group took a two-year hiatus following the tour, eventually releasing the double-record set Works, Vol. 1, in 1977. Each member used one side for a solo effort, with all three playing together on the final side. The haunting “C’est La Vie,” composed by Lake, became a minor hit from the album. That May the group em-barked on a comeback tour of America with a 57-piece orchestra and six-person vocal choir. The cost proved prohibitive and the orchestra was dismissed after 15 concerts. Late 1978’s Love Beach was greeted hastily and in 1979 Emerson, Lake and Palmer disbanded.\n\nIn the early 1980s Keith Emerson recorded the soundtrack to the movie Nighthawks and Greg Lake recorded solo albums. In spring 1981 Carl Palmer joined in the formation of the supergroup Asia with guitarist Steve Howe (Yes), keyboardist Geoff Downes (Yes), and bassist-vocalist John Wetton (King Crimson). They recorded two best-selling albums, scoring a smash hit with “Heat of the Moment” and major hits with “Only Time Will Tell” and “Don’t Cry.” In 1986 Emerson and Lake recruited drummer Cozy Powell (Jeff Beck Group, Rainbow, Whitesnake) for touring and the album Emerson, Lake and Powell. Palmer left Asia around 1986 and formed 3 with Emerson and Calif, session musician Robert Berry in 1988. Emerson, Lake and Palmer ultimately reunited in 1992 for Black Moon and another round of touring.\n\nDiscography\n\nTHE NICE: The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack (1968); Ars Longa Vita Brevis (1969); The Nice (1969); Five Bridges Suite (1970); Elegy (1971); Keith Emerson with the Nice (1972); Autumn to Spring (1973); Immediate Story, Vol. 1 (1976); Elegy/Five Bridges Suite (highlights; 1987).
