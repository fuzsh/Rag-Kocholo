        "meta_description": "Emerson, Lake & Palmer were, without question, one of the great rock bands of the 1970s. Selling millions of albums across the globe, with all three members winning awards for their dazzling musical ability, ELP were no ordinary group. Their pioneering attitude was adored by their legions of fans, none more so than in the USA, where they toured widely. Despite ELP being the embodiment of the dinosaurs that punk sought to kill. However, just like their peers - Yes, Genesis and Pink Floyd - they survived punk's onslaught, continuing to make albums until the mid-90s and touring right until their final concert, a headlining performance at London's High Voltage Festival in 2010. This book charts their rise, via every track on all nine of their studio albums recorded between 1970 and 1994 including Tarkus, Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery. Key recorded live performances - such as 1971's Pictures at an Exhibition - are also included as well as overviews on all three member's solo projects, With informed insight and information, this is the ultimate guide to the band's music - a must-own companion to Emerson, Lake & Palmer's recorded legacy.",
