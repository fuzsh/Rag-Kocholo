        "text": "Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer is born in Todmorden, Yorkshire, England, where his family has been evacuated during World War II. He grows up in Worthing, Sussex, learning classical piano but later expanding into rock and jazz.\n\nDrummer Carl Palmer is born in Birmingham, England. At age 20, he gets the gig with Greg Lake and Keith Emerson, who choose him over Mitch Mitchell for their band Emerson, Lake & Palmer.More\n\nAt the Fillmore West in San Francisco, Keith Emerson's band The Nice shares a bill with Greg Lake's band, King Crimson. The pair enjoy a jam session before the show and discuss a partnership, which with the addition of Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster, becomes Emerson, Lake and Palmer.\n\nThe Isle of Wight Festival hits its stride on Day 4 (of 5), with performances by Miles Davis, The Doors and The Who. Joni Mitchell's set is interrupted by a hippie named Yogi Joe who has to be removed by security. It also features Emerson, Lake And Palmer in only their second live performance, which is later released as the album Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970.More\n\nAt Plymouth Guildhall in England, Emerson, Lake & Palmer perform for the first time. They play to a far larger audience four days later at the the Isle Of Wight Festival.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer play their adaptation of Mussorgsky's classical piece \"Pictures At An Exhibition\" at Newcastle City Hall in England. The performance is released as a live album later that year.\n\nThe Emerson, Lake & Palmer film Pictures At An Exhibition, taken from a 1970 performance at the Lyceum in London, opens in theaters. The album of the same name is taken from a later performance."
