        "text": "New ELP deluxe editions and vinyl\n\nBMG will kick off an Emerson Lake & Palmer re-issue programme next month, which spotlights ELP’s nine studio albums, as well as their live recordings and compilations.\n\nKeith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer enjoyed massive ‘prog’ success throughout the 1970s and have sold over 40 million albums worldwide. The albums will be reissued across different formats, including CD and newly cut vinyl LPs and HD digital downloads.\n\nThe group’s first three albums, Emerson Lake & Palmer (1970), Tarkus (1971 and Pictures At An Exhibition (1971) are scheduled for re-release first, alongside a new 39-track, three-CD Anthology with material approved by all three band members. The Anthology is presented in special ‘casebound’ book packaging with detailed sleeve notes by Chris Welch, illustrated with rare band photographs.\n\nThe two-CD deluxe of the 1970 debut comprises the original album and the 2012 Steven Wilson stereo mix, with bonus tracks. This is the same as the 2012 reissue without the surround sound DVD. However, according to BMG, the vinyl LP edition is newly cut for the first time from 24 bit/HD 2012 remasters. Similarly, Tarkus mirrors the 2012 deluxe (original and SW remix+bonus tracks) and the vinyl LP version is newly cut from the 2012 remaster, with original gatefold sleeve and artwork faithfully reproduced.\n\nCD 1 (and the LP) of Pictures… is a new remaster from the original master tapes, with bonus tracks. CD 2 has another live performance of the work, recorded at the Lyceum Ballroom, London, on December 9th, 1970, complemented by live performances of ELP favourites The Barbarian, Knife Edge, Rondo and Nut Rocker.\n\nInterestingly, following a ‘special request’ from Greg Lake, the LPs will be presented on 140g vinyl to ensure a superior high quality sound. Apparently, Mr Lake doesn’t buy into the 180g-means-it-must-sound-better school of thought. His reasoning is explained on the LP inner bag!\n\nThese are all released on 29 July 2016. Later in the year BMG will reissue Trilogy (1972), Brain Salad Surgery (1973) and the live album Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends (1974).\n\nEmerson Lake & Palmer 2CD deluxe\n\nDisc: 1\n\n1.
