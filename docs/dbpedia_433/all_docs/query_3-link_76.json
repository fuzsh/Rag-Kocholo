        "text": "I'm guessing Brain Salad Surgery LP was released Dec 7, 1973 in the states based by this info from Billboard:\n\nBillboard Dec 1, 1973: Issue included an ad saying Brain Salad Surgery is \"To Be Released Soon\"\n\nBillboard Dec 8, 1973: Brain Salad Surgery was listed in \"FM Action Picks\"\n\nBillboard Dec 15, 1973: Brain Salad Surgery LP was \"#69 - Top LPs - 1 Week on the charts\" and listed in \"FM Action Picks\" / \"Hits of the World\"\n\nBillboard Dec 22, 1973: Brain Salad Surgery LP was \"#53 - Top LPs - 2 Weeks on the charts\"\n\nAs I recall, US albums were typically released on Fridays back then. [ex, Dec 7, 1973]\n\nSo there ya go! [my 2 cents anyway]\n\nWikipedia is correct and wrong, and Carl Palmer is correct and wrong.\n\nThe U.K. and the U.S. markets weren’t synchronized in late 1973, so both Wikipedia and Palmer are wrong for putting the same release date for both markets, as is Discogs quoted above.\n\nWikipedia is correct for a U.K. release date, and Palmer is correct for a U.S. date.\n\nThe Great Rock Discography by Martin C. Strong, The Complete Rock Family Trees by Pete Frame, Emerson, Lake & Palmer by Forrester, Hanson, and Askew, and Endless Engima by Edward Macan, all four books list December 1973. The first three volumes are by British writers. Only Macan, who arguably is the most knowledgeable of the lot about ELP, is American.\n\nI feel like David facing these formidable Goliaths by declaring Palmer correct for November 19th for the U.S. release. Brain Salad Surgery first appears on my personal weekly album chart at #10 on Friday, November 23, 1973. I had to see an album in the store before it could make my chart. November 19th fell on a Monday that year.\n\nGeorge N.\n\nTo quote myself from June 5th, 2018, \"On November 5th, 1973, OPEC announced a 25% output cut and threatened an additional 5% cut.\" This quote comes from a similar thread about the questionable release date of Eno's Here Come the Warm Jets.\n\nBrian Eno - Here Come the Warm Jets - What was the original release date?\n\nI suspect that Brain Salad Surgery as well as most album releases in the U.K. had problematic releases until the international oil markets stabilized.\n\nIf you check out the Eno thread, my post at #6 covers some of what Slackhurst Broadcasting refers to in post #5 above. And notice the 14th and final post on the Eno thread with the photo taken at Abbey Road.\n\nHere in the States, record companies recycled vinyl and we suffered at the gas pumps.\n\nGeorge N.\n\nI've got Nov. 19, 1973 in the U.K., with a U.S. release of Jan. 4, 1974. Hence, the Billboard ad noted in a post above by deekmon that it was coming soon. The ad was likely referring to the excitement for the U.S. release caused the U.K. import. (The same ad ran in the Nov. 24 issue of Record World and New York's WNEW-FM has the album in their FM Airplay listing in the Dec. 1 issue.)\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer’s ‘Brain Salad Surgery’: A Brainstorm of the Highest Order\n\nUpon further research, my post above is inaccurate with regard to the U.S. release date. The album definitely arrived in the U.S. by early December '73 with the chart debut in the trades dated Dec. 15. My bad.\n\nBy Dec. 29, Record World had the album at #17 after three weeks and at #13 in the Jan. 5, 1974 issue.\n\nBrain Salad Surgery - that tour was one of the most amazing concert spectacles ever!\n\nNobody (including me) is claiming a wiki entry as undisputed fact. But the people that update info on wiki are just like us, nerds doing research that ultimately want the facts to be what are displayed.\n\nWiki entries are things to consider when trying to piece it all together, and need to be part of the equation.\n\nSaying “wiki isn’t a reliable source” is needless is what I’m saying. We all know that it’s not indisputable, but research has gone into the info that is on wiki and it deserves to be taken into consideration when trying to get to the real answer\n\nFWIW, I just saw the Carl Palmer Band last night with their 50 year anniversary of Welcome Back My Friends Show. Highly recommended, very entertaining renditions of classic ELP selections interspersed with the band playing along with footage from the '92 Royal Albert Hall show. Quite the trip down memory lane.\n\nI saw that Dec. '73 show when here in Detroit, hard to believe it's been 50 years. Saw those guys numerous times throughout all the various years, by far the \"Welcome Back\" tour was still my favorite.\n\nI've been thinking about creating a thread about Wikipedia. Maybe I should look to see if one exists. I have created and edited Wiki pages and recently had some of my updates removed, because I didn't provide some sort of documentation - footnote, news article, etc. I wasn't even sure what they were looking for. I decided no more Wikipedia editing for me.\n\nBrain Salad Surgery entered the Billboard LP chart for the week ending Dec. 15 so it could not have been released on Dec. 7 since the survey period for that chart ended several days prior to that date. It was also on the Cashbox and Record World charts the week before. There is a common and incorrect assumption on Wikipedia that a release date is automatically a certain number of days prior to the chart debut date.\n\nThe Catalog of Copyright Entries shows a publication date of 19 Nov 73.\n\nInteresting tid bit. Just guessing here. Probably something to do with how the die cut circle overlayed on Keith's face when folded. The frontal face shot would be consistent with those of Carl and Greg. It's possible wrong artwork was accidentally supplied (assuming the upward shot was originally supplied) and later corrected."
