        "text": "[ Previous | Table of Contents | Next ]\n\nEmerson, Lake, & Palmer (ELP)\n\nKeith Emerson has been a persistent, successful representative of the art rock tradition, combining classical & rock elements. Mostly, his work in this subgenre falls into the 6th approach outlined in the text (using the musical language of rock to create an extended work modeled after a classical form), but they also were adept at the 4th approach (adapting a classical work to rock performance), as evident from the examples provided on the Rock & Classical Elements page of this web site.\n\nEmerson first became known as keyboard player for The Nice (formed in 1967)with Lee Jackson (bass/guitar/vocals), Brian \"Blinky\" Davison (drums), and David O'List (guitar/vocals). O'List departed after the first album, The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack. In addition to setting the stage for ELP, this band provided a link between the musical experimentalism of late-60s psychedelia and art rock.\n\nGreg Lake was a founding member of King Crimson with Robert Fripp (guitar/mellotron), Ian McDonald (keys/sax/flute/vocals), Michael Giles (drums), and Pete Sinfield (lyrics/lights). Lake departed after the bands first album (In the Court of the Crimson King) to form ELP. Interestingly, in 1976, McDonald was one of the founding members of Foreigner, a highly successful commercial mainstream rock band.\n\nInitially, the band was to include Mitch Mitchell, drummer for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but when those plans fell through Emerson & Lake settled on Carl Palmer. The band artfully fused Greg Lake's predominantly acoustic ballads (hit singles) with Emerson's pretentious keyboard excesses and expanded musical forms\n\nThe band's first album (Emerson, Lake, & Palmer, 1970) went gold ... three tracks of the six on this first album were instrumentals (\"The Barbarian,\" \"The Three Fates,\" and \"Tank\").\n\n\"Lucky Man\" hit #48\n\nFM radio airplay of longer tracks\n\nflamboyantly bombastic concerts: incredible light show, Emerson's keyboards whirling around, Palmer's $25,000 percussion setup, light & smoke show, & a rising elevator platform\n\nThe Barbarian\n\nTake a Pebble\n\nThe Three Fates\n\nLucky Man (#48, 1970)\n\n... in fact, each of ELP's first nine albums went gold\n\nTheir second album (Tarkus, 1971) continued the tradition\n\nTarkus\n\nBitches Crystal\n\nAre You Ready Eddy?\n\nTheir third album (1971) was a recording of Emerson's transcription of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (the ultimate example of the 4th approach to combining classical & rock elements)\n\nExcerpts from Pictures At an Exhibition\n\nPromenade\n\nThe Gnome\n\nThe Old Castle\n\nThe Hut of Baba Yaga\n\nThe Great Gates of Kiev\n\nELP's fourth album (Trilogy, #5 in 1972) was their highest placed album contained their only Top 40 hit (\"From the Beginning\") ... their music does not typically lend itself to a 3-minute format; however, other songs (often excerpts of longer recordings) received significant airplay, especially on AOR radio stations\n\nThe Endless Enigma, Part 1\n\nFugue\n\nThe Endless Enigma, Part 2\n\nFrom the Beginning (#39, 1972)\n\nHoedown\n\nbased on the \"Hoedown\" section of Aaron Copland's Rodeo, a ballet\n\nTrilogy\n\nELP's fifth album was Brain Salad Surgery (1973)\n\ncontained the FM staple \"Still ... You Turn Me On\"\n\nJerusalem\n\nToccata\n\nadaptation of the 4th movement from Alberto Ginastera's First Piano Concerto\n\nBenny the Bouncer\n\nStill ... You Turn Me On\n\nBrain Salad Surgery also contained the massive \"Karn Evil 9\" ... 30 minute long composition, consisting of 3 \"Impressions\" (fast-slow-fast), like the movement structure of a classical concerto\n\nthe form is extremely complex but can be followed with some effort (see Musical Close-Up in textbook); you can follow the form using the listeing guides embedded below\n\nKarn Evil 9 - First Impression (pt. 1 & 2)\n\nKarn Evil 9 - Second Impression\n\nKarn Evil 9 - Third Impression\n\nConversation: The Making of Brain Salad Surgery\n\nListening guide for the complete composition:"
