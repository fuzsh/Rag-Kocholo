        "text": "Sort of a musician`s reading material this, but I think even ordinary fans could get some understanding from this first article in a series.\n\nRead on!\n\nThe master of speed and stagecraft\n\nIn the first article of a new series on playing technique, Tony Tyler examines the work of Keith Emerson.\n\nDIFFERENT KEYBOARD players opt for different forms of musical self-expression. Some, like Garth Hudson, of the Band, for severe discipline coupled with a vast knowledge and a good deal of wit. Others, like Rick Wakeman, go for highly-developed orthodox skills coupled with a huge range of different sounds. A third school depends on a mixture of the previous two plus an emphasis on formidable technique.\n\nMention “technique” to a keyboard player and Keith Emerson’s name is among the first to be mentioned — because Emo has developed a technique of rock keyboards more than anyone else.\n\nEven to fellow-organists, there seems no end to his capabilities. They may be chary of his (or ELP’s) music, but will always acknowledge Emerson’s absolute mastery of the various tricks, forms and devices of organ, piano and synthesiser work.\n\nSo how does he do it? First and foremost, Emo’s staggering speed is the product of piano, not organ. Piano has always been his favourite instrument – it’s what he plays when relaxing — and the extra physical finger effort and octave stretch required from a pianist stand him in good stead on the easier, lighter electronic organ manual.\n\nEmerson also has comparitively small hands, and the muscle development called for in piano work has resulted in his compensating for this with a phenomenal stretch; his playing bears all the hallmarks of the harder instrument. Giant block chords, although present in his music, never feature so much as the high-speed flurry of notes, coupled with obscure intervals, that characterise the jazz pianist.\n\nAlso, his earlier (Nice) emphasis on the complicated counterpoint musical structures of baroque composers has given him an astute and instinctive knowledge of the sorts of fast feeders that can safely be adapted to rock music.\n\nThus ELP music, fast and devouring as it is, reflects Emerson’s own musical development: jazz piano as an aim, classical riffs as training, the Nice as background, ELP as final product.\n\nInstrumentally, Emerson favours two Hammonds (an A100 and an ancient and well-battered L 100 for stunting), a grand piano, an electric Hohner clavinet (for “Nutrocker”), a large Moog IC for complicated synthesiser programming and a smaller Mini-Moog for easier synthesiser parameters.\n\nThe large Hammond is kept clean and in perfect order and is used by Keith for most of the incisive organ sounds required. The smaller, more battered L is used for the stunt sequences (the riding, stabbing and straddling all-action Emerson) and for scenic counterpoints.\n\nThus, in “Barbarian” (from the first ELP album), the monster block fudged chords are played by Emo with his left hand on the L 100, while the single-line material is confined to the clearer A, with its superior Hammond generator and greater keyboards-length.\n\nThe hooked-in Moog 1C keyboard is mounted, along with Keith’s ribbon controller, atop the A 100, while the Mini is played from the grand.\n\nELP make much use of the visual aspect. So Keith uses two Hammonds for three reasons. One, earlier stated, for diverse Hammond tonalities at the same time; two, so that the stunting and organ-damaging stagework can be confined to the smaller, older, lighter instrument, and three, because it makes for good visual effect.\n\nThe famous dagger sequence, too, has its point. Keith doesn’t stab the L 100 to be nasty — he does so because a knife (or comb, but combs aren’t so visual) jammed between two selected keys holds both in a “down” position, providing a semitone drone.\n\nWhen the organ is rocked, the L generator fluctuates in voltage, causing this continuous drone to waver. This produces the wailing that sounds so manic at the end of “Rondo”.\n\nNeedless to say, the ELP roadies are adept at changing keys on Hammonds, and a good supply is always carried on tour.\n\nThe famous battered Leslie that is the target for Keith’s knife-throwing tactics is referred to, among the stage crew, as the “dartboard”. It is, in fact, virtually useless for sound-producing purposes and, though hooked up to the bank of Leslies, is kept purely for theatrics.\n\nIf Keith has a fault in his playing and execution it is the common and understandable one of tending to race a little. But, face it, at the utterly phenomenal speed he plays, it would take a genius to avoid that particular hurdle. This minor fault has been worked on recently and is now hardly present.\n\nHe has also been accused of extravagance with notes — and, in truth, he hardly ever plays one note when eight will do. A fault? Perhaps, but ELP’s speedy music wouldn’t be the same without this style.\n\nAs regards the synthesiser, enough has already been written about Keith’s prowess on this most misunderstood of instruments to fill several NMEs. Let’s just say that the possibilities have hardly been explored by anyone.\n\nHere, again, Emerson is an innovator — and here, again, he has devoted much thought and much technique to exploring the possibilities. To assess how successful he has been would take as much space again as this piece has taken.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nThis was a very good interview with Mr. Greg Lake. This one should be of note to people with only a modicum of interest in ELP. Mr. Johnson did a really good job with this one.\n\nRead on!\n\nLake the strongman\n\nThe bass-player businessman of ELP, on how to rock without getting ripped off…\n\nBy James Johnson\n\nGREG LAKE COULD almost be mistaken for a sleek and successful young business man as he sits in the newly-converted offices of Manticore Records. He appears urbane and stylish, differing greatly from some of his more shambling contemporaries in the rock hierarchy.\n\nIn many ways he is the strongest, most resolute personality in ELP since Keith Emerson is a shy, retiring sort of individual and Carl Palmer, at 22, still relatively young in the rock superstar stakes.\n\nIn the past this has meant Lake has been left with much of the responsibility for running the band day to day, something he says he could have done without and which eventually led to the creation of Manticore.\n\nThis is, of course, an ELP venture. It has now grown into a record company in its own right but was originally set up to protect the band’s interests and allow them to concentrate on the more creative areas unhindered by the hassles of contracts, tax and general economics. It’s a shrewd move, but based on sensible rather than avaricious motives.\n\nDespite this, Lake still admits one has to be something of a businessman these days to be a successful rock musician, although there’s almost a contradiction in terms — between the hustler and the artist, the schemer and the dreamer.\n\nHe explains: “I know a lot of rock musicians who are getting a really bad deal financially and in terms of their careers. Sadly, if you don’t look after your interests nobody else will.\n\n“Now I see less and less of the business side of it because it’s all being taken care of.”\n\nIn fact Lake comes over as a cooly amiable character who can now find time to indulge what amounts to his obsession with ELP. Something he says concerns him one hundred per cent of the time.\n\nAnd at present there’s more than usual to think about. Shortly the band embark on a world tour, described as the “biggest production spectacular ever mobilised”, which will involve them playing inside a specially-constructed arch — a proscenium — complete with stage and curtains. The proscenium will be transported to every gig.\n\n“The real beauty of it for us,” says Lake, “is that every night we’re playing in the same box. Only the people in front will change.\n\n“Also from the point of view of a production it’s far more flexible. We can use the lights in the same position every night; we don’t have to draw the curtains until we’re exactly ready; altogether we can feel at home wherever we’re playing.”\n\nSince ELP have always been concerned in presenting a spectacle this “portable ambience”, as the band’s publicist describes it, was the next logical step. As Lake points out: “It’ll help us and the audience reach higher peaks, which is basically what music is all about. We can got the audience to a greater level of excitement or bring them down for a more moody or tranquil thing. It’ll help us stretch the extremes.”\n\nThe disadvantages of the structure are, of course, blatantly obvious. It weighs 20 tons and takes 50 guys to move it. But Lake shrugs this off with “it’s not my problem” and obviously he and the band are prepared to overcome any obstacle, or pay people to overcome obstacles for them, simply to extend the effect of their concerts further.\n\nLake has never doubted that this path is worth pursuing. As much as ever he is still into presenting a show as a spectacle.\n\n“I’m as sure as hell about it,” he states squarely, “because it adds something you can never get on a record. That special feeling of spontaneous elation you should ideally be able to get every night.\n\n“Some people can do it almost every night — like James Brown — because he’s spent years trying to achieve it. Maybe musically he’s not doing anything that great, yet he can completely capture an audience.\n\n“Also as ELP we have a lot of old numbers and songs that people expect to hear, and it’s great to perform those old numbers with new visual trips — to perform those numbers with new things to heighten the effect.\n\n“Like we’re not into a sort of Joshua light show number with massive screens with pictures of President Nixon coming up or something. The only effects we plan to use are something to introduce the show and something during some of the numbers.\n\n“But if a song’s about water and you can lay a waterfall on people that’s nice, isn’t it? It`s a wonderful thing because it makes it all a bit more dreamlike, which to me is why people go to concerts anyway — to get away from things — to escape for a while.” Apart from the band’s proscenium making its debut appearance on the tour, ELP will also feature new material at present lined-up for a new album. In fact the album has yet to be worked on, and nothing has been recorded. But the material they’ve written so far is, according to Lake, less rigid in its complexity and even, he suggests, closer to the fundamentals of rock and roll. Speaking slowly to convey his exact meaning he explains: “It’s not a `getting back to the roots’ type trip. It’s no more simple than before. It just has a different theme, and that theme happens to be rock and roll. If you can imagine ELP playing rock and roll soul music — gospel even — then it’s that kind of trip.\n\n“It’s like a big band playing rock material — a fairly meaty thing…” he pauses and smiles to indicate it still won’t exactly be the Jerry Lee Lewis Songbook… “I think maybe our idea of rock and roll is different from anybody else’s… I don’t know. But it still has ELP’s stamp of aggression or authority if you like. There’s still a terrible punch to it, but more feel perhaps. It’s not so much of a bar of seven and count as you go…”\n\nThis news might re-awaken interest in the band from some of their sterner critics, who have described them as “soulless” in the past. Lake, in many ways, can see how this criticism arose but naturally feels it unjustified.\n\n“To me there’s soul in everything we’ve ever played. I just think it’s a little harder to recognise because of it’s complexity sometimes. I’m sure you can get lost in some of our music, especially on first hearing. I doubt if you can pick up on the soul first time through but it’s there all the same.\n\n“I’d agree it’s not a pull-your-heart-out soul. It’s not a spade soul or a Slade-type soul — things that are tuneful or instantly full of feeling. It’s more in aggression, or taking things to a pitch of intensity and excitement.\n\nHe continues: “In a way it’s fairly spontaneous, like the way Keith plays his solos, most of which are not worked out. Like in the studio he’s played when he’s not known I’ve been recording him, and some of his finest things — things that have appeared on albums — have come out that way. And to me they’ve got a raw human feel — soul if you like.”\n\nSince Lake is willing to admit that in comparison with most bands ELP’s music is quite complex, how does he feel about bands who almost make a virtue out of simplicity?\n\n“Really it depends on the motive,” he replies. “Because whether a thing is simple has nothing to do with whether it’s good or bad. Yet I think some things are obviously done to hook people — some things are very sick, and the artists are almost put out like street walkers…”\n\nHe pauses a second: “Perhaps that’s not quite right, because I like simple music by bands like Slade. That’s just good and people enjoy it.\n\n“But “But I do see a certain negativity, a certain sickness in acts like the Osmonds because I know exactly what that act is designed for. I mean, if you look at it there’s a bunch of men deliberately scaled down in age” – Lake makes a slow downward motion with his arm — “so that the band can cover every age group imaginable. That to me is unhealthy.\n\n“There’s this little kid Jimmy Osmond who doesn’t know why he’s up there, but I do. I know what goes on behind things like that.”\n\nLake returns to the theme of musical simplicity: “Personally I don’t care if a cat’s really bad so long as he wants to give something of himself. Then, as far as I’m concerned; he’s good. People who write songs and they want people to hear them and understand them – those guys can’t be bad, and shouldn’t necessarily be thought so. I remember when I first heard Dylan, I said “the guy can’t sing” — famous last words.”\n\nLooked at aside from his role in ELP, Greg Lake is of course an outstanding musician in his own right. He is obviously capable of expressing himself in many ways other than through ELP but it seems his loyalty is totally comitted to the band.\n\n“There are two ways of expressing yourself as a musician,” he explains. “One is to go for what you want and the other is to become the music of a group of people. If you do it on your own you won’t get the fusion or the flash that you can get out of a band, but you can have your own way the whole time. To me it seems if I play with two other people I have to compromise, but in the long run, between us, well come up with more good music.\n\n“Also we’re very fortunate because in the band we all always listen to each other’s ideas, so none of us gets inhibited in bringing something up. You know the others will listen, so you can play it with all your heart and conviction.\n\n“I’m sure there are sides to me in fact that don’t come out within the band but I can’t consciously think what they are.”\n\nCould it be something like “From The Beginning” on “Trilogy”, basically a simple, sensitive little song that Lake performs solo?\n\n“That’s maybe the kind of thing I’d like to do on my own. And we all have little moments of self-indulgence on albums. You have to limit it to a certain extent, though, and keep within the basic framework of the band — otherwise everybody goes off on tangents and the album becomes an awful mess.\n\n“Perhaps if there’s one thing I’d like to do which I can’t do now it’s conventional ballads, if you know what I mean — like some of the Joni Mitchell things, or have you heard the ‘Wild Flowers’ album by Judy Collins? Now that’s really something.\n\n“I think one day I’d like to get into writing ‘song’ songs rather than contemporary music songs. Maybe I’ll make a catastrophic solo album one day.” He grins. “But I can’t see it happening at present.”\n\nSo, finally, what are his ambitions for himself and the band?\n\n“It may sound corny but the only ambition I have, and I’m sure it’s shared by the rest of the band, is to extend as far as possible people’s emotions through music, care and production. You can stretch them as far as your skill will allow and that’s basically all there is to aim for. I’m not really into anything else, and I devote my life to it. If I wasn’t doing it with this band then it’d be with somebody else.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nAfter reading this insightful interview with Mr. Emerson there should be no doubt in anyone`s mind that he really lived and breathed music. You can understand that life became hard for him when he in his later years developed a nerve damage that made it hard for him to play. Unfortunately, I suspect that this was a huge reason for him ending his life. Without music, I guess, sadly, he didn`t feel complete. May he rest in peace.\n\nRead on!\n\nI want to look back in a year`s time and be pleased with my progress\n\nKeith Emerson – the Man and his Music\n\nBy Richard Green\n\nKEITH EMERSON could well have been the original model for the weakling who was always getting sand kicked in his face in those Charles Atlas ads — his physique couldn’t exactly be described as robust and most of the time he seems unaware of what is going on around him. But if someone did kick sand at him he probably wouldn’t notice, the reason being that his appearance of vagueness is closely connected with his musical brain.\n\nWhen Keith sits in a crowded room saying nothing amid all sorts of conversations it’s a fair bet that in his head he is arranging a piece of music, laying the bones for a new composition or pondering a new theme.\n\nIt’s always been that way with him. He got kicked out of college for playing the piano during free study periods and was only reinstated when he promised it wouldn’t happen again.\n\n“I used to sneak off to the common room and play the piano while a friend played banjo,” he recalled with a grin. “The headmaster got to hear of it and wasn’t at all happy. In the end, I had to apologise and go back to my studies.”\n\nKeith has been hailed as a musical genius, some people putting him way ahead of his twenty-six years. He has been “into” music since he was a wee child and has very strong views on the subject of music teachers.\n\n“You can’t be taught to play music, you have to be born to play it,” he insists. “Ever since the age of two I was going round the house making songs up.\n\n“There was a piano in the house and I learned to play by ear. My father was musical and that’s where it came from. I didn’t read music so later I taught myself to.\n\n“Music schools are good, but they have rules in music and you can’t have rules in music. When the Nice played with the Los Angeles Philharmonic I put to Zubin Maher, the conductor, that the art of improvisation in today’s orchestras is lost and he agreed.\n\n“I said wasn’t it a pity that composers like Bach and so on based a lot of their writing on improvisation and modern orchestras didn’t take advantage of the opportunity to improvise.\n\n“When you’re taught you have to play what the composer wrote. You’re not allowed to improvise whereas in a lot of cases the composer wrote improvisationally. Worked-out solos are okay, but there’s always that spark of surprise when you do something spontaneous, you can’t recreate that.”\n\nKeith had arrived late for our interview but he had one of the most original excuses I’ve heard yet. He’d crashed his bike into a taxi! As proof of this incident in Kensington High Street, he pointed to a plaster over his eye and went into detail about the accident.\n\nAs a remedy he prescribed doses of nine-year-old Irish whiskey, cups of tea and a golden substance from Acapulco all of which, when taken together, has a nice relaxing effect. No doubt he needed it.\n\nSix groups\n\nWe picked up Keith’s chequered career again at the age of fifteen when he was playing the circuits, round the South Coast.\n\n“I was playing with six different groups,” he pointed out. “There was a simple trio of piano, bass and drums; a fairly large orchestra playing Duke Ellington arrangements; an r-and-b band; a rock group playing things like Roy Orbison’s `Pretty Woman,’ and a classical quartet.\n\n“Every other night I’d be doing one of those and I dug the variety, it helped to broaden my experience. One night in Brighton I pulled out a bit of Bach and arranged it for the others… that was before I’d heard Jacques Loussier.”\n\nDuring his two years working in a bank, Keith would more often than not go into work in the morning very bleary-eyed and another ultimatum was delivered, this time by the bank manager.\n\nKeith had the choice of leaving or concentrating a bit more. Surprisingly, he chose to stay but he paid more attention to the music papers and finally was asked to resign, which is a polite way of being booted out.\n\nHe had a group called John Brown’s Body based in Brighton then, through his friend Gary Farr, joined the T-Bones still playing the South Coast area with frequent visits to the Marquee.\n\nAfter a musically stimulating but financially disastrous period with the VIPs he became part of P.P. Arnold’s backing group along with Lee Jackson, Dave O’List and Ian Haigh.\n\nThough he didn’t know it at the time, working with that group was to lead to the somewhat revolutionary career of the Nice. They left P.P. and Brian Davison replaced Ian Haig, then Dave O’List left, the trio continuing on its own playing things like “Billy’s Bag.”\n\n“In the first days of the Nice I started to write things on my own,” Keith told me. “We were persuaded to do this by the record company and at first I didn’t really think I had the ability to write things that other people would dig.\n\n“I couldn’t write for Joe Normal, songs that he would go round whistling in the street. I had the ability to write the things but there’s something in me that rejects that kind of number.\n\n“I realise now that in the last days of the Nice I was writing very complicated things, I can see now how hard they were to play and why Lee had the horrors.”\n\nA lot of the Nice’s work was based on various classical compositions and their various experiments conducted with other forms of music.\n\n“Working with the Nice we had the financial aspects of experimentation with music. Some things worked, some things didn’t. That time we used bagpipes at Plumpton didn’t really work but I learned a lot about Scottish music. It’s interesting to see the familiarity between Scottish and Indian music, they’re both built up on drones.”\n\nThere’s no doubt about the impact the Nice made on modern music but when I asked Keith how he evaluated the group’s worth he went silent for several minutes, staring non-seeing at the window looking out onto the vast Olympia halls.\n\nWhen he finally collected his thoughts, he replied: “The Nice obviously made a big contribution for the number of audiences they used to accumulate. I like to be sort of modest, I don’t like to talk about past successes really.\n\n“The Nice probably helped people to open their minds to other forms of music, it probably helped to develop their ears to accept more harmonies. Audiences today are becoming much more aware, very interested in sound and things like that. Ten years ago, every tune had to have some melody, some tune to sing.”\n\nKeith’s output is prolific and, like most other composers of note, he finds himself writing in a mixed variety of settings and circumstances.\n\n“Inspiration comes at times,” he commented. “I can remember writing the Five Bridges Suite. We were coming back from Ireland by Aer Lingus and the engines were droning and all of a sudden all these melodies were coming to me across these drones.\n\nIn the bath\n\n“So I got out the airsick bag, drew five lines across it, put a treble clef at the front and that was the beginning of the Five Bridges Suite.\n\n“I had the whole suite down in a week, I worked incredibly fast. It got so bad that I’d go to bed and still have the dots in my head. I was writing in the bath, on a bus, at a bar, sitting on the toilet, eating. Otherwise, I’m completely lazy, it takes me ages to drag myself to the piano. At other times you sit down and you play for hours… you have to sit down and tell yourself to cool it.\n\n“My favourite album is the Five Bridges. There’s nothing I’ve really done that I’ve disliked. I’m particularly pleased with the Fugue in Five Bridges, maybe because I wrote it in such a funny way. It had a lot of contrapunt, or contrapuntal melodies. I wrote one line first, then the other line and then the harmony voices. And when it was in manuscript form I had to sit down and learn to play it!\n\n“I’m a great believer in fate. I shall always be a musician, always. Playing music is my ideal release. As Jimi Hendrix once said `It’s more of a release than sex can give you sometimes.’ It’s very noticeable when you haven’t been playing for a week and you get very screwed up and start smashing things — you need to do it.\n\n“At Liverpool we hadn’t played for three weeks and we were really itching to get on there and just blow. When we did, a lot of things came off the top of our heads, things that we wouldn’t have thought of playing normally.”\n\nBecause of his music, Keith has become very much more experienced in everyday things and now had a broader outlook on life in general. Certainly he is more aware of things than on the famous occasion when the Nice visited Prague shortly after the Russian invasion.\n\nThe story as often related with much glee by various road managers and which I’m sure Keith won’t mind my repeating in print is yet another example of how his mind tends to be on music all the time.\n\nIt seems that after getting off the plane to be met by a delegation from the cultural department or some such body, Keith saw all the tanks with red stars on the side and innocently asked: “Are we in Russia?”\n\n“Music has broadened my outlook,” Keith mused. “The whole point of travelling broadens people’s minds and you do a hell of a lot of travelling in a band.\n\n“You’re brought into contact with all sorts of people in all forms of life. You have to experience a certain amount of hardship. A lot of the musicians I know have been through a lot of hard times — no bread and all that.\n\n“This is the whole purpose of living, it’s no good to have it on your plate all the time.”\n\nWhen I asked him if he had any set musical policy now, any definite direction, he thought for a while, then went over to the record player and put on part of the Ginastera Concerto for piano and orchestra. That, Keith stated, was the kind of music he would dearly like to play.\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article. With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nHere`s another fine article with this band from their early days. They had a lot they wanted to prove!\n\nRead on!\n\nKnocking knockers!\n\nBy Richard Green\n\nBE THOU not so swift to judge. A maxim that could well apply to many people — myself included — when Keith Emerson broke up the Nice by leaving to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Quite apart from the cries of woe that went up from the legions of Nice fans, a lot of us were quick to condemn Keith as some Fellini-type Svengali.\n\nTime has come to prove that out of what could well have become an unnecessary evil — the orchestras, the constant meddling with classics et al, all of which attracted a certain amount of criticism from people “in the know” — that what at first seems a bad thing can yield a good harvest.\n\nELP, Every Which Way and Jackson Heights are the children of the Nice and each offspring has procreated an original musical sound. Or have they? Criticism has been levelled against ELP, based in the main on Emmo’s occasional use of Nice techniques and even the “unthinkahle” use in the trios act of “Rondo”, very much a “Nice” possession.\n\nAt the Isle of Wight this year I was disappointed with what ELP did. Maybe this had something to do with the showmanship of the use of cannons and the calls from the crowd for familiar Nice numbers. Had we been expecting a re-birth of the Nice?\n\nAltered\n\nMore recently at the group’s Royal Festival Hall concert, my opinion shifted by a good many degrees and I was able to appreciate the musical direction and undoubted combined talent of the three members. Although the packed crowd responded fanatically to the music, certain critics took it upon themselves to knock.\n\nWishing to hear the group’s explanation of their performances and direction, I spoke to Greg and Carl and later to Keith. Greg, Carl and I spent a pleasant hour or so esconsed in their publicist’s extremely comfortable and expensive flat overlooking Hyde Park.\n\n“The trouble is that one third of this band is Keith and he was more than one third of the Nice.” Greg began. “We’ve had to avoid making the music difficult without being pretentious. A lot of people are offended that we had a name when the band started, but we’ve all worked hard for ten years.\n\n“We were very disappointed that the critics took the festival gig the way they did because I thought the kids enjoyed it and that we got slagged off the way we did.\n\n“I don’t think we deserved it, a lot of it was poor quality criticism. When you spend five months sweating blood forming a new band, it hurts.”\n\nAs regards the inclusion of “Rondo” in the repertoire, Greg points out: “I’ve always liked ‘Rondo’ and I wouldn’t play it if I didn’t want to, People all over Europe wanted to hear it and, let’s face it, you’re in the business to please people and if they want to hear Keith play it and I want to hear it.\n\nOnly a song\n\n“It’s only a song. Joe Cocker does a lot of Beatles songs but they don’t knock him. We knew we’d cop it for doing it and we’d suffer, but if Keith never did it again that would be one of the greatest losses of the last ten years.”\n\nHe sipped his drink and went on: “This is just the birth of the group and we want to get it together so that it will last for a long time. We don’t want any personality clashes. We’ve started to find a direction as a band and we’ve got to put an electric guitar in the band. There’s a pause in the act that has to be filled.”\n\nCarl, who until now had been sitting quietly on the other side of the lounge listening to all Greg had to say, obviously feels more about the Nice-ELP comparisons than the other two.\n\nSuddenly, he commented: “The Nice could never have played what we are playing now. Brian couldn’t play what we’re playing now and Lee couldn’t play what Greg plays.\n\n“We carried on where the Nice left off. What they were in to was correct and we’re not trying to cash in, we’re a new band.”\n\nThis prompted Greg to state: “It would be hypocritical of Keith if he didn’t jump over the organ because he loves it. I would be very put out if he didn’t do it.”\n\nStill obviously feeling uptight about recent criticism, Carl told me: “We haven’t had recognition for what we’re doing. I can’t give you all those months of rehearsals that we’ve been through.”\n\nKeith, Greg and Carl consider it very important that ELP is recognised as a group and Greg insisted: “The first step is for us to establish ELP as a group and then we’ll be more comfortable. The album will establish the group.”\n\nCarl pointed out: “Keith has learned to develop as a player with other people. If I lay down a riff, he’ll pick it up. He picks it up, he doesn’t have to lay down something for others to follow all the time.”\n\nLike the other half of a double act, for that was the way in which the conversation had developed by now, Greg came in with: “In the end, Keith had to be self-indulgent because he was doing all the leading of the Nice.”\n\nCarl is at least pleased that the group’s tour has proved they can fill twenty concert halls and he now looks forward to reading the reviews of the album. Like the others, he pins a lot of hopes on the reaction to the LP.\n\nKeith’s view\n\nWithout telling him what Greg and Carl had said, I went round to see Keith just before he flew off for a holiday in Denmark. As it happened, his views coincide exactly with those of the others.\n\nOne of ELP’s main numbers is a free adaptation of Mazursky’s “Pictures At An Exhibition” and it was this piece that Keith used as an illustration for his basic argument.\n\n“When `Pictures At An Exhibition’ was first put down on a manuscript, in about 1850 I think it was, some of the harmonies were thought to be too daring by certain sections of people and a lot of them were changed to avoid criticism.\n\n“We don’t do this. Everything we play we mean and we’re not afraid of the criticism we receive. At the Festival Hall, a few critics decided to centre their attention on one area of the band — unfortunately they got only one third of the total sound effect.\n\n“With the arrival of the album, the talents of Greg and Carl will become more apparent and they will get the recognition they deserve. ELP is both three individuals and a group and though it will be some time before the band is recognised as the latter, ELP has all the time in the world.”\n\nIt is obvious that ELP has a good case and, while they consider reaction to the album to be all-important, it would also appear to be time for certain people to re-appraise the group in the light of the members’ comments. Comments which are valid and well-conceived.\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article.
