        "text": "In the early 1970’s, British progressive rock was in its heyday. Most noted were Yes and Pink Floyd, but a third band at the time, Emerson, Lake and Palmer (ELP) was just as influential and left an indelible mark. First formed in 1970, the gifted trio wrote creative interpretations to Classical music to suit rock and roll sensibilities. Their traditional rock songs are as impressive as well. Over the years ELP sold over 40 million albums and played to packed arenas around the world.\n\nAll three musicians are highly accomplished. Keith Emerson on the Hammond, piano and synthesizer had classical training that served him well; he is a powerful performer and quite gifted on the keyboards. Greg Lake, the guitarist and bassist, wrote many of the bands more commercial songs; he has a fine voice and is an excellent songwriter. Carl Palmer is a drummer in the class of Bonham and Moon and is not only a brilliant percussionist playing at breakneck speed, but is a talented songwriter as well.\n\nELP’s earlier albums contained several classical music compositions done the ELP way. Most noted are: Aaron Copland’s Fanfare for the Common Man and Petrovich Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition. By ELP’s 4th album, Brain Salad Surgery (1973), ELP had written an original composition that is an exquisite tour de force. It contains their major opus “Karn Evil 9 (KE9)” which is essentially a 30 minute (3) part concerto. Adding to the texture of the composition, ELP suffused the music as part of the story line. It’s a remarkable feat – the story, in musical form and lyrics, comes at you simultaneously.\n\nAs for the origins of the title, Karn Evil is a bastardization of the word “Carnival”… which is an apt description.\n\n“First Impression Part 1” starts with the world’s beginning on a “Cold and misty morning…” and tells of a futuristic world from which “all manner of evil and decadence had been banished.” The opening is terrific with Emerson on the Hammond B3 and Palmer pushing off with maximum energy. From the get go…it’s quite a musical ride. The intricate drums, Hammond, synthesizer and strings are extremely tight and multi-layered. Marvel at Emerson’s abilities to drive the pace with virtuoso musicianship. It is structured like any classical concerto where certain themes repeat themselves with different interpretations.\n\n“First Impression Part 2” (because of space on the vinyl, the “First Impression” is split in 2 parts – the end of side 1 and the start of side 2) contains ELP’s most famous line: “Welcome Back My Friends to the Show that Never Ends,” and then, “There Behind the Glass is a Real Blade of Glass.” It is quite prophetic as they tell the tale of a world heading into deconstruction with computers trying to taking over. The instrumental is astonishing as it pulses energetically to simulate a world gone mad… one of several musical metaphors in “KE9”. Check out Carl Palmer’s incredible drum solo as Greg Lake provides the vocals.\n\nThe “Second Impression,” which is an instrumental, starts with a wonderful piano solo, as Lake and Palmer enter the composition there is a Caribbean feel with steel drums added. Actually the steel drums are created by Emerson deft work on the Moog Synthesizer. In the 2nd part, things slowdown in Classical tradition (the 2nd movement of Concertos are always “Andante”). The 3rd part of the second impression is essentially classical music meeting progressive jazz with tight turns in syncopated precision. Stunning!\n\nIn the “Third Impression,” computers and humans go to war for control of the world. Lake’s soaring vocals start things off. A 2nd voice comes next that is synthesized lyrics that can only be described as a singing computer. Human vs Computer lyrics engage in a harmonic battle. It’s a stark and provocative element and another musical metaphor. Meanwhile Emerson’s organ drives inexorably to the coda as things eventually deconstruct to a series of abrupt computer sounds. You sense the end is near as the synthesized computer takes control. It increases in tempo but with a thinner sound and then…it ends abruptly. The meaning of “KE9’s” ending has been debated for years. Do the computers or humans win? Or is it mutual destruction? My interpretation is the computers win in the end and all is silent – which is how computers generally work…in stark silence.\n\nThere are other gems on Brain Salad Surgery. Check out “Benny the Bouncer,” with Palmer on the vocals. It’s the story of a violent bar bouncer who bloodies up the competition in an epic fight at the saloon (and sung to the people’s delight). Delivered in Palmer’s best Cockney accent the song is lively and great fun. Palmer shows great acumen with the brushes. “Jerusalem” and “Still… You Turn Me On” showcase Lake’s mastery as a songwriter and vocalist. Both are very good songs.\n\nBrain Salad Surgery is a masterpiece. It is a showcase for extraordinary and talented musicians. The result will leave you breathless with its originality and powerful message. ELP’s ability to make the music part of the storyline is a phenomenal achievement. As we humans immerse ourselves in our iPads, mobile devices and notebooks, it appears the ridiculous has become the sublime. Computers have already taken over our world; a lot of us just don’t know it yet."
