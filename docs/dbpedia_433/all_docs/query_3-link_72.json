The First Five: Picture Disc Collection brings the band’s first five studio albums together in one special vinyl package and is limited to 1250 units with each set individually numbered.\n\nThe box set contains the band’s most popular albums: Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Tarkus, Picture At An Exhibition, Trilogy, and Brain Salad Surgery. Purchase The First Five: Picture Disc Collection on April 20th at official Record Store Day exclusively at participating stores in the U.S. and Canada. List HERE: http://www.recordstoreday.com/Venues.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer’s album artwork has always been a talking point among fans. This art is featured on the front and back of the pictures disc, including the most famous cover, Brain Salad Surgery, by artists H.R. Giger.\n\nFans can also purchase Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Tarkus deluxe editions and exclusive t-shirt designs at http://elp.merchnow.com/. These items are perfect for any ELP collector.\n\nConsidered by many to be one of rock’s original first super-groups, Emerson Lake & Palmer formed in England in 1970 consisting of Keith Emerson (keyboards), Greg Lake (bass guitar, vocals, guitar) and Carl Palmer (drums, percussion). The band created a brand new world of music, combining classical and symphonic rock fused with beautiful vocals. Their penchant for appropriating themes from classical music and the group’s more nuanced, textured approach to symphonic arrangements set ELP apart from their more bombastic guitar-based contemporaries of the time. This subtler and more sublime approach carries on today in the expansive atmospherics of Radiohead and Muse and also in the prog-influenced sphere of band’s like Porcupine Tree, Dream Theatre, Opeth and many others, making ELP one of the more relevant torchbearers of the progressive rock sound. Along with Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, and Rush, Emerson Lake and Palmer ushered in the Prog era and as one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1970’s having sold over 40 million albums. ELP’s dramatic flair, sincere passion, labyrinthine song structures, and symphony-worthy virtuosity proved that classical rockers could compete for arena-scale audiences as the band headlined stadium tours around the world.\n\nLINKS:\n\nwww.emersonlakepalmer.com\n\nhttp://elp.merchnow.com\n\nRelated"
