        "text": "The quality of UK Progressive bands increased by a thousandfold when the era of Emerson, Lake & Palmer began. Formed in 1970, it was comprised of Keith Emerson, who moved into ELP from The Nice, Greg Lake, who had finished his stint with King Crimson, and Carl Palmer, fresh from his role in Atomic Rooster. ELP took the world by storm with their debut album, releasing “Lucky Man” as the catalyst. In a maniacally short span of just four years, ELP released four best-selling albums, not including their two best-selling live sets within the same time span. They went on hiatus before returning to attempt to recapture ground.\n\nBy 1986, ELP tried again without the help of Carl Palmer as he was busy with Asia. Instead, Cozy Powell from Rainbow was recruited and Emerson, Lake & Powell was issued. The album did fairly well in the UK while the rest of the world was deeply enmeshed with New Wave. This band incarnation only released one album.\n\nOn April 12, Spirit of Unicorn Music, which is an ELP-centric label that specializes in a small collection of ELP-related music (Cherry Red UK) will revisit the ambitious album that signaled a return to the original style of ELP. Know as Emerson, Lake & Powell, the album took the band back and placed them back into the starting gate of a familiar track. This new box will provide a remastered version of the album, and mix in B-sides and a single edit as bonus tracks. Along with those, two extra CDs will contain a CD of rehearsal tracks called The Sprocket Sessions (earlier released as a bootleg), and a CD with the previously released Live In Concert, also remastered. A full booklet of notes, photos, and credits is packed in the box. The 3CD box is being called The Complete Collection and will provide a thorough look into that band and their works.\n\nThe Complete Collection – Emerson, Lake & Powell\n\nCD1 (Emerson Lake And Powell – Remastered)\n\n01 The Score\n\n02 Learning To Fly\n\n03 The Miracle\n\n04 Touch And Go\n\n05 Love Blind\n\n06 Step Aside\n\n07 Lay Down Your Guns\n\n08 Mars, The Bringer of War\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n09 The Loco-Motion (B-Side)\n\n10 Vacant Possession (B-Side)\n\n11 The Score (Single Edit)\n\nCD2 (The Sprocket Sessions – Remastered)\n\n01 The Score\n\n02 Learning To Fly\n\n03 The Miracle\n\n04 Knife Edge\n\n05 Tarkus\n\n06 Pictures At an Exhibition\n\n07 Lucky Man\n\n08 Still, You Turn Me On\n\n09 Love Blind\n\n10 Mars Bringer Of War\n\n11 Touch & Go\n\n12 Pirates"
