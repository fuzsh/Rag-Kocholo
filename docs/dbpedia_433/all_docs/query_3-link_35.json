        "text": "After The Nice disbanded in 1970, Emerson teamed up with bassist/vocalist Greg Lake and drummer/percussionist Carl Palmer to form Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The band's self-titled debut album was released in 1970 and became a hit, reaching #4 on the UK album charts. ELP went on to release several more albums, including \"Tarkus\" (1971), \"Trilogy\" (1972), and \"Brain Salad Surgery\" (1973), which featured the popular track \"Karn Evil 9.\"\n\nEmerson's keyboard skills were a defining element of ELP's sound, as he incorporated elements of classical music, jazz, and electronic music into his playing. He was also known for his use of synthesizers, which were still relatively new at the time, and he helped to popularize the instrument in rock music.\n\nIn addition to his work with ELP, Emerson released several solo albums, including \"Honky\" (1980) and \"Changing States\" (1995). He also composed music for films and television, including the soundtrack for the 1981 horror film \"Inferno.\"\n\nEmerson continued to perform and record music throughout his career, and he remained a popular figure in the world of progressive rock. He was known for his virtuosic playing, his showmanship, and his dedication to pushing the boundaries of what was possible with keyboards and synthesizers.\n\nSadly, in 2016, Keith Emerson was found dead in his home in Santa Monica, California. He had suffered from depression and physical ailments, and his death was ruled a suicide. His legacy as a pioneering keyboardist and composer in the world of progressive rock continues to be celebrated by fans and fellow musicians alike."
