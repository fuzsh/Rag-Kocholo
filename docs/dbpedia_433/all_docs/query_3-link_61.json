        "text": "With the intention of expanding their musical creativity, bassist Greg Lake and keyboardist Keith Emerson looked to form a rock supergroup, eventually becoming Emerson, Lake & Palmer in 1970 after the recruitment of drummer Carl Palmer. The three noticed an instant chemistry, and capitalised, leaving their former bands behind and becoming one of the most heralded progressive rock acts of all-time.\n\nIn this special review, we’re going to be taking a look at every studio album released by supergroup and collective of tax exiles Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and ranking them from worst to best!\n\n#9 – ‘Love Beach’ (1978)\n\nThe first album detailed in a ‘worst to best’ list may often be the worst by default, or simply slightly weaker than the rest of the band’s output. ‘Love Beach’, a.k.a. ‘Dreck: The Album’, is absolutely, without a doubt, the worst ELP album. It feels so detached from the rest of the trio’s catalogue, it’s honestly surprising that it was released in the ‘70s.\n\nFull of tacky power pop and overly simplified themes of sex and attachment, ‘Love Beach’ spits in the face of the band’s previous ambition. With opener ‘All I Want Is You’, I’m not sure which is worse, the prog-snubbing basicness or the obscene cheesiness, and then the title track confirms the smuttiness, with Greg Lake geekily yelping “WE CAN MAKE LOVE ON LOOOOVE BEACH” – my god, he REALLY wants to make love to someone on Love Beach, presumably after taking a swim in Greg Lake.\n\nSpeaking of overbearing vocals, Lake’s final takes on ‘For You’ are some of the worst here, absolutely horrible (“FOR YOUUUU”), and I would say this is cancelled out by some outrageous, kickass instrumentals from the three guys, but nothing stands out. ‘The instrumental section in the middle of ‘Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman’ is pretty cool, but the track itself is one long bore – and as for ‘Canario’, well, in my notes for this album I just wrote ‘lol’.\n\nEven on some of their better albums, Emerson, Lake & Palmer can feel a little corny, but there is absolutely no tact where ‘Love Beach’ is concerned. I can only assume the shores of ‘Love Beach’ are full uncomfortable pebbles, washed-up urchins and those plastic things that hold cans of beer together, because no image painted by ELP here feels pleasant. As I said, it’s dreck, and as for the people who disagree, we will fight them on the love beaches.\n\nWeakest songs – ‘Love Beach’ – ‘Canario’.\n\nDishonourable mentions – Everything else.\n\nRating – 3 out of 10\n\n#8 – ‘In the Hot Seat’ (1994)\n\nThe final studio album of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, ‘In the Hot Seat’ just sounds like a bunch of leftover cheese from the past. Hardly hot garbage, but it’s obvious the trio no longer had any quivers or bombshells left in their arsenal.\n\nIf any of the songs here were actually old ideas, producer Keith Olsen did his best to make them sound as ‘90s as possible. As I type that, I realise that isn’t necessarily a good thing, because on some tracks, like ‘Gone Too Soon’, with its overbearing horns, it does feel as though ELP are auditioning for the next Disney renaissance movie – unfortunately, their phone number was next to Phil Collins on the prog rock section of Disney’s phone book, and they accidentally called him instead.\n\nAnd the typical ‘90s balladry sticks around with ‘Give Me a Reason to Stay’, equipped with some pretty dozy country rhythms earlier on in the track, and hell, it almost sounds as though ‘Thin Line’ is trying a New Jack Swing approach, something best kept away from three old white dudes.\n\nI also find opener ‘Hand of Truth’, one of the most popular songs from ‘In the Hot Seat’, a bit too much, but there are a few tracks they I do consider to be a bit tidier or more adventurous. I like ‘Daddy’, mainly for the sentiment, all about the disappearance of Sara Anne Wood, the case of which is actually still open today, and I like the almost-industrial vibe of ‘One by One’, and the reasonably triumphant ‘Heart on Ice’.\n\nUnlike ‘Love Beach’, there are a few songs you may be about to pick out of the tracklist here and enjoy. Though at its best, ‘In the Hot Seat’ is still quite lukewarm.\n\nFavourite song – ‘One by One’.\n\nWeakest songs – ‘Thin Line’ – ‘Give Me a Reason to Stay’ – ‘Gone Too Soon’.\n\nRating – 4 out of 10\n\n#7 – ‘Works Volume 2’ (1977)\n\nThe second volume of ELP’s ‘Works’ duology has its moments, but it’s also a fairly tactless ‘shit at the fan’ affair for the most part.\n\nYou may recognised a bunch of cuts from the tracklist, some of which are old ELP songs, covers of fairly well-known songs, or Greg Lake Christmas ventures. ‘Brain Salad Surgery’ makes an appearance, as does Scott Joplin’s ‘Maple Leaf Rag’, but the standout has to be closing track ‘Show Me the Way to Go Home’ – it features a glorious backing arrangement, but Greg Lake’s vocals are insanely hammed up. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss will forever be the greatest trio to sing that song.\n\nAs for the mightier moments on ‘Works Volume 2’ – quirky rock n roll never suited ELP more than it does on ‘Tiger in a Spotlight’, and the sweeter side of Greg Lake’s lyrics is showcased on ‘Watching Over You’, though it could easily be construed as creepy. I also enjoy how jazzy ‘So Far to Fall’ gets once it really kicks in.\n\nThe band also tries a bit of honky tonk here, and surprisingly, the results aren’t completely disastrous. ‘Barrelhouse Shake-Down’ gets so much better as it goes on and more layers are introduced, which is grand because the resounding feeling of “oh, here we go” is ever-present during the first few bars. But as for ‘Honky Tonk Train Blues’, well, on my notes I just wrote ‘ffs’.\n\n‘Works Volume 2’ may as well have been called ‘Whatever Works’, with the result being ‘not much’.\n\nFavourite song – ‘So Far to Fall’.\n\nWeakest song – ‘Honky Tonk Train Blues’.\n\nDishonourable mention – ‘Bullfrog’.\n\nRating – 5 out of 10\n\n#6 – ‘Black Moon’ (1992)\n\nAfter a lengthy absence, Emerson, Lake & Palmer returned in 1992 with ‘Black Moon’, and well, it’s a shitload more dignified than ‘Love Beach’.\n\nI guess one of the most noticeable aspects of ‘Black Moon’ is how cracked Greg Lake’s voice feels. He’s definitely aged here, but on a few occasions, see the title track, he manages to use it to his advantage, sounding quite wise, domineering and commanding, fruitful even. That being said, his voice definitely lets him down on ‘Affairs of the Heart’, which is hardly a terrible song, but he definitely has a lot of trouble being powerful.\n\nI’m going to be weird here and say ‘Romeo and Juliet’ is actually my favourite track – I think it’s a genuinely strong rendition of the piece from the ballet of the same name – you’ll recognise it once you listen. And other highlights include ‘Paper Blood’, which is fairly cheesy but has pretty decent money-based lyrics, and ‘Farewell to Arms’, which again, is cheesy, but you can’t hate a song about saying goodbye to your arms – it’s also the kind of song David Gilmour would write and get complimented for. And hell, speaking of, ‘Black Moon’ pretty much is just ELP’s ‘Division Bell’, and that’s fine.\n\nI’d be lying if I said ‘Black Moon’ is a particularly slick album, but while Greg Lake’s voice may feel aged, and band’s instrumentation and songwriting certainly doesn’t.\n\nFavourite songs – ‘Black Moon’ – ‘Romeo and Juliet’.\n\nHonourable mention – ‘Paper Blood’.\n\nWeakest songs – ‘Changing States’ – ‘Burning Bridges’ – ‘Close to Home’ – ‘Better Days’ – ‘Footprints in the Snow’.\n\nRating – 5 out of 10\n\n#5 – ‘Works Volume 1’ (1977)\n\nAnother creative hodgepodge from ELP, the first volume of ‘Works’ doesn’t quite devour its follow-up, but cast your rod into this eclectic pond, and you’re bound to fish out something you’re able to stomach.\n\nAnd that’s just it, I think it’s mainly the length of this album that stops it from being a definitive, positive experience. ‘Works Volume 1’ is split into three sections, with each member of the group taking charge for one. The entirety of Keith Emerson’s section is one long piano concerto. It’s experimental, neo-classical, and really not that interesting – but Greg Lake takes over next, and his value as a songwriter is realised for the most part, because is emphasis on pop/rock gives the album some much needed melody.\n\nMy favourite Lake compositions are ‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’, which is notably jazzy, and features lyrics full of wordplay like “there may be an ‘O’ in ‘moment’, but there’s very few folk in ‘focus’”, and ‘Nobody Loves You Like I Do’, which is one of the rare moments that ELP make a great song out of such simplicity, possibly their catchiest outside of ‘Karn Evil 9’.\n\nI also like the pleasant violins of ‘Lend Your Love to Me Tonight’, and the beautiful arrangements that try their hardest to overtake the cheesiness of Lake’s vocals in ‘C’est La Vie’. I’m not so fond of Carl Palmer’s section of the album, mind you. The band’s instrumental game sounds off on ‘The Enemy God Dances with the Black Spirits’, ‘L.A. Nights’ has some of the silliest vocals in the entire ELP canon – but while the theatrics of ‘Pirates’ and ‘Fanfare for the Common Man’ and the new version of ‘Tank are pretty comical and dumbfounded, the wild rockiness of ‘Food for Your Soul’ makes it all worth it.\n\nYour numerous experiences with ‘Works Volume 1’ may vary, from fantastical to gruelling.\n\nFavourite song – ‘Nobody Loves You Like I Do’.\n\nHonourable mention – ‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’.\n\nWeakest songs – ‘The Enemy God Dances with the Black Spirits’ – ‘L.A. Nights’.\n\nRating – 6 out of 10\n\n#4 – ‘Brain Salad Surgery’ (1973)\n\nSometimes underdeveloped, sometimes overdeveloped, ‘Brain Salad Surgery’ is a strange, convoluted album, a key ingredient to becoming a little overrated – but my word, the best moments of this album, are the very best moments of Emerson, Lake & Palmer.\n\nOf course, I’m talking about ‘Karn Evil 9’, more-or-less the entirety but mainly the first impression. I love how on both parts of the first impression, the band keeps adding more and more instrumental layers with each verse, and while I wish Greg Lake’s showman-type vocals were a little less ridiculous, they don’t really get in the way of the greatness of the song. The first section of the second part is iconic (“welcome back my friends to the show that never ends”), and the lyrics, while daft, continue to be spectacular as the song plays out (“soon the gypsy queen in a glaze of Vaseline will perform on guillotine what a scene what a scene”).\n\nThe rest of ‘Brain Salad Surgery’ is the pinnacle of rock silliness, and yes, that’s an insult. The album opens with ‘Jerusalem’, yes, THAT ‘Jerusalem’, and the mere decision to do this is the most hokey thing ELP has done, bettered only by the song itself. Then there’s the slightly hackneyed prog rock of ‘Toccata’, though you can’t say the song isn’t sonically imposing, and ‘Benny the Bouncer’, which is some of the most painful, ‘haha comical album track’ rock you’ll ever here, and it really isn’t that comical.\n\nOn ‘Brain Salad Surgery’, the iconic good outweighs the pantomime bad – it also has a pretty cool title.\n\nFavourite songs – ‘Karn Evil 9 1st Impression, Pt. 1’ – ‘Karn Evil 9 1st Impression, Pt. 2’.\n\nWeakest song – ‘Benny the Bouncer’.\n\nDishonourable mention – ‘Jerusalem’.\n\nRating – 6.5 out of 10\n\n#3 – ‘Tarkus’ (1971)\n\n‘Tarkus’ captures the spirit of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but also the yin and yang of the band’s style, just about managing to traverse past maximum destitute rock n roll.\n\nIt’s a pretty uncool album, let’s face it. Stylistically, it’s very early ‘70s, grey-haired and overly prog – but of that ilk, this is some of the best you’re likely to hear. The title track is one big statement, completely capturing everything about ELP that puts the young people off, but man there’s some excellent instrumentation and songwriting here – colour-oozing organ solos, ambitious in structure, and fair enough, it’s mainly just a bunch of songs stuck together rather than a piece made up of actual transitions, but it’s a gargantuan piece of prog rock.\n\nThere are no more epics, but the rest of the album is pretty snug, if not hit-and-miss when it comes to appeal. ‘Jeremy Bender’ is a true quirky old man song, not as bad as ‘Benny the Bouncer’, but I’m not too fond of the jangly piano and pseudo-humorous lyrics (“talked with his sister and spoke with a whisper, threatened to fist her if she didn’t come clean”). And I guess closing track ‘Are You Ready Eddy?’, a throwback rock n roll number, fits in well with ‘Jeremy Bender’ – it’s just as uncool, but I guess they were having fun, and I love the way it sounds like “fuck me Eddy” is being shouted.\n\nOutside of the title track, whatever greatness lies in ‘Tarkus’ comes in moments – on ‘Bitches Crystal’, the instruments synchronise to create a sense of chaos, ‘A Time and a Place’ has some pretty hammy high notes, but I love the arrangement, especially on the last verse when all instruments excluding the lone synthesizer cut out, and ‘The Only Way’ features some incredibly chilling pipe organ playing from Keith Emerson, and I like how it segues into ‘Infinite Space’, though the vocal melody sounds like ‘Here Comes the Bride’, and some of the conscious lyrics are too over-the-top (“why did he lose…SIX MILLION JEWS?”.\n\nThere aren’t too many ‘70s classic rock albums that don’t feature goofy album tracks, so while that aspect might be the worst thing about ‘Tarkus’, it doesn’t mess it up too greatly.\n\nFavourite song – ‘Tarkus’.\n\nHonourable mention – ‘Bitches Crystal’.\n\nWeakest song – ‘Jeremy Bender’.\n\nRating – 7 out of 10\n\n#2 – ‘Emerson, Lake & Palmer’ (1970)\n\nTaking a hammer to pop convention, the shifting of eras took rock to a new purpose and responsibility, where technicality would be celebrated the same way it would in jazz and classical, where song structures may glide to heights unheard of, and maturity meant money.\n\nDamn, Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s debut album, eponymously-titled, really fucked things up, didn’t it? Like King Crimson and a few other explorative bands, this anti-era for rock change people’s perception of music, for better or for worse. Luckily, ELP’s initial role in this movement was a sonically-beautiful one, just check out ‘The Barbarian’, which kicks the album off with a heavy riff (buzzzz buzz buzz buzzzz), and the vicious, Jon Lord-esque organ playing on ‘Knife-Edge’.\n\nSome of ELP’s greatest sounds appear on their debut album, but nothing is as great as closer ‘Lucky Man’, one of the band’s most famous songs, with a big shift in chords in the chorus, and lots of cool Moog synth. Along with ‘The Barbarian’ and its more held-back structure, you could say this album is bookended by the trio’s simpler side, which isn’t that simple at all.\n\nAnd so I guess there actually is something quite rebellious about early ELP’s breed of progressive rock. Fair enough, you play this stuff in school and you’re still going to get coins thrown at you by bullies, who are inadvertently funding your lunch, and ‘Take a Pebble’ includes a folk instrumental that is just so full of its own shit, but there is a level of focussed sheerness to this project – particularly on ‘Tank’, with its weird rock n roll section, joining the track after an incredible drum solo – and hey, for all you nerds, there’s a nice moment where the bass syncs up with a clavinet.\n\nOn their self-titled album, Emerson, Lake & Palmer boldly went where one or two men had gone before.\n\nFavourite songs – ‘The Barbarian’ – ‘Lucky Man’.\n\nRating – 7.5 out of 10\n\n#1 – ‘Trilogy’ (1972)\n\nAnd finally, ‘Trilogy’ may not have the reputation of the best album by a much-celebrated classic rock band, but hey, it was Greg Lake’s favourite, so why not?\n\nThink the epic, longer ELP cuts, and the wimpier album tracks, turn both into the best they could possibly be, and you’ve got yourself a pretty damn good rock album in ‘Trilogy’. ‘The Endless Enigma’ is made up of two parts, the first is easily the best but there is a brilliant, gigantic crescendo in the second, as the two are held apart by ‘Fugue’, which is a really nice piano interlude. But yes, the first part has one of the band’s coolest riffs/melodies, this flashy main organ melody, and I love how huge Greg Lake manages to make the vocal sections feel.\n\nThe title track isn’t as big or powerful as ‘Enigma’, but it still packs in some memorable sections and vocal melodies – and as I said, some of the smaller tracks here manage to achieve so much too. ‘From the Beginning’, is a misty acoustic number, and for you modern psychedelic fans, it sounds like it could’ve been the inspiration for ‘Siberian Breaks’ by MGMT. And the band really lets their collective freaky side out on space rock instrumental ‘Abaddon’s Bolero’, closing the album on a mad, mad note.\n\nEven the country/western influenced songs are at least somewhat pleasant on ‘Trilogy’. I love the main organ line of ‘The Sheriff’, which is also a step up from ‘Jeremy Bender’ lyrically, telling the story of an outlaw who eventually shoots and kills the town’s sheriff, and while ‘Hoedown’ might be a bit tacky, I really enjoy some of the interpolations heard on the track, including ‘Turkey in the Straw’.\n\nMaybe my relationship with Emerson, Lake & Palmer isn’t as strong as some of their contemporaries, but I’m really grateful for the music they’ve come out with that has managed to test me, and people teach me a thing or two. ‘Trilogy’ is the main example, a prog rock knockout that deserves a little more credit than it gets.\n\nFavourite songs – ‘The Endless Enigma, Pt. 1’ – ‘From the Beginning’.\n\nHonourable mention – ‘The Endless Enigma, Pt. 2’."
