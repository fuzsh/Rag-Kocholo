        "text": "from Emerson's book\n\nLate one afternoon, I wandered into Advision Studios. Greg was overdubbing some acoustic guitar over some other acoustic guitar. This surprised me because I didn't expect him to be there. But there he was strumming away to what sounded like a Country and Western tune in three-four. It was almost folksy in style and I thought totally out of character with all we had recorded previously. Carl arrived next.\n\n'Did you know about this?' I asked.\n\nCarl just shrugged his shoulders as we both listened in the control room.\n\nWhen Greg joined us, I asked where that one came from. He was briefly non-commital, then in a rare moment of modesty pronounced it as 'just a bit of fun'. As Carl was now in the studio, 'Would he mind laying a drum pattern over this bit of fun?'\n\nIt wasn't easy because there was no click track, but Carl agreed to try, knowing that this represented the difference between having an album, touring or going home to Birmingham. While all this was going on, I sat back while Greg overdubbed some bass guitar and added a guide vocal. The more I listened, the more appealing the piece sounded; almost like a jazz waltz. There seemed to be an awful lot of strumming at the end and, spotting what I assumed to be the resident Moog Synthesizer in the studio's ante room, got with Eddie Offord to effect a patch. The instrument had sat there so long everybody was afraid to touch it, including Eddie and me. We grabbed a handful of cables.\n\n'I think if I stick this jack-plug in this hole and this jack-plug in this hole we should get some sort of a noise,' said Eddie.\n\nI tapped the keyboard hopefully and was rewarded with a rather bland tone.\n\n'Try doing the same patch again with another oscillator,' I suggested.\n\nEddie complied and I tapped the keyboard again. This time it sounded a little more hopeful after fiddling with the oscillator's tuning. One oscillator left, we patched that the same way and Eddie went back into the control room to bring it up on one of the remaining tracks and issue me with a pair of headphones so that I could hear 'the story so far'. The portamento knob seemed to be a load of fun during the level check; you could 'slur' notes. I made a mental note to use the effect when they ran the tape. Greg found the intercom switch in the control room and my ears rang.\n\n'We'll drop you in at the end.'\n\n'OW! Turn the ****ing cans down.'\n\n'Sorry!'\n\nI was able to see both Greg and Eddie from my playing position and just waited for their signal for me to start playing. When I did, I counted all the possibilities of all the lines I was improvising. There seemed to be a never-ending wealth of 'licks' to be played over the simple modal outro. When I'd finished, I looked up to see two happy faces in the control room.\n\n'Come and have a listen,' yelled Greg again, down the intercom.\n\n'Ah, come on. That was only a run through. Give me another pass and I'll really cook.'\n\nThey were both insistent, so I joined them in the control room to listen. But I was not convinced, even as the tapes were finally delivered to the record company. I though it was the most mediocre solo I'd ever played.\n\nFinally, a huge crate arrived at Drayton Gardens all the way from Buffalo, New York. I excitedly broke into the box and there it was - my own Moog Synthesizer. Its inventor, Dr. Robert Moog, had written: 'All of our previous products were made as supplements for recording studios; they were not designed for road use. I understand that you want to tour with your instrument so, as an experiment, we have built a pre-set box that will enable you to have up to eight different sounds. Good luck.'\n\nI pulled it all out and began setting it up but it proved more complicated as there was no accompanying manual. I might just as well have tried building my telephone exchange. After an hour, I found out how to switch it on, but that was all. I called Mike Vickers, who must have detected my frustration.\n\n'Can you bring it over and leave it with me for a week?' he said.\n\nA week later, Mike called to say he'd got about four different patches (sounds) out of it, but it hadn't been easy. I was eternally grateful for his help. Our first gig was only weeks away and I wanted the Moog to play a major part in the debut.\n\nI have a very fond memory of hearing the first album.\n\nI use to frequent The Folk Music Center in Claremont, California that was run by Ben Harper’s grand parents. My brother and a friend of ours would spend time in the store just looking around at all the unusual instruments and generally just hanging out because the place had such a cool vibe.\n\nAnyways, we were in the store one day and the owners asked us if we wanted to come by the store the next night because they were getting in the debut album by Emerson Lake and Palmer. They were really pumped to hear it but I was more like ‘Ok ... who are they again?’ I had heard “America” by the Nice and I had the first King Crimson album but I had no idea of the formation of this new supergroup.\n\nSo the next night we get there, along with another half dozen other invited friends and settle in. They had pillows thrown all over the floor, offered everyone some tea and after about 20 minutes they lit a bunch of candles, turned off the lights and Charles dropped the needle on side one.\n\nAfter the final note of side two we were all silent a half minute before someone spoke. We didn’t talk too much but everyone felt compelled to hang around for 10-15 minutes because of the shared emotional attachment.\n\nThere were some quiet thank you’s and goodbyes and then everyone headed home ... done in. Whew!"
