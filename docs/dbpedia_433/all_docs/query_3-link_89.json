They revolutionised the '70s music scene by introducing a new lineup format of keyboards, bass (and occasionally guitar), and percussion. However, this did not impede their popularity, as the geniality and virtually unlimited musical ability of each of the three members combined to generate a musical level which had not yet been achieved by any other group. All the members came from well established groups: Greg Lake from King Crimson, Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster, and Keith Emerson from The Nice.ELP released ten albums during the seventies, the best of which are arguably Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery. Near the end of the seventies the band had big ego issues, and the music considerably worsened. The group constantly pushed their abilities to the limits, and even with the technological limitations of the ear, managed to break new ground and set new parameters in the emerging progressive music scene in Britain. After a long break, the band regrouped in the 1990s, and their last studio album, In The Hot Seat was released in 1994. Â« hide"
