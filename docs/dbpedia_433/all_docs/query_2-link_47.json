        "text": "This is one of my favorite synth-driven albums from the Emerson, Lake & Palmer discography. I first heard “The Endless Enigma,” and “Trilogy” at our friend McCrea’s house when I was nine, while our family was moving from San Bernardino to Oxnard. I played some classical pieces by Bach and Debussy, and when E.L.P. started playing through the speakers, I turned on my tape recorder to remember it. When the synths were recreating horn sounds on the last part of “The Endless Enigma”, I was imagining a live orchestra in my head. Then when the synthesizer played its first solo on the title track, I had no idea what that instrument was. I remember thinking, “What sound is that?” I had never heard a synthesizer play lead like that! Then I kept the tape going before the song came to an end! My favorite part in the song is where the two Moog solos are playing off each other, leading into a cool contrary motion (one instrument goes up the scale, while the other goes down the scale), and the reverb increases in volume. This is from 7:17 to 7:22. I was fascinated to hear how many ideas you can play without a chordal instrument like a piano or guitar.\n\nThen when I first heard the closer “Abaddon’s Bolero,” I had been familiar with Ravel’s famous impressionistic piece, how it gradually builds from individual instruments to ensembles, and increase in volume per section. So when I heard that E.L.P. created a piece with that mindset, I was curious to see what they would do. I was also surprised to hear the multiple harmonic changes as well, plus the really cool synth solos during the last few times of the song!\n\nThen later, when I heard that Keith orchestrated this piece later on in his career, I was very excited. We both imagined these songs being orchestrated, and I was so happy that Keith had the opportunity to do it!\n\nThis is just one of my favorite E.L.P. albums they made during their creative and technical peak. Whenever I think of Keith and Greg’s music and legacy, this is the era I like to go to, especially when I play on my Nord organ, and I hope in the future to create an album interpreting or composing songs in that mindset."
