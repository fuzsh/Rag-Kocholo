        "text": "Fanfare 1970 – 1997 is a lavish and comprehensive career-spanning new box set that showcases the talents of English progressive rock group Emerson, Lake & Palmer.\n\nThe set mixes familiar content (classic albums on CD) with less familiar fare, including newly remastered versions of late period albums (Love Beach, Black Moon and In The Hot Seat) and a quartet of CDs featuring previously unreleased live performances (mastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham).\n\nThis is a multi-media package – it includes 18 CDs andfive pieces of vinyl (a 3LP Live in Italy album and two seven-inch singles). A blu-ray audio includes 5.1 surround mixes of four albums, plus hi-res stereo mixes and bonus tracks.\n\nAlso included are a host of nostalgic memorabilia artefacts: replica tour programmes, poster, brochure and a 40-page hardcover book which takes you through ELP’s career, album-by-album. There’s also a metal pin badge for good measure. Much of the paper items above are secured in a bespoke wallet, which sits on top of the contents when you open the lid of the box.\n\nProduced by BMG, this is a box in the style of When Slade Rocked The World, or Frankie Goes To Hollywood‘s Inside The Pleasuredome. The CDs reside within a foam fitment at the bottom, with the vinyl, book and wallet stacked on top. Each box is numbered (a limited edition of 3000), although the numbering is on the ‘spec sheet’ on the rear and not the box itself.\n\nFanfare 1970 – 1997 will be released on 27 October 2017. It can be purchased from PledgeMusic for £152, and through Pledge you get an exclusive bonus CD of the previously unreleased Black Moon – Rough Album Mixes. If you can do without that, it’s £113 on Amazon UK right now.\n\nIn the box\n\nCDs: Original albums\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer (2012 remaster)\n\nTarkus (2012 remaster)\n\nPictures at an Exhibition (2016 remaster)\n\nTrilogy (2015 remaster)\n\nBrain Salad Surgery (2014 remaster)\n\nWelcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen (2CD) (2016 remaster)\n\nThe Works Volume 1 (2CD) (2017 remaster)\n\nThe Works Volume 2 (2017 remaster)\n\nLove Beach (2017 remaster)\n\nBlack Moon (2017 remaster)\n\nIn The Hot Seat (2017 remaster)\n\nCDs: Live performances (Previously unreleased)\n\nLive at Pocono International Raceway, USA 8th July 1972\n\nOn The BBC (Whistle Test ’79 / Pop Goes Summer ’93)\n\nLive at Waterloo Concert Field Stanhope NJ USA, 31st July 1992\n\nLive at Birmingham Symphony Hall, 27th November 1992\n\nLive at Élysée Montmartre, Paris, 2nd July 1997\n\nBlu-ray audio disc\n\nStereo and 5.1 mixes of:\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer (Steven Wilson 2012 remixes)\n\nTarkus (Steven Wilson 2012 remixes)\n\nTrilogy (Jakko M Jakszyk 2015 remixes)\n\nBrain Salad Surgery (Jakko M Jakszyk 2014 remixes)\n\nVinyl\n\n3LP vinyl LP (Previously unreleased)\n\nELP Live In Italy: Rome & Milan 1973\n\n7″ vinyl singles\n\nLucky Man/Knife Edge\n\nFanfare For The Common Man/Brain Salad Surgery\n\nArtefacts\n\nReplica 1974 and 1992 tour programmes\n\nReprinted 1970 promo poster\n\nReprinted 1972 promo brochure\n\nMetal/enamel ELP pin-badge\n\n40-page 12″ x 12″ hardcover book with photos, notes from Chris Welch and quote from the band\n\nDetailed track listing\n\nCDs\n\nCD1 – Emerson, Lake & Palmer\n\n1.
