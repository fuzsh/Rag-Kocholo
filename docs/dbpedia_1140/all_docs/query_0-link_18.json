Mutations causing cherubism have been identified in the adaptor protein SH3BP2. Knock-in mice with a Pro416Arg mutation in Sh3bp2 exhibit a generalized osteoporotic bone phenotype. In this study, we examined the effects of this âcherubismâ mutation on spectroscopic indices of âbone qualityâ and on osteoblast differentiation. Fourier-transform infrared imaging (FTIRI) analysis of femurs from wild-type and Sh3bp2 knock-in mice showed decreased mineral content, decreased mineral crystallinity/crystal size, and increased collagen maturity in homozygous mutants. To assess osteoblast maturation in vivo, knock-in mice were crossed with transgenic mice over-expressing GFP driven by 3.6-kb or 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter fragments. Reduced numbers of mature osteoblasts were observed in homozygous mice. Neonatal calvarial cultures, which were enriched for osteoblasts by depletion of hematopoietic cells (negative selection for Ter119- and CD45-positive cells) were investigated for osteoblast-specific gene expression and differentiation, which demonstrated that differentiation and mineralization in homozygous osteoblast cultures was impaired. Co-cultures with calvarial osteoblasts and bone marrow macrophages showed that mutant osteoblasts appear to increase osteoclastogenesis resulting in increased bone resorption on bone chips. In summary, the Sh3bp2 mutation in cherubism mice alters bone quality, reduces osteoblast function, and may contribute to excessive bone resorption by osteoclasts. Our data, together with previous osteoclast studies, demonstrate a critical role of Sh3bp2 in bone remodeling and osteoblast differentiation.

Osteoclasts differentiate after binding of sRANKL to RANK induces a number of downstream signaling effects, including activation of the calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway. Here we have investigated the functional significance of SH3BP2 protein on osteoclastogenesis in the presence of sRANKL. Our results indicate that SH3BP2 both increases nuclear NFATc1 in sRANKL treated RAW 264.7 preosteoclast cells and enhances expression of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), a specific marker of osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of SH3BP2 in RAW 264.7 cells potentiates sRANKL stimulated phosphorylation of PLCÎ³1 and 2, thus providing a mechanistic pathway for the rapid translocation of NFATc1 into the nucleus and increased osteoclastogenesis in cherubism.

SH3-domain binding protein-1 (SH3BP1) specifically inactivating Rac1 and its target Wave2 is required for cell motility, thus regarded as an essential regulator of cancer cell metastasis. However, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of SH3BP1 in cervical cancer progression are still unknown. The present study is aimed to investigate the mechanism of SH3BP1 in regulation of cervical cancer cell metastasis and chemoresistance. In the present study, we demonstrated a high SH3BP1 expression in cervical cancer tissues; a higher SH3BP1 expression is also correlated with a shorter overall survival of patients with cervical cancer. Further, we revealed that SH3BP1 overexpression promoted the invasion, migration, and chemoresistance of cervical cancer cell through increasing Rac1 activity and Wave2 protein level. The promotive effect of SH3BP1 could be partially reversed by a Rac1 inhibitor, NSC 23766. In cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer tissues, SH3BP1, Rac1, and Wave2 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated compared to that of the cisplatin-sensitive cervical cancer tissues. Taken together, SH3BP1/Rac1/Wave2 pathway may potentially act as an effective therapeutic target combined with traditional cisplatin-based chemotherapy for cervical cancer.

The Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Cdc42 regulates sequential molecular processes during cellâcell junction formation; hence, mechanisms must exist that inactivate Cdc42 in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. In this paper, we identify SH3BP1, a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and Rac, as a regulator of junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis using a functional small interfering ribonucleic acid screen. Depletion of SH3BP1 resulted in loss of spatial control of Cdc42 activity, stalled membrane remodeling, and enhanced growth of filopodia. SH3BP1 formed a complex with JACOP/paracingulin, a junctional adaptor, and CD2AP, a scaffolding protein; both were required for normal Cdc42 signaling and junction formation. The filamentous actinâcapping protein CapZ also associated with the SH3BP1 complex and was required for control of actin remodeling. Epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis thus require a dual activity complex, containing SH3BP1 and CapZ, that is recruited to sites of active membrane remodeling to guide Cdc42 signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.

These defects can lead to an increased incidence of otitis media. We examined the effects of a mutation in the Sh3pxd2b gene (Sh3pxd2bnee) on the progression of otitis media and hearing impairment at various developmental stages. We found that all mice that had the Sh3pxd2bnee mutation went on to develop craniofacial dysmorphologies and subsequently otitis media, by as early as 11 days of age. We found noteworthy changes in cilia and goblet cells of the middle ear mucosa in Sh3pxd2bnee mutant mice using scanning electronic microscopy. By measuring craniofacial dimensions, we determined for the first time in an animal model that this mouse has altered eustachian tube morphology consistent with a more horizontal position of the eustachian tube. All mutants were found to have hearing impairment. Expression of TNF-Î± and TLR2, which correlates with inflammation in otitis media, was up-regulated in the ears of mutant mice when examined by immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The mouse model with a mutation in the Sh3pxd2b gene (Sh3pxd2bnee) mirrors craniofacial dysmorphology and otitis media in humans.

Overexpression of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of 3BP2 results in the dramatic suppression of antigen-induced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Previously, a linker for activation of T cells (LAT) was identified as one of the 3BP2 SH2 domain-binding protein. In this report, to further understand the functions of 3BP2 in FcÎµRI-mediated activation of mast cell, we explored the protein that associates with the SH2 domain of 3BP2 and found that SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) inducibly interacts with the SH2 domain of 3BP2 after the aggregation of FcÎµRI. The phosphorylation of Tyr(564) in the carboxy (C)-terminal tail region of SHP-1 is required for the direct interaction of SHP-1 to the SH2 domain of 3BP2. The expression of the mutant form of SHP-1 which was unable to interact with 3BP2 resulted in the significant reduction in SHP-1-mediated tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) production without any effects on the degranulation in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. These findings suggest that 3BP2 directly interacts with Tyr(564) -phosphorylated form of SHP-1 and positively regulates the function of SHP-1 in FcÎµRI-mediated signaling in mast cells.

The present study shows SH3BP1 expression patterns in human HCC tissues and cell lines were examined. The regulation of SH3BP1 on HCC cell migration and invasion related to Rac1-WAVE2 signaling was characterized using in vitro and in vivo models. SH3BP1 overexpressed in HCC tissues and highly metastatic HCC cells was significantly associated vascular invasion (VI). SH3BP1 promoted VEGF secretion via Rac1-WAVE2 signaling, so as to exert an augmentation on cell invasion and microvessel formation. In three study cohorts with a total of 516 HCC patients, high SH3BP1 expression combined with high microvessel density (MVD) was confirmed as a powerful independent predictor of HCC prognosis in both training cohorts and validation cohort. Being an important angiogenic factor of HCC through Rac1-WAVE2 signaling, SH3BP1 promotes tumor invasion and microvessel formation contributing to HCC metastasis and recurrence. SH3BP1 is a novel WAVE2 regulator, a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target of HCC.

Kv7.2/Kv7.3 dysfunction resulting from KCNQ2 mutations predominantly causes self-limited or benign epilepsy in neonates, but also causes early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Retigabine (RTG), a Kv7.2/ Kv7.3-channel opener, seems to be a rational antiepileptic drug for epilepsies caused by KCNQ2 mutations. We therefore evaluated the effects of RTG on seizures in two strains of knock-in mice harboring different Kcnq2 mutations, in comparison to the effects of phenobarbital (PB), which is the first-line antiepileptic drug for seizures in neonates. The subjects were heterozygous knock-in mice (Kcnq2Y284C/+ and Kcnq2A306T/+) bearing the Y284C or A306T Kcnq2 mutation, respectively, and their wild-type (WT) littermates, at 63-100 days of age. Seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA, 12mg/kg) were recorded using a video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring system. Effects of RTG on KA-induced seizures of both strains of knock-in mice were assessed using seizure scores from a modified Racine's scale and compared with those of PB. The number and total duration of spike bursts on EEG and behaviors monitored by video recording were also used to evaluate the effects of RTG and PB. Both Kcnq2Y284C/+ and Kcnq2A306T/+ mice showed significantly more KA-induced seizures than WT mice. RTG significantly attenuated KA-induced seizure activities in both Kcnq2Y284C/+ and Kcnq2A306T/+ mice, and more markedly than PB. This is the first reported evidence of RTG ameliorating KA-induced seizures in knock-in mice bearing mutations of Kcnq2, with more marked effects than those observed with PB. RTG or other Kv7.2-channel openers may be considered as first-line antiepileptic treatments for epilepsies resulting from KCNQ2 mutations.\n\nTyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 is indispensable for the interaction with VAV3 in chicken DT40 cells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChihara, Kazuyasu; Organization for Life Science Advancement Programs, University of Fukui, Fukui 910-1193; Kimura, Yukihiro\n\nAdaptor protein c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2) is known to play regulatory roles in immunoreceptor-mediated signal transduction.

Genetic deletion of SH2B1 in mice results in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SH2B1 loci and chromosomal deletions of the SH2B1 loci associate with obesity and insulin resistance in humans. In cultured cells, SH2B1 promotes leptin and insulin signaling by binding via its SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosines in Janus kinase 2 and the insulin receptor, respectively. Here we generated three lines of mice to analyze the role of the SH2 domain of SH2B1 in the central nervous system. Transgenic mice expressing wild-type, SH2 domain-defective (R555E), or SH2 domain-alone (ÎN503) forms of SH2B1 specifically in neurons were crossed with SH2B1 knockout mice to generate KO/SH2B1, KO/R555E, or KO/ÎN503 compound mutant mice. R555E had a replacement of Arg555 with Glu within the SH2 domain. ÎN503 contained an intact SH2 domain but lacked amino acids 1-503. Neuron-specific expression of recombinant SH2B1, but not R555E or ÎN503, corrected hyperphagia, obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in SH2B1 null mice. Neuron-specific expression of R555E in wild-type mice promoted obesity and insulin resistance. These results indicate that in addition to the SH2 domain, N-terminal regions of neuronal SH2B1 are also required for the maintenance of normal body weight and glucose metabolism. Additionally, mutations in the SH2 domain of SH2B1 may increase the susceptibility to obesity and type 2 diabetes in a dominant-negative manner.

However, the specific melanogenesis-related genes targeted by this miRNA had not been identified. In this study, we established a screening strategy involving three consecutive analytical approachesâanalysis of target genes of miR-125b, expression correlation analysis between each target gene and representative pigmentary genes, and functional analysis of candidate genes related to melanogenesisâto discover melanogenesis-related genes targeted by miR-125b. Through these analyses, we identified SRC homology 3 domain-binding protein 4 (SH3BP4) as a novel pigmentation gene. In addition, by combining bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrated that SH3BP4 is a direct target of miR-125b. Finally, we found that SH3BP4 is transcriptionally regulated by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor as its direct target. These findings provide important insights into the roles of miRNAs and their targets in melanogenesis.

SH2 domains bind to short phosphotyrosine-containing sequences in growth factor receptors and other phosphoproteins. SH3 domains bind to target proteins through sequences containing proline and hydrophobic amino acids. SH2 and SH3 domain containing proteins, such as Grb2 and phospholipase C gamma, utilize these modules in order to link receptor and cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases to the Ras signaling pathway and to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, respectively. The three-dimensional structures of several SH2 and SH3 domains have been determined by NMR and X-ray crystallography, and the molecular basis of their specificity is beginning to be unveiled.\n\nKnock-in mice harboring a Ca(2+) desensitizing mutation in cardiac troponin C develop early onset dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcConnell, Bradley K; Singh, Sonal; Fan, Qiying; Hernandez, Adriana; Portillo, Jesus P; Reiser, Peter J; Tikunova, Svetlana B\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe physiological consequences of aberrant Ca(2+) binding and exchange with cardiac myofilaments are not clearly understood. In order to examine the effect of decreasing Ca(2+) sensitivity of cTnC on cardiac function, we generated knock-in mice carrying a D73N mutation (not known to be associated with heart disease in human patients) in cTnC. The D73N mutation was engineered into the regulatory N-domain of cTnC in order to reduce Ca(2+) sensitivity of reconstituted thin filaments by increasing the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation. In addition, the D73N mutation drastically blunted the extent of Ca(2+) desensitization of reconstituted thin filaments induced by cTnI pseudo-phosphorylation. Compared to wild-type mice, heterozygous knock-in mice carrying the D73N mutation exhibited a substantially decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development in skinned ventricular trabeculae. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that median survival time for knock-in mice was 12 weeks. Echocardiographic analysis revealed that knock-in mice exhibited increased left ventricular dimensions with thinner walls. Echocardiographic analysis also revealed that measures of systolic function, such as ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), were dramatically reduced in knock-in mice. In addition, knock-in mice displayed electrophysiological abnormalities, namely prolonged QRS and QT intervals. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes isolated from knock-in mice did not respond to Î²-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, knock-in mice developed pathological features similar to those observed in human patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In conclusion, our results suggest that decreasing Ca(2+) sensitivity of the regulatory N-domain of cTnC is sufficient to trigger the development of DCM.\n\nAls2 mRNA splicing variants detected in KO mice rescue severe motor dysfunction phenotype in Als2 knock-down zebrafish.\n\nPubMed\n\nGros-Louis, Francois; Kriz, Jasna; Kabashi, Edor; McDearmid, Jonathan; Millecamps, StÃ©phanie; Urushitani, Makoto; Lin, Li; Dion, Patrick; Zhu, Qinzhang; Drapeau, Pierre; Julien, Jean-Pierre; Rouleau, Guy A\n\n2008-09-01\n\nRecessive ALS2 mutations are linked to three related but slightly different neurodegenerative disorders: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia and primary lateral sclerosis. To investigate the function of the ALS2 encoded protein, we generated Als2 knock-out (KO) mice and zAls2 knock-down zebrafish. The Als2(-/-) mice lacking exon 2 and part of exon 3 developed mild signs of neurodegeneration compatible with axonal transport deficiency. In contrast, zAls2 knock-down zebrafish had severe developmental abnormalities, swimming deficits and motor neuron perturbation. We identified, by RT-PCR, northern and western blotting novel Als2 transcripts in mouse central nervous system. These Als2 transcripts were present in Als2 null mice as well as in wild-type littermates and some rescued the zebrafish phenotype. Thus, we speculate that the newly identified Als2 mRNA species prevent the Als2 KO mice from developing severe neurodegenerative disease and might also regulate the severity of the motor neurons phenotype observed in ALS2 patients.\n\nGeneration and analysis of knock-in mice carrying pseudohypoaldosteronism type II-causing mutations in the cullin 3 gene.\n\nPubMed\n\nAraki, Yuya; Rai, Tatemitsu; Sohara, Eisei; Mori, Takayasu; Inoue, Yuichi; Isobe, Kiyoshi; Kikuchi, Eriko; Ohta, Akihito; Sasaki, Sei; Uchida, Shinichi\n\n2015-10-21\n\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) is a hereditary hypertensive disease caused by mutations in four different genes: with-no-lysine kinases (WNK) 1 and 4, Kelch-like family member 3 (KLHL3), and cullin 3 (Cul3). Cul3 and KLHL3 form an E3 ligase complex that ubiquitinates and reduces the expression level of WNK4. PHAII-causing mutations in WNK4 and KLHL3 impair WNK4 ubiquitination. However, the molecular pathogenesis of PHAII caused by Cul3 mutations is unclear. In cultured cells and human leukocytes, PHAII-causing Cul3 mutations result in the skipping of exon 9, producing mutant Cul3 protein lacking 57 amino acids. However, whether this phenomenon occurs in the kidneys and is responsible for the pathogenesis of PHAII in vivo is unknown. We generated knock-in mice carrying a mutation in the C-terminus of intron 8 of Cul3, c.1207-1G>A, which corresponds to a PHAII-causing mutation in the human Cul3 gene. Heterozygous Cul3(G(-1)A/+) knock-in mice did not exhibit PHAII phenotypes, and the skipping of exon 9 was not evident in their kidneys. However, the level of Cul3 mRNA expression in the kidneys of heterozygous knock-in mice was approximately half that of wild-type mice. Furthermore, homozygous knock-in mice were nonviable. It suggested that the mutant allele behaved like a knockout allele and did not produce Cul3 mRNA lacking exon 9. A reduction in Cul3 expression alone was not sufficient to develop PHAII in the knock-in mice. Our findings highlighted the pathogenic role of mutant Cul3 protein and provided insight to explain why PHAII-causing mutations in Cul3 cause kidney-predominant PHAII phenotypes. Â© 2015.

Recently, a mouse model of cherubism (Sh3bp2 KI/KI ) with a homozygous gain-of-function mutation in the SH3-domain binding protein 2 (SH3BP2) was shown to develop auto-inflammatory joint destruction. Here, we demonstrate that Sh3bp2 KI/KI mice also deficient in the FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-Fos) still exhibit noticeable bone erosion at the distal tibia even in the absence of osteoclasts at 12 weeks old. Levels of serum collagen I C-terminal telopeptide (ICTP), a marker of bone resorption generated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were elevated, whereas levels of serum cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), another resorption marker produced by cathepsin K, were not increased. Collagenolytic MMP levels were increased in the inflamed joints of the Sh3bp2 KI/KI mice deficient in c-Fos. Resorption pits contained a large number of F4/80+ macrophages and genetic depletion of macrophages rescued these erosive changes. Importantly, administration of NSC405020, an MMP14 inhibitor targeted to the hemopexin (PEX) domain, suppressed bone erosion in c-Fos-deficient Sh3bp2 KI/KI mice. After activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-dependent macrophages from c-Fos-deficient Sh3bp2 KI/KI mice expressed increased amounts of MMP14 compared with wild-type macrophages. Interestingly, receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-deficient Sh3bp2 KI/KI mice failed to show notable bone erosion, whereas c-Fos deletion did restore bone erosion to the RANKL-deficient Sh3bp2 KI/KI mice, suggesting that osteolytic transformation of macrophages requires both loss-of-function of c-Fos and gain-of-function of SH3BP2 in this model. These data provide the first genetic evidence that cells other than osteoclasts can cause focal bone destruction in\n\nAlterations in Ethanol-Induced Behaviors and Consumption in Knock-In Mice Expressing Ethanol-Resistant NMDA Receptors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nden Hartog, Carolina R.; Beckley, Jacob T.; Smothers, Thetford C.; Lench, Daniel H.; Holseberg, Zack L.; Fedarovich, Hleb; Gilstrap, Meghin J.; Homanics, Gregg E.; Woodward, John J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEthanol's action on the brain likely reflects altered function of key ion channels such as glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). In this study, we determined how expression of a mutant GluN1 subunit (F639A) that reduces ethanol inhibition of NMDARs affects ethanol-induced behaviors in mice. Mice homozygous for the F639A allele died prematurely while heterozygous knock-in mice grew and bred normally. Ethanol (44 mM; â¼0.2 g/dl) significantly inhibited NMDA-mediated EPSCs in wild-type mice but had little effect on responses in knock-in mice. Knock-in mice had normal expression of GluN1 and GluN2B protein across different brain regions and a small reduction in levels of GluN2A in medial prefrontal cortex. Ethanol (0.75â2.0 g/kg; IP) increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice but had no effect on knock-in mice while MK-801 enhanced activity to the same extent in both groups. Ethanol (2.0 g/kg) reduced rotarod performance equally in both groups but knock-in mice recovered faster following a higher dose (2.5 g/kg). In the elevated zero maze, knock-in mice had a blunted anxiolytic response to ethanol (1.25 g/kg) as compared to wild-type animals. No differences were noted between wild-type and knock-in mice for ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex, sleep time, hypothermia or ethanol metabolism. Knock-in mice consumed less ethanol than wild-type mice during daily limited-access sessions but drank more in an intermittent 24 h access paradigm with no change in taste reactivity or conditioned taste aversion. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that NMDA receptors are important in regulating a specific constellation of effects following exposure to ethanol.

To further investigate the role of MCs in EAE, we took advantage of a recently characterized model of MC deficiency, Kit(W-sh/W-sh). Surprisingly, we observed that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55)-induced chronic EAE was exacerbated in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) compared with Kit(+/+) mice. Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice showed more inflammatory foci in the central nervous system (CNS) and increased T-cell response against myelin. To understand whether the discrepant results obtained in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) and in Kit(W/W-v) mice were because of the different immunization protocols, we induced EAE in these two strains with varying doses of MOG(35-55) and adjuvants. Although Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice exhibited exacerbated EAE under all immunization protocols, Kit(W/W-v) mice were protected from EAE only when immunized with high, but not low, doses of antigen and adjuvants. Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice reconstituted systemically, but not in the CNS, with bone marrow-derived MCs still developed exacerbated EAE, indicating that protection from disease could be exerted by MCs mainly in the CNS, and/or by other cells possibly dysregulated in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice. In summary, these data suggest to reconsider MC contribution to EAE, taking into account the variables of using different experimental models and immunization protocols.\n\nChanges in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) dynamics induced by complexation with pharmacological inhibitors of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain dimerization.\n\nPubMed\n\nResetca, Diana; Haftchenary, Sina; Gunning, Patrick T; Wilson, Derek J\n\n2014-11-21\n\nThe activity of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is dysregulated in a number of hematological and solid malignancies. Development of pharmacological STAT3 Src homology 2 (SH2) domain interaction inhibitors holds great promise for cancer therapy, and a novel class of salicylic acid-based STAT3 dimerization inhibitors that includes orally bioavailable drug candidates has been recently developed. The compounds SF-1-066 and BP-1-102 are predicted to bind to the STAT3 SH2 domain. However, given the highly unstructured and dynamic nature of the SH2 domain, experimental confirmation of this prediction was elusive. We have interrogated the protein-ligand interaction of STAT3 with these small molecule inhibitors by means of time-resolved electrospray ionization hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Analysis of site-specific evolution of deuterium uptake induced by the complexation of STAT3 with SF-1-066 or BP-1-102 under physiological conditions enabled the mapping of the in silico predicted inhibitor binding site to the STAT3 SH2 domain. The binding of both inhibitors to the SH2 domain resulted in significant local decreases in dynamics, consistent with solvent exclusion at the inhibitor binding site and increased rigidity of the inhibitor-complexed SH2 domain. Interestingly, inhibitor binding induced hot spots of allosteric perturbations outside of the SH2 domain, manifesting mainly as increased deuterium uptake, in regions of STAT3 important for DNA binding and nuclear localization.

To determine how additional interactions with surrounding structure affects local protein dynamics, we have used hydrogen exchange and mass spectrometry to investigate the SH2 and SH3 domains of the protein tyrosine kinase Hck. Exchange rates of isolated Hck SH3 and SH2 domains were compared with rates for the same domains when part of a larger SH(3+2) construct. Increased deuterium incorporation was observed for the SH3 domain in the joint construct, particularly near the SH2 interface and the short sequence that connects SH3 to SH2, implying greater flexibility of SH3 when it is part of SH(3+2). Slow cooperative unfolding of the SH3 domain occurred at the same rate in isolated SH3 as in the SH(3+2) construct, suggesting a functional significance for this unfolding. The SH2 domain displayed relatively smaller changes in flexibility when part of the SH(3+2) construct. These results suggest that the domains influence each other. Further, our results imply a link between functional regulation and structural dynamics of SH3 and SH2 domains.

Knock-in mice that express human thrombomodulin from the murine thrombomodulin gene locus were generated. Compared with wild-type mice, human thrombomodulin knock-in mice exhibited decreased protein C activation in the aorta (P<0.01) and lung (P<0.001). Activation of endogenous protein C following infusion of thrombin was decreased by 90% in knock-in mice compared with wild-type mice (P<0.05). Carotid artery thrombosis induced by photochemical injury occurred more rapidly in knock-in mice (12Â±3 minutes) than in wild-type mice (31Â±6 minutes; P<0.05). No differences in serum cytokine levels were detected between knock-in and wild-type mice after injection of endotoxin. When crossed with apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and fed a Western diet, knock-in mice had a further decrease in protein C activation but did not exhibit increased atherosclerosis. Expression of human thrombomodulin in place of murine thrombomodulin produces viable mice with a prothrombotic phenotype but unaltered responses to systemic inflammatory or atherogenic stimuli. This humanized animal model will be useful for investigating the function of human thrombomodulin under pathophysiological conditions in vivo.\n\nImpaired Dendritic Development and Memory in Sorbs2 Knock-Out Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Qiangge; Gao, Xian; Li, Chenchen; Feliciano, Catia; Wang, Dongqing; Zhou, Dingxi; Mei, Yuan; Monteiro, Patricia; Anand, Michelle; Itohara, Shigeyoshi; Dong, Xiaowei; Fu, Zhanyan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntellectual disability is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. Both environmental insults and genetic defects contribute to the etiology of intellectual disability. Copy number variations of SORBS2 have been linked to intellectual disability.

The SORBS2 gene encodes ArgBP2 (Arg/c-Abl kinase binding protein 2) protein in non-neuronal tissues and is alternatively spliced in the brain to encode nArgBP2 protein.

In the mouse brain, nArgBP2 was highly expressed in the cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, and enriched in the outer one-third of the molecular layer in dentate gyrus. Genetic deletion of Sorbs2 in mice led to reduced dendritic complexity and decreased frequency of AMPAR-miniature spontaneous EPSCs in dentate gyrus granule cells. Behavioral characterization revealed that Sorbs2 deletion led to a reduced acoustic startle response, and defective long-term object recognition memory and contextual fear memory. Together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, an important role for nArgBP2 in neuronal dendritic development and excitatory synaptic transmission, which may thus inform exploration of neurobiological basis of SORBS2 deficiency in intellectual disability.

The neuroprotective effect of Humanin against Alzheimer disease (AD)-related death is mediated by the binding of Humanin to its heterotrimeric Humanin receptor composed of ciliary neurotrophic receptor Î±, WSX-1, and gp130, as well as the activation of intracellular signaling pathways including a JAK2 and STAT3 signaling axis. Despite the elucidation of the signaling pathways by which Humanin mediates its neuroprotection, the transcriptional targets of Humanin that behaves as effectors of Humanin remains undefined. In the present study, Humanin increased the mRNA and protein expression of SH3 domain-binding protein 5 (SH3BP5), which has been known to be a JNK interactor, in neuronal cells. Similar to Humanin treatment, overexpression of SH3BP5 inhibited AD-related neuronal death, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous SH3BP5 expression attenuated the neuroprotective effect of Humanin. These results indicate that SH3BP5 is a downstream effector of Humanin. Furthermore, biochemical analysis has revealed that SH3BP5 binds to JNK and directly inhibits JNK through its two putative mitogen-activated protein kinase interaction motifs (KIMs).

Recently, a study using the mouse model of cherubism, a dominant inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding 3BP2, showed that 3BP2 is involved in the regulation of phagocytosis mediated by Fc receptor for IgG (FcÎ³R) in macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying 3BP2-mediated regulation of phagocytosis and the physiological relevance of 3BP2 tyrosine phosphorylation remains elusive. In this study, we established various gene knockout U937 cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that 3BP2 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated by Syk in response to cross-linking of FcÎ³RI. Depletion of 3BP2 caused significant reduction in the Fc receptor Î³ chain (FcRÎ³)-mediated phagocytosis in addition to the FcÎ³RI-mediated induction of chemokine mRNA for IL-8, CCL3L3 and CCL4L2. Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 was required for overcoming these defects. Finally, we found that the PH and SH2 domains play important roles on FcÎ³RI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 in HL-60 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 is required for optimal FcRÎ³-mediated phagocytosis and chemokine expression.\n\nProportionate Dwarfism in Mice Lacking Heterochromatin Protein 1 Binding Protein 3 (HP1BP3) Is Associated With Alterations in the Endocrine IGF-1 Pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarfinkel, Benjamin P; Arad, Shiri; Le, Phuong T; Bustin, Michael; Rosen, Clifford J; Gabet, Yankel; Orly, Joseph\n\n2015-12-01\n\nHeterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3) is a recently described histone H1-related protein with roles in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. To explore the potential physiological role of HP1BP3, we have previously described an Hp1bp3(-/-) mouse model with reduced postnatal viability and growth. We now find that these mice are proportionate dwarfs, with reduction in body weight, body length, and organ weight. In addition to their small size, microcomputed tomography analysis showed that Hp1bp3(-/-) mice present a dramatic impairment of their bone development and structure. By 3 weeks of age, mice of both sexes have severely impaired cortical and trabecular bone, and these defects persist into adulthood and beyond. Primary cultures of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts from Hp1bp3(-/-) bone marrow and splenocytes, respectively, showed normal differentiation and function, strongly suggesting that the impaired bone accrual is due to noncell autonomous systemic cues in vivo. One major endocrine pathway regulating both body growth and bone acquisition is the IGF regulatory system, composed of IGF-1, the IGF receptors, and the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). At 3 weeks of age, Hp1bp3(-/-) mice exhibited a 60% reduction in circulating IGF-1 and a 4-fold increase in the levels of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2. These alterations were reflected in similar changes in the hepatic transcripts of the Igf1, Igfbp1, and Igfbp2 genes. Collectively, these results suggest that HP1BP3 plays a key role in normal growth and bone development by regulating transcription of endocrine IGF-1 components.\n\nEnhancement of B-cell receptor signaling by a point mutation of adaptor protein 3BP2 identified in human inherited disease cherubism.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgi, Kazuhiro; Nakashima, Kenji; Chihara, Kazuyasu; Takeuchi, Kenji; Horiguchi, Tomoko; Fujieda, Shigeharu; Sada, Kiyonao\n\n2011-09-01\n\nTyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor protein c-Abl-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2, also referred to SH3BP2) positively regulates the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated signal transduction, leading to the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Here we showed the effect of the proline to arginine substitution of 3BP2 in which is the most common mutation in patients with cherubism (P418R) on B-cell receptor signaling. Comparing to the wild type, overexpression of the mutant form of 3BP2 (3BP2-P416R, corresponding to P418R in human protein) enhanced BCR-mediated activation of NFAT. 3BP2-P416R increased the signaling complex formation with Syk, phospholipase C-Î³2 (PLC-Î³2), and Vav1. In contrast, 3BP2-P416R could not change the association with the negative regulator 14-3-3. Loss of the association mutant that was incapable to associate with 14-3-3 could not mimic BCR-mediated NFAT activation in Syk-deficient cells. Moreover, BCR-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was not affected by P416R mutation. These results showed that P416R mutation of 3BP2 causes the gain of function in B cells by increasing the interaction with specific signaling molecules. Â© 2011 The Authors.

The main clinical findings in this disease are ataxia, hyposmia and cerebellar atrophy. Mice in which Elovl5 has been knocked out represent a model of the loss of function hypothesis of SCA38. In agreement with this hypothesis, Elovl5 knock out mice reproduced the main symptoms of patients, motor deficits at the beam balance test and hyposmia. The cerebellar cortex of Elovl5 knock out mice showed a reduction of thickness of the molecular layer, already detectable at 6 months of age, confirmed at 12 and 18 months. The total perimeter length of the Purkinje cell (PC) layer was also reduced in Elovl5 knock out mice. Since Elovl5 transcripts are expressed by PCs, whose dendrites are a major component of the molecular layer, we hypothesized that an alteration of their dendrites might be responsible for the reduced thickness of this layer. Reconstruction of the dendritic tree of biocytin-filled PCs, followed by Sholl analysis, showed that the distribution of distal dendrites was significantly reduced in Elovl5 knock out mice. Dendritic spine density was conserved. These results suggest that Elovl5 knock out mice recapitulate SCA38 symptoms and that their cerebellar atrophy is due, at least in part, to a reduced extension of PC dendritic arborization.\n\nEffects of SIRT1 gene knock-out via activation of SREBP2 protein-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling on osteoarthritis in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Fei; Zeng, Hui; Lei, Ming; Xiao, De-Ming; Li, Wei; Yuan, Hao; Lin, Jian-Jing\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThis study investigated the effects of SIRT1 gene knock-out on osteoarthritis in mice, and the possible roles of SREBP2 protein and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the effects. Mice were randomly divided into a normal group and a SIRT1 gene knock-out group (6 mice in each group). In these groups, one side of the knee anterior cruciate ligament was traversed, and the ipsilateral medial meniscus was cut to establish an osteoarthritis model of knee joint. The countralateral synovial bursa was cut out, serving as controls. The knee joint specimens were then divided into four groups: SIRT1 +/+ control group (group A, n=6); SIRT1 +/+ osteoarthritis group (group B, n=6); SIRT1 -/- control group (group C, n=6); SIRT1 -/- osteoarthritis group (group D, n=6). HE staining, Masson staining, Safranin O-Fast Green staining and Van Gieson staining were used to observe the morphological changes in the articular cartilage of the knee. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to detect the expression of SIRT1, SREBP2, VEGF, AKT, HMGCR and type II collagen proteins. SA-Î²-gal staining was utilized to evaluate chondrocyte aging. The results showed clear knee joint cartilage destruction and degeneration in the SIRT1 -/- osteoarthritis group. The tidal line was twisted and displaced anteriorly. Type II collagen was destroyed and distributed unevenly. Compared with the SIRT1 +/+ osteoarthritis group and SIRT1 -/- control group, SIRT1 protein expression was not obviously changed in the SIRT1 -/- osteoarthritis group (P>0.05), while the expression levels of the SREBP2, VEGF and HMGCR proteins were significantly increased (P<0.05) and the levels of AKT and type II collagen proteins were significantly decreased (P<0.05). SIRT1 gene knock-out may aggravate cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis by activating the SREBP2 protein-mediated PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, suggesting that SIRT1 gene may play a protective role against osteoarthritis.\n\nProportionate Dwarfism in Mice Lacking Heterochromatin Protein 1 Binding Protein 3 (HP1BP3) Is Associated With Alterations in the Endocrine IGF-1 Pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArad, Shiri; Le, Phuong T.; Bustin, Michael; Rosen, Clifford J.; Gabet, Yankel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHeterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3) is a recently described histone H1-related protein with roles in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation.

To investigate the role of BDNF in the extinction of amygdala-dependent cued fear memories, we analyzed fear extinction learning in heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice, which possess a reduction of endogenous BDNF protein levels to ~50% of wild-type animals. Since BDNF expression has been shown to decline with aging of animals, we tested the performance in extinction learning of these mice at 2 months (young adults) and 7 months (older adults) of age. The present study shows that older adult heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice, which have a chronic 50% lack of BDNF, also possess a deficit in the acquisition of extinction memory, while extinction learning remains unaffected in young adult heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice. This deficit in extinction learning is accompanied by a reduction of BDNF protein in the hippocampus, amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Transfected stem cells are then transplanted into irradiated wild-type mice. After engraftment of stem cells, the transplanted mice have two sets of circulating neutrophils. One set has a gene of interest knocked down while the other set has full complement of expressed genes. This efficient technique provides a unique way to directly compare the response of neutrophils with a knocked-down gene to that of neutrophils with the full complement of expressed genes in the same environment.\n\nGenetic disruption of the sh3pxd2a gene reveals an essential role in mouse development and the existence of a novel isoform of tks5.\n\nPubMed\n\nCejudo-Martin, Pilar; Yuen, Angela; Vlahovich, Nicole; Lock, Peter; Courtneidge, Sara A; DÃ­az, BegoÃ±a\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTks5 is a scaffold protein and Src substrate involved in cell migration and matrix degradation through its essential role in invadosome formation and function. We have previously described that Tks5 is fundamental for zebrafish neural crest cell migration in vivo. In the present study, we sought to investigate the function of Tks5 in mammalian development by analyzing mice mutant for sh3pxd2a, the gene encoding Tks5. Homozygous disruption of the sh3pxd2a gene by gene-trapping in mouse resulted in neonatal death and the presence of a complete cleft of the secondary palate. Interestingly, embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous gene-trap sh3pxd2a mice lacked only the highest molecular weight band of the characteristic Tks5 triplet observed in protein extracts, leaving the lower molecular weight bands unaffected. This finding, together with the existence of two human Expressed Sequence Tags lacking the first 5 exons of SH3PXD2A, made us hypothesize about the presence of a second alternative transcription start site located in intron V. We performed 5'RACE on mouse fibroblasts and isolated a new transcript of the sh3pxd2a gene encoding a novel Tks5 isoform, that we named Tks5Î². This novel isoform diverges from the long form of Tks5 in that it lacks the PX-domain, which confers affinity for phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate. Instead, Tks5Î² has a short unique amino terminal sequence encoded by the newly discovered exon 6Î²; this exon includes a start codon located 29 bp from the 5'-end of exon 6. Tks5Î² mRNA is expressed in MEFs and all mouse adult tissues analyzed. Tks5Î² is a substrate for the Src tyrosine kinase and its expression is regulated through the proteasome degradation pathway. Together, these findings indicate the essentiality of the larger Tks5 isoform for correct mammalian development and the transcriptional complexity of the sh3pxd2a gene.\n\nGenetic Disruption of the Sh3pxd2a Gene Reveals an Essential Role in Mouse Development and the Existence of a Novel Isoform of Tks5\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCejudo-Martin, Pilar; Yuen, Angela; Vlahovich, Nicole; Lock, Peter; Courtneidge, Sara A.; DÃ­az, BegoÃ±a\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTks5 is a scaffold protein and Src substrate involved in cell migration and matrix degradation through its essential role in invadosome formation and function.

The c-Kit loss-of-function mutations in WBB6F1/J-Kit(W/W-v) mice result in low bone mass. However, these mice are sterile and it is unclear whether the observed skeletal phenotype is secondary to a sex hormone deficiency. In contrast, C57BL/6J-Kit(W-sh)/(W-sh) (W(sh)/W(sh)) mice, which carry an inversion mutation affecting the transcriptional regulatory elements of the c-Kit gene, are fertile. Here, we showed that W(sh)/W(sh) mice exhibited osteopenia with elevated bone resorption and bone formation at 6- and 9-week-old. The c-Kit W(sh) mutation increased osteoclast differentiation, the number of committed osteoprogenitors, alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. c-Kit was expressed in both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and c-Kit expression was decreased in W(sh)/W(sh)osteoclasts, but not osteoblasts, suggesting an indirect effect of c-Kit on bone formation. Furthermore, the osteoclast-derived coupling factor Wnt10b mRNA was increased in W(sh)/W(sh) osteoclasts. Conditioned medium from W(sh)/W(sh) osteoclasts had elevated Wnt10b protein levels and induced increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization in osteoblast cultures. Antagonizing Wnt10b signaling with DKK1 or Wnt10b antibody inhibited these effects. Our data suggest that c-Kit negatively regulates bone turnover, and disrupted c-Kit signaling couples increased bone resorption with bone formation through osteoclast-derived Wnt 10 b.\n\nEnhanced serotonin response in the hippocampus of Galphaz protein knock-out mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nOleskevich, Sharon; Leck, Kwong-Joo; Matthaei, Klaus; Hendry, Ian A\n\n2005-06-21\n\nThe serotonin-1A [5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5HT1A)] receptor is important for emotional and homeostatic processes in the central nervous system. In the hippocampus, the 5HT1A receptor couples to inhibitory Gi/o proteins to decrease pyramidal cell excitability. Here we investigate the 5HT1A receptor in a mouse deficient in the alpha-subunit of Gz protein (Galphaz knock-out). Behavioural tests showed heightened anxiety and depression-like behaviour in the Galphaz knock-out mice. Whole-cell recording in CA1 pyramidal neurons showed a significantly greater 5HT1A receptor-mediated potassium current in Galphaz knock-out mice. The effect was independent of 5HT4 receptors as the slow after-hyperpolarization was unaffected and a slow depolarization was absent in the Galphaz knock-out mice. Other receptors linked to Gi/o proteins [gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABAB), adenosine A1 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors] were not affected in Galphaz knock-out mice. These results suggest that the 5HT1A receptor may be linked to Galphaz protein, as reported previously in cell culture but shown here in an intact neural network.\n\nSynaptic function is modulated by LRRK2 and glutamate release is increased in cortical neurons of G2019S LRRK2 knock-in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeccano-Kelly, Dayne A; Kuhlmann, Naila; Tatarnikov, Igor; Volta, Mattia; Munsie, Lise N; Chou, Patrick; Cao, Li-Ping; Han, Heather; Tapia, Lucia; Farrer, Matthew J; Milnerwood, Austen J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMutations in Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase-2 (LRRK2) result in familial Parkinson's disease and the G2019S mutation alone accounts for up to 30% in some ethnicities. Despite this, the function of LRRK2 is largely undetermined although evidence suggests roles in phosphorylation, protein interactions, autophagy and endocytosis. Emerging reports link loss of LRRK2 to altered synaptic transmission, but the effects of the G2019S mutation upon synaptic release in mammalian neurons are unknown. To assess wild type and mutant LRRK2 in established neuronal networks, we conducted immunocytochemical, electrophysiological and biochemical characterization of >3 week old cortical cultures of LRRK2 knock-out, wild-type overexpressing and G2019S knock-in mice. Synaptic release and synapse numbers were grossly normal in LRRK2 knock-out cells, but discretely reduced glutamatergic activity and reduced synaptic protein levels were observed. Conversely, synapse density was modestly but significantly increased in wild-type LRRK2 overexpressing cultures although event frequency was not. In knock-in cultures, glutamate release was markedly elevated, in the absence of any change to synapse density, indicating that physiological levels of G2019S LRRK2 elevate probability of release. Several pre-synaptic regulatory proteins shown by others to interact with LRRK2 were expressed at normal levels in knock-in cultures; however, synapsin 1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced. Thus, perturbations to the pre-synaptic release machinery and elevated synaptic transmission are early neuronal effects of LRRK2 G2019S. Furthermore, the comparison of knock-in and overexpressing cultures suggests that one copy of the G2019S mutation has a more pronounced effect than an ~3-fold increase in LRRK2 protein. Mutant-induced increases in transmission may convey additional stressors to neuronal physiology that may eventually contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.\n\nChemical shift assignments of the partially deuterated Fyn SH2-SH3 domain.\n\nPubMed\n\nKieken, Fabien; Loth, Karine; van Nuland, Nico; Tompa, Peter; Lenaerts, Tom\n\n2018-04-01\n\nSrc Homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) are two key protein interaction modules involved in regulating the activity of many proteins such as tyrosine kinases and phosphatases by respective recognition of phosphotyrosine and proline-rich regions. In the Src family kinases, the inactive state of the protein is the direct result of the interaction of the SH2 and the SH3 domain with intra-molecular regions, leading to a closed structure incompetent with substrate modification. Here, we report the 1 H, 15 N and 13 C backbone- and side-chain chemical shift assignments of the partially deuterated Fyn SH3-SH2 domain and structural differences between tandem and single domains. The BMRB accession number is 27165.\n\nCrystal structure of the Src family kinase Hck SH3-SH2 linker regulatory region supports an SH3-dominant activation mechanism.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlvarado, John J; Betts, Laurie; Moroco, Jamie A; Smithgall, Thomas E; Yeh, Joanne I\n\n2010-11-12\n\nMost mammalian cell types depend on multiple Src family kinases (SFKs) to regulate diverse signaling pathways. Strict control of SFK activity is essential for normal cellular function, and loss of kinase regulation contributes to several forms of cancer and other diseases. Previous x-ray crystal structures of the SFKs c-Src and Hck revealed that intramolecular association of their Src homology (SH) 3 domains and SH2 kinase linker regions has a key role in down-regulation of kinase activity. However, the amino acid sequence of the Hck linker represents a suboptimal ligand for the isolated SH3 domain, suggesting that it may form the polyproline type II helical conformation required for SH3 docking only in the context of the intact structure. To test this hypothesis directly, we determined the crystal structure of a truncated Hck protein consisting of the SH2 and SH3 domains plus the linker. Despite the absence of the kinase domain, the structures and relative orientations of the SH2 and SH3 domains in this shorter protein were very similar to those observed in near full-length, down-regulated Hck. However, the SH2 kinase linker adopted a modified topology and failed to engage the SH3 domain. This new structure supports the idea that these noncatalytic regions work together as a \"conformational switch\" that modulates kinase activity in a manner unique to the SH3 domain and linker topologies present in the intact Hck protein. Our results also provide fresh structural insight into the facile induction of Hck activity by HIV-1 Nef and other Hck SH3 domain binding proteins and implicate the existence of innate conformational states unique to individual Src family members that \"fine-tune\" their sensitivities to activation by SH3-based ligands.\n\nProteome and behavioral alterations in phosphorylation-deficient mutant Collapsin Response Mediator Protein2 knock-in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Haruko; Takahashi-Jitsuki, Aoi; Makihara, Hiroko; Asano, Tetsuya; Kimura, Yayoi; Nakabayashi, Jun; Yamashita, Naoya; Kawamoto, Yuko; Nakamura, Fumio; Ohshima, Toshio; Hirano, Hisashi; Tanaka, Fumiaki; Goshima, Yoshio\n\n2018-05-11\n\nCRMP2, alternatively designated as DPYSL2, was the first CRMP family member to be identified as an intracellular molecule mediating the signaling of the axon guidance molecule Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). In Sema3A signaling, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) primarily phosphorylates CRMP2 at Ser522. Glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) subsequently phosphorylates the residues of Thr509 and Thr514 of CRMP2. Previous studies showed that CRMP2 is involved in pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, hyper-phosphorylated forms of CRMP2 are accumulated in the paired helical filaments. To get insight into the possible involvement of the phosphorylation of CRMP2 in pathogenesis of neurological disorders, we previously created CRMP2 S522A knock-in (crmp2 ki/ki ) mice and demonstrated that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 is involved in normal dendrite patterning in cortical neurons. However, the behavioral impact and in vivo signaling network of the CRMP2 phosphorylation are not fully understood. In this study, we performed behavioral and proteomics analysis of crmp2 ki/ki mice. The crmp2 ki/ki mice appeared healthy and showed no obvious differences in physical characteristics compared to wild-type mice, but they showed impaired emotional behavior, reduced sociality, and low sensitivity to pain stimulation. Through mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we found that 59 proteins were increased and 77 proteins were decreased in the prefrontal cortex of crmp2 ki/ki mice. Notably, CRMP3, CRMP4, and CRMP5, the other CRMP family proteins, were increased in crmp2 ki/ki mice. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses identified 14 pathways in increased total proteins and 13 pathways in decreased total proteins which are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. We also detected 20 pathways in increased phosphopeptides and 16 pathways in decreased\n\nRoles of the SH2 and SH3 domains in the regulation of neuronal Src kinase functions.\n\nPubMed\n\nGroveman, Bradley R; Xue, Sheng; Marin, Vedrana; Xu, Jindong; Ali, Mohammad K; Bienkiewicz, Ewa A; Yu, Xian-Min\n\n2011-02-01\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that intra-domain interactions between Src family kinases (SFKs), stabilized by binding of the phosphorylated C-terminus to the SH2 domain and/or binding of the SH2 kinase linker to the SH3 domain, lock the molecules in a closed conformation, disrupt the kinase active site, and inactivate SFKs. Here we report that the up-regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) induced by expression of constitutively active neuronal Src (n-Src), in which the C-terminus tyrosine is mutated to phenylalanine (n-Src/Y535F), is significantly reduced by dysfunctions of the SH2 and/or SH3 domains of the protein. Furthermore, we found that dysfunctions of SH2 and/or SH3 domains reduce auto-phosphorylation of the kinase activation loop, depress kinase activity, and decrease NMDAR phosphorylation. The SH2 domain plays a greater regulatory role than the SH3 domain. Our data also show that n-Src binds directly to the C-terminus of the NMDAR NR2A subunit in vitro, with a K(D) of 108.2 Â± 13.3 nM. This binding is not Src kinase activity-dependent, and dysfunctions of the SH2 and/or SH3 domains do not significantly affect the binding. These data indicate that the SH2 and SH3 domains may function to promote the catalytic activity of active n-Src, which is important in the regulation of NMDAR functions.

The SH2 domains of these signaling proteins bind tyrosine phosphorylated polypeptides, implicated in normal signaling and cellular transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation acts as a switch to induce the binding of SH2 domains, thereby mediating the formation of heteromeric protein complexes at or near the plasma membrane. The formation of these complexes is likely to control the activation of signal transduction pathways by tyrosine kinases. The SH3 domain is a distinct motif that, together with SH2, may modulate interactions with the cytoskeleton and membrane. Some signaling and transforming proteins contain SH2 and SH3 domains unattached to any known catalytic element. These noncatalytic proteins may serve as adaptors to link tyrosine kinases to specific target proteins. These observations suggest that SH2 and SH3 domains participate in the control of intracellular responses to growth factor stimulation.\n\nE4bp4 regulates carboxylesterase 2 enzymes through repression of the nuclear receptor Rev-erbÎ± in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Mengjing; Zhang, Tianpeng; Yu, Fangjun; Guo, Lianxia; Wu, Baojian\n\n2018-06-01\n\nCarboxylesterases (CES) are a family of phase I enzymes that play an important role in xenobiotic clearance and lipid metabolism. Here, we investigate a potential role of E4 promoter-binding protein 4 (E4bp4) in regulation of Ces and CPT-11 (irinotecan, a first-line drug for treating colorectal cancer) pharmacokinetics in mice. Mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cells were transfected with Rev-erbÎ± expression plasmid or siRNA targeting E4bp4. The relative mRNA and protein levels of Ces enzymes in the cells or the livers of wild-type and E4bp4-deficient (E4bp4 -/- ) mice were determined by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Transcriptional regulation of Ces by E4bp4/Rev-erbÎ± were investigated using luciferase reporter, mobility shift, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with wild-type and E4bp4 -/- mice after intraperitoneal injection of CPT-11. E4bp4 ablation down-regulated an array of hepatic Ces genes in mice. E4bp4 -/- mice also showed reduced Ces-mediated metabolism and elevated systemic exposure of CPT-11, a well-known Ces substrate. Consistently, E4bp4 knockdown reduced the expression of Ces genes (Ces2b, Ces2e and Ces2f) in Hepa-1c1c7 cells. Furthermore, Rev-erbÎ± repressed the transcription of Ces2b, whereas E4bp4 antagonized this repressive action. Co-IP experiment confirmed a direct interaction between E4bp4 and Rev-erbÎ±. Through a combination of promoter analysis and mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that Rev-erbÎ± trans-repressed Ces (Ces2b) through its specific binding to the -767 to-754â¯bp promoter region. In conclusion, E4bp4 regulates Ces enzymes through inhibition of the transrepression activity of Rev-erbÎ±, thereby impacting the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of Ces substrates.

The regulatory subunit consists of an SH3 domain and two SH2 domains. An oncogenic form of p85Î± named p65 lacking the c-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) has been cloned from an irradiation-induced murine thymic lymphoma and transgenic mice expressing p65 in T lymphocytes develop a lymphoproliferative disorder. We have recently detected a c-terminal truncated form of p85Î± named p76Î± in a human lymphoma cell line lacking most of the cSH2 domain due to a frame shift mutation. Here, we report that the deletion of the cSH2 domain enhances the activating effects of the n-terminal SH2 domain (nSH2) mutants K379E and R340E on the PI3K/Akt pathway and micro tumor formation in a focus assay. Further analysis revealed that this transforming effect is mediated by activation of the catalytic PI3K isoform p110Î± and downstream signaling through mTOR. Our data further support a mechanistic model in which mutations of the cSH2 domain of p85Î± can abrogate its negative regulatory function on PI3K activity via the nSH2 domain of p85Î±.

SLAP and SLAP2 consist of adjacent SH3 and SH2 domains that are most similar in sequence to Src family kinases (SFKs). Notably, the SH3-SH2 connector sequence is significantly shorter in SLAP/SLAP2 than in SFKs. To understand the structural implication of a short SH3-SH2 connector sequence, we solved the crystal structure of a protein encompassing the SH3 domain, SH3-SH2 connector, and SH2 domain of SLAP2 (SLAP2-32). While both domains adopt typical folds, the short SH3-SH2 connector places them in close association. Strand Î²e of the SH3 domain interacts with strand Î²A of the SH2 domain, resulting in the formation of a continuous Î² sheet that spans the length of the protein. Disruption of the SH3/SH2 interface through mutagenesis decreases SLAP-32 stability in vitro, consistent with inter-domain binding being an important component of SLAP2 structure and function. The canonical peptide binding pockets of the SH3 and SH2 domains are fully accessible, in contrast to other protein structures that display direct interaction between SH3 and SH2 domains, in which either peptide binding surface is obstructed by the interaction. Our results reveal potential sites of novel interaction for SH3 and SH2 domains, and illustrate the adaptability of SH2 and SH3 domains in mediating interactions. As well, our results suggest that the SH3 and SH2 domains of SLAP2 function interdependently, with implications on their mode of substrate binding.

In this regard, ShcA possesses both a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and Src homology 2 domain (SH2), which bind phosphotyrosine residues in a sequence-specific manner. Although the majority of receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in breast cancer cells bind the PTB domain, very little is known regarding the biological importance of SH2-driven ShcA signaling during mammary tumorigenesis. To address this, we employed transgenic mice expressing a mutant ShcA allele harboring a non-functional SH2 domain (ShcR397K) under the transcriptional control of the endogenous ShcA promoter. Using transplantation approaches, we demonstrate that SH2-dependent ShcA signaling within the mammary epithelial compartment is essential for breast tumor outgrowth, survival and the development of lung metastases. We further show that the ShcA SH2 domain activates the AKT pathway, potentially through a novel SH2-mediated complex between ShcA, 14-3-3Î¶ and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3') kinase. This study is the first to demonstrate that the SH2 domain of ShcA is critical for tumor survival during mammary tumorigenesis.\n\nGlutaminyl Cyclase Knock-out Mice Exhibit Slight Hypothyroidism but No Hypogonadism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchilling, Stephan; Kohlmann, Stephanie; BÃ¤uscher, Christoph; Sedlmeier, Reinhard; Koch, Birgit; Eichentopf, Rico; Becker, Andreas; Cynis, Holger; Hoffmann, Torsten; Berg, Sabine; Freyse, Ernst-Joachim; von HÃ¶rsten, Stephan; Rossner, Steffen; Graubner, Sigrid; Demuth, Hans-Ulrich\n\n2011-01-01\n\nGlutaminyl cyclases (QCs) catalyze the formation of pyroglutamate (pGlu) residues at the N terminus of peptides and proteins. Hypothalamic pGlu hormones, such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone are essential for regulation of metabolism and fertility in the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes, respectively. Here, we analyzed the consequences of constitutive genetic QC ablation on endocrine functions and on the behavior of adult mice. Adult homozygous QC knock-out mice are fertile and behave indistinguishably from wild type mice in tests of motor function, cognition, general activity, and ingestion behavior. The QC knock-out results in a dramatic drop of enzyme activity in the brain, especially in hypothalamus and in plasma. Other peripheral organs like liver and spleen still contain QC activity, which is most likely caused by its homolog isoQC. The serum gonadotropin-releasing hormone, TSH, and testosterone concentrations were not changed by QC depletion. The serum thyroxine was decreased by 24% in homozygous QC knock-out animals, suggesting a mild hypothyroidism. QC knock-out mice were indistinguishable from wild type with regard to blood glucose and glucose tolerance, thus differing from reports of thyrotropin-releasing hormone knock-out mice significantly. The results suggest a significant formation of the hypothalamic pGlu hormones by alternative mechanisms, like spontaneous cyclization or conversion by isoQC. The different effects of QC depletion on the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes might indicate slightly different modes of substrate conversion of both enzymes. The absence of significant abnormalities in QC knock-out mice suggests the presence of a therapeutic window for suppression of QC activity in current drug development.

Here, we report the identification of germline homozygous SH2B3 mutations in 2 siblings affected with developmental delay and autoimmunity, one in whom B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed. Mechanistically, loss of SH2B3 increases Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, promotes lymphoid cell proliferation, and accelerates leukemia development in a mouse model of NOTCH1-induced ALL. Moreover, extended mutation analysis showed homozygous somatic mutations in SH2B3 in 2 of 167 ALLs analyzed. Overall, these results demonstrate a Knudson tumor suppressor role for SH2B3 in the pathogenesis of ALL and highlight a possible link between genetic predisposition factors in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and leukemogenesis.\n\nNeuronal SH2B1 is essential for controlling energy and glucose homeostasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRen, Decheng; Zhou, Yingjiang; Morris, David; Li, Minghua; Li, Zhiqin; Rui, Liangyou\n\n2007-02-01\n\nSH2B1 (previously named SH2-B), a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, binds via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain to a variety of protein tyrosine kinases, including JAK2 and the insulin receptor. SH2B1-deficient mice are obese and diabetic. Here we demonstrated that multiple isoforms of SH2B1 (alpha, beta, gamma, and/or delta) were expressed in numerous tissues, including the brain, hypothalamus, liver, muscle, adipose tissue, heart, and pancreas. Rat SH2B1beta was specifically expressed in neural tissue in SH2B1-transgenic (SH2B1(Tg)) mice. SH2B1(Tg) mice were crossed with SH2B1-knockout (SH2B1(KO)) mice to generate SH2B1(TgKO) mice expressing SH2B1 only in neural tissue but not in other tissues. Systemic deletion of the SH2B1 gene resulted in metabolic disorders in SH2B1(KO) mice, including hyperlipidemia, leptin resistance, hyperphagia, obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Neuron-specific restoration of SH2B1beta not only corrected the metabolic disorders in SH2B1(TgKO) mice, but also improved JAK2-mediated leptin signaling and leptin regulation of orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus. Moreover, neuron-specific overexpression of SH2B1 dose-dependently protected against high-fat diet-induced leptin resistance and obesity. These observations suggest that neuronal SH2B1 regulates energy balance, body weight, peripheral insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis at least in part by enhancing hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.\n\nThe Abl SH2-kinase linker naturally adopts a conformation competent for SH3 domain binding.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Shugui; Brier, SÃ©bastien; Smithgall, Thomas E; Engen, John R\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThe core of the Abelson tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) is structurally similar to Src-family kinases where SH3 and SH2 domains pack against the backside of the kinase domain in the down-regulated conformation. Both kinase families depend upon intramolecular association of SH3 with the linker joining the SH2 and kinase domains for suppression of kinase activity. Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HX) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to probe intramolecular interaction of the c-Abl SH3 domain with the linker in recombinant constructs lacking the kinase domain. Under physiological conditions, the c-Abl SH3 domain undergoes partial unfolding, which is stabilized by ligand binding, providing a unique assay for SH3:linker interaction in solution. Using this approach, we observed dynamic association of the SH3 domain with the linker in the absence of the kinase domain. Truncation of the linker before W254 completely prevented cis-interaction with SH3, while constructs containing amino acids past this point showed SH3:linker interactions. The observation that the Abl linker sequence exhibits SH3-binding activity in the absence of the kinase domain is unique to Abl and was not observed with Src-family kinases. These results suggest that SH3:linker interactions may have a more prominent role in Abl regulation than in Src kinases, where the down-regulated conformation is further stabilized by a second intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal tail and the SH2 domain.\n\nTopBP1 deficiency causes an early embryonic lethality and induces cellular senescence in primary cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeon, Yoon; Ko, Eun; Lee, Kyung Yong; Ko, Min Ji; Park, Seo Young; Kang, Jeeheon; Jeon, Chang Hwan; Lee, Ho; Hwang, Deog Su\n\n2011-02-18\n\nTopBP1 plays important roles in chromosome replication, DNA damage response, and other cellular regulatory functions in vertebrates. Although the roles of TopBP1 have been studied mostly in cancer cell lines, its physiological function remains unclear in mice and untransformed cells. We generated conditional knock-out mice in which exons 5 and 6 of the TopBP1 gene are flanked by loxP sequences. Although TopBP1-deficient embryos developed to the blastocyst stage, no homozygous mutant embryos were recovered at E8.5 or beyond, and completely resorbed embryos were frequent at E7.5, indicating that mutant embryos tend to die at the peri-implantation stage. This finding indicated that TopBP1 is essential for cell proliferation during early embryogenesis. Ablation of TopBP1 in TopBP1(flox/flox) mouse embryonic fibroblasts and 3T3 cells using Cre recombinase-expressing retrovirus arrests cell cycle progression at the G(1), S, and G(2)/M phases. The TopBP1-ablated mouse cells exhibit phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2, indicating that the cells contain DNA breaks. The TopBP1-ablated mouse cells enter cellular senescence. Although RNA interference-mediated knockdown of TopBP1 induced cellular senescence in human primary cells, it induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, TopBP1 deficiency in untransformed mouse and human primary cells induces cellular senescence rather than apoptosis. These results indicate that TopBP1 is essential for cell proliferation and maintenance of chromosomal integrity.\n\nTemperature-Dependent Kinetics Studies of the Reactions Br((sup 2)P3/2) + H2S yields SH + HBr and Br((sup 2)P3/2) + CH3SH yields CH3S + HBr. Heats of Formation of SH and CH3S Radicals\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNicovich, J. M.; Kreutter, K. D.; vanDijk, C. A.; Wine, P. H.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nTime resolved resonance fluorescence detection of Br(sup 2)P3/2) atom disappearance or appearance following 266-nm laser flash photolysis of CF2Br2/H2S/H2/N2, CF2Br2/CH3SH/H2/N2, Cl2CO/H2S/HBr/N2, and CH3SSCH3/HBr/H2/N2 mixtures has been employed to study the kinetics of the reactions Br((sup 2)P3/2) + H2S = SH + HBr (1,-1) and Br((sup2)P3/2) + CH3SH = CH3S + HBr (2, -2) as a function of temperature over the range 273-431K. Arrhenius expressions in units of 10(exp -12) cu cm/molecule/s which describe the results are k1 = (14.2 +/- 3.4) exp[(-2752 +/- 90)/T],(k-1) = (4.40 +/- 0.92) exp[(-971 +/- 73)/T],k(2) = (9.24 +/- 1.15) exp[(-386 +/- 41)/T], and k(-2) = (1.46 +/-0.21) exp[(-399 +/-41)/T; errors are 2 sigma and represent precision only. By examining Br((sup 2)P3/2) equilibrium kinetics following 355nm laser flash photolysis of Br2/CH3SH/H2/N2 mixtures, a 298 K rate coefficient of (1.7 +/- 0.5) x 10(exp -10) cu cm/molecule/s has been obtained for the reaction CH3S + Br2 yields CH3SBr + Br. To our knowledge, these are the first kinetic data reported for each of the reactions studied. Measured rate coefficients, along with known rate coefficients for similar radical + H2S, CH3SH, HBr,Br2 reactions are considered in terms of possible correlations of reactivity with reaction thermochemistry and with IP - EA, the difference between the ionization potential of the electron donor and the electron affinity of the electron acceptor. Both thermochemical and charge-transfer effects appear to be important in controlling observed reactivities. Second and third law analyses of the equilibrium data for reactions 1 and 2 have been employed to obtain the following enthalpies of reaction in units of kcal/mol: for reaction 1, Delta-H(298) = 3.64 +/- 0.43 and Delta-H(0) = 3.26 +/-0.45; for reaction 2, Delta-H(298) = -0.14 +/- 0.28 and Delta-H(0) = -0.65 +/- 0.36. Combining the above enthalpies of reaction with the well-known heats of formation of Br, HBr, H2S, and CH3SH gives the\n\nActivation of PPARÎ³ Ameliorates Spatial Cognitive Deficits through Restoring Expression of AMPA Receptors in Seipin Knock-Out Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Libin; Chen, Tingting; Li, Guoxi; Wu, Chaoming; Wang, Conghui; Li, Lin; Sha, Sha; Chen, Lei; Liu, George; Chen, Ling\n\n2016-01-27\n\nA characteristic phenotype of congenital generalized lipodystrophy 2 (CGL2) that is caused by loss-of-function of seipin gene is mental retardation. Here, we show that seipin deficiency in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells caused the reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³). Twelve-week-old systemic seipin knock-out mice and neuronal seipin knock-out (seipin-nKO) mice, but not adipose seipin knock-out mice, exhibited spatial cognitive deficits as assessed by the Morris water maze and Y-maze, which were ameliorated by the treatment with the PPARÎ³ agonist rosiglitazone (rosi). In addition, seipin-nKO mice showed the synaptic dysfunction and the impairment of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in hippocampal CA1 regions. The density of AMPA-induced current (IAMPA) in CA1 pyramidal cells and GluR1/GluR2 expression were significantly reduced in seipin-nKO mice, whereas the NMDA-induced current (INMDA) and NR1/NR2 expression were not altered. Rosi treatment in seipin-nKO mice could correct the decrease in expression and activity of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and was accompanied by recovered synaptic function and LTP induction. Furthermore, hippocampal ERK2 and CREB phosphorylation in seipin-nKO mice were reduced and this could be rescued by rosi treatment. Rosi treatment in seipin-nKO mice elevated BDNF concentration. The MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked rosi-restored AMPAR expression and LTP induction in seipin-nKO mice, but the Trk family inhibitor K252a did not. These findings indicate that the neuronal seipin deficiency selectively suppresses AMPAR expression through reducing ERK-CREB activities, leading to the impairment of LTP and spatial memory, which can be rescued by PPARÎ³ activation. Congenital generalized lipodystrophy 2 (CGL2), caused by loss-of-function mutation of seipin gene, is characterized by mental retardation. By th"
