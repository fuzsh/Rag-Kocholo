The DNA construct can transfect a host cell. Additionally, the invention provides methods to enhance the expression of CRMP-1 and/or the reporter protein. The over-expression of CRMP-1 in a cancer cell can inhibit the metastasis of the cancer cell.\n\nCRMPs Collapsin response mediator proteins\n\nCRMPs bear the sequence homology to UNC-33, a nematode protein, whose absence produces aberrant elongation of axons and uncoordinated movement in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans . (Li et al., Genetics (1992), 132(3): 675-689).\n\nCRMP family members have a 50%/70% amino acid sequence homology.\n\nFive members of the CRMP gene family crmp-1, crmp-2, crmp-3, crmp-4, and crmp-5), encoding closely related 60-66 kDa proteins, have been independently cloned by various laboratories. Each CRMP is believed to have a unique function.\n\nCRMP collamate response mediator protein\n\nTOAD-64 turned on after division of a 64 kD protein\n\nUlip Ulip\n\nDRP dihydropyrimidinase related protein\n\nTUC TOAD/Ulip/CRMP\n\nCRMP-1, CRMP-4 and CRMP-5 are mainly expressed in the fetal brain and not in the brain of the adult mice.\n\nCRMP-2 and CRMP-3 are expressed in the brain of both the fetal and the adult mice. However, in the adult mice, CRMP-3 is localized in the cerebellum.\n\nCRMP-4 was strongly up-regulated, whereas CRMP-1 and CRMP-2 only increased slightly and CRMP-3 was down-regulated.\n\nNGF nerve growth factor\n\nCRMP-1 Collapsin response mediator protein-1\n\nDRP-1 dihydropyrimidinase related protein-1\n\nCRMP-1 gene inversely affects cancer invasion and metastasis, (i.e., the higher the level of expression, the lower the incidence of cancer invasion and metastasis) and thus characterized the CRMP-1 gene as an invasion-surppression gene.\n\nnucleic acid regulatory elements/sequences associated with the CRMP-1 gene include, but are not limited to, the promoter, the basal transcription regulatory region, and the transcription factor binding sites which are located upstream of, and are operatively linked to, the CRMP-1 gene. Understanding the regulation of the expression of the CRMP-1 gene will lead to new strategies for treatment of cancer patients so as to halt cancer metastasis.\n\nthe present invention provides a transcription unit, which comprises a nucleic acid regulatory sequence that is isolated from upstream (i.e., at the 5â²-flanking region of the gene) of the gene encoding a collapsin response mediator protein-1 (âCRMP-1 geneâ).\n\nthe nucleic acid regulatory sequence is characterized by its ability to regulate expression of the CRMP-1 gene and/or an exogenous gene that is/are operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence.\n\nthe CRMP-1 gene is preferably a human CRMP-1 gene.\n\nthe nucleic acid sequence of CRMP-1 can be found in SWISS-PROT entry Q14194, GenBank locus D78012, and GenBank locus BAA11190.\n\nthe nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, which includes the nucleotides at positions â 1920 to +50 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene.

This nucleic acid sequence represents the minimal promoter sequence.\n\nthe nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5, which includes the nucleotides at positions â 133 to â 122 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nThis nucleic acid sequence contains a first regulatory factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of GGGAGGAG. A loss of or a mutation in this nucleic acid sequence results in drastic reduction in expression of the CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene.\n\nthe nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6, which includes the nucleotides at positions â 115 to â 100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nThis nucleic acid sequence contains a second regulatory factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of CTCCTCCC , which is the inverted sequence of GGGAGGAG that found in the first regulatory factor binding site.\n\na loss of the second transcription factor binding site (SEQ ID NO:6) in addition to the first transcription factor binding site (SEQ ID NO:5) results in further reduction of CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene expression.\n\na mutation in the second transcription factor binding site does not appear to affect the transcriptional activities of the CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene.\n\nthe exogenous gene that can be operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence can be a reporter gene, such as the firefly luciferase gene or the green fluorescent protein gene.\n\nthe present invention also provides a DNA construct which comprises the nucleic acid regulatory sequence, such as SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, and a vector.\n\na vector for preparing the DNA construct is a pGL3-basic vector, which contains the firefly luciferase gene.\n\nthe present invention further provides a transfected cell, which comprises the DNA construct that contains the nucleic acid regulatory sequence in a host cell, such as a human cell, and preferably a human cancer cell, such as a human lung adenocarcinoma cell or a human colon cancer cell.\n\na host cell such as a human cell\n\na human cancer cell such as a human lung adenocarcinoma cell or a human colon cancer cell.\n\nthe present invention provides a method for enhancing the expression of the CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene (such as the firefly luciferase gene) in a host cell.\n\nthe method comprises transfecting the host cell with the DNA construct that contains the transcription unit.\n\nthe host cell is preferably a human cell.\n\nthe present invention provides a method for inhibiting metastasis of a human cancer cell.\n\nthe method comprises transfecting the human cancer cell with the DNA construct that contains the transcription unit.\n\nFIG. 1 shows the relative luciferase activities as a result of a series nucleotides deletions of the 5â² flanking region of the human CRMP-1 gene after the DNA construct containing the designated nucleic acid regulatory sequence upstream from the CRMP-1 gene was transfected into a CL 1-0 cell line, which is a subline of a lung adenocarcinoma cell line.\n\nthe relative luciferase activities were normalized by the â -galactosidase activities, and the values were subsequently compared with the mean values of the control plasmid (i,e., with pGL3basic only and without the nucleic acid regulatory sequence upstream from the CRMP-1 gene) to determine the % of expression vs. the control.\n\nFIG. 2 shows a partial nucleic acid sequence representing the 5â² flanking region of human CRMP-1 gene.\n\na partial exon 1 of the human CRMP-1 gene is shown in the box.\n\nPotential transcription factors (NF-E and Sp1) binding sites are indicated as underlined sequences.\n\nthe * represents the four nucleotides-GAGC.\n\nFIG. 3 identifies the specific DNA-protein complexes binding in the CRMP-1 promoter region.\n\nESA electrophoretic mobility shift assay\n\ncompetition mobility shift assay competition mobility shift assay\n\nantibody supershift assay as described in Example 6, infra.\n\nThree double-stranded DNA probes were designed for the motility shift assay.\n\nDNA probe A contained tandem repeat of the first putative binding site sequence containing (5â²- GGGAGGAG CTGT GGGAGGAG CTGT-3â², SEQ ID NO:12).

All results were visualized using ethidium bromide staining.\n\nnucleic acid sequence refers to a DNA, cDNA or RNA molecule, either as a separate fragment or as part of a larger polynucleotide construct.\n\nthe âgeneâ may be single-stranded (e.g., RNA) or double-stranded (e.g., DNA).\n\nDNA may be, for example, cDNA which is enzymatically prepared from a transcribed RNA (mRNA), genomic DNA from chromosomes, or chemically synthesized DNA.\n\nnucleic acid regulatory sequence refers to the 5â²-flanking region DNA, cDNA or RNA fragment(s) upstream from the gene which affect(s) the transcription and expression of the gene.\n\nnucleic acid regulatory sequence may include a promoter region for regulating the transcription of a coding region, an enhancer region affecting the promoter region, and other regulatory factor binding sites (e.g., transcription factor binding sites, such as a TATA Box, CCAAT Box, AP1, Sp1, or NF- â B binding sites) as well as intron or the like.\n\nthe nucleic acid regulatory sequence may or may not be directly linked to the gene.\n\npromoter refers to a DNA sequence to which RNA polymerase is capable of binding to initiate transcription of the gene.\n\na promoter may be linked to the gene with which it is naturally associated, or may be functionally linked to an exogenous gene.\n\nexogenous gene is intended to mean a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a product but does not naturally occur with the promoter sequence.\n\noperatively linked means that the nucleic acid regulatory sequence and the gene are functionally linked such that the nucleic acid regulatory sequence controls the expression of the gene.\n\nreporter gene is used in molecular biology as indicators of gene activity.\n\na reporter gene will typically encode an enzyme activity that is lacking in the host cell or organism, which is to be transformed. This allows the measurement or detection of the enzyme activity, which may be used as an indicator or âreporterâ of the presence of expression of the newly introduced gene.\n\na reporter gene may be put under the influence of a âcontrollerâ sequence, such as a promoter element. Successful expression of the reporter gene product serves as an indicator of controller element activity.\n\nthe present invention described a novel nucleic acid regulatory sequence which affects the expression of the gene encoding the collapsin response mediator protein-1 gene (âCRMP-1 geneâ).\n\na partial genomic sequence of the CRMP-1 gene which includes the 5â²-flanking region of the genomic sequence of the CRMP-1 gene is designated as SEQ ID NO:1.\n\nSEQ ID NO:1 contains the nucleic acid sequence from positions â 1920 to +189 of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nThis nucleic acid sequence possesses the entire promoter region, several regulatory factor binding sites, and exon-1 of the CRMP-1 gene (at positions +1 to +189 of the CRMP-1 gene) which contains the starting codon ATG (at positions +151-153 as shown in SEQ ID NO:1) encoding methionine.\n\nthe nucleic acid sequence at positions â 1920 to +50 upstream of the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:2.\n\nThis nucleic acid sequence contains the entire promoter region, several transcription factor binding sites, and a partial sequence of the exon-1 of the CRMP-1 gene. However, it does not contain the starting codon ATG of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nthe nucleic acid sequence at positions â 180 to +50 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:3. This nucleic acid sequence contains the core promoter region and the transcription factor binding sites.\n\nthe nucleic acid sequence at positions â 180 to -100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:4.

Examples of the reporter gene includes a firefly luciferase gene, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene.\n\nthe firefly luciferase gene is a well-known reporter gene.\n\nthe coding sequence of the firefly ( photinus pyralis ) luciferase has been cloned in the pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector and currently sold by Promega.\n\nThis reporter gene provides a basis for the quantitative analysis of factors that potentially regulate mammalian gene expression.\n\nthe pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector also known as pGL3 basic vector\n\nthe firefly luciferase gene coding region has been optimized for monitoring transcriptional activity in transfected eukaryotic cells.

One may thus have an in vivo fluorescent protein, which may be followed in a living system.\n\nGFP has several different color variants.\n\nthe GFP and GFP color variant vectors for gene cloning and construction are available from Clontech.\n\nthe reporter gene can be operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence of the present invention via vectors to form a DNA or expression construct, which can then be transfected into a host cell.\n\nvectors which can be used to form the DNA construct are known in the art and include either a plasmid or a virus carrier.\n\nthe firefly luciferase gene is used as the reporter gene, the use of the pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector currently sold by Promega is preferred.\n\nthe use of pGFP Vector currently sold by Clontech is preferred.\n\nnucleic acid regulatory sequence at positions â 1920 to +50, SEQ ID NO:2\n\na core promoter region at positions â 180 to +50, SEQ ID NO:3\n\na minimum promoter region at positions â 180 to â 100, SEQ ID NO:4\n\nthe nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 (at positions â 133 to â 122) contains a regulatory factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of 5â²-GGGAGGAG-3â², which is preferred to be included in the DNA constructs.\n\nthe regulatory factor binding site could be a transcription factor binding site, such as the binding site for transcription factor Sp1.\n\nthe SP1 transcriptional control sequence is found in a large number of viral and cellular promoters, including the HIV long terminal repeat.\n\nthe SP1 transcription factor contains contiguous zinc finger motifs that provide specific DNA binding activity.\n\nTranscription factor Sp1 stimulates the basal activity of the minimal promoter through mechanisms that maintain the differential activity.\n\nthe nucleic acid regulatory sequence of the present invention has the ability to bind to various proteins.\n\nthe binding of the various proteins affects the regulatory capacity of the nucleic acid regulatory sequence, which in turn may affect the expression of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\na 2.1-kb DNA fragment containing the 5â²-flanking region of hCRMP-1 gene (positions â 1920 to +189 of human CRMP-1 gene (HCRMP-1), [SEQ ID NO:1]) was obtained by PCR amplification (Roche GC-rich PCR system) using two primers:\n\nthe human BAC clone RP 11-69D13 (Invitrogen) was used as DNA template. This amplified fragment was cleaved with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into the XhoI/HindIII site at the upstream of luciferase gene of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The construct was designated as pCRMP-1 ( â 1920/+189) and the sequence of the amplified fragment was confirmed by sequence analysis.\n\nthe 5â²-flanking region of hCRMP-1 gene (positions â 1920 to +50 of hCRMP-1, [SEQ ID NO:2]) was amplified by using two PCR primers:\n\nCLIO Human lung adenocarcinoma cells\n\nRPMI 1640 medium RPMI\n\nFBS fetal bovine serum\n\npCRMP-1( â 1920/+50) DNA and 1 â g of internal control plasmid DNA were dissolved in serum free RPMI and complexed with 10 â l Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The DNA/lipid complexes were allowed to anneal at room temperature for 45 minutes prior to their addition to CL 1-0 cells.\n\nCells were co-transfected by incubation with complexes for 6 hours at 37Â° C., 5% CO 2 .\n\nMedium was removed and cells which were washed twice with 1 â PBS.\n\n2 ml of RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were added to the cells to be incubated at 37Â° C., with 5% CO 2 .\n\nCells were harvested after 36 hours of incubation and cellular extracts were obtained by using 250 â l of lysis buffer (Tropix, Inc.) per well.\n\nHuman colon cancer cell lines CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 were developed in the laboratory of Advpharma Inc., in Taipei, Taiwan. These cell lines were deposited at the Food Industry Research and Development Institute (FIRDI) in Taiwan and registered with the numbers BCRC 60448, BCRC60449, and BCRC60450. Human colon cancer cells were plated according to the procedures well known to the artisans in the field. The cells were transfected with pCRMP-1 containing the full length CRMP-1 promoter ( â 1920/+50) and harvested according to the procedures described above.\n\nFIRDI Food Industry Research and Development Institute\n\nluciferase and P-galactosidase activities 20 â l of cell extract were separately used.\n\nthe assays were carried out by Luciferase assay kit and Galacto-Light PlusTM system (Tropix, Inc.) on the luminometer (BERTHOLD Detection Systems Type Sirius 2C, Pforzheim, Germany).\n\nLuciferase activity mentioned in the following texts represents data that has been normalized with â -galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity was used as an indication of gene expression in cells containing the indicated reporter DNA construct.\n\nSequential deleted 5â² regulatory sequence mutants of CRMP-1 gene were constructed using the following method, to determine the function of the hCRMP-1 regulatory elements. All of the procedures shown below were according to the instructions in the Exo Mung Bean Deletion Kit (Stratagene) with some modifications. Briefly, the pCRMP-1( â 1920/+50) was first digested with restriction endonucleases XhoI. The linealized plasmids were further treated with exonuclease III at 37Â° C. for different time intervals. Nine different sizes of plasmid fragments starting from position â 1920 were obtained after phenol-chloroform extraction.\n\nthe truncated plasmid fragments were then incubated with mung bean nuclease for 30 minutes at 37Â° C. after inactivation of the exonuclease III at 68Â° C. for 15 minutes.\n\nthe resulting plasmid fragments were precipitated and ligated by T4 DNA ligase.\n\nEach truncated construct was transiently transfected into CL 1-0 cells and its relevant luciferase activity was determined as described in Example 2.\n\nthe various constructs and their relevant luciferase activities in transfected human lung adenocarcinoma cells were depicted schematically as shown in FIG. 1 .\n\nthe luciferase activities in various human colon cancer cells transfected with pCRMP-1 containing the full length CRMP-1 promoter were also detected (data not shown). Luciferase activity was firstly normalized to â -galactosidase activity.\n\nthe luciferase activity of cells transfected with control plasmid pGL3basic was set as baseline.\n\nnucleotides â 1920 to â 180 did not significantly change the transcriptional activity, as compared to that of the pCRMP-1( â 1920/+50) in CL 1-0 .\n\nthe fragment from â 180 to +50 exhibited promoter activity.\n\nCells transfected with DNA constructs containing the reporter gene and the regulatory region from positions â 99 to â 180 were shown to enhance the transcriptional activities to 30 â 60 fold, in comparison to those in cells containing the control plasmid pGL3basic.\n\nthe transcriptional activities of the DNA construct pCRMP-1 ( â 180/+50) containing the nucleotides at positions â 99 to â 180 was increased up to 5-fold more than the activity of the pCRMP-1( â 99/+50).\n\nthe first regulatory factor binding site was located in the regions between positions â 133 to â 122 (5â²-GGGAGGAGCTGT-3â², SEQ ID NO:5).\n\nthe second one is in the region from positions â 115 to â 100 (5â²-CCCC CTCCTCCC GCC-3â², SEQ ID NO:6) containing a GGGAGGAG -inverted sequence overlapped with other putative Sp1 binding site.\n\nthe DNA construct pCRMP-1-M12 contained the original nucleic acid regulatory sequence at positions â 99 to +50 and two additional artificial tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor binding site, which was at positions â 133 to â 122 upstream of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\na short oligonucleotide flanking with XhoI restriction sequence (5â²-CCGCTCGA CGGGAGGAGCTGTGGGAGGAGCTGTCTCGAGCGG-3â², SEQ ID NO:11) and its reverse sequence were chemically synthesized to form a short DNA double strand.\n\nthe modified DNA construct i.e., pCRMP-1-M12\n\npCRMP-1 was obtained by digestion of the double stranded oligonculeotide with endonuclease XhoI followed by ligation to the linealized (also with XhoI digested) DNA construct pCRMP-1( â 99/+50).\n\nthe DNA construct pCRMP-1( â 99/+50) showed about 24% relative luciferase activity and was used as a negative control, as opposite to the wild type pCRMP-1 ( â 180/+50) used as positive control (i.e, the luciferase activity of pCRMP-1( â 180/+50) was used as 100%).\n\nthe first regulatory factor binding site was crucial to the transcription and expression of the human CRMP-1 gene. Specifically, these two artificial tandem repeats of the first regulatory factor binding site could substitute the region for original sequence without any effect on relevant luciferase activity. Furthermore, the transcription and expression activity of this first regulatory factor binding site did not appear to be dependent on the exact position from the transcription start site of the CRMP-1 gene (i.e., the ATG start codon of exon-1 of the CRMP-1 gene).\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis method was applied for further sequence structure studies of possible binding sites in the nucleic acid regulatory sequence at positions â 180 to â 100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nmutant DNA constructs were shown below and the results of the mutant DNA constructs and their relevant luciferase activities are depicted in Table 2.\n\nmutant DNA constructs containing the reporter gene luciferase were designed on the base of the wild type DNA construct pCRMP-1( â 180/+50). They were designated as pCRMP-1 M3, m3-2, m3-3, m3-4, and m3-5. All of them had the same length of 5â² end CRMP-1 promoter as the DNA construct pCRMP-1( â 180/+50) except that each mutant represented a point mutation or a nucleic acid conversion which occurred at positions â 133 to â 122, as indicated in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the relative luciferase activities of mutants M3 and m3-4 were drastically reduced to almost half of that of the wild type (WT) DNA construct pCRMP-1( â 180/+50).\n\nmutants m3-2 and m3-3 demonstrated a reduction in transcription and expression activity of about 70% to 60%, respectively. (See Table 2).\n\nmutant construct M11 although having the same mutations as that of the pCRMP-1 M3, demonstrated an obvious loss (50%) of the relative luciferase activity, even though the 1.9 kb upstream regulatory sequence was intact in the DNA construct.\n\nthe second regulatory binding site contains a GGGAGGAG-inverted sequence. No any obvious effects on the transcriptional activities were observed when the sequence structure at the region from position â 115 to â 100 (i.e., DNA constructs pCRMP1 M4 and M5) were disrupted. (See Table 2).\n\nthe mutant construct pCRMP-1 M1 with the mutations at the positions â 171 and â 170 showed a reduction of transcription activity to 60%, as compared to that of the wild type DNA construct pCRMP-1( â 180/+50). (See Table 2). A slight (i.e., about 20% reduction) loss of the transcription activity was observed, as the conversion of GC to AT at the positions â 119 and â 118 was conducted. (See Table 2).\n\nthe results of the site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the first regulatory 10 factor binding site at positions â 133 to â 122 (5â²-GGGAGGAGCTGT-3â², SEQ ID NO:5) was essential for the regulation of the transcription and/or expression activity of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nthe major technique for identifying specific binding protein complexes in the nuclear extracts of the crmp-1 regulatory fragments was electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Its related method, antibody super-shift assay, further confirmed the involvement of the binding proteins (i.e., in the formation of DNA-protein complexes) in the CRMP-1 gene nucleic acid regulatory sequence.\n\nESA electrophoretic mobility shift assay\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay provides a simple method for detecting DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors (Buratowski et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , (1996): 12.2.1-12.2.11). This assay is based on the observation that DNA-protein complexes migrate through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel more slowly than free DNA fragments or double-stranded oligonucleotides.\n\nthe gel shift assay was performed by incubating a purified protein, or a complex mixture of proteins (such as from cell nuclear extracts), with a 32 P end-labeled DNA fragment containing the regulatory factor binding site. The specificity of the DNA-binding protein for the regulatory factor binding site was confirmed by competition experiments using unlabeled DNA fragments or oligonucleotides containing the regulatory factor binding sites of the CRMP-1 gene or other unrelated DNA sequence.\n\nThree double-stranded DNA probes were designed specifically for the motility shift assay. They were generated by chemical synthesis and annealing of the complementary oligonucleotides.\n\nDNA probe A contained tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor binding site sequence (5â²- GGGAGGAG CTGT GGGAGGAG CTGT -3â², SEQ ID NO:12).\n\nDNA probe B was the fragment from positions â 117 to â 100 (5â²-AGCCCC CTCCTCCC GCCC-3â², SEQ ID NO:13), containing a GGGAGGAG -inverted sequence.\n\nDNA probe C was the fragment from positions â 137 to â 100 (5â²-CGCC GGG AGGAG CTGTCTGCAGCCCC CTCCTCCC GCCC-3â², SEQ ID NO:14).\n\nRadioactive labeling of DNA probes was performed according to the instructions of Gel Shift Assay Systems (Technical Bulletin No. 110) provided by Promega (USA).\n\nreaction mixture was then mixed with a 32 P-labeled probe and then incubated at room temperature for another 20 minutes.\n\na tenth volume of a gel loading buffer containing 250 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 0.2% bromophenol blue, and 40% glycerol, was added to each reaction mixture. Samples were electrophoresed for 100V at 4Â° C. after pre-running on the 4% PAGE gel in 1XTBE buffer.\n\na variation of the mobility shift DNA-binding assay was applied which used antibodies to identify proteins present in the protein-DNA complex (Kristie et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . USA. (1986), 83:3218-3222).\n\na specific antibody was added to a binding reaction, in order to decide, whether a suspected protein, e.g., a transcription factor, involved in the formation of the DNA-protein complex in gel shift study. No effect should be observed when the protein recognized by the antibody was not involved in the complex formation.\n\nTwo different expectations would be seen, i.e., either the complex formation was inhibited, or an antibody-protein-DNA ternary complex was formed. The latter could result in a further reduction in the mobility of the protein-DNA complex (i.e., supershift).\n\nSp1 protein Purified recombinant Sp1 protein was purchased from Promega (USA). The Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts and DNA probes for 30 min.\n\nDNA-protein complex P4 could be detected both in the HeLa nuclear extracts and in the CL 1-0 nuclear extracts using the 32 P end-labelled DNA probe B ( FIG. 3B , lane 1 and lane 8 , respectively).\n\nthe gel shift analysis shows the specificity of DNA-protein complex after the competition assay using the same unlabeled DNA fragment at the amount of an excess of 50-fold and 100-fold, respectively ( FIG. 3B , lane 2 and lane 3 ).\n\nThis DNA-protein complex disappeared when an excess of 50-fold and 100-fold unlabeled DNA probe A was added respectively ( FIG. 3B , lane 4 and lane 5 ).\n\nthe binding reaction with an excess of mutant DNA probe, as a negative control, was not able to compete with the specific DNA binding protein ( FIG. 3B , lane 6 and lane 7 ).\n\nThis gel shift study further confirmed that DNA probe A and DNA probe B possessed the same competition ability, since both contain the same sequence element (GGGAGGAG). Specifically, complex P3 and P4 might consist\n\nthe DNA-protein complex P5 and P6 were specifically competed by an excess of 100-fold and 200-fold of DNA probe A containing tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor element ( FIG. 3C , lane 4 and lane 5 ), but not by the DNA probe B ( FIG. 3C , lane 8 and lane 9 ).\n\nthe DNA-protein complex P7 was assumed to be specific to the DNA probe B because it disappeared in the competition assay ( FIG. 3C , lane 8 and lane 9 ). There could be additional protein(s), or transcription factor(s), specifically responsible for binding to the first regulatory factor binding site.\n\nthe DNA-protein complex P1 with the slowest motility was supershifted by the addition of an anti-Sp1 antibody in the binding reaction ( FIG. 3A , lane 8 ). The same effect could be seen for DNA Probe C-containing binding reaction ( FIG. 3C , lane 10 ). A supershift effect of the DNA-protein complex with the slowest motility was confirmed by incubating CL 1-0 nuclear extract with DNA probe A and with DNA probe C (data not shown).\n\nDNA construct pSG5 was used as the control in the cell line CL 1-0 .\n\nRNA-BeeTM kit One microgram of total RNA was applied for reverse transcription reaction and 1/25 volume of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was further used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Invitrogen).\n\nPCR polymerase chain reaction\n\nThree pairs of specific primers were designed for hCRMP-1, Sp-1, and Gp like gene expression study, as follows:\n\nSEQ ID NO:16 sense primer\n\nSEQ ID NO:17 antisense primer\n\nSEQ ID NO:17 5â²-AGTAATGGGTGCCATCGGTCCCCAG-3â².\n\nPrimer pair for Sp-1 sense primer (SEQ ID NO:18) 5â²-GAGAGTGGCTCACAGCCTGTC-3â² and antisense primer (SEQ ID NO:19) 5â²-GTTCAGAGCATCAGACCCCTG-3â².\n\nSEQ ID NO:19 5â²-GTTCAGAGCATCAGACCCCTG-3â².\n\nG â like (Shan, et al., Mol.

No. 60/544,682, filed on Feb. 17, 2004, which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to a transcription unit which is isolated from the upstream nucleic acid sequence of a collapsing response mediator protein-1 (CRMP-1) gene, preferably a human CRMP-1 gene or crmp-1. CRMP-1 gene is an invasion-suppressor gene, which prevent cancer metastasis. The transcription unit contains a nucleic acid regulatory sequence, which demonstrates promoter and/or regulatory activities (such as providing a transcription factor binding site) to enhance the expression of the CRMP-1 and/or an exogenous gene operatively linked to the transcription unit (such as a reporter protein). The invention also provides a DNA construct containing the transcription unit and a vector. The DNA construct can transfect a host cell. Additionally, the invention provides methods to enhance the expression of CRMP-1 and/or the reporter protein. The over-expression of CRMP-1 in a cancer cell can inhibit the metastasis of the cancer cell.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nCollapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) belong to a family of phosphoproteins, which mediate semaphorin/collapsin-induced growth cone collapse and are believed to be involved in both axonal guidance and neuronal differentiation. CRMPs are expressed mainly in the nervous system, especially during embryogenesis. Immunocytochemical studies have shown that CRMPs are distributed in the lamellipodia and filopodia of the growth cone, the shaft of axons, and the neuronal cell body. Their expression and phosphorylation are spatially and temporally regulated during development although their molecular mechanisms of action are yet to be clearly.\n\nThe members of CRMPs bear the sequence homology to UNC-33, a nematode protein, whose absence produces aberrant elongation of axons and uncoordinated movement in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. (Li et al., Genetics (1992), 132(3): 675-689). CRMP family members have a 50%/70% amino acid sequence homology. Five members of the CRMP gene family (crmp-1, crmp-2, crmp-3, crmp-4, and crmp-5), encoding closely related 60-66 kDa proteins, have been independently cloned by various laboratories. Each CRMP is believed to have a unique function. The members of the CRMP family have been referred to as CRMP (collapsin response mediator protein), TOAD-64 (turned on after division of a 64 kD protein), Ulip (UNC-33 like phosphoprotein), DRP (dihydropyrimidinase related protein) and TUC (TOAD/Ulip/CRMP). Nonetheless, the most frequently used name in medical literature is CRMP.\n\nTranscription of the CRMP gene is differentially regulated. (Kato et al., Histochem. Cell Biol. (2000), 97(11):6212-6217; Matsuo et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2000), 275(22):16560-16568; Quach et al., Gene (2000), 242(1-2): 175-182). Mouse CRMP-1, CRMP-4 and CRMP-5 are mainly expressed in the fetal brain and not in the brain of the adult mice. On the other hand, CRMP-2 and CRMP-3 are expressed in the brain of both the fetal and the adult mice. However, in the adult mice, CRMP-3 is localized in the cerebellum. In PC-12 cells, after induction of neuronal differentiation by nerve growth factor (NGF), CRMP-4 was strongly up-regulated, whereas CRMP-1 and CRMP-2 only increased slightly and CRMP-3 was down-regulated. (Byk et al., Eur. J. Biochem. (1998), 254(1): 14-24). At this time, only the promoter of human CRMP-4 has been isolated and analyzed. (Matsuo et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2000), 275(22): 16560-16568). No studies of the regulatory elements of other members of the CRMP family have been conducted.\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein-1 (CRMP-1), also named as dihydropyrimidinase related protein-1 (DRP-1), is a 62 kDa phosphoprotein. CRMP-1 was originally discovered in the brain tissue and thought to be a brain specific protein involved in the collapsin-induced growth cone collapse during neural development. (Torres et al., DNA Res. (1998), 5(6): 393-395).\n\nRecently, the inventors of the present invention discovered that the level of expression of the gene encoding CRMP-1 (hereinafter âCRMP-1 geneâ) inversely affects cancer invasion and metastasis, (i.e., the higher the level of expression, the lower the incidence of cancer invasion and metastasis) and thus characterized the CRMP-1 gene as an invasion-surppression gene. (Shih et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (2001), 93(18): 1392-1400; Chu et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. (1997), 17: 353-360; and Shih et al., Clinical & Exper. Metastasis (2003) 20: 69-76). The contents of these articles are herein incorporated by reference. The inventors of the present invention found that low-expression patients of CRMP-1 had more advanced diseases and lymph node metastases, while high-expression patients of CRMP-1 had a significantly longer disease-free and overall survival period.\n\nIn the invention to be presented in the following sections, the findings of the nucleic acid regulatory elements/sequences associated with the CRMP-1 gene are disclosed. These nucleic acid regulatory elements/sequences include, but are not limited to, the promoter, the basal transcription regulatory region, and the transcription factor binding sites which are located upstream of, and are operatively linked to, the CRMP-1 gene. Understanding the regulation of the expression of the CRMP-1 gene will lead to new strategies for treatment of cancer patients so as to halt cancer metastasis.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention provides a transcription unit, which comprises a nucleic acid regulatory sequence that is isolated from upstream (i.e., at the 5â²-flanking region of the gene) of the gene encoding a collapsin response mediator protein-1 (âCRMP-1 geneâ). The nucleic acid regulatory sequence is characterized by its ability to regulate expression of the CRMP-1 gene and/or an exogenous gene that is/are operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence. The CRMP-1 gene is preferably a human CRMP-1 gene. The nucleic acid sequence of CRMP-1 can be found in SWISS-PROT entry Q14194, GenBank locus D78012, and GenBank locus BAA11190.\n\nIn one embodiment, the nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, which includes the nucleotides at positions â1920 to +50 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene. This nucleic acid sequence represents the entire promoter region. The transcription start nucleotide of the CRMP-1 gene is designated as +1, with the ATG start codon at positions +151 to +153.\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3, which includes the nucleotides at positions â180 to +50 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene. This nucleic acid sequence represents the minimal promoter sequence.\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5, which includes the nucleotides at positions â133 to â122 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene. This nucleic acid sequence contains a first regulatory factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of GGGAGGAG. A loss of or a mutation in this nucleic acid sequence results in drastic reduction in expression of the CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene.\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid regulatory sequence comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6, which includes the nucleotides at positions â115 to â100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene. This nucleic acid sequence contains a second regulatory factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of CTCCTCCC, which is the inverted sequence of GGGAGGAG that found in the first regulatory factor binding site. A loss of the second transcription factor binding site (SEQ ID NO:6) in addition to the first transcription factor binding site (SEQ ID NO:5) results in further reduction of CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene expression. However, a mutation in the second transcription factor binding site does not appear to affect the transcriptional activities of the CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene.\n\nThe exogenous gene that can be operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence can be a reporter gene, such as the firefly luciferase gene or the green fluorescent protein gene.\n\nThe present invention also provides a DNA construct which comprises the nucleic acid regulatory sequence, such as SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5, and a vector. An example of the vector for preparing the DNA construct is a pGL3-basic vector, which contains the firefly luciferase gene.\n\nThe present invention further provides a transfected cell, which comprises the DNA construct that contains the nucleic acid regulatory sequence in a host cell, such as a human cell, and preferably a human cancer cell, such as a human lung adenocarcinoma cell or a human colon cancer cell.\n\nAdditionally, the present invention provides a method for enhancing the expression of the CRMP-1 gene and/or the exogenous gene (such as the firefly luciferase gene) in a host cell. The method comprises transfecting the host cell with the DNA construct that contains the transcription unit. The host cell is preferably a human cell.\n\nFinally, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting metastasis of a human cancer cell. The method comprises transfecting the human cancer cell with the DNA construct that contains the transcription unit.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 shows the relative luciferase activities as a result of a series nucleotides deletions of the 5â² flanking region of the human CRMP-1 gene after the DNA construct containing the designated nucleic acid regulatory sequence upstream from the CRMP-1 gene was transfected into a CL1-0 cell line, which is a subline of a lung adenocarcinoma cell line. The relative luciferase activities were normalized by the Î²-galactosidase activities, and the values were subsequently compared with the mean values of the control plasmid (i,e., with pGL3basic only and without the nucleic acid regulatory sequence upstream from the CRMP-1 gene) to determine the % of expression vs. the control.\n\nFIG. 2 shows a partial nucleic acid sequence representing the 5â² flanking region of human CRMP-1 gene. A partial exon 1 of the human CRMP-1 gene is shown in the box. Potential transcription factors (NF-E and Sp1) binding sites are indicated as underlined sequences. The * represents the four nucleotides-GAGC.\n\nFIG. 3 identifies the specific DNA-protein complexes binding in the CRMP-1 promoter region. These studies were conducted using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), competition mobility shift assay, and antibody supershift assay, as described in Example 6, infra. Three double-stranded DNA probes were designed for the motility shift assay. DNA probe A contained tandem repeat of the first putative binding site sequence containing (5â²-GGGAGGAGCTGTGGGAGGAGCTGT-3â², SEQ ID NO:12). The underlined sequence denotes the first putative binding site sequence.

However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected. It is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents, which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.\n\nThe term ânucleic acid sequenceâ, as used herein, refers to a DNA, cDNA or RNA molecule, either as a separate fragment or as part of a larger polynucleotide construct.\n\nThe term âgeneâ as used herein, refers to a polymer in which nucleotides encoding the amino acids constituting a polypeptide (e.g., enzyme) are joined into a linear structure with directionality. The âgeneâ may be single-stranded (e.g., RNA) or double-stranded (e.g., DNA). DNA may be, for example, cDNA which is enzymatically prepared from a transcribed RNA (mRNA), genomic DNA from chromosomes, or chemically synthesized DNA.\n\nThe term ânucleic acid regulatory sequenceâ, as used herein, refers to the 5â²-flanking region DNA, cDNA or RNA fragment(s) upstream from the gene which affect(s) the transcription and expression of the gene. Such nucleic acid regulatory sequence may include a promoter region for regulating the transcription of a coding region, an enhancer region affecting the promoter region, and other regulatory factor binding sites (e.g., transcription factor binding sites, such as a TATA Box, CCAAT Box, AP1, Sp1, or NF-ÎºB binding sites) as well as intron or the like. The nucleic acid regulatory sequence may or may not be directly linked to the gene.\n\nThe term âpromoterâ, as used herein, refers to a DNA sequence to which RNA polymerase is capable of binding to initiate transcription of the gene. A promoter may be linked to the gene with which it is naturally associated, or may be functionally linked to an exogenous gene. In this context, the term âexogenous geneâ is intended to mean a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a product but does not naturally occur with the promoter sequence.\n\nThe term âoperatively linkedâ, as used herein, means that the nucleic acid regulatory sequence and the gene are functionally linked such that the nucleic acid regulatory sequence controls the expression of the gene.\n\nThe term âreporter geneâ is used in molecular biology as indicators of gene activity. A reporter gene will typically encode an enzyme activity that is lacking in the host cell or organism, which is to be transformed. This allows the measurement or detection of the enzyme activity, which may be used as an indicator or âreporterâ of the presence of expression of the newly introduced gene. A reporter gene may be put under the influence of a âcontrollerâ sequence, such as a promoter element. Successful expression of the reporter gene product serves as an indicator of controller element activity.\n\nThe present invention described a novel nucleic acid regulatory sequence which affects the expression of the gene encoding the collapsin response mediator protein-1 gene (âCRMP-1 geneâ). A partial genomic sequence of the CRMP-1 gene which includes the 5â²-flanking region of the genomic sequence of the CRMP-1 gene is designated as SEQ ID NO:1. SEQ ID NO:1 contains the nucleic acid sequence from positions â1920 to +189 of the CRMP-1 gene. This nucleic acid sequence possesses the entire promoter region, several regulatory factor binding sites, and exon-1 of the CRMP-1 gene (at positions +1 to +189 of the CRMP-1 gene) which contains the starting codon ATG (at positions +151-153 as shown in SEQ ID NO:1) encoding methionine.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequence at positions â1920 to +50 upstream of the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:2. This nucleic acid sequence contains the entire promoter region, several transcription factor binding sites, and a partial sequence of the exon-1 of the CRMP-1 gene. However, it does not contain the starting codon ATG of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequence at positions â180 to +50 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:3. This nucleic acid sequence contains the core promoter region and the transcription factor binding sites.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequence at positions â180 to -100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:4. This nucleic acid sequence contains the minimal promoter region and the transcription factor binding sites.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequence at positions â133 to â122 upstream of the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:5. This nucleic acid sequence comprises a first transcription factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of GGGAGGAG The nucleic acid sequence at positions â115 to â100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene is designated SEQ ID NO:6. This nucleic acid sequence comprises a second transcription factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of CTCCTCCC, which is an inverted sequence of the first transcription factor binding site containing the nucleic acid sequence of GGGAGGAG The nucleic acid regulatory sequence that contains SEQ ID NO:1-6 regulates not only the expression of the CRMP-1 gene, but also the expression of an exogenous gene that is operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence. The exogenous gene can be a reporter gene. Examples of the reporter gene includes a firefly luciferase gene, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene.\n\nThe firefly luciferase gene is a well-known reporter gene. The coding sequence of the firefly (photinus pyralis) luciferase has been cloned in the pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector and currently sold by Promega. This reporter gene provides a basis for the quantitative analysis of factors that potentially regulate mammalian gene expression. In the pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector (also known as pGL3 basic vector), the firefly luciferase gene coding region has been optimized for monitoring transcriptional activity in transfected eukaryotic cells. The assay of this genetic reporter is rapid, sensitive and quantitative.\n\nGreen Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene is another well-known reporter gene. GFP is a protein produced by a jellyfish Aequorea, which fluoresces in the lower green portion of the visible spectrum. The gene for GFP has been isolated and has become a useful tool for making expressed proteins fluorescent by creating chimeric genes composed of those of GFP and its different color variants linked to genes of proteins of interest. One may thus have an in vivo fluorescent protein, which may be followed in a living system. GFP has several different color variants. The GFP and GFP color variant vectors for gene cloning and construction are available from Clontech.\n\nThe reporter gene can be operatively linked to the nucleic acid regulatory sequence of the present invention via vectors to form a DNA or expression construct, which can then be transfected into a host cell. Specific vectors, which can be used to form the DNA construct are known in the art and include either a plasmid or a virus carrier. When the firefly luciferase gene is used as the reporter gene, the use of the pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector currently sold by Promega is preferred. When the green fluorescent protein gene is used as the reporter gene, the use of pGFP Vector currently sold by Clontech is preferred.\n\nIn designing the DNA constructs, it is not necessary to include the entire nucleic acid regulatory sequence (at positions â1920 to +50, SEQ ID NO:2), which covers the entire promoter and other regulatory regions of the CRMP-1 gene. A core promoter region (at positions â180 to +50, SEQ ID NO:3) or a minimum promoter region (at positions â180 to â100, SEQ ID NO:4) have shown to provide significant regulatory effects on CRMP-1 or reporter protein production. In addition, the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 (at positions â133 to â122) contains a regulatory factor binding site having the nucleic acid sequence of 5â²-GGGAGGAG-3â², which is preferred to be included in the DNA constructs.\n\nThe regulatory factor binding site could be a transcription factor binding site, such as the binding site for transcription factor Sp1. The SP1 transcriptional control sequence is found in a large number of viral and cellular promoters, including the HIV long terminal repeat. The SP1 transcription factor contains contiguous zinc finger motifs that provide specific DNA binding activity. Transcription factor Sp1 stimulates the basal activity of the minimal promoter through mechanisms that maintain the differential activity.\n\nAs shown by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the competition mobility shift assay, the antibody supershift assay, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), as shown in Examples 6 and 7, infra, the nucleic acid regulatory sequence of the present invention has the ability to bind to various proteins. The binding of the various proteins affects the regulatory capacity of the nucleic acid regulatory sequence, which in turn may affect the expression of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nThe following experimental designs are illustrative, but not limiting the scope of the present invention. Reasonable variations, such as those occur to reasonable artisan, can be made herein without departing from the scope of the present invention.\n\nEXAMPLES Example 1 Clonin of 5â²-Flanking Region of CRMP-1 Gene and Construction of Recombinant Plasmids\n\nConstruction of PCRMP-1 (â1920/+189).\n\nA 2.1-kb DNA fragment containing the 5â²-flanking region of hCRMP-1 gene (positions â1920 to +189 of human CRMP-1 gene (HCRMP-1), [SEQ ID NO:1]) was obtained by PCR amplification (Roche GC-rich PCR system) using two primers:\n\n(1) 5â²-CCGCTCGAGGCTTTGTACCGGCGAAATCT-3â² (sequence complementary to position â1920 to â1901, with an artificial XhoI site at the 5â²-end, [SEQ ID NO:7]); and\n\n(2) 5â²- CCCAAGCTTCGTGATTGTGCGGGATGCTCT-3â² (positions +170 to +189, with an artificial Hind III site at the 5â²-end [SEQ ID NO:8]).\n\nThe human BAC clone RP 11-69D13 (Invitrogen) was used as DNA template. This amplified fragment was cleaved with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into the XhoI/HindIII site at the upstream of luciferase gene of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The construct was designated as pCRMP-1 (â1920/+189) and the sequence of the amplified fragment was confirmed by sequence analysis.\n\nConstruction of PCRMP-1 (â1920/+50).\n\nThe 5â²-flanking region of hCRMP-1 gene (positions â1920 to +50 of hCRMP-1, [SEQ ID NO:2]) was amplified by using two PCR primers:\n\n(1) 5â²-CGCTAATTACGCCAGCCCAAG-3â² (positions 5023 to 5042 of pGL3-basic vector, [SEQ ID NO:9]) and (2) 5â²-CCCAAGCTTCCGGGAGGGATAGAGACAC-3â² (positions +32 to +50, with an artificial XhoI site at the 5â²-end, [SEQ ID NO:10]). The plasmid pCRMP-1(-1920/+189) was used as template DNA. This amplified DNA fragment was first digested with NotI and HindIII restriction endonucleases and inserted into the NotI/HindIII site of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The construct was designated as pCRMP-1(â1920/+50) and the sequence of the amplified fragment was confirmed by sequence analysis. %xl Example 2\n\nTransient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay\n\nHuman lung adenocarcinoma cells (CLIO) were plated out at a cell density of 1Ã105 cells/well of a 6-well culture plate and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) for 24 hours prior to transfection. One microgram of pCRMP-1(â1920/+50) DNA and 1 Î¼g of internal control plasmid DNA (pSV-Î²-galactosidase) were dissolved in serum free RPMI and complexed with 10 Î¼l Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The DNA/lipid complexes were allowed to anneal at room temperature for 45 minutes prior to their addition to CL1-0 cells. Cells were co-transfected by incubation with complexes for 6 hours at 37Â° C., 5% CO2. Medium was removed and cells which were washed twice with 1ÃPBS. 2 ml of RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were added to the cells to be incubated at 37Â° C., with 5% CO2. Cells were harvested after 36 hours of incubation and cellular extracts were obtained by using 250 Î¼l of lysis buffer (Tropix, Inc.) per well.\n\nHuman colon cancer cell lines CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 were developed in the laboratory of Advpharma Inc., in Taipei, Taiwan. These cell lines were deposited at the Food Industry Research and Development Institute (FIRDI) in Taiwan and registered with the numbers BCRC 60448, BCRC60449, and BCRC60450. Human colon cancer cells were plated according to the procedures well known to the artisans in the field. The cells were transfected with pCRMP-1 containing the full length CRMP-1 promoter (â1920/+50) and harvested according to the procedures described above.\n\nFor determination of luciferase and P-galactosidase activities, 20 Î¼l of cell extract were separately used. The assays were carried out by Luciferase assay kit and Galacto-Light Plusâ¢ system (Tropix, Inc.) on the luminometer (BERTHOLD Detection Systems Type Sirius 2C, Pforzheim, Germany).\n\nLuciferase activity mentioned in the following texts represents data that has been normalized with Î²-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity was used as an indication of gene expression in cells containing the indicated reporter DNA construct.\n\nExample 3 Analysis of The Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequence of CRMP-1 Gene\n\nSequential Truncation of 5â²-flanking region upstream of the CRMP-1 gene\n\nSequential deleted 5â² regulatory sequence mutants of CRMP-1 gene were constructed using the following method, to determine the function of the hCRMP-1 regulatory elements. All of the procedures shown below were according to the instructions in the Exo Mung Bean Deletion Kit (Stratagene) with some modifications. Briefly, the pCRMP-1(â1920/+50) was first digested with restriction endonucleases XhoI. The linealized plasmids were further treated with exonuclease III at 37Â° C. for different time intervals. Nine different sizes of plasmid fragments starting from position â1920 were obtained after phenol-chloroform extraction. The truncated plasmid fragments were then incubated with mung bean nuclease for 30 minutes at 37Â° C. after inactivation of the exonuclease III at 68Â° C. for 15 minutes. The resulting plasmid fragments were precipitated and ligated by T4 DNA ligase. Each truncated construct was transiently transfected into CL1-0 cells and its relevant luciferase activity was determined as described in Example 2.\n\nResults:\n\nThe Transcriptional Activities of Various Truncated Regulator Y Sequences.\n\nThe various constructs and their relevant luciferase activities in transfected human lung adenocarcinoma cells (CL1-0) were depicted schematically as shown in FIG. 1. The luciferase activities in various human colon cancer cells transfected with pCRMP-1 containing the full length CRMP-1 promoter (â1920/+50) were also detected (data not shown). Luciferase activity was firstly normalized to Î²-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity of cells transfected with control plasmid pGL3basic was set as baseline.\n\nDeletion of nucleotides â1920 to â180 did not significantly change the transcriptional activity, as compared to that of the pCRMP-1(â1920/+50) in CL1-0. The fragment from â180 to +50 exhibited promoter activity. Cells transfected with DNA constructs containing the reporter gene and the regulatory region from positions â99 to â180 were shown to enhance the transcriptional activities to 30Ë60 fold, in comparison to those in cells containing the control plasmid pGL3basic. Specifically, the transcriptional activities of the DNA construct pCRMP-1 (â180/+50) containing the nucleotides at positions â99 to â180 was increased up to 5-fold more than the activity of the pCRMP-1(â99/+50).\n\nExample 4 Identification of Regulatory Factor Binding Sites\n\nThe primary sequence analysis of the 5â²-flanking region of the CRMP-1 gene revealed that it was a TATA-less promoter. Several regulatory factor binding sites, such as Sp1 binding site, were predicted to be in the region between positions â180 and â99 with the help of a web tool Transcription Element Search System (TESS; http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess? RQ=WELCOME). Two regulatory factor binding sites containing GGGAGGAG-element were identified. This element has been listed as putative regulatory elements by a computational method for phylogenetic footprinting (Blanchette, M. and Tompa, M. (2002): Discovery of regulatory elements by a computational method for phylogenetic footprinting. Genome Research; http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.6902). The first regulatory factor binding site was located in the regions between positions â133 to â122 (5â²-GGGAGGAGCTGT-3â², SEQ ID NO:5). The second one is in the region from positions â115 to â100 (5â²-CCCCCTCCTCCCGCC-3â², SEQ ID NO:6) containing a GGGAGGAG-inverted sequence overlapped with other putative Sp1 binding site.\n\nResults:\n\nDeletion tudy of the regulatory factor binding sites. Two deletion DNA constructs, pCRMP-1(â116/+50) and pCRMP-1(â99/+50), were designed by removal of the first regulatory factor binding site and both sites, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the loss of the fragment between â180 to â117, which contains the first regulatory factor binding site, resulted in the reduction of almost 60% of the relative luciferase activity (pCRMP-1(â116/+50). The further 10 reduction up to 75% was observed after removal of both regulatory factor binding sites in pCRMP-1(â99/+50), as shown also in Table 1. These results indicated that both of the regulatory factor binding sites were essential for the basal transcriptional activity of the CRMP-1 gene promoter.\n\nTABLE 1 Deletion and Modified DNA Constructs Containing a Reporter Gene Encoding Luciferase and Their Relevant Luciferase Activity\n\nRel. Reporter Construct Description A(luc), % pCRMP-1(â180/+50) Containing the core promoter 100 sequence described as the wild type DNA construct in the mutation studies pCRMP-1(â99/+50) Loss of crucial part of sequence 24 Â± 10 pCRMP-1(â116/+50) Deletion of the fragment 42 Â± 3â between â180 to â117 (containing the first regulatory factor binding site) pCRMP-1-M12 Addition of tandem repeat of the 114 Â± 4â first regulatory factor binding site to 5â² end of the DNA construct pCRMP-1(â99/+50)\n\nNote:\n\nRel. A(luc) = Relative Luciferase Activity\n\nRecovery of the Transcriptional Activity by Adding an Artificial Tandem Repeat Containing the First Regulatory Factor Binding Site to the DNA Construct\n\nThe DNA construct pCRMP-1-M12 contained the original nucleic acid regulatory sequence at positions â99 to +50 and two additional artificial tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor binding site, which was at positions â133 to â122 upstream of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nA short oligonucleotide flanking with XhoI restriction sequence (5â²-CCGCTCGA CGGGAGGAGCTGTGGGAGGAGCTGTCTCGAGCGG-3â², SEQ ID NO:11) and its reverse sequence were chemically synthesized to form a short DNA double strand. The modified DNA construct (i.e., pCRMP-1-M12) was obtained by digestion of the double stranded oligonculeotide with endonuclease XhoI followed by ligation to the linealized (also with XhoI digested) DNA construct pCRMP-1(â99/+50). The relative luciferase activity of this mutant construct was 114% as compared to the wild-type DNA construct (See Table 1). This result clearly demonstrated that the addition of the 2 first regulatory factor binding sites not only restored but also in fact enhanced the expression capability of pCRMP-1(â99/+50) to the level of the wild type DNA construct pCRMP-1(â180/+50). (See Table 1).\n\nWithout the addition of the first regulatory factor binding site, the DNA construct pCRMP-1(â99/+50) showed about 24% relative luciferase activity and was used as a negative control, as opposite to the wild type pCRMP-1 (â180/+50) used as positive control (i.e, the luciferase activity of pCRMP-1(â180/+50) was used as 100%). (See Table 1). This result further suggests that the first regulatory factor binding site was crucial to the transcription and expression of the human CRMP-1 gene. Specifically, these two artificial tandem repeats of the first regulatory factor binding site could substitute the region for original sequence without any effect on relevant luciferase activity. Furthermore, the transcription and expression activity of this first regulatory factor binding site did not appear to be dependent on the exact position from the transcription start site of the CRMP-1 gene (i.e., the ATG start codon of exon-1 of the CRMP-1 gene).\n\nExample 5\n\nFunctional Analysis of Human CRMP-1 Basal Promoter Using Site-Directed Mutagenesis\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis method was applied for further sequence structure studies of possible binding sites in the nucleic acid regulatory sequence at positions â180 to â100 upstream from the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nMethods and Results:\n\nThe methods of making the mutant DNA constructs were shown below and the results of the mutant DNA constructs and their relevant luciferase activities are depicted in Table 2.\n\nMutations in the first regulatory factor binding site (Positions â133 to â122)\n\nFive mutant DNA constructs containing the reporter gene luciferase were designed on the base of the wild type DNA construct pCRMP-1(â180/+50). They were designated as pCRMP-1 M3, m3-2, m3-3, m3-4, and m3-5. All of them had the same length of 5â² end CRMP-1 promoter as the DNA construct pCRMP-1(â180/+50) except that each mutant represented a point mutation or a nucleic acid conversion which occurred at positions â133 to â122, as indicated in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the relative luciferase activities of mutants M3 and m3-4 were drastically reduced to almost half of that of the wild type (WT) DNA construct pCRMP-1(â180/+50). In addition, the mutations in mutants m3-2 and m3-3 demonstrated a reduction in transcription and expression activity of about 70% to 60%, respectively. (See Table 2). Moreover, the mutant construct M11, although having the same mutations as that of the pCRMP-1 M3, demonstrated an obvious loss (50%) of the relative luciferase activity, even though the 1.9 kb upstream regulatory sequence was intact in the DNA construct.\n\nMutations in the Second Regulatory Factor Binding Site (Positions â115 to â100)\n\nThe second regulatory binding site contains a GGGAGGAG-inverted sequence. No any obvious effects on the transcriptional activities were observed when the sequence structure at the region from position â115 to â100 (i.e., DNA constructs pCRMP1 M4 and M5) were disrupted. (See Table 2).\n\nMutations in Regions Other Than the Two Regulatory Factor Binding Sites\n\nThe mutant construct pCRMP-1 M1 with the mutations at the positions â171 and â170 (conversion of AG to GA) showed a reduction of transcription activity to 60%, as compared to that of the wild type DNA construct pCRMP-1(â180/+50). (See Table 2). A slight (i.e., about 20% reduction) loss of the transcription activity was observed, as the conversion of GC to AT at the positions â119 and â118 was conducted. (See Table 2). In addition, the transcription activity of the CRMP-1 gene was not effected when mutations were at positions â146 and â145 (i.e., with conversion of CT to TC) (Table 2, M2), at positions â135 and â134 (i.e., with conversion of CC to TT) (Table 2, m3-6), and at positions â121 and â120 (i.e., with conversion of CT to TC) (Table 2, m3-5).\n\nTABLE 2 Functional Analysie of Human CRMP-1 Basal Promoter Using Site-Directed Mutagenesis\n\nDNA Rel.

The reference for the relative activity of reporter DNA construct M11 was the wild type pCRMP-1(â1920/+50).\n\n*** means no mutation and no substitution\n\nIn sum, the results of the site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the first regulatory 10 factor binding site at positions â133 to â122 (5â²-GGGAGGAGCTGT-3â², SEQ ID NO:5) was essential for the regulation of the transcription and/or expression activity of the CRMP-1 gene.\n\nExample 6 Analysis of DNA-binding Proteins of the CRMP-1 Gene Nucleic Acid Regulatory Fragments\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThe major technique for identifying specific binding protein complexes in the nuclear extracts of the crmp-1 regulatory fragments was electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Its related method, antibody super-shift assay, further confirmed the involvement of the binding proteins (i.e., in the formation of DNA-protein complexes) in the CRMP-1 gene nucleic acid regulatory sequence.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), or gel shift assay, provides a simple method for detecting DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors (Buratowski et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, (1996): 12.2.1-12.2.11). This assay is based on the observation that DNA-protein complexes migrate through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel more slowly than free DNA fragments or double-stranded oligonucleotides. The gel shift assay was performed by incubating a purified protein, or a complex mixture of proteins (such as from cell nuclear extracts), with a 32P end-labeled DNA fragment containing the regulatory factor binding site. The specificity of the DNA-binding protein for the regulatory factor binding site was confirmed by competition experiments using unlabeled DNA fragments or oligonucleotides containing the regulatory factor binding sites of the CRMP-1 gene or other unrelated DNA sequence.\n\nPreparation of Nuclear Extracts.\n\nTwo different nuclear extracts were applied for the assays, which were HeLa nuclear extracts (Promega, USA) and CL1-0 nuclear extracts. They were prepared according to the method described by Dignam et al. (1983) (Dignam et al., Nucleic Acids Res., (1983), 11, 1475-1489).\n\nDNA Probes and Radioactive Labeling.\n\nThree double-stranded DNA probes were designed specifically for the motility shift assay. They were generated by chemical synthesis and annealing of the complementary oligonucleotides.\n\nDNA probe A contained tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor binding site sequence (5â²-GGGAGGAGCTGTGGGAGGAGCTGT -3â², SEQ ID NO:12).\n\nDNA probe B was the fragment from positions â117 to â100 (5â²-AGCCCCCTCCTCCCGCCC-3â², SEQ ID NO:13), containing a GGGAGGAG-inverted sequence.\n\nDNA probe C was the fragment from positions â137 to â100 (5â²-CGCCGGG AGGAGCTGTCTGCAGCCCCCTCCTCCCGCCC-3â², SEQ ID NO:14).\n\nRadioactive labeling of DNA probes was performed according to the instructions of Gel Shift Assay Systems (Technical Bulletin No. 110) provided by Promega (USA).\n\nProcedures for DNA-Protein binding reactions and electrophoresis were according to the instructions of Gel Shift Assay Systems (Technical Bulletin No. 110; Promega) with a few modifications. Standard DNA-Protein binding reaction was started with the incubation of 1-20 Î¼g of HeLa nuclear extract or CL1-0 nuclear extract at room temperature for 10 minutes in a binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)Â·poly(dI-dC)). Each reaction mixture was then mixed with a 32P-labeled probe and then incubated at room temperature for another 20 minutes. A tenth volume of a gel loading buffer, containing 250 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 0.2% bromophenol blue, and 40% glycerol, was added to each reaction mixture. Samples were electrophoresed for 100V at 4Â° C. after pre-running on the 4% PAGE gel in 1XTBE buffer.\n\nCompetition Mobility Shift Assay.\n\nThe assessment of the nucleic acid sequence specificity of protein-DNA interactions were achieved by applying the competition binding assay (Carthew et al., Cell (1985), 43: 439-448). Unlabeled DNA probes for the competition assay were pre-incubated with nuclear extract in a binding buffer before the adding of the 32P end-labeled DNA probe. In this study, an additional mutant DNA probe was also used for the competition assay to confirm the specificity of DNA-protein complex, except for the three DNA probes (i.e., DNA probes A, B, and C) used in the standard binding reaction. The sequence of the mutant DNA probe was 5â²-AAAGGGGACTACAAAGGGGACTAC-3â² (SEQ ID NO:15), which contained several nucleotide substitutions of the DNA probe A.\n\nAntibody Supershift Assay.\n\nA variation of the mobility shift DNA-binding assay was applied which used antibodies to identify proteins present in the protein-DNA complex (Kristie et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. (1986), 83:3218-3222). A specific antibody was added to a binding reaction, in order to decide, whether a suspected protein, e.g., a transcription factor, involved in the formation of the DNA-protein complex in gel shift study. No effect should be observed when the protein recognized by the antibody was not involved in the complex formation. Two different expectations would be seen, i.e., either the complex formation was inhibited, or an antibody-protein-DNA ternary complex was formed. The latter could result in a further reduction in the mobility of the protein-DNA complex (i.e., supershift).\n\nPurified recombinant Sp1 protein was purchased from Promega (USA). The Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts and DNA probes for 30 min.\n\nResults\n\nMotility Shift Assay with the DNA Probe A.\n\nThree specific DNA-protein complexes (P1, P2, and P3) were identified in the HeLa nuclear extracts using the DNA probe A containing the tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor binding site (FIG. 3A, lane 1). However, these DNA-protein complexes could be eliminated when an excess of 50-fold and 100-fold of the cold and unlabeled DNA probe A were competing in the competition mobility shift assay (FIG. 3A, lane 2 and lane 3). The DNA-protein complex P3 could also be inhibited by the unlabeled DNA probe B (FIG. 3A, lane 6 and lane 7), which contains a GGGAGGAG-inverted element. As expected, none was competed out by the unlabeled mutant DNA probe (FIG. 3A, lane 4 and lane 5). The results of this assay indicated that protein(s) formed in the complex P3 might be specific to the GGGAGGAG-element, since DNA probe A and DNA probe B contain the same element.\n\nTwo specific DNA-protein complexes were found in the CL1-0 nuclear extracts. They appeared to be equivalent to the DNA-protein complex P1 and P3 (FIG. 3A, lane 9) observed as well as in the binding reaction using HeLa nuclear extracts, because of their similar motility on the PAGE gel.\n\nMotility Shift Assay with the DNA Probe B.\n\nOne major DNA-protein complex P4 could be detected both in the HeLa nuclear extracts and in the CL1-0 nuclear extracts using the 32P end-labelled DNA probe B (FIG. 3B, lane 1 and lane 8, respectively). The gel shift analysis shows the specificity of DNA-protein complex after the competition assay using the same unlabeled DNA fragment at the amount of an excess of 50-fold and 100-fold, respectively (FIG. 3B, lane 2 and lane 3). This DNA-protein complex disappeared when an excess of 50-fold and 100-fold unlabeled DNA probe A was added respectively (FIG. 3B, lane 4 and lane 5). The binding reaction with an excess of mutant DNA probe, as a negative control, was not able to compete with the specific DNA binding protein (FIG. 3B, lane 6 and lane 7). This gel shift study further confirmed that DNA probe A and DNA probe B possessed the same competition ability, since both contain the same sequence element (GGGAGGAG). Specifically, complex P3 and P4 might consist of the same components.\n\nMotility Shift Assay with the DNA Probe C.\n\nFour DNA-protein complexes P5, P6, P7, and P8 with decreasing molecular size in the HeLa nuclear extracts interacted with 32P end-labelled DNA probe C were observed (FIG. 3C, lane 1). Three (P5, P6, and P7) of them appeared to be specific, since they were not detectable with an excess of 100-fold and 200-fold same unlabeled DNA probe C (FIG. 3C, lane 2 and lane 3). Competition assay with an excess of the mutant DNA probe shared the same pattern of the DNA-protein complexes as the standard binding assay (FIG. 3C, lane 6 and lane 7). The DNA-protein complex P5 and P6 were specifically competed by an excess of 100-fold and 200-fold of DNA probe A containing tandem repeat of the first regulatory factor element (FIG. 3C, lane 4 and lane 5), but not by the DNA probe B (FIG. 3C, lane 8 and lane 9). The DNA-protein complex P7 was assumed to be specific to the DNA probe B because it disappeared in the competition assay (FIG. 3C, lane 8 and lane 9). There could be additional protein(s), or transcription factor(s), specifically responsible for binding to the first regulatory factor binding site.\n\nThree DNA-protein complexes were observed binding to DNA probe C using CL1-0 nuclear extracts. They showed very similar motilities to those of the complex P5, P6, and P8 in the HeLa nuclear extracts (FIG. 3C, lane 11).\n\nAntibody Supershift Assay of DNA-protein Complex.\n\nThe DNA-protein complex P1 with the slowest motility was supershifted by the addition of an anti-Sp1 antibody in the binding reaction (FIG. 3A, lane 8). The same effect could be seen for DNA Probe C-containing binding reaction (FIG. 3C, lane 10). A supershift effect of the DNA-protein complex with the slowest motility was confirmed by incubating CL1-0 nuclear extract with DNA probe A and with DNA probe C (data not shown).\n\nMotility Shift Assay with Additional Sp1 Protein.\n\nA further study to confirm the presence of Sp1 protein-forming complex was performed using the motility shift assay with additional Sp1 protein. We added extra 5 ng or 50 ng recombinant Sp1 protein to the binding reaction which contained the HeLa nuclear extract and 32P-labeled DNA probe A or DNA probe C. Stronger intensity of the DNA-protein complex with the slowest motility on gel shift assay was clearly found for both DNA probe A and DNA probe C (FIG. 3D, lane 1-3 and lane 4-6, respectively). The binding of Sp1 protein on the regulatory factor binding sites might be indirectly through the association with the other elements, since no signal was detected without the presence of nuclear extract (FIG. 3D, lane 7 and lane 8).\n\nSummary of Motility Gel Shift Study Combined with Antibody Supershift Assay\n\nThe results shown above demonstrated that at least one type of Sp1 protein might be specifically involved in the formation of the DNA-protein complex by the application of commercial available specific anti-Sp1 antibody. It could further conclude that there were at least two other specific DNA-protein complexes required in the regulation of the transcription activity of CRMP-1 promoter.\n\nExample 7 Transcriptional Regulation of SP1 Binding Protein for CRMP-1 Gene Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nTransient Co-transfection of Reporter DNA Constructs and Sp1 Protein-expressing Constructs.\n\nTwo reporter DNA constructs, pCRMP-1(â180/+50) and pCRMP-1(â99/+50), were separately transient co-transfected into DNA construct pSG5-Sp1 for over-expression of Sp1 protein. DNA construct pSG5 was used as the control in the cell line CL1-0. Both DNA constructs, pSG5-Sp1 and pSG5, were kindly provided from Dr. Robert Tjian. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nCL1-0 cells were harvested after 24 h cultivation for RNA isolation using RNA-Beeâ¢ kit. One microgram of total RNA was applied for reverse transcription reaction and 1/25 volume of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was further used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Invitrogen). Three pairs of specific primers were designed for hCRMP-1, Sp-1, and Gp like gene expression study, as follows:\n\nPrimer pair for hCRMP-1: sense primer\n\n(SEQ ID NO:16)\n\n5â²-ATGCCCTGAGCAGACCTGAAGAGC-3â² and antisense primer\n\n(SEQ ID NO:17)\n\n5â²-AGTAATGGGTGCCATCGGTCCCCAG-3â². Primer pair for Sp-1: sense primer\n\n(SEQ ID NO:18)\n\n5â²-GAGAGTGGCTCACAGCCTGTC-3â² and antisense primer\n\n(SEQ ID NO:19)\n\n5â²-GTTCAGAGCATCAGACCCCTG-3â². Primer pair for GÎ²âlike (Shan, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. (1992) 12, 5620-5631) sense primer\n\n(SEQ ID NO:20)\n\n5â²-GTAGGAACCTGGCTAACTG-3â² and antisense primer\n\n(SEQ ID NO:21)\n\n5â²-TACTGATAACTTCTTGCTTC-3â².\n\nThe expression of GÎ² like was served as an internal control for RNA quantity. All results were visualized using ethidium bromide staining.\n\nResults\n\nThe negative role of Sp1 in the crmp-1 promoter. The relative luciferase was used as indicator for the effect of over-expressed Sp I protein on regulatory activity. The over-expressed Sp1 protein in the cells co-transfected with the reporter construct pCRMP-1(â180/+50) resulted in the nearly 50% reduction of relative luciferase activity, in comparison with the cells without over-expression of Sp1 protein. As expected, no particular effect on the cells transfected with pCRMP-1(â99/+50) could be observed with or without over-expressed Sp1 protein, since the putative Sp1 binding sites are missing on this reporter DNA construct.\n\nReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate the RNA level for CRMP-1 gene, Sp1 gene and GÎ² like gene. The presence of the CRMP-1 RNA level was significantly decreased, as Sp1 protein was over-expressed in cells (FIG. 4). The RNA level of the GÎ² like gene (a house keeping gene used as the experimental control) showed similar RNA level (FIG. 4). As expected, the RNA level of Sp1 was noticeably higher in cells transfected with Sp1 over-expressed DNA construct. These results confirmed that the Sp1 protein might possibly act as a negative regulator for CRMP-1 expression.\n\nWhile the invention has been described by way of examples and in term of the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.
