It is required for signalling by class 3 semaphorins and remodelling of the cytoskeleton. It also plays a role in axon guidance, neuronal growth cone collapse and cell migration. It exists as a homotetramer, and heterotetramer with CRMP1, DPYSL2, DPYSL4 or DPYSL5. The unprocessed precursor is 570 amino acids long and has an estimated molecular weight of 61.9 kDa. It is mainly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle but is also strongly expressed in fetal brain and spinal cord. It localises to the cytoplasm and growth cone. This protein interacts with synaptic vesicle protein 2 and SH3A domain of intersectin.\n\nShipping Temperature 25°C (ambient)\n\nUNSPSC CODE 41116161\n\nRegulatory Status For research use only."
