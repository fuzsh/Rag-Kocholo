        "text": "Abstract\n\nLanthionine ketimine ([LK] 3, 4-dihydro-2H-1,4-thiazine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid) is the archetype for a family of naturally occurring brain sulfur amino acid metabolites, the physiologic function of which is unknown. Lanthionine ketimine and its synthetic derivatives have recently demonstrated neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and antineuroinflammatory properties in vitro through a proposed mechanism involving the microtubule-associated protein collapsin response mediator protein 2. Therefore, studies were undertaken to test the effects of a bioavailable LK ester in the 3×Tg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Lanthionine ketimine ester treatment substantially diminished cognitive decline and brain amyloid-A (AA) peptide deposition and phospho-Tau accumulation in 3×Tg-AD mice and also reduced the density of Iba1 -positive microglia. Furthermore, LK ester treatment altered collapsin response mediator protein 2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that LK may not be a metabolic waste but rather a purposeful neurochemical, the synthetic derivatives of which constitute a new class of experimental therapeutics for Alzheimer disease and related entities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by clinical dementia combined with the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that together contribute to neurodegeneration (1–5). Amyloid-β plaques develop relatively early in AD and are believed to trigger or accelerate NFT formation through indirect mechanisms such as induction of oxidative stress, impairment of phosphorylation equilibria, and promotion of neuroinflammation (1). Neurofibrillary tangles are composed largely but not exclusively of hyperphosphorylated paired helical filament-Tau (PHF-Tau) and compromise neural structure, synaptic function, and viability (2). Although PHF-Tau is the dominant NFT component, NFTs contain many other proteins of possible pathogenic relevance.\n\nAmong the more intriguing of these NFT-associated proteins is the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) (3–6). Like Tau, CRMP2 is a microtubule-associated protein that is hyperphosphorylated in AD by the same cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk-5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β enzymes that act on Tau (7). However, CRMP2 is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from Tau (8, 9). Normally, CRMP2 stabilizes microtubules by binding tubulin (10) and facilitates protein trafficking by adapting kinesin-1 to protein cargo packages including neurotrophin receptors (11), actin nucleation factors (which are important to maintenance of synapse stability [12]), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (13, 14). Most APP conversion to Aβ occurs during intracellular transit in early endosomes or within axons (15–17). Disruption of the CRMP2-binding partner Numb (14) inhibits Numb-dependent APP internalization and diminishes intracellular amyloidogenesis (13). Manipulating CRMP2-dependent processes might, therefore, affect progression of AD pathology, specifically, APP processing and microtubule stability.\n\nWe recently reported that a brain sulfur amino acid metabolite, lanthionine ketimine ([LK] 3,4-dihydro-2H-1, 4-thiazine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid), binds CRMP2 and alters its protein-protein interactions (18). A cell-penetrating ester derivative (LKE) exhibits potent neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and antineuroinflammatory properties in vitro (18, 19). Therefore, studies were undertaken to determine whether LKE could slow disease progression in a mouse model of AD (3×Tg-AD mice) that is characterized by both AA and NFT accumulation concomitant with neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits (20, 21). The 3×Tg-AD mouse also shows accumulation of phosphorylated CRMP2 aggregates within NFTs in ternary complex with both phospho-Tau and WAVE1 (5), making this model particularly relevant to the study of CRMP2 biology.\n\nHere, 3 × Tg-AD mice were administered LKE in 3 separate experiments, beginning either before or after the onset of discernible disease; the mice were tested for cognitive function, and their brains were examined by histology and biochemistry. Lanthionine ketimine ester diminished all 3 hallmark features of AD-like disease: Aβ burden, phospho-Tau accumulation, and cognitive deficits while reducing microglial activation. In vitro, LKE significantly reduced Aβ production by SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, with potency comparable to that of the prototype γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), without concomitant neurotoxicity. These results suggest that LK derivatives may have potential for treating AD and raise the question of whether endogenous lanthionine metabolites naturally function in amyloid processing or regulation of neural structural plasticity.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nChemistry\n\nR-LK-5-ethyl ester (LKE) was synthesized from 3-bromopyruvate (TCI-America, Portland, OR) and L-cysteineethyl ester HCl (Alfa-Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) (18, 19). For ad libitum studies, LKE was formulated at 1,000 ppm (100 mg/kg per mouse per day) into AIN93M rodent diets (Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA), blind-coded “A” or “B,” and stored at −80°C until the week of use.\n\nAnimals\n\nMale and female homozygous 3×Tg-AD mice expressing transgenic Swedish mutant human APP (APPswe), transgenic mutant TauP301L, and knock-in mutant presenilin-1 (PS1M146V) (21) were used. In the intraperitoneal (i.p.) study, mice were treated with 100 mg/kg per day LKE in physiologic saline or with vehicle only (n = 7 mice per group). In the ad libitum studies, 4-month-old (n = 11−12 mice per group) or 7-month-old (n = 9−10 mice per group) were fed control or LKE-treated diets as previously described; they were housed under a standard 12-hour light:dark cycle and given free access to food and water. Animal and food hopper weights were audited throughout the study. Male and female nontransgenic (NonTg) control mice were the same background strain as the 3×Tg-AD mice (C57BL6/129SVJ). All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the Veterans Administration—Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n\nRadial Arm Maze\n\nIntraperitoneal injection study mice and ad libitum study mice (after 4 months of treatment; aged 7–11 months) were tested for spatial memory using the radial arm maze (RAM) following the methods of Olton and Samuelson (22). The RAM consisted of 8 equally spaced arms (35 cm long × 5 cm wide × 9 cm high) radiating from a small circular central platform (ANY-maze; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). The maze was elevated 94 cm above the floor, with static visual cues surrounding the perimeter. Mice were fasted to 90% of their body weight before RAM training. For the first phase of behavioral training, mice were habituated to the maze for 7 consecutive days. During habituation, three 20-mg sucrose pellets were placed at the distal end of all arms. Mice were released to the center platform and allowed to explore freely. Arm visits and sucrose pellet consumption were recorded for 5 minutes during each daily habituation trial. After habituation, the second phase of training began. Four arms of the RAM were randomly selected and baited with sucrose pellets. Baited arms remained the same for each mouse throughout the training trials. Mice were released to the center platform, and arm visits were recorded. The training trial was considered complete when all 4 pellets were consumed or 5 minutes have elapsed. Two types of errors were recorded: working memory errors (WMEs) were revisits to arms that had been previously baited on the same training trial, and reference memory errors (RMEs) were visits to any of the 4 unbaited arms. In this phase of training, mice were trained for 11 consecutive days. The maze was wiped clean after each training trial using towels dampened with an unscented mild soap solution.\n\nMorris Water Maze\n\nTo test hippocampal-dependent spatial cognition in the ad libitum study groups, 15-month-old mice were trained in the standard Morris water maze (MWM) with a hidden platform, as previously described with minor modifications (23, 24). The MWM consisted of a white, circular, water-filled pool (diameter, 1.20 m; height, 0.5 m at 24°C; maintained by a thermostat-driven heating system attached to the underside of the water tank), opacified by white powdered tempura paint. The tank was surrounded by solid white curtains to eliminate distractions. Three solid black cues (different shapes) were affixed to the inside walls of the tank at 3 locations (north, east, and west). A white escape platform (diameter, 15 cm; height, 24 cm) was located 1 cm below the water surface in a fixed position (northeast quadrant, 22 cm away from the wall). In each daily swim block (4 swim trials per block, 30-second intertrial interval, 5 blocks total), mice were placed at one of the starting locations, facing the wall, in random order (north, south, east, west, including permutations of the 4 starting points per session), and were allowed to swim until they located the platform. Mice failing to find the platform within 60 seconds were placed on it for 15 seconds (the same period as the successful animals). Mice floating/not actively searching for the platform or demonstrating more than 80% thigmotaxing behavior were eliminated from the analysis. A probe trial was performed 24 hours after the final training block. The platform was removed from the pool, and the mice performed a 60-second swim. At the end of every trial, the mice were allowed to dry for 15 minutes in a heated enclosure and were returned to their home cage. The cued session was performed to test swimming speed and visual acuity. A visible platform was elevated 1 cm above the water, and its position was clearly indicated by a visible cue (black tape around the elevated portion of the platform). White curtains surrounded the maze, but no other cues were visible except the black-taped platform. The cued test (4 trials) was performed 1 week before the hidden training protocol. HVS Image software (HVS Image, Mountain View, CA) was used to capture and analyze the MWM data.\n\nBarnes Maze\n\nThe method used in our laboratory was adapted from a recently published protocol and review article (25). A 20-hole Barnes maze apparatus was used (ANY-maze). White curtains are used around the maze to reduce room cues. Three cues were placed in close proximity to the maze for use in spatial navigation. In the pretraining trial, the mouse was placed in the middle of the maze under a dark colored box, allowing the mouse to be in random orientation before each trial. After 10 seconds had elapsed, the chamber was lifted and the mouse was allowed to explore the maze for 3 minutes. Aversive stimuli (sounds, wind, harsh lighting) were not used. Errors and latency were recorded during acquisition and testing. Errors were defined as nose pokes and head deflections over any hole that does not have the target box. Latency was defined as the time it takes to locate the target box. Mice were trained for 4 trials per day for 4 days, with an intertrial interval of at least 15 minutes. The entire maze was cleaned with an unscented mild dilute soap solution after each trial. Mice not actively moving throughout the maze were eliminated from the analysis. At 48 hours after the last training trial, a probe trial was conducted to evaluate short-term memory retention. ANY-maze software was used to capture and analyze the data.\n\nNesting Behavior\n\nThe nest-building task was administered, with slight modifications as previously described (26). Nest building is dependent on step-by-step planning and organization, shown in many tests to be sensitive to lesions of the prefrontal cortex (27). Mice were individually housed and given a cotton nestlet and equivalent numbers of corrugated brown paper strips and given 24 hours to construct a nest. Cages were photographed, and the presence and quality of nests were scored by 3 independent raters on a scale from 0 to 5, with a 0 score being an untouched cotton nestlet and a 5 being a perfectly round 4-walled nest that integrates both nesting materials and nearly conceals the mouse within it.\n\nTissue Collection\n\nAt the end of behavior testing (15 months of age), animals were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg pentobarbital, and a blood sample was taken via cardiac puncture, followed by cardiac perfusion with HEPES buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 4.6 mmol/L NaCl, 4.6 mmol/L KCl, 1.1 mmol/L KH2PO4, 0.6 mmol/L MgSO4, and 1.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Hippocampus and cortex were dissected from 1 hemisphere, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80°C. The contralateral hemisphere was immersion fixed in formalin (Fisher) for 24 hours, followed by stepwise (10%-20%-30%) sucrose cryopreservation and embedding in preparation for cryostat sectioning.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nFormalin-fixed cryopreserved brains were sagittally sectioned on a Leica cryostat at 50-μm thickness and stored at −20°C until immunolabeling. Immunohistochemical labeling was performed on free-floating sections using a VectaStain 1:1000; Covance, Emeryville, CA); 12F4 (specific to the c-terminus of Aβ specific for the isoform ending at the 42nd amino acid, 1:1000; Covance); AT8 (phospho-Tau, 1:1000; Thermo Scientific); Iba-1 (microglia, 1:800; Wako, Richmond, VA). Sections were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped using Permount mounting media (Fisher). Specificity of antibody immunoreactivity was confirmed by elimination of the primary antibody during the staining procedure. This negative control staining resulted in absence of staining for these antibodies.\n\nDesign-based stereology was used to quantify the total number of 6E10-positive cells in the subicular-CA1-CA2 region of the hippocampus. This study used the optical fractionator method, a stereologic technique of unbiased cell counting within a defined volume, using Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT). Briefly, sections were viewed with a Nikon E600 microscope with a motorized stage interfaced with a computer running the Stereo Investigator program. The region of interest was identified on slide-mounted sections and delineated for each section of each animal under a 2× objective based on the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (28). Every 12th section was analyzed for a total of 5 sections per mouse beginning at 0.9 mm from the midline and ending at 3.9 mm from the midline. All samplings were done under a 60× oil immersion objective.\n\n6E10, 12F4, AT8, and Iba-1 labeling intensities were measured using Image-Pro software (Media Cybernetics) to quantify images of the subiculum-CA1-CA2 regions from 5 brain sections per mouse. Light intensity remained static during the acquisition of images for analysis, and all images were treated identically; data are expressed as a percentage of control mean.\n\nThioflavin-S Staining\n\nAir-dried brain sections mounted onto glass slides were stained for thioflavin-S, as previously described (29). Briefly, slides were dehydrated in ethanol (80%/70%), followed by a 15-minute incubation in a thioflavin-S solution (1% in 80% ethanol; 0.2 μm filtered), followed by ethanol and distilled water rinses, and mounting in aqueous mounting media. Stained plaques were visualized using fluorescent microscopy. Total plaque counts and volume measurements in the subicular/CA1 region were performed on 3 brain sections per mouse using the volume estimator function in MBF software.\n\nCell Culture\n\nSH-SY5Y cells (human neuroblastoma; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely passed by trypsinization. Cells were plated onto 24-well culture plates at 150,000 cells per well or T25 flasks at 1.8 × 106 cells per flask and maintained for 4 days before treatment. Lanthionine ketimine ester (100 mmol/L in saline) and DAPT (100 mmol/L in DMSO) were diluted into culture medium before cell application. Cells were treated for a total of 96 hours without intervening media changes with a small aliquot of media taken at 48 hours for analysis of Aβ or lactate dehydrogenase release (CytoTox 96 Nonradioactive Cytotoxicity Assay; Promega, Madison, WI). After removal of culture media, cells were analyzed using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega). The One Solution contains MTS, a tetrazolium compound bioreduced by mitochondria into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium and correlates with viability.\n\nELISAs and Western Blots\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure brain Aβ(1–40) and PHF-Tau epitopes in brain cortices and hippocampi and in undiluted culture media. One cerebral hemicortex from each mouse was lysed by sonication in 1 mL of CHAPS lysis buffer ([CLB] 20 mmol/L MES buffer pH 5.5, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate, 1:200 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO]). Portions of the lysate were used for Western blot analyses and ELISAs.\n\nOne hippocampal cortex from each mouse was lysed by sonication in 0.4 mL of Tris-buffered saline ([TBS] 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4) and centrifuged 5 minutes at 16,000 × g. Pellets were reconstituted in 80 ΜL of 5 mol/L guanidine HCl (GuHCl), pH 7.4. Both TBS and GuHCl fractions were assayed, but TBS samples contained negligible Aβ(1–40). Cortical Aβ(1–40) was normalized to protein as measured by Lowry assay, whereas hippocampal Aβ(1–40) was reported as picograms per milligram tissue wet weight because the GuHCl prevented accurate determination of total protein concentration. Amyloid-β(1–40), total Tau, and pTau(396) ELISAs were purchased from Invitrogen. The pTau(181) ELISA (Innotest pTau[181P]) was purchased from Innogenetics (Ghent, Belgium); the soluble APP (sAPP) ELISAs were purchased from IBL International (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).\n\nFor Western blots, tissue was lysed in either CLB or TBS plus 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmol/L, and β-glycerophosphate, 1:200 mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifugation for 5 minutes at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was assayed for protein content by Lowry assay and adjusted to constant concentration, then mixed 1:1 with reducing sample buffer and electrophoresed across 4% to 20% precast polyacrylamide gels (NuSep). Gels were blotted to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and blocked overnight in 4% bovine serum albumin, and immunochemistry was conducted with the following antibodies: anti-actin monoclonal antibody, clone AC15 (Sigma); CRMP2 polyclonal antibody (AB9218; Millipore, Billerica, MA) or CRMP2-p515 polyclonal (a gift from Dr. Kozo Kaibuichi of Nagoya Graduate University, Nagoya, Japan); anti-β-III-tubulin monoclonal (MAB5564; Millipore) or anti-β-tubulin polyclonal (AB6046; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham).\n\nReal-time Quantitative PCR Analysis of Human APP Gene Expression\n\nSamples were stored in RNAlater (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at −20°C. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma) and BCP (MRC, Cincinnati, OH) as a phase separation reagent. RNA was purified using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was quantified spectrophotometrically. RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using an ABI 7300\n\nSequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), was performed for quantification of human APP (hAPP). The amounts of mouse hAPP mRNA were determined by amplification of the cDNA target using the RT2 qPCR Primer Assay for hAPP (catalog PPH05947A; Qiagen). 18S rRNA (catalog PPM57735E; Qiagen) served as a housekeeping gene to normalize hAPP mRNA to possible differences in quantity of cDNA templates. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of hAPP and 18S rRNA genes were carried out in conjunction with RT2 qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen). Each cDNA sample was tested in triplicate. The following temperature parameters were cycled for 40 times: 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute at 60°C. Standard curves were constructed for 18S rRNA as an internal standard and for hAPP gene. The amount of hAPP mRNA gene expression was normalized by division by the amount of 18SrRNA mRNA in each sample and expressed as fold increases in comparison with control values.\n\nStatistics\n\nAll data were graphically presented as mean T SEM unless otherwise specified. In the case of single mean comparisons, data were analyzed by 2-tailed unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests appropriate to data distributions. In the case of multiple comparisons, data were analyzed by 1- or 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad).\n\nResults\n\nLKE Is Orally Bioavailable and Well Tolerated\n\nWe have previously administered LKE i.p. in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (19). Subsequently, we developed a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to help guide selection of better routes of delivery for longer studies. Gavage administration of LKE at a 100-mg/kg bolus resulted in appreciable blood concentrations; i.p. dosage resulted in blood (Supplemental Digital Content 1, part A, Supplementary Data) and brain parenchymal (Supple mental Digital Content 1, part B, Supplementary Data) LKE, whereas a 10-mg/kg intravenous LKE bolus resulted in peak brain:blood LKE ratio of 18% (Supplemental Digital Content 1, part C, Supplementary Data). Because studies in 3×Tg-AD mice necessarily require many months of chronic dosing, we explored incorporation of LKE into the diet. Feeding C57BL/6 mice an AIN93M diet formulated to contain 1 ppt LKE (daily dosage ~100 mg/kg per day) resulted in a steady blood plasma concentration of 2 to 4 μmol/L LKE (Supplemental Digital Content 1, part D, Supplementary Data). Therefore, we used both the i.p. and oral routes of LKE administration for studies in the 3×Tg-AD mouse expressing transgenic mutant hAPP with Swedish mutation (APPswe), transgenic mutant TauP301L, and knock-in mutant presenilin-1 (PS1M146V) (21). The 3×Tg-AD mice displayed no difference in measured food consumption between LKE-containing and standard AIN93M diets (data not shown). Lanthionine ketimine ester did not affect short-term weight gain in 3 × Tg-AD mice nor were any changes noted in blood chemistry parameters as a function of the experimental diet (data not shown). Lanthionine ketimine ester—treated mice had slightly but significantly improved weight retention at latter ages, as discussed below (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Supplementary Data).\n\nLKE Improves Cognition in Aging 3×Tg-AD Mice\n\nThree separate studies were undertaken to assess effects of LKE administration on cognition and pathology of aging 3×Tg-AD mice. These mice demonstrate intracellular amyloid accumulation at 3 to 4 months of age and extracellular amyloid deposits at 6 months of age, with p-tau epitopes developing at 12 to 15 months. The studies were designed to begin LKE treatment either before or after the presence of extracellular amyloid deposition (21). In the first study, 7-month-old mice (5 males/2 females each treatment group) were injected daily with 100 mg/kg LKE (i.p. in saline) or vehicle only for 8 weeks. Mice were then tested for cognitive function using an 8-arm RAM. Lanthionine ketimine ester—treated mice made significantly fewer WMEs and tended toward reduced RME compared with saline-treated mice (WME, 2.50 ± 0.35 for control mice vs 1.25 ± 0.35 for LKE-treated mice, p < 0.04; RME, 4.50 ± 0.38 for control mice vs 2.74 ± 0.70 for LKE-treated mice, p < 0.01; n = 7 mice per group) (Supplemental Digital Content 3, part A, Supplementary Data). At study termination, blood chemistry indices of liver and kidney function in LKE-fed mice were well within normal ranges (data not shown).\n\nThe second study was a blinded ad libitum study designed to avoid stress from repeated drug injection, increase the total drug treatment duration, and remove any unintentional conformational bias on the part of animal observers. In this study, 7-month-old 3 ×Tg-AD mice (7 males/2 females in the control group and 7 males/3 females in the LKE group) were fed either a standard AIN93M diet or the same diet formulated with 1 ppt LKE (~100 mg/kg per mouse per day). Both diets were coded at the source to blind observers and analysts to treatment groups. Mice were weighed weekly and cognitively assessed by RAM using methods identical to those previously described. Similar to the case for the i.p. treatment protocol, 3×Tg-AD mice fed the LKE-containing diet from 7 to 11 months displayed significantly fewer WMEs in the RAM learning task than did 3×Tg-AD mice on the basal diet (Supplemental Digital Content 3, part B, Supplementary Data). Reference memory errors were not significantly affected by LKE treatment.\n\nThe same ad libitum—treated mice were maintained on their respective diets until 15 months of age and then tested in an MWM, wherein the mice were trained to learn the location of a submerged platform that would allow escape from a training pool. After 5 days of training, LKE-treated mice had significantly reduced latency to platform escape versus control mice (Fig. 1A). Lanthionine ketimine ester—treated mice had reduced average distance from the platform (Gallagher Proximity Index) during a 24-hour retention probe trial (Fig. 1B). However, LKE-treated mice did not perform as well as NonTg control mice during the training trials or on the retention probe trial. Nest building has previously been shown to be sensitive to amyloid pathology (26). Nestlet building competency scores in the LKE-treated mice were significantly greater than those of the untreated group, with no scores less than 4 in the LKE group (Supplemental Digital Content 3, part C, Supplementary Data).\n\nIn this ad libitum experiment, mouse food intake did not differ significantly between the treatment groups; however, mice receiving LKE had a slightly but significantly greater weight (nonsignificant difference at 7 months of age but +13% mean difference at 11 months and +15% mean difference at 15 months of age; p < 0.05 for both latter time points) (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Supplementary Data). No adverse indications were observed in LKE-treated mice during treatment or at necropsy with respect to behavior, gross pathology, blood chemistry measures, or microscopic evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin—stained tissue sections of non-CNS tissues (i.e. liver, kidney, heart, lungs, spleen) (data not shown).\n\nA second ad libitum LKE administration study identical to the first, except that mice began treatment 3 months earlier, at 4 months of age (7 males/4 females in the control group and 7 males/5 females in the LKE group), was undertaken. At 15 months of age, MWM analysis revealed greatly improved performance in LKE-treated mice compared with control mice on days 2 to 5 of the training period (Fig. 1C). Lanthionine ketimine ester—treated 3×Tg mouse performance was not statistically different from NonTg control mouse performance. Similarly, retention probe trial performance in LKE-treated mice was significantly better than that in control mice but not statistically different from NonTg control mice (Fig. 1D). At 1 week after the conclusion of MWM testing, a Barnes maze analysis was conducted (Fig. 1E, F). Four days of training followed by a 24-hour retention probe trial revealed that LKE-treated 3×Tg mice performed significantly better than control mice and nearly identically to NonTg control mice (Fig. 1E, F). The single difference between LKE-treated mice and NonTg mice was that NonTg mice learned the task faster (peak performance at day 3 in NonTg and day 4 in LKE-treated mice).\n\nLKE Alters Proteolytic APP Processing and Reduces Aβ(1–40/42) Burden of Aging 3×Tg-AD Mice\n\nImmunohistochemistry using the 6E10 monoclonal anti-APP/Aβ antibody (30) indicated a reduction of labeling intensity in mice that had received ad libitum LKE from 7 to 15 months (Fig. 2A–D). This labeling intensity difference was significant (Fig. 2E). Likewise, LKE treatment reduced the number of 6E10-positive neurons (Fig. 2F). Consistent with prior reports (30), 6E10 labeling of the 3×Tg-AD mouse brain revealed both Aβ plaques and substantial intracellular Aβ that were visible both in neuronal perikarya and axons (Fig. 2A–D). Lanthionine ketimine ester-treated mice had significantly fewer plaques (which were separately quantified by thioflavin S labeling, see below) but also substantially reduced 6E10 immunoreactivity in the neural somas and especially in axonal processes (Fig. 2A–D).\n\nTo verify that LKE-induced reduction in 6E10 immunoreactivity was not caused by reduced hAPP gene expression, PCR analysis (hAPP/18S-RNA) was performed on the cortex from LKE-treated and control 3 ×TgAD mice. No difference in gene expression was found in either LKE-injected mice (1 ± 0.08, n = 6 controls vs 0.93 ± 0.08, n = 6 LKE) or mice fed LKE from 7 to 15 months of age (1.03 ± 0.19, n = 6 controls vs 0.95 ± 0.11, n = 6 LKE). Labeling with 6E10 in mice fed LKE from 4 to 15 months revealed similar results (data not shown). In addition, Aβ42-specific labeling density was reduced approximately 50% in the hippocampus of these mice (Fig. 3). Although both plaquelike and diffuse Aβ40 and Aβ42 labeling were significantly reduced by LKE, the effect of LKE seemed to be most robust in the diffuse labeling because varying degrees of plaquelike accumulation were still evident in some mice, particularly in female mice.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for brain Aβ(1–40) may be performed using tissue lysed in TBS, hypotonic detergent-containing lysis buffers, or 5 mol/L GuHCl, depending on whether soluble or total Aβ(1–40) is meant to be assessed. In this study, ELISAs of Aβ(1–40) revealed readily measurable peptide both in detergent-lysed (CLB) fractions of 3×Tg-AD cortex and GuHCl-solubilized hippocampal pellets, but only trace amounts in the TBS-supernatant fraction of hippocampal lysates. Negligible Aβ(1–40) was measured in nontransgenic mouse brain extracts (not shown). Lanthionine ketimine ester-treated 3×Tg-AD mice had 40% to 50% less measurable Aβ(1–40) in both the GuHCl-extracted hippocampal tissue and the detergent-extracted cortical tissue (Fig. 2G, H). The presence of an LKE effect on Aβ(1–40) in 2 brain regions extracted under different technical protocols indicates that the treatment effect is robust to assay conditions and not limited only to fractions of total Aβ(1–40).\n\nTo investigate the effect of LKE on proteolytic processing of APP, we followed the formation of extracellular APP fragments generated by APP processing at the β-site (sAPPβ) and α-site (sAPPα), respectively, in mice fed LKE from 7 to 15 months using a quantitative sandwich immunoassay approach (Fig. 4). Production of sAPPα was approximately 54% less in LKE-fed mice (p = 0.002), whereas sAPPβ was approximately 33% reduced (p = 0.15).\n\nLKE Alters Amyloid Production In Vitro\n\nWe next examined spontaneous Aβ(1–40) production in SH-SY5Y cells treated with LKE or the prototypical γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (31). Cells were treated for a total of 96 hours, with media samples removed at 48 hours and 96 hours for Aβ(1–40) analysis (Fig. 5 A, B). Amyloid-β(1–40) production in these cells was quite variable between experiments but readily measured by ELISA, especially during the 48- to 96-hour window. Curiously, DAPT had a biphasic effect on Aβ(1–40) production, markedly increasing Aβ(1–40) at 0.1 to 1 μmol/L and then decreasing Aβ(1–40) at 10 to 100 μmol/L; however, loss of tetrazolium-reducing capacity and release of lactate dehydrogenase indicated that high-dose DAPT effects were associated with significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 5C). Lanthionine ketimine ester monotonically decreased Aβ(1–40) release beginning in the first 48 hours but increased in the second 48-hour window, reaching a plateau at 35% reduction (Fig. 5A, B). Significant LKE effects were achieved at 1 to 10 μmol/L, indicating that the compound was potent with respect to suppressing a certain component of Aβ(1–40) production. Lanthionine ketimine ester did not increase lactate dehydrogenase release or decrease MTS conversion at any treatment dose. Taken together, these data indicate that LKE effects on amyloidogenesis can be studied in cell culture and that SH-SY5Y cells may offer a model system for the study of this phenomenon.\n\nLKE Reduces Thioflavin S—Stainable Plaques in Aging 3×Tg-AD Mice\n\nThe thioflavin-S method detects dense plaques containing proteins in the β-sheet conformation. These plaques are numerous and often very large in the hippocampal subicular/CA1 region of aging 3 × Tg-AD mice. Ad libitum LKE treatment resulted in a significant reduction in plaque number and in total estimated volume of thioflavin S—stained plaques in the hippocampus of 3 × Tg-AD mice at 15 months of age (Fig. 6).\n\nLKE Reduces Phospho-Tau Immunoreactivity in Aging 3 ×Tg-AD Mice\n\nImmunohistologic analysis of phospho-Tau was first undertaken using monoclonal antibody AT8, which detects the PHF-Tau epitope phosphorylated on S199/S202 and S205/208 (32, 33). Ad libitum LKE treatment significantly reduced AT8 labeling intensity in the hippocampus and parahippocampal region by approximately 38% (Fig. 7A—E).\n\nSubsequent ELISAs were performed on the TBS fraction of hippocampal lysates using commercial ELISAs developed against PHF-Tau phosphorylated on either S396 (32) or T181 (34). Both epitopes are increased in AD, and the pTau(181) ELISA has recently been validated to human clinical specifications, offering the potential for use as a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy in future clinical studies (34). Chronic ad libitum LKE treatment significantly diminished mean concentrations of both pTau(396) and pTau(181) in hippocampal lysates; the magnitude of the LKE effect was approximately 35% (Fig. 7E). Total Tau concentrations tended to diminish with LKE treatment, but this trend did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10; Fig. 7F). Overall, the concentrations of Aβ(1–40) and PHF-Tau epitopes significantly correlated across all hippocampal lysates (p < 0.05 for each phospho-epitope by Spearman correlation test; Supplemental Digital Content 4, Supplementary Data), but Aβ(1–40) did not significantly correlate with total Tau (r = 0.19, p = 0.44).\n\npCRMP2(514) Is Decreased in 3xTg-AD Mouse Brain Lysate and Restored by LKE\n\nBecause prior studies have pointed to functional enhancement of CRMP2 as a plausible mechanism for the neurotrophic effects of LKE (8, 18, 19, 35), studies were performed to determine whether chronic LKE administration affected CRMP2 biology. Brain cortices (and hippocampi; not shown) from mice fed LKE 7 to 15 months were Western blotted with antibodies against total CRMP2 or pCRMP2(514) (the major glycogen synthase kinase-3β–targeted site) (7). Separately, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CRMP2 and blotted for the major protein binding partner, β-tubulin. Soluble pCRMP2(514), quantifiably in Western blots, was significantly reduced in 15-month-old 3×Tg-AD control mouse brain lysates relative to age-matched NonTg samples (Fig. 8) but was nearly identical between samples from LKE-treated 3×Tg-AD mice and untreated NonTg mice (Fig. 8). Corresponding ratios were nonsignificantly decreased in control 3×Tg-AD hippocampi versus NonTg hippocampi (p < 0.09). Insoluble pCRMP2 was not quantified because of the difficulty of analyzing such aggregates precisely by Western blots. The LKE effect of increasing soluble pCRMP2(514) was observed in both ad libitum studies (Fig. 8; Supplemental Digital Content 5, Supplementary Data). Moreover, less β-tubulin coimmunoprecipitated from cortical lysates of LKE-treated 3 × Tg-AD mice relative to samples from control 3×Tg-AD mice, consistent with prior observations (18). Taken together, these results suggest in vivo engagement of LKE with the presumptive target, that is, CRMP2 or CRMP2-linked signaling pathways.\n\nLKE Reduces Neuroinflammation in Aging 3×Tg-AD Mice\n\nIba-1—positive microglia were examined in the hippocampus of LKE and vehicle-treated 3×Tg-AD mice (Fig. 9). Overall density of Iba-1 labeling was modestly but significantly reduced by LKE (Fig. 9C; p < 0.001). The size and morphology of microglia were also strikingly different in control versus LKE-treated 3 × Tg-AD mice. Untreated transgenic mice had greater numbers of hypertrophic stellate microglia in the subiculum, whereas LKE-treated transgenic mice had fewer, more ramified microglia (Fig. 9B, D). The reduction in neuroinflammation could be the result of a direct effect of LKE on brain microglia or an indirect result of reducing amyloid.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we show significant and substantial improvement in cognitive function and multiple aspects of brain histopathology in 3×Tg-AD mice administered lanthionine ketimine ester for a 4-, 8-, or 11-month period. The magnitude of AA reduction by LKE treatment is comparable to that of previous studies using therapeutic antibodies (36), which have generated much enthusiasm but have considerable associated clinical risks and costs. These results argue that more research needs be focused on natural brain lanthionine metabolites and their protein interaction partners, including CRMP2, which is emerging as an important but previously underappreciated participant in AD pathobiology.\n\nLanthionine ketimine is a natural brain metabolite formed by nonclassical reactions catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzyme cystathionine β-synthetase (CβS) followed by glutamine transaminase-K (Fig. 10) (19, 37–44). Normally, CβS initiates the scavenging of homocysteine (hCys) by condensing it with serine (Ser) to form cystathionine en route to regenerating useful cysteine (Cys) and then glutathione (GSH). In an alternative reaction, CβS instead condenses Cys with Ser or another molecule of Cys to generate lanthionine (19, 37, 40, 43). Glutamine transaminase-K then catalyzes lanthionine reaction with α-keto acids to yield LK (19, 38, 40 ,41). Previously, LK formation was not considered a purposeful process; however, our recent and present findings question this dogma (8, 18, 19). It should be noted that LK is but one member of a family of brain endogenous cyclic thioether ketimines (19, 38, 40, 41). For example, cystathionine can also form a 7-membered species (19, 40). Closer study of these sulfur metabolic pathways could yield deeper insights into and new therapeutic concepts for neurologic diseases.\n\nCystathionine β-synthetase may not be the only source of lanthionine compounds in the brain. We have previously demonstrated glutathione binding to lanthionine synthetase—like protein-1 (LanCL1) (19, 45), a mammalian homolog to prokaryotic lanthionine cyclase (LanC) enzymes that form intramolecular thioether bonds within nascent polypeptide chains en route to antimicrobial lantibiotics (46). Lanthionine synthetase— like protein-1 binds GSH at a Zn2+ metallocenter that is structurally homologous to the LanC active site (44, 46). This prompted us to speculate that LanCL1 might form glutathione-S-alanyl conjugates (i.e. γ-glutamyl-lanthionine-glycine or gLan), ultimately leading to LK or LK-like molecules, but evidence for such a reaction pathway remains elusive (19). Alternatively, recent reports indicate that LanCL1 may regulate CβS through a direct binding interaction that is broken by a rising GSSG/GSH ratio, the phenotypic consequence of which is increased cellular resistance to oxidative stress (47). Curiously, LanCL1 also binds LK (18), which suggests the possibility that LK produced downstream from CβS (or LanCL1) might also feedback to allosterically affect the LanCL1:CβS system.\n\nRegardless of the origin and natural function of lan-thionine metabolites, current and recent data demonstrate that synthetic derivatives of LK are bioactive (8, 18, 19). Affinity proteomics studies indicate that LK binds a select subset of brain proteins, including CRMP2, syntaxin binding-protein-1 (STXBP1), and LanCL1 (18). We have focused mostly on LK interaction with CRMP2 for the following reasons: 1) LKE demonstrably affects neural processes such as neurite extension that are known to be CRMP2 dependent (8, 18); 2) LK affects some CRMP2:protein binding interactions ex vivo (18); and 3) CRMP2 is becoming increasingly evident as an important and plausible pathogenic player in AD (3, 4, 6, 35). Recent data on LK/LKE effects on neuronal circuitry in developing Caenorhabditis elegans expressing wild-type or genetically modified orthologs of CRMP2 (Unc-33) support the hypothesis that the biologic activities of LK/LKE occur through a CRMP2-dependent mechanism (48). Using these C. elegans models, LKE acted to elongate neurites and partially rescued the neuronal circuitry defects found in Unc-33 mutants (48).\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein 2 was originally identified as a mediator of semaphorin-3A (Sema3A)—stimulated axon retraction in the developing CNS (49). Collapsin response mediator protein 2 has been found to bind at least 20 different proteins ranging from signal transduction components to ion channels and cytoskeletal protein (8). Many of these interactions could plausibly influence normal neuron function or neurodegenerative processes. For example, CRMP2 is responsible for adapting the Sra1/WAVE1 complex to kinesin motors for anterograde axonal transport (12). In distal axons and in synapses, Sra1/WAVE1 interacts with the ARP2/3 complex to decrease the activation barrier for actin polymerization (50). In the absence of synaptic Sra1/WAVE1, actin microfilament integrity is diminished and synapses can collapse (12). In both AD and 3×Tg-AD mice, observations such as hyperphosphorylated CRMP2 collecting in NFTs in complex with both phospho-Tau and Sra1/WAVE1 (5) suggest a possible role for CRMP2 in AD pathogenesis. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 also experiences exacerbated oxidative damage in AD, being 2- to 3-fold more derivatized by the lipid oxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal in the AD brain relative to age-matched normal brain (51, 52). It is therefore logical to consider whether alteration or inactivation of CRMP2 might contribute to the synaptic damage observed in AD and perhaps through a mechanism wherein synapses are deprived of crucial CRMP2 cargo proteins including Sra1/WAVE1. Much of what we currently know about CRMP2 modulation and function comes from developmental studies. These studies demonstrate the importance of CRMP2 phosphorylation in regulating microtubule assembly and neurite elongation (53), proper bifurcation of apical dendrites in CA1 neurons (54), and association of pCRMP2 with voltage-gated calcium channels (55). In the current study, LKE increases the phosphorylation profile of CRMP2, demonstrating engagement of the putative target. There are at least 26 distinct posttranslational modifications to CRMP2, including phosphorylation at a number of sites; the functional consequences of these modifications are largely unknown particularly as they relate to CRMP2 function in the normal and diseased adult brain. More research is needed to parse the complex activities of CRMP2 in the adult brain.\n\nOur cell culture and in vivo data demonstrate that LKE reduces Aβ production and alters APP processing. Interestingly, in SH-SY5Y cell culture, it took some time (~48 hours) for LKE effects to be fully evident; this is unlike the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT, which more rapidly altered Aβ(1–40) production. Lanthionine ketimine ester treatment resulted in a maximal 25% to 35% reduction in Aβ(1–40), suggesting that 65% to 75% of the total Aβ(1–40) production is “compartmentalized” from or refractory to LKE. Further study of LKE effects on APP processing may yield novel and important insights into both the disease-specific and normal processing and functions of APP and its metabolites.\n\nAlthough the mechanisms leading to changes in APP processing are likely complex, there is some evidence to suggest a role for CRMP2 in APP processing. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 interacts notably with the Numb endocytic adaptor protein to help arbitrate endocytic vesicle itinerary specifications (14). Knockdown of CRMP2 or dominant negative CRMP2 expression inhibits endocytic recycling of at least 1 Numb client protein, L1 (14). Numb recently has been implicated as an APP binding protein that affects APP internalization and amyloidogenic processing within early endosomes (13). Interference with Numb:APP binding results in greater degrees of Aβ production (13). Sequestration of CRMP2 within NFTs therefore could affect Numb-dependent APP processing and Aβ secretion by altering the steady-state concentration of APP within early endosomes or the rate at which such vesicle cargo is recycled to the plasma membrane. Small molecules such as LKE that may modulate CRMP2:protein binding interactions are, therefore, intriguing candidates to explore in models of AD. In the 3×Tg model, LKE altered proteolytic processing of APP, leading to a reduction in both sAPPα and sAPPβ and a dramatic reduction in Aβ species. A reduction in sAPPβ is thought to be beneficial by reducing the amyloidogenic pathway; however, the impact of reducing sAPPα is uncertain because there are beneficial functions attributed to sAPPα, such as regulation of cell proliferation and neuroprotection (56–58). Furthermore, there is no consensus regarding alterations in sAPP (total), sAPPα, and sAPPβ levels between AD patients and nondemented controls (59). The finding that both sAPPα and sAPPβ were reduced by LKE suggests a more complex alteration in processing of APP. A shift in APP processing by LKE could theoretically increase fragments of APP that are involved in neuroprotective or memory consolidation processes. Mileusnic and Rose (60) demonstrated that a small tripeptide fragment derived from APP increased memory retention via a CRMP2-dependent mechanism. Studies are currently underway to determine how LKE controls the processing of APP.\n\nBecause of the high degree of correlation between Aβ and phospho-Tau pathology in the 3×Tg-AD mouse, it is not yet possible to determine whether the LKE effects on tauopathy are secondary to LKE suppression of Aβ or mechanistically independent of the Aβ effects (i.e. a direct interaction between CRMP2 and tau). It has been suggested that soluble Aβ mediates the development of tau pathology. In vitro studies demonstrate that Aβ-induced microtubule destabilization and cellular trafficking defects result in the missorting of tau and are key factors in degeneration (61). Several in vivo studies also support the hypothesis that Aβ drives both wild-type and mutant tau pathology (62–64). ArcTau mice expressing oligo-meric Aβ and wild-type human tau develop tau pathology and age-related cognitive impairments (64). In 3×Tg mouse studies, reduction of Aβ reduced tau pathology (65, 66). In a separate study, however, BACE-1 knockout in the 3×Tg mouse did not have an effect on tau pathology (67). It is plausible that, by reducing Aβ production, LKE indirectly reduces tau phosphorylation, but a separate mechanism cannot be excluded.\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein 2 is emerging as a contributing factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions and has been recently validated as a therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, accessible by means of chimeric HIV-tat decoy peptides that disrupt both CRMP2 binding and activation of the voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel CaV2.2 (68, 69). A similar approach mitigated neural damage in a rodent model of traumatic brain injury (68). Thus, CRMP2 may prove to be an exploitable therapeutic target for treatment of diverse neu-ropathologic conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, we find that a synthetic derivative of the neural metabolite, lanthionine ketimine, mitigated all 3 cardinal features of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD, that is, Aβ burden, pTau accumulation, and cognitive dysfunction, and also reduced microglial activation. These findings encourage further investigations regarding the origins and natural functions of LK and other members of its metabolite class, their targets of action, and their potential for therapeutic development against neurodegenerative conditions, including AD.\n\nReferences\n\nSupporting Information\n\nSupplementary Data\n\nAuthor notes\n\n© 2013, by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc."
