        "meta_description": "Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are involved in signaling of axon guidance and neurite outgrowth during neural development and regeneration. Among these, CRMP2 has been identified as an important actor in neuronal polarity and axon outgrowth, these activities being correlated with the reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins. In contrast, the function of CRMP5, expressed during brain development, remains obscure. Here, we find that, in contrast to CRMP2, CRMP5 inhibits tubulin polymerization and neurite outgrowth. Knockdown of CRMP5 expression by small interfering RNA confirms its inhibitory functions. CRMP5 forms a ternary complex with MAP2 and tubulin, the latter involving residues 475-522 of CRMP5, exposed at the molecule surface. Using different truncated CRMP5 constructs, we demonstrate that inhibition of neurite outgrowth by CRMP5 is mediated by tubulin binding. When both CRMP5 and CRMP2 are overexpressed, the inhibitory effect of CRMP5 abrogates neurite outgrowth promotion induced by CRMP2, suggesting that CRMP5 acts as a dominant signal. In cultured hippocampal neurons, CRMP5 shows no effect on axon growth, whereas it inhibits dendrite outgrowth and formation, at an early developmental stage, correlated with its strong expression in neurites. At later stages, when dendrites begin to extend, CRMP5 expression is absent. However, CRMP2 is constantly expressed. Overexpression of CRMP5 with CRMP2 inhibits CRMP2-induced outgrowth both on the axonal and dendritic levels. Deficiency of CRMP5 expression enhanced the CRMP2 effect. This antagonizing effect of CRMP5 is exerted through a tubulin-based mechanism. Thus, the CRMP5 binding to tubulin modulates CRMP2 regulation of neurite outgrowth and neuronal polarity during brain development.",

        "text": "Results\n\nCRMP5 binding to MAP2 and tubulin\n\nTo identify CRMP5-interacting proteins in the developing nervous system, we searched for high-molecular-weight proteins, from P8 mouse brain extract, which copurified with CRMP5 on an affinity column (Cibacron Blue agarose). Among different proteins eluted from this column and subjected to SDS-PAGE, a band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of ∼270 kDa was excised, subjected to mass spectrometry, and identified as MAP2 (data not shown). The CRMP5–MAP2 interaction was confirmed by the coimmunoprecipitation of CRMP5 by anti-MAP2 antibody in a lysate from the brain cortex of P8 mouse. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitate showed that the band migrating with an apparent mass of 66 kDa was recognized by anti-CRMP5 site-specific antibody (Fig. 1 A). The use of two other monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of CRMP5 further confirmed the 66 kDa band as CRMP5 (data not shown). Two forms of MAP2 can be distinguished in the neonatal stage: high-molecular-weight MAP2b and low-molecular-weight MAP2c. As a control, both forms of MAP2 were also precipitated by the anti-MAP2 antibody (Fig. 1 A). This is consistent with the colocalization of MAP2 with CRMP5 previously reported in the dendrites of embryonic cortical neurons in culture, as well as in the brain cortex of adults (Bretin et al., 2005).\n\nAs MAP2 was the major microtubule-associated protein of brain tissue, we assessed whether tubulin was present in the immunoprecipitate formed by MAP2 and CRMP5. A band corresponding to tubulin was detected using α-tubulin antibody, thereby indicating the presence of tubulin as well as MAP2 and CRMP5 in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 A). Next, we examined the expression patterns of CRMP5 and tubulin on NGF-induced differentiated PC12 cells transfected with the FLAG-CRMP5 expression vector. As the distribution of MAP2 in PC12 cells was well known (Brugg and Matus, 1988), we did not investigate its expression pattern in this study. Immunofluorescence labeling using anti-FLAG and anti-α-tubulin antibodies showed that CRMP5 was clearly colocalized with α-tubulin (Fig. 1 B, left and middle panels). However, after close examination, it seemed that this colocalization did not extend to the minor membrane extensions, since clear green staining, corresponding to CRMP5 expression, could be observed in the merge images of the transfected cells (Fig. 1 B, high magnification in left panels). Endogenous CRMP5 labeled with anti-CRMP5 antibody also showed a clear overlapping expression with tubulin (Fig. 1 B, right panels).\n\nWe then performed coimmunoprecipitation assays using α-tubulin and βIII-tubulin antibodies. CRMP5 was unambiguously coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysate by both antibodies (Fig. 1 C). To further confirm these interactions, we performed an overlay experiment in which recombinant CRMP5 protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then subsequently incubated in the presence or absence of brain lysate, before the detection of CRMP5-bound proteins with different antibodies. In the presence of brain lysate, CRMP5 bound strongly to MAP2 and α-tubulin (Fig. 1 D). However, anti-βIII-tubulin detected the CRMP5 protein as a faint band, indicative of a weak interaction. Reciprocally, α-tubulin and MAP2 were pulled down from lysates of brain cortex using GST-CRMP5 immobilized on glutatione-Sepharose beads, suggesting their coassembly in vivo. Figure 1 E shows that GST-CRMP5, but not GST, precipitates α-tubulin, which is present in the supernatant fractions of both GST and GST-CRMP5. Similarly, incubation of GST-CRMP5 with brain lysate led to the coprecipitation of two forms of MAP2, MAP2b and MAP2c (Fig. 1 E), albeit at lower levels than that of tubulin. Together, the above data suggest the formation of a ternary complex between CRMP5, tubulin, and MAP2. However, within this complex, the CRMP5-interacting molecule is not distinguished.\n\nIdentification of a direct interaction between the C-terminal domain of CRMP5 and tubulin\n\nWe examined whether the CRMP5-MAP2 coassembly was mediated by tubulin subunits, this hypothesis being reinforced by the fact that tubulin binding to CRMP1-4 had previously been reported (Fukata et al., 2002). An in vitro binding assay was performed using recombinant GST-CRMP5 and purified tubulin, containing both α- and β-tubulin. Both α-tubulin and β-tubulin were pulled down by GST-CRMP5 (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating a direct interaction between CRMP5 and α- and β-tubulin. However, α-tubulin showed greater binding to CRMP5 than β-tubulin. To identify the CRMP5 domain responsible for mediating interactions with tubulin, deletion constructs of CRMP5 were designed (Fig. 2 B), and purified proteins generated as GST-CRMP5 (Fig. 2 C) were used in an in vitro binding assay. After incubation of the purified tubulin with these mutated CRMP5-GST constructs (Fig. 2 D, top panel), tubulin was found to bind strongly to the full-length CRMP5 (amino acids 1-564), N-terminal-deleted mutants ΔN244 (245-564) and ΔN474 (475-564), but not to the C-terminal-deleted mutant ΔC472 (1-471). The most C-terminal 90 aa fragments of CRMP5 (475-564) coprecipitated with tubulin more strongly than the full-length form and any of the other mutants (Fig. 2 D). The same binding pattern could be observed when the above pull-down assays with GST-CRMP5 were performed using a lysate from brain cortex instead of purified tubulin (Fig. 2 D, bottom panel), thus ensuring that the identified tubulin-binding site was also valid in vivo. To determine the shortest effective fragment for tubulin binding, we generated two GST-CRMP5 additional fragments, 475–522 and 523–564, which were immobilized on beads and incubated with purified tubulin. Fragment 523-564 failed to pull down the tubulin, whereas fragment 475–522 did (Fig. 2 E). These data demonstrate that the tubulin-binding site on CRMP5 was located in a 48 aa fragment in the C-terminal region within residues 475-522. A recent study identified a tubulin-binding site within residues 480-509 of the CRMP2 sequence (Chae et al., 2009). Comparison between the CRMP5 and CRMP2 sequences within the region encompassing tubulin binding indicated that, despite a strong sequence identity between CRMP5 and CRMP2 on both sides of the identified site, only a weak sequence homology within the identified site could be observed (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\n\nTo gain insight into the spatial organization of this site, the structure of CRMP5 (residues 8-483) was modeled using DHPase as a template and the structure of the C-terminal part (residues 484-552) was predicted as an “intrinsically unstructured protein” using the NORS prediction program. Within the tubulin-binding site, residues 475-478 formed the most C-terminal part of the last helix, whereas the following residues (484-522) seemed to be unstructured (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) giving the molecule a malleable and flexible structural state, and importantly facilitating its interaction with other proteins. This region seems to be surface exposed.\n\nCRMP5 acts as an inhibitor of neurite outgrowth and formation mediated by tubulin binding\n\nSince one of the functions reported for some CRMPs is the promotion of neurite outgrowth mediated by tubulin binding (Fukata et al., 2002), we examined the effect of CRMP5 on neurite outgrowth activity by transfecting neuroblastoma cells (N1E-115) with the FLAG-CRMP5 expression vector. In parallel, we performed transfection with CRMP2, which has been reported to promote neurite outgrowth (Suzuki et al., 2003; Rogemond et al., 2008). After immunostaining with the anti-FLAG antibody, the lengths and numbers of neurite-like extensions were compared with the control EGFP-transfected cells. CRMP2-transfected cells showed, as expected, polygonal shapes presenting longer neurites >25 μm (Fig. 3 A). The CRMP5-expressing cells (n = 206) showed mostly an overall round shape. They clearly displayed less neurite elongation (3.5-fold) and also reduced the number of neurites per cell (2-fold) compared with the control EGFP-expressing cells (**p < 0.01), as shown in Figure 3, D and E. For additional examination of CRMP5 function, we depleted the CRMP5 protein in N1E-115 cells, by siRNA interference. The effect of siRNA against CRMP5 (siCRMP5) was first confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 B). The immunostaining of endogenous CRMP5 in cells treated with the scrambled siRNA (SC, n = 150 cells) showed a clear green staining indicative of CRMP5 expression, whereas the absence of green staining in siCRMP5-treated cells (n = 100 cells) revealed that CRMP5 expression was totally impaired (Fig. 3 C, top panels). To evaluate neurite length, the cells were also stained by phalloidin (red). Knockdown of CRMP5 (Fig. 3 C, bottom panels; D,E) drastically increased not only the neurite elongation (3.5-fold) but also the number of neurites per cell (3-fold) compared with SC (***p < 0.005). To confirm that these effects were attributable to CRMP5 depletion, we performed rescue experiments by overexpressing EGFP-CRMP5 in siCRMP5-transfected cells showing strong level of CRMP5 expression (supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In this case, the negative effect of CRMP5 on the elongation and number of neurites was rescued by restoring the expression level of CRMP5, since the N1E-115 cells again presented an overall round shape (Fig. 3 C, right panel; D,E). Together, these data suggested that CRMP5 is involved in neurite retraction as well as neurite formation in N1E-115 cells.\n\nTo determine the impact of the tubulin-binding region of CRMP5 on its inhibitory function, we examined the neurite-like extensions, in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells expressing different EGFP-deleted constructs of CRMP5. Since the average length of neurite extension after 48 h of NGF induction was <10 μm in PC12 cells (Fontaine-Lenoir et al., 2006), this limit was chosen for the evaluation of neurite length. Confocal analysis showed that, compared with GFP-expressing cells, the cells expressing full-length CRMP5 (n = 157 cells) exhibited a lower percentage (9% instead of 30%) of neurite lengths exceeding 10 μm (**p < 0.01) but a higher percentage (36% over 27%) of extensions <10 μm (Fig. 4 A,B). Similarly, only a small percentage of the cells bearing neurites >10 μm in length could be observed among cells expressing N-terminally truncated CRMP5 (ΔN244), bearing the tubulin-binding domain (n = 95 cells), and the CRMP5 construct ΔC518 (n = 136 cells), bearing only a few additional residues responsible for tubulin binding (Fig. 4 A,B). These cells also display an overall round morphology (73–75%). In contrast, cells expressing the CRMP5 construct ΔC472, lacking the tubulin-binding domain (n = 93 cells), exhibited polygonal shape and induced neurite extensions whose lengths were comparable with EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 4 A, bottom panels). Moreover, the number of neurite-like extensions per cell also decreased when cells expressed constructs bearing the tubulin-binding site, and increased to control levels when cells expressed the ΔC472 construct lacking this site (Fig. 4 C). It should be noted that the latter form was present in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol. These data strengthen the hypothesis that the tubulin-binding region of CRMP5 is responsible for its inhibitory function in neurite outgrowth and formation.\n\nWe next examined the effect of CRMP5 in hippocampal neurons from E18 mouse embryos transfected with EGFP-CRMP5 on day 4 after plating, and immunostained 2 d later at DIV 6, which corresponded to stage 4 of hippocampal neuron development in culture. This stage corresponded generally to the establishment of distinct dendritic domain in cultured neurons (Dotti et al., 1988). Control EGFP neurons showed one fast-growing axon and shorter neurites considered as dendrites, although immature, at this stage (see Fig. 6 A). Double staining of the cells using antibodies to the axonal marker anti-tau1 and the somato-dendritic marker anti-MAP2 confirmed that the long neurite was the axon and the other neurites were dendrites (see Fig. 6 B). CRMP5 transfection did not significantly change axon length and branching but reduced by 20% the length of dendritic processes (n = 42 neurons). Consistent with the above data, transfection with CRMP5 ΔC518, bearing the tubulin-binding domain, reduced dendrite length by 40% (*p < 0.05), whereas the ΔC472 mutant, devoid of this domain, had no effect on dendrite length (see Fig. 6 A,C). These data suggest that the tubulin-binding region of CRMP5 is necessary for the inhibition of dendrite growth. Although CRMP2 enhanced the number of dendrites, CRMP5 showed no effect on dendrite formation at stage 4 since the number of dendrites per neuron is comparable with the control (see Fig. 6 D). The absence of effect on dendrite formation may be explained by the fact that at stage 4 the dendritic domains were established.\n\nTo determine whether the tubulin–CRMP5 interaction exerted an influence on tubulin polymerization, we performed an in vitro assay to evaluate the capacity of purified tubulin to polymerize into microtubules, in the presence or absence of recombinant CRMP5 protein. A truncated form of CRMP5 (ΔC521) was overexpressed since, as indicated above, this is the most active form in neurite retraction. Purified control tubulin started to polymerize in the presence of GTP after a time lag of ≈60 s, with a steep initial slope during the first 7 min, followed by an increase up to a variation of optical density (ΔOD) of 0.47 after 15 min (Fig. 4 D). The addition of truncated recombinant CRMP5 before the polymerization step delayed tubulin polymerization, since the initial rate of microtubule formation was slower and the ΔOD was 34% lower than the control level. Moreover, even after prolonged incubation, the OD did not reach a plateau level (Fig. 4 D). To ascertain the specific effect of the CRMP5 tubulin-binding site, a polymerization assay was performed in the presence of CRMP5 ΔC472, which showed very similar tubulin polymerization to control tubulin. A similar pattern of microtubule formation was observed in the presence of bovine serum albumin, as a control, with a plateau reached at a ΔOD of 0.45 (Fig. 4 D).\n\nCRMP5 inhibition of neurite outgrowth is not counteracted by CRMP2 expression\n\nTo evaluate the effect of CRMP5 when CRMP2 was present, we cotransfected N1E-115 cells with both GFP-CRMP5 and FLAG-CRMP2 expression vectors, cells coexpressing both proteins being identified by their yellow color (Fig. 5 A). A small percentage of CRMP5-expressing cells (4%) showed neurite lengths >25 μm (**p < 0.01), whereas this percentage was higher (20.4%) for CRMP2-expressing cells (Fig. 5 B). Remarkably, cells coexpressing both CRMP2 and CRMP5 (n = 79) presented short neurite-like extensions, since only 5.3% displayed neurite lengths >25 μm (Fig. 5 A, top panels; B). Strikingly, 70% of double-transfected cells exhibited rather round shapes. These data suggest that CRMP5 acts as a dominant signal to counteract the neurite outgrowth promotion activity of CRMP2. The double transfection of cells with CRMP2 and truncated forms of CRMP5 harboring the tubulin-binding site resulted in a low percentage of cells exhibiting long neurites, whereas double transfection with CRMP2 plus CRMP5 ΔC472, devoid of the tubulin-binding site, resulted in a high percentage of cells (24%) displaying extensions longer than 25 μm (***p < 0.005) (Fig. 5 A, bottom panels; B). These results suggest that the abrogation of neurite outgrowth function of CRMP2 by CRMP5 is also dependent on the tubulin-binding capacity of CRMP5.\n\nWe next examined the effect of CRMP5 relative to CRMP2 in hippocampal neurons transfected with EGFP-CRMP5 and/or FLAG-CRMP2, and immunostained at DIV 6, as mentioned above. In accordance with previous reports (Fukata et al., 2002), hippocampal neurons expressing CRMP2 showed a significant increase in both axon length and the frequency of axonal branching with the cells sometimes displaying secondary axons (Fig. 6 A,C,E). Detailed dendrite length measurements showed that CRMP2 increased the length of dendrites 1.4-fold compared with control (Fig. 6 C). Strikingly, when CRMP2 and full-length CRMP5 were coexpressed (n = 46 neurons), axon elongation and dendrite length decreased to the level of CRMP5 expression alone (***p < 0.001), strengthening the hypothesis that CRMP5 abrogates CRMP2 promotion of neurite outgrowth in a dominant manner (Fig. 6 C,F). However, after close examination, the dominant effects of CRMP5 were more pronounced in dendrites than in axons. In fact, although there was less axon branching and fewer secondary axons in double-transfected compared with CRMP2-expressing neurons, they reached a level situated somewhere between CRMP2 and CRMP5 expression alone (Fig. 6 E). To elucidate whether the tubulin-binding domain of CRMP5 was involved in the inhibition of CRMP2 function, hippocampal neurons were cotransfected with CRMP2 and different truncated forms of CRMP5 (Fig. 6 F). Importantly, neurons cotransfected with CRMP2 and ΔC518 CRMP5, containing the tubulin-binding domain, reduced dendrite and axon length to the level of CRMP5 expression alone, indicating that this form abrogated the CRMP2 promotional outgrowth of axon and dendrites. On the contrary, neurons cotransfected with CRMP2 and CRMP5 ΔC472, lacking the tubulin-binding domain (n = 60 neurons), showed significant increases in axon length and dendrite outgrowth (***p < 0.0005) approximately equal to the level of CRMP2 expression alone (Fig. 6 A,C,F), indicating that when the tubulin-binding domain was missing, CRMP5 was unable to counteract CRMP2 function. These data suggest that CRMP5 abrogates the neurite outgrowth promotional activity of CRMP2 at both the dendrite and axon levels, and this effect seems to be mediated by the tubulin-binding capacity of CRMP5 in hippocampal neurons.\n\nThe role of microtubule in the extension of neuronal process has been previously well established (Yamada et al., 1970). More recently, the interaction of tubulin with CRMP2 was reported to promote the axon growth (Fukata et al., 2002). Therefore, to examine the molecular mechanisms that generate the antagonistic effect of CRMP5 on CRMP2, in vitro binding assays were performed to elucidate whether CRMP5 had an effect on the tubulin–CRMP2 interaction. This interaction was assessed using recombinant GST-CRMP2 and purified tubulin in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified full-length or truncated forms of CRMP5, either ΔC472 or a newly designed one ΔC521, generated as His-CRMP5 (Fig. 7 A). As expected, purified tubulin was pulled down by GST-CRMP2 (Fig. 7 B). When GST-CRMP2 and purified tubulin were subsequently incubated with either full-length or CRMP5 ΔC521, the binding of tubulin to CRMP2 decreased with increasing amounts of CRMP5 (Fig. 7 B), indicating that CRMP5 impaired the tubulin–CRMP2 interaction. The antagonizing effect of ΔC521 was more pronounced than the full-length CRMP5 (Fig. 7 B), probably because of the greater exposure of the tubulin-binding site because of the truncation of the C terminus in the former. This effect is specific for CRMP5, since the presence of large amounts of bovine serum albumin during the incubation did not influence the tubulin-CRMP2 interaction (data not shown). However, even at high concentrations, CRMP5 loss-of-function mutant ΔC472 lacking the tubulin-binding site could not counteract CRMP2 binding, since CRMP2 still bound to tubulin (Fig. 7 B). These data suggest that direct tubulin binding to CRMP5 impairs the binding of tubulin to CRMP2. Nonetheless, as CRMP proteins can form homocomplex and heterocomplex between isoforms (Wang and Strittmatter, 1997; Deo et al., 2004; Stenmark et al., 2007), the hypothesis that a direct CRMP5 binding to CRMP2 may slow down its ability to process neurite outgrowth cannot be totally excluded. To check this hypothesis, we performed in vitro binding assays, in the absence of tubulin, using recombinant GST-CRMP2 and various concentrations of either full-length, ΔC521, or ΔC472 forms of CRMP5. The control GST did not bind to CRMP5. Different concentrations of all CRMP5 isoforms, including ΔC472, were pulled down by GST-CRMP2 (Fig. 7 C), indicating that these forms interacted with CRMP2. Nevertheless, the fact that CRMP5 ΔC472, which did not counteract CRMP2 promotional activity still bound to CRMP2, indicates that the direct CRMP5/CRMP2 interaction does not correlate with CRMP5 inhibitory effect. Together, the above data suggest that, although CRMP5/CRMP2 oligomerization does occur, however only the direct CRMP5 binding to tubulin by preventing tubulin/CRMP2 interaction can antagonize CRMP2 promotional effect.\n\nCRMP2 outgrowth promotion is enhanced in CRMP5-deficient neurons\n\nA few days after axon has began its formation and rapid growth, remaining processes elongate and acquire the characteristic of dendrite (Dotti et al., 1988). As significant dendrite elongation begins between days 3 and 5, to assess the function of endogenous CRMP5 on dendrite outgrowth, at an early stage of development, we knocked down the CRMP5 expression in hippocampal neurons, by siCRMP5 on day 1 after plating, and then neurons were examined 2 d after transfection at DIV 3. First, the effect of CRMP5 expression was examined at early stage of development in hippocampal neurons from E18 mouse embryo transfected with EGFP-CRMP5. Compared with control EGFP expression (n = 52 neurons), the expression of EGFP-CRMP5 (n = 37 neurons) significantly reduced the lengths (**p < 0.01) and numbers (***p < 0.001) of neurites per cell considered as primary dendrites. Then, we studied the consequence of CRMP5 depletion by its knockdown with siCRMP5. The knockdown was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8 A). In CRMP5-depleted neurons (n = 45), the length and number of primary dendrites were unambiguously higher (**p < 0.01) than the control SC neurons (n = 25), indicating that in vivo, CRMP5 exerted an inhibitory effect on dendrite outgrowth and initiation at an early stage of the development (Fig. 8 A,B). A double staining of the neurons with anti-tau1 and anti-MAP2 antibodies confirmed that the long neurite was the axon and the other neurites were dendrites (Fig. 8 D). The reexpression of CRMP5 in neurons treated with siCRMP5 confirmed that the negative effect of CRMP5 was rescued by the expression of CRMP5 (supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). As observed for neurons at DIV 6, CRMP5 overexpression, at DIV 3, did not have any significant effect on axon length (Fig. 8 B). However, endogenous depletion of CRMP5 slightly, but not significantly, increased the axon length compared with SC-expressing neurons (Fig. 8 B). Because CRMP5 overexpression antagonized the neurite outgrowth promotion induced by CRMP2 expression, we asked whether the knockdown of endogenous CRMP5 had an effect on the CRMP2 induced outgrowth. Remarkably, in neurons knocked down for CRMP5 expression but overexpressing the CRMP2 construct (n = 28 neurons), the length and numbers of primary dendrites were higher (**p < 0.01) than in neurons expressing CRMP2 and SC (n = 32 neurons), indicating an antagonizing effect of endogenous CRMP5 at the dendritic level (Fig. 8 C,E). The negative effect of CRMP5 on dendrite growth and formation was rescued by restoring CRMP5 expression (Fig. 8 E). These results strongly support the inhibitory effect of endogenous CRMP5 on both the outgrowth and formation of primary dendrite counterbalancing the outgrowth promotion activity of CRMP2. Compared with cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV 3, CRMP2 expression in the presence of SC (n = 40 neurons) increased by 1.3-fold the axon length. Interestingly, knockdown of CRMP5 in hippocampal neurons expressing CRMP2 (n = 37 neurons) increased even more (1.5-fold; ***p < 0.005) axon length and enhanced (3-fold) the number of multiple secondary axons (**p < 0.01), with neurons presenting complicated multibranched axon trees (Fig. 8 C,F). The overexpression of CRMP5 in CRMP2 plus siCRMP5-transfected neurons brought down the axon length to that of the control (Fig. 8 F), strengthening the argument that endogenous CRMP5 controlled the axon growth effect of CRMP2. However, it should be noticed that CRMP5 did not exert an inhibitory effect on axon growth since axon length reached the level of control. Together, our data clearly confirmed the role of endogenous CRMP5 at early developmental stages, in preventing dendrite growth and formation and in the regulation of CRMP2 promotional growth.\n\nCRMP5 expression is not persistent in hippocampal neurons\n\nBecause CRMP5 inhibited dendrite outgrowth and modulated CRMP2 activity, we tested whether these effects were correlated with the CRMP5 level of expression in dendrites by studying the spatiotemporal distribution of CRMP5. The subcellular distribution of CRMP5 had previously been studied, in cultures of hippocampal neurons by Hotta et al. (2005), but only at DIV 1 and 7, with a focus on the growth cone accumulation of CRMP5. Therefore, we studied the endogenous expression of CRMP5, in cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV 1–6, and compared it with endogenous CRMP2 expression and MAP2 by double staining using different combination of anti-CRMP5, anti-CRMP2, and anti-MAP2 antibodies (Fig. 9 A,B). Green fluorescence intensities representing CRMP5 expression, determined from selected neurons, were shown as a three-dimensional intensity projection (Fig. 9 A, left panels). Fluorescence intensities, indicative of CRMP5, CRMP2, and MAP2 expression, were determined from defined region on dendrites and axon using imaging software (ImageJ) and graphed as fluorescence values (Fig. 9 D). The precise length of dendrites and axon at each day of culture was determined, specifically in the absence of CRMP2 and CRMP5 expression, using CellTracker Green, CMFDA, 5-chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate (supplemental Fig. S5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Minor CRMP5 and MAP2 expressions could be detected only in soma after 1 and 2 d of culture (Fig. 9 A), whereas CRMP2 expression in neurites was clearly detected since day 2 of culture (38 ± 12 AU) (Fig. 9 B,D). At DIV 3, one of the immature neurite, showing high CRMP2 expression (46.8 ± 9.6 AU) elongated rising 332 μm (±50 μm) in length to become the future axon (Fig. 9 B,D), at the same time a strong expression of endogenous CRMP5 was detected in the soma and primary dendrites (37.1 ± 6.9 AU) presenting a colocalization with MAP2 and CRMP2 (Fig. 9 A,B). In contrast to axon, the dendrite length did not change at DIV 3 (30 ± 6.7 μm instead of 28 ± 6.5 μm at DIV 2) (Fig. 9 D). Accordingly, the MAP2 expression in dendrite, considered as an indication of dendrite outgrowth, remained low (Fig. 9 D, middle panel). This suggested that high CRMP5 expression during axonogenesis maintained the primary dendrites inhibited. CRMP5 was also distributed in the axon, but to a lesser extent (10.5 ± 2.6 AU) (Fig. 9 D), whereas CRMP2 expression was almost equivalent in axon and primary dendrites. During following stages of neuronal development, corresponding to dendrite outgrowth (Fig. 9 D, top panel), a decrease in CRMP5 expression was observed in dendrites (17.7 ± 4.6 AU) at DIV 4, followed by a very low expression level at DIV 5 (2.1 ± 1 AU), at which an absence of CRMP5 staining was noticed in dendrites (Fig. 9 A,B; supplemental Fig. S5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), whereas the CRMP2 expression remained almost constant (Fig. 9 D, bottom panel). On the opposite, a strong labeling was observed with MAP2, indicating the dendrite outgrowth, whose length reached at DIV 5 50 ± 10 μm (Fig. 9 D, top panel), which perfectly matched with that previously reported (Dotti et al., 1988). It should be noted that MAP2 expression increased consistently in dendrites from DIV 1 to 6 (from 1.6 ± 1.3 to 37.5 ± 6 AU) (Fig. 9 D). In accordance with a previous report (Hotta et al., 2005), at DIV 6, a wide redistribution of CRMP5 was observed within hippocampal neurons, including soma, dendrites, and axon. Although CRMP5 expression was very low in axon at the beginning, it became very high (38.7 ± 10.7 AU) at this stage of development (Fig. 9 A,D), suggesting a role for CRMP5 in controlling the axon elongation at later stages of development. At DIV 6, CRMP5 was also observed de novo, at the dendritic level, however, to a lesser extent than at DIV 3 (14.1 ± 3.3 AU) (Fig. 9 D), whereas CRMP2 expression in dendrites and axon remained at high level, suggesting that, in the absence of CRMP5, CRMP2 promoted dendrite outgrowth. The expression level of both CRMP5 and CRMP2 in hippocampal neurons was further examined by Western blot analysis of a lysate of neurons from each day of culture. Figure 9 C showed that the band migrating at 66 kDa recognized by anti-CRMP5 antibody presented high intensity at DIV 3, its intensity progressively decreased to reach a very low level at DIV 5, but at DIV 6 this band showed again very high intensity. The higher intensity at DIV 6 compared with DIV 3 might be explained by the fact that, as mentioned above, the CRMP5 expression was increased at the axon level at DIV 6. The band recognized by anti-CRMP2 antibody, although exhibiting low intensity at DIV 1–2, showed similar high intensity from DIV 3 onward, with the highest intensity reached at DIV 5 at which multiple isoforms of CRMP2, previously described (Rogemond et al., 2008), could be visualized (Fig. 9 C). These results, in perfect agreement with the above data on fluorescent quantification of CRMP5 and CRMP2 expression, demonstrate the transient expression of CRMP5. Together, our data demonstrated that a correlation might exist between CRMP5 expression and its inhibitory effect on dendrite growth during axonogenesis; subsequently, its absence of expression at DIV 5 of neuronal development allowed dendrites to grow, suggesting a role for CRMP5 in maintaining them in a quiescent state at early stages of development, thus regulating the establishment of neuronal polarity.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we provide evidence for a novel role of CRMP5 in inhibiting neurite outgrowth through binding to tubulin and MAP2 during brain development. Overexpression of CRMP2 was reported to promote neurite elongation and axon induction (Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007), whereas CRMP3 was described as enhancing dendrite branching in mouse hippocampus (Quach et al., 2008). A change in cell shape after CRMP5 overexpression has previously been reported (Suzuki et al., 2003). Although CRMP5 is distributed throughout axon and dendrites (Bretin et al., 2005; Hotta et al., 2005), growth inhibition is observed at the dendritic level, but not in the axon in hippocampal neurons. CRMP5 also inhibits dendrite initiation, although this inhibition occurs only at an early developmental stage (stage 3) concomitant with its strong expression in dendrites. Knockdown of CRMP5 unambiguously confirms its inhibitory function. Nevertheless, CRMP5 deficiency results in greater neurite numbers and lengths in N1E-115 cells than in neurons. In neurons, other negative signaling molecules may partially compensate for CRMP5 function.\n\nCRMP associations with tubulin have been reported for CRMP1-4 (Fukata et al., 2002), whereas a CRMP5–tubulin interaction has not yet been identified. We demonstrate that CRMP5 interacts with tubulin and MAP2 in mouse brain cortex during development, forming a ternary complex, within which CRMP5 shows direct binding to α- and β-tubulin. The colocalization of CRMP5 and tubulin at the cytosolic level supported their interaction. The tubulin-binding domain is mapped to a C-terminal fragment of CRMP5 (residues 475-522). The C-terminal part of CRMP5 fell into the category of “intrinsically unstructured proteins,” characterized by a flexible and unfolded state, favoring interactions with other partners. Consequently, the tubulin-interacting domain, located within this region, would be easily available for binding to tubulin. Previous reports differ on the tubulin-binding properties of CRMP2. A central domain (residues 323-381) was reported to be involved in CRMP2 activity on microtubule assembly (Fukata et al., 2002). As this site is located in a hidden region in the x-ray structure (Stenmark et al., 2007), CRMP2 may have to undergo some conformational change to expose it. In contrast, a recent study identified CRMP2 residues 480-509 as being responsible for such activity (Chae et al., 2009). The latter site resembles the identified CRMP5 tubulin-binding site. However, despite the strong sequence homology between CRMPs and the surface exposure of both sites, they show a low sequence homology.\n\nDistinct pathways are involved in different CRMP-mediated neurite outgrowth functions through actin-binding (Alabed et al., 2007) or tubulin-binding mechanisms (Fukata et al., 2002). We demonstrate that overexpression of CRMP5 bearing the tubulin-binding site inhibits neurite outgrowth, whereas the expression of CRMP5 ΔC472, devoid of tubulin-binding site, failed to inhibit it. Similarly, CRMP5 tubulin-binding capacity is required for inhibition of dendrite outgrowth in neurons. Moreover, we find that recombinant CRMP5 inhibits tubulin polymerization in an in vitro microtubule polymerization assay, whereas CRMP5 ΔC472 does not. Similar mechanism inhibits neurite formation, since CRMP5 ΔC472 expression failed to reduce the number of neurites, whereas different forms of CRMP5 bearing the tubulin-binding site did. The inhibition is more pronounced for ΔC518 and ΔN244 than for full-length forms. This may be explained by a greater accessibility of the tubulin-binding site in the C-terminally deleted form and the induction of a conformational change in the N-terminally deleted form leading to a better exposure of this site.\n\nMAP2 plays an essential role in modulating the growth (Brugg and Matus 1988) and the initiation of neuronal processes by maintaining the linkage or mediating cross talk between microtubules and other cytoskeletal elements. The presence of MAP2 denotes a difference in the way that tubulin interacts with CRMP5 and CRMP2, since MAP2 interactions with other CRMPs were not found in previous reports (Fukata et al., 2002). Notwithstanding whether MAP2 binds to CRMP5 through direct interaction or indirectly via tubulin, its presence within the complex implies that it is a determinant factor in the inhibitory role of CRMP5 notably at the dendritic level. Several observations support this theory. First, in vivo, CRMP5 forms a complex with MAP2 and tubulin. Second, consistent with our observations, a colocalization of CRMP5 and MAP2 in dendrites was previously reported (Bretin et al., 2005). Third, in axon, devoid of MAP2, CRMP5 does not exert inhibitory activity. Therefore, we can assume that by forming a complex with tubulin heterodimers and MAP2, CRMP5 locks the microtubular structure and prevents additional microtubule polymerization, thereby inhibiting neurite outgrowth and formation.\n\nAntagonistic roles of CRMP5 and CRMP2\n\nThe study of the combinatorial functions of both CRMP5 and CRMP2 led to the important finding that the neurite outgrowth-promoting function of CRMP2 is totally abrogated by neurite outgrowth inhibition induced by CRMP5, indicating that CRMP5 acts as the dominant signal. In cultured hippocampal neurons, dendrite elongation and initiation induced by CRMP2 expression is considerably enhanced by a CRMP5 deficiency, strengthening the fact that, in vivo, endogenous CRMP5 restricts CRMP2 function. CRMP2 expression results in axon induction and the formation of multiple axons, as reported previously (Inagaki et al., 2001). Abrogation of the CRMP2 outgrowth promotion is observed not only at the dendritic level but also at that of the axon. Nevertheless, CRMP5 expression does not exert inhibitory activity at the axon level since the axon length never falls below the level of controls, but it abolishes CRMP2 induction of axon growth. A CRMP5 deficiency in neurons results also in increased CRMP2-induced axon elongation and the number of multiple axons, suggesting that, in vivo, CRMP5 may modulate CRMP2 induction of both axon growth and multiple axon formation.\n\nDifferent mechanisms may govern the antagonizing function of CRMP5. First, by binding to CRMP2, CRMP5 may counteract its ability to process neurite outgrowths. However, despite the direct interaction between CRMP5 and CRMP2 observed in this study and reported by others (Fukada et al., 2000), the fact that the loss-of-function CRMP5 ΔC472 still binds to CRMP2 without influencing its activity does not support this interpretation. Second, CRMP5 and CRMP2 bind competitively to tubulin. Indeed, in contrast to the full-length and CRMP5 ΔC518 bearing the tubulin-binding site, the CRMP5 ΔC472 failed to abrogate the CRMP2 promotion of axon and dendrite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that CRMP5 antagonistic activity is tubulin-binding dependent. In addition, only recombinant CRMP5 bearing the tubulin-binding site, but not CRMP5 ΔC472, can disrupt the in vitro binding of CRMP2 to tubulin. By binding to tubulin heterodimers, CRMP2 transports them, via kinesin-1 motor proteins, to the plus-ends of microtubules to promote neurite extension (Kimura et al., 2005). Thus, by binding to microtubules, CRMP5 impairs CRMP2 transport of tubulin, preventing it to promote microtubule assembly, which causes the modification of the microtubule networks.\n\nCRMP5 in neuronal polarity\n\nAs CRMP2 plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity by inducing axonal growth (Yoshimura et al., 2005), endogenous CRMP5, by restricting CRMP2 activity, may intervene in the regulation of neuronal polarity. In this study, using different approaches, we find that the CRMP2 expression is almost constant during neuronal development, whereas CRMP5 presents two peaks of expression at DIV 3 and 6. Neuronal polarization occurs from stage 2 to 3, at which one of the immature neurite begins to extend rapidly and becomes axon. Other neurites remain quiescent for a few days until the axon begins to growth, and then they elongate and acquire, at stage 4 (DIV 5), the characteristics of dendrites (Dotti et al., 1988). To date, it is not known why neurites other than the axon remain quiescent. Here, several lines of inquiry have helped to elucidate this point. First, we find that strong CRMP5 expression in dendrites occurs at DIV 3, corresponding to axon growth and quiescent neurite. Second, CRMP5 expression progressively diminishes and almost stops at DIV 5, when dendrites begin to extend. Third, CRMP5 acts as an inhibitor of dendrite elongation and formation with no effect on axon growth. Fourth, CRMP5 restricts the CRMP2 outgrowth promotional function. Considering the continuous expression of CRMP2, it can be assumed that CRMP5, by counteracting CRMP2, maintains neurites in a quiescent state at the early stage of the development, allowing the axon to continue its outgrowth, whereas its lack of expression thereafter allows dendrites to elongate and to reach their mature state, probably because of the CRMP2-induced promotional outgrowth. A slight CRMP5 reexpression can be observed in dendrites, at a later stage of development (DIV 6), which may help control mature dendrite length. This is consistent with our previous observations that, at the postnatal stage, CRMP5 is present in the external granular layer of cerebellum (Ricard et al., 2001) and CRMP5 is expressed in soma and dendrites of adult brain (Bretin et al., 2005). In parallel, high CRMP5 expression in the axon, at a late developmental stage, may constrain CRMP2-induced growth, delimiting axonal length. Whereas many intracellular and extracellular molecules seem to determine neuronal polarity (Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007), our observations suggest that CRMP5 can be considered as one of the molecules involved in regulating neuronal polarity.\n\nIn conclusion, the modulation of CRMP5 expression in neurons is a critical factor in regulating neurite outgrowth and neuronal polarity, ensuring the establishment of normal neuronal communication during brain development."
