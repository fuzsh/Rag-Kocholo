        "text": "Nrf2 reduces levels of phosphorylated tau protein by inducing autophagy adaptor protein NDP52\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJo, Chulman; Gundemir, Soner; Pritchard, Susanne; Jin, Youngnam N.; Rahman, Irfan; Johnson, Gail V. W.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nNuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal transcription factor in the defence against oxidative stress. Here we provide evidence that activation of the Nrf2 pathway reduces the levels of phosphorylated tau by induction of an autophagy adaptor protein NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2) in neurons. The expression of NDP52, which we show has three antioxidant response elements (AREs) in its promoter region, is strongly induced by Nrf2, and its overexpression facilitates clearance of phosphorylated tau in the presence of an autophagy stimulator. In Nrf2-knockout mice, phosphorylated and sarkosyl-insoluble tau accumulates in the brains concurrent with decreased levels of NDP52. Moreover, NDP52 associates with phosphorylated tau from brain cortical samples of Alzheimer disease cases, and the amount of phosphorylated tau in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions is inversely proportional to that of NDP52. These results suggest that NDP52 plays a key role in autophagy-mediated degradation of phosphorylated tau in vivo.\n\nIncreased SHP-1 Protein Expression by High Glucose Levels Reduces Nephrin Phosphorylation in Podocytes*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDenhez, Benoit; Lizotte, Farah; Guimond, Marie-Odile; Jones, Nina; Takano, Tomoko; Geraldes, Pedro\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNephrin, a critical podocyte membrane component that is reduced in diabetic nephropathy, has been shown to activate phosphotyrosine signaling pathways in human podocytes. Nephrin signaling is important to reduce cell death induced by apoptotic stimuli. We have shown previously that high glucose level exposure and diabetes increased the expression of SHP-1, causing podocyte apoptosis. SHP-1 possesses two Src homology 2 domains that serve as docking elements to dephosphorylate tyrosine residues of target proteins. However, it remains unknown whether SHP-1 interacts with nephrin and whether its elevated expression affects the nephrin phosphorylation state in diabetes. Here we show that human podocytes exposed to high glucose levels exhibited elevated expression of SHP-1, which was associated with nephrin. Coexpression of nephrin-CD16 and SHP-1 reduced nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A single tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation revealed that rat nephrin Tyr1127 and Tyr1152 are required to allow SHP-1 interaction with nephrin. Overexpression of dominant negative SHP-1 in human podocytes prevented high glucose-induced reduction of nephrin phosphorylation. In vivo, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that nephrin expression and phosphorylation were decreased in glomeruli of type 1 diabetic Akita mice (Ins2+/C96Y) compared with control littermate mice (Ins2+/+), and this was associated with elevated SHP-1 and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis indicated increased colocalization of SHP-1 with nephrin in diabetic mice compared with control littermates. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that high glucose exposure increases SHP-1 interaction with nephrin, causing decreased nephrin phosphorylation, which may, in turn, contribute to diabetic nephropathy.

Our previous work has demonstrated that the thousand-and-one amino acid kinases (TAOKs) 1 and 2 phosphorylate tau on more than 40 residues in vitro. Here we show that TAOKs are phosphorylated and active in AD brain sections displaying mild (Braak stage II), intermediate (Braak stage IV) and advanced (Braak stage VI) tau pathology and that active TAOKs co-localise with both pre-tangle and tangle structures. TAOK activity is also enriched in pathological tau containing sarkosyl-insoluble extracts prepared from AD brain. Two new phosphorylated tau residues (T123 and T427) were identified in AD brain, which appear to be targeted specifically by TAOKs. A new small molecule TAOK inhibitor (Compound 43) reduced tau phosphorylation on T123 and T427 and also on additional pathological sites (S262/S356 and S202/T205/S208) in vitro and in cell models. The TAOK inhibitor also decreased tau phosphorylation in differentiated primary cortical neurons without affecting markers of synapse and neuron health. Notably, TAOK activity also co-localised with tangles in post-mortem frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) brain tissue. Furthermore, the TAOK inhibitor decreased tau phosphorylation in induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons from FTLD patients, as well as cortical neurons from a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (Tau35 mice). Our results demonstrate that abnormal TAOK activity is present at pre-tangles and tangles in tauopathies and that TAOK inhibition effectively decreases tau phosphorylation on pathological sites. Thus, TAOKs may represent a novel target to reduce or prevent tau-associated neurodegeneration in tauopathies.\n\nFibroblasts from long-lived species of mammals and birds show delayed, but prolonged, phosphorylation of ERK.\n\nPubMed\n\nElbourkadi, Najoua; Austad, Steven N; Miller, Richard A\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFibroblasts from long-lived mutant mice show diminished phosphorylation of the stress-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 after exposure to peroxide, cadmium, or paraquat. We have now evaluated the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation in fibroblasts from long-lived and short-lived species of mammals and birds in response to stress by cadmium or hydrogen peroxide. Fibroblasts from the shorter-lived species of rodents and birds showed rapid induction of ERK phosphorylation, with a decline to basal level within 60Â min. In contrast, cells from longer-lived species showed slower and more prolonged activation of ERK phosphorylation. These results suggest that fibroblasts from long-lived species may be less susceptible to the early phases of damage from cadmium or peroxide and suggest that altered kinetics of ERK activity may contribute to their stress resistance properties.

Following myelin loss, internode length is reestablished through remyelination. However, remyelination results in short internode lengths and reduced conduction rates. We analyzed the potential role of neurofilament phosphorylation in regulating internode length during remyelination and myelination. Following ethidium bromide induced demyelination, levels of neurofilament medium (NF-M) and heavy (NF-H) phosphorylation were unaffected. Preventing NF-M lysine-serine-proline (KSP) repeat phosphorylation increased internode length by 30% after remyelination. To further analyze the role of NF-M phosphorylation in regulating internode length, gene replacement was used to produce mice in which all KSP serine residues were replaced with glutamate to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. Mimicking constitutive KSP phosphorylation reduced internode length by 16% during myelination and motor nerve conduction velocity by ~27% without altering sensory nerve structure or function. Our results suggest that NF-M KSP phosphorylation is part of a cooperative mechanism between axons and Schwann cells that together determine internode length, and suggest motor and sensory axons utilize different mechanisms to establish internode length.

T.; Kucera, T.; Briantais, J. M.; Hodges, M.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIn the present work we study the regulation of the distribution of the phosphorylated photosystem II (PSII) core populations present in grana regions of the thylakoids from several plant species. The heterogeneous nature of PSII core phosphorylation has previously been reported (M.T. Giardi, F. Rigoni, R. Barbato [1992] Plant Physiol 100: 1948-1954; M.T. Giardi [1993] Planta 190: 107-113). The pattern of four phosphorylated PSII core populations in the grana regions appears to be ubiquitous in higher plants. In the dark, at least two phosphorylated PSII core populations are always detected. A mutant of wheat (Triticum durum) that shows monophasic room-temperature photoreduction of the primary quinone electron acceptor of PSII as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence increase in the presence and absence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and by fluorescence upon flash illumination in intact leaves also lacks the usual distribution of phosphorylated PSII core populations. In this mutant, the whole PSII core population pattern is changed, probably due to altered threonine kinase activity, which leads to the absence of light-induced phosphorylation of CP43 and D2 proteins. The results, correlated to previous experiments in vivo, support the idea that the functional heterogeneity observed by fluorescence is correlated in part to the PSII protein phosphorylation in the grana.

[U- 13 C]-Glucose was injected (i.p.) prior to, or following a 5 min flurothyl-induced seizure. Fifteen minutes later, mice were killed and the total metabolite levels and % 13 C enrichment were analyzed in the hippocampal formation using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Activities of key metabolic and antioxidant enzymes and the phosphorylation status of pyruvate dehydrogenase were measured, along with lipid peroxidation. During seizures, total lactate levels increased 1.7-fold; however, [M + 3] enrichment of both lactate and alanine were reduced by 30% and 43%, respectively, along with a 28% decrease in phosphofructokinase activity. Postictally the % 13 C enrichments of all measured tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and the amino acids were reduced by 46-93%. At this time, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity was 56% of that measured in controls, and there was a 1.9-fold increase in the phosphorylation of PDH at ser232. Phosphorylation of PDH is known to decrease its activity. Here, we show that the increase of lactate levels during flurothyl seizures is from a source other than [U- 13 C]-glucose, such as glycogen. Surprisingly, although we saw a reduction in phosphofructokinase activity during the seizure, metabolism of [U- 13 C]-glucose into the TCA cycle seemed unaffected. Similar to our recent findings in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model, postictally the metabolism of glucose by glycolysis and the TCA cycle was impaired along with reduced PDH activity. Although this decrease in activity may be a protective mechanism to reduce oxidative stress, which is observed in the flurothyl model, ATP is critical to the recovery of ion and neurotransmitter balance and return to normal brain function. Thus we identified promising novel strategies to enhance energy metabolism and recovery from\n\nInhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by sulforaphane reduces adhesion molecule expression in vascular endothelial cell.\n\nPubMed\n\nCho, Young S; Kim, Chan H; Ha, Tae S; Ahn, Hee Y\n\n2015-11-18\n\nIntercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) play key roles in the initiation of vascular inflammation. In this study, we explored whether sulforaphane, a dietary phytochemical, can inhibit the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the mechanisms involved. Sulforaphane prevented the LPS-mediated increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, (P < 0.01) in HUVEC. Sulforaphane also prevented the LPS-mediated increase in the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (P < 0.01). Stattic, a STAT3 inhibitor, reduced the LPS-induced expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and STAT3 phosphorylation (P < 0.01). STAT3 small interfering RNA treatment reduced the LPS-induced expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and STAT3 (P < 0.01). Sulforaphane reduced LPS-mediated THP-1 monocyte adhesion to HUVEC (P < 0.01). In C57BL/6 mice, injection of LPS increased aortic ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and this effect was prevented by sulforaphane. These data provide insight into the mechanism through which sulforaphane partly reduces the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the vascular wall by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation.\n\nThe three Î±1-adrenoceptor subtypes show different spatio-temporal mechanisms of internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerez-Aso, M; Segura, V; MontÃ³, F; Barettino, D; Noguera, M A; Milligan, G; D'Ocon, P\n\n2013-10-01\n\nWe analyzed the kinetic and spatial patterns characterizing activation of the MAP kinases ERK 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by the three Î±1-adrenoceptor (Î±1-AR) subtypes in HEK293 cells and the contribution of two different pathways to ERK1/2 phosphorylation: protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent ERK1/2 activation and internalization-dependent ERK1/2 activation. The different pathways of phenylephrine induced ERK phosphorylation were determined by western blot, using the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8425, the receptor internalization inhibitor concanavalin A and the siRNA targeting Î²-arrestin 2. Receptor internalization properties were studied using CypHer5 technology and VSV-G epitope-tagged receptors. Activation of Î±1A- and Î±1B-ARs by phenylephrine elicited rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was directed to the nucleus and inhibited by Ro 31-8425. Concomitant with phenylephrine induced receptor internalization Î±1A-AR, but not Î±1B-AR, produced a maintained and PKC-independent ERK phosphorylation, which was restricted to the cytosol and inhibited by Î²-arrestin 2 knockdown or concanavalin A treatment. Î±1D-AR displayed constitutive ERK phosphorylation, which was reduced by incubation with prazosin or the selective Î±1D antagonist BMY7378. Following activation by phenylephrine, Î±1D-AR elicited rapid, transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was restricted to the cytosol and not inhibited by Ro 31-8425. Internalization of the Î±1D-AR subtype was not observed via CypHer5 technology. The three Î±1-AR subtypes present different spatio-temporal patterns of receptor internalization, and only Î±1A-AR stimulation translates to a late, sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation that is restricted to the cytosol and dependent on Î²-arrestin 2 mediated internalization.

Administration of anti-tau antibodies to transgenic \"tauopathy mice\" has been shown to reduce their tau pathology but the mechanisms responsible are unclear. To examine the effects of anti-tau antibodies on tau phosphorylation, we used western blots to study the effects of three antibodies to phosphorylated tau (pTau), namely anti-pTau S199, T231, and S396, and three antibodies to non-phosphorylated tau on in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant human tau-441 at S199. Inclusion of an anti-pTau T231 antibody in the phosphorylation reaction reduced the intensity of monomeric pTau S199 in western blots of denaturing gels, but the other antibodies had no apparent effects on this process. Surprisingly, including all three anti-phospho-tau antibodies in the reaction did not reduce the intensity of the monomer band, possibly due to steric hindrance between the antibodies. These preliminary findings suggest that anti-tau antibodies may have minimal direct effects on tau phosphorylation. Limitations of using western blots to examine the effects of anti-tau antibodies on this process were found to include between-experiment variability in pTau band densities and poor resolution of high molecular weight pTau oligomers. The presence of bands representing immunoglobulins as well as pTau may also complicate interpretation of the western blots. Further studies are indicated to examine the effects of anti-pTau antibodies on phosphorylation of other tau amino acids in addition to S199. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Application of phosphothreonine antibodies to analysis of thylakoid phosphoproteins.\n\nPubMed\n\nRintamÃ¤ki, E; Salonen, M; Suoranta, U M; Carlberg, I; Andersson, B; Aro, E M\n\n1997-11-28\n\nAn immunological approach using a polyclonal phosphothreonine antibody is introduced for the analysis of thylakoid protein phosphorylation in vivo. Virtually the same photosystem II (PSII) core phosphoproteins (D1, D2, CP43, and the psbH gene product) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex II (LHCII) phosphopolypeptides (LHCB1 and LHCB2), as earlier identified by radiolabeling experiments, were recognized in both pumpkin and spinach leaves. Notably, the PSII core proteins and LHCII polypeptides were found to have a different phosphorylation pattern in vivo with respect to increasing irradiance. Phosphorylation of the PSII core proteins in leaf discs attained the saturation level at the growth light intensity, and this level was also maintained at high irradiances. Maximal phosphorylation of LHCII polypeptides only occurred at low light intensities, far below the growth irradiance, and then drastically decreased at higher irradiances. These observations are at variance with traditional studies in vitro, where LHCII shows a light-dependent increase in phosphorylation, which is maintained even at high irradiances. Only a slow restoration of the phosphorylation capacity for LHCII polypeptides at the low light conditions occurred in vivo after the high light-induced inactivation. Furthermore, if thylakoid membranes were isolated from the high light-inactivated leaves, no restoration of LHCII phosphorylation took place in vitro. However, both the high light-induced inactivation and low light-induced restoration of LHCII phosphorylation seen in vivo could be mimicked in isolated thylakoid membranes by incubating with reduced and oxidized dithiothreitol, respectively. We propose that stromal components are involved in the regulation of LHCII phosphorylation in vivo, and inhibition of LHCII phosphorylation under increasing irradiance results from reduction of the thiol groups in the LHCII kinase.\n\nIntensive training and reduced volume increases muscle FXYD1 expression and phosphorylation at rest and during exercise in athletes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nThomassen, Martin; Gunnarsson, Thomas P.; Christensen, Peter M.; Pavlovic, Davor; Shattock, Michael J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe present study examined the effect of intensive training in combination with marked reduction in training volume on phospholemman (FXYD1) expression and phosphorylation at rest and during exercise. Eight well-trained cyclists replaced their regular training with speed-endurance training (10â12 Ã â¼30-s sprints) two or three times per week and aerobic high-intensity training (4â5 Ã 3â4 min at 90â95% of peak aerobic power output) 1â2 times per week for 7 wk and reduced the training volume by 70%. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and during a repeated high-intensity exercise protocol, and protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by Western blot analysis. Expression of FXYD1 (30%), actin (40%), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (12%), phospholamban (PLN) (16%), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) Î³/Î´ (25%) was higher (P < 0.05) than before the training intervention. In addition, after the intervention, nonspecific FXYD1 phosphorylation was higher (P < 0.05) at rest and during exercise, mainly achieved by an increased FXYD1 Ser-68 phosphorylation, compared with before the intervention. CaMKII, Thr-287, and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 Thr-56 phosphorylation at rest and during exercise, overall PKCÎ±/Î², Thr-638/641, and mTOR Ser-2448 phosphorylation during repeated intense exercise as well as resting PLN Thr-17 phosphorylation were also higher (P < 0.05) compared with before the intervention period. Thus, a period of high-intensity training with reduced training volume increases expression and phosphorylation levels of FXYD1, which may affect Na+/K+ pump activity and muscle K+ homeostasis during intense exercise. Furthermore, higher expression of CaMKII and PLN, as well as increased phosphorylation of CaMKII Thr-287 may have improved intracellular Ca2+ handling.

Aggregated Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and hyperphosphorylated tau are the hallmarks of AD. Hyperphosphorylated tau has been detected in diabetic animals as well as in diabetic patients. Folates mediate the transfer of one carbon unit, required in various biochemical reactions. The effect of folate on tau phosphorylation in diabetic models still remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of folic acid on hyperphosphorylation of tau in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Diabetic mice induced by STZ, at the age of 10 weeks, were administered with three levels of folic acid: folic acid-deficient diet, diet with normal folic acid content, and 120 Î¼g/kg folic acid diet for 8 weeks. Levels of serum folate and blood glucose were monitored. Tau phosphorylation, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) methylation, and Glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²) phosphorylation were detected using Western blot. The S-adenosyl methionine:S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio (SAM:SAH) in brain tissues was also determined. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA expression levels were detected using real-time PCR. Folic acid reduced tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396 in the brain of diabetes mellitus (DM) mice. In addition, PP2A methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression were significantly increased in DM mice post folic acid treatment. GSK-3Î² phosphorylation was not regulated by folic acid administration. Folic acid can reduce tau phosphorylation by regulating PP2A methylation in diabetic mice. These results support that folic acid can serve as a multitarget neuronal therapeutic agent for treating diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.

While the first three compounds were able to block the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, pergolide failed to do so (up to 100 microM). The inhibitory effect of dopamine, apomorphine and phenylethylamine was also evident in serum-starved insulin-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Apomorphine also inhibited the proliferation of the human oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) and prostate carcinoma (LNCaP) cell lines. In a second set of experiments, we measured the ability of dopamine, apomorphine, phenylethylamine and pergolide to inhibit the phosphorylation (or increase the dephosphorylation) of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, a major intracellular substrate of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor. Dopamine, apomorphine and phenylethylamine all reduced to zero the level of phosphorylated IRS-1 with potencies ranging between 0.01 and 1 microM. Finally, we found that fibroblasts from IRS-1 null (-/-) mice were less sensitive to the anti-proliferative effect of apomorphine compared to fibroblasts from wild type-mice, suggesting that the inhibition of IRS-1 phosphorylation by apomorphine is an important aspect of the activity of this compound.\n\nIncreasing plasma [K+] by intravenous potassium infusion reduces NCC phosphorylation and drives kaliuresis and natriuresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRengarajan, Srinivas; Lee, Donna H; Oh, Young Taek; Delpire, Eric; Youn, Jang H; McDonough, Alicia A\n\n2014-05-01\n\nDietary potassium loading results in rapid kaliuresis, natriuresis, and diuresis associated with reduced phosphorylation (p) of the distal tubule Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC). Decreased NCC-p inhibits NCC-mediated Na(+) reabsorption and shifts Na(+) downstream for reabsorption by epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaC), which can drive K(+) secretion. Whether the signal is initiated by ingesting potassium or a rise in plasma K(+) concentration ([K(+)]) is not understood. We tested the hypothesis, in male rats, that an increase in plasma [K(+)] is sufficient to reduce NCC-p and drive kaliuresis. After an overnight fast, a single 3-h 2% potassium (2%K) containing meal increased plasma [K(+)] from 4.0 Â± 0.1 to 5.2 Â± 0.2 mM; increased urinary K(+), Na(+), and volume excretion; decreased NCC-p by 60%; and marginally reduced cortical Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC) phosphorylation 25% (P = 0.055). When plasma [K(+)] was increased by tail vein infusion of KCl to 5.5 Â± 0.1 mM over 3 h, significant kaliuresis and natriuresis ensued, NCC-p decreased by 60%, and STE20/SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) phosphorylation was marginally reduced 35% (P = 0.052). The following were unchanged at 3 h by either the potassium-rich meal or KCl infusion: Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3), NHE3-p, NKCC, ENaC subunits, and renal outer medullary K(+) channel. In summary, raising plasma [K(+)] by intravenous infusion to a level equivalent to that observed after a single potassium-rich meal triggers renal kaliuretic and natriuretic responses, independent of K(+) ingestion, likely driven by decreased NCC-p and activity sufficient to shift sodium reabsorption downstream to where Na(+) reabsorption and flow drive K(+) secretion.\n\nAtorvastatin reduces lipid accumulation in the liver by activating protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of perilipin 5.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Xing; Nan, Yang; Zhao, Yuanlin; Yuan, Yuan; Ren, Bincheng; Sun, Chao; Cao, Kaiyu; Yu, Ming; Feng, Xuyang; Ye, Jing\n\n2017-12-01\n\nStatins have been proven to be effective in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, it was reported that statins decreased the hepatic expression of perilipin 5 (Plin5), a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, which plays critical roles in regulating lipid accumulation and lipolysis in liver. However, the function and regulation mechanism of Plin5 have not yet been well-established in NAFLD treatment with statins. In this study, we observed that atorvastatin moderately reduced the expression of Plin5 in livers without changing the protein level of Plin5 in the hepatic LD fraction of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Intriguingly, atorvastatin stimulated the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Plin5 and reduced the triglyceride (TG) accumulation in hepatocytes with overexpression of wide type (Plin5-WT) compared to serine-155 mutant Plin5 (Plin5-S155A). Moreover, PKA-stimulated FA release of purified LDs carrying Plin5-WT but not Plin5-S155A. Glucagon, a PKA activator, stimulated the phosphorylation of Plin5-WT and inhibited its interaction with CGI-58. The results indicated that atorvastatin promoted lipolysis and reduced TG accumulation in the liver by increasing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Plin5. This new mechanism of lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin might provide a new strategy for NAFLD treatment. Copyright Â© 2017.

Reduced levels of growth hormone and IGF-1, which mediate some of the protective effects of CR, can also extend longevity and/or protect against age-related diseases in rodents and humans. However, severely restricted diets are difficult to maintain and are associated with chronically low weight and other major side effects. Here we show that 4 months of periodic protein restriction cycles (PRCs) with supplementation of nonessential amino acids in mice already displaying significant cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology reduced circulating IGF-1 levels by 30-70% and caused an 8-fold increase in IGFBP-1. Whereas PRCs did not affect the levels of Î² amyloid (AÎ²), they decreased tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus and alleviated the age-dependent impairment in cognitive performance. These results indicate that periodic protein restriction cycles without CR can promote changes in circulating growth factors and tau phosphorylation associated with protection against age-related neuropathologies.

Nitric oxide (NO) produced by NO synthase 3 (NOS3) inhibits NaCl transport by this segment. In contrast, chronic angiotensin II (ANG II) infusion increases net thick ascending limb transport. NOS3 activity is regulated by changes in expression and phosphorylation at threonine 495 (T495) and serine 1177 (S1177), inhibitory and stimulatory sites, respectively. We hypothesized that NO production by thick ascending limbs is impaired by chronic ANG II infusion, due to reduced NOS3 expression, increased phosphorylation of T495, and decreased phosphorylation of S1177.

One-day ANG II infusion had no significant effect. NO production in response to endothelin-1 was blunted in thick ascending limbs from ANG II-infused animals [ANG II â0.01 Â± 0.06 arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU)/min vs. 0.17 Â± 0.02 AFU/min in controls; P < 0.01].

To understand the function of FA proteins in cellular division events, we investigated the interaction between Stathmin-1 (STMN1) and the FA group C (FANCC) protein. STMN1 is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein that regulates microtubule dynamics. STMN1 activities are regulated through phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanisms that control assembly of the mitotic spindle, and dysregulation of STMN1 phosphorylation is associated with mitotic aberrancies leading to chromosome instability and cancer progression. Using different biochemical approaches, we showed that FANCC interacts and co-localizes with STMN1 at centrosomes during mitosis. We also showed that FANCC is required for STMN1 phosphorylation, as mutations in FANCC reduced serine 16- and 38-phosphorylated forms of STMN1. Phosphorylation of STMN1 at serine 16 is likely an event dependent on a functional FA pathway, as it is reduced in FANCA- and FANCD2-mutant cells. Furthermore, FA-mutant cells exhibited mitotic spindle anomalies such as supernumerary centrosomes and shorter mitotic spindles. These results suggest that FA proteins participate in the regulation of cellular division via the microtubule-associated protein STMN1.

In this study, we defined S181 as a specific phosphorylation site required to license the oncogenic function of mutant KRAS in vivo. The phosphomutant S181A failed to induce tumors in mice, whereas the phosphomimetic mutant S181D exhibited an enhanced tumor formation capacity, compared with the wild-type KRAS protein. Reduced growth of tumors composed of cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable KRAS S181A mutant was correlated with increased apoptosis. Conversely, increased growth of tumors composed of cells expressing the phosphomimetic KRAS S181D mutant was correlated with increased activation of AKT and ERK, two major downstream effectors of KRAS. Pharmacologic treatment with PKC inhibitors impaired tumor growth associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated KRAS and reduced effector activation. In a panel of human tumor cell lines expressing various KRAS isoforms, we showed that KRAS phosphorylation was essential for survival and tumorigenic activity. Furthermore, we identified phosphorylated KRAS in a panel of primary human pancreatic tumors. Taken together, our findings establish that KRAS requires S181 phosphorylation to manifest its oncogenic properties, implying that its inhibition represents a relevant target to attack KRAS-driven tumors.

Having known protective effects of GSH in terms of a potent antioxidant, we evaluated capacitation, tyrosine phosphorylation and apoptosis like changes in bull spermatozoa after freezing and thawing in egg yolk tris glycerol extender containing (0.5m M-GSH-T1 & 1mM GSH-T2) and without GSH serving as the control (C). Forty ejaculates were collected from four Hariana bulls and were pooled due to non significant variations among the bull ejaculates for the evaluation of sperm attributes. Capacitation like changes, tyrosine phosphorylation, localization of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, apoptosis like changes in terms of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and DNA fragmentation after final dilution, 4h of equilibration at 4Â°C and 24h after freezing and thawing were evaluated. GSH supplementation at 0.5mM showed significant reduction in B- and AR- pattern spermatozoa during all stages of semen freezing and thawing. Immunoblot revealed six proteins which were tyrosine phosphorylated and protein of 30 and 75kDa (p30, p75) were the major tyrosine phosphorylted proteins. On further analysis, the p30 showed differential variation in intensity in all the three groups after freezing and thawing. Positive immune reactivity for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was found in neck, middle piece and post-acrosomal regions of spermatozoa. Addition of 0.5mM GSH decreased percentage of spermatozoa showing fragmented DNA and increased the percentage of spermatozoa having high transmembrane mitochondrial potential (P<0.05). This study demonstrates that GSH favours survival of bull spermatozoa by interfering with apoptotic and cryocapacitation pathways, and thereby protects the\n\nReduced Ribosomal Protein S6 Phosphorylation following Progressive Resistance Exercise in Growing Adolescent Rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHellyer, Nathan J.; Nokleby, Jessica J.; Thicke, Bethany M.; Zhan, Wen-Zhi; Sieck, Gary C.; Mantilla, Carlos B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to investigate moderate intensity progressive resistance exercise (PRE) in growing adolescent rats and its effect on muscle hypertrophy (defined as an increase in fiber cross-sectional area). We hypothesized that in adolescent animals moderate intensity PRE would increase: 1) fiber cross-sectional area (CSA); 2) myosin heavy chain (MyHC) content; and 3) expression and phosphorylation of cell signaling molecules involved in translational regulation, compared to age-matched sedentary controls (SED). In the PRE group, three-week old male rats were trained to climb a vertical ladder as a mode of PRE training such that by 10 weeks, all animals in the PRE group had progressed to carry an additional 80% of body weight per climb. In agreement with our hypotheses, we observed that 10 weeks of moderate PRE in adolescent animals was sufficient to increase CSA of muscle fibers and increase MyHC content. Average muscle fiber CSA increased by greater than 10% and total MyHC content increased by 35% (p<0.05) in the PRE group compared to SED animals. Concurrently, we investigated sustained changes in the expression and phosphorylation of key signaling molecules that are previously identified regulators of hypertrophy in adult animal models. Contrary to our hypotheses, expression and phosphorylation of the translational regulators mTOR and Akt were not increased in the PRE group. In addition, we observed that the ratio of phosphorylated-to-unphosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) was reduced over six-fold in PRE animals (p<0.05) and total rpS6 protein levels were unchanged between PRE and sedentary animals (p>0.05). We conclude that moderate intensity PRE is sufficient to induce muscle hypertrophy in adolescent animals while the signaling mechanisms associated with muscle hypertrophy may differ between growing adolescents and adults.

Insulin stimulates interaction between IRÎ² and PKR, double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, also known as EIF2AK2, and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PKR, as analyzed by immunoprecipitation and pull down assays using anti-IRÎ² and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, recombinant IRÎ² and immunopurified PKR. Further polyIC or synthetic double stranded RNA-induced threonine phosphorylation or activation of immunopurified and cellular PKR is suppressed in the presence of insulin treated purified IRÎ² and cell extracts. Acute, but not chronic, insulin treatment enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of IRÎ², its interaction with PKR and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKR. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide that stimulates threonine phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2Î± phosphorylation and AG 1024, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of IRÎ², reduces PKR association with the receptor, IRÎ² in HepG2 cells. These findings therefore may suggest that tyrosine phosphorylated PKR plays a role in the regulation of insulin induced protein synthesis and in maintaining insulin sensitivity, whereas, suppression of polyIC-mediated threonine phosphorylation of PKR by insulin compromises its ability to fight against virus infection in host cells.

However, the relationship between CTRP1 and insulin resistance is still not established. This study aimed to explore the role of CTRP1 under the situation of insulin resistance in adipose tissue. Plasma CTRP1 level was investigated in type 2 diabetic subjects (n = 35) and non-diabetic subjects (n = 35). The relationship between CTRP1 and phosphorylation of multi insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) serine (Ser) sites was further explored. Our data showed that Plasma CTRP1 was higher and negative correlation with insulin resistance in diabetic subjects (r = -0.283, p = 0.018). Glucose utilisation test revealed that the glucose utilisation rate of mature adipocytes was improved by CTRP1 in the presence of insulin. CTRP1 was not only related to IRS-1 protein, but also negatively correlated with IRS-1 Ser1101 phosphorylation (r = -0.398, p = 0.031). Furthermore, Phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 Ser1101 were significantly lower after incubation with 40 ng/mL CTRP1 in mature adipocytes than those with no intervention (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between CTRP1 and other IRS-1 serine sites (Ser302, Ser307, Ser612, Ser636/639, and Ser789). Collectively, our results suggested that CTRP1 might improve insulin resistance by reducing the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser1101, induced in the situation of insulin resistance as a feedback adipokine.\n\nHsp20 Interacting with Phosphorylated Akt Reduces Doxorubicin-Triggered Oxidative Stress and Cardiotoxicity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFan, Guo-Chang; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Wang, Xiaohong; Song, Guojie; Qian, Jiang; Nicolaou, Persoulla; Chen, Guoli; Ren, Xiaoping; Kranias, Evangelia G.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDoxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used antitumor drug, but its application is limited due to its cardiotoxic side effects. Hsp20 has been recently shown to protect cardiomyocytes against apoptosis, induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury or by prolonged Î²-agonist stimulation. However, it is not clear whether Hsp20 would exert similar protective effects against DOX-induced cardiac injury. Actually, DOX-treatment was associated with down-regulation of Hsp20 in the heart. To elucidate the role of Hsp20 in DOX-triggered cardiac toxicity, Hsp20 was first overexpressed ex vivo by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Increased Hsp20 levels conferred higher resistance to DOX-induced cell death, compared to GFP-control. Furthermore, cardiac-specific overexpression of Hsp20 in vivo significantly ameliorated acute DOX-triggered cardiomyocyte apoptosis and animal mortality. Hsp20-transgenic mice also showed improved cardiac function and prolonged survival after chronic administration of DOX. The mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects were associated with preserved Akt phosphorylation/activity and attenuation of DOX-induced oxidative stress. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed an interaction between Hsp20 and phosphorylated Akt. Accordingly, BAD phosphorylation was preserved and cleaved caspase-3 was decreased in DOX-treated Hsp20-TG hearts, consistent with the Hsp20's anti-apoptotic effects. Parallel ex vivo experiments showed that either infection with a dominant-negative Akt adenovirus or pre-incubation of cardiomyocytes with the PI3-kinase inhibitors significantly attenuated the protective effects of Hsp20. Taken together, our findings indicate that overexpression of Hsp20 inhibits DOX-triggered cardiac injury, and these beneficial effects appear to be dependent on Akt activation. Thus, Hsp20 may constitute a new therapeutic target in ameliorating the cardiotoxic effects of DOX-treatment in cancer patients.

However, the interaction between oxidative stress and in vivo mitochondrial function is unclear. We used both pharmacological (2 week paraquat (PQ) treatment of wild type mice) and transgenic (mice lacking Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1â/â)) models to test the effect of oxidative stress on in vivo mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy were used to measure mitochondrial ATP and oxygen fluxes and cell energetic state. In both models of oxidative stress, coupling of oxidative phosphorylation was significantly lower (lower P/O) at rest in vivo in skeletal muscle and was dose-dependent in the PQ model. Despite this reduction in efficiency, in vivo mitochondrial phosphorylation capacity (ATPmax) was maintained in both models, and ex vivo mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized muscle fibers was unchanged following PQ treatment. In association with the reduced P/O, PQ treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in PCr/ATP ratio and increased phosphorylation of AMPK. These results indicate that oxidative stress uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in vivo and results in energetic stress in the absence of defects in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

However, the host kinases that phosphorylate NS5A have not been fully identified. Here, we show that HCV particle assembly involves the phosphorylation of NS5A by the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of c-Abl reduces the production of infectious HCV (J6/JFH1) particles in Huh-7.5 cells without markedly affecting viral RNA translation and replication. NS5A is tyrosine-phosphorylated in HCV-infected cells, and this phosphorylation is also reduced by the knockdown of c-Abl. Mutational analysis reveals that NS5A tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent, at least in part, on Tyr(330) (Tyr(2306) in polyprotein numbering). Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine reduces the production of infectious HCV particles but does not affect the replication of the JFH1 subgenomic replicon. These findings suggest that c-Abl promotes HCV particle assembly by phosphorylating NS5A at Tyr(330).

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Depletion of hINO80 significantly reduced nuclear dots intensity of RAD18 after UV irradiation. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Western blot analyses showed phosphorylated hINO80 C-terminus. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Overexpression of phosphorylation mutant hINO80 reduced PCNA ubiquitination. -- Abstract: Double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most serious type of DNA damage. DSBs can be generated directly by exposure to ionizing radiation or indirectly by replication fork collapse. The DNA damage tolerance pathway, which is conserved from bacteria to humans, prevents this collapse by overcoming replication blockages. The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex plays an important role in themoreÂ Â» DNA damage response. The yeast INO80 complex participates in the DNA damage tolerance pathway. The mechanisms regulating yINO80 complex are not fully understood, but yeast INO80 complex are necessary for efficient proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ubiquitination and for recruitment of Rad18 to replication forks. In contrast, the function of the mammalian INO80 complex in DNA damage tolerance is less clear. Here, we show that human INO80 was necessary for PCNA ubiquitination and recruitment of Rad18 to DNA damage sites. Moreover, the C-terminal region of human INO80 was phosphorylated, and overexpression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of human INO80 resulted in decreased ubiquitination of PCNA during DNA replication. These results suggest that the human INO80 complex, like the yeast complex, was involved in the DNA damage tolerance pathway and that phosphorylation of human INO80 was involved in the DNA damage tolerance pathway. These findings provide new insights into the DNA damage tolerance pathway in mammalian cells.Â«Â less\n\nIsoform-specific and Protein Kinase C-mediated Regulation of CTP:Phosphoethanolamine Cytidylyltransferase Phosphorylation*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPavlovic, Zvezdan; Zhu, Lin; Pereira, Leanne; Singh, Ratnesh Kumar; Cornell, Rosemary B.; Bakovic, Marica\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2) is the main regulatory enzyme for de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. There are two isoforms of Pcyt2, -Î± and -Î²; however, very little is known about their specific roles in this important metabolic pathway. We previously demonstrated increased phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis subsequent to elevated activity and phosphorylation of Pcyt2Î± and -Î² in MCF-7 breast cancer cells grown under conditions of serum deficiency. Mass spectroscopy analyses of Pcyt2 provided evidence for isoform-specific as well as shared phosphorylations. Pcyt2Î² was specifically phosphorylated at the end of the first cytidylyltransferase domain. Pcyt2Î± was phosphorylated within the Î±-specific motif that is spliced out in Pcyt2Î² and on two PKC consensus serine residues, Ser-215 and Ser-223. Single and double mutations of PKC consensus sites reduced Pcyt2Î± phosphorylation, activity, and phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis by 50â90%. The phosphorylation and activity of endogenous Pcyt2 were dramatically increased with phorbol esters and reduced by specific PKC inhibitors. In vitro translated Pcyt2Î± was phosphorylated by PKCÎ±, PKCÎ²I, and PKCÎ²II. Pcyt2Î± Ser-215 was also directly phosphorylated with PKCÎ±. Mapping of the Pcyt2Î±- and -Î²-phosphorylated sites to the solved structure of a human Pcyt2Î² showed that they clustered within and flanking the central linker region that connects the two catalytic domains and is a novel regulatory segment not present in other cytidylyltransferases. This study is the first to demonstrate differences in phosphorylation between Pcyt2 isoforms and to uncover the role of the PKC-regulated phosphorylation.

We show that GPR15 undergoes a constitutive endocytosis in the absence of ligand. The endocytosis was clathrin dependent and partially dependent on Î²-arrestin in HEK293 cells, and nearly half of the internalized GPR15 receptors were recycled to the plasma membrane. An Ala mutation of the distal C-terminal Arg-354 or Ser-357, which forms a consensus phosphorylation site for basophilic kinases, markedly reduced the endocytosis, whereas phosphomimetic mutation of Ser-357 to Asp did not. Ser-357 was phosphorylated in vitro by multiple kinases, including PKA and PKC, and pharmacological activation of these kinases enhanced both phosphorylation of Ser-357 and endocytosis of GPR15. These results suggested that Ser-357 phosphorylation critically controls the ligand-independent endocytosis of GPR15. The functional role of Ser-357 in endocytosis was distinct from that of a conserved Ser/Thr cluster in the more proximal C-terminus, which was responsible for the Î²-arrestinâ and GPCR kinaseâdependent endocytosis of GPR15. Thus phosphorylation signals may differentially control cell surface density of GPR15 through endocytosis.

How these phosphorylations affect the structure and enzymatic function of PTEN is poorly understood. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of PTEN regulation by phosphorylation, we generated semisynthetic site-specifically tetra-phosphorylated PTEN using expressed protein ligation. By employing a combination of biophysical and enzymatic approaches, we have found that purified tail-phosphorylated PTEN relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart shows reduced catalytic activity and membrane affinity and undergoes conformational compaction likely involving an intramolecular interaction between its C-tail and the C2 domain. Our results suggest that there is a competition between membrane phospholipids and PTEN phospho-tail for binding to the C2 domain. These findings reveal a key aspect of PTENâs regulation and suggest pharmacologic approaches for direct PTEN activation.

The number of phosphorylated sites on a protein (n) shows a significant increase from prokaryotes, with n = 7 sites, to eukaryotes, with examples having n >/= 150 sites. Multisite phosphorylation has many roles and site conservation indicates that increasing numbers of sites cannot be due merely to promiscuous phosphorylation. A substrate with n sites has an exponential number (2(n)) of phospho-forms and individual phospho-forms may have distinct biological effects. The distribution of these phospho-forms and how this distribution is regulated have remained unknown. Here we show that, when kinase and phosphatase act in opposition on a multisite substrate, the system can exhibit distinct stable phospho-form distributions at steady state and that the maximum number of such distributions increases with n. Whereas some stable distributions are focused on a single phospho-form, others are more diffuse, giving the phospho-proteome the potential to behave as a fluid regulatory network able to encode information and flexibly respond to varying demands. Such plasticity may underlie complex information processing in eukaryotic cells and suggests a functional advantage in having many sites. Our results follow from the unusual geometry of the steady-state phospho-form concentrations, which we show to constitute a rational algebraic curve, irrespective of n. We thereby reduce the complexity of calculating steady states from simulating 3 x 2(n) differential equations to solving two algebraic equations, while treating parameters symbolically. We anticipate that these methods can be extended to systems with multiple substrates and multiple enzymes catalysing different modifications, as found in posttranslational modification 'codes' such as the histone code.

E.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe structure of adenylate kinase from yeast ligated with the two-substrate-mimicking inhibitor Ap5A and Mg2+ has been refined to 1.96 A resolution. In addition, the refined structure of the same complex with a bound imidazole molecule replacing Mg2+ has been determined at 1.63 A. These structures indicate that replacing Mg2+ by imidazole disturbs the water structure and thus the complex. A comparison with the G-proteins shows that Mg2+ is exactly at the same position with respect to the phosphates. However, although the Mg2+ ligand sphere of the G-proteins is a regular octahedron containing peptide ligands, the reported adenylate kinase has no such ligands and an open octahedron leaving space for the Mg2+ to accompany the transferred phosphoryl group. A superposition of the known crystalline and therefore perturbed phosphoryl transfer geometries in the adenylate kinases demonstrates that all of them are close to the start of the forward reaction with bound ATP and AMP. Averaging all observed perturbed structures gives rise to a close approximation of the transition state, indicating in general how to establish an elusive transition state geometry. The average shows that the in-line phosphoryl transfer is associative, because there is no space for a dissociative metaphosphate intermediate. As a side result, the secondary dipole interaction in the alpha-helices of both protein structures has been quantified.

Whether vertebrates, which rely on a single beta-catenin gene, generate unique adhesive and signaling forms at the level of protein modification remains unresolved. We show that beta-catenin unphosphorylated at serine 37 (S37) and threonine 41 (T41), commonly referred to as transcriptionally Active beta-Catenin (ABC), is a minor nuclear-enriched monomeric form of beta-catenin in SW480 cells, which express low levels of E-cadherin. Despite earlier indications, the superior signaling activity of ABC is not due to reduced cadherin binding, as ABC is readily incorporated into cadherin contacts in E-cadherin-restored cells. Beta-catenin phosphorylated at serine 45 (S45) or threonine 41 (T41) (T41/S45) or along the GSK3 regulatory cassette S33, S37 or T41 (S33/37/T41), however, is largely unable to associate with cadherins. Beta-catenin phosphorylated at T41/S45 and unphosphorylated at S37 and T41 is predominantly nuclear, while beta-catenin phosphorylated at S33/37/T41 is mostly cytoplasmic, suggesting that beta-catenin hypophosphorylated at S37 and T41 may be more active in transcription due to its enhanced nuclear accumulation. Evidence that phosphorylation at T41/S45 can be spatially separated from phosphorylations at S33/37/T41 suggests that these phosphorylations may not always be coupled, raising the possibility that phosphorylation at S45 serves a distinct nuclear function.\n\nPhosphorylation-related modification at the dimer interface of 14-3-3Ï dramatically alters monomer interaction dynamics.\n\nPubMed\n\nDenison, Fiona C; GÃ¶kirmak, Tufan; Ferl, Robert J\n\n2014-01-01\n\n14-3-3 proteins are generally believed to function as dimers in a broad range of eukaryotic signaling pathways. The consequences of altering dimer stability are not fully understood. Phosphorylation at Ser58 in the dimer interface of mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms has been reported to destabilise dimers. An equivalent residue, Ser62, is present across most Arabidopsis isoforms but the effects of phosphorylation have not been studied in plants. Here, we assessed the effects of phosphorylation at the dimer interface of Arabidopsis 14-3-3Ï. Protein kinase A phosphorylated 14-3-3Ï at Ser62 and also at a previously unreported residue, Ser67, resulting in a monomer-sized band on native-PAGE. Phosphorylation at Ser62 alone, or with additional Ser67 phosphorylation, was investigated using phosphomimetic versions of 14-3-3Ï. In electrophoretic and chromatographic analyses, these mutants showed mobilities intermediate between dimers and monomers. Mobility was increased by detergents, by reducing protein concentration, or by increasing pH or temperature. Urea gradient gels showed complex structural transitions associated with alterations of dimer stability, including a previously unreported 14-3-3 aggregation phenomenon. Overall, our analyses showed that dimer interface modifications such as phosphorylation reduce dimer stability, dramatically affecting the monomer-dimer equilibrium and denaturation trajectory. These findings may have dramatic implications for 14-3-3 structure and function in vivo. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We have now demonstrated that cell-cell adhesion also induces marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1 and that disruption of cell-cell adhesion results in its dephosphorylation. An anti-E-cadherin antibody decreased cell-cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, whereas the expression of E-cadherin specifically induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1. A relatively selective inhibitor of Src family kinases reduced cell-cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, whereas expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Csk increased it. Disruption of cell-cell adhesion, which reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, also reduced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt in response to cell-cell adhesion. These results indicate that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion induces tyrosine phosphorylation by a Src family kinase of Gab-1, thereby regulating the activation of Ras/MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt cascades.\n\nProtein Phosphatase 1 Inhibitor-1 Deficiency Reduces Phosphorylation of Renal NaCl Cotransporter and Causes Arterial Hypotension\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPicard, Nicolas; Trompf, Katja; Yang, Chao-Ling; Miller, R. Lance; Carrel, Monique; Loffing-Cueni, Dominique; Fenton, Robert A.; Ellison, David H.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC) of the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) controls ion homeostasis and arterial BP. Loss-of-function mutations of NCC cause renal salt wasting with arterial hypotension (Gitelman syndrome). Conversely, mutations in the NCC-regulating WNK kinases or kelch-like 3 protein cause familial hyperkalemic hypertension. Here, we performed automated sorting of mouse DCTs and microarray analysis for comprehensive identification of novel DCT-enriched gene products, which may potentially regulate DCT and NCC function. This approach identified protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor-1 (I-1) as a DCT-enriched transcript, and immunohistochemistry revealed I-1 expression in mouse and human DCTs and thick ascending limbs. In heterologous expression systems, coexpression of NCC with I-1 increased thiazide-dependent Na+ uptake, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous I-1 reduced NCC phosphorylation. Likewise, levels of phosphorylated NCC decreased by approximately 50% in I-1 (I-1â/â) knockout mice without changes in total NCC expression. The abundance and phosphorylation of other renal sodium-transporting proteins, including NaPi-IIa, NKCC2, and ENaC, did not change, although the abundance of pendrin increased in these mice. The abundance, phosphorylation, and subcellular localization of SPAK were similar in wild-type (WT) and I-1â/â mice. Compared with WT mice, I-1â/â mice exhibited significantly lower arterial BP but did not display other metabolic features of NCC dysregulation. Thus, I-1 is a DCT-enriched gene product that controls arterial BP, possibly through regulation of NCC activity.

In the present study, the effect of acetaldehyde on the AJs and on the interactions between E-cadherin, Î²-catenin and PTP1B was determined in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Treatment of cell monolayers with acetaldehyde induced redistribution of E-cadherin and Î²-catenin from the intercellular junctions by a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. The PTPase activity associated with E-cadherin and Î²-catenin was significantly reduced and the interaction of PTP1B with E-cadherin and Î²-catenin was attenuated by acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Î²-catenin on tyrosine residues, and abolished the interaction of Î²-catenin with E-cadherin by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. Protein binding studies showed that the treatment of cells with acetaldehyde reduced the binding of Î²-catenin to the C-terminal region of E-cadherin. Pairwise binding studies using purified proteins indicated that the direct interaction between E-cadherin and Î²-catenin was reduced by tyrosine phosphorylation of Î²-catenin, but was unaffected by tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin-C. Treatment of cells with acetaldehyde also reduced the binding of E-cadherin to GST (glutathione S-transferase)âPTP1B. The pairwise binding study showed that GSTâE-cadherin-C binds to recombinant PTP1B, but this binding was significantly reduced by tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin. Acetaldehyde increased the phosphorylation of Î²-catenin on Tyr-331, Tyr-333, Tyr-654 and Tyr-670. These results show that acetaldehyde induces disruption of interactions between E-cadherin, Î²-catenin and PTP1B by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.

We have previously shown that cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, in particular tyrosine 421, promotes actin polymerization at newly-forming invadopodia, promoting their maturation to matrix-degrading structures. However, the mechanism by which cells regulate the cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle at invadopodia is unknown. Mena, an actin barbed-end capping protein antagonist, is expressed as various splice-isoforms. The MenaINV isoform is upregulated in migratory and invasive sub-populations of breast carcinoma cells, and is involved in tumor cell intravasation. Here we show that forced MenaINV expression increases invadopodium maturation to a far greater extent than equivalent expression of other Mena isoforms. MenaINV is recruited to invadopodium precursors just after their initial assembly at the plasma membrane, and promotes the phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 at invadopodia. In addition, we show that cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 is suppressed by the phosphatase PTP1B, and that PTP1B localization to the invadopodium is reduced by MenaINV expression. We conclude that MenaINV promotes invadopodium maturation by inhibiting normal dephosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421 by the phosphatase PTP1B.

Our recent studies have, however, suggested that an alternative route to GPCR phosphorylation may be an operation involving casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha). In the current study we investigate the involvement of CK1alpha in the phosphorylation of the human m3-muscarinic receptor in intact cells. We show that expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CK1alpha, designed to act in a dominant negative manner, inhibits agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation by approximately 40% in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that a peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (Ser(345)-Leu(463)) is an inhibitor of CK1alpha due to its ability to both act as a pseudo-substrate for CK1alpha and form a high affinity complex with CK1alpha. Expression of this peptide was able to reduce both basal and agonist-mediated m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. These results support the notion that CK1alpha is able to mediate GPCR phosphorylation in an agonist-dependent manner and that this may provide a novel mechanism for GPCR phosphorylation. The functional role of phosphorylation was investigated using a mutant of the m3-muscarinic receptor that showed an approximately 80% reduction in agonist-mediated phosphorylation. Surprisingly, this mutant underwent agonist-mediated desensitization suggesting that, unlike many GPCRs, desensitization of the m3-muscarinic receptor is not mediated by receptor phosphorylation. The inositol (1,4, 5)-trisphosphate response did, however, appear to be dramatically potentiated in the phosphorylation-deficient mutant indicating that phosphorylation may instead control the magnitude of the initial inositol phosphate response.\n\nCytokines Alter Glucocorticoid Receptor Phosphorylation in Airway Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBouazza, Belaid; Krytska, Kateryna; Debba-Pavard, Manel; Amrani, Yassine; Honkanen, Richard E.; Tran, Jennifer\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCorticosteroid insensitivity (CSI) represents a profound challenge in managing patients with asthma. We recently demonstrated that short exposure of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) to proasthmatic cytokines drastically reduced their responsiveness to glucocorticoids (GCs), an effect that was partially mediated via interferon regulatory factor-1, suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms (Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2008;38:463â472). Although GC receptor (GR) can be phosphorylated at multiple serines in the N-terminal region, the major phosphorylation sites critical for GR transcriptional activity are serines 211 (Ser211) and 226 (Ser226). We tested the novel hypothesis that cytokine-induced CSI in ASMCs is due to an impaired GR phosphorylation. Cells were treated with TNF-Î± (10 ng/ml) and IFN-Î³ (500 UI/ml) for 6 hours and/or fluticasone (100 nm) added 2 hours before. GR was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser226 but not at Ser211 residues. Cytokines dramatically suppressed fluticasone-induced phosphorylation of GR on Ser211 but not on Ser226 residues while increasing the expression of Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP)5 but not that of PP1 or PP2A. Transfection studies using a reporter construct containing GC responsive elements showed that the specific small interfering RNAâinduced mRNA knockdown of PP5, but not that of PP1 or PP2A, partially prevented the cytokine suppressive effects on GR-meditated transactivation activity. Similarly, cytokines failed to inhibit GC-induced GR-Ser211 phosphorylation when expression of PP5 was suppressed. We propose that the novel mechanism that proasthmatic cytokine-induced CSI in ASMCs is due, in part, to PP5-mediated impairment of GR-Ser211 phosphorylation.

Upon TGF-beta treatment, the highly homologous Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptor at the SSXS motif in the C-terminal tail. Here we show that in addition to the C-tail, three (S/T)-P sites in the Smad3 linker region, Ser(208), Ser(204), and Thr(179) are phosphorylated in response to TGF-beta. The linker phosphorylation peaks at 1 h after TGF-beta treatment, behind the peak of the C-tail phosphorylation. We provide evidence suggesting that the C-tail phosphorylation by the TGF-beta receptor is necessary for the TGF-beta-induced linker phosphorylation. Although the TGF-beta receptor is necessary for the linker phosphorylation, the receptor itself does not phosphorylate these sites. We further show that ERK is not responsible for TGF-beta-dependent phosphorylation of these three sites. We show that GSK3 accounts for TGF-beta-inducible Ser(204) phosphorylation. Flavopiridol, a pan-CDK inhibitor, abolishes TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Thr(179) and Ser(208), suggesting that the CDK family is responsible for phosphorylation of Thr(179) and Ser(208) in response to TGF-beta. Mutation of the linker phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues increases the ability of Smad3 to activate a TGF-beta/Smad-target gene as well as the growth-inhibitory function of Smad3. Thus, these observations suggest that TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 linker sites inhibits its antiproliferative activity.\n\nCotinine improves visual recognition memory and decreases cortical Tau phosphorylation in the Tg6799 mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrizzell, J Alex; Patel, Sagar; Barreto, George E; Echeverria, Valentina\n\n2017-08-01\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the progressive aggregation of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule associated protein Tau in the central nervous system. Cotinine, the main metabolite of nicotine, reduced working memory deficits, synaptic loss, and amyloid Î² peptide aggregation into oligomers and plaques as well as inhibited the cerebral Tau kinase, glycogen synthase 3Î² (GSK3Î²) in the transgenic (Tg)6799 (5XFAD) mice. In this study, the effect of cotinine on visual recognition memory and cortical Tau phosphorylation at the GSK3Î² sites Serine (Ser)-396/Ser-404 and phospho-CREB were investigated in the Tg6799 and non-transgenic (NT) littermate mice. Tg mice showed short-term visual recognition memory impairment in the novel object recognition test, and higher levels of Tau phosphorylation when compared to NT mice. Cotinine significantly improved visual recognition memory performance increased CREB phosphorylation and reduced cortical Tau phosphorylation. Potential mechanisms underlying theses beneficial effects are discussed. Copyright Â© 2017.

Phosphorylation reduces the magnitude of glycinergic synaptic currents, thereby disinhibiting nociceptive neurons. Although Î±1 and Î±3 subunits are both expressed on spinal nociceptive neurons, Î±3 is a more promising therapeutic target as its sparse expression elsewhere implies a reduced risk of side-effects. Here we compared glycine-mediated conformational changes in Î±1 and Î±3 GlyRs to identify structural differences that might be exploited in designing Î±3-specific analgesics. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry, we show that glycine-mediated conformational changes in the extracellular M2-M3 domain were significantly different between the two GlyR isoforms. Using a chimeric approach, we found that structural variations in the intracellular M3-M4 domain were responsible for this difference. This prompted us to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of S346 in Î±3 GlyR might also induce extracellular conformation changes. We show using both voltage-clamp fluorometry and pharmacology that Ser346 phosphorylation elicits structural changes in the Î±3 glycine-binding site. These results provide the first direct evidence for phosphorylation-mediated extracellular conformational changes in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, and thus suggest new loci for investigating how phosphorylation modulates structure and function in this receptor family. More importantly, by demonstrating that phosphorylation alters Î±3 GlyR glycine-binding site structure, they raise the possibility of developing analgesics that selectively target inflammation-modulated GlyRs.

GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg2+ ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C terminus. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking GUN4(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white gun4-2 null mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to gun4 knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-terminal extension, which harbors the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from Synechocystis and Chlamydomonas lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-terminal extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-terminal extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.

We have previously suggested that endogenous regulator of calcineurin (RCAN1, also known as DSCR1) is targeted by protein kinase A (PKA) for the control of calcineurin activity. In the present study, we characterized the PKA-mediated phosphorylation site in RCAN1 by mass spectrometric analysis and revealed that PKA directly phosphorylated RCAN1 at the Ser 93. PKA-induced phosphorylation and the increase in the half-life of the RCAN1 protein were prevented by the substitution of Ser 93 with AlamoreÂ Â» (S93A). Furthermore, the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RCAN1 at Ser 93 potentiated the inhibition of calcineurin-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression by RCAN1. Our results suggest the presence of a novel phosphorylation site in RCAN1 and that its phosphorylation influences calcineurin-dependent inflammatory target gene expression. - Highlights: â¢ We identify novel phosphorylation sites in RCAN1 by LC-MS/MS analysis. â¢ PKA-dependent phosphorylation of RCAN1 at Ser 93 inhibits calcineurin-mediated intracellular signaling. â¢ We show the immunosuppressive function of RCAN1 phosphorylation at Ser 93 in suppressing cytokine expression.Â«Â less\n\nThe effect of phosphorylation on arrestin-rhodopsin interaction in the squid visual system.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobinson, Kelly A; Ou, Wei-Lin; Guan, Xinyu; Sugamori, Kim S; Bandyopadhyay, Abhishek; Ernst, Oliver P; Mitchell, Jane\n\n2015-12-01\n\nInvertebrate visual opsins are G protein-coupled receptors coupled to retinoid chromophores that isomerize reversibly between inactive rhodopsin and active metarhodopsin upon absorption of photons of light. The squid visual system has an arrestin protein that binds to metarhodopsin to block signaling to Gq and activation of phospholipase C. Squid rhodopsin kinase (SQRK) can phosphorylate both metarhodopsin and arrestin, a dual role that is unique among the G protein-coupled receptor kinases. The sites and role of arrestin phosphorylation by SQRK were investigated here using recombinant proteins. Arrestin was phosphorylated on serine 392 and serine 397 in the C-terminus. Unphosphorylated arrestin bound to metarhodopsin and phosphorylated metarhodopsin with similar high affinities (Kd 33 and 21 nM respectively), while phosphorylation of arrestin reduced the affinity 3- to 5-fold (Kd 104 nM). Phosphorylation of metarhodopsin slightly increased the dissociation of arrestin observed during a 1 hour incubation. Together these studies suggest a unique role for SQRK in phosphorylating both receptor and arrestin and inhibiting the binding of these two proteins in the squid visual system. Invertebrate visual systems are inactivated by arrestin binding to metarhodopsin that does not require receptor phosphorylation. Here we show that squid rhodopsin kinase phosphorylates arrestin on two serines (S392,S397) in the C-terminus and phosphorylation decreases the affinity of arrestin for squid metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin phosphorylation has very little effect on arrestin binding but does increase arrestin dissociation.

But glycogen phosphorylation lay fallow until interest was rekindled in the mid 2000s by the finding that it could be removed by a glycogen-binding phosphatase, laforin, and that mutations in laforin cause a fatal teenage-onset epilepsy, called Lafora disease. Glycogen phosphorylation is due to phosphomonoesters at C2, C3 and C6 of glucose residues. Phosphate is rare, ranging from 1:500 to 1:5000 phosphates/glucose depending on the glycogen source. The mechanisms of glycogen phosphorylation remain under investigation but one hypothesis to explain C2 and perhaps C3 phosphate is that it results from a rare side reaction of the normal synthetic enzyme glycogen synthase. Lafora disease is likely caused by over-accumulation of abnormal glycogen in insoluble deposits termed Lafora bodies in neurons. The abnormality in the glycogen correlates with elevated phosphorylation (at C2, C3 and C6), reduced branching, insolubility and an enhanced tendency to aggregate and become insoluble.

Their regulation by phosphorylation has been shown to modulate their routing and activity. TRPC6 activity increases following phosphorylation by Fyn, and is inhibited by protein kinase G and protein kinase C. A previous study by our group showed that TRPC6 is phosphorylated under unstimulated conditions in a human embryonic kidney cells line (HEK293). To investigate the mechanism responsible for this phosphorylation, we used a MS/MS approach combined with metabolic labeling and showed that the serine at position 814 is phosphorylated in unstimulated cells. The mutation of Ser(814) into Ala decreased basal phosphorylation but did not modify TRPC6 activity. Even though Ser(814) is within a consensus site for casein kinase II (CK2), we showed that CK2 is not involved in the phosphorylation of TRPC6 and does not modify its activity. In summary, we identified a new basal phosphorylation site (Ser(814)) on TRPC6 and showed that CK2 is not responsible for the phosphorylation of this site.\n\nThe Serine 814 of TRPC6 Is Phosphorylated under Unstimulated Conditions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBousquet, Simon M.; Monet, Michael; Boulay, Guylain\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTRPC are nonselective cation channels involved in calcium entry. Their regulation by phosphorylation has been shown to modulate their routing and activity. TRPC6 activity increases following phosphorylation by Fyn, and is inhibited by protein kinase G and protein kinase C. A previous study by our group showed that TRPC6 is phosphorylated under unstimulated conditions in a human embryonic kidney cells line (HEK293). To investigate the mechanism responsible for this phosphorylation, we used a MS/MS approach combined with metabolic labeling and showed that the serine at position 814 is phosphorylated in unstimulated cells. The mutation of Ser814 into Ala decreased basal phosphorylation but did not modify TRPC6 activity. Even though Ser814 is within a consensus site for casein kinase II (CK2), we showed that CK2 is not involved in the phosphorylation of TRPC6 and does not modify its activity. In summary, we identified a new basal phosphorylation site (Ser814) on TRPC6 and showed that CK2 is not responsible for the phosphorylation of this site.

A previous pharmacogenomic study revealed the importance of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity in a response on paclitaxel. However, a subsequent research showed that the expression level of CDK1 failed to show significant correlation with delayed apoptosis and patient survival. Rather, the expression and phosphorylation of capase-9, the downstream target molecule of CDK1, appeared to determine drug resistance. Our results suggest that treatment with the CDK1 inhibitor alsterpaullone reduces phosphorylation of caspase-9. Its phosphorylation level was dependent on CDK1 activity and it directs paclitaxel resistance. This observation was reproducible in xenografted tumors. Thus, the regulation of caspase-9 may be a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse paclitaxel-induced resistance in ovarian cancer cells.\n\nRegulation of the autophagy protein LC3 by phosphorylation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCherra, Salvatore J.; Kulich, Scott M.; Uechi, Guy; Balasubramani, Manimalha; Mountzouris, John; Day, Billy W.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMacroautophagy is a major catabolic pathway that impacts cell survival, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and neurodegeneration. Although bulk degradation sustains carbon sources during starvation, autophagy contributes to shrinkage of differentiated neuronal processes. Identification of autophagy-related genes has spurred rapid advances in understanding the recruitment of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in autophagy induction, although braking mechanisms remain less understood. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a direct protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site on LC3 that regulates its participation in autophagy. Both metabolic (rapamycin) and pathological (MPP+) inducers of autophagy caused dephosphorylation of endogenous LC3. The pseudophosphorylated LC3 mutant showed reduced recruitment to autophagosomes, whereas the nonphosphorylatable mutant exhibited enhanced puncta formation. Finally, autophagy-dependent neurite shortening induced by expression of a Parkinson diseaseâassociated G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 was inhibited by dibutyrylâcyclic adenosine monophosphate, cytoplasmic expression of the PKA catalytic subunit, or the LC3 phosphorylation mimic. These data demonstrate a role for phosphorylation in regulating LC3 activity.
