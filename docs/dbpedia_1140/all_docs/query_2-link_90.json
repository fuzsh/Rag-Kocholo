        "text": "Various transcription factors act as nuclear effectors of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. These are the products of three genes in the mouse, CREB, CRE modulator (CREM), and ATF-1. CREM proteins are thought to play important roles within the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and in the control of rhythmic functions in the pineal gland. We have generated CREM-mutant mice and investigated their response in a variety of behavioral tests. CREM-null mice show a drastic increase in locomotion. In contrast to normal mice, the CREM-deficient mice show equal locomotor activity during the circadian cycle. The anatomy of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the center of the endogenous pacemaker, is normal in mutant mice. Remarkably, CREM mutant mice also elicit a different emotional state, revealed by a lower anxiety in two different behavioral models, but they preserve the conditioned reactiveness to stress. These results demonstrate the high degree of functional specificity of each cAMP..."
