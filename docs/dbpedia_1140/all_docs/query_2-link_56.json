        "text": "To evaluate the functional importance of these elements, we constructed a series of plasmids containing site-directed mutations in Sp1- and C/EBPα-binding sites and evaluated their transcriptional activities in luciferase assays (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the Sp1-binding site and second C/EBPα-binding site (pCRMP-1 M9 and M10, respectively) in nucleotides -180 to +50 fragment had no effect on human CRMP-1 transcriptional activity. However, when nucleotides -126 and -127 in the C/EBPα-binding site were mutated from AG to GA (pCRMP-1 M2), the promoter activity was decreased substantially (∼60%) compared with that of the pCRMP-1 M1 plasmid. Introduction of this mutation at the corresponding site in nucleotides -1,920 to +50 fragment (pCRMP-1 M11) resulted in a similar decrease in activity.\n\nTo determine the length of this response element, we then mutated various sites adjacent to nucleotides -126 and -127 as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Luciferase activity decreased 25% to 50% in the M3, M4, and M5 plasmids containing mutations at nucleotides -131/-130, -122/-121, and -133/-132, respectively, but more distal mutations (M6 and M7 plasmids) had no effect. When the region from nucleotides -180 to -117 was deleted from pCRMP-1(-180/+50), luciferase activity decreased by ∼60% relative to the wild-type pCRMP-1 plasmid (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also noted for pCRMP-1(-180/+50) plasmids containing mutations to different nucleotides at -126 and -127. Collectively, our results suggest that the region between nucleotides -122 and -133 (GGGAGGAGCTGT) is crucial for the proximal promoter activity of human CRMP-1. Importantly, the element containing the C/EBPα-binding site (from -126 to -133) is located in this region as indicated in Fig. 1B.\n\nWhen pCRMP-1(-117/+50) was mutated at either one or both of the putative Sp1 sites that overlap the C/EBPα-binding site, there was a modest additional decrease in luciferase activity (∼25%): from ∼0.4-fold that of nucleotides -180/+50 fragment containing nucleotides -126 to -133 binding site to 0.25-fold. This indicates that the region from nucleotides -100 to -117 makes a relatively minor contribution to overall activity compared with the region from nucleotides -126 to -133 (Fig. 2B). The results obtained with pCRMP-1(-180/+50) plasmids containing only mutations in nucleotides -100 to -117 site (M9 and M10) were also consistent with this interpretation (Fig. 2A). We conclude from these results that the novel binding site at nucleotides -126 to -133 is a significant regulator of human CRMP-1 promoter activity.\n\nInterestingly, the luciferase activity of the pCRMP-1(-99/+50) plasmid containing two extra GGGAGGAGCTGT repeat sequences was very similar to that of the pCRMP-1(-180/+50) plasmid (Fig. 2C). The duplicate elements within the promoter increased the transcriptional activity ∼5-fold compared with that of pCRMP-1(-99/+50). Thus, the C/EBPα-binding sites contribute most of the promoter activity of CRMP-1. These results further confirm that the C/EBPα-binding site is a basal element in CRMP-1 transcriptional regulation.\n\nWe identified previously that CRMP-1 is an invasion and metastasis suppressor in lung cancer cells (9). CRMP-1 expression is negatively associated with poor overall survival and early postoperative relapse in lung cancer patients (9). The connective tissue growth factor can inhibit lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis by CRMP-1-dependent pathway and mediated through an integrin αvβ3 and αvβ5 regulated signaling (29). However, the detail mechanism of invasion suppressor function of CRMP-1 and its regulation were still not clear.\n\nIn this study, we identified a region between nucleotides -100 and -180 containing putative Sp1 and C/EBPα transcriptional regulatory elements as the basal promoter region of the novel invasion suppressor gene, CRMP-1. Overexpression of Sp1 suppressed CRMP-1 promoter activity and CRMP-1 protein expression, whereas overexpression of C/EBPα enhanced expression from the CRMP-1 promoter. Our data also showed that COX-2 overexpression decreased CRMP-1 mRNA and protein expression in human lung cancer cells. Conversely, COX-2 inhibitors induced a dose-dependent increase in CRMP-1 expression, with a concomitant inhibition of cell invasion. We showed that COX-2 inhibitors up-regulated endogenous CRMP-1 transcription by suppressing the formation of Sp1-DNA complexes and enhancing the binding of C/EBPα to the CRMP-1 promoter. These findings may increase our understanding of the mechanism of metastasis suppressor gene regulation and contribute to the development of new therapies targeting metastasis in cancer patients.\n\nThe CRMP-1 promoter lacks a TATA box and contains a CpG island, which has several Sp1-binding sites. Our data showed that the key basal regulatory element was located at nucleotides -100 to -180, a region that contains putative Sp1 and C/EBPα transcriptional regulatory elements. Site-directed mutagenesis data (e.g., plasmids M2-M5) indicated that the region between nucleotides -122 and -133 (GGGAGGAGCTGT) was crucial for the proximal promoter activity of human CRMP-1. Another important response element was located at nucleotides -100 to -117, which contains a sequence (CCCTCCTC) that is the complement of GGGAGGAG, suggesting that this sequence may be an important response element for transcription factors. In addition, we propose that the dimeric form of C/EBPα could bind the two inverted DNA sequences “GGGAGGAG” and “CTCCTCCC” in nucleotides -133 to -101 region. This interpretation is consistent with the ability of the M4 mutation, which is located outside of the defined C/EBPα-binding sites, to diminish reporter activity. Accordingly, because it lies between the two C/EBPα-binding sites, this mutation may cause structural or conformational changes that interfere with C/EBPα binding but not Sp1 binding. Although the -99/+50 region may contain an additional C/EBPα response element (Fig. 4A), the critical response element for the expression of CRMP-1 corresponds to the -180/-100 region.\n\nIn general, Sp1 binds to promoter Sp1 consensus sequences to activate gene expression. However, we found that Sp1 bound to a cis-acting regulatory element on the promoter of the metastasis suppressor gene, CRMP-1, to down-regulate gene expression. Previous studies have also suggested such a transcriptional repressor role for Sp1 binding in various cells. For example, increasing Sp1 protein and Sp1-binding capacity by stimulation with fibroblast growth factor-2 has been shown to decrease platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α transcription in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (29). Sp1 also inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by repressing CDKN1A (WAF1/CIP1) transcription via a cis-acting regulatory element in the promoter of the gene (30, 31).\n\nC/EBPα is a leucine-zipper transcription factor. It can occupy the activation response element on the COX-2 promoter and thereby abolish transcriptional activity and suppress COX-2 expression (32). The expression of C/EBPαis reduced in lung adenocarcinomas and at more advanced stages in other cancers. Same expression pattern was also observed in CRMP-1 in lung cancer tissue. The ectopic expression of C/EBPα in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines leads to reduced growth, increased apoptosis, and cell differentiation (33). C/EBPα up-regulates the tumor suppressor protein, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β, which plays an important role in airway epithelial differentiation (34). Thus, C/EBPα is a novel tumor suppressor protein that can trigger tumor suppressor-related gene expression in lung cancer. Our observation that COX-2 inhibition can increase C/EBPα protein expression and up-regulate CRMP-1 expression suggests that C/EBPα may play a role in countering cancer cell invasivity through CRMP-1 pathway.\n\nIt is often the case that the successful transactivation of a specific gene crucially depends on the precise spacing of two (or more) transcription factor binding sites (35). The lactoferrin gene promoter contains a C/EBPα site flanked by two Sp1 sites, and the interaction of these two transcription factors is required to activate gene expression (36). This DNA sequence motif is similar to that of the CRMP-1 gene promoter (Fig. 1), which is capable of binding these two transcription factors at its cis-acting response element (Fig. 3C). Forced expression of Sp1 or C/EBPα suppressed or induced CRMP-1 promoter activity, respectively. Sp1 and C/EBPα competed for binding to the overlapping C/EBPα and Sp1 sites and reciprocally regulated CRMP-1 expression. Tang et al. have shown that the promoter of the mouse C/EBPα gene, cebpa, contains a Sp1 consensus sequence, which overlaps with a consensus C/EBP recognition sequence. Further, they showed that Sp1 competes with C/EBP for binding to the coregulatory element and represses cebpa promoter activity. Decreasing the level of Sp1 facilitated the access of other C/EBP to the binding site and reactivated cebpa gene expression (37).\n\nCOX-2 is overexpressed in colon, lung, breast, prostate, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers (2, 18, 37–42) and has been implicated in regulating the malignant phenotype in lung cancer. However, the mechanism by which COX-2 acts to promote cancer invasion is still unclear. Recent reports have shown that prostaglandin E2, a COX-2 product, induces vascular endothelial growth factor via activation of Sp1 (43). Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the Sp1 transcription factor—by enhancing the expression of metastasis promoter genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (44–46), or repressing metastasis suppressor genes, such as RECK (47)—is critical for the induction of cancer metastasis by transforming growth factor-β, AKT, and HER-2/neu. In contrast, Sp1 knockdown inhibits cancer metastasis. This supports our finding that exogenous COX-2 in lung cancer cells negatively regulates the expression of the invasion suppressor, CRMP-1, through activation of Sp1. It also implies that COX-2 expression may promote cancer metastasis through activation of Sp1, which, as indicated, not only inactivates anti-invasive genes such as CRMP-1 but also activates metastasis-related genes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-2).\n\nCOX-2 inhibitors decrease Sp1 phosphorylation, Sp1-DNA binding, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in pancreatic cancer (48). Sp1 mRNA levels were unchanged in colon cancer cells after treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor, but Sp1 protein was decreased by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (49). By inducing the expression of the transcription factor EGR-1, which competes with Sp1 for overlapping DNA sequences, COX-2 inhibitors can also up-regulate the antitumorigenic protein, NAG-1 (50). We found that COX-2 inhibitors suppressed Sp1 in lung cancer cells, reducing Sp1-DNA binding at the promoter of CRMP-1 and allowing the transcription factor, C/EBPα, to compete more successfully with Sp1.\n\nIn conclusion, our work suggests a causal link between COX-2 expression and down-regulation of the invasion suppressor, CRMP-1, in human lung cancer cells. COX-2 inhibitors can up-regulate CRMP-1 through reciprocal regulation of Sp1 and C/EBPα at the promoter region of the CRMP-1 gene. Our study suggests that COX-2 inhibitors can inhibit cancer progression by activating an invasion suppressor, a pathway that represents a potential new target for the development of antimetastatic therapies."
