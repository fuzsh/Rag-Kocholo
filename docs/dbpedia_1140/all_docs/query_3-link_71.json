        "text": "CrMP-Sol database\n\nInformation of cancer-related membrane proteins at the genetic level are based on a previous transcriptome study, which is available on The Human Protein Atlas (HPA, https://www.proteinatlas.org/) [40,41,42]. Out of 20,090 entries in the database, 11,279 of the proteins are associated with cell membranes [43], where 1309 proteins are clinically relevant to 17 types of cancers, including: colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, liver cancer, testis cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, urothelial cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, stomach cancer, and ovarian cancer [41]. We classified these entries into 7 categories based on descriptions of their functions, which included 327 receptors, 161 transporters, 44 carriers, 124 channels, 201 enzymes, 109 contact proteins, and 344 others lacking apparent functional classifications. Other information about gene and protein expressions, distributions in organs, cell lines, immune cells and bloods are also available in the database [43].\n\nBesides pathogenesis data, critical genetic and molecular information regarding the protein functions are also presented in CrMP-Sol, which referred to NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), Uniprot and PDB. Genetic information consists of gene name, location, a summary of the gene encoding the protein, and open-source links. Molecular information includes name, primary sequence, subcellular locations, crystal and AlphaFold2 predicted structures, and descriptions about experimentally verified or proposed protein functions. The tissue and pathogenesis specificity are also presented.\n\nAs a core feature of our database, we designed water-soluble variants of all 1309 membrane proteins by QTY code [44]. Specifically, the primary sequences of these QTY variants, AlphaFold2 predicted structures, and superimpositions with native proteins are presented. It is proposed that these easy-to-synthesize, cost-efficient, more hydrophilic structural and functional equivalents of naturally hydrophobic proteins can accelerate molecular and mechanistic study of the latter to facilitate the development of cancer treatments. These novel water-soluble variants of membrane proteins may also themselves be adopted in therapeutic applications [45].\n\nClassification and visualization of protein-cancer types\n\nTo intuitively establish correlation between protein functions and cancer specificities, we encoded data entries with functional descriptions and visualize them in a 3D-space. The TF-IDF (frequency-inverse document frequency) machine-learning algorithm was adopted to extract keywords based on their relative frequency of appearances in each description compared to the whole database, to distinguish minor functional differences in proteins [46]. Words not directly related to protein functions like PubMed ID were manually removed. As the most important hyperparameter for TF-IDF, the number for max features (MF) was adjustable in the interface with cut-offs between 50 and 250 words and a step size of 50. This step allows users to choose either the most important or more inclusive descriptions of protein functions for tailored classifications, without making the data matrix non-efficiently large.\n\nA 1309 × MF matrix was then established to represent the protein × function information. The UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction) algorithm was adopted to reduce the dimension of encoded data while preserving its global structure and visualizing in a 3D-coordinate system (Fig. 1A). In this low-dimensional space, protein classifications were denoted by different colors, while halos around a single datapoint represented cancer types. The distant purple cluster at top-left corner represents entries currently without functional descriptions. The interactive graph is the front page of our database, where users can select a single datapoint to access the detailed information page. The interface also allows the selection and highlighting of each protein category, or those associated with one or several types of cancers (Fig. 1B–D). The feature provides information of membrane proteins or critical mechanistic processes adopted by different pathologies in each category.\n\nBeyond the apparent information that the same types of proteins exhibit relative clustering in the 3D-space, we hypothesize that the graph also reveals functional connections encoded by dimension reduction. It is likely that adjacently positioned proteins have higher chance to participate in functionally relevant pathways contributing to the same pathology, whether or not they exhibit concurrent profiling in the gene analysis. For instance, when “receptor” and “glioma” were selected, we found datapoint EPHA7 (Ephrin type-A receptor-7) not overexpressed in the gene-level, but was in close proximity of several receptors all associated with the cancer (Fig. 1E). Literature review indeed suggested its relation to malignant glioma despite genetic analysis labeling it as irrelevant [47]. Similarly, LPCAT1 is adjacent to five enzymes related to liver cancer. Its expression was found to enhance the phosphatidylcholine level in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, which promoted cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion [48]. On the other hand, CERS3 (Ceramide synthase 3) resides in a wide pocket of 9 proteins related to glioma, liver cancer, or both (Fig. 1G). Despite its normal transcription level in either pathology, a recent study found the enzyme to affect invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via SMAD6 gene [49], whereas it also regulates AKT/ERK1/2 signaling critical for angiogenesis of glioblastoma [50]. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1H, there are three other liver cancer-related transporters adjacent to SLC34A2 (Solute carrier family 34 member), while the knockdown of the latter was also found to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion [51]. The overall reliability of prediction efficacy will need more extensive evaluation based on data mining and preferably dedicated experimental validation. Yet the few examples presented here already showed the prospect of integrating functional information beyond genetic-level analysis into the clusters of proteins with correlation to pathologies.\n\nQTY design and property comparisons\n\nThe design of water-soluble variants likely provides mechanistic insights for native membrane proteins and accelerate therapeutic developments, as has been demonstrated before [36, 52]. Thus, we conducted QTY design on all 1309 cancer-related membrane proteins in the database. The L, I, V, F residues in the TM region of native proteins were replaced by Q, T and Y accordingly in the designs (with T replacing both I and V). The process was conducted using an automated online PSS server established prior [44].\n\nSince we cannot present all designed sequences in one paper, five proteins of different categories with varying numbers of TM helices are selected as exemplary demonstrations, including MGAT3 (Monoacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 3), GPR35 (G protein-coupled receptor 35), GPR37 (G protein-coupled receptor 37), SLC10A1 (Solute carrier family 10 member 1), and NPC1L1 (Hepatic Niemann-pick C1-like 1). MGAT3 is a 3TM enzyme commonly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract that catalyzes the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerol from 2-monoacylglycerol and has a role in dietary fat absorption [53]. It is relevant to colorectal cancer, liver cancer and stomach cancer. Both GPR35 and GPR37 belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family with 7TM helices. They regulate osteogenesis via the Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway [54], or bind prosaptide to enhance ERK signaling and inhibit cAMP levels [55]. GPR35 is related to colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and stomach cancer, while GPR37 is related to glioma, melanoma and liver cancer. SLC10A1 is a 8TM solute carrier co-transporter primarily localized in hepatocytes, and plays a key role in bile acid extraction and biliary excretion from portal blood [56]. The protein hosts hepatitis B virus infection and is associated with liver cancer [57]. NPC1L1 is a large 13TM polytopic sterol transporter localized at the apical membrane of enterocytes and the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes [58]. It serves as a critical mediator for cellular cholesterol uptake and is involved in liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and stomach cancer [59].\n\nSequence alignments of QTY designed water-soluble proteins and their native counterparts are shown in Fig. 2. Individual optimizations were not conducted for this mass-design process. QTY substitutions were applied to all corresponding residues only in the TM region, but not those in extracellular domains and intracellular domains.\n\nThe protein characteristics were calculated and compared in Table 1. Despite significant QTY substitutions on LIVF residues in TM regions (~ 48–54%), the isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (MW) of QTY proteins are quite similar to native proteins. This is due to that, although Q, T and Y can induce the formation of intra-, inter- and solvent-exposed hydrogen bonds, they do not carry additional charges. The substitutions enhance the protein solubility while retaining its overall integrity without introducing additional disruptive electrostatic interactions. The alteration of hydrophobicity in the helical region of membrane proteins without changes in steric and electrostatic interactions is the essence of QTY code. The slight MW increase is due to the introduction of hydroxyl group in respective residues.\n\nSuperimpositions of AlphaFold2 predicted structures of native and QTY cancer-related membrane proteins\n\nThe structural similarity between QTY designed MGAT3, GPR35, GPR37, SLC10A1, NPC1L1, and native counterparts were demonstrated by comparing AlphaFold2 predicted structures. The predicted structures were validated by ProSA web tool and reported as z-score values [60]. Lower z-scores correspond to higher model validity, where predicted structures of native and QTY variant generally exhibited closely matched z-score values (Additional file 1: Table S1). As shown in Fig. 3, predicted structures for native and QTY proteins superimposed very well. Both side views and top views of the superimpositions are shown. Despite > 48% changes in TM sequences, the RMSD (root mean square deviation) for two protein variants under investigation are < 1.5 Å, suggesting very high conformational similarities. Specifically, RMSDs for MGAT3 versus MGAT3QTY, GPR35 versus GPR35QTY, GPR37 versus GPR37QTY, SLC10A1 versus SLC10A1QTY, and NPC1L1 versus NPC1L1QTY are 0.157 Å, 1.478 Å, 1.216 Å, 1.233 Å, and 0.656 Å, respectively. TM region RMSDs for MGAT3 versus MGAT3QTY, GPR35 versus GPR35QTY, GPR37 versus GPR37QTY, SLC10A1 versus SLC10A1QTY, and NPC1L1 versus NPC1L1QTY are 0.309 Å, 1.044 Å, 0.899 Å, 0.544 Å, and 0.603 Å, respectively. Improvements on TM region RMSDs were attributed to the deletion of intrinsically flexible loop domains that contribute more to the RMSDs, which further demonstrated the applicability of QTY methodology on TM helices without structural alterations [61, 62].\n\nDespite that we cannot show superimpositions of all 1309 membrane proteins in this article, the RMSDs between native and QTY variants, along with MW and secondary structure changes were summarized and plotted in Fig. 3F. Most redesigned proteins exhibit RMSD values < 10 Å, with the densest distribution below 5 Å. The outliers are relatively darker in color, suggesting their higher MWs and more complex structures. Moreover, there are only a few designs falling outside the ± 45° sectors in the graph, while most datapoints reside close to the horizontal line. This suggests that most native and QTY variant proteins share similar secondary structures.\n\nHydrophobicity analysis of native and QTY cancer-related membrane proteins\n\nTo computationally evaluate the solubilization efficacy of cancer-related membrane proteins, we conducted bioinformatic simulations on surface hydrophobic patches of both native and QTY variant proteins. Due to the proteins being naturally embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, native proteins were surrounded by nonpolar residues at the exterior of TM helices, which represents the majority of water-repelling surfaces as colored yellow in Fig. 4A–E (top). After the QTY code was applied, the hydrophobic patches (bottom) have notably decreased compared to their native counterparts, indicating an enhanced capability for water molecule interactions in the QTY variants.\n\nA distribution map containing hydrophobicity information of all 1309 membrane proteins was shown in Fig. 4F. RH corresponds to the ratio of α-helical content in the protein, while HƳ represents calculated hydrophobicity using ProPAS. As expected, more significant decreases in hydrophobicity are observed for proteins with higher TM helical contents, which were the targets for the QTY design with amino acid substitutions. On the other hand, by comparing the color distribution of circles (native proteins) and diamonds (QTY proteins), slight increases of Tm (melting temperature) were predicted for solubilized proteins using a sequence-based method, indicating relatively higher protein stability [63]. Though accurate Tm values will require experimental determinations, the predicted trend agrees with previous experimental findings [36]. Since water-solubility and structural stability are interconnected characteristics, it is possible that by designing more soluble proteins, we also provide a plausible method for their stabilization, which has both theoretical and practical significances [64].\n\nMolecular docking of native and water-soluble cancer-related membrane proteins\n\nPreliminary functional comparison of native and water-soluble variants of cancer-related membrane proteins was conducted by docking their known ligands into predicted binding sites. The examination of computed binding geometries contributed to the understanding of molecular interactions from both conformational and compositional aspects [65]. We continued using the five exemplary proteins as in previous tasks. Both small molecule ligands and protein binders were checked. Specifically, we conducted molecular dockings for the following binding pairs: MGAT3 versus DAG (diacylglycerol), 2-MAG (2-monoacylglycerol) and oleoyl-CoA; GPR35 versus cGMP, kynurenic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, pamoic acid and Zaprinast; GPR37 versus neuroprotection D1, Osteocalcin and Saposin C; SLC10A1 versus bile acid, estrone sulfate, GCDC (glyco-chenodeoxycholic acid) and taurosholate; NPC1L1 versus cholesterol. Amongst the listed ligands, Osteocalcin and Saposin C are protein binders, whilst all others are small molecule ligands.\n\nThe binding pockets were predicted by PrankWeb for both native and QTY variant proteins [66]. Rational considerations were used to select a model from top 3 predictions. For MGAT3, GPR35 and SLC10A1, the highest scoring pockets were selected for subsequent docking. Yet for GPR37, the pocket 1 and 2 of native and pocket 1 of QTY protein were predicted at the C-terminus, thus pocket 3 for native protein and pocket 2 for QTY protein residing on the N-terminus were used for docking. NPC1L1 mediates cholesterol uptake by transporting it across the membrane, which involves the interaction of cholesterol with TM channels. While the 4 highest scoring pockets all resided in the extracellular region far from the phospholipid membrane and were most likely relevant to interaction with cholesterol, we intentionally selected pocket 3 for both native and QTY variants near the N-terminal entrance of the TM channel to elucidate the impact of the QTY design on the cross-lipid transportation. As shown in Fig. 5, predicted binding pockets generally agreed well between native and QTY variant proteins, providing basis for similar binding interactions.\n\nDockings between protein models and respective ligands were performed using AudoDock Vina [67]. Simulations for each protein–ligand pair were repeated at least three time to generate a reliable docking conformation and statistically meaningful binding energies. As shown in Fig. 6A–E, despite significant amino acid changes in TM regions, the binding between proteins and their respective ligands on the QTY variants generally occurred at closely-matching locations on the native protein. However, slight docking conformation differences were observed due to the inevitable changes to local environments, with some hydrogen bonds altered at new sites. These alterations can be attributed to interference from increased numbers of polar residues, which previously did not exist in the TM helices. Extensive internal hydrogen bond networks in QTY proteins may also lead to significant changes in ligand binding poses, as shown in MGAT3:2-MAG, MGAT3:oleoyl-CoA, and GPR35:pamoic acid. The orientations of the ligands were inverted, as previously outward-facing hydrophilic segments of the molecules were drawn by the polar core of QTY proteins, leaving hydrophobic segments to face solvents uncompensated. Such changes might not only impose additional energy penalties in docking, but also possibly negate the function associated with the binding events, such as the catalytic function in MGAT3. On the other hand, the channel forming proteins, namely SLC10A1 and NPC1L1, exhibited higher agreements both on the ligand docking poses and interaction sites between the native and QTY variants, with the best-performing pair being NPC1L1:cholesterol. Almost identical poses and identical hydrogen bond formations were observed. It was deduced that the presence of high aspect ratio TM channels was likely to guide the binding and orientation of respective ligands. The transporting function was also most likely retained despite significant changes in amino acid sequences.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the calculated binding energy (kcal/mol) for each protein–ligand pair extrapolated from AutoDock Vina. In general, QTY variant proteins showed slightly decreased binding energies as compared to their native counterparts, but were still close in numbers. The trends agreed well with our previous experimental results that QTY proteins generally exhibited very slightly lower binding affinities compared to native proteins [35, 36, 45]. It was also supported by docking pose observations, where both native and QTY variants bound to respective ligands in similar manners, despite the more complex internal hydrogen bond networks of the latter being slightly unfavorable towards intermolecular interactions. Amongst all, the GPR35:pamoic acid pair exhibited the largest binding energy discrepancy of 2.0 kcal/mol. An alternative route was conducted to evaluate this binding pair, where AlphaFold_multimer was employed to predict GPR35/Gα complex structure and established a model for subsequent docking (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) [68]. Almost identical docking positions and orientations were observed for the complex model (Additional file 1: Fig. S2) and those presented in Fig. 6B. Additional MD simulations on this binding pair will be presented in a later section. However, it should be noted that most of our docking computations did not consider the states of membrane proteins, complex with downstream biomolecules such as G-proteins, and potential small molecule induced conformational changes. This might render the simulated structures and calculated binding energies to have slight deviations when compared to the actual binding states of ligands, which should be determined in subsequent crystallographic studies.\n\nBeside small molecule ligands, protein binders also play critical roles in the function of membrane proteins [61, 62]. We here used ZDOCK software to inspect the interactions of GPR37 versus Osteocalcin and Saposin C. The TM and intracellular regions were blocked for binding based on rational considerations. As shown in Fig. 7, the docking poses for each binder are quite similar in the native proteins and the QTY variants. Additional hydrogen bonds were observed at the head of TM helices due to the increased availability of polar sites. Hydrophilic interactions between binders and extracellular loops of GPR37 may form or disappear depending on conformational changes induced by either the design or the docking. However, one noteworthy consideration is that the pLDTT value of loop regions for AlphaFold2 predicted structures are generally low, suggesting their intrinsically disordered and flexible nature with higher energy states [69]. Thus, it is plausible that these regions may deform to accommodate for stronger interactions during the binding events. We then recomputed the complexes of GPR37 against Saposin C and Osteocalcin using AlphaFold_multimer, removed the respective binding partners, and redocked them back to the extracellular regions of the receptor using ZDOCK. The models of native and QTY GPR37 against Saposin C still exhibited aberrant N-terminal loops with slightly different docking poses and hydrogen bond interactions (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A). Yet the models of native and QTY GPR37 against Osteocalcin showed closely-matching docking poses and hydrogen bond interactions (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). In general, similar molecular dockings between native and QTY proteins were observed in these simulations.\n\nMolecular docking analysis of GPR35 versus pamoic acid\n\nThe docking poses of GPR35 versus pamoic acid in native and QTY variant proteins were notably different, associated with the largest binding energy change amongst all computed pairs. To further explain this phenomenon, we carried out MD simulations on both complexes using GROMACS and Charmm36 force field [70, 71]. The simulations were conducted for 50 ns to allow the full stabilization of both binding partners in complexes (Additional file 1: Fig. S4).\n\nThe MMGBSA approximation was employed to calculate the binding free energies for stabilized complex structures [72]. As shown in Fig. 8A, the major energy terms that differed were ΔEele and ΔEvdw, representing the electrostatic interaction energy and the non-bonded van der Waals interaction energy, respectively. The decreased contributions from both terms in the QTY protein may be attributed to the inverted docking poses and more complex hydrogen bond network at the interface. These two factors combined led to a decreased binding energy between the two [36]."
