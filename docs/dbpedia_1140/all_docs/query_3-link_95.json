Purification The antibody was affinity-purified from rabbit antiserum by affinity-chromatography using epitope-specific immunogen Form Liquid in PBS containing 50% glycerol, 0.5% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide. Gene Name DPYSL2 Accession No. Q16555 O08553 P47942 Alternate Names DPYSL2; CRMP2; ULIP2; Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2; DRP-2; Collapsin response mediator protein 2; CRMP-2; N2A3; Unc-33-like phosphoprotein 2; ULIP-2 Description dihydropyrimidinase like 2(DPYSL2) Homo sapiens This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse, and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders, and hyperphosphorylation of the encoded protein may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
