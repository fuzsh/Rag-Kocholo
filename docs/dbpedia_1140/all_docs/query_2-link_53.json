        "text": "All transcripts of all genes have been analyzed regarding the location(s) of corresponding protein based on prediction methods for signal peptides and transmembrane regions.\n\nGenes with at least one transcript predicted to encode a secreted protein, according to prediction methods or to UniProt location data, have been further annotated and classified with the aim to determine if the corresponding protein(s) are secreted or actually retained in intracellular locations or membrane-attached.\n\nRemaining genes, with no transcript predicted to encode a secreted protein, will be assigned the prediction-based location(s).\n\nThe annotated location overrules the predicted location, so that a gene encoding a predicted secreted protein that has been annotated as intracellular will have intracellular as the final location.\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across tissues. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nThe regional specificity category is based on mRNA expression levels in the analysed brain samples, grouped into 13 main brain regions and calculated for the three different species. All brain expression profiles are based on data from HPA. The specificity categories include: regionally enriched, group enriched, regionally enhanced, low regional specificity and not detected. The classification rules are the same used for the tissue specificity category\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across tissues. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across single cell types. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across single cell types. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across cell lines. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nRNA specificity category based on RNA sequencing data from cancer cell lines in the Human Protein Atlas grouped according to type of cancer. Genes are classified into six different categories (enriched, group enriched, enhanced, low specificity and not detected) according to their RNA expression levels across the panel of cell lines.\n\nThe blood-based immunoassay category applies to actively secreted proteins and is based on plasma or serum protein concentrations established with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, compiled from a literature search. The categories include: detected and not detected, where detection refers to a concentration found in the literature search."
