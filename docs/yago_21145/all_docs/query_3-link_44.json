        "text": "Prince George of Denmark (2 April 1653-28 October 1708) was the consort of Queen Anne of Great Britain from 8 March 1702 until his death on 28 October 1708.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJørgen von Oldenburg was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1653, the younger son of King Frederick III of Denmark and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Luneburg. He received military training and toured France, England, Italy, and Germany as a young man. In 1674, King Louis XIV of France backed his bid for the kingship of Poland-Lithuania, but his devout Lutheranism led to him losing out to Jan Sobieski. He served under his brother Christian V of Denmark during the Scanian War before marrying the English princess Anne in 1683, a move engineered by King Louis XIV with the hope of fomenting an Anglo-Danish alliance against the United Provinces. He was disliked by his Dutch brother-in-law William III of Orange, as George served as a counterbalance against William's claim to the throne. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, however, William - now King of England - granted George the title of Duke of Cumberland. William excluded George from active military service, and neither he nor Anne wielded any great influence until the deaths of William and Mary II of England. George became his wife's consort, and, while he privately disagreed with her views, he used his influence in support of his wife. He had little interest in politics, and his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary. However, he used his influence in southern English parliamentary boroughs to support Whig candidates in 1705. His wife suffered twelve miscarriages, four infant deaths, and the loss of Prince William, Duke of Gloucester at the age of 11, and George died of a lung disease at Kensington Palace in 1708 at the age of 55."
