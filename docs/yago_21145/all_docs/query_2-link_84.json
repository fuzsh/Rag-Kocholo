        "text": "Born in Buckinghamshire on 4 July 1942, Prince Michael of Kent was the third child of Prince George, Duke of Kent (son of King George V and Queen Mary) and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark (daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia). His siblings are Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (married to the Duchess of Kent) and Princess Alexandra, the Hon. Lady Ogilvy.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Olivia Henson, the new Duchess of Westminster? Let Tatler reveal all\n\nOlivia Henson and Hugh Grosvenor, Duke of Westminster married at Chester Cathedral on Friday 7 June. The Marlborough alumna has snapped up one of the most eligible bachelors in the land, so who is the bride?\n\nAt the time of his birth, Prince Michael, now 82, was seventh in line to the throne. Through his father, Prince Michael was a first cousin of Princess Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth II. Through his mother, he was also a first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Michael of Kent is not a working royal – unlike his brother and sister – but did occasionally represent the late Queen at engagements.\n\nLike many members of the Royal Family, Prince Michael's list of godparents reads like a who's who of the world's most influential figures: King George VI, King Haakon VII of Norway and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt were among those chosen. Just weeks later, the family suffered a devastating blow when Prince Michael's father, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed in a plane crash near Dunbeath in Scotland.\n\nRead More\n\nWho are the Hensons? Meet Olivia Henson's aristocratic family, who have ties to banking empires and the social scene's most sought-after sisters\n\nTwo households, both alike in dignity, in fair Chester where we lay our scene …\n\nAged five, Prince Michael had a starring role as a page boy at the wedding of his cousin Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. Educated at Eton, Prince Michael proved something of a linguist, and in addition to being fluent in French he had a ‘working knowledge’ of German and Italian and became the first member of the Royal Family to learn Russian, of which he is a qualified interpreter. After Eton, he went to Sandhurst, before serving in the military for 20 years.\n\nPrince Michael of Kent was forced to give up his place in the line of succession (but was later reinstated) when he married German divorcée, Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz, a Catholic who is today known as the highly glamorous Princess Michael of Kent, a former interior designer. They were married at a civil ceremony in Vienna after receiving Pope John Paul II’s permission. Princess Michael, who has authored multiple books on European Royalty, is a great lover of Siamese and Burmese cats as well as cheetahs (she had a pet as a young girl, chronicled in her book A Cheetah's Tale).\n\nPrince Michael, now 52nd in line to the throne, also has notable ties to Russia. Tsar Nicholas II was a first cousin of three of his grandparents, George V, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. When the bodies of the Tsar and some of his family were recovered in 1991, the remains were later identified by DNA using, among others, a sample from Prince Michael for recognition. He attended the 1998 burial of the Tsar and his family in St Petersburg. He is an honorary member of the Romanov Family Association. In 2009, he was given the Order of Friendship at the Kremlin, a prestigious state decoration for his work on Anglo-Russian relations (one of only a handful of Britons to receive the mark). His personal website emphasises his ‘strong emotional attachment’ to Russia, which he first visited following the collapse of communism.\n\nRead More\n\nA radiant First Lady: Sir Keir Starmer is Britain's new Prime Minister and his wife Victoria is emerging from her north London cocoon into the global limelight. But who is she?\n\nWho is Lady Starmer? Tatler looks back to a profile published in the January 2023 issue\n\nPrince Michael of Kent represented the late Queen on a number of occasions, including the 150th anniversary of the Crimean War in Ukraine. Although he doesn’t appear in the Court Circular, the official record of royal engagements, the prince’s dedicated website says he tended to attend some 200 events-a-year prior to the pandemic.\n\nAll the men Princess Diana was ever romantically linked to\n\nRead More\n\nHe finances his lifestyle by acting as a consultant for business clients and his personal company, Cantium Services. Prince Michael does not receive any funding from the sovereign grant but his police protection in the UK and abroad has been paid for from the public purse. He is also occasionally given British embassy accommodation during his trips to Russia, according to the Sunday Times. Prince and Princess Michael’s living arrangements came under scrutiny in 2002 when a panel of MPs investigated the cost of royal palaces and whether they presented value for money."
