        "text": "The Queen Mother actually knew Paul through her brother Michael. Prince Paul and Michael Bowes Lyon shared a flat together with a Lord Gage in London. From the book I have been reading, I am not sure if Michael and Paul (who attended Oxford but this was interrupted by the war) met in college or later. The Queen Mother, as Duchess of York, did attend Paul's wedding with the Duke of York. It is clear, however, that she was friendly with Paul before her marriage to Prince Albert and many thought that Paul was interested in possibly marrying her.\n\nCan you provide a source for that...in all the books that I have read on the BRF...I have never heard the suggestion Elizabeth would marry Paul. Many thanks\n\nMy dear Zonk,\n\nOf course. I read about this in The Queen Mother by Shawcross, p. 116. He also cites to the Grania Forbes biography of the young Elizabeth Bowes Lyon, My Darling Buffy. There was no indication that Queen Elizabeth considered marrying Paul but the implication is that he was one of many men who were keen on her.\n\nThe Queen Mother actually knew Paul through her brother Michael. Prince Paul and Michael Bowes Lyon shared a flat together with a Lord Gage in London. From the book I have been reading, I am not sure if Michael and Paul (who attended Oxford but this was interrupted by the war) met in college or later. The Queen Mother, as Duchess of York, did attend Paul's wedding with the Duke of York. It is clear, however, that she was friendly with Paul before her marriage to Prince Albert and many thought that Paul was interested in possibly marrying her.\n\nThanks for all the info you mentioned I was right, I have read it many times in books and other forums as well. No Zonk the QM didn't go or graduate from college, I never said she did but I remembered that their first meeting, with Prince Paul I mean, was somehow connected to a college. And may I add, it is common knowledge that from then on the 2 royal couples, Olga & Paul and TQM & Bertie shared an everlasting friendship. Maybe I should have said re Marina & TQM that they weren't in the best terms at the early stage of their relationship, when they were both young brides of the BRF and sisters-in-law. At least at the early stage, I should have clarified that I'm sorry! Addition: I read my post again,, I had written that TQM & Paul were classmates in college..oops, I got it all wrong and also confused you, Zonk! Now I'm really really sorry\n\nPrincess Marina was rather pretty, not like Irina (who I confused her for). She seems to have been more glamourous than beautiful, yet still was by no means ugly. I wonder how her son ended up looking like Tsar Nicholas, I know she is descended from the Romanovs, but it just seems so random for one of her sons to end up looking like Nicholas when I believe they are second or third cousins.\n\nAs for her wedding dress, good gawd that is beautiful! Where is that dress, it definitely needs to be on display."
