        "text": "He was only 3 years older than her actual husband, Prince George of Denmark, and he had several children survive to adulthood. This also would have probably kept Sarah Churchill (his wife IOTL) away from Queen Anne, and their relationship, while initially close, ended in acrimony.\n\nIt's not a huge stretch, Anne marrying him. She was the daughter of a royal and a commoner (her mother's father received noble titles only after his daughter got involved with the future King James VII & II), and the Duke of Marlborough's sister had several illegitimate children with King James.\n\nIf Anne and Marlborough have a surviving child, then there is no need for the Hanoverians, and Marlborough being a British nobleman instead of a foreign royal probably means less British involvement on the continent.\n\nDo you think the House would be the House of Churchill or the House of Marlborough? Do you think that having two generations of monarchs marrying Brits instead of foreign royalty would establish a new tradition, where the British royals marry British nobility instead of continental royalty?\n\nCould you see Anne and Marlborough's children married off to other Stuart descendants, such as maybe a Monmouth descendant?"
