        "text": "A rare, three quarter length portrait of Prince George of Denmark (1653-1708), consort of Queen Anne. He wears a long fair periwig, armour, brocade sash, Garter and carries a baton. His plumed helmet rests on a rock and his spaniel is at his side. In the background rages a battle. He married Princess Anne in 1683, and was rewarded for his desertion of her father James II at Andover in 1688, by the Dukedom of Cumberland on the accession of Anne’s sister Mary and her husband the Prince of Orange. On his wife’s succession he was refused the title of King but instead given the honorary titles of Captain General of the Army and Lord High Admiral."
