        "text": "Knowledge Exchange Fellow Dr Julie Farguson is speaking at a lecture on 'Prince George of Denmark (1653–1708): The Forgotten Consort'.\n\nYounger son of Frederik III of Denmark, and consort to Queen Anne (r. 1702–1714), history has not treated Prince George of Denmark kindly or fairly. Charles II is reputed to have said of him ‘I have tried him drunk and I have tried him sober and there is nothing to him’, and even today George is often characterised by historians as little more than an ‘amiable but bone-headed gentleman’. Yet Prince George was admired and respected in his own lifetime and was loyal to his wife, emotionally and politically. This lecture will debunk the myths about Prince George to reveal that from his marriage in 1683, when he came to live in England, until his untimely death in 1708, he played an important role in his adopted country.\n\nPrice: £8 | £6 concessions and members\n\nContact name: Julie Farguson\n\nContact email: julie.farguson@wolfson.ox.ac.uk\n\nWebsite: Royal Museums Greenwich\n\nAudience: Open to all"
