She would be the last of the Stuart monarchs, as the second daughter of King James II who had been overthrown by William III. Anne was the Queen of England and Ireland from 1702 to 1714 and in 1707 united Scotland and England together once again creating Great Britain.\n\nAnne’s elder sister Mary had ruled alongside her husband William III of England in a joint monarchy, but Anne had aimed to rule independently. This was short-lived as Anne suffered from ill health and had to rely on the support of her ministers to rule. England faced conflict with France and Spain during her rule, so her ministers dictated much of England’s foreign policy to deal with these external threats.\n\nEngland also faced political internal threats as the Tories and Whigs, which only increased with the uncertainty of who would succeed Anne on the throne, due to her ill-health it was uncertain if she would produce an heir.\n\nAnne had married Prince George of Denmark (1653–1708) in 1683, and despite her father being Catholic, she had been raised Protestant and continued this allegiance during her reign. But to secure her reign and the stable continuation of Protestant rule in England it was essential that she conceived a healthy heir. It is believed that Anne was pregnant at least 18 times, but gave birth to only five living children. Only one of her children survived infancy, a son named William. William died at the age of 11 from suspected pneumonia and died in 1700.\n\nTherefore, the issue of Anne’s succession became an internal political problem once again. Anne would die without a child for an heir and so the Stuart line died and George I of Hanover was declared her heir to ensure England remained under Protestant leadership."
