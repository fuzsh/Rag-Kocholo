        "text": "Queen Anne lost 19 children and endured 17 pregnancies, plus one hysterical pregnancy, all within 16 years. Only five of those pregnancies would result in living children, but tragically, two of those five died on the same day that they were born; George, who died just minutes after birth, but was christened, and Mary, who lived for only a few short hours. Of the other three, Anne Sophia was a healthy child, and might have lived if not for contracting smallpox, which took her life. Their other daughter, Mary, caught smallpox at the same time as her sister, and it ultimately killed her as well, but she had always been a sickly child, unlike Anne Sophia. Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, lived the longest of all their children, reaching the age of 11. Prince William had suffered from hydrocephalus and was a sickly child as well, though a very intelligent and witty one, and when he reached the age of 10 there were hopes that he would survive the perils of childhood. Sadly, those hopes were dashed and he died just days after his 11th birthday from a “malignant fever.”\n\nOf the children Anne miscarried, or who were stillborn, Anne had done everything she and her doctors could think of to keep her babies safe and carry them to term. She rested, took trips to Bath, followed her physicians orders, but to no avail. Anne blamed a carriage jolt, or possibly a dance she participated in that involved jumping, for the loss of one of her pregnancies. Another two were lost when Anne was gravely sick. One was lost after a gout flare up. While pregnant with another, she felt slightly indisposed, for which the doctors bled her, and then shortly later she lost that baby too. She lost two sons, of different ages, not too many days after a fall. One of her last had been dead inside her for 8-10 days, and only then did she feel ill, although she had earlier told the doctors that she had felt the child stop kicking. And her final child had been dead in her a month, but nothing seemed amiss with her health, even on the day she went into labor with him. The other losses had no causes, and the children who died on the same day that they were born had come too early.\n\nMany explanations have been put forward as to why Queen Anne lost so many children. One of the more popular theories is that she suffered from rhesus incompatibility. Rhesus incompatibility is when a rhesus negative mother conceives a rhesus positive child, and as a result her antibodies fatally attack the child. However, this is only the case with pregnancies after the first, and as Anne suffered a miscarriage on her first pregnancy, the theory is not air tight. Another theory is that she had placental insufficiency. And if, as a theory about her health states, she had Hughes Syndrome, which itself is associated with Lupus, another illness today’s doctors believe Anne had, placental insufficiency is very common as the sticky blood cannot pass through the placenta and give the fetus the nutrients it needs. Pelvic inflammatory disease has also been suggested as the culprit, but so have a large number of other medical conditions. Whatever the cause, after the loss of her last pregnancy in 1700, only a few months before the death of her only living child, Anne never became pregnant again despite trying and being only 35 years old.\n\nRead more about Anne and George’s son, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, here.\n\nThere are unfortunately no portraits of Mary or Anne Sophia, but the detail of the portrait with the two small girls is from the 17th century, by the artist Jan Mijtens."
