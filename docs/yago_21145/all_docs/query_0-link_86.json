        "text": "She was the only female heir apparent to the English or British throne in history, which was unusual because succession depended on male-preference primogeniture, so female heirs were usually the heir presumptive. After Anne's father, King James II, was deposed in 1688, the throne passed to Anne's older sister Mary II and brother-in-law William III, who reigned as co-monarchs -- Mary had the stronger claim as the older daughter of the former monarch, while her husband was also her first cousin and next in line himself after Mary and Anne, and Mary insisted on reigning with him. Mary predeceased William, who was allowed to continue reigning alone. Anne was the only eligible living child of the James II (Anne's half-brother James was barred as a Catholic), and had a stronger claim than William or any children he might father, so the throne passed to her on his death."
