The U2 line starts at the Pankow urban rail (S-Bahn) station, runs through the eastern city centre (Alexanderplatz) to Potsdamer Platz, the western city centre (Wittenbergplatz, Zoologischer Garten) and finally to the Ruhleben terminal station.\n\nThe U2 has 29 stations and a length of 20.7 kilometers (12.9 miles). Together with the U1, U3, and U4 lines, it was part of the early Berlin metro network built before 1914. The route between Potsdamer Platz and Zoologischer Garten was the western section of the Stammstrecke, Berlin's first metro inaugurated in 1902.\n\nRoute[]\n\nThe metro line starts in West Berlin at the Ruhleben station and runs on a causeway between Rominter Allee and the main railway track to Spandau (also called the \"Olympia line\" or \"Grunewald line\"), until it enters a tunnel just before the curve to Olympische Straße and follows said road. Subsequently, the U2 turns towards Reichsstraße and Theodor-Heuss-Platz, where it extends to the Kaiserdamm boulevard in a curve. Under the Kaiserdamm, which later becomes the Bismarckstraße, the subway runs straight towards Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here again, it swings to the southeast in the course of Hardenbergstraße in the direction of the Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway staion. In the tunnel, it runs around the basement of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in a narrow arch and then follows the Tauentzienstraße, where it eventually, after passing the Wittenbergplatz square east of the intersection Kleist-/Courbierestraße, enters the elevated railway by a ramp. The elevated track reaches its full height at the Nollendorfplatz station. Underground there are four more subway tracks. All four lines of the small profile network meet at the Nollendorfplatz square. The elevated track continues in an easterly direction following the Bülowstraße. Thereafter, the U2 makes a long turn across a viaduct passing the southernmost point of the route, the Gleisdreick station and then runs straight across the Landwehr Canal and becomes an underground track again between the stations Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park and Potsdamer Platz. This track does not follow the Leipziger Straße as desired by the former Hochbahngesellschaft subway company, but winds through Mohrenstraße, Markgrafenstraße and the Niederwallstraße to the bank of the Spree river on the Spittelmarkt square. After passing the station Märkisches Museum, the U2 passes under the Spree river in a long tunnel, and runs towards the Alexanderplatz railway station and through the Klosterstraße road. After that station, the U2 makes a turn towards Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße. This road is followed by Schönhauser Allee which runs north-south in a relatively straight course. One road south of Eberswalder Straße, the underground line is again converted into a viaduct, and along the Schönhauser Allee there follow two elevated railway stations. Beyond the previous city limits, the Schönhauser Allee becomes Berliner Straße where the elevated rail line passes again into a tunnelled track and reaches the terminal station Pankow.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe original route of the Underground[]\n\nThe increasing traffic problems in the metropolis Berlin has led the late 19th century to the search for new efficient transportation. In particular, the operations Werner von Siemens sought the permission to build a new subway system. Siemens and other interested parties made numerous proposals, both the proposed route (large economic interest was at the prestigious Friedrichstraße and to the main shopping street Leipziger Straße) and the technical systems turned out quite different. There were ideas for monorail, a cable car as it has been built later in Wuppertal, a deep tube railway in London or an elevated railway on the American model. Finally, after many years, and negotiations continued from Siemens with a elevated highway by Warschauer Brucke on Hallesches Tor and Bülowstraße by. This was only possible because these areas were regarded as so-called \"slum\" because it feared pollution and noise. A building by the \"richer\" Leipziger Straße wanted to prevent the city of Berlin in any case. The private company Siemens & Halske introduced as the owner of all construction works. The groundbreaking ceremony was on 10 September 1896 Gitschiner in the street. The construction work had to be quick, because the closed the concession contract with Berlin stated that the route to be completed within two years had, or would a fine of 50,000 Goldmark threaten.\n\nBerlin-Charlottenburg decided in the Tauentzienstraße not elevated, but a underground railway to build, and the route to the \"knee\" (today's lead to Ernst-Reuter-Platz). Thus, the default, the route by 1 complete January 1900 are not met. The straight, replaced top management of Berlin's city construction office looked at the issue of U-Bahn with significantly greater benevolence. Since the subway apparently did no damage to the then-new sewer system, should an underground diversion created by Potsdamer Platz. In order that a further extension to the former Berlin city center was at any time. The state approval for design changes was published in a supplement on November 1, 1900 elevated railway company to the. The overall project of building and subway now had a length of 10.1 km. Most of the route, about eight kilometers, should be set up and connect eleven highly stations to viaduct. There were also two kilometers of tunnels with three subway stations. The former planners believed that no 8-car trains would be needed and could build the platforms, 80 feet in length. This was just enough for a 6-car train. In the first year after the turn of the century 6 km were completed route. After about 5 ½-year construction period, themain linewas finished. On February 15, 1902 was the so-called \"Ministerfahrt\" on the line Potsdamer Platz - Zoologischer Garten - instead of Potsdamer Platz - Stralauer Tor. This was so called because many Berliners took part in the opening drive, including the Prussian Minister of Public Works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 was the first section of the Berlin U-Bahn officially opened (Stralauer Tor - Potsdamer Platz). Back in March, the so-called \"Western trunk line\" by Zoological Garden opened, already on 14 December and then Knee could be extended. On 17 August was also the route from Stralauer Tor by 380 m to the Warsaw bridge extended. There were then only two lines:\n\nWarschauer Brucke - Branch Potsdamer Platz - Zoo\n\nWarschauer Brucke - directly without feeder - Zoo\n\nToday, most of the core section of the U1 (Warschauer Straße - Möckernbrücke), the section Gleisdreieck - Zoo is still used by U2.\n\nThe Charlottenburg U-Bahn[]\n\nAfter the opening of the main line were further plans for extension of the three branches to the line Knee by Potsdamer Platz and the Warschauer Brucke. The fastest way to negotiate with the young and upcoming city were Charlottenburg completed because there was a lot of vacant land that could be developed. The most important negotiating point was the construction of a route to the Rathaus Charlottenburg on U-Bahnhof Wilhelmplatz (now Richard-Wagner-Platz). Here, the extension would have provided directly by the Otto-Suhr-Allee, but went there at the time the Berlin-Charlottenburg tram and a parallel road was not considered appropriate. Therefore this route in the Bismarckstraße towards west and then run in a bow to the town hall. at that time the stations were planned Bismarckstraße (now Deutsche Oper had the working title Krumme Straße), which was prepared, and the terminus Wilhelmsplatz. The opening of the line between Knee and Wilhelmplatz took place on 14 May 1906 instead. Both subway lines are now leading to Bismarckstraße, but only the trains that the branch to the navigated Potsdamer Platz went, even to the Place Guillaume II.\n\nEven as this route was under construction, agreed the elevated railway company and the city of Charlottenburg on a turn towards Westend. Therefore learned of the planned station Bismarckstraße a schedule change, because this would divert the route to the West End. So here came the first four-track subway station in Germany. The two inner tracks should lead to the Wilhelmplatz, the outer to the Westend. Although the one-stop route to the Charlottenburg town hall was originally planned as the main route, it was now the route to the Westend.\n\nSince the western Charlottenburg area was still completely undeveloped, could provide the route in their early years are not yet profitable. Therefore, the elevated railway company is now negotiating with the city of Charlottenburg and the other property owners to compensate the deficit range. This contract was signed on 23 Completed in June 1906. For the distance to the west, the following stations will be built:\n\nBismarckstraße (now German Opera),\n\nSophie-Charlotte-Platz\n\nKaiserdamm\n\nReichskanzlerplatz (Today Theodor-Heuss-Platz, interim endpoint).\n\nOn 16 March 1908 sailed Emperor Wilhelm II, in accordance with the \"Ministerial travel\", the first time this distance. Officially, the line on 29 Inaugurated in March 1908. The two existing lines, but went no further than Reichskanzlerplatz, but a third line was opened, only the wrong road between Bismarck and Chancellor Place. Due to the significantly expanded range length and a new workshop was needed, for the current workshop in Rudolfstraße (or Warsaw Bridge) was not enough anymore. Therefore looking for a suitable site. As the Prussian Forest Service a part of the Grunewald s profitable market, wanted to meet the interests of both partners. Just bought the elevated railway company 14 hectare country, to build its new maintenance workshop. At the same time committing itself to a line extension with the station Olympiastadion to build. For this was the elevated railway company a grant from the Forestry Commission of 200,000 marks. But this should only take place operating and occasional services, a regular service was not provided. Simultaneously with the extension they built the station Neu-Westend as a shell with, for a traffic demand did not exist back then. On 3 November 1913 was the section with the Stadion (now Olympiastadion) and the station located in the shell Neu-Westend opened. The corresponding operating workshop Grunewald was completed in January 1913.\n\nThe \"center line\"[]\n\nAfter the so-called \"main line\" had been extended to the William Square, planned the elevated railway company, to also bind the city center of Berlin to the new subway. The city of Berlin, but said this only because it was given the success of the first track their own plans for the construction of subways. However, the highest decision-makers, the Berlin police chief intervened and agreed to the plans.\n\nThe elevated railway company was planning the new track a straight line under the Leipziger Straße result from Potsdamer Platz to Checkpoint Charlie. The \"Great Berlin tram, whose route through this street was prevented by the threat of damages, together with the city of Berlin, the realization of these plans.\n\nThe negotiators finally agreed on the long-term route to the Spittelmarkt, Alexanderplatz and Schönhauser Allee to the North Station Square. The plans have seen first the stations Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstraße), Stadtmitte (now the Stadtmitte), Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt before. Later, the line on the following stations continue to run: Inselbrucke (now Märkisches Museum), Klosterstraße, Alexanderplatz, Schönhauser Tor (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz ), Senefelderplatz, Danzigerstraße (Today as Eberswalder Straße station) and Nordring (Today as a high Schönhauser Allee railway station). Since the stretch Spittelmarkt by the required passing under the Spree should be very complicated and expensive, saw the plans as compensation a (cheaper) elevated highway in the Schönhauser Allee. Construction began on 15 December 1905. To allow the continuing, was then demolished with side platforms provided station Potsdamer Platz. On 28 September 1907 the 200 m away new station was opened Leipziger Platz (Today as a Potsdamer Platz station). Behind the Spittelmarkt was established in 1908, a station of the same name. This is right on the Spree, so that the surface is very muddy is. To keep the station plummeted, a piling was necessary. Go to the Spree, a window gallery was built. This was in the Second World War closed and only reopened in 2004. On 1 October 1908 was the \"Spittelmarktlinie\" officially opened. There were now four different lines, two of them used the new line:\n\nWarschauer Straße - Potsdamer Platz - Spittelmarkt, and\n\nWilhelmplatz (Mitte) - Wittenbergplatz - Potsdamer Platz - Spittelmarkt.\n\nSchönhauser Allee gets an elevated railway[]\n\nIn March 1910, work began on the extension of the \"Spittelmarktlinie\" (now \"center line\") to the north. Again, there were some challenges. Behind the Spittelmarkt the route runs on the banks of the Spree along. Therefore had to be a gap be built to cross under the river bed. There, in about 6.5 m depth of Station Island Bridge (now Märkisches Museum). Since the station was so low was a rare bow in Berlin station to be built. An impressively high barrel vault covered the platform, he is next to Square Airlift the only column-free underground station in Berlin. Behind the station crossed the line under the Spree and waved to the Klosterstraße, a station with the same name. Since that time there were plans to build a branch line under the Frankfurter Allee, was left in the middle of the platform space for another track. Today, a similar route out of Alexanderplatz from the Frankfurter Allee. From the monastery road we went to Alexanderplatz. The construction of this station was taken to ensure that later could be inserted stairs to other lines. The opening of the center line between Spittelmarkt and Alexanderplatz was held on 1 July 1913 instead. The line between Alexanderplatz and Wilhelmplatz has quickly become the most used line. In the course of this route led to Schönhauser Allee. There was with the station Schönhauser Tor (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz), the first station below the present Torstraße. Since the Schönhauser Allee wide enough, there were no problems with the tunnel. This was followed by the station Senefelderplatz. Behind this rises a ramp out of the tunnel and out at that station Danziger Strasse (now Eberswalder Straße). This was, as mentioned, run as elevated, because the tunnel Spittelmarkt were very expensive and on the wide Schönhauser Allee was the construction of the elevated train to achieve very favorable. After the station was Danziger Straße elevated train at that station north ring viaduct (now Schönhauser Allee). There, the already existing Berliner Ringbahn has been crossed, but not underground, but to an even higher level. Today's S-Bahn runs there in the cut. Thus, the then end of the line was reached. The extension from Alexanderplatz to the North Ring already 3 ½ weeks after the opening of the line to Alexanderplatz, 27 July 1913 opened.\n\nThe new Gleisdreick[]\n\nOne of the most dangerous parts of the entire subway system was the Gleisdreick, which combined the main route between Warschauer Brucke, Zoo and the branch line to the Potsdamer Platz. This diversion was secured only by signals, so that an inattentive driver could cause a catastrophe. On 26 September 1908 was such a disaster. A high-tension driving another train in the flank and pushed two cars off the track. One of the cars fell from the viaduct here. 21 passengers were killed. Then a reconstruction of the track triangle was ordered. In May 1912, construction began. Instead of a track triangle now a cross-shaped plant was planned with a new railway hub. Only for internal purposes, there is a connection track between the two routes. The conversion was always in full operation, with different lines were set for a short time. On 3 November 1912, the station opened Gleisdreieck, the construction was not until August 1913.\n\nTwo new end stations[]\n\nIn the years of the Weimar Republic, the small profile network has been expanded only slightly. So it was since May 22, 1922 regular train services to Olympiastadion and the already built in the shell station Neu-Westend finally got his determination to pass.\n\nThe new station track triangle to a complete cross was completed, the \"relief route\" of track triangle above Kurfürstenstraße by Nollendorfplatz was on 24 Opened in October 1926. The economically enriched U-Bahnhof Kurfürstendamm street reflects the difficult financial situation of that time. In connection with the construction of the relief route should also underground station Nollendorfplatz be completely rebuilt and redesigned, as the subway system in the former city of Schöneberg (now U4) was still operated independently, although since 1920 as property of the City of Berlin belonged. The so-called \"main line\" of Northern ring the stadium should be extended in both directions at one station. To the north in 1930 was the station Pankow (now Vinetastraße). For its establishment, there was mainly one reason: The trains at the station drove north ring so often that a Zugwende on the viaduct was not possible. It was much easier to sweep the trains underground. A further planned extension to the width of road in Pankow Pankow was reached not only in 1997 was continued to be built here and by S-Bahn Berlin. At the opposite end of the line was already on 22 December 1929 at a station for the new terminus Ruhleben extended. The route ran on an embankment, the continuation of garden and industrial land to the nearby Spandau should start a little later. Depression and World War II were the plans but never become a reality, the extension of 1929 is still the last one on the west end of U2.\n\nNational Socialism and World War[]\n\nAfter the takeover of the Nazi, two stations of line AI for \"heroes\" of the Nazi movement was named. The Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz) received on 24 April 1933 the name of the new office holder: Adolf-Hitler-Platz. The station Schönhauser Tor (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) was established on 1 May 1934 after SA Lieutenant Horst Wessel, named the place in 1930 in a dispute death. According to the plans to transform Berlin into a \"World Capital Germania\" in 1939 should, however, alter the route of the former line A in comparison to other plans this time, relatively little. In addition to the planned many years Northern Extension to the train station Pankow, in the plans as Pankow (Breite Straße) means, should the elevated railway to be dismantled at the triangular junction and by a new, underground and straightforward guide to the station Bülowstraße should be replaced. were not incorporated in the previous and future plans occurring in proposals for an extension for Spandau. Should serve above all for the time lines proposed FI and FIII. First tunnel work began even at today's Theodor-Heuss-Platz, but were set in 1941 again. After the prophesied \"victory\" should be resumed. After 1 September 1939 war had begun, was the statement that all forms of transport can only take still darkened headlamps. This affected not only the vehicles but also the stages of S-and U-Bahn - here only dim light was burning. From the fall of 1943, the bombing of Berlin took on particularly strong, often had air raid warnings are triggered. Is important to remember that remain closed according to regulations at that time the underground stations should. This was rarely the case: often large crowds flocked to the stations in the mistaken belief that they were protected there from attacks. Thus, as the entrance to the station Senefelderplatz on the night of 3rd and 4th November buried by a bomb. In the following months took the air raids and bomb damage continues to grow. Only with difficulty could the BVG maintain operation. Particularly affected were the stations Gleisdreieck, Nollendorfplatz, Bülowstraße, Reichssportfield (now the Olympiastadion), Potsdamer Platz and Klosterstraße. In 1945 the situation was heating to continue, only partially went underground, mostly as shuttles between some stations. Finally, the operation came on 25 April 1945 to a complete standstill. On 2 May 1945, the North-South Tunnel is the train blown up in the Landwehr canal, which not only lead to flooding of the S-Bahn tunnel had the effect, but also meant that the water in through the passages underground rail system flowed. The line between the stations was AI Alexanderplatz and Potsdamer Platz completely under water and it took until the damage was removed.\n\nNew beginning after the war[]\n\nAfter the end of hostilities began the repair of the U-Bahn network. On 14 May 1945 the first trains were already running back (in the area around Hermannplatz). were on the section of the line AI 17 May First shuttles between the knee and Kaiserdamm and Kaiserdamm Ruhleben drive. The to Nazi Stations renamed Reichskanzlerplatz and Schönhauser Tor were given back their original name. In the following months, further sections go into operation on 18 September, the trains ran on the AI-sections Pankow - Potsdamer Platz and Gleisdreieck - Ruhleben already in circulation operation between the stations at Potsdamer Platz square and triangular junction was driven still in double mode. The station Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstraße) on 18 August 1950, in addition to Ernst Thalmann's death, brought back into operation and was renamed Thälmannplatz. In addition, he received an unusual design with marble from the Thuringian mountains, and the opening ceremony together with those of Thalmann's daughter, Irma Thalmann. Thus, the AI-line was again completely operational.\n\nThe division of the city and the 17th June 1953[]\n\nThe beginning of the Cold War escalation and the first major, the Berlin Airlift (1948/1949) replaced in the Berlin of great uncertainty. Many West Berlin, he avoided the East of the city. Thus, formed new traffic flows, drove around the eastern sector. The Berlin public transport, the operator of the U-Bahn, split in 1949 into an Eastern and a Western company. While bus and Tram Lines now transmitted to the border, it stayed on the subway with through traffic. Early 1953, the BVG-West on the last stations in the western sectors speaker who warned against crossing the Soviet sector. At these stations inverse plant's were established in order to let the trains if necessary there. They also designed the schedule so that at the same time did a U-Bahn to the east and another train came back again. Thus, the incidents in the West only a few vehicles would lose to the east. This proved to be in June of that year when East Berlin workers' protests with the increase of the Work Out responded. On 17 June 1953 was a general strike around the East planned, the information spread like wildfire across the country. About 20,000 striking workers protested not only against the standard increases, but also against the general conditions in the country. The BVG-Ost and the Deutsche Bahn presented to about 11 clock operation of the subway or a Berlin S-Bahn. The West Trains now ended in the prepared return investments. Overall, the West Berlin BVG lost due to the sophisticated timetable only 18 moves. The West-BVG also laid the northern section of the D line to the stations Voltastraße and Gesundbrunnen still, as it had no connection to the rest of Western power. A few days after the bloody suppression of the uprising, returned to normal traffic conditions. As a consequence of the experiences of the 17th June advised the West a new route, from the eastern sector of independent lines of the AII by Krumme Lanke a to Kottbusser Tor. In addition, the Schöneberg U-Bahn now just drove by Nollendorfplatz is not like before, and Warschauer Brucke.\n\nThe Wall[]\n\nThe isolation of the sector boundary between the two parts of Berlin by the Berlin Wall had for the A line that crossed the entire city from east to west, and also the division lead. On the orders of the then East Interior Minister Karl Maron is the train line A on East Berlin territory ended at the station now Thälmannplatz.\n\nThe lines C (now U6) and D (U8) were left to the West BVG, but closed their stations located in the eastern sector. was at the railway stations and downtown Alexanderplatz now from the line A (east) are not switched to the lines C and D. The BVG-West had her features but not as planned by Maron, Potsdamer Platz end, but already one stop earlier, at Gleisdreick. There had been concerned at the beginning of the 1950s, already installed as a precautionary measure, turning tracks. That used the BVG-Ost train station Potsdamer Platz as a turn system and occasionally even put on trains from West Berlin territory. This decision also the last common transport was separated in Berlin, as the tram and coach went not been since 1953 on the sector border. The S-Bahn went under the direction of the controlled from the GDR German Railway and could therefore not count as a common means of transport. The consequence of the 13 August 1961, was that in West Berlin, East Berlin S-Bahn increasingly boycotted was. It often chanted the slogans: \"The train driver is charged the barbed wire\" or \"Not a penny more for Ulbricht\". Thus, the West Berliners went by subway, bus, and - if still available - with the Tram.\n\nLine A in East Berlin[]\n\nThe cleavage of the U-Bahn network, only two lines remained under the auspices of the East-transport: the complete line E, Alexanderplatz for Friedrichsfelde, which was opened in 1930 and the working class districts in the eastern districts opened up, and the eastern part of the line A, in principle, the 1908-1913 route opened by the city and the Schönhauser Allee. The two lines crossed in the center of East Berlin, Alexanderplatz, where connection to the subway was. The other two lines in the Mitte As in the previous chapter described the West-BVG left to the closed railway stations in the eastern sector and bricked ( ghost stations). The subway was playing in the transport system in East Berlin a less important role than in West Berlin, the focus was more on the very long S-Bahn and tram networks. Within 58 years (1930-1987) was in the eastern part of the city built only one new underground station, while created with S and a number of new tram routes. use Temporary current plans, the line C (U6) on East Berlin territory itself and the A line in the area of the station center in the tunnel along the Friedrichstraße to extend, were not in action implemented. The Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstraße) was named after a war-damaged luxury hotel. This was on Wilhelmplatz, a famous square in the Wilhemplatz and Mohrenstraße in the heart of the government district. Despite the importance of the place was the new Metro station not be named after him because a few years ago on Wilhelmplatz (now Richard-Wagner-Platz) in Charlottenburg already an underground station went into operation this name wore. After the war, the square was renamed Thälmannplatz, and now the station could get the name of the place. Since, by uprising in 1953, the East German government mainly in the old government quarter Wilhelmstrasse sat the station should be made more representative. The station was redesigned and is due to its 1950s-style design of the Socialist Classicism unique in Berlin. The stations Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz, Spittelmarkt, Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz and Senefelderplatz have been redesigned in the 1960s and received new wall tiles. The stations Märkisches Museum and Klosterstraße became the rebuilt History of Berlin in 1987-consuming and were instead the socialist economic system in an unused advertising space artistic representations of urban development or historic buses and trains. The train station Alexanderplatz was little changed and is still almost in its original condition as of 32 years abandoned train station at Potsdamer Platz.\n\nThe new station Bismarckstraße[]\n\nBecause the S-Bahn-boycott and closure of the tram was massively expanded in West Berlin U-Bahn. This was however only the more modern wide gauge network(the current line U5 to U9). The building measures in the small profile network limited to the construction of new transfer stations to subway lines. In the area of today's U2 this happened in 1978 in Charlottenburg, between the existing stations Deutsche Oper and Sophie-Charlotte-Platz. In the course of the construction of Route 7, a tangent line that connects outside parts of the town several district centers to each other, several existing lines were crossed. These included the lines 4, 2 (U3 today), 3 (now U1) and 1 (now U2). The intersection of the latter was in the Bismarckstraße/Wilmersdorferstraße, 380 meters west of the station German opera. Despite the small distance to this station a new interchange station was built to create the necessary interchange. At the beginning of construction work initially on 2 May 1970 the branch line of the Deutsche Oper to the Richard-Wagner-Platz, most recently known as Line 5 closed down. This connection took over after its completion, the new line 7 Since there was already 70 years old tunnel in the line 1 only weakly reinforced concrete and then you had no experience with this design, the BVG could simply tear down the whole structure and built it again from a completely closed reinforced concrete frame. Accordingly, it was a metro station run in a perfect location, it was an underground station tower. Line 7 was a 110 meters long and 11.6 meters wide platform. For the small-profile line of uncomfortable contrast, two side platforms, which were each 4.5 meters wide, were built. For the construction of a central platform, the tracks were pulled apart and the line for a long time need to be shut down. As the name of the new station was chosen Bismarckstraße This was a little curious, because until 1961 was the 380 meters underground station located east German opera that name held. The extension of Line 7 and the railway station on the tower were on Bismarckstraße, 28 April 1978 in operation.\n\nCurious between uses of the elevated railway[]\n\nFlea market, Turkish bazaar and museum tram[]\n\nThe line in the border area with East Berlin between Gleisdreieck, lower Potsdamer Platz since the Wall went up on 13 August 1961 still. Also, the section between Wittenbergplatz on Nollendorfplatz and Bülowstraße to Gleisdreieck was rarely used, because to continue driving in the Mitte district was no longer possible. For economic reasons, the time used by the Line 2 section 1 January 1972 also shut down, the trains of Line 2 from the direction Krumme Lanke ended now at Wittenbergplatz. The unused elevated rail line through the north of Schöneberg now offered many facilities and space experiments. The empty tunnel route from Wittenbergplatz in direction Nollendorfplatz had to serve as the reciprocal system, since there had been any line 2 no other way for sweeping (changing the direction of travel). High in the empty train station Nollendorfplatz directed in 1973 a flea market in sixteen discarded, empty subway cars. On the track itself was now a new restaurant of the former tenant Heini Holl, calling itself \"The Nolle. In Buelowstrasse tried also people at a train station Nollendorfplatz similar to business - in 1975 was the \"Berlin Fair. As this project but could not prevail, it has already been closed a year later. On 28 May 1978 a new project tried his luck. With two are no longer needed subway cars, the so-called project \"U-Tropia - Station of the Nations was established. Toilets were installed in the cars, the station itself was a lot of things sold. To increase the attractiveness of both markets, the BVG established in August 1978 a shuttle service with tram museum elevated train tracks on one. However, \"U-Tropia\" did not last long in the winter of that year, it already closed its doors. As long as the high Buelowstrasse no new project was set up, had to pause the tram. In September 1980, however, was again a new project space in the High Street station Bülow, this time it was a \"Turkish bazaar. This in turn had much more success and so it remained until the restart of the elevated railway.\n\nThe M-Bahn[]\n\nIn the station there was triangle track only on the upper platform - the line 1 - operating in the lower contrast, not a single train was more. Been decided by the Bavarian House of Representatives at the request of the Senate on 2 December 1980, the AEG the unused route for the pilot plant with a magnetic to make available. The Senate planned to the future Berlin to replace small profile network underground by a monorail, which caused considerable concern, however, by the BVG. Construction work on the new route began in December 1983. In addition to the lower platform of the station Gleisdreieck stations were opened in addition, the Bemburger Straße (roughly where the present station Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park) and Kemperplatz. The first test runs for the 1.6 km long route began a year later. On 19 December 1988, it was attributed to bizarre accident when an unoccupied test train as an M-Bahn due to a handling error by interrupting the monitoring control at the terminal station Kemperplatz drove out through the end of the line, broke through a glass wall and hanging six feet above the ground remained. From 28 August 1989 was allowed to take advantage of the public trial as the M-Bahn, as she was now free. On 18 July 1991 was then the final approval as a new passenger transport system through the technical supervisor, which meant that had to be paid immediately from the passengers for an M-Bahn ride to the usual public transport fare. But only two weeks later had the M-Bahn stop operating. It began the construction works to re-starting the section of the thirty years before broken underground line U2. The bodies of the M-Bahn was dismantled and stored, for later re-worked as a feeder to the Schoenefeld Airport initially intended but has since been discarded and scrapped the material. Today, of which up to a double cabin in the Nuremberg Transport Museum on a piece of their original travel path can be seen, nothing left.\n\nFall of the Berlin Wall and reunification of the networks[]\n\nAfter the opening of the border on 9 November 1989, established a number of temporaries to deal with the huge cross-border traffic. While some of the continuous S-Bahn on the Friedrichstraße station could be restored relatively easily, was a quick link to the broken line A in 28 years is not possible. After all, however, the so-called \" ghost stations\" (closed stations, which were passed without stopping) of lines U6 and U8 reopened, so that one of the East Berlin A line at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz in the West could change lines U6 and U8. On 1 July 1990 integrates the Eastern lines A and E to West Berlin numbering scheme. Line A was given the line number \"U2\". This led to a three-year ongoing curiosity, since there were two lines with that description. Three months later, on 3 October, the day of reunification, was the Berlin U-Bahn network \"communist-free\": Station name from the GDR period, which did not meet the new contemporary tastes have changed. This involved two stages of U2:\n\nDimitroffstraße - Eberswalder Straße\n\nOtto-Grotewohl Straße - Mohrenstraße.\n\nThe new station name Eberswalder Straße was the result of a weird power struggle between the Senate and the district of Prenzlauer Berg: As the latter refused, under the Bulgaria Communist Party to name back appointed leader Georgi Dimitrov former Danziger Straße, the BVG selected by order of the transport Senator ado the opposite, but much less significant than Eberswalder street its name to the elevated station. This was retained even after the Dimitroffstraße was 1995, but still back named. Against the resistance conservative politician, however, remained a supposedly communist name get: are there named after Rosa Luxemburg in West Germany, many streets and squares, there was the call for a return appointment of the station Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz in Schönhauser Tor no convincing arguments. In 1991, work began to rebuild the missing link between the two parts of the U2, the section of track on Wittenbergplatz, Potsdamer Platz to Gleisdreieck and Mohrenstraße. This required a number of obstacles overcome and problems to be solved. The above temporary uses in the beautiful mountains high stations had finished, the route of the M-Bahn will be removed. In the area directly below the limit of the former train station Potsdamer Platz had the numerous backup and border posts will be removed. Finally, the two routes to a number of renovations, relocation and return buildings on 13 November 1993 to be joined. Simultaneously with the re-opening of the line allows for sorting in the Berlin small profile network was made:\n\nU1, previously Ruhleben - Schlesches Tor, now Krumme Lanke - Schlesches Tor\n\nU2, formerly Krumme Lanke - Wittenbergplatz (West) and Mohrenstraße - Vinetastraße (East), now Vinetastraße ↔ Ruhleben.\n\nU3, previously Uhlandstraße - Wittenbergplatz, now as U15 Uhlandstraße - Kottbusser Tor\n\nA new Night Line U12 Ruhleben - Schlesches Tor, during the recent U1. The U12 but was stopped during the introduction of the Berlin to nearly all subway lines existing night services on weekends in the year 2003.\n\nTwo new stations for the U2[]\n\nEven with the reopening of the U2 in 1993, spending on a new station had been provided on the line. At the time, had to ramp between the train stations Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz are built from scratch, since a 120-meter station must be perfectly horizontal. Therefore, the ramp has been re-designed and built a little steeper. A need for this station, however, arose only after completion of the new area around Potsdamer Platz. have paid Ostensibly, the DaimlerChrysler Group five million euros for this new building. Originally planned as Hafenplatz (working title), the BVG in-house built station Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park with two side platforms opened in 1 October 1998. The construction work was carried out without impeding the operation of U2. The station, designed by architects Hilmer, Sattler and partners, 619 meters from the subway station Potsdamer Platz and 469 meters from the subway station track triangle removed. For decades there were plans for an extension of the U2 to the train station Pankow. In 1930 the track was already been extended to the underground station Vinetastraße. A further extension to the north was due to the economic crisis is no longer about. Also in the expansion plans of the Nazi was always provided at least the U2 to the station Pankow, if not lead to even up Pankow church. Just as it was in the GDR, was the late 1980s it even concrete Bauankündigungen. This was mainly because the Berlin Transportation Company of the GDR (BVB) was missing a small profile workshop. All trains in both the large profile Friedrichsfelde workshop and in the railroad repair shop Schöneweide, which took over the function of a main workshop waited. These conditions no longer seemed acceptable, and so was looking for space for a new workshop, as well as the existing (very small) workshop at the underground station Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz did not satisfy the claims. This should be built east of the freight station Pankow, at the Granitzstraße. In this connection should also be extended underground to a station. Until 1988, the tunnel was extended after the fall of the tunnel was extended to a reciprocal system.\n\nOnly in the mid-1990s was the issue resurfaced. In many places in the metro network new interchanges between S-and U-Bahn were provided, this included the extension of the U2 nach Pankow. The groundbreaking ceremony for this new network expansion took place on 13 June 1997 with Peter Klemann senator. Was also discussed of help building a new small-profile workshop, as provided in GDR times [1] It is indeed abandoned to their construction, since the current workshop Grunewald can do all the work without capacity problems, but they built the foundations for a connection of a workshop with one. Extremely difficult ground conditions, the extremely high water table and finds a medieval Lichen settlement delayed the work remains substantial. Finally, it was only on 16 be September 2000, the new building with the new transfer station to the subway opened. The cost was instead of the estimated 126 million marks to 105 million marks [2]. Meanwhile, the name \"Bahnhof Pankow\" called for the public transport, however, decided to Pankow. The held in blue, white and yellow 110-meter-long underground station was in the Berlin U-Bahn network rare skylights, natural light can also penetrate into the station. It was designed by the architect Orlando Figallo. The construction work at the same time, a spacious reception hall built with that through a Elevator and escalators is a convenient transfer to the S-Bahn line S2 for Bernau possible. [2] There are also still planning, which is to be extended U2 in direction Pankow Kirche and Breite Straße. This planning is also provided in the financial scenario 2030 by the Berlin Senate. Such a medium is realization, at least in the realm of possibility. Both stations were the first new buildings in Berlin's small profile network for decades.\n\nExpansion and planning[]\n\nFor one of the main subway lines in Berlin there were and are still big plans. Since the opening of the Berlin U-Bahn had planned a route for Spandau to build. 1984, this already happened with U7, but there is still the plan, the U2 extend at least until after Spandau. At the station Spandau city hall, which ends today, the U7, already two track troughs were helped build to accommodate the arriving later this small profile U-Bahn without major alterations can. The special feature would be that this would drive the trains of the U2 in the left-hand traffic. However, to the U2 track not only lead to the Rathaus Spandau, but behind the same further north to Falkenhagener Feld. For another five stations are planned. This planning is very unrealistic from today's perspective: even by 2030, this extension is not expected, according to Senate. In contrast, the extension of the U2 on to Pankow into the largest Bauchancen, according to the U5-extension to the central station. By one station to the U2 continue to the center of the district of Pankow. These plans are not new, since the opening of the station Vinetastraße this was planned. The name of the future terminal station changed more frequently. not this extension with Germania plans. As the Nazi Third Reich was recorded, it is only since the GDR era concrete plans for it. At that time, he should Johannes R. Becher Street hot, after the Reunification width road again. . It would be possible but Alt-Pankow, Pankow Kirche or Pankow, Breite Straße[3] In the \"Middle Financial Scenario 2030\" by the Berlin Senate, this extension of the subway network as a single Small profile extension provided.\n\nIn addition to plans to redevelop the U2, there is still a major renovation program. Already with the opening of the section to the station several months Pankow block the route Senefelderplatz was - Vinetastraße ended. However, the stations and the route have generally suffered from the former line A at the time of the GDR much, causing the remaining stations will be rehabilitated in the former East. Since 2003 the station shines Märkisches Museum again in a new light, as well, with a lift. Also received the great interchange Alexanderplatz an all-round renovation, here are five elevators installed. On the occasion of the Football World Cup 2006 made the BVG renovate the station Olympic Stadium for € 4.47 million fully. He received new platform slabs and the refresh of the entrance building two elevators that can be achieved by a independent bridge from the station forecourt [4]\n\nIncidentally is also yet another renovation project that the section Alexanderplatz - includes city center. BVG is planning to modify the stations Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz, Spittelmarkt and restore the original state [5] has already been completed while the renewal of the station Spittelmarkt. There has already been re-opened the windows gallery as well as designed the track back walls with newly fired ceramic plates and various historical views. End of 2006 to begin construction work at the station downtown.\n\nFurthermore, the public transport 2005 that a bridge between the stations Gleisdreieck and Bülowstraße, which dates from the early days of the Berlin U-Bahn and has not been renovated after reunification, considerable damage has. The renovation of the building, which is directly above the tunnel mouth of the Tiergarten tunnel is started on 18 August 2006 and was initially to last year [6] Due to delivery problems of manufacturer of the new steel bridge, the Berlin public transport to work extended until March 2007.[7] In the time U2 was interrupted, the eastern line of Pankow - Gleisdreieck was abandoned here by the connecting tunnel at the Alexanderplatz operated virtually independently, drove between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz due to the complicated management only commuter trains on a ten- minutes. The western line of Ruhleben - Wittenbergplatz was extended until the Warschauer Straße, forming the new line U12. In that time the section Nollendorfplatz - Bülowstraße - Gleisdreieck set. The U1 was against it, such as reduced earlier times, the section Wittenbergplatz ↔ Uhlandstraße, the line was extended U3 contrast in the rush hour at two stations to Gleisdreick. In the seven to eight million-euro renovation, the bridge straightens at the same time be so in future the speed limit from 40 to 50 km / h can be increased. not by the BVG construction scheduled eight million euros expensive clean-up are other projects, such as the U 1 elevated rail line or the refresh of the Jannowitzbrücke station delay.[8] The regular traffic was on the 19th after the construction U2 March 2007 resumed. In addition to the adjustment program is running, the installation of lifts more. In recent years, received the stations Schönhauser Allee, Märkisches Museum, Alexanderplatz, downtown Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Olympia-Stadion and early 2009, also for tourists very important station Potsdamer Platz a lift. This currently have 15 of the 29 stations a accessibility access. End 2009/early 2010, followed in a further restructuring of the viaduct U2 a lift for the station Eberswalder Street, [9][10] to 2010 are further installations at the stations Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, Klosterstraße, Kaiserdamm and Gleisdreieck planned. The other five stations receive little for their important position until 2010, a lift.[11] After the fire station in Deutsche Oper decided to BVG in all stations that have only one exit, to install a second. Since spring 2006, the stations now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Sophie-Charlotte-Platz and Deutsche Oper, a further output at the other end of the platform.\n\nReferences[]\n\nTemplate:Coord missing\n\nTemplate:Link FA"
