        "text": "Thinking about living in one of the neighborhoods of Berlin? You're in for a treat. Berlin can be hip or historic, with the energy of a bustling metropolis or a peaceful suburb. Yet it's always on the brink of something extraordinary. Fortunately, Berlin’s neighborhoods also model this range of personality, offering residential areas that can be trendy, artistic and extremely welcoming to the ever-growing expat community. So, if you want to feel truly alive, Berlin’s neighborhoods offer quite an inspiring backdrop!\n\nBut there're one or two things you should know before moving to Berlin. And that's that every Berlin neighborhood has something very unique up its sleeve.\n\nAre you looking for a quiet uptown neighborhood for your family? Or maybe you're moving to Berlin to savour its vibrant nightlife? There're just so many reasons why you might want to move to this spirited city!\n\nTo help you find exactly what you’re looking for, we'll route you through the best neighborhoods in Berlin based on their\n\nquality of life\n\ninfrastructure\n\ninternationality\n\nsafety\n\nrental prices\n\nNow, let’s take a look at Berlin’s exciting neighborhoods, so you can explore rental homes in Berlin!\n\n1. Mitte\n\nMitte is the historic centre of Berlin. It’s made up of both the East and West districts and is a prime example of how Berlin is in a flux of constant change.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nIn Mitte, you’ll find important sites such as the Berlin Hauptbahnhof, the Brandenburg Gate, the Jewish Memorial and Potsdamer Platz along with a host of museums and innovative galleries.\n\nContemporary art lovers will absolutely love Hamburger Bahnhof, KW Institute for Contemporary Art, and the one and only Boros Bunker. And for more classical works, you’ll have a whole Museum Island at your disposal. This central district of Berlin is pretty much art heaven!\n\nIf you’re in Berlin for a semester to broaden your horizons, Mitte also boasts the impressive Humboldt University. This means that you’ll find a lively student crowd and nightlife scene in this neighborhood as well.\n\nIn case you’re moving to Berlin to begin your professional career, you’ll find that opportunities are abundant. Especially, within Berlin's startup scene. The area around Torstrasse is so full of tech industries that it’s called Silicon Allee, and it’s home to recognizable names like Volkswagen and Microsoft.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTransportation options are plentiful, and many people simply buy or rent a bike to get from A to B.\n\nInternationality\n\nMitte is one of the most international neighborhoods in Berlin. It’s extremely popular among expat professionals and tourists.\n\nSafety\n\nWhere tourists romp through one attraction after the other and the shopping options range from hip boutiques to high-end shops, pickpockets and shoplifters are usually not far behind. As a true \"pickpocket's paradise\", Berlin Mitte leads the crime statistics with a frequency of around 27,000 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nHowever, if you look beyond petty crime, Berlin Mitte yet remains one of the safer neighborhoods.\n\nRental Prices\n\nMitte is in the upper range of rental prices in Berlin with an average price of €13.87 per sq metre.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€550Apartment€1,500\n\n2. Neukölln\n\nOffering a sometimes quirky, alternative lifestyle, Neukölln appeals to many young people. A portion of the area was once an airport until a little over 10 years ago, and now it has been transformed into a trendy place to live and work.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nChilled vibe and variety of vegan eateries, vintage shops and markets - this is where the cool kids hang out.\n\nThe creative community has carved out a new home where everyone mingles in a neighborly vibe among art galleries, bars and funky restaurants. Neukölln bursts with secret spots and small experimental restaurants unlike any other.\n\nThe Schwuz is the hub of the LGBTQ+ scene where you’ll see anyone enter for a fun night out – unfazed by your personal sexual tastes or preferences in life. You’re thrilled about drag shows? The Silver Future on Westerstraße’s got something for you!\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe Berlin district of Neukölln offers easy connections across the city. And while the pricing has risen in recent years, it still offers many benefits.\n\nInternationality\n\nNeukölln is extremely popular with young expats and the hip crowd of Berlin. This area has a large Turkish and Arabic community, providing a real international touch and some of the best restaurants in Berlin.\n\nSafety\n\nThe crime statistics show that Neukölln is still the fourth most unsafe district in Berlin, where child and youth crimes are a serious concern.\n\nThe areas of Hermanplatz and Hermanstrasse remain a hot spot where the police presence continues to be high.\n\nRental prices\n\nWith Neukölln turning into the new hipster district, rents have risen significantly in recent years. However, it still remains one of the cheaper neighborhoods of Berlin with a median rent of €9.26 per sq metre.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€500Apartment€1,000\n\n3. Friedrichshain - Kreuzberg\n\nIf you want to have a healthy mix of work, school and partying, then Friedrichshain or Kreuzberg may be the obvious choice. This section of Berlin was one of the most damaged in all of the city after the bombing of World War II. But now it’s been rebuilt and filled with residents who are just as creative as the city itself.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nHere you’ll find a large student population, who flock to the Kollwitzplatz for the bustling nightlife scene. Berghain, ://about blank, Wilde Renate and an infinite number of bars and great restaurants spread across the Friedrichshain district.\n\nAnd not far from the Jewish Museum in Kreuzberg, lie The Berlinische Galerie and the König Gallery housed in the brutalist St. Agnes church. (Art and architecture fans alert!)\n\nWarschauer Straße is right in the centre of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. This area also contains major learning institutions, including the Macromedia University of Media and Communication and the Hertie School of Governance.\n\nWant to take a stroll through nature? The beautiful Viktoriapark is a green oasis with a roaring waterfall right in the middle of Kreuzberg.\n\nSafety\n\nYou can wander around Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg peacefully on your own. However, there are some areas to avoid, particularly during the night or with children. The northern part of Luisenstadt and between Oranienplatz and Kottbusser Tor, Görlitzer Park and Wrangelkiez, has seen a sharp increase in crime. The number of crimes has now reached around 35,500 per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe majority of offences here are theft, physical assault, drug offences and transport fraud.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nFriedrichshain-Kreuzberg boasts its viable public transportation options with the major Ostbahnhof and Warschauer Straße connections. You can get just about anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes!\n\nInternationality\n\nKreuzberg is full of diversity, with many immigrants calling it home. It’s also known for its large Turkish community, hosting a large Turkish market, where price haggling is encouraged!\n\nNeedless to say, Friedrichshain has one of the youngest overall populations in all of Berlin, and it is ideal for someone looking for a lively setting.\n\nRental prices\n\nWith the prices on the rise, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg has the second-highest rent index in Berlin at €13.2 per sq metre.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€529Apartment€1,300\n\n4. Charlottenburg - Wilmersdorf\n\nWhen most Berliners think of Charlottenburg, their minds probably go straight to shopping, as the retail mecca of Germany is situated squarely on Unter den Linden. However, this also affords numerous work opportunities with big names like Apple and fashion legends Gucci and Chanel.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nCharlottenburg-Wilmersdorf is an upmarket neighborhood in the former West Berlin. The area boasts many lovely parks and the British School.\n\nIt also offers theatres and a cabaret, so the performing arts crowd spends a lot of their free time in this neighborhood. Charlottenburg is also popular for its Asian eateries, so if you love noodle houses, you’ll have many options to choose from.\n\nIf you’re in Berlin to study, then this area might be your best bet, especially if you enrol at the nearby Technical University or the ESCP business school. You’ll also find multiple campuses of the largest art school in Europe, The Universität der Künste, located in this neighborhood of Berlin.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThere are four underground lines (U2, U7, U1, U9) giving you plenty of options to explore every corner of Berlin!\n\nInternationality\n\nCharlottenburg is a very popular destination for English-speaking expats and, especially, expatriate families.\n\nSafety\n\nThe boulevard lures tourists in Berlin with its numerous shopping malls and thus attracts shoplifters along with them. It comes as no surprise that some criminal energies are concentrated in Hardenbergplatz and Breitscheidplatz in particular, making Kurfürstendamm a \"hotspot\" for offences.\n\nNote that it’s ten times less likely that you’ll be confronted with a crime in the neighborhood around Wiesbadener Straße than on Kurfürstendamm.\n\nHowever if you look beyond the realm of pickpockets and shoplifters, the district is safe for you (and your family).\n\nRental prices\n\nCharlottenburg - Wilmersdorf has a high rent index with €12.45 being the average price per sq metre.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€550Apartment€1,200\n\n5. Pankow\n\nThis primarily residential area is very popular with young families and professionals. It’s clean, safe and has a thriving health scene comprising vegan cafes and organic food shops.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nCountless artists, writers and thinkers populate the area of Pankow as studio spaces here are much cheaper than in other European capitals. Plus, it’s also a good place to find co-working spaces if you’re a freelancer, digital nomad, or just like to get out of the office or library for some fresh ideas.\n\nYou’ll also find KulturBrauerei here, which was once a brewery but now is a huge draw for people looking for nightlife and dining, all under one roof.\n\nImmigrants like to settle in the section of Prenzlauer Berg, close to Mitte. It’s for a good reason it’s consistently voted one of the prettiest areas in all of Berlin. It offers many beautiful streets with art galleries, small boutiques and concept stores that you can endlessly explore on your weekends.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nDid you know that Pankow is so far north of Berlin that it borders Brandenburg? And yet, in no time at all, you'll be in any part of Berlin if you take a train, metro or bus.\n\nInternationality\n\nWhat once used to be an area dominated by students, artists and German families is becoming more popular among young urban professionals. Pankow’s gentrification is attracting heaps of internationals these days.\n\nSafety\n\nPankow positions itself in the average category of criminality. With 9 718 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Pankow is definitely considered a safe neighborhood where you don't have to worry about walking the streets alone.\n\nRental prices\n\nRental prices are average in Pankow at €10.5 per sq metre.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€475Apartment€1,075\n\n6. Lichtenberg\n\nLichtenberg is one of the most well-known neighborhoods in East Berlin. Partly, because it’s a prime example of the architecture of its post-Cold War days, made up of block-style concrete structures. Other reminders of the city’s history exist here in the Stasi Museum, filled with spy memorabilia, and a former prison, now the Hohenschönhausen Memorial.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nDepending on your point of view, some young people see this area as hip, but others note that it’s beginning to become outdated. And since you’re on the hunt for housing, lowering prices can work in your favour.\n\nFamilies with kids will enjoy the green zones of Lichtenberg and one of Europe’s largest zoos, Tierpark.\n\nLichtenberg also offers a wealth of business and internship opportunities. Many private companies are taking advantage of the budget-friendly pricing and are setting up shops in this area.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWhen you need to get around quickly in Berlin, the Berlin-Lichtenberg station offers a variety of links all across the city and beyond. So transportation is always fast and reliable.\n\nInternationality\n\nThis quiet residential area is a multicultural hub. It's known for a large Vietnamese community concentrated in the popular Dong Xuan Center. They share the neighborhood with predominantly working-class German families.\n\nSafety\n\nWhat‘s the safest district in Berlin? Ta-da: It's Lichtenberg! With 9 461 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, you're safer here than anywhere else in Berlin.\n\nRental prices\n\nLichtenberg is not only the safest but also the cheapest neighborhood in Berlin. Its average rent cost index is €9.03 per sq metre.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€470Apartment€820\n\n7. Tempelhof - Schöneberg\n\nLike so many of the cities in Berlin, Tempelhof played an important role during the Cold War with its now-defunct airport. That's where American planes would land to bring supplies to the people of West Berlin.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nSchöneberg was once a hot spot for culture in Berlin. In fact, many musicians lived here and even recorded albums in the neighborhood’s studio spaces, including the likes of David Bowie. It’s now known as the hub for alternative lifestyles in Berlin, with a myriad of gay bars and a pulsing nightlife scene.\n\nThe University of Economics and Law has its home in Schöneberg, so you can also expect a thriving student area with inexpensive housing options.\n\nHowever, it’s also a perfect place to raise your children, with many safe areas to play, cycle and skate. The former airport grounds regularly host public family activities, besides being just a great place for a picnic!\n\nOn top of that, Tempelhof-Schöneberg houses the Berlin and Alexander von Humboldt International Schools.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nLiving in Tempelhof, you'll be in neighboring neighborhoods like Schöneberg, Neukölln and Kreuzberg in no time. The area offers best public transportation, so you can reach every corner of Berlin quickly and easily.\n\nInternationality\n\nTempelhof-Schöneberg is a residential area of Berlin popular among German and expat families because of the green spaces and playgrounds it offers.\n\nYou’ll also find a high presence of international students and starters that come here to find a balance between low rent, lovely surroundings and trendy hipster hangouts.\n\nSafety\n\nIn Tempelhof-Schöneberg, you can walk through the streets without worries. Living in the south of the district is the safest place to be. By contrast, the north poses slight troubles, especially around Nolledorfplatz.\n\nRental prices\n\nThe rental prices in Tempelhof-Schöne are on the lower side with an average rent per sq metre of €10.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€520Apartment€990\n\n8. Treptow - Köpenick\n\nTreptow and Köpenick are very popular Berlin neighborhoods for young people and families, providing both safety and moderate housing prices.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nThe older industrial buildings in Treptow are transforming into office spaces for startups or co-working, so you can expect a young crowd of professionals. That brings along plenty of nightlife options and an inspiring art scene. At the same time, the tranquillity of Köpenick’s forests, lakes, and nature preserves makes the area perfect for windsurfing, sailing and cycling.\n\nThe popular Treptower Park offers a great place for picnics with friends and outdoor family activities. And it's also home to Archenhold Observatory, a favourite stop for science and astrology students. Plus, it’s a great place to see Berlin’s skyline.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTreptow is close to Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain, and Neukölln, and frequent trains make it simple to get around.\n\nKöpenick is a little further away from the centre of Berlin. But, just like Spandau, it’s a quiet retreat close to the city via public transportation lines.\n\nInternationality\n\nThanks to its low cost of living and its proximity to the hip areas of Kreuzberg and Neukölln, the Alt-Treptow neighborhood is increasingly popular with young expats and creatives. The more you move to the east, the more family houses you’ll encounter.\n\nKöpenick isn’t a particularly international neighborhood, but you’ll still feel comfortable there as an expat.\n\nSafety\n\nNo doubt about it: with 9,623 cases per 100,000 inhabitants you are safer in Treptow - Köpenick than in nearly any other neighborhood.\n\nRental prices\n\nThe rents in Treptow-Köpenick roughly reflect the average rental prices in Berlin with €10 per sq meter.\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€489Apartment€920\n\nNot so obvious places to live in Berlin\n\nWant to stay away from the action? In the popular neighborhoods of Berlin, it might be hard to find the piece and quiet you seek. Or maybe you’re looking for a place to start a family. Then safety and nature might be your primary concerns.\n\nIf that sounds like you, consider the tranquil residential areas of Steglitz - Zehlendorf, Marzahn - Hellersdorf, Reinickendorf, and Spandau.\n\nEach of these neighborhoods lies on the outskirts of Berlin, bringing about all the benefits of suburban lifestyle. Here you can enjoy the lowest rental prices and crime rates while having access to beautiful recreational areas. Steglitz - Zehlendorf, Spandau, and Reinickendorf will treat you with lush forests and lakes. In Marzahn - Hellersdorf, you’ll find historic GDR-era concrete towers, high-rise apartments and vast parks.\n\nAnd luckily Berlin’s developed public transport infrastructure allows you to easily commute to your study or work!\n\nType of accommodationRental priceRoom€350- 469Apartment€900 - 1000\n\nLet’s recap\n\nUrban families and expats with a higher income should consider the central location of Berlin Mitte or the upper-middle-class hood of Charlottenburg.\n\nAre you looking for a hot spot for culture and nightlife? Neukölln, Friedrichshain, and Kreuzberg are easily the coolest areas in Berlin.\n\nIf you want to be surrounded by many hip cafes and co-working spaces, look for an accommodation in Pankow. It’s the ultimate hub for digital nomads and a perfect location for urban professionals and modern families!\n\nAs a student, you’ll easily find a lovely house that fits into your monthly budget for living in Berlin in Lichtenberg. That is if you don't mind staying a bit further away from the action, of course.\n\nA lovely area for families and young internationals alike, Tempelhof-Schöneberg offers great spaces for family activities and student hangouts.\n\nMaybe vast green areas would be a deal-breaker? Then check out Treptow-Köpernick and Steglitz-Zehlendorf.\n\nReinickendorf, Spandau and Marzahn-Hellersdorf might be perfect for expats seeking a quieter place to live or raise their children.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nBerlin is a hot spot for internationals, so you’ll surely find your dream home around like-minded people. That also means that housing is in high demand in the German capital, so you’ll want to begin your search early.\n\nAnd whether you’re moving to Berlin or another exciting expat destination in Germany, it’s important to have all your paperwork ready.
