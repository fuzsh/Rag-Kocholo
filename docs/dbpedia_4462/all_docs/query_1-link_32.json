        "text": "Anyone leaving Berlin to the north via the Prenzlauer Promenade or entering the city from there will be familiar with the crumbling round locomotive shed, whose impressive dome is visible from the street: The brick structure with an interior turntable measures a full 64 meters in diameter. It is the penultimate round building of its kind in Germany and, as one of three listed buildings, a \"last witness\" to one of the largest and oldest marshalling and freight yards in Europe.\n\nIn a preparatory youth project for the Open Monument Day, ten students from the Rosa Luxemburg High School had the opportunity to get their own impression of the buildings and the grounds during a tour of the former depot. Under the expert guidance of a former skilled worker and the architectural firm responsible for maintenance, they not only gained exciting insights, but also information about the former function of the round locomotive shed, the ring locomotive shed and the multi-purpose building.\n\nIn the following days, the eighth graders dealt with the question of why the ensemble was listed as a historic monument and discussed ideas for its subsequent use. the young people learned about the challenges of use and planning of the new residential area \"Pankower Tor\" in a discussion with an expert from the Pankow Urban Planning Office.\n\nFinally, the young people collected name suggestions for the new streets to be created, which should make a reference to the history of the site visible.\n\nOn Sunday, September 11, 2022, the students of the Rosa-Luxemburg-Gymnasium will present their results in two guided tours and invite people to think along with them.\n\nproject management: Esther Stenkamp and Ellen Roters, Museum Pankow\n\nTranslated with DeepL"
