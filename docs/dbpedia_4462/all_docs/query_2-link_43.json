        "text": "Used by the GDR (German Democratic Republic) prior to the reunification of Germany in 1989, this roundhouse and locomotive works in northern Berlin was run by DB (Deutsche Bahn) until the end of the 1990's where it has since been left to be completely ransacked by pikeys, graffers, and now wide open for rail enthusiasts, explorers and dog walkers to mooch around.\n\nThere's many buildings on-site, from the map above you can make out the roundhouse, turntable, and engine storage sheds. Unfortunately it's hard to determine what function the other buildings had, with the largest being sealed but seemingly destroyed inside, and the smaller ones being open and completely destroyed inside. One of them had some form of stage inside, although no other hints as to it's use.\n\nApologies about the quality of some of the images, they're all taken without a tri-pod, either handheld or using make shift supports. It's a bit of a derp, but interesting to walk around none the less.\n\nMost annoyingly, the locomotive sheds were sealed shut.\n\nNo clues as to how tall this chimney is, and it must have taken some crazy minded graffers to scale the ladder to paint."
