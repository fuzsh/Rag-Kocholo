        "text": "Discover Berlin comfortably, safely and cheaply to Berlin's sights: Use the well-developed network of S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains, buses and trams. Here we inform you about tariffs, timetables and contacts of Berlin's public transport system.\n\nTariffs for Berlin's public transport\n\nThere are three fare zones in Berlin: Sub-area A is bounded by the S-Bahn ring and includes the city centre. Sub-area B ends at Berlin's city limits. Sub-area C covers the surrounding areas of Berlin (e.g. the new BER airport, Potsdam, Oranienburg),\n\nWithin these zones, it doesn't matter whether you are travelling by bus, underground, S-Bahn or regional train, as long as you have purchased the appropriate ticket covering the relevant zone or zones from an official point of sale.\n\nThe standard fare applies to adults, the reduced fare applies to children aged 6 to 14. Children under the age of 6 do not require a ticket. The best way to buy tickets is at one of the many BVG and S-Bahn Berlin sales points, at the ticket machines directly in the stations or conveniently via app on your smartphone. The ticket machines are conveniently available in 6 languages (German, English, French, Spanish, Turkish, Polish) and can be used around the clock.\n\nOverview of ticket prices\n\nPlease note: Tickets must be validated when travelling.\n\nIn this video we show you How to use public transport in Berlin\n\nHow do I validate a ticket?\n\nIn Berlin, there are no turnstiles in front of the entrances to the platforms. When using regional rail services and the S-Bahn and U-Bahn, tickets must be validated on the platform. To do this, you will find small devices that are attached to a column and click or beep as soon as you insert the ticket. The direction in which you have to insert the ticket is described on the device. Once it has clicked, your ticket should be stamped with the current date and time of validation.\n\nIn the case of buses and trams, the devices are located inside the vehicle, where you can use them as soon as you have boarded. If you have purchased your ticket via app, make sure you activate the ticket before starting your journey. You can recognise an activated app ticket by the fact that the usage time expires.\n\nAttention: Public transport in Berlin is based on independence and trust. Nevertheless, ticket inspections are carried out at regular intervals. The staff checking the tickets may be in plain clothes. The check is announced by the words \"Die Fahrscheine bitte\" and the ticket inspectors identify themselves at the beginning of the check without being asked by means of an official ID card. If you do not have a valid ticket with you, you will be fined.\n\nPurchasing tickets via app\n\nYou can purchase tickets for local public transport using various apps. It doesn't matter which provider you bought your ticket from, as long as the correct zones are covered by your ticket.\n\nBVG ticket app\n\nTicket-App S-Bahn\n\nTicket-App VBB\n\nSpecial tickets that combine public transport with discounts for tourists cannot be purchased in all apps. These include the Berlin Welcome Card. You can either buy this online in advance or on site at one of our Berlin Tourist Info - to be found at BER Airport and the main railway station, among other places.\n\nOpening times for public transport\n\nOn weekdays, public transport in Berlin runs roughly between four in the morning and half past one at night. There are also special night buses, which you can recognise by the \"N\" in front of their route number. On the nights Friday to Saturday and Saturday to Sunday, public transport runs 24 hours, that means all night long without a break.\n\nLine networks for Berlin"
