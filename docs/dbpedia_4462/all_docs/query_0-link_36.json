        "text": "This cycle tour takes us through urban and rural areas in the northern part of Berlin.\n\ndifficult\n\nDistance 78.1 km\n\nDuration5:30 h\n\nAscent31 m\n\nDescent32 m\n\nHighest point62 m\n\nLowest point30 m\n\nWe start at the Wollankstraße S-Bahn station on the border between Pankow and Wedding and cycle northwest along the tracks. At Nordgraben we turn right and a few metres later left parallel to Uhlandstraße onto the cycle path. We cross Wilhelmsruher Damm and Quickborner Straße on this path and meet road 127 straight ahead, which we continue to follow north along the \"Heidekrautbahn\". The landscape changes a little - while the route was previously lined with trees and loosely scattered residential houses, we now ride through fields. After about 300 m, the path leads us to the left, where we cross Blankenfelder Chaussee a little later and continue straight on to Schildower Weg. We follow this to the right, cross the \"Heidekrautbahn\" and then turn left onto a paved asphalt road, Lübarser Weg. At Schildower Straße, we keep to the right. After about 700 m, we turn left onto a field and forest path that is easy to overlook and follow its natural course straight ahead, keeping right at the T-junction to reach the main road. We continue our tour to the left to Mönchmühle and leave this village again on the Kastanienallee until we reach the railway line of the \"Heidekrautbahn\" again. We turn right and continue cycling along the track. At the crossroads we follow Buchholzer Straße northwards. After passing under the motorway, we leave Buchholzer Straße on the left into a forest path that leads us through a deciduous forest and turn right at the next junction. After just under 1 km we come to a crossroads in the middle of the forest, where we keep left. Now we continue straight ahead in a northerly direction until we reach Dammsmühle Castle, where we pass between the castle and the lake. There are now several small paths here, some of which are also blocked by fallen trees. We take the partly sandy Dammsmühler Weg to the north. This takes us to Zühlsdorf, where we turn right at the large crossroads into Oranienburger Straße. After crossing the Summter Chaussee, we keep to the right at the next crossroads. This forest path soon makes a gentle left turn, which takes us back towards the southwest. We cross the state road and continue our cycle tour along the Briese stream to the Briese colony. We leave this on the Fichtenallee in the direction of Birkenwerder. Now we keep south along the railway line until we reach Berliner Straße. We pass Hohen Neuendorf and keep to the right at the southern end of Frohnau. We reach Heiligensee and cycle along the promenade of the Havel Lake to Konradshöhe and Tegelort. We now follow the shore of the Tegelersee northwards. At the northern edge of the Malchsees we keep to the right until we reach Berliner Straße. Here we turn right for a short distance. At the next junction, we keep left and cross the tracks, which we follow in a southerly direction to the Eichborndamm S-Bahn station. We now cycle south to the Volkspark Rehberge. Via the district of Wedding, we now cycle along the former course of the Berlin Wall back to the Wollankstraße S-Bahn station, our starting point."
