        "text": "Berlin Hauptbahnhof is the most important railway hub in Berlin, Germany, and the largest elevated station in Europe. The station is located in the western part of Moabbit in the Berlin Mitte, next to the northern edge of the government office, and is the only station in the world that can be reached by car from four directions. The main entrance gates, which are similar at both ends, face the Europa Square and Invaliden Avenue in the north, and the Washington Square in the south to the Spree River. On the south side of the station is a Spree River Curve Park with the German Chancellery and Paul Lopez House; the east side is connected to the Humboldt Harbour, which belongs to Mitte.\n\nThe German high-speed railway (ICE) and regional trains entering Berlin at the Berlin main train station take the train east to Berlin via the East Berlin station and further to Poland. The westbound track leads to Hanover and Hamburg or Potsdam via Spandau Station. The northbound direction of the North-South Long-distance Railway connects to the Berlin Loop Railway and heads north to the northern part of Brandenburg via the Wellness Spring Station. In the northeast, you can reach Hanover and Hamburg, and in the south you can reach Halle and Leipzig or Dresden via Potsdamer Platz and Southern Cross.\n\nThe basement of the main train station is one of the two tunnel stations of the North-South Long-distance Railway. Station 1-8 is known as the Berlin Hbf Tief, because tief is underground in German. Some trains to and from Hamburg, Munich, Leipzig, Dresden, Prague and Budapest use 1-8 stations. Domestic German high-speed trains to Frankfurt or Cologne can depart from 1-8 platform (tief) or 11-16 stations. You can use the station departure screen to see which station you need to go to.\n\nIt is convenient to walk from the station to the Reichstag (11 minutes) and the Brandenburg Gate (18 minutes). S Bahn is the easiest way to travel in Berlin. Just buy a ticket and take the S-bahn train from the ground platforms 15 and 16. The station is docked with a number of lines from the Berlin Express train to the surrounding cities of Potsdam, Elkner and Strausberg. This station also provides subway service.\n\nFrom Berlin Central Station, head south from the centre of Berlin and look south. This is the 0th floor. On the first floor there are shops, ticket offices, first class lounges and left luggage storage, then to the 11-16 platform on the 2nd floor. - There is a store on the 1st floor, then go further to the 2nd floor and you will find the platform 1-8.\n\nThere are many dining options in the station, including Burger King, McDonald's and Pizza Hut. There is a fairly large REWE supermarket on the 1st floor where you can buy food. It is located in the southwest corner of the -1 floor. There are various ATMs around the station. If you need to leave your luggage, luggage storage and luggage storage are available, and luggage storage is on the +1 floor. WiFi is available at the station and the first 30 minutes are free.\n\nIf you have a first class long distance train ticket, you can use the DB first class lounge, free tea, coffee, beer and snacks as well as free WiFi. It is located at the southwest corner of the +1 level, going up one level from the main entrance and turning left, below the platform 11. Follow the signs to the DB Lounge. It is usually open daily from 06:00-22:00."
