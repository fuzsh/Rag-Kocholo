Also aired was a chase scene along the canals of Venice, Italy from the movie.\n\nHis studio slate presentation also included a duo of clips from Home, slated for a spring 2015 worldwide rollout, whose English-language version features original songs from Rihanna and the popstar’s voice for Tip, a little girl who avoids capture when the world is taken over by aliens and befriends one of the invaders.\n\nPHOTOS Team Hillary Clinton: Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen and Her 2016 Supporters\n\nAnd Katzenberg also flagged up B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations for June 2015 and Kung Fu Panda 3 for the holiday season in 2015.\n\nB.O.O. is about a secret government agency that employs ghosts to protect humans from evil hauntings.\n\nThe studio founder and CEO said in the third outing of Kung Fu Panda, the Jack Black-voiced Po will face a supernatural enemy and “one much closer to home” in the movie.\n\n20th Century Fox co-presidents, worldwide theatrical marketing and distribution Paul Hanneman and Tomas Jegeus opened the Katzenberg show saying how delighted Fox was to be distributing movies, trumpeting How To Train Your Dragon 2’s opening at number one in several European territories.\n\nPHOTOS George Lucas, Sarah Chalke Honor Jeffrey Katzenberg at Anti-Defamation League Dinner\n\nKatzenberg is due back onstage at the show’s awards ceremony and dinner, where he is due to present Catalan soccer giants FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu with the Variety International Children’s Fun Humanitarian Award in the company of former Miss World Megan Young.\n\nCineEurope is operated by FilmExpo Group, which is owned by THR‘s parent company, Guggenheim Partners. The annual convention runs June 16-19 in Barcelona."
