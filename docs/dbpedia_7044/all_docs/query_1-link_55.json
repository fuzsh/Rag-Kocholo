        "text": "Skipper:\n\nNot to worry, men. There's more than one way to make a penguin puke his guts out.\n\nPrivate:\n\nHow many...?\n\nSkipper:\n\nSeventeen. Just don't ever ask to see number twelve.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThat bomb is not coming out. We could send a man inside to defuse it if we were about yea tall.\n\nSkipper:\n\nAnd how close are we from shrink ray technology?\n\nKowalski:\n\n700 years.\n\nSkipper:\n\n[tosses aside a device next to him] Curse you, shrink ray!\n\nKowalski:\n\nMake that 712.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, Rico, looks like it's game over. I never thought it would end this way, but I just want you to know... I love you, you crazy knucklehead.\n\nKowalski:\n\nI also love you, in the same way expressed previously... dude.\n\nPrivate:\n\n[Hugging Rico] I love you too, Rico!\n\n[Rico starts to retch]\n\nMort:\n\n[Inside Rico] And I love this popcorn. It's a little wet, though.\n\n[Rico's stomach rumbles]\n\nKing Julien:\n\nEh, what is that noise?\n\nSkipper:\n\n[breaking down] I'm not good with words - well, actually, neither are you - but I just wanna say... you are my brother!\n\nKowalski:\n\nThat's poetry, Skipper.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI don't know about him, but this mush is making me want to blow chunks.\n\nSkipper:\n\nDo you mind?\n\nPrivate:\n\nWherever the sun lays its head, there the land will whisper, \"Rico. Rico.\"\n\nKowalski:\n\n[breaking down] Okay, now that's poetry!\n\n[They all cry and hug each other; Julien joins in; they all glare at him]\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI just want to see a penguin throw up.\n\nKowalski:\n\nOkay, do you see the bomb?\n\nMort:\n\nUm, I see and old squeaky toy. Wait, I see it! I see the bomb!\n\nKowalski:\n\nGood. Now separate the blue and yellow wires from their sheating, reverse the polarity, and splice both to the ground lead, which should be a slightly thicker copper wire. Am I going too fast for you?\n\nMort:\n\nUm, okay. Which of the colors is blue? [the penguins sigh exasperatedly] Is this the blue one? [Rico shrieks]\n\nKowalski:\n\nNo, I believe that's a kidney.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nExcuse me, little froggy. I believe you are a little confussed. I am the one who is telling the other animals what to do.\n\nBarry:\n\nOh?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes. That is because I am king. However, you can apply for an internship.\n\nMaurice:\n\nWe are currently accepting applications for the spring semester. [Hands Barry a form]\n\nKing Julien:\n\nBut until you are properly internalized, you must cease the bossing around.\n\nBarry:\n\nOh, really? Cease this!\n\nPrivate:\n\nWhat are we going to do, Skipper?\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski has been working on a little top secret project. It's untested, maybe even dangerous.\n\n[Starts pushing a series of complicated controls]\n\nSkipper:\n\nPrepare yourself for what you are about to see, Private.\n\n[Pushes one last button, a platform appears in the middle of the room]\n\nPrivate:\n\nSkipper, is that...?\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat's right. A six-foot long whacking stick. Barry won't know what hit him.\n\nPrivate:\n\nSkipper, isn't there a less violent solution?\n\nSkipper:\n\nProbably, but I wanna see what this baby can do.\n\nBarry:\n\n[Private appears wearing a metal suit] It's time you and I got... in touch. Take this!\n\n[Jumps at Private; nothing happened]\n\nBarry:\n\nAnd this!\n\n[Jumps Private again]\n\nBarry:\n\nHuh? I can't...\n\nPrivate:\n\nYou can't touch me, but I can touch you.\n\nBarry:\n\nNo! Get away from me!\n\n[Private shoots a suction cup dart at Barry and reels him in]\n\nPrivate:\n\nNow I'm going to do something no one has ever done to you before.\n\nBarry:\n\nNo!\n\nPrivate:\n\nGive you a big hug!\n\nBarry:\n\nUh... what?\n\nPrivate:\n\nI'd be a grumpy gus too if no one ever hugged me.\n\nBarry:\n\nHum. This hugging is nice. Maybe a hug is all I really needed... or maybe I'm just a big jerk who likes to bully other animals.\n\nPrivate:\n\nOh, well in that case, I can just pop you like a grape.\n\nBarry:\n\nNo, no! Hugging's fine! Actually, I'm liking the hug.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nThis half of the kingdom is for me and my king things, and that half is for you two.\n\nMaurice:\n\nThis is much less than half!\n\nMort:\n\nI like it.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOf course it's smaller. There is only one of me and two of you.\n\nMaurice:\n\nThat means we should have more and you should have less.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nThe king never has less. That's the law.\n\nBarry:\n\nMy name is Barry, and you all work for me now. Everyone. You do everyting I say when I say it.\n\nMarlene:\n\nOh, have you ever heard a more adorable tirade? I just wanna scoop him up and give him a great big hug!\n\nBarry:\n\nTrust me, lady, I'm not the hugging type. I'm more the do-what-I-say-or-I'll-ruin-your-life type.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOh, really, little hoppy? And how are you gonna do that?\n\nBarry:\n\nOh, like this.\n\n[Touches Rico, who seizes up, sprouts little green bumps, and falls unconscious]\n\nBarry:\n\n[laughs] Oh, that never gets old! That never gets old!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nMaurice, those penguins are going to meet Marlene's new boyfriend.\n\nMaurice:\n\nHuh. Good for her.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nNo, not good for her. She already has a boyfriend.\n\nMaurice:\n\nShe does?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes, silly. It's me!\n\nMaurice:\n\nYou? Let me guess. Marlene doesn't know you're her boyfriend, does she?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWell, I have been meaning to mention it to her. But it is clear to me now that I must step up my wooing.\n\nMaurice:\n\nAll right. We'll need flowers, some candy...\n\nKing Julien:\n\nNo, Maurice! The only way to win this competition is to eliminate the other competition.\n\nMaurice:\n\nAll right. Well need a sack, a club, some rope...\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes, Maurice! Now you are thinking romantically.\n\nPrivate:\n\nI wonder how the rest of Marlene's date went?\n\nSkipper:\n\nI'm sure it was a many splendored thing.\n\nKowalski:\n\nOf course. It was scientifically approved.\n\nMarlene:\n\nHi, guys. So, me and Fred? Not happening.\n\nKowalski:\n\nWhat?\n\nMarlene:\n\nTurns out what I thought was him being funny was actually just him being...\n\nSkipper:\n\nDumb as a sack of hammers?\n\nMarlene:\n\nLet's just say I did not hear Spanish guitar when we were together.\n\nKowalski:\n\nBut, but science let us to him. Science said he was perfect. Science! Why have you forsaken me?\n\nSkipper:\n\n[the penguins discover some photos pinned on Burt's habitat] Well, this is, uh, disturbing, to me. Anyone else?\n\nPrivate:\n\nI'm disturbed as well, Skipper.\n\nKowalski:\n\n[Focusing on a photo of a kid] Look at that kid with the kazoo. Could it be? The legendary Kid Kazoo?\n\nRico:\n\nKid Kazoo?\n\nKowalski:\n\nYou know, Kid Kazoo? The scourge of the Central Park Zoo? Surely you've heard the tales. He was a Sunday regular, a real piece of work, with a smile like a bear trap, and a laugh like a deranged birthday clown. But the sickest thing was that kazoo, screeching incessantly like a kindergarten orchestra.\n\nPrivate:\n\nThat sounds horrible, Kowalski.\n\nKowalski:\n\nKazoos always do, Private. But no one had it worse than poor Burt. With those jumbo-sized ears, that constant buzzing was unbearable. He hated that kazoo! I wonder what ever happened to the little maniac?\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Looks at a picture of an adult man] Wait a minute. Look at those shifty eyes. That devious half-smile. Those kazoo-kissed lips.\n\nKowalski:\n\nBy Newton's apple, you're right! It's Kid Kazoo all grown up!\n\nRico:\n\nWow!\n\nPrivate:\n\nBurt really knows how to hold a grudge. For years, apparently.\n\nSkipper:\n\nEyes on the prize, Kowalski. Crack the new habitat security code, and we'll be swimming in all the fish we can stomach.\n\nRico:\n\nFiiish! Ha-ha-ha!\n\nKowalski:\n\nI'm trying, but this is the most advanced encryption I've ever seen. It's got sudoku with fractions!\n\nSkipper:\n\nHave you tried the master code?\n\nKowalski:\n\nOne, two, three, four, five. Darn! Nothing!\n\nSkipper:\n\nNow try it backwards.\n\nKowalski:\n\nFive, four, three, two, one. Aah!\n\nSkipper:\n\nNow start at three...\n\nRico:\n\nFiiiish!\n\n[Spits out a chainsaw and cuts through the computer]\n\nKowalski:\n\nWow. We're in!\n\nSkipper:\n\nWay to hack that mainframe, Rico!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nTo impress this girly monkey, you must sweep her off her feet. That is how I got my many girlfriends.\n\nMaurice:\n\nWhat girlfriends?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYou don't know them, they're all in Canada, but trust me when I tell you that they are made up... I mean with lipstick and powders and such, but you know, tastefully. The secret is the two words I am about to tell you now. Get ready. Wait! Those weren't the two words. And those weren't either. Or those...\n\nMason:\n\nJust tell us the two words!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOkay... Roller disco!\n\nSkipper:\n\nAtenzione, little rodentia. Has anyone seen a leafy crown?\n\nRat #1:\n\nMaybe.\n\nRat #2:\n\nWhat's it to ya?\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe need it, pronto.\n\nRat #1:\n\nit belongs to our king.\n\nRat #2:\n\nAnd there's only one way to take it from him.\n\nPrivate:\n\nSmile and say please?\n\nRat #2:\n\nNo!\n\nRat #1:\n\nPaw-to-paw combat!\n\nRat #1, Rat #2:\n\nBeat the king, get the crown! Beat the king, get the crown!...\n\nSkipper:\n\nOkay, I'll go easy on him. Where is the little guy?\n\n[a huge muscular rat appears, wearing Julien's crown]\n\nPrivate:\n\nOh, you are toast.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWhat was that, Private?\n\nPrivate:\n\nUh... I mean, hard on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, and good in a jam.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOh, that's nice.\n\nKing Rat:\n\nYou are going down, clown! Down to Rat Town!\n\nPrivate:\n\nAren't we already there?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI want my crown!\n\nMarlene:\n\nAnd I have your crown. A crown that you will love as much as you love yourself because...\n\n[Puts a novelty drinking cup with Julien's head on its lid upon Julien's head]\n\nMarlene:\n\nIt's you!\n\nMarlene:\n\n[imitating Julien's accent] I am sensing that there is an awesome amount of fabulousness here.\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[looking at himself in mirror] It is hot with handsomeness.\n\nMarlene:\n\nAnd here's the best part!\n\n[Puts straw on Julien's mouth; he sips]\n\nKing Julien:\n\nHmm. My need for beauty and my need for fizzy drink; both are satisfied.\n\n[He sucks on the straw until the cup collapses]\n\nKing Julien:\n\nAh! My little head!\n\n[He tosses aside the cup; it lands on top of Maurice's head]\n\nMort:\n\nI like you hideously disfigured.\n\nPrivate:\n\nLooks like someone got a new circuit board.\n\nKowalski:\n\nYes, state of the art processor, hollah!\n\nPrivate:\n\nSo where did you get it?\n\nKowalski:\n\nUh, I... [mumbles]\n\nPrivate:\n\nCome again?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI got it from... [Mumbles]\n\nPrivate:\n\nYou got it from where?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI took it from Mort's video game, all right? I stole from poor, innocent Mort to fuel my own scientific ambitions! But it was totally worth it. See? [Turns on psychotron]\n\nPrivate:\n\n[thoughts transmitted from psychotron] Oh, Kowalski. How could you?\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Thoughts transmitted from phsychotron] This side of you makes me want to throw up in my beak!\n\nRico:\n\n[Thoughts transmitted from psychotron] Fiiiiish!\n\nKowalski:\n\n[Thoughts transmitted from psychotron] They're right. I'm a monster. A selfish monster!\n\nKowalski:\n\nOh, what have I done? [Throws psychotron across room; King Julien enters and poses next to psychotron]\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[thoughts transmitted from psychotron] I would look good in pantaloons.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes, I agree with the voice that sounds like me. Pantaloons would accent my regality, but that is not why I'm here.\n\nSkipper:\n\nMaurice thinks he can bribe us with his pi?ata promises. Pity for him, penguins are not for sale. Right, men?\n\nPrivate:\n\nI wonder what's in that pi?ata? I bet it's full of butterscotch lollies and sour balls.\n\nKowalski:\n\nI'd say we're looking at a 50/50 mix of gummy fish and candy buttons.\n\nRico:\n\nYay, buttons!\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe may never know, because today we are performing scheduled maintenance on the HQ.\n\nKowalski:\n\nPerhaps we can reschedule?\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe can't just reschedule scheduled maintenance that's been scheduled, right here on the schedule.\n\nMaurice:\n\nLook, you don't understand how important this is. You want King Julien to be happy on his day. One time everyone forgot about King Julien Day, and let me tell you...\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[Flashback] Which forgetter is next for the whooping? Come on, I want you to hurt like I do! Ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nMaurice:\n\nOh, I couldn't sit right for a week. Trust me, you do not want him to freak on you!\n\nSkipper:\n\nI don't like it. What do you make of it, Kowalski?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI'm not sure, Skipper. It could be anything.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOh really? Could it be Alaska?\n\nKowalski:\n\nNooo... Its probably not A...\n\nSkipper:\n\nAre you saying that Alaska might be stuck upside down to the clock tower of my zoo?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI guess...\n\nSkipper:\n\nBecause I think people would notice if the entire state of Alaska just packed up and moved to the zoo.\n\nKowalski:\n\nAlright! Maybe it couldn't be anything!\n\nRico:\n\nWuuh.\n\nSkipper:\n\nI'm sorry, boys. I sometimes resort to sarcasm when facing the unknown.\n\nKowalski:\n\nNo duh.\n\nSkipper:\n\nStop! Stop!\n\nPrivate:\n\nThe zombie can speak!\n\nSkipper:\n\nI'm... not a zombie.\n\nKowalski:\n\nBut the infection. We heard the doctor say...\n\nSkipper:\n\nWho are you gonna believe, some two-bit medicine man, or your own commanding officer?\n\nPrivate:\n\nCan it really be true?\n\nKowalski:\n\nBut how can we know for sure?\n\n[Rico holds up chainsaw]\n\nPrivate:\n\nOh, Rico. Chainsaw's your answer to everything.\n\nSkipper:\n\nMen, amigos, my brothers in black and white. Look at me! All I've got is a broken wing, and I'm pretty sure that's not contagious.\n\nPrivate:\n\nThen why were you chasing us?\n\nSkipper:\n\nBecause it itches like sandpaper underpants. Rico, scratch maneuvers, double time.\n\n[Rico approaches Skipper]\n\nPrivate:\n\nNo, Rico!\n\n[the others tackle Skipper]\n\nKowalski:\n\nNice try, zombie!\n\n[They fall off the roof; cut to them in the vet's office]\n\nSkipper:\n\nOkay, I stand corrected on the contagiousness of broken wings, but I did tell you I wasn't a zombie.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThis does not wash! We're penguins, they're insects. We've got the size advantage.\n\nPrivate:\n\nBut Skipper, they've got the owie advantage.\n\nRico:\n\nOwie!\n\nPrivate:\n\nWe can't take out their nest without entering a world of pain.\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski, were are we on eliminating pain?\n\nKowalski:\n\nWay ahead of you, Skipper. I have been perfecting a pain elimination helmet.\n\n[Puts on helmet and taps it to activate it]\n\nKowalski:\n\nAs you will see, the nerve inhibiting matrix will provide 100% protection from any kind of...\n\n[Lets a cinder block fall on his flipper]\n\nKowalski:\n\nAah! It's not perfected! Oh, it hurts! It hurts so bad!\n\nKowalski:\n\nOkay, let's get stupid! [Turns on degausser on Private; he falls unconscious] Private? Are you all right?\n\nSkipper:\n\nRico, my medical supplies.\n\n[Rico coughs up two rubber gloves; Skipper slaps Private with them until he's conscious]\n\nPrivate:\n\nOoh, is that a cotton candy machine? I like cotton candy.\n\n[Goes to machine and gets shocked]\n\nKowalski:\n\nEureka! Stupid mission accomplished!\n\nSkipper:\n\nAll we need to do now is to point him towards the hornet's nest and...\n\nPrivate:\n\nOh, pretty shiny light machine.\n\nKowalski:\n\nNo, not the degausser!\n\nPrivate:\n\n[Turns on degausser and waves it over his head] I'm a disco penguin.\n\nKowalski:\n\nBe careful!\n\n[the degausser drains all of their thoughts; they fall unconscious]\n\nPrivate:\n\nHello?\n\nKowalski, Skipper:\n\nI like degaussing!\n\n[Rico laughs stupidly]\n\nKowalski, Skipper, Private, Rico:\n\nYay!\n\nSkipper:\n\n[after Jiggles absorbs Julien] Kowalski, give me lemur extraction options, stat!\n\nKowalski:\n\nDon't you see? Julien was a Jiggles hater! You know what happens to Jiggles haters!\n\n[Rico whispers \"cuckoo\"]\n\nKowalski:\n\nThis is what happens when you hate on my monster!\n\nSkipper:\n\nAha! So you admit you made a monster.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe good kind of monster. My kind!\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Slaps Kowalski] You gotta snap out of it, Kowalski!\n\nKowalski:\n\nOh! Oh I see. You're all haters now! Well, see you later, science haters!\n\n[Climbs on Jiggles as it crawls away]\n\nPrivate:\n\nHe called us haters. That makes me sad, Skipper.\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[singing] Oh, spirit of the night / Who may or may not bite / You bring the otter fright / You bring the otter fright, though you are out of sight / Go away, go away!\n\nMaurice:\n\nGo way away!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI say don't stay!\n\nMaurice:\n\nI say don't stay!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nGo away, go away!\n\nMaurice:\n\nGo way away!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI say don't stay!\n\nMaurice:\n\nI say don't stay!\n\nThe Skipper:\n\nCome on, men. Let's leave this to the tiny dancer, and get us some shut-eye.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nMy ghost mojo is working! Can you feel it.\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski, report.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe robot...\n\nRico:\n\nBoom.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nAaaagh! What - what has been done by you to my poor Lemmy?\n\nKowalski:\n\nWell, we... It was an accident.\n\nPrivate:\n\nWe didn't mean to blow him up.\n\nRico:\n\nKablamo!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nHe was the only robot I was ever loving.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe're sorry, Ringtail. We just knew what was best.\n\nRico:\n\nKablamo!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nKablowing him up was the best?\n\nRico:\n\nKablamo!\n\nSkipper:\n\nOkay, we said we knew what was best. We just didn't do what was best.\n\n[Julien leaves, crestfallen]\n\nRico:\n\n[Sadly] Kablamo.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThis is madness. Utter madness! That robot has to be decisive, forceful, able to take down an armed space squid from 50 yards.\n\nPrivate:\n\nRight.\n\nSkipper:\n\nYou can't boogie your way out of a Martian invasion. Those space squids play for keeps.\n\nPrivate:\n\nBut what can we do about it?\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe need to extract that robot away from Julien's sick schooling, and teach him the penguin way.\n\nKowalski:\n\nYes! We are getting a robot!\n\nSkipper:\n\nAffirmative.\n\nPrivate:\n\nBut how do we get the robot away from Julien?\n\nMort:\n\n[Steps out of the shadows, speaks in onminous tone] Leave that to me.\n\nSkipper:\n\nUm... okay.\n\nMort:\n\n[Cheerful] Really?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nMaurice, I worry about those penguins. What could make them believe in curses?\n\nMaurice:\n\nShort of that penguin meeting a foul end, nothing.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nAha, but what if we made Freako...\n\nMaurice:\n\nRico.\n\nKing Julien:\n\n...Rico meet a foul end? That would make them believe.\n\nMaurice:\n\nProbably, but it wouldn't be a curse.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWouldn't it, Maurice? Are you sure?\n\nMaurice:\n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nAnd I'm pretty not. No, no, wait! I'm pretty. Very, very pretty. So pretty! Mort, tell me I am pretty.\n\nMort:\n\nYou are pretty.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nThank you. See, Maurice? Mort agrees with me. Case closed.\n\nMaurice:\n\nAll right. What did you have in mind?\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski, just what are we looking at here?\n\nKowalski:\n\nIsn't it obvious?\n\nPrivate:\n\nLooks like a regular old fish to me.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThat's because it is.\n\n[Private turns to Rico, who shrugs \"I don't know\"]\n\nSkipper:\n\nFantastic. Uh, thanks for clearing that up, Kowalski. Meeting adjourned.\n\nKowalski:\n\nNo, wait! It's a regular fish now, but when I zap it with my super ray, it will be a super fish. When we eat the super fish, we will get stronger bones, denser muscle mass, and best of all, remarkably shiny feathers.\n\nSkipper:\n\nAces, Kowalski! And here I thought you'd finally cracked.\n\n[to Rico]\n\nSkipper:\n\nKeep an eye on him. I think he's finally cracked.\n\nSkipper:\n\nStay alert, men. We might not be dealing with 115.384 otters at all. We could be dealing with one enormous mutated 1,500-pound otter.\n\nKowalski:\n\nOr we could be dealing with six fairly large, semi-mutated 250-pound otters.\n\nPrivate:\n\nOr 1,500 tiny one-pound otters. Right, Skipper?\n\nSkipper:\n\nI like where your head's at, Private.\n\nMarlene:\n\nYeah, it's so not an otter.\n\nSkipper:\n\nIs it because of how horribly mutated it is?\n\nMarlene:\n\nWhat? No! Because it's a walrus.\n\nKowalski:\n\nFor the record, is this walrus mutated in any way?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nThat was a great idea I just had. I must compliment my brain. Good idea, brain. Thanks, I think it was nice that you had an idea that you didn't pull out of your booty. Hey, do not speak ill of the booty! Oh, booty, booty, booty! Shut up about the booty! You shut up about the shutting up! Fine, then I am not talking to you! And I am not talking to you! Stupid brain.\n\nPrivate:\n\nIt started as an innocent game of minigolf. I was good. I was too good. Soon any punk who could shoot a straignt ball was aiming to shoot me down. Then came this young armadillo. He was running circles around me. So I did what I had to do. [Flashback shows Private bouncing the ball off a little girl's ice-cream cone to sink the hole] I gave up the game, forever.\n\nMarlene:\n\nSo, you gave up minigolf.\n\nPrivate:\n\nYes.\n\nKowlaski:\n\nOver an ice-cream cone.\n\nPrivate:\n\nIt was a double scoop!\n\nMarlene:\n\nCouldn't you just buy the girl another ice-cream...\n\nPrivate:\n\nIt wasn't the ice-cream, it was what the game was turning me into.\n\nPrivate:\n\nSkipper, something's wrong with the sun.\n\nSkipper:\n\nHe finally did it!\n\nPrivate:\n\nWho did what?\n\nSkipper:\n\nMy mad dolphin nemesis, Dr. Blowhole! He blew out the sun!\n\nKowalski:\n\nActually, according to my calculations, it is the rare cosmic event known as a solar eclipse.\n\nRico:\n\nHuh?\n\nSkipper:\n\nAre you sure it's not the crazed handiwork of my marine mammal foe?\n\nKowalski:\n\nIt's totally natural. The moon is between the sun and the Earth... Ooh, it's a total eclipse! Wow! Are you as totally stoked about this as I am?\n\nPrivate:\n\nSkipper, what are you doing here?\n\nSkipper:\n\nSaving you from saving me.\n\nPrivate:\n\nBut really, I don't mind having another shot. I can always... turn the other cheek. He-he!\n\nSkipper:\n\nYou'll mind if it makes you sick. Or worse.\n\nPrivate:\n\nHow worse?\n\nSkipper:\n\nYou know, the chimps didn't say. I assumed you'll grow a second head or something.\n\nPrivate:\n\nI don't want a second head!\n\nSkipper:\n\nThen hurry, man! The doc will be here any second.\n\n[Skipper tosses Private towards the window, but misses and he hits the wall; Private then climbs up to the window and turns to Skipper]\n\nPrivate:\n\nYou know, Skipper, none of us think any less of you for being afraid.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, I do. That fear almost hurt a friend. Now get out of here, soldier.\n\nMason:\n\nAh, Sunday morning.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nSunday morning? Uh-uh, no! It is still Saturday night, baby! The sky spirits told me.\n\nMason:\n\nSky spirits?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes. They give me signs because I am the king. See that cloud up there? It says to me \"party with the pansies.\"\n\nMason:\n\nChim-panzees, and we were enjoing a quiet morning, if you don't mind.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOh, I do mind, mister. That cloud up there says party time, so it's time to party, mister. Mort, crank up that conga rhythm!\n\nMason:\n\nOh, please, not conga.\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[singing] I am the Conga King / Doing the conga thing / Tail up and tail down / Grab my bottom and sing! / Let's all go conga-ga! / More fun in conga-ga! / You can't stop conga-ga! / Grab my bottom and sing!\n\nSkipper:\n\nWill she ever be the same?\n\nKowalski:\n\nPossibly, but it might take months, perhaps even years until she returns to her former self.\n\nMarlene:\n\nUm, guys? Why am I in a cage?\n\nKowalski:\n\nOr maybe we just need to bring her home.\n\nSkipper:\n\nMarlene, are you okay?\n\nMarlene:\n\nI'm in a cage, so, not okay.\n\nKowalski:\n\nYou don't remember anything that happened ouside the zoo?\n\nMarlene:\n\nNo.\n\nKowalski:\n\nSkipper, there's a scientific term for this: weird.\n\nKowalski:\n\nYou there! Have you seen this lemur and otter?\n\n[Shows a picture of Marlene and Julien]\n\nFred:\n\nWhich one of them is the otter?\n\nKowalski:\n\nThis one, obviously. Note the whiskers?\n\nFred:\n\nNo, I thought that was a cat.\n\nKowalski:\n\nDid I say \"have you seen this lemur and cat\"?\n\nFred:\n\nNo, that's why I thought it was strange that you drew a cat.\n\nKowalski:\n\nIt's not a cat.\n\nFred:\n\nThen why does it have whiskers?\n\nKowalski:\n\nYou know what? Never mind the otter.\n\nFred:\n\nCat.\n\nKowalski:\n\nWhatever! Have you seen the lemur?\n\nFred:\n\nWhat's a lemur?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI think we're done here.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nNow that you are much less growly, I accept your invitation of courtship.\n\nMarlene:\n\nWhat?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nDon't you remember being madly in love with me?\n\nMarlene:\n\nNo! Ew! Ew!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYou know what? I think you do remember, and you are playing it off. That's it, you are trying to play it off and lift yourself higher, but it is not working. See? Everyone's looking. The female of the species, any species, who is understanding them?\n\nSkipper:\n\nI hear ya, brother.\n\n[They all leave, leaving Marlene behind in the cage]\n\nMarlene:\n\nUm, guys? I thought we were getting snow cones. Guys?\n\nMort:\n\n[Pops out of briefcase] Case open! REPLACE WITH:\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWithout the electrically power, the zoo has now become... a jungle! And who is the king of the jungle?\n\n[silence]\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOkay, I'll give you a hint. He is also the king of the zoo and the outlying mid-town area. And it is me. Okay, no more hints.\n\nSkipper:\n\nNegative! There is no such thing as jungle law.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOh, really? Perhaps everyone here might want to hear the opinionings of a certified jungle lawyer.\n\nMaurice:\n\n[Wearing a tie and seating next to a briefcase, reading some papers] Ahem. All hail King Julien! Case closed.\n\nMort:\n\n[Pops out of briefcase] Case open!\n\nSkipper:\n\nAttention, panicky mob! Clearly this is phase one in the space squid invasion. I'd advise you all to keep your heads. Space squids always start with the heads.\n\nMarlene:\n\nSpace squids? Guys, I think we're just having a blackout.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat's just what the space squids want us to think, Marlene... if you truly are Marlene.\n\nMason:\n\nNo, I believe she's right. The entire city is suspiciously dark.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, I guess that's a perfectly logical explanation for... Hiyah!\n\n[Grabs Marlene by the ankles and shakes her upside down]\n\nSkipper:\n\nShow... your... tentacles... you... squid... spy!\n\nMarlene:\n\nOw! What the...! Let go!\n\nSkipper:\n\nHer story checks out.\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[Voiceover] But those baboons, they would not listen to sabotage... I mean, reason.\n\nDarla:\n\nDid you drop that fuzzy bag of stank into our habitat?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nThat is a wild accusation!\n\nDarla:\n\nY'all saying you didn't do it?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOh, no, I did it. I just think the accusation is... wild!\n\nDarla:\n\nUh-huh. Now I'm gonna say this slow, because I can tell y'all got a bad case of the stupids...\n\nKing Julien:\n\nMaurice, how did she see the royal medical report?\n\nDarla:\n\nY'all apologize for skunking us, or my gals and I are gonna make us a couple of lemur coats.\n\nMort:\n\nOoh, can I have one?\n\n[Maurice whispers in Mort's ear]\n\nMort:\n\nI cancel my order.\n\nSkipper:\n\n[starts dancing] That ain't right! Kowalski, analysis.\n\nKowalski:\n\nSkipper, you seem to be shaking your booty.\n\nPrivate:\n\nQuite impressively, I might add.\n\nRico:\n\nUh-huh!\n\nSkipper:\n\nI'm not doing this. Something's making me dance.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYou... you have my groove! It is not all bye-byed after all! Yes!\n\nSkipper:\n\nGet it outta me!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI don't know how.\n\nDarla:\n\nGuess who does.\n\nMort:\n\nIs it Santa?\n\nDarla:\n\nYea... what? No! I'm the only one who can fix this. But am I gonna?\n\nMort:\n\nSanta would.\n\nDarla:\n\nWell, I ain't Santa!\n\nPrivate:\n\nWhat if Julien apologized?\n\nDarla:\n\nThat's all I'm asking.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nHave I not made my policy on apologizing clear? It is for the weak and wrong.\n\nSkipper:\n\nListen, Ringtail. I'm about to show you how weak and wrong you are. Apologize now.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nUh-uh.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOkay then. Let's dance!\n\nAlice:\n\nThe penguin is native to Antarctica.\n\nSmart Kid:\n\nOh, oh, did you know that a group of penguins is called a rookery?\n\nAlice:\n\nIt's a bird, but it doesn't fly.\n\nSmart Kid:\n\nDid you know that penguins can swim up to fifteen miles an hour?\n\nSkipper:\n\nKeep an eye on Johnny Smart-glasses. The boy knows too much.\n\nRico:\n\n[Gets behind the kid with a baseball bat] Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter...\n\nSkipper:\n\nNot yet. I wanna see where he gets his intel.\n\nSmart Kid:\n\nDid you know the only way to tell boy penguins from girl penguins is with a DNA test?\n\nSkipper:\n\nNever mind, boys. Kid's off his wingnut. Like we need a DNA test to tell us we're 100% Antarctic macho.\n\nRico:\n\nHoo-ah!\n\nAlice:\n\nLook, kid! All I know is that we have three males and one female. The birds know which is which.\n\nRico:\n\n[Looks down at crotch] Um...\n\nKowalski:\n\n[Skipper is blindfolded and holding a pin] Take your time, Skipper. There is no right or wrong answer. [Skipper puts pin on picture in front of him and takes off blind fold; the picture has a monster truck on one side, and a pink pony on the other; the pin is on the pony] Madam?\n\nSkipper:\n\nLies! [Attacks picture]\n\nKowalski:\n\nI see we are now on stage two, anger. Next up is bargaining.\n\nSkipper:\n\nHey, Private. How about you and me exchanging test results? Come on.\n\nPrivate:\n\nI don't think that's...\n\nKowalski:\n\nDepression...\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Rolling on floor crying] My life is over! It's over! It's over, over, over!\n\nKowalski:\n\nAnd finally, acceptance.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, I guess you have to play the cards you're dealt. Rico, hit me with a pretty pink bow.\n\nMarlene:\n\nSkipper, girl stuff just means whatever you like to do. If you're into the commando stuff, being a girl doesn't change that.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOf course not. It just means now I'm not good at it. Now, hit me with some chiffon, doll face. I've got a hankering to sew me some curtains.\n\n[offstage commotion]\n\nMarlene:\n\nThat sounded like trouble. Shouldn't you go out there and do something?\n\nSkipper:\n\nLand sakes, no! That sounded dangerous. Now, how about we stay here and gossip about boys? [Marlene drags Skipper out by the bow on his head] Hey, that's no way to treat a lady!\n\nKowalski:\n\n[Looking at a zoo directory] According to this symbol, which appears to be Aztec in origin, you are here.\n\nSkipper:\n\nTell me something I don't know.\n\nKowalski:\n\nWithout muccus, your stomach would digest itself.\n\nSkipper:\n\nTell me something else I don't know. Something less... disturbing.\n\nMarlene:\n\nHey, guys.\n\nSkipper:\n\nMarlene, you really have to say something before you burst in on us like that.\n\nPrivate:\n\nLuckily you didn't set off our habitat's new security grid.\n\nKowalski:\n\nTear gas, blow darts, land mines, the whole enchilada.\n\nMarlene:\n\nIsn't that a little severe?\n\nSkipper:\n\nIs it? One of these days, you'll learn that there is only one universal language: force.\n\nKowalski:\n\nAnd math.\n\nSkipper:\n\nRight. Force and math.\n\nMarlene:\n\nMusic, also.\n\nSkipper:\n\nForce, math and music are really the only...\n\nPrivate:\n\nLaughter?\n\n[Skippers slaps Private]\n\nSkipper:\n\nThe point is, we speak fluent force around here, and we feel safer knowing that no one, and I mean no one, is getting inside our lair.\n\nPrivate:\n\nNo, you don't understand! This orca was gigantic, and it came from the sky!\n\nMaurice:\n\nA sky orca?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nA skorca! That is what the cool people will call it now, because we take two words and make them one, because it's so hip, you know. Skorca! Aaah! Who can be safe from the terror that swims the skies? No one! All who agree, vote by getting panicky... now.\n\nPrivate:\n\nBut I really did see a skorca. You've got to believe me!\n\nSkipper:\n\nAnd we wanna believe you, Private, but compare the evidence.\n\nKowalski:\n\nOn the sugary-sugar side, we have a box of empty sugar cake wrappers and your own upset tummy.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOn the skorca's side, nothing. Less than nothing. Kowalski, what's a number less than nothing?\n\nKowalski:\n\nUh... neg-finity.\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski, diagnosis.\n\nKowalski:\n\nAcute imaginosis of the frighty bone. Worse case I've ever seen.\n\nSkipper:\n\nIs there any cure?\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe effects of the sugar should wear off in less than five minutes.\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Slaps Kowalski] That's five minutes too many. Give me results.\n\nKowalski:\n\nWell, the skorca is a pretend creature. So, if we pretend to defeat it, that should cure Private's sugar-stoked fantasies.\n\nSkipper:\n\nImaginary combat. I like it. Men, iniciate Operation Scaredy-Cat, now!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWe must thank the sky spirits for providing to us this warm coziness we are now enjoying. If there's ever anything I can do, any...\n\n[Walkie-talkie hits Julien]\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Through walkie-talkie] There is something we need you to do.\n\nMaurice:\n\nYou offered.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nUh, Hi, howdy,sky spirits? I never thought you would sound like a testy penguin.\n\nSkipper:\n\nClam up and listen to me?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nA lot like a testy penguin, actually.\n\nSkipper:\n\nYour kingdom is about to blow up in one hour and 47 minutes.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOoh, a vengeful sky spirit!\n\nSkipper:\n\nIt's me, Skipper, you idi... Will you just listen to me?\n\nSkipper:\n\nListen up, Ringtail. You have one hour and twelve minutes to install that cooling device.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nIs that including lunch, coffee breaking and the royal siesta?\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski's gonna walk you through it, step by step, so you must do exactly what he says.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI am royalty! No one can tell me exactly what to do.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThen how about you order Kowalski to tell you exactly what to do?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOkay, yes. That would work.\n\nPrivate:\n\nSkipper, how cold is it?\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI'm not certain, but I'd put the over-under at 17 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n[Taps beak]\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe freezing point of snot.\n\nPrivate:\n\nI've lost all feeling in my left cheek, Skipper.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat's my cheek, Private, and it's the right one. But don't worry. This joker can't hold out much longer.\n\n[the professor turns on a space heater]\n\nSkipper:\n\nI stand corrected.\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski, analysis.\n\nKowalski:\n\nAnkle bracelets with tracking devices. They can monitor our every move.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat ain't gonna fly! No one can know our whereabouts at any time, not even us. Rico, hacksaw me!\n\n[Rico hocks out a hacksaw, Skipper catches it]\n\nPrivate:\n\nSkipper, are you going to saw off the bracelet?\n\nSkipper:\n\nBracelet? I was just going to saw off my foot. But you might have something there, Private.\n\nKowalski:\n\nWait, Skipper! Tamper-proof lining. If you cut the bracelet, it would break and set off the alarm.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, men, it looks like we've got us a waiting game.\n\nKowalski:\n\nI'm afraid we don't have time to wait, Skipper. We left the air conditioning room before I could install the cooling attachment. Without it, the heat inside the furnace will built up until...\n\nRico:\n\nKaboom!\n\nPrivate:\n\n[faints] Oh dear.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nTell me more about this \"People want to watch me\" thing.\n\nMarlene:\n\nThey get on the internet and vote for their favorite animal. You know, back in my old aquarium, I was voted most popular three years in a row.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWhich is not interesting to me because it is not about me. See how that works?\n\nMarlene:\n\nMaybe you didn't hear me.\n\n[Pulls out three trophies]\n\nMarlene:\n\nThree-time national internet popularity champion right here!\n\nKing Julien:\n\n[Seeing his reflection on one of the trophies] Ooh, I can see me, but wider. I would very much like to have it!\n\nMarlene:\n\nSince I'm no longer in competition - scandal, long story - I can help you, if you want.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nSilly otter. I do not need this thing called help.\n\nMarlene:\n\nMmm, okay. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes, yes, but I don't change my mind. I have people for that.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nMarlene, what are you doing here?\n\nMarlene:\n\nI live here?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nReally? Who knew? I didn't.\n\nMarlene:\n\nJulien, you never visit. You must really be stinking up the internet.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes... I mean, no! I could not be more popularlest. Everybody is loving the king that is me.\n\nMarlene:\n\nOkay, I'll let you get back to that.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes, I guess I really should... They hate me! They hate me! I must have the shiny trophy, and that roly-poly penguin is hogging all the glory that should be the king's! Help me! Please, please! I'll say it one more time, Please!\n\nMarlene:\n\nOkay, since you are pathetically begging.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nI'm not sure I would say pathetic.\n\nMarlene:\n\nI would.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nAll right, it's just a word. Help me now.\n\nMarlene:\n\nOkay, here's what I see. Lights, music, artsy hats, a performance that'll knock'em dead!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYes! And if they're dead, they can't vote for that ridiculous penguin.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThis madness ends now!\n\nPrivate:\n\nHello, Skipper. Care for a bite?\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe're busting you out, Private.\n\nPrivate:\n\nOh, I don't think that's possible, Skipper. Between the slipping and the falling I'm booked solid.\n\nSkipper:\n\nJust as I feared. You've been brainwashed.\n\nPrivate:\n\nI've been brainwashed?\n\nSkipper:\n\nYes, you've been brainwashed.\n\nPrivate:\n\n[droning] Brainwashed.\n\nSkipper:\n\nYou don't want your brain washed.\n\nPrivate:\n\nI don't want my brain washed.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, I hope you all learned something about not judging others. Miss Kitka is clearly a fine, non-zoo-animal-eating citizen.\n\nKitka:\n\nThat's right. I only ate one squirrel, and he wasn't even from the zoo. Oh, excuse me a sec.\n\n[She barfs up Fred the squirrel]\n\nFred:\n\nIt's a nice flight, but the snacks in there are terrible.\n\nSkipper:\n\nI think we should see other people.\n\nKowalski:\n\nAs I was saying, the culprit is...\n\nKing Julien:\n\nMe! I confess! I did it! Mort was camera-hogging all the glory, so I got rid of him! Who knew the depths of my depravity?\n\nMaurice:\n\nNo, you didn't! I was with you the whole time.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOh. Well in that case, disregard my previous apology.\n\nMort:\n\nEven though I am a ghost, I still have your feet. Yay!\n\nSkipper:\n\nMaurice, fill me in, three words or less.\n\nMaurice:\n\nWell, well I...\n\nSkipper:\n\nNo capisce. Try four words.\n\nMaurice:\n\nI don't think you...\n\nSkipper:\n\nMake it five words.\n\nMaurice:\n\nIf you would just listen...\n\nSkipper:\n\nAll right, I'll give you six words, but we're wasting valuable time here.\n\nSkipper:\n\nQuick, Marlene, describe the enemy terrain.\n\nMarlene:\n\nIt's kinda jungly. So that could be, let me think, what, South America? Africa? Asia? Maybe Australia?\n\nSkipper:\n\nYou gotta focus, Marlene! You just mentioned four of the eight continents.\n\nMaurice:\n\nUh, there are only seven continents.\n\nSkipper:\n\nI count Atlantis. Trust me, lemur, if you had my security clearance, you would too.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWhat's your sick and twisted game, Maurice?\n\nMaurice:\n\nThat's King Maurice, ruler of all I survey! Surrender to my supreme and mighty power!\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't know the meaning of the word surrender.\n\nKowalski:\n\nSurrender is a verb, Skipper. It means to give up or yield... Oh, I see. Here' I'll do it myself. [Slaps himself]\n\nMarlene:\n\nI'm just heading over the the reptile house to welcome the new neighbors. No one's seen them yet. I figure they're just shy. You want to come with?\n\nSkipper:\n\nNot without the proper recon, Marlene. We could be dead a thousand times over in that new habitat. Venemous vipers, bloodthirsty...\n\nPrivate:\n\nBadgers?\n\nSkipper:\n\nFlying piranha!\n\nMarlene:\n\nOkay, yeah. Piranha don't fly.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat's just what Manfredi and Johnson said back in Ecuador. We buried what was left of them with a teaspoon.\n\nMaurice:\n\nBut there has to be somebody for me to advise. There has to be a king!\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Puts Julien's crown on Maurice's head] Ring-a-ding-ding, you're a king.\n\nMaurice:\n\nWhat? I can't be the king! I'm just the king's right hand man. And when the right hand man becomes the man, then the king is left with no right...\n\nSkipper:\n\nListen up, lemur. Until Julien comes back, someone has to step up and take charge.\n\nMaurice:\n\nBut I...\n\nSkipper:\n\nIt's either you or Sad-eyes. [Points at Mort, who is crying and swaying until he falls over]\n\nMaurice:\n\nAll right. But Julien will always be our one and only king.\n\nRat #1:\n\nThe stories were true!\n\nRat #1:\n\nNow the lost treasure of the Golden Squirrel belongs to the rats!\n\nRat King:\n\nTotally! And this key is the key to finding it, which makes it a key both in the literal and metaphorical sense. How deep is that?\n\nSkipper:\n\nWhaever that key is, you don't get it, literally or metaphorically.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe need you to take a look at this squirrel artifact.\n\nFred:\n\nHmm. [Looks at it] Well, later, guys.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nExcuse me! What about the treasure?\n\nFred:\n\nWhat treasure?\n\nKowalski:\n\nWhat he means is can you tell us something about it.\n\nFred:\n\nOh, you said just to look at it. Tell you. That's harder.\n\nPrivate:\n\nYour Granny's a genius, Fred.\n\nFred:\n\nShe certainly is.\n\nKowalski:\n\nHow does she know so much about the treasure?\n\nFred:\n\nWait, you think she's my grandma? That's not my grandma.\n\nSkipper:\n\nShe's not?\n\nFred:\n\nNo, I told you. She's in my tree taking a nap.\n\nSkipper:\n\nFred, she hugged you.\n\nFred:\n\nWell, that did strike me as a bit odd, but what was I gonna do, say no to a hug? I love hugs.\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski, progress report.\n\nKowalski:\n\nNearing completion on escape tunnel 15, Skipper.\n\nPrivate:\n\nIsn't that being overly cautious?\n\nSkipper:\n\nEven better. It's full-blown paranoia!\n\nKowalski:\n\nNo, I mean, we already have 14 escape tunnels. Isn't that enough?\n\nSkipper:\n\nManfredi and Johnson thought so. What was left of them came back in a manila envelope.\n\nKowalski:\n\nFrom Manila, ironically.\n\nSkipper:\n\nThere's no such thing as \"too paranoid\", Private. Remember that and forget you ever heard it.\n\nPrivate:\n\nUm, I don't think that works the way you think it...\n\nSkipper:\n\nEyes on the flippers.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOkay, Kowalski, wow me.\n\nKowalski:\n\nBehold, a portal to times past. The Chronotron!\n\nSkipper:\n\nSo, it's a time machine?\n\nKowalski:\n\nWell, yes.\n\nSkipper:\n\nSo why not call it a time machine?\n\nKowalski:\n\nSure, yeah. And while we're at it, let's call the Great Wall a fence, the Mona Lisa a doodle, and Albert Einstein Mr. Smartypants. Skipper, I don't think you're seing the big picture. With the Chronotron, we will be able to visit any period in history.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOutstanding! Finally, those hippies can be stopped!\n\nKowalski:\n\n[From the future] Skipper, you've got to stop me!\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Kicks Kowalski in the face] There, you're stopped.\n\nKowalski:\n\nNot me me! That me! [points to present Kowalski]\n\nKowalski:\n\nI've got to destroy the Chronotron!\n\nSkipper:\n\nThere's two of you! You are from the future! Tell me, has the Earth become a post-apocalyptic wasteland swarming with irradiated mutants?\n\nKowalski:\n\nUh, no.\n\nSkipper:\n\n[Disappointed] Oh.\n\nSkipper:\n\nProblem solved. Now go invent something that won't destroy the world.\n\nPrivate:\n\nLike a snow cone machine.\n\nRico:\n\nSnow cone!\n\nKowalski:\n\nSnow cone, eh? [Cut to New York submerged in snow cone]\n\nSkipper:\n\nKowalski! You maniac! You did it! You finally did it!\n\nKowalski:\n\nYes, but you've got to admit, these are great snow cones.\n\nSkipper:\n\nOh, yes. Definitely worth it.\n\nSkipper:\n\nPrivate, listen to me. There's a Kowalski from the future who...\n\nPrivate:\n\nYou have a future Kowalski? I have a future Kowalski! He says the time machine must be stopped.\n\nSkipper:\n\nWell, mine says it has to be saved.\n\nPrivate:\n\nOh, dear. Which future Kowalski do we listen to?\n\nSkipper:\n\nI say... the one who lets me slap a hippie!\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat voice... That steely gaze.\n\nRockgut:\n\nYou sugar puffs gonna stand there? Spill your tater tots. Where's the red squirrel?\n\nSkipper:\n\nThe red squirrel. Then you really are... Special agent Buck Rockgut.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe Buck Rockgut?\n\nPrivate:\n\nUm, is that - is that some famous, then?\n\nPrivate:\n\nSweet ignorant Private, Buck Rockgut is our greatest american penguin hero. I've patterned my whole life after rotgut.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe bird who brought down penguin enemy number one: The red squirrel and may I say, it is honor, sir.\n\nRockgut:\n\n86 the kiss-up, fauntleroy. let's get to brass tacks. I caught the squirrel, all right, but big red broke out, disappeared in the underground. so that's what I did too. 47 years I've been down in this bunker, waiting for the red squirrel to show his fluffy tail again. 47 years.\n\nRockgut:\n\n47 years?\n\nRockgut:\n\n47 years!\n\nPrivate:\n\nDo you think the red squirrel would have shown up by now?\n\nSkipper:\n\nPrivate.\n\nRockgut:\n\nCollege boy, huh? You see that bunker door? It only open when the red squirrel returns. Is it open now, dough boy?\n\nPrivate:\n\nYes.\n\nRockgut:\n\nThen red is back and you four lollipops are gonna help me find him.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWait! This is a very serious proclamation that I am proclaming! See, it's posted right here, on the plastic volcano. And anyone who is daring to be touching my beautiful feets shall be banished from my kingdom forever!\n\nMaurice:\n\nEver... ever... ever!\n\nKing Julien:\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nMaurice:\n\nEchoing you for dramatic effect.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOh, nice. I like it.\n\nSkipper:\n\nAh, closing time. Are there two sweeter words known to man or beast?\n\nPrivate:\n\nPuppy love?\n\nRico:\n\nKa... boom?\n\nKowalski:\n\nPlutonium-fueled-DNA-mutating-abomination-monster maker.\n\nRico:\n\nHuh?\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe first word's hypenated.\n\nSkipper:\n\nYeah, yeah, all good. But the words I was thinking of were...\n\nLittle Girl:\n\nMy dolly!\n\nPrivate:\n\n[snickering] Skipper?\n\nSkipper:\n\nThat wasn't me! That was...\n\nLittle Girl:\n\nI lost my dolly!\n\nSkipper:\n\nHot-molded plastic! Dolly down! Rescue operation is a go, go, go!\n\nKowalski:\n\n[about Officer X's van] So wild. So free. But I know I can tame her!\n\nSkipper:\n\nWe'll never make it to the zoo with that steel psychomobile on our tail. Men, we've got to take that van out.\n\nKowalski:\n\n[Struggling] No! Yes. You're right. The van must... go! I need a minute.\n\nArchie:\n\n[French accent] Oh, Skipper, mon ami! What a pleasant surprise...\n\nSkipper:\n\nDon't mon ami me! You took advantage of our good nature!\n\nKowalski:\n\nNot to mention all the citizens of the zoo.\n\nArchie:\n\n[Drops accent] Look, it's not what you think...\n\nPrivate:\n\nEven your charming French accent... was a lie! How could you?\n\nArchie:\n\nYeah, about that. Well, you see... Look out! Leopard seal!\n\nSkipper:\n\nHit the dirt! [the penguins duck, as Archie runs away] Blast! He duped us.\n\nKowalski:\n\nAnd we fell for it like a couple of first-year hatchlings.\n\nPrivate:\n\nYou're a dirty, dirty liar! And your pants are on fire!\n\nRico:\n\nWhoa!\n\nPrivate:\n\nAnd - and you go jump up and touch a telephone wire! That's what a dirty liar you are!\n\nSkipper:\n\nStand down, Private. We'll take it from here.\n\nArchie:\n\nThanks. Some of those things he said were really hurtful.\n\nSkipper:\n\nMister, you're just entering a world of hurt! Kowalski, hurt options.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe Vulcan towel snap?\n\nSkipper:\n\nPossibly. Go on.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe Spanish wet willie?\n\nSkipper:\n\nIntriguing.\n\nKowalski:\n\nThe Croatian purple nurple?\n\nSkipper:\n\nBingo! Gentlemen, we have a winner. Rico, do the honors.\n\nMaurice:\n\nYou've never heard of April Fools, have you?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYeah? Well, you've never heard of... January Jerks, have you? No, you have not!\n\nMaurice:\n\nThat's because you just made it up.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nYeah, well... Okay, you got me there. I did make it up. But Christmas Steve, he's real.\n\nMort:\n\nSteve knows if you've been bad or good... and that's creepy.\n\nSkipper:\n\nRingtail! It's not April first.\n\nKing Julien:\n\nSilly penguin. It's always April first somewhere.\n\nSkipper:\n\nYou have no idea how a calendar works, do you?\n\nKing Julien:\n\nOf course. [Maurice brings him a calendar with Julien on the cover] The Julien Calendar. Gorgeous picture of me on the top, random numbers on the bottom.\n\nMort:\n\nMy favorite month is Julie-anuary.\n\nSkipper:\n\nDon't tell me you're all afraid of a little fish.\n\nKowalski:\n\nNot just any fish, Skipper. The snakehead trout. It's an invasive species that devours everything in its path, leaving nothing but despair and tragedy in its wake.\n\n[Private, Rico and Kowalski look at picture of trout and run away screaming]\n\nSkipper:\n\nIt's... a... fish! We... eat... fish!\n\nKowalski:\n\nYes! But this unholy beast flips the very order of nature.\n\nPrivate:\n\nIt's as if our dinner is having us for dinner!\n\nMason:\n\n[pulls out camcorder] Phil and I recently liberated this from Lost and Found.\n\nSkipper:\n\nVideo! I like where your head's at, simian. Simple blackmail.\n\nMason:\n\nActually, I just thought we could make a commercial to show off some of the animals at the zoo.\n\nMarlene:\n\nAnd then what? We climb a giant space ladder, hook it up to a satellite and broadcast the commerical all over the city?\n\nKowalski:\n\nMarlene, that's brilliant! You may have a future in science.\n\nMarlene:\n\nOh, really... You think?\n\nKowalski:\n\nI'ts so obvious. Why didn't I think of it? Skipper, do you mind?\n\n[Skipper slaps Kowalski]"
