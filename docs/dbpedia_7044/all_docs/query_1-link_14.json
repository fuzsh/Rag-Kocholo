Though the show has suffered a fate similar to that of Manfredi and Johnson, it lives on, through memories, reruns, and morally questionable cartoon streaming sites. Now granted the movie was… okay. It doesn’t hold a regurgitated candle to this masterpiece of a cartoon. So what are some of your favorite moments? What characters do you remember most? How awesome of a villain is Dr. Blowhole? (Okay, we all know the answer to that one) What other questions or comments can you think of to further discussion?"
