        "text": "'Penguins' is best film in 'Madagascar' franchise\n\nLet's be honest: Dreamworks has produced far better films than \"Madagascar\" and its sequels. However, the one redeeming factor in those movies are the penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private.\n\nAlthough it didn't do well at the box office (and I blame the term \"Madagascar\" being attached), \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" is flippers down the best movie in the franchise.\n\nTHE FILM\n\nTired of listening to the song \"I Like to Move It\" (aren't we all?), the penguins bail on the rest of the \"Madagascar\" crew and set out on their own. But while breaking into one of the most secure locations in America, the gang is birdnapped by a vindictive villain from the penguins' past. Now it's up to the fearless foursome to save all the penguins in zoos around the world from certain destruction.\n\nWhat sets \"Penguins\" apart from the other movies is there really is no straight man (or penguin) to speak of. All four of the lead characters are just that — characters — so we're never bogged down by some heavy plotline that seems out of place in a movie where animals talk, do karate and fly jets. The sheer ridiculousness of this movie is what makes it worth seeing more than once.\n\nYou'll also need to pop the Blu-ray in a few times to catch all of the celebrity name gags dropped by John Malkovich's character, Dave (like \"Nicolas! Cage them!\").\n\nWith a great voice cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Ken Jeong, Peter Stormare, Andy Richter and Werner Herzog, there's plenty of talent to go around.\n\nIn the end, Dreamworks finally gave us what we wanted: a movie starring just the penguins.\n\nDavid Paystrup, my fellow copy editor and writer of The Spectrum's Education Itself blog, made a good point: \"People only buy the 'Madagascar' Blu-rays for the penguins shorts anyway.\"\n\nTHE EXTRAS\n\nFor as fun and funny and rewatchable as the movie is, the extras really fall short. The majority of the so-called bonus features are just a collection of clips from the movie, sadly.\n\nTop Secret Guide to Becoming an Elite Agent\n\nIt's clips from the movie with a voiceover on, you guessed it, how to become an elite agent.\n\n'He Is Dave' music video\n\nThe theme song for the character of Dave is comprised of — you'll never guess — clips from the movie.\n\nFlipper Slap Shake Waddle and Roll\n\nMore clips from the movie. Although I did laugh at this one for its use of the sing-along technique where there is no song.\n\n'Celebrate' Music Video by Pitbull\n\nOne of only three special features that aren't comprised of clips, this music video still left much to be desired.\n\nDo The Penguin Shake With Twitch\n\nTwitch, from \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" has choreographed a dance called The Penguin Shake. He teaches you the moves and then urges you to post your dance to social media using the hashtag #PenguinShake. Apparently Dreamworks is going to put together \"the world's longest music video.\"\n\nDeleted Scene\n\nI am incredibly sad this scene, presented in its storyboard form, didn't make it into the final cut of the movie. It would have been hilarious.\n\nMadagascar Mash Up\n\nThis is a collection of clips from all the \"Madagascar\" movies. But don't worry, they're all of our penguin heroes. The interesting part of this bonus content is seeing how much the animation has evolved from the first film.\n\nGlobal Flight Plan\n\nYou guessed it. Clips.\n\nCheezy Dibbles Ad\n\nMore clips.\n\nGallery\n\nDidn't get enough clips? How about stills from the movie?\n\nThe World of Dreamworks Animation\n\nSo you've seen clip after clip after clip of \"The Penguins of Madagascar.\" Why not watch clips from other Dreamworks movies? This will give you the option to watch scenes from a variety of other movies like \"Shrek,\" \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" and \"The Croods.\"\n\nIS IT WORTH OWNING?\n\nThe bonus features on \"The Penguins\" Blu-ray are really sub par. But the movie itself is great, and it's totally worth your money.\n\nTwitter and Instagram: @MatthewJGeek; Facebook: Facebook.com/MatthewJacobsonGeek; Email: MJacobson@TheSpectrum.com.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n'Big Hero 6' on Blu-ray — you can cry in private now\n\n'Boxtrolls' earned its Academy Award nomination\n\nWatch out, Pixar!
