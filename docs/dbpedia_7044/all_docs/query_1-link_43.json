The series will then move to its regular timeslot on Saturdays at 10:00 AM (ET/PT) beginning April 4.\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar, based on the beloved penguin brothers in DreamWorks Animation's hit feature films Madagascar ($532 million worldwide gross) and Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa ($519 million worldwide as of January 2009), tells the story of a group of penguins who believes it leads an elite strike force with top-tier commando skills from its Central Park Zoo headquarters. The series is being produced at the Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, Calif.\n\n\"Our partnership with DreamWorks Animation has yielded a true gem in The Penguins of Madagascar,\" said Zarghami. \"We're excited to be bringing these characters to our audience with the same level of excellence they have come to expect from the hit Madagascar feature films.\"\n\nNickelodeon's recent \"sneak peeks\" of the new series, which premiered over Thanksgiving weekend, drew an average of 14 million viewers (persons 2+, Nov. 28-30), including 7.2 million Kids 2-11.\n\nThe series features the all-new adventures of Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private, four penguins who rule the roost at their Central Park Zoo home.

Just as the team thinks it has its urban acreage under control, a new neighbor moves in next door: Julien, a party animal and self-proclaimed \"King of the Lemurs,\" with an entourage and overactive ego. Throughout the season, new animals will be introduced as well as old friends from the \"Madagascar\" theatrical films.\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar is executive produced by Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, (Disney's Kim Possible and Hercules, Sky High) and reprises the voices of Tom McGrath as Skipper and Andy Richter (Late Night with Conan O' Brien) as Mort.
