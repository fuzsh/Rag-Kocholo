        "text": "Background\n\n20th Century Fox Television Distribution (also known as 20th Century Fox Television Distribution International Format Productions) was a secondary and international production arm of 20th Television, established in 2010. The company went dormant after NBCUniversal's acquisition of DreamWorks Animation and it was folded into 20th Television and NBCUniversal Television Distribution as part of a reorganisation.\n\n1st Logo (2010-March 3, 2011)\n\nVisuals: On a greenish blue light background, the 1994-2010 20th Century Fox structure is shown, with rings spinning around behind it. \"TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" blurs in below.\n\nVariant: On Побег, the logo is stretched.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAudio Variant: On Побег, the 1995 20th Television theme is used.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Marchlands, the first series in The Oaks Trilogy, and the final episode of the first season of Побег, the Russian adaptation of Prison Break.\n\n2nd Logo (October 9, 2012-2017)\n\nVisuals: A close-up of the familiar Fox structure, but in the style of the 2009 and 2020 theatrical logos, as is the background, is shown. The animation and design are also noticeably cheaper, and the tower is fully metallic and now reads \"20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\". The logo zooms out to the familiar distance, and when finished, the registered trademark \"®\" symbol and the News Corporation byline (before mid-to-late 2013) fade in at the same time.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Μοντέρνα Οικογένεια, a copyright stamp is placed below the logo.\n\nStarting in mid-to-late 2013, the logo became bylineless, following the News Corporation split.\n\nAn extended variant exists, where the logo begins with a similiar animation as TCF's theatrical logo. Additionally, the structure only reads \"20th CENTURY FOX\". The camera then swiftly pans right to the other side of the structure, where the stacked structure now reads \"20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\". The camera stops moving in its usual final location. The first half of the animation was spotted on two trade promos for 20th Century Fox's internal websites from 2015, seen here and here, and the second half of it was discovered on a promo for 20th Century Fox's streaming and media asset app \"FoxFast\", seen here. The full variant was spotted in in-credit form on Я отменяю смерть, the Russian adaptation of Tru Calling.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Art & State.\n\nAudio: The 2008 20th Television fanfare composed by David Newman, but the final note is higher.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Кости (the Russian adaptation of Bones) and Μοντέρνα Οικογένεια (the Greek adaptation of Modern Family), the 1995 20th Television fanfare is used.\n\nOn a print of the DreamWorks Animation short Hammy's Boomerang Adventure and also on some rare occasions, the logo is silent.\n\nOtherwise, it's the closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThis logo is seen on Lightfields, and some pre-2016 prints of DreamWorks Animation shows, such as DreamWorks Dragons and The Penguins of Madagascar.\n\nIt is also seen on TV prints of DreamWorks Animation's shorts.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of the 2016 ITV2 documentary Meet the Family Guys, following the Roughcut TV/ITV logos, a TBS on Demand print of Date Night, and some international prints of the 2013 TV movie House of Versace, respectively.\n\nLegacy: The logo has been widely criticized by many for its rushed, low-budget animation."
