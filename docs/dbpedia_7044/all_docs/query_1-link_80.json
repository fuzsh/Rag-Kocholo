        "text": "NEW DELHI: Nickelodeon is set to telecast The Penguins of Madagascar\n\nfrom 28 March onwards.\n\nThe first episode will be aired at 9.30 pm following Nickelodeon’s 22nd Annual Kids’ Choice Awards. Thereafter, the channel will telecast the series at 8 pm every Monday from 30 March onwards for two weeks. Starting from 18 April, the series will be aired every Saturday at 10 pm.\n\nSays Nickelodeon and MTVN Kids and Family Group president-animation Brown Johnson, “The Penguins are four characters on a mission without permission. Great comedy meets glorious CG- animation in this new Nick series.”\n\nThe series features new adventures of Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private, the four penguins from Madagascar, who take command at their Central Park Zoo home.\n\nThe launch of the show will be supported by TurboNick, the network’s broadband player that streams instant replays of episodes post premiere, as well as short form content.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick.com will launch The Penguins of Madagascar-themed mini site Nick.com/penguins, which will feature a personality quiz, e-cards, downloads, printables and messages boards."
