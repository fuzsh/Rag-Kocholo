        "text": "Three new releases debuted in the top three spots on the national home video sales charts for the week ending March 22, led by the 20th Century Fox-distributed “Penguins of Madagascar,” from DreamWorks Animation.\n\n“Penguins” bowed at No. 1 on both the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, Blu-ray Disc and DVD combined, and Nielsen’s dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart. The film, which earned $83.2 million in U.S. theaters, is the fourth film in the “Madagascar” franchise, which launched in 2005 and has since generated more than $2.25 billion in worldwide ticket sales.\n\nIn a tight race, another 20th Century Fox film, “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” debuted at No. 2, also on both charts. According to Nielsen data, the Biblical epic, which stars Christian Bale as Moses and took in more than $65 million at the U.S. box office, sold nearly 97% as many units its first week in stores as “Penguins” (and 85% as many Blu-ray Discs).\n\nSony Pictures’ “Annie” bowed at No. 3, again on both charts, with 72% as many discs sold as “Penguins.” The latest filmed version classic 1977 musical earned $85.9 million in theaters.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe three new releases pushed the prior week’s top seller, “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1” to No. 4 on both charts and 20th Century Fox’s “Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb” to No. 5 on First Alert and No. 6 on the Blu-ray Disc chart. Walt Disney Studios’ “Big Hero 6” snagged the No. 5 spot on the Blu-ray Disc chart, while finishing at No. 6 on First Alert.\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, “Penguins” generated 57% of its total sales from Blu-ray Disc, compared to 50% for “Exodus” and just 40% for “Annie.”\n\nOn Home Media Magazine’s rental chart for the week, “Dumb and Dumber To,” from Universal Pictures, shot to the top now that it’s month-long holdback from Netflix and Redbox is over. The previous week’s top rental, “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1” slipped to No. 2.\n\n“Annie” debuted at No. 3, while 20th Century Fox’s “Birdman,” in its first week of wide availability, soared up to No. 4.\n\nRounding out the top five was Walt Disney Studios’ “Big Hero 6,” down from No. 3 the prior week.\n\nThomas K.
