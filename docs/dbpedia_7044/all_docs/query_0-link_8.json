        "text": "Logo descriptions by Logophile, D.L. Chandell, LogosForTheWin, and WarnerFX\n\nLogo captures by EnormousRat, V of Doom, and LogosForTheWin\n\nVideo captures courtesy ofPepsi9072 and LogosForTheWin\n\nLogo description edits bymario9000seven\n\n1st Logo\n\n(February 3-March 3, 2011)\n\n<iframe align=\"bottom\" height=\"175\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/a8bc3827c92bd1ccc11bf5336bfeaabfb60767e8\" width=\"287\"></iframe>\n\nLogo: On a greenish blue light background, we see the 1994-2010 20th Century Fox structure with rings that are spinning around seen behind; \"TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" blurs in.\n\nFX/SFX: The rings spinning and the blur in of TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Marchlands, the first series in The Oaks Trilogy. It's currently unknown if this logo appeared on other shows.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(2013-2015)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/c344d3eae3472bfc36e10782943d03b0007fec18\" width=\"266\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"20th Century Tallness\", \"The Too-Tall Tower\", \"The Twentieth Tip-Over\", \"STST (Super-Tall Searchlight Tower)\"\n\nLogo: Similar to the 1995 20th Century Fox Television logo, except the structure and background are in the style of the 2009 theatrical logo, the animation and design are a lot cheaper, and the tower is all metallic and now reads \"20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\".\n\nVariants:\n\nStarting in mid-to-late 2013, the logo became bylineless, following the News Corp. split.\n\nA variant of this logo without the \"TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" text but with the same animation as TCF's theatrical logo was spotted on two trade promos for 20th Century Fox's internal websites from 2015, seen <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/129141464\" target=\"_self\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/129141465\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\n\nThere is also another version on a promo for 20th Century Fox's streaming app \"FoxFast\" also animated like the theatrical logo, this time with the \"TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" text intact, seen <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/295263919\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\n\nFX/SFX: Almost the same as the 1995 TCFTV logo. This logo was created by Art & State.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The 2008 20th Television fanfare. On Кости (the Russian adaptation of Bones), it uses the 1995 version.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Appears on Lightfields and some pre-2017 prints of DreamWorks Animation shows, such as DreamWorks Dragons and The Penguins of Madagascar.This logo makes a surprise appearance at the end of Meet the Family Guys, following the Roughcut TV/ITV logos.\n\nEditor's Note: The logo has been widely criticized for looking rushed, poorly-designed and cheaply animated."
