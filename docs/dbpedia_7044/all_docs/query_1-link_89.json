        "text": "In honor of Thanksgiving and the new move\n\nPenguins of Madagascar, I'm doling out hardy helpings\n\nof commentary about CG animated spin-offs.\n\nCheck it out on this week's episode of Angry Nerd.\n\nMm-mm, tastes like chicken.\n\nI am surprised at how thankful I am\n\nfor the Penguins of Madagascar.\n\nOkay boys, this is it.\n\nThe mission we've been preparing for our entire lives.\n\nI think this crack squad of flightless water fowl\n\nis the one delicious ingredient in the\n\notherwise unappetizing Madagascar franchise.\n\nA franchise that I will always associate\n\nwith this lazy bit of slapstick from their first film.\n\nAn elderly woman can do Kung Fu, get it?\n\n(cheering)\n\nRight in the battery.\n\nAnd a kick to the groin, too, oh, comedy gold.\n\nWatch your back, Shemp Howard.\n\nTaking advantage of a poor old helpless woman!\n\nBut I'll be there on opening day for\n\nthe Penguins spin-off movie, even though\n\nI have zero interest in Madagascar 4, due in 2018.\n\nYou know, I feel exactly the same\n\nway about the Shrek franchise.\n\nFirst movie, good.\n\nSecond movie, eh.\n\nI'm gonna just stop talking.\n\nFinally.\n\nThird movie, excruciating.\n\nOh no.\n\nAnd oh jeez, I forgot there was a fourth one.\n\nShrek, are you okay?\n\nUgh.\n\nIf you think the fourth one was\n\ndefensible, let me know in the comments.\n\nBut I thought the Shrek spin-off Puss in Boosts was a hoot.\n\nYou made the cat angry, you no want to make the cat angry.\n\nIt reminded me of why I liked\n\nthe satirical fairytale sensibility of\n\nthe original Shrek in the first place.\n\nWhy was that spin-off so much more\n\nfun than all of these sequels?\n\nI think that in the realm of blockbuster\n\nCG animated feature, where high concept is king,\n\nsequels are always tyrannized by\n\nthe template of the original film.\n\nIt's like the creators go into the sequel\n\nknowing that they have to toil and sweat\n\nto come up with some new twist\n\non the original film's premise,\n\nthat feels fresh, but doesn't stray too far\n\nfrom the established paradigm, and you can\n\ntotally tell that it feels like work to them.\n\nI think Despicable Me 2 had this problem.\n\nAnd I was underwhelmed by it.\n\nAh, pins and needles.\n\nThe only really enjoyable parts\n\nwhere the ones with the minions.\n\nRamsbottom.\n\n(snickering) Bottom.\n\n(both laughing hysterically)\n\nAnd hey presto, now there's going to\n\nbe a spin-off movie about the minions.\n\n(minions cheering)\n\nAnd once again, I am so much more excited\n\nabout that than about Despicable Me 3.\n\nSee these B storylines with supporting characters\n\nlike the minions and like the penguins and Puss in Boots,\n\nthey can feel like a blessed relief\n\nfrom uninteresting plot machinations.\n\nYou get the sense that the filmmakers were playing hooky,\n\nand actually having fun with these sequences.\n\nSpin-off movies with these side characters\n\nhave the potential to sidestep the sequel syndrome.\n\nSo, my message to the makers of every animated feature\n\nthat's currently in pre-production.\n\nYou know that secondary comic relief character\n\nthat's really starting to pop?\n\nThrow your central premise in the garbage\n\nand build a movie around that character.\n\nAlso, they're working on a fifth Ice Age movie.\n\nI don't wanna see that.\n\nI think speak for everyone in the film-going public\n\nwhen I say Blue Sky, you are not allowed to release\n\nanother entry in this franchise\n\nuntil you give us an entire feature about Scrat.\n\nWho's with me?\n\nWhat side character from an animated classic\n\nwould you like to see get their own film?\n\nLet me know in the comments.\n\nThanksgiving is the most magical time of year.\n\nI love when all of the family gathers together\n\nfor marathon viewings sessions on basic cable.\n\nLast year, it was the James Bond and\n\nthe Star Trek marathons on Sci-Fi.\n\nYou know a lot of my family hit\n\na wall and they gave out early.\n\n(tuts)\n\nYou know, take it from me, you have to\n\ntrain for a marathon all year long.\n\nWhat TV will you be watching during the holiday?\n\nLet me know in the comments,\n\nand subscribe to the Wired channel."
