        "text": "Background\n\nDreamWorks Animation Television (abbreviated as DWATV) is an American animation studio that serves as the television production arm of DreamWorks Animation, itself a subsidiary of Universal Pictures and a division of Comcast's NBCUniversal. Founded in 1996, the entity was formerly named DreamWorks Television Animation. Its first programs from the 1990s and early 2000s used the live-action television logo, and were produced by DreamWorks Television, before DWATV and its parent company were spun off into an independent company in 2004 and later purchased by NBCUniversal in 2016. In total, the division has released 56 programs, with 9 in development.\n\n1st Logo (August 31, 2004-June 29, 2016)\n\nVisuals: A shortened version of the 2004 DreamWorks Animation logo with the fishing boy above the text.\n\nVariant: On Father of the Pride, the original 2004 version was used.\n\nTechnique: CGI. Like the movie logo, this logo was animated at Pacific Data Images utilizing designs from yu+Co, using an HP workstation with custom 3D software.\n\nAudio: Only the closing theme of the show.

The logo shines diagonally from top to bottom.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Dragons: Race to the Edge and the second season of Turbo: F.A.S.T., the copyright stamp is removed as it was moved to the end credits of said shows.\n\nOn The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants and Cleopatra in Space, \"With the participation of the Province of British Columbia Production Services Tax Credit\" is displayed above the copyright notice, both in an Arial font.\n\nOn The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, both produced for Amazon Prime Video, the episode's production codes are displayed in the bottom right corner.\n\nOn Harvey Street Kids/Harvey Girls Forever!, the Harvey Comics and Classic Media copyright stamps appear.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A metallic-sounding whoosh.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn other cases, none or the end theme of the show.\n\nOn the Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia episode \"Creepslayerz\", Steve (voiced by Steven Yeun) says \"What a total ripoff.\" throughout the logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on all shows produced for Netflix such as Dragons: Race to the Edge, All Hail King Julien, The Adventures of Puss in Boots, the second season of Turbo: F.A.S.T., Team Zenko Go!, Dinotrux, Dawn of the Croods, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, and Gabby's Dollhouse, among others.\n\nAlso seen on shows produced for Amazon Prime Video, Peacock, Hulu and Apple TV+ such as Doug Unplugs, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Cleopatra in Space, Madagascar: A Little Wild, Trolls: Trollstopia, The Mighty Ones, Pinecone and Pony, The Croods: Family Tree, and Abominable and the Invisible City, among others.\n\n5th Logo (November 6, 2017)\n\nVisuals: On a white background is the 2016 DreamWorks print logo (a revised boy fishing on the moon in a blue circle, with the top of the moon extended to the edge of the circle).
