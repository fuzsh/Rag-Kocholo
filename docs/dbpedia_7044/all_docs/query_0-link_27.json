They starred in their own short film, a TV series and now those cheeky little fellows are paddling their way to the big screen. I am of course referring to Penguins of Madagascar. Dreamworks and 20th Century Fox have released the first images from the hotly anticipated spin off.\n\nSeeing the return of Skipper, Rico, Kowalski and Private with the first look at one of the films new characters. With the sneaky peeks we see our four mischievous penguins looking bemused, rowing and introducing us to new character Classified the Wolf, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. (I would have pegged him as a Fox).\n\nSo far there's no word on plot except the film will see the four featherless birds in spy territory going up against an evil Octopus voiced by John Malkovich. The cast also features the voices of The Hangover's Ken Jeong as a fellow agent.\n\nThe studios have confirmed that the film will not be related to the series but that could change. With a release date set for the end of this year, once Dreamworks have summer hit How to Train Your Dragon 2 done and dusted. Seeing as the penguins were such a joy to watch in the Madagascar films we can only hope the film will be as funny."
