John Hancock of Braintree and Mary (Hawke) Thaxter of Hingham.[1] After his father died in 1744 he lived with an uncle and aunt, Thomas Hancock and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock.\n\nHe was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University. Just ten years after graduating from college, he inherited his uncle's very lucrative business and became the richest man in America at the time.\n\nHancock despised blind authority. Those beliefs led him to use his contacts and resources in the aid of the independence of the colonies. He was often engaged in revolutionary politics, first as a financier, and later as an outspoken public critic of British rule.\n\nOn March 5, 1774, the fourth anniversary of the Boston Massacre, he gave a speech strongly condemning the British. In the same year, he was elected president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress.\n\nOn May 24, 1775, he was elected President of the Second Continental Congress. On 28 August of the same year, he married Dorothy Quincy in Fairfield, Connecticut.[2]\n\nHancock is best remembered for his large, flamboyant signature on the Declaration of Independence, so much so that the word “John Hancock” is synonymous with \"signature\".\n\nBecause of the popularity of the Hancock name, many people claim to be direct descendants. However, Mr. Hancock and his wife only had two children, neither of whom lived to see their teenage years. Lydia Henchman Hancock died an infant and John George Washington Hancock died at age 9 — he fell through the ice while skating in a pond in Massachusetts.\n\nLegacy\n\nTen US states have counties named in John Hancock's honor. They are: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia.\n\nSlaves\n\nJohn Hancock is recorded in the report as owning five individuals with documented dates of ownership.\n\nCato Hancock (abt.1747-1817)[3] [4] Cato first appears in the 1764 will of Thomas Hancock (1703-1764), John’s uncle and guardian. Thomas Hancock was also a benefactor of Harvard College, leaving £1000 in his will to fund the Hancock Professorship of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages.[5] The will stipulates that Cato should be manumitted when he turns 30. Cato also appeared in Lydia Hancock’s 1777 will in which she stipulates that he should receive 6 pounds, 13 shillings, and 4 pence from her estate “at the time he shall become free by my late husband’s will.” [6] As John and Lydia Hancock shared a home, Cato and the other enslaved people named in Lydia Hancock’s will lived in John Hancock’s house up to the time of her death. https://archive.org/details/manifestochurchr00chu/page/184/mode/1up\n\nFrank (1768-1771)[6][3]\n\nAgnes (1777)[4][6]\n\nViolet (1777)[4][6]\n\nHannibal (1777).[4][6]\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Massachusetts Births and Christenings, 1639-1915\", , FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FZD3-VP6 : 15 January 2020), John Hancock, 1736.\n\n↑ Child, Frank Samuel.
