        "text": "Description\n\nNathaniel Gorham was a representative from Massachusetts and a signatory on the U.S. Constitution. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress and served as chairman for several months in 1786 after John Hancock resigned. He frequently served as chairman of the Committee of the Whole. Prior to politics he was a successful merchant. From 1788-1790 he was involved in a major land speculation deal using Native American lands.\n\nThis Nathaniel Gorham mug is part of our US Constitution series profiling the 39 signatories of the US Constitution. The U.S. Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, presided over by George Washington. Six of these men also signed the Declaration of Independence: George Clymer, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, George Read, Roger Sherman, and James Wilson.\n\nThe biographical History Mugs were created to teach and inspire individuals to learn about our diverse and interesting history. The biographies were researched and written by history enthusiast, Robert Compton. He colorized most of the historic photos and images used on the mugs, which were originally black and white or sepia-tone. The images and biographies are imprinted on mugs at his studio in rural Vermont."
