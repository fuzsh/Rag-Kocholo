        "text": "The Framers of the Constitution\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam Pierce, of Georgia, spoke very little at the Constitutional\n\nConvention, but his contributions to what we know of the other delegates to the\n\nConvention are invaluable. He wrote short character sketches of each of the\n\ndelegates; he himself had to leave the Convention early for business reasons.\n\nHe died two years later; his sketches were published in the Savannah Georgian\n\nin 1828. Pierce wrote his sketches in order of state; they are reproduced here\n\nin alphabetical order. The Library of\n\nCongress has the sketches\n\nin their original order as reported in Farrand’s Records,\n\nVolume 3. Note that Pierce misspelled some names – these misspellings are\n\nretained here.\n\nThis site also has a page with basic demographic data about each of the Framers.\n\nIn addition to Pierce’s sketches, the reader may wish to refer to the brief\n\nbiographies (most with accompanying reproductions of portraits painted of the\n\nbiographee) that can be found on the Founding\n\nFathers Page on the NARA Web site. NARA also has a page with provides an\n\nOverview\n\nof the entire body of delegates. The Colonial Hall Site also has biographies\n\nof many of the founding fathers.\n\nWilliam Pierce My own character I shall not attempt to\n\ndraw, but leave those who may chose to speculate on it, to consider it in any\n\nlight that their fancy or imagination may depict. I am conscious of having\n\ndischarged my duty as a Soldier through the course of the late revolution with\n\nhonor and propriety; and my services in Congress and the Convention were\n\nbestowed with the best intention towards the interest of Georgia, and towards\n\nthe general welfare of the Confederacy. I possess ambition, and it was that,\n\nand the flattering opinion which some of my Friends had of me, that gave me a\n\nseat in the wisest Council in the World, and furnished me with an opportunity\n\nof giving these short Sketches of the Characters who composed it.\n\nAbraham Baldwin Mr. Baldwin is a Gentleman of superior\n\nabilities, and joins in a public debate with great art and eloquence. Having\n\nlaid the foundation of a compleat classical education at Harvard College, he\n\npursues every other study with ease. Mr. Baldwin is about 38 years of age.\n\nRichard Bassett Mr. Bassett is a religious enthusiast,\n\nlately turned Methodist, and serves his Country because it is the will of the\n\npeople that he should do so. He is a Man of plain sense, and has modesty enough\n\nto hold his Tongue. He is a Gentlemanly Man, and is in high estimation among\n\nthe Methodists. Mr. Bassett is about 36 years old.\n\nGunning Bedford Mr. Bedford was educated for the Bar, and\n\nin his profession, I am told, has merit. He is a bold and nervous Speaker, and\n\nhas a very commanding and striking manner; -but he is warm and impetuous in his\n\ntemper, and precipitate in his judgment. Mr. Bedford is about 32 years old, and\n\nvery corpulant.\n\nJohn Blair Mr. Blair is one of the most respectable Men in\n\nVirginia, both on account of his Family as well as fortune. He is one of the\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court in Virginia, and acknowledged to have a very\n\nextensive knowledge of the Laws. Mr. Blair is, however, no Orator, but his good\n\nsense, and most excellent principles, compensate for other deficiencies. He is\n\nabout 50 years of age.\n\nWilliam Blount Mr. Blount is a character strongly marked\n\nfor integrity and honor. He has been twice a Member of Congress, and in that\n\noffice discharged his duty with ability and faithfulness. He is no Speaker, nor\n\ndoes he possess any of those talents that make Men shine; -he is plain, honest,\n\nand sincere. Mr. Blount is about 36 years of age.\n\nDavid Brearly Mr. Brearly is a man of good, rather than of\n\nbrilliant parts. He is a Judge of the Supreme Court of New Jersey and is very\n\nmuch in the esteem of the people. As an Orator he has little to boast of, but\n\nas a Man he has every virtue to recommend him. Mr. Brearly is about 40 years of\n\nage.\n\nJacob Broom Mr. Broom is a plain good Man, with some\n\nabilities but nothing to render him conspicuous. He is silent in public, but\n\nchearful and conversable in private. He is about 35 years old.\n\nPierce Butler Mr. Butler is a character much respected for\n\nthe many excellent virtues which he possesses. But as a politician or an\n\nOrator, he has no pretentions to either. He is a Gentleman of fortune, and\n\ntakes rank among the first in South Carolina. He has been appointed to\n\nCongress, and is now a Member of the Legislature of South Carolina. Mr. Butler\n\nis about 40 years of age; an Irishman by birth.\n\nDaniel Carroll Mr. Carroll is a Man of large fortune, and\n\ninfluence in his State. He possesses plain good sense, and is in the full\n\nconfidence of his Countrymen. This Gentleman is about [blank] years of age.\n\nGeorge Clymer Mr. Clymer is a Lawyer of some abilities; -he\n\nis a respectable man, and much esteemed. Mr. Clymer is about 40 years old.\n\nWilliam Richardson Davie Mr. Davey is a Lawyer of some\n\neminence in his State. He is said to have a good classical education, and is a\n\nGentleman of considerable literary talents. He was silent in the Convention,\n\nbut his opinion was always respected. Mr. Davey is about 30 years of age.\n\nJonathan Dayton Capt. Dayton is a young Gentleman of\n\ntalents, with an ambition to exert them. He possesses a good education and\n\nreading; he speaks well, and seems desirous of improving himself in Oratory.\n\nThere is an impetuosity in his temper that is injurious to him; but there is an\n\nhonest rectitude about him that makes him a valuable Member of Society, and\n\nsecures to him the esteem of all good Men. He is about 30 years old, served\n\nwith me as a Brother Aid to General Sullivan in the Western expedition of\n\n’79.\n\nJohn Dickinson Mr. Dickinson has been famed through all\n\nAmerica, for his Farmers Letters; he is a Scholar, and said to be a Man of very\n\nextensive information. When I saw him in the Convention I was induced to pay\n\nthe greatest attention to him whenever he spoke. I had often heard that he was\n\na great Orator, but I found him an indifferent Speaker. With an affected air of\n\nwisdom he labors to produce a trifle, -his language is irregular and incorrect,\n\n-his flourishes (for he sometimes attempts them), are like expiring flames,\n\nthey just shew themselves and go out; -no traces of them are left on the mind\n\nto clear or animate it. He is, however, a good writer and will ever be\n\nconsidered one of the most important characters in the United States. He is\n\nabout 55 years old, and was bred a Quaker.\n\nOliver Ellsworth Mr. Elsworth is a Judge of the Supreme\n\nCourt in Connecticut, -he is a Gentleman of a clear, deep, and copious\n\nunderstanding; eloquent, and connected in public debate; and always attentive\n\nto his duty. He is very happy in a reply, and choice in selecting such parts of\n\nhis adversary’s arguments as he finds make the strongest impressions, -in order\n\nto take off the force of them, so as to admit the power of his own. Mr.\n\nElsworth is about 37 years of age, a Man much respected for his integrity, and\n\nvenerated for his abilities.\n\nWilliam Few Mr. Few possesses a strong natural Genius, and\n\nfrom application has acquired some knowledge of legal matters; -he practices at\n\nthe bar of Georgia, and speaks tolerably well in the Legislature. He has been\n\ntwice a Member of Congress, and served in that capacity with fidelity to his\n\nState, and honor to himself. Mr. Few is about 35 years of age.\n\nThomas Fitzsimmons Mr. Fitzsimmons is a Merchant of\n\nconsiderable talents, and speaks very well I am told, in the Legislature of\n\nPennsylvania. He is about 40 years old.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Dr. Franklin is well known to be the\n\ngreatest phylosopher of the present age;-all the operation of nature he seems\n\nto understand – the very heavens obey him, and the Clouds yield up their\n\nLightning to be imprisoned in his rod. But what claim he has to the politician,\n\nposterity must determine. It is certain that he does not shine much in public\n\nCouncil, -he is no Speaker, nor does he seem to let politics engage his\n\nattention. He is, however, a most extraordinary Man, and tells a story in a\n\nstyle more engaging than anything I ever heard. Let his Biographer finish his\n\ncharacter. He is 82 years old, and possesses an activity of mind equal to a\n\nyouth of 25 years of age.\n\nElbridge Gerry Mr. Gerry’s character is marked for\n\nintegrity and perseverance. He is a hesitating and laborious speaker;\n\n-possesses a great degree of confidence and goes extensively into all subjects\n\nthat he speaks on, without respect to elegance or flower of diction. He is\n\nconnected and sometimes clear in his arguments, conceives well, and cherishes\n\nas his first virtue, a love for his Country. Mr. Gerry is very much of a\n\nGentleman in his principles and manners; -he has been engaged in the mercantile\n\nline and is a Man of property. He is about 37 years of age.\n\nNicholas Gilman Mr. Gilman is modest, genteel, and\n\nsensible. There is nothing brilliant or striking in his character, but there is\n\nsomething respectable and worthy in the Man. — about 30 years of age.\n\nFrom Massachusetts.\n\nNathaniel Gorham Mr. Gorham is a Merchant in Boston, high\n\nin reputation, and much in the esteem of his Country-men. He is a Man of very\n\ngood sense, but not much improved in his education. He is eloquent and easy in\n\npublic debate, but has nothing fashionable or elegant in his style; -all he\n\naims at is to convince, and where he fails it never is from his auditors not\n\nunderstanding him, for no Man is more perspicuous and full. He has been\n\nPresident of Congress, and three years a Member of that Body. Mr. Gorham is\n\nabout 46 years of age, rather lusty, and has an agreeable and pleasing\n\nmanner.\n\nAlexander Hamilton Colo. Hamilton is deservedly celebrated\n\nfor his talents. He is a practitioner of the Law, and reputed to be a finished\n\nScholar. To a clear and strong judgment he unites the ornaments of fancy, and\n\nwhilst he is able, convincing, and engaging in his eloquence the Heart and Head\n\nsympathize in approving him. Yet there is something too feeble in his voice to\n\nbe equal to the strains of oratory; -it is my opinion that he is rather a\n\nconvincing Speaker, than a blazing Orator. Colo. Hamilton requires time to\n\nthink, -he enquires into every part of his subject with the searchings of\n\nphilosophy, and when he comes forward he comes highly charged with interesting\n\nmatter, there is no skimming over the surface of a subject with him, he must\n\nsink to the bottom to see what foundation it rests on. -His language is not\n\nalways equal, sometimes didactic like Bolingbroke’s and at others light and\n\ntripping like Stern’s. His eloquence is not so defusive as to trifle with the\n\nsenses, but he rambles just enough to strike and keep up the attention. He is\n\nabout 33 years old, of small stature, and lean. His manners are tinctured with\n\nstiffness, and sometimes with a degree of vanity that is highly\n\ndisagreeable.\n\nWilliam Churchill Houston Mr. Houston is an Attorney at\n\nLaw, and has been a Member of Congress for the State of Georgia. He is a\n\nGentleman of Family, and was educated in England. As to his legal or political\n\nknowledge he has very little to boast of. Nature seems to have done more for\n\nhis corporeal than mental powers. His Person is striking, but his mind very\n\nlittle improved with useful or elegant knowledge. He has none of the talents\n\nrequisite for the Orator, but in public debate is confused and irregular. Mr.\n\nHouston is about 30 years of age of an amiable and sweet temper, and of good\n\nand honorable principles.\n\nJared Ingersoll Mr. Ingersoll is a very able Attorney, and\n\npossesses a clear legal understanding. He is well educated in the Classic’s,\n\nand is a Man of very extensive reading. Mr. Ingersol speaks well, and\n\ncomprehends his subject fully. There is a modesty in his character that keeps\n\nhim back. He is about 36 years old.\n\nDaniel Jenifer of St Thomas Mr. Jenifer is a Gentleman of\n\nfortune in Maryland; -he is always in good humour, and never fails to make his\n\ncompany pleased with him. He sits silent in the Senate, and seems to be\n\nconscious that he is no politcian. From his long continuance in single life, no\n\ndoubt but he has made the vow of celibacy. He speaks warmly of the Ladies\n\nnotwithstanding. Mr. Jenifer is about 55 years of Age, and once served as an\n\nAid de Camp to Major Genl. Lee.\n\nWilliam Samuel Johnson Dr. Johnson is a character much\n\ncelebrated for his legal knowledge; he is said to be one of the first classics\n\nin America, and certainly possesses a very strong and enlightened\n\nunderstanding. As an Orator in my opinion, there is nothing in him that\n\nwarrants the high reputation which he has for public speaking. There is\n\nsomething in the tone of his voice not pleasing to the Ear, – but he is\n\neloquent and clear, – always abounding with information and instruction. He was\n\nonce employed as an Agent for the State of Connecticut to state her claims to\n\ncertain landed territory before the British House of Commons; this Office he\n\ndischarged with so much dignity, and made such an ingenious display of his\n\npowers, that he laid the foundation of a reputation which will probably last\n\nmuch longer than his own life. Dr. Johnson is about sixty years of age,\n\npossesses the manners of a Gentleman, and engages the Hearts of Men by the\n\nsweetness of his temper, and that affectionate style of address with which he\n\naccosts his acquaintance.\n\nRufus King Mr. King is a Man much distinguished for his\n\neloquence and great parliamentary talents. He was educated in Massachusetts,\n\nand is said to have good classical as well as legal knowledge. He has served\n\nfor three years in the Congress of the United States with great and deserved\n\napplause, and is at this time high in the confidence and approbation of his\n\nCountry-men. This Gentleman is about thirty-three years of age, about five feet\n\nten Inches high, well formed, an handsome face, with a strong expressive Eye,\n\nand a sweet high toned voice. In his public speaking there is something\n\npeculiarly strong and rich in his expression, clear and convincing in his\n\narguments, rapid and irresistible at times in his eloquence but he is not\n\nalways equal. His action is natural, swimming, and graceful, but there is a\n\nrudeness of manner sometimes accompanying it. But take him tout en semble, he\n\nmay with propriety be ranked among the Luminaries of the present Age.\n\nJohn Langdon Mr. Langdon is a Man of considerable fortune,\n\npossesses a liberal mind, and a good plain understanding. — about 40 years\n\nold.\n\nJohn Lansing Mr. Lansing is a practising Attorney at\n\nAlbany, and Mayor of that Corporation. He has a hesitation in his speech, that\n\nwill prevent his being an Orator of any eminence; -his legal knowledge I am\n\ntold is not extensive, nor his education a good one. He is however a Man of\n\ngood sense, plain in his manners, and sincere in his friendships. He is about\n\n32 years of age.\n\nWilliam Livingston Governor Livingston is confessedly a Man\n\nof the first rate talents, but he appears to me rather to indulge a\n\nsportiveness of wit, than a strength of thinking. He is however equal to\n\nanything, from the extensiveness of his education and genius. His writings teem\n\nwith satyr and a neatness of style. But he is no Orator, and seems little\n\nacquainted with the guiles of policy. He is about 60 years old, and remarkably\n\nhealthy.\n\nJames Madison Mr. Maddison is a character who has long been\n\nin public life; and what is very remarkable every Person seems to acknowledge\n\nhis greatness. He blends together the profound politician, with the Scholar. In\n\nthe management of every great question he evidently took the lead in the\n\nConvention, and tho’ he cannot be called an Orator, he is a most agreeable,\n\neloquent, and convincing Speaker. From a spirit of industry and application\n\nwhich he possesses in a most eminent degree, he always comes forward the best\n\ninformed Man of any point in debate. The affairs of the United States, he\n\nperhaps, has the most correct knowledge of, of any Man in the Union. He has\n\nbeen twice a Member of Congress, and was always thought one of the ablest\n\nMembers that ever sat in that Council. Mr. Maddison is about 37 years of age, a\n\nGentleman of great modesty, — with a remarkable sweet temper. He is easy\n\nand unreserved among his acquaintance, and has a most agreable style of\n\nconversation.\n\nAlexander Martin Mr. Martin was lately Governor of North\n\nCarolina, which office he filled with credit. He is a Man of sense, and\n\nundoubtedly is a good politician, but he is not formed to shine in public\n\ndebate, being no Speaker. Mr. Martin was once a Colonel in the American Army,\n\nbut proved unfit for the field. He is about 40 years of age.\n\nLuther Martin Mr. Martin was educated for the Bar, and is\n\nAttorney general for the State of Maryland. This Gentleman possesses a good\n\ndeal of information, but he has a very bad delivery, and so extremely prolix,\n\nthat he never speaks without tiring the patience of all who hear him. He is\n\nabout 34 years of age.\n\nGeorge Mason Mr. Mason is a Gentleman of remarkable strong\n\npowers, and possesses a clear and copious understanding. He is able and\n\nconvincing in debate, steady and firm in his principles, and undoubtedly one of\n\nthe best politicians in America. Mr. Mason is about 60 years old, with a fine\n\nstrong constitution.\n\nJames McClurg Mr. Mc.Lurg is a learned physician, but\n\nhaving never appeared before in public life his character as a politician is\n\nnot sufficiently known. He attempted once or twice to speak, but with no great\n\nsuccess. It is certain that he has a foundation of learning, on which, if he\n\npleases, he may erect a character of high renown. The Doctor is about 38 years\n\nof age, a Gentleman of great respectability, and of a fair and unblemished\n\ncharacter.\n\nJames McHenry Mr. Mc.Henry was bred a physician, but he\n\nafterwards turned Soldier and acted as Aid to Genl. Washington and the Marquis\n\nde la Fayette. He is a Man of specious Wents, with nothing of genious to\n\nimprove them. As a politician there is nothing remarkable in him, nor has he\n\nany of the graces of the Orator. He is however, a very respectable young\n\nGentleman, and deserves the honor which his Country has bestowed on him. Mr.\n\nMc.Henry is about 32 years of age.\n\nThomas Mifflin General Mifflin is well known for the\n\nactivity of his mind, and the brilliancy of his parts. He is well informed and\n\na graceful Speaker. The General is about 40 years of age, and a very handsome\n\nman.\n\nGouverneur Morris Mr. Governeur Morris is one of those\n\nGenius’s in whom every species of talents combine to render him conspicuous and\n\nflourishing in public debate: -He winds through all the mazes of rhetoric, and\n\nthrows around him such a glare that he charms, captivates, and leads away the\n\nsenses of all who hear him. With an infinite stretch of fancy he brings to view\n\nthings when he is engaged in deep argumentation, that render all the labor of\n\nreasoning easy and pleasing. But with all these powers he is fickle and\n\ninconstant, -never pursuing one train of thinking – nor ever regular. He has\n\ngone through a very extensive course of reading, and is acquainted with all the\n\nsciences. No Man has more wit, -nor can any one engage the attention more than\n\nMr. Morris. He was bred to the Law, but I am told he disliked the profession,\n\nand turned merchant. He is engaged in some great mercantile matters with his\n\nnamesake Mr. Robt. Morris. This Gentleman is about 38 years old, he has been\n\nunfortunate in losing one of his Legs, and getting all the flesh taken off his\n\nright arm by a scald, when a youth.\n\nRobert Morris Robert Morris is a merchant of great eminence\n\nand wealth; an able Financier, and a worthy Patriot. He has an understanding\n\nequal to any public object, and possesses an energy of mind that few Men can\n\nboast of. Although he is not learned, yet he is as great as those who are. I am\n\ntold that when he speaks in the Assembly of Pennsylvania, that he bears down\n\nall before him. What could have been his reason for not Speaking in the\n\nConvention I know not – but he never once spoke on any point. This Gentleman is\n\nabout 50 years old.\n\nWilliam Paterson Mr. Patterson is one of those kind of Men\n\nwhose powers break in upon you, and create wonder and astonishment. He is a Man\n\nof great modesty, with looks that bespeak talents of no great extent-but he is\n\na Classic, a Lawyer, and an Orator; -and of a disposition so favorable to his\n\nadvancement that every one seemed ready to exalt him with their praises. He is\n\nvery happy in the choice of time and manner of engaging in a debate, and never\n\nspeaks but when he understands his subject well. This Gentleman is about 34 ys.\n\nof age, of a very low stature.\n\nCharles Pinckney Mr. Charles Pinckney is a young Gentleman\n\nof the most promising talents. He is, altho’ only 24 ys. of age, in possession\n\nof a very great variety of knowledge. Government, Law, History and Phylosophy\n\nare his favorite studies, but he is intimately acquainted with every species of\n\npolite learning, and has a spirit of application and industry beyond most Men.\n\nHe speaks with great neatness and perspicuity, and treats every subject as\n\nfully, without running into prolixity, as it requires. He has been a Member of\n\nCongress, and served in that Body with ability and eclat.\n\nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney Mr. Chs Cotesworth Pinckney is\n\na Gentleman of Family and fortune in his own State. He has received the\n\nadvantage of a liberal education, and possesses a very extensive degree of\n\nlegal knowledge. When warm in a debate he sometimes speaks well, -but he is\n\ngenerally considered an indifferent Orator. Mr. Pinckney was an Officer of high\n\nrank in the American army, and served with great reputation through the War. He\n\nis now about 40 years of age.\n\nEdmund Randolph Mr. Randolph is Governor of Virginia, -a\n\nyoung Gentleman in whom unite all the accomplishments of the Scholar, and the\n\nStates-man. He came forward with the postulate, or first principles, on which\n\nthe Convention acted, and he supported them with a force of eloquence and\n\nreasoning that did him great honor. He has a most harmonious voice, a fine\n\nperson and striking manner. Mr. Randolph is about 32 years of age.\n\nGeorge Read Mr. Read is a Lawyer and a Judge: -his legal\n\nabilities are said to be very great, but his powers of Oratory are fatiguing\n\nand tiresome to the last degree; -his voice is feeble, and his articulation so\n\nbad that few can have patience to attend to him. He is a very good Man, and\n\nbears an amiable character with those who know him. Mr. Read is about 50, of a\n\nlow stature, and a weak constitution.\n\nJohn Rutledge Mr. Rutledge is one of those characters who\n\nwas highly mounted at the commencement of the late revolution; -his reputation\n\nin the first Congress gave him a distinguished rank among the American\n\nWorthies. He was bred to the Law, and now acts as one of the Chancellors of\n\nSouth Carolina. This Gentleman is much famed in his own State as an Orator, but\n\nin my opinion he is too rapid in his public speaking to be denominated an\n\nagreeable Orator. He is undoubtedly a man of abilities, and a Gentleman of\n\ndistinction and fortune. Mr. Rutledge was once Governor of South Carolina. He\n\nis about 48 years of age.\n\nRoger Sherman Mr. Sherman exhibits the oddest shaped\n\ncharacter I ever remember to have met with. He is awkward, unmeaning, and\n\nunaccountably strange in his manner. But in his train of thinking there is\n\nsomething regular, deep and comprehensive; yet the oddity of his address, the\n\nvulgarisms that accompany his public speaking, and that strange New England\n\ncant which runs through his public as well as his private speaking make\n\neverything that is connected with him grotesque and laughable: -and yet he\n\ndeserves infinite praise -no Man has a better Heart or a clearer Head. If he\n\ncannot embellish he can furnish thoughts that are wise and useful. He is an\n\nable politician, and extremely artful in accomplishing any particular object;\n\n-it is remarked that he seldom fails. I am told he sits on the Bench in\n\nConnecticut, and is very correct in the discharge of his Judicial functions. In\n\nthe early part of his life he was a Shoe-maker; -but despising the lowness of\n\nhis condition, he turned Almanack maker, and so progressed upwards to a Judge.\n\nHe has been several years a Member of Congress, and discharged the duties of\n\nOffice with honor and credit to himself, and advantage to the State he\n\nrepresented. He is about 60.\n\nRichard Dobbs Spaight Mr. Spaight is a worthy Man, of some\n\nabilities, and fortune: Without possessing a Genius to render him brilliant, he\n\nis able to discharge any public trust that his Country may repose in him. He is\n\nabout 31 years of age.\n\nCaleb Strong Mr. Strong is a lawyer of some eminence, -he\n\nhas received a liberal education, and has good connections to recommend him. As\n\na Speaker he is feeble, and without confidence. This Gentn. is about thirty\n\nfive years of age, and greatly in the esteem of his Colleagues.\n\nGeorge Washington Genl. Washington is well known as the\n\nCommander in chief of the late American Army. Having conducted these states to\n\nindependence and peace, he now appears to assist in framing a Government to\n\nmake the People happy. Like Gustavus Vasa, he may be said to be the deliverer\n\nof his Country; -like Peter the Great he appears as the politician and the\n\nStates-man; and like Cincinnatus he returned to his farm perfectly contented\n\nwith being only a plain Citizen, after enjoying the highest honor of the\n\nConfederacy, -and now only seeks for the approbation of his Country-men by\n\nbeing virtuous and useful. The General was conducted to the Chair as President\n\nof the Convention by the unanimous voice of its Members. He is in the 52d. year\n\nof his age.\n\nHugh Williamson Mr. Williamson is a Gentleman of education\n\nand talents. He enters freely into public debate from his close attention to\n\nmost subjects, but he is no Orator. There is a great degree of good humour and\n\npleasantry in his character; and in his manners there is a strong trait of the\n\nGentleman. He is about 48 years of age.\n\nJames Wilson Mr. Wilson ranks among the foremost in legal\n\nand political knowledge. He has joined to a fine genius all that can set him\n\noff and show him to advantage. He is well acquainted with Man, and understands\n\nall the passions that influence him. Government seems to have been his peculiar\n\nStudy, all the political institutions of the World he knows in detail, and can\n\ntrace the causes and effects of every revolution from the earliest stages of\n\nthe Greecian connnonwealth down to the present time. No man is more clear,\n\ncopious, and comprehensive than Mr. Wilson, yet he is no great Orator. He draws\n\nthe attention not by the charm of his eloquence, but by the force of his\n\nreasoning. He is about 45 years old.\n\nGeorge Wythe Mr. Wythe is the famous Professor of Law at\n\nthe University of William and Mary. He is confessedly one of the most learned\n\nlegal Characters of the present age. From his close attention to the study of\n\ngeneral learning he has acquired a compleat knowledge of the dead languages and\n\nall the sciences. He is remarked for his exemplary life, and universally\n\nesteemed for his good principles. No Man it is said understands the history of\n\nGovernment better than Mr. Wythe, -nor any one who understands the fluctuating\n\nconditions to which all societies are liable better than he does, yet from his\n\ntoo favorable opinion of Men, he is no great politician. He is a neat and\n\npleasing Speaker, and a most correct and able Writer. Mr. Wythe is about 55\n\nyears of age."
