        "text": "<strong>Nathaniel</strong> <strong>Gorham</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Family</strong> <strong>History</strong> <strong>Ralph</strong> <strong>Gorham</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Benefield</strong>, Northamptonshire, immigrated to America on the ship Phillip in 1635, accompanied by his son John <strong>Gorham</strong>, then about fifteen years old, baptized in <strong>Benefield</strong> in January 1620. Settling in Plymouth Colony, <strong>Ralph</strong> <strong>Gorham</strong> pursued his pr<strong>of</strong>ession as a joiner. His son John 1 <strong>Gorham</strong> married in about 1643, Desire Howland, daughter <strong>of</strong> John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley, both Mayflower passengers. John <strong>Gorham</strong> lived in Plymouth, Marshfield, Yarmouth, and finally Barnstable, Massachusetts, where he owned a grist mill and tannery; he was a Captain in the Militia in King Philip’s War and fought at Narragansett in December 1675, when he was wounded “by having his powder horn shot and split against his side”; he died <strong>of</strong> the resulting fever, and was buried at Swansea, Massachusetts, 5FEB1676/7. His widow Desire (Howland) <strong>Gorham</strong>, survived him by five years, and her mother, Elizabeth Tilley <strong>of</strong> the Mayflower, lived until 1686. John <strong>Gorham</strong> and Desire Howland had five sons and six daughters. Their youngest child, Shubael 2 <strong>Gorham</strong>, was born in Barnstable in 1667, and married on the Island <strong>of</strong> Nantucket in May 1695, Puella Hussey, daughter <strong>of</strong> Stephen Hussey and Martha Bunker, <strong>of</strong> Nantucket. Shubael was a minor when his father died, and he received £50 from his father’s estate to be “educated in a learned pr<strong>of</strong>ession”, but he preferred to be a carpenter. When he and his wedding party sailed to Nantucket, they were taken prisoner by a French ship from Port Royal and relieved <strong>of</strong> their valuables, but released unharmed. He settled his wife at South Sea in Barnstable County and built a tavern near Hyannis Port, where they had two sons and seven daughters. Their youngest son Daniel <strong>Gorham</strong> died <strong>of</strong> smallpox in London, England in 1745, leaving his brother and sisters an estate <strong>of</strong> £960. Shubael <strong>Gorham</strong> died in 1750, leaving his substantial real estate to his surviving son George. George 3 <strong>Gorham</strong>, born 1696, was married by a Church <strong>of</strong> England minister in New Rochelle, New York in July 1726 to Hannah Banks, daughter <strong>of</strong> Joseph Banks and Hannah Purdy. George was a merchant and sea captain, licensed in 1727 to sail his sloop Hannah between New London CT, Boston, London England, and the West Indies; he owned several grist mills and was a town <strong>of</strong>ficial <strong>of</strong> Stamford and Darien, CT. George <strong>Gorham</strong> and Hannah Banks had five sons and eight daughters. Their firstborn, Shubael 4 <strong>Gorham</strong>, was born in Greenwich, CT April 1727, and married in Stamford, CT August 1748, Mary Selleck, daughter <strong>of</strong> <strong>Nathaniel</strong> Selleck and Mary DeMille; he died about 1771 when many <strong>of</strong> his children were still young. His widow Mary (Selleck) <strong>Gorham</strong> married 2 nd Eliakim Whitney, widowed father <strong>of</strong> her daughter-in-law Mary (Whitney) <strong>Gorham</strong>, and moved with her youngest children to Ball Town, Albany County, N.Y. Shubael <strong>Gorham</strong> and Mary Selleck had six sons and three daughters. Three sons sided with the British in the Revolutionary War: <strong>Nathaniel</strong>, Samuel, and John, who served as an Ensign in the Royal Fencible Americans."
