        "text": "Nathaniel Gorham 8th President of the United States, Signer of the US Constitution - A Stan Klos Biography\n\nNathaniel Gorham8th President of the United States\n\nin Congress Assembled\n\nJune 1786 - November 13, 1786\n\nGORHAM, Nathaniel, statesman, born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, 27 May, 1738; died there, 11 June, 1796. He was the son of a small boat operator from a family of modest means. After receiving a common-school education, he engaged in mercantile pursuits in his native town. He was apprenticed in 1754 to Nathaniel Coffin, a merchant in New London, Connecticut. He left Coffin's employ in 1759 and returned to his hometown. There Gorham established a small business which quickly succeeded. In 1763 he wed Rebecca Call, who was to bear nine children. In 1770, he launched his public career as a notary, soon winning election to the colonial legislature in 1771. He took an active part in public affairs at the beginning of the Revolution where he supported the Whigs. He was elected delegate to the Provincial congress in 1774 and served throughout 1775. He was a member of the board of war from 1778 until its dissolution in 1781 which oversaw Massachusetts' military strategy, logistics and recruitment. He paid the price for the effective service in that office as British troops ravaged much of his property.\n\nIn 1779 he served as a delegate in the Massachusetts' Constitutional Convention. He was elected to the new Massachusetts' upper House in 1780. In 1781 he was elected to lower house and served there until 1787.

He was re-elected in 1785 serving until 1787.\n\nOn May 15, 1786 he assumed the Chair of Congress in the absence of President John Hancock. On June 5th he was elected President of the United States in Congress Assembled.

November 3 Adjourns - referring \"the several matters now before Congress\" to the new Congress scheduled to meet \"on Monday next\" November 6 Convenes - five states represented November 7-24 Fails to achieve a quorum. November 13 - Nathaniel Gorham's term as President ends.\n\nFor several years after his presidency Gorham was judge of Middlesex County's court of common pleas. Most importantly he was elected to represent Massachusetts in the convention that framed the National constitution. When the convention was sitting as committee of the whole, he was called by George Washington to preside, and filled the chair for three of the four months. As chairman he spoke often, wielded much influence and served on the Committee of Detail. In the final hours of the ConstitutionÂ’s preparation for vote, Nathaniel Gorham suggested the ratio of representation in the lower house of Congress could amend from one for every forty-thousand inhabitants to one for every thirty-thousand. Gorham's proposal was unanimously passed.\n\nHe afterward exerted a powerful influence in securing the ratification of the constitution in the Massachusetts State convention. Unfortunately, Gorham did not serve in the new government he had helped to create.\n\nIn connection with Oliver Phelps he purchased from the state of Massachusetts, in 1786, an immense tract of land on Genesee River, for the sum of $1,000,000. This had been previously ceded to Massachusetts from the state of New York. They soon extinguished the Indian title to a part of this territory, surveyed it into tracts, laid out townships, and sold large parts to speculators and settlers. In 1788-89 Massachusetts scrip rose dramatically in value, enormously swelling the purchase price of the vast tract. In 1790, being unable to fulfill their contract in full to Massachusetts, Phelps and Gorham compromised and surrendered that portion of the land which remained under the Indian title. Gorham never recovered from the insolvency and like Robert Morris in Philadelphia he fell from pinnacle of society and lost his political esteem. At the age of 58 on the 11th of June, 1796 he died a financially broken man and is buried at the Phipps Street Cemetery in Charlestown, MA.\n\nHis eldest son, Nathaniel Gorham, died in Canandaigua, New York, 22 October, 1826, was a pioneer settler of this tract, having been placed there in charge of his father's interests."
