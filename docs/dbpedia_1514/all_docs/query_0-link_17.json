        "text": "Content Description Writes that he is \"very anxious to hear from Delaware Pensylvania [sic] & Jersey,\" in reference to whether those states ratified the constitution. Describes the situation in Massachusetts, \"The prospects rather brightens here. There is one hundred good Men chosen in this neighborhood & the other parts of the Sea Coast - a great number of Towns choose tomorrow among which are such a number of good ones that I think we may count on 50 members of the right sort. That added to the former with the few good ones that will come from the three Western Counties - I think will secure the Point - you must impress upon Mr. King the absolute necessity of his being here at the time - \" Ends by stating, \"it is uncertain whether Mr [Elbridge] Gerry will be chosen tomorrow or not.\" Noted as written in Charles Town, which is now a part of Boston, Massachusetts. Signatory of the U.S. Constitution."
