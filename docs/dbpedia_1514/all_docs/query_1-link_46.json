        "text": "The book, The Summer of 1787, by David O. Stewart, is a detailed work of historical, fact-based non-fiction with a biographical touch. The book has three hundred and forty-nine pages and was copyrighted in 2007 after being published by Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, which is a division of Simon & Schuster, Inc. David O. Stewart is qualified to write on the subject of the Constitutional Convention and all of the events surrounding it because of the extensive research that he has done, which is evidenced by his references to historical accounts in the text and his “Notes” section, which details many of the sources he used in his research. Also, David O. Stewart’s background qualifies him to write about this subject: He has practiced law in Washington D.C. for over 20 years and served as law clerk to several judges. The Summer of 1787 includes several features that add to the overall scope and quality of the book. First, it has illustrations of the delegates that are being described in the book along with other various illustrations added in. Second, it talks about, in more detail, one of the most important parts of government, the elector system. Next, it actually includes the Constitution that was written by these delegates in 1787 and amended so many times since.\n\nNowadays, people know Caesar Rodney’s name because of the school district. But exactly how many know who Caesar Rodney was and what he did for Delaware? Born in 1728 in Dover, Rodney was the eldest of eight children. He attended the Latin School in Philadelphia and went on to hold many important government jobs. Rodney didn’t let his asthma or cancer affect his career, often putting his own needs off to continue serving his people. Perhaps his greatest achievements included delegate to the Continental Congress and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Though he had an informal education, he became one of the most important men in Delaware’s history.\n\nPierce Butler was one of the most aristocratic delegates at the Constitutional Convention. He was born in in County Carlow, Ireland in the year 1744. His father was Sir Richard Butler, who was a member of Parliament and a baronet. He pursued a military career and became a major in “His Majesty 29th Regiment and during the colonial unrest was posted to Boston in 1768 to quell disturbance there” (A Biography of Pierce Butler 1744-1822). Later on he married the daughter of a wealthy South Carolinian; Mary Middleton. He then resigned his commission to take up the life of a planter in the Charleston area. Pierce and Mary had one daughter.\n\nGorham’s disease is an extremely rare musculoskeletal disease of unknown origin that is characterized by the uncontrolled production of distended, thin-walled vascular or lymphatic channels within bone, which leads to resorption and replacement of bone with angiomas and/or fibrosis and the destruction of bone (Lymphangiomatosis and Gorham’s Disease Alliance [LGD Alliance] 2016). This disease usually occurs in children or younger adults that are forty years or younger. Diagnosis and treatment is usually delayed due to the rarity of this disease and due to the fact that many physicians do not have the chance to learn about this disease (Patel, 2005). Because of the loss of the affected bone, the condition is also called disappearing bone disease, vanishing bone disease, and massive osteolysis. Osteolysis means the breaking down of bone. The word is broken up into bone (osteo) and breaking down or destruction (lysis) (LGD Alliance 2016). Fewer than 200 accounts of Gorham’s Disease are reported in the medical literature (National Organization of Rare Disease [NORD] 2008). The condition got its name when Gorham and his colleagues discovered two patients with massive osteolysis in 1954. In 1955, Gorham and Stout discovered further information on these cases and named the disease Gorham’s disease, sometimes called Gorham-Stout disease (Patel, 2005).\n\nBorn on March 29, 1962, in Linden, Alabama, just 90 miles outside of Montgomery, Ralph David Abernathy Sr. was the tenth of twelfth offspring born to William and Louivery Abernathy. His family was more fortunate than most due to the fact they owned a 500 acre farm, which provided a certain measure of independence. Abernathy exhibited evidence of inheriting his father’s spiritual and leadership skills by joining the church at the age of 7 and serving in the army during World War II at the age of 18, where he quickly earned the rank of sergeant. After serving in the war, Abernathy attended Alabama state college, where his political awareness began to flourish. He was elected as president of his student council and led protests to secure suitable student living conditions and quality food in the dormitories. He then graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1950 and also achieved religious training by obtaining a masters degree in sociology from Atlanta University. Remaining committed to church and education, Abernathy became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where he met his wife Juanita Odessa Jones and he became Dean of Men at Alabama State University at the young age of 26.\n\nThroughout the first eight stories of Father Brown, Brown finds many clues and physical evidence that lead up to finding the criminal. In one of the stories, \"The Honour of Israel Gow\" Father Brown is sent to investigate the disappearance of Lord Glengyle and soon notices many odd things are missing or out of place. He also notices that, \"the wax candles which have to be stuck in a bottle necks because there is nothing else to stick them in\"(The Honour of Israel Gow p. 99) and he notices that a halo from an angel is missing. He then later sees an old man named Israel Gow digging up some potatoes, and notices he doesn't touch one spot on the field, it ends up being where Lord Glengyles head\n\nSince he played such a major role in the Constitution Convention, he obviously was going to serve a major role in the new government. He proved himself a brilliant administrator both in organizing the Treasury Department and in assisting generally to set guidelines for and staff all the departments of government. He proposed, to pay the nation's debts in full and also to assume the unpaid debts of the various states. In his later years, he was a strong member of the\n\nThirteen months later, Ben served on the committee that drafted the declaration of independence. He contributed to the Government by serving as a postmaster general, and took over the duties as a president of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention. James Madison was known as the Father of the United States Constitution, no other delegate was prepared for the Federal Convention in 1787 like he was. Alexander Hamilton served in the legislature in 1787, which got him chosen as one of the delegates to the Convention. He was at a disadvantage against the other delegates because of how small of a role he played in the debates. He did however end up as one of the three delegates from New York that signed the finished document. George Washington always had concerns for the country’s future, so he was never a fan of the convention because of humanity’s common failings, and he realized that many citizens suspected the convention would be merely a seizure of power from the states by an all powerful central government and he didn’t want to attend because he didn’t want to appear as the power grasping type of person.The U.S. Constitution called \"a living document.\" Though it may seem like a dry piece of paper to you, it really is designed to live and grow as the nation\n\nMy research was unique, as the topic was old. Finding credible sources was a challenge. My biggest source of primary sources was a website that transcripts old documents, Founders Online. I used it for letters, the Reynolds Pamphlet itself, and other documents that related to this topic. I also used a plethora of books, most coming from my trip to the Knowledge Center at UNR. The only book I could find specifically on the affair was fiction, so I had to find biographies that included this point in Hamilton’s life. Some I looked at in real life, but a few times I found segments online while doing my research. I also used a few websites for images and information I\n\nMany second generation minorities from immigrant parents are driven subconsciously to conform to new culture and social norms. For foreign born parents and native born children integrating the two cultures they inhabit brings about different obstacles and experiences. In Jhumpa’s “The Namesake” the protagonist Gogol is a native born American with foreign born parents. The difference with birth location plays an important role in assimilating to a new society in a new geography. The difficulty for parents is the fact that they’ve spent a decent amount of time accustomed to a new geography, language, culture and society which makes it difficult to feel comfortable when all of that changes. For Gogol the difficulty only lies with the cultural norms imposed by his parent’s and the culture and social norms that are constantly presented in the new society.\n\nIn Gorgias we have a conversation between Socrates, Gorgias, and Polus, Gorgias' young assistant. They speak on the matters of rhetoric, knowledge, and whether injustice and suffering is better to do or have done onto you. While conventional wisdom tells us that it is better to inflict suffering than to receive it, Socrates argues that it is completely the opposite. Part of Socrates view is that moral goodness is connected with knowledge, and that morally it is better to receive suffering than inflict it."
