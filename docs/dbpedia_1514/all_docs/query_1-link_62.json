        "text": "Constitutional Convention\n\nIn 1786, the New Hampshire legislature appointed Gilman to the Continental Congress. Although he was appointed to represent the state at the Annapolis Convention, he was unable to attend. Convinced that a stronger central government was needed to strengthen the economy and unify the colonies, Gilman was pleased to be selected as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.\n\nUnfortunately, Gilman and fellow New Hampshire delegate, John Langdon, were late to arrive. By the time they got to Philadelphia, the debates were well underway and the groundwork had been established for a new government. Nonetheless, Gilman was able to contribute by serving on the Committee on Postponed Matters.\n\nOn the day of signing, Gilman characterized the new government as “the best that could meet the unanimous concurrence of the States in Convention; it was done by bargain and Compromise, yet, notwithstanding its imperfections, on the adoption of it depends (in my feeble judgment) whether we shall become a respectable nation, or a people torn to pieces … and rendered contemptible for ages.” While Gilman’s continued service in the Continental Congress kept him away from New Hampshire, he still worked hard to secure ratification, calling on his brother, John, to help lead the fight.\n\nPublic Office\n\nGilman played a significant role in the new government. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1789 until 1797. In 1793 and 1797, Gilman was a presidential elector. After returning to Exeter, he served in the New Hampshire legislature in 1795, 1802, and 1804.\n\nWhile he was a staunch federalist for most of his political career, Gilman later joined the Democratic-Republican party. In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson appointed him to serve as a federal bankruptcy commissioner. In 1804, Gilman was elected to the U.S. Senate. He served until his death at the age of 58 in 1814.\n\nPreamble to the Bill of Rights\n\nCongress of the United States begun and held at the City of New-York, on Wednesday the fourth of March, one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine.\n\nTHE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution."
