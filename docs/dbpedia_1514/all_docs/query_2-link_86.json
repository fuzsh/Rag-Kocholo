ALS, one page, 7.75 x 8.5, November 5, 1772. Letter to merchants John Reynell and his nephew Samuel Coates. In full, “Pr Capt Hinckley I wrote you desiring you to ship me 2 Tons Barr Iron which I take this opportunity to desire you to alter & in the room of it to send six Tons pig Iron & if you cannot get pig Iron then to send the Barr Iron as afore mentiond. I remain Gentlemen your most Honorable Servant.” Reverse bears an address panel in Gorham’s hand, “Messrs Reynell & Coates, Mercht in, Philadelphia.” Several partial separations along intersecting mailing folds, with a couple affecting single letters of signature, tape repairs to other separations on reverse, and an area of paper loss to lower left from wax seal, otherwise very good condition.
