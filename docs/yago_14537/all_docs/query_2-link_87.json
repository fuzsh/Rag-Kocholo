        "text": "Vivek Agnihotri recently hit back at filmmaker Saeed Akhtar Mirza's 'garbage' remark for 'The Kashmir Files'.\n\nVivek Agnihotri Reacts to The Kashmir Files Row: Vivek Agnihotri, known for his unabashed and unfiltered socio-political views never shies away from speaking his mind. The filmmaker’s 2022 blockbuster The Kashmir Files was once again targeted this time by screenwriter and director Saeed Akhtar Mirza. Mirza had called the movie based on Kashmiri Pandits genocide as ‘garbage’. Responding to the same, Vivek posted two tweets on his official handle. In one of the tweets he wrote, “Maine kaha Mirza sahab ko Salaam. Fir milte hain Janaab, #TheDelhiFiles ke baad (Hello Mr Mirza. See you soon, after The Delhi Files). 2024.”\n\nCHECK OUT VIVEK AGNIHOTRI’S VIRAL TWEETS:\n\nIn an interaction with Indian Express, Mirza said, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. It just the Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims are too caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so–called national interests, and paid guys from the across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.” Reacting to the same Vivek said in a video clip that no one tries to tell the truth about Kashmir. He opined that he is being attacked for coming forward to tell the story of Kashmiri Pandits genocide.\n\nVIVEK AGNIHOTRI TAKES A DIG AT BOLLYWOOD\n\nVivek in another post retweeted his own tweet and captioned it as, “I never wanted to say this but I think it’s time to speak the HARSH TRUTH: All their lives they made films on Muslim victimhood. Only India has a genre called ‘Muslim Social’. Hindus made these people rich & famous. Yet, ungrateful Bollywood has zero empathy towards Hindus.” The tweet has a two-minute, fourteen seconds video clip where he begins by saying, “India is the only community in the world who have created a special genre for Muslims in cinema, called Muslim socials. And there are several examples of this with movies like Coolie, Fanaa, Fiza, and Bazaar..”\n\nVivek further added, “Nobody ever wants to tell the truth about Kashmir and when for the first time, someone came forward, to tell the truth, everybody started attacking him.” Vivek is currently busy shooting for his upcoming project, The Vaccine War.\n\nFor more updates on Vivek Agnihotri and The Kashmir Files, check out this space at India.com."
