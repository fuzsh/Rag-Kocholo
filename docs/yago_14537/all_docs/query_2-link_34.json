        "text": "There was a time when his films showed us the other side of the popular view. Films like Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan , Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Ata Hai , Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho and Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro weren’t just lengthy titles, they reflected the unwieldy side of our democracy as well. Now in his latest book, a collection of essays, tales and folktales, Saeed Akhtar Mirza has decoded today’s times, which he describes as the age of amnesia. “I am not a clairvoyant. I reflect on what I see around me,” remarks Saeed as we settle for a free-wheeling chat in his room at New Delhi’s India International Centre.\n\nPutting the title, Memory In The Age Of Amnesia (Westland), in perspective, Saeed, who calls himself an internationalist, says, “I am trying to understand the world which has gone a bit unbalanced. We have accepted an economic and political system that cannot guarantee anything now. We can neither guarantee jobs nor healthcare. Weren’t democracy and capitalism supposed to be the greatest things that mankind got,” comments.\n\nAlso, he adds, our memory tends to get shortened. “We forget how we got here. I have tried to recreate that. You didn’t make people accountable for the ‘84 riots. You did not make people accountable for the demolition of the Babri Masjid. It seems mass murder is allowed in my country. What message are you sending to people...,” Saeed doesn’t allow any shade of the ideological spectrum go scot-free.\n\nHe draws answers from his personal journey which started from his multicultural upbringing at Fonseca Mansion in Mumbai with stopovers at liberalisation movements in different parts of the world and the Vietnam War. “The war launched the age of questioning for me. But today we have stopped questioning. It seems there is a grand plan that says: Thou shall not think. To think is dangerous. Wonderful diversions are being created to stop us from asking questions. Every day some religion or the other is in danger. I am 75, but I am worried about people who are 25. Without proper education and jobs, their energy would be channelised somewhere else. It frightens me. After Railways, the second highest number of jobs are in security agencies.” And often these ‘educated’ young guards provide security to societies which are standing on land that their fathers or grandfathers tilled. “It must be frustrating.”\n\nOnce upon a time, we found stories of frustrated youth in his Nukkad but today they are nowhere to be seen in our serials and films. “The space for serious discussion has shrunk. Globalisation has made us more and more self-centred, and there has been lumpenisation of aesthetics. They are not allowed to be seen. Only once in a while, they come across in a film like Court, an absolute masterpiece,” he says.\n\nWhat we also miss are faces that Saeed etched on celluloid for posterity. One can’t forget the impact of poet Kaifi Azmi in Naseem when he says hum bhi toh the (we were also there) when his granddaughter is memorising names of freedom fighters from her history book.\n\nFaces tell stories\n\nThe flavour of our conversation changes as Saeed offers some hard mints and takes us back in time. “Kaifi Azmi was a friend of mine. We were rum drinking partners,” he reminisces. “I was looking for a face to cast as the bed-ridden grandfather of Naseem. One day, I put the question to him: Kaifi sahib, will you like to act in my film. He said, ‘kya kaha tumne, kaam karenge?’ He said that and called out Shaukat (Kaif’s wife and seasoned actor) loudly. She rushed into the room. ‘Dobara poochoo (Ask again),’ he said. Perplexed, I made the offer again. ‘Suna Shaukat, (Did you listen, Shaukat)’ he said, ‘he is offering me a role. I am alive! Yes, I will.’” The point, Saeed says, he is trying to make is that Kaifi sahib is history. “But where is that grace, where is the grace of a Shrilal Shukla or for that matter that of a Ghalib or a Tagore? Those textures of the nation are missing.”\n\nIt was not the first time that he had cast a celebrated writer. Years before that he had convinced Bhisham Sahni to work in Mohan Joshi Haazir Ho. “He was an occasional drinking partner,” quips Saeed. “His face was a documentary in itself. In Naseem , I wanted a face that could depict history. The lines on Kaifi Sahib’s face reflected the vestiges of a time gone by. With Bhisham sahib, I got an ordinary face with a certain dignity. That this man leads a quiet life but if you meddle with him, he will not leave you.”\n\nNaseem is closest to Saeed’s heart. “It was the epitaph of my dream of India that I wanted to see. I also like Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan . It was a very strange film that explored the sense of alienation.”\n\nTales from the margins\n\nBut for many it was his exploration of mariginalisation of minorities in Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Ata Hai and Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro that rings a bell even today. “When I was young, I spent a lot of time on the streets of Mumbai, talking to bus conductors and waiters in Irani restaurants. I was always intrigued by people doing an honest day’s work. I often wondered why there were so many Muslims in the underworld. Of course, there were Maharashtrians and South Indians as well, but the number of Muslims was quite large.” The answer, he says, as Salim also says in the film, is wherever they go, the doors are shut on them. “What do you do? There are unwritten laws, unwritten apartheid. The irony is still it is the majority which is feeling threatened. It is like a white man feeling threatened in the US.”\n\nBut he has been an outsider in his own community. After all he is a Leftist Sufi as he loves to describe himself. “I have always been an outsider, it is the best seat in the house,” he exclaims. But how does he make peace with the world? “I travel and observe. What gives me pleasure are my journeys by road. Spending time with common people in dhabas over tea. Common people are incredibly generous.”\n\nSaeed doesn’t want to return to the physically demanding job of filmmaking but he wants to continue writing and mentoring young filmmakers. “I want to write a book on Kundan Shah, a kind of a memoir of our journey.”\n\nIdea behind long titles\n\nThe long titles of his films have always fascinated film enthusiasts. “Through these titles, I wanted to make my films democratic. If you are watching my film, you should know something about the subject. it was not like Sholay dekhiye , Raazdekhiye . When the title is Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastan , you are sure that you will find Arvind Desai and his story in the film. When you are entering theatre, you are making a conscious decision. I want to give you enough information to make that choice, a democratic choice so that you can have a debate with me. I see my films as essays, which you can accept or reject.”\n\nA series that was spiked\n\nHe remembers his friends and collaborators including his brother Aziz Mirza, Vinod Chopra, Kundan Shah and Sudhir Mishra who brought a light touch to his serious subjects. In the book, he has mentioned how one of his works on life in police stations was scuttled by bureaucrats in Doordarshan. “Though Kundan and Aziz had shown only 40 % of what actually happens in police stations, it was bloody true and incredibly powerful. It showed how difficult it is for an ordinary man to get a hearing at the first step of our criminal justice system. We were told the very senior police officer has threatened that if this series was air, he would ensure that the police force fund a series exposing the bureaucracy. We asked, it’s okay, but what about our series!” It could never see the light of the day."
