        "text": "Actor Pavan Malhotra has now spawned an incredible career spanning almost four decades. From debuting wholly in the critically acclaimed Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro to playing some of the most iconic roles in almost 90-odd films, the actor continues to be a force and a name that has become the obvious choice for so many filmmakers for powerful characters.\n\nNow, the actor is set to play T P Bindal in the upcoming film Mission Raniganj; the actor sat in a heart-to-heart conversation exclusively with and talked about several things ranging from his iconic roles to his long career and other things.\n\nTalking about him playing a Sardar in several films and shows and still not being repetitive, Malhotra said, \"Even though I played a Sardar in so many films and shows, everyone is so different. In Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, it's different; in Tabbar, it's different. Who notices? We don't know. But it matters. When you get a role, you do it. Acting is a very interesting profession.\"\n\nHe added, \"In Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, he is like a father-trainer who shines in the little moments of Milkha's developments; in Tabbar, he is a hurt, vulnerable but dedicated father trying to save his son and so on. Everyone is entirely different.\"\n\nALSO READ: An actual 40-foot-deep coal mine was excavated to craft a tunnel resembling a mine for 'Mission Raniganj'\n\nOne director once told me after Black Friday that, you do one thing and you disappear.\n\n-\n\nWhen asked about his four-decade-long career and what he feels about his achievements, Malhotra said, \"When I look back, I am very happy. I want more, of course, but I am thankful to God. 1989, I did my first film, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro. At that time, you don't think about these things. It's just you get work, and you are just surviving. But in that survival, you are also saying no to things, and that was a challenge. One director once told me after Black Friday that, you do one thing and you disappear. When I did something, I gave it my 100 per cent. The journey has been great. People tell me that you always that God has been kind and they like my work - that's very nice of them to say, but I say that it is because of God that I got work and gave me the brains to work on it. If you can't understand Salim Langda, how can you play it; if you can't understand Black Friday's Tiger, how can you play it. But luckily, whoever met me after that told me that's exactly how it was. I never met any such people, but it worked. In the end, I just feel really blessed.\"\n\nAs of now, the veteran is all set to star in Mission Raniganj and has several other projects lined up as well."
