Despite the film’s technical excellence, the presentation of a doomed hero via a quasi-documentary, street-level realism makes the film a voyeuristic experience allowing viewers to feel sorry for the unfortunates in their city.\n\nCensor Certificate\n\nCarnac Bridge\n\n“I received a call from one of Mr. Rushdie's friends on Friday, asking about these names,” said a senior officer of the Mumbai Police, who deals with organised crime. “I thanked him for giving me something to laugh about.”\n\nThe officer said the Mumbai Police's dossiers on organised crime figures had no reference to individuals who might be using “Altaf Batli” and “Aslam Kongo.” “We've had a Salim Langda [‘the lame'], a Salim Kutta [‘the dog'], a Salim Tempo [‘truck'] and a Javed Fawda [‘the spade'] — but no ‘Kongo.' Lots of Batlis [‘bottles'], but no Kongos.”\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2820796.ece\n\nMasjid Bundar\n\nSM:This particular shot had a quality to it: A man who thinks he owns the street, its an attitude. But if you listen to the soundtrack, there is a ship horn being blown. And obviously it shows that were pretty close to the docks. And at that time, a lot of the lumpen elements, a lot of the gangs operated by stealing from the docks.\n\nWong Karwai says of his film Chungking Express that it feels like a diary or a map and claims that if anyone goes to Hong Kong after watching Chungking Express, they will never get lost. This certainly seems to be the case with much of Bombay cinema. Saeed Mirza's films however seem almost like an archive of the city, which has been dispelled from celluloid existence, giving way to the flashier interiors of the Karan Johars and Yash Chopras.\n\nIn this delightful sequence from Saeed Mirza's Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro, the three protagonists banter about about on marine drive. Salim, a petty thief is a little tired of his precarious existence, of the harassment by the police and the unpredictable violence that seems to mark his life. He is contemplating starting a small business which allows him to go 'legit' and in this sequence discusses this with his friends.\n\nCinema has been described as the hidden archive of the urban, and if one were to look for the equivalent of the various figures of urban life in the 19th century documented by Benjamin, one would find them in different shades in Hindi cinema. This sequence captures an urban figure called the'Roadside Romeo', a combination of the flaneur and, the tapori. Like Benjamin and Baudelaire, Hindi cinema captures 'the fleeting, the ephemeral and the transient' in the thousands of eyes, in thousands of objects in which the city is reflected.\n\nDo Tanki\n\nDocklands. Shot on location.\n\nSalim and his colleagues are contracted to steal goods from trucks lined up near the docks.\n\nMasjid Bundar\n\nOn Dialogue, and Bambaiya\n\nSM: While researching, I had tape recorders. I used to record and listen to the language. It's a mix of people coming from the Konkan region of Maharashtra, or Deccan, or from Rajasthan. And in the mix a common language evolved, a Hard-core Bambaiya . And it moves. You get a lot more Marathi words in the mix the moment you move up from Byculla to Lower Parel. Where as in the southern-eastern part of the city the Dakkani influence in stronger. Nukkad was the originator of writing in this language. It preceded Salim...\n\nOn casting, and the influence of Nukkad.\n\nSM: I wouldn't do screen tests, I would do more rehearsals. I had worked with Pawan in Nukkad. He also was on the production side of things in Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho. I saw a spirit in him. And then we just shot a scene together with him, Ashutosh Gowarikar and Makrand Deshpande. It was Makrand's first film).\n\nEstablished in 1975, the NFDC was created to aid in the making of good films in India. Salim Langde pe mat Ro is the 44th film produced by it. NFDC is collaborating with Mumbai-based Pixion Studios for the restoration of 100 films in the next three years including Salim Langde pe Mat Ro.\n\nMinara Masjid\n\nTitle Sequence. Filmed By Binod Pradhan.\n\nVirender Saini (who shot most of Saeed's Films) is the cinematographer of Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro. However, this title sequence was shot by Binod Pradhan. While at FTII, Saeed Mirza, Mani Kaul, Hariharan and Kamal Swaroop along with editors, cinematographers and sound recordists formed the short-lived film co-operative called YUKT. (Union of Kinematograph Technicians) in 1976. The idea was that 4 directors, 4 camerapersons: 4 Sound recordists and 4 editors would produce films together. The 4 camerapersons were Virender Saini, Binod Pradhan, Manmohan Singh and Rajesh Joshi,\n\nGhashiram Kotwal, 1976 by Hariharan and Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Daastan, 1980, by Saeed Mirza were the only films produced under YUKT.\n\nA chronicle of a death foretold\n\nSM: It's a film about a chap called Salim langde...don't cry for him. Obviously there is going to be some tamasha about him! And also you, (the audience) in a sense are going to be a voyeur into the life of Salim and obviously, knowing the title- its not going to be a happy ending. So you are actually now going to be participating in the essay of this man, as a viewer.\n\nIt starts with first person, he's narrating. The whole film is in first person. And when I end the film, the whole point is, whose film is this? How could he narrate the film, if he is going to die? So, I leave it open, as a structure. I saw the audience as voyeurs, of the destruction of a young man called Salim. But through his journey, hopefully they can reflect on what hes really all about.\n\nI used the Voice Over specifically for Salim. I havent used it before and i didnt use it again.\n\nAzad Restaurant\n\nDongri\n\nSandhurst Road\n\nSardar Vallabhai Patel Road\n\nSM: These guys are people of the night, moving around in the grey areas of the city. Lauding themselves in some hole in the wall hairdresser.\n\nSM: This is the anarchism of the guys. Look at this! The Gateway of India, they are trying to bring it down. They're pushing against it. Now What does this mean?\n\nApollo Bundar\n\nGateway of India\n\nSM: Loose, Purposeless, wandering around...\n\nMohammed Ali Road\n\nHaji Ali\n\nHeera Panna\n\nLoose, Purposeless.\n\nSM: Shopping malls, the arcades...the supposedly fancy areas of the city, they will roam. But in the night! And their own areas, during the day.\n\nAir India Building\n\nMarine Drive\n\nOberoi Hotel\n\nSM: Matka Den.\n\nAzad Restaurant\n\nDongri\n\nSandhurst Road\n\nSardar Vallabhai Patel Road\n\nSM: This location comes back in the end. It's like \"a chronicle of a death foretold.\"\n\nJM: The downward arrow symbol is like a metaphor.\n\nThis scene is filmed on the small traffic island in front of Azad Restuarant.\n\nSM: This location comes back in the end. It's like \"a chronicle of a death foretold.\"\n\nJM: The downward arrow symbol is like a metaphor.\n\nThis scene is filmed on the small traffic island in front of Azad Restuarant.\n\nSM: This location comes back in the end. It's like \"a chronicle of a death foretold.\"\n\nJM: The downward arrow symbol is like a metaphor.\n\nThis scene is filmed on the small traffic island in front of Azad Restuarant.\n\n\"Clouds swirl along the blue ridges. You can sit for days watching the light play on the shadows of the mountains, which is maybe why William Burroughs, who drank the hallucinogen yagé prepared by the Indians at the foothills of the Andes at Mocoa, in the Putomayo region of Columbia in 1953, talks so much about blue throughout his life’s work … Amongst other things, he notes a blue face, a blue wall, and plants growing out of genitals.\" [Michael Taussig, What Color is the Sacred? (2009.)]\n\nOn the Textile Worker Motif\n\nSM:I constantly use the refrain of the textile worker. For me the history of the city would be incomplete if I did not reflect on the textile worker. If you look at this from a numbers point of view, 25% of the work force in the city was directly linked to the textile mills.\n\nInAlbert Pinto I had a textile worker. (add pad.ma link) And now here i have a mill worker who has been sacked because the strike is over. He's unemployed, and I'm going to use him as my link to Albert Pinto. He represents that time, which is five years earlier where there was this incredible spirit of going on strike and taking on the world. The longest strike in the history of the world. 1982 to 1984. 2,50,000 workers on strike. It was incredible.\n\nJM: Because he was a mill worker, out of work. What were the oppurtunities for the children? That's why he was pushed towards a lumpen profession. Mothers will not usually work in a muslim family.\n\nSA: This is what Meena Menon writes about, but from the hindu majority point of view, that it was the decimation of the left and the retrenchment of the workers and loss of permanant employment that lead to the capture of the unemployed youth by the Right-wing (shakhas)\n\nFilm set\n\nNatraj Studios\n\nSM: later youll see a reference to Javed. He was a guy who was slightly educated. Perhaps gone to a techical school, he became an electrician some education. And even that like, with some kind of income, gets snapped when he dies, accidently.\n\nBacchu Ki Wadi\n\nCafe Ashrafi\n\nFatima Manzil\n\nMasjid Bunder\n\nShayda Marg\n\nSM: These are all characters I met when i was doing my research. At nights this is the space where all these hoodlums hang out.\n\nRafique Bhai - They trust him because hes a taciturn guy. he wil not intefere and not gossip. he just does his job. And they dont mind him, they discuss their plans...\n\nJM: This Rafique Bhai character is based on Rafique Bhai from Paradise Cafe, which is on the street near the JJ hospital Junction in Byculla. Rafique used to sit there. He was all ears, but never participated in the action. But he know everything that was going on.\n\nSM: Oh i spent a lot of time meeting with them, having tea with them. Lots of nights. We lived in Bombay Central so it made it convenient to come home late at nights.\n\nJM: Plus, a lot of people knew my father who was a doctor (and ran the Patrao nursing home in Bombay Central), so that was an inroad.\n\nSA: Was Nukkad ever an inroad? Had people seen it?\n\nSM: Oh yes, it helped a lot. Thats what got me a lot of access. They had all seen Nukkad and loved it. They trusted us. It helped as a great entry point into their lives. They said, 'these guys are ok' .\n\nJM: I don't know if we should state this, but the film was actually called Karim Langde Pe Mat Ro. And Karim Lala sent a message saying, what are you shooting? We had practially finished shooting when this happened. So if you look carefully at scenes where Pavan is dubbed, you can see that when he's saying Karim, its dubbed Salim.\n\nSA: What did they say?\n\nSM: Oh people came onto the shoot. The requested, there wasn't any dadagiri\n\nSM: Salim's aspirations. his heroes and role models. Untutored, unpad guys who have made it. They know politicians and filmmakers...He's on this journey. And as a viewer, you are getting a bacjground check of what this guy is all about. Salim!\n\nFirst appearance of Ibrahim bhai\n\nSM: There was a chap who died, who used to hang out in Bacchu ki Wadi. They new he was a christian and he was called something hippie. They wanted to give him a christian burial, but he was a foreigner. So the story goes, that they took him to the local cemetery and when stopped, they said, \"you bury him, or well bury you!\" And they got a priest to say the rites.\n\nSA: its so refreshing to not see him speak with an accent!\n\nNatraj Studio\n\nSet\n\nKotha\n\nBacchu Ki Wadi\n\nForas Road\n\nMumtaaz here wears a half-sari, an interesting variation of common costumes used in Kathak or Kathak-influenced dance performance.\n\nNot far from Foras Road in Kamathipura was Pavan Pool, where an entire community of courtesans lived and worked. By day, rooms in the tiny houses are lived in; by night, they are emptied and lined with spotless white sheets for patrons. The courtesans in Pavan Pool, most prominently featured in Merchant-Ivory's 'The Courtesans of Bombay' were often trained in Kathak and music from an early age, with the intent of entering the profession as adults.\n\nSM: See how far the voice over is extending...(and his world)\n\nThis is filmed in a real Kotha in Bacchu ki Wadi (Foras Road) Because of Rafique, we could request to film here for a night.\n\nThe actress, Neelima Azmi is Shahid Kapooor's mother\n\nmujra\n\nPolice Station\n\nSet\n\nSM: Look at that touch on the shoulder...did you see that?

Even though we didnt have the internet to back it up.\n\nbgm: hawa hawa (pakistani pop)\n\ncafe?\n\nCrowding Out Cupid (outlookindia.com)\n\nThis particular scene follows the spatial logic that rules the entire narrative-a logic of constricted space that determines how characters relate to each other and their social milieu. Between Salim and Mumtaz, this means directing their amorous rendezvous to a seedy restaurant. Mumtaz's profession as a \"public woman\" and Salim's status as a lumpen adds anothewr angle to this since this means that the more sanitized spaces of the city are inaccessible to them (as indicated by the scenes set in the predominantly yellow-hued restaurant).\n\nTaj Mahal\n\nSM: That was Sudhir Mishras voice...Abbe!\n\nThe space of the restaurant becomes a recurrent image across the length of the film which gives us a glimpse into the influx of modernity into the lives of the people concerned. The understanding of public space, ranging from cafes to restaurants is hinted at, alongside the frequency with which one enters such a space and the informal interactions that concretize bonds. These spaces become markers which bear witness to a range of events-from the assassination attempts to heated discussions. The family room in the restaurant multiplies as the private and intimate space for the couple and in that way it rewrites the public-private binaries governing imaginations concerning conjugality. The café, possibly in a slightly affluent area, frequented by youngsters not just becomes a space looked at with askance by the lot (Salim, Peer and Abdul), primarily because of its inaccessibility and hostile aura. When Salim finally enters the same space with his lover Mumtaaz, space of restaurant reappears as he breaks into a terrain which was hitherto evaded his grasp.\n\nJM: You have this shot in Albert Pinto also.\n\nSA: The Taxi Driver...\n\nSM: No! But Albert Pinto was before taxi driver. Even Arvind Desai has this shot. I use this image of the mirror to reveal a certain kind of narcisim with the male. There a problem, which I play with. It's a leit motif with me.\n\nNatraj Studios\n\nSet\n\nBacchu Ki wadi\n\nSM: What does a Voice Over device do? It cuts off the desert of details. You cut short... Its like a diary of Salim.

Voice Over by Naseruddin Shah. The character of the documentary filmmaker however is portrayed to with reference to Anand Patwardhan, who is known to screening films in large bastis and local neighbourhoods.\n\nEven though Salim Langde...is made in 1989, Saeed predates the film and sets in against the backdrop of the Bhiwandi riots (which happended in 1984). Saeed says, that was the big one, but there were many before and many after. The anachronism is not important.\n\nJennifer cites MJ Akbar's Riot after Riot as a seminal book. Between 1947 and 1991, there were 45,000 riots in India. The underlying principal of the RSS was never to allow the muslim middle class to emerge.\n\nSo Bhiwandi, Muradabad, Chander, Ahmedabad, Surat, Malegaon...all the powerloom/industrial towns where Muslims ammassed some wealth to own properties and factories...riots occured.\n\nCommunal riots in Bhiwandi 1984\n\n\"In Bhiwandi, communal tension was again generated right through 1983 over the building of a massive meat processing plant-cum-abattoir on its outskirts. Though all the requsite permissions had been obtained by the firm (Al-Kabeer Exports Ltd) local BJP leader B • P. Vyas started an agitation against it on blatantly communal lines, culminating in a procession in November in which all Hindu bodies- the Mahasabha, its militant wing the Hindu Sena, the Shiv Sena, the BJP, the Patit Pawan Sanghatana participated. Congress (11members also participated in their “individual capacity”. (Dr. B P Vyas, it should be mentioned, as indicated severely by the Madon Commission Report for his provocative and dishonest role in the 1970 Bhiwandi riots),. The permission for the project was withdrawn after it was half-completed. This agitation was widely reported in the press.\"\n\nFrom: Read the entire CPDR report;\n\nSee also Arunabh Bhattacharjee's \"Blessed by the Plague\"\n\nBhiwandi\n\nBacchu ki wadi\n\nDo Tanki\n\nCafe Ashrafi\n\nFatima Manzil\n\nMasjid Bunder\n\nShayda Marg\n\nCafe Naaz\n\nVideo game Parlour\n\nThe arcade video games being played by Salim in this video parlour are '1942' and 'Mach Rider'.\n\nFilm set\n\nNatraj Studio\n\nPolice Station\n\nNatraj Studio\n\nSet\n\n?\n\nThis scene where a rotten, unrecognizable body of a young man is taken out from a gutter is the cinematic realization of the constant allusion of such Muslim working class neighborhoods to the wasted and discarded underbelly of the city.The cleaner's commentary puts it in context with the rhetoric of the film,however this event of police machinery taking out unidentifiable bodies from street sides and sewers is also a haunting memory embedded within the everyday life of such city spaces in India.\n\nBacchu Ki Wadi\n\nThis sequence deals with the issue of communalism and the notion of an ‘imagined community’ on the basis of commonly shared culture, music , language and so on. We see Salim and Aslam are having a conversation over the pressing problem of communalism and its roots. What is fascinating in this sequence is the soundtrack. The sound of a train passing evokes the memory of the partition and communal violence around it as trains carrying decomposed corpses is a vividly recognizable image in the memory of the people. The preceding section itself shows the sight of a decomposed corpse dumped during the riots being excavated from the manhole..Secondly when Aslam goes on talking about an imagined community harmonized by shared culture, music so on and so forth the sound of train works as an abiding modality that connects the ‘nation’. Thirdly thanks to Satyajit Ray’s persistent use of the train motif in his ‘Apu Trilogy’ thereby bringing to the fore the issue of modernity and development, the sound of a train passing by becomes important in this context as Dr Ira Bhaskar and Dr Richard Allen in their book Islamicate Cultures Of Bombay Cinema place the film under the rubric of ‘New Wave Muslim Socials’ that has reform at its heart.\n\nAntop Hill\n\nBarkat Ali Dargah\n\nMatka Den\n\nNatraj Studio\n\nSet\n\n?\n\nlaser blade ad\n\nBacchu Ki Wadi\n\nKotha\n\nNatraj Studio\n\nSet\n\nDo Tanki\n\nAir India Building\n\nMarine Drive\n\nOberoi Hotel\n\nMarine Drive\n\nThe citation to \"jeete hain shaan se\" and \"hum kisse se kam nahin\" are references to very popular songs in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nCafe Ashrafi\n\nMasjid Bunder\n\nShayda Marg\n\nBandra\n\nPali Market Road\n\nSt. Johns Street\n\nBandra\n\nGazebo\n\nHill Road\n\nOpen House\n\nNatraj Studios\n\nSet\n\nJuhu Bungalow\n\nBacchu Ki Wadi\n\nNatraj Studios\n\nSet\n\n\"Ek Do Teen\", madhuri dixit, tezaab, intertextuality\n\nSalim goes downstairs as more guests come in.
