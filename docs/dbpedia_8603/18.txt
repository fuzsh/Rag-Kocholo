Damien Rice, Tribalistas, Love

Delicate

Released more than a year ago in his native Ireland, Damien Rice's debut album has just made it to the US.

Carnav√°lia

Recorded in secrecy over a three-week period, Tribalistas brings together three of Brazil's most popular artists.

Alone Again Or

A folk-rock, psychedelic group from the '60s, Love originally released this track on the LP Forever Changes in 1967.

Kind of Light

From Los Angeles, The 88 are a thoroughly modern group with a sound rooted in the 1960s British Invasion.

Hand in the Sand

All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen frequently uses this track as a button while directing All Things Considered.

Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)

Part of a new recording of the complete Beethoven Symphonies, the 7th often elicits extreme reactions from listeners who both love and hate it. Conductor Simon Rattle calls it "a very, very dangerous piece."
