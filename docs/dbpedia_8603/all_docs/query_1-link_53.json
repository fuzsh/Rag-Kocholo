        "text": "I read a review a few years back by a friend of mine, Scottish journalist John Fitzpatrick. It was of Caetano Veloso’s latest album of English-language covers called, appropriately enough, A Foreign Sound (Nonesuch, 2004).\n\nI was sufficiently motivated by that review to put together a piece about other recorded efforts by some of Brazil’s, and the entertainment world’s, past musical polyglots.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that John’s lambasting of Caetano’s solo effort dwelt on his poor diction, which was regretfully right on the money. All right, I’ll say it out front: Veloso tries a bit too hard to bridge the obvious cultural divide between current Brazilian and American pop-music tastes. The album clearly looks backward in time, not forward (more on this aspect later).\n\nEven the Bob Dylan cover, “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” makes one long for those halcyon days when the young and intellectually stimulated Mr. Veloso had once been boldly touted as Bahia’s answer to the elliptical Mr. Dylan.\n\nAlso mentioned in the same breath with Caetano were such popular native-born performers as Ed Motta, Marisa Monte, and Roberto Carlos, whose late-sixties sojourn as the winning contestant in an Italian popular song contest steered him in a whole other direction. Roberto went on to conquer the rest of Latin America, before finally being dethroned by the fluttery tones of romantic Spanish vocalist Julio Iglesias.\n\nAlthough he’s definitely got the retro African American, bluesman-style down pat, Ed Motta is still no linguist, despite an exceptionally impressive musical lineage worthy of the talented nephew of Brazilian soul-funk artist Tim Maia.\n\nNor, for that matter, is Marisa Monte, who, in 1996, performed her own, rather odd musical experiment (with a simultaneous video tie-in, photographed in artsy-fartsy black and white) on Antonio Carlos Jobim’s wonderfully poetic ditty, “Águas de março” (“The Waters of March”), from the Red Hot & Rio album for PolyGram.\n\nScottish-American musician and producer David Byrne, formerly of the group Talking Heads, is no stranger to Brazilian influences (see his 1989 album, Rei Momo, on Warner Records). He joined forces with the youthful Marisa for this unusual vocal romp. Their version of the frequently covered classic pop tune turned out to be an unintended yet striking homage to the 1974 recording, made in Los Angeles for the Verve label, starring beloved MPB icon Elis Regina singing alongside the composer, Tom Jobim.\n\nAt least, the musically astute Mr. Byrne was wise enough not to try the song in Portuguese, preferring instead to alternate his English verses (written by Jobim himself, by the way) with the original lyrics, sung beautifully, of course, by Ms. Monte.\n\nIn all, it was a brave showing, and considered by many as stylistically acceptable, if not authentically accurate, bossa nova.\n\nNascimento’s Sin\n\nMy own vote for the most absurd-sounding covers album ever committed to compact disc — and by an established Brazilian artist almost as well-thought of in musical circles as Caetano — has got to go to Crooner by the estimable Milton Nascimento.\n\nRecorded in 1998 and released the following year by Warner Music Brazil Ltd., this spurious effort predates Caetano’s own work by a good half a decade.\n\nIn it are egregiously sung examples of such pop-style favorites as the latino “Aquellos Ojos Verdes” by Nilo Menendez and Adolfo Utrera (in Portuguese), “Certas coisas” by Lulu Santos and Nelson Motta, Jorge Ben’s early hit “Mas que nada,” made famous by Sérgio Mendes and Brasil ‘66, and other Brazilian compositions.\n\nBut the real clunkers are the American numbers, delivered by the mineiro singer in absolutely execrable English, particularly the fifties torch ballad, “Only You” (Buck Ram-Ande Rand), and the Michael Jackson bad-boy anthem, “Beat It” — you really haven’t lived until you’ve heard the usually soft-spoken Mr. Nascimento, the owner of one of world music’s most ethereal voices, spit out the words, “You wanna be tough, better do what you can so beat it.”\n\nWhat ultimately sinks this offbeat production, though, is the schmaltzy and anachronistic string accompaniment arranged by the disc’s musical director, noted composer-guitarist Wagner Tiso, an old band-mate and ex-musical partner of Milton’s on many of his earlier seventies successes. It’s all of a piece, and a most curious one at that.\n\nDespite the lushness of the stereo ambience, listeners and critics alike greeted the whole mawkish affair with noticeable shrugs and frigid reviews.\n\nIn its defense, the work came at a particularly patchy period for Milton, who had just gotten over a bout of serious illness. He had also finished taping a highly publicized (and emaciated) guest appearance on the popular weekend comedy show, Sai de Baixo (“Get Out From Under It”), on the Globo TV network. The album was to have been his musical “comeback” of sorts — so be it.\n\nWhose-ever bright idea it was to pose the avant-garde Milton Nascimento in a tuxedo with black tie, and dish out those timeless tunes in by-the-numbers fashion à la Perry Como, definitely needed to be sacked on the spot. It must have been the same clueless individual who gave the green light to Rod Stewart’s misdirected Cole Porter and pop standards tribute, another idea that looked better on paper than in the actual execution — then again, it probably looked just as bad on paper, too (“So in Love,” indeed).\n\nThis is surprising because, like Caetano and others, Milton has often rubbed shoulders with talented American musicians for the better part of 30 years, as witness his encounters with former Weather Report member Wayne Shorter, jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, pop singer Paul Simon, and guitarist Pat Metheny.\n\nPortuguese Pitfalls\n\nEven stranger than this was his duet, “Only a Dream in Rio,” written and performed by American singer-songwriter James Taylor, with Portuguese lyrics by Fernando Brant, to be found on Milton’s 1994 album Angelus and later as a solo on Taylor’s 1998 DVD/Video release, James Taylor: Live at the Beacon Theatre.\n\nWho could forget the soulful sound of the man who gave us such stadium standards as “Fire and Rain,” “You’ve Got a Friend,” “Handy Man,” and “How Sweet It Is,” driving full-speed-ahead into the song’s spirited chorus, “O lugar de onde eu vim brota no coração” (“The place where I came from springs from the heart”), his mildly nasal twang earnestly struggling with the unfathomable pitfalls of Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nBut, as in the case of Milton Nascimento and Caetano Veloso before him, James Taylor is an old hand at musical eclecticism: no matter how laughable (or naïve) his attempts at enunciating the Portuguese text may have seemed, his complete and total sincerity in putting this piece across more than made up for any lapses in his linguistic abilities.\n\nMilton and Taylor’s haunting vocals miraculously coalesced, overall, while the song and Nascimento’s album as a whole owed as much of its success to Gregorian chant as to the percussive effects of world-beat.\n\nOn the same, unforgettable Angelus CD, however, is a remarkable cover of John Lennon and Paul McCartney’s “Hello Goodbye,” sung this time in fairly presentable English and amazingly done in Milton’s inimitable, three-octave high-tenor range. A classic!\n\nDenver and Domingo\n\nSpeaking of which, it’s no secret that, for the most part — and with good reason — opera singers have generally been considered to be the one true musical polyglots of the entertainment industry, often singing in a wide variety of languages in any number of foreign works.\n\nIndeed, any lyric soprano worth her salt would be wise to make it a point to familiarize herself with the songs of Hernani Braga (“A Casinha Pequenina,” or “The Little House,” for example), Francisco Mignone, Camargo Guarnieri, and Heitor Villa-Lobos, placing added emphasis on the latter’s lovely Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5.\n\nOne of the few examples around of poetic Portuguese entering the standard classical repertoire, this thoroughly captivating air has been done to death by a whole host of supposed female “superstars,” many of who had no business tackling its linguistic and vocal rigors without at least a working knowledge of how to pronounce the difficult Romance language.\n\nThe most fluent modern interpreter of them all, for that matter, is tenor Plácido Domingo. The Spanish-born opera star, conductor, theater administrator, and all-around overachiever, has been performing professionally going on 60 years. He has literally mastered, at last count, no less than seven different languages, including such stylistic anomalies as Liturgical Latin, German, Russian, and Modern Hebrew. Now that’s what I call versatility!\n\nBut even Plácido was not immune to the occasional side-trips outside his chosen field, as his 1980s partnership with the folksy John Denver, resulting in the lilting pop ballad, “Perhaps Love” (Denver), resolutely showed. Domingo’s charming Iberian accent lent a wistful touch of nostalgia to the proceedings, as did his softy-modulated tone.\n\nThe song was no classic, but it surely wasn’t the career killer it had been predicted to become by nearly every other music critic. For that, we must turn to The Three Tenors — or, more precisely, to two of them: divo Domingo and fellow Spaniard, José Carreras, bawling at the top of their lungs the unintelligible lyrics (were they singing in English, Italian, or Portuguese?) to the Ary Barroso anthem, “Aquarela do Brasil,” at the 1998 World Cup Soccer tournament in Paris.\n\nAstrud’s Contribution\n\nWhich brings me back to bossa nova: if ever any singer lacked the goods to make it in the pop music field, that person was undoubtedly a young singer named Astrud Gilberto.\n\nIn hindsight, though, most Brazilians owe a profound debt of gratitude to her ingenuous language skills: she built up a solid career-footing on the flimsy foundations of one fortuitous recording session — a session that eventually gave rise to a whole generation of pop idols.\n\nAs luck would have it, Astrud, a housewife and non-professional at the time – although a fairly practiced vocalist – was asked by Verve Records (hotly contested, one might add, by none other than composer Jobim) to perform the English verses of the songs, “The Girl from Ipanema” and “Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars” (“Corcovado),” in her patently awful Brazilian accent.\n\nWith her then-husband João Gilberto on acoustic guitar, starting things off in Portuguese in his typical rambling style; the legendary Stan Getz, as winsome as ever, on tenor saxophone; and Antonio Carlos Jobim in the background, gently stroking the keys of his piano, the album instantly caught the imagination of a hit-starved worldwide audience — and catapulted every one of its principal participants, including Brazilian drummer Milton Banana, to the front ranks of jazz-pop artists way back in 1964.\n\nIt would do well for us friends of Música Popular Brasileira to remember, then, that if it had not been for Astrud Gilberto’s allegedly “bad” American English, many of the songs and composers we now take for granted would never have been recognized at all, let alone been recorded, by such towering greats as Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Nat “King” Cole, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, to name a random few.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Veloso, my own sincerest and humblest apologies are in order for your adventurous Foreign Sound. In view of the foregoing, it’s really not so “foreign-sounding” after all. ☼\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Josmar F. Lopes\n\nPretend you are about to take an essay exam and are getting ready to answer the following question: what do Portuguese fado, Italian opera, and Música Popular Brasileira have in common? Give up? Many people would too. But think about it for a moment. Outside of the fact they’re all separate and distinct music styles, each with its own specific method of interpretation and delivery, what have these various genres given the world if not a wealth of extremely talented and versatile performers?\n\nIn this piece, the focus will be on the successful careers of three of the most talented and versatile of these performers (only one of whom, by the way, is Brazilian by birth). They have dedicated their lives to incorporating aspects of the above entertainment areas. All share an unbounded admiration for Brazil’s music and culture, which they have wisely chosen to express in their own distinguishing manner.\n\nNeither Fish nor Fado\n\nHer arms were extended outward, as if in gentle supplication to restless audience members to lend an attentive ear toward her wistful song. The look was both haughty and proud, the attitude one of openness and warmth, with a touch of simpatia tossed in. Her bearing was unwaveringly regal yet becoming of one whose build is so lean and slender. There was also the unmistakable air of the diva about her.\n\nIt must have been the classic profile, the protruding chin, the dark complexion, and the magnificent blonde coiffure, its many endless and fascinating curls, like those of a face on an ancient Aegean vase, all intricately woven into unbroken lines across her faultlessly-formed features.\n\nSuddenly, the hallowed name of Maria Callas sprang to mind. While remembering the faded kinescopes of the once celebrated star of La Scala and other international opera houses, I was reminded of Portuguese singer Mariza’s striking resemblance to the immortal La Divina — and to the Divine One’s searing intensity and command of the operatic stage.\n\nIn interviews granted throughout 2003, given concurrently with the release of her second album Fado Curvo (Times Square Records), the Lusitanian songstress, born Mariza dos Reis Nunes in Mozambique but raised in the Mouraria section of Lisbon, cited the revered Greek-American soprano Callas and her illustrious countrywoman, Amália Rodrigues, as pervasive influences on her own individualized take on contemporary fado.\n\nHaving seen Mariza perform live and in concert on the campus of North Carolina State University’s Stewart Theatre, I can wholeheartedly agree. Though not strictly a Brazilian entertainment form, nor remotely related to traditional Western ideals of the operatic, this freely emotive and soulful style of singing has been with us for nearly two and a half centuries — much longer, in fact, than any of the standard repertory items of masters Verdi, Wagner, and Puccini combined.\n\nMost of all, there’s something grandly theatrical about the art itself — the hand gestures, the facial expressions, the song structures, the lyric flights of poetic fancy — that has lately transformed fado into a worthy successor to the almost-absent stage presentations of opera in Brazil’s own artistic firmament.\n\nMariza’s devout following knows, too, that years before her recent world-music conquests, the rebellious future stage figure had visited Rio de Janeiro, the “holy shrine” of Carnival, where, as inevitable as the Copacabana tide, she became infatuated with the soothing sounds of samba and bossa nova, only to return to her adopted land as an invaluable dispenser of its native song collection.\n\n“I was looking for something when I went to Brazil. I had to do that to come back to my first love. But what I was looking for was in front of my nose all the time and I was the only one who couldn’t see it.”\n\nThe search for one’s true calling in the entertainment field can be an excruciatingly nerve-wracking venture for any performing artist, let alone one of Mariza’s standing and repute. Relief came in the satisfaction she gleaned from having to face up to the style’s built-in challenges.\n\n“Fado is an emotional kind of music,” she proclaimed, “full of passion, sorrow, jealousy, grief, and often satire… I just want to sing.” And that she does well enough – particularly, on the darkly sentimental opening numbers, “O silêncio da guitarra” (“The Silence of the Guitar”) and “Cavaleiro monge” (“Monk Rider”), and the exuberantly festive “Feira de Castro” (“The Fair at Castro”).\n\nWhile leaning more towards tradition for her first album, Fado em Mim (“Fado in Me”), Mariza took a much freer approach to Fado Curvo, finding both refinement and nuance in the piano-and-cello accompaniment of “Retrato” (“Portrait”) and a softer pop side for “O Deserto,” before ending on a passionate note with “Os anéis do meu cabelo” (“Curls of My Hair”), a semi-autobiographical piece.\n\nHaving gone about as far as a modern fadista could go in her profession, she decided to stretch herself even further by joining forces with acclaimed carioca-born arranger, musician, and producer Jaques Morelenbaum, a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music, for her third go-around with the musical genre: the 2005 release of Transparente, also for Times Square Records.\n\nMariza flew all the way down to Morelenbaum’s hometown of Rio, “Because,” she pointed out later, Jaques’ “entire working environment is in Brazil.” With that, the exotic-looking entertainer confirmed to the UK’s FLY magazine that she “didn’t do anything [for two months] but thinking, working, and singing on this new album. I woke up every morning and waited for the hour to start working. I was able to achieve a greater intimacy, not only with music but with poetry as well… It was very good for me. Besides having the chance to meet and work with new musicians, it helped me to concentrate completely on my new album.”\n\nA veteran of several-hundred studio sessions, Jaques Morelenbaum has concentrated his own efforts on assisting quite a number of professionals with their recording projects — and with some of their live performances as well. Among the most notable are Antonio Carlos Jobim, Egberto Gismonti, Gal Costa, Chico Buarque, Milton Nascimento, David Byrne, Marisa Monte, and Carlinhos Brown, not to mention his work with directors Walter Salles Jr. and Gerald Thomas. This was exactly the kind of Brazilian connection Mariza was hoping for in her next musical venture.\n\n“I’m very fond of Brazilian rhythms, such as bossa nova, Vinicius de Moraes, Elis Regina [and] Caetano Veloso,” she told interviewer Petr Dorůžka of the Website Free Music. “I already knew Jaques had worked with Caetano and [Japanese composer] Ryuichi Sakamoto. We met in music festivals in Portugal and abroad. I’ve always wanted to work with him. I spoke to my record company and they liked the idea. I suggested it to Mr. Morelenbaum and he returned to my suggestion with all possible dates. I’ve always thought that doing it would help me to reach the sonority I was looking for.”\n\nFor the BBC, Mariza delved further into her nation’s musical distinctiveness: “I am looking for fado from a different perspective, because I now travel a lot… I am starting to find that this music that belongs to Lisbon, to Portuguese people, is starting to feel more and more universal. It speaks about universal feelings. Each country interprets it in its own way. We are crossing cultural lines now. And I feel so proud about it.”\n\nTaking into account the end result, she divulged to Free Music that, “When I listen to this album I feel my fado, my sound. Jaques Morelenbaum uses all musical instruments in a magical way, with lots of care. He was the producer for this record; he understood me.”\n\nWe, too, understand what Mariza was striving for, and where her aspirations currently lie: right now, they’re with her dynamic vision of fado. Fortunately for her fans, she’s left one foot dangling in the doorstep of the pop-music world, which is as it should be.\n\n“I listen to all kind of music, as long as it’s good. But I have to confess, I have my preferences: Maria Callas, Tony Bennett, Nina Simone, Sting. Like everywhere we do have international pop artists in the charts, but there’s good music being done in Portugal, like Rui Veloso, Carlos do Carmo, Jorge Palma. To name a few.”\n\nThat’s too few to please the masses. But on her own, Mariza has had no problem doing just that.\n\nLisbon Story and Well Beyond\n\nIt seems the fado standard has been placed in exceptionally capable hands with Mariza. Other contemporary practitioners of the form, such as Cristina Branco, Aldina Duarte, Kátia Guerreiro, Mísia, and Dulce Pontes, continue to hold up their end by keeping the flame of fado’s essence alive.\n\nWhile popular within their own country’s confines, they have yet to command the attention of outside audiences the way Mariza has, or to reach out beyond the borders of Lisbon’s famed Alfama district, the scene of numerous triumphs from Portugal’s past.\n\nOne Portuguese artist who did reach out beyond Lisboa, and whose face and voice outside audiences have clearly grown accustomed to over the years, is the lovely Teresa Salgueiro, the former lead singer for the group Madredeus.\n\nTheir music, which some critics have labeled as cloying and pretentious, comprises elements of traditional fado with touches of folk, tango, New Age, world-beat, Middle Eastern, flamenco, and other sources factored in. True to his family’s surname (which, in English, is rendered as Magellan, the Portuguese explorer who first circumnavigated the globe), guitarist, musician, and producer Pedro Ayres Magalhães, one of the group’s founding members, is the individual most responsible for its wide-ranging repertoire.\n\n“Fado is sung in the first person… telling sentimental stories,” Magalhães explained in a 1995 interview with New York Times writer Alan Riding. “Our themes are as universal as possible, talking about feelings, life and death,” a statement that convincingly supports the conclusion Mariza eventually came to reach.\n\nWhen you listen to one of Madredeus’ carefully-concocted creations — O Espírito da Paz (“The Spirit of Peace,” EMI, 1994), for instance, or their 2000 compilation Antologia (Metro Blue) — you experience an atmosphere of calmness blanketed against a soundscape of six-string Spanish guitars; mixed with harmonically absorbing accordion flourishes grounded firmly by the cello’s deep-bass fullness; punctuated intermittently by synthesized keyboards, originally programmed by Rodrigo Leão, the other founding member, and later by Carlos Maria Trindade, the producer and piano player on Mariza’s Fado Curvo.\n\nThe real standout, however, is Teresa’s elegant soprano tone, the vocals of which well up from the center position. In Portuguese, the name Salgueiro means “willow” (as in “weeping willow”). It’s a sound that, in reviewer Imre Szeman’s poetic construct, “combines earthly desire and cosmic awe, material longing and transcendental hope, and which settles over you like a state of grace.”\n\nThe urge to hold back one’s tears, then, is diminished amid the gentle sweep of her voice — delicate, supple, and ethereal — as it passes over you in soft, undulating currents. There are but a handful of performers that can do this to a person. Teresa Salgueiro happens to be one of them.\n\nIn the late 1980s, while still a teenager, Salgueiro was discovered working as a singer in a Lisbon bar by Magalhães and Leão, who asked her to join their newly formed band of five. Impressed by their sound, she agreed to increase the number to six by becoming the group’s only female member. “A gift of nature,” Magalhães conceded. “It was strange to find someone who is 17 who sings with [such] joy and with the same timbre and vigor as the voices people remember hearing in Portugal.” Not for nothing was she billed as the number one “pretender” to the great Amália Rodrgues’ fado throne.\n\nResultantly, Madredeus was lifted to local prominence during an especially fertile period for world music, where the ethnic diversity of such artists as The Chieftains, Enya, The Gipsy Kings, Youssou N’Dour, and Yanni was much celebrated and highly in vogue. The presence of someone as young as Salgueiro only added to the formula. Even so, the group remained stubbornly peninsular-bound.\n\nIt was German filmmaker Wim Wenders who eventually rescued Teresa and her band-mates from anonymity. Wenders was so taken with their work that he used several of Madredeus’ songs to accompany Salgueiro’s soft-spoken screen persona in his 1994 movie Lisbon Story (Viagem a Lisboa). “I wanted to film them as they performed,” the director asserted to Alan Riding. “They were playing with such pleasure, such intensity, and integrity; and Teresa’s voice filled the small space with so much emotion that I felt a shiver running down my spine.”\n\nTheir compelling soundtrack (entitled Ainda, or “Still”) was rushed into production in order to fill the skyrocketing demand for the group’s music. By then, Teresa’s disarming and totally un-self-conscious portrayal of herself, pitted against Wenders’ cinematic alter ego, actor Rudiger Vogler, became a winning combination with viewers. The film went on to do for present-day Lisbon what Black Orpheus had done for Rio in its sixties heyday.\n\nFrom there Madredeus toured all over Europe, as well as Africa, Asia, the United States, and South America. During a yearlong 2006 sabbatical, Salgueiro resolved to strike out on her own, eventually reemerging as a well-regarded soloist in São Paulo for a January 2007 series of performances at the Golden Cross Jazz Club (formerly Tom Jazz) in the high-profile neighborhood of Higienópolis.\n\nThe concerts were held to commemorate her recently concluded EMI project, Você e Eu (“You and Me”). As ambitious a recorded undertaking as any in recent years, the CD showcased the entire spectrum of Brazilian popular song, beginning with the thirties and forties, the so-called “golden age” of samba and choro; moving up to the prime bossa nova period of the 1950s and 1960s; right down to the chart toppers of the mid-1970s.\n\nIncluded were such classics as “Marambaia,” a lively number often associated with Elis Regina; “Na Baixa do Sapateiro” (“Bahia”) and “Pra machucar meu coração” (“To Wound My Heart”) by the ever-popular Ary Barroso; “O samba da minha terra” (“My Country’s Samba”) and “Saudade de Bahia,” both by the late Dorival Caymmi; Luiz Bonfá’s lilting “Samba de Orfeu” from the movie Black Orpheus; the beautiful “Se todos fossem iguais a você” (“Someone to Light Up My Life”) from Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes’ inaugural Orfeu da Conceição collaboration; a smattering of Jobim’s best work with other wordsmiths (“Estrada do sol,” “Inútil passagem,” “Triste,” and “Meditation”); and concluding with Chico Buarque’s prize-winning “A banda” from 1966.\n\nThe best that could be said about Salgueiro’s attempts at this more pop-driven burst of song is that she excelled brilliantly in the fast numbers. A side-by-side comparison with the late singer-actress Carmen Miranda, who was herself of Portuguese extraction, left little doubt as to her rhythmic capabilities and care for note values. Teresa covered herself in glory on the lightning-quick “Marambaia” and on Jobim’s gossamer work, “Chovendo na roseira” (“Double Rainbow”).\n\nBut she may have wandered too far from her fado roots — a codfish out of salt water, most likely — in the slower-paced bossa nova items. Here, her thick native-born accent became more of an actual hindrance than an obvious advantage. The dissimilar vowel sounds of her Lusitanian ancestry clashed with the more-rounded demands of the title tune, written by Vinicius with Carlos Lyra; or the highly literate “Insensatez” (“How Insensitive”), one of master Jobim’s loveliest incantations, done to flawless perfection by him and Frank Sinatra nearly four decades prior.\n\nWhat was the motivating force behind this amalgam of musical styles? “Você e Eu symbolizes the encounter of a Portuguese singer with the music and musicians of Brazil,” Salgueiro explained to the Mundo Lusiada Website, “a partnership and a communication built through music; above all, [it is] the acknowledgement of our collective individuality before the individuality of the other, the joy of having a dialogue and the willingness to make this encounter possible.”\n\nThere has always been some degree of hesitation among fellow Brazilians as to whether or not they will admit to a fondness for their mother country’s music. In this case, however, there can be no question of a certain singer’s unrestrained ardor for Brazil’s melodic inventions.\n\n“Ever since I was a child,” she remembered fondly, “I loved to hear the sound of the Portuguese language in Brazilian music, and early on I admired and followed their interpreters, their authors, and their composers.”\n\nNonplussed by her detractors, Salgueiro insisted these songs were “[m]elodies that have always captivated me with their beauty and sophistication, words that have enchanted me by the power of their images and their ability to evoke so much simplicity, always close to the popular vernacular, the poetry of longing and of love.”\n\nThe album’s final tally, a formidable 22 tracks in all, posed a monumental challenge for any pop stylist, then and now. But for Teresa Salgueiro it was an especially noteworthy endeavor, one she greeted with her habitual graciousness and aplomb. “Finally, we can live this experience for the first time directly with the public… I am grateful to [pianist, arranger, and musical director] João Cristal for teaching me to sing these songs and sincerely hope to share this happiness with many more people.”\n\nOn the heals of her successful live solo work — held over for several nights by popular demand — can there be any chance that Teresa will get back together with her old fado crowd? The answer appears in the credits for Você e Eu: listed as executive producer of the album, in addition to its head of mastering and art direction, is the leader and co-founder of Madredeus, composer-lyricist Pedro Ayres Magalhães. Burning her artistic bridges is definitely not a part of Salgueiro’s lounge act.\n\n“A Great Little Noise”\n\nFor all their novelty and fame, Teresa Salgueiro and Mariza both represent, in their own specialized manner, the modern views of an already established, older order. Between them, however, they’ve developed certain undeniable traits. Some of the more familiar include a finely honed (if somewhat flamboyant, in Mariza’s case) fashion sense, an appealing voice, an attractive and outsized stage presence, an artist’s innate sense of what the public wants, business and financial smarts, and the big theatrical gesture.\n\nAs a yardstick for superior vocal ability, big theatrical gestures (in the form of graceful arm and hand movements) are the stock-in-trade as well of another, better-known Marisa: MPB singer, producer, arranger, songwriter, and Tribalista, the Rio-born Marisa Monte.\n\nIn an October 2002 interview for Brazzil magazine’s music editor Bruce Gilman, Marisa revealed, quite offhandedly, the real reason behind the spontaneous use of her upper extremities in many of the artist’s live presentations.\n\n“They’re the kind of gestures that I make when I’m talking. Really, I talk a lot with my hands. It’s funny because… in some songs my hands are attached to the guitar, and I really miss moving them. It’s like a suspension of my expression. Moving my arms and hands is something that really helps me to sing and to communicate a song’s meaning.”\n\nWhatever it took, for the past 20 years Marisa Monte has been communicating many a song’s meaning not only through sweeping hand gestures but also via her superb singing voice and stunning good looks on stage. Today she stands as one of Brazil’s most dependable musical exponents, a full-blown example of the heterogeneous nature of talent.\n\n“I’ve never started from the premise that my music is this or that,” she made known in a 2006 New York Times article. “Even for me, it’s difficult to pick a label. People don’t know if I’m pop or something else. The labels never last long anyway, because at any moment it becomes easy for me to destroy all the theories.”\n\nGuitarist and musician Arto Lindsay, who has presided over several of Marisa’s recorded entrees, referred to her as a person of wide taste, “but also very mainstream. One of the secrets of her success is that she has really popular taste, and so is very honest about doing what she does and looking for the best from every genre.”\n\nThe possessor of an obviously open and gifted mind-set as well, the carioca native let Gilman in on some of her “secrets” with a purposely winding back-story involving her own artistic coming of age: “When I was eighteen, I went to Italy to study opera, which gave me the opportunity to study the repertoire and to live outside Brazil awhile. But after living in Italy for a year, I began to see Brazil with different eyes.\n\n“For the first time, I could see how rich, original, and unique Brazilian music is in relation to the rest of the world. I saw myself a long way from home and realized how hard it was going to be to put aside all the cultural weight, the density of my background. Never before had I felt so Brazilian.\n\n“To escape my background, to forget all the culture that had been implanted since birth, I would have had to live outside of Brazil for the rest of my life. I also knew it was going to be very difficult for me to put aside modern production techniques.\n\n“And since opera is something that is turned more toward the past, I could see clearly how, for me, it was more important to be in Brazil than to be singing opera in Italy. So I came back when I was nineteen. I had been receiving invitations to record pop music in Brazil since I was sixteen, but studying in Europe was just a way of taking enough time to find my way, to decide what I really wanted.”\n\nBy her own calculation, Marisa has recounted this thrice-familiar tale “millions” of times, including at least once to her colleague and friend, producer Arto Lindsay. “And I am sure I’ll keep telling it forever,” she chuckled. “Even if I write it down, it’s not the same as hearing it in my unique voice.”\n\nAh, yes, that “unique voice.” Gilman has praised its “extraordinary dexterity,” “a mezzo-soprano, warm in timbre and unbelievably flexible,” blessed with “a wider sweep of coloration on all ranges than most voices in contemporary Brazilian pop.”\n\n“Silvery and liquid,” raved Times reporter Larry Rohter, “it glides, flutters and skips above her songs with a delicacy that invites listeners to relax and enjoy the ride.” Mr. Lindsay alluded to Marisa’s “work ethic” and “beauty that matches her voice,” along with applauding her interest in Brazilian and Portuguese literature and her “understanding of the way pop art works.”\n\n“For me, it’s all art,” she responded. “I’m interested in what’s going on in other artistic expressions as a reference for what I’m doing. And I like to talk to people from other cultural areas because I think it’s interesting to compare the process of creation, the concepts in the works, and to exchange these kinds of feelings and ways of production.”\n\nBy way of example, she has surrounded herself with an impressive lineup of individuals with “other artistic expressions”: Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, Nando Reis and David Byrne, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Laurie Anderson, Bernie Worrell and Philip Glass. But the first to unlock the possibilities may have been her longtime supporter, journalist, songwriter, and television and music producer Nelson Motta — not quite the haute voix of the avant-garde, but an astute judge of latent talent nonetheless.\n\nHere, in an extract from his Noites Tropicais: Solos, Improvisos e Memórias Musicais (“Tropical Nights: Solos, Improvisations, and Musical Memories”), are Motta’s earliest recollections of the fast-rising nineteen-year-old sensation:\n\n“What I saw and heard gave me the vivid impression of being before a real talent. And more: of a strong scenic personality, of a youngster with an optimal musical culture and superb taste in repertoire… And an obsessive desire to learn, to better herself, and to grow. It wasn’t just her ambition to cut a record, to play on the radio, or to become a pop star. She wanted to be a stage singer, much like the lyric singers of old; and the recordings, if they materialized, would be a secondary natural consequence of all that; because she believed that great music happened live – with all of its risk-taking, lack of a safety net, and short-lived moments – just like in the theater and the opera world.”\n\nHer adolescent idol was the soprano Maria Callas — one of those “lyric singers of old” that, by sheer coincidence, was the same role model that inspired her namesake, fadista Mariza, to take the artistic plunge. Her link to Velha Guarda (“The Old Guard”) da Portela Samba School of Rio, from where her knowledge of Carnival and samba must have derived, proved invaluable to her development as a performer. (It helped that her father Carlos had once been cultural director for the group.)\n\nWhat about all those recordings that were expected to have materialized from her stage success? Not to worry. Unlike many artists who issue album after album of mindless filler, Marisa has spent much of her free time in thoughtful contemplation as to what exactly to leave behind for posterity.\n\nTo date she’s recorded a grand total of eight solo albums and one group effort — not very impressive numbers in themselves, but hardly second-rate studio fodder either. Her first, MM (World Pacific) from 1989, was a live performance based on an early TV special. If anything, it set the tone for what was to become her signature eclecticism.\n\nThe songs were drawn from all quarters, and highlighted the work of a contemporary rock band, an Italian pop-rock artist, a purveyor of Brazilian soul, and a psychedelic group from the seventies, along with a few standard-issue set pieces from different time periods, the most memorable of which was a version of the Motown classic “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” (Strong and Whitfield), as well as tracks that paid tribute to Carmen Miranda, George and Ira Gershwin, and Kurt Weill.\n\nDespite its one-word title, her second album Mais (World Pacific, 1991) did not feature “more” of the same, but took a different turn in that she co-wrote many of the numbers with ex-Titãs partners Reis and Antunes. A cover of Caetano Veloso’s “De noite na cama” (“At Night In Bed”) and selections from sambistas Cartola and Pixinguinha, in addition to an item by a gentleman identified only as Nordestino, rounded out the program.\n\nShe continued along this line for her next major outing, the improbably christened Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor de Rosa e Carvão (Blue Note, 1994), marketed in the U.S. under the banner Green, Blue, Yellow, Rose and Charcoal. The guest list for this super-production read like a name-dropper’s guide to the musical galaxy, i.e., Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, Celso Fonseca, Paulinho da Viola, Velha Guarda da Portela, Messrs. Glass and Worrell, Romero Lubambo, Fred Hammond, and so forth. It was perhaps Marisa’s biggest seller abroad.\n\nHer subsequent work, Barulhinho Bom (“A Great Little Noise,” EMI, 1996), a double-compact disc combination of live performances and studio proficiency, solidified her pop-music credentials; in fact, it went above and beyond anything she had done before. From that point, extensive touring, the presenting of more and elaborate stage shows, playing on and producing albums by other artists — even the creation of the record label Phonomotor for the purpose of preserving her own projects — took precedence over domestic bliss.\n\nNevertheless, two more releases followed. Memórias, Crônicas e Declarações de Amor – “Memories, Chronicles and Declarations of Love” (Blue Note, 2000), was a title that seemed lifted from Mr. Motta’s recently published reminiscences. It won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Album in 2001. Topping even that envious honor, the 2002 launch of Tribalistas on Phonomotor, with fellow participants Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, hit Number Twelve on the Billboard charts, earning generous Grammy notices and winning one for Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album.\n\nNot until she became pregnant with her son did Marisa take some needed time off. Following a three-year hiatus, she came back, fully charged, in 2006 with two back-to-back albums of mostly new material by her and Tribalista band members Brown and Antunes, Universo ao Meu Redor (“Universe All Around Me”) and Infinito Particular, both for EMI. With a little help from some old friends (Adriana Calcanhotto, Caetano Veloso, Jaques Morelenbaum, Eumir Deodato, João Donato, Paulinho da Viola, Philip Glass, and Daniel Jobim), these works turned out to be winners as well.\n\nMarisa herself took a more proactive role in their production, exemplified by her mastering of some rather exotic instrumentation. Many of those she used, such as the auto-harp, melodica, kalimba, metaphone, cajon, vocoder, baixo, cowbells, and reco-reco, sounded suspiciously like leftovers from a discarded Uakti session. Even computerized electronics were no barrier to her experimentation.\n\n“I love manipulating the sound of everything. You can create new instruments that don’t exist or new tonalities for traditional instruments. Plus, the mixture of the pure sound with the processed sound is really cool.”\n\nNelson Motta was right about a lot of things. Mostly, he was spot-on concerning his former protégée’s having the patience and self-discipline to take her musical ambitions to Valhalla-like heights. Of course, Marisa has never been content to stay within predictable parameters — and, as far as we can tell, no safety net was ever extended for this peerless risk-taker, either.\n\nTurning once more toward the past, if she had lived during the early part of the twentieth century Marisa would surely have raised the bar for the likes of Rosa Ponselle, Geraldine Farrar, Maria Jeritza, Claudia Muzio, Lina Cavalieri, and other prima donnas of their ilk. And that’s no small feat, since they were all true operatic superstars of the very first order, renowned as much for the beauty of their voices as for their fabulous looks on stage.\n\nIn the breadth and scope of their knowledge, however, they would be no match for our modern-day diva. Why, back in the day she might even have forced them into some type of early retirement, or taken over at a moment’s notice. That’s soooo like the theater and opera world, isn’t it? A world and a culture Marisa Monte has yet to completely escape from. ◊\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Josmar F. Lopes"
