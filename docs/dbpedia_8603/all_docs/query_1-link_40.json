        "text": "THE singer-songwriter Marisa Monte has one of those supple, knowing voices that make Brazilian pop so inviting. After a decade in which she became one of Brazil's top stars, Ms. Monte stopped touring in 2001 to catch her breath, have a child and re-examine her music.\n\nShe didn't disappear. \"Tribalistas,\" the album she made in 2002 in a two-week collaboration with fellow Brazilian songwriters, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, won a Latin Grammy award and sold a million copies in Brazil. Now she's back with two very different albums, being released this week by the Metro Blue/Blue Note label in the United States: \"Infinito Particular\" and \"Universo ao Meu Redor.\" (They're already hits in Brazil.) And on Nov. 14 she will come to the Beacon Theater as part of her first American tour since 2000.\n\n\"Universo ao Meu Redor\" is about heritage: the sambas that Ms. Monte grew up hearing and studied more deeply when she produced an album for the Velha Guarda da Portela, the old guard, or elder members, of the long-running Portela samba school in Rio de Janeiro. (Her father is one of the school's directors.)\n\nShe sings borrowed sambas -- reaching back as far as the 1940's and including some that have been widely sung but never recorded -- along with a few of her own songs, and she's backed largely by acoustic instruments in cozy but untraditional arrangements. It's samba carried inward."
