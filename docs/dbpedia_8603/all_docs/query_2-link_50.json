        "text": "Karol Conká, Urucum – Following a resoundingly unpopular appearance on Brazil’s Big Brother show, Conká tries a rebound with the release of her third album. On the lead track, “Fuzuê”, she effortlessly recaptures the excitement of her debut, Batuk Freak, but after that she settles into echoes of past glories. In her decade recording career, she struck gold once, and the strike was so rich she seemed like a titan-to-be, but one-album wonder with extras for possible career overview may be all she amounts to. Guess she can follow the path of other shooting star burnouts onto reality TV. Oh wait. Grade: C\n\nCriolo, Sobre Viver – After a decade-dominating run starting with Nó na Orelha, the rapper made a (good!) salsa album and then went quiet for five years. Here he returns to his roots. Although longtime collaborators Daniel Ganjaman and Marcelo Cabral appear a couple of times, Criolo mainly works with Tropkillaz (DJ Zegon and Laudz), who have been one of the top producing teams in Brazil in recent years, and the updated sound revitalizes his art. Where Ganjaman and Cabral conjured deep, satisfying mixes rewarding deep headphone immersion, Tropkillaz aim big and pop: this is music made to be played loud and in public. Which suits Criolo’s purpose well. Criolo’s lyrics have always been socially and politically informed, but this is his first album of the Bolsonaro era so his reflections on chaos diaries and black kids and hope hit different. Translations are always tricky. Language never quite escapes context intact, and some of these seem to be a bit ‘well meaning’. (The title translates as “About Living”.) But meaning well in the face of creeping fascism is a political commitment, and here Criolo does his bit to boost morale and focus attention in a crucial election year. As Joe Gross recently tweeted, art may not save us, but it can make things less horrible, and sometimes it does this by reminding us of a better world that doesn’t currently exist while pointing out the limitations of this one, which Criolo does throughout this record. And, of course, that better world’s got the beats so non-Lusophones can dance along. Play it loud, because he’s black, he’s Brazilian and he’s proud, no matter what Bolsonaristas may try to do. Listen here. Grade: A-\n\nLa Era do Acuario, Live Hipnosis – Mexican garage rock band that gives away its MO with its name (Age of Aquarius) and songs titled “Hippie Hippie Houra” and “Maria Juana”, a “White Rabbit” cover, and one (“Fotografía”) that’s either a cover (“Pictures of Matchstick Men”) or theft. Their 2021 studio debut isn’t bad and has chord progressions that hit my pleasure spots, but this live set is where I wonder if there’s more to the band than initially meets the ears. Sure, they are completely derivative, but when the dreamy/hazy gal voices drift alongside those organ surges, squawky sax and fuzzy guitar…well, it’s not skronk, but it’s performing similar functions, and it sounds fun and spirited in a way the pretty good studio debut aims for, but doesn’t quite achieve. Wish I had Mr. Peabody’s wayback machine to be there in person for the “Agujero Negro”-“Etéreo”-“Bailando En El Mar” sequence which ecstatically pushes music toward noise without losing its grounding in rock and roll. Only when they slow down on the last third does it drag, and even then the Sabbath crunch of the guitars counts for something. The rare live album that sounds genuinely alive. Grade: B+\n\nXênia França, Em Nome da Estrela – Second album from the former Aláfia singer. Samba-touched R&B. Several cover songs. Music and voice flow along silkily. Effortlessly. Professionally. Sometimes boringly. Grade: C+\n\nMari Herzer, Cheia – São Paulo-based DJ and producer, as well as a member of Teto Preta, Herzer’s been on the scene for more than a decade but is releasing what seems to be her first proper solo album. With beats and bleeps she paints metropolitan moods and landscapes. The anxiety-inducing claustrophobia of crammed sidewalks and streets. The collective excitement of crowds. A Zen-like buzz that’s more industrial than pastorale. Individual sounds are simple, but she piles them deeply on top of each other for a rewarding complexity in a manner that recalls those time-lapse city shots where lights, people, cars, whatever rush past in a jerky flow that coheres in an urban symphony. Listen and buy here. Grade: A-\n\nLos Kenya, Siempre Afro-Latino (1968) – Venezuelan salsa band led by Ray Pérez. On this vinyl/digital reissue from London-based Olindo Records, the band speeds through 10 lively tunes that will connect immediately for Fania Records fans. Blaring horn charts? Check. Angular rhythms? Check. High energy singing? Check. Good fun? Of course. Listen and buy here. Grade B+\n\nJuçara Marçal, EPDEB – Extending the electronic experiments of last year’s well-received Delta Estácio Blues, Marçal and Kiko Dinucci team with Jadsa, Guilherme Held, and fellow Clube mate Marcelo Cabral to deepen those ideas. Afro-Brazilian rhythms are more out front, and the instruments recall some of the jagged joys of Encarnado and Metá Metá‘s albums. The only complaint is that it’s over in about 10 minutes. Listen and buy here. Grade: A-\n\nIara Rennó, Oríkì – Due to the massive size of the Brazilian slave trade, undisguised African culture fared better there than it did in States, perhaps most clearly in religion, where home influences that were subsumed within Christianity in the north survived in Brazil. The Yoruba orixás (spirits), continued to be worshipped, and have played an important role in Afro-Brazilian culture and music. Rennó’s devotion to her country’s musical and cultural heritage was apotheosized on her magnum opus, Macunaíma Ópera Tupi, which turned Mário de Andrade’s classic modernist novel into a musical and album. About the time Rennó was working on that album, she also began to explore the Afro-Brazilian religions. Her latest release is the fruition of that turn. Thirteen tracks over an hour meditate musically, lyrically and spiritually upon the orixás and their gifts. Even without understanding a word, the swirling, serene, but funky music gives up a deeply spiritual impulse you can grok even if you don’t believe. Long-ish tracks lure you in trance-like while dense arrangements tickle the ears with details you can grab onto or let flit by as you lose yourself in the mood. Along with Macunaíma and Arco, this is Rennó’s most ambitious, and successful, solo work. One of many of the children (literally as well as artistically in her case) of the Vanguarda Paulistana scene that electrified Brazilian music in the ’80s and ’90s, Rennó has been a leading figure in the artistic revivification of MPB traditions for two decades. As her latest reminds, outside of the Clube da Encruza, maybe no one has been more consistent in contributing to the gush of great music that’s flowed from São Paulo and beyond. Listen and buy here. Grade: A\n\nTom Zé, Língua Brasileira – Thirty years deep into the second act that made him an international cult favorite, Zé has shown some signs of slowing down. His most recent studio albums sounded fine, but diminished. His rate of release slowed down. (This is his first new studio album since 2017.) But goosed by playwright Felipe Hirsch, Zé rouses himself for another strong one. The music was part of a play Língua Brasileira, which recently wrapped up its run in São Paulo, that explored the creation of the Brazilian language. So national pride is wrapped up with colonialism, slavery and other disturbing realities that made the present possible. None of which denies the love of that language. The present and all that is good about it lives off the crimes of the past. Just as Brazil’s language depends on those crimes, so, too, its music, to which Zé has lovingly devoted his life through both homage and deconstruction. In these 11 tracks, ten of which were written for the play, Zé doesn’t break new ground. He still explores ways to make smooth jagged and awkward groove. He still makes music that sounds deeply Brazilian, but also from another dimension. If his tricks—prickly guitars, mocking/supportive femme choruses, industrial riffs nimbly shifting, mutating bass lines—are old hat by this point, they’re still good and largely unequaled by anyone else. I wish I could appreciate the lyrics more than merely theoretically. You’ve got to live Brazilian Portuguese to really get a meditation on its existence. But as a U.S. of American I can admire any attempt to make sense of a complicated legacy in politically stressed times where any form of patriotism is suspect but a love of what you know and emerged from can’t simply be denied. If reactionaries make us recoil from our histories and contexts, they also remind us that there are things we want to preserve from them. Like music. So artists like Zé explore a conservatism that does what is says (conserves) without oppressing or alienating or pillaging. The past can’t be undone, but it doesn’t have to curse the future. Listen here. Grade: B+\n\nTruth be told, I only got into the game about two thirds of the way through the decade. Elza Soares’ A Mulher do Fim do Mundo and Fabiano do Nascimento’s Dança dos Tempos made a splash stateside in 2015-2016. Jason Gubbels’ review of Romulo Fróes’ Por Elas Sem Elas sent me down an algorithmed rabbit hole and turned my ears southward for the rest of the decade as I discovered a ferment in Brazilian music as potent as it was in the late ‘60s/early ‘70s. Some 500 reviews later—most of them from this decade—I don’t regret the ear time devoted there. I haven’t been as excited or broadly engaged in new music since probably the early ‘90s.\n\nBelow is the first of three summarizing projects I’ll do before decade’s end. These are the artists whose work has powered Brazilian music and tickled my ears.\n\n1. Clube da Encruza – The plan was to include them separately. They—Metá Metá, Romulo Fróes, Rodrigo Campos—have done enough to earn their own to earn separate slots on this list. Heck, after practically flipping a coin to settle it, I had Fróes first and Metá Metá second on the draft. (Campos was sixth.) But as I wrote the entries, I kept cross referencing. Praising one meant including the others. Loose though this collective is—looser than the Mekons or P-Funk—it’s still a unit of some kind. Where would I put those Passo Torto collaborations if I separated the entries? How could I squeeze Marcelo Cabral’s critical background contributions in? Together and separately, Fróes, Campos, Cabral, Kiko Dinucci, Juçara Marçal, Thiago França and Sérgio Machado have made some of the finest music on the planet this decade. They’ve made the definitive Brazilian music of the decade in my opinion. The vast scope of their work—I count 52 (!) releases plus at least 27 significant contributions to recordings outside the collective—guarantees them a page in the history of Brazilian music in the ’10s, but the quality in the midst of that quantity is the truly astounding achievement. Contrary to some narratives, Brazilian music didn’t dry up after the mid-70s. But it’s also true that I haven’t heard an overall energy in Brazilian music this intoxicating since that time. It’s impossible to imagine summing up Brazil’s musical 2010s without giving the bulk of attention to the Clube.\n\nFrom Fróes’ despairing arty sambas to Campos’ slick, twisted funky ones to Meta Meta’s explosive Afro-Brazilian punky ones, the collective drew inspiration from Oswald Andrade’s cultural cannibalism to make some of the most compelling Brazilian music since the tropicálistas drew from the same well of “antropofagia”. Their radicalized regurgitation of DIY’s arty anarchism within Brazilian musics looked backward and forward simultaneously as they demonstrated that samba and its cousins still had a place in a living musical culture. Neither retro nor cut off from the past, the Clube imagined how a century’s worth of recorded musical traditions could be reheard in a world where Elvis Presley and James Brown and the Velvet Underground and Ornette Coleman had reworked expectations. Not that the Clube sounded like any of those, but they lived in a Brazil, a world, where those American influences couldn’t be ignored. So they paid attention while remembering Nelson Cavaquinho, Cartola, Itamar Assumpção, Elza Soares and a host of their Brazilian predecessors. Soares is particularly instructive because their work with her has added a brilliant coda to an already legendary career. Soares wasn’t the only artist drawn into their orbit: Juliana Perdigão, Jards Macale, Lurdez da Luz, Criolo, Alessandra Leão, and others have made notable albums in league with at least some of the Clube members.\n\nAll of which was done while receiving little attention outside Brazil. Some English language coverage of Soares—notably Sounds and Colours—gave the Clube and samba sujo (dirty samba) its due, but elsewhere they were rarely acknowledged or noted as mere sidekicks for some of the artists they collaborated with. Even in Brazil they remained somewhat marginal figures outside of critical and artistic circles. Metá Metá’s monthly streams on Spotify edged past 80,000 as the decade ended, but Campos remained stuck around 20,000 while Fróes was down around 7,000. Yet pay attention to who follows them on Twitter and it’s a who’s who of Brazilian music and music journalism. Track down year-end lists from Brazilian music critics, and their albums keep appearing. To explain VU’s impact on popular music, Brian Eno claimed that while only 10,000 people bought The Velvet Underground and Nico, they all went on to form bands. Perhaps something similar is the case here.\n\nAlready the productions and guest appearances Clube members make across Brazilian music demonstrate their impact. Without their collaborations, Brazilian music would have sounded very different this decade. The Clube aren’t the only heroes of Brazilian music in the ‘10s, but they sit at the center of a scene that made São Paulo and its musicians as interesting as swinging London or ‘70s NYC punk. Which is why I can’t separate them into their distinct recording units in the end. Fróes, Campos, Dinucci, Marçal, França, Cabral, Machado, Metá Metá, Passo Torto, Sambanzo, A Espetacular Charanga do França, MarginalS, and all the other spinoffs are a collective movement and moment worth noting in a time when niche marketing and philosophical preferences have made monocultures and metanarratives passe. The Clube reminds us that scenes can bind together and create futures for cultures even in an age when capitalism’s radical individualism pushes us to be islands of consumption unto ourselves. No contemporary music I heard this decade anywhere compelled me to dig deeper. In a way, this blog is a love letter to the Clube and the musical culture it’s inspired this decade. So I guess this entry and their ranking in this list is just my way of saying thanks for all the music.\n\nFive fab tracks: Metá Metá, “Logun”; Romulo Fróes, “Barulho Feio”; Rodrigo Campos, “Funatsu”; Passo Torto, “A Música da Mulher Morta”; Juçara Marçal, “Damião”.\n\n2. Baco Exu do Blues – Baco didn’t come out of nowhere in 2017. He’d been around for a few years, and showed some promise. But the startling brilliance of Esú, followed a year later by the even better Bluesman, has made the Bahian rapper’s career rise seem meteoric. And all the praise is earned. With a dense rapping style that favors explosive emotion over verbal technique, he addresses racism and black experience in Brazil with a directness and insight that inspires and unsettles. He finds producers able to express both his blackness and his Brazilianness. His pace is breathtaking: nearly an album a year for three years plus half a dozen or so non-album singles. He’s said he wants to be Brazil’s Kanye West, but he should aim higher. If he keeps this up level of quality and insight up we’re talking Brazil’s Public Enemy.\n\nFab five tracks: “Capitães de Areia”, “Imortais e Fatais”, “Banho do Sol”, “Girassóis de Van Gogh”, “Kanye West da Bahia”\n\n3. Elza Soares – She was already a legend. Her long career and compelling biography lifted her to the top ranks of Brazil’s popular singers. By the ‘10s she’d been in semi-retirement for several years. Then, she sang a song on Cacá Machado’s 2013 album Eslavosamba, which celebrated the burgeoning São Paulo scene. Next thing you know she’s working with the Clube da Encruza on two startling, avant-garde samba albums that sounded like nothing she’d ever done. A Mulher do Fim do Mundo (The Woman at the End of the World), is probably the most internationally acclaimed Brazilian album of the decade. After a solid followup, Deus é Mulher, with the Clube, she showed she was still in charge of her career, broke with those musicians and released a funk album this year that included a collaboration with BaianaSystem. While Soares’ voice is shot, her charisma and smarts remain intact even as she turned 80 in 2017. Compare her three albums this decade and you can hear how she adapts to the style she is singing and imprints her persona on the music to make it her own. She’s already planning another album for 2020.\n\nFab five tracks: Cacá Machado, “Sim”; Elza Soares, “Benedita”; Metá Metá, “Okuta Yangi No. 2”; Elza Soares, “Banho”; Elza Soares, “Libertação”\n\n4. Carne Doce – Goiânia’s Carne Doce was Brazil’s best straight rock band of the ‘10s. Not that they rocked out that much. Bassist Anderson Maia and drummer Richardo Machado were a rhythm section capable of laying back while remaining intense. Guitarists Macloys Aquino and João Victor Santana showed off fluid chops while rarely one-upping the songs. And while singer Salma Jô’s voice might be an acquired taste, her charisma is indisputable. Over three albums they honed their songwriting skills and while developing the kind of deep, rewarding instrumental interplay rock bands did in the ‘70s before the cult of musical technique ruined the fun. Smart. Sexy. Songful. Not a bad combination.\n\nFive fab tracks: “Fruta Elétrica”, “Benzin”, “Princesa”, “Açaí”, “Nova Nova”\n\n5. Daniel Ganjaman – Producer/musician Ganjaman (nee Daniel Sanchez Takara) has been behind much of the best music of the decade. Ganjaman co-founded the producer’s collective Instituto in the ‘00s before going on to establish his own career as a leading producer in Brazilian music. More importantly, he hosted the famous Seleta Coletiva music party at Studio SP. The parties began in 2006, but by 2009-10 they had grown into a massive interaction of Paulista artists that juiced collaborations that played out across dozens of records over this decade. Without those parties, SP’s 2010s would have been very different and less fertile. Ganjaman’s production career continued strongly, too. Two of his more notable jobs were producing all of Criolo’s albums of the ‘10s (with the Clube da Encruza’s Marcelo Cabral) and BaianaSystem’s two hit albums. He also guided the posthumous completion of a number of slain rapper Sabotage’s unfinished tracks on the acclaimed self-titled album.\n\nFive fab tracks: Criolo, “Subirusdoistiozin”; Criolo, “Casa de Paelão”; Sabotage, “Respeito É Lei”; BaianaSystem, “Jah Jah Revolta, Pt. 2”; BaianaSystem, “CertoPeloCertoh”\n\n6. Tulipa Ruiz – Her father was a member of Itamar Assumpção’s seminal backing band Isca de Polícia. Her brother was in the short-lived ’00s dynamo DonaZica. But in the ‘10s Ruiz emerged from a career of background work to establish herself as one of the top Brazilian singers of the decade. Teaming with her brother, she moved effortlessly from indie pop to Brazilian rock to dance music to samba, with each move extending her reach and deepening her art as good albums got better as the decade went on. Besides her own stuff, she appeared upon dozens of albums in support roles, prized by her fellow artists for her distinctive singing, most notably a squiggle swoop that squeezes out a high register, attention grabbing whoop at the end. Comfortable singing straight or adding a dash of zaniness to electrify the moment (she has to have some treasured B-52 albums stashed away), Ruiz never settled for rehash. Even when, on Tu, she reworked previous numbers, the do-overs were distinctive and often improvements upon tunes that were strong in the first place.\n\nFive fab tracks: “Só Sei Dançar Com Você”; “Like This”; “Expirou”; “Pedrinho” (2018 version), “Elixir”\n\n7. Dona Onete – Onete’s love of music translated initially into an academic career due in no small part to an unsupportive first husband who quashed her performing dreams, but upon retirement the septuagenarian (now octogenarian) began singing in local haunts, which ended up leading to the recording career she’d wanted as a young woman. Working on a variation of the northern carimbó style that emphasized romance and passion over traditional subjects in the genre, she established herself as a performer whose charisma and fun blew past any limitations presented by her aged voice. Even better, she had more than one album in her. Her sophomore release expanded her stylistic grasp and toughened her grooves. She followed that up with a live album that is her gift to history and dropped a solid third album this year. Love, sex and good music aren’t just for the kids.\n\nFive fab tracks: “Jamburana”, “Banzeiro”, “Queimoso e Tremoso”, “Propesta Indecente (Live)”, “Tambor do Norte”\n\n8. Tom Zé – Rising from decades of obscurity in the ‘90s thanks to David Byrne’s patronage, Zé went on to be arguably the dominant Brazilian artist of the ‘90s and ‘00s, and although he’s slowed slightly as he entered his 70s and now 80s, he still had a strong decade leading with two more winning additions (Tropicália Lixo Lógico and Vira Lata Na Via Láctea) to his classic catalog before closing it out with a couple of minor, but still enticing efforts. His collaborations with younger musicians and still edgy music showed that this isolated oddball made the future of Brazilian music in the ’70s even if no one knew it at the time. You figure he can’t have much left in the tank, but considering he’s topped in this list by two more octogenarians, you wonder what they have in the water down there in Brazil.\n\nFive fab tracks: “O Motorbói e Maria Clara”, “Aviso aos Passageiros”, “Banca de Jornal”, “Guga na Lavagem”; “Sexo”\n\n9. BaianaSystem – The trio of Russo Passapusso, Roberto Barreto and Marcelo Seco plus whatever friends or collaborators decide to join them in the studio or onstage, emerged as dynamic heirs to Jorge Ben’s pioneering samba-funk. Their music looked to Africa, back to Brazil and then out to the African musica diaspora. Their politics excoriated right wingers while giving hope for everyone else. They teamed with Elza Soares for a great single in 2019. And reports say they’re one of the best live acts in Brazil. Their two albums this decade, plus a strong Passapusso solo effort, may not add up to much music quantitywise, but the quality is there. Maybe they’ll write a Brazilian “Stand Down Margaret” for Bolsonaro to start the next decade off right.\n\nFive fab tracks: “Lucro (Descomprimindo)”, “Playsom”, “Barravenida, Pt. 2”, “Água”, “Sulamericano”\n\n10. Juliana Perdigao – Beginning the decade as a member of Graveola, singer/clarinetist Juliana Perdigao participated in their solid sophomore album before breaking off into her solo career. Fusing Beatlesesque art-pop sensibilities with a love of her national musics, she proved both an adept cover artist—stealing songs from Romulo Fróes and Tulipa Ruiz—as well as a good songwriter. Her first album tended proggy, in a good way, but by the end of the decade she was writing tight, off-kilter songs that bent instruments to arrangements while still having the musical flourishes that keep the art in her pop.\n\nFive fab tracks: “Recomeçaria”, “Céu Vermelho”, “Ó”, “Pierrô Lunático”, “Felino”\n\n11. Criolo – Following an undistinguished debut album late last decade, Sao Paulo’s Criolo emerged as one of his nation’s most important rappers of the ‘10s. His 2011 release Nó Na Orelha, where he found decade-long partners with producers Daniel Ganjaman and Marcelo Cabral, is considered by many a landmark in Brazilian hip hop. Throughout the ‘00s Brazil’s hip hop scenes had shown more signs of moving past recycled North American funk beats toward a more distinctly national sound, so while Criolo may not have been the first to push the music in new directions, his ambition—embracing Africa, Jamaica, Latin America and Brazil—helped popularize new sounds in national hip hop. He deepened that sound on the follow-up, Convoque Seu Buda, and tied in more strongly to São Paulo’s vibrant scene before moving to an excellent straight samba album by the decade’s end.\n\nFive fab tracks: “Sucrilhos”, “Pegue pra Ela”, “Fio de Prumo (Padê Onã)”, “Chuva Ácida”; “Dilúvio de Solidão”\n\nAs carnival 2018 prepares to crest, it’s time to celebrate Brazil’s best musical releases from 2017.\n\nTulipa Ruiz, Tu EP (A-)\n\nCriolo, Espiral de Ilusão (Deluxe Edition) (A-)\n\nKiko Dinucci, Cortes Curtos (A-)\n\nBaco Exu do Blues, Esú (A-)\n\nAkira Presidente, Fa7her (A-)\n\nCelso Sim, O Amor Entrou Como um Raio (Celso Sim Canta Batatinha) (A-)\n\nRimas e Melodias, Rimas e Melodias (A-)\n\nApanhador Só, Meio Que Tudo É Um (A-)\n\nTribalistas, Tribalistas (A-)\n\nLuiza Brina e O Liquidificador, Tão Tá (A-)\n\nHonorable mentions in alphabetical order (all = B+ grade):\n\nNina Becker, Acrílico\n\nBoogarins, Lá Vem a Morte EP\n\nCarne Doce, Carne Doce No Complexio Estúdio EP\n\nCorte, Corte\n\nDon L, Roteiro pra Ainouz, Vol. 3 EP\n\nA Espetacular Charanga do Franca, Bomba, Suor e Bapho EP\n\nKafé, Kafé\n\nLinn da Quebrada, Panjuba\n\nFlora Matos, Eletrocardiograma\n\nMetá Metá, Gira\n\nRincon Sapiência, Galangra Livre\n\nTrupe Chá de Boldo, Verso\n\nJúlia Vargas, Pop Banana\n\nSharp-eyed readers may note the Dinucci album listed in the third spot only received a B from me last spring. (Even that B was a last minute upgrade over the C+ I had been planning to give it.) When the album started appearing in multiple best of the year lists from Brazil, I returned to it and couldn’t believe I’d missed it so badly. Although Dinucci and his main band Metá Metá are two of the main reasons I’ve chosen to immerse so deeply in current Brazilian music, I missed hearing how good both Cortes Curtos and MM3 were when released. The review is updated on the Kiko Dinucci page.\n\nAbove you will find no Rei Vadio or Metal, Metal or Composiçao—those stellar albums you’re convinced you’ll be listening to the rest of your life. Indeed, most of my favorite albums from 2017 were jazz albums. Geographically and sonically, the closest I got to a life list Brazilian album was Colombian act the Meridian Brothers’ ¿Dónde Estás María? Which isn’t to say I didn’t find lots of good music. I enjoy the ten albums above thoroughly, and several of them I suspect I will be listening to for years to come. Even when you get down into the honorable mentions there is plenty of worthy music (especially that Nina Becker album).\n\nSince there were no standout albums, ranking the top ten was a challenge. The top six seemed pretty interchangeable and most of them (plus the number eight album) were in contention for the top slot at some point. In the end, I just went with which one I wanted to listen to most and, to my surprise, that was the Tulipa Ruiz EP. Normally EPs are a bit short to consider for the album of the year slot, but that release—half new songs, half remakes—kept popping up in my listening lists. I could make a strong case that Baco Exu do Blues’ strong debut deserves to be the album of the year, but in this case utility won out since whatever quality difference among these albums was insignificant.\n\nAll but the last three appeared on at least one (and often multiple) year end best of lists of Brazilian critics so I guess cultural differences are not barriers to shared tastes. The only one of those albums I hadn’t heard before the lists appeared was the Akira Presidente. The biggest surprises for not being included on other best of lists were the well reviewed Tribalistas and Apanhador Só albums. The former is an excellent album, but it does fall short of the classic 2002 debut as well as several of Marisa Monte’s solo albums, so I suspect that deflated its end-of-year support. The latter was a more interesting story: Not long after its strongly reviewed release, guitarist Felipe Zacanaro was accused of emotionally abusive treatment by a former girlfriend, including lots of cheating and one case of physical violence in which her finger was (accidentally she said) broken. #MeToo isn’t just an American phenomenon, and I’m betting the stories, which Zacanaro didn’t deny, sank the album’s critical prospects. Although I generally don’t believe in punishing the art for the artists’ moral failings, I also don’t feel particularly sorry that the band’s best album by far ended up all but ignored in the year-end tallies. Still, it is a good album.\n\nIn all I reviewed 85 albums that were released in 2017. (I have a few more up my sleeve, but none—I think—that will make their way onto the list above.) In addition, I listened to another 167 albums released in 2017 I decided weren’t worth writing up. They weren’t all bad, but if one is higher than a B, then I failed as a reviewer. Most would be in the C range or lower. Of course more than 252 albums were released in Brazil last year, but based on coverage by the Brazilian sites I peruse for leads as well as the year end best of lists I searched for regularly over the past two months, I think I’ve done a solid job of listening to the significant releases. To brag a little, I can’t imagine you will find a more thorough summary of 2017 Brazilian releases written in English. If you can, please let me know. I want to read that site."
