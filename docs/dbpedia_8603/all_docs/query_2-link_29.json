        "text": "Cultural Origins of Latin Jazz begin with Cuba, New York City in particular, the States and Brazil.\n\nFollowing rhythms and styles of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music, blended with percussion, giving a balanced fusion of European and African sound.\n\nLatin Jazz was a result of a long process of nteraction between American and Cuban music styles intertwined together to form 20th Century New Orleans’ early Jazz, that had a distinctive syncopated (accents transitioned to weaker beats) rhythmic character.\n\nThe city’s well renowned pianist and composer at the time, Jelly Roll Morton, referred to the Latin influence on Jazz as a “Spanish Tinge”.\n\nThe Cuban Habanera Rhythm was very quickly adopted by American Musicians (a syncopated four beat pattern) and could be heard in many of their compositions; especially the popular 1914’s St Louis Blues by W. C. Handy.\n\nSounds of American Jazz eventually spread through to the Caribbean simultaneously as Latin American melodies and dance rhythms made their way to North America Regions.\n\nAcross the entire region, both musicians and bands became more versed with the musical languages, where larger bands soon expanded their own repertoire into congas and rumbas, two types of Afro-Cuban dance music.\n\nDrummers of Afro-Cuban style music played a fundamental role in developing Latin Jazz from the late 1940s through to the 1960s, as it gave the genre its visibly inexhaustible stream of rhythmic patterns, phrasings, and styles all through the means of percussion.\n\nAs time progressed, by the early 21st century,Latin Jazz gained popularity and critical acclaim as well as became one of the most dynamic and diverse components of the Jazz World."
