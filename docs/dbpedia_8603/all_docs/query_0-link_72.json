        "text": "On Wednesday night the Brazilian songwriter Marisa Monte told a sold-out audience at the Beacon Theater (where she returns on Friday) that she was “very happy to be in Brazil last week.” That was when protests spread across the country, first over bus fare increases and then over far more widespread discontent. “I was able to see something that maybe means a new way of democracy in Brazil,” she said.\n\nThat led her into a new unrecorded song that she wrote in December with her frequent collaborator, Arnaldo Antunes, and her band’s guitarist, Dadi: “Dizem (Quem Me Dera),” “They Say (How I Wish).” It’s a utopian vision of progress and hope with a touch of the late Beatles: “We have the intelligence/To bring an end to violence,” it vowed.\n\nThat aura of benevolence runs through her songs, burnished by one of the most exquisite voices in Brazilian music. Poised and serene, honoring melodies by gliding through them with a minimum of embellishment, Ms. Monte cradles each word and makes each phrase glow from within. In Brazil, she is a superstar; “Tribalistas,” her 2002 collaboration with Mr. Antunes and the Bahian hit maker Carlinhos Brown, was a million-seller.\n\nAlthough Ms. Monte grew up with Brazilian tradition — she produced an album for the Velha Guarda of Portela, one of Rio de Janeiro’s most respected samba schools — her songs also hint at pop outside Brazil’s borders, from flamenco to Motown to the soft-shoe swing of “Verdade, uma Ilusão” (“Truth, an Illusion”), the name of her current tour. At the Beacon, she was backed by a rock band — including three members of Nação Zumbi, a renowned band from Recife — and a string quartet, sharing burnished arrangements in a set that relied on ballads. But simple pop prettiness is not all she’s after.\n\nMs. Monte, who released her debut album in 1989, follows through on the modernist and postmodernist ideas that have infused Brazilian popular music since the 1960s. She opened the concert by herself, singing “Blanco,” a Portuguese adaptation of an excerpt from a complex major work by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz: “Perception is conception,” she purred.\n\nThrough the concert, she was surrounded and enfolded in video imagery from leading Brazilian visual artists (whose names she took pains to list at the end of the set): abstractions, cityscapes, cascades of typography, a rush of blurred faces. And her love songs often come with a twist, like “E.C.T.,” in which a love letter is opened by a postal clerk who turns it into a hit song, or “Beija Eu” (“Kiss Me”), which toys with its rhyming Portuguese syllables while its meter shifts between 3/4 and 4/4.\n\nBut the intellectual underpinnings of Ms. Monte’s songs are always subsumed by the pleasures of melody and by the comfort of her voice: the poised tension and release, the delicacy and yearning. For most pop musicians, such alluring surfaces would be achievement enough; for Ms. Monte, they lead deeper."
