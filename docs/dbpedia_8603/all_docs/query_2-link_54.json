        "text": "From Poland's burgeoning folk roots scene come two new and distinct bands. Both are trios, yet each group earmarks their locale.\n\nWoWaKin are from the Mazovia region, an area that includes Warsaw, in the northeast of Poland. Each group creates thick clouds of trance-inducing sound built on traditional rhythms from the Polish countryside. The trio offers an array of foxtrots, tangos, polkas, oberkas, and more on their debut album. WoWaKin are comprised of Paula Kinaszewska (violin, vocals); Mateusz Wachowiak (accordion); and Bartlomiej Wozniak (drums and sound design). Their repertoire borrows from the Polish areas of Kielce, Radom, and Sanniki.\n\nKapela Maliszów is a family band from a small village in the Lower Beskids mountain range, located in southeast Poland, bearing towards Slovakia. The ensemble is comprised of Jan Malisz and his two children, Zuzanna (age 14) and Kacper (age 18). Jan Malisz anchors the group with his basolia, a Polish instrument reminiscent of the cello. Zuzanna sings and accompanies on percussion and Kacper plays both violin and nyckelharpa.\n\nRead Lee Blackstone's reviews and listen to some tracks from each album.\n\nMichal Shapiro was at WOMEX 2017, held in Katowice, Poland, and filmed each of these excellent ensembles.\n\nThe sound and spirit of Zimbabwe and Mozambique runs through the heart of Timbila and Chartwell Dutiro's double album collection Sadza with the Head of a Mouse. Timbila is a New York-based band, led by Nora Balaban, that met in Zimbabwe in 1997. Since then they have delved into the rich heritage of southern Africa's songs and instruments, adding their own East Village multicultural explorations to the music. Here they are joined by vocalist and mbira master Chartwell Dutiro, a former member of Thomas Mapfumo and the Blacks Unlimited who now resides in the U.K.\n\nStrange Circles is the debut offering from Bokanté, an ensemble put together by Snarky Puppy's Michael League. The group's name translates from Creole to \"exchange\" in English and the eight musicians from four continents have developed a cohesive, layered multicultural sound that serves as a foundation for Malika Tirolien's rich vocals sung in Creole and French. While in Canada, League heard the voice of Tirolien, who hails from Guadeloupe and now lives in Toronto. The meeting inspired the creation of Bokanté, with League and Tirolien collaborating on the music and Tirolien handling the lyrics. They are joined by fellow Snarky Puppy guitarists Chris McQueen and Bob Lanzetti, percussionists Jamey Haddad, André Ferrari, and Keita Ogawa, as well as Roosevelt Collier on pedal and lap steel guitars.\n\nBoth reviews include full tracks from the albums.\n\nKries is a legendary Croatian folk-rock band that has thankfully resurfaced with Selo Na Okuke/Village Tracks, eight years after their previous album . Understanding Kries' message of solidarity and unity is essential to their mission. The band formed after the raging of the Balkan War in the 1990s, and the musicians that comprise Kries are drawn from countries caught up in - or touched by - the conflict that engulfed the Balkan region.\n\nThe founder of Kries is Mojmir Novakovi&cacute;. Novakovi&cacute;, like many musicians at the forefront of a modern revival of traditional folk music, sought to infuse the songs of Croatia and the Balkans with a progressive twist. Accompanying Novakovi&cacute; in Kries are folk luminaries such as Andor Vegh (a Balkan music expert) on bagpipes and flute, and multi-instrumentalist Ivo Letunic on lijerica (a three-stringed, bowed instrument), and the Serbian gusle (a one-stringed, bowed instrument). There is a roaring percussive section, comprised of Ivan Leva&ccaron;i&cacute; on drums, and Krešimir Oreški on percussive instruments including the djembe. The group is fleshed out with Erol Zejnilovi&cacute; on guitar, and Konrad Lovren&ccaron;i&cacute; on bass. As a result, Kries combines traditional folk music instrumentation alongside the elements of a rock band... Read Lee Blackstone's full review online, listen to some full tracks, and watch some marvelous videos.\n\nYou can also hear a few tracks of the album in an archived edition of RootsWorld Radio #249.\n\nKries' Selo Na Okuke / Village Tracks is our selection for Music of the Month in November. It was donated by the artists and Riverboat Records, so all proceeds go to support the magazine and radio program. We thank them for their generous support.\n\nYou have to imagine Puglia, the part of southern Italy that juts into the Mediterranean Sea The south of Italy has a long history of joy and sadness; riven with poverty, many inhabitants have moved away. As with much of Italy, the influence of the Catholic Church is felt here, hot under the sun; but, there is a persistent pulse of heathenism and rhythm that runs underfoot. Puglia is the land of the taranta, the spider, which bit women (and some men) for thousands of years, causing distressed families to buy the service of musicians so that the afflicted could dance their poisoning away. The Church conflated the spider with Saint Paul, entwining in folk song a sacred/secular eroticism that feels like magic.\n\nAmongst the musicians at the forefront of the first 1970s revivalist wave was the Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino (CGS). Co-founder Daniele Durante passed on the group's leadership to his son, Mauro Durante, in 2007, and Canzoniere is the fourth album made under his tenure.\n\nThe Albanian cellist Redi Hasa and the Puglian vocalist Maria Mazzotta comprise the project Hasa-Mazzotta. The two musicians seek to explore connections between their musical traditions, and do so in experimental ways. Novilunio is intimate, bridging folk, jazz, and even cabaret in a bewitching program.\n\nRead Lee Blackstone's in-depth article about pizzica tarantata and how these artists are rooted in place, searching in other places for new sounds and new connections, yet always circling back home. We also have full tracks from each album and some audio excerpts of others.\n\nThe Art of Allegory\n\nMichael Stone brings us the music of Brussels based Tunisian singer Ghalia Benali, in collaboration with her musicians and the Belgian brass ensemble Mâäk. Together they find lyrical inspiration in classical and contemporary love poetry of the Arabic- and Persian-speaking world on the album MwSOUL.\n\nGhalia Benali appears again on one of the two recordings presented next, both the work of an innovative group of artists. Zefiro Torna is no stranger to treating the old as new, and vice versa. In addition to combining a love of medieval and Renaissance music with jazz and other modern modes of expression, the Flemish vocal-instrumental ensemble has worked extensively with performers, stage directors, and individual artists to widen the scope of their repertoire while also hinting at universal impulses within it.\n\nTwo recent CDs highlight the adventurous spirit behind such collaborations. Scattered Rhymes is created with the Frank Vaganée Trio. The Allegory of Desire finds them in centuries-spanning musical settings of the Biblical \"Song of Songs\" in conversation with traditional and original Arabic songs interpreted by Ghalia Benali and the Vocalconsort Berlin. Tyran Grillo explores the allegorical connections between these two worlds.\n\nTwo albums of Irish music: one excellent label, and one superb musician in common. These are busy times in contemporary Irish music as, similarly across the globe, a wealth of new music is being created by musicians. Back in October 2010, The Irish Times speculated that we are in the midst of a Golden Age of Irish music, and it is hard to argue with the evidence.\n\nConcertina player Jack Talty's In Flow is an example of straight-ahead, no frills musicianship. Talty hails from County Clare, and his album is full of nods to his locale.\n\nImbas is Ensemble Ériu's second album. The title is an Old Irish word describing creativity, inspiration, and prophetic knowledge. Talty is part of a larger group here, which features fiddle, clarinets, Pguitar, double bass, flute, marimba, and drums. Each of the tracks on Imbas has a pedigree, collected by musicians and researchers from around Ireland. In Ensemble Ériu's hands, the source material is transformed into works which sound as if they were composed by the minimalist school of John Adams, Terry Riley, and Philip Glass. Read Lee Blackstone's full reviews and listen to some songs from both albums\n\nNew sounds from Iberia\n\nValencian music has gained popularity in recent years and the Valencian folk band El Diluvi is making a name throughout the Catalan-speaking areas. El Diluvi fuses Mediterranean, Celtic, Balkan and Latin sounds on Ànima, the group's fourth release. Musically they cover the same territory made popular in the Basque Country by Gozategi, and sometimes reminiscent of Italy's La Lionetta. The seven-piece band featuring vocalist Flora Semprere, and vocalist/ violinist David Payà, began as a tribute to 80s singer Ovidi Montllor, also of Alcoi. On Motius, in 2014, the group began to develop its own signature style. And this advanced further in Alegria, with the social activism of songs such as the feminist anthem \"I tu Sols tu.\" Here on Ànima we have eleven new tracks that explore the territory of love... Join David Cox in Valencia.\n\nEurope has a whole host of bands oriented around pipe and wind instruments. A whole subset of this revivalist folk genre has morphed into the predictable mash-up of loud pipe mash-ups with heavy metal, as with Germany's In Extremo. Some pipe collectives play it more 'straight,' as with Germany's Corvus Corax, or Italy's Barbarian Pipe Band. Portugal has also seen modern band experimenting with pipes and ancient instruments the progressive folk bands Dazkarieh, and Mandrágora, come to mind. Albaluna are a rising band that one might be tempted to fit in with the neo-pagan ritualist music of Europe, but like the other Portuguese bands, more is going on in the band's music than one might expect. Nau Dos Corvos is full of head-on rollicking tunes with influences that range beyond the Celtic to Ottoman and Jewish music, as well. Read Lee Blackstone's review and listen to some of the music.\n\nA Trio of Nordic Trios\n\nLee Blackstone presents three different Nordic bands that practice different approaches to traditional and composed acoustic music. Väsen and Zephyr hail from Sweden and they are made up of veteran folk musicians, while Vrang is Norwegian and represents a younger generation. All are unique and wonderful artistic trios.\n\nVäsen surely needs no introduction after twenty-eight years together; Brewed is the band's seventeenth album under the name. Olov Johansson is the virtuosic nyckelharpa player; Roger Tallroth anchors the group on guitar; and Mikael Marin sets dreams adrift on his viola. This time out, Väsen treat listeners to a collection of original tunes\n\nZephyr is configured not of string instruments, but of flutes. Görån Mansson, Jonas Simonson (from Groupa), and Richard Ekre Suzzi utilize a variety of wind instruments from Sweden and afar, such as the bamboo Bansuri flute. An all-flute trio can certainly have an ethereal sound, as the band demonstrates, but Zephyr go well beyond such stereotyping and construct compositions that indulge in global influences in their October Ocean...\n\nThe Norwegian trio Vrang features Jon Hjellum Brodal, Tuva Faerden, and Maja Gravermoen Toresen on hardanger fiddles, fiddles, lyres, and the occasional mandolin. Their full-length debut, SæterSoul, is beautifully produced, with plenty of space and depth that let the low mellow tones of the hardanger fiddle grow and the sprightly lyres shine. Vrang are notable in that they combine a minimalist approach and a sly pop sensibility\n\nRead about these trios in Lee's reviews, and listen to a song from each.\n\nVrang's SæterSoul is RootsWorld's Music of the Month selection for May.\n\nWell, I never thought I'd be writing a review that begins, \"Kurt Cobain and his band, Nirvana,\" but there you go. These things happen. - CF\n\nKurt Cobain and his band, Nirvana were never known for complex songs or rich dynamics - their formula of quiet 4 and 5 note melodies rotating with loud passages of distortion and shouting created a comforting pattern that made them famous. Cobain once said that he really wanted to play in a Pixies cover band and Nirvana did pose as the crossover point for Seattle's grunge scene onto the Billboard charts of radio pop. So it will come as a bit of a surprise to hear that hidden beneath those simple, pop-rocks tunes lie some complicated musical relationships. It took artists completely removed from Seattle, completely devoid of guitars and totally devoted to dynamics to pick out the gem-like qualities of their songs. Enter Aranis, a quintet from Belgium; players of strings, piano, accordion, flute and double bass. Smells Like Aranis tears those songs apart and reconstructs them as little works of art; sometimes pretty, sometimes weird, always intriguing Listen to a few tracks from the album while you read the editor's review.\n\nNew roots and welcome old routes\n\nSeydou Diabaté, aka Kanazoé, unleashes his technique on the balafon with a talented ensemble on Kanazoé Orkestra's debut full-length release, Miriya. Born in Burkina Faso and now based in France, he and his band offer an impressive, mature record that maintains urgency throughout Kanazoé provides some of the vocals and plays a variety of balafons. His group includes Zaky Diarra on lead vocals, Mamadou Dembélé on ngoni, flute, and vocals, Martin Etienne on saxophones, Stéphane Perruchet on percussion, Elvin Bironien on bass, and Laurent Planells on drums. Alex Brown's review finds a band that sets the bar high and delivers, with confidence and joy.\n\nThe late Tabu Ley Rochereau had a talent for picking great musicians. Just before Rochereau died in 2013, he asked his long-time sax player Modero Mekanisi to keep L'Orchestre Afrisa International going. The eventual result was Melanie, the band's first release in many years. While the unhurried but compelling grooves nostalgically echo west Africa's older, pre-soukous Congolese rumba dance styles, the uniformly meticulous playing is a treat for long-time fans. Marty Lipp shares the music of a band that carries on.\n\nThe treasure of language\n\nHere are a few recordings that explore the power of language; in this case, some lesser know tongues of Europe and the Atlantic. Languages all have their own unique rhythms and meter that are reflected in both the poetry and in the music itself. These three artists offer us a glimpse into their very local worlds, singing (and, in effect, playing) in Karelian, Älvdalska and Faroese. - CF\n\nFirst is a very special recording of music from Sweden, by one of its most interesting and important artists, Lena Willemark. As Lee Blackstone writes, \"Blåferdį (Blue Journey) is a mesmerizing album from an always adventurous Swedish singer and violin player. To realize this work, Willemark wrote a series of poems, in Swedish and in Älvdalska (also called Elfdalian, an ancient Swedish language) which she set to the sounds of a quintet - Willemark on vocals and violin; Emma Reid on violin; Mia Marin on 5-string violin; Mikael Marin on 5-string viola; and Leo Sander on cello; plus percussionist Tina Quartey on numerous drums and bells The music and singing is quite simply, astonishing. The strings act like roots, anchoring these songs, the cello another dark timbre. Quartey's percussion never overwhelms the delicacy and force with which the quintet maneuvers through Willemark's compositions.\"\n\nIn addition to Lee's full review, we have a full song and some excerpts from the album. Ms Willemark also contributed a few words explaining how she came to perform the entire work in Älvdalska (Elfdalian), an ancient dialect from her home region of Älvdalens, in Sweden. And we have a short video of her telling the nativity story in the language. Read the full article.\n\nThe next recording comes from a quintet of vocalists from the Faroe Islands. Kata is an all-female vocal quintet hailing from, and arranging folk tunes of their islands. Kata's precise, rooted singing will appeal to fans of Trio Mediaeval, but they are also influenced by Bulgarian choirs like Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares. The album's tone tends toward cautionary tales of injurious traditions and social mores, as codified in folk stories handed down for generations. Occasionally accompanied by electronics and percussion, the listener is offered a dip into forgotten waters, an experience of vivid melodic and lyrical shapes on Tívils Døtur. Listen to the music and read Tyran Grillo's full review.\n\nFinally, we offer you an audio feature of the music and songs of Karelia, as reinterpreted by Lekkujad, a quartet of musicians based in Helsinki that are exploring new ways to hear music from Karelia, a region that spans the Finnish-Russian border. These four musicians have diverse backgrounds that come together to create something unusual for Karelian music. Listen to a few tracks from their new recording, Tulinbo Ruadieh.\n\nNew Nordic Roots\n\nGroupa holds traditional Nordic folk music in high regard, but they are not afraid of breaking down boundaries and re-creating well established songs in their own way. The trio has been combining the traditional with a curiosity for the experimental for over 30 years. This often means using instruments that are out of the ordinary, including wood, stone and bells. Maria Ezzitouni talked with violinist Mats Edén about the history of the band, what makes them successful, and about the criticism they have faced by striving forward on their own path.\n\nGroupa mixes Nordic folk music with new thinking and innovation on their tenth album, Kind of folk - vol. 1 Sweden. Most of the tracks are their own interpretation of long-established folk traditions from Sweden, with a few pieces composed by the trio of Terje Isungset (percussion), Jonas Simonson (flutes) and Mats Edén (violins). Read Maria's review of the recording and listen to some songs and samples.\n\nThree Audio Features\n\nFirst, we take you to Viljandi Folk Music Festival in Tallinn for a concert with Estonian artist and singer Mari Kalkun and her ensemble of Finnish players, Runorun. The quartet plays variants of the stringed zither common to northern Europe, called kannel, or kantele, along with double bass and percussion. The concert was performed on April 1st of 2016, at Tallinn Music Week, part of the Viljandi Folk Music Festival Showcase. Listen!\n\nNext, a group of musicians from Bristol, England who call themselves Three Cane Whale. These recordings were made in the Old Barn in Kelston, Roundhill, in the south of England, between Bristol and Bath. They play what the ensemble calls folkish minimalist miniatures. The musicians are Alex Vann (mandolin, bowed psaltery, bouzouki, zither, music box, etc), Pete Judge (trumpet, harmonium, dulcitone, glockenspiel, lyre, etc), and Paul Bradley (acoustic guitar, harp, etc). We begin with a set of three pieces that all feature the words and voice of their guest, Jon Hamp and then carry on from there. Listen!\n\nFinally, we hear Albaluna, a folk music ensemble that uses medieval and early folk music from Portugal, and merges it with Turkish and Balkan sounds. We're going to listen to a suite in three parts called \"Sefarad,\" that brings in the Ladino Sephardic traditions of Jews in Andalusia and the Balkans. The three works are:\n\nLa Galana and the Sea\n\nMy daughter\n\nThe Roads of Sirkeci\n\nListen!\n\nAll of these performances are available online with the help and cooperation of the performers, who have generously allowed us to present the music to you. There are links to find out more about each ensemble."
