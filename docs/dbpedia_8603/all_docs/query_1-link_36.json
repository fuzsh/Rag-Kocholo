        "meta_description": "I don't feel that way these days. And I'm curious, what is the band which made you think like that? Because I feel most of the time J-Rock does not any longer keep as much momentums as before in mid 80's ~early 00's. (I don't mean to downplay recent bands, such as OneOK Rock or Radwimps. They're very progressive and unique band. I'm talking about just quantities of scales of the music market.) From early 00's up to date, J-rock bands are outweighed in sales by many pop music group. Even a big J-rock band B'z ranked in no more than10th in 2019. In this sense, they don't have as much popularity as of 2decades ago. And you know, the vocal of One OK rock, Takahiro is not an outlaw. He is very disciplined, and down to earth.😂 |>>rock style songs are almost inexistent in today's most popular songs in Brazil.. I'd say it's same difference, more or less. Thanks for the music live streaming services, a part of the Japanese famous and talented musician (L'Arc-en-Ciel/Utada Hikaru/Miyavi)are aiming for the mainstream, such as billboard or world ranking chart. That means most of the progressive bands are almost taking the abroad criteria into the consideration, imao. And what you saw before in Youtube is the rest of the Japanese music group which is for \"domestic demand\". (I don't say I don't like it though, but it's more or less very similar each other.) They're standardized to profit the sales for their promotion office. Catchy melodies to the targeted layer,(including Anime songs) pretty/good-looking faces and dancing,(like Korean girls group)or having a \"back band\" which has a guitar instrumental(as you saw it)to ensure some cool appearances. But you know, this might look like a rock band but it's actually not. If I may say so, It's more of a fast fashion no more than a style-over-substances. If I have to relate it to our society, it is what I wrote above, imaaaaaaaao. Oh...I might be kicked out if the younger fan of the band hear this, but I'm very convinced of this. they should not be rivaled by the world class progressive band. By the way, I'm not only a rock freak, but also a fan of R&B, pop music, Jazz style, as long as it feels authentic and talented. Recently I'm into Billie Eilish, she is like never before than any other Japanese artist who I knew. So I'm curious, Who is the talented musician in Brazil? |Ohh it's way different as you said! Latina/latino voice is such a vibrant and energetic. But I like Skank, they sound like \"Latino Oasis\" to me. Bruno e Marrone is also good. By the way, You don't need to check out Japanese latest trend do you? If anything, I'll recommend you the past great singer who is likely to match your preferences. I pick out them. 布施明 https://youtu.be/QmZwDdZo1Y4 久保田利伸/juju/三浦大知 https://youtu.be/Ujqg_4rZyQI ASKA https://youtu.be/74IKR0WeKXY 鈴木雅之 https://youtu.be/CZ95wRScgvU MISIA https://youtu.be/JeYJnSuYgrs 宇多田ヒカル https://youtu.be/A_5wTaQKK6c 吉田美和 https://youtu.be/7kpav7qo-fo 加藤登紀子 https://youtu.be/SrUp0YU11BE I feel I knew something more matchy artists but I can't remember it..Hope this would match it. |@deborahorodeski I personally don't listen to them but some of their work are very impressive.
