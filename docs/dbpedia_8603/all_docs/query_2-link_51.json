Soulful, celebratory, and impossible to pin down stylistically, the\n\nalbum is as much an artistic statement of independence as an exploration of Cardinal’s wide-ranging\n\nmusical influences and the transformative process of navigating grief.\n\nThe Edmonton-based singer/songwriter planned to begin work on her third full-length self-released album in 2019. The pandemic changed her timeline, but it was a pair of personal tragedies – the murder of her former partner and father of her child and the death of a friend by suicide – that shaped Boundless Possibilities. “I thought I knew what grief was, but I realized I’d never truly experienced it before,” Cardinal says. “I am now a different person for the rest of my life. I’ll never be the same again.”\n\nCardinal recalls a dream she had the night after the death of her friend. A visitation that inspired the\n\nalbum opener and title track, a spoken word piece underpinned by an ethereal, ambient soundscape that, she says, was the key to unlocking “an exploration of art that I never knew I was capable of creating.\n\nThe words just poured out of me, and I just knew that the track was the title and the theme I wanted to\n\nhave run throughout the album.” Although Boundless Possibilities began as a meditation on loss and the changes that grief, at its rawest and most all encompassing, can result in, it’s far from somber. Instead, over fourteen songs, the record finds Cardinal reflecting on the joy of living and loving, celebrating the connections fuelled by memories and shared experiences that transcend death, the strength of those connections, their impact on her life as an artist, and her evolving relationship with spirituality.\n\nNowhere is that more evident than on the country-tinged lead single ‘Light of the Moon.’ “That was\n\nconceived as a tribute to our musical loved ones and our musical family – even our idols who have passed on,” she says, but also to her son’s father (her former musical partner and the bass player in her first band). “People who may have passed but that we hear in the music we create, that we see written in our words. That felt like a flagship song for the album because it talks about grief but it’s also remembering the joy, the memories. It just felt like it set the tone.”\n\nSome tracks, like ‘I Want To Mean It Pt. 1 & 2,’ which reads like a dialogue with the soul of her friend –\n\nfocus on loss. “We don’t have to say everything for love to be communicated. Sometimes, somebody\n\npasses, and you don’t get to say all the things that you need to. But that’s okay. That song is like a\n\nconversation between us.” Others, such as ‘Every Day’ and ‘The Only Way Out,’ dwell more on the\n\nstrength gained in letting go, honouring those who’ve passed, and finding solace in the indelible\n\nimpressions they’ve made on your life.\n\nThen there’s the other side of the coin, songs that lean heavily on Cardinal’s coming to terms with herself and the connections made in the here and now; tracks like ‘Just Let Me Lie To You’ and ‘You & I,’ which explore the gulf between wanting and having love and negotiating the ever-shifting terrain that lies between the two. Still others, notably ‘How I Learned To Live Alone,’ focus keenly on growth, forward momentum, and becoming someone new because of the struggles she faced.\n\n“Growing up in northern Alberta, I was one of two native families in the church and the school that I\n\nwent to. My father’s family was part of the ‘Sixties Scoop,’ so we didn’t grow up connected to our\n\nIndigenous culture at all. My whole life I felt like I was struggling with my identity and the many\n\nexpectations that were put on me, so it took a long time for me to feel like I had a voice.”\n\n“Creating this album and these songs is part of my healing journey,” she continues. As Cardinal puts it:\n\n“It travels through the scars of a child brought up in a religion that caused harm to her and everyone\n\naround her. It shows her finding her way back to a spiritual world, hand-held by the ghost of a friend who traveled through dimensions to remind her of the infinite possibilities of the universe. It explores\n\nloneliness, and paradoxically, it explores the joy of being alone.” In doing so – from folk-based ballads like ‘Wandering River’ and the classic R&B feel of ‘Don’t Waste Your Love On Me’ through the funky, four-on-the-floor vibe of ‘Show You How To Love Me’ – Cardinal covers a lot of ground stylistically, often in a single song. Notably on ‘Over And Over,’ a seamless blend of soul, funk, and rock that showcases the standout talents of her band and Cardinal’s impressive vocal chops in\n\nequal measure and like never before.\n\nScheduled for release on June 21, 2024, Boundless Possibilities is a set of songs listeners will feel in the body, mind, and soul, a thoughtful and compellingly honest portrait of an artist coming to terms with her place in the world and her spirituality, but also a blueprint for others facing similar struggles. The kind of record that anyone who’s experienced loss – large or small – will find solace in and feel, regardless of who you are and what your world looks like, that you are not alone.\n\n“That’s the intent,” Celeigh Cardinal concludes. “The only thing I ever wanted to do for people was\n\nsomething that I felt like I was lacking. I want people to feel free to laugh, to cry, and to feel connected.\n\nUltimately, I just want people to feel personally liberated.”\n\nWelcome to Indigenous in Music with Larry K, this week we welcome from Cowichan Valley, BC, the creators of Blue Moon Marquee A.W.

A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages.\n\nColette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues.\n\nThe result of 9 years of rigorous touring, crisscrossing Europe and North America, is a distinct energy and style from this acclaimed duo. Carving a path through blues, jazz, jump jive, folk, country, swing, and Indigenous soul with an authentic spirit, their sound does not idle easily in one certain category. It stomps and struts through the wilds, conjuring a blend where Howlin’ Wolf tangos with Django, Earnest Tubb shoots firecrackers with Cab Calloway, and Memphis Minnie throws dice with Screamin’ Jay Hawkins.\n\nTheir gift is bringing all these elements together without anything sounding out of step. They collect the roots and smoothly braid them with lyrics that often touch on the underbelly of society, woven with elements of Indigenous storytelling and poetic cadence.\n\nBlue Moon Marquee has its own completely original style. Modern Blues doesn’t really get any better than this. This is a tremendous sound by a hugely talented duo” says American Roots UK.\n\nWith their highly anticipated 5th album Scream, Holler & Howl (SHH), Blue Moon Marquee have captured their most sophisticated collection of songs yet. Co-produced by Duke Robillard and recorded live to tape, SHH blazes forward with a full band featuring some of Canada’s finest veteran players. While they have primarily performed as a duo since 2013, over the last couple of years they have been performing often as a trio or quartet featuring Darcy Phillips (Jann Arden) on piano and Jerry Cook (Colin James) on tenor and baritone saxophone.\n\nThe album was honoured with the Blues Foundation’s Blues Music Award nomination for Emerging Artist of the Year(2023). The release also swept the Maple Blues Awards (Canada’s highest honour in Blues) with four wins including, Album of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Acoustic Act of the Year and Entertainer of the Year. The album has topped the charts in the US and Canada achieving #1 on the !Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues chart and #3 on their National Top 10 Chart for all genres, #1 on Canada’s Top 50 Chart by Roots Music Report, #6 on the International NACC Radio Chart and #8 on the coveted Living Blues Radio Chart. There was even a 4 week run at #1 on the Indigenous Music Countdown. In a rare feat, the album reached #9 on the !Earshot National Jazz Chart while charting in Blues. Most recently they were honoured as at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards with Live Musical Performance of the Year and Roots Album of the Year.\n\nWith 2019’s Bare Knuckles and Brawn (BNAB), released on Spanish label FOLC Records, they were nominated as Blues Artist of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Indigenous Songwriter of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.\n\nWith a “totally unique approach…such a powerful original mix of swing styles with jazz and blues, west coast swing and New Orleans feel” (Sound Guardian) the record topped both the Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues Charts simultaneously with the National Jazz charts, a rare feat. Starring standout vocals and catchy hooks that speak to music lovers, BNAB instantly charmed first-time listeners and thrilled long-time fans.\n\nStylistically, the album is a swaying lantern, highlighting their unique diversity. From the potent Indigenous-storytelling calypso swagger of “Big Black Mamba” to the sultry laid back blue jazz of “Hard Times Hit Parade” to the hard-swinging Spanish-tinged “Smoke Rings for My Rider”.\n\nNews about the band was spreading from heavy touring and old-fashioned word-of-mouth. As word spread, so did interest from talent buyers, allowing Blue Moon Marquee opportunities to open for a range of artists like Lisa Fischer and Mary Chapin Carpenter.\n\nAppreciated for their lyrical candour, outstanding musicianship and vivacious live performances, Blue Moon Marquee was the most requested band in the country for the Canadian International Jazz Festival Circuit following their 2017 release Gypsy Blues.\n\nThis full-length album of original material also garnered the Indigenous Artist of the Year nomination from the Western Canadian Music Awards as well as a Best New Artist nomination at the Maple Blues Awards.\n\nGypsy Blues was an ode to their deep influences of jazz manouche and vintage blues, infused with verse having a penchant for poet characters and a heavy dose of atmospheric textures, “Blue Moon Marquee harnessed the best of vintage music that’s practically a century old and brought it into modern times. It’s part haunting, part joyous, and sneakily infectious” says Jim Hynes of Elmore Magazine.\n\nBorn of the wild rose country in Alberta, Canada, both Cardinal and Colette played in punk, metal and rock and roll bands. Leaving home at a young age, they both spent years traveling on their own, working a variety of jobs and touring with different acts. At one point Colette was hitchhiking throughout North America performing vaudeville with her appalling act of hula hooping, skateboarding and playing trombone simultaneously while Cardinal was living in New York City working as a bike mechanic and performing at open mics every night.\n\nIt was in 2012 that they came together in Vancouver, B.C. to record Cardinal’s original material for his album Stainless Steel Heart which he had written while living in Montreal. A mutual old friend was engineering the project and they connected deeply on their taste and obsession over music.\n\nThe vast repertoire of this band is a reflection of bounteous years on the road, experiencing life through a wide diversity of lenses. The result is their trademark blend that pulls the different parts of their musical worlds together, taking the tones of early blues, the expressions of jazz, the heart of country, the spirit of folk, the swagger of soul and the rhythm of roll. The way Colette’s velvet tones lift Cardinal’s mystique is something that enthralls audiences from backroom bars to festival stages.\n\nUnbound by genre or era, Blue Moon Marquee has an edge that demands you take notice. With an authentic mixture of tempo, melody and imagery, they are timeless artists perfect for this time.\n\nWelcome to Indigenous in Music with Larry K, this week we welcome from Gallop, New Mexico, Tom Bee into the Spotlight.

Best known as founder and featured artist with the popular 1970s music group XIT, Bee’s composition “(We’ve Got) Blue Skies” was recorded by Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 on their worldwide hit album “Maybe Tomorrow.” This led to an artist, writer, and producer contract with Motown Records. While under contract with Motown, XIT released two widely acclaimed albums entitled “Plight of the Redman” and “Silent Warrior.” A single from the latter album entitled “Reservation of Education” went on to become a top 5 selling record in France and other European countries in 1973. The political overtones of Bee’s lyrics kept them from ever achieving superstar status in the United States, but the group developed a cult status in America and Europe, which has allowed their music to survive for the last thirty years.\n\nIn fact, one major newspaper once wrote, “These guys are to the Indians like the Beatles were to the White folks.” Amid a legion of loyal fans throughout the world, their live stage presentations drew comparisons by the media to the raw energy of the Rolling Stones. While at Motown, Bee also wrote and produced the title song “Joyful Jukebox Music” for Michael Jackson’s Swan Song album on the label. He also worked with Smokey Robinson on his first solo album “Smokey.” In 1979, one of his compositions “Red Hot” was a top Billboard dance hit by Taka Boom (Chaka Khan’s sister), and in 1985, U.K. Rockabilly sensation Shakin’ Stevens recorded Bee’s “Don’t Be Two Faced” on his highly successful album, “The Bop Won’t Stop.”\n\nSOUND OF AMERICA RECORDS\n\nThrough the years Bee’s compositions have appeared on numerous other albums and special projects as well. In 1989, Bee formed Sound of America Records (SOAR), in the garage of his home. In 1995, Bee formed yet another company, SOAR Distribution LTD for the sole purpose of providing his clients with one-stop music from other independent labels and artists also producing Native American music. In 1999, SOAR purchased all three buildings that they had been leasing since 1991 to house their labels, publishing, and studio operations. SOAR was also enlisted as the exclusive Native American distributor for the Robbie Robertson records “Music for the Native Americans” and “Contact From the Underworld of Redboy,” on Capitol Records, and the multi-million seller “Sacred Spirit” on Virgin Records.\n\nSOAR comprises three publishing companies and five different labels; SOAR, Natural Visions, Warrior, Dakotah, and Red Sea. SOAR now has over 300 quality titles of both contemporary and traditional music. Bee has said all along that SOAR was not the first company to record Native American music, but they were the first to take it to the next level. SOAR was, however, the first company to release traditional Native American music on compact disc. He was once quoted as saying “we took Native American music out of the trading posts and into the streets.” SOAR’s motto has always been “Quality titles, not quantity of titles.”\n\nAWARDS\n\nBee’s radical efforts over a ten-year period helped in persuading NARAS to finally create a Native American Folk category in the Grammy’s. Besides numerous gold albums, Bee has received many awards, including the Eagle Spirit in 1994 from the American Film Institute in San Francisco and The Will Sampson Award in 1996 from the First Americans in the Arts. In 1998, Bee received the Producer of the Year Award from the First Annual Native American Music Awards (NAMMY’s). The following year he received the NAMMY’s Lifetime Achievement Award (1999). In 2001, Bee received a Grammy as Producer for Best Native American Music Album in the category’s inaugural year.\n\nMayor Martin Chavez, of the City of Albuquerque, proclaimed July 27, 2002 to be “Tom Bee Day,” in recognition of Bee’s accomplishments within the music industry as a recording artist, songwriter, record producer and multi-award winner. On February 8, 2003, Bee received the Lifetime Achievement Award from First Americans In The Arts in Beverly Hills, Ca. Most recently, on February 19, 2003, in New York City, Bee received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Four Directions Entertainment. Recent achievements include a 2004 Grammy nomination for his album “Reveal His Glory.” Bee won a Grammy for producing the 2004 Grammy winning record “Flying Free” by Black Eagle."
