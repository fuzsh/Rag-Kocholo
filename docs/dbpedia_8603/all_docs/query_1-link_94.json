For instance, April 2022 was the month we got engaged, and the album cover is from that night!)\n\nAs always, thanks to to spotlistr.com for making exporting playlists to text easily.\n\nI’m currently obsessed with this playlist.\n\nGrowing up in a sephardic shul, this was the kind of liturgy/music I was surrounded with. Though not quite — imagine no musical instruments, and about twenty old men refugees from Iran, Syria, Iraq, etc chanting instead.\n\nEven back as a kid who was in an itchy suit, generally bored, and unhappy about being there, these songs (and I experienced them as songs) were really powerful. There was a sort of dusty, strained, longing in the voices of these men around me. Recreating, for just a few days a year, the accents, the music, the feeling of the countries they fled for their lives, in their youth.\n\nWhen I was young, I heard a fair amount about my parents’ story — or rather my mother’s family. My dad was always closed-lipped about it. I know about how my grandparents fled Iran on the last ever commercial flight from Tehran to Tel Aviv. (Story here). But it was a personal story, not a larger historical-political one. What I missed was an understanding that everyone in that synagogue had a similar experience to my parents.\n\nThere was only one Sephardic shul in town. I say “Sephardic” and “Shul” kind of loosely — everyone not Ashkenazi [including persian, sephardic, mizrahi jews] was there. While “shul” generally refers to orthodox places of prayer, (“synagogue is for conservatives, temple for reform jews”), we covered everyone. Especially since for non-Ashkenazi jews, the whole “orthodox” “reform” “conservative” split is kind of alien.\n\nI think a lot about jewish refugees from arab countries. Their old lives are gone. Very few jews are left in places like Afghanistan. The people in vibrant towns and enclaves were pogrom’d, harassed, and kicked out. And for those that ended up in places like Rochester, NY — they didn’t really fit the mold of what “jewish” tends to be assumed to mean in the US.\n\nAnyway. This music takes me back. It makes emotional. I think you’d like it.\n\nStart with #2: Et Sha’areh Ratson.\n\nThanks to The Kitchen for making this available on Soundcloud. Specifically Asher Shasho Levy\n\nEvery month, I make Sarah a playlist of songs she might particularly want to hear. Sadly, I’m a little behind! Here are the latest three.\n\nAugust 2021: Disco will never die, if we keep it in our hearts.\n\nנעימת ערש by Matti Caspi\n\nCannonball by The Breeders\n\nShut Out by The Buttertones\n\nI Want Your Love by CHIC\n\nFresh by Kool & The Gang\n\nBad Girls by Donna Summer\n\nGreen Onions by Booker T. & the M.G.’s\n\nI Put A Spell On You by Nina Simone\n\nGet out of My Life Woman by Lee Dorsey\n\nCoffee by Sylvan Esso\n\nSwaying leaves and scattering breath by envy\n\nOh!

Okay, I’m behind, sorry!)\n\nThis month’s playlist is focused on helping Sarah concentrate. To that end, it features some less-lyrical music, timeless warm post-folky music (like Timber Timbre), and songs in hebrew.\n\nHere it is. And, because proprietary services are bad, let’s export to text:\n\nThe December 2020 playlist:\n\nHolemabier by The Arcadian Wild,\n\nRedolent by WMD,\n\nÍsjaki by Sigur Rós,\n\nAlberto Balsalm by Aphex Twin,\n\nNowhere Near by Yo La Tengo,\n\nEverything Goes My Way by Metronomy,\n\nFor the Time Being by Erlend Øye; La Comitiva,\n\nRoygbiv by Boards of Canada,\n\nAdon Olam (Master of the World) by Moshav,\n\nAoede by Mashrou’ Leila,\n\nFire Flies by Gorillaz,\n\nDemon Host by Timber Timbre,\n\nHe Would Have Laughed by Deerhunter,\n\nפרגולה by Eviatar Banai,\n\nMyth by Beach House,\n\nWolf Like Me by Lera Lynn; Shovels & Rope,\n\nRain Clouds by The Arcadian Wild\n\n(As always, thank you spotlistr.com for making “get the plain text of a playlist” so much less painful)\n\nAs always, you can find all the playlists by going here.\n\nSome time ago, on a flight across the country, I decided to listen — I mean really listen — to a full album by the band Cloud Cult. This was new for me. I grew up listening to classical music, and in doing so, I fear I trained myself to ignore the lyrics of songs almost completely. So paying attention to actual words is quite hard.\n\nCloud Cult was on my mind. Last.fm kept telling me that they were one of my favorite bands (by number of plays), but I couldn’t tell you much about them, or their music. I had just finished listening to Krista Tipett interviewing their lead for On Being. Clearly they were more important than the silly band with weird songs that I thought they were. So I closed my eyes, queued up a new (to me) album, and simply paid attention.\n\nAnd then … woah. This song hit me like a bag of bricks.\n\n“There’s a room full of people in your head, and every single one of them claims your name.”\n\nThere’s a party going on in your head, yes, but also parties. A parliament. And this parliament is composed of factions, each led by a different personality.\n\nThis rhymes with a concept from Jay Smooth. The Little Hater. The little hater is the voice in your head, trashing everything you do. The little hater is the leader of opposition in the parliament of you. (Never the majority leader, because then that’d mean he’d have to take responsibility for actions).\n\nEventually, the plane landed. The album ended. Tears crossed my cheeks. I staggered out of the airport and met my partner. I had a decision to make — should I leave my job? What sort of thing could I do next?\n\nIf there was a parliament full of personalities in my head, we decided, maybe what I needed to do was build a coalition of the personalities I wanted to embody, and do what they wanted.\n\nWe walked to a park, and I sat down on a rock, facing a pond. I decided that there were a few values/personalities to embody:\n\nThe one who believes they will not fail\n\nThe one who is an artist, unconcerned with material things\n\nThe one who wants to always be on the side of good\n\nThe one who weighs the options and coolly does the “correct” thing\n\nFor each, I embodied them, the way an actor would, or an avatar. My posture changed. My voice changed. And each personality graded different courses of action, gave advice, etc.\n\nThe last one was perhaps the most interesting. I originally thought of it as “the person who worries” or “the person who wants to make sure I’m safe”. But a trick I learned (from Gayle Karen Young at StartingBloc) was to take these personalities and add the modifier “mature”. What does the “mature worrier” look like? To me, it was a sort of Ari Emmanuel character. Brisk, even brusque. Weighing risk and reward. Hardheaded and ambitious, calculating and cool. And his take on the situation frankly surprised me.\n\nThat’s the day I realized I needed to leave Facebook (thought it took a while longer to pull the trigger). And that’s how I try to make decisions going forward.\n\nAnyway, the point of this all was originally to suggest you listen to Cloud Cult. Cloud Cult is great! And while Room Full of People In Your Head is a great song, I’d have to say it’s not even their best. This is. Relatedly, Jay Smooth and Gayle Young are american treasures. Find Jay here. And Gayle is here.\n\nEvery month, I make Sarah a playlist of songs she might particularly want to hear.\n\nI’m running a little behind, so I just finished September’s a few days ago. It has a gorgeous picture of her (at an outdoors wedding we were honored to attend!) and features a mix of new-to-her songs by artists we know, and a few new-to-me songs from bands I found recently in my travels.\n\nHere it is. Or, if you prefer text:\n\nThe September 2020 Sarah Mixtape\n\nHeart Is A Drum by Beck\n\nTangled up in Blue by Bob Dylan\n\nOne Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer by John Lee Hooker\n\nאדם בתוך עצמו by Shalom Hanoch\n\nNànnuflày by Tinariwen\n\nCherry by J.J.
