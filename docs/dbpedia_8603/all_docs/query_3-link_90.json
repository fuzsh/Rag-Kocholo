        "text": "Simple beauty isn’t enough for Marisa Monte, the Brazilian singer and songwriter who finished her United States tour on Tuesday night at the Beacon Theater. Her music was exquisite and thoughtful, as usual; her staging was arty and often distracting.\n\nMs. Monte has a voice that caresses every note she sings and an ear for melody, whether it’s in an old samba or a Motown-flavored rock tune. Her aspirations are large. She started her concert with the title song of one of two albums she has released simultaneously, “Infinito Particular” (Metro Blue/EMI), cooing, “Don’t get lost when you enter my private infinity,” as the music glimmered serenely. She sang in darkness, with just one spotlight illuminating her face for a few moments.\n\nThrough a career that began in the late 1980s, Ms. Monte has become a star in Brazil while her music has drawn closer to home. On her early albums she looked toward jazz and soul from the United States, drawing songs from Gershwin and Marvin Gaye as well as bossa nova, and mixing rock rhythms with Brazilian ones. “Tribalistas,” her 2002 collaboration with the songwriters Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes that became a major hit album in Brazil, often leaned toward rock.\n\nBut on “Infinito Particular” and its companion album, “Universo ao Meu Redor” (Metro Blue/EMI), Ms. Monte personalizes the Brazilian ballad, surrounding gentle tunes in untraditional yet felicitous arrangements. Her band onstage included bassoon, flugelhorn, cello and harmonica along with the traditional small samba guitar, the cavaquinho, and enough guitars and percussion for intricate picking and subtle rhythms. “Universo ao Meu Redor,” which means “Universe Around Me,” is steeped in samba, featuring Ms. Monte’s songs alongside some older tunes, like “Meu Canário,” that have been known around Rio de Janeiro, but not previously recorded. It’s an album of delicate, small-scale samba with songs about private longings, not the booming samba of Carnival.\n\nMost of Ms. Monte’s newer music is quiet, and it seemed she didn’t trust it to hold her audience. Her band performed with no backdrop — the brick wall of the Beacon was visible — but there were moving, lighted panels and columns overhead and around the band. At times the columns at the sides danced along with the music; the back panel could turn into a video screen.\n\nPerhaps the staging was intended to remind the audience that performance and music are both artificial constructions. But the self-consciousness would have been better set aside, even concealed, to invite listeners deeper into Ms. Monte’s introspection. In two of the quietest ballads of the set — “Carnalismo” and “Pernambucobucolismo” — Ms. Monte’s voice was pure seduction, and the audience was spellbound. And when she arrived at some rockers at the end of the set, the crowd was on its feet, singing along."
