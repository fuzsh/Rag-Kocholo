        "text": "By GRAHAM REID\n\n(Herald rating: * * * *)\n\nA decade ago former Talking Heads man David Byrne released a groundbreaking album on his own label by Brazilian musician Tom Ze. It redefined the way many thought of music from that warm, tropical country. This wasn't lightly shuffling samba but innovative, almost new wave music that was edgy, unsettling and incorporated unusual found-sounds. For those who heard it, Brazilian music could no longer be thought of in comfortable cliches.\n\nThis excellent album by singer Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown shifts the parameters of the cliche in another, different direction. The traditional soft melodicism is still in place but there is a swooning, slightly trippy feel to some arrangements, an addictive rhythmical quality throughout, and beneath the slightly smooth surfaces are Portuguese lyrics which can be gritty and grounded.\n\nLocal reviewers have already noted the similarity between Passe em Casa and OMC's How Bizarre (a compliment, of course), and while the vocals on O Amor E Feio/Love is Ugly are harmonious, the backing piano is discordant and slightly unnerving - like Ze. Its lyrics run: \"love is dirty, it smells like piss\". The airy and timeless ballad E Voce/It's You sounds like it was written by soft-rocker David (Bread) Gates; Carnalismo/Carnalism has earthy lyrics over a fairytale piano and a vaguely chanson-meets-Great American Songbook feel. This is music of ambition and considerable melodic smarts.\n\nMonte's light vocal style finds its counterpoint in Antunes' low level rumble (her Serge Gainsborg) and they've even got a Christmas carol, Mary Christo/Mary Christ, which won't make you cringe.\n\nAs with Moana's album - and it would be interesting to know which will pull more punters - English-only listeners will be challenged, but there's much to be enjoyed with Tribalistas.\n\nLabel: Virgin"
