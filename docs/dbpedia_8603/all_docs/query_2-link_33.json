The lead was a lovely character to deal with, very responsive and interactive during the playlist setup, giving his input on amplification and sound setup on the island where the event was to happen to maximize the performance perception. I can say his suggested playlist contains the classiest bossa nova and local popular music, as well as some pop and international hits, it certainly pleases all crowds. I was impressed with their punctuality and reassurance throughout the process, as well as the quality of their delivery. They seemed to play the songs with their hearts, and of course, the guests realize it, it was a huge success! ”\n\nDiana, Kingston Upon Thames, Wedding (March 2017)\n\n“We would certainly like to have the Samba Jazz band for next year. The song selection was really good, plus he played a couple of requests that we made. I saw the guys tonight playing at our event. I heard the music as I was coming down the stairs. For the moment it just made me want to dance and then, after enjoying the music, I met the musicians after, and they were a lovely bunch of guys. I recommend them to anyone, as I love listening to their music. ”\n\nSamantha Jones, Greenwich, Corporate Event (May 2019)\n\n“There couldn't be anything better than listening and dancing to Brazilian music. I felt that the show was vibrant and brought me a lot of joy. Many thanks to the musicians for this evening. ”\n\nMartyn & Susie, South London, Wedding (August 2020)"
