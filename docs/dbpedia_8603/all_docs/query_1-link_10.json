        "text": "Quarantine, voluntary or otherwise, offers a time to find new adventures in confined spaces. I offered some suggestions on exploring Brazilian music through classic albums here, but this blog is mainly devoted to newer stuff, so of course I’m going to make suggestions there, too. Where the classic albums were pretty obvious, this list is more idiosyncratic because current music isn’t canonical (yet), plus I actually know it better than the classic stuff and feel freer to range off the beaten path. That I limited it to only three Clube da Encruza related albums is a testament to my willpower. So ten current albums in historical order (and, yes, I really should have a Sepultura album, but I don’t know them well enough to pick):\n\nSuba, São Paulo Confessions (1999) – Mitar Subotic was Serbian ex-pat who became a producing phenom in Brazil where he merged his adopted homeland’s musics with international dance trends. Those dance music trends sound somewhat dated here on his final album, but it’s still an intoxicating mix of old and new, as well as a harbinger of the international community rediscovering Brazilian music this millennium. Tragically he died a few days after the release of this album when his studio caught fire and he tried to rescue recordings before they were destroyed. If you like try: Bebel Gilberto, Tanto Tempo; Smoke City, Flying Away, Céu, Céu.\n\nTribalistas, Tribalistas (2002)– The rare supergroup that works, Tribalistas brought together the talents of Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes. As wonderful as the last two are, the real star is Monte, who might be the finest Brazilian musician since the country’s ’60s/’70s heyday. Light and playful in the best Brazilian tradition, strong melodies are swept along by mellifluous percussion that grounds music that threatens to float away. At the center is Monte’s clear, seductive voice oozing smarts and warmth. Tops is “Já Sei Namorar”, which is in the competition for the best song of the ’00s. As in worldwide, not just Brazil. If you like try: Tribalistas, Tribalistas (2017); Marisa Monte, Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor de Rosa e Carvão (called Rose and Charcoal in English-language markets), Marisa Monte, Barulhinho Bom.\n\nDonaZica, Composição (2003) – Formed by Anelis Assumpção (daughter of Itamar), Iara Rennó (daughter of Carlos Rennó and Alzira Espíndola) and Andreia Dias (daughter of overly strict evangelical Christians), DonaZica was an all too brief blazing glory of Brazilian music. Their debut is a riot of pleasure, confidence and fun, with dense, ear-tickling arrangements and playful, tag-team vocals as they decorate samba with all kinds of modern touches. All three women went on to notable solo careers, while many of the instrumentalists—notably guitarist Gustavo Ruiz in his work with his sister Tulipa—made a mark, too. One of the best four or five Brazilian albums I’ve heard this millennium. If you like try: Iara Rennó, Macunaíma Ópera Tupi; Anelis Assumpção, Taurina.\n\nKarol Conká, Batuk Freak (2013) – As with rock music, hip hop was not a natural graft onto Brazilian styles, but a culture as deeply musical as Brazil did figure out how to cannibalize it for domestic use. Frenetic and funky, Nave’s production provides an ideal environment for Conká’s charismatic rapping. His harsh samples and sounds create the kind of deep dive your ears can get lost in as hooks, bleeps and blaps are pushed to the point of annoyance without actually getting there. Yet the dazzling production never overwhelms Conká, who remains the star. If you like try: Lurdez da Luz, Gano Pelo Bang; Black Alien, O Ano do Macaco – Babylon by Gus, Vol. 1.\n\nElza Soares, A Mulher do Fim do Mundo (2015) – A famed MPB singer with a made-for-dramatization biography, Soares had basically been retired for a decade before the then-septuagenarian made this shocking, brilliant comeback album. Teaming with São Paulo’s Clube da Encruza collective (see the next two entries), she released this striking avant-samba album unlike anything in her more commercially friendly catalog. Combining punky metallic guitar with carnival rhythms run through a blender, the music abrades and cleanses, while Soares’ voice, its technical virtuosity worn down by age, gasps, yelps and groans with life. If you like try: Elza Soares, Deus é Mulher; Juçara Marçal, Encarnado.\n\nRomulo Fróes, Rei Vadio: A Canções de Nelson Cavaquinho (2016) – Connecting past with present is how a tradition stays alive, and tribute albums are a key way Brazilian musicians both honor the past while not being trapped by it. But few of such albums both honor and reinvent with the chutzpah of this triumph. Fróes, as one of the leaders of the Clube da Encruza collective, had been revitalizing samba for more than a decade. Like his compatriots, he loved Brazil’s traditions, but knew the world had changed. No gentle, lounge-worthy performances for him. Samba was music of the poor, the dispossessed, the street. Samba was a means of transgression as surely as the odd sounds of free jazz or punk guitar distortions that he tinged his music with. Back-to-back Fróes’ versions with Cavaquinho’s and the genius of both shines through. Fróes doesn’t just cover them, but deconstructs and reworks to show their continued vitality. A monumental record, as daring and successful as anything I put on that classic album list. If you like try: Romulo Fróes, Barulho Feio; Romulo Fróes & César Lacerda, O Meu Nome É Qualquer Um; Rodrigo Campos, Bahia Fantástica.\n\nMetá Metá, MM3 (2016) – Kiko Dinucci, Thiago França and Juçara Marçal, with crucial support from Marcelo Cabral and Sérgio Machado, work up some of the finest racket in Brazilian music. Dinucci’s punk-metal samba guitar, França’s wailing sax, Marçal’s moaning roar atop Cabral’s and Machado’s rumbling rhythms steamrolls the listener. Over three superb albums, a solid live set and a pretty damn good dance score, Metá Metá has carved out a path combining rock energy with samba and Afro-Brazilian styles that has little parallel (or at least successful parallel) in Brazilian music. Where so much manguebit was stiff and conservative, Metá Metá is fluid and dynamic. On their most adventurous album, Dinucci paints the background with waves of distorted riffs while França and Marçal hold center stage and the rhythm section propels everything along. If you like try: Metá Metá, Metá Metá; Metá Metá, Metal Metal; Kiko Dinucci, Cortes Curtos; Passo Torto, Thiago França.\n\nCarne Doce, Tônus (2018) – Brazil has certainly figured out rock better than America figured out samba, but that doesn’t mean the country’s musical culture has produced much that rivals the anglophone world’s output. Much Brazilian rock that I’ve heard tends to fall into the competent more than the inspired, but Goiânia’s Carne Doce is a definite exception. Drawing upon classic rock’s chops approach, the band works up a ferocious if smartly subtle virtuosity that shows off their instrumental prowess without ignoring the songs. Indeed, over three albums, the songwriting just gets better as the chops are even more smartly deployed to get the tunes across. As they get quieter with each album, their music smolders more, and vocalist Salma Jô matures into a pretty ace singer. While sounding nothing like them, the band reminds me of classic Fleetwood Mac in their ability to mix instrumental dexterity with quality songwriting. If you like try: Carne Doce, Princesa.\n\nDona Onete, Flor da Lua (2018) – Upon retirement from an academic career, Onete pursued her first love—singing—that her first husband had forbidden her from taking up. A regular gig at a local club turned into a recording deal, in which the septuagenarian adapted regional carimbó styles (from Northern Brazil) by spicing up the normally staid lyrics with love and lust. This live set draws from her first two albums and lets her soak up the adoration of an enthusiastic crowd as a crack band livens up the already lively arrangements. She’s having a blast. You will, too. If you like, try: Feitiço Caboclo, Banzeiro.\n\nBaco Exu do Blues, Bluesman (2018) – This Bahian rapper emerged seemingly from nowhere—he had been around a few years—to produce the titanic Esú only to follow it up a year later with this even better album. Baco is one of the few Brazilian artists where not knowing Portuguese really frustrates, because even with lousy browser translation, his brilliance shines through as he wrestles with black identity in a nation whose racist legacy rivals the United States. But even as the full impact of the words evade, the music, developed with a host of producers, gets across, and his volcanic flow—explosive and liquid—pours out emotion that can’t be trapped behind a language barrier. Drawing deeply on Brazilian musics, he fashions a hip hop that sounds of its place rather than an import from abroad. If you like try: Baco Exu do Blues, Esú; Baco Exu do Blues, Não tem Bacanal na Quarentena; Leo Gandelman ft. Baco Exu do Blues, Hip Hop Machine #6.\n\nAs much as a pain as it felt at the time, I preferred it when year-end lists didn’t print until February or March. Gave you time to suss through late-year releases and hear meditate a bit before compiling your own list. These days publications are putting out lists before a year even ends. So, although the new cycle has left 2019 behind, I’m finally ready to put out a list of what I liked most last year. And, hey, it’s my 100th post. So that’s fun.\n\nMy two favorite Brazilian albums on the list below are actually 2018 releases. So, yeah, it was a down year. What’s more, there’s not a single full A, much less A+, record in the bunch. But that’s not to say these are not great, or at least pretty great, records. If nothing sounded ear-shattering or life-altering, well I feel lucky to get one or two of those from worldwide in any year.* So I’ll happily make do with the thoroughly enjoyable pleasures of Brazilian albums that have held up to dozens of listens each, many of which didn’t just make good sounds, but upped the political content for dangerous times in a homeland under rightwing siege.\n\nPlus, it might be the most sonically diverse list I’ve assembled: hip hop, jazz rap, northeast meets central Africa, Krautrock revivalism, neo-samba, alt-rock. Three years into this project I continue to be surprised how deep and varied Brazil’s musical culture is, and how much American and Western engagement just nips the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThere is one notable gap, however. For the first time since 2010, not a single Clube da Encruza record made my year-end top ten. Douglas Germano is something of an affiliate member, but it’s not quite the same. It wasn’t because of bad product, but rather a lack of options: the Clube members and their side projects were quiet in the studio even as they maintained relentless touring schedules. I would have loved to see that Metá Metá/Passo Torto show, or Romulo Fróes tour interpreting Caetano Veloso’s Transa. But I don’t live in Brazil. The good news is, spoiler alert, one of them has already released a fine album this year.\n\nAnd Latin music? I had plans of deeper engagement this past year, but life upsets plans, so I didn’t dig in as much as I wanted to. I still found several 2019 albums that made my ears perk up, so I’ll do a list there, too. As usual, I tend to feel the Brazilian stuff more because I devote so much more time to it, but for a change of pace, these albums more than merely serve the purpose. (I haven’t reviewed the Rodrigo y Gabriela one yet. Consider that a preview of coming attractions.)\n\n*If you are interested, those two albums this year were James Brandon Lewis’ An Unruly Manifesto—my favorite jazz album of the decade—and Billy Woods’ and Kenny Segal’s Hiding Places, where creepy ssounds and lyrical detail keep drawing me in further. Billie Eilish wasn’t far behind. Don’t underestimate her.\n\nFavorite Brazilian Albums 2019\n\nDona Onete, Flor da Lua (2018) (A-)\n\nAna Frango Eletríco, Mormaço Qeuima (2018) (A-)\n\nDouglas Germano, Escumalha (A-)\n\nBaianaSystem, O Futuro Não Demora (A-)\n\nRincon Sapiência, Mundo Manicongo: Dramas, Danças e Afroreps (A-)\n\nAna Frango Eletríco, Little Electric Chicken Heart (A-)\n\nKarina Buhr, Desmanche (A-)\n\nLeo Gandelman & Baco Exu do Blues, Hip Hop Machine Series #6 (A-)\n\nEma Stoned, Yantra and Makoto Kawabata, Phenomena (A-)\n\nSiba, Coruja Muda (B+)\n\nHonorable Mentions (alphabetical):\n\nAkira Presidente, Nandi (B+)\n\nDEAFKIDS, Metaprogamação (B+)\n\nLeo Gandleman & BNegão, Hip Hop Machine Series #7 (B+)\n\nMC Tha, Rito de Passé (B+)\n\nDona Onete, Rebujo (B+)\n\nJuliana Perdigão, Folhuda (B+)\n\nThiago Pethit, Mal dos Trópicos (Queda & Ascenção de Orfeu da Consolação) (B+)\n\nTássia Reis, Próspera (B+)\n\nTribalistas, Tribalistas Ao Vivo (B+)\n\nIf I included compilations, two fine, recent ones that would make the list are Levanta Poeira: Afro-Brazilian Music & Rhythms 1976-2016 in the top ten and Jambú (E Os Míticos Sons da Amazônia), in the honorable mentions.\n\nFavorite Latin Albums 2018\n\niLe, Almadura (A-)\n\nLos Wembler’s de Iquitos, Vision del Ayahuasca (A-)\n\nLa Yegros, Suelta (A-)\n\nDaymé Arocena, Sonocardiogram (A-)\n\nLas Yumbeñas, Yumbotopía (A-)\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela, Mettavolution (A-)\n\nYapunto, Yapunto (B+)\n\nFumaça Preta, Pepas (B+)\n\nFemina, Perlas & Conchas (B+)\n\nNicola Cruz, Siku (B+)\n\nHonorable Mentions (alphabetical):\n\nCanalón de Timbiquí, De Mar y Río (B+)\n\nNewen Afrobeat, Curiche (B+)\n\nOh, and I’m not quite done with the year yet. Expect something 2019 related around March 1.\n\nCotonete and Di Melo, Atemporal – With Immorível, Roberto Di Melo returned to the main stage of MPB that he’d abandoned for the margins after his 1975 debut album. Collecting songs from the nine albums he recorded in obscurity on a regional label, he burst back into the popular consciousness with perhaps his best album. Here he teams with French jazz funk band Cotonete, who previously worked with singer Simone Mazzer. The opening three tracks promise he may repeat the party of his previous triumph and peak with a thumping disco number, “A.E.I.O.U.” Then the band turns in two fusion jazz wrecks—one over nine minutes, the other over seven—where Di Melo barely appears and you figure out why he’s second billed on the album cover. A reprise of his 1975 hit “Kilariô” resets things, and the album closes out with two good ones, especially the Gilberto Gil rip “Verso e Prosa”. But that 17-minute black hole at the center of the album really sucks the life out of the thing, so program yourself a nice little 30-minute samba funk album instead that would rate at least two notches higher. Listen and buy here. Grade: B-\n\nAlessadra Leão, Macumbas e Catimbós – After three excellent EPs experimenting with São Paulo’s dirty samba scene, Leão turns back to her northeastern roots and her interests in Afro-Brazilian percussion traditions. Little more than hand percussion and voices, Leão’s preservationist and minimalist senses get in the way here. While there isn’t a bad track per se, 15 songs over 53 minutes of beats and voices lacking accoutrements to fill out the sound doesn’t exactly focus the ears or hold your attention. Five songs over 17 or 18 minutes, and maybe she could have pulled it off, but as is her latest release fails to rise above interesting. Listen here. Grade: C\n\nDona Onete, Flor da Lua (Live) (2018) – The eternal con of live albums is that they invite you to share an experience you likely missed, but then end up as mere souvenirs that register only for the people who were present. Every now and then, however, you get a good one that makes sharing music made for the moment than posterity sound like a great idea. Bill Withers’ expanded Live at Carnegie Hall, several PJ Harvey bootlegs I’ve got, the Allman Brothers Band At the Fillmore East: these transport you from whatever room you’re in to that electric moment of the performance. With a limber band that stretches out the songs with an extra minute or more of tricks that highlight the groove rather than derail the songs, Onete selects six from Banzeiro and four from Feitiço Caboclo (including “Jamburana”, of course) to demonstrate why the live performances she took up for fun in her 60s led to a recording career in her 70s. You can find videos of these performance online (it’s part of a DVD released in Brazil) and see how integral the band is to the performance. The two saxophonists bounce around like jesters stage providing visual acrobatics to match their playing, while Onete sits center stage commanding attention nonetheless as her nine-member backing band serves their queen ably. You don’t need the visuals to enjoy the music, but they help display why this album is no tepid recapitulation of studio version. Not that the two excellent and one very good studio albums are slack, but this is her gift to history. You can find the soundtrack on streaming services. Grade: A-\n\nDona Onete, Rebujo – To get three excellent albums out of a post-retirement career change from a septuagenarian singer whose voice has withered like everyone’s does is something of a miracle. So, of course, it’s not a surprise when the momentum sags a little. Initially I found Onete’s latest a significant disappointment. Where Banzeiro had expanded on Feitiço Caboclo and Flor da Lua made her claim to history, Rebujo feels like a mere remake of the debut without a “Jamburana” to send it into orbit. But a few spins in, and buoyed by the live album that I’d missed when released, I accepted she wasn’t just old, but reliable. Really the only thing missing compared to her first two studio albums is the killer cut. Here she knocks out 11 perfectly enjoyable songs without giving you the thrill her best work does. So, yeah, a drop off. But she started pretty far up there. Listen and buy here. Grade: B+\n\nTribalistas, Tribalistas Ao Vivo – When what may be the greatest supergroup of all time surprised everyone with a reunion 15 years after their one-off triumph, they succeeded enough to extend their myth and retire back to their solo careers. Instead, Maria Monte, Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown took the band on tour, which they’d never done. Not lucky enough to make a show myself—I’ve seen Monte, and she’s terrific live—I figured the moment was lost to history, although some friends’ reports of the shows (good, not transcendent) left me not feeling too sad. This album does the opposite. While not surpassing the studio albums, it nonetheless puts a new spin on the band and gives you enough reason to pay attention live versions. Details and additions emerge in the arrangements that goose the performances. The songs, of course, are undeniable. Most interesting is the voices. On the studio efforts, Monte (rightly) dominates. She’s the best singer and artist of the talented trio. But here the voices are mixed more egalitarian, and it adds a different flavor. Instead of feeling like a Monte solo album, as the two studio albums can, it sounds much more like a group effort. And the audience singalongs smartly kept in the background capture the rapture that fans were feeling. The best versions here—soaring “Vilarejo”, silky “Fora da Memória”, the discordant horn charging “Ânima”—achieve the transcendence of great live music even though you aren’t there. A few of the tracks are flat, but mostly the performances here bring to life the legend that is the band. If they’re smart, they’ll retire the Tribalistas thing and let myth grow. But I confess, this album leaves me wanting more. Listen here. Grade: B+\n\nVarious Artists, Jambú (E Os Míticos Sons da Amazônia) – Label Analog Africa continues its occasional forays into Brazil’s northern and northeastern Afro-Brazilian musics. This disc focuses on Para (Dona Onete’s home state) with 18 tracks drawn from the 1970s scene in the state capital, Belém. Even further removed from samba or bossa nova than the music of the northeast, these songs may not even sound Brazilian to most listeners. The closest comparison is the intensely percussive frevo or the explosive sections in a rural maracatu. Basically, these songs are traditional styles beginning to transform into club music. The beats hit hard and fast, and the music beckons you onto the dancefloor. Sequenced for flow and effect, compilers Samy Ben Redjeb & Carlo Xavier create a sense of variety among music that works within some fairly narrow bounds. Plus, they dig up some real finds: Who are Pinduca? Janjão? Vieira e Seu Conjunto? You’ll be typing names into your the internet search engine of your choice as you listen. Listen and buy here. Grade: A-\n\nAs carnival 2018 prepares to crest, it’s time to celebrate Brazil’s best musical releases from 2017.\n\nTulipa Ruiz, Tu EP (A-)\n\nCriolo, Espiral de Ilusão (Deluxe Edition) (A-)\n\nKiko Dinucci, Cortes Curtos (A-)\n\nBaco Exu do Blues, Esú (A-)\n\nAkira Presidente, Fa7her (A-)\n\nCelso Sim, O Amor Entrou Como um Raio (Celso Sim Canta Batatinha) (A-)\n\nRimas e Melodias, Rimas e Melodias (A-)\n\nApanhador Só, Meio Que Tudo É Um (A-)\n\nTribalistas, Tribalistas (A-)\n\nLuiza Brina e O Liquidificador, Tão Tá (A-)\n\nHonorable mentions in alphabetical order (all = B+ grade):\n\nNina Becker, Acrílico\n\nBoogarins, Lá Vem a Morte EP\n\nCarne Doce, Carne Doce No Complexio Estúdio EP\n\nCorte, Corte\n\nDon L, Roteiro pra Ainouz, Vol. 3 EP\n\nA Espetacular Charanga do Franca, Bomba, Suor e Bapho EP\n\nKafé, Kafé\n\nLinn da Quebrada, Panjuba\n\nFlora Matos, Eletrocardiograma\n\nMetá Metá, Gira\n\nRincon Sapiência, Galangra Livre\n\nTrupe Chá de Boldo, Verso\n\nJúlia Vargas, Pop Banana\n\nSharp-eyed readers may note the Dinucci album listed in the third spot only received a B from me last spring. (Even that B was a last minute upgrade over the C+ I had been planning to give it.) When the album started appearing in multiple best of the year lists from Brazil, I returned to it and couldn’t believe I’d missed it so badly. Although Dinucci and his main band Metá Metá are two of the main reasons I’ve chosen to immerse so deeply in current Brazilian music, I missed hearing how good both Cortes Curtos and MM3 were when released. The review is updated on the Kiko Dinucci page.\n\nAbove you will find no Rei Vadio or Metal, Metal or Composiçao—those stellar albums you’re convinced you’ll be listening to the rest of your life. Indeed, most of my favorite albums from 2017 were jazz albums. Geographically and sonically, the closest I got to a life list Brazilian album was Colombian act the Meridian Brothers’ ¿Dónde Estás María? Which isn’t to say I didn’t find lots of good music. I enjoy the ten albums above thoroughly, and several of them I suspect I will be listening to for years to come. Even when you get down into the honorable mentions there is plenty of worthy music (especially that Nina Becker album).\n\nSince there were no standout albums, ranking the top ten was a challenge. The top six seemed pretty interchangeable and most of them (plus the number eight album) were in contention for the top slot at some point. In the end, I just went with which one I wanted to listen to most and, to my surprise, that was the Tulipa Ruiz EP. Normally EPs are a bit short to consider for the album of the year slot, but that release—half new songs, half remakes—kept popping up in my listening lists. I could make a strong case that Baco Exu do Blues’ strong debut deserves to be the album of the year, but in this case utility won out since whatever quality difference among these albums was insignificant.\n\nAll but the last three appeared on at least one (and often multiple) year end best of lists of Brazilian critics so I guess cultural differences are not barriers to shared tastes. The only one of those albums I hadn’t heard before the lists appeared was the Akira Presidente. The biggest surprises for not being included on other best of lists were the well reviewed Tribalistas and Apanhador Só albums. The former is an excellent album, but it does fall short of the classic 2002 debut as well as several of Marisa Monte’s solo albums, so I suspect that deflated its end-of-year support. The latter was a more interesting story: Not long after its strongly reviewed release, guitarist Felipe Zacanaro was accused of emotionally abusive treatment by a former girlfriend, including lots of cheating and one case of physical violence in which her finger was (accidentally she said) broken. #MeToo isn’t just an American phenomenon, and I’m betting the stories, which Zacanaro didn’t deny, sank the album’s critical prospects. Although I generally don’t believe in punishing the art for the artists’ moral failings, I also don’t feel particularly sorry that the band’s best album by far ended up all but ignored in the year-end tallies. Still, it is a good album.\n\nIn all I reviewed 85 albums that were released in 2017. (I have a few more up my sleeve, but none—I think—that will make their way onto the list above.) In addition, I listened to another 167 albums released in 2017 I decided weren’t worth writing up. They weren’t all bad, but if one is higher than a B, then I failed as a reviewer. Most would be in the C range or lower. Of course more than 252 albums were released in Brazil last year, but based on coverage by the Brazilian sites I peruse for leads as well as the year end best of lists I searched for regularly over the past two months, I think I’ve done a solid job of listening to the significant releases. To brag a little, I can’t imagine you will find a more thorough summary of 2017 Brazilian releases written in English. If you can, please let me know. I want to read that site."
