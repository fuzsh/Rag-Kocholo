        "text": "''TIMES have changed, there are no more secrets,'' Amadou et Mariam, the Malian duo, sing on their album ''Wati'' (Circular). They could be singing about world music, which has opened up in all directions. This is the fifth annual survey in these pages of recent world-music releases, and musical boundaries have grown more amorphous than ever.\n\nNational boundaries have grown stronger, though. Since Sept. 11, 2001, obtaining a visa to tour the United States has grown more difficult for many musicians, particularly those from Islamic countries. Still, plenty of international performers reach New York City, where they can play for homesick expatriates alongside first-timers; a list of scheduled concerts is on Page 21. And recordings and Internet connections still circumvent xenophobia.\n\nThe world-music category has always been a hodgepodge: field recordings by ethnomusicologists, popular music originally made to please a local audience, traditional music played by traditional musicians or repackaged for tourists, slick international hits in languages other than English. In all of them, Western listeners found the promise of genuine alternatives in both the sounds of the music and its purposes. Visions of otherness could be attached to a nontempered melody, a slinky rhythm or a penetrating voice.\n\nThe truth, as usual, grew more complicated. Cultures were rarely as isolated as would-be purists liked to imagine, and the reach of electronic media continues to increase. Still, listeners in search of seemingly pristine exotica can dig into a growing selection of recordings from the ethnomusicologists of yesteryear, like the reliable Anthology of World Music series being reissued on Rounder, and the novice-friendly Nonesuch Explorer series, which has now rereleased its catalogs of African and Asian music.\n\nRecordings have a way of circulating to far-flung places, where disc jockeys can juxtapose and mix them every which way. The dance-floor remix with samples or guest performances by international musicians has become a subgenre in itself. And musicians, habitually wanderers and hybridizers, see little need to shut out possibilities. So Abdelli, from Algeria, cheerfully collaborates with musicians from Cape Verde, Azerbaijan and Burkina Faso on his album ''Among Brothers'' (Real World).\n\nIt's a big world, and this selection is geared toward music that emphasizes its connection to local and traditional styles. It deliberately and arbitrarily skips large swaths of what's sold as world music: foreign-language rock and pop, assemblages by Western disc jockeys, New Age meditations. It also skips reggae and Latin pop, which present an overwhelming number of releases. What's left ranges from ancient songs to 21st-century hybrids with ever more entangled roots. (CD's range in price from $14.99 to $19.99 a disc.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
