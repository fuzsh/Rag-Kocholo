I specialise in the architecture and development of mobile applications, mainly for iOS and Android. I enjoy working with all layers of software architecture, from the lowest end (hardware) to the highest (user interfaces).\nI launched this website in 2019 - by then a University of Glasgow student - to write about topics I like to investigate during my free time, including computing architecture, user interface design, sound synthesis and computer graphics.",

        "text": "How did you start this website?\n\nI always had some sort of personal site but never managed to build a proper space to write on. After being made aware of the potential of static website generators (my last attempt used Wordpress on top of a slow hosting) and the multitude of free and easily-customisable themes, I decided to give it a go.\n\nWhy didn’t you build a dedicated site for the console architecture writings?\n\nI originally planned to write about personal projects, but wanted to get some practice first. Also, before the website I used to write down notes about particular inner workings of consoles that I considered worth remembering. So, after setting up the site, I decided to ‘digitalise’ my notes.\n\nWhy do you care about old hardware/consoles?\n\nBecause I believe it’s the best way to properly comprehend present (and future) technology. Current advancements don’t pop out of nowhere, they may even carry past technology that only became popular many years later. Moreover, learning the fundamentals also allows me to filter misinformation out (which I’ve seen plenty of).\n\nApart from that, it’s continuous food for thought.\n\nDo I need a computing background/degree to understand your writings?\n\nIt’s preferable but that shouldn’t stop you if you are curious about the topic. Take your own time, everyone learns at different paces.\n\nSome readers have asked in the past my opinion about pursuing a university degree in computing. I’ll be honest, before starting university I arrogantly assumed a degree wouldn’t expose me to the ‘cutting-edge knowledge’ that tech companies currently look for. One thing for sure is that it did teach me important disciplines that I always overlooked, one of which made this website possible.\n\nCan you write about X?\n\nChances are I’d like to, however, time and budget are my main constraints.\n\nWhich is better, the PlayStation 7 Pro Max or the Xbox Series 720 Slim?"
