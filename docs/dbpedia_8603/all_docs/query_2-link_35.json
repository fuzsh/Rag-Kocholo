Let's go to the iTunes and find out!\n\nBe Kind to My Mistakes by Kate Bush. A B-side from one of her singles. Not bad, but certainly not perfect (Bush's perfect pop song in my opinion: \"The Big Sky\") So, no.\n\nTop of the World by The Carpenters. Insanely uncool -- the sort of track you immediately jab \"fast forward\" on if there is anyone else around -- but when no one's looking, you sing along. Yes.\n\nWhen Will I See You Again by Erasure. Techno interpretation of the plaintive disco classic ballad in which a disco queen pines up for the coked-up, lame-wearing guy with whom she engaged in heavy frottage in a bathroom stall the night before. I like it (and having Andy Bell sing it, of course, just adds another level of fabulousness), but is it perfect pop? No.\n\nThe Fool on the Hill by The Beatles. Oh, come on. Yes.\n\nThe Kids Aren't Alright by Offspring. Sprightly tune about a bunch of screwed up suburbanites. A little, you know, dark for perfect pop. No.\n\nBright Sunny South by Alison Krauss. Decent bluegrass but nothing special. No.\n\nAmanda by Waylon Jennings. Waylon discovers he's old and apologizes to his wife for it. Eegh. No.\n\nSaturday by David Boyles. Indie white man funk. Not bad. Not even close to perfect, though. No.\n\nThe Distance by Cake. Too arch. No.\n\nShe's Got a Way by Billy Joel. Actually one of my favorite Billy Joel songs. It's a perfect song to have handy when you really, really need to apologize for some thoughtlessly stupid thing that causes your woman to question whether she shouldn't just kick your ass to the curb, but that's not exactly the same as perfect pop. No.\n\nSemblance by Keith Jarrett. Somewhat like if you took the Charlie Brown theme, hacked it into 17 uneven pieces, and reassembled them at random. No.\n\nRock & Roll Band by Boston. The worst song on the first Boston album, in which the band congratulates itself for you, know, doing that rock and roll thing. The Hootie & The Blowfish of the 70s. No.\n\nIf it Were Up to Me by Rooney. What happens when your songwriting recipe includes the Beatles, the Kinks, ELO and the Replacements, but then you set the oven 10 degrees too low. It's a nice try, though. No.\n\nJoker by Five A.M. For when you can't find that Matchbox 20 CD. No.\n\nThe Golden Boat (Turntable Mix) by John Zorn. Jazz freakster John Zorn couldn't write a perfect pop song if you put a gun to the head of his pet ferret and spotted him the entire Abbey Road album. No.\n\nTime is on My Side by The Rolling Stones. Great song about abusive relationships. Gets creepier every time you listen to it. No.\n\nOne is Never Too Old to Swing by Girls From Mars. Sweet but generic swing. No.\n\nShe's Got You by Patsy Cline. If by crying in your beer after your ass is dropped is a popular activity -- and apparently it is -- then yes.\n\nCan't Help Falling in Love by Elvis Presley. Make me an argument that this isn't perfect pop. You're wrong. Yes.\n\nHonkey Tonk Woman by Waylon Jennings. Yes, the Rolling Stones song. When they do it, it's perfect pop. When Waylon gets to it, it wriggles like a wounded snake. No.\n\nBad, Bad Leroy Brown by Jim Croce. Croce is waaay overrated by the people who still remember who he is, but this song does it all, baby. Yes.\n\nShare the three minute songs in your collection (in the comments or if you have your own place, over there). Are they perfect pop?\n\nPosted by john at December 8, 2004 03:15 PM\n\nTrackback Pings\n\nTrackBack URL for this entry:\n\nhttp://www.scalzi.com/mt2/mt-tb.cgi/2923\n\nListed below are links to weblogs that reference Three Minute Perfect Pop: A Musical Meme:\n\n» Three Minute Warning from JHG's Demented Ravings\n\nMy pal John Scalzi is like the kindly uncle of the blog community.
