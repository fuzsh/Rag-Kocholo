Hugh's performance was raved about by all of the guests that we have spoken to since our wedding and if ever my wife and I host another event we will most defiantly be using Hugh. Also, should any of our friend and family require an artist for any future events we will be more than happy to recommend Hugh.

His performance was outstanding and we would not hesitate to recommend him. At one point, one of our guests thought that we had a Jack Johnson CD playing. They didn't believe that it was a live act.
