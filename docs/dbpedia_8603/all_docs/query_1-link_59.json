        "text": "MIAMI — It was a long and bumpy road, but the Latin Grammys finally made it to Miami in year four.\n\nThe big winner of the evening was Colombian singer/songwriter Juanes, who was five for five.\n\nHe walked away with kudos for rock solo vocal album and album of the year for “Un Dia Normal,” rock song (“Mala Gente”), song of the year (songwriting for “Es Por Ti”), and record of the year for “Es Por Ti.”\n\nProducer Gustavo Santaolalla had been also been nommed in six categories and celebrated three wins: Album Of The Year, for “Un Dia Normal,” record of the year (“Es por Ti”), as well as for best pop instrumental album, “Bajofundo Tango Club,” all on his label with with Juan Campodonico, Surco.\n\nMiami-based Bacilos followed with two wins with best tropical song “Mi Primer Millon” and best pop album for “Caraluna”. Those kudos were shared by Sergio George, who co-wrote “Mi Primer Millon” and produced the album.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBetter known for her tropical sounds, Puerto Rico’s Olga Tanon nabbed her fourth Grammy, for best female pop album, to add to her two general and one Latin statues. It was her first nomination in a pop category, and she edged out the likes of Thalia and Spain’s Ana Torroja.\n\nEstablished Mexican rock group Mana, which has been together for 15 years and will tour the United States in October, received best rock album by a duo or group.\n\nDavid Bisbal, who first emerged on the Spanish scene via TV songfest competish “Operacion Triunfo,” was named best new artist during the preshow.\n\nHe triumphed over Mexican singer/songerwriter Natalia Lafouracade, who was shut off of all four categories in which she had been nominated.\n\nImported from California, the evening’s host, comedian and actor George Lopez, brought his trademark irreverent humor, though a number of his self-deprecating Latino jokes and the scripted exchanges among presenters fell flat.\n\nThe show kicked off with a rousing medley tribute to salsa queen Celia Cruz, who passed away in July. The performance featured Marc Anthony, India, Oscar D’Leon, Olga Tanon, El General, Gloria Estefan, and Victor Manuelle, and Arturo Sandoval on trumpet.\n\nIn a bid to attract new auds and revive ratings for the two-hour CBS broadcast, the kudofest featured Latino-Anglo pairings of both presenters and performers, and often drew from the ranks of TV.\n\nThey included “American Idol’s” Kelly Clarkson joining Alexandre Pires on stage for his hit “Amame,” though she sang her part in English. Juanes was teamed with the Black Eyed Peas in a bilingual medley of their respective songs, “La Paga” and “Latin Girls”.\n\nUltimately only eight of the 40-award categories were unveiled on the air.\n\nBebu Silvetti was named producer of the year, posthumously, as the Argentine producer died of cancer earlier in 2003.\n\nSilvetti’s nomination cited four different albums, including “Hasta que Vuelvas” from Luis Miguel, with whom Silvetti had previously collaborated on “Romances”.\n\nOther pre-show winners who have long been on the scene cover a number of more traditional music categories: Mexicans Vicente Fernandez for ranchero album and Joan Sebastian for banda album; Argentina’s Mercedes Sosa for folk album; Caetano Veloso and Jorge Mautner for musica popular Brasileira; and Milton Nascimento for brazilian song.\n\nNo Cuba-based nominees were ultimately able to attend the ceremony, ostensibly because of visa problems, which took the steam out a planned protest by right-wing Cuban exiles, who opted to cancel. A small group of demonstrators in favor of the attendance of Cuban artists were on hand.\n\nCuba-based artists did receive kudos: Ibrahim Ferrer, best known to U.S. auds for his Buenavista Social Club perfs, for best traditional tropical album kudo, and rap group Orishas, for best rap/hip-hop album.\n\nLatin Grammy 2003 Winners\n\nSong Of The Year\n\nEs Por Ti\n\nJuanes, songwriter\n\nPerformed by Juanes on Un Dia Normal\n\nSurco/Universal Music Latin\n\nPop Album by a duo or group with vocal\n\nCaraluna\n\nBacilos\n\nWarner Music Latina\n\nMale Pop Vocal Album\n\nQuizas\n\nEnrique Iglesias\n\nUniversal\n\nFemale Pop Vocal Album\n\nSobrevivir\n\nOlga Tanon\n\nWarner Music Latina\n\nRock Album by a duo or group with vocal\n\nRevolucion de Amor\n\nMana\n\nWarner Music Mexico\n\nAlbum Of The Year\n\nUn Dia Normal\n\nJuanes\n\nProducers: Juanes and Gustavo Santaolalla\n\nEngineers/mixers: Anibal Kerpel & Thom Russo\n\nSurco/Universal Music Latin\n\nRegional Mexican Song\n\nJoan Sebastian\n\nProducer Of The Year (Announced Earlier During The Pre-Show)\n\nBebu Silvetti\n\nRecord Of The Year\n\nEs Por Ti\n\nPerformed by Juanes on his album “Un Dia Normal”\n\nProducers: Juanes and Gustavo Santaolalla\n\nEngineers/mixers: Anibal Kerpel & Thom Russo\n\nSurco/Universal Music Latin\n\nPop Instrumental Album\n\nBajofundo Tango Club, various artists\n\nProducers: Juan Campodonico & Gustavo Santaolalla\n\n(Surco/Universal Music Latin)\n\nRap/Hip-Hop Album\n\nEmigrante\n\nOrishas\n\n(Surco/Universal Music Latin)\n\nRock Solo Vocal Album\n\nUn Dia Normal\n\nJuanes\n\n(Surco/Universal Music Latin)\n\nRock Song (Songwriter’s Award)\n\nMala Gente\n\nJuanes, songwriter\n\nPerformed by Juanes on Un Dia Normal\n\n(Surco/Universal Music Latin)\n\nSalsa Album\n\n40 Aniversario en Vivo\n\nEl Gran Combo de Puerto Rico\n\nBMG\n\nMerengue Album\n\nPienso Asi….\n\nMilly Quezada\n\nSony Discos\n\nContemporary Tropical Album\n\nMundo\n\nRuben Blades\n\nSony Discos/Harmony\n\nTradition Tropical Album\n\nBuenos Hermanos\n\nIbrahim Ferrer\n\nNonesuch\n\nTropical Song (Songwriter’s Award)\n\nMi Primer Millon\n\nSergio George & Jorge Villamizar, songwriters\n\nPerformed by Bacilos on Caraluna\n\nWarner Music Latina\n\nRanchero Album\n\n35 Aniversario- Lo Mejo de Lara\n\nVicente Fernandez\n\nColumbia\n\nBanda Album\n\nAfortunado\n\nJoan Sebastian\n\nMusart\n\nGrupero Album\n\nQue Sentiras?\n\nAtrapado\n\nFreddie Records\n\nTejano Album\n\nSi me faltas tu\n\nJimmy Gonzalez y el Grupo Mazz\n\nFreddie Records\n\nNorteno Album\n\nLa Tercera es la Vencida…Eso!\n\nLos Terribles del Norte\n\n(Freddie Records)\n\nFolk Album\n\nAcustico\n\nMercedes Sosa\n\nFEG Discos/Sony Music Entertainment Argentina\n\nTango Album\n\nHomenaje a Piazzolla\n\nSexteto Mayor\n\nAlenda\n\nFlamenco Album\n\nEl Corazon de mi gente\n\nPepe de Lucia\n\nPep’s Records\n\nLatin Jazz Album\n\nBrazilian Dreams\n\nPaquito D’Rivera\n\nMCG Jazz\n\nChristian Album\n\nSana Nuestra Tierra\n\nMarcos Witt\n\nCanzion Producciones\n\nBrazilian Contemporary Pop Album\n\nTribalistas\n\nTribalistas\n\nCapitol Music/EMI\n\nBrazilian Rock Album\n\nLongo Caminho\n\nOs Paralamas do Sucesso\n\nCapitol Music/EMI\n\nSamba/Pagode Album\n\nAo Vivo\n\nAlcione\n\nIndie Records/Universal Music Brasil\n\nMPB (Musica Popular Brasileira)\n\nEu Nao Peco Desculpa\n\nCaetano Veloso e Jorge Mautner\n\nUniversal Music Brasil\n\nSertaneja Album\n\nZeze di Camargo e Luciano\n\nZeze di Camargo e Luciano\n\nColumbia\n\nBrazilian Roots/Regional Album\n\nChegando de Manshinho\n\nDominguinhos\n\nVelas Producoes Artisticas Musicais e Com.\n\nBrazilian Song (Songwriter’s Award)\n\nTristesse\n\nMilton Nascimento\n\nPerformed by Milton Nascimento e Maria Rita Mariano on Pieta\n\nWarner\n\nLatin Children’s Album\n\nXuxa So Para Baixinhos 3\n\nXuxa\n\nProducers: Ze Henrique and Xuxa\n\nSom Livre\n\nClassical Album\n\nHistoria del Soldado\n\nPaquito d’Rivera\n\nProducers: Dania Devora & Jose Luis Ruperez\n\nRumor Records\n\nEngineered album\n\nRevolucion de Amor (Mana)\n\nEngineers: Benny Faccone & Paul McKenna\n\nWarner Music Mexico\n\nProducer of the Year\n\nBebu Silvetti\n\nMusic Video\n\nFrijolero\n\nMolotov\n\nVideo directors: Jason Archer & Paul Beck\n\nVideo Producer: Kathee Schneider\n\nFilm Roman/Surco/Universal Music Latino)"
