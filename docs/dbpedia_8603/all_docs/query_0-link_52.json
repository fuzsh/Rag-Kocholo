        "text": "Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.\n\nPop & Rock\n\nAMEN DUNES at Warsaw (Feb. 1, 9 p.m.). To rehash bluesy rock in a way that’s genuinely compelling is a serious challenge, but Damon McMahon, frontman of Amen Dunes, has found his own way down that oft-trodden path. Especially on the band’s latest album, “Freedom,” there’s a refreshing restraint to their work, stripping away most of rock’s maximalism in favor of gentle, reverb-laden riffs that spotlight McMahon’s distinctive, ever-so-slightly wavering voice. The result is pleasant, mild chaos with enough familiar sounds to be an easy listen. The electronic artist Arthur opens.\n\n212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com/warsawconcerts\n\nTONI BRAXTON at Kings Theater (Feb. 7, 8 p.m.). This R&B titan takes over the cavernous theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for a show that has long been sold out (though tickets are available via resellers). Braxton specializes in dramatic, emotional epics, songs that are practically operatic in scope; her most enduring hit is “Un-Break My Heart,” a sweeping power ballad. Most remarkable, though, is that Braxton’s style has remained constant in spite of shifting R&B trends. Her 2018 album “Sex & Cigarettes,” a collection of cathartic, unrelenting songs about infidelity, earned three Grammy nominations. The trio SWV, responsible for chart toppers such as “Weak” and “Right Here,” will also perform.\n\n718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com\n\nESTELLE at Baby’s All Right (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). This British singer’s 2008 major-label debut is best known for its smash hit “American Boy,” which features Kanye West as her raffish suitor. The release had another minor hit, though: “Come Over,” a pop-reggae song featuring Sean Paul. Estelle, whose father is from Grenada, revisited reggae and dancehall on her most recent record, 2018’s “Lover’s Rock” — a tribute to the buoyant, romantic British reggae subgenre that goes by the same name. The album, released on the legendary reggae label VP Records, features heavy hitters including Chronixx, Tarrus Riley and Konshens.\n\n718-599-5800, babysallright.com\n\nSHAMIR at Brooklyn Bazaar (Feb. 2, 8 p.m.). Pinning a genre to this singer-songwriter from Las Vegas is challenging. His 2015 debut, “Ratchet,” is eclectic synth-pop with 1980s flair; his latest, last year’s “Resolution,” is stripped-down indie rock that includes songs like “I Can’t Breathe,” which focuses on police killings, and “The Things You Loved,” which has a folksy twang. There are constants, though: Shamir’s instantly identifiable voice — high and sweet with an acidic edge — and his songwriting. Even as his sound becomes more rough-hewed, his songs remain taut and compelling.\n\nbkbazaar.com\n\nTIBET HOUSE US BENEFIT CONCERT at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.). For the 32nd year in a row, Tibet House US, an organization devoted to preserving Tibetan culture and protecting its refugees, will host an all-star musical benefit. This year’s edition, curated by Philip Glass, a longtime participant, includes Laurie Anderson, Jon Batiste, Debbie Harry, Jason Isbell, Angelique Kidjo, Nathaniel Rateliff, New Order’s Bernard Sumner and the Tibetan artist Tenzin Choegyal. Stephen Colbert will be on hand for comic relief. And surprise one-off collaborations are likely; last year, Patti Smith and Angel Olsen covered the Velvet Underground’s “I Found a Reason.”\n\n212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
