        "text": "Roll-up for an entrancing night of rhythms, sultry songs and evocative stories from the country of bossa nova, samba and carnival, with Perth’s own award winning Brazilian singer-songwriter – Juliana Areias, the “Bossa Nova Baby”.\n\nJuliana Areias invites you to be seduced by the music of some of the most iconic Brazilian women composers of all time. Tune your senses and get to experience the true colours of Brazilian women’s love, passion, lust, loss, nature, instinct, intuition, power, motherhood, work, friendship and identity.\n\nThe Feminina Concert will celebrate what means to be a woman – the full spectrum of pleasures and challenges – according to the creative perspective of an amazing selection of Brazilian women songwriters: Joyce, Rosa Passos, Rita Lee, Marina, Marisa Montes, Ceu, Maria Gadu, Adriana Calcanhoto, Ana Carolina, Luedji Luna, Fatima Guedes, Zelia Duncan, Maria Luiza Jobim, Vanessa Moreno, Vanessa da Mata, Teresa Cristina, Alcione, Chiquinha Gonzaga, Ivone Lara, Dolores Duran and Ale Kali. All of them are inspirations for Juliana Areias.\n\nThis concert will happen in the week of the 174th birthday of the virtuoso, prolific and daring pianist Chiquinha Gonzaga, Brazil’s first woman conductor and successful composer who had her first musical hit in 1877 – a song called “Atraente” (attractive) in a polca-choro style. Also from Chiquinha Gonzaga comes the very first Carnival March Samba called “O, Abre Alas” (Please give way) released for the Carnival of 1899 and sung every Carnival parade in Brazil ever since. Chiquinha certainly pathed the way for every other Brazilian woman composer, including Rita Lee, Brazil’s queen of Rock, who recorded many songs with Joao Gilberto – the father of Bossa Nova. Rita and Joao, both pivotal musical influences for Juliana Areias as an artist.\n\nThis blazing concert will also showcase the sensational talent and cultural diversity we are so lucky to have in Perth. Juliana is always honoured to share the stage with her amazing Bossa Nova Baby Band featuring the grooviest cats in town: Paul Millard – sax/flute, Joshua de Silva – seven string guitar, Filipe Rimis – drums, and percussionist Rafael Medeiro de Souza.\n\nJuliana Areias has performed on major stages internationally including the Sydney Opera House, Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club in London, the Green Room in New York, the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, the Auckland Festival in New Zealand and the legendary Beco das Garrafas in Rio de Janeiro. Local performances include concerts at The Perth Festival, and as a soloist with The Perth Symphony Orchestra for the 2021 Western Australian of The Year Awards.\n\nNow it is your turn to be entranced by the authentic musical stylings of the Bossa Nova Baby herself, Juliana Areias.\n\n– “The toast of the Perth Jazz Scene. The release of Bossa Nova Baby has elevated her above a mere covers singer or bossa specialist. The singer excels in an elegant co-composed duet (Belas Artes) with Australia’s finest Brazilian-oriented 7-string guitarist, Doug de Vries”.– The Australian – Tony Hillier\n\n– “It’s bossa that plays soccer with Jazz – as it has since the 60’s – and scoring a goal. Bossa Nova Baby” is a welcome surprise of great Brazilian music, made far away.” – O GLOBO– Brazil– Antonio Carlos Miguel – Music critic and judge member of the Latin Grammy Award.\n\n– “The idea of mixing styles and cultures is reflected in Areias’ life and her music” – Daily Record, USA – Bill Nutt\n\nMore information at: www.julianaareias.com\n\nFri 29 March – Juliana Areias & Co – Bahia of all rhythms Concert @ The Ellington Jazz Club – PERTH – 7pm – SOLDOUT\n\nAfter the success of her USA and Japan tours in 2018, Perth-based Brazilian singer-songwriter Juliana Areias, the “Bossa Nova Baby”, is back at the Ellington Jazz Club. Juliana invites you on a musical voyage to Bahia, the “bay of all rhythms”. On this journey you will discover the origins of many of Brazil’s most significant musical movements: Samba, Bossa-Nova, and Tropicalia, as well as the Afro-Bahia fusions of Samba-de-Roda, Capoeira, Afoxe, Samba-Reggae and Carnaval.\n\nIn the late 90s Juliana Areias lived in Salvador, Bahia’s capital and also the first capital of Brazil. Salvador is the Brazil’s most African city, where colourful big drums are played in the streets and ladies still dress in the traditional African clothes made famous by the 1940s Hollywood star Carmen Miranda.\n\nThe Bahia of all rhythms concert will feature magic songs about the heavenly beach of Itapuan, (where Juliana used to live and started her singing career); mythic creatures such as Yemanja, the Afro-Brazilian Goddess of the Sea; African slave cultural contributions and the happiness of the Carnaval of Bahia. Juliana Areias will perform iconic bossa and afro-sambas composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes, Baden Powell and Ary Barroso – to delicious tunes from Bahian artists such as Joao Gilberto (creator of Bossa Nova), Dorival Caymmi, Assis Valente, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, Olodum, A Cor do Som, Novos Baianos, Roberto Mendes, Jorge Portugal and Raul Seixas as well as a few originals from Juliana’s internationally-acclaimed Bossa Nova Baby album.\n\nFor this exceptionally colourful concert, Juliana Areias has assembled a very special line-up of musicians and special guests – showcasing the amazing talent and cultural diversity we are so lucky to have in Perth:\n\nPaul Millard, – Australian Saxophonist, flautist (Leader of Straight Ahead Big Band);\n\nJoshua de Silva – Australian/Srilankan guitarist and singer;\n\nArvis del Vedado – Cuban bassist and singer ( leader of De Cuba Son Band);\n\nFilippe Rimis – Brazilian drummer\n\nAnd special guests:\n\nQuentin Thony – Reunion Island singer (leader of Soukouss Internationale Band)\n\nRafael Medeiros – Brazilian percussionist\n\nOurico – Lee Coumbe – Australian percussionist and Capoeira teacher (leader of Cdo-Perth Capoeira Group)\n\nJuliana Areias has performed on major stages internationally including the Sydney Opera House, Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club in London, the Green Room in New York, the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, the Auckland Festival in New Zealand and the legendary Beco das Garrafas in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nNow it is your turn to feel spellbound by the Bossa Nova Baby, Juliana Areias.\n\n– “The toast of the Perth Jazz Scene.

Rita Lee has sold more than 60 millions albums worldwide, has been performing for over 50 years and is turning 70 on the 31st of December 2017.\n\nJuliana Areias invites you to celebrate Rita Lee’s music and discover Juliana’s own “psychedelic” side! Rita Lee was the daughter of American and Italian immigrants, and her music is the “most complete translation” of the cosmopolitan spectrum of Sao Paulo City – a mixture of Rock’ n Roll, Blues, Pop, Shuffle, Swing with Latin Rhythms such as Bolero, Samba and Bossa Nova.\n\nRita Lee, Queen of Rock, was Juliana’s very first musical influence.\n\nThe show will feature Juliana Areias (vocals), Marcus Tranjan (guitar) and Dana Ogle (percussion) performing songs from Rita Lee’s endless list of greatest hits, such as the infectuous Lança Perfume (Perfume Spray – Prince Charles’s declared favourite tune), Ovelha Negra (Black Sheep), Doce Vampiro (Sweet Vampire), Mania de Você (Mania of you), Mutante (Changeable), Nem Luxo, nem Lixo (Neither Luxury nor Rubbish), Esse tal de Rock in Roll (This certain Rock in Roll), Ando Meio Desligado (I have been a bit absent minded)… as well as her Beatles arrangements and collaborations with other iconic Brazilian composers and singers such as Cazuza – Perto do Fogo (Near the fire), Zelia Duncan and Maria Rita – Pagu (a witch who died in the inquisition), Ed Motta – Fora da Lei (Outlaw) , Paulo Coelho – Arrombou a Festa (Broke into the Party), Elis Regina – Alo Alo Marciano (Hello Mars Alien) and Joao Gilberto – Jou Jou Balangadã and Brasil com S (Jou Jou Bijoux / Brazil with S).\n\nRita Lee has been passionately singing about the beauty of women’s freedom of expression, sexuality, pleasure, desires and life aspirations for decades – well before Madonna hit the scene. From the time when Rita’s teenage band “Mutantes” participated in the Tropicalia revolutionary musical movement (1966); to her arrest by the Brazilian Military Dictatorship when she was pregnant of her first son (1976); to her life and musical marriage with Roberto de Carvalho, (who she still calls her boyfriend after over 40 years together), here we have a 70 year old super-artist and woman “full of life and grace and keen to make a lot of people happy with her music” – as her song “Saude” (Health) well-says.\n\nLet’s celebrate Rita Lee’s extravagant music and enjoy ourselves on Saturday the 9th of December from 7pm at Geoffrey’s Studio (end of Government Rd – Nedlands).\n\nSaturday 13th of July, 7pm at the Ellington Jazz Club – Book now\n\nJuliana Areias – who is an unconditional fan of Jobim and also originally from Sao Paulo – expresses her pride for her home city in this new concert “Metropolis” which celebrates “paulista” artists and musicians and their love for what was known in the words of Eduardo Gudin in the song “Paulista”, “the whole world in one single city.”\n\nSao Paulo is a melting pot of cultures that makes it a vibrant metropolis. Amidst what some call the “urban jungle” and the chaotic lights of intense traffic, Sao Paulo also hides positive political effervescence and artistic expressions of all sorts. In a country where the amazing landscape is not a privilege of the “paulistas” (people originally from the State of Sao Paulo), it is not uncommon to see a slight glimpse of jealousy of “paulistas” in regards to the “cariocas” who are the “owners” of the iconic Brazilian postcard views of the Corcovado, Christ Redeemer and the Sugar Loaf. – Sung and acclaimed by many overseas in the tunes by Antonio Carlos Jobim.\n\nLike many large cities in the world, Sao Paulo ranks as the 5th largest with a total population of 27 million people and its cultural richness comes from the mix with the various migrants that “paulistas” are very proud of. Italians, Lebanese, Japanese, Koreans, South Americans and many others are responsible in a way for the poetry and the lyricism of the Sao Paulo tunes.\n\nWith the protests that emerged in Brazil in June, having started in Sao Paulo, the eyes of the world left the beauty of Brazil’s famous landscapes from Rio to notice Sao Paulo. With that, “paulistas” around the world revisited their love and hate for their city. In “Metropolis”, Juliana Areias will sing the beauties of Sao Paulo remembering the amazing artistic and cultural landscape that no other city in Brazil can offer. Inspired in parts by the content of the project “Pump my carroça” the singer will voice out her pride in being from Sao Paulo through songs that show that where there is art, there can be love for a city that also nurtures romance and social change.\n\nJuliana Areias, Marcio Mendes, Ben Vanderwall, Adam Springhetti and special guests will present a repertoire featuring songs such as “Sampa”, a northeastern read on Sao Paulo; “Trem das onze”, a light hearted samba classic that reflects the day to day of the outskirts of Sao Paulo in the 60’s, especially the Italian migrants from Barra Funda and Bras; Familia gangster ska (Rap), “Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo” – a Brazilian parody of “New York, New York” from the band Premeditando o breque and songs from contemporary paulista artists such as Ceu. “When I think about Sao Paulo, I think about this sarcastic humour which I believe is one of the best humour of Brazil such as Rita Lee, Titans, Ultraje a rigor, Mamonas Assassinas. These are the elements that I would like to bring to this show.”, says Juliana Areias.\n\nBrazilian chanteuse Juliana Areias has lived for many years in Europe (Switzerland) and New Zealand prior to moving to Australia. Always working in the music circuit, her career includes a performance at the revered Montreau Jazz Festival. Her authentic Brazilian voice, sense of groove, engaging charisma and a very personal and passionate stage presence are the trademarks of her work.\n\nClaudia Rondon\n\nCJR Media Consultancy\n\nMarketing, PR & Creative Services\n\nclaudiajrondon@gmail.com\n\nPhotos by Sandra Barbosa and Lisa Cocks .
