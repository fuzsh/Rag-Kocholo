        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO — From Carmen Miranda to Elis Regina and Gal Costa, Brazil has a long and proud history of producing gifted female singers. Marisa Monte continues that tradition, but she has never hesitated to break the rules, gently and ever so quietly, when she thinks they get in her way.\n\nMore than just an interpreter of songs, the role typically assigned to women in Brazilian pop music, Ms. Monte, 39, is also a composer, record producer, bandleader and businesswoman, with full control of her career, repertory and recordings. And she is not willing to confine herself to a single musical style.\n\n“I’ve never started from the premise that my music is this or that,” she said during a recent interview here. “Even for me, it’s difficult to pick a label. People don’t know if I’m pop or something else. The labels never last long anyway, because at any moment it becomes easy for me to destroy all the theories.”\n\nAfter three years in which she chose to remain out of the spotlight, Ms. Monte has recently resurfaced, and in a big way. She has issued a pair of new albums — one with a pop flavor, the other a nod to the samba tradition she cherishes, both electronically enhanced — and undertaken a world tour that will bring her to the Beacon Theater in New York on Tuesday.\n\nThough she plays guitar, ukulele, bass, xylophone and autoharp on the new albums, Ms. Monte’s main instrument is, of course, her voice. Silvery and liquid, it glides, flutters and skips above her songs with a delicacy that invites listeners to relax and enjoy the ride.\n\n“Her voice is one of the most perfect in the world,” said Carlinhos Brown, the Brazilian percussionist, vocalist and composer who is one of Ms. Monte’s frequent songwriting partners. “It’s like the wind: soft, gentle and caressing, but it messes with everything in its path.”\n\nOriginally, Ms. Monte, captivated by Maria Callas, set out to be an opera singer. She went so far as to study in Italy, where she eventually had a change of heart and began singing Brazilian pop music in small bars and clubs in Venice.\n\n“She was only 19 then, but she had a knowledge of Brazilian music and a naturalness and a charisma that were truly impressive,” said Nelson Motta, a songwriter, critic, producer and novelist who saw her there and shepherded her career through its early stages. “From the start, she knew exactly what she wanted, which was to make modern pop music and at the same time indulge her passion for classic samba.”\n\nBorn in Rio, Ms. Monte grew up in a middle-class household with parents who loved the samba and frequented Portela, one of the main samba schools that play in the annual Carnival parade here. That gave their daughter a respect for music with African roots and rhythms, whether samba or jazz.\n\n“When I signed my contract with EMI, the first thing I did was to go into their archives,” she recalled. “They were the oldest record company in Brazil, and they had all that Carmen Miranda, Pixinguinha and Dorival Caymmi stuff, so I would go do research with a pen and paper and ask them to make cassettes of what I wanted. It would take months, but I’d go back again and ask for more.”\n\nHer first record, released here in 1989 and produced by Mr. Motta, included Miss Miranda’s “South American Way,” as well as songs written by Kurt Weill, Os Mutantes, Marvin Gaye and George Gershwin. The Miranda influence, both then and now, also expresses itself onstage in dramatic poses and her wardrobe: long, flowing ensembles and Gypsy-style scarves and jewelry.\n\n“I love Carmen Miranda,” Ms. Monte said. “I think she’s absolutely the greatest singer.” But, she added, Miss Miranda was at the same time a cautionary example of an artist “who made a lot of personal sacrifices for a brilliant career and ended up not being able to hear her own internal rhythm, which is what you really need to be happy.”\n\nFor all her pride in her Brazilian roots, though, Ms. Monte has also shown herself to be very much at home with the New York pop musical vanguard. She has worked steadily with Arto Lindsay since the early 1990s and has also collaborated with Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Marc Ribot, Bernie Worrell and Philip Glass, who wrote the string and horn arrangements for a pair of songs on “Infinito Particular” (“Personal Infinity”), one of the two new albums.\n\n“Philip is interested in Brazilian music, has a lot of Brazilian friends, speaks the language a bit, and understands what I am doing,” she said. “He did an arrangement for me back in 1994 that was incredible, and this time, when I needed a written arrangement for quartet that I could use in my live show, I asked him to resolve the problem for me, and he came up with the solution.”\n\nMr. Lindsay, an American guitarist who grew up in Brazil and has produced or engineered several of Ms. Monte’s records and shows, said: “Her taste is very wide, but also very mainstream. One of the secrets of her success is that she has really popular taste, and so is very honest about doing what she does and looking for the best from every genre.”\n\nMs. Monte’s biggest commercial success came in a partnership with Mr. Brown and Arnaldo Antunes called “Os Tribalistas.” Originally meant to be a modest home recording, it sold more than 1.5 million copies. “After years of doing a solo career, to be part of something larger and to be able to divide up thoughts and decisions and not have to be out front was what I wanted most,” she explained. “It was such a relief and a pleasure to not have it be just me, me, me all the time.”\n\nDuring the last stages of recording “Os Tribalistas,” Ms. Monte became pregnant. She took some time off to stay with her son, who will be 4 next month, and remained out of the public eye.\n\nThe new CDs also reflect the influence of some of the music she listened to during her hiatus, using electronics to expand and modernize her sound. Both records feature processed vocals and instruments, including one track, “Pernambucobucolismo,” that makes her multi-tracked voice sound like an electric guitar.\n\n“I love manipulating the sound of everything, ” she said. “You can create new instruments that don’t exist or new tonalities for traditional instruments. Plus, the mixture of the pure sound with the processed sound is really cool.”\n\nThe samba record, “Universo ao Meu Redor” (“The Universe Around Me”), which recently won a Latin Grammy, is a particular departure and a genre-buster. Though some of the songs date back to the 1940s, Ms. Monte chose as her co-producer Mario Caldato, who has worked with the Beastie Boys, Beck and Jack Johnson.\n\n“I thought he could understand this desire of mine to be more experimental, to be more psychedelic and have freedom of sound in the instruments,” she explained. “I wanted to use instruments you don’t hear in samba, so that the record would sound like samba from someone who lives in today’s world and listens to drum ’n’ bass and contemporary pop.”"
