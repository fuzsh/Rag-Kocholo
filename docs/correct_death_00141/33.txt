This small town in rural Tennessee was the setting for the country's most famous debate over creation and evolution. The Scopes "Monkey Trial" took place in the Rhea County Courthouse in 1925.

Five years after the trial, Bryan College was founded in Dayton, named after William Jennings Bryan, the man who helped prosecute the Scopes Trial. Along with the college and history, Dayton is also known for its bass fishing and many notable festivals throughout the year.
