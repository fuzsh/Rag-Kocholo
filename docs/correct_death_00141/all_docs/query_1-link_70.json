        "text": "\"LaFollette does a fine job of using the pictures to open up many different stories of the trial. . . . She intelligently introduces many issues—journalistic objectivity, the religious preferences of the scientists, the objectifying gaze of the journalists on the local holiness religious practices, and the failed aspirations for economic rebirth in Dayton—without getting too far from the images or losing general readers.\"—Reports of the National Center for Science Education\n\n\"A fine book that shows us a side of a much-studied historical event that has been rendered invisible by historical forces. . . . the photographs are accompanied by a clearly written text with some novel insights drawn from LaFollette’s extensive knowledge of science popularization and the history of science journalism. . . . A valuable contribution to our understanding of an important historical event that has been much misrepresented in popular culture. It is also thoroughly enjoyable reading.\"—Quarterly Review of Biology\n\n\"Journalists finally have gotten center-state status in a new history of America’s ‘trial of the century.’ LaFollette . . . goes beyond mere discovery and publication of unique historical documents, which are the photos. She shows the power of photography to create historical statements. . . . The photos provide both new insights and questions about the cultural history of the trial. . . . Her shift away from Clarence Darrow, William Jennings Bryan and legal issues, and toward the cultural ones via historical photography and narrative demonstrates the dynamic role of the press in cultural history. . . . She recognizes the role of the press in creating and recording American history.\"—American Journalism\n\n\"Weaves new pictures into the historical memory of the trial [and] provides a brief, yet important introduction to two science writers who shaped Scopes trial history.\"—Kansas History\n\n\"Reframing Scopes is a light, enlightening, educational and engaging read. Check it out.\"—Religion Dispatches\n\n“LaFollette has unearthed a gold mine of new and provocative photographs from the Scopes trial, and she puts these to excellent use in explaining the ways in which scientists, journalists, and lawyers collaborated to publicize their own version of the ‘trial of the century'”—Jeffrey P. Moran, author of The Scopes Trial: A Brief History with Documents\n\n“LaFollette resurrects a wonderful collection of photographs—some still familiar, others long forgotten—that recaptures a colorful trial from a distant era that still echoes today.”—Edward J. Larson, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America’s Continuing Debate over Science and Religion"
