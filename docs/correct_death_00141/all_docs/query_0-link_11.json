Y reference to the several cuts shown on both sides of this sheet, the effective results to be obtained by the use of a high grade Enameled or Coated Book stock will at once be seen. This paper is our “Ivory” brand, and is the most satisfactory stock for half-tone work now on the market ; its printing qualities being perfect and having none of the objectionable features noticed in many of the cheaper grades of Enameled Papers now being offered to the trade. Our “Ivory” Brand is especially adapted for use in catalogue printing where display effect is required and many cuts are to be used. Typefounders should always use Enameled Book for their specimen sheets, as the same effect cannot be obtained on any other grade of stock. Reference to the Specimen Annual , published by the American Type Founders’ Co., in January last, paper for which we supplied, will bear out this statement. The cost of Enameled Book is now so near that of the Supercalendered grade that printers can with safety recommend its use to their patrons, in fact, the progressive printer cannot afford to do otherwise. 1 be very pleased to send samples upon receipt of a request for same.

THIS press was designed and made for use in wood printing establishments, where a great variety of large and heavy work is called for. It has been in use for the past eight years in one of the largest factories in the country, and has been subjected to the most severe tests possible. This press will print boards eight feet long for fence signs, register perfectly on uneven stock for color work (something that cannot be done on any cylinder wood press in the country) and be opera¬ ted at a speed of 2,500 per hour. By using our steel type, boards of any size, in one or more colors, can be printed as quickly and as cheaply on this press as paper on a regular job press. Rough stock' of different thicknesses can be used, making a great saving in the cost of boxes. The expensive curved plates, used on cylinder machines, making the cost of printing small orders ot boxes more than the profits, are entirely done away with on these machines.

THE BED AND CYLINDER are each driven by a crank, and there are no springs required to help reverse the motion of the bed. The whole movement is as simple and durable as an ordinary train of gears. We guarantee the movement to run perfectly smooth, and without a particle of jar at any point; to run faster and last longer than any other movement now on the market. With proper care there is not a single part that will give out or need repairing ; and we want to call special attention to the fact that there are no cams, cam-gears, eccentrics, or any queer-shaped parts about it, but that each and all of the parts are straight or round, and can be made in any first-class machine shop without special tools. There is no lost motion between the bed and cylinder during the printing stroke, and the register is perfect at all speeds. The distributing and form rollers are of wrought-iron pipe, with steel journals welded in. The distribution is exceptionally fine. The cylinder never comes to a full stop when the press is in operation, but keeps moving slowly when the bed is reversing, until the speed of the bed is equal, when it increases in unison with the bed. The sheet is taken by the grippers when the cylinder is moving slowly — an important point in favor of perfect register. Having no complicated cam or stop motions to get out of order or limit the speed of the press, we guarantee every machine to print twenty-two hundred sheets per hour, when properly fed, in perfect register and without jar or extra wear. The cylinder can be tripped at the will of the feeder, and up to the moment when the sheet is taken by the grippers. The bed is supported under the line of impression by four large rollers, journaled in stands which are fastened to a rigid box-stay that cannot spring or give in the least degree. The side-frames are of the box pattern, also, and every part of the machine is con¬ structed with an eye to great strength and durability. The sheets are delivered in front of the cylinder, clean side to the fly, which is positive and noiseless in its action. We unhesitatingly pronounce this press the most simple, complete and serviceable, of its size, ever introduced, and invite the closest inspection and comparison.

FIGURES DON’T LIE Figure up the amount you pay yearly for composition, and then compare this amount with your yearly bill for type — or for that matter, with the value of all your type. Then decide where there is the greatest opportunity to save money. Type whose labor saving qualities will make it pay for itself in a few months is certainly worth investigating. While you are about it, figure out the value of the type you actually need, and that of the extra material you have been forced to buy because the leaders would not match, because the figures would not answer, and the hundred and one other reasons with which you are only too familiar. Then investigate the merits of Standard Line Type. Do not take our word for it, or that of anyone else, but decide for yourself whether or not it will enable you to make money on your composition.

THE student of current art must look upon the work of Mr. Beardsley in much the same light as he looks .upon the art of Japan when viewed for the first time. An ingenious critic, who is a Browning enthusiast, tells us, anent certain obscurities in the works of that worthy, that if we really wish to understand and enjoy him, we must make his poetry our daily bread, otherwise it will be as hard to digest as some highly seasoned gastronomic puzzle when indulged in once a month. So it is with the art of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley. Until Mr. Joseph Pennell intro¬ duced him in the Studio , April, 1893, he was little more than a name. Today we hear of him in connection with all sorts of enterprises. Mr. Pennell hails him as “a new illustrator. ’ ’ Judging him from such specimens of his work as have thus far come under our notice, we should rather call him a new decorator. And this is said in no tone of disparagement ; it is simply that his work, or what we have seen of it, is far more decorative than illustrative. Take, for instance, the little designs scattered through this paper, which were made to accompany collections of ‘ 1 Bon Mots ’ ’ by Sidney Smith, R. B. Sheridan, Charles Lamb, and Douglas Jerrold. What con¬ nection have they with the jokes, puns and witticisms col¬ lected from the writings of the au¬ thors named ? Mr. Beardsley hinA^L^|^^k^L^:^otes<lues>’’ and ‘ tesques ’ ’ they certaimy are ; as much so as the wife of the famous historian who first . suggested to .Sidney Smith the meaning of the word when she strutted into a drawing¬ room with a rose - colored j | ' turban on ‘ her head. Such designs were possible only in Japan until Mr. Beardsley appeared. Far more pretentious, and far more decorative and interesting, are the wonderfully imaginative designs made for Messrs. Dent & Co’s new edition of Mal¬ ory’s romance, “ King Arthur,” of which the front¬ ispiece of Vol. I is reproduced for this number of The Inland Printer. Yet we doubt if anyone will find much likeness to his ideal of that immortal hero in the figure drawn by Mr. Beardsley. Mr. Pennell very justly claims that the “King Arthur” and other drawings by Mr. Beardsley ‘ ‘ show decisively the presence among us of an artist, of an artist whose work is quite as remarkable in its execution as in its invention ; a very rare combination.” Again, Mr. Pennell notes that he has ‘‘drawn his motives from every age, and founded his styles — for it is quite impossible to say what his style may be — on all schools ; he has not been carried back into the fifteenth century, or suc¬ cumbed to the limita¬ tions of Japan ; he has recognized that he is liv¬ ing in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and has availed himself of mechanical reproduc- THE INLAND PRINTER. tion for the publication of his drawings, which the Japs and the Germans would have accepted with delight had they but known of it.” One of the ‘ ‘ King Arthur ’ ’ drawings, which we would gladly reproduce here if space permitted, Mr. Pennell finds ‘ ‘ one of the most marvel¬ ous pieces of mechanical engrav¬ ing, if not the most marvelous, that I have ever seen ; it gives Mr. Beardsley’s actual handi¬ work, and not the interpretation of it by someone else.” No less interesting and charming are the deco¬ rative borders, headpieces and initials that have been designed for the ‘ ‘ King Ar¬ thur. ” In ‘ ‘ invention and ex¬ ecution ’ ’ these designs show Mr. Beardsley at his best. Readers of The Inland Printer may remember one of Mr. Beardsley’s designs- — from Bjornson’s “Pastor Sang ’ ’ — reproduced for a previous number, as also the design from Mr. Wilde’s “Salome.” In the first is a particularly charming little scrap of landscape, and in the ‘ ‘ King Arthur ’ ’ design reproduced for the present number, landscape again cuts an important figure. It is not the most important, but it de¬ mands and holds our attention. And here we cannot do better than to use the words of Mr. Pennell once more, who speaks of these little landscapes as ‘ ‘ altogether delightful ; though they are conventional in the right sense, they are not imitations. But most interesting of all,” he adds, and this is espe¬ cially apparent in the Salome design already referred to, “ is his use of the single line, with which he weaves his draw¬ ings into an harmonious whole, joining extremes and reconciling what might be oppositions — leading, but not forcing, you properly to regard the concentra¬ tion of his motive. In his blacks, too, he has obtained a singularly interesting quality, and always disposes them so as to make a very perfect arabesque.” From England we hear that Mr. Beardsley already has his disciples, imitators, and even his parodist ; and that he is to have charge of the art department of the Yellow Book , a quarterly magazine to be started in April by Mathews & Lane, and /) edited by Mr. Henry Harland. Written for The Inland Printer. BUILDINGS FOR NEWSPAPER AND JOB PRINTING OFFICES. WE realize the fact that probably not ten per cent of the newspapers in this country are issued from buildings owned and controlled as a part of the newspaper property. Possibly one per cent would be a nearer figure if we were to omit the buildings owned by the large newspapers in the centers of population. The country publisher usually has all he can do to struggle along and pay a small rent without accumu¬ lating anything toward the erection of a building. Even if he own a lot it is probably not in the business center of the town, and it is the better part of wisdom to rent a room which is centrally located than to build and occupy a property away from the general run of business. The newspaper publisher who is so situated that he can control either by purchase or by lease a piece of real estate eligibly located, is in a position to put up a building at less expense than a man in another line of business, not even excepting one who sells the mate¬ rials. A building for an ordinary newspaper, not necessarily of iron and brick, should be erected at a cost for a two-story building not to exceed $4,000 to $5,000. The third story could be added for consider¬ ably less than one-half of the cost of the two-story building. If the rent for the first floor does not figure up too much, I should by all means recommend hav¬ ing the plant and the whole business together on that floor. The next best thing to do is to have the office on the first floor, and everything else on the second. I should regard dividing the workrooms as a disad¬ vantage, for the reason that it is necessary to spend more for supervision, or else do business with the unpleasant probability of there being a large amount of lost time among the employes. The largest con¬ cerns in the city are working more and more to concen¬ trating in one big floor, and it must be better for the smaller houses if it is for the larger ones. Assuming that an ordinary business lot is worth four thousand dollars and the building four thousand more, the total investment would be, say, eight thou¬ sand dollars. Allowing an average of ten per cent for repairs, insurance, interest, etc., it would be necessary to get a rental of eight hundred dollars that money might not be lost on the investment. Half this amount ought to be secured from the renting of one or the other of the floors, at say one-half of the total rent and the rest to be charged to the paper. Four thousand will probably cover the cost of a building thirty by fifty, two stories in height, even if the walls be of brick, and one floor of this size should be ample for a newspaper doing an ordinary business. This would give space for two cylinder presses, two job *Note.— On another page of The Inland Printer Mr. Penfield con¬ ducts a department of criticism, news, experience and advice of particular value to newspaper publishers and editors.— Ed. THE INLAND PRINTER. presses, engine, paper cutter, composing room, and all necessary facilities for office and editorial work. Now, to considering the advantages of a building owned by the publisher of a newspaper. In the first place, if such a building is contemplated, the publisher should devote his efforts to getting in advertising, even if it be neces¬ sary to openly state that such advertising is to be paid for in trade. Secure business from lumber and brick dealers, painters, dealers in plumbers’ supplies and hardware, gas and electric fitters, in fact, every branch of the building trade should be thoroughly worked. Six months’ preliminary advertising should give the publisher a credit of three or four hundred dollars to be worked out in trade. A contract can probably be made with a local builder to put up a building at a special figure. If nothing else be gained the newspa¬ per man is pretty sure to secure a good class of work, for a contractor will be anxious to win as many com¬ plimentary notices as possible. If the newspaper pub¬ lisher will sit down and figure out the amount of busi¬ ness that he can probably secure he will see that the building is not likely to cost him more than one-third of its cash value. Now if he be in a position where he must have the money to pay the contractor when the work is done, he can put a mortgage on the building at a low rate of interest, and he will find that his actual expenses for rent will probably be much less than if someone else put up the building and rented it to him. There is a distinct gain in the fact that he will have secured a large amount of advertising to pay which he might not otherwise be able to get, especially so if it were to be paid for in cash, and also in the further fact that having his building partially paid for, he will in some way get the balance out of the way. With regard to the construction of a building, the architectural part can be adapted to the needs of the business and the prevailing style of buildings in the locality. The workroom may not be finished beyond painting the brickwork with two coats of mineral paint. The office should, of course, be fitted up as business or personal reasons may suggest. There are some few things which are not, as a rule, sufficiently considered in the erection of a building of this sort. The plumbing arrangements are frequently inadequate. A printing office needs plenty of water ; first, for the use of employes ; second, for motive power, assum¬ ing that steam is used ; third, it should be handy for immediate use in case of fire, and this will help keep the insurance rate down. The workroom can be com¬ fortably and yet not expensively fitted up. As much business can be got out in a workroom finished as I have, above described as in one where the walls are “ done up ” in hardwood or plastered and papered, but the same work is not executed at as good a profit if the handsomely finished room be insufficiently heated or badly lighted, as will be the case if money were spent in first providing for the necessaries and letting the finer touches go. Where the building takes up the entire size of the lot, I should most certainly recommend an 1 ‘ offset ’ ’ in the middle of the building about three feet deep by say ten feet long, then no matter what buildings are put up there will always be light in the center of the printing office. Skylights I have generally found to be considerable trouble from the fact that, unless constructed in the best manner (and this cannot always be done in the smaller towns), there is great liability of their leaking, besides the frequent occurrence of being left open over night, with possible damage resulting from a storm. Money should be put into making the floor substantial and rigid, providing against vibration by the presses, or settling by heavy imposing stones, even if it be nec¬ essary for the editor to do his work for a few months in an office that does not have all the cheerful aspects of home. I have gone into this matter of a building with a view to suggesting to publishers that they can acquire an interest in real estate without actually pay¬ ing for it, and I doubt if there are any other branches of business that can secure as much for as little money as the publisher of a country newspaper if he be per¬ severing and industrious.

Horace Teall, in the February issue of The Inland Printer — the facts cited by him come with great force and directness to everyone concerned in the preparation of copy, illustrating as they do the amount of labor entailed upon compositor and proofreader by hasty, careless, thoughtless and indifferent preparation of copy. The burden of this evil has grown to its present proportions by such copy being accepted as presented ; the neg¬ ligent and indifferent attitude of those receiving it has been against their own interests and the time and labor involved in reducing it to the requirements of publisher and author, if carefully computed would be a strong protest against its continuance. The argu¬ ment advanced by the writer of that article, that the compositor and proofreader should receive compensa¬ tion commensurate with the time and labor devoted to the elucidation of bad copy, while just in itself, would not wholly correct or eradicate this evil, and I would like to state a point — if manuscript copy was as uni¬ form as type, and its characters as legible, then this ancient method of preparing copy might go on indefi¬ nitely. The demands of mercantile business have overcome sentiment and relegated handwriting to the archives of the past, and greatly benefited by the sub¬ stitution of the typewriter by its ease, convenience and rapidity of operation, yet printing — especially news¬ paper printing — which has been such a tremendous factor in advancing commercial interests, has not taken that advantage of the typewriter to reproduce copy in the interest of the proofreader and compositor that its 30 THE INLAND PRINTER. rapidity, uniformity and legibility warrants, and which could be used at so little cost compared with the time and labor absorbed in deciphering poor copy. It is also a matter for wonder and regret that authors and others furnishing copy have not universally adopted the typewriter in its preparation, its advantages over handwriting are so apparent, essential and so over¬ whelmingly in its favor that its universal use in the preparation of copy ought to be a matter of fact, not speculation. Typewritten copy would improve the work of the compositor and much facilitate its production. Its speed is such that copy could be revised and corrected so that its presentation to the compositor would mean copy in the true sense of the word, and the minimum of cost would overcome the maximum of labor in such copy, with untold advantages over the present indiffer¬ ent preparation given to it. The compositor himself is strongly handicapped in his efforts to produce com¬ position rapidly, for hand composition is as primitive in its methods as manuscript copy, his capacity for work cannot exceed his endurance, his individual effort by hand in the production of printed matter conveying news of current events is therefore restricted, and could not keep pace with the increasing demands of the age, hence mechanical genius was drawn upon to aid him, and the rapid, progressive improvements in the printing press have in a great measure atoned for his insurmountable shortcoming; insurmountable be¬ cause it was long conceded that mechanism to produce composition, or in other words machine composition, could not be introduced successfully or supplant hand composition, and it is only in recent years that any well directed effort has been made to demonstrate that machine composition is a practical success ; and even though in its infancy and so far given but meager evi¬ dence of vigorous growth, this is simply because it has not yet been presented in its best form for practical and universal operation. But its presence in the com¬ posing .room will more than ever necessitate good copy prepared in such a way as to give the operator all or full benefit of the mechanical facilities at his com¬ mand. This necessity will be recognized by every newspaper and book publishing industry, and they will of themselves see to it and will expect or demand that such copy be furnished to them, when their best interests require it and the improvements of the age are within reach to grant it. Man’s individual effort without the aid of mechanism would take us back cen¬ turies of improvement. The pen has almost yielded to the supremacy of the typewriter, and the same reasons governing the change will make hand composition yield to machine composition, and the full develop¬ ment of its rapidity over the old method of setting up type by hand will never be reached until good copy is furnished to the operator. Of a necessity typewrit¬ ten copy must be furnished, and that in such manner — as it ultimately will be — to develop the advantages of machine composition to its full capacity. Written for The Inland Printer. COMPARISONS IN ADVERTISING. BY M. GEORGIA ORMOND. \"'^^ROAKER and critic are by no \\ means synonymous terms ; ' y V but in the advertising world are strangely confused. From the marsh comes the hoarse, dismal sound of the one, to ridicule and discourage ; while from the solid ground of criticism emanate the more harmonious notes that have to deal with the beauties as well as the faults. The one is cowardly and selfish; the other a commingling of minor and major tones, shows defects in the friendly manner that suggests improvements ; and, as well, commends good qualities — always mind¬ ful that behind all construction of advertisements is some person who has probably done his best, and who deserves at the hand of the reviewer that balm of all criticism — courtesy. It is not, however, the purpose of this paper to pose as an omnipotent criticism ; but merely to show by comparing some current specimens with a few of our suggestions, how advertisements appear under the gaze of feminine eyes. I have heard many women admit that they look first of all at the advertising columns in turning the leaves of a magazine or the sheets of a newspaper. Why this is a feminine trait is easily explained; women Fig. i. instinctively are bargain hunters. Consequently man¬ ufacturers should take cognizance of this fact and turn •it to account. Women, as a rule, are accredited with delicate sensibilities, so, in looking at advertisements, certain qualities seem essential to them. “Beauty,” in the THE INLAND PRINTER. 31 sense of the old -definition in the Roman school — “multitude in unity,’’ is undoubtedly the one word that expresses the woman’s idea of what an advertise¬ ment should possess, and which, translated into the ment, namely, a fitness of words. The title of this advertisement is apt, and the idea of the reading mat¬ ter sensible ; but if shortened to about half, the change would be advantageous and give the added charm of a wide clear margin. Take, for instance, an advertisement of a bicycle, such as illus¬ tration No. 2. With the almost count¬ less maga¬ zines in circu¬ lation, and the scarcity of time to read a tenth of their contents, is it any wonder that a closely printed page, sounding the praises of a wheel, is passed by ? Sketch No. 3 is ventured as an illustration of the suggested improvement for No. 2. Tandems and separate wheels for ladies and gentle¬ men have proved of so much pleasure in picnic parties, etc. , that it seems as if more capital might be made of the fact. No. 4 comes very near to being an exact illustra¬ tion of another point noticed by women. modern terms, means “ an assemblage of properties pleasing to the eye, ear, the intellect, the aesthetic faculty. ’ ’ It must not offend in any of these particulars, while it may please in one more than in another. Why I have never lost a customer. Illustration No. 1 attracts the eye at once with its beauty of pose and curved folds of drapery, catering to the aesthetic faculty in a marked degree. This is a great stride toward achievement of success if followed up assiduously with the second require¬ I so plan, prepare, and place their advertising that it proves permanently profitable. 874 Broadway, N. Y. City. FRANK SEAMAN I22/3 waT^st?’ \" » (AUe 79 Dearborn St., Chicago, Ill. This is a taking advertisement, and would be still more attractive if the whole of it could have been embodied in the verse implying where it is made and where sold. Still, the fault of repetition in prose below it is not so conspicuous as in some specimens. This repetition often amounts to two af¬ firmatives equaling a negative. Of course all ad¬ vertisements ought not to be rhymes, although I should not object if they were ; for I con¬ fess to a weakness of being more strongly attracted toward them than to any other style. 32 THE INLAND PRINTER. There is no reason why illustrated advertisements, especially rhyming ones, might not look as if they had received as much thought in regard to construction and fitness as any poem in the literary part proper of a magazine or paper. In connection with the subject of ponderous word¬ ing, it might be well to mention the advertising stories. In the first place, they are time consumers ; but, in addition to this, are calculated to raise the ire when we discover that we have been deceived by something that promised entertainment, when in reality it only wanted to put in a peg for itself. The most objectiona¬ ble feature of this style of advertising might be avoided by mentioning incidentally here and there through the story the article to be marketed, instead of reserving the shock for the last line and large type. In direct contrast to this is that of illustration No. 5, which is especially well adapted to the adver¬ tiser’s purpose. It employs brevity and terseness, instantly implying a speedy dispatch of business that is captivating. In illustration No. 6 the main points of a good advertisement have been grasped and well handled. Baking powder firms, especially, have the field where a little ‘ 1 levity ’ ’ is permissible. Without being told, people as a rule know that baking powders are used for raising, and that there is not, after all, much difference in the various kinds ; so that about the only vulnerable point of attack remaining is to attract attention by giving the reader at least a mild pleasure. To this I will revert in a future article. More noticeable than all, however, is the lack of artistic skill displayed in advertising the most beauti¬ ful things that seek a market — flowers. These little ‘ ‘ bunched up ’ ’ pictures of potted plants weighed down with blossoms out of all proportion are painful to behold, and remind one of the ‘ 1 evergreens ’ ’ that dot the streets of miniature models of cities. In looking over the March magazines and papers, I fail to find but one specimen that is at all pretty ; this is one of sweet peas. Pen-and-ink sketches of sprays of flowers admit of so many more touches that recom¬ mend them to the eye, that it is strange that they are not more employed — for flowers lend themselves to such varied treatment. No. 7, it occurs to me, is more pleasing than No. 8. A simple list of plants, etc., to be advertised, placed on the blank space, would complete its useful¬ ness. In a word, pleasing others and profit to self are so inseparable, that an advertisement aiming to com¬ bine these two qualities carries with it an air of gener¬ osity, and a force that augurs well for the firm using it. The Franco-American soup advertisement No. 9, I have heard severely criticised by a number of women. It is unfortunate that the mistake should have been made of creating an unpleasant impression on the very class which manufacturers ought to be most desirous ol pleasing, for as a rule the woman of the house superin¬ tends the marketing, and prejudice in her mind is hard to eradicate. With¬ out question No. 9 attracts attention and holds it — two important factors of successful advertising — but it is overshadowed by the fact that a point has been scored to its own det¬ riment ; for thoughts of a dripping barnyard fowl rising out of. one’s soup in all the glory of pin-feathers, and soaring away, or stalking off\" on stilts, is any¬ thing but appetizing. Neither is the scene of a cook strenuously endeavoring to supply the kitchen THE INLAND PRINTER. 33 altar with a feline sacrifice calculated to whet the appetite or induce a woman to invest ; for, tiy as she may, the first impression “do linger,’’ crowing and mewing in her ear. Sketch No. io it seems would be better calculated to create a pleasant sen¬ sation. This would attract a camping party off for the mountains — say the Adirondacks, where deer hunting, fishing, etc., are so popular. In face of the prob¬ ability of days of disappointed zeal for the huntsman, it will be with self-congratulations that the women who superintend the packing of the camping traps — and mean to be of the party — will tuck in a goodly supply of just such canned provision, and ever after have grateful recollections of it. The propriety of using all such phases of pleasuring to contribute toward large sales is self-evident. The stilt gymnast may crow in vain, where an advertisement that gives a glimpse of real comfort, convenience and pleasure, will be to some purpose. But perhaps this savors of croaking, and is leading out toward the marsh lands. I"
