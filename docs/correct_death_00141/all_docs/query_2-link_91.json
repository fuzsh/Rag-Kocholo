        "text": "In this prompt, William Jennings Bryan builds his argument by referencing history, using imagery, and relating it to the audience’s beliefs. As soon as he begins he uses strong relatable words such as “boldly”, “creatively”, “victory”, and “crusades”. He somewhat makes it seem like they are about to enter this vigorous gurgling battle that will go down in history when he says “began the conflict with a zeal approaching the zeal which inspired the crusaders who followed Peter the Hermit. Our silver Democrats went forth from victory unto victory, until they are assembled now, not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment rendered by the plain people of this country.” He then continues using this persuasive language to convey his…\n\nEvent: Scopes Monkey Trial Information on the event: John Thomas Scopes was a young high school substitute teacher, was hired by the ACLU or the American Civil LIberties Union to teach evolution, the theory that animals change over time based off surroundings; this theory states that humans descended from apes.

The theory of…\n\nThe 1896 presidential election between William Jennings Bryan and William McKinley was a fairly tough race.

The front pages of newspapers like The New York Times were dominated by the case for days. More than 200 newspaper reporters from all parts of the country and two from London were in Dayton. Twenty-two…\n\nDuring the 1896 election, William Jennings Bryan, was defeated by the hands of the Republican candidate, William McKinley.

The corporate model had won, they defeated the Populist alternative, which combined public, private, and cooperative ownership. It also offered a more inclusive and humane form of development. However, even…\n\nWilliam Bryan Jennings When asked today about William Jennings Bryan, several people would probably remember him as a die-hard Presbyterian that went against a substitute teacher for violating the law of teaching of evolution in schools, as a consequence today people don't realize how William Bryan \"did more than any other man\" by transforming the Democratic \"party from a bulwark of laissez-faire into the citadel of liberalism\" by using related religious principles as a foundation for his…\n\nResults of the trial Scopes’ defense was more problematic. Once a plea of innocence had been lodged, Darrow moved to quash the indictment against his client by arguing that the Butler Law was a ‘foolish, mischievous, and wicked act . . . as brazen and bold an attempt to destroy liberty as ever was seen in the Middle Ages.’ Neal went on to point out how the Tennessee constitution held that ‘no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.’ Since the…\n\nMoral Relativism is an urban idea of intellectualism that discarded God.

The teachers felt that academic freedom and integrity as well as separation of church and state was at stake. Twenty four year old science teacher and football coach John T. Scopes would teach the class. Knowing he would be arrested Scopes taught…\n\ntrial was a true incident of unlawfulness, there lies within a controversy that resonates the idea that this trial contained no true legal value, it simply allowed for more tourist dollars and publicity in the small town of Dayton (Singham 23). In all actuality it is exceedingly unclear whether John Thomas Scopes truly taught evolution during his substitute teaching career (26-27).
