Dick Russell Is a fairly typical businessman at Western Electric. Ronald Lewis is a fairly typical jewelry store owner. Except that Dick is white and Ronald is black. And it's not very typical for white men to spend spare time in Harlem or black men to own prosperous jewelry stores. What they have in common is the Workshop in Business Opportunities, which originated in Harlem. It's sponsored and staffed by volunteer businessmen. The aim: help small-business men become better managers. Ronald, owner of Nok Jewelers in Harlem, is a graduate of the Workshop. Dick, a systems manager in Western Electrics Defense Activities Division, is a Workshop instructor. Dick became interested through Volunteers In Action (VIA), an employee group at Western Electric. Helping people with their business problems is tough, demanding work. And when a business is in Harlem, it's even tougher. But to Western Electric and the many' employees like Dick, who take part in VIA on their own time, it's rewarding and necessary work.

Check the hooks you have failed to read through oversight or overbusyness THE SELF-PORTRAIT YOU HAVE DRAWN may reveal a sobering fact: the extreme degree to which you have allowed the irritating busyness of your life to keep you from the books you promise yourself to read. There is a simple way to break this bad habit: mem- bership in the Book-of-the-Month Club. YOUR CHOICE IS WIDE • Your only obligation, under the special offer below, is to buy three books during your first year of membership, in addition to the three you select now, from at least 200 made avail- able. You may cancel your membership any time after buying three books. YOU BUY WHAT YOU PLEASE • You receive a full re- port on the Book-of-the-Month in advance. If you want it, you let it come. If not, you send back a form (always provided) specifying another book. Or you simply check a box telling us to send no book. YOU PAY LESS • Because of the Club's large editions, you usually pay less than you otherwise would even though a small charge is added for postage and han- dling. But there is another saving greater than this. IF YOU CONTINUE AFTER THIS TRIAL, you earn a Book- Dividend Credit for every Club Selection or Alter- nate you buy. Each Credit, upon payment of a nominal sum, often only SI. 00 or $1.50— somewhat more for unusually expensive volumes and sets— en- titles you to a valuable Book-Dividend which you may choose from over 100 line library volumes now available. Since the inauguration of the Club's Book- Dividend system, $458,000,000 worth of books (re- tail value) has been received by Club members through this unique plan. GOOD SENSE FOR 1969 • You will probably buy some Book-of-the-Month Club Selections anyway. Why not buy tliem from the Club? You usually pay less and also share in the advantages of the Club's Book-Dividend plan. Perhaps most important, you keep from missing the new books you want to read. r « I BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB, INC. j 280 Pork Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017 A67-1 | Please enroll me as a member or the Book-of-the-Month Club ■ I and send me the three volumes whose numbers I have indicated in • I boxes below, billing me SI. 00 for all three volumes.

It is by all odds the finest thing he has ever done. I don't know anyone who seems to be able to see our society and people more clearly. John Holt Boston, Mass. When I got your last issue. I felt distrustful about the subject. I was expecting, as I knew him, another raucous tern from t lie tribe of Tin New York Review o] Books. But you did it. You hatched an eagle. What special brand of vitamins did you feed Mailer to have suddenly such a write1-'.' Just wonderful, and per- ceptive too. Giorgio Dk Santillana MIT Cambridge, Mass. ... I do not care for any more \"reporting\" with overtones of Yip- pies, Hippies, and Eldridge Cleaver. If Norman Mailer chooses to live that sort of life, let him— but please don't present it as the way of life, especially the way of life of young people in general. . . . Mrs. Barclay D. Samson Kalamazoo. Mich. ... I wish to express my utter unappreciation of having Norman Mailer forced into my home. I have never given him house-room before, and to have his pomposities (\"the reporter\") brought inside my door without my choice is distressing, to say the least. . . . James h. Fleming Chicago, 111. So now you've gone and done it again— another entire (almost ) issue given over to that horrible Mailer. What is this love affair? Are you planning to turn over your magazine every six months or so to air his bathroom philosophy? I did not sub- scribe to Harper's to be bludgeoned twice yearly by Mailer.

Ontario Canada TV Journalism No one who has ever cussed and decried the generally poor quality of TV newscasting can seriously quar- rel with any of the points raised in Robert MacNeil's article P'The News on TV and How It Is Unmade.\" October], but I would like to report that there is a bright spot in this sorry picture here in the San Fran- cisco Bay area. In September Channel 9, KQED. our educational channel, operating under a Ford Foundation grant, be- gan to prove for an hour each evening, five nights a week, that a TV news show can, even as a good newspaper, shed some light on important events of our times. This outstanding pro- gram, which has already caused at least one commercial station in the area to alter its format, features none of the \"action footage\" or other razzle-dazzle which is a commonplace of most TV news coverage. Where the program wins out . . . lies in the management's willingness to allow the staff to explore subjects in depth. . . . Mac-Neil charged that most TV news departments do not regard \"digging for facts as (their) primary function.\" and that they tend to \"sub- ordinate the reporter's role\" and for \"recording action rather probing significance.\" He wouldH well pleased, I think, with KQE1 opposite approach to these mah which, coupled with a freedom f« fear of sacred cows, has set ' \"Newsroom\" program some dista1 apart from other news shows in Bay Area. William R. Willl Berkeley, Cl 4 Robert MacNeil's revelations? how TV \"unmakes the news\" are surprising, given his BBC-type appointments in American TV. W 1 is extraordinary is the quality of* j hypothesizing about TV and > t Vietnam War. He hypothesizes: 4 t exposing mass audiences to ml I vivid and more horrible battle eve, I than have ever before been brou. into American homes but by cutt out the most unbearable it may that television has built up feeling that war is really beara (my emphasis). . . . Where MacNeil propose to fit into his pothesis the simple fact that th most exposed to the extreme u nesses of war, who can smell putrid horrors, who do not wa strangers dying on a small scr but comrades in agony along? them, still do not notably turn 1 protestors against war? . . . He makes a lengthy compl! about the star system in TV jour^j ism. He ignores the same sort star system evolved in newspal journalism, e.g., a James Res1| Walter Lippmann, Arthur Kr< rising above the anonymities f newspaper reporting by the fun' mental mystery of a few people h' ing sufficient individual talents to, so. . . . MacNeil's criticisms of the 1 of depth reporting on TV are f standard complaint that has bi made about journalism ever sifl?' there was anything like journalii It is offered by those who, fortun enough to have been exposed to s scholarship, then assume that jo\\ nalisvi should be scholarship.

Address } City .State. -Zip 10 The Easy Chair by John Fischer LETTER FROM LEETE'S ISLAND: Field Notes on the Manners, Morals, and Customs of the Connecticut Yankee Wi„ m I was growing up in Texas, I learned that New Knglanders are a mean-spirited rate, stingy, Puritani- cal, taciturn, and shrewd. This was received doctrine in a family which consisted '>n one side of unrepentant Confederates and on the other of poor farmers who had for generations believed that they were harshly used by Yankee mortgage-holders in Bos- ton and Hartford. Now that I have been living among Yankees for nearly a year. I am be- ginning to suspect that such a view- still common throughout much of the South and West- might be a little myopic. They are indeed peculiar peo- ple, different in many ways from the Americans I have known elsewhere; but the differences are not what I had expected. Hence these notes on what I have discpvered so far about the real character of New England- ers, or at least their Coastal Con- necticut subculture. The observation post, or blind, for these sightings is an old yellow farm house perched on a bluff above the shore of Leete's Island. It is a good spot for surveillance: to the south, of the gulls and sail boats on Long Island Sound, to the north, of Yan- kee behavior. To the east and west lie woods, alarmingly overpopulated with woodchucks who also need some surveillance if I can ever get around to it. Four hundred years ago the Island actually was one, a member in good standing of an archipelago now known as The Thimbles. The shallows Harper's Magazine, January 1969 between it and the Connecticut main- land gradually silted up, however, and turned into salt marshes. When cause- ways were thrown across these marsh- es to carry a road and the New Haven railway, Leete's Island became, to all intents, a peninsula; but during big hurricanes it turns back into an island again for two or three days at a stretch. Few New Yorkers have ever heard of it (as 1 had not until a couple of years ago) but, unknowingly, most of them see a bit of it every day. For much of New York City is built of Leete's Island granite, a distinctive pinkish-gray stone which forms the spine of the peninsula. Because gla- ciers had scoured away much of the top soil, the granite was easy to quarry and it could be loaded directly onto barges for cheap shipment to the city, a hundred miles to the south- west. It was used, therefore, to build such monuments as the Brooklyn Bridge and the base of the Statue of Liberty, and also for street curbings and the stonework in many an office building-including Two Park Ave- nue, where this magazine is pub- lished. The quarry— the only industry the Island ever had— is closed now; it couldn't compete with reinforced con- crete. But the families of a few of its Italian and Croatian stonecutters still live in the neighborhood. Although some of them have been around for generations, they are still regarded as newcomers as my wife and I will be, for as long as we live. Fair enough, too. A really settled resident in these parts is someone like my neighbors, William and Lawre: Leete. They raise dairy cattle and cord wood on land which came d to them from an earlier Will Leete, the first governor of colo Connecticut. He landed in 1639 the shipload of English emigr who founded the village of Guil four miles east of here. Their na are all listed in the local recor although the name of the ship— a tonner— somehow has been misl Of the twenty-five names on that lii fifteen are still common in the to ship.

So much for myth of the noble savage, suppose happy and tranquil until the coming the whites. Homer's blindness may have been a blessing. For the gods seem to have replaced his eyes with remarkable insight. You can read his Odyssey and Iliad even today and learn why some men become heroes and others remain earthbound failures. Why some nations become great, while others fall apart. These epic stories— first chanted 2,500 years ago along the Aegean— are the oldest known, perhaps the greatest writings of Western man.

He suffers, alas, from cysts in his feet which make it necessary for him to wear stockings. All the men here- abouts whose feet are big enough save up their worn socks for him. The third building is the railway station, about the size of a box stall, with a dirt floor and a [dank bench along the back wall. Since the New Haven line has long been in bank- ruptcy, the station hasn't been paint- ed in living memory and its scabrous appearance is an embarrassment to the community. A few years back Bert Stickney wrote the manager of the road, offering to paint the station at his own expense. He go1 back a nice letter saying thank you, no; if nonunion labor so much as laid a brush on any New Haven structure, the company would have a strike on its hands. Anyhow the station does provide shelter from the rain and a frayed tie with the outside world. A one-car local stops there twice a day— at 7:15 A.M., heading for Stony Creek, Pine Orchard, and eventually New York, and again at 6:00 in the evening, on its way back toward Guilford and New London. Usually it carries at least one Leete's Island passenger each way, and on summer weekends it may have five or six. Some days, of course, it doesn't show up. The Xew Haven's venerable rolling stock tends to get discouraged and quit under adversity such as a snowstorm, or a heavy dew. As you can see, there is nothing su- perfluous about either the train serv- ice or the community it serves. After putting up for twenty-five years with the superfluities of New York— includ- ing noise, dirt, people, chaos, and a cornucopia of goodies that I don't want— I find the spareness of Leete's Island especially satisfying. The business district is a strategic place for watching Islanders. For example, Dorothy Emery, a widow who lives just up the road in what used to be a quarryman's house; she and Jake, her late husband, turned its eleven acres, including an aban- Mr. Fischer will desert Leete's Island from January throityh March this year to serve as Regents Professor at the Santa Cruz campus of the Uni- versity of California. doned quarry pond, into the best ex- ample of landscaping on the Island. Or her next-door neighbor, Doc Hol- ley, a retired Negro pharmacist and highly regarded elder of the commu- nity; he sent his son through Yale medical school, and his views are often sought on subjects ranging from local herbs to real-estate values. A broader spectrum of Yankee character is on view just beyond the woods in Guilford, where chores or business take me a couple of times a week. After nearly four hundred years it is still a minute village, which looks as if it might have been de- signed by Grandma Moses as The Classic New England Country Town- complete with elm-shaded green, monument to the Union dead, white church spires, tinker's shop. Odd Fel- lows Hall, and lots of eighteenth-cen- tury saltbox homes. This appearance is entirely deceptive, for reasons to be noted in a moment. Guilford is, however, full of prime specimen Yankees. One of my favor- ites is Doris Montgomery, who runs our bank: once the Guilford Trust Company, now a branch of the Second National of New Haven— the only Second National bank I ever heard of. I'm told that she is a sound banker with a firm grasp of computer book- keeping and price-earnings ratios; that I'm not competent to judge, but I do know that she is a warm-natured woman who somehow makes her bank feel as comfortable as a farm kitchen. It is, apparently, a matriarchy. Occa- sionally I've glimpsed a man behind one of the back desks, but the impor- tant jobs— from the safe-deposit vault to the teller's windows— are all han- dled by women. There is a playpen, with assorted toys, in the lobby, and one of the girls is always glad to take domestic messages or mind a bag of groceries while a customer tends to other errands around town. For twenty-five years I had an account in a New York City bank just across the street from my office. In all that time none of the bank's employees ever learned to recognize me; every time I cashed a check I had to identify myself, and the teller invariably looked up my account to see if the balance would cover it. At Doris's bank all of the ladies knew me by the time of my second visit, and they apparently carry my balance in their pretty heads. The boys in Page's hardware ai next door to the bank, have this sQ knack. They now know as much afl my house maintenance problems do, and often tell me a better cheaper ) way to mend a chest drawers or fence rabbits out of garden patch. From such people, and a few d< others whom I've come to know pn well, I am working out a tenta' revision of my inherited concept- New Englanders. Tacit urn t hey are not .

They are all inter- dependent, for their livelihood and their culture. Their hip problems are common ones, which none of the com- ponent communities can solve alone. But the Connecticut Yankees are tackling these problems, it seems to me, with better sense than most of the other people who inhabit the Super- City. For one thing-, they don't huddle so close together. When you drive through Connecticut, much of it looks like farming country or even wilder- ness, lint this is a happy illusion. The whole state is essentially industrial; only :5 per cent of its people make their living from farming. All the rest work in factories, or in the service trades— from filling stations to uni- versities—which are industry's hand- maidens. Yet most of Connecticut's manufacturing is not jammed to- gether in huge, grimy, slum-raddled concentrations, such as New York's garment district or the steel centers of Gary and Pittsburgh. 'There are a few exceptions, such as Bridgeport and New Haven; but even they are comparatively small cities, and they are coping rather hopefully with their typical urban woes.) The distinctive characteristic of the state's industry is its scatteration through hundreds of little towns and open countryside. Modern technology makes this kind of site planning feasible for a wide range of industry. Guilford, for example— in spite of its Grandma Moses guise— is really a manufacturing town. It has more than thirty factories, making a broad variety of products: pharmaceuticals, magnetic wire, conveyor belts, pre- cision tools, flexible tubing, electrical fittings, and photocopiers, to mention only a few. Yet it has no \"factory dis- trict.\" The plants are dotted at wide intervals all over the 46 square miles of the township. One occupies a con- verted trolley barn ; others are tucked away in the forest or screened by landscaping so that a casual visitor is unlikely to notice them. All of them are fairly small, with work forces ranging from three or four men up to a couple of hundred. Most are in fields requiring modern technology, or at least considerable skill; wages, as a result, are relatively THE EASY CHAIR high. A case in point is the Guilford Brass Foundry, a mile down the road from our home. It is a modest shop, no bigger t ban a good-sized barn, sur- rounded on three sides by woods. To my wife it looked like just the place to take a prized old brass kettle which needed mending. The manager looked at it with interest, but shook his head. \"Twenty years ago we would have been glad to take on this kind of job,\" he said, \"but we can't do it now. We're too busy trying to catch up on our orders for radar components.\" He sent her instead to Tinker Hub- bard, an elderly gentleman who can fix anything from a lawn mower to a turret lathe. Such work is as much hobby as profession, since he comes from an Old Family and owns a lot of land hereabout. A Guilford factory hand can go home for lunch, if he is of a mind to, often on foot. He is more than likely to own a skiff with an outboard motor, which he uses for fishing on evenings and weekends, and a shotgun for hunting ducks in the marshes. Oys- ters, clams, and mussels are a familiar part of his diet, since they can be had for the taking, in season, in a dozen bays and estuaries. (I have collected the makings of an unsurpassable monies marinieres in ten minutes from the tidal ledge at the edge of our yard; in a New York restaurant it vould cost at least five dollars. > Any- one who can't be bothered to catch his own fish can pick them up at the town harbor, which accommodates a small commercial fishing fleet. And the three markets offer excellent locally grown meats and vegetables at prices a Manhattan housewife wouldn't believe. All this may have something to do with the fact that none of my infor- mants could remember when Guilford last had a strike— although several factories are organized and labor is anything but \"docile.\" (Docility is not a Yankee c haracteristic. I The men aren't afraid for their jobs, either, because unemployment is neg- ligible; jobs are going a-begging, in fact, in a number of trades. That is one reason why the town's welfare budget is only $1 0,(575 for the current year. The other is that hardly anybody is willing to go on the poor rolls so long as he (or she) can lift a hand.
