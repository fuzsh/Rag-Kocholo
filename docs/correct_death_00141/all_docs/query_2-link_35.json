        "text": "Explore history\n\nRhea County was founded in 1807, and is named for Tennessee politician and Revolutionary War veteran John Rhea. As you will learn from visiting the newly renovated Rhea Heritage and Scopes Trial Museum, the county has a rich history.\n\nHowever, a single 1925 event placed Dayton on the world-map—the Scopes Trial. The Butler Act, a newly passed Tennessee law, made teaching evolution in public schools illegal. The Scopes Trial resulted from a plan by the American Civil Liberties Union to test the law, and a desire by Dayton leaders to attract business to the community. Rhea County Central High School teacher John T. Scopes agreed to be the defendant.\n\nThe Scopes Trial was one of the first to be referred to as the \"Trial of the Century.\" William Jennings Bryan, former Secretary of State and three-time candidate for President, played a role as prosecutor in the trial. Clarence Darrow, the famous trial lawyer, was the most prominent lawyer on Scopes’ defense team."
