Kinuyo Tanaka is in it and figures in an apparently legendary sequence shot at the end.\n\nAlso, I'd like to challenge Lubitsch re: Hara. I've only seen her in her Ozu films and I completely understand the criticisms of her constant grimacing and her wholesome-virgin persona (these annoy me in Late Spring, actually). However I think elsewhere Ozu used her in ways that deconstructed that persona. For example in Early Summer she's at odds with traditions of omiai etc, traditions that I see as shorthand for pre-war imperialist attitudes in almost all of Ozu's post-war films, and while devoted to her family she deviates from them where it matters most. In Tokyo Story her character is shown to be playing the good daughter-in-law out of an unfulfilling feeling of duty, and in The End of Summer she is shown as a spinster who has let her life pass her by whilst playing the 'good daughter' role. In all of these films but the latter two especially, her smile really is a grimace most of the time and she gives off a unique vibe of desperation and loss from the edges of scenes, especially during her entries and exits to and from the frame. She was never as versatile as some of her contemporaries, though.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#403 Post by the preacher » Thu Jan 05, 2012 4:55 pm\n\nMEXICO\n\nAhí está el detalle (Juan Bustillo Oro, 1940)\n\nEl baisano Jalil (Joaquín Pardavé, 1942)\n\nHistoria de un gran amor (Julio Bracho, 1942)\n\nUna carta de amor (Miguel Zacarías, 1943)\n\nDistinto amanecer (Julio Bracho, 1943)\n\nDoña Bárbara (Fernando de Fuentes & Miguel M.

The white doctor refuses to treat the poor couple, but a curandera helps the child. Later the father, Quino (Pedro Armendáriz), finds a large pearl in the ocean that may be worth millions. Suddenly everyone wants to be friends with the poor couple, including the pearl-collecting doctor. As greed and frenzy inflame the village, Quino and his wife (María Elena Marqués) must flee, and eventually they are hunted like animals. La perla is one of Emilio Fernandez's greatest films, from his most successful period. Based on a short novel by John Steinbeck (who also wrote the screenplay). Steinbeck's fable-like tale works perfectly with the Fernandez-Figueroa style (too bad they didn't collaborate more often!). Available on its own DVD or paired with another Armendariz classic, Distinto amanecer.\n\nFilm of the decade: The Other One (Roberto Gavaldón, 1946)\n\nThis twisted film noir stars Dolores del Río in a dual role as rival twins. Maria is a poor manicurist while Magdalena is the recently widowed wife of a millionaire. Always the “bad girl,” Maria hatches a murderous plan to take her sister’s place,only to discover—upon assuming her sister’s identity—that Magdalena wasn’t quite the “good girl” she made herself out to be. As a woman tormented by inner demons and grappling with the unimaginable truth of her sister’s secrets, del Río turns in a riveting performance on par with Joan Crawford at her melodramatic finest. Assisted by cinematographer Alex Phillips and production designer Gunther Gerszo, Gavaldón transforms the sophisticated spaces of Mexico City’s upper classes into a world of baroque shadows and foreboding. La otra was remade by Hollywood in 1964 as the Bette Davis vehicle Dead Ringers. -UCLA Film Archive\n\nBoth Fernández and Gavaldón signed even better films later (Víctimas del pecado / Macario), but these two are great examples of their talent.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#404 Post by Cold Bishop » Fri Jan 06, 2012 2:56 am\n\nSubtitles for the latter may be forthcoming, if anyone's interested.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#405 Post by Wu.Qinghua » Fri Jan 06, 2012 7:23 am\n\nAh, there's the post on Mexican 40s cinema. My favorite Mexican movie which will rank pretty high on my list, will most likely be Fernandez' marvellous feature Maria Candelaria (Mexico 1943). I guess it has found a dodgy DVD release in the US some years ago; the unsubtitled Mexican disc I've seen, is also rather shabby, but the movie itself offers a lovely and very well-made and beautifully shot melodram which was awarded in Cannes in '46 and differs very favourably from all the war-related 40s stuff by its focus on social affairs and indigenous Mexicans, on racism and social ostracism as well as by taking up the cudgels for the poor and the outcast. There's a short introduction for a cinematic screening of the film to be found on Youtube, which though not being great may offer some help in watching the film and which does contain no spoilers.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#406 Post by thirtyframesasecond » Fri Jan 06, 2012 9:38 am\n\nThe preacher - given that time's running out, would you recommend I watch any of these following films I can get hold of - The great madcap, Alla en el rancho grande, Black anguish, Gran casino, Maria Candelaria.

Maybe someone else has also already seen it and likes to add a few points to mine? 'Illegals' is a somewhat bristle, but fine docudrama about the migration of European Jews from Central Europe to British-governed Palestine in the aftermath of the Shoah and the War, which Levin made for 'Americans for Haganah'. The film begins amidst the rubble of the Warsaw Ghetto and combines the fictional story of a young couple which is crossing several borders illegaly on its way to Palestine with documentary material portraying Jewish institutions involved in the operation as well as the undercover journey itself which in this case ended when the ship and the film crew were brought up by the British navy in sight of the coast of Palestine.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#409 Post by Gropius » Sat Jan 07, 2012 4:23 pm\n\nTwo more noteworthy shorts, both of which will be on my list:\n\nThe Eye and the Ear (Stefan & Franciszka Themerson, 1945) [YouTube]: An experiment in 'visual music' in the most literal sense, using photography and animation to create visual counterparts to songs by Szymanowski. In contrast to the somewhat lighter tone of McLaren or Fischinger, this is presented rather seriously, in the manner of a formal scientific experiment, and the technical voiceover may put some viewers off. The Themersons - Polish émigrés in Britain - apparently lost interest in film after this project, which seems a shame. (Their earlier propaganda piece, Calling Mr. Smith, has dated less well.)\n\nPacific 231 (Jean Mitry, 1949) [YouTube]*: Working in a modernist lineage that includes the city symphonies of the 20s and the industrial documentaries of the 30s, Mitry expertly fits footage of a single train journey to the existing musical piece by Arthur Honegger. Clocking in at around 10 minutes, it is a work of satisfying structural integrity, of a kind that had become all too rare by the 1940s.\n\n* also on the Kino Avant-Garde 2 set, which includes a number of 40s American shorts of interest\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#410 Post by knives » Sat Jan 07, 2012 4:39 pm\n\nIf we're talking shorts (and admittedly these aren't as classy as your suggestions) I'd like to throw out Horton Hatches the Egg and the original Woody Woodpecker short. The later makes Tex Avery entirely redundant and is the greatest work of slapstick ever while the former is a beautiful combining of the sensibilities of Dr. Seuss and Termite Terrace by who may very well be their best director ever Bob Clampett.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#411 Post by knives » Sat Jan 07, 2012 6:51 pm\n\nLydia\n\n\"Haha, remember that time you tried to rape me? That's a good memory.\"\n\nI Was a Male War Bride\n\nWho would thought that the film with the premise of aren't men and women different would be one of the best ever? While I think I still prefer Ball of Fire this has to be Hawks smartest movie that I've met. The premise is just begging for failure, but due to a mixture of respect for the audience and respect for both genders we get a complex look at the meaninglessness of gender roles ultimately that is relevant even today. It's not just that those roles are flipped here which goes a long way to show how they're pointless, but also how both genders get propped up unfairly by the values society places on them. The movie very easily even with it's point of view could have been a bland showing of how hard it is to be a woman or some other generic point, but instead it goes a long way to show the stupid prejudices against both genders that exist. My particular favorite moment of these is when Grant is just trying to find a bed. That sequence may be the best non-Archers one of the decade. It doesn't hurt either that in addition to intelligence the film is just hilarious. It pulls off every kind of joke beautifully and with extreme assurance. Hell it even manages to make potty and transvestite humour work.\n\nBrute Force\n\nReally with just a few cosmetic changes this could be the equal to Caged and Dassin's best. There's a lot of great things to offer here, but I'm sure everyone already knows them. Instead I'll lodge my complaints. Take out the flashbacks and the film will not only be just as powerful, but also better paced. All of the present day stuff hints at what the flashbacks tell rendering them useless (and also if you took them out Reservoir Dogs would be a better movie too). The other big thing is that despite Cronyn's excellent performance his character makes the film feel all the more usual for his blatant villainy. In his first scene there was the promise of an other Lermontov afoot where I might necessarily agree with the character, but his heart would be in the right place and I'd feel sympathetic to his point of view. Instead we get basically a Nazi which renders the film less complex emotionally. There are a few Hollywood parts to the film I can forgive or that I feel make the film better (what comes of their escape attempt is surely a Hays code thing), but that one hurts the film significantly for me. It doesn't need a villain.\n\nWhistling in the Dark\n\nSo Conrad Veidt wasn't always a Hollywood Nazi I guess. Red Skelton is the real surprise here as this is the first time I didn't want to murder him on screen. The plot is fairly generic, but done so swiftly and with enough fun that I can't help but be won over despite the film being nothing special.\n\nEscape\n\nNow had LeRoy made every one of his movies as good as this one he'd be an absolute favorite. This is an other Nazi film that is surprisingly smart even if it runs into one to many silly propaganda moments. The cinematography has a noir-ish veneer to it while the central story of a man trying to free his wrongfully imprisoned mother is deftly handled and explored fully. It actually reminds me a little of The Third Man with it's American lost in Germany thing and even how it views his relationship with Europe compared to his naivety. Of course this film has a more pro-American sentiment to it, but there's still this sense of one man's failure at any cost present. Definitely one of the better members of the genre.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#412 Post by matrixschmatrix » Sat Jan 07, 2012 7:50 pm\n\nknives wrote: Brute Force\n\nThe other big thing is that despite Cronyn's excellent performance his character makes the film feel all the more usual for his blatant villainy.

On the one hand, I think it's true that as a systemic examination of the horrors of imprisonment, the movie would have been better off if everyone involved genuinely thought themselves a good person- as is usually the case with systemic evils- and it is difficult to see Cronyn as anything other than a fully self aware sadistic Nazi. On the other hand, I thought he seemed cruelly and terribly realistic. Prisons still attract more than their share of sadists now, and it's my understanding that monsters not unlike Cronyn were as much the rule as the exception at the time in the real system. Moreover, part of the systemic critique the movie makes is about the way in which the prison system allows Cronyn to act unchecked, while everyone else is utterly powerless- surely, that would be less compelling if Cronyn weren't such a cruel and fascistic man.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#413 Post by knives » Sat Jan 07, 2012 8:33 pm\n\nI see that point of view and I agree it could work, but his encounters with the doctor and the playing of Wagner seemed to push it too far for me. There was a way to make him fascist and disagreeable without talking down to the audience which the film occasionally slips into with that charcter.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#414 Post by domino harvey » Sat Jan 07, 2012 8:44 pm\n\nThought you were talking about Mankiewicz's Escape (from 1948-- the confusion is reasonable!) and I was pretty puzzled on so many of your points haha\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#415 Post by knives » Sat Jan 07, 2012 8:48 pm\n\nI would've thought mentioning the director in the first sentence would have cleared that up.

I like Erich von Stroheim in general, but this must be one of his very, very best performances. He plays a disfigured man, shunned by the ladies, who finds love with a beautiful blind girl and does everything to make a happy home for her. But then the girl has an operation which makes her see again, and of course she's shocked about Stroheim's appearance, but she is also torn between her repulsion and her thankfulness to him. And so she goes on pretending to be blind... Well, very blunt plot summary for a very complex and visually stunning film. Someone called this \"the dark side of Beauty and the Beast\" or something to that effect, and that puts it very well. Sologne looks positively ethereal here, and both her and Stroheim's acting is deeply touching. Add to this camerawork which owes a lot to the visual aesthethics of silent films, great use of light and shade and mesmerising 'atmosphere'. This is a masterpiece, and should really get a proper release from the likes of Criterion.\n\nL'eternel retour (Jean Delannoy, 1943). This is at least a little better known as it has a very good restored release on a French dvd, and thankfully it's also floating around with some fan subs. Although Delannoy is the director of this, it's actually a complete Cocteau film, who not only wrote the script, but whose 'presence' can be felt everywhere, and not just because Jean Marais plays the male lead. It's a modernisation of the old Tristan and Isolde story, very stylish, with Marais and Sologne both being 'ultra-blonde' giving this a rather 'Germanic' touch. Absolutely captivating performance by the two leads, fantastic cinematography which again enhances the 'mythical' aspects of the story.\n\nApart from these two, I also watched Dieterle's Kismet, basically because I like Marlene Dietrich and colourful Hollywood 'Arabian nights' movies in general, but I must say I found it a complete letdown. Well, Dietrich's much talked-about dance number may be quite acceptable, but the film suffers from a stagey script, and the generally dull acting brings this close to parody in places. Awful. Don't even begin to think of The Thief of Bagdad here.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#419 Post by Cold Bishop » Mon Jan 09, 2012 3:10 am\n\nJuke Girl (Curtis Bernhardt, 1942)\n\nVery fascinating and entertaining film. It lies in The Grapes of Wrath's shadow, unmistakably from the opening frames: the overstuffed jalopies and talks of dusted-out farms standing as the last remnants of a Depression already swallowed up by the War economy by the time the film hit the streets. But if Grapes of Wrath is the hardcover edtion de luxe, full leather binding, bevelled and gilded all around, then Juke Girl is the pulp paperback turning yellow around the edges. It's fast, snappy, unpretentious, moving breezily between moments of two-fisted action and cornball warmth. With it's story of blue-collar professionals battling for survival, it's also informed by They Drive By Night, and it's no doubt why A.I. Bezzerides got the assignment. Without passing any judgement of superiority, I think it's fair to say the film is more fun and affable than the Ford, more lively and energetic than the Walsh. Ronald Reagan has never been more charming, even if he is saddled with a Henry Fonda impersonation (Just three months after starring opposite Bob Cumming's Fonda in Kings Row ); I'm still not convinced the guy has much range as an actor, but these two films are good example of scripts operating at his wavelength. Ann Sheridan is back, perfecting her hard-bitten b-girl persona to a tee: how she never became one of film noir's major femme fatales is beyond me. The entire cast is an ensemble of colorful character actors from top to bottom, from Howard Da Silva's thuggish foreman to Betty Brewer's street-smart teenager, all of which lends to the film's almost effortless sense of entertainment. Curtis Bernhardt keeps everything moving along briskly, and he makes great use of the location shooting. The gloomy expressionism that would foreground his later film noirs and noirish melodramas are absent (a noir this is not), but it pops up occasionally, such as the rowdy moments of violence, or the lovely scene where Reagan takes Sheridan home. The politics, while eyebrow-raising given the star, are actually carefully trod: Reagan may be a labor organizer, but he never organizes a union. In fact, I guess a hardcore Reaganite could try to justify to film in terms of the free market: Talbot and Garcos are entrepreneurs who strike out on their own, and with hard-work and ingenuity make a success of themselves, which then trickles down to the non-union farmers in the form of higher, competitive wages. I kid, but not really.\n\nAs to the question of the later A.I. Bezzerides film, I hardly think it negates Jules Dassin's Thieves Highway (the coda does a good job of that on its own). I also don't know that it's a case of \"smarter\" progressive politics so much as the application of said politics. Thieves Highway almost exists as a dark, distorted mirror version of Juke Girl. In the Bernhardt, Reagan is able to direct his dissatisfaction into political action and labor organization; the Dassin is what happens when the avenue for social change is no longer available, the unrest manifesting itself into bursts of petty anger and personal vendetta. The former film still reflects the optimism of FDR's America, still holding despite the dark clouds drifting in from across the oceans. In the latter, post-war disillusionment and cynicism has firmly entrenched itself into the American psyche... and the progressive movement. One can almost see a clear (d)evolution between the two films with the interveaning years. Reagan's charismatic man-of-the-people goes to war and comes back Richard Conte's bitter loner. Ann Sheridan's has continued down her path until she's dropped right out of the juke joints and onto Valentina Cortese's street corner. Garcos has continued to be beat down by life until he lies crippled in his home. Gene Lockhart has only grown less polite and more brutal in his method as turns into Lee J. Cobb (or perhaps more appropriately, Howard Da Silva has managed to worm his way into control of the business). It's a more destructive and pessimistic response, but I never thought the Dassin film is condoning Conte. Sure, it's sympathetic as hell to him, but the movie is a warning about what happens when we allow the exploitative system to go on, but then close and forbid all avenues of progressive action.\n\nIn fact, the pessimism of the later film is always bubbling under the optimistic surface of this film. The warehouse fight between industrialist and worker is a grim evocation of the persistence of class tensions even after successful reform. I'm of two minds about the last minute transformation into a murder-mystery, leaning, as it does, far too heavily on the Walsh film. Yet, for such a populist film, it's surprising that it ends with the masses mobilizing not into a union but a terrifying mob. This is the strength of the proletariat at it's most irrational and destructive. The image of them stomping through the streets of Cat-Tail is a labor march turned black. That the film cuts away at the end is also a bit unsettling.\n\nSpoilerShow\n\nThat it is implied, but never resolved, that the mob lynches Madden is surprising given the code. Even as punishment for a murderer (and profiteer), it is reactionary and ugly.\n\nIt's a sour note that rubs up abrasively against the optimism that closes the picture, perhaps unconsciously hinting at the darker mood brewing.\n\nRe: 1940s List Discussion and Suggestions\n\nQuote\n\n#420 Post by YnEoS » Mon Jan 09, 2012 1:28 pm\n\nDebating weather or not I should create a list for this or not. Didn't get a chance to participate much in this project's discussion but I could easily come up with a top 50, and between now and the deadline I could probably fill a few of the big titles I haven't seen yet, and catch up on everyone's spotlight titles.\n\nWeather I participate or not though, I would like to strongly recommend everyone give this film a try if you haven't seen it.\n\nThe Portrait of Jennie (William Dieterle, 1948) - This is definitely not a film for everyone, and it will probably rub a lot of people the wrong way. But I find the atmosphere of this film utterly captivating in a way I haven't seen in any other film before. A gothic romance that deals very heavy handedly with emotion is in many way self-aggrandizing. So when the film opens with not just 1, but 2 quotes you'll either find it delightfully excessive as I do, or absolutely nauseating. But the jaw dropping cinematography and the haunting music all hits me very deeply and I can't help but be swept away by the whole thing. It's excesses and pure unrestrained emotion are part of it's charm."
