I finally saw it last night and thought it dull and rather stupid. I suppose the depiction of a rootless, amoral, and violent youth culture, at least partly imported from the US, had some novelty when it came out, and the quick looks at hip Parisian life had some style, but this is a badly dated, indifferently acted, and very disappointing film. 5/10.\n\nPost by Doghouse6 on\n\nTest Pilot (1938) - first full viewing\n\n3 Oscar nominations--including Best Picture--no Oscar.\n\nI prefer seeing Myrna Loy without William Powell..........great personality but no Oscar nominations.\n\nAbsolutely love Test Pilot. Director Fleming and the entire cast are at the top of their games, from the largest roles to the smallest (Gloria Holden especially stands out in the role of Mrs. Benson), and Loy's onscreen chemistry with both Gable and Tracy matches that she had with Powell.\n\nIt's got everything from intimate human drama to action spectacle, deftly traverses mood and tone shifting from light banter to gut-wrenching tragedy, and does so with brisk and energetic spontaneity that is as fresh today as it must have been 80 years ago (80 years! Aaack! I think it was only 20 years old when I first saw it).\n\nDid I happen to mention I love this movie?\n\nPost by kijii on\n\nLittle Men (1998) / Rodney Gibbons\n\nI was surprised how many times this has been remade. However, I totally enjoyed watching this version with Mariel Hemingway playing Jo (March) Bhaer and Chris Sarandon playing her husband, Fritz Bhaer, as they run a school for sponsored boys. Of course, this story is a continuation of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. Another grown-up member of the March family that appears in this story is Jo's sister, Meg--now Meg Brooke.\n\nThere are just so many things to search and find while streaming.\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nCrime and Punishment 1935, directed by Josef von Sternberg, starring Peter Lorre, Edward Arnold, Mrs Patrick Campbell and others.\n\nEdward Arnold has a field day as he plays a cat and mouse game with Raskolnikov, and at least in this adaptation, has the best and more interesting part, while Lorre seams stuck in old German style acting. Done on an obvious sparse budget, director von Sternberg manages with camera angles and shadows and lightning make it look a bit richer."
