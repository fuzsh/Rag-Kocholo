She was commonly known, particularly in her later years, by the honorific La Doña.\n\t\n\tMaría Félix was discovered by businessman Fernando Palacios in Mexico City. Palacios presented with the filmmaker Miguel Zacarías, who would give him the opportunity of starring El Peñon de las Animas alongside Jorge Negrete. In 1943 she starred Doña Bárbara, directed by Fernando de Fuentes and inspired in the novel of the Venezuelan writer Romulo Gallegos). De Fuentes increased her popularity with such films as La Mujer sin Alma (1944) and La Devoradora (1946); the latter making the actress the vamp of Mexican cinema in the 1940s. She refused to work in Hollywood unless she made her grand entrance from the \"big door\" and not the small roles offered by Cecil B. de Mille. Félix stated \"I was not born to carry a basket\".\n\t\n\tShe reportedly lost the lead role of \"Pearl Chavez\" in the 1945 film Duel in the Sun, although it was written with her in mind, to Jennifer Jones, reportedly due to work commitments in Europe. As a result, she never achieved the fame in the USA that she achieved in Latin America and Europe. In 1946, she came under the influence of director Emilio Fernandez, with whom she made the films Enamorada (1946), Río Escondido (1947) and Maclovia (1948), launched her career throughout Europe.\n\tShe worked in Spain in Mare Nostrum in 1948 and Sonatas directed by Juan Antonio Bardem. In France, with greats such as Jean Renoir (French Cancan,1954) and Luis Buñuel (La fièvre monte à El Pao, 1960), and played in Italian films like Mesalina (1951),alternating with stars like Rossano Brazzi, Vittorio Gassman, Jean Gabin, Françoise Arnoul, Yves Montand, Jack Palance, Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal and others. In 1959, starred the movie La Cucaracha, with Dolores del Río. In 1966, She also co-starred with Eulalio Gonzalez (El Piporro) in La Valentina. In later years, her films were inspired by the Mexican Revolution as La Escondida (1955), La Cucaracha (1959), Juana Gallo (1961), La Valentina (1966), and La Generala (1970), her last film.
