        "text": "The prospect had Mexican Movie Actress Maria Felix biting her nails. She was afraid that in her new picture, Rio Escondido, a bit-player would steal the show. The bit-player: President Miguel Alemán, playing himself when he presents Maria Felix as a schoolma’am an award for her fight against illiteracy. For Alemán, who knew Hollywood well in pre-presidential days and who is now anxious to give Mexican movies a hand up, it would be a screen debut. Said famed Director “El Indio” Fernandez last week, readying camera, lights and greasepaint: “I’m sure the President won’t need any coaching, but if he does, you can bet that I’ll give it to him.”"
