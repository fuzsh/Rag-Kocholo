        "text": "Born: 1977. Living in: Columbia\n\nShakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, known as Shakira, is a Colombian singer, songwriter, dancer, and record producer. Born and raised in Barranquilla, she began performing in school, demonstrating Latin American, Arabic, and rock and roll influences and belly dancing abilities. Shakira's first studio albums, Magia and Peligro, failed to attain commercial success in the 1990s; however, she rose to prominence in Latin America with her major-label debut, Pies Descalzos (1996), and her fourth album, Donde Estan los Ladrones?\n\nShakira has received numerous awards and recognition for her work. According to Sony, Shakira is the highest-selling Colombian artist of all time, having sold between 50 and 60 million records.\n\nAccording to Yahoo!, her single \"Hips Don't Lie\" is the best-selling single of the last decade (2000's). Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems said that \"Hips Don't Lie\" was the most-played pop song in a single week in American radio history. It was played 9,637 times in one week. Shakira became the first artist in the history of the Billboard charts to earn the coveted number one spots on both the Top 40 Mainstream and Latin Chart in the same week doing so with \"Hips Don't Lie\". Additionally, she is the only artist from South America to reach the number-one spot on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the Australian ARIA chart, and the UK Singles Chart.\n\nShakira Videos\n\nTry Everything\n\nFrom the Disney animated film Zootopia, this upbeat single reminds us to Don't give up!
