        "text": "Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, or more simply known as Shakira (born 2 February 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia), is a Colombian singer and songwriter. Her famous songs include Hips Don't Lie (2006) and Whenever, Wherever (2001).\n\nNoted to be a \"global phenom\" whose impact has \"reached every corner of the world\", Shakira has been described as an \"artistic link between the west and the east\" for popularizing Middle Eastern sounds in the West, and western sounds in the East (mainly the Middle East).[2] Due to her heritage as a Colombian of Lebanese descent, she is perceived as particularly influential for Latino and Middle-Eastern musicians,[3] and has been noted for introducing musical genres, instruments, and techniques from across Latin America, the Middle East, and other regions to a wider audience.[4] Shakira is also credited with popularising music in the Spanish language on a global level.[5]\n\nIn 1991, Shakira's first album Magia was released. Her second album Pies Descalzos was released in 1993. Her first hit in Colombia was her third record, “¿Dónde Estás Corazón?\" from 1995.[6] In 2001, she released her first English album Laundry Service. The album's first single \"Whenever, Wherever\" was the best selling single of 2001. In 2005, she released her second English album Oral Fixation, Vol.2. In 2009, She Wolf was released. The first single \"She Wolf\" reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. On 14 January 2014, Shakira released a single with Rihanna, \"Can't Remember to Forget You\".[7]\n\nShakira's first language is Spanish. She also speaks Portuguese and English. In addition she can speak some Italian, French, Catalan, Arabic, and Japanese. Accordingly, she records songs in both English and Spanish, as well as having covered Francis Cabrel's song Je l'aime à mourir in French and Fairuz's Aatini Al Nay in Arabic as an homage to her home country of Lebanon.\n\nShe has two sons, Milan (born 2013) and Sasha (born 2015) with her former boyfriend, Gerard Piqué.[8] In July 2018, Shakira came back to Lebanon with her family. She visited her grandmother's village of Tannourine where she was granted a square in her name. A statue of the pop-star is set to be built soon in the mentioned village. She also visited her father's hometown, Zahle."
