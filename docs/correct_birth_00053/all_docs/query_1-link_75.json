        "text": "Although the last few days in Barcelona were not the best for Shakira, after receiving the eviction letter signed by her former father-in-law, Joan Pique, to leave the residence where she was living in Barcelona.\n\nHowever, now that she has made peace with her separation from the former Barcelona defender, the future for the Colombian looks very bright.\n\nIt seems that the musician could be invited to the Met Gala this year, which would be her first time at the event.\n\nIn addition, she will move into her residence in an exclusive neighborhood in Miami with her children and family.\n\nAs for Milan and Sasha, the children will attend the exclusive Miami Country Day, considered one of the 20 best schools in the state of Florida and with students from 40 different countries, with an annual cost of between 32,000 and 47,000 dollars, according to Mujer Hoy.\n\nThe family home will be a mansion\n\nShakira and her children's Miami home is located on North Bay Road Drive in South Beach, an island where Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin also live.\n\nThe mansion, which has several buildings, a swimming pool, private jetty and views of the bay, was recently adapted to add walls of vegetation to prevent the paparazzi from obtaining images of the interior.\n\nShakira will be very sheltered in Miami\n\nThe singer will be able to enjoy a much larger network of family and friends in Miami than in Barcelona, where she was only close to Gerard Pique's family.\n\nWhile in the American city she will have her brother Tonino, her manager and right-hand man, close to her. As well as her sister Lucy Mebarak. Undoubtedly Shakira and her children will have the affection and closeness of her siblings and cousins.\n\nShakira is also close to Gloria and Emilio Estefan, two of the city's historical figures. She will also be able to count on Juan Luis Guerra, Chris Martin and Gustavo Cerati.\n\nIn addition, it is expected that she will continue to move forward musically, creating new hits to complete the long-awaited new album that will take her on a world tour."
