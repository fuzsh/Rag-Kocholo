        "text": "Shakira, the Colombian singer, has bid farewell to Barcelona and set off for Miami to start a new chapter of her life. However, upon arriving at her 10-million-dollar mansion, which had been in her name since the early 2000s, she found that it was infested with termites, forcing her to seek alternative accommodation. Shakira has since been seen walking the streets of Miami with her brother and a real estate agent, on the hunt for a new home that meets her specific requirements.\n\nShakira on the house hunt in Miami\n\nAccording to the British tabloid The Sun, Shakira is willing to spend up to $50 million to find the perfect mansion for her family. The property must have enough space to accommodate a recording studio, as well as areas for her children, Milan and Sasha, and her parents, Nidia Ripoll and William Mebarak. The artist is also looking for a large space to cater to her father’s medical needs.\n\nThe Sun has published images of Shakira visiting up to six houses with her brother and a real estate agent, indicating that the singer is serious about finding the right property. In the meantime, she has reportedly rented a beachfront property for $15 million. Shakira’s move to Miami comes after a difficult period marked by her separation from Gerard Piqué, but the singer is now looking forward to a fresh start in her new home.\n\nShakira’s Miami car transportation costs\n\nAccording to the British newspaper, Shakira will be paying a staggering around $15 million to transport her collection of ten cars to Miami. The collection includes a Mercedes S-Class worth $116,000, a Mercedes SL550 worth over $100,000, an Audi A7, a Mercedes Slk250, a Tesla, a BMW X6, an Audi Q7, a Jeep Wrangler, a Mini Cooper, and a Seat León. She does not own a Renault Twingo!\n\nShakira’s ten-car fleet is an impressive collection, and the singer is reportedly willing to pay a significant amount to ensure that her vehicles are transported safely to her new home in Miami. This news comes after Shakira was seen house-hunting in Miami with her brother and a real estate agent, as she looks to start a new chapter of her life in Florida. Despite the significant expenses, it seems that Shakira is determined to make her move to Miami a success and create a comfortable home for her family."
