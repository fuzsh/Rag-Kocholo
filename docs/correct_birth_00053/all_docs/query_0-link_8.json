        "text": "In a gesture of hometown homage, the Colombian coastal city of Barranquilla proudly unveiled a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot) statue on Tuesday, honoring the internationally acclaimed singer and songwriter Shakira. The towering bronze and aluminum sculpture captures the essence of the Colombian superstar, depicting her in a bikini top, bare midriff, and a flowing skirt, frozen in one of her iconic dance poses with hands clasped over her head and a hip gracefully jutting out.\n\nAt the base of the statue, an inscription reads, “Hips that do not lie, a unique talent, a voice that moves masses.” The ceremony, held on the banks of the Magdalena River, saw the attendance of Shakira’s parents, William Mebarak and Nidia Ripoll, adding a familial touch to the occasion.\n\nShakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, Colombia’s chart stopping music icon and a philanthropist who through her charity works to educate vulnerable children, has left an indelible mark on the music industry. With a remarkable career, the 46-year-old singer has sold 80 million albums worldwide and boasts three Grammy awards to her name. The unveiling of the statue marked a moment of celebration for Barranquilla, acknowledging Shakira’s profound impact on the global music scene.\n\nThe resilience of the singer/songwriter despite a bitter divorce and a legal battle with Spanish authorities involving taxes, shines through in the success of her latest hit song with Argentine DJ Bizarrap, garnering over 670 million views on YouTube, and clinching the 2023 Song of the Year at the Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nAcknowledging the artistic talent within her homeland, Shakira expressed gratitude to sculptor Yino Marquez and his art student collaborators during the unveiling ceremony. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she shared, “It makes me happy to share this with my parents,” emphasizing the significance of family in her journey.\n\nThe unveiling of the statue comes on the heels of Spotify’s recognition of Shakira’s influence. The “Inevitable” singer, holding the title of the No. 1 most streamed female Latin artist in Spotify’s history, was honored with her own day on September 29, aptly named Shakira Day. The social media-driven #ShakiraDeservesADay campaign, initiated by her devoted Colombian fanbase, played a pivotal role in making the celebration a reality, underscoring the enduring impact of Shakira’s artistry on a global scale."
