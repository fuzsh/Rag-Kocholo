        "text": "Shakira’s parents are Nidia Ripoll and William Mebarack. Her dad was born in New York City and is Lebanese. She is the only child they had, but she has nine eight-siblings on her father’s side.\n\nThere are very few photos of Shakira with her whole family, and it seems like most of her siblings prefer to stay out of the public eye. Her siblings’ names are Robin, Moises, Tonino, Alberto, Jose, Lucy, Ana, and Edward.\n\nThere is little known about her siblings Robin, Ana, Edward, and Moises. Her brother Alberto is a lawyer and Patricia works as a teacher for students with special needs in Spain.\n\nOne of Shakira’s oldest brothers passed away in a motorcycle accident when she was 2. He was the inspiration for her song, Tus Gafas Oscuras, which she composed when she was nine years old. “One day, Shakira said to me: ‘Papa, I want you to hear this song, the name is Your Dark Glasses.’ From the moment I lost my eldest son, I hid the pain behind a pair of glasses, and she formed a connection between that and the glasses I used,” her father said..\n\nToni has been part of her team for years and worked as the road manager for the Dorado World Tour. They seem to have a great relationship and are pictured the most together."
