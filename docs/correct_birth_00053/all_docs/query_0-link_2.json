        "text": "27 December 2023\n\nBy Vanessa Buschschlüter , BBC News\n\nA bronze statue of Colombian singer Shakira has been unveiled in her hometown of Barranquilla.\n\nThe 6.5m-tall (21.3ft) bronze shows her swivelling her hips in the dance move which featured heavily in her popular Hips Don't Lie video.\n\nThe artist shared photos of her parents in front of the statue on her Instagram account.\n\nShakira was among the names most searched on Google, according to figures released by the company.\n\nBefore the unveiling of the new statue, Shakira hit the news several times this year - most notably when she released a song about her former partner, ex-footballer Gerard Piqué, which broke YouTube records in Latin America.\n\nAnd again when she settled a tax fraud case brought against her in Spain by paying a €7.5m (£6.5m) fine.\n\nThe unveiling of the statue on Tuesday was attended by Shakira's parents, William Mebarak and Nidia Ripoll, as well as by the mayor of Barranquilla.\n\nA plaque at the foot of the statue praises the artist for her \"hips that do not lie, a unique talent, a voice that moves masses\".\n\nIt also refers to her charity work through a foundation she created called \"Pies descalzos\", Spanish for \"bare feet\", which promotes early childhood development.\n\nShakira thanked the sculptor, Yino Márquez, and his students for the \"enormous artistic talent\" they had demonstrated by creating the bronze."
