        "text": "Shakira has come a long way from her modest childhood in Colombia. With homes in the Bahamas and Uruguay, the star has built up an impressive portfolio over the years including the Barcelona home at the centre of tax fraud allegations and her post-break-up bolthole in Miami.\n\nClick or scroll on to retrace Shakira's road to fame and step inside some of the amazing homes she has picked up along the way…\n\nFollowing her split from former professional footballer Gerard Piqué in 2022 and their subsequent custody agreement, Shakira moved from Spain back to Miami with the couple’s two sons, Milan and Sasha, to be close to the rest of her wider family and to concentrate on her career.\n\nAccording to British tabloid newspaper The Sun, she began househunting in 2023 while living in the luxury Miami Beach mansion she bought early in her career. In June 2024, Shakira returned to her native Colombia after her father was taken to hospital with respiratory complications and was spotted out with her children visiting restaurants and shopping.\n\nThe global icon, who is often considered the most successful Latin star of all time, with a staggering 95 million records sold over her three-decade career, and an estimated net worth of $300 million (£236m), has properties at her disposal around the world.\n\nBut she wasn't born into such privileged circumstances. Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born on 2 February 1977, in the small town of Barranquilla, Colombia (pictured). She was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools growing up, speaking often about her faith throughout her career.\n\nWith a Lebanese father, William Mebarak Chadid, and a Columbian mother, Nidia Ripoll, the star has nine half-siblings from her dad's previous marriage.\n\nWhen she was just seven years old, Shakira's father's jewellery business went bankrupt and the family was plunged into poverty. In an essay she penned for Newsweek magazine, Shakira looked back on that difficult time:\n\n\"We had gone from being middle class to poor almost overnight, and from my 7-year-old child's perspective it was hard to imagine anything worse. I can still viscerally remember the seeming desperation of that moment.\"\n\nShakira took this early experience and used it for good. Since finding fame and fortune, she set up her successful charitable foundation in Colombia, Pies Descalzos, to help the nation's poorest children.\n\nAnd Shakira showed promise for fame from very early on. At the age of four, the budding star would entertain herself by writing poems and penned her first song at just eight years old. She began taking part in local talent competitions and took belly dancing classes.\n\nAfter signing her first record deal at 13, Shakira released her first album Magia in 1991 and her second, Peligro in 1993. When neither was successful, she decided to take a break from singing to act in the Latin soap opera El Oasis.\n\nShakira resumed her music career in 1995 and released two more albums, Pies descalzos and then ¿Dónde están los ladrones? in 1998. Both included hit singles, but the star still wanted to break into the American music industry.\n\nIn 2001 her fifth album Unplugged won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album, but it was her next record Laundry Service that really kick-started her international career. Her first English-language album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide.\n\nWith her career finally setting off, it was time for the songstress to invest in some serious real estate.\n\nIn 2000, a year before her hit single 'Whenever, Wherever' hit the charts, Shakira started dating Antonio de la Rúa, the son of the former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa.\n\nThe former couple often stayed at Shakira’s sprawling farm in a small fishing village in Uruguay.\n\nIt is not known when the singer snapped up the property or how much she paid but we do know that in 2008 she holed up there to begin work on a new album.\n\nSet on over 12 acres of land, the home boasts seven bedrooms, four in the main home and two in the guest house, plus one in a single third building, and there's also room for four staff.\n\nThe star described the farm as \"idyllic and very romantic\" in an interview with Hello!, perfect for her writing process. She said she hoped to be inspired by her favourite Uruguayan poet, Juana de Ibarbourou: \"I'm preparing my future album and I'm getting started on that, being alone with myself, after which some musician friends will come and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nInside, the main house has a cinema, a work office and a gym. It is also believed Shakira built an extensive recording studio within the grounds, so she could work on her music, while outside, there’s a heated pool surrounded by decking, a lake with boats, a sauna and a tennis court. Not a bad spot to work on your new album!\n\nAt the time, Shakira told a Uruguay newspaper that while she had no imminent plans to marry boyfriend Antonio, she dreamed of having kids and \"being by his side for years to come\".\n\nHowever, pictured here in December 2009, the couple eventually went their separate ways in August 2010. Having owned several properties together, there was a huge disagreement over who owned what.\n\nJust after the split, Antonio tried to sue the singer in a $100m (£79m) lawsuit for what he felt he was owed after acting as her business manager, despite there being no written agreement reported Billboard. The case was dismissed in 2013.\n\nAs soon as she hit the big time in 2001, Shakira started building her luxury property portfolio. In June of that year, she snapped up a Mediterranean-style estate located in the prestigious gated community on Florida's La Gorce Island for a reported $1.1 million (£869k)\n\nHome to big-name stars such as Cher, Matt Damon and Billy Joel, Shakira would have been a wonderful addition to the local celebrity roster of residents.\n\nUnfortunately, pictures of the interior, even the facade are scarce, as La Gorce Island is notoriously private due to the amount of celebrities who live there. Many of the homes are behind huge gates like this one.\n\nBut the privacy was perfect for the star, who would now be spending much more time stateside working on becoming the next huge crossover Latin artist.\n\nThe home is spread over 2,700 square feet, with a swimming pool surrounded by decking and lush foliage. But sitting on less than half an acre of land, Shakira was looking for more space.\n\nShe decided to sell up in 2005 for £1.4 million ($1.8m), making quite a profit. If she had held on to it as an investment however, she would have made even more, as it's currently estimated to be worth around $5.7 million (£4.5m) according to Realtor.\n\nBut that year Shakira was a rising star, performing with good friend Alejandro Sanz at the MTV awards where her song 'La tortua' was nominated for three awards and she had other homes under her belt...\n\nIn September 2001, not long after her first Miami purchase, Shakira snapped up another stunning home in the same area, but this time she upgraded and got a waterfront property.\n\nThe 8,708-square-foot (809sqm) home overlooks Miami’s waterfront skyline of the Julia Tuttle Causeway with more than 100 feet (30m) of water frontage, a private dock and ocean access. The prestigious home was bought by the singer for just shy of $3.4 million (£2.7m), according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.com.\n\nShakira made sure to renovate the mansion over the 12 years that she was based there and made several upgrades according to Variety.\n\nThese are said to have included new hardwood floors imported from Spain, a new front door, updated landscaping and brand-new indoor and outdoor lighting systems.\n\nThe double front doors open out into the roomy open-plan dining area, which boasts a wall lined with windows, a minimalist fireplace and lowered ceilings over the dining area.\n\nElsewhere there's a fitness room that looks out onto the driveway, an office with a built-in desk and an entertainment wing, which is decked out with state-of-the-art sound equipment and an all-white pool table.\n\nThe sleek kitchen boasts modern white cabinets and gleaming shiny steel appliances. The wide centre island is the perfect social space, while the floor-to-ceiling windows look out over the leafy patio.\n\nThe home boasts six bedrooms and eight bathrooms, which would be more than big enough for the singer and her two sons. But in 2013, Shakira decided to put it up for rent at a huge $45,000 (£35.4k) a month.\n\nShe then listed it for sale the same year for nearly $15 million (£11.8m), before dropping the price to $13 million (£10.2m) in 2015, say The Daily Mail. The home failed to sell and was relisted in 2018 at the lower price of $11.6 million (£9.1m).\n\nShakira must have known trouble was afoot in paradise, because she removed the house from the market in 2021, and planned to make it her primary home when she relocated to Miami in 2022 following her split from Gerard Piqué.\n\nIn 2011, when Shakira confirmed she was in a relationship with Gerard Piqué, rather than buying another mega-mansion, Shakira made a bold real estate move by purchasing a share in a private island in the Bahamas.\n\nThe singer pooled together with Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters and Spanish singer Alejandro Sanz to buy the Vladi Private Islands retreat for $15 million (£11.8m) according to CNBC, with plans to build luxury hotels, condos and golf courses, turning it into the ultimate artists' retreat.\n\nReportedly hoping to 'reinvent the concept of tourism' Shakira plans to be involved with building holiday homes which will have private beaches plus potentially selling prime seaside property on the island, according to The New Zealand Herald.\n\nWith five white sandy beaches and three salt ponds, the island is part of the Berry Islands in the Bahamas. This small patch of paradise is spread over 550 acres of tropical landscape with multiple waterfalls, three bays and several lagoons. Plenty of scope for those grand plans.\n\nAlso in 2011, Shakira posed with her parents William and Nidia, as she was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was the 2,454th star in the Category of Recording and solidified her impact on the music industry.\n\nIt was a busy year for the star, as she also went public with her new relationship. Shakira met her ex-partner, Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué, on the set of the music video for her single 'Waka Waka' in 2010 and the two were ready to share their love with the world.\n\nIn 2015, the couple splashed out $5.5 million (£4.3m) on a mansion in Barcelona. Spread over 1,500 square feet (139sqm), the home boasts seven bedrooms, two kitchens, a swimming pool with a waterfall, a gym and a whole host of other amenities.\n\nAnd the home has made an impressive profit. In the wake of their split, the couple agreed to sell the $15.2 million home according to The Sun.\n\nDescribed as one of the best properties in the city, the house is set over three floors and was renovated by the couple before they had their first child in January 2013.\n\nThe sprawling white mansion has a huge swimming pool, a garden, tennis court and well-equipped gym, as well as a games room and private cinema. With stunning sea views it's no wonder the home was where the couple spent a lot of their time.\n\nThe focal point is a large, bright and airy living room, which has featured in many of Shakira’s posts over the years, giving us an insight into the couple’s luxury contemporary style.\n\nThe house was at the centre of a tax evasion allegation in 2018 however, when the Spanish authorities accused the singer of failing to pay around €14.5 million ($15.5m/£12.3m) in taxes between 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Colombian pop star had listed her official residence as the Bahamas, but spent most of her time in Spain, according to a report by Forbes. Under Spanish law, anyone living in the country for more than six months a year must pay taxes.\n\nThe singer denied any wrongdoing but reached a settlement with the Spanish authorities in November 2022 to avoid a trial, whereby she paid €7.3 million ($7.8m/£6.1m), around half of the taxes owed say Reuters.\n\nIt didn’t end there however, and in July 2023 Spanish prosecutors opened a second case against the star, accusing her of using a network of companies, some of them based in tax havens, to cheat the tax office in 2018.\n\nThis case was finally dismissed in May 2024, reports Reuters. When a court said there was no evidence to prove a complaint raised by the prosecutor that Shakira “consciously and voluntarily omitted information and documentation” in preparing her personal income tax in 2018.\n\nIn happier days, when Shakira and Gerard Piqué were still a couple in late 2019, they invested in a new-build villa in one of their favourite holiday spots, the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nOverlooking the Sea of Akamas, the contemporary villa is within Cap St George Hotel & Resort’s premises (pictured) near Paphos, on the island of Aphrodite according to Hello!.\n\nShakira and her family had been frequent visitors to the island over the years and so it was no surprise when they decided to stump up the cash and buy their own piece of paradise here.\n\nAs well as a quiet retreat, the new holiday home allowed them to enjoy 6,500 square feet (604sqm) of beachfront, a spa and fine dining options in the swanky restaurants and bars nearby.\n\nThe Cap St Georges resort comprises 150 villas, a clubhouse with luxury facilities and services including 24-hour reception and concierge services, security, a spa, gym, bar, restaurant and sporting facilities such as tennis and basketball courts, cycling, horse riding, a serviced beach and a kids' playground.\n\nThe former couple's eight-bathroom, six-bedroom villa is said to have stunning views of the waterfront, making it an idyllic holiday retreat. With a home cinema, private gym, jacuzzi, private pool and wine cellar, it's the perfect place to take a break.\n\nThe contemporary spread also features gardens overlooking the sea, with the pool providing stunning sunset views come evening.\n\nIt is not known which, if either, of the former couple have held on to the villa following their separation, although judged by the acrimony surrounding the split, it seems unlikely that Shakira would be keen to revisit places she shared with her former partner in happier times.\n\nBut happier times were on the horizon for Shakira, as she performed at the 2020 Super Bowl Half Time Show with Jennifer Lopez. Performing to the crowds at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens.\n\nIn an interview with Cosmopolitan, Shakira said: “I really thought it was a great opportunity to make a strong statement about what an important part of the American fabric the Latino community is. There was a lot of work behind it, a lot of stress,” Shakira admitted, adding, “But it was one of the highlights of my career.”\n\nMeanwhile, plans to sell the Barcelona home where they brought up their sons for a reported $15 million (£12m), were put on hold.\n\nAs reported by The Sun back in January 2023, the singer decided to delay her move to Miami for five months due to her father’s ill health and his inability to fly. Shakira’s dad suffered a nasty fall in 2022 and she had been supporting him with his recovery as seen here.\n\nThe ‘She Wolf’ singer finally bid farewell to Barcelona in April 2023, when she posted this view of the city, telling her fans: \"Today we start a new chapter in the pursuit of (my children’s) happiness. Thanks to everyone who surfed alongside my many waves there in Barcelona, the city where I learned that friendship is certainly longer than love.\"\n\nAccording to The International Business Times, the pop star finally decided to go after she was served with an eviction notice by Joan Piqué, Gerard’s father. Apparently, the house had ended up in his hands as part of the settlement that was agreed upon after the separation.\n\nAs well as being an emotional upheaval, her move back to Florida proved an expensive undertaking.\n\nThe pop icon not only had to uproot her life and move all her possessions to her home in Miami, but The Sun reports she had to pay a staggering $15 million (£12m) to ship her supercar collection.\n\nThe collection is said to include a Mercedes S-Class worth around $125,000 (£98k) and a Mercedes SL550, worth an estimated $115,000 (£90k), as well as an Audi A7 Sportback, a Mercedes SLK250, a Tesla Model S, a BMW X6, an Audi Q7, a Jeep Wrangler and a Mini Cooper.\n\nThe good news is that it seems to have been worth the effort, and the money. After two turbulent years, during which the Grammy winner even had to deal with a stalker, who claimed Shakira was his wife, she released her first album in seven years, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran (Women Don’t Cry Anymore), in March 2024.\n\nShe also seems to be enjoying life back in her old home to judge by this joyful post showing her and her two sons making music there. She describes them as “the two suns of my life, thank you for lighting (my life) up and completing me.”\n\nLove this? Follow us on Facebook for more celebrity home tours"
