        "text": "Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, simply known as Shakira, is a Colombian singer, songwriter, dancer, record producer, choreographer, model, philanthropist, and occasional actress. For Disney, she is mostly known for lending her voice for the character Gazelle in Zootopia. Also, her pop single, \"Try Everything\" is featured in the film. She also played herself in the Ugly Betty episode \"The Bahamas Triangle\" and the Wizards of Waverly Place episode \"Dude Looks Like Shakira\".\n\nShakira was born in Barranquilla, Colombia where she spent most of her childhood. During the 1990s, she grew into prominence on the Latin music scene with songs, like \"¿Dónde Estás Corazón?\", \"Un Poco de Amor\", and \"Antología\". She eventually crossed over into mainstream U.S. Pop music and continued her success with a number of hits singles including \"Whenever, Wherever\", \"La Tortura\", \"Hips Don't Lie\", \"Beautiful Liar\", \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", \"Loca\", \"Can't Remember to Forget You\", \"Chantaje\", \"Te Felicito\", \"Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\", and \"TQG\".\n\nShe has also branched out into other ventures in the entertainment industry, such as acting the telenovela El oasis and mentoring singers on NBC's The Voice.\n\nRoles[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nShakira, being Colombian-born, also provided the Spanish voice for Gazelle for both Spanish versions (Latin America and Spain) of Zootopia.\n\nBut in Zootopia+, Shakira doesn't reprise her role in the Latin Spanish dub, instead being replaced by Annie Rojas.\n\nHer song \"La Tortura\" was used in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode \"Face My Enemy\".\n\nIn the Latin Spanish dub of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Shakira is on Captain America's list of things to which he wants to catch up.\n\n[]"
