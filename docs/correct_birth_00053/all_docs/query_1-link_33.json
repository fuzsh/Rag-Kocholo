        "text": "Call it the battle of Shakira and Gerard Piqué. The cheating allegations, the viral songs, the cryptic Instagram posts — the Colombian pop star and the retired FC Barcelona player have been making headlines for months as their messy separation plays out in public.\n\nThe couple famously met back in 2010 on the set of “Waka Waka,” the song Shakira wrote for the FIFA World Cup that year (Piqué appears in the video.) The two made their relationship official some time later. They had their first son Milan in January 2013 and their second son Sasha in 2014.\n\nBut in June 2022, Shakira and Piqué announced their separation after 11 years together. Since then, it’s been a whirlwind of headlines, interviews, and chart-topping songs as the couple deals with the aftermath of their public breakup. Here’s a timeline of everything that’s happened since Piqué and Shakira went their own ways:\n\nJune 2022: Shakira and Piqué announce their separation\n\nOn June 4, 2022, days after Spain’s El Periodico reported that Piqué wasn’t living with Shakira and their children, the couple announced that their 11-year relationship had come to an end.\n\n“We regret to confirm that we are separating,” the couple said in a joint statement. “We ask for privacy at this moment for the well-being of our children, who are our maximum priority. Thank you in advance for your understanding and respect.”\n\nEl Periodico claimed that they had made the decision to separate after Piqué was allegedly caught cheating.\n\nSeptember 2022: Shakira calls the post-breakup period her “darkest hour”\n\nSeveral months after the couple confirmed their split, Shakira appeared on the cover of Elle magazine and opened up about the breakup following what she called a “total circus” of tabloid gossip.\n\n“I’ve remained quiet and just tried to process it all. It’s hard to talk about it, especially because I’m still going through it, and because I’m in the public eye and because our separation is not like a regular separation,” she told the magazine in September 2022. “And so it’s been tough not only for me, but also for my kids. Incredibly difficult. I have paparazzi camping outside, in front of my house, 24/7. And there’s not a place where I can hide from them with my kids, except for my own house.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nShe added, “I’ve tried to conceal the situation in front of my kids. I try to do it and protect them, because that’s my number one mission in life. But then they hear things in school from their friends or they come across some disagreeable, unpleasant news online, and it just affects them, you know?”\n\nShe shared that her father had been ill at the same time, and described the period as “one of the most difficult, darkest hours of my life.”\n\nOctober 2022: Shakira releases “Monotonía” with Ozuna\n\nShakira alluded to the end of her relationship with Piqué in the lyrics and video for “Monotonía.” In the song, Shakira laments a romance that just became too routine: “No fue culpa tuya/Ni tampoco mía/Fue culpa de la monotonía,” she sings on the track. (“It wasn’t your fault nor mine/It was monotony’s fault.)\n\nThe video follows Shakira as she walks around town looking for her missing (literal) heart, even as people trample over it in the street, indicating major heartbreak.\n\nNovember 2022: Shakira and Piqué reach a custody agreement\n\nIn November 2022, the couple told People that they had reached a custody agreement for their sons Milan and Sasha.\n\nRelated\n\n“Our sole objective is to provide our children with the utmost security and protection and hope that they can continue with their lives in a safe and calm environment,” the former couple told the magazine. “We appreciate that their privacy will be respected.”\n\nJanuary 2023: Shakira releases chart-breaking, Piqué-slamming Bizarrap single\n\nShakira broke records, topped charts, and took direct aim at Piqué when she released her “BZRP Music Session #53” with Argentine producer Bizarrap in January 2023.\n\n“Una loba como yo no esta pa’ tipos como tu (A wolf like me isn’t for guys like you),” she declared on the song, referencing her 2009 mega-hit “She Wolf.”\n\n“I won’t get back with you, not if you cry, not even if you beg me,” she sang in one of the most biting lines. “It’s clear that it’s not my fault if they criticize you. I just make music, sorry if it splashes you.” She pauses at the end, emphasizing “pique” in the Spanish word “salpique” — a clear nod at her ex.\n\nShe also made reference to Clara Chia Marti, the woman Piqué’s allegedly cheated with, emphasizing “clara” in the word “claramente.”\n\n“I wish you luck with my supposed replacement/I don’t even know what happened to you,” she sings on the track, later adding, “Lots of time at the gym, but your brain needs a little work too.”\n\nJanuary 2023: Piqué responds to the BZRP session\n\nPiqué referred to the song during a stream of his Kings League-focused podcast, showing off a Casio watch on his wrist, in reference to Shakira’s lyrics.\n\n“Casio has sent us watches,” he said in Spanish. “We reached a sponsorship agreement with Casio. The Kings League struck a deal with Casio… I’m serious!”\n\nBy April, the song had more than 420 million plays on YouTube, and nearly 500 million streams on Spotify. (The song also broke 14 Guinness World Records.)\n\nJanuary 2023: Piqué and Clara Chia Marti make things official\n\nNot just rumors, these two are official. Two weeks after the release of her scathing “BZRP Music Session #53,” Piqué and Clara Chia Marti confirmed they were together after Piqué shared a selfie with her.\n\nHe’s since been mostly absent from Instagram, aside from posting about his Kings League venture.\n\nFebruary 2023: Shakira sings about Piqué’s new relationship on Karol G collab\n\nThe following month, Shakira and Karol G released their highly anticipated collaboration “TQG,” with each of them alluding to their past high-profile relationships. Shakira mentions someone who strayed away from her, singing, “Seeing you with the new one hurt me/But I’m already set by myself.”\n\n“Listening to that story and where she was at, the song ‘TQG’ made a lot of sense,” Karol told Rolling Stone. “I sent it to her and she loved it.”\n\nMarch 2023: Piqué officially breaks his silence: ‘I keep doing what I want’\n\nIn March, Piqué officially broke his silence, sitting down for a full interview with Spain’s El Pais. In the interview, the soccer player said he had no interest in “cleaning up” his image and explained that he would continue doing what he pleased.\n\n“I keep doing what I want,” he said. “The day I die, I will look back and hope I have always done what I wanted. I want to be faithful to myself.”\n\nHe added, “There have been changes in my life and I have known how to preserve happiness.” (He emphasized being “very happy” with his life now.)\n\nPiqué also said he wanted to do what was best for his kids. “It’s about protecting them,” he said. “That’s the job of all parents with their kids. That’s what I’m focused on and that’s my role as a father.”\n\nMarch 2023: Shakira posts cryptic selfie that some think references Piqué’s girlfriend\n\nShakira posted a selfie with a cryptic caption that read simply “chiaroscuro.” Fans quickly began wondering if it was an indirect reference to Clara Chia Marti, noting that the word means “light-dark” — or “claro-oscuro.”\n\nApril 2, 2023: Shakira confirms she’s moving out of Barcelona to find “happiness” elsewhere\n\nMonths after a source told People she would move to Miami to be closer to her family, Shakira confirmed that she was leaving Barcelona, where she had moved earlier in her life to give her children “stability.”\n\n“We’re now looking for that [stability] in another corner of the world alongside family, friends, and the ocean,” she wrote in a Twitter statement on April 2. “Today we begin a new chapter in the search for happiness.”\n\nShakira thanked those who “surfed waves” with her in Barcelona, the city where she says she learned that “friendship lasts longer than love.”\n\n“Thanks to everyone there who cheered me up, dried my tears, inspired me, and made me grow,” she said. “Thanks to my Spanish fans who have covered me with their love and loyalty.”\n\nApril 2, 2023: Piqué calls Shakira’s fans “people who don’t have a life” — and she claps back\n\nDuring an interview with Gerard Romero’s Jijantes podcast in early April, Piqué seemingly threw shade at Shakira and her fans, expressing that he didn’t care what people thought of him, and emphasizing that his ex-girlfriend is from Latin America. (Some fans believed Piqué’s mention of Shakira’s birthplace was racist and out of place.)\n\n“My ex-wife is Latin American. You have no idea what I received on social media, but I don’t care. Zero. I don’t know them,” he said on the podcast, opening up about the backlash he’s faced following the split. “They’re people without lives and I’m never going to meet them. They’re like robots.”\n\n“If you care too much about comments, you’re dead,” he added. “You’re dead.”\n\nShakira clapped back with a simple message on Twitter: “I’m proud of being Latin American.” She also shared emojis of the Latin American flags.\n\nApril 10, 2023: Shakira asks paparazzi to “respect” her children’s privacy\n\nAfter arriving in Miami, her new home base, Shakira asked the media to respect the privacy of her children with Piqué, Milan and Sasha.\n\n“In this period of change in my life as a public figure, it’s understandable that there is a permanent curiosity around me and my family,” Shakira wrote. “However, my children, Milan and Sasha, have endured a very difficult year, suffering incessant harassment and persecution without relief by the paparazzi and several media outlets in Barcelona.”\n\nShakira “implored” that the media respect her children and not follow the two children as they attend school, leave their home, or attend their extracurricular activities.\n\n“I extend this petition not as an artist, but as a mother who wishes to protect and care for the psychological and emotional well-being of my children so they may live a happy and healthy life, as all children deserve to do,” she added.\n\nMay 7, 2023: Shakira Champions Single Mothers in Billboard Latin Women in Music ‘Woman of the Year’ Speech\n\nWhile accepting the Woman of the Year award at the first-ever Billboard Latin Women in Music event, Shakira reflected on the emotional journey she experienced over the past year.\n\n“This has been a year of seismic change in my life where I’ve felt more than ever and very personally what it is to be a women. And what it means,” Shakira shared in her acceptance speech. “It’s been a year where I’ve realized we women are stronger than we think, braver than we believed, more independent than we were taught to be. Because what woman hasn’t at some time in her life forgotten herself because she’s seeking the attention and love of someone else? It happened to me, more than once.”\n\nShe added: “But there comes a time in the life of every woman where she no longer depends on someone else to love and accept herself just as she is,” Shakira said. “A time when the search for someone else is replaced by the search for oneself. A time when the desire to be perfect is replaced by the desire to be authentic, and where finding someone who is faithful is less important than being faithful to ourselves.”\n\nShakira also used the moment to champion “all those single moms who defend and protect their children like lionesses,” as she has since her split from Piqué.\n\n“It’s true that when I felt most lost, music put me in the road back to myself. But the most important lessons I learned from other women, and for them I wrote what I wrote and I sang what I sang,” she added. “Because only a woman can love until she’s ripped apart; can speak with the most brutal honesty; can sing with anger; dance in ecstasy and be brought to tears with emotion. Only a woman can do that.”\n\nJune 2023: Shakira Reveals Piqué ‘Betrayed’ Her While Her Father Was in the Intensive Care Unit\n\nIn a cover story with People en Español, Shakira revealed that her split from Piqué couldn’t have arrived at a worse moment. “Everything happened at once. My home was falling apart. I was finding out through the press that I had been betrayed while my dad was in the ICU,” she shared, referring to her 91-year-old father William Mebarak Chadid being badly injured in an accident while at the first communion for her son Milan.\n\n“The man I have loved the most in my life, my father, was leaving me when I needed him the most. I couldn’t talk to him, or go to my best friend for the advice I needed so much,” Shakira added, expressing that she thought she “wasn’t going to survive” the pile-on of hardships. But her father’s strength and perseverance has been inspirational.\n\n“He has overcome COVID once, two accidents, one pneumonia and five surgeries— all of this at 91 years of age, in less than six months. My dad is the biggest example of resilience, and my mother has been by his side day and night,” she shared. “They have both been a reflection of that dream that didn’t come true for me. But I hope they are role models for my kids of love, of patience in relationships, of absolute devotion and zest for life.”\n\nMarch 2024: Shakira Says Piqué Isn’t ‘Dragging Me Down’ as She Drops ‘Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran’\n\nShakira has been candid about how much freedom she has now that she’s “husbandless,” explaining that she was able to spend time on her album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran thanks to her new relationship status.\n\n“I didn’t have time because of the husband factor,” she said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “The husband was dragging me down. Now I’m free,” she added. “Now I can actually work.”\n\nThe interview came as she dropped her album that details the separation. “While writing each song I was rebuilding myself,” Shakira said in a press statement at the time. “While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength.”\n\nAbout the album, Suzy Exposito wrote in a Rolling Stone review: “Shakira finally gets to turn the page on these tempestuous past two years, and reintroduce herself–not as Shakira the soccer mom, nor Shakira the heartbroken–but Shakira fucking Mebarak, international pop icon and undefeated champ.”\n\nJune 2024: Shakira Reveals She Got Her ‘Sexy Back’ After Piqué Split\n\nMore than a year after her split from Piqué, Shakira reflected on her process of rediscovery in her Rolling Stone cover story.\n\n“When you leave a relationship of many years, there are things about yourself that seem to have been lost along the way,” Shakira said. “There are things about yourself that you change for the other person or give up. When that relationship breaks down, you feel like you’re left with nothing and you have to heal, search for yourself, and travel back toward the center of yourself.”\n\nShakira shared that she didn’t enjoy putting her career in the backseat while she lived in Barcelona, explaining that she was “wearing sweatpants” and with her hair in a bun for a lot of the relationship. She’s now learned that some sacrifices, including prioritizing her kids, were “nonnegotiable” for her.\n\nTrending\n\n“I think they’ve seen their mother cry. I think they’ve seen her celebrate. I think they’ve seen her laugh. I think they’ve seen her work tirelessly,” she said of her two kids. “And that’s it: I want to show them that life isn’t linear. It’s not how people picture it in the movies. Things don’t turn out the way we want them to, and you have to deal with disappointment. That’s part of the human condition. It’s why we’re here.”"
