        "text": "Shakira is the standard of femininity and beauty. The singer of Colombian origin managed the impossible - to win fans not only at home, but also in Europe and the CIS countries.\n\nThe musical performances of the Colombian performer are characterized by the original style of performance - the singer mixes assorted pop-rock, latin and folk. Concerts from Shakira are a real show that amazes with stage effects and incredible images of the performer.\n\nHow was Shakira's childhood and youth?\n\nThe future Colombian star was born on February 2, 1977 in Barranquilla. It is known that Shakira came from a large family. Since childhood, the girl did not need anything. The father of the future singer was the owner of a jewelry store. But, besides the fact that his father was a successful entrepreneur, he also wrote prose.\n\nShakira was a very gifted girl. It is known that at the age of 4 she could read and write. At the age of 7, his father gave a small talent a typewriter. Shakira began to print poems of her own composition on it. At a young age, parents sent their daughter to a dance school.\n\nShakira just fell in love with oriental dancing. The ability to beautifully control her body was useful to the future star when she began to pursue a musical career. In several clips of Shakira, you can see amazing oriental belly dances.\n\nShe was a very versatile and non-conflict girl. She was adored by teachers and school friends. Shakira was predicted to have a career as a dancer and actress. However, the girl preferred music.\n\nThe beginning of Shakira's musical career\n\nDespite the fact that the father of the future Colombian star was a very influential person, Shakira tried to make her own star road on her own. Once upon a time, her perseverance paid off.\n\nAt one of the talent competitions, a young girl met the famous journalist Monica Ariza. Monica was amazed by Shakira's voice, so she brought her together with representatives of a well-known Colombian recording studio.\n\nIn 1990, Shakira signed with Sony Music. And by the way, it was this event that became the beginning of the development of the girl as a singer and world-class star. After a year of fruitful collaboration, Shakira released her debut album Magia. The debut album cannot be called the most successful commercially.\n\nHowever, thanks to the disk, the young and unknown star gained popularity. The disc consisted of only 9 tracks. But the first 9 solo compositions became mega hits in the historical homeland of the performer - Colombia.\n\nShakira at the movies\n\nThree years later, Shakira tried herself as an actress. The girl starred in one of the popular TV series El Oasis. This helped to expand the audience of fans.\n\nHer acting talent was highly appreciated by critics. The well-known magazine TV Guide called her \"Miss TVK\", organized the shooting of the girl as a rising star of the pop scene and an aspiring actress.\n\nIn 1995, the track Dónde Estás Corazón was released, which literally “blew up” the local music charts. In the same year, her disc Nuestro Rock was released. However, the popularity of the singer did not go beyond Latin America.\n\nIn the same year, the singer organized a concert. She impressed the audience not only with a beautiful voice, but also with artistic data. Choreographic numbers at Shakira's concerts are a separate show that you can watch endlessly.\n\nThe release of the first studio album Pies Descalzos\n\nIn 1996, the first studio album by Pies Descalzos was released. The album's budget was about $100. The disc quickly paid for itself. The album became \"platinum\" not only in Colombia, but also in Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Argentina.\n\nThe first studio album of the Colombian singer was highly appreciated by music critics. A year after the release of the record, Shakira was awarded several awards. She has been nominated for the Billboard Latin Music Awards. It was quite the expected result.\n\nIn 1997, the Colombian star started working on a new album. Returning to Bogota, the singer discovered that unknown people had stolen her personal belongings and a CD with demo recordings. This shocked the star.\n\nShe had to work on the record almost from scratch. The album, which was released in 1997, was thematically titled Dónde Están los Ladrones? (\"Where are the thieves?\").\n\nIn 1999, the Colombian singer received the first Grammy Award. Then Shakira recorded the first live disc MTV Unplugged. This album received five nominations, receiving several of them.\n\nShakira Goes International\n\nShakira wanted international popularity. In 1999, she started recording a record in English. Radio listeners first heard the single from the new English-language album Whenever, Wherever in 2001.\n\nThe track became a real hit and for more than three months held the 1st position in the music charts. Then came the long-awaited album Laundry Service, which was so long awaited in the United States of America. Music critics accused Shakira of imitating American pop singers too much. But American fans warmly accepted Laundry Service, rubbing the disc to holes.\n\nFour years later, an album was released, recorded in Spanish Fijación Oral, Vol. 1. The record was released with a circulation of 4 million copies. Hips Don't Lie has become not only a hit, but also the best-selling track of the last 10 years. The album included more than 10 tracks. He has received four music awards.\n\nCollaboration between Shakira and Beyoncé\n\nIn 2007, Shakira, along with the equally famous Beyoncé, performed the track Beautiful Liar. From the 94th position of the hit parade, the track took the 3rd position. It hasn't been on the Billboard Hot 100 yet. The song held the position of the chart leader for a long time. This track was included in one of Beyoncé's albums.\n\nIn 2009, Shakira performed the track She Wolf, which the audience received very warmly. This track was a presentation of the new She Wolf album, which was not received very warmly by the listeners.\n\nAll due to the fact that Shakira decided to move away from the usual style of performance, recording songs in the style of synth-pop.\n\nIn 2010, the album Shakira was released. The big opening of the album was the single Can't Remember to Forget You, which the singer performed with Rihanna. The song was highly acclaimed by music critics. A video clip was shot for the same track.\n\nA few years of break and the track Chantaje was released, which Shakira recorded with Maluma. This track, which was released in 2016, literally \"blew up\" the whole of Colombia. This duet was harmonious, bright and incredibly successful.\n\nIn May 2017, Shakira released the album El Dorado. Thanks to the record, Shakira received several Grammy awards, as well as Billboard Music and iHeartRadio Music. In support of the album, Shakira embarked on the El Dorado World Tour in 2018.\n\nAfter the tour, Shakira presented the video clip Nada, which gained 10 million views in a few weeks. In 2019, the singer released the album El Dora2, thanks to which she gained significant commercial success. Shakira plans to go on a world tour with new tracks!"
