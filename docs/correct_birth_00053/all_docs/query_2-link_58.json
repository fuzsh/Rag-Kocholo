        "text": "Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll is a popular singer and dancer of Colombian origins, who became a sensation in the music world of the early 2000s. She was born in Columbia and demonstrated incredible talents in music and especially dancing since her early ages. She loved all kinds of music and was preparing herself for stage performances by learning all styles of dancing, from belly dance to rock and roll. Her first solo albums released in the late 1990s were directed only to Spanish speaking audience and were not much noticed in the world. However, the next decade became the one of Shakira's finest hour. Her English solo albums found their places at the highest lines of the most respectable musical media, and her performances were attended by millions of fans around the world. Shakira has won 3 Grammy and 12 Latin Grammy Awards, 5 MTV Awards, & Billboard Awards, and dozens of others. According to the Guinness Book, she is considered to be the best selling Latin American singers of all times. She has released 11 solo albums so far. Shakira is married to a famous soccer player Gerard Pique, and the couple has two lovely sons."
