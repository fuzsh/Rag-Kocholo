        "text": "As an extroverted intuitive, Shakira is open to the reality of the world, objects, and others. She has a special duality to her mind, which is made up of equal parts of intellectual resources and sensitivity, giving her great intuition and humanism. As a function of this latter, she has a great sense of her fellow human and the oracular art of divining people’s unconscious wishes and motivations – in fact, her advice is often sought. In material terms, it gives her a talent for locating lost objects and a spirit of discovery and invention. Overall, she welcomes the signs arriving from the outer world in a positive and liberal way and even incite them to promise more than they can provide. However, when something does not satisfy her, she has the ability to cheer herself up rapidly and is quick to discover whatever positive aspects it may present. This involves a process of readaptation which requires formidable ego transformations, and they are the challenge for her. It is up to her to renew herself, to behave in such a way as to drain her environment of fearsome or threatening aspects.\n\nShe is usually perceived as an idealist. Deep within herself, she senses the presence of a “new life.” It is the crucible of her ideal and all her hopes. The “new life” may assume the garb of various philosophies of liberation; whatever they may be, they all endeavor to revitalize alienated modern people, oppressed and downtrodden by Western civilization. However, in her striving to free herself and her fellow humans from a social contract based on the power of sheer lucre and corrupt lobbies, she displays a singular inclination to depend upon the very social forces she intends to topple. The reason for this is that, because she is quite sociable, the only thing she instinctively grasps profoundly is social action and organization. Her perception of her own personality is vague or even negative. In fact, her grandiose personal gestures are motivated by a need to hide her unavowed feelings of inferiority and, at times, her fear of strong personalities. But she is above all an idealist. Hope is the prime mover of her spirit, and she is continually traveling along the axis of the hope/despair polarity. As she applies herself to ignoring whatever is impervious to her aspirations, she should acquire some certainty of what is still possible – for her and the world. In fact, in relation to her ideal, she behaves realistically, although others are unable to perceive her realism because she expressed herself in such an unconventional and eccentric fashion.\n\nShe is passionately committed to the quest and research she has initiated and will pursue it with determination if not fury. She judges and defines herself in opposition to society, and human relations are vital to the evolution of her personality. An elitist, she does not believe in human equality, preferring individuality. She seeks a way to unite them without abolishing their differences. She would like to create a utopian community with no ideological imperatives, a self-ruled entity which would recognize its own spirit as the only authority. Her definition of friendship is spiritual love, because it establishes a subtle, vast, and delicate web of bonds, not only between people, but between people and things. She imagines a vow of true friendship as a form of freedom which reassures the freedom of others, instead of threatening it. However, she should become aware that this ideal harmony, which is often rather difficult to put into practice, sometimes hides an unavowed fear of deep commitment to another person. For this reason, her love life is among the more erratic.\n\nWarm and giving to the world in general, in certain special cases she may become cold or even distant. She is determined to elude any perceived threat to her freedom and pick her way through a world of paradoxes and contradictions. Her sensuality is associated with her imagination, and she loves people not for what they are in reality, but for the way her imagination transfigures them. The result is disillusionment. But when she falls in love, it’s for real.\n\nShakira has high social aspirations. She believes that by gaining total control of her intellect, feelings, and instincts, she can achieve them.\n\nShakira derives great rewards from every source of pleasure or creation (physical, artistic, or emotional). Shakira has a penchant for speculation.\n\nAt the time of Shakira’s birth, her rising sign was located in Virgo (the Virgin), while the sun was passing through the sign of Aquarius (the Water Bearer). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide her personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of her character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nModesty – Independence – Analytical thought – Rebelliousness – Strict logic – Originality – Attention to detail – Fluctuation – Perfectionism – Irritability – Worry and anxiety – Inventive spirit – Nervousness – Sense of paradox.\n\nShe has a paradoxical nature which hosts two antinomic and conflicting tendencies at opposite poles from one another. As a result, she swings from rebellion against authority to submissiveness, from kookiness to convention. She is methodical at times and chaotic at others, shy on some days and eccentric on others.\n\nDespite this complex psychological structure, her analytical intelligence and inventive spirit have great potential. As she matures, she should attain a harmonious synthesis and balanced coordination between the conflicting tendencies. When she learns to control her nervousness, her lifestyle choices should come together nicely.\n\nBorn in the three and one-half days before the full moon rose, Shakira is said to be a “gibbous moon” lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration gives her a rich, complex personality, although she is sometimes troubled by the feeling she is struggling to do something great. Indeed, a feeling that she is lacking something may preoccupy her until she finds a spiritual or humanitarian cause worthy of her devotion.\n\nDevotion will be important to her as a foundation for her inner and outer development. If she fails to encounter a great and noble cause to which she is willing to pledge herself, she could always make do with a person whose aura and magnetism attract her. Whatever she decides, it is by working to serve a cause or another person that she will approach her own self-transformation."
