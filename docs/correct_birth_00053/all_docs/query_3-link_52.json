        "text": "Shakira and FC Barcelona player Gerard Piqué welcomed a baby boy Thursday night, Barcelona time.\n\nThe Colombian superstar had her baby on schedule by Cesarean section in a Barcelona hospital, according to reports citing a statement from the couple, which first appeared on goal.com and other sports Web sites.\n\nShakira & Gerard Piqué Invite Fans to ‘World Baby Shower’ for Second Son\n\nShakira, 37, and Piqué, 27, had reserved an entire floor for the birth at the Teknon clinic, which is in an upscale neighborhood. The couple’s other son Milan, who turned two on Jan. 22, was delivered at the same hospital by the same doctor. Amid speculations that Shakira’s second baby was about to be born, the private hospital in the usually quiet area was surrounded by paparazzi for several days.\n\nThe name of the baby was not immediately known, but a Spanish radio DJ and friend of Piqué announced earlier this week that it could be Andrea o Sacha.\n\nLast week, Shakira and Piqué invited fans to contribute to their on-line World Baby Shower to benefit UNICEF’s programs for children.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nShakira Reaches New Facebook Milestone\n\n“Motherhood is everything to me,” Shakira said in a recent interview with Spain’s El Pais newspaper.\n\nShakira is next expected to “give birth” to a new album this spring. A global world tour will follow that release."
