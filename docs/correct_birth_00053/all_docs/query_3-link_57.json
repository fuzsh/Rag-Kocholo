        "text": "When Shakira’s \"Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" was released in January of 2023; its success seemed like a freak incident, explainable as a perfect but isolated storm.\n\nTheir virulently catchy track — which happens to spill scalding tea on her breakup with retired Spanish soccer player Gerard Piqué — set streaming records and took home a Latin GRAMMY for Song Of The Year. Today, the song's success looks more like the first crashing wave of a massive comeback for Shakira.\n\nThe three-time GRAMMY winner followed her Bzrp Session with another hit single, \"TQG,\" collaborating with Karol G. That song went to No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200, and the duo cleaned up at the Latin GRAMMYs.\n\nIn hindsight, all of this was a mere preamble to the announcement of Shakira's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran (Women Don't Cry Anymore), due March 22. The album will be her first in seven years, but the sound is very much of the moment, leaning into a high-gloss urban Latin pop sound that delves in reggaeton, bachata and corrido.\n\nThe album is no comeback. With a star as big as Shakira — one who performed at the Super Bowl in 2020 and had her own exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum — it's hard to make the case that she ever left the public eye. Yet the Colombian superstar has put out only a trickle of singles since 2017, when she released her GRAMMY-winning album El Dorado. Prior to the BZRP session, her last major hits were in 2016 with \"La Bicicleta,\" a collaboration with Carlos Vives, and \"Chantaje,\" featuring Maluma, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs.\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about this period of retreat, or her new album, without talking about the personal upheavals Shakira has gone through in recent years. In June of 2022, Shakira and Gerard Piqué, with whom she has two sons, publicly announced the end of their 11 year relationship. Starting with 2022’s \"Monotonía,\" featuring Ozuna, nearly every song she has released since then deals directly with the split and the emotional turmoil she has felt because of it.\n\nThe singer and songwriter herself is not shying away from the fact that her music has been a therapeutic outlet. \"I feel like in this moment of my life, which is probably one of the most difficult, darkest hours of my life, music has brought light,\" she told Elle in 2022.\n\nCase in point: her Bizarrap session. \"Someone should have taken my photo the day I worked on the 'Bizarrap Session 53,' a before and after. Because I went into the studio one way and left in a completely different way,\" Shakira told Mexican television channel Televisa. \"He gave me this space, this opportunity to let it out and it really was a huge release, necessary for my own healing, for my own recovery process.\"\n\nThat feeling of catharsis continued in her work on Las Mujeres. \"Making this body of work has been an alchemical process. While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength,\" the artist said in a statement on Instagram.\n\nShakira is styling the album as a testament to resilience in the face of adversity, tapping into an understanding that her experiences have a broad resonance. While accepting Billboard’s 2023 Woman Of The Year award, Shakira discussed her \"year of seismic change.\"\n\n\"I've felt more than ever — and very personally — what it is to be a woman,\" she said. \"It's been a year where I've realized we women are stronger than we think, braver than we believed, more independent than we were taught to be.\"\n\nIndeed, with strength and bravery, Shakira proceeded to channel her individual hurt into a message of universal empowerment. Ahead of her album release, she’s even more explicit about the details of her separation and the impact the relationship had on her career. \"For a long time I put my career on hold, to be next to Gerard, so he could play football. There was a lot of sacrifice for love,\" recently told The Sunday Times.\n\nAs she told Billboard for her 2023 cover story, settling down in Barcelona with Piqué and their two children, far from music industry centers, made it difficult for her to work. \"It was complicated logistically to get a collaborator there. I had to wait for agendas to coincide or for someone to deign to come,\" she explained.\n\nShakira has since relocated to Miami, a location that played a major role in making her new album possible.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of a true pop star is the ability to evolve with the culture without losing their identity. Over decades, and with each release, Shakira has broken a barrier or risen above an obstacle to succeed beyond expectations – whether it’s leading the first Spanish-language broadcast on MTV with her 2000 \"Unplugged\" concert, or learning English to write her own crossover pop debut. Each move has felt authentic.\n\nIt is not an easy task, but Shakira accomplishes this alchemy beautifully every few album cycles, starting with her debut as an alt-leaning, brunette singer/songwriter in the mid '90s. At the turn of the millennium, she made the jump to international fame with a cascade of golden curls and Laundry Service, the English-language album that capitalized on the first wave of crossover Latin pop. She closed out the decade in a whirl of high-gloss dance pop with the Pharell produced She Wolf. Along the way, there was one platinum selling album after another and the No. 1 hit \"Hips Don’t Lie,\" among several Top 10 singles, setting the stage for her to blaze through much of the 2010s.\n\nShakira is well-aware of how hard she has had to work even after crossover success.\n\nIn 2019, she told Billboard, \"This whole new world had opened up to me, and with it came so many great opportunities, but I continued to pursue impossible goals such as making a song like 'Hips Don’t Lie,' for example—that had a Colombian cumbia and a mention of Barranquilla in the middle of it—play on American radio. I remember I said to [then Sony Music Chairman] Donny Ienner, ‘You have to trust me on this one. This is going to happen, this song is going to blow up.’\"\n\nWith El Dorado, she caught the second wave of Latin pop crossover, the one tipped off by Luis Fonsi’s now-infamous 2017 earworm \"Despacito.\" El Dorado, is one of Shakira’s more Latin leaning albums in the long history of her bicultural and bilingual music career. The songs are sung largely in Spanish and her choice of features on the album are almost entirely Latin pop and reggaeton artists: Maluma, Nicky Jam, Prince Royce and Carlos Vives. The album's May 2017 release coincided with a rising global interest in reggaeton.\n\nShakira wasn’t following a trend; she was just in touch with the moment as usual. She released \"Chantaje\" months before \"Despacito,\" and \"Bicicleta,\" her song with Carlos Vives, which combines elements of reggaeton and vallenato, came out in 2016.\n\nWith the continued mainstream global success of Latin artists, Shakira may no longer see a need to release an English-language album for every album in her mother tongue. Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran breaks with tradition in that it is her second Spanish-language album in a row. It's also loaded with features from the world of Latin music, including Ozuna, Rauw Alejandro, Manuel Turizo, and Karol G. The moment could not be better for an album that explores forward looking pop reggaeton, assisted by some of the brightest young stars in the genre.\n\nIf the past is any indicator, this era is going to be another step up for the artist. Beyond the album release, Shakira is teasing another tour. As she told Billboard, \"I think this will be the tour of my life. I’m very excited. Just think, I had my foot on the brakes. Now I’m pressing on the accelerator­ — hard.\"\n\nEvery Year Is The Year Of Shakira: 10 Songs That Prove She's Always Been A Superstar\n\nMarch is Women’s History Month, and women in music are more powerful than ever.\n\nThe month begins with the comeback of several queens, starting with Kim Gordon’s The Collective and Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine. Later, country darling Kacey Musgraves will unveil Deeper Well, and Shakira will drop the empowering Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. Long-awaited debuts by GRAMMY-winning singer Tyla and singer/bassist Blu DeTiger will also join the lineup, with their respective Tyla and All I Ever Want Is Everything. Wrapping up March on a high note, Beyoncé will drop her highly-anticipated Act II on the 29th.\n\nMen will release music in March as well: Expect new releases by Justin Timberlake, Bleachers, the last record from pop-punk band Sum 41, and (allegedly) Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 2.\n\nTo make the most of this prolific time, GRAMMY.com compiled all the must-hear albums dropping March 2024.\n\nSchoolboy Q - Blue Lips\n\nRelease date: March 1\n\nOn Feb. 1, Schoolboy Q’s website was updated with a mysterious countdown and a 37-second video. In it, the rapper finally unveiled the setlist and title of his much-awaited sixth studio album, Blue Lips, as well as its release date — March 1.\n\nBlue Lips is Q’s first full record since 2019’s Crash Talk, although he had been teasing the album since 2020. Hopefully, it was worth the wait: Blue Lips holds 18 tracks and participations by Rico Nasty, Freddie Gibbs, and more. Q has also started a new vlog series on social media called \"wHy not?,\" where he takes the viewers behind the scenes of making the album and previews snippets of the songs.\n\nSo far, the rapper shared tracks \"Blueslides,\" \"Back n Love\" with Devin Malik, \"Cooties\" and \"Love Birds\" with Devin Malik and Lance Skiiwalker, as well as lead single \"Yeern 101.\"\n\nBleachers - Bleachers\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFronted by 10-time GRAMMY winner and 2024 Producer Of The Year Jack Antonoff, rock band Bleachers will release its eponymous fourth studio album on March 8.\n\nIn a press release, Bleachers is described as Antonoff’s \"distinctly New Jersey take on the bizarre sensory contradictions of modern life.\" The self-titled record will blend sadness and joy into \"music for driving on the highway to, for crying to and for dancing to at weddings.\"\n\nThe band shared four singles so far: lead track \"Modern Girl,\" \"Alma Mater\" featuring Lana del Rey, \"Tiny Moves\" and \"Me Before You.\" Through serendipitous melodies and soulful writing, Bleachers commit to \"exist in crazy times but remember what counts.\"\n\nBleachers will tour the U.K. in March and the U.S. in May and June.\n\nKim Gordon - The Collective\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFormer Sonic Youth vocalist Kim Gordon will release her sophomore LP, The Collective, on March 8. The album is a follow-up to her 2019 debut No Home Record, and furthers her collaboration with producer Justin Raisen, as well as additional producing from Anthony Paul Lopez.\n\n\"On this record, I wanted to express the absolute craziness I feel around me right now,\" said Gordon in a press statement. \"This is a moment when nobody really knows what truth is, when facts don’t necessarily sway people, when everyone has their own side, creating a general sense of paranoia. To soothe, to dream, escape with drugs, TV shows, shopping, the internet, everything is easy, smooth, convenient, branded. It made me want to disrupt, to follow something unknown, maybe even to fail.\"\n\nBack in January, the singer unveiled the album’s moody first single, \"Bye Bye,\" and a music video starring her daughter, Coco Gordon Moore. The second single, \"I’m A Man,\" came out in February. Gordon will play six concerts in support of The Collective, starting March 21 in Burlington, Vermont.\n\nAriana Grande - Eternal Sunshine\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nIt’s been almost four years since Ariana Grande’s last studio album, 2020’s Positions. The starlet spent the past few years filming Wicked, an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, and declared that she wouldn’t be releasing any new records until it was done.\n\nThe wait is finally over, as Grande announced her seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine. The album’s first and only single, \"Yes, And?,\" dropped in January, followed by an Instagram video of the soprano singer explaining the concept of the album to her Republic Records team.\n\n\"It’s kind of a concept album ’cause it’s all different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience,\" she said. \"Some of [the songs] are really vulnerable, some of them are like playing the part of what people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with it.\"\n\n\"I think this one may be your favorite,\" Grande wrote of Eternal Sunshine on her Instagram Story. \"It is mine.\" The 13-song collection will reportedly explore house and R&B, and will have only one feature: Grande’s grandmother, who appears on the last track, \"Ordinary Things.\"\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign -Vultures 2\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nAfter a series of delays, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s first collaborative album, Vultures 1, ultimately dropped on Feb. 10, 2024. Set to be the first installment of a trilogy, the album was released independently through West’s YZY label, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with all of its 16 tracks also charting on Billboard’s Hot 100.\n\nBilled as ¥$, the duo plans to release Vultures 2 on March 8, and follow up with Vultures 3 on April 5. Although any other info about the upcoming volumes is still unclear, Timbaland recently shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Vultures 2 is \"OTW.\" (Timbaland produced Vultures 1’s \"Keys to My Life\" and \"Fuk Sumn\" with Playboi Carti and Travis Scott.)\n\nIn the past month, West and $ign held a few listening parties for the album in the U.S. and Europe, but additional schedules are yet to be revealed.\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain - Glasgow Eyes\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nTo celebrate their 40th anniversary, alt-rock band the Jesus and Mary Chain will release their eighth studio album, Glasgow Eyes, on March 8.\n\nAs it can be seen on lead single \"Jamcod,\" the Scottish group still runs strong on the distorted synths and electrifying guitars that shaped their sound. \"People should expect a Jesus and Mary Chain record, and that’s certainly what Glasgow Eyes is,\" vocalist Jim Reid said in a statement. \"Our creative approach is remarkably the same as it was in 1984, just hit the studio and see what happens. We went in with a bunch of songs and let it take its course. There are no rules, you just do whatever it takes.\"\n\nGlasgow Eyes also mends a six-year gap since the Jesus and Mary Chain’s latest album, 2017’s Damage and Joy. To further commemorate, the band will also release an autobiography and embark on a European tour throughout March and April.\n\nJustin Timberlake - Everything I Thought It Was\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nJustin Timberlake is back with his first studio album since 2018’s Man of the Woods. The new record, Everything I Thought It Was, is spearheaded by singles \"Selfish\" and \"Drown.\"\n\n\"I worked for a long time on this album, and I ended up with 100 songs. So, narrowing them down to 18 was a thing,\" said Timberlake in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1. \"I’m really excited about this album. I think every artist probably says this, but it is my best work.\" The Memphis singer also shared that there are \"incredibly honest\" moments in the album, but also \"a lot of f—ng fun.\"\n\nTo celebrate his return, Timberlake announced his Forget Tomorrow World Tour. Set to kick off on April 29 in Vancouver, the tour will cross through North America and Europe until its final date on Dec. 16 in Indianapolis.\n\nKacey Musgraves - Deeper Well\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nFresh off winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 2024 GRAMMYs for the Zach Bryan duet \"I Remember Everything,\" Kacey Musgraves announced her fifth studio album, Deeper Well..\n\n\"My Saturn has returned/ When I turned 27/ Everything started to change,\" she sings in the contemplative title track, exploring how she changed over the last few years. The single sets the tone for the rest of the record, which was co-produced by longtime collaborators Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian.\n\nFeaturing 14 tracks, Deeper Well was mostly recorded at the legendary Electric Lady studios in New York City. \"I was seeking some different environmental energy, and Electric Lady has the best mojo. Great ghosts,\" the country star noted in a press release.\n\nOn social media, Musgraves wrote: \"it’s a collection of songs I hold very dear to my heart. I hope it makes a home in all of your hearts, too.\" Deeper Well follows 2021’s star-crossed.\n\nTierra Whack - World Wide Whack\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nWhen rapper Tierra Whack released her first album, 2018’s Whack World, she quickly garnered the admiration of both critics and fans. Comprising 15 one-minute tracks and music videos for each, the release was a refreshing introduction to a groundbreaking artist.\n\nIn 2024, the Philadelphia-born star is preparing to release World Wide Whack, labeled her official debut album in a press release. The cover artwork, created by Alex Da Corte, was inspired by theater character Pierrot, fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli and Donna Summer, and represents \"the first reveal of the World Wide Whack character, an alter ego both untouchable and vulnerable, superhuman and painfully human, whose surprising story will unfold in images and video over the course of the album’s visual rollout.\"\n\nThe album follows Whack’s 2021 EP trilogy — Rap?, Pop? and R&B? — and is foreshadowed by the poignant \"27 Club\" and the eccentric \"Shower Song.\"\n\nTyla - Tyla\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nAfter a glowing 2023 with viral hit \"Water,\" South African newcomer Tyla started 2024 with a blast. Last month, she became the first person to win a GRAMMY for Best African Music Performance, and the youngest-ever African singer to win a GRAMMY Award at 22 years old.\n\nNext month is poised to be even better: Tyla’s eponymous debut LP drops on March 22, featuring \"Water\" and other hits like \"Truth or Dare,\" \"Butterflies\" and \"On and On,\" as well as a guest appearance by labelmate Travis Scott.\n\n\"African music is going global and I’m so blessed to be one of the artists pushing the culture,\" Tyla shared on Instagram. Her unique blend of amapiano, pop and R&B is making waves around the world, and the star will rightfully celebrate by touring Europe and North America throughout this spring.\n\nShakira - Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nThe title of Shakira’s new album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, is a nod to her 2023 hit \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" with Argentine DJ Bizarrap. In the lyrics, she states that \"las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan\" — \"women don’t cry anymore, they make money.\"\n\nThe single is a diss to Shakira’s ex-partner, footballer Gerard Piqué, and, like the rest of the record, served as a healing experience after their separation. \"Making this body of work has been an alchemical process,\" the Colombian star said in a statement. \"While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength.\"\n\nLas Mujeres will feature 16 songs, including her Bizarrap collaboration and singles \"Te Felicito\" with Rauw Alejandro, \"Copa Vacía\" with Manuel Turizo, \"Acróstico,\" \"Monotonía\" with Ozuna, \"El Jefe\" with Mexican band Fuerza Regida, and \"TQG\" with fellow Colombian Karol G.\n\nSheryl Crow - Evolution\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nBack in 2018, Sheryl Crow said that the LP Threads would be her last — fortunately, she changed her mind. \"I said I’d never make another record, though there was no point to it,\" the singer shared in a statement about her upcoming album, Evolution. \"This music comes from my soul. And I hope whoever hears this record can feel that.\"\n\nAccording to the same statement, \"Evolution is Sheryl Crow at her most authentically human self,\" and its music and lyrics \"came from sitting in the quiet and writing from a deep soul place.\"\n\nThe entire album was written in a month, starting with the title track, which expresses Crow’s anxieties about artificial intelligence and the future of humans. From then on, Crow and producer Mike Elizondo found bliss. \"The songs just kept flowing out of me, four songs turned into nine and it was pretty obvious this was an album,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the album's title track, Crow also shared singles \"Do It Again\" and \"Alarm Clock.\"\n\nSum 41 - Heaven :x: Hell\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAfter nearly three decades together, punk-metal mavericks Sum 41 are parting ways. Their final release will be a double album. Heaven :x: Hell, set to drop on March 29.\n\nHeaven is composed of 10 pop-punk tracks reminiscent of the band’s early years, while Hell is 10 tracks of pure heavy metal, reflecting the direction they took more recently. \"Once I heard the music, I was confident enough to say, ‘This is the record I’d like to go out on,'\" frontman Deryck Whibley said in a statement. \"We’ve made a double album of pop punk and metal, and it makes sense. It took a long time for us to pave this lane for ourselves, but we did, and it’s unique to us.\"\n\nThe band shared singles \"Landmines,\" \"Rise Up\" and \"Waiting on a Twist of Fate,\" and proved that they’re leaving on top of their game. \"I love Sum 41, what we’ve achieved, endured, and stuck together through, which is why I want to call it quits,\" Whibley added. \"It’s the right time to walk away from it. I’m putting all of my energy into what’s ahead.\"\n\nBut before embarking on new ventures, Sum 41 will spend the rest of the year touring throughout Asia, North America, and Europe.\n\nBlu DeTiger - All I Ever Want Is Everything\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAt only 26 years old, Blu DeTiger has already toured with Caroline Polachek, played bass for Jack Antonoff’s band Bleachers, partnered with Fender, and appeared on the 2023 Forbes 30 Under 30’s music list.\n\nNow, she prepares to release her debut studio album, All I Ever Want Is Everything. \"This album is about growing and becoming, settling into yourself and learning to love where you’re at through it all. It’s about learning how to be your own best friend,\" the bassist and singer wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Dangerous Game,\" the lead single off the album, showcases DeTiger’s effervescent energy and potential for pop stardom. Starting April, she will also headline a U.S. tour across Boston, Washington D.C., New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nBeyoncé - Act II\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nThe \"She Wolf\" is back. Shakira is setting the stage for her much-anticipated return with her latest album full of songs that empower women, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran (Women No Longer Cry), set to drop on March 22.\n\nLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran will be her first album release in seven years, following the success of El Dorado in 2017, and a pivotal year defined by press speculation following her highly publicized separation and financial case.\n\nIn a heartfelt Instagram post, Shakira shared, \"My new album, coming out March 22, is one I created together with all of you, my pack of shewolves who were there for me every step of the way.\"\n\nThe album promises to be a testament to the collective spirit and shared journey with a circle of women who have been her support system. It's a theme present throughout her discography, and highlighted by songs such as \"She Wolf\" (2009), which first garnered her the nickname \"La Loba\" (which means \"She Wolf\" in Spanish.)\n\nLas Mujeres follows a banner 12 months for the Baraquilla-born Colombian singer/songwriter, which included a Latin GRAMMY for Song Of The Year and an exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nWith a career that has consistently topped charts and broken records beginning with her international debut in 2001, the three-time GRAMMY winner and \"Queen of Latin Music\" remains a formidable force. Shakira's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran is not just another album; it's a chapter in an ongoing saga of artistic evolution and personal growth.\n\nHere's what GRAMMY.com gathered about Shakira's upcoming bit of alchemy.\n\nIt Will Be Released On March 22\n\nMark your calendars for March 22. Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran makes its global debut via Sony Music Entertainment during Women's History Month.\n\nWe Already Know Some Of The Songs\n\nOf the 17 tracks featured on the album's pre-save sneak peak, seven have already made their mark as singles, including \"Copa Vacía\" and \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53.\" The latter track won her the Latin GRAMMY for Song Of The Year at the 2023 Latin GRAMMYs.\n\nThe Tracklist is Huge\n\nThe following tracklist was released on Feb. 29, featuring new collaborations with Cardi B, Rauw Alejandro, Bizarrap, Grupo Frontera, Tiësto and more.\n\n1.

It's a message that resonates deeply in today's zeitgeist and with her own struggles, emphasizing women's resilience and an ability to turn adversity into triumph.\n\nShakira's Tapping Into Some Magic\n\nShakira describes the album's creation as \"an alchemical process,\" where each song served as a step towards self-reconstruction.\n\n\"While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength,\" she elaborates in her Instagram announcement.\n\nThere Are Four Editions\n\nShakira is taking the concept of alchemy — best known for its aim to turn base metals into valuable materials (such as transforming lead into gold) — even further.\n\nFans will have the opportunity to buy the album in four distinct editions, each following the theme of precious materials: diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emerald. Each version will showcase unique cover art and the vinyl version will come pressed in corresponding colors.\n\nTwo Great Reasons We Had To Wait\n\nAs a single mother to two boys, Shakira embodies the archetype of a strong independent woman \"doing it all.\"\n\nIn an intimate conversation with Billboard in her September 2023 cover feature, she shared insights into the challenges and triumphs of creating music while fully immersed in the rhythms of family life.\n\n\"Now I can release music at a faster clip, although sometimes I think being a single mom and the rhythm of a pop star aren’t compatible,\" she explained. \"I have to put my kids to bed, go to the recording studio; everything is uphill.\"\n\nEvery Year Is The Year Of Shakira: 10 Songs That Prove She's Always Been A Superstar"
