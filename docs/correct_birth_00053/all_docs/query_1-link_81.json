        "text": "Welcome to Latinometrics. We bring you Latin American insights and trends through concise, thought-provoking data visualizations.\n\nThank you to the 179 new subscribers who have joined us since last week!\n\nTo see all of our charts today, and get our full Domingo Brief, become a paid subscriber below:\n\nKarla Berman joins us again today to discuss how Shakira broke the Hispanic Internet.\n\nToday's charts:\n\nShakira & Bizarrap take the world by storm\n\nCosta Rica‚Äôs high unemployment\n\nHow much is a GB of data in your country?\n\nMake sure you check out the comment of the week at the bottom!\n\nMusic Industry üé§\n\nLove it or hate it, Shakira has quickly \"facturado\" her very public divorce, earning an estimated $71K ‚Äì $572K since her collab with Bizarrap was released.\n\nThe launch has become a global sensation, reaching 100M views on YouTube within the first three days of its release. This makes it the fastest-ever song in Spanish to break 100M views on YouTube. Their achievement is even more mind-blowing because the only other artists to reach this milestone are K-Pop, Indian, and Japanese. You read that correctly; Shakira's Spanish song achieved more views in 3 days than any song by Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, BeyonceÃÅ, or Justin Bieber has ever been able to.\n\nFor the memesphere and pop culture, this is a lesson in meme generation. And to prove it, Clara-mente (clearly), we're jumping on the bandwagon with our chart.\n\nOne line after the other of the song co-authored by Shakira is really thought out to become an Instagram post. The winning quote has been \"Las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan,\" which roughly translates to \"Women no longer cry, they send their invoice.\"\n\nBizarrap is undoubtedly an artist worth highlighting and deserves a Latinometrics chart of his own at some point. The sunglass-sporting Argentinian music producer has independently collaborated with artists of all kinds and garnered an incredible 6B+ YouTube views since joining the platform in 2017.\n\nBiza's career started by filming local rap battles in his small hometown of Ramos Mejia. Nowadays, the 24-year-old music prodigy can catapult emerging artists' careers with a single collaboration. Latin music stars like Nicky Jam, Residente, Trueno (and now Shakira) eagerly fly to his home to be a part of his impressively viral track record.\n\nThis most recent collaboration is on track to become the biggest yet, and the effects go beyond the music scene. For marketers, the way Casio reacted can serve as a case study. The rarely mentioned brand has garnered more than 5.7M in earned media on Instagram in the last few days following Shakira's line that her ex \"traded a Rolex for a Casio,\" or Shakira for his lover. A parody account also showed a picture of a young Shakira wearing a Casio.\n\nThe brand took advantage of the diss by acting fast, enlisting Casio owners to call themselves #teamcasio by sharing this image on its Instagram page. According to Google Trends, searches for the brand have grown 7x in some countries since the song was released, and sales will surely follow.\n\nShakira's song alludes to the fact that women no longer need to suffer in private when faced with betrayal, injustice, or abuse, whether in the workplace or the love space. Instead, they can actually own their story and seek justice in whatever way it may come.\n\nLabor Market üë©‚Äçüöí"
