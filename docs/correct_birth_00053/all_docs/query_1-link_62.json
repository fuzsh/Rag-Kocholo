What does Mebarak do, and what happened to him?\n\nShakira's musical versatility has earned her the Queen of Latin Music title. She is regarded as a pioneer in extending the global reach of Latino singers after conquering both English and Spanish-speaking audiences. Apart from her superstar status, Shakira is family-oriented and has often shown the world that she is a loving sister, daughter, aunt, and mother.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid's profiles summary and bio\n\nFull nameWilliam Mebarak ChadidDate of birth6th September 1931Age91 years old in 2023Birth signVirgoPlace of birthNew York City, New York, United StatesNationalityColombian-AmericanEthnicityLebaneseReligionCatholic ChristianGenderMaleOrientationStraightMarital statusMarriedWifeNidia del Carmen Ripoll Torrado (current), Lucila Mebarak (divorced)ChildrenTen, including ShakiraGrandchildrenMilan Piqué Mebarak, Sasha Piqué MebarakParentsAlberto Mebarak Spath and Isabel Chadid BaizerProfessionRetired professor and journalist, author, singerNet worthApprox $1 millionKnown forBeing Shakira's father\n\nWho are Shakira's parents?\n\nWho is Shakira's father? The Colombian singer is the daughter of William Mebarak Chadid and his wife, Nidia Ripoll Torrado, a Colombian lady with Catalonian and Italian roots. It is unclear when her parents tied the knot, but they have been together since the Hips Don't Lie hitmaker was born.\n\nBefore Nidia became William Mebarak Chadid's spouse, the celebrity father was married to Lucila Mebarak. Shakira's stepmother kept a low profile after her divorce, and nothing has been heard from her ever since.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid's age\n\nShakira's father, Mebarak, was born on 6th September 1931. He is 91 years old in 2023, and his zodiac sign is Virgo.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid's origin\n\nChadid was born in New York City, New York, United States, to Lebanese parents Alberto Mebarak Spath and Isabel Chadid Baizer. His family relocated to Colombia when he was five years old.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid's children\n\n91-year-old William has ten children from his two marriages. He welcomed nine kids with his first wife, Lucila Mebarak, including Edward, Ana, Lucy, José Antonio, Alberto, Tonino, Patricia, Moises, and Robin. William and his current wife Nidia have one child, superstar Shakira, born in February 1977.\n\nAlberto works as a lawyer; Lucy is a neurosurgeon based in Barranquilla, Colombia; José Antonio is a businessman based in Miami, Florida; Patricia is a special education teacher in Valencia, while Moises works at the Department of Psychology at Universidad del Norte in Colombia. Shakira's half-brother Tonino works on her team and was the road manager for the Dorado World Tour.\n\nMebarak's eldest son lost his life at 19 after being involved in a fatal motorcycle accident. The tragedy inspired Shakira's song Tus Gafas Oscuras which she composed at nine years old. William has several grandchildren, including Shakira's sons, Sasha Piqué Mebarak and Milan Piqué Mebarak.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid's job\n\n91-year-old William has done several jobs, including being a radio announcer and journalist, musician, jeweller, and insurance agent. He was a literature professor and authored the book Al Viento y Al Azar in 2013.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid's net worth\n\nChadid has an estimated net worth of $1 million. His superstar daughter Shakira is the richest in the Mebarak family, with an estimated net worth of $300 million in 2023.\n\nWhat happened to Shakira's father?\n\nWilliam was hospitalized after a bad fall in late May 2022. Shakira broke the news on Twitter after fans showed concern when they saw her riding in an ambulance in Barcelona. She later revealed that her dad had survived Covid, underwent two surgeries, and had two falls in one year while wishing him a happy 91st birthday.\n\nWhere is Shakira right now?\n\nAfter leaving Spain, the Colombian singer started living in Miami, Florida, with her two sons, Milan and Sasha. She moved to the US city in April 2023, several months after splitting from retired Spanish footballer Gerard Piqué in June 2022.\n\nThe singer and Gerard Piqué were together for 11 years. Some of Shakira's neighbours in Miami are Dwayne Wade, Cindy Crawford, Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin.\n\nWilliam Mebarak Chadid is lucky to have a loving family to look after him in his old age. Thanks to him, Latin America has produced one of the best singers of this generation.\n\nREAD ALSO: The untold story of Haley Arnaz, Desi and Amy Arnaz's daughter\n\nBriefly.co.za highlighted lesser-known facts about Haley Arnaz. She was adopted by retired actor Desi Arnaz Jr when he married her mother, Amy Arnaz.\n\nHaley is the adoptive granddaughter of the late multi-award-winning entertainer Lucille Ball, who is remembered for starring in the I Love Lucy sitcom.
