        "text": "It's a bouncing baby boy for Shakira! The Colombian singer welcomed her first son with boyfriend Gerard Pique on Tuesday, Jan. 22, in Barcelona, her rep confirmed to Us Weekly.\n\n\"We are happy to announce the birth of Milan Piqué Mebarak, son of Shakira Mebarak and Gerard Piqué, born January 22nd at 9:36pm, in Barcelona, Spain,\" the proud singer wrote on her site, explaining that \"the name Milan (pronounced MEE-lahn), means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification.\"\n\n\"Just like his father, baby Milan became a member of FC Barcelona at birth,\" the site stated. \"The hospital confirmed that the couple's first child weighed approximately 6lbs. 6 ounces, and that both mother and child are in excellent health.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old mentor for The Voice urged fans to join her and her Spanish soccer star boyfriend, 25, in welcoming their happy bundle of joy after reportedly being rushed to the the hospital Tuesday.\n\n\"I'd like to ask you all to accompany me in your prayers on this very important day of my life. Shak,\" she posted to her Twitter in both Spanish and English earlier in the afternoon.\n\nAnxious father-to-be Pique also shared his excitement with fans on his Instagram prior to his son's birth.\n\n\"This Tuesday (22 of January) our first son will be born,\" he posted. Fans responded with well wishes and congratulations for the expectant parents.\n\nThe happy couple previously threw fans and the media for a loop with a false alarm back in December, when Pique announced their son's birth as part of an April Fool’s Day-like holiday prank.\n\n\"Our son has been born! We are very happy! Thanks to all for your messages,\" he tweeted his 4.7 million followers in Spanish on Dec. 27. After sending everyone into a flurry, however, the prankster athlete clarified that Shakira was still very much with child.\n\n\"It has a name! His name is Innocent!\" he clarified on the social media site. \"Happy Dia de los Inocentes to all!\"\n\nShakira and her soccer playing beau, who have been spotted together since March 2011, first announced their pregnancy via Facebook last September.\n\nThe \"Tortura\" singer hasn't been in any rush to have her baby, however. Just as month, she posted a shot of her showing off her large baby belly with Pique by her side.\n\n\"I could have another nine months like this,\" she tweeted. The couple also recently threw a virtual baby shower to fete their son's arrival.\n\n\"To celebrate the arrival of our first child, we hope that, in his name, other less privileged children in the world can have their basic needs covered through gifts and donations,\" the invitation read, sent along with a stunning photo of Shakira and her bare baby bump. \"Thank you for sharing this unforgettable moment with us.\""
