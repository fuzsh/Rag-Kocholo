        "text": "Dubbed the Queen of Latin music, Shakira has acquired quite a few majestic homes throughout her career. The musical sensation, known for hits such as “Hips Don’t Lie,” “Whenever, Wherever/ Suerte,” and “La Tortura,” was born in Barranquilla, Colombia. She began performing at the age of 10, and released her first album in 1991. In 2001, she released her first English-language album, Laundry Service, and began adding to her real estate portfolio. Over the years, the songstress and UNICEF goodwill ambassador has owned properties in the US, Uruguay, Spain, Cyprus, and the Bahamas, each showcasing her minimalist style when it comes to interiors. Take a peek at the globetrotting singer’s properties worldwide and find out where her latest move has taken her and her two children.\n\n2001\n\nAs Shakira climbed the American charts, she also put down roots in Miami. The singer purchased a Mediterranean-style home for $1.075 million on La Gorce Island in Biscayne Bay, an exclusive private-island neighborhood that has been home to celebs like Cher, Matt Damon, and Ricky Martin. The four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath home was built in 1988 and was outfitted with a garden, patio, and pool. She sold the house in 2005 for $1.8 million.\n\nBut Shakira wasn’t done house hunting. That same year she bought another home for $3.38 million on La Gorce Island, and this one boasted an amenity the other lacked: a water-front address. The six-bedroom house has a dock with 100 feet of access to the bay and boasts stunning water views. The home was built in 1951 but was updated over the years, including by the singer, who built a three-bedroom addition. Shakira collaborated with architects Ben Lopez and Associates and interior decorator Renata Lessa Bastos of Trace Design Studio on the property. “Shakira’s taste is airy, bright, and warm, with a mixture of white textures, and there are touches of silver metallics—she doesn’t like gold—with complements of lavender, lilac, and fuchsia here and there for a bit of color,” Bastos told AD in 2018. “There are also traces of her Lebanese and Middle Eastern heritage infused throughout the otherwise minimalist interiors, including bone-inlaid pieces, handmade decorative mirrors, and a low-profile hookah lounge area.”\n\nThe singer put the home up for sale several times over the years, and in 2018 she put it on the market for $11.648 million, with her brother Antonio Mebarak serving as one of her real estate agents. It was listed for $15.9 million in 2021 and then taken off the market.\n\n2000s\n\nThe songstress began dating lawyer Antonio de la Rúa, son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa, in 2000. During their relationship the couple shared a seven-bedroom farm near Punta del Este, Uruguay, called La Colorada. Shakira used the scenic 12-acre property as a vacation spot and creative retreat, spending a month there in 2008 to work on new music. “This is a very special, magical place, and I come looking for the muses of Juana Ibarbourou, my favorite poet, to see if she enlightens me,” she told El Pais at the time. She also showed the newspaper the two-story recording studio that had been created in the property’s barn. The farm’s other amenities included a gym, heated pool, tennis court, sauna, and lake with boats.\n\nThe couple announced their breakup in 2011, and the next few years were tumultuous and filled with lawsuits, with de la Rúa suing the singer for $100 million and attempting to gain control of her Swiss bank account. De la Rúa retained possession of La Colorada following the split.\n\n2012\n\nFollowing her split from de la Rúa, Shakira started seeing Spanish soccer star Gerard Piqué. The two met on the music video set for “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” which was the 2010 FIFA World Cup anthem. In 2013, they had their first child, Milan Piqué Mebarak, and a second son, Sasha Piqué Merbarak, followed in 2015. The couple settled in Barcelona, building a large home in the Esplugues de Llobregat area of the city in 2012. The house has five stories—three above ground and two below—and includes a gym, recording studio, cinema, pool, and multiple terraces. The complex also includes a guest house with its own pool.\n\nThe purchase of the home would contribute to the singer’s later legal troubles. In 2018, Shakira was charged with tax evasion, with prosecutors claiming that Spain was her official residence from 2012 to 2014. The singer listed the Bahamas as her residence during that time and made the move to Spain official in 2015. “I didn’t spend 183 days per year at that time at all,” Shakira told ELLE in 2022. “I was busy fulfilling my professional commitments around the world.”\n\n2015\n\nA few years later, the couple purchased another home in Barcelona, this one on Avenida Pearson in Pedralbes, for a reported $5.4 million. The 16,000-plus-square-foot house boasted seven bedrooms, two kitchens, a gym, and a pool complete with a waterfall. The pair had been interested in the property for years and were able to snag it for far less than the original $11.9 million price.\n\nThe home in Esplugues de Llobregat remained the family’s primary residence, and control of the house became an issue when Shakira and Piqué split up in June 2022. In November, the couple reached a custody agreement, and in April of 2023, Shakira and her two sons left Barcelona for her mansion in Miami. “I settled in Barcelona to provide my children with stability, the same thing we now search for in another corner of the world next to family, friends, and the sea,” Shakira posted on Instagram on April 2.\n\n2019\n\nEven after settling in Barcelona, Shakira continued to expand her real estate portfolio. In 2019, she reportedly purchased a villa in Peyia, a town in the Paphos District of Cyprus. The six-bedroom vacation home overlooks the Mediterranean and is located in the Cap St. George resort."
