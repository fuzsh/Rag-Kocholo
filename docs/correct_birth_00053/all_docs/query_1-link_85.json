        "text": "SHAKIRA has reportedly set up home in her plush £12million Miami mansion after the singer ditched Barcelona following her split from Gerard Pique.\n\nThe Colombian popstar, 46, counts the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Matt Damon as her neighbours in the exclusive Miami Beach waterfront enclave.\n\nThe Hips Don't Lie singer has owned the 8,708 sqft six-bedroom property since 2001 when she completely renovated it.\n\nShe brought hard wood floors from Spain, a new front door from Europe and had custom-designed furniture imported.\n\nAccording to Marca, Shakira will move back into the home as she starts her new life in Florida.\n\nThe impressive gated estate boasts a stunning heated swimming pool and outdoor kitchen surrounded by palm trees with spectacular views over the bay.\n\nThe property, which she used to share with Pique, even has it’s own private dock for a boat.\n\nWith a luxurious white minimalist interior, it has a spacious living room with glass coffee tables and a huge white sofa with matching chairs.\n\nIn the dining space, a rug sits underneath the table and chairs in an apparent nod to Shakira's Lebanese roots.\n\nOne of the seven bathrooms boasts two sinks and a massive bathtub, while the kitchen provides a functional space to cook and entertain with views of the garden.\n\nShakira displays her pop awards in the office area, and there’s a whole \"entertainment wing\" at the back of the house.\n\nIt contains a small home cinema, an all-white pool table and a hookah lounge with sofas and huge windows.\n\nBuilt in 1951, Shakira reportedly bought the home in 2001 for €2.5million and put the property up for sale in 2018 for €9.4million.\n\nBut the sales listing was removed in August 2021 - suggesting Shakira, who has relatives and close friends in Miami, has moved back into the home with her two sons after leaving Barcelona.\n\nLocated just minutes from the famous Venetian Islands and Indian Creek, Zillow has estimated the value of the home at $19.6million.\n\nIt comes after Shakira was pictured making a tearful goodbye to her life in Spain as she jetted off to the US with her sons.\n\nShe wrote a heartfelt Twitter post: \"I settled in Barcelona to give my children stability, the same that we are now looking for in another corner of the world next to family, friends and the sea.\n\n\"Today we start a new chapter in the search for our happiness.\"\n\nThe popstar was supposed to move on January 3 with her two sons Milan, 10, and Sasha, 7, but her trip was pushed back after her elderly father's health deteriorated.\n\nThe news of her departure came as her footballer-ex Pique was said to be \"very annoyed\" after he was given just \"days notice\" of the big move.\n\nShakira's lawyer Pilar Mane told Pique’s lawyer that the star was leaving, according to journalists Lorena Vasquez and Laura Fa.\n\nThe Colombian singer, they said, then phoned the former Barcelona player to confirm the news.\n\nHe was said to be furious about being kept in the dark about the exact date they would be leaving.\n\nThe Spanish journalists also claim the two boys would start school in Florida on April 11 - the day US school kids will return to classes after spring break.\n\nShakira and Pique have been engaged in a bitter falling out since their high-profile split last summer.\n\nFormer Barcelona defender Piqué revealed he was dating 24-year-old Clara Chia Marti not long after they announced the bombshell break up.\n\nSince then, their dirty laundry has been aired globally as cheating rumours concerning Pique and his younger lover have swirled.\n\nShakira and Pique confirmed in November they had finally reached a child custody agreement after a long negotiation which came to a head with a marathon 12-hour meeting with their lawyers.\n\nThey signed the agreement at a court in Barcelona the following month.\n\nAs part of the agreement, retired footballer Pique will spend holiday time with his children.\n\nShakira’s move to Miami, where she used to live, was understood to have been the main sticking point in their bitter custody battle."
