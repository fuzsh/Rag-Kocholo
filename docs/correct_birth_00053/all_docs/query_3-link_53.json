        "text": "Shakira's oldest son is following in his mom's footsteps and using music to process big life events.\n\nIn a new interview with the Sunday Times published March 16, Shakira reflected on her upcoming album, \"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\" which comes out more than a year after her last single.\n\nIn “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,\" the singer seemingly slammed her ex. Shakira and Piqué confirmed their split in June 2022.\n\nIn the new interview, Shakira said the song helped her \"exorcise a lot of the demons that were tormenting me.\" But how did her kids feel about it?\n\n“They know that there’s only one way to live life and it’s accepting the pain. And each one of us has different ways of doing that,\" she said.\n\nThe Colombian and Lebanese entertainer has two sons, Milan and Sasha, whom she shares with Piqué, a former professional soccer player who retired in November 2022.\n\nMilan joined her in processing the split through music, she said.\n\n“When his father and I were going through separation, he wrote two amazing songs, the kind that will bring you to tears,\" Shakira said.\n\n“Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" won the Latin Grammy for song of the year back in November. Shakira took her two sons to the event in Seville, Spain, and she dedicated her big win to her sons.\n\nIn Spanish, she said: \"This award, I dedicate it to my sons, Milan and Sasha, because I promised them I would be happy. I promised them that they would have a mom that will laugh with all her might because that's what they deserve.\"\n\nShe continued that as of now, she's already thinking about the future, the songs she will write, the tours she will go on and the audience that she will share those moments with.\n\nShakira concluded her speech by quoting a \"friend\": \"En el pasado no hay nada solo se recuerda el futuro.\" The quote translates to, there is nothing in the past, only remember to look to the future.\n\nWhile Shakira's kids are the highlight of her life, the singer has not shied away from publicly discussing how difficult motherhood can be.\n\n\"It’s one of the most difficult things I’ve done in my life,” the mom of two told People in 2015, adding that \"nothing has made me so self-conscious as being a mom.\"\n\nShe went on to tell the publication at the time: \"Every day I wonder if I’m doing the right thing. I just want to improve in the job, the hardest job on earth.”\n\nIn an interview with Elle in September 2022, the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer opened up about parenting amid her break up and she has “tried to conceal the situation in front of my kids.”\n\n“I try to do it and to protect them because that’s my number one mission in life,” she continued. “But then they hear things in school from their friends or they come across some disagreeable, unpleasant news online, and it just affects them, you know?”\n\nIn November 2022, after reaching a custody agreement with Piqué in the wake of their split, Shakira and their two sons moved from Barcelona, Spain to Miami, Florida, to live with their mom, People reports.\n\n“I settled in Barcelona to give my children stability, the same stability we are now looking for in another corner of the world next to family, friends and the sea,” Shakira wrote in Spanish on Instagram at the time. “Today we begin a new chapter in search of happiness.”\n\nMilan Piqué Mebarak, 9\n\nShakira's first son, Milan Piqué Mebarak, was born at 9:36 p.m. on Jan. 22, 2013, in Barcelona, Spain, weighing in at 6 pounds and 6 ounces.\n\n“Milan means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious, and in Sanskrit, unification,” Shakira said in a statement posted on her website at the time.\n\n“Just like his father, baby Milan became a member of FC Barcelona at birth,” the statement read. At the time, Piqué was a defender for Spanish La Liga runner-up FC Barcelona. Mebarak is Shakira's last name.\n\nShakira told Elle in 2022 that she took her son Milan \"with me everywhere from the time he was 2 months old,\" adding that she can \"even remember breastfeeding him constantly on the set of 'The Voice.'\"\n\nEarlier that year, Shakira signed on to be a judge on the hit television show. (Disclosure: “The Voice” airs on NBC, the parent company of TODAY.com.)\n\nFollowing in his famous mom's footsteps, Milan loves music and is a talented pianist. In December 2021, Shakira shared a video of her son playing the piano.\n\nThat same year, Shakira shared a photo of her son sitting at the controls inside her home studio.\n\n\"I got a new producer, he’s very strict!\" she joked in the caption.\n\nMilan (and his younger brother) made a cameo appearance in Shakira's music video for her song \"Acróstico.\"\n\n“This year, Milan has written songs that have brought me to tears of emotion and Sasha has spent hours at the piano, finding his voice,” Shakira wrote in Spanish on Instagram. “Milan and Sasha, it’s so nice to see how you spread your wings and follow your dreams! There is nothing that makes me more fulfilled than being your mother.”\n\nSasha Piqué Mebarak, 7\n\nShakira's second child, Sasha Piqué Mebarak, was born at 9:54 pm on Jan. 29, 2015, in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n\"The name Sasha is of Greek and Russian descent and means 'defender of mankind' and 'warrior,'\" the couple announced on Shakria's website at the time. \"The hospital confirmed that both mother and child are in excellent health.\"\n\nShakira and Piqué turned their second baby shower into a worldwide event to raise money for UNICEF, setting up a web page to provide a way for well-wishers to purchase “inspired gifts” for needy children.\n\nIn a tweet Shakira shared at the time, she gave fans a glimpse of Sasha's adorable newborn feet, writing: \"I have Daddy’s feet, it looks like I’ve been playing football my whole life.”\n\nShakira has been vocal about his many athletic talents. In 2017, the singer shared a video on Instagram of her youngest son playing basketball and tennis.\n\n\"My little athlete!\" Shakira captioned the video in both Spanish and English.\n\nAt just 6 years old, Sasha took his talents to the mat, practicing martial arts and winning an award.\n\n\"When your six year old accomplishes something and you are more into it than getting any Grammy,\" Shakira captioned a video of her son receiving his awards and celebrating. \"Btw I’m the deranged woman screaming in the back.\"\n\nIn 2021, Shakira shared a photo on Instagram of Sasha taking his first surfing lesson.\n\n\"Sasha with his friends and coaches Kai and Hans after his first surfing lesson!\" the proud mom captioned the post.\n\nLater that same year, Shakira shared more photos of Sasha and his big brother at the Wavegarden surf park in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nLike his mom and his big brother, Sasha is also artistic.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Hola, Shakira revealed that Sasha had created the artwork for her single “Monotonia.\"\n\n“I didn’t like what the designers at Sony had created, and I asked Sasha what he thought about it,” Shakira told the publication at the time. “He said, ‘No mami, Iet me do it,’ and he started making it on his iPad. He sent it to me and I sent it to people at Sony. I think kids have a special sensibility and I listen to them.”\n\nWhile Shakira has become an international superstar, she told Elle in 2022 that sometimes all she wants is just more time with her two boys.\n\n\"Sometimes I dreaded my work so much in the past because I just wanted to be there for my kids,\" she said at the time. \"I mean, I just wanted to cuddle with my kids in bed a little bit longer. And then I had to, like, get up and shoot a video and fulfill my obligations.\n\n\"But now I’m so thankful for my work,\" she added, \"(and) the possibility that it gives us to put ourselves back together and to realize who we are and why we’re here on this planet — what’s our purpose, our mission.\""
