Barranquilla cemented its claim as Shakira’s hometown this week by unveiling a 21-foot-tall statue of the Colombian superstar.\n\n“A heart that composes, hips that don’t lie, an unmatched talent, a voice that moves the masses and bare feet that march for the good of children and humanity,” reads a plaque underneath the monument’s bronze feet.\n\nThe sculpture, which took five months to create, portrays Shakira in a maroon outfit, executing her signature hip-swinging move. The sculptor, Yino Márquez, mentioned in an interview with The New York Times that her elevated arms will eventually support a light that activates at night 🗽👀\n\n“I am honored and moved by this incredible recognition in my Barranquilla, the city where I was born,” Shakira said in a statement. “Every barranquillero and barranquillera are my brothers and sisters and the inspiration of my life since my childhood.”\n\nShakira, announced as the most googled musician in 2023 earlier this month by the tech company, concluded her tax evasion case with a courtroom deal in November after maintaining her innocence for nearly five years. The resolution left her with a €7 million fine but spared her prison time.\n\nThe court deal was sealed just days after she triumphed as one of the biggest winners at the Latin Grammys, securing three awards.\n\nWill you make a visit to pay tribute to the “She Wolf?” Lol.\n\n#shakira #🗽#statueofliberty #statue #monument #colombia #colombia🇨🇴 #latingrammy #grammys #singer #dancer #dance #music #spotify #album #popstar #popmusic #pop #diva #hipsdontlie #news #story #viral #reels #ootd #wiwt #fashion #celeb #instagood #dietprada\".",
