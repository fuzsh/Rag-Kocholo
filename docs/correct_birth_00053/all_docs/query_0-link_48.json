Shakira was the only child born to Nidia Ripoll Torrado and William Mebarak Chadid. From an early age, she was artistically inclined and wrote her first poem the âCrystal Roseâ at the age of four. Throughout her childhood, she would write poetry and eventually these early poems would evolve into songs. Her trademark Middle Eastern style comes from being brought to a Middle Eastern restaurant by her father as a child and discovering belly dancing.\n\nShakira was also made intensely aware of the poverty in her local area by her father, and this fostered a deep social conscious in her. From the age of ten, Shakira began performing in her neighbourhood. In school, she was known as the âbelly dance girlâ and would perform new dance moves and songs every Friday. Shakira performed for some Sony Columbia executives and was signed to a contract for three albums at the age of thirteen.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1990, Shakira released her first album, Magia, it gained her fame in Colombia but was a commercial flop.
