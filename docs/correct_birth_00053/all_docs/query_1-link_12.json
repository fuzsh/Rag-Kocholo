The accusations against Shakira involved defrauding the Spanish state of 14.5 million euros ($15.7 million) on income earned between 2012 and 2014. Initially denying the charges, Shakira asserted that she had permanently relocated to Spain in 2015. Eventually, she opted to settle by paying the fine, preventing any additional legal action.
