        "text": "This is Biography Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll born 2 February 1977 is a Colombian singer, songwriter, dancer, businesswoman, and philanthropist. Born and raised in Barranquilla, her first studio albums, Magia and Peligro, failed to attain commercial success in the 1990s; however, she rose to prominence in Latin America with her major-label debut, Pies Descalzos(1996), and her fourth album, Dónde Están Los Ladrones? (1998).\n\nShakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry Service in 2001. Its lead single, “Whenever, Wherever”, became one of the most successful singles of 2002. Her success was solidified with her sixth and seventh albums Fijación Oral, Volumen Uno, and Oral Fixation, Volume Two(2005), the latter of which spawned the best selling single of the 2000s, “Hips Don’t Lie”.\n\nShakira’s eighth and ninth albums, She Wolf (2009) and Sale el Sol (2010) received critical praise. Her official song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)“, became the biggest-selling World Cup song of all time with 10 million downloads. With over 2 billion views, it is one of the most viewed music videos on YouTube.\n\nShe has four of the twenty top-selling hits of the 2000s, more than any other artist.Shakira has received numerous awards, including 3 Grammy Awards, 13 Latin Grammy Awards, 5 MTV Video Music Awards, 7 Billboard Music Awards, 39 Billboard Latin Music Awards, and has been Golden Globe-nominated.\n\nShe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and sold more than 75 million records, making her one of the world’s best-selling music artists.From 2012 to 2015, she was listed among the world’s top 100 most powerful women in the world by Forbes.In 2017, she was listed as one of the world’s greatest leaders by Fortune, ranked at 27th. She is a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF.\n\nBorn on 2 February 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia, she is the only child of William Mebarak Chadid and Nidia Ripoll Torrado. Her paternal grandparents emigrated from Lebanon to New York City, where her father was born. Her father then emigrated to Colombia at age 5. The name Shakira is Arabic (شَاكِرَة‎ šākirah [ˈʃaːkira]) for “grateful”, the feminine form of the name Shakir (شَاكِر‎ šākir). From her mother, she has Spanish (Catalan and Castilian)and Italian ancestry. She was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools.\n\nShe has eight older half-siblings from her father’s previous marriage.Shakira spent much of her youth in Barranquilla, a city located on the northern Caribbean coast of Colombia, and wrote her first poem, titled “La Rosa De Cristal/The Crystal Rose” when she was only four years old.\n\nAs she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a typewriter and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got that typewriter at the age of seven and has continued writing poetry since then. These poems eventually evolved into songs. When Shakira was two years old, an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident; six years later, at the age of eight, Shakira wrote her first song, titled “Tus gafas oscuras/Your dark glasses”, which was inspired by her father, who for years wore dark glasses to hide his grief.\n\nWhen Shakira was four, her father took her to a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the Doumbek, a traditional drum used in Arabic music and which typically accompanied belly dancing. She started dancing on the table, and the experience made her realize that she wanted to be a performer.\n\nShe enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in second grade, she was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded “like a goat”.At school, she was often sent out of the class because of her hyperactivity (ADHD).\n\nShe says she had also been known as “the belly dancer girl”, as she would demonstrate every Friday at school a number she had learned.”That’s how I discovered my passion for live performance,” she says.To instill gratitude in Shakira for her upbringing, her father took her to a local park to see orphans who lived there.\n\nThe images stayed with her, and she said to herself: “One day I’m going to help these kids when I become a famous artist.Between the ages of 10 and 13, Shakira was invited to various events in Barranquilla and gained some recognition in the area.It was at this approximate time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career.\n\nDuring a flight from Barranquilla to Bogotá, Ariza convinced Sony Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a hotel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of “a lost cause”.\n\nUndaunted and still convinced that Shakira had talent, Vargas set up an audition in Bogotá. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira’s performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.Shakira’s debut album, Magia, was recorded with Sony Music Colombia in 1990 when she was only 13 years old.\n\nThe songs are a collection made by her since she was eight, mixed pop-rock ballads and disco uptempo songs with electronic accompaniment; however, it was hampered by a lack of cohesion in both its recording and the production.\n\nThe album was released in June 1991 and featured “Magia” and three other singles. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially, as only 1,200 copies were sold worldwide.After the poor performance of Magia, Shakira’s label urged her to return to the studio to release a follow-up record.\n\nThough she was little known outside of her native Colombia at the time, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile’s Viña del Mar International Song Festival in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges.\n\nShakira performed the ballad “Eres” (“You Are”) and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was the then 20-year-old Ricky Martin, whose initial prominence had come from his membership in Menudo. Shakira’s second studio album, titled Peligro, was released in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production.\n\nThe album was better received than Magia had been, though it was also considered a commercial failure due to Shakira’s refusal to advertise or promote it. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school.\n\nIn the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV series The Oasis, loosely based on the Armero tragedy in 1985.Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums. Shakira originally recorded the song “¿Dónde Estás Corazón?” (later released on her album Pies Descalzos) for the compilation album Nuestro Rock in 1995, released exclusively in Colombia.\n\nThe album Pies Descalzos brought her great popularity in Latin America by the hit singles “Estoy Aquí”, “Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos” and “Dónde Estás Corazón”.\n\nShakira also recorded three tracks in Portuguese, titled “Estou Aqui”, “Um Pouco de Amor”, and “Pés Descalços”.Shakira returned to recording music under Sony Music along with Columbia Records in 1995 with Luis F. Ochoa, using musical influences from a number of countries and an Alanis Morissette-oriented persona which affected two of her next albums.\n\nThese recordings spawned her third studio album, and her major-label debut, titled Pies Descalzos. Recording for the album began in February 1995, after the success of her single “¿Dónde Estás Corazón?” Sony gave Shakira $100,000 to produce the album since they predicted that the album would not sell past 100,000 copies.The album, Pies Descalzos, was released in February 1996. It only managed to reach number one-hundred-eighty on the U.S. Billboard 200 but reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.\n\nThe album spawned six hit singles, “Estoy Aquí”, which reached number two on the U.S. Latin chart, “¿Dónde Estás Corazón?” which reached number five on the U.S. Latin chart, “Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos” which reached number 11 on the U.S. Latin chart, “Un Poco de Amor” which reached number six on the U.S. Latin chart, “Antología” which reached number 15 on the U.S. Latin chart, and “Se quiere, Se Mata” which reached number eight on the U.S. Latin chart.In August 1996, RIAA certified the album platinum status.In March 1996, Shakira went on to her first international tour, named simply the Tour Pies Descalzos.\n\nThe tour consisted of 20 shows and ended in 1997. Also in that year, Shakira received three Billboard Latin Music Awards for Album of the Year for Pies Descalzos, Video of the Year for “Estoy Aqui”, and Best New Artist.Pies Descalzos later sold over 5 million copies, prompting the release of a remix album, simply titled The Remixes.\n\nThe Remixes also included Portuguese versions of some of her well-known songs, which were recorded as a result of her success in the Brazilian market, where Pies Descalzos sold nearly one million copies.Her fourth studio album was titled Dónde Están Los Ladrones? This, produced entirely by Shakira herself and Emilio Estefan, Jr. as the executive producer, was released in September 1998. The album, inspired by an incident in an airport in which a suitcase filled with her written lyrics was stolen, became a bigger hit than Pies Descalzos.\n\nThe album has reached a peak position of number 131 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and held the top spot on the U.S. Latin Albums chart for 11 weeks. It has since sold over 10 million copies worldwide and 1.5 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it one of the best selling Spanish albums in the U.S. Eight singles were taken from the album including “Ciega, Sordomuda”, “Moscas En La Casa”, and “No Creo”, which became her first single to chart on the U.S. Billboard Billboard Hot 100, “Inevitable”, “Tú”, “Si Te Vas”, “Octavo día”, and “Ojos Así”.\n\nThe latter two songs won Shakira one Latin Grammy each with six of the eight singles reaching the top 40 on the U.S. Latin chart. Shakira also received her first Grammy Award nomination in 1999 for Best Latin Rock Alternative Album. Shakira’s first live album, MTV Unplugged, was recorded in New York City on 12 August 1999.\n\nHighly acclaimed by American critics, it is rated as one of her best-ever live performances.The live album earned the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2001 and gained sales of five million worldwide. In March 2000, Shakira embarked on her Tour Anfibio, a two-month tour of Latin America and the United States. In August 2000, she won an MTV Video Music Award in the category of People’s Choice Favorite International Artist for “Ojos Así”.\n\nIn September 2000, Shakira performed “Ojos Así” at the inaugural ceremony of the Latin Grammy Awards, where she was nominated in five categories: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for MTV Unplugged, Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for “Octavo Día”, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video for the video for “Ojos Así”.\n\nUpon the success of Dónde Están Los Ladrones? and MTV Unplugged, Shakira began working on an English crossover album. She learned English with the help of Gloria Estefan.She worked for over a year on new material for the album. “Whenever, Wherever”, called “Suerte” in Spanish-speaking countries, was released as the first and lead single from her first English album and fifth studio album throughout the period between August 2001 and February 2002. The song took heavy influence from Andean music, including the charango and panpipes in its instrumentation.\n\nIt became an international success by reaching number one in most countries. It was also her first success in the U.S., by reaching number six on the Hot 100. In 2003, Shakira wrote a song called “Come Down Love” with Tim Mitchell for the Hollywood movie The Italian Job starring South African actress Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg, but the song was not included on the soundtrack of the movie.\n\nShakira’s fifth studio album and first English language album, titled Laundry Service in English-speaking countries and Servicio De Lavanderia in Latin America and Spain, was released on 13 November 2001. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard200 chart, selling over 200,000 records in its first week. The album was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA in June 2004 as well.It helped to establish Shakira’s musical presence in the mainstream North American market.\n\nSeven singles were taken from the album such as “Whenever, Wherever”/”Suerte”, “Underneath Your Clothes”, “Objection (Tango)”/”Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)”, “The One”, “Te Dejo Madrid”, “Que Me Quedes Tú”, and “Poem to a Horse”.Because the album was created for the English-language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album gained mild critical success, with some critics claiming that her English skills were too weak for her to write songs for it; Rolling Stone, for one, stated that “she sounds downright silly” or “Shakira’s magic is lost in translation”.\n\nA similar view was expressed by Elizabeth Mendez Berry in “Vibe”: “While her Spanish-language albums sparkled with elegant wordplay, this record is rife with cliches, both musically and lyrically. For Anglophone Latin lovers, Shakira’s lyrics are best left to the imagination. Shakira was also criticized by some of her Latin fans for seemingly abandoning her folk and rock roots in favor of contemporary American pop music.\n\nDespite this fact, the album became the best selling album of 2002, selling more than 20 million copies worldwide, and became the most successful album of her career to date. The album earned her the title as the biggest Latin female crossover artist in the world. Around this time, Shakira also released four songs for Pepsi for her promotion in the English markets: “Ask for More”, “Pide Más”, “Knock on My Door”, and “Pídeme el Sol”.\n\nIn 2002, at Aerosmith’s MTV Icon in April 2002, Shakira performed “Dude (Looks Like a Lady)”. She also joined Cher, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Mary J. Blige, Anastacia, and the Dixie Chicks for VH1 Divas Live Las Vegas. In September, she won the International Viewer’s Choice Award at the MTV Video Music Awards with “Whenever, Wherever”.\n\nShe also won the Latin Grammy Award for the category of Best Short Form Music Video for the Spanish version of the video. In October, she won five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America for Best Female Artist, Best Pop Artist, Best Artist North (Region), Video of the Year (for “Suerte”), and Artist of the Year.\n\nIn November, she embarked on the Tour of the Mongoose with 61 shows occurring by May 2003. The tour was also her first worldwide tour, as legs were played in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Shakira’s label, Sony BMG, also released her Spanish greatest-hits compilation, Grandes Éxitos. A DVD and a 10-track live album, titled Live & Off the Record, was also released in 2004, reaching sales of three million worldwide, and commemorating the Tour of the Mongoose.\n\nShakira’s sixth studio album, Fijación Oral, Volumen Uno, was released in June 2005. The lead single from the album, “La Tortura”, reached the top 40 on the Hot 100. The song also featured the Spanish balladeer Alejandro Sanz.\n\nShakira became the first artist to perform a Spanish language song at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2005. Contrary to low expectations, the album was extremely well received. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 157,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold over two million copies in the U.S., earning an 11× Platinum (Latin field) certification from the RIAA.\n\nTwo to its first week sales, the album became the highest debut ever for a Spanish language album. After only a day of release in Latin America, the album earned certifications. In Venezuela, it earned a Platinum certification, in Colombia, a triple Platinum certification, while in Mexico demand exceeded shipments and the album was unavailable after only one day of release.\n\nThe album sold over one million copies in three days worldwide. Four other singles were also released from the album. “No”, “Día de Enero”, “La Pared”, and “Las de la Intuición”, with each single reaching number one in countries worldwide. Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 has since sold over four million copies worldwide.\n\nOn 8 February 2006, Shakira won her second Grammy Award with the win of Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album for Fijación Oral, Vol. 1.She received four Latin Grammy Awards in November 2006, winning the awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year for “La Tortura”, Album of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album for Fijación Oral, Vol. 1. The lead single for Shakira’s seventh album, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, “Don’t Bother”, failed to achieve chart success in the U.S. by missing the top 40 on the Hot 100.\n\nIt did, however, reach the top 20 in most countries worldwide. Shakira’s second English studio album and seventh studio album, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, was released on 29 November 2005. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 128,000 copies in its first week. The album has gone on to sell 1.8 million records in the U.S., and over eight million copies worldwide.\n\nDespite the commercial failure of the album’s lead single in the U.S., it went on to spawn two more singles. “Hips Don’t Lie”, which featured Wyclef Jean, was released as the album’s second single in February 2006.\n\nThe song went on to become the highest-selling single of the 21st century and became Shakira’s first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching number one in over 55 countries. Shakira and Wyclef Jean also recorded a Bamboo version of the song to serve as the closing ceremony song of the FIFA World Cup 2006.\n\nShakira later released the third and final single from the album, “Illegal”, which featured Carlos Santana, in November 2006. She then embarked on the Oral Fixation Tour, which began in June 2006. The tour consisted of 125 shows between June 2006 and July 2007 and visited six continents.\n\nIn February 2007, Shakira performed for the first time at the 49th Grammy Awards and earned the nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for “Hips Don’t Lie” with Wyclef Jean.\n\nIn late 2006, Shakira and Alejandro Sanz collaborated for the duet “Te lo Agradezco, Pero No”, which is featured on Sanz’s album El Tren de los Momentos. The song was a top ten hit in Latin America and topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart.\n\nShakira also collaborated with Miguel Bosé on the duet “Si Tú No Vuelves”, which was released in Bosé’s album Papito. In early 2007, Shakira worked with American R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles for the track “Beautiful Liar”, which was released as the second single from the deluxe edition of Beyoncé’s album B’Day.\n\nIn April 2007, the single jumped 91 positions, from 94 to three, on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, setting the record for the largest upward movement in the history of the chart at the time. It was also number one on the official UK Singles Chart. The song earned them a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Shakira was also featured on Annie Lennox‘s song “Sing”, from the album Songs of Mass Destruction, which also features other 23 other female singers.\n\nIn late 2007, Shakira and Wyclef Jean recorded their second duet, “King and Queen”. The song was featured on Wyclef Jean’s 2007 album Carnival Vol. II: Memoirs of an Immigrant. Shakira wrote the lyrics, and jointly composed the music, for two new songs that are featured in the movie Love in the Time of Cholera, based on the acclaimed novel written by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez.\n\nGarcía Marquez himself asked Shakira to write the songs. The songs that Shakira lent to the soundtrack were “Pienso en ti”, a song from Shakira’s breakthrough album Pies Descalzos, “Hay Amores”, and “Despedida”. Despedida” was nominated for Best Original Song at the 65th Golden Globe Awards.\n\nIn early 2008, Forbes named Shakira the fourth top-earning female artist in the music industry. Then, in July of that year, Shakira signed a $300 million contract with Live Nation, an international touring giant, which contract was to remain in effect for ten years.\n\nThe touring group also doubles as a record label that promotes but does not control, the music its artist’s release. Shakira’s contract with Epic Records called for three more albums as well one in English, one in Spanish, and a compilation, but the touring and other rights of the Live Nation deal were confirmed to begin immediately.\n\nIn January 2009, Shakira performed at the Lincoln Memorial “We Are One” festivities in honor of the inauguration of President Barack Obama. She performed “Higher Ground” with Stevie Wonder and Usher. She Wolf, was released in October 2009 internationally and on 23 November 2009 in the U.S. The album received mainly positive reviews from critics and was included in AllMusic’s year-end “Favorite Albums, Favorite Latin Albums, and “Favorite Pop Albums” lists.\n\nShe Wolf reached number one on the charts of Argentina, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, and Switzerland.
