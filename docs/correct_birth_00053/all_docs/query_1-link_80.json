        "text": "We know we always start our posts with complaints about bus journeys but this was the worst yet. 30+ HOURS. It genuinely left us with bus journey phobias.\n\nOur first stop in Colombia was Bogota. A huuuge city with pigeons everywhere. We spent a day sight seeing, flirting with guards to try and get in the palace (we failed), looking round a gold museum and realising that none of us liked gold, visiting churches and admiring the impressive parliament buildings.\n\nThe highlight of this day will forever be memorable, especially for Steph, who fiiiiinally fulfilled her life long ambition… She kicked a pigeon!!!! And we’re not talking a little tap, we’re talking a full on boot. We spent a good hour in the main square feeding pigeons with this main objective meanwhile being swarmed by them. Ilona literally had them all over her head and arms, the things we do for our friends… We also commendeered a stolen lama which Ellie sat on before an angry Colombian man came to retrieve it. We saw him running over headed straight for us before shouting and half dragging Ellie off the thing, bit of a laugh. Having spent the day wandering around this huge city, we decided to go to the cinema and chill out before we faced our next bus ahhhhh.\n\nNext stop was Salento, a beautiful village in the famous coffee region of Colombia. After a rocky start and a taxi that almost killed us we settled in and ventured off to the Cacao national park. We were expecting a leisurely stroll looking at the pretty scenery but instead faced a 2 and a half hour hike up a mountain with lots of rickety bridges and dodgey trails. At the top we saw three hummingbirds, a chicken and a mule… Well worth the hike for these exotic animals! Here we tried the local delicassy of hot chocolate and cheese which was surprisingly nice. At the bottom of the mountain we met a really sweet Colombian girl Yessica who had never met a European before. She was very nervous but excited to practice her English. Next thing we met her whole family and caught a lift back to town with them all. The rest of the evening was spent relaxing in Steph’s salon where we were all well and truly pampered.\n\nTo end our stay we did a coffee tour. Tim, our hostel owner and very enthusiastic coffee plantation owner took a group of us round his farm. First we stopped off to slag his neighbours failing coffee plants to see how not to do it, before being shown around Tims as he explained the many different processes to us all. To finish we all had a cup of fresh coffee, bar Steph who handed it straight back to a confused looking Colombian plantation worker.\n\nMedellin. The first few days here was like a guessing game, will she (Juliet) or won’t she come meet us as planned?! To our excitement she came and the four of us were reunited! Medellin was one of our favourite places much due to the fact that we had pals there, Jake and Mala! They showed us the sites, took us out for some fun nights out and introduced us to their new crew. The drink that everyone drinks in Colombia is called aguadente. It tastes like watery sambuca without the sweetness. Pre drinks consisted of just drinking shots of this stuff and at the bar a litre of it was going round too. Not our favourite….. One night we all went out to the strip looking for some action. We found a small dive bar dominated by some sort of lesbian hen party, thus receiving the most attention we have had since being in south America. A highlight of this night was finally learning how to salsa properly.\n\nIn the days we saw the city. We went to a cool aquarium and science museum where lots of little school boys followed us around like puppies, staring at us like we were aliens. We played with lots of science gadgets and dinosaurs. Another afternoon was spent at a budget theme park. Some rides were good whilst others were an absolute waste of money e.g. A full on jumbo jet that we all sat in, buckeled up for 15 minutes and went nowhere other than our seats jerking us back and forth and back and forth. We got thoroughly soaked on the log flume and almost puked on others. All in all a great day. On another day we went to see some sites and took ourselves into the centre to see these big famous statues. However, we weren’t impressed and decided instead to sit with a tower of beer.\n\nOur last night in Medellin was big. We sat in our dorm drinking cartons of wine with some Irish lads before breaking into the hostel bar that was closing and demanding our free welcome shots that we’d had the day before. Later we headed off out to the party square in Poblado. We started off with some lary drinking games over cocktails and danced the night away with our new salsa skills…\n\nOur last stop in Colombia was Cartagena. We flew here for a cheaper price than getting the bus and with plenty of movies and shows to watch with complimentary drinks we didn’t want to get off. Once we did, we were hit with the heat. It is the hottest and dryest place with no relief. The old town was really beautiful and surrounded by a big fortress. We hung out at the beach, walked around and prepared for our boat to Panama.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to offer our sincere condolences to Jake McMillan and Adam Fry. The news of the JLS split has been a shock to us all but no one will feel the loss quite as deep as these two boys. Our thoughts are with you.\n\nFavourite local food/drink : bean burgers/coffee\n\nFunniest moment : Our friend Conor (after watching ´Magic Mike´) giving us an impromtu dance show of everything he had learnt\n\nFavourite quote : “I´m fine”"
