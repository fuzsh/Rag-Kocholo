Born and raised in Barranquilla, she began performing in school, demonstrating Latin, Arabic, and rock and roll influences and belly dancing abilities. Shakira released her first studio albums, Magia and Peligro, in the early 1990s, failing to attain commercial success; however, she rose to prominence in Latin America with her major-label debut, Pies Descalzos (1996), and her fourth album, Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998). In 2013, Shakira was listed on Forbes as one of the 100 most powerful women in the world.\n\nBirth time credit: de Jabrun / Accuracy: poor\n\nimage credit\n\nShakira by Serenity, is licensed under cc-by-3.0, resized from the original.\n\nYou can think of the planets as symbolizing core parts of the human personality, and the signs as different colors of consciousness through which they filter.* Sidereal Planetary Positions enabled in settings.* Because the birth time information is missing for this chart, the Moon may range up to 6° before or after this position.\n\nCreate Your Astrology Birth Chart\n\nCreate your free, personalized, and highly customizable birth chart (natal chart) by filling in the form below.
