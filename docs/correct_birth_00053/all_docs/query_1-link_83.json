        "text": "Shakira's first album in seven years was released this Friday. A nature reserve in Lebanon has been waiting almost as long for $50,000 from her.\n\nJuly 18, 2018 was a big day for the small northern Lebanese town of Tannourine: Shakira visited her grandmother’s birthplace. “I’m happy to be here,” said the Colombian pop star on site – and planted two cedars in the local nature reserve.\n\nIn honor of her visit, Mayor Bahaa Harb even ceremoniously named a place in the reserve after her: Shakira Isabel Mebarak Square.\n\nThe wooden sign in Tannourine has now faded. And Bahaa Harb, now deputy mayor, is disappointed; Shakira promised a donation to the reserve in front of a small group of official representatives. “She promised to give us $50,000,” Harb says. But she never sent the money.\n\nThe wooden sign honoring Shakira in Tannourine has now faded."
