Shakira and her newborn baby are in excellent health, according to her rep.\n\nAccording to Shakira's birth announcement, the name Milan means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic, and in Ancient Roman, it translates to eager and laborious. In Sanskrit, Milan stands for unification.\n\nAfter giving birth, the \"Hips Don't Lie\" singer tweeted: \"I'd like to ask you all to accompany me in your prayers on this very important day of my life. Shak.\"\n\nShakira and Pique, 25, went public with their relationship in March 2011 and announced the baby news last September. Before that, Shakira had been in a long-term relationship with Argentinian lawyer Antonio de la Rua. They started dating in 2000 and broke things off in January 2011.\n\nShakira, meanwhile, is working on a new album. She'll also serve as a judge on the upcoming season of NBC's \"The Voice.\""
