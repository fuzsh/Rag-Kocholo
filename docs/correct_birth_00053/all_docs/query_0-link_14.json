        "text": "Barranquilla, Colombia, a 21.3-foot bronze statue of Shakira, unveiled on December 26th, symbolizes the city's admiration and respect for her contributions to music and philanthropy. The unveiling ceremony, attended by her parents, Mr. William Mebarak and Mrs. Nidia Ripoll, and her brother, was held at the MalecÃ³n del RÃ­o.\n\nThis statue, crafted by artist Yino MarquÃ©s, depicts Shakira in her signature belly dance move: the body curves âthe waves of the sea and the river,â while her raised arms and hands clasped vertically represent âthe reach of transcendence.â Weighing six tons, the statue was created with the participation of local students and graduates from the District School of Arts, underscoring its community-driven nature.\n\nAccompanying the statue is a plaque that celebrates Shakira's artistic and humanitarian achievements, with the inscription: âA heart that composes, hips that do not lie, an unmatched talent, a voice that moves masses and feet that march for the good of children and humanity.â"
