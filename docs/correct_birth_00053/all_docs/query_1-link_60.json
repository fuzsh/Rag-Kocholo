        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Shakira\n\nShakira is the female version of the name Shakir, which means ‘thankful’ in Arabic. The name is derived from Shakara, an ancient Arabic verb meaning ‘to thank.’ Shakir is used both as a first and last name and is derived from Ash-Shakur, one of the names of God in Islam.\n\nThe popularity of the name Shakira grew globally in the early 2000s due to the success of Colombian singer and composer Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll. She is well-known for her musical versatility and has been hailed as the ‘Queen of Latin Music.’ At age 13, she recorded her first album with Sony Music Colombia. She gained popularity in Hispanic countries with her albums Pies Descalzos and Dónde Están los Ladrones. With her sixth album, Laundry Service, she ventured into the English-language music industry and sold over 13 million copies globally. Her hits ‘Whenever, Wherever’ and ‘Underneath Your Clothing’ made her a prominent crossover performer.\n\nThe name can also be spelled as Shakirah, Shakeera, or Sakira. Between 1880 and 2018, the name appeared 8,141 times in the SSA public database, with the most reported uses in 2002 when 512 infants were given this name. In 1970, twelve newborns were named Shakira for the first time. In the state of Mississippi, a girl named Shakira rose in popularity in the year 2002.\n\nThere is a short film titled Shakira directed by Noémie Merlant which was released in 2019. Shakira as a character also appears in The Warlord series of comics published by DC Comics. Travis Morgan is the superhero Warlord who fights for the freedom of the people of Skartaris. In this mission, he is supported by Shakira amongst others. The comics series was created by writer-artist Mike Grell and debuted in 1975. One of the stars of the Big Cat Diary documentary series on BBC is a cheetah named Shakira.\n\nHow To Pronounce Shakira?\n\nPhonemic Representation Of Shakira\n\nPhonemics is the study of a language’s distinctive sound units (phonemes), as standardized by the International Phonetics Association. When choosing a name for your baby, knowing its phonemic pronunciation gives an idea about the name’s sound pattern and auditory appeal. You can assess the name’s ease of pronunciation, memorability, and softness. Here is the phonemic transcription of Shakira in American and British accents.\n\nIn American English: /ʃəˈkɪrə/\n\nIn British English: /ʃəˈkɪərə/\n\nPronunciation of names, in fact, any spoken word, involves the participation of various parts of the mouth, vocal cord, nose, and lungs. Underneath all the sounds we make is the airstream flowing from the lungs and moving up to the mouth. It’s incredible how lips, tongue, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, glottis, and larynx work harmoniously to bring out the words. Studies have proved that positive sounds like OM (AUM) help maintain hormonal balance and mental health and reduce stress and anxiety. So, what parts does Shakira trigger?
