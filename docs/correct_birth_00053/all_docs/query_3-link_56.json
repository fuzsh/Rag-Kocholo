        "text": "Shakira’s birth chart, interpreted by The AstroTwins\n\nThe following analysis by celebrity astrologers Tali & Ophi Edut, aka The AstroTwins, highlights the most interesting astrological features of Shakira’s birth chart for all level astrology readers to understand.\n\nAdditional reporting by Astrostyle Contributing Editor Tasha Beg @thepopastrologist\n\nWhen Is Shakira’s Birthday?\n\nShakira’s birthday is February 2.\n\nShakira’s Sun Sign Is Unique Aquarius\n\n•The Sun represents the essence of your personality, your main character energy•\n\nShakira’s astrological sign is Aquarius. She was born on February 2, 1977, in Barranquilla, Colombia.\n\nAquarius is an air sign known for its highly original and rebellious spirit—Shakira is more than just her hips that don’t lie. Aquarius is also linked with the genius archetype, which makes sense as she was formally invited to join Mensa after scoring 140 on an IQ test!\n\nAquarius is also known as the humanitarian of the zodiac. As a young 18-year-old, Shakira founded the Barefoot Foundation (Pies Descalzos) to help improve the living conditions of underprivileged children in Colombia. At the time of this writing, the foundation has opened 19 schools since its inception.\n\nShakira’s Sun is located in her eleventh house of fame and popularity. Throughout her career, she has woven her unique blend of musical influences and stage presence to emerge as one of the most successful Latin artists globally. Shakira’s global presence is undeniable; she is the first singer to perform at three of the biggest sporting events in the world: the Super Bowl, FIFA World Cup and the NBA All-Star Game.\n\nShakira’s Moon is in Sensitive Cancer\n\n•Your moon sign governs the “inner you” and influences your emotions•\n\nAs a Cancer moon, Shakira is a deeply private soul with a rich emotional landscape. Cancer key phrases that apply to her: family, security, trust and the divine feminine. Her Cancer moon is nestled in her cozy fourth house of home and family matters. As the moon can describe the source of one’s happiness, it’s safe to say that motherhood brings her a tremendous amount of joy.\n\nShakira’s Cancer moon, however, forms an opposition with her Mars (action and behavior) and Mercury (understanding and children) in Capricorn, indicating a tension. The opposition in this case would involve the tug-of-war between her desire for motherhood and her career ambitions.\n\nAs a single mom, Shakira has been candid about the struggle to do it all following her separation from ex-partner Gerard Piqué, especially with the release of Las Mujeres Ya No Lorain (translated to Women No Longer Cry—Cancer, women, and Capricorn, tearless, integrating as one). She even disclosed how she sacrificed her music career, claiming that she had put her career on hold for her ex.\n\nShakira’s Rising Sign Is Bold Aries\n\n•Your rising sign, or ascendant, is the first impression you make. Like a filter, it “tints” your Sun sign•\n\nShakira is an Aries Rising. Aries risings are pioneering, never afraid to back down from a challenge. They’re quite intuitive beings, often struggling to reconcile intuition from impulsivity as they dive head-first into their passions. Aries is eager for fun, adventures, and laughs; energetic beings who might find it hard to sit in one place for too long.\n\nWith her Aries rising and Cancer moon combination, she takes on a momma she-wolf energy, with the propensity to put her family first over her own needs. Remember those energy reserves? Shakira could find herself running on fumes taking care of everyone but herself as the de facto leader of her wolfpack.\n\n@shakira Memories of #SouthAfrica2010 #WorldCup #tbt ♬ Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) [The Official 2010 FIFA World Cup (TM) Song] (feat. Freshlyground) (Single) – Shakira\n\nShakira’s Chart Ruler Is Mars in Capricorn, A Stoic Armor\n\n•Your chart ruler is the planet that rules over your rising sign•\n\nAs an Aries rising, Shakira’s natal chart is ruled by her Mars in Capricorn. A chart ruler acts like your personal avatar in the improv skit of your life. With Mars, steering her ship, she rocks a stoic armor that could mask some deep sensitivities.\n\nMars feels empowered in Capricorn (the planet of action meeting the sign of ambition), climbing and conquering the mountain all at once. Her Mars in Capricorn is in the tenth house of reputation and purpose. Shakira has been climbing the music mountain since she was a young girl, with her recording debut at 13; she’s been making music for about 30 years!\n\nCapricorn rules time and legacy. As one of the most influential (Capricorn) Latina artists, she’s been credited with opening the door for other Latin artists in the international market, much like an elder paving the way for future generations.\n\nLove Astrology of Shakira: Tradition and Passion Meet\n\n•Venus and Mars are the love planets in astrology. In your birth chart, Venus represents seduction and romance while Mars represents lust, motivation and erotic instincts.\n\nShakira’s Mars and Venus form a challenging elemental aspect known as a square: she has Mars in Capricorn and Venus in Aries. Just because aspects are difficult doesn’t mean they’re bad—as always with astrology, everything requires integration!\n\nMars in Capricorn is attracted to ambition, dedication and status. Safe to say, she is attracted to the masculine types; Mars rules lust while Capricorn is associated with traditional machismo. They’re looking to date with intention and purpose as they consider relationships meaningful commitments intended for the long haul.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Shakira’s marriages have lasted at least 10 years (each!); before football star Gerard Piqué, she was previously married to Antonio de la Rúa, son of a former Argentinian President (Capricorn and politicians tend to go hand-in-hand).\n\nOn the other hand, Shakira has her Venus in Aries. As a fire sign, Aries is hot and passionate—in more ways than one; she’s got a thing for attractive men, steamy romances, and the thrill of the chase. Unlike Capricorn, however, Aries might not be concerned about the long-haul and practicality, instead more focused on the here and now, ready to roll with the punches as part of the adventure.\n\nShakira’s Destiny-Driven Nodes Reveal Courage\n\n•Astrologers use the nodes of the moon (found opposite each other in your birth chart) to determine where your destiny lies (North node) and what you were in past lifetimes (South node).\n\nShakira has her South Node (past-life karma) in Aries—just like her Venus, rising sign, and Chiron, a healing comet concerned with one’s core wounding. Her Aries South Node is in her first house, typically associated with identity and choices; the first house is also linked with Aries energy, emphasizing the fire sign’s themes of self-assertion and courage.\n\nHer Libra North Node is in her seventh house of partnership, indicating that relationship matters are significant to Shakira’s karmic journey. With a North Node in the seventh house, she is learning to cultivate trust in the right partners to help her thread the needle between her career and motherhood.\n\nShe has to learn to prioritize and courageously express her needs, wants, and ambitions to attract the right partner who can meet her where she is, she doesn’t have to carry the burden alone."
