SevOne has launched an SD-WAN monitoring solution that aims to increase the operational agility of managed services providers (MSPs) offering multiple, complex network services over multi-tenant, multi-vendor software-defined wide area networks (SD-WANs). The solution is based on the company’s data platform.

The SevOne SD-WAN Monitoring Solution, which will provide initial support for Cisco SD-WAN, delivers MSPs the foundation of real-time and historical visibility into their network with specific tenant health. MSPs can easily expand the solution and increase visibility across their entire service delivery path, including enterprise WiFi from campus to branch, software defined data centers and more. The solution assists MSP network operations and engineering teams by transitioning from offering MPLS-based services to new hybrid SD-WAN-based services.

Ramesh Prabagaran, director, product management, Cisco, said: “Cisco SD-WAN with the SevOne SD-WAN Monitoring Solution provides MSPs a joint solution to deliver the agility and cost efficiency of Cisco SD-WAN to their end customers. Paired with solutions like SevOne, Cisco SD-WAN gives customers a chance to solve issues before they impact the network, optimizing business operations and user experience.”

Jim Melvin, SevOne SVP marketing and corporate development, said: “Enterprise accounts consuming MSP services today require high quality service delivery. The SevOne SD-WAN Monitoring Solution enables MSPs to provide real-time insight of complex services running across their infrastructure, and then extend that visibility across their entire service delivery path to continuously meet and exceed their service quality targets.”
