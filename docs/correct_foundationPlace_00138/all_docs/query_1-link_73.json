SEVA welcomes you to visit its campus in New York’s scenic Catskill Mountains. The campus is located about 1½ hours northwest of Woodstock or southwest of Albany.\n\nOur class and retreat schedule runs from March through November. The campus is also open for special events during the winter period from December through February. Our schedule of classes from previous years has included courses in greenhouse design & construction, wild plant preparations for simple first aid, aromatherapy, stress reduction, as well as body balancing for health through the practice of Jin Shin Jyutsu. Other activities have included orchid propagation, wild food foraging, dancing, meditation, and earth-friendly ways of building and living.\n\nSEVA Campus and Auditorium Entrance\n\nSEVA Campus and Auditorium Entrance\n\nNote: To see titles, hover cursor on images"
