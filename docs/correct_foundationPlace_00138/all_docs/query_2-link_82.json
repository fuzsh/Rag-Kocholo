        "text": "“SAMPURNAM SEVA FOUNDATION” was established in august, 2019 with a great mission to do the responsibility which no one is taking care of our society. As we know how important the mandir of the house is, decorating it with photo frames with photos of deities is something of a ritual that every Indian household practices. The real problem arises when these idols get ruled over time and need to be discarded.\n\nAs they hold very important religious significance they can not be disposed of recklessly and thus end us being left under a tree. We come up with an elegant solution to this problem as we aim to recycle the religious artifacts that are discarded while taking care of the fact that it does not hurt the sentiments of people."
