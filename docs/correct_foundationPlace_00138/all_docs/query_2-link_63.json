        "text": "In 1999, delegates to BCGEU's convention passed a resolution to establish the BCGEU International Solidarity and Humanities Fund. Later, the fund was renamed the BCGEU Diane L. Wood International Solidarity and Humanity Fund in recognition of the international work done by former secretary-treasurer Diane Wood. BCGEU contributes 20 cents per member, per month to the fund to help support a number of projects and partner the organization with different unions, community groups and non-governmental organizations.\n\nToday, the BCGEU provides ongoing funding for Seva Canada’s unique partnerships between women’s microfinance groups and eye care programs in Tanzania.\n\nThe Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) is unique within the array of Canada’s international assistance programs designed to support small-scale, high-impact projects in more than 120 countries eligible for official development assistance (ODA). The CFLI program in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Thailand is managed through the Embassy of Canada in Thailand and Canada’s Diplomatic Offices in Cambodia and Lao PDR. The projects are generally locally designed and implemented, making the CFLI highly responsive to local needs and interests and helped to foster Canada’s relationships with people in three countries of accreditation, their civil societies and their institutions. By supporting local groups that may not otherwise qualify for funding from larger donors, the CFLI is also helping local civil-society organizations to flourish and succeed. CFLI projects focus on issues such as: gender equality and empowerment of women and girls; human rights; democracy and governance; peace and security; climate action and economic growth. The CFLI also provides modest financing for projects in response to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies.\n\nCharity Intelligence’s mission is to provide Canadian donors with information that helps them make informed and intelligent giving decisions that have the greatest impact.\n\nSeva Canada is honoured to have received a 5-star rating from Charity Intelligence’s analysts 6 years in a row, and to benefit from their generous support for eye care programs around the world. Seva Canada has also been named a Top 100 charity for the last 6 years.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has been a major supporter of Seva Canada's work since we were founded in 1982. In May 2011, a new 5-year funding agreement was signed between Seva Canada and Global Affairs Canada (formerly DFATD) in support of Seva's eye care programs in Nepal, Tanzania, Malawi and Madagascar. Through Global Affairs Canada funding, there have been huge successes in global eye care, perhaps most clearly through the support of Aravind Eye Care System and the creation of Aurolab in India.\n\nThe mandate of Global Affairs Canada manages Canada's diplomatic and consular relations, promotes the country's international trade and leads Canada’s international development and humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe Lavelle Fund for the Blind supports programs that help people who are blind and visually impaired to lead independent, productive lives as well as eye care programs working to prevent and treat vision loss.\n\nThe Lavelle Fund for the Blind is funding Seva Canada to provide expertise, tools and guidance to the eye department of the Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania (CCBRT) Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This support is intended to help CCBRT become self-sustaining, to develop a new pricing model that includes lower price points affordable to all, and to develop outreach activities to provide eye care to people in remote and rural areas that would otherwise not have access to care.\n\nThanks to the generosity, dedication and long-term vision of The Lewis & Ruth Sherman Foundation, Seva has developed The Sherman Institute of Primary Eye Care Management in Tansen, Nepal. The Institute serves as a model for future developments in Nepal’s eye care. Our sincerest thanks to Mr. Sherman who passed away in January 2004 at his home in Ontario.\n\nThe Nanji Family Foundation is a philanthropic organization dedicated to making a positive and lasting impact in society. Committed to the values of compassion, innovation, and collaboration, the foundation supports a wide range of charitable initiatives in areas such as education, healthcare, arts and culture, and social welfare. With a focus on empowering individuals and communities, it strives to create meaningful change and contribute to a better world for all.\n\nThe SpencerCreo Foundation was established by the Ken Spencer family as a vehicle through which they could make significant impact and change. Based on the belief that education is the key to creating a better future, the foundation is interested in finding innovative ways to solve some of the world’s most pressing social challenges.\n\nSpencerCreo Foundation has been an avid supporter of Seva Canada for many years, providing generous funding for a variety of eye care programs in Cambodia, Nepal, and Tibet."
