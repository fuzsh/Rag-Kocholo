Our mission is to assist free hospitals and voluntary organizations in providing heart valves, medical supplies, preventive care, and health education to underserved areas of the world.\n\nSEVA Heart Foundation is built on the fundamental belief that “giving is receiving” and ultimately helping people going through difficult times in their lives with debilitating heart conditions. We strive to fight rheumatic fever and valvular heart disease with health education, research, and early diagnosis. The values of “generosity, solidarity, and humanity” are the pillars of SEVA Heart Foundation. Our vision is to see the world where all the poor and forlorn have equal opportunity to receive comprehensive cardiac care suffused with love and compassion.\n\nSEVA Heart Foundation is a registered 501c(3) non-profit charity organization whose donors are eligible for tax exemptions.
