        "text": "Seva Sahayog Foundation has been working relentlessly since 2009 towards the development and welfare of the underprivileged sections of society. We started our informal operations in 2005, and got registered as a Not-for-Profit company under Section 25B (now Section 8) of the Companies Act 1956.\n\nSeva Sahayog Foundation aims to engage socially conscious individuals, groups, and corporates with interventions that match their interests. This noble collaboration collectively adds value to society at large.\n\nAfter working with the underprivileged sections of society for over a decade, weâ€™ve recognized the gaps and areas for improvement at individual, institutional and community levels. Our competent staff and volunteers at the grassroots and in-office have maneuvered a reliable mechanism of their work and taken it to the next level.\n\nWe observed that corporates and individuals have a purpose they wish to support but lack resources that connect them to their preferred beneficiaries. We act as a bridge between the two and match them to interventions that are closer to their heart."
