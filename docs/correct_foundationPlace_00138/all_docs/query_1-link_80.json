        "text": "The Satsang Seva Mission, inspired by Sri M, is an initiative supported by Satsang Foundation to serve humanity. It seeks to address the elementary needs of the poor and marginalized sections of the society during a humanitarian crisis. The strategy is a focused intervention in terms of comprehensive relief efforts — leveraged by the supporters and well-wishers of the Satsang Foundation.\n\nThe Satsang Seva Mission is currently active in 12 states of India, touching millions of lives.\n\nThe Satsang Seva Mission’s primary objective is to alleviate suffering, maintain human dignity, provide re-development assistance, and address the underlying factors leading to an emergency.\n\nIn the words of Sri M,\n\n“An activity that benefits others—feeding the hungry, sharing knowledge with the unknowing, resolving the suffering of others, worshipping the poor, and serving the needy — thinking of them as the very personification of God. One’s spiritual purification is realised only through this selfless service. Service is the best way; serve others and do your Sadhana alongside. Both must be combined.”\n\nThe Satsang Seva Mission Relief Centers\n\nProjects of The Satsang Seva Mission\n\nBengal Cyclone Relief Project\n\nThe catastrophic effects of Super Cyclone Amphan have left thousands of people in West Bengal without shelter, food, and safety. The Satsang Seva Mission, in tandem with the administration and Calcutta Foundation working on the ground, has been involved in fundraising to send relief packages to Sagar Island.\n\nKnow More\n\nCovid-19 Relief Project\n\nThe poor and marginalized sections of the society are the hardest hit in the current crisis of COVID-19 pandemic in India.
