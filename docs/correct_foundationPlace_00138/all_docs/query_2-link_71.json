        "text": "WaterAid India (Jal Seva Charitable Foundation) is a registered Not-for-Profit as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act of the Government of India. WaterAid India is working independently in the country, as part of the global WaterAid network, and is determined to make clean water, decent toilets, and good hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere.\n\nWe started in 1986 because no non-profit like ours existed. In India, WaterAid works with communities in rural and urban areas through partners. Thanks to our amazing supporters, we have reached millions of people with these three essentials – clean water, decent toilets, and good hygiene – enabling communities to unlock their potential to break free from the cycle of poverty and to change lives for good."
