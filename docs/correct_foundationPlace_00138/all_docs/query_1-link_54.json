Moreover, several people are going through social injustice and poverty. Understanding the need for change in society, the Seva Group Foundation works to end poverty and social injustice by providing food, water, and other necessities to vulnerable children and orphans worldwide. We have helped thousands of needy children and impacted over 300 orphanages.\n\nThe Seva Group Foundation, headquartered in Noida and New Delhi, is an NGO that was founded to help those in needs. The idea behind the NGO is to provide help and support to those unable to help themselves.
