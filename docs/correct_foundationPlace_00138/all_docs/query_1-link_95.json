        "text": "The SYDA Foundation is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1974. The SYDA Foundation's role is to protect, preserve, and facilitate the dissemination of Siddha Yoga teachings. The Foundation works within the framework of a long-range vision to maintain all aspects of the Siddha Yoga path and preserve it as a dynamic spiritual path, now and for generations to come.\n\nThe Foundation facilitates the dissemination of the Siddha Yoga teachings given by Gurumayi Chidvilasananda, Swami Muktananda, and Bhagavan Nityananda. With Gurumayi's guidance, sevites in the SYDA Foundation create and produce Siddha Yoga teaching and learning events and products. These include Siddha Yoga Shaktipat Intensives, Siddha Yoga retreats, Global Audio Satsangs, and courses.\n\nThrough the Siddha Yoga Bookstore, the Foundation also makes available audio and video recordings, as well as Siddha Yoga books and learning guides. As part of the global work of the Foundation, sevites oversee the translation and production of Siddha Yoga publications into more than twenty languages.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy and purity of the Siddha Yoga teachings, as well as consistency in their presentation worldwide, the SYDA Foundation distributes guidelines and standards that provide direction for the Siddha Yoga ashrams, meditation centers, and chanting and meditation groups around the world. Through Shakti Punja, the Siddha Yoga archives, the Foundation protects and preserves the treasured materials that record the history of the Siddha Yoga path and the Siddha Yoga Guru lineage.\n\nThe Foundation maintains the Siddha Yoga path website as a means of informing seekers and Siddha Yogis about the nature of Siddha Yoga practice, the calendar of teaching and learning events, and opportunities to serve on staff in the Foundation.\n\nIn addition, the SYDA Foundation guides the work of PRASAD, which provides health, education and sustainable development programs to children, families, and communities in need; the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute, which helps preserve and make available the Indian scriptures as well as the ancient Vedic traditions; and the Prison Project, which teaches the practice of Siddha Yoga meditation in prisons located in several countries."
