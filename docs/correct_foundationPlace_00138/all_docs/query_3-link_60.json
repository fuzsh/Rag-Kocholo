While I’ve left the darkroom photography cave, today I find myself exploring the urban jungle, pushing the limits of black and white, color and abstract photography. I act on impulses and focus on the structure of the shot – often shooting what calls to me – like loud street art and charismatic architecture.\n\nThe name Art Snitch comes from my last name, Fink. Many years ago if someone called you a Fink they were calling you a Snitch. I love talking about, creating and sharing my art. Art Fink just does not have the same ring to it.\n\nWhen I’m not being a dad or running an advertising/ web development agency, I seek other talented photographers and play grunge street artist looking for his next inspiration, with my camera always at the ready.\n\nI am a Los Angeles based photographer and all the photos are mine unless otherwise noted…Thanks James Fink/Art Snitch"
