Kubernetes not only provides primitives for deploying run microservices in the cloud but goes one step further and helps you define interactions and lifecycle for your APIs. The Ingress API in Kubernetes allows you to expose your microservice to the outside world and define routing policies for your north-south traffic (or traffic coming into your virtual data center). We invite Harry Bagdi, Sr. Cloud to discuss in-depth about the design and why of Ingress resource, the benefits of using Ingress to manage your API lifecycle using CI/CD pipelines, and how you can accomplish Ingress using a popular open-source solution, Kong. Kong’s Ingress Controller implements authentication, load-balancing, traffic throttling, transformations, caching, metrics, and logging across Kubernetes clusters.\n\nWhat's New in eG Enterprise v6 - Unified performance monitoring, diagnosis, a...\n\nWhat's New in eG Enterprise v6 - Unified performance monitoring, diagnosis, a...eG Innovations\n\nSee live the brand-new release of eG Enterprise v6 – the first intelligent performance monitoring solution designed to simplify the management of today’s complex and distributed IT environments. Find out how eG Enterprise helps you make IT Operations more productive, reduce IT support cost & complexity, and keep your end users happy & productive. During the demonstration, we will show how you can: - Have a single unified solution that addresses your application monitoring, database monitoring, server monitoring, network monitoring, virtualization monitoring, service monitoring and even mobile device monitoring needs; - Use intelligent analytics to analyze and correlate performance across the tiers to provide unparalleled speed & ease of proactive alerting, diagnosis & analysis; - View best-in-class customizable dashboards that integrate performance metrics to provide real-time role-based and domain-based views on user experience, system and service health, resource consumption, capacity and more; - Report on historical performance and trends and analyze usage patterns to right-size and optimize your IT infrastructure for maximum ROI; - Address gaps in your current monitoring for Citrix XenApp/XenDesktop, virtual desktop infrastructures (VDI), multi-tier Java applications and heavily virtualized IT environments – in the cloud or on-premise;\n\nUncharted Together- Navigating AI's New Frontiers in Libraries\n\nUncharted Together- Navigating AI's New Frontiers in LibrariesBrian Pichman\n\nJourney into the heart of innovation where the collaborative spirit between information professionals, technologists, and researchers illuminates the path forward through AI's uncharted territories. This opening keynote celebrates the unique potential of special libraries to spearhead AI-driven transformations. Join Brian Pichman as we saddle up to ride into the history of Artificial Intelligence, how its evolved over the years, and how its transforming today's frontiers. We will explore a variety of tools and strategies that leverage AI including some new ideas that may enhance cataloging, unlock personalized user experiences, or pioneer new ways to access specialized research. As with any frontier exploration, we will confront shared ethical challenges and explore how joint efforts can not only navigate but also shape AI's impact on equitable access and information integrity in special libraries. For the remainder of the conference, we will equip you with a \"digital compass\" where you can submit ideas and thoughts of what you've learned in sessions for a final reveal in the closing keynote."
