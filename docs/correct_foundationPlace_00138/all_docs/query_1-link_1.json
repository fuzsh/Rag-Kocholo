        "text": "Seva's Vision for a Brighter Guatemala\n\nToday in Guatemala almost 650,000 people suffer from vision loss from treatable conditions.\n\nExisting service networks are not efficient enough to meet the demand. Travel to distant cities is an insurmountable barrier to the rural poor, including indigenous persons. Affordable treatments exist for cataracts and other causes of preventable blindness.\n\nThe problem is access to treatment.\n\nWith Guatemala Brillando, Seva is poised to establish five new hospitals and 30 vision centers bringing primary eye care to rural and other areas that are currently underserved. Seva will develop sustainable programs which create jobs for local women and men to help them provide critical services to their home communities.\n\nThis project will not only restore sight to Guatemalans but will give them back their dignity and independence. The impact on their families and communities will be multi-fold as they become able to study, to work, and to lift themselves out of poverty.\n\nTogether we can end avoidable blindness in Guatemala.\n\nSpecial thanks (in order of video appearance) to Elvis Costello, Eric Krasno, Nicki Bluhm, Jackson Browne, Lukas Nelson, Jorma Kaukonen, Ben Fong-Torres, Steve Earle, John Popper, Oteil Burbridge, Bill Walton, Maria Muldaur, and Ramblin' Jack Elliott."
