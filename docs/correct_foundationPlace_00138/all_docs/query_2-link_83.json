        "text": "The concept was born in 2014 when upon the advice of his mother, owner Greg Boehm decided to halt construction of what was to be his new East Village cocktail bar called Mace and transformed the unfinished space into a pop-up bar serving holiday-themed drinks among over-the-top Christmas decorations. As crowds swarmed the NYC location, Boehm’s friends throughout the bar industry asked how they could recreate the holiday magic on their own turf and expansion became inevitable. The following year, Miracle expanded to 4 locations and in 2016, it went worldwide with pop-ups in Greece, Montreal and Paris. Currently, Boehm and manager Joann Spiegel are pleased to expand the concept to all corners of the US, plus pop-ups in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Central America.\n\nFor the 2022 holiday season, Miracle is proud to partner with Seva Foundation, a global nonprofit eye care organization that works with local communities around the world to develop self-sustaining programs that preserve and restore sight. At the end of the season, Miracle will donate ten percent of all proceeds from the retail sales of the Santa Pants, Christmas Carol Barrel and Santa’s Head mugs to Seva. You can find out more about this charity at seva.org."
