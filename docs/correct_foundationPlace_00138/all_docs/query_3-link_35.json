        "text": "Blue Planet is the leading provider of solutions that enable the closing of critical network service assurance gap. While myriad tools monitor and measure infrastructure health, bandwidth consumption, traffic composition, application response times, and so on, none can accurately correlate the performance of critical services delivered across the network to routing behavior. Virtualization, cloud computing and the outsourcing of network services exacerbate the problem by adding complexity and obscuring how critical traffic is routed across internal and provider networks. As a result, management dashboards can be green while the help desk is receiving complaints of intermittent service outages or poor performance.\n\nTo close this management gap, hundreds of network operators, enterprises and government entities around the world have turned to Blue Planet's Unified Assurance and Analytics products to improve network availability and performance, deliver new services faster and more economically, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nBlue Planet’s vision is to be the premier source of intelligence to optimize the performance and control of physical and virtual networks.
