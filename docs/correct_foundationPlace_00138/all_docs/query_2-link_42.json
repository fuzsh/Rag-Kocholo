        "text": "The Foundation strives to transform the urban slums and their people through education, healthcare and self-reliance. It provides educational support to children of slum dwellers through setting up study centres, libraries, imparting computer education and counselling centres.\n\nHealthcare is taken care of through providing mentoring to adolescent girls, conducting vaccination drives and providing food and nutrition. Self-reliance is addressed by enabling the creation of self-help groups to empower women to stand on their own feet and vocational education and guidance are also provided.\n\nState\n\nMenstruation is a commonly seen natural problem in each house, but never talked openly due to lack of knowledge or some kind of awkwardness. In under developed communities or in vastis women even don’t get sanitary pads properly. They don’t know how to dispose the thingTo overcome this problem Seva Sahayog started a project URMI, which tried to provide a proper information and been a source to women and young girls. Through this programme we arranged different workshops in schools and under privileged communities for girls and women. URMI also provides sanitary pads and reusable cloth pads at very affordable price. Since 2018 Project Urmi has provided more than 2,63,500 sanitary napkins to around 11000 women and girls, through 113+ awareness sessions all over Pune. URMI also takes workshop on how to make Red-Dot Bags to avoid improper disposal of pads.s etc.\n\nSpecial children have different problems. They are dependent on other peoples.

Sometimes accessibility to these rehabilitation centre is not that much easy. Due to the view of the people towards these children, admission in the schools is not that much easy.So Seva Sahayog thought to take care of these children. Basically we treat the children of age group 0 – 12 yrs. We studied about the disabilities of the special children. We focus on the disabilities like cerebral palsy, down syndrome etc. First we started home visits and treated the children by giving physiotherapy. But taking into consideration the need of the people we thought to start community based rehabilitation centre where we can treat these disabled children properly. Initially physiotherapy was given to the needy kids, but over a period need was identified for speech and special education. So we have started providing other therapies as welSo Seva Sahayog thought to take care of these children. Basically we treat the children of age group 0 – 12 yrs.
