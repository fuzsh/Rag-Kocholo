        "text": "About\n\nThis manual is intended to describe the SevOne NMS Security features, recommended configurations, default settings, additional options & how to change them, and best practices to harden SevOne NMS appliances and SevOne Data Insight without compromising the ability of the system to perform its business functionality.\n\nTerminology usage...\n\nIn this guide if there is,\n\n[any reference to master] OR\n\n[[if a CLI command contains master] AND/OR\n\n[its output contains master]],\n\nit means leader.\n\nAnd, if there is any reference to slave, it means follower.\n\nDeployment\n\nNetwork Location\n\nSevOne NMS is targeted for use in internal and trusted network deployment. SevOne strongly recommends that you do not expose your cluster on an open internet. SevOne also recommends that you deploy the appliances close to the monitored devices. If you choose to purchase an HSA, it is recommended to be close to its primary appliance.\n\nExposing SevOne NMS in the open Internet may pose significant security risk to your organization!\n\nRequired Ports\n\nSevOne cluster has sophisticated communication schema and relies on multiple required ports. Please refer to SevOne NMS Port Number Requirements Guide for a list of used ports. SevOne has clients that disable part of those ports, but this should be done with caution - only disable ports when you are certain that you do not use the functionality it serves and it does not compromise on security.\n\nFirewall\n\nSevOne appliances have disabled firewall process by default. For maximum security, SevOne recommends that you enable this and configure for all standard and custom ports that your appliance uses. You can find detailed instructions on how to configure your firewall in the SevOne NMS Installation Guide. Additionally, you can contact SevOne Support to provide further guidance and assistance.\n\nSSL Certificate\n\nSevOne NMS appliance is delivered with a self-signed SSL certificate as Apache/Nginx will not start otherwise. Using Certificate Authority, you must immediately replace the certificate with the real one. For details, please refer to Generate a Self Signed Certificate or a Certificate Signing Request guide. You may contact SevOne Support for assistance with the installation of the certificate, if needed. Once SSL is enabled, default configuration of Apache/Nginx will accept TLS v1.2 only. However, you may configure it to use TLS v1.3 as well.\n\nSSL Security Level\n\nOpenSSL is the SSL library used by SevOne NMS. SSL defines a security level setting (SECLEVEL) that determines the required strength of the signing algorithms used for keys. As of SevOne NMS 6.1 release, the SECLEVEL has increased from 1 to 2, restricting the accepted key signing algorithms from what was accepted previously.\n\nThe minimum accepted key length for SECLEVEL 2 is 2048 bits. The following are the accepted key signing algorithms.\n\nRSA+SHA512\n\nECDSA+SHA512\n\nRSA+SHA256\n\nRSA+SHA384\n\nRSA+SHAl:EC\n\nDSA+SHA256\n\nECDSA+SHA384\n\nECDSA+SHA1\n\nDSA+SHAI\n\nSSL negotiation fails if you are using a less secure key signature algorithm. In this case it is suggested to regenerate the keys under one of the supported SECLEVEL 2 algorithms. However, if this is not possible, the configured SECLEVEL can be lowered to 1, but please be aware that this will result in less secure SSL handshakes.\n\nTo lower the SECLEVEL to 1 for a single appliance, please execute the steps below.\n\nSSH to your SevOne NMS appliance.\n\n$ ssh root@<NMS appliance>\n\nUsing a text editor of your choice, edit /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config file.\n\n$ vi/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config\n\nReplace SECLEVEL for variable CipherString from SECLEVEL=2 to SECLEVEL=1.\n\nFrom...\n\nCipherString = @SECLEVEL=2:kEECDH:kRSA:kEDH:kPSK:kDHEPSK:kECDHEPSK:-aDSS:-3DES:!DES:!RC4:!RC2:!IDEA:-SEED:!eNULL:!aNULL:!MD5:-SHA384:-CAMELLIA:-ARIA:-AESCCM8\n\nTo...\n\nCipherString = @SECLEVEL=1:kEECDH:kRSA:kEDH:kPSK:kDHEPSK:kECDHEPSK:-aDSS:-3DES:!DES:!RC4:!RC2:!IDEA:-SEED:!eNULL:!aNULL:!MD5:-SHA384:-CAMELLIA:-ARIA:-AESCCM8\n\nSave /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config file.\n\nAny new SSL handshakes initiated by OpenSSL will now use the updated SECLEVEL.\n\nHTTPS Only\n\nBy default, Require HTTPS is disabled on the SevOne NMS appliance. You are strongly advised to enable the Require HTTPS option in Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Security.\n\nRequire HTTPS option is only available when you are logged on via https. This option requires secure connection for all dynamic content.\n\nThis will force connections to the server via https protocol only and redirect all other attempts to https. It will also enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), a mechanism that websites use to declare themselves accessible only via secure connections.\n\nFor improved security, SevOne recommends redirecting and rewriting the URLs that attempt to connect to the server via insecure protocol. Please contact SevOne Support to guide you through the process and/or assist in configuring the client appliance, if required.\n\nYou will now not be able to connect to the SevOne NMS appliance or the NMS REST API via simple HTTP call.\n\nSSL Certificates for REST API\n\nThere is some functionality that requires REST APIs between the peers to communicate with each other. By default, REST API skips to validate the certificates of the other appliances when calling their REST API services. Enable the Rest API Validate by Certificates checkbox from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Security to stop all untrusted calls. An inter-peer request will fail if it is not signed with a certificate from a valid Certificate Authority or if the certificate is not added to the java keystore of the appliances. Please make sure that you have added the SSL certificate in the trusted key for each peer. This can be done via:\n\nAdd the root certificate to the trust store of every peer (trust anchor /path/to/rootCA.crt)\n\nRestart the REST API for each peer (svctl restart SevOne-restapi)\n\nAdd Root Certificate (and Chain)\n\nTo add root certificate (and chain) to the operating system trust store, execute the following command.\n\nExample\n\n$ SevOne-act add-certificates --file/path/to/cert.crt\n\nUser Management\n\nAuthorization\n\nSevOne NMS relies on a built-in Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model. SevOne offers full capability to define and inherit User Roles. These roles enable granular control to grant/revoke permissions to access system functionality and/or data.\n\nUsers are assigned one or more user roles. There is also a mapping between LDAP groups and NMS roles.\n\nThe NMS roles can be granted or revoked permissions to:\n\nSee specific NMS UI pages\n\nAccess the SOAP and/or REST APIs\n\nPerform specific set of administrative actions in the system\n\nView and/or manage Device Groups\n\nView and/or manage concrete Devices\n\nView and/or manage other Users and User Roles\n\nAuthentication\n\nGenerally, users of the system fall into two different categories:\n\nNeed access to the application\n\nNeed access to the Operating System of the SevOne NMS appliance\n\nIf you need access to the NMS application then, you can authenticate in one or more of the following ways:\n\nSevOne Local authentication (by default)\n\nUsing external system (recommended to integrate external system/s). SevOne products currently support integration via LDAP/Active Directory, RADIUS, TACACS user credentials\n\nSevOne encourages you to configure the system to provide authentication via an external system (LDAP/Active Directory, RADIUS, TACACS). You can manage servers from Administration > Access Configuration > Authentication Settings. SevOne recommends you to always use secure LDAP with SSL or TLS certificate.\n\nIt is a best practice to keep one or more administrative accounts authenticated via SevOne Local method. It will be available if the external authentication systems are unavailable or their connections need to be repaired. By default, the NMS appliance is shipped with one administrative account, admin, for the Web application. 'admin' is the only user that has the role of a System Administrator. The password for this account can be changed from the SevOne configshell and this is mandatory upon initial installation.\n\nLocal login is recommended for simple deployments and POV projects. This method allows management of user accounts, enforcing complex passwords, keeping password history, forcing users to change passwords for their age, repetition, or any other reason.\n\nDevice Information Encryption using AES256\n\nFor security reasons, along with user credentials, tables containing sensitive information for the devices being monitored along, are encrypted using AES256 encryption.\n\nEncryption was introduced in SevOne NMS 5.7.2.7 release. For this, MySQL was updated to version 5.7.24 to add encryption for data at-rest to secure user data. To check MySQL version, SSH to your NMS appliance as root and run command SevOne-show-version.\n\nMySQL Tables Encrypted Internally\n\nUsers\n\naccess_control.user\n\naccess_control.userrole\n\nDevices\n\nnet.deviceinfo\n\nnet.netflowdeviceinfo\n\nMetadata\n\nnet.metadata_attribute\n\nnet.metadata_namespace\n\nnet.metadata_map\n\nlocal.metadata_map\n\nlocal.device_object_metadata\n\nOthers\n\nnet.peers\n\nnet.policy_webhooks\n\nlocal.flowfalconaggregationtemplate\n\nlocal.netflowdirection\n\nlocal.netflowinterface\n\nlocal.netflowoptionstemplate\n\nlocal.netflowsourcetemplate\n\nCredential Encryption\n\nFor security reasons, all credentials in the NMS database are encrypted when stored. This means that every plugin that needs to store authentication credentials, FTP server settings, SFTP passwords, SNMP community strings, etc in the database has to encrypt them on insertion and decrypt them on retrieval using reversible encryption.\n\nObtaining access to the sensitive database records would mean an attacker has already got access to the machine and the encryption key too. Improvements have been made to the database level. Usage of methods like SevOne::addDevice() or Device::getDevices() are transparent and there should be no change in the way you use these methods (as the encryption is handled by these methods). Everywhere inside the codebase of the NMS you should still be relying on the plain text values of all credentials.\n\nHowever, if you need to query the database manually, for instance in the C/C++ backend, you should be aware of encrypted values. This affects the following:\n\nQuery\n\nEncrypted Value(s)\n\nnet.wmiproxy\n\nencryption_password\n\nnet.wmideviceinfo\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.deviceinfo\n\nro_community\n\nrw_community\n\nauthentication_username\n\nauthentication_passphrase\n\nencryption_passphrase\n\nnet.device_candidates\n\nsnmp_ro_string\n\nsnmp_rw_string\n\nsnmp_username\n\nsnmp_auth_password\n\nsnmp_encryption_password\n\nlocal.device_database\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.jmxdeviceinfo\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.nam_deviceinfo\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.vmwaredeviceinfo\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.backupservers\n\nuser\n\npasswd\n\nnet.bulkdata_sources\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.ldapsettings\n\nbind_DN\n\nbind_password\n\nnet.mount_points\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.callmanagerdeviceinfo\n\nusername\n\npassword\n\nnet.callmanagercdrdeviceinfo\n\nsftp_username\n\nsftp_password\n\nnet.ftp_servers\n\nuser\n\npasswd\n\nSession Management\n\nRepeated failed login attempts results in account suspension.\n\nThe NMS administrator can define whether concurrent sessions by same user are allowed. If not allowed, upon new login by the same user credentials, the older session is terminated. By default, Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Login > Allow Concurrent User Sessions is enabled. It is recommended that this field is disabled.\n\nThe administrator can monitor and manage active user sessions from Administration > Access Configuration > Session Manager. When a suspicious activity is identified, a user session can be manually suspended by the administrator. . A notification is sent to the user, they are disconnected and redirected to the login screen.\n\nForce Login\n\nBy default, Allow Forcelogin is enabled. SevOne recommends that you should not select the Allow Forcelogin check box from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Security. This will prevent you from accessing SevOne NMS via the forcelogin.php script.\n\nThere are several other utilities available (however, not explicitly documented here) from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Security to ensure the security of your cluster and its users. Please refer to SevOne NMS System Administration Guide, section Cluster Manager for additional options.\n\nAudit Logging\n\nSevOne NMS also supports generation of audit logs for important domain events, including security relevant administrative and system actions. By default all domain events are enabled and it is recommended that you should not disable them. However, if any domain event needs to be toggled, it can be done from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Logging.\n\nThe list of actions to be logged is configurable by the system administrator via the application user interface. The system provides contextual details for the event - synchronized cluster timestamp, hostname / IP, system user that is triggering the event. Depending on the event type, the system logs further details (event specific) about the commands and result of the action.\n\nBy default, the logs are collected on the appliance. However, it is recommended that you forward the logs via syslog, optionally TLS enabled, to an external destination, using an external audit server to keep separate and allow robust operations on log files. It is possible for logs to grow too big in size and get harder to operate on. It is unlikely that the size of the log would impact the peer performance as there is a significant buffer. This can be done from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Syslog.\n\nAudit logs are limited to 20MB with a maximum of 5 rotated files.\n\nAppliance Administration\n\nOS User Credentials\n\nThe SevOne cluster has some features that require remote access between peers to be performed by the root user. Some customers have configured the SevOne cluster to prevent root from being a login user and while the majority of the functionality continues to work as intended, some features simply do not operate. SevOne does not recommend disabling it at this time and cannot guarantee proper cluster operations in this case.\n\nThe password to the root user is unique for each client - randomly generated when the box is shipped. The client administrators are given the generated password but they are advised to change the password as soon as they receive their appliance(s). To change the password, login as root and execute the command, passwd. Please respond to the prompt to enter the new password.\n\nLogin as 'root'\n\nlogin as: root\n\nUsing keyboard-interactive authentication.\n\nPassword:\n\nThe new password must be at least 8 characters long.\n\nCommand to change password\n\n$ passwd\n\nChanging password for user root.\n\nNew password:\n\nIt is highly recommended to not use the root user for normal login. There is a special admin user that is available for system administrators. The password for this user must be changed immediately after the client receives the appliance (it is forced on first login). Clients must keep this password secure and not share it with anyone outside of their organization - this includes SevOne Support, Professional Services, or Upgrade teams the user may be working with. To add the admin user as a sudo user, the following steps must be performed.\n\nLogin as root.\n\n$ ssh root@<NMS appliance>\n\nExecute the following command to modify the client's admin account.\n\n$ usermod -aG wheel admin\n\nRun the visudo command to edit the sudoers file, which is used by the sudo command. Update secure_path in the Defaults section.\n\n$ visudo\n\nÂ\n\nDefaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:\\\n\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/scripts:/opt/dell/srvadmin/bin:\\\n\n/home/admin/.local/bin:/home/admin/bin\n\nSevOne employees do not have any known credentials to access appliances. If assistance is needed, SevOne can guide you through configuration, diagnostics, etc. If needed, you could provide them temporary access to the appliances by sharing the credentials. After the support case is completed, please change the passwords to keep unique and secret credentials. You may have a dedicated user to use for external access. SevOne recommends that you keep such accounts SSH disabled and only allow when you expect SevOne Support would need access to the machine. Account should be disabled after the case is resolved.\n\nThere is one more SSH allowed user in the NMS system - the support user. This user is used by the NMS configshell utility. Its password is the same by default, but you will be forced to change it as soon as you receive the appliance. This happens in the configshell as part of the initial set up of the appliance. During initial set up, please do not change the password of the support user manually via the OS. This should always be done via the configshell interface. Otherwise, you will be locked out from the configshell interface.\n\nFurther details about the users and initial set up, how to change the root, admin, or support user passwords, etc. post the initial set up, please refer to SevOne NMS Installation Guide.\n\nThere are standard requirements for password strength for all OS SSH users. Password must be longer than 15 characters, mixed case, special chars, numeric, etc. The passwords are hashed in 41 bytes.\n\nDB Credentials\n\nSevOne offers a utility to allow changes in the credentials for the database users. SevOne strongly recommends clients to change their database credentials when they receive the appliance. SevOne Support can assist you with the process.\n\nYou have an option Require Strong Passwords for mysql users to enable complex password policy. By default, this option is disabled but it is recommended that you enable it. This is available from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Security. Select the Require Strong Passwords for mysql users check box to enforce the complexity of MySQL user passwords. The minimum length of the MySQL password must be at least 14 symbols long, contain at least one special character +-_@[]:,.%, at least one number, at least one UPPERCASE letter, and at least one lowercase letter. The valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, +-_@[]:,.%. An example of a valid password: 8s0H43o@7]o%p3. If the current MySQL password does not meet this requirement, it will be change the password to a random, compliant password.\n\nChange MySQL User Credentials\n\nSevOne NMS uses the MySQL database for storing the NMS configuration, NMS user authentication, device configuration and device poll data information. By default, the MySQL root user is set with an empty password. It is recommended that you change the password of the MySQL root user in SevOne NMS.\n\nSevOne-change-mysql-password command is used to update the NMS appliance's MySQL administrative user's username and/or password.\n\nIf the appliance is in an HSA pair, this must be run on the active appliance and the passive appliance in this pair will update automatically. However, this command will not automatically update other appliances in the cluster with the same username and password change. This procedure needs to be run on all Active appliances in the cluster individually. The NMS MySQL default user is root.\n\nExecuting SevOne-change-mysql-password command will restart the SevOne NMS services - it is highly recommended that you proceed with caution as there may be a small possibility of data loss due to the daemon's restarting and missing polls that were in progress. Any data that is already collected will not be lost.\n\nExample\n\n$ SevOne-change-mysql-password --username \"NEW_USERNAME\" --password \"NEW_PASSWORD\"\n\n--username (Required) Rename the current username to this\n\n--password (Required) Change the password to this value\n\nThe following are valid characters:\n\na-z, A-Z, 0-9, +-_@[]:,.%\n\nTo run this procedure for all Active Appliances in the cluster as a single command, first set the password as a shell variable and then execute the command as shown below. This command must be executed from the Cluster Leader Active appliance.\n\nThe password to be set in the following example is Welcome@123456789. Set variable MYPASSWORD with a strong password.\n\nExample\n\n$ MYPASSWORD='Welcome@123456789';\n\n$ for IP in $(mysqlconfig -BNe 'select ip from peers;'); \\\n\ndo echo \"Executing on $IP\"; \\\n\nssh $IP \"SevOne-change-mysql-password \\\n\n--username root --password $MYPASSWORD\"; done\n\nIdentify your current NMS identity and IP.\n\n$ SevOne-peer-whoami\n\n=== My Peer info:\n\n--- ID: 1\n\n--- Name: pandora-01\n\n--- IP: 10.129.14.168\n\nUsing the MySQL client, connect to the IP address returned above (for example, 10.129.14.168) from any appliance in the cluster. You will be prompted for the password. Enter the new password as set in the example (Welcome@123456789). If you used a username other than root, you can change to the correct username as shown in the command below. Successful completion of the command will bring you to the MySQL prompt. You should be logged in and be able to execute the MySQL queries.\n\n$ mysql -h 10.129.14.168 -P 3307 net -u root -p\n\nEnter password:\n\nReading table information for completion of table and column names\n\nYou can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A\n\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g.\n\nYour MySQL connection id is 6151\n\nServer version: 5.6.40-enterprise-commercial-advanced-log MySQL Enterprise Server - Advanced Edition (Commercial)\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2022, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.\n\nOracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its\n\naffiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective\n\nowners.\n\nType 'help;' or '\\h'for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement.\n\nmysql>\n\nmysql> exit\n\nBye\n\nIf there is an error with the password or it has not updated correctly, then you may get an error as shown below - you may need to run the procedure all over.\n\n$ mysql -h 10.129.14.168 -P 3307 net -u root -p\n\nEnter password:\n\nERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'pandora-01' (using password: YES)\n\nPlatform security\n\nSevOne appliances are complete solutions deployed with a full Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP (LAMP/LEMP) stack (NOTE: Apache or Ngnix depending on your SevOne NMS version). The SevOne Cluster grows through the deployment of new appliances and adding them to the cluster as peers.\n\nOS and Third-party Packages\n\nIn Q1' 2018, SevOne released the first general availability (GA) release based on CentOS Linux. New clients will receive a fresh CentOS box; all existing clients will be able to upgrade from Gentoo environments to CentOS via a special tool provided by SevOne. The main reason for the change in OS from Gentoo to CentOS is to provide SevOne and our customers, a stronger and more sustainable OS security position.\n\nAs of SevOne NMS 5.7.2.0, with a move to CentOS, it has been SevOne's goal to have zero known CentOS CVEs with available patches at development cut date for each release. SevOne's development cut is declared when a release candidate is identified and quality testing begins. SevOne declares general availability when testing has completed and bugs are fixed. SevOne's development cut milestone occurs approximately 1-2 weeks prior to the release. If a new OS CVE with an available patch is released after the development cut date, it is addressed in the next release. If a published CVE does not have an available patch, SevOne monitors the CVE. When a patch is available for the CVE, SevOne upgrades CentOS prior to the next development cut date. SevOne NMS is on a monthly release cadence. SevOne recommends that all our clients maintain their systems with the latest NMS version by upgrading regularly.\n\nKernel\n\nSevOne's new deployments are not vulnerable to the dirty cow (CVE-2016-5195) attack. For maximum security, SevOne strongly advices our older clients to manually install and select the standalone package with the new kernel (4.9.X) that SevOne provides. For additional information and assistance, please contact SevOne Support.\n\nProcesses and Permissions\n\nSome of the processes on the NMS appliance are running under their own user for separation of concerns and minimal permissions. Example: Apache/Nginx, MySQL, REST API, Redis, Kafka, etc. There are other processes that are still running as root user with full permissions. Where there are security concerns, SevOne is making an effort to convert such services to their own restricted users and groups and restrict their permissions and eliminate the use of the root user completely.\n\nSome SevOne customers manually configure SevOne-daemons to run as non-root user. This change however, makes the appliances difficult to upgrade and maintain. SevOne does not recommend this configuration. For more details, please contact SevOne Support.\n\nSevOne appliances are not general usage applications. There are no use cases where a regular user (with lesser permissions) should use the box. Shell access to the appliance should be granted to the administrator only.\n\nHigh Availability Solution\n\nEach peer in a SevOne cluster can be peered with a Hot Standby Appliance (HSA) to provide real time backup and fault tolerance. In this configuration, the primary appliance will replicate all data it contains (configuration and polling) to the HSA. The HSA is then able to take over all duties of the primary appliance if it should happen to fail (due to hardware failure, power outage, loss of network connectivity, etc.). This includes polling, baselining, reporting, and also administrative functions of the cluster leader. HSA will turn on as soon as there is no connection to the primary PAS for more than x minutes (x = 10 minutes / 600 seconds by default, but this field is configurable).\n\nThe return from HSA back to the PAS is a manual activity as it requires merging the data of the two appliances.\n\nHSA is just a precaution. SevOne have clients with HSA that have never been used. They have had years of stable operation.\n\nPrevent XSS in Simple attachment\n\nDue to backwards compatibility with legacy reports, by default, custom code in Simple reporting attachments is allowed. This means that any user who can edit a report, can potentially inject harmful code that would be executed when any other user views the report. In order to prevent this, Allow insecure code in Simple attachment check box from Cluster Manager > Cluster Settings > Security is available for SevOne NMS administrators to allow/disallow usage of custom code in the Simple attachments. By default, Allow insecure code in Simple attachment check box is enabled but SevOne recommends that this option should be disabled.\n\nThis will prevent all users from entering custom widgets via Simple report attachments.\n\nForce Same Origin Policy\n\nBy default, Force Same Origin Policy check box is enabled and it is recommended that this option should not be disabled. With the Force Same Origin Policy check box enabled, it prevents SevOne NMS from being loaded outside of the current domain. This includes portals and the use of the force login script to load SevOne NMS into an iframe from where a malicious user could log your activity. Note: If you clear this check box, the application security is lowered in a way that can prevent SevOne NMS from passing specific security scans. By selecting this check box, it enforces the Same Origin Policy (SOP) or allows you to configure a small list of allowed origins. Also, it will reduce attack surface and prevent CSRF attacks.\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU). It requires organizations to reform the way business operations are performed in order to meet increased standards of handling personal data. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. This regulation is not applicable to a particular software product (such as SevOne NMS), but it requires the organization using SevOne NMS to use best practices guidelines to keep the organization compliant and demonstrate accountability.\n\nAny personal data subject to the GDPR regulation is all data that serves to uniquely identify a natural person, or revealing their racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, any biometric data, etc. Given this definition, SevOne NMS can operate without any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, it is a common practice for administrators to provide this type of data in order to keep user accounts and personal accountability for actions performed by their employees.\n\nWhen using SevOne NMS user accounts, it keeps track of the user's given name, surname, email address, and username. You must make sure that your organization's operations are in compliance with GDPR.\n\nSevOne NMS is only intended to be used by a select number of company employees. It does not offer self-registration. Due to this, it does not collect personal information directly from the users. Users must provide the details to the SevOne administrator for a user account to be created. SevOne NMS does not require any confirmation or validation of the legitimacy of this data, including the email address.\n\nSevOne recommends all customers to establish policies and best practices to properly handle any personal data. Data Protection Officers must be appointed and trained to oversee the correct application of these practices.\n\nFor SevOne appliance to operate, PII data is optional. The decision to store PII is at customer's own discretion.\n\nBest Practices for SevOne NMS\n\nInform for Purpose and Obtain Consent\n\nInform users how the information will be used and obtain the user's consent prior to entering their details in SevOne NMS. Administrators must only create user accounts once the consent is received.\n\nAllow Users to Request Personal Data Collected\n\nSevOne NMS administrator uses SevOne NMS > Administration > Access Configuration > User Manager or SevOne NMS' REST API to export all details regarding the user and provide it to them.\n\nData Portability\n\nSevOne NMS' REST API works in a standard JSON data format i.e. readable text. Export of user data can be used to transfer the information.\n\nRight to be Forgotten\n\nOrganizational policy must allow users to request to be forgotten. Upon receiving such a request, SevOne NMS administrator is obliged to delete the user account using SevOne NMS > Administration > Access Configuration > User Manager or SevOne NMS' REST API.\n\nBreach Notification\n\nWhen organizations become aware of the data breach, they are obligated to notify all affected users within the first 72 hours. Data breach is likely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals. SevOne recommends that the SevOne NMS appliance is kept off the public internet. SevOne utilizes best industry practices to maintain services secure of data breach. SevOne NMS offers auditing, self-monitoring, and other options to support administrators to prevent or quickly identify such events. In an unlikely event this happens, SevOne recommends implementation of established policies. For example, inform all employees (system users) whose details have been compromised.\n\nAudit Logs\n\nAfter a user is deleted, there may be traces of their id or username for auditing purposes to keep track of specific actions which are critical for the correct operation of the system. For security reasons, this information is saved for a pre-defined period of time. The retention period is configurable using the syslog configuration and depends on the client's organizational policy. At the end of the retention period or when the log exceeds 100MB, the log is archived. There is a configurable age-out period which is set to one year by default. At the end of the age-out period, the logs are deleted.\n\nThe logs are used to ensure proper operation of SevOne NMS and to continue servicing other SevOne NMS users.\n\nSevOne recommends that when a user decides to leave the system, the username and id are insufficient to uniquely identify a natural physical person. In cases where this is not possible, users must be notified that their identifier username would be kept a bit longer for auditing purposes. The exact policy and timeline for deleting this data must be shared.\n\nIn the scenario when the information is backed up to another location by the NMS administrator, there must be a policy in place to ensure that the user data is deleted immediately after the retention period has passed. Even when the logs are exported to an external system or backup server for further analysis, there must be a clear expiration policy in place.\n\nIP Addresses\n\nA static IP address can serve as an online identifier and is considered personal data when additional information such as real name, phone number, email address, etc. are also stored along with it. At this time, there is no precedent for enforcing the GDPR policy however, there are generally accepted best practices.\n\nIf the user information has been removed with WebUserName, IP address becomes irrelevant and out of GDPR scope.\n\nThe dynamic IP address must not be considered personal data. Even if it is assumed that the ISP has a record of the user for this IP address, certain legal criteria must be satisfied prior to sharing the data. The client company must not have a way to uniquely identify the user.\n\nThe static IP address is more likely, but not 100%, guaranteed to allow identification of a natural person and can point to a device (physical or virtual). In combination with other details such as the applications used, usernames, etc., it can point to a concrete person with a satisfactory confidence level.\n\nThe data that SevOne NMS collects is not enough on its own to identify a user and must not be considered personal data. SevOne recommends that the clients must make sure that there is no other data in their organization that in combination with SevOne data, may be enough to identify a person. If the client has accounting or other data for their network users, this information must be kept separate from SevOne NMS data. At no point must this data be combined. There must be no users that have access to both products and allowed to make combined reports.\n\nGDPR User Rights\n\nLog into SevOne NMS > from the navigation bar, go to SevOne NMS > Administration > Access Configuration > User Manager.\n\nOr, you may directly use SevOne NMS' REST API endpoints."
