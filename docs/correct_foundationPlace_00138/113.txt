SevOne, has extends the worldwide position of the SevOne Performance Monitoring Cluster with the release of the 5.4 versions of the SevOne Performance Appliance Solution (PAS) and the SevOne Dedicated NetFlow Collector (DNC). The PAS 5.4 and DNC 5.4 can integrate with the SevOne Performance Log Appliance 2.0 to automatically correlate real-time network and infrastructure performance metrics, flows and logs at scale. The 5.4 releases also supports the customer journey to software-defined networks (SDN) and data centers (SDDC) with metadata and hierarchical object types; delivers new features that bolster capacity management with automated projections; and supports a fully translated user interface for multiple languages.

“Today’s rapid, on-demand digital infrastructures are creating tidal waves of data, traffic, and fluctuating demand, requiring organisations to derive new and critical insights from performance metrics, flows and logs at scale,” said Matthias Machowinski, research director, Enterprise Networks and Video at Infonetics Research. “However, these digital infrastructures are stretching legacy monitoring tools to the breaking point. SevOne is answering these challenges by delivering a new approach that’s helping companies monitor their digital infrastructure effectively and ensure consistent delivery of vital applications and services.”

SevOne’s latest release addresses the market’s demand for a digital infrastructure monitoring technology born into the hyperscale economy that can uncover real-time trends and event activity that will help companies reveal hidden issues —improved service delivery with fewer problems and improved availability. This approach ensures as data increases and monitoring domains continue to expand into unchartered territories—blind spots, knowledge gaps, and delays do not become a daily reality.

“As companies embark on the journey to software-defined networks and data centers, the ability to pivot between metric, flow and log data allows users to see what is happening with quick insight into why it is happening,” said Jack Sweeney, CEO at SevOne. “SevOne is delivering this critical capability to enable an on-demand, elastic infrastructure to help companies understand dependencies and constraints in their dynamic, virtualised environments.”

With its 5.4 release, SevOne further differentiates itself from other approaches on the market in monitoring any device in the service delivery path, integrating performance metrics, flows and logs at scale, and providing answers in seconds to prevent performance-impacting outages. Enhanced capabilities in the product include:
