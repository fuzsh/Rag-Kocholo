        "text": "Pamela Abdy serves as Co-Chair and CEO of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, encompassing Warner Bros. Motion Pictures, New Line Cinema, DC-based films and Warner Animation Group. WPMPG continues to build on its legacy of iconic feature franchises and world-class cinema, working across all genres with both established and emerging talent – in front of and behind the camera – to deliver the industry’s most diverse slate of films for a global audience. Abdy serves as Co-Chair and CEO with Michael De Luca.\n\nAs Co-Chair and CEO of the Pictures Group, Abdy shares oversight of the Studio’s global theatrical production, marketing and distribution operations, which set a new high watermark for the industry early in 2022 with the record-shattering success of the acclaimed blockbuster The Batman. Following its record-breaking $258.2 million opening weekend, the critical and commercial hit went on to earn more than $770 million, becoming the Studio’s highest-grossing release in the pandemic era. In addition to The Batman, WBPG’s 2022 releases include Elvis, DC League of Super-Pets (Warner Animation Group), Don’t Worry Darling (New Line), Black Adam (New Line/DC) and Shazam! Fury of the Gods (New Line/DC).\n\nFurther highlighting WBMPG’s commitment to creative excellence, Warner Bros. was the most-honored studio at the 94th Annual Academy Awards – winning seven of its 16 nominations – for King Richard and Dune; Dune collected six Oscars, more than any other film released in 2021.\n\nPrior to joining Warner Bros., Abdy served as MGM’s Motion Picture Group President, overseeing development, production and post-production for all MGM and Orion films. She oversaw studio hits such as Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci, starring Lady Gaga and Adam Driver; Paul Thomas Anderson’s Academy Award® Best Picture-nominated Licorice Pizza, which marked the studio’s first such nomination since Rain Man won in 1988; Creed 3, starring and directed by Michael B. Jordan; Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan’s Addams Family 2; and Ron Howard’s 13 Lives, which was nominated for three SAG Awards.\n\nBefore that, she was a Partner and Head of Film at Makeready, managing the creative team and all feature development, production and post-production. During her time at Makeready, the company financed and produced Queen & Slim from director Melina Matsoukas and writer Lena Waithe, and A Million Little Pieces from director Sam Taylor-Johnson.\n\nFrom 2013 until 2016, Abdy served as President of Production at New Regency. During her post at the company, New Regency released Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Academy Award®-winning Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), Adam McKay’s Academy Award®-winning The Big Short, Justin Kurzel’s Assassin’s Creed and Gore Verbinski’s Cure For Wellness. Abdy also oversaw the release of Iñárritu’s The Revenant in 2016, which received 12 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won two Golden Globe awards, for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Actor.\n\nPrior to New Regency, Abdy was the President of Scott Stuber’s Bluegrass Films, where she procured, developed and produced features for the company’s diverse slate, including 47 Ronin, Identity Thief, Kill the Messenger and Endless Love.\n\nAbdy previously served as Executive Vice President at Paramount Pictures, where she oversaw the development and production of a number of films, including Martin Scorsese’s Shutter Island, The Love Guru starring Mike Myers, Kimberly Peirce’s Stop-Loss, the Judd Apatow-produced Drillbit Taylor, Oliver Stone’s World Trade Center, Karyn Kusama’s Aeon Flux, Richard LaGravenese’s Freedom Writers, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Golden Globe-winning Babel and Mark Waters’ Mean Girls.\n\nAbdy started her career as an intern at Jersey Films while participating in the Emerson College internship program. She was hired as the receptionist and went on to become Danny DeVito’s assistant. From there, she rose through the company and ultimately became President, where she associate-produced Man on the Moon; co-produced Caveman’s Valentine; executive produced How High; and produced the film Garden State, which won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature Film and a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. She is a member of the Producers Guild of America, serves as a Governor on the Executive Board of the Executive Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and is a part of The Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Entertainment Mentorship Program."
