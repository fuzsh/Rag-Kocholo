        "text": "After a public fallout over release strategy with Warner Bros, Christopher Nolanâs next film, about J Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atom bomb, will be released by Universal Pictures.\n\nRepresentatives for the studio confirmed Tuesday that Universal has acquired the rights to finance and distribute Nolanâs not-yet-titled film. Deadline Â first reported the deal. Nolan also wrote the script of the film about the theoretical physicist. Production is expected to begin early next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros and Christopher Nolan go way back\n\nWith only a handful of exceptions, Warner Bros had long been home to Nolan, going back to Insomnia in 2002.\n\nWith the studio, Nolan made The Dark Knight trilogy (2005, 2008, and 2013),Â the mind-bending InceptionÂ (2010), the Oscar Best Picture nominee Dunkirk (2017),and the time-traveling Tenet (2020).\n\nWarner Bros also handled international distribution of The Prestige (2006) and Interstellar (2014).\n\nFallout of Nolan with Warner Bros over pandemic release plan\n\nLast year, Warner BrosÂ launched Tenet in theatersÂ in September at a time when much of the film industryÂ was timid about releasing big-budget movies.\n\nThe sci-fi thriller ultimately grossed $363.7 million, making it easily the biggest Hollywood pandemic release of the year.\n\nBut when Warner Bros in December announcedÂ plans to release all of its 2021 films simultaneously on HBO Max , Nolan â long an ardent advocate for the theatrical experience â was one of the studioâs harshest critics .\n\nWhat did Nolan have to say about Warner Bros’ release plan?\n\nIn a statement, he said âsome of our industryâs biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.â\n\nâWarner Bros had an incredible machine for getting a filmmakerâs work out everywhere, both in theaters and in the home, and they are dismantling it as we speak,â wrote Nolan.\n\nâThey donât even understand what theyâre losing. Their decision makes no economic sense, and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction.â\n\nShortly thereafter, he called the studioâs plans âa mess.\"\n\nâItâs a unilateral decision that the studio took. They didnât even tell the people involved,â Nolan said.\n\nâYou have these great filmmakers who worked with passion and diligence for years on projects that are intended to be feature films with fantastic movie stars. And theyâve all now been told that theyâre a loss-leader for a fledgling streaming service.â\n\nExecutives for Warner Bros have maintained that the studio will return to releasing movies exclusively in theaters next year.\n\nWhat is Nolan’s new movie about?\n\nThe subject is American theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who helped develop the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nAccording to Deadline , the plot details are sketchy but the new movie will focus on Oppenheimer, who is considered one of the fathers of the atom bomb.\n\nHe was a pivotal figure in the Manhattan ProjectÂ â the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons.\n\nCillian Murphy, one of Nolan’’s frequent collaborators, is said to be a possible member of the ensemble, but casting has yet to take place.\n\nFilming on the Oppenheimer picture is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe project will be produced by Nolan alongside his wife and longtime producing partnerÂ Emma ThomasÂ for their Syncopy Inc banner.\n\nWith inputs from agencies."
