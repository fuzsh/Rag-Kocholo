        "text": "Regret Waiting As Long As I Had in Getting to This One\n\nOf all the computer animated talking animals out there these days, penguins have certainly enjoyed the limelight. Happy Feet, Penguins of Madagascar, Surfs Up, The Jungle Bunch- these are just a few of the CG films in the past few years to focus on the flightless birds of the colder climes.\n\nBelieve it or not, I was on the fence about viewing Happy Feet ever since its release back in 2006 for two key complaints that seem to follow the piece: A political agenda and enough singing to be considered borderline “musical”. Call me picky if you must but a political musical doesn’t exactly rank as the type of material to get excited about when sitting down to absorb a good CG romp. However, I am pleased to report that such concerns were greatly exaggerated. But before we get into the nitty gritty of the material itself, let’s take a moment to review the hard fact shall we?\n\nHappy Feet was conceived as an Australian/ American collaboration directed and co-written by George Miller. It was produced at Sydney-based visual effects and animation studio Animal Logic for Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures and Kingdom Feature Productions and was released in North American theaters on November 17, 2006. Warner Home Video brought the piece to the home market in March of 2007 and here we are.\n\nThe 108-minute, PG rated tale centers on a young emperor penguin named Mumble born with a singing voice only his mother could love. This would be hardly cause for concern in our society but it turns out that penguins of this sect just so happen to base their entire dating, life-mate selection on “heart song”. In other words, not being able to sing to this little guy is like trying to be a playboy in social media without Facebook.\n\nThe situation isn’t hopeless though as the lad’s got rhythm. Though dancing isn’t really common or even socially acceptable among penguin-folk, there’s change in the air. In the grand story arc, change is overdue anyway with the interaction between mankind and the wild and if tap dancing penguins is the spark that makes us collectively pay attention to the value of life on this planet, then so be it.\n\nOf course it’s this aspect of the story most responsible for initial squawks of liberal propaganda and themes of environmentalism but in the grand scheme things there are certainly worse messages coming out of Hollywood of late. Besides, never is such ideology force-fed to you (if in doubt, pick up Animals United from Arc Entertainment to witness just how bad it can get).\n\nThis film represents the first attempt at animation from Mad Max director George Miller but boy you’d never know it by the pacing, visuals (which still look tight 7 years later) or impeccable casting\n\nSomehow Miller manages to turn a fairly straight forward and borderline silly premise and manages to convert it into a grand and whimsical work of cinematic art. The film literally opens with photo-realistic textures of Antarctica and quickly establishes an ensemble cast that makes tagging along for the ride absolutely effortless.\n\nAt the time of its release, some critics went as far as to say this $100-mil masterpiece birthed some of the best visuals in a CG production outside of Pixar and truly how these guys managed to thread the needle between lovable characters and realistic animal models is anyone’s guess. Plus there’s an underlying tension involved in the plot reminiscent of early Disney animated films- where you almost expect tragedy in the struggle to survive in the natural world. Fortunately making you cry isn’t the prime motivation here and the ending, though a bit contrived, is certainly more about feeling good than anything else.\n\nAs for my other main concern- penguins breaking into song so frequently as to be considered a borderline musical: again, needless worry. With a soundtrack that includes everything from hip hop to disco, the musical antics are enjoyable and certainly more fun than expected.\n\nIn all, a shame I waited as long as I did to give Happy Feet a go; truly this is a piece that will resonate with viewers of all ages. Children will be mesmerized with the visuals and adults will find the plot engaging enough to tolerate, maybe even enjoy, multiple rewatchings.\n\nA Sum Far Greater Than its Parts\n\nThe Legend of the Guardians is a strange tale- and I’m not even talking about the actual film. Hyped during its theatrical run (which began on September 24th of 2010), Warner Brother announced that it was scheduled for a mid-February DVD/ Blu-ray release. Then suddenly (presumably in effort to capitalize on the spend-happy Holiday shopper scene), the DVD & Blu-ray were released and with virtually no hoopla on December 17th. I nearly completely overlooked it as a result except for the fact that when preordering Despicable Me, I was recommended Guardians with the sub text “available now”.\n\nGoing into the film, I was aware of the fact that the material would be joining an ever-growing list (a list that includes Shrek, Meet the Robinsons, How to Train your Dragon, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs to mention a few) of animated features based on popular children’s book series. This one was done up by the studio responsible for Happy Feet (Village Roadshow), distributed by powerhouse Warner Brothers and represents Zack Snyder’s (the man responsible for such works as Watchmen and 300) directorial debut in animated feature film.\n\nOn the whole, Warner Brothers has been lagging behind in the highly lucrative animated feature market; a place dominated by Disney/ Pixar and DreamWorks. Other studios in similar positions have begun to realize the potential in this segment and are putting in serious work to catch up (Sony with ImageWorks, 20th Century Fox with Blue Sky and so on). WB hasn’t proven quite as eager as the competition so converting Kathryn Lasky’s series of young reader fantasy books into CG is about as good a place to start making up for lost time.\n\nLegend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole’ uses personified owls to weave its tale in a completely fantastical world (seemingly devoid of humans). The plot works on the fantasy template on nearly a point-by-point basis: A young, inexperienced (eventual) hero is introduced from the safety of his picturesque home. Innocence and security are whisked away by invasion of a powerful enemy army, complete with a weapon of incalculable advantage. The only force in the world capable of keeping the rising threat at bay have long since retired to the recesses of memory and myth.\n\nThe quest begins to not only prove the legend true, but to convince the Guardians to come out of their self-imposed retirement to once again rise up against this evil empire (The Pure Ones) to restore peace and harmony to the whole land. Along the way there will be requisite betrayals, family division, advice from goodhearted heroes, training from hardened warriors, a better understanding of the horrors of war and why freedom is worth fighting to preserve.\n\nIf this all sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a story archetype that’s been told countless times throughout the ages. Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Eragon; you can find this precise tale in various forms of entertainment spanning literature, film, poetry, folklore and so on. However, don’t be mistaken into believing that because its formulaic, Legend of the Guardians comes up short. But we’ll get to that.\n\nNotice the apparent lack of names included in my above story summary? That was a deliberate homage to the actual experience in that upon the film’s conclusion, I was confident only in the names of two of the fifteen main characters.\n\nNames like Otulissa, Strix Struma, Ezylryb, Eglantine and Allomere were made clear to me only in post-viewing research and even then I was quite unsure which were which. Australian accents and little scripting effort to embed faces with the names results is a definite “so that’s the main guy’s brother there?” experience. Fortunately, somehow, the film suffers none as a result of this little snafu. A marketing disaster, sure, but the entertainment value endures.\n\nAnd speaking of entertainment value, Legend of the Guardians is a visual feast! It can truly be said that Pixar and DreamWorks have absolutely nothing on Village Roadshow. Lighting is spectacular, settings are rich with background detail and the character models are so well textured/ animated that they often border on photorealism. The flight sequences, particularly when viewed in high-definition, are breathtaking. I can only imagine what the experience must have been like in a 3D theater.\n\nThere are a few complaints to be voiced however. The weapon of the enemy (an energy field that somehow captures owls and renders them helpless) is kept a complete mystery to the viewer for the duration of the film. Whether or not it is better explained in the source material books, I cannot say, but aside from requiring tiny little pieces of metal to function, it is nothing more than a one-dimensional plot device here.\n\nAlso the PG rating should be taken quite seriously as, though animated, this film contains some pretty intense sequences that will surely unsettle the youngsters. Additionally, even if the kid in question is desensitized to such things, the plot and themes would likely be a bit heavy/ hard to follow for younger tykes.\n\nIn all though, despite what surely sounds like multiple complaints, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole’ is a surprisingly solid piece of computer generated film. The story is a bit cliché yet it still manages to engross, the character and location names are a venerable mystery, yet the story manages to shine through, the 3D revolution may be a fad but the visuals here simply refuse to stop dazzling. At the end of the day, the movie is 97 minutes of sheer enjoyable adventure: a classic tale of good versus evil, told with animation of absolutely epic proportions. The fantasy element is quite strong throughout and offers fans of films like the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars a fully CG feature to relish."
