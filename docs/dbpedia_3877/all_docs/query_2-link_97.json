And we are thrilled to be the first studio to test ticketing on the platform.”\n\n“We are excited to collaborate with Warner Bros. and Roblox on this unique in-world experience and test the first-ever virtual Fandango box office for the much anticipated ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice’ movie,” said Will McIntosh, Fandango President. “At Fandango, we are champions of the big screen and remain committed to reaching new fans through innovative, one-of-a-kind experiences that drive increased theater attendance.”\n\nWelcome To The Afterlife (Experience Details)\n\nAs visitors enter [Beetlejuice] Escape the Afterlife on Roblox, they are immediately transported to The Afterlife Lobby—a spooky world that brings together familiar places from the original Beetlejuice movie with new scenes and experiences from the highly-anticipated sequel. From the lobby, fans can enter one of three immersive worlds, where they need to escape ghouls and rescue beloved characters like Delia and Lydia, and new characters like Astrid. They will visit The Waiting Room, see the Shrinkers (aka Shrunken Head Guy) and his friends, and even explore Adam’s model of Winter River, Connecticut during their rescue journeys.\n\nWhile watching the new movie trailer for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice in The Afterlife Lobby and interacting with other fans, users can now also make plans to see the movie in theaters.

This is just the beginning as our vision is to enable brands and creators to turn their brand affinity and consumer engagement on Roblox into a seamless shopping experience for their new and existing audiences.”\n\n“The Beetlejuice franchise carries so much sentiment and appeal across generations, especially for superfans like me,” said Nic Hill, Co-Founder and Head of Interactive, Sawhorse. “But we knew we had to create a Beetlejuice experience on Roblox that introduces new generations to the story and adapts to their way of interaction inside the Beetlejuice Universe.
