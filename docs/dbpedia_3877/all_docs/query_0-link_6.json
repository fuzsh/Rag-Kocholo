        "text": "It is interesting to note that, in the 26-year partnership between producer Charles H. Schneer and special effects artist Ray Harryhausen (which had just begun the previous year at Columbia Pictures with Das Grauen aus der Tiefe (1955)), \"The Animal World\" is one of just two films (the other being Eine Million Jahre vor unserer Zeit (1966)) of Harryhausen's work during that time frame which Schneer did not produce.\n\nThis film contains the first color work of stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen in a feature film. This was also the second and last time he worked under his mentor, Willis H. O'Brien, who supervised the stop-motion animation in this film. (The first was Panik um King Kong (1949).)\n\nIn interviews following his retirement, Ray Harryhausen indicated the film \"ran into a censorship problem\" apparently from the Hays Office. The criticism centered on the sequence of a Ceratosaurus killing a Stegosaurus, and then fighting a second Ceratosaurus. The criticism centered on the violence of the fight sequence. Harryhausen noted the film's live action animal sequences were similarly bloody, hence the viciousness of the dinosaur battle."
