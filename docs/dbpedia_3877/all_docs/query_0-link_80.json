        "text": "To celebrate Harry Potter’s birthday, Universal Orlando has announced details for the upcoming Harry Potter land, titled The Wizarding World of Harry Potter — Ministry of Magic, for Epic Universe. As you may know, Epic Universe is an all-new theme park opening next year in Orlando, FL as part of an aggressive expansion of Universal’s market share in the Central Florida tourism sector. Epic Universe will be Universal Orlando’s third theme park, joining Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios. Universal Orlando also operates the Volcano Bay water park.\n\nWhile we normally stick to Disney Parks news on BlogMickey.com, a brand new theme park is as exciting as it is unavoidable. We will continue to cover Universal Epic Universe up to and through the grand opening that is currently scheduled for Summer 2025.\n\nDeveloped by the award-winning Universal Creative team and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic builds upon the global phenomenon that began in 2010 with the debut of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Hogsmeade at Universal Islands of Adventure and continued with the 2014 launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida. Next year, the bar for theme park entertainment will be raised once again with the addition of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic – creating an exciting trilogy of wizarding adventures across Universal Orlando.\n\n• Le Cirque Arcanus – For the first time ever in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, guests will enjoy a live, full-scale theatre experience in the heart of the land with Le Cirque Arcanus. This spectacular show features live performers and aerialists, amazing puppetry, brilliant special effects and more to take guests on a whirlwind journey where they’ll encounter fantastic beasts like never before. The show follows Ringmaster Skender, who has stolen Newt Scamander’s suitcase – where Demiguise, Diricawl, Mooncalves and more reside – to try and bring the failing Le Cirque Arcanus back to its former glory. It’s then up to circus employee Gwenlyn to rescue these creatures before they end up in Skender’s greedy hands forever.\n\n• Cosme Acajor Baguettes Magique – Guests can shop some of the world’s finest wands designed by esteemed artisan wandmaker, Cosme Acajor, in the premier Parisian wand shop, Cosme Acajor Baguettes Magique. In addition to popular imports from Ollivanders, visitors will find a selection of exquisite wands packaged in unique three-sided boxes – each containing a list of locations throughout the wizarding world where guests can practice casting spells.\n\n• Inspiring Wand Magic – As guests explore the streets of wizarding Paris, they can use their interactive wands to create magical experiences as they cast spells at various locations, interact with fantastic beasts such as Nifflers, Bowtruckles and a Demiguise, and engage with enchanted objects in many of the storefront windows plus other areas throughout the marvelous Place Cachée.\n\n• Captivating Entertainment – While exploring the streets of Place Cachée, guests will also encounter other visitors, officials and residents from the wizarding world, including exchange students from the Hogwarts and Ilvermorny Schools of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an Auror from the Ministère des Affaires Magiques de la France who roams inquiring of suspicious characters, talking portraits of delightful wizards who engage with locals about the happenings in Place Cachée, and more.\n\n• Le Gobelet Noir – In the shadowy corners of Place Cachée is a mysterious timeworn auberge, where international Dark witches and wizards gather to escape the prying eyes of the Paris Ministry and have a hearty meal over hushed conversation. Menu offerings include starters such as soups and salads as well as a variety of entrées and desserts.\n\n• Bar Moonshine – American witches and wizards can enjoy a taste of home at Bar Moonshine, where they’ll find exclusive beers, wines and cocktails served amid U.S. Quidditch team pennants and other items of wizarding Americana.\n\n• Bièraubeurre Cart – No visit to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is complete without Butterbeer! Guests can stop by the Bièraubeurre cart during their visit to Place Cachée for a frosty, delicious mug of the fan-favorite beverage."
