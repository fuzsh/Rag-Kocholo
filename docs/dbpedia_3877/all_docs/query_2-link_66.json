        "text": "1. Pitch – Warner Bros.\n\n2. Warner Bros. • Warner Bros. was founded in April of 1923. • The name Warner Bros. honours the four founding Warner Brothers. • Warner Brothers is a subsidiary of the major media conglomerate Time Warner. • Warner Brothers itself has several subsidiary companies including Warner Bros. Studios and Warner Bros. Pictures. • Warner owns half of the Cartoon Network TV Network. • It is the worlds largest film and television studio. • Warner Brothers have been involved in producing some of the most successful films and franchises of all time. Such as the Harry Potter, The Matrix and Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.\n\n3. Why my product is suited for Warner Bros. My product will suit the ethos of Warner Bros. The company is a subsidiary of a big conglomerate in the film industry which will allow them to market the film well using synergy and be able to provide a large budget to ensure the film is the best it can be. This will help to attract the best actors in the industry to attract a large audience.\n\n4. Research in conventions of genre and form. After doing research into the conventions of action film trailers I have been able to gain extensive knowledge of what a successful action film trailer contains. This will enable me to produce a product that can easily attract the audience the film is targeting.\n\n5. Ideas for production work. • Set in LA California undercover cop Shane White must take on his biggest challenge ever. He must use his years of experience to exploit the most notorious drug dealer in America to gain his trust so that he can incarcerate him. Little does he know the challenges he faces to gain this psychopaths trust. • In post-apocalyptic America Tommy and Ellie must travel across the country to escape the infection. During the time they spend on the road they have to make decisions that differentiate friendship and survival.\n\n6. How will this use and/or challenge conventions? • This will use conventions of action films as it will contain high paced car chase scenes, fight sequences etc. • My product will use the conventions of an action film trailer by using fast paced editing and music that will help this. • My product will use the conventions of an action film as it will use costumes and props that are related to and suit the action film genre."
