        "text": "Spring is almost upon us, auguring a return to all things al fresco. To get you primed, look no further than Vogue’s list of the best nature documentaries.\n\nThe past few years have seen a real efflorescence of the nature documentary genre, with Oscar-nominated films like My Octopus Teacher, Fire of Love, and All That Breathes. That’s likely due at least in part to advances in camera technology and the rise of digital film, along with the rapidly growing consciousness that environmental concerns are of urgent importance to all of us. Vogue has curated this list of nonfiction films that go far beyond educational purposes and revel in the full majesty of the outdoors and the wonder of wildlife. Dive into the best nature documentaries, below.\n\nTaiga (1992)\n\nOver eight entrancing and transformative hours (one of my most cherished cinematic experiences), noted German avant-garde filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger explores with great sensitivity the life and rituals of nomadic peoples in northern Mongolia, in all their glorious, unhurried detail; she surveys the breathtaking landscape with no less rigor. A Letterboxd user put it best: “Eight hours of Mongolia and chill.” — Lisa Wong Macabasco\n\nThe Sounds of Science (2001)\n\nIn 1931, prolific scientist-director Jean Painlevé shot eight delightful, surrealist short films underwater, capturing phenomena both scary and sensual, including the birth of jellyfish and the mating rituals of octopi. Seven decades later, the seminal indie-rock band Yo La Tengo added an ingenious score, without knowing who Painlevé was or watching much of the films. Together it hits the sweet spot of educational, entertaining, and fascinating. —LWM\n\nMarch of the Penguins (2005)\n\nAmerican filmmaker Ken Burns spearheaded a docu-series of the United States’ National Parks, intermixing historical timelines with beautiful shots of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, and the Smoky Mountains. Narrated by Peter Coyote, with some voiceovers provided by Tom Hanks, the PBS series strays away from “Smokey Bear” educational promotion and leans more into the compelling stories that led to the creation of our National Park system. — CDG (Watch on Amazon.)\n\nCave of Forgotten Dreams (2010)\n\nA clear example of how 3D can come closest to approximating actually standing in front of something astonishing, this film from veteran director Werner Herzog follows an expedition into the nearly inaccessible Chauvet Cave in France, home to the oldest visual art known to be created by man. — LWM (Watch on Apple TV+)\n\nBlackfish (2013)"
