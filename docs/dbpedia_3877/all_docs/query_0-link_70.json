The film includes live-action footage of animals throughout the world, along with a ten-minute stop motion animated sequence about dinosaurs.\n\nIrwin's intention was to show the progression of life over time, although he told \"The New York Times\", \"We don't use the word 'evolution.' We hope to walk a very thin line. On one hand we want the scientists to say this film is right and accurate, and yet we don't want to have the church picketing the film.\" [Oscar Godbout. \"From primordial ooze to primates\". \"The New York Times\". 13 February 1955. p. 113.]\n\nDinosaur sequence\n\nThe special effects in the film's dinosaur sequence were produced by Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien. Irwin originally planned to film the scenes as a series of static dioramas with plastic models, but Harryhausen suggested that the scenes would be more memorable if they were animated. The dinosaurs that appear include an \"Allosaurus\", a \"Stegosaurus\", a pair of \"Ceratosaurs\", a \"Triceratops\", a \"Tyrannosaurus\", and a family of \"Brontosaurs\". [Roy P. Webber. \"The Dinosaur Films of Ray Harryhausen\". McFarland, 2004. p. 87.]\n\nFor many years, still shots from the segment were included in View-Master slide show reels. [Scott Shaw. \" [http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2000-07-05 The Animal World] \". \"Comic Book Resource\". Retrieved 2007-10-08.] Some of the footage was reused for the 1970 film \"Trog\", [Michael H. Price. \"Tape it\". \"The Fort Worth Star-Telegram\". 4 March 1995. Arts and Entertainment, p. 1.] and the entire sequence was released as an extra on the 2003 DVD release of \"The Black Scorpion\". [Randy A. Salas. \"Classic silent horror films make creepy mark on DVD\". \"The Augusta Chronicle\". 31 October 2003. p. A16]"
