        "text": "Note: All statements and opinions in this article are purely the author’s.\n\nWarner Bros. and Disney studios announced their theatrical distribution plans for 2021 with significantly different market and industry responses.\n\nWarner Bros. announced on December 3rd that they would be leveraging a hybrid release model for 17 theatrical titles for 2021 in which, the model “was created as a strategic response to the impact of the ongoing global pandemic, particularly in the U.S. Following the one month HBO Max access period domestically, each film will leave the platform and continue theatrically in the U.S. and international territories, with all customary distribution windows applying to the title.”\n\nAs a result, Warner Bros. experienced, and continues to experience, a bevy of backlash. Ann Sarnoff, Chairman and CEO of Warner Bros., responded with an explanation of how the new hybrid model would work as well as how the talent compensation model would be adjusted to take this new approach into consideration.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney’s release strategy for 2021 resulted in an increase in share value by nearly 14% after their Investor Day on December 10th. During this announcement, Disney stated that the Disney + direct-to-consumer offering had already well surpassed anticipated subscription numbers (86.8 million for Disney + and a total of 137 million subscribers across their streaming platforms) and that they would be releasing approximately 100 titles per year across multiple platforms.\n\nLet’s look at the plans and the assumptions made with each.\n\nWarner Bros. announcement was focused on the theatrical distribution model for 2021. It did not speak to other distribution methods nor content. The announcement was purely addressing the need to release movies in a year in which we anticipate the pandemic to continue to have a direct impact on whether or not movie theaters will be open, which affects if fans can view the films. Much of the backlash occurred within the media and entertainment industry among talent who were trying to understand how work developed for the ultimate experience on the big screen would be properly represented and how they would be compensated, since compensation deals were struck when movie theaters were open and thriving. According to reports, Warner Bros. didn’t notify talent of this change in distribution strategy until right before the announcement which didn’t provide time to address potential concerns.\n\nDisney’s announcement was inclusive of all distribution methods and all content. They were explicit in their statements that the focus would continue to be on direct-to-consumer platforms. This implies that they also are leveraging a hybrid model but one that’s executed in a very different manner so that there isn’t the potential for cannibalization among the distribution channels.\n\nSo What?\n\nWe need to take a step back and look at the broader strategies with these announcements. Disney’s was focused on a holistic view into all new content that’s planned to be distributed from 2021 through at least 2023. During their Investor Day call, they spoke about how they had restructured the organization to separate content creation from distribution. This strategic move enables Disney to look at content from the perspective of the fan. They can ask and answer, what brands fans are hungry for. Where are those fans engaging their favorite content and how can Disney make sure that the fans are getting consistent programming across these distribution channels? Thus, this enables a smoother transition from the classic business-to-business model (ie: movie theaters and retail chains) to the next gen of direct-to-consumer, which is evident in the focus on Disney’s streaming platforms.\n\nIn comparison, Warner Bros. announcement was only regarding theatrical releases. WarnerMedia has not announced the programming nor plans for the other content distribution methods including home entertainment, HBO Max, standard television shows, and partnerships with other streamers. After being launched on May 27th, 2020 and with 57 million global subscribers among HBO and HBO Max, WarnerMedia’s direct-to-consumer offering is barely an infant compared to the more mature streaming distribution channels offered by Disney and other content providers such as Netflix.\n\nBoth Warner Bros. and Disney are trying to provide fans fresh content featuring the characters and brands that they love. That said, based on the public and industry responses to both company’s strategies, there is a lesson in this – to view content creation and distribution holistically and from the perspective of the fan. As well as to ensure that key stakeholders are engaged in the decision making process so that they are heard and onboard.\n\nAt the end of the day, the fans are the ones who need to be happy since they are the ultimate consumer. And in today’s multifaceted and complex world, fans can obtain content from a wealth of distribution methods (phone, television, Apple TV, apps, movie theaters, CDs, DVDs, digital downloads, websites, TikTok, social media, on and on) and because of this, content providers need to ensure that their announcements take this into consideration and address distribution plans from a fan’s perspective.\n\nAbout the Author"
