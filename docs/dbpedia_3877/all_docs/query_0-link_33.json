        "text": "Text-to-Donate PSA, Auction, and On-Air Integrations Launching Ahead of Warner Bros. Pictures' Live-Action Movie “Barbie,” Only in Theaters July 21\n\nBurbank, CA – June 30, 2023 – Warner Bros. Discovery (Nasdaq: WBD), in connection with Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming movie 'Barbie,\" today announced it is launching a global girls’ empowerment initiative. The multi-faceted campaign, benefiting worldwide humanitarian organization Save the Children, will help girls around the world receive the learning resources and support they need to make their dreams a reality. Mattel, creator of the global icon Barbie and IP owner of the brand, has partnered with Save the Children for nearly two decades and launched the Barbie Dream Gap Project in 2018; they will partner with WBD on the new campaign.\n\nKicking off today, the campaign will receive global attention on WBD linear, digital, and social platforms. Initiatives include an in-show integration on HGTV’s “Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge,” consumer activations through brand partnerships, and a Charity Buzz auction that features tickets to the Los Angeles and London premieres of the movie “Barbie,” among other exciting items.\n\n\"Warner Bros. Discovery is a long-standing supporter of Save the Children, so we are tickled pink to tap into the movie ‘Barbie’ to inspire and nurture the limitless potential in young girls around the world,” said Louise Soper, Senior Vice President, Global Brand Partnerships for Warner Bros. Pictures. “From astronaut, journalist, entrepreneur, and now movie star, Barbie’s over 250 inspirational careers remind us that you can be whatever you want to be, and give back to your community too.\"\n\nAdditionally, stars of the movie “Barbie,” including Margot Robbie, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell, filmed a text-to-donate PSA that encourages viewers to text ‘Barbie’ to 707070 and join WBD in supporting the work of Save the Children. The PSAs will begin airing today on WBD platforms globally, from sports and streaming to cable and broadcast.\n\n\"Save the Children was established by a woman who believed she could accomplish things others didn’t believe were possible. That legacy still guides us today as we work to see girls everywhere embrace their potential,” said Luciana Bonifacio, Save the Children’s Chief Development Officer. “This is why we are excited to partner with Warner Bros. Discovery, Mattel, and the movie ‘Barbie’ to provide girls in the U.S. and around the world access to education and resources, encouraging them to believe in their own potential and achieve their dreams.\"\n\nAs the original girl empowerment brand, we couldn’t be more proud to join Warner Bros. Discovery during this exciting moment in Barbie’s history to support Save the Children,” said Lisa McKnight, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Barbie & Dolls, Mattel. “Barbie launched the Dream Gap Project with a global effort to level the playing field for girls, which cannot be done alone. Together, Mattel and Warner Bros. Discovery are partnering with Save the Children to help girls reach their full potential.\"\n\nIn the U.S., the partnership will support Save the Children’s early education, summer and after school programming to ensure children and their families have the resources and support needed to reach their goals. Internationally, it will support Save the Children’s girls’ empowerment programming by providing services across education, health, justice and child protection sectors.\n\nThe campaign is led by WBD’s Social Impact Solutions team, which is dedicated to global cause marketing campaigns engaging viewers, advertisers and business partners to move the needle on key social issues. By leveraging WBD’s iconic brands, franchises and global platforms in partnership with NGOs and charities, the team provides critical resources and needs to communities around the world. Social Impact Solutions’ core philanthropic focus areas address food insecurity, disaster relief and mental health and well-being.\n\nTo learn more about the movie “Barbie” visit https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/barbie.\n\nTo Donate to Save the Children, visit\n\nhttps://www.pledge.to/save-the-children-us\n\nAbout Warner Bros.
