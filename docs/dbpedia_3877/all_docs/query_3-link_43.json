        "text": "Topline\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is planning two new live-action “Lord of the Rings” movies, with the first eyeing a potential 2026 release—marking the blockbuster series’ first new film in a decade, directed by and starring Andy Serkis, who starred in the original trilogy of the early 2000s, and featuring that trilogy’s director Peter Jackson as a producer.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.Report the details...\n\nBig Number\n\n$6 billion. That’s how much the “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” trilogies—both set in author J.R.R. Tolkien’s world of Middle Earth—grossed, making it among the top 20 highest grossing movie franchises of all time. The third entry in the “Lord of the Rings,” the 2003 film “Return of the King” won 11 Oscars that year, including Best Picture, tying “Titanic” and “Ben-Hur” for the most in history.\n\nKey Background\n\nZaslav has emphasized the importance of “Lord of the Rings” as a central part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s future strategy, claiming it, along with the “Harry Potter” franchise and DC Comics, are some of the struggling legacy media company’s biggest IP assets but are currently “underused.” The last movie set in Middle Earth was the final entry in the Hobbit trilogy, “the Battle of the Five Armies,” which came out in 2014. Warner is also rebooting the “Harry Potter” franchise with a new TV series on its Max streaming service that’s also eyeing a 2026 release, following up on the decade-long run of movies based on J.K. Rowling’s book series that was released from 2001 to 2011. Additionally, the company has tapped director James Gunn to reboot its movies based around the DC Comics superheroes, with a new Superman movie set to be released next year.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nWarner Bros. and New Line Cinema are releasing a new animated “Lord of the Rings” movie called “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” which will be released this Christmas. Any new “Lord of the Rings” will also have to contend with Amazon Prime’s “The Rings of Power,” a TV series set thousands of years before the events of “Lord of the Rings,” which has cost Amazon nearly $1 billion and is considered to be the most expensive show of all time. Season two is set to premiere later this year after season one earned generally positive reviews from critics but became the target of online controversy over its diverse cast.\n\nTangent"
