        "text": "Animal Logic has announced that the next project produced in their Vancouver studio will be Toto, the animated musical adaptation of Michael Morpurgo and Emma Chichester Clark’s 2017 book, “Toto: The Dog-Gone Amazing Story of the Wizard of Oz.”\n\nA family film told from the perspective of Dorothy’s beloved companion, the screenplay was written by John August, with two-time Tony nominee, Alex Timbers, attached to direct. The film will be produced by Derek Frey, who previously headed-up Tim Burton Productions.\n\nPre-production has begun, with Timbers currently meeting key creatives and producers in Vancouver and recruitment of artists and practitioners ramping up over the next few months.\n\nToto is the latest addition to the 20+ year old partnership between Animal Logic and Warner Bros. The Vancouver studio is currently in production on an animated film based on the DC Super Pets franchise, directed by Jared Stern and set for release in 2022. Known internationally as a digital hub, particularly for animation, Vancouver’s strong talent pool has allowed the studio to continue its growth and success alongside their Sydney headquarters.\n\nSource: Animal Logic"
