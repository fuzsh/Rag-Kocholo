        "text": "The U.S. motion-picture studio Warner Brothers played a pivotal role in the development of the Hollywood film industry. In 1927 the young studio revolutionized film by introducing the first genuine talking picture, The Jazz Singer.\n\nThe company was founded by four brothers, Harry (1881–1958), Albert (1884–1967), Samuel (1888–1927), and Jack Warner (1892–1978), who were the sons of Benjamin Eichelbaum, an immigrant Polish cobbler and peddler. The brothers began their careers showing moving pictures in Ohio and Pennsylvania on a traveling basis. Beginning in 1903 they started acquiring movie theaters, and they then moved into film distribution. In about 1913 they began producing their own films, and in 1917 they shifted their production headquarters to Hollywood, Calif. They established Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., in 1923. The oldest of the brothers, Harry, was the president of the company and ran its headquarters in New York City, while Albert was its treasurer and head of sales and distribution. Sam and Jack managed the studio in Hollywood.\n\nWhen the company ran into financial difficulties in the mid-1920s, Sam Warner persuaded his brothers to collaborate in developing a patent on a process (Vitaphone) that made talkies possible. The studio’s Don Juan (1926) opened with a completely synchronized musical sound track, and The Jazz Singer (1927) had both synchronized music and dialogue. (Sam died only 24 hours before the latter’s premiere.) Warner Brothers then made Lights of New York (1928), the first full-length all-talking film, and On with the Show (1929), the first all-talking color film. The enormous financial success of these early sound films enabled Warner Brothers to become a major motion picture studio. By the 1930s Warner Brothers was producing about 100 motion pictures a year and controlled 360 theaters in the United States and more than 400 abroad.\n\nWarner Brothers became known for its tightly budgeted, technically competent entertainment films. In the early 1930s the company started the craze for gangster films with Little Caesar (1930), The Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932), and throughout the decade it presented films featuring such stars as James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson in gangster roles. In the 1930s Warner Brothers also presented Busby Berkeley’s musical extravaganzas, many swashbuckling and adventure films starring Errol Flynn, and dramas featuring such stars as Paul Muni, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, and John Garfield.\n\nAmong the studio’s best-known films of the 1940s and 1950s were The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), Watch on the Rhine (1943), and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The studio’s later box-office successes included My Fair Lady (1964), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Exorcist (1973), The Color Purple (1985), and The Fugitive (1993).\n\nJack Warner was Warner’s longtime vice president in charge of production and became the company’s president in 1956, after the last of his older brothers had retired. He retired in 1972. Meanwhile, Warner Brothers had undergone various corporate changes and had diversified into television programming, book publishing, and musical recordings by the 1970s. In 1969 it became Warner Bros. Inc., a subsidiary of Warner Communications Inc. In 1989 the latter company merged with Time Inc. to form Time Warner Inc., the largest media and entertainment corporation in the world. Time Warner inaugurated the WB, a broadcast television network, in 1995."
