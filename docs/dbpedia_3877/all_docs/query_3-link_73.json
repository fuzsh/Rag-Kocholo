        "text": "When I started out in film and television back in the 90s and 2000s, there was a backlash in the industry against filming and editing with video: I heard it from the directors of photography (DOPs) and I heard it from the editors: “I’ll never shoot on video!” “I’ll never cut (edit) on video!” Same when we moved to digital. It’s taken over 20 years, but now pretty much everything is digital. Video cameras, video quality, delivery, and edit systems have all improved tremendously and there’s no mistaking that shooting and editing on video have streamlined processes and timelines and garnered terrific cost savings.\n\nFrom a distribution standpoint, we’ve seen many changes in video technology, from the format wars between Beta and VHS to Videodisc, DVD, Blu Ray, and now giant streaming services -- and all the while, old-school movie theatres have adapted to sell us not just the movies, the experience of going to the movies.\n\nWith high speed internet it’s been easier and easier to watch on our much bigger small screens: when you’re watching on a 50-inch 4K with 5.1 surround, why would we leave home? COVID didn’t create the problem of fewer people going out to the movies, but it certainly compressed the timeframe. A lot.\n\nNobody could have predicted that 2020 would bring a global pandemic that would virtually shut down movie theaters all over the US and Canada. But that’s what happened. 10 months of COVID-19 and no end in sight, even with vaccines being approved and distributed as I write. So who could blame Warner Brothers for pivoting their distribution model for 2021? They happen to own a streaming service: the relatively new HBO Max, with 12 million subscribers (up from 8 million a few short months ago). Having a slate of new first-run films, beginning with Wonder Woman 1984, that can run both in movie theaters and on Max is a great way for them to grow the streaming service and ensure word of mouth on the movies.\n\nThe Warner movies will run on HBO Max at the same time that they’re in theatres -- but for only one month, then they’ll be in the theatres exclusively.\n\nDisney has made a similar pivot, though on a different scale: during the Investors Meeting in early December, Disney announced that it would be focusing on its streaming content, being mindful that part of their strategy on a go-forward would be to develop series and movies from the beginning specifically for release on the small screen–meaning that Creatives are building their projects from the beginning with this plan in mind. And that’s where Warner got into trouble.\n\nWhen Warner pivoted, they did so without consulting their creative partners beforehand. Agents and producers learned of the move only 90 minutes before Warner announced it publicly. Warner’s creative and producing partners, especially those who made profit-participation deals that rely on box office, feel like they’ve been dealt with in bad faith. Director Christopher Nolan released a statement that made for some sensational headlines: “Christopher Nolan Rips HBO Max as \"Worst Streaming Service,\" Denounces Warner Bros.' Plan.” (The Hollywood Reporter), or “Furious Christopher Nolan Blasts HBO Max as the ‘Worst Streaming Service’” (Vanity Fair).\n\nLet’s look behind the headlines, though. Here’s what Nolan said:\n\n“Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service … Warner Bros. had an incredible machine for getting a filmmaker’s work out everywhere, both in theaters and in the home, and they are dismantling it as we speak. They don’t even understand what they’re losing. Their decision makes no economic sense, and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction.”\n\nWarner apparently did make deals with some of their bigger players, like Wonder Woman 1984 star Gal Godot. But only after the news went public.\n\nThe biggest differences between the Disney situation and Warner Brothers? Well, there’s the transparency and communication part. There’s also a difference in the way they’re handling rollout: Disney has specifically held off on releasing major blockbusters (like the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 4) until it’s safe to be in cinemas again -- betting on the vaccine and the world returning to normal for projects like Black Widow and Shang-Chi, where big opening weekends are desired and expected. While Disney did do a special release of the live-action Mulan remake on Disney+ this summer, this isn’t their standard model for going forward. And even Disney+ subscribers paid a premium: $30 for access to the movie in September. It has only just been made available free to subscribers.\n\nDisney+ has an incredible back catalogue of Disney movies including the Lucasfilm and Pixar catalogues, and with Jon Favreau’s breakout Star Wars series The Mandalorian, has now boosted its subscriber base to over 86 million in just over a year (compare with streaming giant Netflix at 195 million subs and runner-up Amazon Prime at 150 million). HBO Max has 12.6 million active subscribers in December 2020 -- not really in the same ballpark.\n\nSo Nolan and Warner’s other talent have a point. They expected (or hoped) their movies would be seen by 20 million people in domestic theatres, and anticipated being paid based on the performance. Some already have deals that will take care of them. Others don’t.\n\nFact: companies need to pivot. And like the evolution of shooting and editing on film to video - how films are being distributed, found and seen needs to evolve. While timelines have been compressed, what should not be overlooked in all of this is that companies big and small need to respect their stakeholders, teams, and creatives with transparency and open communication throughout the process.\n\nAnd as far as I know, Wonder Woman 1984 isn’t streaming in Canada this Christmas."
