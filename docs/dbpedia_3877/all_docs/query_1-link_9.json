        "text": "Fifteen minutes into 'Animal', protagonist Rannvijay -- played by Ranbir Kapoor -- tells his love interest Geetanjali that she has a \"big pelvis\", which means she can bear \"healthy children\". Visibly impressed by him boasting about his \"alpha male\" characteristics, Geetanjali -- played by Rashmika Mandanna -- calls off her engagement and elopes with Rannvijay.\n\nThe docile manner in which she unquestioningly accepts Rannvijay's machoistic bragging is problematic. Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga has never shied away from portraying problematic characters and issues in his films. But 'Animal' takes it to an entirely different level.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Vanga directorial is facing severe criticism over its portrayal of toxicity and violence. No film has faced this kind of non-political backlash in recent years.\n\nDoes 'Animal' take creative liberty too far? Is it the right way in which character problems should be highlighted? Why this hue and cry over 'Animal' if we have savoured Quentin Tarantino's movies?\n\nThe problem with 'Animal' is the way in which it deals with the issues and glorifies male chauvinism, violence in relationships and misogyny.\n\n\"What is the film saying? This type of Neanderthal Alpha-male behaviour is to be condoned? To be considered love?,\" said novelist Shobhaa De in her NOT a film review.\n\nRannvijay's character has qualms with his father, Balbir Singh, for being a rude, dismissive and absent figure in his life.\n\nTo be acknowledged by his father, the character goes above and beyond, shoots hundreds, axes another bunch of men, and commits infidelity (yes, he attributes that to the threat to his father's life).\n\n\"A film that seems to be made by an animal for animal is already giving animals a bad name because animals don't behave like that,\" De further remarks.\n\nDe was trolled for her remarks.\n\nANIMAL'S PROBLEMATIC PLOT\n\nRannvijay seeks his father Balbir's love and attention and when someone attempts to kill Balbir, all hell breaks loose, and Vanga's world emerges on the screen. This world has Rannvijay shooting down enemies and issuing death threats on live TV, with the police being conspicuously absent.\n\nApart from being problematic, Animal is loaded with 'plotholes', has no storyline, and is far from being realistic. Bobby Deol as the villain, Abrar, is so underutilised, that Rannvijay looks like the real villain.\n\n\"You are fighting ghosts inside your head, do you even realise that?,\" actor Rashmika Mandanna's character Geetanjali tells her husband Rannvijay in the film, exactly what the audience is thinking of as it eagerly looks for a storyline and context, to justify the hype around the film.\n\nWas Geetanjali's comment of \"fighting ghosts inside your head\" directed at director Vanga?\n\nTOO MUCH LIBERTY WITH CREATIVE LIBERTY?\n\nAfter Vanga's previous films 'Arjun Reddy' and its Hindi remake 'Kabir Singh' faced criticism for being misogynistic, he took it up 100 notches when he made 'Animal'.\n\nThe Telugu director wanted to come off as unapologetic, but with 'Animal' lacking the basic requirements that make up a film, he only came off as ignorant and delusional.\n\nDespite multiple triggering scenes and problematic dialogues, the number of people in awe of 'Animal' surpasses the vocal minority criticising it.\n\nWhile some did not find the film problematic altogether, others chose to look at it from the lens of \"creative freedom\" and \"artistic choice\". That has made several people question if Vanga has taken too much liberty with creative liberty.\n\nADDRESSING MISOGYNY\n\nMisogyny and patriarchy exist in society, so they should be given space on screen as well. In the right context, showing flawed characters makes viewers question them.\n\n'Animal', however, glorifies misogyny and patriarchy.\n\nWith a romantic background score, when Rannvijay is pulling his wife's bra straps to hurt her, or when he asks another woman to lick his shoe to prove that she \"loves\" him, the film makes his intentions clear.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat we see on screen impacts us. Most media effects theories talk about the impact various forms of communication leave on people.\n\nReacting to an old video of 'Animal' director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, mental health expert and therapist Divija Bhasin shared her take on Instagram.\n\n\"Slapping in love is not love. It's abuse. Love is not about doing anything you want. It is about respect. On both sides. With zero violence,\" the expert says in the video.\n\nShe was reacting to an old interview by Vanga, where he said, \"If you don't have the liberty of slapping each other (in relationships), I don't see anything there.\"\n\nAbuse is abuse, not love, period.\n\nIMPACT OF VIOLENCE IN FILMS\n\nGore and violence in films are nothing new. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino is known for cinema that is loaded with scenes that have dead bodies lying around, with blood spattered across the screen.\n\nKill Bill (Vol 1,2), Inglorious Bastards, Django Unchained and Pulp Fiction are some of his prominent works. So what sets them apart from 'Animal'? The context.\n\nViolence in 'Animal' appears out of nowhere, and is loosely linked to the actual plot.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe film's plot is based on the disturbing father-son dynamic. But when scenes of violence suddenly appear on the screen, without any context, viewers can hardly remember why it is happening in the first place.\n\nMIRROR TO SOCIETY\n\nFilms are a visual medium, and more often than not, a reflection of reality. 'Animal' also shows several evils, but it is not like such evils are purely fictional and do not exist in reality. Misogyny, patriarchy, entitlement, problematic relationships, toxic behaviour and saviour complex are deep-rooted in society.\n\n\"It’s not the movie. It’s us. ‘Animal’ has exposed the rotten in society. People are misogynistic. Directors are opportunistic. Box office knows no morality. India is massively influenced by ‘mob’ mentality. Real is reel. For reel to look better, Real must change,\" wrote RJ Sayema in a post on X, as she reviewed the film.\n\nSo is it wrong to show what is true? Absolutely not.\n\nCinema, especially commercial films, is a huge market. If this platform is being used to voice social concerns through a story, there is nothing better.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, 'Animal' does not show such behavioural patterns as \"evils\". It promotes and glorifies them.\n\nIf Sandeep Reddy Vanga's 'Kabir Singh' and 'Arjun Reddy' glorified violence in love, 'Animal' goes a mile further and justifies Rannvijay's bad behaviour towards his partner, mother and women in general, as it regularly keeps reminding the audience of his \"daddy\" issues.\n\nDOES 'ANIMAL' GO TOO FAR?\n\n'Animal' received mixed reviews. It is, however, different from films that have received mixed reviews, as people who watched the film had extreme opinions about it. While some hail everything it embodies, others are totally against the film becoming a commercial success at the cost of morality.\n\nSo does the film go too far, or is it subjective? As an audience, one can choose to like or dislike a film. Nevertheless, a film-maker has responsibility towards society when he tells a story.\n\nFour months after Sandeep Reddy Vanga's 'Kabir Singh' got released, a Tik Tok star in Uttar Pradesh murdered a Dubai-based flight attendant who he was obsessed with.\n\nThe Tik Tok star was heavily influenced by Shahid Kapoor's 'Kabir Singh' and often posted dialogues from the film on his account, police found during the investigation.\n\nWhen a film justifies bad behaviour and becomes a huge commercial success, there is more risk that some sections of society may draw inspiration from it.\n\nIn an unrelated discussion, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap recently said, \"Buying a film ticket is like voting, what you buy is what will be made.\"\n\n'Animal' has become a huge hit, approaching the Rs 500-crore collection mark. So, do we take it as a vote of confidence for a film that is being panned for glorifying violence and promoting misogyny and toxicity?"
