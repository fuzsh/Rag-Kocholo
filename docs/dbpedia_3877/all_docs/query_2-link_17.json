        "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. (WBD) is a global media and entertainment company that provides content through a variety of different distribution platforms, including television, film, and streaming. The company's media is available in more than 220 countries and territories and in 50 different languages, making it one of the most widely available platforms in the world.\n\nSome of the company's most prominent brands include HBO, CNN, Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TNT, TBS, Animal Planet, Warner Bros. Television Group, DC Comics, Warner Bros. Film Group, Cartoon Network, and Turner Classic Movies.\n\nThe company's formation dates back to 2022, when WarnerMedia, a division of AT&T Inc. (T), merged with Discovery, creating the new, standalone entity, Warner Bros. Discovery. The $43 billion blockbuster merger combined Discovery’s prominent brands with HBO, Warner Bros., DC Comics, and other popular brands owned by WarnerMedia.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery competes with other production studios, television networks, and online-based content providers to develop, acquire, and distribute premium content. Some of the company’s competitors include The Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, Paramount Global (PARA), DISH Network Corp. (DISH), Netflix (NLFX), Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+. and China-based Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG).\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery’s Financials\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery announced in late Aug. 2023 its financial results for the second quarter (Q2) of its 2023 fiscal year (FY), the three-month period that ended on June 30, 2023. The company reported a net loss of $1.2 billion for Q2 2023, which was an improvement when compared to the $3.4 billion loss in Q2 2022. This was a 63.7% reduction in losses. Quarterly revenue grew 5.4% compared to the year-ago quarter, rising to $10.4 billion.\n\nThe company also reports adjusted earnings before income taxes and depreciation (EBITDA), a measure of profitability that focuses on a company’s core activities. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter rose 29% to $2.1 billion.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery’s Business Segments\n\nThe company has four reportable segments: Studios, Networks, Direct-to-Consumer, Corporate, and Inter-Segment Eliminations. Each of these segments reports revenue by the following categories: Distributions, Advertising, Content, and Other.\n\nStudios\n\nThe company's Studio segment involves the production and release of films, the production and initial licensing of television to third parties, the distribution of films and televisions to third parties, including streaming services, interactive gaming, and related consumer products and themed experience licensing.\n\nThe Studios segment reported revenues of $2.6 billion in Q2 2023, a decrease of 7.7% from the same period in 2022. This segment accounts for 24.9% of the company's total revenue. The segment reported an adjusted EBITDA of $306 million; an increase of 28% year-over-year (YOY). The Studios segment accounts for 14.2% of total adjusted EBITDA.\n\nNetworks\n\nThe Networks segment consists of the company's domestic and international television networks.\n\nThe Networks segment reported revenues of $5.8 billion in Q2 2023; by far the highest revenue-generating segment for the company. This was an increase of 0.28% YOY. Networks accounts for 55.6% of the company's total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for Networks was $2.2 billion; a decrease of 4.2% YOY. The Networks segment accounts for over 100% of total adjusted EBITDA as other segments reported EBITDA losses.\n\nDirect-to-Consumer (DTC)\n\nThe DTC segment comprises the company's premium pay-TV and streaming services.\n\nDTC contributed 26.4% of total revenues, bringing in $2.7 billion for Q2 2023; an increase of 22.8% YOY. The segment reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3 million. This was a significant improvement when compared to the adjusted EBITDA loss of $518 million in Q2 2022.\n\nCorporate\n\nThe Corporate segment is made up of executive management and administrative support services.\n\nThe Corporate segment is negligible in regard to the company's revenues and earnings. This segment did not bring in any revenues but rather due to the company's reporting methods, recorded a loss of $1 million in revenues, which was a significant decrease when compared to the $13 million in revenues it brought in in Q2 2022. Similarly, the segment reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $245 million, which was an improvement compared to the $305 million loss in Q2 2022.\n\nInter-Segment Eliminations\n\nInter-Segment Eliminations consists of inter-segment content transactions, as well as marketing and promotion between reportable segments.\n\nSimilar to the corporate segment, the Inter-Segment Eliminations segment is negligible when it comes to the company's revenues and earnings. The segment did not earn any revenues, but the company reported a sales loss of $712 million, a slight improvement when compared to the $949 million loss in Q2 2022.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA loss reported in Q2 2023 was $75 million, a decrease when compared to the $14 million loss reported in Q2 2022.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's Recent Developments\n\nIn Sept. 2023, the company announced plans to expand its Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, which is a film and television studio in the U.K. The expansion will include 10 new sound stages and an additional 400,000 square feet of production and support space, which will increase the studio's capacity by 50%.\n\nThis studio serves as an important hub for the company, which recently shot big-budget movies and shows, such as \"Barbie,\" \"House of the Dragon,\" and \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.\""
