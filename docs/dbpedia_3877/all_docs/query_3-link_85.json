        "text": "2023 sees the centenary of Warner Bros., one of the most iconic film studios in cinema history. To mark the occasion, Warner Bros. Discovery are planning a series of film re-releases, restorations, concerts, and more, in cinemas across the country and on home entertainment.\n\nWarner Bros. was founded by Albert, Sam, Harry and Jack Warner and incorporated on 4 April 1923. Today, the studio, which is part of Warner Bros. Discovery, is home to one of the most successful collections of brands in the world and stands at the forefront of every aspect of the entertainment industry, from feature film, television and direct-to-consumer production to animation, comic books, videogames, consumer products, themed entertainment, studio tours and brand licensing. The Studio's vast library, one of the most prestigious and valuable in the world, consists of more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprised of more than 150,000 individual episodes. Warner Bros. is also home to one of the most diverse portfolios of adored franchises in the world, including Looney Tunes, Wizarding World, DC, FRIENDS, Game of Thrones, Hanna-Barbera and many more.\n\nInto Film is proud to host a large number of Warner Bros. titles from throughout their history on Into Film+ and Into Film+ Premium*, all of which are available to stream for free** for schools that hold a valid Public Video Screening (PVS) Licence. Titles on Into Film+ feature accompanying film discussion guides and other resources. Here are a selection of some the Warner Bros. Favourites we have available.\n\nNew to Into Film+ streaming? Find out how to get started\n\nClassic Animations: From beloved characters such as Tom & Jerry and Bugs Bunny, to classic cartoons Scooby -Doo and Animaniacs, amongst many others, animation has always been central to Warner Bros' identity, on the big and small screens. Adapted from the classic Ted Hughes story, The Iron Man, The Iron Giant is regarded by many as one of the finest animations ever made and has been one of the most popular titles for Into Film since our inception. Equally popular are the adorable Happy Feet films, and the brilliantly subversive The LEGO® Movie. The world of animation was changed forever in 2004 with the release of The Polar Express, the first movie to be entirely filmed with motion-capture technology, and it has gone on to become one of the most popular and enduring Christmas films. Finally, Teen Titans Go! to the Movies brought another of Warner Bros's most popular cartoons onto the big screen, with wonderfully satirical results that delights children and adults alike.\n\nThe LEGO® Movie\n\nStream on Into Film+\n\n2,905 reviews\n\nAn ordinary LEGO® minifigure, mistakenly thought to be the Master Builder, is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil LEGO® tyrant.\n\n2,905 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group5–14 years\n\nDuration100 mins\n\nRead More\n\nThe Iron Giant\n\nStream on Into Film+\n\n5,113 reviews\n\nSuperbly animated adaptation following young Hogarth's discovery of a colossal, friendly robot, and his plight to protect him from government agents.\n\n5,113 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group5–14 years\n\nDuration86 mins\n\nRead More\n\nTeen Titans Go To The Movies: Guide (SEN\n\nA film guide that looks at Teen Titans Go! To The Movies (2018), exploring its key topics and themes through informal discussion.\n\n1 ppt\n\nView resource\n\nFamily Favourites: Away from the world of animation, there is a rich history of live-action family films that have been passed down amongst generations, such as Roald Dahl adaptations Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and The Witches. Sticking with British literature, 1993's The Secret Garden continues to enchant young audiences with its magical adventures, as does the Harry Potter franchise, the first three films of which are available on Into Film+ Premium. American children's literature is represented with Spike Jonze's Where The Wild Things Are, adapted from the famous Maurice Sendak picture book. Turning to documentary, look no further than the beautiful March of the Penguins, which continues to inspire awe with its images of penguins surviving in the Antarctic. And no list of legendary family films would be complete without Elf!\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nStream on Into Film+ Premium\n\n2,113 reviews\n\nA recently-orphaned 10-year-old girl is sent to live at her uncle’s grand estate in Yorkshire where she discovers secrets within its grounds.\n\n2,113 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group7–14 years\n\nDuration97 mins\n\nRead More\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nStream on Into Film+ Premium\n\n887 reviews\n\nThird film in the franchise in which Harry learns of a dangerous criminal who has escaped from the highest-security prison in the wizarding world.\n\n887 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group7–14 years\n\nDuration136 mins\n\nRead More\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are: Film Guide\n\nA film guide that looks at Where the Wild Things Are (2009), exploring its key topics and themes through informal discussion.\n\n1 ppt\n\nView resource\n\nLiterary Adaptations: Film adaptations of literary texts can be hugely beneficial for young people studying these works. Younger students are likely to be familiar with the classic World War One novel A Little Princess, and director Alfonso Cuarón's beautiful adaptation has long held a place in the hearts of Into Film audiences. A Streetcar Named Desire rightly remains a staple of the curriculum. The film adaptation starring Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh is- a masterclass of adaptation. Baz Luhrmann's remarkable interpretation of The Great Gatsby was a characteristically audacious and intoxicating adaptation that breathed new life into a classic text. Equally radical was the 2009 reimagining of Sherlock Holmes, starring Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr, also available on Into Film+ Premium. Finally, few literary adaptations have been as commercially and critically successful as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson changing the face of blockbuster cinema.\n\nA Little Princess\n\nStream on Into Film+ Premium\n\n1,071 reviews\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, a young girl is forced to leave her home in India and attend boarding school in New York.\n\n1,071 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group5–11 years\n\nDuration93 mins\n\nRead More\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nStream on Into Film+ Premium\n\n59 reviews\n\nAn extravagant adaptation of F.

There are few directors more universally revered than Alfred Hitchcock. Into Film+ hosts one of his greatest films, the timeless North By Northwest, alongside a discussion with Cary Grant expert and film academic Charlotte Crofts, ideal material for any Film Studies students. The partnership between Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros. resulted in a series of iconic and distinctive films, including the unforgettable The Shining. Kubrick collaborated with another beloved auteur, Steven Spielberg, for A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a film that becomes more fascinating and relevant to modern lives with each viewing. Staying with science-fiction, British director Ridley Scott's Blade Runner remains one of the most hauntingly beautiful science-fictions ever made, as fascinatingly complex as Christopher Nolan's Inception. Nolan has also turned his attention to the war film, with the gripping Dunkirk. New Zealand director Peter Jackson moved from the world of fantasy into archive documentary, with the pioneering They Shall Not Grow Old, using original footage from the World War One trenches to present the soldiers experiences to modern audiences in ways never seen before.\n\nDunkirk\n\nStream on Into Film+ Premium\n\n87 reviews\n\nA rescue mission involving hundreds of thousands of British Allied soldiers takes place on the beaches of Dunkirk at the height of World War Two.\n\n87 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group14+ years\n\nDuration106 mins\n\nRead More\n\nThey Shall Not Grow Old\n\nStream on Into Film+\n\n6 reviews\n\nAstonishing archive-led documentary which celebrates the efforts of those involved in World War One on its centenary.\n\n6 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group14+ years\n\nDuration99 mins\n\nRead More\n\nNorth by Northwest: Film Guide\n\nA film guide that looks at North by Northwest (1959), exploring its key topics and themes through informal discussion.\n\n1 ppt\n\nView resource\n\nFilm History: Warner Bros. has been responsible for some of the most culturally significant Hollywood films ever made, many of which continue to be staples of Film Studies curricular. Released in 1942, the endlessly quotable Casablanca remains one of the most enduring movies of all time, continuing to entrance audiences today, more than 80 years on from its release. The 1950s saw teen icon James Dean project youthful anxiety and rebellion in ways never before seen on screen, in Rebel Without A Cause. More than a decade later, the violent, electric, Bonnie & Clyde set in motion what came to be known as The New Hollywood, and an era of mainstream filmmaking like no other. Fast forward to 1999, and The Wachowski siblings altered the face of science-fiction cinema and anticipated many of today's cultural anxieties with the exhilarating The Matrix, a feat equalled in 2015 with action cinema by George Miller and his pulsating Mad Max: Fury Road. Bringing film history up-to-date is Lin Manuel Miranda's In The Heights, a riotous celebration of cultural heritage and community that both calls back to the musical films that came before it as well as keeping the genre firmly rooted in the present day.\n\nCasablanca\n\nStream on Into Film+\n\n105 reviews\n\nIn Nazi-occupied Morocco, an American expatriate is reacquainted with his former lover, plus her husband, as they seek safe passage to the US.\n\n105 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group14+ years\n\nDuration98 mins\n\nRead More\n\nThe Matrix\n\nStream on Into Film+ Premium\n\n202 reviews\n\nInfluential sci-fi in which a programmer is recruited by a crew of enigmatic rebels who reveal that the world in which he lives isn't reality.\n\n202 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group14+ years\n\nDuration130 mins\n\nRead More\n\nIn the Heights\n\nStream on Into Film+\n\n4 reviews\n\nModern-day musical following a group of young Latin-Americans living in a New York City neighbourhood who are striving to get more out of their lives.\n\n4 reviews\n\nCertificate\n\nAge group11+ years\n\nDuration143 mins\n\nRead More\n\nHow Do I Get Started?\n\nTo access Into Film+, all you'll need is an Into Film Account - it's completely free*, and only takes a moment to set up.
