        "text": "Background\n\nWarner Bros. Family Entertainment was the family production arm of Warner Bros. Entertainment that was established in 1992 under Time Warner Entertainment a year after its overseas distribution deal with Buena Vista International, in which Warner distributed Disney and Touchstone films in overseas territories, expired. It handled kids & family-oriented movies and television shows, mostly animated, along with some live-action releases. However, after a string of box-office flops, the company made WBFE a direct-to-video/DVD and kids-oriented TV show-only label, and started using their normal unit for theatrical releases, starting with My Dog Skip. They still distributed films in international territories, mostly Germany; their last theatrical release was 2009's Laura's Star and the Mysterious Dragon Nian. Afterwards, family-oriented productions were moved back to the normal Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Bros. Animation names (and later, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation), whereas direct-to-video productions moved to Warner Premiere (and later, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment).\n\n1st Logo (September 14, 1992-August 11, 2001)\n\nVisuals: A bannerless WB shield is shown, as usual, posed against the sky. Then Bugs Bunny (in the same tuxedo from the Happy Birthday Bugs logo) leans over the shield, puts a hoop-like, wordless banner around it, and spins it around as the byline \"A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\" fades in under the logo. Then Bugs steps to the left from under the shield, does a Vanna White-like pose, and puts his hand on the banner as it stops to reveal the words \"FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT\". Bugs keeps his hand on it as he leans, brandishes a carrot and takes a bite on it as the banner shines.\n\nVariants:\n\nA more common version starts with the banner already on the shield which displays the inscribed words; after the byline fades in as usual, the logo continues per se with Bugs Bunny's usual pose and animation. The shield in this version is bigger with the byline smaller.\n\nA medium-length version that was used for trailers and TV spots exists, in which the shield is smaller and the byline is bigger. In addition, the banner also does not shine.\n\nAn abridged version exists, which was used to open TV series in the '90s (the logo forming with Bugs Bunny already doing his usual routine along with the shining ribbon). Sometimes, the banner does not shine.\n\nA version without Bugs Bunny also exists, which can be found at the end of the 1995 Looney Tunes short Carrotblanca, with the \"That's all Folks!\" script written on top of it. The shield opens with a nervous-looking Tweety inside of it, saying \"That's all Folks!\" and laughing (in his Peter Lorre/Usmarte impression), the shield closes, and then \"A WARNER BROS. CARTOON\" appears on the bottom-right corner. The shield, in this case, is noticeably hand-drawn.\n\nA noticeably digitally remastered version with no shining ribbon exists, which was used from 1999 to 2001. Plus, the ribbon does not cast a shadow on the shield and the byline is also in a different typeface. This was basically an abridged version of the Wakko's Wish custom variation, but without Wakko at the right of the shield.\n\nA videotaped variant of the logo exists, which was seen on The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show in the late '90s.\n\nA full unmatted variant exists.\n\nA French version of the byline also exists.\n\nTechnique: Traditional animation by Bill Waldman at Warner Bros. Classic Animation.\n\nAudio: A symphonic, majestic arrangement of \"Merrily We Roll Along\" by Richard Stone plus the sound of Bugs chomping on his carrot. Originally, a fishing reel sound (with soft whooshing sounds) can be heard when Bugs spins the banner.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn 1992, an abridged version of \"Merrily We Roll Along\" was used on some TV shows and specials.\n\nAlmost every other show with the abridged version has a rearrangement of the sting used to close out Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1990s composed by husband and wife Steven and Julie Bernstein. The piece consists of a timpani and harp crescendo, a four-note brass fanfare, a piano crescendo, and tuba hit with the normal carrot crunching sound effect still used. Amazon prints of Waynehead use a low pitched version.\n\nOn the 1996 WB cartoon Road Rovers, an electric guitar riff that sounds very little like the Road Rovers theme song plays over this logo.\n\nOn the medium-length version, the fanfare is shortened and faster-paced.\n\nOn Black Beauty (1994), the logo is completely silent.\n\nThe show's end theme played over it on 1993-2000 episodes of The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show.\n\nThe Looney Tunes shorts featuring this logo use an arrangement of Max Steiner's fanfare for the 1937 Warner Bros. Pictures logo.\n\nOn The Adventures of Batman & Robin (a.k.a. the last eleven episodes of season 2 of Batman: The Animated Series), the short music is rearranged.\n\nA Finnish TV spot for the VHS release of The Pebble and the Penguin (1995) has Leo's 1995 roar from the 1986 MGM logo due to sloppy plastering. This likely happened because Warner Bros. holds the international distribution rights to this movie.\n\nAvailability: Seen on productions from this company up until 2001. During its final years, it would be used in tandem with the next logo.\n\nThis logo was first seen on Merrie Melodies starring Bugs Bunny & Friends on Fox Kids in 1992.\n\nThe version with the short version of \"Merrily We Roll Along\" was spotted on the second season of Batman: The Animated Series, in addition to 1995-97 Fox Kids reruns of the show (also intact on the 1997 VHS releases of the show), as well as syndicated reruns (in addition to home media prints) of The New Batman Adventures (season 3 of Batman: The Animated Series, also called \"the revamp\").\n\nSeen on various WB family movies of the '90s such as the first three Free Willy films (current prints of the first film plaster it with the 1998 Warner Bros. Pictures logo, although this logo is left intact on the sequels; additionally, the 1997 DVD of Free Willy uses the standard variant, instead of the original version), Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Black Beauty, It Takes Two (although it is removed from current prints as Paramount Pictures via Rysher Entertainment now owns this film), Richie Rich, Space Jam, and Cats Don't Dance, among others.\n\nIt can also be found on direct-to-video films, such as Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero and the edited version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (it is also retained on the PG-13 version of the film).\n\nThe short version can be found on Animaniacs, Pinky & the Brain, Freakazoid! (it also remains intact on the former three shows' DVD releases and on streaming prints), Superman: The Animated Series, and the first season of Static Shock, as well as the ill-fated Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain.\n\nThe version with the rare fanfare was seen on Taz-Mania on AOL's In2TV, and is also preserved intact on the DVD releases thereof.\n\nThe 1999-2001 version can be found on Batman Beyond, Histeria!, Detention, The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, and the first season of The Zeta Project.\n\nThe videotaped version was seen on the final years of The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show (after the end credits) on ABC.\n\nThis logo is also seen after the 1985 Warner Home Video logo on the Stars of Space Jam series of VHS releases.\n\nThe logo with the electric guitar riff tune is intact on Road Rovers on DVD.\n\nThe short 1993 version is also seen at the beginning of The New Batman/Superman Adventures from 1997 as well as The Adventures of Batman & Robin (a.k.a. the last eleven episodes of season 2 of Batman: The Animated Series) from 1994, and is also intact on the Blu-ray releases.\n\nThis logo is also seen on the Looney Tunes shorts Chariots of Fur, Another Froggy Evening, Superior Duck, Pullet Surprise, From Hare to Eternity, and Father of the Bird.\n\nA physical, silver colored version of the print logo can also be found on Warner Bros. Editions of the Chevrolet Venture minivan from 2000-2003, affixed to the driver and passenger-side swing doors, and above the liftgate handle on the rear of the car, while a colored sticker version was affixed to the LCD display on the in-car VHS/DVD player.\n\nThis logo is also seen on international prints of the third Neverending Story movie (the UK VHS release omits it, however), pre-2000s prints of Thumbelina and A Troll in Central Park and pre-2001 international prints of The Pebble and the Penguin. The latter two films are now owned by 20th Century Fox/Disney.\n\nThis logo is also seen when Boomerang airs the Looney Tunes short A Pizza Tweety-Pie.\n\nThe Tweety \"That's all, folks!\" variant is shown whenever Boomerang airs the Carrotblanca short.\n\nThis logo is also intact on HBO Max's print of Superman: The Animated Series as well as the show's Blu-ray boxset.\n\nThis logo is also preserved on the 1998 U.S. demo VHS release of Dennis the Menace Strikes Again, with a chyroned text \"Property of Warner Bros.\" below the shield.\n\nHowever, the retail version uses the 75th Anniversary variant of the next logo.\n\nIt is also seen on the 1996 VHS release of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), plastering the 1968 Paramount Pictures logo and any WB logos that may have previously plastered the former logo.\n\nThe same also applies to the 1999 VHS reprint, as well as the 1997 DVD release and the 1999 UK DVD release thereof.\n\nThe medium-length version can be found on the Animaniacs theatrical short \"I'm Mad\".\n\n2nd Logo (March 20, 1998-September 24, 2009)\n\nVisuals: Nearly the same as the 1998 Warner Bros. Pictures logo, the only differences are that the shield banner now reads \"FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT\" instead and Bugs steps to the left from under the shield, doing the same pose and animation from the previous logo. The respective Warner byline fades in below.\n\nBylines:\n\nMarch 20, 1998-2003: \"A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\". Also, on this variant, the shield, cloud background, and the \"FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT\" banner are enhanced.\n\nFebruary 2001-2003: \"An AOL Time Warner Company\"\n\n2003-March 22, 2008: Bylineless.\n\n2004-September 24, 2009: \"A TimeWarner Company\"\n\nVariants:\n\nAs with the main Warner Bros. Pictures logo, a \"75 Years\" variant (see this page for more on the variant description from this era) was used. It is also a lot like the standard version, but the cloud background is darker and the text and the shield are in a brownish-gold color.\n\nA scope variant exists.\n\nOn current prints of Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire, the logo is darker.\n\nLike the last logo, an abridged version appears at the beginning of shows starting in 2001.\n\nOn the company's straight-to-DVD films after AOL Time Warner was reverted back to Time Warner, the logo went without a byline.\n\nAnother shortened version of this logo, this time starting with the shield zooming out, began usage from around 2001-2002 to 2008.\n\nA version without Bugs Bunny also exists, but was mostly used as a corporate logo.\n\nIn 2005, there was a short-lived version where the banner reads \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" like the normal logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI with traditional animation from the previous logo. Like the 1998 Warner Bros. Pictures logo, this was done at Intralink Film Graphic Design.\n\nAudio: Same as the previous logo, but now it's preceded by the beginning half of the original 75th Anniversary WB wind chimes fanfare. The abridged logo uses the short music from the previous logo.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn U.S. prints of A Rat's Tale and Quest for Camelot, as well as a DVD print of Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire, the logo is completely silent.\n\nOn Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars, the fanfare has noticeably more reverb to it.\n\nSometimes, when the long version is plastering the previous logo, there are no wind chimes at the start, before the previous logo's theme kicks in.\n\nOn the DVD and digital HD versions of The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie, the long version of this logo is seen, starting off silent, and then when the shield begins zooming out, the original opening music heard during the 1972 \"Big W\" logo plays underneath.\n\nAvailability: Seen on releases from this time-period until 2009."
