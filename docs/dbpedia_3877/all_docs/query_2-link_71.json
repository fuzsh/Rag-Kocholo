        "text": "MGM has signed a deal with Warner Bros. that would allow the latter studio to distribute the former’s movies in overseas territories, WB and MGM executives have announced (via The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nWarner Bros. is thus replacing Universal as MGM’s international partner. Under the previous deal, the Comcast-owned studio released movies like No Time to Die, which earned $613M internationally (79.2% of its worldwide gross), Licorice Pizza, which made $15M internationally (47.7% of its worldwide box office), or House of Gucci, which cashed in $100M in overseas territories (65.1%).\n\nThe new deal, however, does include one exception — the next James Bond movie, which will still be released by Universal. This studio will still be the upcoming MGM movies Till, in October, and Women Talking, early next year. The first two movies to benefit from the new deal will be Luca Guadagnino’s Bones and All, which released its first teaser trailer last week and will have its worldwide premiere at the Venice International Film Festival, and Michael B. Jordan’s Creed III, which is currently scheduled for a March 3, 2023, debut.\n\nThe deal has been set for three years, though an extension is available if both partners are happy. It will allow WB to also handle the physical home releases of the upcoming MGM slate and will mean that both studios will collaborate on the marketing, publicity, film distribution, and exhibitor relations in territories outside of the North American market, including China."
