        "text": "Warner Brothers today introduced a much-anticipated film unit that will make and distribute art-house movies. The unit will be led by Mark Gill, a former Miramax Films executive.\n\nThe new unit, to be called Warner Independent Films, will give Warner a full line of films to make and distribute -- from low-budget films that play festivals to big-budget, event movies like the recent series of ''Matrix'' films.\n\n''We have long felt that in order to truly be a full-service studio, we need to produce, distribute and market all genres of films, with all size budgets to all potential audiences,'' Warner Brothers said in a statement.\n\nThe move should also put Warner Brothers in contention for the Academy Awards. That competition, in recent years, has been an arena for art-house film labels.\n\nWarner Brothers, a unit of AOL Time Warner, is the last of the major Hollywood studios to field such a division. Disney has Miramax, and 20th Century Fox, a unit of the Fox Entertainment Group of the News Corporation, has Fox Searchlight, to name only two.\n\nInitially, the new Warner label will produce or acquire up to 10 films a year with budgets up to $20 million. Mr. Gill said Warner Independent would probably release its first movie next spring after he has hired a full staff.\n\nMr. Gill, whose title will be president of Warner Independent Films, joins the company from the independent producer Stratus Film Company, where he landed after leaving Miramax in 2002."
