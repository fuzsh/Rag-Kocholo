        "text": "Meerkat Manor is being turned into a feature film from Warner Bros. Animation.\n\nPer Deadline, Warner Bros. is planning to turn Meerkat Manor, the Animal Planet series that aired from 2005 to 2008, into an animated movie.\n\nWhat was the Meerkat Manor television series about?\n\n“A family of meerkats is tracked and filmed, providing first-rate entertainment with a blend of animal documentary footage and dramatic narration, as members eke out a survival in the brutal surroundings of Africa’s Kalahari Desert,” the synopsis for the series reads.\n\nFollowing Meerkat Manor’s cancelation in 2008, the series had a revival, Meerkat Manor: Rise of the Dynasty, that aired on BBC America in 2021.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the new Warner Bros. movie will utilize photorealistic animation similar to George Miller’s Happy Feet, which was released in 2006. Seth Green and Tracy Falco are producing the film, while Caroline Hawkins and Clare Birks serve as executive producers.\n\n“As we continue to grow our animated feature film slate, we are excited to bring the beloved Meerkat Manor from WBD’s Animal Planet to the big screen,” Warner Bros. Pictures Animation President Bill Damaschke said. “Along with our partners Tracy, Seth, OSF, and ITV Studios, we look forward to creating a photoreal animated family adventure for the next generation and seeing our meerkat friends make their feature film debut in a way they’ve never been seen before.”\n\nHawkins, who created the Animal Planet series, added, “It’s 20 years since we experimented with a wildlife soap opera in a London basement, and now here we are. What greater evidence could there be of the enduring appeal of meerkats? I am sure they would be thrilled at attaining stardom in Hollywood! Warner Bros is the natural home for this movie, and I am delighted to be partnering with Tracy, Seth, and Bill whose visionary expertise is second to none.”\n\nThe animated Meerkat Manor movie does not yet have a release date."
