        "text": "My dissertation frames the evolution of David Foster Wallace’s writing ethic as a function of addiction recovery. Wallace completed only two novels—the first of which is generally dismissed as the work of a young author enamored of his talent, and the second of which is not uncommonly hailed as “the voice of a generation.” Between these novels, he weaned himself off an addiction to the conspicuous narrative foregrounding of poststructuralist theory, progressing into a writer capable of bringing theory to life through narrative engagement with its application. This reformed Wallace repurposed these sterile, theoretical paradoxes as models for understanding not just the crises of individual experience, but also of American culture more broadly. Wallace’s life and work invite us to use the institutional language of addiction and the inherent narrative structure of twelve-step programs to read his novels as a progression toward an open-ended and always-contingent recovery from literary theory. Wallace was a chronic substance abuser during his teens and twenties and became a devoted member of twelve-step groups in the second half of his life. I use the three-part narrative schema of recovery—“what we were like, what happened, and what we are like now”— to account for the differences between Wallace’s two novels. Wallace understood himself as an addict; failure to read him as one means neglecting the crucial ways 12-step recovery informs his larger fictional project. Yet Wallace’s writing complicates a purely twelve-step notion of theory recovery by rejecting certain edicts of Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous. Whereas Wallace’s substance-abuse recovery depended on adhering to twelve-step doctrine, his theory addiction required fashioning his own hermeneutic recovery process: a pragmatic appraisal of theory’s narrative value for his readers. The result of this process is a writing style that foregrounds the mental route Wallace took to arrive at his conclusions. By importing the classic math teacher injunction to “show your work,” Wallace imbued his writing with a transparency that rendered it capable of meaningful engagement with readers.\n\nThis essay couples David Foster Wallace’s works (Infinite Jest, This Is Water, and non-fiction essays) with contemporary research on shame and addiction and explores how literature anticipates science as a means of understanding the human condition. Wallace's personal knowledge of addiction and how the individual struggles with addiction’s causes and consequences reflects what social workers and M.D.s are beginning to understand as an issue of society at large, not simply an isolated problem of the addict. As much of the U.S. and other countries struggle with disconnection, isolation, and the overwhelming sense of hopelessness—manifested in burgeoning debt, obesity, medication dependence, etc.—we find ourselves confronted with the realization that the addict depicts our own inner turmoil that is easily ignored or pacified in our materialistic, consumer-driven culture. Gabor Maté’s In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction (2011) and the work of Brené Brown, Ph.D., LMSW, present claims for how the individual is a reflection of the community and vice-versa, thereby arguing for a greater commitment to understanding and aiding those plagued by addiction. Wallace recognized, “Everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else” (my emphasis Infinite Jest 205). Yet his fiction and scholars’ research suggests that human beings share more identical attributes than dissimilar ones, and that the addict—whether it be Lenz, Hal, or even Gately as he struggles with sobriety—is not so different from the community who ostracizes him/her (my emphasis Infinite Jest 205). Wallace, Maté, and Brown encourage authenticity, sincerity, and vulnerability, which are all traits that help addicts overcome their struggle with substances, and almost ironically, it is these traits that also push the literary community out of the post-modern refrain of disillusionment, deconstruction, and irony, which Wallace admittedly strove to overcome.\n\nThere is currently a profound debate occurring across the globe regarding the nature of addiction: whether or not addiction is a disease. Within the last decade, addiction research and publications have flooded the market, which challenge the disease model for understanding addiction. This new research suggests that addiction is a learned behavior thus addiction begins as a habit that, if continued, becomes an ingrained behavior, but it is not a disease, like diabetes or heart disease. Concurrently, there is much discussion within academia as to what is presently occurring in literary and critical theory trends. Although there is still much debate about the beginning and end of (post)modernism and the definitions of both eras, researchers are now observing a shift in literary aesthetics, critical theories, and cultural dynamics. Leading scholars of this new movement, Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker, assign the term “metamodernism” to this shift because the prefix “meta” signifies the fluidity of the movement: it is at once between and beyond (post)modernism. It is with these two contemporary shifts in mind (both of which are decidedly influenced by previously held ideologies) that I examine how contemporary authors and their fiction depart from preceding paradigms. I draw a parallel between certain predominate characteristics of postmodern literary styles and critical theories (i.e. irony, play, cynicism, paranoia, etc.) and the discomfort that most addicts experience (i.e. shame, anxiety, cynicism, paranoia, etc.). I then analyze how metamodern authors–specifically David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Zadie Smith–and their novels continue postmodernism’s experimentation with form while moving away from postmodernism’s detachment to again explore modernism’s themes such as authenticity and sincerity. These attributes–sincerity, vulnerability, etc.–ultimately enable the addict to cognitively and behaviorally reframe their engagement with their addiction, and I argue that these very qualities also push the literary community out of the postmodern refrain.\n\nWritten while finishing his thesis in philosophy, Wallace’s The Broom of the System ranks among other “novels of ideas” by philosophers like Sartre, Kierkegaard, or Camus. But shortly after Broom was published, Wallace read David Markson’s novel Wittgenstein’s Mistress. Feeling that Markson had completely eclipsed what he had tried to do with Broom, in 1990 Wallace published an effusive 23-page analysis of Wittgenstein’s Mistress in The Review of Contemporary Fiction wherein he dismissed his own novel as “pretty dreadful.” In a little-known interview for Speak magazine in 1996, Wallace expands on why he felt Broom had failed: “If you don’t make fun of me, I’ll tell you what I was trying to do. I was very interested in technical semantics, which is the relationship between form and context. That paragraph at the end [of Broom] is missing the word ‘word,’ so I thought I would bridge both the formal and the reference. Instead, I missed on both counts.” Wallace’s dissatisfaction with his fictional treatment of Wittgenstein’s language-philosophy, especially given how Markson was able to bring it to life, was still fresh in his mind as he wrote his next—and last complete—novel. In the same interview, Wallace describes how his writing approach had evolved since Broom: “Now, ten years later, I understand that people read for intellectual reasons and emotions. And that the ending that I wrote is almost off putting, like giving the finger to the reader. I’m interested in a marriage of the two.” My proposed paper examines the exemplary places where Wallace’s second novel, Infinite Jest, revises and extends the idea content of The Broom of the System and proposes that Wallace’s updated approach, his particular synthesis of intellect and emotion, instantiates a new category of writing: The Postmodern Novel of Ideas."
