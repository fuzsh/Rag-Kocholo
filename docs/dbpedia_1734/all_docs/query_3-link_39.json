        "text": "Regarding Do We Agree?. I was just looking at its publication history. It appears to have been published in 1928 by E. V. Mitchell of Hartford, CT. The copyright does not appear to have been renewed in 1955 or 1956. So it may be in the public domain. Some others of his works, however, did have their copyrights renewed. Eclecticology 01:06, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)\n\nReally? I didn't know that. Where did you find that out? I don't want to be posting things that are not in the public domain (especially since it takes to long). I did discover that Do We Agree? and The Catholic Church and Conversion are still copyrighted, so I blanked those pages. I was hoping someone could get around to deleting those. I will, hopefully today, purge those works which are not in the public domain. But aside from those two, everything else is PD, right? Or do British copyright/renewals work differently than American (i.e. aren't in PD even if published before 1923)? If they are different, please tell me where to find that information, all I'll fix my mistakes. Thank you. Zhaladshar 11:52, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)\n\nI have now deleted the texts. If you want a text deleted in the future it is a good idea to list it at Wikisource:Possible copyright violations or Wikisource:Proposed deletions - that way the chances of an administrator noticing that a text should be deleted are improved quite a lot. About the copyright rules: Yes, the copyright does work differently in Brittain. In Brittain and all other countries in the European Union the copyright does not expire until 70 years after the death of the author, and no renewal of copyright is needed. This means that (in 2004) works published in the EU are in the public domain if the author died in 1933 or earlier, but they are still copyrighted if the author died in 1934 or later. This is a quite simple rule, but it is the main rule of european copyrights, with only a few exeptions. If a US edition was published before 1923 it is PD in the US, though. Wether we are allowed to publish works which were published before 1923 but not in the US is not quite clear to me, but if we follow the death + 70 years rule, or use works published in the US before 1923, we should definitely on the safe side. Christian S 18:51, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)\n\nBonsoir. J'aimerais savoir à quoi ça sert de rajouter \"Auteur:\" ou \"Author:\" en préfixe des noms de pages. J'ai déjà posé la question ailleurs, mais pas eu de réponse jusqu'ici. --ThomasV 22:44, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nThanks, I'd be happy to add returns, I just thought it was the norm not to from looking at a couple other books. - Evil saltine 23:39, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nActually, I looked at Principia, but I see now that it does have returns. - Evil saltine 23:44, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nHi. Regarding: the way you just modified page Autor:Franz Kafka. This page was a localized (german version) of Author:Franz Kafka. The way I understand it (and I guess it is the opinion of the author of this page too), the list of links you just added (section biographie) in various languages is not necessary here. It should be displayed only in the \"main\" author page, i.e. Author:Franz Kafka. --ThomasV 17:47, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nI did not know that there were localized pages here. I thought that author pages were presented in the language of the author's nationality (hence Kafka's author page would be in German), and other pages (such as his English author page) would be turned into a redirect to the German page as has been done with other authors. I was not even aware he had an English page, because of the way Wikipedia currently deals with author pages. Zhaladshar 17:53, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nit was mentioned on the page though, and precisely in the section you were editing (\"Diese Seite auf English\" means \"This page in english\") --ThomasV 18:03, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\n(note:moving this whole conversation to your page so that it is parsable by somebody else)\n\nYes, I did notice that. But Autor:Franz Kafka is not the localized page here on Wikisource. Author:Franz Kafka and Auteur:Franz Kafka are for they are not the German pages. And the note \"Diese Seite auf english/französisch\" also shows that this is the main page, for it is giving links to alternative versions. Regarding adding those biography links, it would have been superfluous to do so on the English or French versions, but not the German page (which is linked to from Wikisource:Authors-K). Zhaladshar 18:12, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nDo as you want. I just wanted to tell this to you, because I think that you are giving yourself some unnecessary pain. I do not think that this list of links is useful, as I said in the scriptorium. I believe that reason will eventually prevail, and that we'll have a localized author page each time we provide a translation of an author's work (for I do not read chinese and I still have a right to read some translation of chinese works). Once this happens, it is likely that the lists of biography links will go, because nobody will need them... --ThomasV 18:32, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nI see that you have divided up the text with headings such as Gulliver's Travels - Part II, Chapter III. The only question I would have is about the use of Roman numerals in our titles. I'd like to try standardizing things to Arabic numerals throughout, but if you have any arguments against this I would be glad to hear them.\n\nThanks for replying. I had to say something to get the dialogue going. I, as you, have no problem understanding Roman numerals, but I'm not sure that everybody does, or even learns this quaint old tradition. More importantly I'm looking at how Roman numerals can affect the sorting of article titles. Up to VIII everything works fine, because they are in natural alphabetical order. IX will be placed immediately after IV, and in due course C is alphabetically the first Roman numeral. This is not to say that there are no problems with Arabic numerals. A computer listing will put 2 after all numbers like 10 and 100 which begin with a 1. This might be overcome if we could convince some develloper that there are circumstances where more than one space together should not be suppressed.\n\nAnyway, I don't want to make too much of a fuss about this, and at this stage I'm not about to change titles for this alone, particularly not when none of the Roman numerals involved exceeds VIII. Eclecticology 22:08, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\nI just wrote a template that takes parameters, see scriptorium; going to bed now. see you later. --ThomasV 22:40, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\nhey, Nice work with the copyvio template. The small change I made (added braces) is supposed to prevent the template to be displayed in the category. I used the same trick for Template:Auteur. For some reason, however, it does not seem to work here (maybe some cache has to be updated)--ThomasV 15:50, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\nI like your suggestion. Thanks for the support. It's been a bear getting everything just right. If you would fix the ones that already exist that would be huge. What I've done is created a java program that reads in all the poems I have and spits out a huge formatted file that I've been cutting and pasting from. It's an easy thing for me to fix in my code and all my new data will have the stylistic touches you recommend.\n\nNow, for the real question. You may have noticed that not all of the poems are done the same. User:DonQuixote has been adding as well. He has access to extra versions of the poem, and I think representing them here is great. However, how is the question. It looks a little awkward with 3 on the same page. What do you suggest? Is there a way we can reconcile the various versions and the nice format?--Khaldei 19:17, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\nI know that I started this one but never got back to getting it finished. Thanks for pitching in. Eclecticology 22:07, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\nI long ago passed the threshhold that distinguishes a bibliophile from a bibliomaniac. I'm also a bit of a book-store rat who can't go into a new city without checking out the used book stores. I've also been picking up some interesting materials on eBay. My recently acquired set of the 1911 Britannica, I was able to get for $50.00. I'm also waiting for the 15 volume Cambridge History of English Literature to arrive. I found that with one volume missing for $40.00. I can fill up that space for $5.00. Missouri has two big cities, both of which should have plenty of used book stores. Smaller cities with less traffic have them too if you know how to look. If the plan is to use them only for scanning, a sympathetic bookstore owner could probably work out a bargain with you where he'll let you have pre-1923 heavily damaged material for next to nothing just to get rid of it. Bulk lot buying can be a bit of a crap shoot. You can end up with a lot of garbage, but I've found that some risk-taking is worth it. The simple fact that most of the competition is not willing to take risks brings the price down.\n\nI strongly agree with you about the collective works. There's a strong possibility of making a worthwhile contribution here. Before 1923 magazines were a primary means of entertainment. (It was at this time that things began to change because of the radio.) So much of this material is totally unknown that it would be great to see it available again. It also needs to be organized in a way that people can know that it is there; that may be just as important as scanning it in. Doing a good job does not involve having a big library of your own; what you soon find out is that even a small book collection can overwhelm your available time for scanning and proof reading. The on-line version of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica that is now available is a disgrace. It seems that in their hurry to have a product the owners of that project completely ignored proofreading for OCR typos, and frequently left out whole pages from the middle of an article. Experimenting with Music (EB11) has been an educational experience! Eclecticology 01:47, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\nAre all the plates you recently uploaded from Sherlock Holmes novels? I created a template to copyright & categorize these. Template:Sherlock Holmes plate, but I need to fix the category wording if these aren't all from the S.H. novels. Thanks. Wolfman 15:20, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\nThanks. No need to tag them yourself. After I saw how many there were, I automated the process. Each novel gets its own subcategory now. Just drop me a note if you upload a bunch more. Wolfman 20:31, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\nP.S. it seems that you and User:Djapipol have both uploaded images from several of the same stories from the same site. Yours are in png format, his in jpg. Oddly, the plate numbers don't always match. Yours are all in subcategories of Category:Sherlock_Holmes_plates, while his are still in the main category. (Except for The Noble Bachelor, the 1st I subcategorized). I'd dump them all in the same subcat, except for the mismatching plate numbers (on at least some). Any thoughts? Did you hand-convert jpg's to png? google doesn't show any png's for that site? Wolfman 20:54, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\nthanks. it's not that I can't subcat the jpg's, it's that i didn't because the mismatching confused me. i thought maybe they were off different editions or something. i think i understand now. checking the beryl coronet source, the 4'th image in sequence is named #22 on their server. you used that name, but Djapipol changed the name to #4 to reflect the presentation sequence. i think we should go with the server names (your approach). but i'll see about tagging the images with an indicator of presentation order. Wolfman 15:49, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\nP.S. I saved a list of wikilinks to Djapipol's jpg images in User:Wolfman/work in case you want to have them deleted as redundant. (might be hard to find them otherwise in a few weeks) Wolfman 16:35, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\nPlease, look at Les liaisons dangereuses - 1. De Cécile Volanges à Sophie Carnay aux Ursulines de... this article contain a redirect to Les Liaisons dangereuses - 1. De Cécile Volanges à Sophie Carnay aux Ursulines de... and this article contain a redirect to Les Liaisons dangereuses - Lettre 1. I think that the third is correct, do you? (Sorry for my english) --LadyInGrey\n\nI'm a Wikipedian gone to Wikisource after a botched Transwiki attempt, and I'm trying to get to know this project a bit better. I noticed that the documentation for this project is a bit... lacking. I'm been rewriting what I can, but it would be nice if you could point out the views of this project for some of the totally content devoid pages (like Primary source). Thanks! Ambush Commander\n\nI've posted a relevant comment at ThomasV's page (I don't want to cut and paste it here), so here's a link: User_talk:ThomasV#Vandalism_Attack Ambush Commander\n\nI first want to make sure that it's not just me: is it just me or are all the fonts bigger? Ambush Commander\n\nAh, never mind. Seems to have fixed itself. That was weird. Ambush Commander\n\nZhaladshar thanks for the info, I went to the Total War Speech page before I saw the comment on my talk page. As the Sportspalast Speech (English version) isn't noted on the speeches page & only contains a link to an, apparently, uneditable page with some text errors I think it'd be better to leave the total war speech where it is (unless it is possible to edit & correct english version of sportspalast - I've had a wee look & it doesn't seem so). Regarding the copyright issue I don't think this is a problem, or if it is it is an equal problem for every speech under 70 years old on wikisource, see my comments on talk:Total War Speech. AllanHainey 15:55 06 June 2005\n\nSorry to bug you, you just happen to be the most visible Wikisource guy I've seen :) Anyways, curious what the copyright situation would be on personal letters mailed between historical figures more than 50 years ago - any idea? I looked around and couldn't find anything dealing with the issue, so just thought I'd ask :)\n\nAbsolutely. You may do anything you like with that text. I release it all into the public domain. Any credit you choose to give me is because you're a nice guy, not because you're obligated. : )\n\nBy the way, people occasionally update my copyright page with new information. (See the edit log for examples.) I'll let you know if I get any new information. If you would do the same, I'd appreciate it. Quadell June 29, 2005 17:08 (UTC)\n\nYou said \"in Russia, copyright is Life+70\". That's true, but that only applies to works produced since May 27, 1973. Quadell June 29, 2005 20:15 (UTC)\n\nPlease delete my user and my talk pages. They were vandalised. Zero 1 July 2005 11:32 (UTC)\n\nPlease delete Image:Christina Applegate2.jpg as well.\n\nHi there! As part of my tidy up of areas like the Community Portal I have created a page for Wikisource projects and more specifically a project called 1911 Encyclopedia if you are interested. GregRobson 9 July 2005 13:22 (UTC)\n\nDoes the biography section of an author page have to be a list? It just takes up so much space compared to one line of | separated values. On some pages, it pushes all the actual content down the page out of sight.... CSN\n\nI'm just a big fan of getting the content in front of the users. Pages like Author:H. P. Lovecraft allow the user to be right in the middle of the content without even scrolling while on Author:Robert E. Howard you have to scroll through the list of biographies when the average user isn't going to click any of those links. I don't know, presentation-wise, the list is better I guess. I'll just do lists for now. I've raised enough controversy in the past couple of days. I don't really want to start a debate over this too. CSN\n\nIt makes sense to have one link once we go to subdomains. Maybe we can even link the author's name or something. Will we automatically get one of those little toolboxes saying \"in other languages\" like in Wikipedia? Or do we have to set those up ourselves? Thanks for moving If by the way. Since the link was red when I first made it, I didn't think it had to be disambiguated. I should have thought of Kipling... CSN\n\nIf I may say so, thanks for the excellent job you did on cleaning up the Sara Teasdale books I added ages ago. It now seems much more navigable, and looks much nicer. :) Ambivalenthysteria\n\nThanks for your kind reply. That was exactly my question. I was just basically wondering if it was that easy and secondly if that's ok to do to Guttenburg's copy. I'll get started on this today. Sveden\n\nThanks again for the kind reply to my previous question. Now how do you get rid of these damned blue boxes? Sveden\n\nZhaladshar, Could you please do me a wee favour & delete the page Author: Arthur Balfour as it is a duplication of Author:Arthur Balfour, I've changed over the links to the correct page (only remaining one is a link created by User:ThomasBot. Thanks, by the way I assume that only Admins can delete pages, is there a page or procedure to notify them of requests to delete pages as I couldn't see anything in the help pages. AllanHainey\n\nHi, Thanks for deleting the Balfour page, I don't really check the help or documentation pages much myself, only when I have something specific that I need to know how to do. However there are a few things I can think of that would improve the documentation:\n\nOn Wikiquote they have a template to put on new users talk pages to welcome them to the site & give some pointers (eg to sign talk pages use 4 squiggles, for help see Wikisource:Help:English, Wikisource:Scriptorium, etc). I'd say that something of this type would be a good introduction to wikisource & could give a signpost to the basic help/information pages people may need to refer to.\n\nThere should be a page on moving pages & watching pages (these are redlinks at the moment)\n\nThere are a lot of redlinks on Help:Images and other uploaded files & Help:Template which should probably be fixed.\n\nA page giving info on Admins & Sysops (not who they are, but what they do & what should be referred to them & through what channels) would be useful.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas, if I think of anything else I'll let you know. AllanHainey\n\nJust had another think - If there is a policy on the capitalisation of page names then I'd say this should be added, otherwise some guidance to check the capitalisation & presence of spaces as this seems to be a common cause of duplicate pages.\n\nI'd also put in a comment on some page which people will be likely to read that they should check for pre-existing versions of the same pages which they are adding.\n\nSome information on the categories included in the help page would be useful (I don't think that there is much at the moment)if only as it'll help track down documents & identify duplications.\n\nThe need to have back links on pages to the page where they are listed should also be mentioned somewhere - I've seen it somewhere but I think it's a bit obscure. AllanHainey\n\nit would be great if you could make a list of all the pages that need to be moved to en.wikisource.org, ans that are not in the main namespace (the main namespace it done by the robot). that way, when we request creation, pages can be moved immediately. ThomasV\n\nHi,\n\nPlease don't delete Templates which might be useful here. Thanks, Yann\n\nOK. I though about Template:Disambig, but you restored it. And I found a page which doesn\"t exist on en : FDNY Manhattan Office Dispatch Radio Transcript, 9/11/2001 and its talk page. Should it be moved or is it junk ? Yann\n\nGood on you for deleting this. If it comes back again, please do not exhort the anon user to post it on en:wikisource. It is a copyvio because Albert Turner, the author, was still publishing in 1975 so must have lived at least that long. —Theo (Talk)\n\nBonjour, S'il vous plaît. Regardez l'explication sur de pages \"vides\" chez ThomasV. En fait, il s'agit de traduction de Bible. Ma propre traduction. Je fait d'abord un encadrement, comme dans le cas de tableau, puis je colles le texte déjà préparé. Mais Vous étés tombé sur la partie encore en travail. Il faut voir l'avertissement. Ce ne sont pas des articles de Wikipédia mes des articles de Bible. Il faut oprondre le livre entier comme point de départ, et ne pas l'article.

Look at the explanation on \"empty\" pages at ThomasV. In fact, it is about translation of Bible. My own translation. I made at first a frame, as in the case of picture, then I stick the already prepared text. But You fallen on the part still in work. It is necessary to see the warning. They are not goods articles of Wikipédia my articles of Bible. It is necessary to see the book whole as point of departure, and not not the article. These blank pages are white because I already made the titles in the prophetic book, which is going to be divided into several goods{*articles*}. I am a translator of this translation and as it I makes my devotion. I stain me that everything is good. I work of my croayance in God, not to enjoy myself.
