Qualitative cross, analytical interpretative and based on the theory of social representations. Non-probability sampling. Contact schools in basic education level of 7municipalities of the State of Jalisco, Mexico, through various government and educational institutions. A hundred thirty five schooled adolescents, men and women. Interview with 12 focus group 8-12participants and 1 with 18participants. The interviews were transcribed in Atlas Ti program version 4.1 for a semiotic analysis to identify components of social representation. The precocious detection linked itself to the decrease of deaths for cancer of breast, long treatments and mastectomy, but little coverage was perceived to the mammary health of the teenager. They refer as limiter elements of the precocious detection the aspects of kind, psychological and of access to the information and services of health; since facilitators there was mentioned the transition of the limiter elements to facilitators. A favorable panorama appears on the level of awareness of the teenagers on his mammary health, identifying as a sector highly sensitive to the information about cancer of breast and with disposition to effect actions of early detection; there are identified as important challenge the generation of campaigns, educational materials and spaces of health focused on the teenager.

They have participated actively in the Mexican Road Safety Initiative since 2008. As a result, in September 2010 they passed laws to reduce the legal alcohol levels for driving motor vehicles. To assess the short-term impact of these measures on rates and severity of alcohol-related collisions and injuries, we conducted a secondary analysis of official databases on mortality, morbidity, and collisions. We performed a time-series analysis to assess the trend. Significant changes were observed in the monthly proportion of alcohol-related deaths and collision rates following these interventions. The article concludes with recommendations to improve the reform's enforcement and results.\n\nNew records of ectoparasitic Acari (Arachnida) and Streblidae (Diptera) from bats in Jalisco, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez, Maria M RamÃ­rez; Lopez, M Pilar Ibarra; IÃ±iguez-DÃ¡valos, Luis Ignacio; Yuill, Thomas; Orlova, Maria V; Reeves, Will K\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEctoparasites of bats in the Neotropics are diverse and play numerous ecological roles as vectors of microbial pathogens and endoparasites and as food sources for other cave fauna living both on their hosts and in bat roosts. The ectoparasites of bats in Jalisco State of western Mexico have not been as well described as those of other states with recent checklists that have focused primarily on the Yucatan Peninsula. We captured bats from 2011-2015 on the south coast and Sierra de Amula, Jalisco using mist nets, and we removed ectoparasites by hand. We identified 24 species of streblid bat flies and six ectoparasitic mites from bats caught in mist nets. There were an additional eight possibly undescribed species of Streblidae. Our collections extend the known range of species into Jalisco.

Infants were assessed every six months as to nutritional status and the Denver Selective Test. In analyzing the results, social groups were considered determinant categories for studying prematurity as the dependent variable. The results shows that both prematurity and social group are risk factors to be considered by the public health field when designing health care programs.\n\nEnvironmental evaluation of fluoride in drinking water at \"Los Altos de Jalisco,\" in the central Mexico region.\n\nPubMed\n\nHurtado, Roberto; Gardea-Torresdey, Jorge\n\nNaturally occurring fluoride has been detected and quantified in drinking water in several cities of the \"Los Altos de Jalisco\" (LAJ) region. LAJ is located in the northeastern part of the state of Jalisco-Mexico, covering an area of 16,410 km2 with a population of 696,318 in 20 municipalities. Drinking water comes mainly from groundwater aquifers, located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which is a volcanic region characterized by hydrothermal activity. Results indicated that water supply from 42% of the municipalities had a fluoride concentration over the Mexican standards of 1.5 mg/L. It is important to notice that there are three cities, Lagos de Moreno (1.66-5.88 mg/L F(-)), Teocaltiche (3.82-18.58 mg/L F(-)), and EncarnaciÃ³n de DÃ­az (2.58-4.40 mg/L F(-)) where all water samples resulted in fluoride concentration over the maximum contaminant level. The total population from these three cities is over 122,000 inhabitants. Another important city with high levels of fluoride in the water supply was TepatitlÃ¡n de Morelos (2 wells with 6.54 and 13.47 mg/L F(-)). In addition to water supply, 30 samples of brand-name bottled water were tested. Surprisingly, 8 samples (27%) demonstrated fluoride level over the standards, mainly Agua de Lagos with 5.27 mg/L. Fluoridated table salt (200-300 mg/kg F(-)) is another important source of fluoride. A large number of people living in the region, mainly school children, might be under adverse health risk because they are consuming contaminated drinking water. It is well known that long-term exposure to water with high levels of fluoride produces severe health problems.\n\nExtreme Subduction Earthquake Scenarios and their Economical Consequences for Mexico City and Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChavez, M.; Cabrera, E.; Perea, N.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThe destructive effects of large magnitude, thrust subduction superficial (TSS) earthquakes on Mexico City (MC) and Guadalajara (G) has been shown in the recent centuries. For example, the 7/04/1845 a TSS earthquake with Ms 7+ and epicentral distance of about 250 km from MC occurred on the coast of the state of Guerrero, a Maximum Mercalli Modified Intensity (MMI) of IX-X was reported in MC. Furthermore, the 19/09/1985 a Ms 8.1, Mw 8.01, TSS earthquake with epicentral distance of about 340 km from MC occurred on the coast of the state of Michoacan, a maximum MMI of IX-X was reported in MC. Also, the largest, Ms 8.2, instrumentally observed TSS earthquake in Mexico, occurred in the Colima-Jalisco region the 3/06/1932, with epicentral distance of the order of 200 km from G in northwestern Mexico. The 9/10/1995 another similar event, Ms 7.4, Mw 8, with an epicentral distance of about 240 km from G, occurred in the same region and produced MMI IX in the epicentral zone and MMI up to VI in G. The frequency of occurrence of large TSS earthquakes in Mexico is poorly known, but it might vary from decades to centuries [1]. On the other hand, the first recordings of strong ground motions in MC dates from the early 1960Â´s and most of them were recorded after the 19/09/1985 earthquake. In G there is only one recording of the later event, and 13 for the one occurred the 9/10/1995 [2]. In order to fulfill the lack of strong ground motions records for large damaging TSS earthquakes, which could have an important economical impact on MC [3] and G, in this work we have modeled broadband synthetics (obtained with a hybrid model that has already been satisfactorily compared with observations of the 9/10/1995 Colima-Jalisco Mw 8 earthquake, [4]) expected in MC and G, associated to extreme magnitude Mw 8.5, TSS scenario earthquakes with epicenters in the so-called Guerrero gap and in the Colima-Jalisco zone, respectively. The proposed scenarios are based on the seismic history and up\n\nNew seismic images of the crust across the Rivera Plate and Jalisco Block (Mexico)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCordoba, Diego; NÃºÃ±ez-CornÃº, Francisco Javier; BartolomÃ©, Rafael; JosÃ© DaÃ±obeitia, Juan; Bandy, William Lee; NÃºÃ±ez, Diana; Prada, Manel; Escudero-Ayala, Christian; EspÃ­ndola, Juan Manuel; Zamora, Araceli; GÃ³mez, AdÃ¡n; Ortiz, Modesto; Tsujal Working Group\n\n2015-04-01\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2014, we achieved an extensive offshore geophysical experiment at West Coast of MÃ©xico entitled \"Crustal characterization of the Rivera Plate-Jalisco Block boundary and its implications for seismic and tsunami hazard assessment (TSUJAL)\". The project is the result of continuous scientific collaboration between institutions in Mexico and Spain, whose main objective is to study the lithospheric structure at the collision zone between Rivera, North America Plates and the Jalisco Block, and identifying submarine structures which can potentially be tsunamigenic sources The active phase of this project carried out in February and March of 2014, we acquired around 5200 km of Multichannel Seismic Reflection (MCS) together with multibeam bathymetry and potential fields (gravity and magnetism) data. Moreover, a wide angle experiment was performed, deploying 16 OBS in 32 locations in Jalisco and Nayarit offshore regions, also recorded on a terrestrial network of 100 portable seismic stations in 240 locations across 5 seismic profiles of 200-300 km in length combined with the Seismological Network of the State of Jalisco (SisVOc). In addition, 8 land seismic stations were installed in MarÃ­as Islands and Isabel Island. These instruments registered, in continuous mode, the airgun shots generated by airgun array of 5800 ci, shooting every 120 s. The UK vessel RRS James Cook participated in this project as a part of the exchange program between Spanish and English scientific vessels, she was responsible of marine seismic experiment (MCS & WA) using a 6 km length streamer and a high capacity airgun array.

A cross-sectional study was conducted between 1997 and 1999, among 432 children aged 12 to 120 months attending the INADEJ. Measurements included hematological values, urine iodine concentration, and presence of parasites. Student's t test chi square tests were used for parametric and nonparametric analysis. The prevalence figures of anemia (20 vs 7.4%, p = 0.007) and iron deficiency (60.9 vs 44.4%, p = 0.02) were higher in preschool than in school children. Iodine deficiency was found in 29% (10.5% moderate or severe) and parasitosis in 47.2% of children, mainly E. histolytica (30.2%) and G. lamblia (28.9%). Low income, male gender and lack of social security policy holding were associated to parasitosis. The high prevalence rates of iron deficiency, iodine deficiency, and parasitosis, should be addressed by state health services with effective interventions to restrain these preventable diseases.

David; Thurber, Clifford H.; Abbott, Elizabeth R.; Brudzinski, Michael R.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe states of Jalisco, Colima, and MichoacÃ¡n in western Mexico overlie the boundary of the subducting Rivera and Cocos plates, presenting an ideal target for seismological inquiry to better understand the resulting mantle flow and regional volcanism. The different dips between the two subducting plates are thought to provide a mantle conduit that has contributed to the Colima Volcanic Complex (CVC), but there is considerable debate on the depth of the Rivera plate and width of the resulting conduit. With data from the Mapping the Rivera Subduction Zone (MARS) and Colima Deep Seismic Experiment (CODEX) networks, two temporary broadband arrays deployed in the region between 2006 and 2008, we inverted for three-dimensional P- and S-wave velocity as well as Vp/Vs structure of the upper 70 km of the crust and mantle in the Jalisco region. Using a newly-developed automatic P- and S-wave picker, we increased P picks by 74% and S picks by more than a factor of four compared to a database of manual picks for the 803 earthquakes used in the inversion. Additional relocated earthquakes extending to the trench are consistent with previous interpretations of the Rivera and Cocos plate interfaces. Areas of high Vp/Vs above both subducting slabs suggest the presence of fluids resulting from dehydration of subducted material. Extensive crustal seismicity occurs near these anomalies. A zone of high Vp/Vs is also present under the CVC. We also compare the results of different methods for obtaining Vp/Vs: a direct inversion for Vp/Vs from S minus P times versus simply dividing the Vp model by the Vs model. We find direct inversions of S minus P times to be more reliable.\n\n[Description of Melolonthidae (Coleoptera) third instar larvae associated to Agave tequilana var.

Diagnostic characters were illustrated and a key was also included. Cyclocephala comata (Bates) was the most abundant species (63.2%), followed by Phyllophaga ravida (Blanchard) (21.9%), Phyllophaga polyphylla (Bates) (9.4%), Phyllophaga misteca (Bates) (4.1%), Strategus aloeus (L.) (1.1%) and Anomala hoepfneri (Bates) (0.3%). Phyllophaga ravida and A. hoepfneri are reported for the first time on the agave plant and the latter is a new record for the State of Jalisco. All Melolonthidae species showed a marked seasonality with lower number of larvae in June 2007 and high number in August 2007, which is associated with the region's rainy season and the agave plant age, respectively.\n\nHydrogeochemical analyses of groundwater from Ameca, Jalisco Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTostado, M.; Rosas-Elguera, J.; Gomez Hermosillo, C.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nThe accelerated demographic and industrial growth of settlements in mid cities and surrounding urbane areas, requires larger water volumes for its support, including public use. Usually, these requirements are not met by superficial waters consequently underground water is required to fulfill the general necessities. TheAmeca region in Jalisco, Mexico, is located around 80km west of Guadalajara. This region has been sustained by Agriculture and mining for several decades. This last activity has been mainly developed to the north of the city, precisely on the recharge zone. The infiltrated water, eventually form the aquifers. While it travels, and due to its intrinsic dilution capacity, the water may become polluted. Eventually, if he pollutants are toxic, the water from wells used in cities like Ameca, may result in serious health problems. In this study, the Ameca aquifer is evaluated through chemical analyses of the water from wells serving the city. Thus the natural pollution caused by mineral deposit zones and mines located on the recharge zone can be evaluated.\n\nThe Jalisco Seismic Telemetric Network (RESJAL)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNunez-Cornu, F. J.; Nunez-Cornu, F. J.; Reyes-Davila, G.; Reyes-Davila, G.; Suarez-Plascencia, C.; Suarez-Plascencia, C.; Gonzalez-Ledezma, M.; Garcia-Puga, J.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nThe region of Jalisco is one of the most active seismic regions in Mexico, the main tectonic units in this region are the Jalisco Block and the Rivera Plate. The greatest earthquake (M=8.2) occurred in Mexico in the Twenty-Century (1932) took place in the coast of Jalisco, this was followed by another one (Ms =7.8) fifteen days later. In 1995 an earthquake magnitude 8.0 took place in the coast of Jalisco, but its rupture area was only the southern half of the rupture area proposed for the 1932 earthquakes, these facts suggest the existence of an important seismic Gap in the north coast of Jalisco which includes the area of BahÃ­a de Banderas. However, not only subduction earthquakes occurred in this region there are also large inland earthquakes, such as the December 27, 1568 and February 11, 1872 events. There are also three active volcanoes Sanganguey, Ceboruco and the most active volcano in Mexico, the Colima volcano. In spite of these facts and the risk associated to these processes, there were only one seismological permanent station in Chamela on the coast of Jalisco and an analog telemetric network (RESCO) located on the Colima Volcano and the south part of the Colima Rift Zone (CRZ). By these reasons, the Unidad Estatal de ProtecciÃ³n Civil de Jalisco (Jalisco Civil Defense) began a project to install a Digital Telemetric Network in the region in several phases, this project is carrying out jointly with SisVOc UdeG.; due to the size of the area and the topography of the region it is very difficult to get direct telemetric links, by these reasons the network is designed in cells with nodes, where the nodes are the different Campus of the University of Guadalajara located in the region, all Campus are linked by a computer network. First phase started in August 2001, it includes the installation of six stations, each station with a Kinemetrics Everest 24 bit datalogger, GPS time, and a Lennartz LE3Dlite 1Hz sensor, using KNI NMS to control and data acquisition\n\nSpace Radar Image of Colima Volcano, Jalisco, Mexico\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1999-05-01\n\nThis is an image of the Colima volcano in Jalisco, Mexico, a vigorously active volcano that erupted as recently as July 1994. The eruption partially destroyed a lava dome at the summit and deposited a new layer of ash on the volcano's southern slopes. Surrounding communities face a continuing threat of ash falls and volcanic mudflows from the volcano, which has been designated one of 15 high-risk volcanoes for scientific study during the next decade. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 24th orbit on October 1, 1994. The image is centered at 19.4 degrees north latitude, 103.7 degrees west longitude. The area shown is approximately 35.7 kilometers by 37.5 kilometers (22 miles by 23 miles). This single-frequency, multi-polarized SIR-C image shows: red as L-band horizontally transmitted and received; green as L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received; and blue as the ratio of the two channels. The summit area appears orange and the recent deposits fill the valleys along the south and southwest slopes. Observations from space are helping scientists understand the behavior of dangerous volcanoes and will be used to mitigate the effects of future eruptions on surrounding populations. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01739\n\nLo que Piensan los Estudiantes y Profesores Sobre la Calidad de la Educacion Superior.

During the spring of 2014, within the framework of TSUJAL project, Spanish and Mexican scientists investigated this region with the main objective of defining the crustal architecture of this active margin and recognizing potential structural sources that can trigger earthquakes and tsunamis at the convergence between Rivera plate-Jalisco block with the North American Plate. To achieve these goals, a wide-ranging of geophysical data was acquired in this region both offshore and onshore. In this paper, we present the preliminary results obtained from this project about bathymetric, structural geology and wide-angle seismic data of the southern coast of BahÃ­a de Banderas. A crustal P-wave velocity model for the southern coast of BahÃ­a de Banderas was obtained using WAS data recorded by OBS and land seismic stations for more than 150 km across Rivera Plate and Jalisco Block. The thickness of the slab in this area is about 10 km and presents a dip angle about 8Âº. Continental crustal thickness below Puerto Vallarta is about 20 km, no evidence of continental Moho was found in this study. This model support that due to the convergence of Rivera Plate against Jalisco Block, the region of BahÃ­a de Banderas is under strong crustal stresses that generate structural lineaments and have the same trends offshore and inland. Most of the seismicity reported can be associated to the main structural lineaments. The Banderas Canyon apparently is in an opening process from west to east, which seems to continue through the Rio Pitillal river valley. There is no seismic or morphological evidence to consider that the Banderas Canyon is a continuation of Vallarta Graben.South of MarÃ­a Cleofas Island, the SC marks the limit between RP and JB, possibly being the result of the RP against JB\n\nRisk factors for the transmission of infectious diseases agents at the wild birds-commercial birds interface.

L.; Rangel, V.; Zawadzki, A.; Jacobsen, G.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe study and preservation of tsunami deposits have being challenging in humid tropical environments. While tsunami deposits have been widely studied at temperate latitudes, few studies assess this problem in tropical environments due to the difficulties intrinsic to these places (e.g. tsunami deposit preservation, post-burial changes in a tropical environment, mangrove vegetation, difficult access, wildlife, among others). Here we assess the problem of tsunami-deposits preservation on the Jalisco-Colima tropical coast of Mexico, which parallels the more than 1000-km long Mexican subduction, where historical accounts indicate the occurrence of two significant tsunamis on June 3 and 22, 1932 (Corona and RamÃ­rez-Herrera, 2012a, Valdivia et al., 2012). However, up to date, no geological evidence of these events has been reported. We present geological evidence of two large tsunamis related to the June 3, M 8.2 earthquake, and the June 22, Ms 6.9 landslide-triggering event of 1932 (Corona and RamÃ­rez-Herrera, 2012a, b). A multiproxy approach was applied to unravel the nature of anomalous sand units and sharp basal contacts in the stratigraphy of a number of sites at Palo Verde estuary, El TecuÃ¡n swales and marsh, and La Manzanilla swales, on the Jalisco-Colima coast. Lines of evidence including historical, geomorphological, stratigraphic, grain size, organic matter content, microfossils (diatoms and foraminifera), geochemical content, magnetic susceptibility and AMS analyses, together with dating (210Pb and 14C), and modeling, corroborate the presence of tsunami deposits of both the 3 June 1932 tsunami at El TecuÃ¡n and La Manzanilla, and the 22 June 1932 tsunami at Palo Verde. Further evidence of earlier tsunamis, at least four events, is also evident in the stratigraphy. Work in progress should reveal the chronology of the earliest tsunamis and their origin.

Maximum monthly abundance in Agua Dulce lake and El ErmitaÃ±o estuary was 86 471 birds (29 686 in Agua Dulce and 56 785 in ErmitaÃ±o), with a total cummulative abundance of 179 808 individuals (66 976 in Agua Dulce and 112 832 in ErmitaÃ±o). A total of 87 waterbirds species were recorded, 78 in Agua Dulce and 73 in ErmitaÃ±o. The higher species richness and abundance was observed during winter, when migratory species arrived. Most species prefered shallow waters, except seabirds which prefered protected areas such as dunes in Agua Dulce. Other groups, like clucks and related species. prefered low salinity areas, for example in the south-east area of ErmitaÃ±o. The higher abundance of the shorehirds was found when the water level on the estuary was low. Herons were seen often at areas with high salinity and influenced by tides (e.g. mouth of ErmitaÃ±o).\n\nNatural Risks at the Bottom Side of Ameca River, in the State Limits of Jalisco and Nayarit, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPinedo, K. G.; Maciel, R.; Pena, L. E.; GarcÃ­a GarcÃ­a, E. X.; Ramos Chavez, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAt world-wide level, the population centers are exposed to natural risks and more those that are located to borders of the rivers, where hydrometeorological and geologic phenomenon are conjugated, and even increased by the action of the man. From 1911 to 2015, the disasters registered in the world due to flood by river overflowing were 2 701, with 2 545 affected 224 110, of which 60 229 747 lost their homes and 4 449 031 deads, causing therefore an economic loss of approximately $549 052 761 dollars. The case of study is the low part of the Ameca River, the one of the main rivers of the states of Jalisco and Nayarit in the west zone of Mexico. It is interesting, since it have its mouth near the tourist area (with considerable affluence at national level), with infrastructure (airport and bridges) and towns of both referred states; as well because at the pass of the years, this river have had overflows affecting municipalities, bridges and loss of mangrove swamp. In order to determine the feasible impacts to happen with the overflow of the Ameca River, the aerial photographs of area of study and satellite images were analyzed (historical and present), likewise information of the river basin physical environment generated by INEGI with special emphasis in the low part of the river basin and a campaign of work field, to delimit the zones that have shown some affectation. The objective of this investigation is to contribute to the risk analysis of the adjacent localities to the river, with the purpose of diminishing the impact in the population. As preliminary results appear maps with boundaries of paleo-channels, which mark the zone of influence during overflows of the Ameca River, the towns which can be affected and the population exposed.\n\nContracting private sector providers for public sector health services in Jalisco, Mexico: perspectives of system actors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNigenda, Gustavo H; GonzÃ¡lez, Luz MarÃ­a\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIntroduction Contracting out health services is a strategy that many health systems in the developing world are following, despite the lack of decisive evidence that this is the best way to improve quality, increase efficiency and expand coverage. A large body of literature has appeared in recent years focusing on the results of several contracting strategies, but very few papers have addressed aspects of the managerial process and how this can affect results. Case description This paper describes and analyses the perceptions and opinions of managers and workers about the benefits and challenges of the contracting model that has been in place for almost 10 years in the State of Jalisco, Mexico. Both qualitative and quantitative information was collected. An open-ended questionnaire was used to obtain information from a group of managers, while information provided by a self-selected group of workers was collected via a closed-ended questionnaire. The analysis contrasted the information obtained from each source. Discussion and Evaluation Findings show that perceptions of managers and workers vary for most of the items studied. For managers the model has been a success, as it has allowed for expansion of coverage based on a cost-effective strategy, while for workers the model also possesses positive elements but fails to provide fair labour relationships, which negatively affects their performance. Conclusion Perspectives of the two main groups of actors in Jalisco's contracting model are important in the design and adjustment of an adequate contracting model that includes managerial elements to give incentives to worker performance, a key element necessary to achieve the model's ultimate objectives. Lessons learnt from this study could be relevant for the experience of contracting models in other developing countries.

Western Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlatorre-Zamora, Miguel Angel; Campos-EnrÃ­quez, JosÃ© Oscar; Fregoso-Becerra, Emilia; Quintanar-Robles, Luis; Toscano-Fletes, Roberto; Rosas-Elguera, JosÃ©\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Ameca tectonic depression (ATD) is located at the NE of the Jalisco Block along the southwestern fringe of the NW-SE trending Tepic-Zacoalco Rift, in the west-central part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, western Mexico. To characterize its shallow crustal structure, we conducted a gravity survey based on nine N-S gravity profiles across the western half of the Ameca Valley. The Bouguer residual anomalies are featured by a central low between two zones of positive gravity values with marked gravity gradients. These anomalies have a general NW-SE trend similar to the Tepic-Zacoalco Rift general trend. Basement topography along these profiles was obtained by means of: 1) a Tsuboi's type inverse modeling, and 2) forward modeling. Approximately northward dipping 10Â° slopes are modeled in the southern half, with south tilted down faulted blocks of the Cretaceous granitic basement and its volcano-sedimentary cover along sub-vertical and intermediate normal faults, whereas southward dipping slopes of almost 15Â° are observed at the northern half. According to features of the obtained models, this depression corresponds to a slight asymmetric graben. The Ameca Fault is part of the master fault system along its northern limit. The quantitative interpretation shows an approximately 500 to 1100 m thick volcano-sedimentary infill capped by alluvial products. This study has several implications concerning the limit between the Jalisco Block and the Tepic-Zacoalco Rift. The established shallow crustal structure points to the existence of a major listric fault with its detachment surface beneath the Tepic-Zacoalco Rift. The Ameca Fault is interpreted as a secondary listric fault. The models indicate the presence of granitic bodies of the Jalisco Block beneath the TMVB volcanic products of the Tepic-Zacoalco rift. This implies that the limit between these two regional structures is not simple but involves a complex transition zone. A generic model suggests that the\n\nArsenic in drinking water in the Los Altos de Jalisco region of Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nHurtado-JimÃ©nez, Roberto; Gardea-Torresdey, Jorge L\n\n2006-10-01\n\nTo establish the degree of contamination by arsenic in drinking water in the Los Altos de Jalisco (LAJ) region of west-central Mexico, and to estimate the levels of exposure that residents of the area face. Total arsenic concentration (the sum of all arsenic forms, organic and inorganic) was determined for 129 public water wells in 17 municipal capitals (cabeceras municipales) of the LAJ region, using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. For most of the wells, water samples were taken in both November 2002 and October 2003. The levels of exposure to arsenic were estimated for babies (10 kg), children (20 kg), and adults (70 kg). Mean concentrations of arsenic higher than the Mexican national guideline value of 25 micro g/L were found in 44 (34%) of the 129 wells. The mean concentration of total arsenic for the 129 wells ranged from 14.7 micro g/L to 101.9 micro g/L. The highest concentrations were found in well water samples collected in the cities of MexticacÃ¡n (262.9 micro g/L), Teocaltiche (157.7 micro g/L), and San Juan de los Lagos (113.8 micro g/L). Considering the global mean concentration for all the wells in each of the 17 cities, the mean concentration of arsenic exceeded the Mexican guideline value in 7 of the cities. However, the global mean concentration in all 17 cities was higher than the World Health Organization guideline value of 10 micro g/L for arsenic. The range of the estimated exposure doses to arsenic in drinking water was 1.1-7.6 micro g/kg/d for babies, 0.7-5.1 micro g/kg/d for children, and 0.4-2.7 micro g/kg/d for adults. At the exposure doses estimated in the LAJ region, the potential health effects from chronic arsenic ingestion include skin diseases, gastrointestinal effects, neurological damage, cardiovascular problems, and hematological effects. While all the residents may not be affected, an important fraction of the total population of the LAJ region is under potential health risk due to the ingestion of high\n\nThe age and composition of the pre-Cenozoic basement of the Jalisco Block: implications for and relation to the Guerrero composite terrane\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nValencia, Victor A.; Righter, Kevin; Rosas-Elguera, Jose; LÃ³pez-MartÃ­nez, Margarita; Grove, Marty\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe Jalisco Block is thought to be part of the Guerrero terrane, but the nature and age of the underlying crystalline basement are largely unknown. We have collected a suite of schists, granitoids, and weakly metamorphosed marine sediments from various parts of the Jalisco Block including Atenguillo and Ameca, Mascota and San SebastiÃ¡n, Cuale, Puerto Vallarta, Punta Mita, Yelapa, and TomatlÃ¡n. The schists range in age from 135 to 161 Ma, with many exhibiting Proterozoic and Phanerozoic zircon ages. The granitoids range in age from 65 to 90 Ma, and are calc-alkaline compositionallyâsimilar to granitoids from the Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos batholiths. The Jalisco granitoids also experienced similar uplift rates to granitoids from the regions to the north and south of the Jalisco Block. The marine sediments yield a maximum depositional age of 131 Ma, and also contain a significant zircon population with ages extending back to the Archean. Granitoids from this study define two age groups, even after the effects of thermal resetting and different closure temperatures are considered. The 66.8-Ma silicic ash flow tuff near Union de Tula significantly expands the extent of this Cretaceous-Paleocene age ash flow tuff unit within the Jalisco Block, and we propose calling the unit \"Carmichael silicic ash flow tuff volcanic succession\" in honor of Ian Carmichael. The ages of the basement schists in the Jalisco Block fully overlap with the ages of terranes of continental Mexico, and other parts of the Guerrero terrane in the south, confirming the autochthonous origin of the Jalisco Block rather than exotic arc or allochthonous origin. Geologic data, in combination with geochronologic and oxygen isotopic data, suggest the evolution of SW Mexico with an early 200-1,200-Ma passive margin, followed by steep subduction in a continental arc setting at 160-165 Ma, then shallower subduction by 135 Ma, and finally, emplacement of granitoids at 65-90 Ma.\n\nChronic kidney disease in homeless persons in Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia-Garcia, Guillermo; GutiÃ©rrez-Padilla, Alfonso J; Renoirte-Lopez, Karina; Mendoza-Garcia, Martha; Oseguera-Vizcaino, Ma C; Perez-Gomez, Hector R; Marquez-Amezcua, J Mario; Tonelli, Marcello\n\n2013-05-01\n\nLittle is known about the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among the homeless in Mexico. The role of substance abuse, alcoholism, and homelessness in CKD has not been properly evaluated. We screened 260 homeless individuals in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, for the presence of CKD and its risk factors, and compared their characteristics with those from a separate cohort of poor Jalisco residents and with a survey of the general Mexican population. CKD was more prevalent among the homeless than among the poor Jalisco population (22% vs. 15.8%, P =0.0001); 16.5% had stage 3, 4.3% stage 4, and 1.2% stage 5. All were unaware of having CKD. Only 5.8% knew they had diabetes, but 19% had fasting blood sugar >126âmg/dl; 3.5% knew they were hypertensive but 31% had systolic blood pressure â©¾140âmmâHg or diastolic blood pressure â©¾90âmmâHg. Alcoholism was less common than in the poor Jalisco population (23.5% vs. 32.3%, P =0.002), but tobacco smoking (34.6% vs. 21.5%, P =0.0001) and substance abuse (18% vs. 1.1%, P =0.0001) were more prevalent among the homeless. Likewise, chronic viral infections such as HIV (4.5% vs. 0.3%, P =0.0001) and HCV (7.7% vs. 1.4%, P =0.0001) were also significantly higher among the homeless than in the general population. In conclusion, CKD and its risk factors are highly prevalent among the homeless individuals in Jalisco, Mexico. Lack of awareness of having diabetes and hypertension is highly common, as is substance abuse. Programs aiming to prevent CKD and its risk factors in Mexico should specifically target this high-risk population.\n\nA reconnaissance geochemical study of La Primavera geothermal area, Jalisco, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMahood, G.A.; Truesdell, A.H.; Templos, M.L.A.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe Sierra La Primavera, a late Pleistocene rhyolitic caldera complex in Jalisco, Me??xico, contains fumaroles and large-discharge 65??C hot springs that are associated with faults related to caldera collapse and to later magma insurgence. The nearly-neutral, sodium bicarbonate, hot springs occur at low elevations at the margins of the complex, whereas the water-rich fumaroles are high and central. The Comisio??n Federal de Electricidad de Me??xico (CFE) has recently drilled two deep holes at the center of the Sierra (PR-1 and Pr-2) and one deep hole at the western margin. Temperatures as high as 285??C were encountered at 1160 m in PR-1, which produced fluids with 820 to 865 mg/kg chloride after flashing to one atmosphere. Nearby, PR-2 encountered temperatures to 307??C at 2000 m and yielded fluids with chloride contents fluctuating between 1100 and 1560 mg/kg after flashing. Neither of the high-temperature wells produced steam in commercial quantities. The well at the western margin of the Sierra produced fluids similar to those from the hot springs. The temperature reached a maximum of 100??C near the surface and decreased to 80??C at 2000 m. Various geothermometers (quartz conductive, Na/K, Na-K-Ca, ??18O(SO4-H2O) and D/H (steam-water) all yield temperatures of 170 ?? 20??C when applied to the hot spring waters, suggesting that these spring waters flow from a large shallow reservoir at this temperature. Because the hot springs are much less saline than the fluids recovered in PR-1 and PR-2, the mixed fluid in the shallow reservoir can contain no more than 10-20% deep fluid. This requires that most of the heat is transferred by steam. There is probably a thin vapor-dominated zone in the central part of the Sierra, through which steam and gases are transferred to the overlying shallow reservoir. Fluids from this reservoir cool from ???170??C to 65??C by conduction during the 5-7 km of lateral flow to the hot springs. ?? 1983.\n\nLithosphere Structure of the Rivera Plate - Jalisco Block Contact Zone: Septentrional Region of the Islas MarÃ­as (Mexico)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMadrigal-Ãvalos, L. A.; Nunez, D.; Escalona-Alcazar, F. D. J.; NuÃ±ez-Cornu, F. J.; Barba, D. C., Sr.; Danobeitia, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe western margin of Mexico is a tectonic complex region where large earthquakes occurred with very destructive consequences, including the generation of big tsunamis. This fact is mainly the result of the Rivera plate subduction beneath the North American plate and the Jalisco Block implying a high potential seismic risk. In the north, between the Tamayo Fracture Zone and the Mesoamerican Trench, the Islas MarÃ­as region is a complex tectonic limit within the interaction of the Rivera plate oceanic crust and the Jalisco Block continental crust. In order to know the shallow and deep structure of the Rivera plate - Jalisco Block contact zone and to be able to determine these potential seismic sources, the TSUJAL geophysical experiment was carried out from 2012 to 2016. As part of this project, we present the results of the processed and analyzed MCS and WAS data along the TS09 and RTSIM01 seismic transects, respectively, across the septentrional region of Islas MarÃ­as. These marine seismic lines are coincident with 110 km length for MCS and 240 km for WAS, and perpendicular to the coastline with SW-NE orientation. The seismic sources used in this work aboard RRS James Cook consisted of 12 guns with a total capacity for WAS data of 5800 in3 every 120 s and 3540 in3 every 50 m for MCS data. The MCS data were acquired with a 5.85 km length streamer with a 468 active channels, while the WAS data were recorded by a network of 4 OBS and 27 land seismic stations. After data processing and joint interpretation, it was possible to determine that shallow structure is mainly constituted by normal faults associated to graben structures forming sedimentary basins with non-deformed sediments in the basement. While the deep structure is characterized by depths from 9 to 12 km in the oceanic crust and 18 to 21 km in the continental crust. The deepest layers of the upper mantle were determined up to 35 km depth. In this study, it was possible to calculate a dip angle between 6Â\n\nFrequency of Toxoplasma gondii in pork meat in OcotlÃ¡n, Jalisco, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalvÃ¡n-Ramirez, M L; Madriz Elisondo, A L; Rico Torres, C P; Luna-PastÃ©n, H; RodrÃ­guez PÃ©rez, L R; RincÃ³n-SÃ¡nchez, A R; Franco, R; Salazar-Montes, A; Correa, D\n\n2010-06-01\n\nToxoplasmosis is an infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular obligate parasite. Its transmission has usually been attributed to ingestion of undercooked or raw meat. The frequency of T. gondii in pork, the most common meat for human consumption in Jalisco, Mexico, is unknown; in Guadalajara city high prevalence of human toxoplasmosis has been documented. Forty-eight samples of pork meat from butcher shops in OcotlÃ¡n city were analyzed. Through bioassay, 50 g of tissue was homogenized in an acidic pepsin solution and inoculated subcutaneously to previously immunosuppressed mice. Blood samples from the mice tail vein were obtained before inoculation and 7, 14, 28, and 45 days postinoculation to analyze anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibody kinetics by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For histopathology, small fragments of the brain, lungs, heart, and skeletal muscle were extracted on day 45 and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Also, DNA was extracted from the pork meat for PCR amplification of the B1 gene. Even though all pork samples were negative by histopathology and PCR, IgG and IgM antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 1 of the 48 inoculated mice, reflecting a frequency of 2.1% positive pork meat, which is lower than expected but similar to that found in other regions.\n\nStudy of the May 2016 Seismic Swarm at Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNuÃ±ez-Cornu, F. J.; Reginfo, W.; Escalona-Alcazar, F. D. J.; Gutierrez Pena, Q. J.; Trejo-Gomez, E.; Suarez-Plascencia, C.; Nunez, D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Metropolitan Zone of Guadalajara (MZG) is the second city of Mexico. This is a region with a high seismic hazard because there are historical reports of both large earthquakes and local seismic swarms. For this reason, it is important to evaluate and identify seismogenic structures that exist in the area. In order to assess the seismic hazard that this structures can represent both the population of the MZG and the facilities of the Geothermal Plant at Cerritos Colorados in La Primavera. In December of 2015 and in May of 2016 two seismic swarms occurred that affected the MZG. The May 2016 swarm was recorded by all stations of the Jalisco Telemetric Seismic and Accelerometric Network (RESAJ), preliminary locations estimated by the Antelope automatic system show an alignment of the earthquakes with an N-S trend west of the ZMG. The earthquakes were relocated, for which the phases were read and the Hypo71 program and a regional velocities model was used. The results allow us to observe two N-S alignments to the west of the MZG, the westernmost of which crosses La Caldera de la Primavera. The focal mechanisms of the earthquakes were calculated using the MecFor program with the Hypo71 outputs as input data. Most of the obtained mechanisms are mechanisms of normal fault with direction parallel to the alignments, suggesting the existence of two active faults that define a graben (graben of Zapopan). The lengths of these faults are 16 and 28 km indicating that they could generate earthquakes with magnitude 6.2 and 6.5, these earthquakes could cause great destruction in the MZG.\n\nSpatial epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis in Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez, Horacio Zendejas; Suazo, Feliciano MiliÃ¡n; Cuador Gil, JosÃ© QuintÃ­n; Bello, Gustavo Cruz; Anaya Escalera, Ana MarÃ­a; MÃ¡rquez, Gabriel HuitrÃ³n; Casanova, Leticia GarcÃ­a\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to use geographic information systems (GIS) and geo-statistical methods of ordinary kriging to predict the prevalence and distribution of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in Jalisco, Mexico. A random sample of 2 287 herds selected from a set of 48 766 was used for the analysis. Spatial location of herds was obtained by either a personal global positioning system (GPS), a database from the Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ¬stica GeografÃ¬a e InformÃ tica (INEGI) or Google Earth. Information on TB prevalence was provided by the Jalisco Commission for the Control and Eradication of Tuberculosis (COEETB). Prediction of TB was obtained using ordinary kriging in the geostatistical analyst module in ArcView8. A predicted high prevalence area of TB matching the distribution of dairy cattle was observed. This prediction was in agreement with the prevalence calculated on the total 48 766 herds. Validation was performed taking estimated values of TB prevalence at each municipality, extracted from the kriging surface and then compared with the real prevalence values using a correlation test, giving a value of 0.78, indicating that GIS and kriging are reliable tools for the estimation of TB distribution based on a random sample. This resulted in a significant savings of resources.\n\nSpace Radar Image of Colima Volcano, Jalisco, Mexico\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis is an image of the Colima volcano in Jalisco, Mexico, a vigorously active volcano that erupted as recently as July 1994. The eruption partially destroyed a lava dome at the summit and deposited a new layer of ash on the volcano's southern slopes. Surrounding communities face a continuing threat of ash falls and volcanic mudflows from the volcano, which has been designated one of 15 high-risk volcanoes for scientific study during the next decade. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 24th orbit on October 1, 1994. The image is centered at 19.4 degrees north latitude, 103.7 degrees west longitude. The area shown is approximately 35.7 kilometers by 37.5 kilometers (22 miles by 23 miles). This single-frequency, multi-polarized SIR-C image shows: red as L-band horizontally transmitted and received; green as L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received; and blue as the ratio of the two channels. The summit area appears orange and the recent deposits fill the valleys along the south and southwest slopes. Observations from space are helping scientists understand the behavior of dangerous volcanoes and will be used to mitigate the effects of future eruptions on surrounding populations. Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. The radars illuminate Earth with microwaves, allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: the L-band (24 cm), the C-band (6 cm) and the X-band (3 cm). The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing. The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature\n\nA conceptual view for advancing monitoring and assessment of land resources in the Mexican state of Jalisco\n\nTreesearch\n\nCeledonio Aguirre-Bravo\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper addresses key elements of a conceptual view for advancing monitoring and a variety of applications to land resources and environmental management in the state of Jalisco, Mexico.

Case-control study. 102 participants from the Instituto AlteÃ±o para el Desarrollo de Jalisco (cases) and 194 from the elementary school system (controls), aged 5 to 12 years, were included. Dependent variables were these indexes weight/age (Z), height/age (Z), BMI (Z). Independent variables were the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Student's t test, chi square, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Family income was low (p = 0.031) and unstable job was higher in cases: OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.8-6.0. The frequency of stunting was higher in cases (9.9% vs. 5.9%). The combination of overweight/obesity was higher in controls (27.3% vs. 16.8%), OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.0-3.4. The nutritional status of children of Arandas, Jalisco, has been modified by an accelerate nutrition transition, provoked by socioeconomic, educational and demographic factors that might have influence on the persistence of stunting and an increasing prevalence of overweight/obesity.\n\nSlope Instability Risk Analysys of the Municipality of Comala, Colima , Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRamirez-Ruiz, J. J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nEvery year during the rainy season occur the problem of mass landslide in some areas of the community of Comala, Colima Mexico. Slope instability is studied in this volcanic region which is located in the southern part of the Volcan de Fuego de Colima. It occurs due to the combination of different factors existing in this area as: Precipitation, topography contrast, type and mechanical properties of deposits that constitute the rocks and soils of the region and the erosion due to the elimination of vegetation deck to develop and grow urban areas. To these geological factors we can extend the tectonic activity of the Western part of Mexico that originate high seismicity by the interaction of Cocos plate and North America plate forming the region of Graben de Colima, were is located this area. Here we will present a Zonification and determination of Slope Instability Risk Maps due to the rain and seismicity accelerators factors. This Study is parto of a proyect to reduce the risk of this phenomenon, it was carried out as part of the National Risk Map of Mexico analized using the CENAPRED methodology to zonificate the risk areas. The instability of slopes is determined both in its origin and in its development, by different mechanisms. In such a way that this process of instability can be grouped into four main categories: Falls or landslides, Flows, Slips and expansions or lateral landslides. Here it is presented the Risk analisis to this volcanic area that cover the municipality of Comala in the State of Colima, Mexico using the Susceptibility map, Risk Map and Risk analisis of the Municipality.\n\nPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) levels in blood samples from children living in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrta-GarcÃ­a, Sandra T; Ochoa-MartÃ­nez, Ãngeles C; Varela-Silva, JosÃ© A; PÃ©rez-Maldonado, IvÃ¡n N\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to perform a polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) exposure assessment using blood samples collected from children living in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico (GDL).

Modeling of margin-normal strain accumulation before the earthquake suggests the Rivera-North America subduction interface was fully locked. Transient postseismic motion from 10/ 95-6/97 is well fit by a model that includes logarithmically-decaying fault afterslip, elastic strain from shallow fault relocking, and possibly a minor viscoelastic response, but is fit poorly by models that assume a dominant Maxwell viscoelastic response of the lower crust and upper mantle, independent of the assumed viscosities. Landward, margin-normal motion since mid-1997 is parallel to but ??? 75% slower than the pre-seismic velocity. Afterslip alone fails to account for this slowdown. The viscoelastic response predicted by a FEM correctly resolves the remaining velocity difference within the uncertainties. Both processes thus offset elastic strain accumulating from the relocked subduction interface.\n\nPrevalence of Dementia, Emotional State and Physical Performance among Older Adults in the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVelÃ¡zquez-Brizuela, Irma E.; Ortiz, Genaro G.; Ventura-Castro, Lucia; Ãrias-Merino, Elva D.; Pacheco-MoisÃ©s, FermÃ­n P.; MacÃ­as-Islas, Miguel A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground.

This poorly known area of the eastern Tropical Pacific ocean is characterized by its great fish diversity. A total of 245 fish species (163 genera, 72 families) were collected during the 1994-1995 annual cycle. Vouchers were deposited in Centro de Ecologia Costera, Universidad de Guadalajara. The most important families in number of species were Carangidae (20 species), Haemulidae (20), Serranidae (17), Sciaenidae (13) and Lutjanidae (8); 20 species represented 85% and 80% of relative abundance and biomass respectively. Microlepidotus brevipinnis, Caranx caninus, Caranx caballus, Kiphosus analogus and Caranx sexfasciatus, were the dominant species. Most fish species collected in Bahia de Navidad have zoogeographical affinity with the Panamic Province (65%), and in lesser proportion with the Eastern Pacific Ocean (19%), Circumtropical (7%), Mexican Province (5%), Indo-Pacific Ocean (3%) and Gulf of California (0.4%). The great ichthyological affinity between the study area and the southern Gulf of California suggests an extension of the of Gulf southern limit.\n\nKnowledge and technology transfer to improve the municipal solid waste management system of Durango City, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nValencia-VÃ¡zquez, Roberto; PÃ©rez-LÃ³pez, Maria E; Vicencio-de-la-Rosa, MarÃ­a G; MartÃ­nez-Prado, MarÃ­a A; Rubio-HernÃ¡ndez, RubÃ©n\n\n2014-09-01\n\nAs society evolves its welfare level increases, and as a consequence the amount of municipal solid waste increases, imposing great challenges to municipal authorities. In developed countries, municipalities have established integrated management schemes to handle, treat, and dispose of municipal solid waste in an economical and environmentally sound manner. Municipalities of developing and transition countries are not exempted from the challenges involving municipal solid waste handling, but their task is not easy to accomplish since they face budget deficits, lack of knowledge, and deficiencies in infrastructure and equipment. In the northern territory of Mexico, the municipality of Durango is facing the challenge of increased volumes of waste with a lack of adequate facilities and infrastructure. This article analyses the evolution of the municipal solid waste management of Durango city, which includes actions such as proper facilities construction, equipment acquisition, and the implementation of social programmes. The World Bank, offering courses to municipal managers on landfill operation and waste management, promoted the process of knowledge and technology transfer. Thereafter, municipal authorities attended regional and some international workshops on waste management. In addition they followed suggestions of international contractors and equipment dealers with the intention to improve the situation of the waste management of the city. After a 15-year period, transfer of knowledge and technology resulted in a modern municipal solid waste management system in Durango municipality. The actual system did not reach the standard levels of an integrated waste management system, nevertheless, a functional evaluation shows clear indications that municipality actions have put them on the right pathway.

A total of 243 isolates were evaluated in terms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and related genes through a disk diffusion method and PCR respectively; we found 16 MDR isolates, all of them harbouring the bla CMY gene but not qnr genes, these isolates represent less than 10% of the collection. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a higher genotypic similitude within isolates of State of Mexico than Jalisco. A low percentage of Salmonella isolates were resistant to relevant antibiotics in human health, nevertheless, the AMR and involved genes were similar despite the different serovars and origin of the isolates. This investigation provided an insight of the current status of AMR of Salmonella isolates in two States of Mexico and pinpoint the genes involved in AMR and their epidemiological relationship, the information could help to determine an adequate therapy in human and veterinary medicine.

Regional vulnerability analyses consider the knowledge of locals, which may provide insight into the effects of climate variability on the environment at smaller scales, and most importantly, the effects that these developments are having on society. The objective of this research was to analyze the vulnerability to climate variability of the beef cattle ranching communities of the municipalities of Acatic and of Tepatitlan de Morelos, Jalisco, Mexico. These municipalities are found in a region of the state referred to as \"Los Altos\". The economy of Los Altos largely relies on agricultural and farming practices; these sectors provide the largest source of employment in the area. In the two municipalities that comprise the study area, the beef cattle industry is one of the strongest economic activities. Climate variability poses great threat on these communities because the main economic activities of the region are highly dependent on natural resources. To have a better understanding of the human-environment interactions in this region, remote sensing methods were applied. Three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images (years: 1985, 1993 and 2000) were employed to generate land use and land cover classification maps of the study area; these maps were then subjected to a change detections analysis. Some of the land use and land cover categories experienced more change than others; among those was the category of water, shrub land and crop land. The area covered by water nearly doubled from 1985 to 1993 and then nearly decreased by half by the year 2000. From 1985 to 1993, here was a decrease in the shrub land of about 1200 ha and concurrently an increase in the crop land of about 1400 ha.

In 2008, Mexico had 2101 MWW treatment plants that treated only 84 m3/s of wastewater (208 m3/s ofMWW were collected in sewer systems). Unfortunately, most treatment plants operate below capacity owing to a lack of maintenance and paucity of properly trained personnel. The main types of treatment systems applied in Mexico are activated sludge and waste stabilization ponds, which treat 44.3% and 18% of the MWW collected, respectively. As in many other developing nations around the world, there is a great need in Mexico for low-cost, low-maintenance wastewater treatment systems that are both economically and environmentally sustainable. In 2005, 24.3 million Mexicans lived in villages of less than 2500 inhabitants and 14.1 million lived in towns with 2500-15,000 inhabitants. An opportunity exists to extend the use of ecological treatment systems to these low population density areas and considerably increase the percentage of MWW that is treated in Mexico. Small-scale and medium-size constructed wetlands have been built successfully in some states, primarily during the past five years. Several barriers need to be overcome to increase the adoption and utilization of ecological wastewater technology in Mexico, including: a lack of knowledge about this technology, scarce technical information in Spanish, and the government's concentration on constructing MWW treatment plants solely in urban areas.\n\n[Eating-nutritional interculturality in the Wixarika ethnic group of Mexico].\n\nPubMed\n\nCrocker Sagastume, RenÃ©; CosÃ­o GonzÃ¡lez, Antonio Tunuri; LÃ³pez LÃ³pez, Martina Haulima; Ruiz DomÃ­nguez, Liah; Andrade UreÃ±a, Diana; GutiÃ©rrez GÃ³mez, Yareni\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe high prevalence of eating-nutritional problems and the low degree of impact the food programs have, mainly because the cosmovision of this people has been overlooked warrants the recovery of the eating-nutritional culture of the Wixarika ethnic group in Mexico. This research is aimed at providing elements for constructing a sustainable, intercultaral, participation-based eating and nutrition model bringing together modernity and this people's ancestral taditions. The participative action based on the Sociocritical epistemology was employed as the research methodology with the in-depth survey and participating ethnography techniques. This research was conducted in the Wixarika of Santa Catarina Cuexcomatitlan community in the municipality of Mezquitic, Jalisco, Mexico. The foods eaten by the Wixarika people have a religious meaning, in which corn is the main connecting force of their food-related cosmovision. As most Mesoamerican cultures, the basis of food production and consumption is comprised by the \"three sisters: corn, beans and squash, to which jitomate and chile have been added, as well as the gathering of foods from the surrounding environment such as fungus, chelites and nopal, foods which, on being produced and eaten in sufficient quantities and properly combined may provide for this ethic group being properly fed. Food comprises a central aspect in the way in which the cosmovision of the Wixarika people is set out, these being representations and meanings which must be integrated in order to model which will ensure the eating-nutritional soundness of this ethnic group.\n\nThree new species of Pambolus (Braconidae: Pambolinae) from Mexico, with comments on the variation of P. oblongispina Papp.\n\nPubMed\n\nAguilera-Uribe, Magali; MartÃnez, Juan josÃ; ZaldÃvar-riverÃn, Alejandro\n\n2018-01-31\n\nThree species of the braconid genus Pambolus (Braconidae) are described from Mexico: P. jarocho sp. n., P. chinanteco sp. n. and P. bizelab sp. n.

J.; Escudero, C. R.; Nunez-Cornu, F. J.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe direct measure of the earthquake fault dimension represent a complicated task nevertheless a better approach is using the seismic waves spectrum. With this method we can estimate the dimensions of the fault, the stress drop and the seismic moment. The study area comprises the complex tectonic configuration of Jalisco block and the subduction of the Rivera plate beneath the North American plate; this causes that occur in Jalisco some of the most harmful earthquakes and other related natural disasters. Accordingly it is important to monitor and perform studies that helps to understand the physics of earthquake rupture mechanism in the area. The main proposue of this study is estimate earthquake seismic source parameters. The data was recorded by the MARS network (Mapping the Riviera Subduction Zone) and the RESAJ network. MARS had 51 stations and settled in the Jalisco block; that is delimited by the mesoamerican trench at the west, the Colima grabben to the south, and the Tepic-Zacoalco to the north; for a period of time, of January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2007 Of this network was taken 104 events, the magnitude range of these was between 3 to 6.5 MB. RESJAL has 10 stations and is within the state of Jalisco, began to record since October 2011 and continues to record. We firs remove the trend, the mean and the instrument response, then manually chosen the S wave, then the multitaper method was used to obtain the spectrum of this wave and so estimate the corner frequency and the spectra level. We substitude the obtained in the equations of the Brune model to calculate the source parameters. Doing this we obtained the following results; the source radius was between .1 to 2 km, the stress drop was between .1 to 2 MPa.\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) virus in poultry workers, Mexico, 2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nLopez-Martinez, Irma; Balish, Amanda; Barrera-Badillo, Gisela; Jones, Joyce; NuÃ±ez-GarcÃ­a, Tatiana E; Jang, Yunho; Aparicio-Antonio, Rodrigo; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Belser, Jessica A; Ramirez-Gonzalez, JosÃ© E; Pedersen, Janice C; Ortiz-Alcantara, Joanna; Gonzalez-Duran, Elizabeth; Shu, Bo; Emery, Shannon L; Poh, Mee K; Reyes-Teran, Gustavo; Vazquez-Perez, Joel A; Avila-Rios, Santiago; Uyeki, Timothy; Lindstrom, Stephen; Villanueva, Julie; Tokars, Jerome; Ruiz-Matus, CuitlÃ¡huac; Gonzalez-Roldan, Jesus F; Schmitt, Beverly; Klimov, Alexander; Cox, Nancy; Kuri-Morales, Pablo; Davis, C Todd; Diaz-QuiÃ±onez, JosÃ© Alberto\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe identified 2 poultry workers with conjunctivitis caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) viruses in Jalisco, Mexico.

This study was conducted between May and July 2002. The fluoride concentrations of 105 water wells and six tap water samples were electrochemically measured. Exposure doses to fluoride and total intake of fluoride were estimated for babies (10 kg), children (20 kg), and adults (70 kg). The fluoride concentration of the water samples ranged from 0.1 to 17.7 mg/l. More than 45% of the water samples exceeded the national guideline value for fluoride of 1.5 mg/l. The estimated values of the exposure doses to fluoride and total intake of fluoride were in the range of 0.04-1.8 mg/kg/d and 0.5-18.4 mg/d, respectively. Dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, and bone fractures are some of the potential health risks due to the intake of high doses of fluoride for the population of Los Altos de Jalisco. In order to reduce health risks, fluoridated salt,fluoridated toothpastes, and drinking water containing more than 0.7 mg/l of fluoride should be avoided.\n\nPotential Flooding area for local Tsunami in Nayarit Region (Western Coast of Mexico).\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTrejo-Gomez, E.; Ortiz, M.; NuÃ±ez-Cornu, F. J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe western coast of Mexico in the region of Jalisco and Nayarit states has a complex tectonics and a high seismic activity. In the last century, four big tsunamis occurred in this area, (three of them in 1932 and one in 1995, that hit the coast of Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit. Three of these tsunamis were generated by earthquakes and one more (22 June 1932) by an underwater landslide. Currently, there is a seismic Gap on the north coast of Jalisco and southern Nayarit. Recent published papers (UrÃ­as-Espinosa et al, 2016) and the first results of TsuJal Project (NÃºÃ±ez- CornÃº et al, 2016) suggest that subduction regime to the north of Cabo Corrientes changes and the Rivera plate subducts with a very low angle and this structure remains until Maria Madre Island at north of the Marias Islands. The hypothesis of this work is the estimation of the tsunami run up and the flooding zone after a great magnitude earthquake generated by the rupture of the hypothetical subduction structure north of Cabo Corrientes. The possible effects on the coasts of Nayarit, Islas Marias and Banderas Bay (Puerto Vallarta) are proposed in this study.\n\nMolecular characterization of the spike gene of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Mexico, 2013-2016.\n\nPubMed\n\nLara-Romero, RocÃ­o; GÃ³mez-NÃºÃ±ez, Luis; CerriteÃ±o-SÃ¡nchez, JosÃ© Luis; MÃ¡rquez-Valdelamar, Laura; Mendoza-Elvira, Susana; RamÃ­rez-Mendoza, Humberto; Rivera-BenÃ­tez, JosÃ© Francisco\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn Mexico, the first outbreaks suggestive of the circulation of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) were identified at the beginning of July 2013. To identify the molecular characteristics of the PEDV Spike (S) gene in Mexico, 116 samples of the intestine and diarrhea of piglets with clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) were obtained. Samples were collected from 14 farms located in six states of Mexico (Jalisco, Puebla, Sonora, Veracruz, Guanajuato, and MichoacÃ¡n) from 2013 to 2016. To identify PEDV, we used real-time RT-PCR to discriminate between non-INDEL and INDEL strains. We chose samples according to state and year to characterize the S gene. After amplification of the S gene, the obtained products were sequenced and assembled. The complete amino acid sequences of the spike protein were used to perform an epitope analysis, which was used to determine null mutations in regions SS2, SS6, and 2C10 compared to the sequences of G2. A phylogenetic analysis determined the circulation of G2b and INDEL strains in Mexico. However, several mutations were recorded in the collagenase equivalent (COE) region that were related to the change in polarity and charge of the amino acid residues. The PEDV strain circulating in Jalisco in 2016 has an insertion of three amino acids ( 232 LGL 234 ) and one change in the antigenic site of the COE region, and strains from the years 2015 and 2016 changed the index of the surface probability, which could be related to the re-emergence of disease outbreaks.\n\n[Perceptions of adolescents Jalisco campaign on breast cancer].\n\nPubMed\n\nTapia-Curiel, Amparo; NuÃ±o-GutiÃ©rrez, Bertha Lidia; Flores-Padilla, Luis; VillaseÃ±or-FarÃ­as, Martha; LÃ³pez-LÃ³pez, JosÃ© Luis; Covarrubias-BermÃºdez, MarÃ­a de los Ãngeles\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBreast cancer campaigns and awareness strategies with limited evidence of their effectiveness in youth. Behavioral model of perception that shows how individuals choose, organize and interpret information. This study shows the perceptions of youth from Jalisco regarding breast cancer campaigns. Cross-sectional qualitative exploratory study based on constructionist and associationist theories of perception. Informed consent interviews with 13 focus groups, 129 men and women between 12 and 19 years old, enrolled students, residents of 6 regions of Jalisco. The sampling consisted in snowball technique. Interviews transcribed and processed with Atlas Ti version 4.1, open coding analysis. 10 campaigns were identified and the perceptions about them showed 3 processes: 1) SELECTION: permeated by the campaign design elements; 2) ORGANIZATION: influenced by pre-structured meanings of the color pink, scope and limitations of the campaigns; and 3) INTERPRETATION: showed judgments about the visibility of breast cancer, accessibility of knowledge and resources, permeability of positive ads and cultural codes and the lack of coverage meeting expectations. A high awareness of breast cancer among teenagers was evident as well as the extensive need of information and services. We recommend creating strategies for formal education about breast cancer during adolescence.\n\nNew state records and updated checklist of Aphodiini and EupariiniÂ (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Aphodiinae) from Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinor, Pablo\n\n2017-03-22\n\nThirty one new state records of species of Aphodiinae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) from Mexico are presented, 24 species belong to Aphodiini and seven species to Eupariini into the genera Agrilinellus, Alloblackburneus, Aphotaenius, Ataenius, Blackburneus, Cephalocyclus, Coelotrachelus, Euparia, Euparixia, Geomyphilus, Gonaphodiellus, Gonaphodiopsis, Haroldiellus, Liothorax, Nialaphodius, Odontolytes, Oscarinus, Pharaphodius, and Planolinellus. New records are from the states of Aguascalientes, Baja California, Baja California Sur, Campeche, Colima, Chiapas, Estado de MÃ©xico, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, MichoacÃ¡n, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, Sonora, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Zacatecas, and Distrito Federal. A checklist with updated nomenclature is included for the recorded species of Aphodiini and Eupariini from Mexico.\n\nPrevalence of bovine subclinical mastitis, its etiology and diagnosis of antibiotic resistance of dairy farms in four municipalities of a tropical region of Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlivares-PÃ©rez, Jaime; Kholif, Ahmed Eid; Rojas-HernÃ¡ndez, Saul; Elghandour, Mona Mohamed Mohamed Yasseen; Salem, Abdelfattah Zeidan Mohamed; Bastida, Adrian Zaragoza; VelÃ¡zquez-Reynoso, David; Cipriano-Salazar, MoisÃ©s; Camacho-DÃ­az, Luis Miguel; Alonso-FresÃ¡n, MarÃ­a UxÃºa; DiLorenzo, Nicolas\n\n2015-12-01\n\nA region-wide survey was conducted in the tropical area of Tierra Caliente, State of Guerrero, Mexico to estimate the prevalence of subclinical bovine mastitis (SCM), distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens in dairy farms. In total, 1036 quarter milk samples were obtained from 259 cows at 87 different dairy farms. Collected quarter milk samples were submitted for California Mastitis Test (CMT), bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. Overall prevalence of SCM in the studied area was 20.5Â %. Prevalence in the different regions was as follows: 28Â % in ArceliaÂ municipality, 21Â % in TlalchapaÂ municipality, 19.4Â % in PungarabatoÂ municipality, and 14.3Â % in Finch CutzamalaÂ municipality. Of all positive isolates, 97.5Â % were Gram-negativeÂ bacteria. Moreover, of all positive isolates, 37.5Â % were Proteus vulgaris, 25Â % Salmonella spp., 12.5Â % Enterobacter aerogenes, and 10Â % Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumonia and E. coli were sensitive for netilmicin antimicrobial. However, E. coli was sensitive for pefloxacin and gentamicin with a sensitivity for pefloxacin for E. aerogenes, while Staphylococci were sensitive for gentamicin and dicloxacillin. It could be concluded that practices such as the implementation of mastitis control programs, improved milking hygiene together with an intramammary treatment with netilmicin, pefloxacin, and gentamicin antimicrobials should be considered for mastitis prevention in the study area of Tierra Caliente, in the tropical area of Guerrero, Mexico.\n\n[Acute Chagas' disease in an 80-year-old woman in Mexico.
