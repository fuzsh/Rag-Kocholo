Sign up for our FREE Webinar.\n\nHere's what we'll cover:\n\nMost Popular Kafka Interview Questions and Answers\n\nAdvanced Kafka Interview Questions and Answers\n\nKafka Interview Questions for Practice\n\nFAQs on Kafka Interview Questions\n\nMost Popular Kafka Interview Questions and Answers\n\nYou must be thoroughly familiar with the most common topics for the Kafka interview questions. Here are some sample Kafka interview questions and answers to help you quickly revise the most vital concepts.\n\nQ1. What is Apache Kafka?\n\nApache Kafka is an open-source, partitioned, and replicated log service and publish-subscribe messaging application. It is also a full-fledged event streaming platform developed by Apache and written in Scala.\n\nQ2. What are the main features of Kafka?\n\nYou should be well-prepared for Kafka features interview questions. The interviewer can also ask about any one of the features in particular. The top features of Apache Kafka are as follows:\n\nKafka is written in the Scala programming language and developed by Apache.\n\nIt is a publish-subscribe messaging system with high throughput and fault tolerance.\n\nIt is deployable in minutes.\n\nKafka is fast because a single Kafka broker can handle megabytes of reads and writes per second and serve thousands of clients.\n\nYou can partition data and streamline over a cluster of machines to enable larger data.\n\nConfluent Cloud is the cloud Kafka service that provides enterprise-grade features, security, and zero ops burden.\n\nIt offers enterprise-grade security.\n\nYou can reduce the ops burden using Kafka.\n\nKafka has a built-in partition system ï¿½Topic.\n\nIt offers the replication feature.\n\nKafka queue can handle large amounts of data and transfer messages from one sender to another.\n\nIt can also save the messages to storage and replicate them across the cluster.\n\nIt collaborates with Zookeeper to synchronize with other services.\n\nQ3. What are the different components in Apache Kafka?\n\nThis is one of the most important Kafka interview questions as the interviewer can ask you to elaborate on the various components too. The important components available in Kafka are as follows:\n\nTopic: It is a collection or a stream of messages belonging to the same type.\n\nProducer: It is used to issue communications and publish messages to a specific Kafka topic. It optimizes writing to Kafka.\n\nConsumer: You can use Kafka consumers to subscribe to a topic and read and process messages from the topic. A consumer facilitates optimal consumption of Kafka data. Their primary role is to take Kafka connection and consumer properties to read the appropriate Kafka broker records.\n\nBrokers: They are a set of servers capable of storing publisher messages. They manage the storage of messages in the topic.\n\nQ4. What is the significance of ZooKeeper in Kafka? Can we use Kafka without ZooKeeper?\n\nThe ZooKeeper stores offset-related information used to consume a specific topic and by a specific consumer group in the Kafka environment. It builds coordination between different nodes in a cluster. You can also use ZooKeeper to recover from previously committed offset if any node fails because it works as a periodically-commit offset.\n\nIt is impossible to avoid Zookeeper and directly connect to the Kafka server. You cannot serve any client request in Kafka if ZooKeeper is down.\n\nQ5. What API architectures does Kafka use?\n\nKafka uses the following four core APIs:\n\nProducer API enables an application to publish a stream of records to Kafka topics.\n\nConsumer API enables an application to subscribe to one or more Kafka topics in addition to allowing the application to process streams of records generated about such topics.\n\nStreams API allows an application to use a stream processing architecture and process data. You can also use it to take input streams from topics, process them using stream operations, and generate output streams transmitting to more topics. Streams API also helps convert input streams into output streams.\n\nConnect API or Connector API connects Kafka topics to applications. It constructs and manages the operations of consumers and producers to establish reusable links between these solutions.\n\nQ6. What are the limitations of Kafka?\n\nYou should be well-versed with the drawbacks while answering Kafka interview questions. You can consider the following list of disadvantages of Kafka:\n\nThe performance of Kafka degrades when the messages are continuously updated or changed.\n\nIts throughput gets reduced by brokers and consumers when they have to deal with the data by compressing and decompressing the messages.\n\nKafka does not support wildcard topic selection, certain message paradigms such as to request/reply, and point-to-point queues.\n\nIt lacks a complete set of monitoring tools.\n\nQ7. What is load balancing? How is load balancing of the server in Kafka done?\n\nKafka producers handle the load balancing process by default, wherein they spread out the message load between partitions, preserving message ordering. You can specify the exact partition for a message in Kafka.\n\nLeaders in Kafka perform all read and write requests for the partition, and followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers takes over the role, and this entire process ensures load balancing of the servers.\n\nQ8. What roles do Replicas and the ISR play?\n\nReplicas are a list of nodes. They replicate the log for a particular partition irrespective of whether they play the role of the leader.\n\nISR stands for In-Sync Replicas, and it is a set of message replicas synced to the leaders.\n\nAdvanced Kafka Interview Questions and Answers\n\nYou should also prepare some Kafka tough interview questions to nail the most challenging software engineer tech interview rounds at FAANG.\n\nInterviewers often put up Kafka interview questions that require comparisons between Kafka and its alternatives. The following table states the main points of difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ:\n\nQ2. What is the difference between Kafka and Flume?\n\nThe major differences between Kafka and Flume are:\n\nQ3. When does QueueFullException occur in Producers?\n\nQueueFullException occurs when the producer tries to send messages at a pace that the broker cannot handle. You will have to add enough brokers to collaboratively handle the increased load as the producer doesn't block.\n\nQ4. What are Znodes in Zookeeper? State the different types of Znodes.\n\nZnodes are nodes in a ZooKeeper tree. They keep version numbers for data modifications, ACL changes, and timestamps in a structure. ZooKeeper utilizes the version number and timestamp to verify the cache while guaranteeing that updates are well-coordinated. The version number connected grows each time the data on Znode changes.\n\nThere are three types of znodes in ZooKeeper:\n\nPersistence znodes are the znodes that continue to function even after the client who produced them is disconnected, i.e., they are persistent by default.\n\nEphemeral znodes are active only while the client is still alive. These znodes are automatically removed when the client who produced them disconnects. They participate in the election of the leader.\n\nSequential znode can be either persistent or ephemeral. The ZooKeeper chooses the sequential number and is pre-fixed when the client assigns a name to the znode.\n\nQ5. What is the Kafka cluster? What happens when the Kafka Cluster goes down?\n\nThis is one of the frequently asked Kafka interview questions. A Kafka has one or more brokers that act as the Controller. The producers push records into Kafka topics within the broker while consumers pull records off a Kafka topic.\n\nIf one or more brokers of the Kafka cluster are down, the producer will retry for a certain time (based on the settings). One or more of the consumers will not be able to read anything during this time until the respective brokers are up.\n\nQ6. What are the types of system tools?\n\nThe three types of system tools are:\n\nKafka migration tool that helps to migrate a broker from one version to another.\n\nMirror maker assists in offering to mirror one Kafka cluster to another.\n\nConsumer offset checker shows topic, partitions, and owner for the specified set of topics and consumer group.\n\nQ7. What are replication tools?\n\nThe types of replication tools are:\n\nCreate topic tool\n\nList topic tool\n\nAdd partition tool\n\nQ8. What is the advantage of Java in Kafka?\n\nYou can use Java for the need of the high processing rates that are standard on Kafka. Java also offers good community support for Kafka consumer clients, and Kafka's native API is in Java.\n\nQ9. What is BufferExhaustedException in Kafka? What do you understand about the OutOfMemoryException?\n\nA BufferExhaustedException is thrown when the producer is unable to assign memory to a record as the buffer is full. When the production rate exceeds the rate of data transfer from the buffer for long enough, and the producer is in non-blocking mode, the allocated buffer will be depleted, and the exception will be thrown.\n\nAn OutOfMemoryException arises when the consumers are sending huge messages, or there is a spike in messages sent at a quicker rate than the rate of downstream processing, and the message queue fills up, consuming memory space.\n\nQ10. Can you change the number of partitions for a topic in Kafka?\n\nKafka does not permit you to reduce the number of partitions for a topic. However, you can expand the partitions. The alter command enables you to change the behavior and its associated configurations of a topic. You can use the following alter command and increase the partitions to five:\n\n./bin/kafka-topics.sh --alter --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic sample-topic --partitions 5\n\nKafka Interview Questions for Practice\n\nWhat is the main method of message transfer in Kafka?\n\nWhat role does offset play in Kafka?\n\nWhat are leaders and followers in the Kafka environment?\n\nWhat is geo-replication in Kafka?\n\nWhat is log anatomy in Kafka?\n\nWhat is sharding?\n\nWhat is the significance of the retention period in the Kafka cluster?\n\nHow will you change retention time in Kafka?\n\nHow is a partitioning key?\n\nExplain the following: Kafka Metrics, Log Aggregation, Stream Processing.\n\nWhat is the graceful shutdown in Kafka?\n\nWhat does Kafka guarantee?\n\nThis completes the list of Kafka interview questions that you must practice for your next tech interview.

Here are some sample Kafka interview questions and answers to help you quickly revise the most vital concepts.\n\nQ1. What is Apache Kafka?\n\nApache Kafka is an open-source, partitioned, and replicated log service and publish-subscribe messaging application. It is also a full-fledged event streaming platform developed by Apache and written in Scala.\n\nQ2. What are the main features of Kafka?\n\nYou should be well-prepared for Kafka features interview questions. The interviewer can also ask about any one of the features in particular. The top features of Apache Kafka are as follows:\n\nKafka is written in the Scala programming language and developed by Apache.\n\nIt is a publish-subscribe messaging system with high throughput and fault tolerance.\n\nIt is deployable in minutes.\n\nKafka is fast because a single Kafka broker can handle megabytes of reads and writes per second and serve thousands of clients.\n\nYou can partition data and streamline over a cluster of machines to enable larger data.\n\nConfluent Cloud is the cloud Kafka service that provides enterprise-grade features, security, and zero ops burden.\n\nIt offers enterprise-grade security.\n\nYou can reduce the ops burden using Kafka.\n\nKafka has a built-in partition system ï¿½Topic.\n\nIt offers the replication feature.\n\nKafka queue can handle large amounts of data and transfer messages from one sender to another.\n\nIt can also save the messages to storage and replicate them across the cluster.\n\nIt collaborates with Zookeeper to synchronize with other services.\n\nQ3. What are the different components in Apache Kafka?\n\nThis is one of the most important Kafka interview questions as the interviewer can ask you to elaborate on the various components too. The important components available in Kafka are as follows:\n\nTopic: It is a collection or a stream of messages belonging to the same type.\n\nProducer: It is used to issue communications and publish messages to a specific Kafka topic. It optimizes writing to Kafka.\n\nConsumer: You can use Kafka consumers to subscribe to a topic and read and process messages from the topic. A consumer facilitates optimal consumption of Kafka data. Their primary role is to take Kafka connection and consumer properties to read the appropriate Kafka broker records.\n\nBrokers: They are a set of servers capable of storing publisher messages. They manage the storage of messages in the topic.\n\nQ4. What is the significance of ZooKeeper in Kafka? Can we use Kafka without ZooKeeper?\n\nThe ZooKeeper stores offset-related information used to consume a specific topic and by a specific consumer group in the Kafka environment. It builds coordination between different nodes in a cluster. You can also use ZooKeeper to recover from previously committed offset if any node fails because it works as a periodically-commit offset.\n\nIt is impossible to avoid Zookeeper and directly connect to the Kafka server. You cannot serve any client request in Kafka if ZooKeeper is down.\n\nQ5. What API architectures does Kafka use?\n\nKafka uses the following four core APIs:\n\nProducer API enables an application to publish a stream of records to Kafka topics.\n\nConsumer API enables an application to subscribe to one or more Kafka topics in addition to allowing the application to process streams of records generated about such topics.\n\nStreams API allows an application to use a stream processing architecture and process data. You can also use it to take input streams from topics, process them using stream operations, and generate output streams transmitting to more topics. Streams API also helps convert input streams into output streams.\n\nConnect API or Connector API connects Kafka topics to applications. It constructs and manages the operations of consumers and producers to establish reusable links between these solutions.\n\nQ6. What are the limitations of Kafka?\n\nYou should be well-versed with the drawbacks while answering Kafka interview questions. You can consider the following list of disadvantages of Kafka:\n\nThe performance of Kafka degrades when the messages are continuously updated or changed.\n\nIts throughput gets reduced by brokers and consumers when they have to deal with the data by compressing and decompressing the messages.\n\nKafka does not support wildcard topic selection, certain message paradigms such as to request/reply, and point-to-point queues.\n\nIt lacks a complete set of monitoring tools.\n\nQ7. What is load balancing? How is load balancing of the server in Kafka done?\n\nKafka producers handle the load balancing process by default, wherein they spread out the message load between partitions, preserving message ordering. You can specify the exact partition for a message in Kafka.\n\nLeaders in Kafka perform all read and write requests for the partition, and followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers takes over the role, and this entire process ensures load balancing of the servers.\n\nQ8. What roles do Replicas and the ISR play?\n\nReplicas are a list of nodes. They replicate the log for a particular partition irrespective of whether they play the role of the leader.\n\nISR stands for In-Sync Replicas, and it is a set of message replicas synced to the leaders.\n\nAdvanced Kafka Interview Questions and Answers\n\nYou should also prepare some Kafka tough interview questions to nail the most challenging software engineer tech interview rounds at FAANG.\n\nInterviewers often put up Kafka interview questions that require comparisons between Kafka and its alternatives. The following table states the main points of difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ:\n\nQ2. What is the difference between Kafka and Flume?\n\nThe major differences between Kafka and Flume are:\n\nQ3. When does QueueFullException occur in Producers?\n\nQueueFullException occurs when the producer tries to send messages at a pace that the broker cannot handle. You will have to add enough brokers to collaboratively handle the increased load as the producer doesn't block.\n\nQ4. What are Znodes in Zookeeper? State the different types of Znodes.\n\nZnodes are nodes in a ZooKeeper tree. They keep version numbers for data modifications, ACL changes, and timestamps in a structure. ZooKeeper utilizes the version number and timestamp to verify the cache while guaranteeing that updates are well-coordinated. The version number connected grows each time the data on Znode changes.\n\nThere are three types of znodes in ZooKeeper:\n\nPersistence znodes are the znodes that continue to function even after the client who produced them is disconnected, i.e., they are persistent by default.\n\nEphemeral znodes are active only while the client is still alive. These znodes are automatically removed when the client who produced them disconnects. They participate in the election of the leader.\n\nSequential znode can be either persistent or ephemeral. The ZooKeeper chooses the sequential number and is pre-fixed when the client assigns a name to the znode.\n\nQ5. What is the Kafka cluster? What happens when the Kafka Cluster goes down?\n\nThis is one of the frequently asked Kafka interview questions. A Kafka has one or more brokers that act as the Controller. The producers push records into Kafka topics within the broker while consumers pull records off a Kafka topic.\n\nIf one or more brokers of the Kafka cluster are down, the producer will retry for a certain time (based on the settings). One or more of the consumers will not be able to read anything during this time until the respective brokers are up.\n\nQ6. What are the types of system tools?\n\nThe three types of system tools are:\n\nKafka migration tool that helps to migrate a broker from one version to another.\n\nMirror maker assists in offering to mirror one Kafka cluster to another.\n\nConsumer offset checker shows topic, partitions, and owner for the specified set of topics and consumer group.\n\nQ7. What are replication tools?\n\nThe types of replication tools are:\n\nCreate topic tool\n\nList topic tool\n\nAdd partition tool\n\nQ8. What is the advantage of Java in Kafka?\n\nYou can use Java for the need of the high processing rates that are standard on Kafka. Java also offers good community support for Kafka consumer clients, and Kafka's native API is in Java.\n\nQ9. What is BufferExhaustedException in Kafka?
