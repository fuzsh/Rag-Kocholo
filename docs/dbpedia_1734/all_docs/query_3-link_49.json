        "text": "In recent debates, the term “creature” has gained centrality in a number of discourses and disciplines: on the one hand, it has been used as a way of challenging the human/animal divide and imagining forms of inter-species solidarity on the base of a shared “creaturely” vulnerability and precarity; on the other, it has been used to analyse the subjection of specifically human life to sovereign forms of power, as in Eric Santner’s use of the term “creaturely life”. This essay focuses on Kafka’s creatures and attempts to show how the two uses of the term are intertwined and inseparable: “creaturely life” means, in all its declinations (human and nonhuman animals), to be subjected to a sovereign power, to be an “animal before the law”, whereby the animal subjection to the human sovereign (to humans as sovereign) epitomizes the biopolitical paradigm. A reading of Kafka’s story “The New Advocate” aims at showing how Kafka’s Messianism points towards a way out from the biopolitical predicament.\n\nBoth Plato’s dialogues, as ancient literary philosophy, and Kafka’s stories, as modern philosophical literature, incorporate divine revelation as part of a dialectical dissection of values. Plato's dialogues repeatedly invoke, then scrutinize presumably divine imperatives for action: supernatural lawgivers are dismissed in the Laws and the afterlife is emphatically a myth or story in three different tellings in the Republic, Phaedo, and Gorgias; the Oracle at Delphi and Socrates’ sign in the Apology both seem to provide a privileged connection to the divine, yet are undercut as simple imperatives by tendentious philosophical interpretation, just as “piety” is interrogated in the Euthyphro. Kafka, analogously, approaches revelation in several stories and withdraws it quite clearly. He brings us to the outwards signs of it, to the need for it, to the aesthetics of it (\"In the Penal Colony,\" “Before the Law,” and “Jackals and Arabs”) but also to the fact the modern world cannot accept it. Contrasting these two thinkers’ reworkings of culturally accepted theological imperatives from different eras and genres provides insight into their shared dialectical method. Each includes the framework and aspects of supernatural revelation, then subverts through further plot turns (Kafka) or philosophical discussion (Plato) the presumed commandment predicated on access to the divine. Each has moments where they swing the focus, unexpectedly, to the animal. The unusual negation of the human but retention in anthropomorphism, hybridity, metaphor, or parable, demonstrates the work of thought, askew from where we expected it to be. The self-conscious poesis in each is part of an attempt to shift perspective internally, addressing life and the negative of death through already internalizing the animal, in a proliferating dialectic. Their procedure--part game, part indictment--forces us interlocutors to return through their methods of negation and reengaging the non-human world, to think the person-animal, animal-person, and thus rethink the human in the unrevealed political world.\n\nThis essay investigates a specific notion and practice of writing that may explain and make sense of: a) certain graphic features of Kafka’s handwriting (Part 1); b) several „conceptual” remarks about his “intransitive” way of writing (Part 2); c) some narrative texts, most notably “Ein Traum” and the Hunter Gracchus fragments (Part 3). Considering the connection of these three elements, which intertwine in an exemplary way in Kafka, the essay proposes a new perspective on the aesthetics of Kafka’s “style”—namely, the practice of what will be described as “fetishistic inscription” and subsequently explored in its poetological relevance. The attempt to excavate a moment of identity, that is to say, an essential belonging-together of the threefold nexus, marks the phenomenological method of the investigation. Finally, the exemplary relationship between graphics and notions of selfhood in Kafka may enable us to glimpse a fundamental modality in which subjects relate to their script (Part 4). (CJ)\n\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty takes inspiration from Franz Kafka’s metonymic animal literature to develop his concepts of institution and “sardonic humanism.” Metonymy is a literary device, an instituting dimension of language, that allows us a lateral access to animality and expression. Kafka’s dog story enacts a radical reflection, a critical phenomenology parodying human life. Kafka puts forward a philosophy of generative openness to the animal, against social alienation. This reading comes with Merleau-Ponty’s existential redeployment of Sigmund Freud’s concept of the unconscious as expressive passivity or institution of adulthood. As instituting–instituted, we are always between preserving and surpassing the past, though different comportments and institutions can dogmatically or openly take up these possibilities. Kafka’s (struggle through) metonymic animal literature reminds us that philosophical truth is expressive, that unconscious desire animates language, and that the oppressive silencing of the generative past, the feeling child and the other animal, is at the root of society’s institutionalized oppression. Institution offers a literary method of phenomenologically resisting, of creative critique."
