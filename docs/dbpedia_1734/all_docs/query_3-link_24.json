This document analyzes how Franz Kafka depicts time and reality in his novels The Trial and The Castle. It discusses how Kafka creates a dreamlike quality to time where characters experience an \"interior time\" separate from clock time. Events in the novels seem to occur simultaneously as dreams and realities. Kafka also depicts the main characters Josef K. and K. as existing in a state of constant present, where the past and future have no reality outside of their inner experiences and thoughts in the moment. This achieves Kafka's goal of showing life as both a natural progression but also as an illusion or dream.",
