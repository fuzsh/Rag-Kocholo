        "text": "online and in-person in Austria\n\nThis page is for registration to attend online only. If you would like to register to attend the event in-person at Dzokden Kalapa, please click here.\n\nBhutanese (English )\n\n中文 (Traditional Chinese) Hong Kong / Taiwan\n\n中文 (Simplified Chinese) China / Singapore / Malaysia\n\nМонгол\n\nDeutsche (Germany, Switzerland, Austria)\n\nTiếng Việt (Vietnamese)\n\nEspañol (Puerto Rico, Spain and South America)\n\nItaliano (Italy)\n\nMagyar (Hungary)\n\nPortuguese (Brasil & Portugal)\n\nRomână (Romania)\n\nSouth Africa\n\nFrancais\n\nSlovenian\n\nAbout the Practice of Chöd\n\nOur attitude of self-cherishing is one of the main obstacles on our spiritual path. Although this attitude fuels biased feelings and the many afflictions, we can approach this challenge using either direct or indirect means. Indirect methods work with the conditions of self-cherishing, preventing them from arising in the future, whereas direct methods work with the actual mind of self-cherishing to remove its capacity to harm us. To this end, the practice of Chöd is universally recognised as one of the best ways to eradicate the self-cherishing mind. This unique practice lineage can be found in all of the major Tibetan traditions.\n\nThe Tibetan yogini Machik Labdrön developed her unique practice of Mahamudra Chöd. A chöd pa (Chöd practitioner) can cut through anything. Throughout Buddhist history, female practitioners have embodied the qualities of leadership in virtuous conduct, meditation and practice. Machik Labdrön is an extraordinary example of a highly realized female practitioner. Shar Khentrul Rinpoche has an aspiration to cultivate more realized female practitioners around the world, and we hope that this practice will support more female masters to manifest prominently.\n\nRinpoche has received the Chöd transmissions and practiced it in multiple traditions, including the Nyingma, Kagyu, Jonang, and Gelug traditions. He had the honor to receive a transmission directly from the 9th Kalka Jetsun Dhampa—former spiritual head of Mongolia, who is also considered to be a reincarnation of Jetsun Taranatha—and to practice a Chöd retreat with him.\n\nKhentrul Rinpoche with the 9th Kalka Jetsun Dhampa.\n\nAbout the Empowerment and Retreat\n\nThis is a rare and precious empowerment of Chöd from the primordial mind of master Jetsun Taranatha. You will receive a booklet to follow along throughout the whole empowerment. Part of the text includes inspiring stories about Machik Labdrön’s life.\n\nThis event includes the following:\n\nIntroductory Teaching\n\nPreparatory Practice to the Empowerment\n\n“The Chöd Empowerment that Opens the Gates to the Sky” written by Jestun Taranatha\n\nOral Transmission of “Subduing Through Splendour” (a traditional Chöd Sadhana of the Jonang Tradition)\n\nOral Transmission of “A Brief Practice of Object Severance” (a condensed Chöd Sadhana written by Shar Khentrul Rinpoche)\n\nTranslated Texts of the Empowerment Booklet and Sadhanas\n\nDaily group and individual practice sessions with senior students\n\nChöd Teaching with Rinpoche, including Taranatha’s Commentary on Chöd\n\nQ&A session with Rinpoche\n\nThe elements below will also be included for those attending in person:\n\n10.Group Dharma Discussions\n\n11. Optional daily body practice guided by qualified yoga teachers\n\n12. Optional personal/group interview with Rinpoche (upon request)\n\n13. Optional Walk in the nature around Kalapa with Rinpoche\n\n14. Printed texts\n\n15. Food and Accommodation\n\nParticipants online are encouraged to take part in as many live sessions as possible. However, all the teachings and the scheduled practice sessions will be recorded, and can be accessed later in our online learning center. As usual, the empowerment and oral transmissions must be attended live and will not be recorded.\n\nWho can attend?\n\nThis event is open to all. There are no formal prerequisites to attend. However, previous Buddhist study and practice (such as the Ngöndro) are very helpful. If you are new to the Buddhist path, you may also like to study beforehand Khentrul Rinpoche’s course titled “What’s Real?” in our learning center and to read Books One and Two of Rinpoche’s trilogy “Unveiling Your Sacred Truth”.\n\nAdditional Info for those attending in person:\n\nIf you are participating in person and need live translation, you must provide your own internet connection and bring earphones to listen to the translated teachings provided over the internet using your tablet or mobile device in the temple. Laptops or notebook computers are not allowed in the temple. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a wireless internet connection for participants owing to technical limitations. If you are a translator who is joining the retreat in person, please let us know in advance so that we can reserve a space for you to translate during the teachings. Space is available for a maximum of about four translators in total, and live translation will not be performed in the temple itself. Instead, in-person translators will participate in the event over an internet connection provided at the retreat center so that their translation can be broadcast to the online audience. You need also to register yourself as an in-person participant.\n\nFood and On-Site Accomodations\n\nThe fee for the retreat includes three vegetarian meals and shared accommodations at the beautiful Dzokden Kalapa Retreat Center. Please inform us ([email protected]) in advance if you have allergies, food intolerances, or other important health or mental conditions that we need to consider. We are able to offer various male and female dormitory spaces from four to eight participants in each room. You can alternatively bring your own tent and camp near the Kalachakra Stupa (see registration options). As we wish to host as many students as possible and offer everyone the opportunity to meet Rinpoche in person, for this retreat it is not possible to reserve an individual room inside the retreat center. Parking in the area of Kalapa is very limited. If you are staying with us for the whole retreat, we encourage you to find a place in the town to park to help day travellers reach the site.\n\nOff-Site Accommodations\n\nIf you absolutely need an individual room, many options for accommodations are available near the retreat center’s area, in the Garanas region, and in the town Bad Schwanberg. In this case, please search for and book the necessary reservations yourself.\n\nVolunteer Opportunities\n\nRinpoche strongly encourages us to support our dharma brothers and sisters by volunteering. For this retreat, we need one or two volunteers to cook breakfast, lunch, and a light dinner for the participants. There is also an open position for a volunteer to help with technical aspects of setting up audio and video equipment, recording the event, and with Zoom transmissions. If you are considering this opportunity, please write as soon as possible to [email protected], so that we can arrange a video call to plan your participation. You can also volunteer for only a portion of the event rather than for the whole retreat; you can offer as much as possible according to your capability. Indeed, if you decide to be a full-time volunteer for the whole retreat (about. 8 hours volunteering each day), you can attend the empowerment and teachings without needing to register as a paying participant.\n\nSchedule\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nAEST – Melbourne, Australia\n\nSATURDAY 5th August\n\n3:30 AM – 5:00 AM – Public Teaching with RINPOCHE – Overcoming Fears and Limitations: The

Session\n\nOptional extras for practice\n\nTo enhance your practice, you can purchase some additional items as suitable. Our Dzokden store is run by volunteers, and all purchases directly support Rinpoche’s altruistic projects. Although you can take and receive the empowerment and participate in the retreat even without any of these items, they are recommended as traditional supports for Chöd practice.\n\nIf you are attending online, you can order Chöd supplies from the international Dzokden store based in the USA.\n\nIf you are attending in-person, you can order and reserve your implements online beforehand and pick it up upon arrival. (In this case, you need to order them before mid-June.)\n\nChöd Drum (2 sizes) Made by artisans in Nepal. Each ritual drum comes with a brocade case and tail. This high-quality drum is made of Sengdeng wood.\n\nKangling Thigh Bone Trumpet (made out of wood)Made by artisans in Kathmandu, Nepal. Naturally, obtaining a Kangling made of real bone is very difficult in these modern times. As an alternative, many people worldwide use trumpets made from wood. Comes with a case.\n\nVajra and Bell (Small or Large Size)Made with metal by artisans in Dehradun India. The color of the brocade case may vary from the one shown in the image.\n\nHOW THE ONLINE EMPOWERMENT WILL WORK\n\n1) Register for each attendee that will be receiving the empowerment. You will receive a confirmation email. All of our online events use the Dzokden learning center where you will find everything. If you do not already have an account, you will be invited to learn.dzokden.org.\n\n2) Before the empowerment, you will receive information on some simple supplies you should get to help make the experience as authentic as possible. However, don’t worry if you are not able to get them all. They are symbolic, and you can still receive the empowerment. Most importantly, you must understand what is happening. Just attending an empowerment does not mean you receive it. You must know what is going on. To ensure that everyone receives the empowerment, we will provide an instruction booklet as an eBook so you can follow along and know exactly what is happening. You are not allowed to share the booklet with anyone else or give others access to the empowerment. This document is private, and is for your personal use only. Rinpoche typically allows the eBook to be uploaded the night before the empowerment.\n\n3) You will receive access to the Zoom webinar for each of the sessions, and you will be able to watch any of the recorded sessions later on learn.dzokden.org. The empowerment and oral transmissions must be received in real time; no recordings will be available."
