        "text": "Water scarcity as a result of decreasing water availability and various other aspects related to insufficient/inadequate management practices represent a particular problem on Mediterranean islands. While the availability, demand and distribution of water on each island are determined by specific conditions, there are a number of attributes common to all Mediterranean islands. This calls for the formulation of generic solutions to the above mentioned problems. Such solutions are particularly pertinent in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD) and its implementation. Addressing water management on Mediterranean islands requires a holistic, interdisciplinary approach. However, endurable solutions will only be found through recommendations and/or regulations that are based on mutually agreed principles between the stakeholders involved. This requires a stakeholder-based participatory process that builds on the results of scientific investigations on the one hand and o...\n\nAccording to the United Nations (2020), since the 1980s, the global overall rate of water use has grown by 1% per year, and it is projected that, by 2050, humanity’s water footprint could exceed 30% of current levels. This situation is in stark contrast to the path toward the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 6, “clean water and sanitation”, which also influences Goal 14, “life below water”, and Goal 15, “life on land”. This is because the availability of water directly affects the food security and production capacity of each Country, and therefore its management is a crucial issue worthy of particular attention. Problems related to water security are particularly evident in the Mediterranean area, which is already facing high environmental challenges. It is an area severely affected by global warming; thus, it is one of the most vulnerable environments to climate change globally. It follows that the improper management of water resources could further worsen an alread...\n\nAbstract. Many countries in the Mediterranean region are located in the arid to semi arid regions of the world that are known to have limited water resources and suffer increasing water scarcity. Sustainable management of these resources will become increasingly complex in the future as climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of drought and water shortages. There is an increasing concern about the effective and efficient use of water for agriculture, and water conservation in general.\n\nThe Mediterranean region is undergoing rapid local and global social and environmental changes. All indicators point to an increase in environmental and water scarcity problems with negative implications towards current and future sustainability. Water management in Mediterranean countries is challenged these pressures and needs to evolve to reach the target of increasing population with reliable access to freshwater established by the Millennium Development Goals. This paper first reviews and evaluates current and future social and environmental pressures on water resources, including climate change. The results show that pressures are not homogeneous across the region and sectors of water use. Second the paper evaluates the adaptation strategies to cope with water scarcity, including technology, use of strategic groundwater, and management. Finally, the paper proposes a framework for managing the risk of water scarcity based on preparedness rather than a crisis approach. The importance of local management at the basin level is emphasized, but the potential benefits depend on the appropriate multi-institutional and multi-stakeholder coordination."
