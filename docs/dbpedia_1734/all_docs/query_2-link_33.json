I think that the physiologist Simon Bouisset is a major figure in the field of movement analysis, while Comolet was a famous biomechanical engineer in the fluid biomechanics field. When he died, this whole branch of biomechanics was almost orphaned. Finally, Joannes Dimnet represents an important figure in the field of osteoarticular biomechanics. What have been the main phases in the history of the LBM? The LBM was created in 1972, but it only really became a truly structured laboratory after 1979. In 1985, the team of scientists, formerly working in the University of Paris XII, invited us to participate in a DEA (postgraduate training programme) that they had set up in 1981. They suggested that we include a biomechanics specialty in this diploma. Our collaboration with the CNRS (Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique) (French National Scientific Research Center) started in 1996 and was formalized in 1998. One year later, LBM was granted COFRAC quality certification, which is somewhat an exceptional situation for a research laboratory. Very few laboratories have obtained this type of accreditation. I think only two CNRS laboratories have been granted this accreditation. Is it true that Raymond Roy Camille contacted you personally to propose a research collaboration? Yes, when he came to propose this work, he was head of the department of orthopaedics of Poissy hospital in the western suburbs of Paris. About one year later, he was appointed head of the department of orthopaedics at Pitié- Salpêtrière hospital. Thus, we became neighbours, geographically, but he had developed his approach at a time when we were not at all involved in this field. Our subsequent collaboration greatly facilitated all of our efforts. Our meeting with Jean Dubousset and the Sofamor company was a second important step in the history of the LBM. This happened in 1988, i.e. when Mrs Skalli joined our team. In fact, our collaboration with Sofamor was initiated by Guy Viart, who was Chief Executive Officer at the time. I think he asked us to present our biomechanical activities dedicated to the spine at Rang du Fliers, in the north of France. How did this collaboration with manufacturers start? I think this collaboration started as a the result of interventions by clinicians, who initially came to LBM for postgraduate training in biomechanics. When they subsequently questioned the various companies supplying them with their products and were unable to find a solution to their problems, they suggested that the manufacturers contact ENSAM. This circuit constituted a major step in the development of the LBM. When clinicians and manufacturers came to ENSAM to validate their mechanical ideas, we advanced from a highly intuitive field to a much more objective field. What was Guy Viart contribution to this development? He is obviously one of the leading figures who developed this link between the LBM and industry. In reality, this link is actually an association between surgeons, manufacturers and research laboratories. Would it be conceivable for other specialties to be involved in this association? This association is already spreading to other areas. We need the skills of a materials specialist to solve problems of wear, and a biocompatibility specialist, i.e. a chemist. We will also need a mechatronician (combination of Interview with Pr. Franç what is biomechanics? This third issue of Argos SpineNews includes the final part of the inter- view with François Lavaste. After defining the field of biomechanics and after briefly describing the history of the prestigious laboratory that he manages, François Lavaste hereafter explains why the LBM is situated at the crossroads of science, medicine and industry. Stereoradiography - a 3D medical imaging technique (Collaboration study: LBM ENSAM Paris - ETS, Ecole Polytechnique Montréal)\n\n4. mechanics, electronics and data processing) as we intend to progressively install systems inside the human body that could be controlled from outside the body (see article on nanotechnologies ARGOS SPINE NEWS No. 2). Consequently, we are no longer dealing with mechanics alone, but mechanics plus electronics, plus data processing and materials. Biomechanical engineers are obliged to complete their research teams with the contributions of other specialists. Would you say that this process constitutes an additional step in the evolution of biomechanics? Yes, these changes are clearly illustrated by the collaborations in the field of imaging. We obviously need to give a shape, a geometry to our mechanical objects and our models. Imaging was initially standardized, but now there is a growing trend towards personalization. In the longer term, imaging will also provide us with information about mechanical characteristics. This is why this type of collaboration is so important. The LBM stands at the crossroads between science and industry. I would even say that it is at the crossroads between science, industry and clinical practice. While visiting your website, we noticed that you place particular emphasis on the concept of a multidisciplinary approach. So how is your research organized within the LBM? In relation to the concept of a multidisciplinary approach, I would say that two basic disciplines are associated: orthopaedics and mechanics. Each of these disciplines then uses certain complementary skills. For example, imaging in the case of orthopaedics. Sometimes our work is conducted in collaboration with surgeons specialized in vascular systems. On the mechanical side, we need computer programmers and automaticians. Certain skills beyond the field of mechanics must be added. What are the current relations between the LBM and the world of surgery? I think we have two sorts of relations with the sphere of surgery. Firstly, we have relations in the field of training, as we have trained almost 150 surgeons since 1985, who now form a network throughout France, and thus we have a contact in almost every teaching hospital in France. For example, in the East of France, we collaborate with Professor J.P. Steib, and, in the South-West, with Professor J.M. Vital. I especially remember the first batch of graduates in 1985. Do many surgeons still want to pursue this training? Yes, there is a strong demand on the part of clinicians, but we can only accept ten surgeons per year. This is certainly not a great number each year, but it means that only the most motivated surgeons are able to join our team. This also explains the close bonds that have been established with various hospitals. Five or six members of the ARGOS association are surgeons who have completed this biomechanics training. You are also a member of ARGOS; in what way can the Association April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 9 communication What Biomechanics is ? ois Lavaste : PART Numerical model of the spine - Collaboration LBM - Sofamor Danek\n\n5. communication What Biomechanics is ? 10 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 contribute to the exchanges between biomechanical engineers and surgeons, and possibly manufacturers? It is always the same objective:to promote closer bonds between specialists from various disciplines. It is a forum in which each member can benefit from the other's experience without any further reason. This is important, as, in the early days of LBM, people predicted that our project would fail since we would never be able to collaborate with the medical profession, a closed and self-confident world. We were even warned that we would become servants to these “superior” masters. But the reality was very different, as the relationships that we established through formation of the DEA training programme allowed us to understand and respect each other. Has the LBM established joint projects with industry and especially with the automobile industry? Our collaborations with the automobile industry represent a knowledge transfer from orthopaedics to the automobile industry. We made every effort to demonstrate the advantages of modelling the human body as we had previously done for orthopaedics. It took 6 months of discussion to convince them, because they were not at all ready to accept this type of approach. At the time, they were essentially working with mechanical dummies, but we eventually convinced them to undertake an operation supported by the French Ministry of Research. This was in 1990, and the process then started to develop fairly rapidly. Car manufacturers were already interested in biomechanics using dummies, and tests with cadavers placed in vehicles. They simulated the shock and then examined the lesions caused to the bodies. We provided a representation of the human body with our digital models and simulations. Has this type of collaboration between the LBM and car manufacturers also been developed in other countries? I think that France was one of the leading cou ntries in this field. We were one of the first countries to possess a complete model of the human body designed to simulate the behaviour of the body in response to shocks. Things then moved very rapidly; five years later, in 1990, we already had the first elements of the virtual human body. In 1998, our modelling was operational and, at the same time, our approach was adopted by several other countries. Today, in 2000, most car manufacturers are interested in live models, but this wasn't the case at the outset. Why did you decide to develop this collaboration with the automobile industry when you could have confined your interests to the surgical field? The director of biomechanical research of two leading French car manufacturers (PSA, Renault) was a doctor. He had an idea very similar to our own concerning the value of biomechanics both in the field of orthopaedics and in the field of protection of the body in motor vehicles. This convergence of our two viewpoints and this easy relationship convinced us of the advantages of working together. We initiated a period of cooperation through a whole series of doctorate theses. Is it still just as difficult to collaborate with the automobile industry? No, it has now become routine. We work with car manufacturers in the context of European contracts. It has now become standard practice. Our work is conducted in collaboration with the INRETS (Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Sécurité - National Transport Security Research Institute). Our research and that of the automobile industry are closely related.

Do car manufacturers now systematically call on biomechanical engineers when studying a new project? Biomechanics has gradually become an integral part of the design of a motor vehicle, but this is obviously not the only element to be taken into account. This is an interesting development, as the engineers and scientists that we have trained now work in the research departments of leading car manufacturers, where they use models which were designed at the LBM in the frame of our research. We have progressed from a fairly abstract idea, considered to be somewhat bizarre, to a very concrete application: a technological transfer in the field of car design. Isn't this a form of «reward»? I recently received a call from one of my former doctorate students. I asked him what he was doing now, and he replied that he was in charge of setting up all of the infrastructure to allow application of the models designed at LBM for a leading French car manufacturer. This means that we were not unrealistic when we proposed this research programme ten years ago! Do other areas of industry make use of the services provided by biomechanics? There is another field of application with which I am much less familiar. It concerns military applications, both in the field of aeronautics and the army. They have very different objectives, as they want to determine the behaviours of the human body either to protect it or to destroy it. We have not had any experience in this field. It is a branch of biomechanics which publishes fewer papers and which is less present in the scientific community, but it is nevertheless a reality! April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 11 communication What Biomechanics is ?

Do you have any contacts with this branch of biomechanics? I know that it exists ... I have certain ideas about their research, but I do not have any direct contact with them. I think that they have their own specialized teams, and that they conduct a very particular type of research. Is it possible to develop a projectile that can travel throughout the body and destroy it? Is it possible to determine how the projectile reacts when it meets a resistant material such as bone? Can this same projectile be deviated to that it has a larger trajectory, etc. ? These are the types of problems that military scientists try to solve. It nevertheless remains a biomechanical approach. They have also designed models to investigate these questions. There have been attempts to collaborate in the context of the \"Fenit\" programme, which was set up by the French Ministry of Transport and Industry to improve problems of security, ergonomy and comfort related to road transport. We held a joint meeting with military scientists at which they have presented their research programmes. We have also evaluated the mechanical characteristics of the army's fixation device (a bone fracture stabilization system) but, in this particular case, the application concerned orthopaedics. Back on the subject of orthopaedics, what are the main contributions of the LBM to spinal surgery? I don't know whether we can claim to have contributed to the progress of spinal surgery, but I think we have provided certain objective elements to the assessment of biologic phenomena. We have developed simulations using digital models tested on anatomic specimens in order to obtain quantitative information. Once again, I don't think we can claim to have made an extraordinary contribution, but I think that we have facilitated a better understanding of biomechanical phenomena within the spine: its behaviour, function, reaction to implants (and everything concerning bone remodelling around implants), stabilization of the human body, and the correction of scoliosis. We have provided greater objectivity to the surgeon's subjective assessment. We are now working with clinicians in the surgical planning phases. They prepare the procedure on the basis of data of the clinical examination and radiographs, i.e. qualitative elements. The surgeon examines his patient and then uses his surgical experience. As an example, we can provide him, with a quantitative analysis of the rigidity of scoliotic curvatures by simulating the behaviour of the spine, which enables the surgeon to integrate additional information into planning of the surgical procedure. When we reconstruct the spine in three dimensions and obtain spatial geometric data, we try to understand how optimally to restore the vertebral column and reduce scoliotic curvatures. What are LBM's main projects? Essentially,we have two main types of projects. At the level of basic research, we are developing increasingly precise models, towards a virtual human body. Another actively growing field is our desire to assist in preoperative assessment, intraoperative practice, and postoperative evaluation. We are not trying to hold the surgeon's hand, but rather to provide him with information during the surgical procedure. Providing the surgeon with real-time information about the state of the curvature on which he is operating and on the degree of correction of this curvature constitutes a good example of objective assessment. Globally, a visual display will allow the surgeon to see the state of progress of the spine during treatment and, in parallel, it will also provide him with quantitative information about the curvature to be increased. This information will allow the surgeon to optimize the procedure without replacing the surgeon by a robot. Qualitative and quantitative data are combined to ensure an increasingly effective procedure. ■ Interview by C.S. Parent 12 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 communication What Biomechanics is ?

I wish to comment on your interview with Pr François Lavaste. You posed the question: What is biomechanics? I would offer the observation that Orthopaedic Surgery is a combination medical sciences surgical art and mechanical principle which when is applied in human, and thus is Biomechanics. In light of this, we should not forget the work of Nicolas Andry, a leader of eighteeneth century medicine who wrote his thesis in Orthopaedics in 1744.(editor’s note: how could he write his thesis in 1744, if he died in 1742?) He had observed gardeners supporting falling trees and applied this mechanical principle to the design of a brace for correcting kyphosis in children. This principle, as demonstrated in my letterhead, became the accepted symbol of orthopaedics. Nicolas Andry studied medicine at Rome and Paris and received the degree in medicine in 1697 at age 39. Four years later he was appointed as professor in the college de France and a member of the editorial board of the Journal des (editor’s note: what is this?) In 1724, he assumed the post of Dean of Faculty of Medicine. Andry actually coined the word “Orthopedie”. To quote: “As to the title, I have formed it of two Greek Words, viz, Orthos, which signifies straight (sic) or free from deformity, and pais, a child. Out of those two words I have created L’Orthopedie to describe my different method of preventing and correcting deformities in children.” His book contains fundamental information on curvature of spine, clubfeet, and congenital dislocation of the hip. Andry died in 1742, one year after the publication of L’Orthopedie. A brief glance at L’Orthopedie will remind us of the debt we as orthopaedic surgeons owe this great man. It is now time that we recognize him as the founder of biomechanics, too.\n\n9. ASN: What led you to the field of computer-assisted surgery? JT: I trained in computer science and joined the TIMC laboratory after a doctorate thesis in Grenoble in computer science or, more precisely, robotics in a laboratory with no activity in the biomedical field. In 1990, I decided to spend a year at TIMC to broaden my range of skills in robotics. I was immediately attracted by the clinical application of this field and, as such, I did not leave the laboratory at the end of the year. I was a research scientist from 1990 to 1996, when I was appointed director of the CAMSP group. ASN: When and why was the TIMC laboratory founded? The TIMC laboratory was founded in the early1980s within Joseph Fourier University, then called Université scientifique, technologique et médicale (scientific, technological and medical university) (Faculties of medicine and science). The Dean, Professor Sarrazin, wanted to create a research department composed of scientists, clinicians and biologists and to pursue medicalprogress by novel scientific approaches. In 1982, Jacques Demongeot, medical doctor and mathematician, created this department, which was initially called \"the Department of Biostatistics\". It was renamed TIMC (Techniques de l'Imagerie, de la Modélisation, et de la Cognition - Imaging, Modelling, and Cognition Techniques) but maintains the same multidisciplinary approach of close research collaboration, without placing the engineer at the service of the clinicians, or vice versa. ASN: What are the main activities of the TIMC? The common denominator of all of our research activities is the application of mathematics and computer science to medicine and biology. The TIMC is now composed of 8 teams, ranging from basic science to more applied research (modelling, image processing, artificial intelligence, microtransducers, genomic databases, physiology of breathing, CAMSP)and we have a very broad range of research topics. ASN: Who are your main clinical partners? Proximity facilitates our collaboration with about twenty departments of Grenoble teaching hospital, Professor Philippe MERLOZ, (in spinal surgery), Professor SARAGAGLIA (South Hospital, Department of Orthopaedics), and Professor Remi JULLIARD (Clinique Mutualiste of Grenoble), are a few of our closest colleagues. As you can see, our clinical partnerships are essentially local. ASN: Do the engineers working in the TIMC regularly visit surgical departments? It all depends on the type of research work. Relatively basic research, such as the design of a new robot, does not require regular presence in the clinical setting, at least in the early phases. In contrast, other projects require part- time or full-time presence of clinicians in the laboratory in order to define the needs and the environmental constraints, and the presence of engineers in the operating room for validation and clinical trials. ASN:How is the laboratory composed? The TIMC is composed of about 130 people: one-half are permanent, and half are post-doctorate fellows or doctorate students. The CAMSP team is composed of about 30 people and receives about fifteen students per year (DEA, engineering students, DESS or Master's students). ASN: You introduced the concept of CAMSP, which is broader than that of computer-assisted surgery. What are your activities beyond the medical and surgical procedure per se? April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 15 training TIMC Laboratory Mrs. Jocelyne Troccaz The director of the CAMSP group (computer-assisted medical and surgical procedures) in the TIMC laboratory (Techniques de l'Imagerie, de la Modélisation, et de la Cognition), kindly allowed us to visit her laboratory, near Grenoble teaching hospital. She gave us a guided tour of one of the leading centers in computer-assisted surgery research.\n\n10. training TIMC Laboratory 16 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 We have worked or are currently working in a number of non-surgical areas, such as medical imaging (image repositioning, data superimposition), in collaboration with radiologists; we are also currently working with radiologists to develop 3D reconstructions from intraoperative radiographs obtained by digital transducers. Radiotherapy is another research field (both for planning and conduct of treatment). We are also working in the field of respiratory medicine in the form of computer- assisted bronchoscopy . These are just a few of our ongoing projects. ASN: What are the main international CAMSP research laboratories? It is hard to give a complete list. The largest laboratory was formed relatively recently at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, USA) by Professor Russell TAYLOR. Professor TAYLOR has a deep robotics background (he designed the Robodoc system) and after working with IBM for many years, he coagulated a research team around the theme of CAMSP with the usual 3 axes (research, training, and industrial partnerships), with the financial support of the US government. In the United States, the research centers in Boston, around MIT and Harvard University, and in Pittsburgh at UPMC Shadyside (See. ARGOS NEW SPINE No. 2) also play a leading predominant role. We often work with the Helmöltz Institute team in Aachen, Germany; Paolo DARIO's team is particularly interested in microtechnologies and robotics. In Switzerland, Professor Lutz NOLTE at the Müller Institute has specialized in computer-assisted orthopaedics. A number of teams have been set up in England, for example the London team directed by Prof. Brian DAVIES and Prof. David HAWKES. In France, centres such as INRIA, are more specifically devoted to medical imaging and various image processing techniques. The TIMC is, in terms of the number of projects developed and the quality and close proximity of its clinical partners, clearly one of the main CAMSP laboratories in the world. ASN: Who are the key people who have nurtured these relatively young disciplines over the last ten years? Without hesitation, Russell TAYLOR in the United States, whose work on the Robodoc system is largely responsible for the media coverage of these technologies. In France, Philippe CINQUIN was responsible for the development of surgical navigation technologies in the Grenoble region in the eighties, but it must be remembered that this work would not have seen the light of day without the assistance of the clinicians with whom we work. In spinal surgery, for example, a real long-term partnership has been developed with Professor MERLOZ. ASN: What proportion of your research activity is devoted to orthopaedic surgery? I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that almost 50% of our clinical activity concerns the field of orthopaedics. We have many projects concerning navigation in surgery of the spine, pelvis, and knee (total arthroplasty, ligamentoplasty), and concerning medical imaging. Half of our clinical partnerships and the various ongoing European projects concern orthopaedic surgery. ASN: How are clinicians integrated into your research projects? This integration is primarily \"structural\", as the laboratory is partially composed of medical doctors. Secondly, several doctors and surgeons complete their doctorate-of-science theses at the TIMC, on a part-time basis, simultaneously with their everyday clinical practice. Once again, our proximity to the Grenoble teaching Peroperative 3D surface reconstruction of the lumbosacral spine using an ultrasound (echogaphy) system. Percutaneaous screwing of the sacroiliac joint. Semi-active serial robot. The robot is not moving the pen, but the human hand is guided by the robot on a pre-program track. Some areas can be allowed, some others forbidden.\n\n11. April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 17 training TIM-C Laboratory hospital is a major advantage in this context. These clinicians generally work in teams with an engineer, who is also preparing a doctorate-of-science thesis. The contribution of doctors usually concerns defining needs and constraints, modalities of experimentation, and clinical validation. They are obviously a central component of the industrial partnership. ASN: In your opinion, what are the major contributions of CAMSP to spinal surgery at the present time? At present, our work centers on navigation techniques for pedicle fixation , but these contributions are diversifying even as we speak. ASN: For example? Enhanced endoscopic surgery is probably one of the main objectives of CAMSP over the next decade. The combination of navigation and endoscopy technologies will soon allow the development of new minimally invasive techniques for spinal surgery. With the progress in intraoperative imaging, techniques will evolve and new surgical approaches will be possible. The integration of new transducers into surgical instrumentation could also be a factor in technical improvement. ASN: Computer- assisted pedicle fixation currently appears to hesitate between tomographic navigation (CT scan) and fluoronavigation. Where is this technology going? The choice of one or other of these two modalities will undoubtedly depend on the clinical setting. The high radiation dosage incumbent in CT would prevent it from being used systematically, especially in adolescent scoliosis. MRI may represent an alternative in this setting. The efficacy of fluoronavigation has yet to be demonstrated. Fluoronavigation is very promising since it does not require a sophisticated preoperative examination and uses less radiation, but, for the moment, it can only provide medium quality 2D images, which are markedly inadequate in severe spinal deformities. In any case, these techniques will certainly be improved over the next few years. We are also working on techniques of intraoperative repositioning of 3D CT reconstructions of the spine by ultrasound, which will open new perspectives in minimally invasive surgery. ASN: In your opinion, what is the future of robotics in spinal surgery? Like all aspects of spinal surgery, this is a difficult question! The presence of sensitive anatomic structures, such as nerve roots and the dura, makes the use of robots particularly hazardous, requiring extremely careful and detailed risk assessment and, quite probably, the design of new robotic approaches. Unlike the classical robotic approaches to orthopaedic surgery (Robodoc - ISS, Caspar - Orthomaquet), our robotic approach is not independent (the robot automatically performs part of the procedure), but dependent (the procedure is performed entirely by the surgeon, but limited in space by the robot during the most delicate phases, as if a \"third hand\" guided the surgeon's hand to ensure that the procedure follows the preoperative plan). Miniaturization of robotic components, especially operating devices and transducers, will allow the clinical diffusion of these robots in the near future. ASN: As the new millennium begins, we are watching an Internet explosion. What is the role of the Internet in the development of CAMSP? The Internet will undoubtedly have a dominant influence on training and teleteaching. In my opinion, remote- controlled surgery (or telesurgery) via Internet at sites geographically distant from each other, will be confined to the field of isolated demonstration for many years to come. On the other hand, sharing of scientific data and know-how between centers specialized in a particular medical or Image Guided Orthopaedic Surgery (Fluoronavigation) Images guided pedicular screwing\n\n12. surgical discipline is rapidly changing the face of current teaching methods in medicine and surgery, but we must remember to pay particular attention to the source and reliability of these data! ASN: Do you have any teleteaching project underway? The VOEU project (Virtual Orthopaedic European University) is an European project following two other projects: IGOS (Image Guided Orthopaedic Surgery) and IGOS 2. These two projects were designed to ensure the development and clinical validation of CAMSP systems in orthopaedic surgery. The VOEU project is designed to develop computer technologies in the area of orthopaedic surgery teaching. Several trials of access to training through Internet have been organized, especially in the field of pharmacology at the Grenoble Faculty of Medicine. These courses are interactive and not exclusively comprised of text. For example, various multimedia questionnaires allow self-assessment of candidates. In the context of the VOEU project, models of orthopaedic surgery training courses and simulation tools (clinical models or surgery simulators) are being developed, in the fields of knee, hip, and pelvis surgery, and shoulder arthroscopy. ASN: What are your objectives for the next ten years? In the field of orthopaedic surgery, particular emphasis will be placed on the development of tools facilitating minimally invasive surgical procedures. Endoscopy, repositioning techniques without palpation, such as ultrasound, or 3D interpretation of digital subtraction x-rays (ongoing European MI3 Project) are several examples. We can also expect progress in image processing tools and the development of new visualization systems which will facilitate the clinical use of surgical navigation systems. Modelling of clinical data and anatomic information, especially concerning soft tissues, is a rapidly growing field of research at TIMC (mainly in cardiac and gastrointestinal surgery). Collaborations between our discipline and biomechanics will be one of the main factors leading to innovation over the years to come. The spine, for example, has been the subject of many biomechanical studies performed by laboratories such as LBM-ENSAM, directed by Professor François LAVASTE and Wafa SKALLI (See ARGOS SPINENEWS No. 2), especially concerning geometric and mechanical modelling of the healthy, injured and reconstructed spine, but also associated implants and surgical techniques. These laboratories are also increasingly developing their research in the fields of medical imaging, which is also one of our areas of interest. Biomechanics and computer-assisted surgery are complementary dsciplines, which must collaborate more in the near future to enhance the development of a global therapeutic continuum, from personalized modelling to the surgical procedure and beyond to long-term follow-up of the clinical results. ASN: PRAXIM company, the subject of another interview in this issue, is one of your most important partners. Can you tell us more about this partnership? PRAXIM previously ensured the link between research and industrialization (in the context of our partnerships with major companies such as Medtronic, Sofamor, Danek, or Aesculap). This engineering activity has gradually been replaced by an autonomous activity and direct industrialization. The industrial application of TIMC's research is essentially ensured by PRAXIM, which now produces its own navigation station (Surgetics). ■ Interview by A.

ASN: Can you explain to us what led you to the field of computer- assisted surgery? SL: During my training as an engineer at Sup'Télécom in Brest, I became interested in the biomedical field and I worked for companies in this field while I was a student. I started a thesis in Grenoble in the TIMC laboratory in 1986, with Philippe CINQUIN, who was in the process of creating his CAMSP team (computer-assisted medical and surgical procedures). My thesis subject concerned computer- assisted percutaneous nucleolysis based on CT images, and it seems to me that this problem has still not been entirely solved. ASN: When and why was the PRAXIM company created? PRAXIM was founded in 1995 when a group of scientists, including myself, initially directed by Philippe CINQUIN and later by Jocelyne TROCCAZ, decided to develop a structure that would facilitate the laboratory research by association with leading medical companies such as B-Braun (Aesculap), Medtronic, Sofamor, Danek, or Stryker. ASN: What are your fields of interest apart from orthopaedic surgery? We are currently bringing products to market in three fields. The first is orthopaedic surgery in general, the second is ENT (See Figure), intranasal and cranial surgery, and the third is dental and maxillofacial surgery, with a specialization concerning computer- assisted dental implantology. ASN: What percentage of your work is devoted to orthopaedic surgery? Orthopaedic surgery has a predominant place in PRAXIM, in line with current market trends. We believe thatwe have an authentic explosion in computer- assisted surgery in orthopaedics at the present time, and we are participating in this explosion, in both development and marketing. The first PRAXIM developments were applications in knee (See figure) surgery and spinal surgery. ASN: Can you briefly describe the international computer- assisted orthopaedic surgery market? There are approximately 1,500 computer-assisted surgery systems throughout the world at the present time, but only several hundred are devoted to orthopaedics and traumatology. This is a very rapidly emerging market as a result of several factors. The first one concerns the growing demand expressed by patients and identification of the real potential applications of these technologies to solve various problems in orthopaedics. The locomotor apparatus is particularly suitable to computer-assisted surgery, which essentially concerns integration of 3D geometry, modelling, and registration. The second factor concerns the orthopaedic implant manufacturers, who consider these systems an innovative and often clever way of presenting and promoting their know- how, and of providing their customers with a real added value. The third factor concerns the demand by orthopaedic surgeons, who view these systems as a natural step in the evolution of technological and scientific progress that makes their surgical practice more reliable, increasingly effective, and less invasive. As a result of all of these factors, several hundreds of these systems should be in use in every industrialized country in the near future. April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 19 communication PRAXIM Interview with Mr Stéphane Lavallée Chief Executive Officer of PRAXIM (Perception, Raisonnement, Action en Médecine - Perception, Reasoning, Action in Medicine), is one of the worl- d's leaders in computer-assisted surgery. He presents his approach to this rapidly growing market and these new technologies. Surgetics screen of the ENT navigation software Total Knee replacement planning (Femoral implant).\n\n14. communication PRAXIM 20 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 ASN: You are marketing an open navigation station (SURGETICS) (See figures). What are the main advantages of this open device? Two computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery systems are available at the present time: the so-called \"closed\" systems, reserved for a specific implant manufacturer, and the \"open\" systems, such as our Surgetics device. Open devices satisfy the surgeon's demand to be able to work on multiple applications with implants from various manufacturers, who are often competitors. The interest of an open system is to allow the surgeon to perform knee arthroplasty with manufacturer X, spinal surgery with manufacturer Y, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with manufacturer Z, and perform hip or shoulder arthroplasty with another manufacturer, etc. ASN: What applications will be available on SURGETICS within the next two years? We are going to start with the main applications in orthopaedic surgery, which obviously include the spine, with a number of different variants.This also includes knee arthroplasty, either total or unicompartimental; knee ligamentoplasty; lower limb osteotomies, total hip arthroplasty and traumatology, and especially femoral pinning. Applications such as the shoulder or ankle arthroplasty will be developed subsequently. ASN: You are a partner of SURGIVIEW, specialized in the development of computer- assisted diagnosis and clinical follow-up systems in orthopaedic surgery. What is the purpose of this partnership? Navigation, which is at the core of the operating room, is able to take various types of data into account, and provide very precise quantitative data derived from a computerized surgical protocol like those developed by Surgiview. If we stopped at this point, we would lose an important potential benefit of these systems, which integrate these data into the management of the operating room and in the surgeon's everyday practice, thus providing patients with an ever- increasing quality of care. Our partnership with SURGIVIEW is an essential and strategic partnership. ASN: Computer-assisted pedicle fixation appears to hesitate between classical navigation (CT scan) and fluoronavigation. What is your position? The use of preoperative 3D imaging remains essential in cases with severe spinal deformities. In other more common and less complicated cases, fluoronavigation can be sufficient. In addition to these two techniques, both part of our portfolio, we propose an intermediate solution, based on intraoperative image acquisition using fluoroscopy, with 3D geometric reconstruction using an \"atlas\" type of statistical model (See Figure). This approach is designed to combine the simplicity of fluoroscopy with the three dimensional reconstruction available with computerized. ASN: In your opinion, what are the major innovations likely to be developed over the next five years in spinal surgery? I think two main innovative aspects will be combined. The first aspect, about which everyone is talking, is minimally invasive surgery, which is difficult to implement with currently available technologies. It will become easier and even simple with the future SURGETICS technology. The second aspect is global visualization of the spine during surgery, combined with preoperative planning designed to ensure an optimal procedure according to the patient's preoperative morphological and functional configuration. ASN: In your opinion, what are the main obstacles to the development of robotics in orthopaedic surgery? I believe that, up to now, we have always put \"the cart before the horse\". I come from a robotics background, in which I developed an active system devoted to stereotactic neurosurgery. I have subsequently changed my mind, as the so-called \"passive\" navigation systems offer a number of functional options - an SURGETICS Station\n\n15. added value whose limits cannot even be suspected at the present time - and solve multiple problems. Robotics, initially used as a response to these problems, now appears to be an error; an error which is even harder to justify in view of the high cost of these systems, which are technically difficult to develop. I think that, in the long term, robotics will be an \"instrumental ancillary\", in which navigation will constitute the first level of ancillary, although some of its phases could possibly be robotized, to ensure greater precision and increased security. Moreover, robots are not purely \"active\", such as Robodoc and Caspar robots, but can also be semi-active, in this case, the robot, often much more compact, simply guides the surgeon's movements, and protects certain high-risk zones. ASN: A knee surgeon does not have the same concerns as a spinal surgeon. You are developing applications for orthodontists, ENT surgeons, etc. How do you deal with these multidisciplinary requirements? We are in contact with a wide range of surgical specialties and we adopt a pragmatic approach to this diversity. We strive to find solutions to very concrete and very specific problems in co- operation with clinicians. Our partnerships with surgeons at the forefront of their field, and with manufacturers of implants, allow us to acquire all of the knowledge necessary to develop our systems. An all-purpose SURGETICS machine obviously does not exist. We have developed a software and equipment platform responding to all of the generic needs of surgery, but the development of each application is essential and differs each time, just as the problems to be addressed also differ. ASN: Who are your scientific and clinical partners? Our main scientific partner is the TIMC laboratory, situated a few metres from our premises, with its CAMSP department directed by Jocelyne TROCCAZ. We have exclusive rights to about ten of this laboratory's patents, in our fields of activity. We have an increasing number of clinical partners. For the moment, they essentially operate in the Grenoble region and mainly consist, in the field of orthopaedics, of Professor MERLOZ's team at Grenoble teaching hospital for the spine, and Professor JULIARD's team at the Clinique Mutualiste in Grenoble. ASN: What are PRAXIM's objectives for the next five years? Our objectives are to meet the growing market demand by positioning ourselves as one of the leaders in orthopaedic, ENT, and maxillofacial surgery. We then hope to establish our presence in other markets as a result of technological derivation. ASN: And your objectives for this year? Our short-term objectives are to launch our first products. 2001 is the year of SURGETICS, particularly in the fields of intranasal, dental and orthopaedic surgery. Several applications for the knee, in collaboration with various industrial partners, will immediately provide users with an open solution. We will also launch a first product for spinal surgery this year. ■ Interview by A.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION ! WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT YEAR… Photos taken from the 5TH International Argos symposium\n\n17. communication Fifth International Argos Symposium 24 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 SESSION One, \"A Virtual Trip on the Spine Planet,\" was devoted to imagery. Mr. Leonard Fass (General Electric) provided an overview of innovations and future prospects in spinal imaging, emphasizing that MRI, CT scans, and standard X-rays are used in a complementary way. MRI and CT scan present certain advantages, such as high contrast, direct axial imaging, surgical operation control, multi-slice reconstruction, and virtual endoscopy of the spine. While CT scan offers images of the bone and calcium, MRI is suited to visualize bone marrow and spinal nerves. For the time being, ligaments and scar cannot be visualized with these two techniques. For nerve imaging, it is still necessary to use intravenous contrast agents, which make these techniques semi-invasive. Volume rendering shows arteries and blood vessels in relation to the spine. Mr. Fass mentioned that improvements must be made to eliminate artifacts in ultra-high (100 micron) resolution. In the future, the trend will be from closed MRI systems, which offer better image quality, to open systems, which are more dynamic. Professor Jacques De Guise of the Imaging & Orthopedics Research Laboratory in Montreal spoke on \"3D Imagery: Realism vs. Accuracy.\" He reviewed various imagery techniques for orthopedic surgery, outlining their advantages, disadvantages, and potential difficulties. Traditional CT scan produces multi-slice images, but new technology has led to spiral images and voxels (3D data sets). The speaker discussed the four possibilities using CT. The first is the classical axial acquisition (re-slicing), which provides 2D images; it presents the advantage of being quick and simple to use. One disadvantage is that it requires data interpolation. Second is MIP (maximum intensity projection). This technique is most appropriate for vascular pathologies; it is also quick, simple, and gives 2D images. Artifact is the main problem with this technique. The third method described by Professor De Guise is surface rendering, which offers 2D-3D contour detection, polygonal models, and computer graphics. Surface rendering provides visualization in real time and is simple and quick. However, it requires an enormous amount of data and reproduces only the surface of objects. The source of incongruities may be hard to determine. Although the images it produces are quite impressive, this technique requires the presence of an expert, is long and fastidious, and involves a complex method of automatization. Volume rendering, the fourth possibility, involves projecting the 3D data set onto the imaging plane and offers the advantage of being a virtual X-ray, allowing anatomic cuts for teaching anatomy. However, it requires a huge amount of data; it is operator- dependent; it produces artifacts; and it is computer-intensive. There is no direct Fifth International Argos Symposium: A Spine Odyssey January 26th, 2001 - Maison des Arts & Métiers - Paris As the crowning event in a week dedicated to the spine, the Fifth Argos Symposium focused on the use of technological innovations in spinal surgery.

The speaker explained that biplanar radiography could replace CT scans. It is very precise and uses low-dose radiography. This technique, however, is only a surface rendering technique and requires the assistance of an expert as well as a priori information. In conclusion, Professor De Guise stressed that these are virtual images, which may very well differ from reality. One may rightly ask, \"What is real and what is virtual?\" There have been relatively few studies on the precision of these techniques and their clinical relevance (M.W. Vannier et al, Iowa). The speaker concluded that there are many 3D methods and no perfect technique; the choice depends on the context. For optimum precision, one needs a large data set, time, and the assistance of an expert. After a wealth of information from an engineering perspective, the next presentations were given by clinicians. Professor Jean-Claude Dosch outlined the latest innovations and contributions to diagnosis and new therapeutic perspectives. In the field of digital radiography, he reviewed conventional X-ray techniques: CT, MRI, PET (Positron Emission Tomography). Prof. Dosch discussed clinical applications of the above-mentioned techniques. They are used for spinal trauma using 3D and 2D images. Multitissue imaging has few applications currently. He stressed that the clinical application of 3D images essentially concerns the detection of intervertebral dislocation and unilateral luxation. He then reviewed clinical examples using MRI imaging in degenerative pathologies: myelo-MRI, dynamic MRI, and in post-operative diagnosis of infections. In his conclusion, Prof. Dosch emphasized how valuable imaging techniques are for diagnosis and therapeutics; one may ask whether France is lagging behind in the acquisition of the necessary equipment. These techniques are not 100% reliable and surgeons should not forget conventional techniques (X-rays). In the future, and to reduce artifacts, techniques can be combined. The panel emphasized the complementary nature of the various techniques. Clearly, one cannot sacrifice precision for the sake of image quality, regardless of how beautiful the pictures may be. Session Two focused on \"The State of the Art in Robotics and Spine Surgery.\" The first speaker, Dr. François Laborde, is a cardiac surgeon who heads an experimental surgery laboratory in which robots are used. The goal of robotics in surgery is to improve the surgeon's autonomy and offer advantages for patients; the speaker expressed the need for more progress toward reaching these goals. Dr. Laborde reviewed the three types of robotic systems currently available (Intuitive, Zeus, Caspar). The advantages of mini-invasive surgery using robotics for the patient include: smaller incision, less pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, greater patient comfort, etc. For the surgeon, advantages are primarily improved ergonomics, greater control, savings in costs and time, etc. The main advantage in using robots is automatic response, image-guided positioning, and the target-tracking system, in addition to the high level of precision. Using robots requires past experience with video surgery plus dry and wet lab training. Dr. Laborde warned that the learning curve must definitely be taken into account when a surgeon is considering the use of robotics. The speaker also addressed the ethical/philosophical considerations related to this kind of surgery. In the next speech, \"Is There a Robot in the Operating Room?\" Dr. Adrian Lobontiu presented an intuitive robot made by Intuitive Surgical (Mountain April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 25 communication Fifth International Argos Symposium Pr.

This beautiful private parisian man- sion seems to adapt perfectly to the meeting spi- rit. Indeed, it favours conviviality, exchange of views and dialogue. The symposium will last from Thursday afternoon to Friday Morning. Friday afternoon will be devoted to free com- munications. To give the good indication of a lumbar or lumbo-sacral fusion is the guarantee of a good functionnal and clinical result. This is the key point of the treatment. Several schools, even philosophies are opposite in this field. However, it is certainly possible to access to a rather common attitude. That’s why we wish to have the opinion of few of you to help us to define easily what can be considered as the “good indication”. The second point that highly contributs to the quality of the result is the surgery’s strategy. Which levels are to be fixed? What kind of fusion to do? These are important factors, which will influence the results. The topic is wide, source of many questions and examina- tions. This year, we only wish to discuss the indications and the surgery’s strategy in the treatment of lumbar stenosis associated to an adult scoliosis or/and or to an arthritic spondy- lolisthesis, as well as in isthmic lysis and grade one spondylolisthesis. The years 2003 and 2004 will allow us to study the other indications of fusion as regards of the common or post-discec- tomy low back pain, the disc herniation the multi operated spine and high grade spondylo- listhesis. We hope to have the pleasure to meet you during these next meetings. ■ Lumbar a which ind In lumbar in isthmic Dr Philippe BEDAT Dr Jean-Paul FORTHOMME Dr Frank GOSSET Dr Alain GRAFTIAUX Pr Pierre KEHR Dr Christian MAZEL Pr Jean-Paul STEIB Dr/Ing Alexandre TEMPLIER Dr Richard TERRACHER Scientific committee :\n\n20. www.argos-europe.com y 31 and February 1st 2002 Arts et Métiers - 9bis avenue d’Iéna PARIS XVI FRANCE International s symposium and lumbo-sacral fusions : dications, which strategies ? stenosis associated to spinal deformities, c lysis and grade one spondylolisthesis.\n\n21. communication Fifth International Argos Symposium 28 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 View, California). He showed two short films to demonstrate the range of surgical possibilities using the da Vinci robotics system in cardiovascular surgery (coronary bypass) and laparoscopic surgery (hernia repair, nissen procedure, adrenalectomy, etc.). After the presentation, Dr. Christian Mazel showed a film of himself performing open surgery on the dura mater of a lamb with a robot. Although he said the experience was interesting, this approach requires substantial training before it may be useful for the surgeon; otherwise robotics is too complex to use and highly time- consuming, and therefore of questionable benefit for the patient. Session Three, \"Navigation in the Pedicle,\" focused on surgery using computer navigation systems. The first speaker, Mr. Harry Freitag, presented the \"AESCULAP SPOCS\" 3D navigation system. This Surgical Planning and Orientation Computer System, developed in Germany has applications in neuro and spine surgery and ENT. It has dedicated functions for virtual screw position planning and surgical guidance for screw implantation and provides real-time tracking of instruments. Prof. Pierre Kehr, the next speaker, described his experience with the SPOCS system. He was initially enthusiastic but found it very time- consuming in practice. He showed a video of his team using the device during a real operation, which he commented upon for the audience. First, patient CT data are transferred to the SPOC device, one vertebra at a time. Next, the surgeon must place six landmarks per vertebra (superior and inferior articular apophyses and two for the spinal processes). The surgeon then places the virtual pedicular screws, calculating the entry/exit points, target, angle, etc. The synchronization phase consists of matching reality to the virtual data that were fed into the system. Dr. Kehr reported that he had to start each step over more than once to ensure proper virtual placement of the screws before actual surgery. Once the preparatory phase was complete, the device enabled easy navigation. The speaker stressed the learning curve, once again. In addition, the system is not intuitive and requires mastery of the software. Professor Philippe Merloz spoke about fluoronavigation. The C-arm is a commonly-used tool, but alone it does not provide axial images and is often responsible for errors in spine surgery. Fluoronavigation uses the C-arm and image-guided instruments, and calibration target with embedded LEDs, as well as a computer. Prof. Merloz described pedicular screw placement using a fluoroscope, consisting of C-arm set-up reference frame fixation; camera alignment; and instrument calibration. The speaker outlined the advantages of fluoronavigation, which is a more intuitive method: it does not require pre-operative CT, and there is no need to make a model or establish landmarks. However, it requires manual data acquisition. Discussion of CT-based navigation and fluoronavigation emphasized that for greater efficiency, technicians should be in charge of support and preparatory steps and pre-operative scanning should be standardized. The panel once again stressed that the two techniques are complementary and not antagonistic. In the future, the combination of CT and ultrasound will probably revolutionize the field of imaging. The afternoon session was devoted to Internet and the medical practice. It opened with Dr. Franck Schwab presentation, \"The Internet Experience of a Surgeon\" which he summed up vividly: \"Developing a website is like fishing: it may sound easy, but it can be a real challenge.\" Internet is increasingly affecting all the realms of our daily lives, health care included. Today, 44% of Americans use internet and 36% refer to it for medical information. For a surgeon, what are the benefits of creating a website? What kind of resources are needed? What are the options? What can we offer to patients? Such were the questions addressed by Dr. Schwab (www.orthospine.com). The benefits are numerous, since a website enables individual physicians or groups of physicians to provide specialized information to the patients who would otherwise consult other sources of information — industrial or commercial. The site can also provide practical information on hospital location, hours, answer FAQs (frequently asked questions), offer extended patient contact, etc. Dr. Alexandre Templier then Pr.

The Argos website features the three main focuses of Argos: communication, training, and evaluation. The site lists the association's offices, commissions, organization chart, and contacts and provides information about Argos- sponsored events. The training section offers a list of training centers which host surgeons from the world over, and a list of Argos partners. The next speaker, Professor Christopher Ullrich, addressed the issue of information technology and methods for storing, retrieving, and distributing medical images. He outlined the advantages and drawbacks of five methods. With film-based image dispatching and interpretation, images are easily disorganized and lost, and it is difficult to dispatch them efficiently. Video require a great deal of storage space and is processed using toxic chemicals that contaminate the environment. Electronic image dispatching and interpretation is fast, dependable, and flexible. Images remain organized. This high resolution medium can be used with sophisticated software. However, display equipment is expensive and this method generates high infrastructure costs. Other drawbacks include the fact that this method requires skilled technicians; equipment quickly becomes obsolete; and sophisticated computer tools can be intimidating and counter-intuitive. PACS is the buzzword that describes the third approach. Prof. Ullrich explained that PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications Systems) are intended to be used by a radiology department, not an entire hospital, much less the whole world. PACS offer easy distribution and data exchange with other hospital departments. However, this system usually requires proprietary software on each display computer that accesses the system. Moreover, systems may quickly grow obsolete and require large bandwidths to handle ever- growing data sets. The fourth approach relies on Internet- related developments. Universal web browsers allow user-specific applications; all upgrades come from a central server; and multiple users can access the system simultaneously. Due to concern about data security, privacy and security standards are already in place (firewalls, SSL, VPN, etc.). Application service providers are the fifth and final option. With this system, a «vendor» owns the computer and a facility/hospital enters into a contract to use it. The facility will use a given vendor as long as the service provided is satisfactory ; otherwise it can switch around until it finds a satisfactory vendor. The downside is a certain degree of loss of local control by the hospital or facility. In his presentation entitled, \"To evaluate in order to communicate,\" Dr. Alexandre Templier addressed basic issues such as: Evaluation is a continuous and collective approach; but what is its purpose? One evaluates for the future, but what is the future of orthopædic surgery? Evaluation, as a continuous and collective process, is an essential part of the surgeon's responsibility as a decision-maker. Dr. Templier underscored the importance of the continuity of assessment throughout the entire clinical process. As the patient goes through all the clinical steps, from his first visit to the doctor to the operating room, the physician is constantly analyzing and evaluating: from the pre-operative stages to surgery, (consulting room, diagnosis, tests, X- rays, etc.) to post-operative evaluation. Depending on the result of surgery, the surgeon must analyze the reasons for success or failure. Post-operative follow- up is thus a crucial stage of the process, but surgeons still lack adequate assessment tools. Secondly, Dr. Templier underscored the collective aspect of evaluation, allowing surgeons to become familiar with each other's standards; this means improving communication between surgeons. To this end, prospective multicentric studies can be very useful. The future of evaluation, according to Dr. Templier, may lie in navigation, if image-guided surgery is implemented by pre-operative measuring and quantifying techniques. Now the question is, will these new techniques really benefit the profession, or are they a passing fad? The future will tell; nevertheless, one clear point is that today's evaluation tools must be clinically relevant, reliable, non- invasive, and easy to use, with reproducible results. Of course, these technological advances will never replace surgeon's experience and scientific expertise, but their potential should not be underestimated. Ms. Isabelle Lucas Baloup, a lawyer licensed to practice with the Paris court, delivered a speech on \"Internet in medical and surgical practice in France\" from a legal viewpoint. She began by asking, \"Is the law the worst enemy of surgical progress?\" The Internet is international, but each country has its own laws. A physician's use of the Internet in France is governed by French civil and penal law, and the medical profession's code of ethics. French law will apply if the information on Internet is available in France. ■ 30 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 communication Fifth International Argos Symposium Dr. Alexandre Templier, PhD Maître Isabelle Lucas Baloup\n\n24. ASN:Professor Gracovetsky, can you describe the path that has led you to devote your career to the study of the spine? SG: I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne in 1968, with a degree in nuclear physics and I also obtained a Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia in 1971. My meeting with Harry Farfan in 1974 gave me the opportunity to work in the biomedical field. At that time, Harry was at the heart of a renewed effort involving a number of research scientists, such as Alf Nachemson, which culminated in the foundation, in Montréal, of the International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine which is now the undisputed leader in this field. The atmosphere was electric and I was carried away by this \"brainstorm\". I then spent about ten years trying to understand the characteristics of a \"normal\" spine, by means of mathematical simulations and analyses in the pathology laboratory. The many contradictions between experimental data and the theories of the time gradually led me to reject many widely held beliefs and, in 1983, led to the formulation of a hypothesis combining the essential aspects of the work of many authors into a coherent theory able to explain the structural and functional development of the locomotor apparatus. This was called the \"Spinal Engine\" theory, which was the subject of numerous criticisms, but has never really been replaced. It therefore appears to partially correspond to reality. This theory led me to develop instruments to measure clinical spine function. One of these instruments, called a \"Spinoscope\", led to the creation of a company that operated for a number of years. ASN:Can you describe your work environment before your recent retirement? SG: I was working in a company called \"Spinex\", which comprised a very large research department, exclusively designed to develop commercial applications of our research. Work started at the Concordia University in Montréal (Faculty of engineering and computer sciences), where I was a faculty member for 27 years. Today, I am more specifically interested in the medical decision process, i.e. to understand the elements which lead doctors to arrive at a diagnosis for the cause of our eternal nemesis, low back pain. Since 1992, my main areas of interest have been expert systems and structuring of knowledge in order to more clearly understand why a clinician adopts one treatment strategy rather than another. I have tried to integrate spinal function as measured by various instruments, with more conventional methods such as radiology, pain assessment and clinical observations in April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 33 evaluation The Spine Engine Interview with Professor S. Gracovetsky Professor Serge Gracovetsky kindly granted us this interview while he was in Amsterdam for a university seminar on the biomechanics of the locomo- tor apparatus. “The Spine Engine: A unified theory of the Spine?” “If the leg cannot rotate the pelvis, then what rotates the pelvis ?? It has to be the spine. But how ??” Human Gait What we want What we have\n\n25. evaluation The Spine Engine 34 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 order to establish a multidisciplinary approach. ASN:You mentioned Professors Farfan and Nachemson with whom you worked. In what context did you conduct these collaborations? SG: My collaboration with Harry Farfan involved 7 to 8 hours a week and lasted approximately from 1974 to 1985. We conducted a large number of studies and published many papers together. Harry had exceptional intuition and vision, extending well beyond conventional medicine. He believed that spinal problems were due to excess mechanical torsion. Nachemson, an impulsive and brilliant man, saw most spinal problems in terms of disk compression. When Farfan and Nachemson were on the same podium at any congress organized anywhere on the planet, you could be sure of a fierce, and well-reasoned, battle of wits. My own work was greatly influenced by the jousting between these two exceptional personalities. The spinal engine theory actually represents a compromise between these two extreme points of view supported by Farfan and Nachemson. This theory demonstrates the irreducible link between compression and torsion phenomena which are an integral part of the principle of human locomotion. ASN: What are the general principles of your Spinal Engine theory? SG: The main idea is that locomotion is an activity which takes precedence to all other activities. The individuals of a species must move in order to survive and enjoy vital bodily freedom. However, we need to define certain limits to this hypothesis. According to this theory, the animal must travel from point A to point B by consuming a minimum of energy, in a constant gravitational field, with, as a corollary, that while walking, the various structures (bone, ligaments and muscles) must be submitted to a minimum of stress. Anatomy therefore emerges as the solution and not the given parameter of the problem. All of the possible solutions to this problem have led to many anatomic configurations, and our anatomy is only one expression of these numerous possibilities. The human body as we know it today, is mainly the consequence of the need to effectively walk on two feet in a constant gravitational field. The spinal engine oscillates within this gravitational field. ASN: What, then,is the role of the spine in the locomotion? SG: I consider the spine to be the \"primary\" engine, in the etymological sense of the word. This primary engine, so obvious in our ancestors the fish, has not travelled towards the lower limbs over time, although its role has become more obscure and may appear to be secondary to the role of the lower limbs. However, this logic is faulty, as we are able to \"walk\" on our knees with relatively little adaptation, which demonstrates that our legs are not truly essential to human locomotion. A wooden leg is just as effective. It would be conceivable to cut the femur one centimeter above the knee without significantly affecting walking. This therefore raises the question: how far can we cut the femur before affecting human locomotion. The answer is that the lower extremity can be completely «Are the legs really necessary ???» Compression Torsion “Pathology gives data on how the spine is used in life. Any explanation for human gait must incorporate these pathological findings.”\n\n26. removed without interfering with the primary movement of the pelvis. This statement may appear somewhat excessive, but it is supported by the facts. Prof. Gracovetsky then showed us a film on his computer, representing a man with no legs and no stumps walking by successively advancing his ischial tuberosities, as if he had legs. The spinal mechanics then appeared to be the engine of this locomotion, which appeared to so closely resemble normal walking. It is obviously preferable to have legs, but they only amplify the movements of the pelvis, and their functional role remains secondary. ASN: Can you briefly describe the interrelations between the spine, the pelvis and the lower limbs? SG: The spinal engine is quite obvious in the case of a snake or a lizard, but when a high level of power needs to be developed, the muscles of the trunk are insufficient. To increase the volume of energy-generating muscles, they had to be displaced outside of the abdominal cavity, to the legs. The first role of the legs is to support the energy sources, which enable us to move at high speeds. However, rotation of the pelvis (as the pelvis rotates around a vertical axis when we walk) with muscles which draw the pelvis downwards leads to a problem of efficacy. This problem is resolved by using the earth's gravitational field as the site of intermediate storage, in which the muscle energy released by the legs with each step is temporarily stored and then recovered during the monopodal stance phase. This energy impulse then ascends up the leg and is filtered by the leg, so that it reaches the vertebral column with the appropriate phase and amplitude. The spine can therefore use this energy to mobilize each intervertebral joint, and to rotate each vertebra and the pelvis in an appropriate fashion. Movement of the vertebral column, especially its axial rotation movement, is therefore derived from the hip extensor muscles. ASN: What happens in the static position? SG: The anatomic structures which connect the spine to the lower limbs are considerable. Take biceps femoris or the hamstrings, for example; the force generated by the hamstrings are channelled by the sacrotuberous ligament, which controls longissimus lumborum and latissimus lumborum situated on either side of the lumbar spine. Part of the sacrotuberous ligament then controls the iliocostalis thoracis muscle up to the superior part of the thoracic spine. Two transverse planes (the right hamstrings control part of the muscles connected to the left side of the thorax and vice versa) constitute another direct link between the hamstrings and the superior part of the thoracic spine. Another important linking element consists of gluteus maximus which crosses the medial aspect of the spine to be attached to latissimus dorsi, which controls arm movements. All of these connections form a sort of cross-pyramid of the back, which ensures very strong mechanical integrity from the upper limbs to the lower limbs. ASN: Can you place the configuration of the human locomotor apparatus, as we know it, in the context of evolution? SG: The presumed starting point (as it is only a hypothesis) is that primitive fish, 450 million years ago, moved in the same way as modern fish, i.e. by a lateral inflection movement of the spine. Fish which subsequently ventured onto dry land were faced with several problems, the first being to move by planting their fins into the mud by means of an alternating movement. This axial rotation movement combined with the lateral flexion movement resulted in the movements of flexion and extension. Thus, the simple need to move over small pebbles led our fish to invent flexion and extension movements. This same flexion-extension movement subsequently allowed galloping and the development of the lower limbs, as the para-axial muscles gradually moved outside of the abdominal cavity to become hamstring muscles, in order to increase the brute power available for locomotion. Some of these vertebrates subsequently returned to the sea, while April 2001 - N° 3 ARGOS SpineNews 35 evaluation The Spine Engine \" Only half the available muscle power is used. Each step advances the animal by one shoulder width \"\n\n27. evaluation The Spine Engine 36 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 retaining their capacities for flexion- extension movements acquired during their \"stay\" on dry land. These animals are marine mammals, which also breathe in a very different way from fish. The hypothesis that these marine mammals are descendants of terrestrial quadrupeds, at their turn descended from marine animals is now generally accepted. The inevitable increase in the muscle mass of the legs then made an upright posture possible. Finally, the need to advance and therefore to pivot the pelvis in two alternating ways, gave rise to the spinal mechanics that we now know today. ASN: When we listen to you speak, we have the impression that you are neither a doctor, nor a biomechanical engineer. How would you describe yourself? SG: I have never thought about it, but I am certainly proud to have contributed to solving certain problems. The solutions that I proposed were the subject of a great many criticisms, sometimes more destructive than constructive, but in the final analysis, the need to reply to these criticisms was a major element that helped me to present my ideas more rigorously. It is true that I sometimes felt that certain criticisms did not always reflect a disagreement based on good faith, and I sometimes answered in a way that I now regret. ASN: Don't you think that your theory was the subject of so much criticism because you did not belong to any clearly identified discipline? SG: I was not trying to solve the problem of human locomotion. Many other scientists more erudite than myself possessed the necessary elements to converge on this vision of the spinal engine. Lowett in 1898 (a century ago!) came close to this solution, but did not take the last step, as it appeared far too incongruous. I can also think of people like Farfan, Nachemson, Pope, Winter and many others. All in all, it wasn't my place to find this solution, but rather all these other people who had infinitely more knowledge and experience in relation to the spine. I felt a need and I saw a gap in the logic of our knowledge at the time. I was very young when I entered this field (I was appointed Professor at Concordia University in Montréal in 1970), with a certain independence of mind, and I started by studying everything that my predecessors had done. It took me 3 years to review thousands of publications on the subject, which I refined to 600 or 700 papers that I considered to be important. There were papers all over my office: on the floor, in cabinets. I was therefore faced with strong and often divergent opinions voiced by honest people and I asked myself how I could incorporate all of these diverging views into an all- encompassing theory, a sort of unifying theory, as is often the case in physics. Then, one day in January 1983, I suddenly had a vision : I saw the spine walking, a sort of slow-motion film. I then had to formulate this vision into a theory which was mathematically sound and publish it, which I did for the first time in 1985. ASN: What are your current projects? SG: I made a lot of errors in the way in which systems for the diagnosis of spinal diseases should be designed. I fought for many years to promote the use of a measurement platform, which can be greatly improved. When I started, about twenty years ago, computers were very slow, and measurement systems were relatively inefficient. Currently available solutions will inevitably integrate digital “Solution: Change locomotor design to advance by one body length at each step” “Lordosis is a unique feature of the human spine” “Lateral bending with lordosis induces an axial torque”\n\n28. imaging, slightly more advanced tools for the assessment of pain, some of the patient's psychological aspects, and function. This should provide a more accurate description of the patient, which will obviously not be perfect, but which, in any case, would be better than the system available at the present time. The decision to perform surgery and evaluation of its impact on all of the locomotor apparatus are essential, and I am going to continue to patent several ideas and continue in this direction. ASN: ARGOS is above all a network of orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons. Do you have a special message for our members and readers? SG: The diagnosis of spinal diseases, especially low back pain, is problematic in at least 90% of cases. Nevertheless, the current healthcare system expects the doctor to find a permanent solution to an insoluble problem. Health authorities need to recognize that low back pain is a difficult condition to diagnose, and provide appropriate resources to help the medical profession. In my opinion, fees for medical procedures concerning low back pain should be considerably increased so that the doctor can spend the necessary time to establish the preoperative and postoperative diagnoses using appropriate tools, while maintaining the same level of income. ■ Interview by A.

Rodgers, M.D. (Jefferson City, MO) evaluation OMNI-AXIAL Connector Introduction DAMAGE to the cephalad facet joint remains one of the technical difficulties arising from transpedicular spinal fixation systems. We describe a novel OMNI-AXIAL screw-rod connector for the SCS/CLARIS Spinal Clip instrumentation system that allows greater offset from the joint and may decrease late facetal degeneration and resultant post-fusion back pain. Preliminary North American results of a consecutive series of eighty lumbar instrumentation procedures (min f/u 3 months) using the new connector are reported. Methods Static and fatigue laboratory testing were performed using the Cunningham Protocol on the OMNI-AXIAL connector. Static testing consisted of standard sub-construct and four screw/connector-rod construct flexion studies on the Instron 8511. A 25-mm flexion arm was used with loads applied at 13 N/sec for sub-construct flexion. A 45-mm lever arm between load directions and arms with a 76-mm superior-inferior screw distance comprised the four screw/connector-rod flexion testing. Comparisons were also made to existing implant systems. The OMNI-AXIAL connector was subsequently used as the cephalad screw-rod connector in a consecutive series of 80 lumbar fusion procedures. Fusions were performed for spondylolisthesis, degenerative disk disease, recurrent herniated nucleus pulposus, scoliosis, neoplastic and metastatic disease, and failed ALIF. Forty-two patients had undergone prior lumbar surgery and nine had had prior instrumentation. Fifty-nine patients were actively abusing tobacco. Three patients had simultaneous anterior fusion procedures. Autogenous iliac crest graft was used in all cases except two. Demineralized bone matrix (ALLOMATRIX, Wright Medical Technology Inc., Memphis, TN) and cancellous allograft was used to augment the autograft in sixty-four procedures. Calcium phosphate derived from coral (ProOsteon, Interpore-Cross Int., Irvine, CA) was used to augment the autograft in eight cases. 40 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 Undesired propagation of fusion (pseudarthrosis) with proximal facet damage.

Lange, M.D. (St. Louis, MO) evaluation OMNI-AXIAL Connector Results Sub-construct testing revealed rod bending (at mean 53 daN load) prior to any rotational slippage of the connector. Four screw/connector-rod testing yielded 63 daN loads to without any connector movement. Two samples were fatigue tested at 5,000,000 cycles with 20 daN load. Preliminary clinical results (min 3 months, range 3-12 months) have been encouraging with routine progression toward fusion and no complications related to the new connector. Conclusion The SCS/CLARIS Spinal Clip instrumentation system OMNI-AXIAL connector permits caudal displacement of the rod-screw interface. This translation coupled with the narrow diameter of the transpedicular screw post permits proximal construct fixation with minimal damage to the cephalad facet. Proximal facet preservation may diminish later post-fusion back pain.

The first biomedical applications of shape memory alloys (SMA) appeared 20 years ago. Since then, researchers have been working on the expanded properties of these alloys, engineers have exploited them to develop new medical devices and surgeons have spread innovative surgical techniques throughout the world. AS it is now well-established that almost 80% of the world-wide innovative technologies are described in existing patents, it seemed interesting to summarize these 20 years of research and development through a retrospective study ofthe patents issued in this field since 1978. We will see that specific analysis applied to a patent database can give precise technologic and market trends. The following statistics have been extracted from WPI database (Word Patent Index) which covers more than 20 million patents issued in 40 industrialized countries for 20 years. Industry segments We have found that 3695 patents have been published on SMA since 1978, among which 365, exactly 10%, dealwith medical applications. Furthermore, the International Classification of Patents reveals which specific areas are covered by these 365 patents. Among the 3 main biomedical fields of application of SMA, the breakdown is: Orthopedics cardio vascular dental 45 % 44 % 11 % Tab.1 : Percentage of patents on various medical applications of SMA Publication years The evolution of the number of patents per year gives valuable information about the maturity level of a technology: depending whether the number of patents is increasing or decreasing, it means that the technology involved is either innovative or has reach the limit of its evolution. Here, the number of patents is constantly increasing since 1982, which proves that the biomedical use of SMA is still growing. Priority countries The priority country is the first country of publication of a patent. The distribution of priority countries gives a good indication of the leading nations in a specific technology. It shows the overwhelming leadership of Japan and United States, with 144 and 132 with first publications respectively. Designated states The designated states are the countries where a patent is extended between 12 and 18 months after its first registration. This gives a good trend of the potential economic markets as seen by the companies who publish these patents. It seems that the market is quite balanced between North America (US+CA – 197 patents) and the Pacific area (JP+AU – 227 patents) and that the European market is considered far less important (DE+FR+RU+GB – 111 patent). Conclusion This retrospective study based upon patents’ statistical analysis highlights the 42 ARGOS SpineNews N° 3- April 2001 evaluation Shape-memory alloys Retrospective study on medic applications of shape-memor Fig.1 : Evolution of the number of patents per year\n\n32. trends followed by SMA in the biomedical field : - Japanese and North American leadership - increasing development for more than 15 years. It can be concluded that despite manufacturing difficulties, relatively high cost and severe market regulations, shape-memory alloy applications are successfully finding their way to impact a growing number of medical devices.
