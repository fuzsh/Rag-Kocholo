        "text": "Ahh yes, Guild Drama. People in the WoM Forum community have believed that Guild Drama and Guild Wars is what will fuel the Guilds Update of World of Magic and onwards. Noble Phantasm are seen as elites, everyone hates Lotus Order and Exalted. Suncry are chads. Different Guilds have already made alliances and enemies. So here, I shall record every event between guilds, every alliance, every war, every agreement, all here… if someone tells me it. And I am totally not biased although I may be joining a guild soon. I shall add the events with each passing day, starting with the release of the Guild Update.\n\nFriday 16th 2020:\n\nVetex posts on Discord. The post says that the update will release between the 17th and 20th. Guilds ready up for the update by training and stacking up crowns.\n\nSaturday 17th 2020, 1 AM UTC:\n\nThe Guild Update has been released, as of writing this, Suncry is winning the infamy race and people in the Vetex Discord already hate Suncry, nice. Chaos will begin to ensue today…\n\n5 AM UTC:\n\nKafka is a guild known for hiding in bushes and Random Killing. Kafka’s leader was temporarily banned at this time. No infamy for 3 days right on release, a cruel one at this time.\n\n5:30 UTC:\n\nKafka believes that Suncry was doing the same tactics as Kafka and were following them, possible to take down the top spot with them. Kafka kills there own players however, to gain infamy.\n\n6:50 UTC:\n\nKafka Guild Master apologises. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.\n\n17:00 UTC:\n\nSyndicate, just like K AFK A, reaches 2nd spot with 433 infamy and 6 members. Possibly alt killing. Spell Breakers, Raven Crest Vanguard and The Void Awoken, follow whilst properly playing at 4th, 5th and 6th.\n\n17th October:\n\nThe event I refer to as the Great Early Game Gank occurs. The first 24 hours of the Guild update are filled with Random Killing and Murder to take the top spot on the infamy leaderboard, also a bit of drama. SunCry takes the top spot after a challenge by K AFK A, which was soon found loopholing. Spell Breakers take 3rd after Syndicate rises to 2nd. The entire WoM community riot the Guild Update, from the forums, to the discord, to messaging members of guilds. The first bloody hours of v1.3 are only a peek of what’s to come…\n\n15:15 UTC:\n\nEye of Chaos and SunCry clash at the gate of Ironport, SunCry wins.\n\nMonday 19th October 2020, 20:10 UTC:\n\nEye of Chaos and SunCry clash again East if the Bell Village Lake, Eye of Chaos leaves the game as SunCry’s infamy was heavily impact, they would bring it back up again.\n\nSunday 25th October 2020:\n\nSyndicate is disbanded. Members of Syndicate have joined Azure Society, possibly a merge of the guilds. A new force has just risen."
