        "text": "Validation of the Sensewear Armband during recreational in-line skating.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoric, Maroje; Mikulic, Pavle; Misigoj-Durakovic, Marjeta; Ruzic, Lana; Markovic, Goran\n\n2012-03-01\n\nMulti-sensor body monitors that combine accelerometry with other physiological data are designed to overcome drawbacks of accelerometers in assessing activities with little or no vertical movement. One of such devices is the Sensewear Armband (SWA) which has been extensively validated during various activities. However, very few of the validation studies included activities other than walking and running. The aim of this investigation was to assess the validity of the SWA during recreational in-line skating. Nineteen participants (11 females and 8 males), 28 (Â±6) years of age, performed in-line skating exercise on a circular track at a self-selected pace. Energy expenditure was measured with the SWA and the Cosmed K4b(2) breath-by-breath portable metabolic unit. The mean (SD) energy expenditure during in-line skating estimated by the SWA [25.5 (5.8) kJ/min] was significantly lower compared with indirect calorimetry [44.2 (9.7) kJ/min, P < 0.001]. Similarly, the mean (SD) MET values recorded by the SWA were also lower compared with IC [5.3 (1.0) METs vs. 9.1 (1.6) METs, P < 0.001]. The ratio limits of agreement suggest that in 95% of cases the SWA will underestimate the energy expenditure and MET values during in-line skating by as much as 24-56% compared with indirect calorimetry. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that the SWA is not able to overcome the drawbacks of accelerometry in assessing activities with limited vertical movement.\n\nEnergy expenditure evaluation in humans and non-human primates by SenseWear Armband.

We studied 26 (15F/11M) human subjects wearing SWA in two different anatomical sites (arm and back) during resting and a cycle-ergometer test and directly compared these results with indirect calorimetry evaluation (IC), performed at the same time. We then inserted the SWA in a metabolic jacket for baboons and evaluated the TEE and REE in free living condition for 6 days in 21 (8F/13M) non-human primates. In humans we found a good correlation between SWA place on the ARM and on the BACK with IC during the resting experiment (1.1Â±0.3 SWAs, 1Â±0.2 IC kcal/min) and a slight underestimation in the SWAs data compared with IC during the cycle-ergometer exercise (5Â±1.9 SWA ARM, 4.5Â±1.5 SWA BACK and 5.4Â±2.1 IC kcal/min). In the non-human primate (baboons) experiment SWA estimated a TEE of 0.54Â±0.009 kcal/min during free living and a REE of 0.82Â±0.06 kcal/min. SWA, an extremely simple and inexpensive apparatus, provides quite accurate measurements of energy expenditure in humans and in baboons. Energy expenditure data obtained with SWA are highly correlated with the data obtained with \"gold standard\", IC, in humans.\n\nEnergy Expenditure Evaluation in Humans and Non-Human Primates by SenseWear Armband.

These advances necessitate evaluation of the validity of newly developed activity monitors being used in clinical and research settings. The purpose of this study was to validate the SenseWear Pro3 Armband (SWA) step counts during treadmill walking and free-living conditions. Study 1 observed 39 individuals (17 males, 22 females) wearing an SWA and a Yamax Digiwalker SW-701 pedometer (DIGI) during treadmill walking, utilizing manually counted steps as the criterion. Study 2 compared free-living step count data from 35 participants (17 males, 18 females) wearing the SWA and DIGI (comparison) for 3 consecutive days. During Study 1, the SWA underestimated steps by 16.0%, 10.7%, 5.6%, 6.1%, and 6.5% at speeds of 54Â m/min, 67Â m/min, 80Â m/min, 94Â m/min, and 107Â m/min, respectively, compared to manually counted steps. During Study 2, the intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficient of mean steps/d between the SWA and DIGI was strong (rÂ =Â 0.98, p Â <Â 0.001). Unlike Study 1, the SWA overestimated step counts during the 3-day wear period by an average of 1028 steps/d (or +11.3%) compared to the DIGI. When analyzed individually, the SWA consistently overestimated step counts for each day ( p Â <Â 0.05). The SWA underestimates steps during treadmill walking and appears to overestimate steps during free-living compared to the DIGI pedometer. Caution is warranted when using the SWA to count steps. Modifications are needed to enhance step counting accuracy.\n\nIs the SenseWear Armband accurate enough to quantify and estimate energy expenditure in healthy adults?\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos-Lozano, Alejandro; HernÃ¡ndez-Vicente, AdriÃ¡n; PÃ©rez-Isaac, RaÃºl; SantÃ­n-Medeiros, Fernanda; Cristi-Montero, Carlos; CasajÃºs, Jose Antonio; Garatachea, Nuria\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe SenseWear Armband (SWA) is a monitor that can be used to estimate energy expenditure (EE); however, it has not been validated in healthy adults. The objective of this paper was to study the validity of the SWA for quantifying EE levels. Twenty-three healthy adults (age 40-55 years, mean: 48Â±3.42 years) performed different types of standardized physical activity (PA) for 10 minutes (rest, walking at 3 and 5 kmÂ·h -1 , running at 7 and 9 kmÂ·h -1 , and sitting/standing at a rate of 30 cycleÂ·min -1 ). Participants wore the SWA on their right arm, and their EE was measured by indirect calorimetry (IC) the gold standard. There were significant differences between the SWA and IC, except in the group that ran at 9 kmÂ·h -1 (>9 METs). Bland-Altman analysis showed a BIAS of 1.56 METs (Â±1.83 METs) and limits of agreement (LOA) at 95% of -2.03 to 5.16 METs. There were indications of heteroscedasticity (R 2 =0.03; P<0.05). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the SWA seems to be not sensitive enough to estimate the level of EE at highest intensities. The SWA is not as precise in estimating EE as IC, but it could be a useful tool to determine levels of EE at low intensities.\n\nMonitoring Energy Expenditure Using a Multi-Sensor Device-Applications and Limitations of the SenseWear Armband in Athletic Populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoehler, Karsten; Drenowatz, Clemens\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn order to monitor their energy requirements, athletes may desire to assess energy expenditure (EE) during training and competition. Recent technological advances and increased customer interest have created a market for wearable devices that measure physiological variables and bodily movement over prolonged time periods and convert this information into EE data. This mini-review provides an overview of the applicability of the SenseWear armband (SWA), which combines accelerometry with measurements of heat production and skin conductivity, to measure total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and its components such as exercise energy expenditure (ExEE) in athletic populations. While the SWA has been shown to provide valid estimates of EE in the general population, validation studies in athletic populations indicate a tendency toward underestimation of ExEE particularly during high-intensity exercise (>10 METs) with an increasing underestimation as exercise intensity increases. Although limited information is available on the accuracy of the SWA during resistance exercise, high-intensity interval exercise, or mixed exercise forms, there seems to be a similar trend of underestimating high levels of ExEE. The SWA, however, is capable of detecting movement patterns and metabolic measurements even at high exercise intensities, suggesting that underestimation may result from limitations in the proprietary algorithms. In addition, the SWA has been used in the assessment of sleep quantity and quality as well as non-exercise activity thermogenesis. Overall, the SWA provides viable information and remains to be used in various clinical and athletic settings, despite the termination of its commercial sale.\n\nStudy to determine the criterion validity of the SenseWear Armband as a measure of physical activity in people with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTierney, Marie; Fraser, Alexander; Purtill, Helen; Kennedy, Norelee\n\n2013-06-01\n\nMeasuring physical activity in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is of great importance in light of the increased mortality in this population due to cardiovascular disease. Validation of activity monitors in specific populations is recommended to ensure the accuracy of physical activity measurement. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the validity of the SenseWear Pro3 Armband (SWA) as a measure of physical activity during activities of daily living (ADL) in people with RA. Fourteen subjects (8 men and 6 women) with a diagnosis of RA were recruited from rheumatology clinics at the Mid-Western Regional Hospitals, Limerick, Ireland. Participants undertook a series of ADL of varying intensities. The SWA was compared to the criterion measures of the Oxycon Mobile indirect calorimetry system (energy expenditure in kJ) and of manual video observation (step count). Bland and Altman, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and correlation analyses were done using SPSS, version 19.0. The SWA showed substantial agreement (ICC 0.717, P < 0.001) and a strong relationship (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.852) compared with the criterion measure when estimating energy expenditure during ADL. However, it was found that the SWA overestimated energy expenditure, particularly at higher intensity levels. The ability of the SWA to estimate step counts during ADL was poor (ICC 0.304, P = 0.038). The SWA can be considered a valid tool to estimate energy expenditure during ADL in the RA population; however, attention should be paid to its tendency to overestimate energy expenditure.

However, despite its frequent use in patients with RA, its validity has not been ascertained in this population. The aim of this study was to examine the criterion validity of energy expenditure from physical activity recorded with the IPAQ-SF in patients with RA compared with the objective criterion measure, the SenseWear Armband (SWA) which has been validated previously in this population. Cross-sectional criterion validation study. Regional hospital outpatient setting. Twenty-two patients with RA attending outpatient rheumatology clinics. Subjects wore an SWA for 7 full consecutive days and completed the IPAQ-SF. Energy expenditure from physical activity recorded by the SWA and the IPAQ-SF. Energy expenditure from physical activity recorded by the IPAQ-SF and the SWA showed a small, non-significant correlation (r=0.407, P=0.60). The IPAQ-SF underestimated energy expenditure from physical activity by 41% compared with the SWA. This was corroborated using Bland and Altman plots, as the IPAQ-SF was found to overestimate energy expenditure from physical activity in nine of the 22 individuals, and underestimate energy expenditure from physical activity in the remaining 13 individuals. The IPAQ-SF has limited use as an accurate and absolute measure for estimating energy expenditure from physical activity in patients with RA. Copyright Â© 2014 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

Children in 2nd-4th grades (N = 33) wore the SenseWear Armband (SWA) for five school days to measure EE. Teachers' logs were compared to SWA data to extract information about EE throughout the day.

Its prediction algorithms have been updated periodically. The aim was to validate SW in children, adolescents, and adults. The most recent SW algorithm 5.2 (SW5.2) and the previous version 2.2 (SW2.2) were evaluated for estimation of energy expenditure during semi-structured activities in 35 children, 31 adolescents, and 36 adults with indirect calorimetry as reference. Energy expenditure estimated from waist-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ data (AG) was used for comparison. Improvements in measurement errors were demonstrated with SW5.2 compared to SW2.2, especially in children and for biking. The overall mean absolute percent error with SW5.2 was 24% in children, 23% in adolescents, and 20% in adults. The error was larger for sitting and standing (23%-32%) and for basketball and biking (19%-35%), compared to walking and running (8%-20%). The overall mean absolute error with AG was 28% in children, 22% in adolescents, and 28% in adults. The absolute percent error for biking was 32%-74% with AG. In general, SW and AG underestimated energy expenditure. However, both methods demonstrated a proportional bias, with increasing underestimation for increasing energy expenditure level, in addition to the large individual error. SW provides measures of energy expenditure level with similar accuracy in children, adolescents, and adults with the improvements in the updated algorithms. Although SW captures biking better than AG, these methods share remaining measurements errors requiring further improvements for accurate measures of physical activity and energy expenditure in clinical and epidemiological research.

Long-term treatment with levodopa is frequently associated with motor fluctuations. A low-protein (LP) dietary regimen has proved to be effective in reducing this adverse effect, but has been associated with weight loss, probably due to increased energy expenditure. A new wearable device (SenseWear Armband [SWA]) has recently been introduced into clinical practice. It is designed to monitor physical activity continuously and provide estimates of energy consumption. We assessed its role in measuring the effects of dietary regimens on motor function in PD. Six patients with levodopa-treated PD and motor fluctuations were asked to follow a balanced diet (protein 1g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 7 d and then to cross over to a isocaloric LP (protein 0.7 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) dietary regimen. Total daily energy expenditures, physical activity, number of steps, and metabolic rate were assessed continuously (14 d) by the SWA. Motor control was evaluated by daily diaries. The SWA proved that, during the LP diet, mean total daily energy expenditure was higher (P<0.05) and so were physical activity (P=0.05) and average metabolic rate (P=0.01), despite no change in the number of steps. The duration of periods with dyskinesias was also increased (P<0.05). These data support the role of upper-extremity involuntary movements in increasing total daily energy expenditure during an LP diet. The SWA may help in monitoring patients with PD because it can assist in evaluating motor response to treatment and changes in physical activity and daily calorie needs. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, one of the limitations of these instruments is the inability to capture light activity within an acceptable range of error. The purpose of the present study was to determine the validity of different activity monitors for estimating energy expenditure (EE) of light intensity, semi-structured activities. Forty healthy participants wore a SenseWear Pro3 Armband (SWA, v.6.1), the SenseWear Mini, the Actiheart, ActiGraph, and ActivPAL monitors, while being monitored with a portable indirect calorimetry (IC). Participants engaged in a variety of low intensity activities but no formalized scripts or protocols were used during these periods. The Mini and SWA overestimated total EE on average by 1.0% and 4.0%, respectively, while the AH, the GT3X, and the AP underestimated total EE on average by 7.8%, 25.5%, and 22.2%, respectively. The pattern-recognition monitors yielded non-significant differences in EE estimates during the semi-structured period (pâ=â0.66, pâ=â0.27, and pâ=â0.21 for the Mini, SWA, and AH, respectively). The SenseWear Mini provided more accurate estimates of EE during light to moderate intensity semi-structured activities compared to other activity monitors. This monitor should be considered when there is interest in tracking low intensity activities in groups of individuals.\n\nInfluence of lifestyle habits, nutritional status and insulin resistance in NAFLD.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalavolti, Marcella; Battistini, Nino Carlo; Miglioli, Lucia; Bagni, Ilaria; Borelli, Luca; Marino, Mariano; Scaglioni, Federica; Bellentani, Stefano\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNon alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance (IR). The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between IR, anthropometry, lifestyle habits, resting energy expenditure (REE) and degree of fatty liver at ultrasound in 48 overweight patients with NAFLD as compared to 24 controls without fatty liver, matched for age. Nutritional status, alcohol intake and physical activity were assessed by skinfold thickness measurements, a 7-day diary, and SenseWear armband (SWA). REE was assessed by both SWA (REE-SWA) and a Vmax metabolic cart (REE-Vmax). Fatty liver was measured by US and the Doppler Power Index was calculated. IR was assessed using the HOMA index. There was significant correlation between waist circumference, HOMA, Doppler power index and fatty liver grade at US. Multivariate analysis showed that alteration of waist circumference, Doppler power index, and HOMA were the major significant predictors of fatty liver. Our data demonstrated a significant association between NAFLD and central adiposity and IR.\n\nComparison of methods to assess energy expenditure and physical activity in people with spinal cord injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanhoffer, Ricardo A; Tanhoffer, Aldre I P; Raymond, Jacqueline; Hills, Andrew P; Davis, Glen M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo compare different methods of assessing energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity (PA) in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) under community-dwelling conditions. A reference standard encompassing the doubly labelled water (DLW) technique, heart rate monitoring (FLEX-HR), a multi-sensor armband (SenseWear Armband (SWA)), and two PA recall questionnaires were employed in 14 people with SCI to estimate EE and leisure-time PA. Mean total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) assessed by DLW, FLEX-HR, and SWA were 9817 Â± 2491 kJ/day, 8498 Â± 1516 kJ/day, and 11414 Â± 3242 kJ/day, respectively. Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) quantified by DLW was 2841 Â± 1626 kJ/day, 2935 Â± 1732 kJ/day estimated from FLEX-HR, and 2773 Â± 2966 kJ/day derived from SWA. After converting the PA recall questionnaire data to EE in kJ/day, PAEE for the Physical Activity Recall Assessment for People with Spinal Cord Injury (PARA-SCI) was 2339 Â± 1171 kJ/day and for Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD) 749 Â± 1026 kJ/day. DLW-quantified PAEE was moderately associated with PARA-SCI (R(2) = 0.62, P < 0.05), but not with the other estimates of PAEE (R(2) ranged between 0.13 and 0.30, P > 0.05). Our findings revealed that the PARA-SCI recall questionnaire was the best estimate of PAEE compared to the reference standard DLW approach. Although the between-method variability for SWA, FLEX-HR, and PASIPD-derived PAEE was small, there was a weak association between these methods and the criterion DLW technique. The best estimate of DLW-quantified TDEE was by FLEX-HR. SWA significantly overestimated TDEE in this population.\n\nA Comparison of Self-Reported and Objective Physical Activity Measures in Young Australian Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nHartley, Stefanie; Garland, Suzanne; Young, Elisa; Bennell, Kim Louise; Tay, Ilona; Gorelik, Alexandra; Wark, John Dennis\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe evidence for beneficial effects of recommended levels of physical activity is overwhelming. However, 70% of Australians fail to meet these levels. In particular, physical activity participation by women falls sharply between ages 16 to 25 years. Further information about physical activity measures in young women is needed. Self-administered questionnaires are often used to measure physical activity given their ease of application, but known limitations, including recall bias, compromise the accuracy of data. Alternatives such as objective measures are commonly used to overcome this problem, but are more costly and time consuming. To compare the output between the Modified Active Australia Survey (MAAS), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and an objective physical activity measure-the SenseWear Armband (SWA)-to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the MAAS and to determine the acceptability of the SWA among young women. Young women from Victoria, Australia, aged 18 to 25 years who had participated in previous studies via Facebook advertising were recruited. Participants completed the two physical activity questionnaires online, immediately before and after wearing the armband for 7 consecutive days. Data from the SWA was blocked into 10-minute activity times. Follow-up IPAQ, MAAS, and SWA data were analyzed by comparing the total continuous and categorical activity scores, while concurrent validity of IPAQ and MAAS were analyzed by comparing follow-up scores. Test-retest reliability of MAAS was analyzed by comparing MAAS total physical activity scores at baseline and follow-up. Participants provided feedback in the follow-up questionnaire about their experience of wearing the armband to determine acceptability of the SWA. Data analyses included graphical (ie, Bland-Altman plot, scatterplot) and analytical (ie, canonical correlation, kappa statistic) methods to determine agreement between MAAS, IPAQ, and SWA data.

PMID:22330189\n\nAgreement between self-reported sleep patterns and actigraphy in fibromyalgia and healthy women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSegura-JimÃ©nez, VÃ­ctor; Camiletti-MoirÃ³n, Daniel; MunguÃ­a-Izquierdo, Diego; Ãlvarez-Gallardo, Inmaculada C; Ruiz, Jonatan R; Ortega, Francisco B; Delgado-FernÃ¡ndez, Manuel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo examine the agreement between objective (accelerometer) and subjective measures of sleep in fibromyalgia women (FW) and healthy women (HW). To identify explanatory variables of the discrepancies between the objective and subjective measures in FW and in HW. 127 diagnosed FW and 53 HW filled the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and wore the SenseWear Pro Armband (SWA) for 7 days in order to assess sleep over the last week. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) when the SWA was returned. The SWA showed greater total duration (74 vs. 88 min/day) and average duration (7 vs. 9 min) of wake after sleep onset in FW compared with HW. The PSQI showed poorer sleep quality in all the variables studied in FW than in HW (all, p<0.001), except time in bed. There was a lack of inter-method agreement for total sleep time, sleep time without naps and sleep latency in FW. Age and educational status explained the inter-method mean difference in sleep time in FW. High discrepancy in sleep time between the SWA and the PSQI was related to higher FIQ scores (p<0.05). The objective measure only showed higher frequency and average duration of wake after sleep onset in FW compared with HW. The agreement between the SWA and the PSQI measures of sleep were poor in the FW group. Age, educational level and the impact of fibromyalgia might be explanatory variables of the inter-method discrepancies in FW.\n\nThe Effects of Physical Activity Feedback on Behavior and Awareness in Employees: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVan Hoye, Karen; Boen, Filip; Lefevre, Johan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose. The SenseWear Armband (SWA) is a multisensor activity monitor that can be used in daily life to assess an individual's physical activity level (PAL). The primary goal of this study was to analyze the impact of different types of feedback on the PAL of Flemish employees. Methods/Design. We recruited 320 sedentary employees (age, 41.0 Â± 10.7 years; BMI, 26.2 Â± 4.2 kg/m2) to participate in the 12-month study. Participants were randomized into one of four intervention groups after being measured for 7 days and nights by means of the SWA: (1) a minimal intervention group received no feedback (MIG, n = 56); (2) a pedometer group was provided only information on their daily step count (PG, n = 57); (3) a display group received feedback on calories burned, steps taken, and minutes of physical activity by means of the SWA display (DG, n = 57); (4) a coaching group also received the display and had weekly meetings with a Personal Coach (CoachG, n = 57). We hypothesize that participants receiving feedback (SG, DG, and CoachG) will have a greater increase in physical activity outcome variables compared to participants of the minimal intervention group.

The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of 24-h Physical Activity Recall (24PAR) relative to SenseWear Armband (SWA) for assessing SB. Each participant (nÂ =Â 1485) undertook a series of data collection procedures on two randomly selected days: wearing a SWA for full 24-h, and then completing the telephone-administered 24PAR the following day to recall the past 24-h activities. Estimates of total sedentary time (TST) were computed without the inclusion of reported or recorded sleep time. Equivalence testing was used to compare estimates of TST. Analyses from equivalence testing showed no significant equivalence of 24PAR for TST (90% CI: 443.0 and 457.6Â minÂ Â·Â day -1 ) relative to SWA (equivalence zone: 580.7 and 709.8Â minÂ Â·Â day -1 ). Bland-Altman plots indicated individuals that were extremely or minimally sedentary provided relatively comparable sedentary time between 24PAR and SWA. Overweight/obese and/or older individuals were more likely to under-estimate sedentary time than normal weight and/or younger individuals. Measurement errors of 24PAR varied by the level of sedentary time and demographic indicators. This evidence informs future work to develop measurement error models to correct for errors of self-reports.\n\nValidity and reliability of Nikeâ+âFuelband for estimating physical activity energy expenditure.\n\nPubMed\n\nTucker, Wesley J; Bhammar, Dharini M; Sawyer, Brandon J; Buman, Matthew P; Gaesser, Glenn A\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Nikeâ+âFuelband is a commercially available, wrist-worn accelerometer used to track physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) during exercise. However, validation studies assessing the accuracy of this device for estimating PAEE are lacking. Therefore, this study examined the validity and reliability of the Nikeâ+âFuelband for estimating PAEE during physical activity in young adults. Secondarily, we compared PAEE estimation of the Nikeâ+âFuelband with the previously validated SenseWear Armband (SWA). Twenty-four participants (nâ=â24) completed two, 60-min semi-structured routines consisting of sedentary/light-intensity, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity physical activity. Participants wore a Nikeâ+âFuelband and SWA, while oxygen uptake was measured continuously with an Oxycon Mobile (OM) metabolic measurement system (criterion). The Nikeâ+âFuelband (ICCâ=â0.77) and SWA (ICCâ=â0.61) both demonstrated moderate to good validity. PAEE estimates provided by the Nikeâ+âFuelband (246âÂ±â67Â kcal) and SWA (238âÂ±â57Â kcal) were not statistically different than OM (243âÂ±â67Â kcal). Both devices also displayed similar mean absolute percent errors for PAEE estimates (Nikeâ+âFuelbandâ=â16âÂ±â13Â %; SWAâ=â18âÂ±â18Â %). Test-retest reliability for PAEE indicated good stability for Nikeâ+âFuelband (ICCâ=â0.96) and SWA (ICCâ=â0.90). The Nikeâ+âFuelband provided valid and reliable estimates of PAEE, that are similar to the previously validated SWA, during a routine that included approximately equal amounts of sedentary/light-, moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity.\n\nValidation of a pre-coded food diary used among 60-80 year old men: comparison of self-reported energy intake with objectively recorded energy expenditure.\n\nPubMed\n\nStea, Tonje H; Andersen, Lene F; Paulsen, GÃ¸ran; Hetlelid, Ken J; Lohne-Seiler, Hilde; Adnanes, Svanhild; BjÃ¸rnsen, Thomas; Salvesen, Svein; Berntsen, Sveinung\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo validate energy intake (EI) estimated from a pre-coded food diary (PFD) against energy expenditure (EE) measured with a valid physical activity monitor (SenseWear Pro3 Armband) and to evaluate whether misreporting was associated with overweight/obesity in a group of elderly men. Forty-seven healthy Norwegian men, 60-80 years old, completed the study. As this study was part of a larger intervention study, cross-sectional data were collected at both baseline and post-test. Participants recorded their food intake for four consecutive days using food diaries and wore SenseWear Pro3 Armband (SWA) during the same period. Only participants with complete data sets at both baseline and post-test were included in the study. The group average EI was 17% lower at baseline and 18% lower at post-test compared to measured EE. Mean difference from Bland-Altman plot for EI and EE was -1.5 MJ/day (Â±1.96 SD: -7.0, 4.0 MJ/day) at baseline and -1.6 MJ/day (-6.6, 3.4 MJ/day) at post-test. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.54, pâ=â0.018) at baseline and 0.34 (0.06, 0.57, pâ=â0.009) at post-test. Higher values of underreporting was shown among overweight/obese compared to normal weight participants at both baseline and post-test (pâ¤ 0.001), respectively. The results indicate that the PFD could be a useful tool for estimating energy intake in normal weight elderly men. On the other hand, the PFD seems to be less suitable for estimating energy intake in overweight/obese elderly men.\n\nValidation and reliability of two activity monitors for energy expenditure assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrazeau, Anne-Sophie; Beaudoin, Nadia; BÃ©lisle, Virginie; Messier, Virginie; Karelis, Antony D; Rabasa-Lhoret, RÃ©mi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study explores the reliability and validity of the SenseWear Armband (SWA) and Actical (ACT) for free-living total energy expenditure, and energy expenditure during rest and light-to-moderate exercises (walking, ergocycling). Participants wore the 2 devices during 7 days (free-living) and then participated to 3 days of testing in our laboratory. SWA and ACT estimates of total energy expenditure was compared to the doubly labeled water technique (7 days), and energy expenditure during rest (60min), treadmill (45min; intensities â¼22% to â¼41% VO2peak) and ergocycling (45min; â¼50% VO2peak) were compared to indirect calorimetry over the following 3 days. Paired T-tests and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence interval (CI95) were computed. Twenty adults were recruited (BMI 23.1Â±2.3kg/m(2)). Compared to doubly labelled water, SWA overestimated energy expenditure by 94kcal/d (Â±319; P=0.2) and ACT underestimated by -244kcal/d (Â±258; P=0.001). Energy expenditure during rest (SWA 210Â±116, ACT 124Â±133kcal/d; p<0.05) and treadmill (according on intensity: SWA 54Â±46 to 67Â±38, ACT 68Â±25 to 84Â±40kcal; p<0.05) were overestimated and underestimated during ergocycling (SWA -93Â±65, ACT -269Â±111kcal; p<0.05) compared to indirect calorimetry. High ICC were observed at rest (SWA 0.994 CI95 0.987-0.997; ACT 0.998 CI95 0.996-0.999) and during ergocycling (SWA 0.941 CI95 0.873-0.975; ACT 0.854 CI95 0.687-0.939). Acceptable estimation of total energy expenditure was observed with the SWA. Both devices were reliable but not accurate for energy expenditure's estimations during rest and for specific exercises.

The goal of the current analyses was to determine whether the SenseWearÂ® Pro3 Armband (armband), typically used to assess physical activity, is reliable at assessing sleep parameters. We compared the armband to the AMI MotionloggerÂ® (actigraph), a validated activity monitor for sleep assessment and to polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for assessing sleep. Participants were twenty adolescents (mean age=15.5 years) with a mean BMI %tile of 63.7. All participants wore the armband and actigraph on their non-dominant arm while in-lab during a nocturnal PSG recording (600 minutes). Epoch-by-epoch sleep/wake data and concordance of sleep parameters were examined. No significant sleep parameter differences were found between the armband and PSG; the actigraph tended to overestimate sleep and underestimate wake compared to PSG. Both devices showed high sleep sensitivity, but lower wake detection rates. Bland-Altman plots showed large individual differences in armband sleep parameter concordance rates. The armband did well estimating sleep overall with group results more similar to PSG than the actigraph; however, the armband was less accurate at an individual level than the actigraph.

In this paper, an IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation system was introduced which was based on a smart wearable armband (SWA), machine learning (ML) algorithms, and a 3-D printed dexterous robot hand. User comfort is one of the key issues which should be addressed for wearable devices. The SWA was developed by integrating a low-power and tiny-sized IoT sensing device with textile electrodes, which can measure, pre-process, and wirelessly transmit bio-potential signals. By evenly distributing surface electrodes over user's forearm, drawbacks of classification accuracy poor performance can be mitigated. A new method was put forward to find the optimal feature set. ML algorithms were leveraged to analyze and discriminate features of different hand movements, and their performances were appraised by classification complexity estimating algorithms and principal components analysis. According to the verification results, all nine gestures can be successfully identified with an average accuracy up to 96.20%. In addition, a 3-D printed five-finger robot hand was implemented for hand rehabilitation training purpose. Correspondingly, user's hand movement intentions were extracted and converted into a series of commands which were used to drive motors assembled inside the dexterous robot hand. As a result, the dexterous robot hand can mimic the user's gesture in a real-time manner, which shows the proposed system can be used as a training tool to facilitate rehabilitation process for the patients after stroke.\n\nHuman factors engineering approaches to patient identification armband design.\n\nPubMed\n\nProbst, C Adam; Wolf, Laurie; Bollini, Mara; Xiao, Yan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe task of patient identification is performed many times each day by nurses and other members of the care team. Armbands are used for both direct verification and barcode scanning during patient identification. Armbands and information layout are critical to reducing patient identification errors and dangerous workarounds. We report the effort at two large, integrated healthcare systems that employed human factors engineering approaches to the information layout design of new patient identification armbands. The different methods used illustrate potential pathways to obtain standardized armbands across healthcare systems that incorporate human factors principles. By extension, how the designs have been adopted provides examples of how to incorporate human factors engineering into key clinical processes.

To address this question, we have studied the measured data of two consumer-level activity monitors (Up Move Jawbone Â® (U) and Withings Pulse 02 Â® (W)) and compared it with reference methods for sleep and activity recordings, namely the Bodymedia SenseWear Pro Armband Â® actigraph (SWA) and home-polysomnography (H-PSG). Twenty healthy patients were assessed at home, during sleep, with the four devices. An additional 24-h period of recording was then planned during which they wore the 2 trackers and the SWA. Physical activity and sleep parameters obtained with the 4 devices were analyzed. Significant correlations with H-PSG were obtained for total sleep time (TST) for all the devices: r=0.48 for W (p=0.04), r=0.63 for U (p=0.002), r=0.7 for SWA (p=0.0003). The best coefficient was obtained with SWA. Significant correlations were also obtained for time in bed (TIB) for U and SWA vs PSG (r=0.79 and r=0.76, p<0.0001 for both) but not for W (r=0.45, p=0.07). No significant correlations were obtained for deep sleep, light sleep, and sleep efficiency (SE) measurements with W, U and SWA. Sleep latency (SL) correlated with H-PSG only when measured against SWA (r=0.5, p=0.02). Physical activity assessment revealed significant correlations for U and W with SWA for step count (both r=0.95 and p<0.0001) and active energy expenditure (EE) (r=0.65 and 0.54; p=0.0006 and p<0.0001). Total EE was also correctly estimated (r=0.75 and 0.52; p<0.0001 and p=0.001). Sleep and activity monitors are only able to produce a limited set of reliable measurements, such as TST, step count, and active EE, with a preference for U which performs globally better. Despite the manual activation to sleep mode, U and W were not suitable for giving correct data such as sleep architecture, SE, and SL. In the future, to enhance accuracy of such monitors\n\nValidity and Reliability of Accelerometers in Patients With COPD: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.\n\nPubMed\n\nGore, Shweta; Blackwood, Jennifer; Guyette, Mary; Alsalaheen, Bara\n\n2018-05-01\n\nReduced physical activity is associated with poor prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Accelerometers have greatly improved quantification of physical activity by providing information on step counts, body positions, energy expenditure, and magnitude of force. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the validity and reliability of accelerometers used in patients with COPD. An electronic database search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was performed. Study quality was assessed with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist while methodological quality was assessed using the modified Quality Appraisal Tool for Reliability Studies. The search yielded 5392 studies; 25 met inclusion criteria. The SenseWear Pro armband reported high criterion validity under controlled conditions (r = 0.75-0.93) and high reliability (ICC = 0.84-0.86) for step counts. The DynaPort MiniMod demonstrated highest concurrent validity for step count using both video and manual methods. Validity of the SenseWear Pro armband varied between studies especially in free-living conditions, slower walking speeds, and with addition of weights during gait. A high degree of variability was found in the outcomes used and statistical analyses performed between studies, indicating a need for further studies to measure reliability and validity of accelerometers in COPD. The SenseWear Pro armband is the most commonly used accelerometer in COPD, but measurement properties are limited by gait speed variability and assistive device use. DynaPort MiniMod and Stepwatch accelerometers demonstrated high validity in patients with COPD but lack reliability data.\n\nConcurrent Validity of Wearable Activity Trackers Under Free-Living Conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrooke, Skyler M; An, Hyun-Sung; Kang, Seoung-Ki; Noble, John M; Berg, Kris E; Lee, Jung-Min\n\n2017-04-01\n\nBrooke, SM, An, H-S, Kang, S-K, Noble, JM, Berg, KE, and Lee, J-M. Concurrent validity of wearable activity trackers under free-living conditions. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 1097-1106, 2017-The purpose of this study is to evaluate the concurrent validity of wearable activity trackers in energy expenditure (EE) and sleep period time (SPT) under free-living conditions. Ninety-five (28.5 Â± 9.8 years) healthy men (n = 34) and women (n = 61) participated in this study. The total EE and SPT were measured using 8 monitors: Nike+ FuelBand SE (NFB), Garmin VivoFit (VF), Misfit Shine (MF), Fitbit Flex (FF), Jawbone UP (JU), Polar Loop (PL), Fitbit Charge HR (FC), and SenseWear Armband Mini (SWA) (criterion measures: SWA for EE and a sleep log for SPT). The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) for EE was 13.0, 15.2, 15.5, 16.1, 16.2, 22.8, and 24.5% for PL, MF, FF, NFB, FC, JU, and VF, respectively. Mean absolute percent errors were calculated for SPT to be 4.0, 8.8, 10.2, 11.5, 12.9, 13.6, 17.5, and 21.61% for VF, FF, JU, FC, MF, SWA laying down, PL, and SWA, respectively. Concurrent validity was examined using equivalence testing on EE (equivalence zone: 2,889.7-3,531.9 kcal); 2 trackers fell short of falling in the zone: PL (2,714.4-3,164.8 kcal) and FC (2,473.8-3,066.5 kcal). For SPT (equivalence zone: 420.6-514.0 minutes), several monitors fell in the zone: PL (448.3-485.6 minutes), MS (442.8-492.2 minutes), and FF (427.7-486.7 minutes). This study suggests that the PL and FC provide a reasonable estimate of EE under free-living conditions. The PL, FC, and MF were the most valid monitors used for measuring SPT.\n\nSwaMURAy - Swapping Memory Unit for Radio Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWinberg, Simon\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThis paper concerns design and performance testing of an HDL module called SwaMURAy that is a configurable, high-speed data sequencing and flow control module serving as an intermediary between data acquisition and subsequent processing stages. While a FIFO suffices for many applications, our case needed a more elaborate solution to overcome legacy design limitations. The SwaMURAy is designed around a system where a block of sampled data is acquired at a fast rate and is then distributed among multiple processing paths to achieve a desired overall processing rate. This architecture provides an effective design pattern around which various software defined radio (SDR) and radio astronomy applications can be built. This solution was partly in response to legacy design restrictions of the SDR platform we used, a difficulty likely experienced by many developers whereby new sampling peripherals are inhibited by legacy characteristics of an underlying reconfigurable platform. Our SDR platform had a planned lifetime of at least five years as a complete redesign and refabrication would be too costly. While the SwaMURAy overcame some performance problems, other problems arose. This paper overviews the SwaMURAy design, performance improvements achieved in an SDR case study, and discusses remaining limitations and workarounds we expect will achieve further improvements.\n\nReliability of Physical Activity Measures During Free-Living Activities in People After Total Knee Arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlmeida, Gustavo J; Irrgang, James J; Fitzgerald, G Kelley; Jakicic, John M; Piva, Sara R\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFew instruments that measure physical activity (PA) can accurately quantify PA performed at light and moderate intensities, which is particularly relevant in older adults. The evidence of their reliability in free-living conditions is limited. The study objectives were: (1) to determine the test-retest reliability of the Actigraph (ACT), SenseWear Armband (SWA), and Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire in assessing free-living PA at light and moderate intensities in people after total knee arthroplasty; (2) to compare the reliability of the 3 instruments relative to each other; and (3) to determine the reliability of commonly used monitoring time frames (24 hours, waking hours, and 10 hours from awakening). A one-group, repeated-measures design was used. Participants wore the activity monitors for 2 weeks, and the CHAMPS questionnaire was completed at the end of each week. Test-retest reliability was determined by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC [2,k]) to compare PA measures from one week with those from the other week. Data from 28 participants who reported similar PA during the 2 weeks were included in the analysis. The mean age of these participants was 69 years (SD=8), and 75% of them were women. Reliability ranged from moderate to excellent for the ACT (ICC=.75-.86) and was excellent for the SWA (ICC=.93-.95) and the CHAMPS questionnaire (ICC=.86-.92). The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the ICCs from the SWA were the only ones within the excellent reliability range (.85-.98). The CHAMPS questionnaire showed systematic bias, with less PA being reported in week 2. The reliability of PA measures in the waking-hour time frame was comparable to that in the 24-hour time frame and reflected most PA performed during this period. Reliability may be lower for time intervals longer than 1 week. All PA measures showed good reliability. The reliability of the ACT was lower than those of the SWA and the CHAMPS\n\nDesign of low SWaP optical terminals for free space optical communications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShubert, P.; Cline, A.; McNally, J.; Pierson, R.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAlong with advantages in higher data rates, spectrum contention, and security, free space optical communications can provide size, weight, and power (SWaP) advantages over radio frequency (RF) systems. SWaP is always an issue in space systems and can be critical in applying free space optical communications to small satellite platforms. The system design of small space-based free space optical terminals with Gbps data rates is addressed. System architectures and requirements are defined to ensure the terminals are capable of acquisition, establishment and maintenance of a free space optical communications link. Design trades, identification of blocking technologies, and performance analyses are used to evaluate the practical limitations to terminal SWaP. Small terminal design concepts are developed to establish their practicality and feasibility. Techniques, such as modulation formats and capacity approaching encoding, are considered to mitigate the disadvantages brought by SWaP limitations, and performance as a function of SWaP is evaluated.\n\nPrion-specific Hsp40 function: The role of the auxilin homolog Swa2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOliver, Emily E.; Troisi, Elizabeth M.; Hines, Justin K.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Yeast prions are protein-based genetic elements that propagate through cell populations via cytosolic transfer from mother to daughter cell. Molecular chaperone proteins including Hsp70, the Hsp40/J-protein Sis1, and Hsp104 are required for continued prion propagation, however the specific requirements of chaperone proteins differ for various prions. We recently reported that Swa2, the yeast homolog of the mammalian protein auxilin, is specifically required for the propagation of the prion [URE3].1 [URE3] propagation requires both a functional J-domain and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of Swa2, but does not require Swa2 clathrin binding. We concluded that the TPR domain determines the specificity of the genetic interaction between Swa2 and [URE3], and that this domain likely interacts with one or more proteins with a C-terminal EEVD motif. Here we extend that analysis to incorporate additional data that supports this hypothesis. We also present new data eliminating Hsp104 as the relevant Swa2 binding partner and discuss our findings in the context of other recent work involving Hsp90. Based on these findings, we propose a new model for Swa2's involvement in [URE3] propagation in which Swa2 and Hsp90 mediate the formation of a multi-protein complex that increases the number of sites available for Hsp104 disaggregation.

Indonesian goverment has developed employee social security system (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) to support worker quality of life. However, there were limited research which could assist BPJS Ketenagakerjaan in evaluating worker quality of life. Worker quality of life could be categorized as the highest worker needs or affective states. SME Worker Affective (SWA) index is being concerned as a basic tool to make balance between worker performance and quality of life in workstation of SMEs. The research objectives are: 1) To optimize the environmental ergonomics in SMEs; 2) To quantify SME Worker Affective (SWA) index based on optimized environmental ergonomics. The research advantage is to support Indonesian goverment in monitoring SMEs good practices to its worker quality of life. Simulated annealing optimized the heart rate and environmental ergonomics parameters. SWA index was determined based on comparison between optimized heart rate and environmental ergonomics parameters. SWA index were quantified for 380 data of worker. The evaluation indicated 51.3% worker in affective and 48.7% in non-affective condition. Research results indicated that stakeholders of SMEs should put more attention on environmental ergonomics and worker affective.\n\nAtypical binding of the Swa2p UBA domain to ubiquitin.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatta-Camacho, Edna; Kozlov, Guennadi; Trempe, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Gehring, Kalle\n\n2009-02-20\n\nSwa2p is an auxilin-like yeast protein that is involved in vesicular transport and required for uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. Swa2p contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is present in a variety of proteins involved in ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated processes. We have determined a structural model of the Swa2p UBA domain in complex with Ub using NMR spectroscopy and molecular docking. Ub recognition occurs predominantly through an atypical interaction in which UBA helix alpha1 and the N-terminal part of helix alpha2 bind to Ub. Mutation of Ala148, a key residue in helix alpha1, to polar residues greatly reduced the affinity of the UBA domain for Ub and revealed a second low-affinity Ub-binding site located on the surface formed by helices alpha1 and alpha3. Surface plasmon resonance showed that the Swa2p UBA domain binds K48- and K63-linked di-Ub in a non-linkage-specific manner. These results reveal convergent evolution of a Ub-binding site on helix alpha1 of UBA domains involved in membrane protein trafficking.\n\nImproved IR detectors to swap heavy systems for SWaP\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManissadjian, Alain; Rubaldo, Laurent; Rebeil, Yann; Kerlain, Alexandre; Brellier, Delphine; Mollard, Laurent\n\n2012-06-01\n\nCooled IR technologies are challenged for answering new system needs like the compactness and the reduction of cryopower which is a key feature for the SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) requirements. Over the last years, SOFRADIR has improved its HgCdTe technology, with effect on dark current reduction, opening the way for High Operating Temperature (HOT) systems that can get rid of the 80K temperature constraint, and therefore releases the Stirling cooler engine power consumption. Performances of the 640Ã512 15Î¼m pitch LW detector working above 100K will be presented. A compact 640Ã512 15Î¼m pitch MW detector presenting high EO performance above 130K with cut-off wavelength above 5.0Î¼m has been developed. Its different performances with respect to the market requirements for SWaP will be discussed. High performance compact systems will make no compromise on detector resolution. The pixel pitch reduction is the answer for resolution enhancement with size reduction. We will therefore also discuss the ongoing developments and market needs for SWaP systems.\n\nAn economic analysis of traditional and technology-based approaches to weight loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nArcher, Edward; Groessl, Erik J; Sui, Xuemei; McClain, Amanda C; Wilcox, Sara; Hand, Gregory A; Meriwether, Rebecca A; Blair, Steven N\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe financial burden and human losses associated with noncommunicable diseases necessitate cost-effective and efficacious interventions. An economic analysis of the Lifestyle Education for Activity and Nutrition (LEAN) Study; an RCT that examined the efficacy of traditional and technology-based approaches to weight loss. Economic analyses from an organizational perspective were conducted for four approaches: standard care control (SC); group weight-loss education (GWL); a multisensor armband (SWA); and the armband in combination with group weight-loss education (GWL+SWA). Data were collected in 2008-2009. Weight loss was the primary outcome. Total costs, costs per participant, costs per kilogram lost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated in 2010-2011. All costs are the actual expenses (i.e., staff time and materials) incurred by the LEAN study (except where noted) and reported in 2010 U.S. dollars. In the sample population of 197 sedentary, overweight, and obese adults (mean [Â±SD] age=46.9 Â± 0.8 years, BMI=33.3 Â± 5.2, weight=92.8 Â± 18.4 kg), the GWL+SWA was the most expensive intervention in costs/participant ($365/partic) while yielding the greatest weight loss/partic (6.59 kg). The GWL was next in cost/partic ($240), but the SWA was less expensive in cost/partic ($183) and more efficacious (3.55 vs 1.86 kg/partic). The SC did not achieve significant weight loss. The SWA was the most cost effective ($51/partic/kg lost), followed by the GWL+SWA ($55) and GWL alone ($129). The ICER suggests that for each additional kilogram lost, the GWL+SWA cost $60 more than the SWA alone. The SWA was the most cost-effective intervention ($51/partic/kg lost). The addition of the GWL increased the efficacy of the SWA intervention but increased costs by $60/partic for each additional kilogram lost. The technology-based approaches were more cost effective and efficacious than traditional approaches in promoting weight loss via lifestyle changes in\n\nPhysical activity monitoring in stroke: SenseWear Pro2 activity accelerometer versus Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200 pedometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanroy, Christel; Vissers, Dirk; Cras, Patrick; Beyne, Saskia; Feys, Hilde; Vanlandewijck, Yves; Truijen, Steven\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDetermine validity and reliability of SenseWear Pro2 Armband (SWP2A) and Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200 Pedometer (YDWP) in stroke and healthy adults. Fifteen stroke patients and 15 healthy participants wore SWP2A on upper arm and YDWP at hip/knee. Different activities were performed: treadmill walking, walking up/down a step, cycling and walking on an even surface. Steps and Energy Expenditure (EE) were measured and compared to steps counted manually and indirect calorimetry. Repeated measurements were compared to determine reliability of both devices. Spearman correlation coefficients between knee-worn YDWP and counted steps while walking on an even surface was â¥0.89 in healthy and â¥0.95 in stroke. Treadmill walking revealed high Spearman correlation coefficients in healthy individuals (rsââ¥â0.90) and at 1.5âkm/h in stroke (rsâ=â0.69). During other activities YDWP often underestimated steps. SWP2A data revealed inconsistent results in EE and steps. Reliability tested by repeated measurements varied between 0.66 and 0.98 for YDWP and 0.61 and 0.97 for SWP2A. YDWP and SWP2A are both reliable. Only knee-worn YDWP is a valid device to measure steps except high intensity walking in stroke. YDWP systematically undercounts steps during other activities of short duration. This study could not demonstrate valid measurement of steps/EE in stroke using SWP2A. Implications for Rehabilitation Stroke is a disabling disease with residual neurologic deficits, which impairs mobility and predisposes them to sedentary behavior. A Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200 knee-worn pedometer showed to be a valid and reliable technique to measure ambulatory activity in stroke. A valid instrument to measure energy expenditure in stroke needs to be explored.\n\nBias in food intake reporting in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: the role of body size, age and gender.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaffeis, Claudio; Schutz, Yves; Fornari, Elena; Marigliano, Marco; Tomasselli, Francesca; Tommasi, Mara; Chini, Veronica; Morandi, Anita\n\n2017-05-01\n\nAn assessment of total daily energy intake is helpful in planning the overall treatment of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, energy intake misreporting may hinder nutritional intervention. To assess the plausibility of energy intake reporting and the potential role of gender, body mass index (BMI) z-score (z-BMI), disease duration and insulin requirement in energy intake misreporting in a sample of children and adolescents with T1D. The study included 58 children and adolescents aged 8-16âyr with T1D. Anthropometry, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured. Subjects were instructed to wear a SenseWear Pro Armband (SWA) for 3 consecutive days, including a weekend day and to fill out with their parents a weighed dietary record for the same days. Predicted energy expenditure (pEE) was calculated by age and gender specific equations, including gender, age, weight, height and physical activity level (assessed by SWA). The percent reported energy intake (rEI)/pEE ratio was used as an estimate of the plausibility of dietary reporting. Misreporting of food intake, especially under-reporting, was common in children and adolescents with T1D: more than one-third of participants were classified as under-reporters and 10% as over-reporters. Age, z-BMI and male gender were associated with the risk of under-reporting (model R 2 â=â0.5). Waist circumference was negatively associated with the risk of over-reporting (model R 2 â=â0.25). Children and adolescents with T1D frequently under-report their food intake. Age, gender and z-BMI contribute to identify potential under-reporters. Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In vitro, auxilin function requires its ability to bind clathrin and stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity via its J-domain. To test these requirements in vivo, we performed a mutational analysis of Swa2p, the yeast auxilin ortholog. Swa2p is a modular protein with three N-terminal clathrin-binding (CB) motifs, a ubiquitin association (UBA) domain, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and a C-terminal J-domain. In vitro, clathrin binding is mediated by multiple weak interactions, but a Swa2p truncation lacking two CB motifs and the UBA domain retains nearly full function in vivo. Deletion of all CB motifs strongly abrogates clathrin disassembly but does not eliminate Swa2p function in vivo. Surprisingly, mutation of the invariant HPD motif within the J-domain to AAA only partially affects Swa2p function. Similarly, a TPR point mutation (G388R) causes a modest phenotype. However, Swa2p function is abolished when these TPR and J mutations are combined. The TPR and J-domains are not functionally redundant because deletion of either domain renders Swa2p nonfunctional. These data suggest that the TPR and J-domains collaborate in a bipartite interaction with Hsp70 to regulate its activity in clathrin disassembly.

Eight elite female soccer players wore SenseWear Mini Armbands (SWAs) for 7 consecutive days during the preseason phase of a national league competition. In addition, players wore 15-Hz GPSports tracking devices during 4 training sessions and a friendly game. Total energy expenditure, exercise energy expenditure, and training and game demands were collected from the SWA and GPSports devices. Mean daily energy expenditure for the game day, training days, and rest days were 12,242 kJ (SD = 603 kJ), 11,692 (SD = 274 kJ), and 9,516 (SD = 369 kJ), respectively, with significant differences shown between activities (p < 0.001, partial Î·2 = 0.357), as well as between individual days (p < 0.001, partial Î·2 = 0.517). Mean values for energy expenditure during the friendly game (mean = 2,695 kJ, SD = 301 kJ) and training sessions (mean = 2,538 kJ, SD = 316 kJ) were similar (p = 0.278, Cohen's d = 0.5). However, there were significant differences found between individual training sessions (p = 0.001-0.035). Total and exercise energy expenditure differs throughout the week in female soccer players. Nutritional intake should be adjusted accordingly to avoid energy imbalances for optimal performance and recovery.\n\nA Mobile Phone App for Dietary Intake Assessment in Adolescents: An Evaluation Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSvensson, Ã sa\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground There is a great need for dietary assessment methods that suit the adolescent lifestyle and give valid intake data. Objective To develop a mobile phone app and evaluate its ability to assess energy intake (EI) and total energy expenditure (TEE) compared with objectively measured TEE. Furthermore, to investigate the impact of factors on reporting accuracy of EI, and to compare dietary intake with a Web-based method. Methods Participants 14 to 16 years of age were recruited from year nine in schools in Gothenburg, Sweden. In total, 81 adolescents used the mobile phone app over 1 to 6 days. TEE was measured with the SenseWear Armband (SWA) during the same or proximate days. Individual factors were assessed with a questionnaire. A total of 15 participants also recorded dietary intake using a Web-based method. Results The mobile phone app underestimated EI by 29% on a group level (P<.001) compared to TEE measured with the SWA, and there was no significant correlation between EI and TEE. Accuracy of EI relative to TEE increased with a weekend day in the record (P=.007) and lower BMI z-score (P=.001). TEE assessed with the mobile phone app was 1.19 times the value of TEE measured by the SWA on a group level (P<.001), and the correlation between the methods was .75 (P<.001). Analysis of physical activity levels (PAL) from the mobile phone app stratified by gender showed that accuracy of the mobile phone app was higher among boys. EI, nutrients, and food groups assessed with the mobile phone app and Web-based method among 15 participants were not significantly different and several were significantly correlated, but strong conclusions cannot be drawn due to the low number of participants.

To comprehensively assess such prionâspecific requirements for the propagation of the [URE 3] prion variant [URE 3â1], we screened 12 yeast cytosolic Jâproteins, and here we report a novel role for the Jâprotein Swa2/Aux1. Swa2 is the sole yeast homolog of the mammalian protein auxilin, which, like Swa2, functions in vesicleâmediated endocytosis by disassembling the structural lattice formed by the protein clathrin. We found that, in addition to Sis1, [URE 3â1] is specifically dependent upon Swa2, but not on any of the 11 other Jâproteins. Further, we show that [URE 3â1] propagation requires both a functional Jâdomain and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, but surprisingly does not require Swa2âclathrin binding. Because the Jâdomain of Swa2 can be replaced with the Jâdomains of other proteins, our data strongly suggest that prionâchaperone specificity arises from the Swa2 TPR domain and supports a model where Swa2 acts through Hsp70, most likely to provide additional access points for Hsp104 to promote prion template generation.

However, coincidence processing required to filter raw photon counts is computationally expensive, generally requiring significant size, weight, and power (SWaP) and also time. In this paper, we describe a laboratory test-bed developed to assess the feasibility of low-SWaP, real-time processing for 3D FMV based on Geiger-mode lidar. First, we examine a design based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and demonstrate proof-of-concept results. Then we examine a design based on a first-of-its-kind embedded graphical processing unit (GPU) and compare performance with the FPGA. Results indicate feasibility of real-time Geiger-mode lidar processing for 3D FMV and also suggest utility for real-time onboard processing for mapping lidar systems.\n\nLow validity of the Sensewear Pro3 activity monitor compared to indirect calorimetry during simulated free living in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground To validate physical activity estimates by the Sensewear Pro3 activity monitor compared with indirect calorimetry during simulated free living in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the hip pre or post total hip arthroplasty. Methods Twenty patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis (10 pre- and 10 post total hip arthroplasty; 40% female; age: 63.3âÂ±â9.0; BMI: 23.7âÂ±â3.7). All patients completed a 2Â hour protocol of simulated free living with 8 different typical physical activity types. Energy consumption (kcal/min) was estimated by the Sense Wear pro3 Armband activity monitor and validated against indirect calorimetry (criterion method) by means of a portable unit (Cosmed K4b2). Bias and variance was analyzed using functional ANOVA. Results Mean bias during all activities was 1.5 Kcal/min 95%CI [1.3; 1.8] corresponding to 72% (overestimation). Normal gait speed showed an overestimation of 2.8 Kcal/min, 95%CI [2.3; 3.3] (93%) while an underestimation of -1.1 Kcal/min, 95%CI [-1.8; -0.3] (-25%) was recorded during stair climb. Activities dominated by upper body movements showed large overestimation with 4.37 Kcal/min, 95%CI [3.8; 5.1] (170%) being recorded during gardening. Both bias and variance appeared to be dependent on activity type. Conclusion The activity monitor generally overestimated the energy consumption during common activities of low to medium intensity in the patient group. The size and direction of the bias was highly dependent on the activity type which indicates the activity monitor is of limited value in patients with hip osteoarthritis and that the results do not express the real energy expenditure.

Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of electron transfer irreversibility in ferruginous smectite, SWa-1.\n\nPubMed\n\nGorski, Christopher A; KlÃ¼pfel, Laura; Voegelin, Andreas; Sander, Michael; Hofstetter, Thomas B\n\n2012-09-04\n\nStructural Fe in clay minerals is an important, albeit poorly characterized, redox-active phase found in many natural and engineered environments. This work develops an experimental approach to directly assess the redox properties of a natural Fe-bearing smectite (ferruginous smectite, SWa-1, 12.6 wt % Fe) with mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) and oxidation (MEO). By utilizing a suite of one-electron-transfer mediating compounds to facilitate electron transfer between structural Fe in SWa-1 and a working electrode, we show that the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple in SWa-1 is redox-active over a large range of potentials (from E(H) = -0.63 V to +0.61 V vs SHE). Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses of SWa-1 samples that were subject to reduction and re-oxidation cycling revealed both reversible and irreversible structural Fe rearrangements that altered the observed apparent standard reduction potential (E(H)(Ã¸)) of structural Fe. E(H)(Ã¸)-values vary by as much as 0.56 V between SWa-1 samples with different redox histories. The wide range of E(H)-values over which SWa-1 is redox-active and redox history-dependent E(H)(Ã¸)-values underscore the importance of Fe-bearing clay minerals as redox-active phases in a wide range of redox regimes.\n\nEnergy expenditure while playing active and inactive video games.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeatherdale, Scott T; Woodruff, Sarah J; Manske, Stephen R\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTo examine energy expenditure (EE) when playing active and inactive videogames (VG).

Predicted EE was significantly higher playing the active VG compared to the inactive VG according to heart rate monitor (97.4 kcal vs 64.7 kcal) and SenseWear armband (192.4 kcal vs 42.3 kcal) estimates. Active VG may be a viable intervention tool for increasing EE among students who would otherwise be spending time in sedentary screen-based behaviors.\n\nReducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) of Perception Systems in Small Autonomous Aerial Systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJones, Kennie H.; Gross, Jason\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe objectives are to examine recent trends in the reduction of size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements of sensor systems for environmental perception and to explore new technology that may overcome limitations in current systems. Improving perception systems to facilitate situation awareness is critical in the move to introduce increasing autonomy in aerial systems. Whether the autonomy is in the current state-of-the-art of increasing automation or is enabling cognitive decisions that facilitate adaptive behavior, collection of environmental information and fusion of that information into knowledge that can direct actuation is imperative to decisions resulting in appropriate behavior. Artificial sensory systems such as cameras, radar, LIDAR, and acoustic sensors have been in use on aircraft for many years but, due to the large size and weight of the airplane and electrical power made available through powerful engines, the SWaP requirements of these sensors was inconsequential. With the proliferation of Remote Piloted Vehicles (RPV), the trend is in significant reduction in SWaP of the vehicles. This requires at least an equivalent reduction in SWaP for the sensory systems. A survey of some currently available sensor systems and changing technology will reveal the trend toward reduction of SWaP of these systems and will predict future reductions. A new technology will be introduced that provides an example of a desirable new trend. A new device replaces multiple conventional sensory devices facilitating synchronization, localization, altimetry, collision avoidance, terrain mapping, and data communication in a single integrated, small form-factor, extremely lightweight, and low power device that it is practical for integration into small autonomous vehicles and can facilitate cooperative behavior. The technology is based on Ultra WideBand (UWB) radio using short pulses of energy rather than continuous sine waves. The characteristics of UWB yield several\n\nEnergy expenditure during competitive Latin American dancing simulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMassidda, Myosotis; Cugusi, Lucia; Ibba, Maurizio; Tradori, Iosto; CalÃ², Carla Maria\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe aims of this study were to estimate the energy expenditure (EE) and the intensity of physical activity (PA) during a competitive simulation of Latin American dancing and to evaluate the differences in PA and EE values between the sexes, between different dance types, and between the various phases of the competition. Ten Italian dancers (five couples, 5 males and 5 females) competing in Latin American dancing at the international level were examined in this study. The EE (kcal) was measured during the semifinal and final phases of the competition using the SenseWear Pro Armband (SWA). Paired-sample t-tests were used to determine differences in the metabolic equivalent (MET) and EE values between the semifinal and final phases and between each dance. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences in the MET and EE values between the sexes. The intensity of PA during the dance sequence ranged from moderate (3 to 6 METs) to vigorous (6 to 9 METs). The male dancers had higher EE values than the female dancers during all phases of the simulation. Similar MET values were observed in both sexes. The PA intensity during the finals phase was vigorous for 56% of the time of dance. Of all the dance styles, the rumba had the lowest MET and EE values. Our results demonstrate that competitive Latin American dancing is a heavy exercise and suggest that monitoring variables during normal training can improve training protocols and the dancers' fitness levels.\n\nDevelopment of low-SWaP and low-noise InGaAs detectors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFraenkel, R.; Berkowicz, E.; Bikov, L.; Elishkov, R.; Giladi, A.; Hirsh, I.; Ilan, E.; Jakobson, C.; Kondrashov, P.; Louzon, E.; Nevo, I.; Pivnik, I.; Tuito, A.; Vasserman, S.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIn recent years SCD has developed InGaAs/InP technology for Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging. The first product, Cardinal 640, has a 640Ã512 (VGA) format at 15Î¼m pitch, and more than two thousand units have already been delivered to customers. Recently we have also introduced Cardinal 1280 which is an SXGA array with 10Î¼m pitch aimed for long-range high end platforms [1]. One of the big challenges facing the SWIR technology is its proliferation to widespread low cost and low SWaP applications, specifically Low Light Level (LLL) and Image Intensifier (II) replacements. In order to achieve this goal we have invested and combined efforts in several design and development directions: 1. Optimization of the InGaAs pixel array, reducing the dark current below 2fA at 20Â° C in order to save TEC cooling power under harsh light and environmental conditions. 2. Design of a new \"Low Noise\" ROIC targeting 15e noise floor and improved active imaging capabilities 3. Design of compact, low SWaP and low cost packages. In this context we have developed 2 types of packages: a non-hermetic package with thermo-electric cooler (TEC) and a hermetic TEC-Less ceramic package. 4. Development of efficient TEC-Less algorithms for optimal imaging at both day-light and low light level conditions. The result of these combined efforts is a compact low SWaP detector that provides equivalent performance to Gen III image intensifier under starlight conditions. In this paper we will present results from lab and field experiments that will support this claim.\n\nStep Detection and Activity Recognition Accuracy of Seven Physical Activity Monitors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStorm, Fabio A.; Heller, Ben W.; MazzÃ , Claudia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the seven following commercially available activity monitors in terms of step count detection accuracy: Movemonitor (Mc Roberts), Up (Jawbone), One (Fitbit), ActivPAL (PAL Technologies Ltd.), Nike+ Fuelband (Nike Inc.), Tractivity (Kineteks Corp.) and Sensewear Armband Mini (Bodymedia). Sixteen healthy adults consented to take part in the study. The experimental protocol included walking along an indoor straight walkway, descending and ascending 24 steps, free outdoor walking and free indoor walking. These tasks were repeated at three self-selected walking speeds. Angular velocity signals collected at both shanks using two wireless inertial measurement units (OPAL, ADPM Inc) were used as a reference for the step count, computed using previously validated algorithms. Step detection accuracy was assessed using the mean absolute percentage error computed for each sensor. The Movemonitor and the ActivPAL were also tested within a nine-minute activity recognition protocol, during which the participants performed a set of complex tasks. Posture classifications were obtained from the two monitors and expressed as a percentage of the total task duration. The Movemonitor, One, ActivPAL, Nike+ Fuelband and Sensewear Armband Mini underestimated the number of steps in all the observed walking speeds, whereas the Tractivity significantly overestimated step count. The Movemonitor was the best performing sensor, with an error lower than 2% at all speeds and the smallest error obtained in the outdoor walking. The activity recognition protocol showed that the Movemonitor performed best in the walking recognition, but had difficulty in discriminating between standing and sitting. Results of this study can be used to inform choice of a monitor for specific applications.

Sixteen healthy adults consented to take part in the study. The experimental protocol included walking along an indoor straight walkway, descending and ascending 24 steps, free outdoor walking and free indoor walking. These tasks were repeated at three self-selected walking speeds. Angular velocity signals collected at both shanks using two wireless inertial measurement units (OPAL, ADPM Inc) were used as a reference for the step count, computed using previously validated algorithms. Step detection accuracy was assessed using the mean absolute percentage error computed for each sensor. The Movemonitor and the ActivPAL were also tested within a nine-minute activity recognition protocol, during which the participants performed a set of complex tasks. Posture classifications were obtained from the two monitors and expressed as a percentage of the total task duration. The Movemonitor, One, ActivPAL, Nike+ Fuelband and Sensewear Armband Mini underestimated the number of steps in all the observed walking speeds, whereas the Tractivity significantly overestimated step count. The Movemonitor was the best performing sensor, with an error lower than 2% at all speeds and the smallest error obtained in the outdoor walking. The activity recognition protocol showed that the Movemonitor performed best in the walking recognition, but had difficulty in discriminating between standing and sitting.

Laboratory-based validation study. 57 children aged 5-12 y completed a protocol involving 15 semi-structured sedentary (SED), light-intensity (LPA), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity (MVPA) physical activities. EE was estimated using portable indirect calorimetry (IC). The accuracy of EE estimates (kcalÂ·min -1 ) from SW2.2 and SW5.2 were examined at the group level and individual level using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Bland-Altman plots and equivalence testing. MAPE values were lower for SW5.2 (30.1Â±10.7%) than for SW2.2 (44.0Â±6.2%). Although mean differences for SW5.2 were smaller than for SW2.2 during SED (-0.23Â±0.22 vs. -0.61Â±0.20kcalÂ·min -1 ), LPA (-0.69Â±0.76 vs. -1.07Â±0.46kcalÂ·min -1 ) and MVPA (-2.22Â±1.15 vs. -2.57Â±1.15kcalÂ·min -1 ), limits of agreement did not decrease for the updated algorithms. For all activities, SW2.2 and SW5.2 were not equivalent to IC (p>0.05). Errors increased with increasing intensity. The current SenseWear Mini algorithms SW5.2 underestimated EE. The overall improved accuracy for SW5.2 was not accompanied with improved accuracy at the individual level and EE estimates were not equivalent to IC. Copyright Â© 2016 Sports Medicine Australia.

As the challenges of low-k1 imaging continue to grow in scope of designs and in absolute complexity, the inevitable partnership between wafer lithographers and mask makers has strengthened as well. This is reflected in the jointly owned mask facilities and device manufacturers' continued maintenance of fully captive mask shops which foster the closer mask-litho relationships. However, while some device manufacturers have leveraged this to optimize mask specifications before the mask is built and, therefore, improve mask yield and cost, the opportunity for post-fabrication partnering on mask characterization is more apparent and compelling. The Advanced Mask Technology Center (AMTC) has been investigating the concept of assessing how a mask images, rather than the mask's physical attributes, as a technically superior and lower-cost method to characterize a mask. The idea of printing a mask under its intended imaging conditions, then characterizing the imaged wafer as a surrogate for traditional mask inspections and measurements represents the ultimate method to characterize a mask's performance, which is most meaningful to the user. Surrogate wafer print (SWaP) is already done as part of leading-edge wafer fab mask qualification to validate defect and dimensional performance. In the past, the prospect of executing this concept has generally been summarily discarded as technically untenable and logistically intractable. The AMTC published a paper at BACUS 2007 successfully demonstrating the performance of SWaP for the characterization of defects as an alternative to traditional mask inspection [1]. It showed that this concept is not only feasible, but, in some cases, desirable. This paper expands on last year's work at AMTC to assess the full implementation of SWaP as an\n\nHigh-performance, event-driven, low-cost, and SWaP imaging sensor for hostile fire detection, homeland protection, and border security\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRizk, Charbel G.; Lin, Joseph H.; Kennerly, Stephen W.; Pouliquen, Philippe; Goldberg, Arnold C.; Andreou, Andreas G.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe advanced imagers team at JHU APL and ECE has been advocating and developing a new class of sensor systems that address key system level performance bottlenecks but are sufficiently flexible to allow optimization of associated"
