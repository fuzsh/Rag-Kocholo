        "text": "WROCLAW, POLAND — Richard Schechner and Philip Arnoult, longstanding members of American theater’s avant-garde, chatted on the crowded staircase of The Centre for Study of Jerzy Grotowski’s Work and for Cultural and Theatrical Research as they waited in line for the final performance of Teatr Zar, an ensemble group that works and performs in the third-floor, red-brick room that was Grotowski’s workspace. „\n\n“Want to hear a Polish actor joke?” asked Mr. Arnoult, who first came here to see the legendary theater director and thinker Jerzy Grotowksi at work in 1975.\n\n“Not here!” stage-whispered Mr. Schechner, whose theater magazine TDR: The Drama Review was the first and most prolific publisher of Grotowski’s writings in the United States.\n\n“O.K.,” said Mr. Arnoult, undaunted.\n\n“Two Polish actors drink a bottle of vodka. ‘Could you still play?’ says one to the other. ‘Sure,’ he says. They drink another. ‘Could you still play?’ ‘Sure.’ They drink a third bottle. The first actor asks the second, ‘Could you play now?’ ‘No,’ he says. ‘But I could direct.”’\n\nIdeas about directing — including Mr. Schechner’s rebuttal that the joke should be the other way around, with three bottles of vodka and two directors — are in no short supply at the events marking the 10-year anniversary of Grotowski’s death. Grotowski developed the concept of the “poor theater” — theater that has been stripped down to its most essential parts — such that the actor does not act so much as reveal truth. As part of The Grotowski Year, performances, lectures, panel discussions, film screenings, book promotions, workshops, and exhibitions are taking place all year long around the world.\n\nHere in the small city of Wroclaw, Poland, where Grotowski lived and worked from 1965 until he left Poland — then under martial law — in 1982, the highlight of The Grotowski Year was a festival that ran from June 14 to 30.\n\nCalled “The World as a Place of Truth,” the festival drew master directors like Roberto Bacci, Eugenio Barba, Peter Brook and Mr. Schechner, among others. Pina Bausch was also invited, but she died suddenly on July 30. All were staging performances and giving workshops and talks as part of the extensive program.\n\nWhile most, though not all, of the master directors here had some personal and professional connection to Grotowski, everyone is quick to say that the event is not about following the tradition of a man who eschewed imitators.\n\n“He used to say, to imitate me is not to follow me,” said Mr. Schechner.\n\nHe pointed out that the festival was showing three versions of “Hamlet,” including his own, performed largely in Mandarin by Chinese actors from the Shanghai Theatre Academy and American actors from East Coast Artists.\n\nThus the festival took place in Grotowski’s honor, not footsteps (“Hamlet,” after all, is a play about the son of the dead king who cannot or will not take the throne.)\n\n“We thought the best way to pay homage to a great master of world’s theater is to invite people who have been true to themselves,” said Joanna Klass, director of The Grotowski Year. “Who didn’t walk in his shoes, but excelled against all odds.”\n\n“I was not influenced in the theater, but in a personal way,” said Roberto Bacci, after the performance of his “Hamlet,” in which all the actors sported fencing gear. In 1986 Mr. Bacci invited Grotowski to his theater center in Pontedera, Italy. There, Grotowski founded his own “work center,” where he remained until his death. „“In the past years we talked about other things, personal things, political things. But not about theater.”\n\nFor Mr. Bacci’s young actors, who were steeped in Grotowski’s work but did not work directly with him, Wroclaw was inspiring. „“Being here, you feel that this is the place, like traveling back to the origin,” said the actress Serena Gatti, who played Ophelia. „“It’s a big emotion, to go to the room where he worked. It’s in the air.”\n\nOthers at the festival were getting an introduction to Grotowski for the first time. Ms. Klass brought 33 young American directors and actors from alternative theaters to the festival. For some, it was an eye-opening intercultural experience.\n\n„“They were saying to me, ‘Polish theater is so good,’ and I was like, ‘come on guys,”’ said Ms. Klass. „“People working in the U.S. are under very different conditions, I have a lot of respect for them. You don’t get money, you don’t get sex. In Poland, if you are a theater director, you are hot.”\n\nJames Sugg, of the Pig Iron Theater in Philadelphia, said he was impressed. „“We were like, ‘why are these Polish actors so good?’ We see companies here put a lot of soul and care into it in a way that, because of funding, we can’t. It’s frustrating, but it’s a good frustration.”\n\nBut Grotowski’s influence, said Mr. Arnoult, who founded the Baltimore-based Center for International Theater Development, makes itself felt on both sides of the Atlantic, whether younger theater-makers know it or not.\n\n“A 20-year-old doesn’t know his teacher’s mentor’s mentor had his world view shaped by experiencing this great man of the theater and seeker of truth.”\n\nOthers had their own agendas. Bekim Lumi, a theater director from Kosovo, who described theater-making as “very minimalist” by necessity in his economically troubled, postwar country, came with his digital camera.\n\n„“It was my dream to meet Richard Schechner and to take a photo with him,” said Mr. Lumi. „“As a student, I read his books. My country is very traditional, very conventional, and it’s hard work to bring about new thinking in theater.” „\n\n“I had no chance to work with Grotowski,” said Jaroslaw Fret, the director of the Grotowski Institute and leader of the Teatr Zar. „“I’m not generation A, not generation B, not C, but maybe D — like documents. If you want to learn something about Grotowski, don’t watch us.”\n\nMr. Arnoult, however, said he began working with Mr. Fret’s group 18 months ago because they practiced the same commitment to training, research-oriented approach, and long-gestating works that had attracted him 30-odd years ago in Grotowski’s Laboratory Theatre’s work. „“I think they’re dead-center in the tradition,” he said of Teatr Zar.\n\nAs Teatr Zar’s young performers took to the stage for the final festival performance of their triptych of pieces based on folk songs gathered during trips to Georgia, Greece, Bulgaria, Corsica, Sardinia, Egypt and Iran, those lucky enough to get a spot sat in silence on benches along the walls of the red brick room. The astute performers took the stage and the room reverberated with song. The audience was rapt.\n\nAfterwards, the audience filed out into a summer rainstorm. No matter what you called it, it was good."
