        "text": "This article is based on the broad network of interests established by Eugenio Barba in the first decade of ISTA with the world of science: a fertile, lively relationship with figures inside and outside the world of theatre. With the contribution of archival documents preserved in the Odin Teatret Archives, the article focuses on certain artistic and intellectual episodes that exemplify the relational dialectics of interpenetration, exercised in two opposing tensions (one of approach outwards, the other of attraction inwards), implemented by Barba in a vast knowledge-seeking project, unprecedented in the history of the theatre. It was also based on these premises that Barba promoted the concept of theatre anthropology as a plural, interdisciplinary and intercultural living discipline: a discipline founded on the study of human beings and the history of cultures, combining a purely humanistic approach with new research from the so-called hard sciences. The impact and wide range of interaction of theatre anthropology as a new subject in the field of knowledge subsequently gave rise, over following decades, to ample literature hosting a lively and constructive debate.\n\nThe paper focuses on the solo-performance \"An Ordinary Day of the Dancer Gregorio Samsa\" created by Eugenio Barba, Julia Varley and Lorenzo Gleijeses and performed since 2016. The pièce, which sees Gleijeses on stage as a solo performer, has followed an intense process of development over five years, through numerous rewriting processes. Partially inspired by Kafka’s \"Metamorphosis\", the performance deals with the difficult relationship between a young artist and his main reference figures (a demanding father, an authoritarian theatre director, a worried partner, a schematic psychologist). On stage, the actor’s score develops around an obsessive repetition of movements and actions, performed with modulation of intensity and rhythm. From the circularity of the theatrical repetitions, however, the work of the actor creates a more linear, perhaps vertical, path, which aims at self-purification through exhausting effort, at the precision of craftsmanship, and which, in the finale, questions the possibility of transcendence in the incompleteness of the artistic creation. The inexhaustible and essential search for a performative work based on the organic nature of the actor-dancer, explored as the quintessence of human existence, is therefore both a ‘condemnation’ and a possibility of elevation offered by the theatre performance. Sorrounded by a refined lighting and sound apparatus, the actor-dancer acts in a multi-sensorial context within which a new poetics of space unravels. Reflecting upon these elements, the paper intends to offer a reconstruction of the genesis and creative process of the performance, also comparing it with some of Barba’s previous works and theatrical thought.\n\nAnthropology of Performance or Anthropology of Contemporary Theatre?: ethnographic remarks on companhia brasileira de teatro and PROJETO bRASIL-Based on anthropological and ethno-graphical fieldwork research with companhia brasileira de teatro this article points to some limits of a universalist and orthodox anthropology of performance. It sustains, alternatively, one anthropology of contemporary theatre, dealing with concepts such as drama, performance and dramaturgy as research realms, able to express desires, expectancies, and meanings disputes enrolled in the artistic process. This study reveals how performative theatre, metadiscursive and de-dramatizing strategies lead to polysemic and reflexive scenes that provide critical discourses, viewpoints shifts and encourage sensibility for alterity. Keywords: Anthropology of Performance. Anthropology of Theater. Contemporary Dramaturgy. RÉSUMÉ-Anthropologie de la Performance ou Anthropologie du Théâtre contemporain?: considérations sur companhia brasileira de teatro et PROJETO bRASIL-A partir d'une recherche de terrain anthropologique et ethnographique avec companhia brasileira de teatro cet article démontre des limites de l'anthropologie de la performance de façon universaliste et orthodoxe. On propose, autrement, une anthropologie du téâtre contemporain considèrent des notions de drame, de performance et de dramaturgie comme des univers d'investigation capables d'exprimer des désirs, des aspirations et des disputes de sens dans le processus artistique. Cette étude démontre comme l'emploi du théâtre performatif et des stratégies métadiscursives et de dédramatisation ont résulté en des scènes polysémiques, réflexives et capables de soutenir des discours critiques, de changer des points de vue et de sensi-bilizer pour l'altérité. Mots-clés: Anthropologie de la Performance. Anthropologie du Théâtre. Dramaturgie Contemporaine. RESUMO-Antropologia da Performance ou Antropologia do Teatro Contemporâneo?: notas etnográficas a propósito da companhia brasileira de teatro e do PROJETO bRASIL-Tendo por base um trabalho an-tropológico e etnográfico junto à companhia brasileira de teatro, o presente artigo pretende apontar para os limites de uma antropologia da performance ortodoxa e universalizante. Propõe, alternativamente, uma antropologia do teatro contemporâneo tomando as noções de drama, performance e dramaturgia como universos investigativos capazes de apontar para desejos, expectativas e disputas de sentido envolvidas no processo artístico. O estudo demonstra como o uso do teatro performativo, de estratégias metadiscursivas e de desdramatização resultaram em cenas polissêmicas, reflexivas, capazes de promover discursos altamente críticos, suscitar a modificação de pontos de vista e sensibilizar para a alteridade. Palavras-chave: Antropologia da Performance. Antropologia do Teatro. Dramaturgia Contemporânea.\n\nThe article examines some of Eugenio Barba’s study material now preserved in the Fonds Barba at Odin Teatret Archives (ISTA Series, b. 1). Barba’s readings preceding the first edition of the ISTA in Bonn in 1980 trace the development of interests cultivated by the director, from humanities to science (biology, neuropsychology, studies of perception, posturology). Even before developing the theory of theatre anthropology as an autonomous discipline, Barba evolved many fertile perspectives of study on energy, within which he expanded the understanding of presence as a fundamental component of theatre. Barba’s reading notes reveal an intellectual approach similar to his artistic work: the accumulation of an overabundance of material, which in the theoretical sphere, too, invert the principle of maximum results with minimum effort. https://jta.ista-online.org/article/view/11\n\nThe article focuses on the possible relationships between cultural history and theater. In order to do so, it alludes to the different meanings that this art had in the West, especially from the point of view of the opposition between the dramatic text and the staging. A complex semiotic object, the theatrical phenomenon also encompasses the audience, which means that its historical narrative must encompass both sides of the scene. As a referral and exemplification of possible historiographical paths, three important titles by international playwrights, focused on questions of interpretive method, are examined: Marco\n\nTheater has been a focus of systematic investigation in anthropology since the 1970s. Because of its cross-cultural nature, theater has been of interdisciplinary interest to scholars employing ethnographic methods to analyze cultural meanings present in texts and embodied in rituals and in the social exchange of symbols between performers and audiences. Following the “affective turn” of the 1990s and under the influence of postcolonial critique, performance scholars and social scientists have begun to look at theater practices as processes of meaning making, political negotiation, and collabo- ration. Acknowledging theater’s immediacy in concentrating on what lies at the core k of what specific societies want to communicate about themselves, anthropologists have also used performances to communicate their fieldwork data in the form of ethnodramas. More recently, social research that has wished to privilege reflexivity and intersubjectivity has engaged with the actual practice of theatre making, to engage participants in active and ethical processes of knowledge production."
