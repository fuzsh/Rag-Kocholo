The practice-led observations query how methods emerge from systems and what this might mean to the training actor. The paper also refers to the Crosspoints Acting System, a project developed by the author as a way of blending System-based acting with the goals of contemporary theatre and film production.",

        "text": "I am a performer, director and acting teacher from Canada, who has been based for significant periods of time in Australia and the UK. For many years the Viewpoints have had a great impact on my work and on my approach to teaching actors. In this paper, I would like to share how my views of actor training were challenged by the Viewpoints and what new questions have emerged. Particularly, how the Viewpoints foregrounded the question, ‘Can acting even be systematised, and if so, how?’\n\nI’d like to start by explaining briefly that the Viewpoints are a system of lenses that help directors, choreographers, actors and other performers isolate a facet of performance. The gift they give the artist is to temporarily remove latent hierarchies and unconscious biases about the most ‘important’ aspect of performance. Observation of, and improvising with, each facet gives the artist a sense of what they personally prioritise in their work, either through their individual habituation or because of their aesthetic paradigm. Through observation, improvisation and creating compositions, the artist develops their relationship with each of these facets and finds freedom of choice with an increased vocabulary of practice. The work also has the power to subvert assumptions or animate the tropes of performance with new energy.\n\nMary Overlie developed the original iteration of the Viewpoints in the late 1970s. She proposed that deconstruction is essential to the creative process and that the hierarchies and taxonomies embedded in an art form can be dismantled and placed in a ‘horizontal relationship’ to each other. Overlie formulated six essential elements of performance and suggested their irreducible nature by resisting the addition of any more. Anne Bogart and Tina Landau saw the potential of Overlie’s work to create riveting, visceral movement for the stage and formulated nine viewpoints for movement as well as vocal viewpoints.\n\nWhat both types of Viewpoints training share is that their authors have made a list of components; the prime elements of performance which can be isolated and worked with separately. Similar to the way a sound technology allows one to isolate and adjust bass, treble, volume, etc; the Viewpoints are filters and lenses for the ‘materials’ of performance. The result is a vocabulary and set of practices that promote deep understanding, freedom and control over a performer’s choices in improvisation as well as in scripted or scored work.\n\nI have made Viewpoints training my preferred lens for developing a critical pedagogy of acting. The result has been a body of work combining my studio training in Meisner Technique, Michael Chekhov Technique and derivations of Stanislavksian and Grotowskian methods. The Vewpoints, as an epistemic principle, propose that the matrix of relationships between performance materials may be disentangled from each other, allowing us to see how they work outside paradigms and tropes. They allow us to question and retrieve how elements like tempo, repetition, scale and stillness impact a moment separately from the spoken text.\n\nThe Viewpoints direct the performer’s attention to the ephemeral components of performance which cannot be clearly communicated in words. Having been theorised in the context of postmodern interdisciplinary practice, they’re suited to contemporary writing which emphasises imagery and ‘montage’ over rationalistic, cause and effect, linear narrative.\n\nThe main thing that attracted me to the Viewpoints is the way they prioritise the performers’ interactions. Viewpoints contrast the analysis-forward process of table work by offering a ‘textless’ means to explore and externalise inner life and collaborate with an expanding spectrum of expressive elements. In film, for example, this might translate to the actor understanding how the motion of the camera creates narrative, or how an imaginary, physicalised image might convey story more effectively than inner psychological objects.\n\nReferences"
