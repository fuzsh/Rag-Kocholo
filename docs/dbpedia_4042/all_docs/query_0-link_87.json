This book collates a wealth of key material on Etienne Decroux, including: • • •\n\nAn English translation of Patrick Pezin’s ‘Imaginary Interview’, in which Decroux discusses mime’s place in the theatre. Previously unpublished articles by Decroux from France’s Bibliothèque Nationale. Essays from Decroux’s fellow innovators Eugenio Barba and Edward Gordon Craig, explaining the synthesis of theory and practice in his work.\n\nEtienne Decroux’s pioneering work in physical theatre is here richly illustrated not only by a library of source material, but also with a gallery of images following his life, work and influences. The Decroux Sourcebook is an ideal companion to Thomas Leabhart’s Etienne Decroux in the Routledge Performance Practitioners series, offering key primary and secondary resources to those conducting research at all levels. Thomas Leabhart is an actor, director, writer and teacher who worked and studied with Etienne Decroux and performed under his direction. He is editor of the Mime Journal, and has published numerous articles on mime and theatre, as well as two books: Modern and Post-Modern Mime (Macmillan, 1989) and Etienne Decroux (Routledge, 2007). Franc Chamberlain teaches Drama and Theatre Studies at University College Cork, Ireland, and is Visiting Professor in Performance Studies and Creative Practice at the University of Northampton, UK. He is the author of Michael Chekhov (Routledge, 2004) and coeditor of Jacques Lecoq and the British Theatre (Routledge, 2001).\n\nDecroux-00-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:50\n\nPage ii\n\nDecroux-00-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:50\n\nPage iii\n\nThe Decroux Sourcebook\n\n\n\nEdited by Thomas Leabhart and Franc Chamberlain\n\nDecroux-00-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:50\n\nPage iv\n\nFirst published 2008 by Routledge 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 4RN Simultaneously published in the USA and Canada by Routledge 270 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016 Routledge is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an informa business Collection and Editorial Matter © 2009 Franc Chamberlain and Thomas Leabhart Individual chapters © 2009 the contributors Typeset in Sabon by Keystroke, 28 High Street, Tettenhall, Wolverhampton Printed and bound in Great Britain by CPI Antony Rowe, Chippenham, Wiltshire All rights reserved.

Whereas the West’s classical dance has a history of nearly four centuries, Corporeal Mime was created in the twentieth century. Etienne Decroux (1898–1991), the founder and creator of this living tradition, taught for six decades. Many of his students still practise and teach his work which subverts the prevailing paradigm: text-based theatre.1 Decroux himself (although a brilliant speaker and lapidary prose craftsman) encouraged among his students a healthy scepticism towards speaking or writing about things one could not do. He believed that until the word was made flesh, it was only so much hot air. He disdained intellectuals and others who were ‘sitting down’, in contrast to the Corporeal Mime who preferred to stand. He might have cautioned us against putting things into words lest people believe that the words alone could lead to understanding. And he would have defended his discoveries against people writing about them who had no practical knowledge of his intentions. 1\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 2\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nYet despite the militantly non-verbal aspects of Decroux’s work, these words by and about him form an essential part of his legacy. ‘The Imaginary Interview’, compiled by Patrick Pezin (pp. 61–160), organizes a collage of tape-recorded interviews and lectures, given by Decroux over a twenty-year period, around major themes: mime and dance, mime and puppets, mime and mask, etc. This material, made available here in English, was published in French in 2003 in a collection edited by Pezin. We also include previously unpublished articles by Decroux, archived in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. These articles reveal more of Decroux’s wit, his unfailing conviction and his intellectual rigour. In addition to these new words by Decroux, we include two important essays about him, one by Edward Gordon Craig, the other by Eugenio Barba. Craig and Barba both knew Decroux (thirty years apart), and although not his students, they were deeply impressed by his new/old approach to theatre. When others who had not worked with him tried to write about Decroux, they often got it wrong. Never having done the physical work, they could not grasp his metaphysical, political or moral stance. Reducing him to yet one more twentiethcentury intellectual ignores his monumental contribution as a theatre practitioner and innovator of a new theatrical vocabulary. Both Craig and Barba, themselves considerable innovators, intuited that Decroux’s mostly non-verbal work was not primarily theoretical but instead an inseparable blend of theory and practice. Decroux’s world view, strangely inaccessible to scholars who have never put their bodies into his shapes, requires a kind of kinaesthetic literacy which often runs counter to and even contradicts scholarly literacy, at least as we know it in most Western universities. Craig and Barba, however, made the intuitive leap.\n\nHistory and future of Corporeal Mime Etienne Decroux, born of working-class parents, became interested in politics, and, at age twenty-five, took a year off from his work as a manual labourer to study voice and diction as a 2\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 3\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nway of furthering his political aspirations. He happened upon a class at Jacques Copeau’s Ecole du Vieux-Colombier, where he quickly became enamoured with body work taught there: masked improvisation, Noh theatre, ballet, acrobatics and so on. His new political party became the theatre, more precisely his own developing vision of an artistic (artificial and articulated) theatre with a newly conceived actor at its centre; Decroux took Copeau’s purism (bare stage) a step further (a nearly nude actor on a bare stage) and Corporeal Mime developed in that rarefied environment. Decroux reimagined the human body in an abstracted and systematic way without precedent, starting with what ballet had devised for legs and feet, and adding on rich possibilities obtained by articulating, in three dimensions, the trunk. As twentieth-century scientists sought the smallest particles of matter – cells and atoms – Decroux found the smallest articulations of the human keyboard. While the aesthetics might owe something to the ancient Noh, the mechanics were cubistically cutting edge. While most people associate mime and pantomime (terms used sometimes today interchangeably, and throughout history variably) with silent storytelling, much of what one called mime or pantomime in the ancient world and for hundreds of years afterwards was seldom silent; often a chorus accompanied, or the mime performer himself spoke or sang. During brief periods (usually due to governmental restriction, as during the time of Louis XIV, or in nineteenth-century France) mime was exclusively silent; yet these gave rise to the misconception, still commonly held, that mime is silent storytelling. Decroux reacted strongly to these notions as he created a new form, Corporeal Mime, which de-emphasized face and hands and focused on the actor’s trunk. His new mime marked a break from nineteenth-century pantomime, in whose silenced theatres the exercise became: what can I say without words? Decroux, who detested this kind of guessing game, often said, ‘If you have something to say, why not just come out and say it?’ He never imagined his ideal theatre should remain silent forever, but simply until the actor took control from directors, playwrights and other ‘colonizers’ of the theatre (Decroux 1985, 23–7). 3\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 4\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nFigure 1 The French pantomime Séverin (1863–1930) represents the kind of silent performance Decroux saw as a child, and about which he wrote: About the same time [1909, when Decroux was eleven], I saw a Pierrot who told his audience, without words, the tale of his love, his misfortune, his crime and his punishment. The speaking actor is less garrulous. This displeased me. (Decroux 1985, 14)\n\nA contemporary article describes Séverin’s performance, as Pierrot, in a four-act pantomime entitled ‘Conscience’: ‘Throughout the entire performance not a word is spoken, music alone being relied upon to help reveal the pantomimist’s emotions’ (New York Times, 22 December 1908). Decroux reversed this paradigm. He exchanged the completely covered body for an almost nude one; the emphasis on expressive face and hands replaced by inexpressive face and hands which neither promised nor threatened; the emphasis on plot for an almost plot-less performance, where causality could replace story line; and dim footlights exchanged for bright light from above. If mime performers may speak, one might ask, how do they differ from ordinary actors? Again, painting with a broad brush, mimes have historically created their own verbal and 4\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 5\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nnon-verbal texts, and not been subject to directors or playwrights. Decroux often said that plays should be performed first and written later, giving most power to actors, shifting it from a sedentary individual (the playwright) and giving it instead to an active group (the actors). When thinking about the history of Corporeal Mime, we are considering something less than a century old, as Decroux laid most of the groundwork in the 1930s and continued developing it through the 1980s. With hindsight, Corporeal Mime may turn out to be (on one end of the spectrum) a figment of that one man’s maniacal imagination, or (on the other end) the beginning of a new theatre form – or something in between. Only time will tell if Decroux fills the role of a twentieth-century Zeami, as Kathryn Wylie-Marques suggests: Like Zeami, Decroux was intent on creating a mime based on elegance, inner beauty, and truth; for him, this meant fidelity to the laws of kinetic geometry applied to the moving body. (Wylie-Marques 1998, 115) Decroux, obsessed with Corporeal Mime’s uncertain future, often wondered aloud in his now-legendary Friday evening lectures if it would survive in the way he hoped. He knew that anything ‘new’ ran the risk of becoming assimilated by the prevailing paradigms. Perhaps that’s why he went to such pains to distinguish Corporeal Mime from nineteenthcentury pantomime, from dance, from speaking theatre and from cinema. Inspired by his studies with Copeau, Suzanne Bing and others at the Vieux-Colombier, and by a collaboration with Jean-Louis Barrault, Decroux reimagined the human body in a musically analytical way, breaking it down into a keyboard that could, he hoped, play any melody the actor imagined. Through a distaste for silent pantomime, he developed a project much more aligned with that of his contemporary, Artaud, who wrote that: the theatre as I conceive it, 5\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 6\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\n[is] a theatre of blood, a theatre which, with each performance will have done something bodily to the one who performs as well as to the one who comes to see others perform, but actually the actors are not performing, they are doing. [second emphasis added] (Artaud 1988, 585) In her kitchen, Madame Decroux once said something remarkably similar: ‘The Corporeal Mime does not pretend, he does.’ (The word in French for ‘pretend’ is faire semblant, which makes the citation more pungent: ‘Le mime ne fait pas semblant, il fait.’) Decroux’s project recognized that creating illusions limited both actor and audience in a trite world of predictable vignettes. Like Grotowski, Decroux wanted to touch the audience deeply rather than simply entertain them. This reminds one of Grotowski’s description (in a lecture at Eugenio Barba’s International School of Theatre Anthropology in Copenhagen in 1995) of the principle of induction, whereby an electrical wire, attached to an energy source, runs parallel to another unattached wire in which one can detect a lesser energy; in the same way a receptive (Grotowski’s word was ‘unblocked’) audience can absorb a measure of energy from actors who are charged through their technique and rehearsal process. (The relevant Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of induction: ‘The action of inducting or bringing about an electric or magnetic state in a body by the proximity [without actual contact] of an electrified or magnetized body.’) So the emphasis shifts from ‘what’ (what is the performer doing?) to ‘how’ (is the performer, in Artaud’s words, doing something bodily which changes – electrifies or magnetizes – himself and those who witness it?). Artaud would have called nineteenth-century white-faced pantomime ‘corrupted’ pantomime as the gestures represent words. He preferred ‘pantomime which has not been corrupted’:\n\n6\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 7\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nBy ‘pantomime which has not been corrupted’ I mean direct Pantomime in which the gestures – instead of representing words or sentences as in our European pantomime, which is only fifty years old and which is merely a distortion of the silent parts of Italian commedia – represent ideas, mental attitudes, aspects of natural objects or details. . . . [. . .] This language, which evokes in the mind images of an intense natural (or spiritual) poetry, gives an idea of what it might mean for the theatre to have a poetry of space independent of spoken language. (Artaud 1988, 233) Decroux would call Artaud’s ‘poetry of space’ Corporeal Mime, which bore more resemblance to cubism, surrealism, collage and abstract expressionism than to charmingly decorative nineteenth-century pantomime. Decroux’s project prefigures by decades the phenomenon described by Hans-Thies Lehmann as postdramatic theatre: The physical body, whose gestic vocabulary in the eighteenth century could still be read and interpreted virtually like a text, in postdramatic theatre has become its own reality which does not ‘tell’ this or that emotion but through its presence manifests itself as the site of inscription of collective history. (Lehmann 2006, 97) We ought not to be surprised that Artaud’s writings contain implicit or even explicit references to Decroux, as they knew each other well enough and Decroux spoke of their relationship (see ‘The Imaginary Interview’, pp. 95–6). In addition they each mentored Jean-Louis Barrault, and all three had different degrees of connection with the work of Jacques Copeau who had sought a Commedia ‘using contemporary types and subjects’ (Rudlin and Paul 1990, 153). Though one may argue convincingly that the seeds of Corporeal Mime come directly from Copeau’s Ecole du Vieux-Colombier, one may also find several other lesser influences, not least of all 7\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 8\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nDecroux’s working-class background as a manual labourer and a militant socialist. Copeau’s (and subsequently Decroux’s) interest in the Commedia dell’arte was shared with others searching for a new theatre such as the Russians, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold and Vakhtangov, but also the peripatetic and hugely influential Englishman Edward Gordon Craig, whom Copeau visited in Italy at the start of World War I, and whom Decroux recognizes in Words on Mime as a primary inspiration for Corporeal Mime. In ‘The First Dialogue’ (1905), Craig’s Stage Director claims: ‘The Art of the Theatre has sprung from action – movement – dance’ (Craig 2009, 73). While Craig looked to the past or to other cultures for theatres he admired, in tune with the spirit of the times, he wasn’t interested in re-creating what was lost, but in finding new forms. As Isadora Duncan wrote of the connection of her work to ancient Greek dance: ‘I do not mean to say copy it, imitate it; but to breathe its life, to recreate it in one’s self with personal inspiration’ (Preston 2005, 275). Likewise, Copeau’s innovative bare stage owes an enormous debt to what he called the Golden Ages of theatre, which had similar bare stages: the ancient Greeks, the Noh, the Commedia dell’arte and the Elizabethan theatre, as well as the modern circus ring. And Decroux’s Corporeal Mime body, with all its modernist and purist aspects, often resembles the ancient statuary we can see in museums like the Getty Villa in Malibu, representing veiled dancers and mimes of antiquity. We should include the dance of Laban, Wigman, Shawn and St Denis, Graham, Humphrey and Isadora Duncan with this list of those looking to develop a new art of movement, but these were all easily assimilated under the dance umbrella and, although Corporeal Mime might take temporary shelter there, as it differed in its basic DNA (a dramatic rather than lyric art) it never really belonged there. Decroux considered that Corporeal Mime’s rooted, Promethean lower centre of gravity and imitation of work movements clearly distinguished it from dance. (True, Laban, Graham and others advocated a lower centre of gravity, but Decroux did so explicitly because work movements – counterweights – required it. These work 8\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 9\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nmovements give Corporeal Mime a preponderance of ‘bound flow’ and gravitas, more common in drama and less so in dance, which even in its heaviest manifestations is more airborne than Corporeal Mime.) Nor did it belong with spoken theatre, which seems almost permanently wedded to the playwright. While Artaud might have wanted the theatre to be free from the playwright in order to speak its own language, its own ‘poetry of space’, he is in some ways less of a kindred spirit to Decroux than Craig is. Artaud has remained, since his death, central to the study of theatre, his writings inspiring the avant-garde of 1960s’ Europe and of America and continuing to inform both theoretical writings and performance practice. Artaud, for all the immense influence of his ideas of the theatre as plague, never developed practices that have been passed down, while Decroux carved out Corporeal Mime, inspiring through teaching rather than polemic, a living practice passed on through the bodies of his students. And if we are to take the transmission of practices as key to the discussion, we would have to concede that Craig also failed to do that. If we are looking for a set of corporeal teachings that have been passed down, perhaps we should look to Meyerhold’s biomechanics: they have attained a huge reputation since his death, but, until quite recently, with very few people who had actually studied the practice. We might argue that Meyerhold’s reputation was primarily based on his directorial profile as theatre studies indeed shifted away from the playwright, but only towards the director rather than the performer. Craig, Artaud, Copeau, Stanislavsky and Meyerhold held their places in the academy as representatives of the rise of the director. Meyerhold’s biomechanics were far more likely to have been familiar through photographs in books such as Braun’s Meyerhold on Theatre than through any engagement in actor-training or spectating. There were attempts, by the Living Theatre, for example, to use biomechanics, but they effectively galvanized photographs and descriptions from an article by Mel Gordon (1974), and galvanism only ever gave the illusion of life. In an article ten years later, Gordon wrote that he watched the Living Theatre’s demonstration with 9\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 10\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\n‘something between horror and amusement’ for ‘while the poses the actors had copied from the photographs in my article were correct, all the transitions and body rhythms were wrong’ (Gordon 1984, 13). There are reasons for the Living Theatre’s problems, as Jonathan Pitches makes clear: ‘Stalin’s eradication of biomechanics was so chillingly successful because it silenced the practitioners, those who were able to pass on the physical record of the work’ (Pitches 2006, 66). Nonetheless, footage of Meyerhold’s work has become available in recent years, and two teachers, with very differing styles, Gennady Bogdanov and Alexei Levinsky, have begun teaching regularly outside Russia. But the range of material that has survived is very limited, being reduced, as Pitches indicates, to ‘five essential biomechanical etudes’ (2006, 65), which is an astonishingly small amount of material when compared with the quantity of Decroux’s work that survives. How are we to explain the high profile, in the academy, of Meyerhold’s biomechanics, compared to Decroux’s Corporeal Mime? Is it simply that Meyerhold was more visible as a director and theoretician? Or might it be that Meyerhold, despite his comment that words should be the ‘froth on a sea of movement’, is more easily assimilated to a history of theatre that still manages to keep the written text as central, even when it shifts from an emphasis on the playwright to an emphasis on the director? Meyerhold can be seen as attempting to create a movement vocabulary that would complement, or serve, the written text, whereas both Decroux and Lecoq wanted to supplant (or at least greatly reduce the importance of) speech, written beforehand or otherwise. Decroux was neither famous as a director (he directed only two traditional plays in his life), nor as a theoretician (most people find Words on Mime impenetrable), but better known as a teacher for over fifty years. He attracted occasional attention as the teacher of Marcel Marceau and JeanLouis Barrault, but was steadfastly ignored in the academy. It is important to distinguish Decroux’s work from that of his countryman Jacques Lecoq, but there are similarities in that they were regarded as working in a marginal area of theatre 10\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 11\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nor dance. Lecoq, for example, after forty years of teaching an international clientele, was simply identified in the dance section of the French entry to the World Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Theatre as a ‘mime’ who ‘later discovered masks’ (Nagy and Rouyer 1994, 309; Chamberlain and Yarrow 2002, 4–5). The Ecole Jacques Lecoq in Paris included mime in its title until the early 1990s, but Lecoq’s view of mime was closer to Decroux’s than was the popular conception of mime as silent storytelling. In 1987, Lecoq parodied the mime who ‘pulled a face’ or gesticulated ‘crying for help’ and described such mimes as suffering from a ‘theatrical malady’ (Lecoq 1987, cited in Murray and Keefe 2007, 19). Murray and Keefe suggest that it is this view of mime as a ‘theatrical malady’ that has held sway in the academy and this might offer another possibility for why Decroux’s work has received little critical attention, even though it had nothing whatever to do with pulling faces or gesticulating, and was in fact a strong reaction against that clichéd work. Starting from the same artistic parent, Jacques Copeau, and uncle, Gordon Craig, Decroux and Lecoq, each in quite different ways, challenged the playwright’s centrality, as did Artaud, who also belongs in the tradition of Copeau, having studied with Charles Dullin. Copeau, who wanted to strengthen the actor’s performance skills through study of ballet, acrobatics, improvisation, mask building and masked acting, never intended to jettison the text in performance; but the rediscovery of the creativity of the actor was always going to tend in this direction and became manifest in the case of Lecoq and Decroux. Kathryn Wylie-Marques’s observation that Decroux continued the shamanic line in mime, while Lecoq continued a carnivalesque one, seems apt. In addition to this huge difference in their professional work, they also seemed quite different in temperament, disposition, dress and demeanour: Decroux always more of an ‘outsider’ – long grey hair, unconventional clothing – while Lecoq could have been mistaken for a banker, in his neat suit and short, carefully coiffed hair, or in his work clothes (dark athletic trousers and matching 11\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 12\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nzipper-closed, long-sleeved top) like the gym teacher he had once been. For his last decades, Decroux taught in the basement of his very modest house (a small cottage, really) while, at the same time, Lecoq had, by comparison, quite a grand school, much larger than Decroux’s tiny basement, and with the secretaries and other administrative support Decroux conspicuously lacked. Lecoq, following in the line of Copeau, employed many other teachers to help, whereas Decroux trusted only his senior students and sometimes his son to teach a few of the classes, while he himself taught most of them. Those who attended Decroux’s school knew of the remarkable price difference in Lecoq’s and Decroux’s tuition (perhaps a factor of each school’s distinctly different structure). Decroux proudly (almost defiantly) had the lowest prices in Paris (which enabled him to summarily expel any student who lacked complete commitment, as he didn’t need their tuition), and Decroux’s students imagined, correctly or incorrectly, that only people with fellowships or government grants could pay Lecoq’s fee. Self-taught and working-class to the core, Decroux knew he presided over a kind of cottage industry, and often spoke proudly of the ‘style maison’. He extolled the artisan who worked with his hands, one who had a direct connection with his work and his customers, a person who was already quickly disappearing from the Parisian landscape in the last years of Decroux’s teaching. Regardless of their different styles, however, both Decroux and Lecoq adumbrated postdramatic theatre, where the body becomes more important than text: The body becomes the centre of attention, not as a carrier of meaning but in its physicality and gesticulation. The central theatrical sign, the actor’s body, refuses to serve signification. Postdramatic theatre often presents itself as an auto-sufficient physicality, which is exhibited in its intensity, gestic potential, auratic ‘presence’ and internally, as well as externally, transmitted tensions. (Lehmann 2006, 95)\n\n12\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 13\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nBoth Decroux and Lecoq succeeded in upsetting the ancient hierarchy in which the actor’s job was to speak and illustrate the author’s text. Now, ‘[t]he body becomes the only subject matter’ (Lehmann 2006, 96). Of course, Decroux and Lecoq were not lone harbingers, but they were among the most militant in their struggle. If the nineteenth century was the century of the playwright, and the twentieth century the century of the director, might the twenty-first century become the century of the actor, working on the foundations established by Copeau, Craig, Artaud and Meyerhold, and especially, we might argue, Etienne Decroux?\n\n1931: A year of convergence Around the same years that the lucid and painful curses of Antonin Artaud began to resonate, an event occurred in the kingdom of the actor. Near 1931, mime was reborn in France under the name of ‘corporeal mime.’ (Lorelle 1974, 105) According to Yves Lorelle, 1931 was an important year in the development of Corporeal Mime, the art which Etienne Decroux first glimpsed in 1923, when the twenty-five-year-old manual labourer – who had saved enough money to live for a year without working – enrolled in voice and speech classes at the Ecole du Vieux-Colombier. While studying voice, he took classes in masked improvisation which gave birth to Decroux’s life-long research. Afterwards, he became a stage, film and radio actor while developing his true passion, Corporeal Mime. [Decroux’s] first offensive against the text occurred in the Théâtre Lancry in 1931. He performed, with his wife, La Vie Primitive, ‘corporeal’ mimodrama which they developed together. A single performance was given. (Lorelle 1974, 107)\n\n13\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 14\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nDecroux’s ‘offensive against the text’ had as its goal the placement of the actor squarely at the centre of the dramatic endeavour, displacing the playwright and sending him into exile, evicting the other ‘alien arts’ – costuming, décor, music, dance – as well. The meeting between Jean-Louis Barrault and Etienne Decroux is the second act of the war of these expert marksmen of the theatre, these ‘corporeal mimes.’ It happened on the stage of Dullin’s theatre, the future Atelier – during the year 1931. (Lorelle 1974, 108) While acting with Charles Dullin’s company, and teaching in his school, Decroux met Jean-Louis Barrault in 1931. Barrault helped Decroux in the early elaboration of Corporeal Mime (see Barrault 1972 and 1984). Decroux and Barrault both moved in circles frequented by Artaud, who briefly apprenticed with Dullin, mentored Barrault and directed Decroux in at least one production. Nicola Savarese’s article ‘1931: Antonin Artaud Sees Balinese Theatre at the Paris Colonial Exposition’ (2001) gives us important details about the Balinese performances which influenced Artaud’s nascent view of a new Western theatre. Savarese writes that: it is very clear that Artaud wanted to use Balinese theatre as both example and confirmation of something of which he had become convinced during that period: that the theatre must have its own language, a language that is not the same as the language of words but which is based on the actor’s physicality. (Savarese 2001, 51) I imagine another article, entitled ‘1931: Etienne Decroux Sees Cambodian Theatre at the Paris Colonial Exposition’, which might argue that, for Decroux, the Cambodians provided a comparable example and confirmation as the Balinese had for Artaud. While we have little direct evidence of this (Decroux 14\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 15\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\ndid not publish an article about the Cambodians, as Artaud had about the Balinese), what we do know is intriguing and suggestive. Sasagawa Hideo writes that although the Royal Ballet of Cambodia did not attend the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, a substitute troupe, directed by Soy Sangvong, the wife of a member of the royal family, was sent instead to perform at the very popular and spectacular model of Angkor Wat, the sensation of the Exposition (Hideo 2005, 428). In 1935, a travel writer in Cambodia described her meeting with Sangvong: The leader of the Angkor troupe is Princess Wongat Soysangvane, a member of the old Cambodian nobility. Her headquarters, and that of her troupe (except in the tourist season) are at Phnom Penh, where all the elaborately embroidered and bejewelled costumes worn by the dancers are made by her own clever fingers. . . . The head-dresses are modelled in the art-studios of the Museum, and are all exact copies of those in the basreliefs. Madame speaks French fluently; and has many tales to tell of the Great Adventure of 1931, when she took her troupe to Paris to perform at the Colonial Exhibition at Vincennes. (Ponder 1936, 240) Based on the following facts, one might argue that this is the troupe Decroux probably saw. During the years 1968–72, Etienne Decroux in the basement studio of his home in a suburb of Paris frequently mentioned the present-yet-absent faces of the statues from Angkor in Cambodia as the ideal expression for Corporeal Mime. In 1968, Decroux was a seventy-year-old master teacher in his prime, still physically vital, and one who had boiled his teaching down to the essential. From the intensity of his descriptions, one could tell that these Angkor faces were part of what he treasured deeply, a key element of his teaching. He didn’t just mention them in passing; he ardently urged us to visit the Musée Guimet to see these statues first-hand 15\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 16\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nand to sense how much expression passed through those supposedly expressionless faces. In his life-long rebellion against the expressive face and hands of nineteenth-century pantomime, Decroux had found a strong and ancient ally, an Asian precursor to Copeau’s noble mask. One French journalist who witnessed the performances of Cambodian dancers in 1931 wrote: It is generally thought that Cambodian dances are nothing more than processions or confused tangles of harmonious plastic poses. It seems as if it is not possible to refer to Cambodian dancers without using the term ‘hieratic.’ . . . All the feelings have been foreseen and codified, as has been the way they are expressed. The face remains completely impassive beneath its white make-up but the body has means of expression that can reveal the movements of the very soul. (Florisoone in Savarese 2001, 72–3) Ponder describes the white make-up in more detail: [I]t is difficult to recognize their vivacious expressive features in the creamy-white uniformity into which their curiously flat ‘make-up’ has transformed them. They might almost have been whitewashed, so thickly are their faces plastered over with an opaque paste which destroys all expression, and on which the lips and eyebrows . . . stand out in startling contrast. (Ponder 1936, 241) The impassive face, the codified and highly articulate bodily movements and the ‘plastic poses’ as well as the use of the term ‘hieratic’ (formal, stylized and related to sacred persons or offices) all remind us of elements found in Decroux’s own developing Corporeal Mime of 1931, the same year he wrote his first ‘proper piece of writing on art’ (Decroux 1985, 23–7) entitled ‘Partial Incarnation of the Future Actor’. Another reviewer describes the specific pieces the Cambodians performed in 1931: 16\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 17\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nThree dances: one to extend a greeting, the fight between a white monkey and a black one, and, to finish, the story of Prince Soryavong, an elegant subject worthy of our fables or those of Boccaccio. The orchestra, composed of kongs in the shape of a horseshoe made of seventeen little gongs joined together, is made up of, among other instruments, twin drums, flutes, cymbals and of a curious instrument made up of wooden strips. The dancers, dressed in sumptuous costumes, wearing golden or silver-plate tiaras, depending on their rank, adorned sometimes by grimacing masks, dripping with gold jewellery encrusted with precious stones, expressed with unchanging gestures all human feelings. Each action, each nuance of gesture, handed down from generation to generation. And this art, which is neither lascivious nor vulgar and by which the legs arced, the arms vibrate like reptiles, hands curved upward, the head and back drawn upward, attained a nobility and a religious emotion which made us pass from humble reality to the world of legend. (Cadilhac 1931, 564) Those of us who know Decroux’s work well and first-hand, recognize in the phrase ‘a nobility and a religious emotion which made us pass from humble reality to the world of legend’ an exact description of Decroux’s passionate convictions about Corporeal Mime. In addition to Etienne Decroux’s frequent references to the facial expression of certain Cambodian statues (which seem to mirror the facial expressions in the Cambodian dances Decroux probably saw), he also devised a quarter turn which he called ‘The Cambodian’. This cubistically articulated movement begins in the foot and leg, which first ‘wake up’ before they pull the body into a turn. Additionally, Leonard Pitt recalls Decroux’s appreciation of the articulations and isolations of Cambodian dance during Pitt’s years of study, the mid-1960s (email to Leabhart, 21 February 2008). Steven Wasson, too, describes a movement of hands and fingers which Decroux called ‘les doigts de la danseuse 17\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 18\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\ncambodgienne’ in Decroux’s classes in the 1980s, a halfcentury after he would have seen the performance which inspired it (email to Leabhart, 2 July 2007). In searching for more specific proof, Leabhart met with Decroux’s son, Maximilien, on 9 July 2007 in Boulogne (in the small house which had once been his father’s home and school). Leabhart asked Decroux-fils if he thought his father had seen the Cambodian dance at the Colonial Exposition of 1931. He replied that he knew his father had attended the Exposition, and that he knew he had seen Cambodian dance, although he could not verify that the performance in question was the one at the Colonial Exposition. He jokingly said that one could assert that his father had seen it at the Exposition if one wanted to, and that no one could contradict him. One more tantalizing detail: Decroux’s great friend Paul Bellugue, with whom he performed lecture demonstrations, and whose knowledge of classical sculpture and anatomy Decroux found essential in the formulation of Corporeal Mime, spent five years, from 1925 to 1930, in Cambodia and wrote articles about Cambodian art (Bellugue 1963, 285). Bellugue describes a moment from the Cambodian dance: Thus, like the idols in the temples, like a god descended from the heavenly palaces of Indra, the queen, a thousand years ago, was carried off on the golden palanquin towards the dance room. Smiling and secretive, she floated along, gently rocking above the shoulders and the bowed heads, into the bluish sweltering heat of evening. Thus, similarly dressed and for the same celebrations, the king’s dancers move towards the Phnom Penh palace today. (Bellugue 1963, 309) And the photograph accompanying this page of Bellugue’s text? The same one which appears in the 22 August 1931 issue of L’Illustration, detailing the Cambodians’ performance at the Colonial Exposition (Cadilhac 1931, 565). Finally, and perhaps most conclusively, the late Guy Benhaim’s 1992 dissertation on Etienne Decroux confirms 18\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 19\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nFigure 2 Figures 2 and 3 are photographs from the 22 August 1931 issue of L’Illustration depicting Cambodian dancers, whom Decroux probably saw at the Colonial Exposition that year.\n\nFigure 3 Cambodian dancers, 1931.\n\n19\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 20\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nthat, according to some of Decroux’s last assistants (he does not give their names), Decroux saw the Cambodians in Paris in 1931 (Benhaim 1992, 106). Whatever Decroux saw, and whenever he actually saw it, Cambodian dance left a lasting and thrilling impression on his imagination, as it had on another French genius, Auguste Rodin, who made drawings of the Cambodians when they visited Marseilles nine years earlier. But Decroux’s poorly documented encounter finally produced a concrete acting technique, unlike Artaud’s welldocumented one, which produced primarily theory. Whereas Savarese contends that Artaud’s meeting with the Balinese confirmed his conviction that ‘theatre must have its own language, a language that is not the same as the language of words but which is based on the actor’s physicality’, we argue that Decroux’s encounter with the Cambodians also confirmed his similar conviction. However, and this is where the result was finally different, due to ill health, Artaud was unable to follow through with the actual creation of a Western equivalent to the Balinese dance-theatre ‘language’. In addition to Artaud’s poor health, Savarese suggests that his ‘poetic nature . . . [his] mental indiscipline’ kept him from practising a ‘rigorous actor’s art based on discipline’ (2001, 73). Decroux, however, spent a half-century on his project, the creation of Corporeal Mime, a part of which he attributed to some early impressions of Cambodian dancetheatre. Leonard Pronko in his groundbreaking study Theatre East and West describes another important aspect of Artaud’s fascination with the Balinese, using words which could aptly describe Decroux’s impressions of the Cambodians: Through the dancer, who has become a kind of medium at the same time he is an artist, we the audience are put into contact, however dimly, with some experience beyond that of our everyday physical world. We are somehow brought into touch with what Artaud would call an absolute. (Pronko 1967, 14) 20\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 21\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring Leonard Pitt’s years of study with Decroux in the 1960s, Pitt remembers Decroux explaining in class that the student-actor must ‘empty yourself so that this place can be filled with the soul of God’ (email to Leabhart, 21 February 2008). In an attempt to move the student into that absolute world which Decroux imagined as Corporeal Mime, a world quite different from that of the theatre and cinema acting of Decroux’s day, he invited his young ‘converts’ to undertake a kind of shamanic voyage. Decroux’s first disciple, Jean-Louis Barrault, writes in shamanic terms (or perhaps derived from his study of the Cabala with Artaud) that he: understood, during this night of initiation, that the whole problem of theatre is to make the Silence vibrate. Melt this Silence. Travel upstream. When the river flows into the sea, it dies; its estuary is the site of its illness . . . It’s a question of going against the flow to return to the source, to the birth, to the essence. (Barrault 1972, 77) Artaud’s and Barrault’s acceptance of Asian influence, which revitalized and confirmed their already firmly established differences from mainstream theatre practice of their time, may not be the first time East has revitalized West. Enrico Fulchignoni argues that in the early development of the Commedia dell’arte, ‘the words gradually untwined themselves from the written text and improvisation took over’ (1990, 30). Fulchignoni writes that relations with the Orient are intensified during the late Middle Ages. There are no longer just a few isolated pioneers but a real flow of information and systematic exploring, along with commercial interests and trade [. . .]. [A]s a result of contacts between the two worlds the scale and value of things can only develop in completely new directions. (Fulchignoni 1990, 34) This description fits perfectly the Colonial period, when commerce and artistic cross-pollination went hand-in-hand, 21\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 22\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nand when, as in the early fifteenth century, ‘displacements of people occurred, as well as of cultural property’ (Fulchignoni 1990, 40). When one is dealing with the written or printed word, it is possible to prove these connections [between East and West]. But when one is concerned with something which cannot be defined in words – the ephemeral, the instantaneous, the magical, as in the case of theatre – one has to proceed on an act of faith. In a century of fervent expressive power, as prevailed in the period before the explosion of the Renaissance, the dialogue between East and West never stopped for a second. Each new proof of the existence of such interaction is further assertion of the fragility of Eurocentristic theories of cultural reality. (Fulchignoni 1990, 41) Fulchignoni argues convincingly that Asian theatre forms likely had some effect on the beginnings of Commedia dell’arte. And I argue that the Balinese and Cambodian forms, respectively, that Artaud and Decroux witnessed, confirmed and inspired their own work towards a new actor-centred (rather than text-based) theatre. In Artaud’s case, because of his temperament and poor health, his work was episodic, and resulted more in theory than in practice. In Decroux’s case, his work became a life-long obsession with elaborating an aesthetic and a codified technique appropriate to a newly articulated actor, on a bare stage, at the centre of a theatre from which the playwright had been evicted. Note 1\n\n22\n\nMiranda Welby-Everard’s ‘Imagining the Actor: The Theatre of Claude Cahun’ (2006) documents how the Parisian avant-garde of the 1920s and 30s valued many of the same things Decroux did: artificiality, masks, puppets, ‘pure art’, ‘transformation of the actor/dancer into a living effigy through reduction to a system of lines, shapes and colours’, ‘denial of characterization, set and plot, the abandonment of human narrative and the removal of the standard structure of exposition, development,\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 23\n\nEDITORS’ INTRODUCTION\n\ncrisis and dénouement’, the actor ‘concealed within a body-mask and operated like a clockwork toy’, ‘eradicating the human face’, etc. But whereas Decroux continued in this line for half a century, creating a highly articulated corporeal vocabulary in the service of this ideology, many of his contemporaries passed quickly through this phase, without it becoming the determining element of their work. One might say that many of his ideas were in the spirit of his time, and that he persevered.\n\n23\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 24\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nAt last a creator in the theatre, from the theatre Edward Gordon Craig [First published in Arts, 3 August 1945, translated from the French by Sally Leabhart.]\n\nMore than a thousand audience members packed the theatre of the Maison de la Chimie on 27 June to attend a performance by Etienne Decroux, Jean-Louis Barrault and Eliane Guyon in their ‘Programme of Corporeal Mime’. There they heard my name pronounced several times by Mr Jean Dorcy when he explained to them the overriding idea of the event. Mr Dorcy told his audience that this Decroux–Barrault performance had been inspired by some idea which had come from me. Now, I attended that remarkable performance, and watching it, I realized that it was an attempt, developed slowly over time, to create an art for the stage. But I didn’t see how I could claim to have earned, by my actions or my words, Mr Dorcy’s great compliment – although I would have been sincerely honoured to have done so. Mr Dorcy can perhaps indicate something in one of my books that will serve as an excuse for his generous assertion, but until then, alas, I remain free to deny my participation. And what is more important, I remain equally free to praise this courageous and remarkable attempt. But we are dealing here with something more than an attempt. For years, preparatory work has been done with the greatest care. Certain signs of this work still cling to the œuvre presented. But I don’t intend to analyse this under a magnifying glass, nor ‘explicate’ it. To criticize it would be much too easy. That I will do perhaps when Mr Decroux’s work has become more familiar to me. For the moment it is enough to insist on the fact that if, during the performance, I was only once swept away by my enthusiasm, I was no less constantly convinced that I was seeing a serious attempt to create an art for the theatre. (We use the word art too lightly. We would not 24\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 25\n\nEDWARD GORDON CRAIG\n\ndo so if we could find another to replace it.) I would not go so far as to say positively that this art was original – even though I am practically convinced of it – but I can swear to this: Mr Decroux has progressed towards such an art, he has walked without fear in the right direction, with a ferocious faith. That, we realized, had certainly been accomplished, and the ensemble was perfectly wonderful. ‘Not more than that?’ you will ask. Yes, a great deal more. We were present at the creation of an alphabet, an ABC of mime. Or, if you refuse to allow the word ‘creation’, let’s say ‘rediscovery’, since a rediscovery is indeed, don’t you agree, the most we can accomplish? Treasures lie at our feet, here and there. We must accustom our eyes to see the enchanted seed, our ears to hear the mystic sounds. I have travelled a great deal in Europe, visiting many cities in Holland, Germany, Russia, Italy, England, Scotland, but until now I had never seen anything comparable to this attempt. You must not do me (and my subject) the injustice of supposing that I have used the work ‘attempt’ three times in order to diminish the work. I do not at all use it to this end, but only to avoid exaggeration in order to keep you – those of you who attended the performance with me – from shouting ‘Bravo’ too quickly the next time. For there exist among us a good number of incredulous ones – ‘untouchables’ – whom the grace of a huge tree does not impress, nor the strength of an ant. And we would like to see these sceptical friends convinced, moved and shouting ‘Bravo!’ Without them, the victory is only half won. So, the next time, give them the opportunity to acclaim Decroux a moment before you do. For my part, I am entirely convinced by what I saw on 27 June of this year of liberation. Next to the work of Decroux and Barrault, the operas and other state theatres of Europe seem ridiculous. Anything but liberated, ‘bound hand and foot’ would be a better term for describing them. Even assuming that one cannot stick the label of ‘original’ onto the work of Mr Decroux – but tell me, what is ‘original’ – what can be original? Mr Decroux could, for all I know, 25\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 26\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nhave seen years ago some Japanese toy and been inspired by it. Or else been inspired by some grandiose fragments of sculpture. No doubt, some traveller will come back some day from the icy zones of the far North to tell us that he saw, in Alaska, or in Iceland, people whose appearance reminded him over and over of Decroux, Barrault and Guyon in Passage of Men Across the Earth. I doubt it, by the way. But what importance would that have? Mr Dalcroze, the collaborator of Adolphe Appia, perhaps already started the composition of an ABC of mime. Maybe he already got to the letter D. Mr Dorcy did not name Mr Dalcroze but he should not pass unnoticed. As for Isadora – inimitable and always imitated – she surely understood mime without even needing to invent an ABC. For there exists something incalculable, genius – always remember this – which has nothing to do with talent. For example, when Mr Barrault, that evening of 27 June, performed ‘The Horse’ for us, he did it by the grace of genius. And if the dissatisfied can’t forgive him for it: too bad for them. Genius is something other than talent. You French people know that, but I will cite an English definition which I like: ‘Genius arrives at its goal by instinctive perception and spontaneous activity, rather than by methods which allow for a well-defined analysis, and which are the methods that talent uses.’ This is completely Jean-Louis. Is it also Mr Decroux? I would be tempted to believe that Mr Decroux possesses genius but that, being a very wary man, he does not dare count on it entirely – he mistrusts it. He prefers to help his genius rather than to own it and enjoy it. They say he will come to be seen as the master of mime. I consider that the title already belongs to him. Young people will read this article – it is especially dedicated to them, as I honour their enthusiasm – and as they already have (as I do) great admiration for what Mr Decroux does, they will be careful not to argue among themselves. Arguments may be good for those who hold political discussions but they cannot serve us in any way. We serve on the battlefield of art, and if we can’t do something valuable, we must follow our leaders with great faithfulness. I followed 26\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 27\n\nEDWARD GORDON CRAIG\n\nmine – you will read someday the French translation of a book that I wrote to celebrate the memory of my teacher, Henry Irving. Disciples often want to teach things to their teachers. I didn’t do that. I don’t do it. Be careful, then, that your enthusiasm does not degenerate into selfishness. You would certainly not want to make Mr Decroux’s task more difficult than it already is. But this is what you will do if you do not unite to support him, him and his idea (and not your own conception of his idea), to help him accomplish this idea. At his side, to help him, Jean-Louis Barrault – actor, director and creator of the most purely lyrical thing I have had the pleasure of seeing on stage up to this point: I mean ‘The Horse’. Like all lyrical creation, large or small, this was easy to understand . . . and it was irresistible. You recognized it yourselves, as you shouted, applauded and made the most cheerful noise I’ve heard in years. And what did Barrault do? He made a simple inclination of the head – he did not want to come forward to bow, and bow again, and thus cause more applause. That is the attitude of an actor of rare quality and an exceptional man. Hold the memory of it dearly. And, if you can, and are willing, know that I am sincerely your friend.\n\n27\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 28\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nThe hidden master Eugenio Barba [Reprinted from Mime Journal: Words on Decroux 2, 1997, translated from the Italian by Antonello Villani.]\n\nIt may be hard to believe that I first heard about Etienne Decroux in 1966 in Holstebro, Denmark, where the Odin Teatret had just moved from Norway. Maybe I had, in some of my readings, come upon his name, but it had not made a lasting impression. The elusive nature of the name Decroux makes one aware of one of the great injustices of theatre in our century. Decroux began erecting the cathedral of Corporeal Mime at the close of the 1920s. He had personally known Copeau, taught at Dullin’s school and collaborated with Artaud. He never stopped working. In 1940, he opened his mime school in Paris. Two of his pupils and collaborators, Jean-Louis Barrault – whom he had met in 1931 – and Marcel Marceau, became world famous. In 1963, the prestigious publisher Gallimard put out his book Paroles sur le mime (Words on Mime). In spite of it all, I knew nothing about Decroux even though I had been a student at the Warsaw Theatre School and had worked with Grotowski, and, as a self-taught man of the theatre, always hunted after the works of the masters and devoured French books. Though maybe I am to blame for the oversight, the name Decroux hardly ever surfaced at that time, and the tremendous value of what he had discovered and accomplished was not perceived as one of the theatre’s great treasures. For me – as for Grotowski back then – the art of mime seemed to find its incarnation in the celebrated Marceau or in Lecoq. It was Ingemar Lindh, a young Swede who had attended the mime classes Decroux taught in his own Paris home, who first told me about him. Ingemar illustrated the basic principles of the work done there and demonstrated some of the 28\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 29\n\nEUGENIO BARBA\n\nexercises he had learned. He told me many anecdotes revealing his master’s personality. He also told me that he and some fellow students from Decroux’s school wished to start a group but had no place to do it. I mentioned that if they agreed to live far from the world’s theatre capitals they could settle in Holstebro and use the Odin Teatret space. That’s how Ingemar Lindh, Yves Lebreton, Maria Lexa and Giselle Pellissier came to Odin Teatret in Holstebro, where they created Studio 2 in January 1968. They were totally independent, making a kind of theatre that was profoundly different from ours. And yet we were both interested in each other’s approach and shared a common attitude towards our work, a comparable way to reconcile anarchy and self-discipline. Decroux became a household name at Odin Teatret. I started thinking of him as a hidden master. Etienne Decroux himself came to Odin Teatret in April 1969, when I invited him to a week-long seminar devoted to ‘scenic language’. The two other guests were Jacques Lecoq and Dario Fo. Each presented his theatre works and rehearsal techniques and ran hands-on workshops with the Scandinavian actors and directors who took part in the programme. Decroux wore black shorts and a black tee shirt. Ingemar Lindh translated from the French into Swedish. Sentences such as ‘Le style c’est l’homme’ (Style makes the man) and ‘people stink’ had the effect of bombs at a time in history that’s etched in memory simply as 1968. But Decroux was not one to make concessions to political correctness. He was a proletarian and an anarchist, but he was also an aristocrat. He did not merely teach the ‘scientific’ principles of acting, but a way to position oneself which from posture and movement radiated to an all-embracing ethical and spiritual stance. At the conclusion of the seminar, he presented me with a copy of his Paroles sur le mime (Words on Mime) with a friendly dedication. I have since read it over and over again, and it has become one of the sources I use to test the principles of Theatre Anthropology which I began outlining in 1980. Earlier in 1969 I travelled to Paris to finalize Odin Teatret’s participation in the Théâtre des Nations, and paid 29\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 30\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nDecroux a visit for the purpose of inviting him to the abovementioned seminar. He and his wife gave me a warm welcome and we had a long chat in their small drawing room. I told them that we would bring our production, Ferai, to Paris the following summer and invited them to come and see it. Ingemar Lindh and Yves Lebreton shook their heads, as Decroux was no longer in the habit of going to the theatre. However, when Odin Teatret arrived in Paris in June, Decroux and his wife surprisingly showed up at the Ferai premiere. The show was designed for an audience of no more than sixty on two rows of facing benches. The scenic space on which the actors operated consisted of the floor between the two rows. No sooner had Decroux sat down than he began voicing to his wife his reactions to such an unusual set-up. Decroux’s critical grumbling did not end when the show began. On the contrary, it grew denser as it progressed. Then the man sitting next to him leaned over and whispered in his ear: ‘Pardon, monsieur, mais vous dérangez le spectacle!’ (Excuse me, sir, you are disturbing the performance!) Decroux got up and disdainfully answered: ‘Monsieur, c’est le spectacle qui me dérange!’ (Sir, it’s the performance that’s disturbing me!) He took his wife by the arm and left, walking like a king through the imperturbable actors. He almost slammed the door as he walked out. Though I never saw him again, his writings and words, and all that he was able to transmit to his pupils and, through them, to me, have continued to influence my thoughts on the actor’s presence. The laws of art are relative. Their value does not lie in whether they are right or truthful. They only work if embraced wholeheartedly. They create a contradiction in that, while not absolute, they must be followed as though they were. This results in a paradoxical use of intolerance. Many masters of classic Asian theatre do not tolerate their pupils getting some of their learning from other sources. Sometimes they even forbid them to attend performances executed in a different style. In that, Decroux was the most ‘Asian’ of the European masters. But, unlike the real world, where intolerance is used to destroy diversity, in the art world – and especially in the 30\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 31\n\nEUGENIO BARBA\n\ntheatre – intolerance is a pedagogical fiction, as fictive as it seems ruthless. It is not used to destroy diversity, but to protect it and ensure its evolution. It has nothing to do with power and imposition, but with self-discipline and a refusal to compromise. That is why Decroux never accepted fluctuations of taste. He loved poetry and the art of rhetoric. He was a great raconteur, yet he banned speech from mime, not out of personal distaste, but only to allow corporeal art to grow freely on its own, without what could have been the limiting intervention and mediation of language. This very particular form of artistic ‘intolerance’ was not unlike Craig’s or Copeau’s when they said that school rather than performance is the true objective of theatre, or Grotowski’s, when he banned scenery, make-up and masks from his productions. This was not the product of a judgement, but of a strategy. Decroux used to talk a lot to his pupils as they learned the actions and movements of mime. He often made them sing or he sang to them. I wonder if he did it as a way to stress that in mime silence is like a vow of poverty that his pupils had to practise before they could give life to the silence of the body. My last image of Decroux in his final months is both glorious and horrible. It is an indirect image which came to me through the eyes and words of his Brazilian pupil, Luis Octavio Burnier, a young director and teacher at the University of Campinas who had often worked with me both at the International School of Theatre Anthropology and during Odin’s South American tours. He died in February 1995 of sudden cardiac arrest in the hospital where he was under observation for a backache. ‘Decroux constantly sang at work,’ Luis Octavio told me. ‘The speed of each movement was dictated by the rhythm, while its dynamic quality was set by the intensity of the master’s voice. Sometimes he sang alone while giving us directions. Other times we sang with him while practising. He picked old popular French and English tunes, which he interpreted with irony and with a distorted accent. Contrary to generally accepted rules, the breathing out was the active phase where he placed and developed the action. The breathing in was fast, 31\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 32\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nand he called it spasme. It marked the beginning of the action which was intended to clash with the resistance obtained by stretching the breathing out as far as it would go.’ And, Luis Octavio added, ‘Decroux was obsessed with what he considered the invisible movement. He used the violin analogy. Sound can be heard even though the bow moves imperceptibly, so there is music even in the apparent absence of movement. He called it the gong effect. Like an echo, which lingers on, a movement continues even after it’s completed.’ Decroux sang one last time for himself and his pupil when the latter paid him a visit in 1990. The master was in an armchair, staring into space, his mouth hollow without his dentures. When he saw his former pupil reaching out to hug him, he began to sing. He bounced his head from side to side and rolled his eyes, his mouth wide open as though trying to hold the final note of a line. In that, Luis recognized the ‘violin effect’. Though the old man’s body was paralysed and close to the end, Luis could feel his fingers rhythmically clutching his hand as though following a tune. The master lifted his forearm and elbow from the armrest and moved them with the sound. Luis, too, sang. The two sang together for over an hour. It was an extraordinary way to celebrate silence. ‘He had a lion within,’ Luis concluded, ‘which only his technique could control.’ Decroux had his own peculiar way of speaking subliminally. For him, technique and ethics were one, so, whenever he illustrated some of the principles of mime art, he seemed to indicate a way to position oneself not only on the floor, but also in relation to life. In other words, for him, mime art and the art of living were one and the same. Thus, those who worked with Decroux learned more from him than technique alone. One may say that still to this day Decroux is a hidden master, one who reveals himself in his own pupils. It is a great pleasure to meet them. They all seem to belong to the same clan, as though they had all been given the same set of values to share, values I share with them. L’Homme qui voulait rester debout (The Man Who Preferred to Stand) was the title of a performance that some of his pupils dedicated to him in Philadelphia in early April 32\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 33\n\nEUGENIO BARBA\n\n1992, a year after Decroux’s death. In it, Steven Wasson and Corinne Soum reconstructed some of the master’s works, including popular pieces such as Le Combat antique and Le Menuisier. Decroux created these two pieces in 1945 and 1931. He continued teaching at his school until the beginning of 1987. In essence, if we consider his artistic incubation, and the work of discovery and invention begun at the time of his apprenticeship with Copeau, we could look at Decroux’s as a teaching career that spanned a whole century. Was it really an injustice that Decroux should remain unknown to so many? It was certainly unfair that the French government, so proud of its cultural institutions and so prone to bestowing honours and staging solemn ceremonials, never considered Decroux one of its glories. It isn’t unfair, however, that his fame is not widespread. I believe that was a conscious choice on his part. Hundreds of people, actors and acting teachers all over the planet, were clearly imprinted by Decroux. One could even turn the fairness issue around and say that Decroux was the most influential of teachers, the only one to closely resemble the great masters of classic Asian theatres, who believed, just as he did, that it is impossible to separate doctrine from tradition, personal disposition, anger, humour, gentleness or sternness. Taped excerpts of Etienne Decroux’s voice were inserted between different acts of the performance in his honour produced one year after his death. His voice was endowed with a self-contained authority and the grandeur of those nineteenth-century anarchist labourers who spoke like kings. The Decroux pupils I have met here and there in the world at different times since 1966 all share the distinction of being the children of an unknown king. Some of them are proud legitimate princes; others are secretly loved bastards. Still others are rebellious and disowned children – or so they feel – waiting for a chance to come home, while others freely dispense a knowledge Decroux himself would never have wanted, polluted by the need to make it public. Yet they all are the children of an anarchist king who himself was the son of an anarchist. 33\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 34\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nI was the guest in Philadelphia in early 1992, as though Decroux himself had secretly invited the stranger who had invited him in 1969. A Tribute to Etienne Decroux, an event sponsored by Movement Theatre International, was organized by Michael Pedretti. There I met some of the Decroux pupils and associates I had already heard about, such as Thomas Leabhart, Daniel Stein, George Molnar, Kari Margolis and Dulcinea Langfelder. If I start counting from Ingemar Lindh and Yves Lebreton, all the way to the most recent Decroux pupils such as Eugenio Ravo and Michele Monetta, whom I met in occupied factories in Bologna and Naples, I realize that his pupils are like a tribe. Is it appropriate then to talk of him as a hidden master? The theatre group founded by Steven Wasson and Corinne Soum, who are continuing Decroux’s teaching tradition in London and created the Philadelphia production of the master’s old and new pieces, is known as L’Ange fou (The Crazy Angel). I wonder if there ever was a crazy angel of the theatre in this century, and, if so, who it is or was? Decroux is the bridge between the generation of Craig and Copeau – their research and revolution – and those who, in the second half of this century, rediscovered the theatre as space and vehicle of paradox and rebellion. In the theatre of our century, he stands out as a model who preserved his own raison d’être and tenacity, his unwavering commitment, with no need or inclination for alibis or compromises. He built a little island of freedom in his small house, and in the tiny room inside where he met with his pupils. He did not depend on anybody’s financial support. There were times when he had very few pupils, but that did not persuade him to go in a different direction. His knowledge of the actor’s pre-expressive level, how to build up presence, and how to articulate the transformation of energy, is unequalled in Western theatre history. In my opinion, it is a tragedy that he was not equally obsessed with the creation and composition of productions, and that all his attempts were bound to an aesthetic philosophy that I do not believe capable of striking and moving an audience. I wonder if it was because he treasured 34\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 35\n\nEUGENIO BARBA\n\nresearch over everything else; or rather, because he truly believed, as Craig did, that it would be desirable to close down all theatres for many years and prepare to start again from the roots. Finally, I wonder if Decroux’s theatre was not after all made for a non-existent audience. Maybe if an angel dreamt like a madman, he would end up turning into such a man, such an actor and master.\n\n35\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 36\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n09:51\n\nPage 37\n\ntwo\n\nPart two\n\nPart\n\n20/10/08\n\nWords of Decroux\n\n1 Revolt\n\nFigure 4 Etienne Decroux in Sport (c. 1948).

I was above all discreet, as the only role where one could show mime capabilities amply displayed was that of [Jean] Gaspard Deburau, played by Jean-Louis Barrault. My role came down to providing a foil for his. CF: Did you enjoy watching Barrault during the filming? ED: Tremendously. As much as I spurn the use of superlatives and other fancy words, I think that Barrault was light and energetic, and, if the public thinks as I do, they will see Barrault in his best role to date. CF: The pantomime in this film is historical. Can you tell us the difference you see between it and what you usually practise? ED: To answer you in a way that will not earn me a harsh reprimand from some erudite scholar hidden in the shadows, I would have to know the history of pantomime better than I do. Now, I am not an art historian. What time I have left over from my profession as an actor is taken up by the practice of mime and not by looking at the past or at Asia. CF: You won’t get off the hook so easily. You must tell us something. ED: Let’s go, then. I have at least a vision of old-style pantomime. First of all, when I was still a child, I was fortunate enough to see pantomime’s final tremors. Subsequently, I saw, as everyone has, engravings that depicted pantomimists at work. Then again, my intuition tells me that the mimed ballets at the Opéra [de Paris], and the acting styles of people who call themselves mimes, must contain some vestiges of the old-style pantomime. Finally, I have, after all, read a bit on the question. First point: the face was nude and the body covered. I want the body to be nude and the face veiled. CF: There you have, indeed, a reversal. ED: As a consequence of this first point: [in old-style pantomime] the face had the leading role and the body ETIENNE DECROUX:\n\n39\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 40\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nlimited itself to going along with it and prolonging its intentions without betraying them. My taste is for the body to have the leading role, and the face, if it must be uncovered, is limited to going along with the body, prolonging its intentions without betraying them. CF: The reversal is complete. And why do you have such a low regard for the face and a high one for the body? ED: In my opinion, acting with the body is infinitely more poetic than acting with the face. CF: The face is nevertheless more expressive. ED: That’s what I have against it. It’s a material that is too easily worked, a body part which is too obedient. Great art implies rebellious matter. Now, the body is rebellious. Without imagining acrobatic or choreographic feats – without requiring oneself to become a serpentman, if only to stylize the ordinary evolution of mankind – one must work for about ten years. And this does not do away with the necessity of having talent and culture. But the area of difficulty is necessarily that of noble art. Beauty does not give her favours at the first request, she wants proof of love. Moreover, if the face is expressive, it does not take us to a different world. If it gets to that other world, it is because it is impassive and mummified, becoming mask-like, and that brings us to Corporeal Mime. When the body acts, carrying its face, one should be able to say [of the face] these two verses of Hugo [from ‘L’Aigle du casque’]. Qui paraissait rêver au centre d’une toile, Pas plus ému d’un choc que d’un souffle une étoile. [Who seemed to be dreaming in the center of a canvas, No more fearful of a blow than would be a star of a puff of air.] 40\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 41\n\nREVOLT\n\nThe nude body expressing what one receives generally from words and from the gaze, transports us to another world. The face sweats reality. And there is even something immodest in using such an intimate part of the body to cry in front of everyone. The movements of the soul are private things. To show one’s nude body is not the same as showing one’s inner life. In love, for example, it is verifiable that if there is lewdness somewhere, it is found in the face. If I were a woman I would be less embarrassed to be a prostitute than to be an actress. I would like the actor not to be a man deprived of a private life, that he be a real person as are the sculptor, the painter, the composer. But the best reason for my preferring the body is that face re-presents and the body creates. The face presents a second time what it presents a first time in life. It produces for everyone the sadness it felt on its own. It’s realism. For art to exist, one must create. The body can create: professions mould the body. So much so that there are bent-over men, others as straight as sticks and others bearing the mark of having been mixed. It’s been ages since man expressed states of his soul with his body. The result is that if today he intended to do so, he would have to devote himself to serious study. CF: Don’t you run the risk of lacking artists beautiful enough to practise this art? ED: Beauty in the proportions is not required so much. Movement erases forms. What Baudelaire said about movement in relation to the beauty of forms he could have said about the ugliness of forms. Unlike the face, the body is large; its parts cover large distances. In art, moral grandeur implies physical grandeur. A fresco is worth more than a miniature. The word knick-knack [chinoiserie] has a pejorative meaning. In miniature, even if it were wellmodelled, the Arc de Triomphe would not be worth 41\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 42\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nmuch. Certain of Rodin’s famous works were reproduced in small scale; they were thereby impoverished. In the Middle Ages, some cathedrals, the day of their inauguration, collapsed. If they had been little, the fatal flaw in their construction would have remained unnoticed. Physical size is not moral greatness; while not the cause of greatness, it is, however, a condition for it. Large things are not always imposing, but imposing things are always large. With pantomime before him, the spectator feels condescending. He is crushed by sculpture, troubled by painting, exhausted by music and respectful of theatre. Mime must inspire in him the same consideration. It must be a didascalos [teaching play], serious and captivating, and not a childish diversion. To do that it must seem to live for itself, and not seem to explain itself. CF: What do you think of theatre? ED: I think that it is an excellent literature for people who don’t know how to read; that the actor prevents us from imagining the hero, in his true glory, that [the actor] wants to bring back to life. CF: Will the art of mime succeed in becoming as intelligible as speaking theatre is? ED: To ensure this we must give it the same means: the same number of actors, the same talent in each actor and a residence as prolonged in mime as in the theatre. CF: Supposing your art absolutely ready, do you hope it will be popular? ED: The general public prefers an orator to a writer and an athlete to an accountant – they like heroes to prove their hearts with their muscles. They don’t like overwrought texts very much. CF: If one imagines the beauty of mime, we have trouble imagining that it can be varied. Wouldn’t it be monotonous? ED: When I was little I couldn’t understand that one could discover a new melody without stumbling into an 42\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 43\n\nREVOLT\n\nalready known one. Believe me, if one managed to control each part of his body as one wanted to, this body would offer us infinite combinations. CF: As soon as one seeks to make of the art of mime no longer a show for a particular occasion, whose success comes perhaps from the special talents of the individual performer who gives himself over to it, as soon as one wants to have the art of mime become the foundation of one’s theatrical work, a regular show, this question presents itself: will the average artist be able to practise this art form? ED: I think so, because the greater the number of mimes on stage, the less genius each one needs. It is easier to perform a speaking play [with many actors] than it is for a lone actor to hold the stage for an entire evening with a series of poems. Mime is impossible so long as one refuses to do it, but not when one resolves to do it. CD: Can you speak to us about the training of a mime artist? ED: He must assimilate a special physical education. He must contemplate works of the art of drawing. He must get a certain musical training in order to make music flow in the veins of his muscles, and not in order to spread it around himself. The study of diction will be for him the beginning of the art of autosuggestion. CD: In short, for you, one must be an actor before being a mime. ED: Yes. [The following notes are of further ideas offered for the interview, but which were not used.] – A painting of a mime performance: Nude actor, bare stage, silence – nothing ‘up one’s sleeve’. An emotion comparable to that provoked by the imagined materialization of occultism, and this created by the suggestion of physical things. A narrator would say the nouns. 43\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 44\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nFigure 6 Figures 6, 7 and 8 Etienne and Maximilien Decroux in November 1947 in Ancient Combat.

When I imagine that I am director of a dramatic arts convent, where the students wouldn’t have anything other to do except learn their profession and where I would not have anything else to do but teach them, I would adopt the following as spiritual rules: 1. Teach the art of speaking along with gymnastics. Thus, exclude for a short while the study of mime, at first. Since for modern man, words were the most natural method of expression, the art of feeling and expressing must thus begin by the study of texts. This life set in motion by the word tends to spill over into the body, and if that spilling over of life into the body very quickly comes to an end, it’s because of the inability of the actor. The actor’s body is a corked still in which life, poured in at the top, has no chance of circulating. Gymnastics not only allows one to do what one imagines – to continue, however one wants, a movement already begun; gymnastics has, in addition, the virtue of suggesting movement figures. A student who never studied mime, and who limited his studies to diction and gymnastics, would know threequarters of mime. 2. Ask the student to accomplish, including in the following order: corporeal mime, vocal mime, facial mime, through artistic expression, equally mastered and to arrive thereby at speaking theatre.\n\nGeneral attitude for the Method Give up trying to make a name for oneself in the theatre and film, as the obligations of this kind of life are more harmful 45\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 46\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nthan the benefits of prestige and material means they provide. All of this diverts us from the goal and puts off the task indefinitely. Prestige and material means are precious, but they cost too much to acquire. Steps for finding sleeping partners, subsidies, official appointments, outstanding roles, etc., take all one’s time and also occupy too much of one’s thought. One must turn one’s back on salons, on committees, on casting cafes, on utilitarian friendships . . . Give up all reformist methods. That is to say, those which consist of inserting mime into verbal plays. This heresy only discredits mime, guilty of stopping the verbal rhythm. Moreover, it confuses the issue and prevents one from assessing progress. Refuse any mime lessons to anyone who will not agree to undertake three years’ study of gymnastics. Refuse to put on mime performances without mimes – that is to say, putting a dancer here, a speaker there, a singer in one place and a group of gymnasts in another, adding in\n\nFigure 7 Maximilien and Etienne Decroux in Ancient Combat, November 1947. 46\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 47\n\nREVOLT\n\ntheatrical lighting, and all of it pasted onto a work of literature. There is more fundamental mime in the diction of a Lucien Guitry [French actor 1860–1925] than in the gesticulations of a student in a youth hostel [cultural centre] or in the cabrioles of a dancer.\n\n1.3 From the personality of Etienne Decroux . . . [Written early 1948, translated from the French by Sally Leabhart.] . . . a pronounced taste stands out for: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nBodily movement (sport, dance, circus) Statuary and architecture Rhyming poetry Philosophy or explication The nation (politics, religion)\n\nas well as an absence of: a need for music for music-lovers; of painting; of novels; of jewellery; of archaeology for itself; country life; the spectacle of Nature; a hostility towards mystery; a disinterest for everything which, because it speaks of private life and personal views, does not lead towards universal man, towards the salvation of humankind. From his Professional Activity, the following stands out: 1. From the age of thirteen to twenty-five: manual worker (masonry, plumbing, roofing, butchery, hospitals, wagon factory, restaurants, etc.). Having become an artist, he returned to his former profession of roofer for several summers, periods when his theatre was closed. 47\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 48\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\n2. Then, he becomes an actor in the theatre and in film, on the radio and television. 3. Little by little, he distances himself from these things while becoming more and more engrossed in the following things, to the point of making a new profession out of them: lectures on the philosophy of fine arts, public reading of poetry and the art of mime. In each one of these branches, he works against the mainstream. In lectures: against the arts of mixing. In poetry readings: against the custom of reducing the diction of verse to that of prose. In the practice of mime: against the use of the face and hands as instruments of expression.\n\n1.4 Autobiography of Etienne Decroux [Written early 1950 prior to his tour of Israel; translated from the French by Sally Leabhart.]\n\nChildhood For a long time, my father took me every Monday to the musical variety show that was known as the Café-Concert. This father built houses with his hands. He involved me in prolonged discussions about the just and the unjust. In our neighbourhood, he was the only one to have the ideas he had. He frequented a family of Italian sculptors. He washed my body in a completely natural way, prepared food, painted my throat [when I was ill] and, pensively, cut my hair. 48\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 49\n\nREVOLT\n\nSometimes, in restrained tones, he read poetry to me. So that none of his gestures might serve as a bad example, he watched himself. Thus he refused to shake the hand of a friend when [this friend] was drunk, because I was there. A nest blocked the rain gutter. He built a cage without a door, and hung it very high because of the cats. The sparrows were moved in without having to leave their bed. He put bird feed beside them, and the bird-parents came into the cage to carry out the service. When the first circus that I had ever seen left town, I must have been secretly crying. My father guessed as much, I think, for he caressed my heart with his voice. I looked at my father as one looks at a moving statue. Thus: Music Hall, Morality, Heresy, Poetry, Pantheism, Circus, Sculpture and Fatherhood leading the soul back to its roots. . . And that is how I became cultivated.\n\nYouth Until my twenty-fifth year, I worked mostly in construction, but I took on a lot of other things. I remember having been a painter, plumber, mason, roofer, butcher, navvy, dock worker, wagon repairman, dishwasher, nurse. I even placed rubber hermetic seals on freezer doors. I made hay and harvested grain. You must not forget that in 1917 I was a second-class soldier for three years. You can imagine that in all the jobs I mentioned I was always third class. Even so, there were plenty of things to see! There are unfortunate people who have not seen anything of all this. I wonder how they manage to put a play on stage. These things, seen and even handled, have passed, little by little, to the back of my head, made their way down the back of my arms and arrived at the ends of my fingers where they changed my fingerprints. I enjoyed myself. I saw old-style pantomime, still alive and above all hardy, and its grimaces made me do likewise. I saw 49\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 50\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nsports. I saw in it the original form of dramatic art. I was nearly bowled over with admiration for it. Finally I attended a play. It struck me as being an art form that walked on its feet while looking up into the air. And that is how I became exalted.\n\nVocation At twenty-five, having saved enough to live a year without salary, I entered Jacques Copeau’s school. The echoes of Gordon Craig’s theories had reached it. There, students, with nude bodies, faces veiled, composed scenes without words. And that’s how I got pointed in a certain direction.\n\nApprenticeship At twenty-seven, having spent time with [Gaston] Baty’s [1885–1952] and [Louis] Jouvet’s [1887–1951] theatres, I joined the theatre of [Charles] Dullin [1885–1949] for eight consecutive years. And that’s how I got adjusted.\n\nProfession I acted in twenty-some films, took up my position at each microphone and took speaking theatre pieces around [France] on the train. And that is how I got bored.\n\nEarly career In the theatre, I had some success as Tchernozium in [Valentin Petrovich Kayayev’s 1928 farce about Soviet marriage and housing conditions] The Squaring of the Circle; as Trotsky in [François Porché’s 1931 play] The Tsar Lenin; and Captain Smith in Captain Smith. 50\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 51\n\nREVOLT\n\nIn films, I had some success as the hat thief in [Pierre and Jacques Prévert’s 1932] L’Affaire est dans le sac; as the father of Debureau in [Marcel Carné and Jacques Prévert’s 1945] Les Enfants du paradis; and as the Balkan conspirator in [Pierre Prévert’s 1947] Voyage surprise. And that’s how I thought I had taken off.\n\nSchool director I studied the art of theatre like no one ever has before. I devoured books and practised with the physical commitment of a manual labourer. I always wanted to test beauty by reason alone. I was obliged to analyse figures which I taught students so that they could repeat them. Little by little, I built up not only a doctrine but a pedagogy. In the theatrical tribe my classes quickly became famous and attended by only a few. Everyone came to me and left as easily. Among the names known in France, [actor and director] Jean-Louis Barrault [1910–94], [pantomime] Marcel Marceau [1923–2007], [actress] Maria Casarès [1922–96], [and Parisian theatre directors and company founders JeanPierre] Grenier and [Olivier] Hussenot attended my school. And that is how I became limited.\n\nTroupe director Slowly but surely, things fell into place. We gave performances of pure Corporeal Mime in the biggest venues in Paris: Palais Chaillot, Sarah Bernhart [now Théâtre de la Ville], [Salle de] Chimie, Cité Universitaire. In Belgium, we performed outside France for the first time; in Switzerland, we did two tours in the same season. And now we are negotiating with [sponsors in] the USA. In the meantime, we are on Israeli soil, full of History, full of the Future, where the Jews who are constructing their autonomous state welcome actors who are building theirs. 51\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 52\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nDoctrine The theatre will only be worthy of its name when those who act refuse to obey those who write. First, one must improvise without even knowing the subject. Thus: find a theme, then a second, then a third. One must, therefore, act in order to think.\n\nFigure 8 Etienne and Maximilien Decroux in November 1947 in Ancient Combat 52\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 53\n\nREVOLT\n\nBy putting into a logical order the ideas found in moving, a play takes form without any word breaking the silence. One finds the usefulness of words in doing without them. One will see that they serve some purpose, and that they do not serve much purpose. Little by little, decade after decade, a truly new dramatic art will arise as a tree grows, with the same slowness, with the same richness and as lasting. I have done things. Others will do them better, indefinitely . . . so long as I have done them well enough to put forward the idea that others will be able to do them better.\n\nBodily Presence [Article originally published in La Revue Esthétique, March 1960; translated from the French by Sally Leabhart. The French title, ‘Presencé en corps’, could be a pun, ‘en corps’ sounding like ‘encore’. The entire article, furthermore, rich in poetic alliteration and rhythm, often stretches grammatical rules.] One doesn’t write on human skin the way one writes on parchment. (Catherine of Russia) To have only his body as his material is for the artist a striking condition. The body is in fact remarkable and impossible to pulverize. It’s a pity. The advantage would be clear if, without killing this body, one managed to reduce it to powder or to carve it up into tiny cubes. These parts, too small to interest the eye, too uniform as well, would be arranged as one wished; then one would reveal to the world the arrangement of these specks concealed from the world’s view. No one is distracted from a painting by its ‘molecules’ of colour and even the freestones don’t distract us from the monument. You fortunate brothers of mosaic, of sculpture in stone or bronze, or glass, who have at your disposal 53\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 54\n\nTHE DECROUX SOURCEBOOK\n\nunremarkable particles, sometimes even invisible to the attentive gaze, and moreover all of them alike. The atom is the infantry soldier of the fine arts, except for mime. The parts of the body are very far from being particles. They differ from each other, we identify them; each of them as they show themselves announces its function to us; they are already completed works, they have a human shape. If creating means making something out of nothing, these things are quite troubling, for they are not nothing. The mime’s body seems to be something original intended to be a portrait. Thus we will only see the extra-human world through this human body. We will only see other men’s bodies through one actor’s body. We will only see the general through the particular, the abstract through the concrete, the future and the past through the present, the hidden via what is shown, thought via the thinker. And so: gas, rays, fire, colours, vegetal things, intentions, minerals, woman or child’s body, obese ones, long thin ones, things that grow, things that crawl or fall through the sky [tombe sur le ciel, literally, ‘fall on the sky’] an amputee and hunchback, things that last by living on through what succeeds them, things that imagine they are unique and live only as a plural, will be represented by the body of an actor as specific, as inharmonious, as inflexible as an ordinary man’s. To whom do we assign the responsibility of distracting one’s gaze away from the unfortunate form, unfortunate because it is immobile in just the place it should be offering variety through change? Who will make stone seem to flow? Movement takes on this mission because it moves lines from place to place. But this body, unable to change its form, is it only able to make movements other than its own? Our body is behind our eyes. That’s how things begin. Let’s consider what happens next. Thought is egalitarian and the body is not. If, even with this body, we only intended to represent the physical position and movement of our own body, artistically speaking, one obstacle would remain: the audience’s demand is that this body move evenly in space and time, whereas in this body the demand is to move only unevenly. 54\n\nDecroux-01-c\n\n20/10/08\n\n09:51\n\nPage 55\n\nREVOLT\n\nIn saying this, I am not referring to the fact that this body doesn’t articulate in all directions, at the knee and at the elbow, that we don’t have eyes in the back of our head . . . that our spine is not in the middle of our trunk. If, through grace, this evenness were granted to us as soon as we walked on stage, it would be a burdensome gift. Poetry is a thought for absent things. And yet the body is present. Art is an echo, a tamed accident, an arrhythmia in the aquarium of rhythm. Like those large brass vases embellished by the engraver, the body is ‘fi"
