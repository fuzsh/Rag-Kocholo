        "text": "AUG 28 - SEP 18\n\nTHEATER FOR THE NEW CITY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CRYSTAL FIELD\n\nPRESENTS\n\nDREAM UP FESTIVAL 2022\n\nTHEATER FOR THE NEW CITY SETS ITS ELEVENTH\n\nDREAM UP FESTIVAL AFTER A TWO-YEAR COVID HIATUS.\n\nAll events at Theater for the New City, 155 First Ave. (at E. 10th Street)\n\nAugust 28 to September 18, 2022\n\nFor Dream Up Festival tickets, go to: http://WWW.DREAMUPFESTIVAL.ORG – $12-$20\n\nFor additional info, call the TNC box office at 212-254-1109.\n\nPhotos of selected shows: https://photos.app.goo.gl/2ZcMkQty2PfkzmxK9\n\nINFO AS OF JULY 27, 2022 – SUBJECT TO CHANGE.\n\nFrom August 28 to September 18, 2022, Theater for the New City (TNC), under the direction of Crystal Field, will resume its annual Dream Up Festival, a feast of adventurous theater that had been suspended in 2020 and 2021 during the disruptions of Covid. The annual event is an ultimate new works festival, dedicated to the joy of discovering new authors and edgy, innovative performances.\n\nThe Festival is helmed by the theater’s Literary Manager, Michael Scott-Price. This year it offers 23 plays, 21 of which are world premieres and two of which are American premieres. Audiences will savor the excitement, awe, passion, challenge and intrigue of new plays from around the country.\n\nTheater for the New City has consistently been the most inexpensive theater of its caliber and it continues its commitment to affordable tickets with this festival. Dream Up Festival tickets are $12-$20 for all participating productions.\n\nThe festival does not seek out traditional scripts that are presented in a traditional way. It selects works that push new ideas to the forefront, challenge audience expectations and make us question our understanding of how art illuminates the world around us.\n\nMichael Scott-Price (Curator/Festival Director) has directed in New York City at venues including Chashama, Dixon Place and Collective Unconscious. He has written and directed productions that were presented nationally as well as in Canada, Ireland and England. Currently, he is also Curator of TNC’s “New City, New Blood” reading series and “Scratch Night” (works-in-progress). He is Artistic Director of an experimental theater company, Asteroid B612 Theatre Company, which made its debut in the 17th Annual HERE American Living Room Series in August 2006. He has studied at the School of Physical Theatre in London, England, at the Odin Teatret in Hostelbro, Denmark and in the International School Theatre Anthropology (ISTA) in Wroclaw, Poland with Eugenio Barba and company. He is an alumnus of Lincoln Center Theater Director’s Lab. He is a member of the Board of Directors of Theater for the New City.\n\nTheater for the New City (TNC) maintains a distinctive commitment to high artistic values and community service. In an effort to make theater accessible to all, TNC presents an assortment of distinct, exceptional events each year, including the Lower East Side Festival of the Arts, which celebrates the artistic and cultural diversity of TNC’s Lower East Side community; an annual Village Halloween Ball and an annual summer Street Theater tour that presents a free, live, original musical in thirteen neighborhoods in all five boroughs. Most of these are free of charge to the public.
