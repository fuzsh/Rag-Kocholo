        "text": "The aim is for each person, artist and/or teacher, to make the work their own, integrating psychological, critical and cultural studies.\n\nNo dogma: “Rules are made to confirm exceptions”.\n\nWorkshops, courses, tutoring are both advanced AND open to all. More a question of attitude, personality and risk-taking than of technical, musical or performance skills – all very welcome!\n\nFor many, it amounts to a hands-on post-doctorate. Dancers who want to include voice and text performance. Singers wishing to include extended voice ranges and movement performance. Psychotherapists, or anyone, wishing to explore the modes and implications of artistic ‘acting out’."
