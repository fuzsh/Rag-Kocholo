        "text": "The plays I examine in this book span several decades and attest to varied production contexts. Together, they have offered a window into undocumentedness. More than that, they have illuminated for me connections among law, performance, and identity. I hope my analysis serves to underscore the power of legal labels vis-à-vis processes of identity formation, both at individual and collective levels. Furthermore, I hope it points to the role that performance plays in both resisting and in policing the limits of those labels. I have found that theatre, as exemplified by many of the works I discuss, has the potential to confront audiences with complex questions that often go unasked in other media. Theatre can offer visibility and dignity to a depressingly large population that is dismissed in so many ways. Spaces that other scholars describe in terms of “shadows,” “darkness,” “invisibility” become, onstage, spaces to spotlight flesh-and-blood human beings. Throughout my study, I have looked for the ways in which turning nonexistence and invisibility into stageworthy performances can puncture nonexistence. While I therefore celebrate theatre that calls attention to and advocates for those in undocumentedness, I have also questioned how theatre production and scholarship perpetuate certain forms of exploitation."
