In a recent interview with TV Insider, Esparza opened up about his character's journey on the show.\n\nWhen it comes to if Barba will ever return to the show, he said, \"Never say never. You never know. Whenever they have a delicious enough storyline for Barba to come in and wreak some havoc, I’m sure that they’ll reach out. I like sort of where we left things, too. I like that messy, hard, painful, ouch ending with Benson and Barba. I was like, that’s good, right? It’s good television.\"\n\nRELATED: 17 Dramatic Benson and Stabler Moments on SVU We're Still Thinking About"
