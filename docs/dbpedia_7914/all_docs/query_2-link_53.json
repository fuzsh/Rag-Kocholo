        "text": "Introduction\n\nJennifer Hayward and M. Soledad Caballero\n\nExiled from the Palace\n\nOn October 9, 1824, alone in her suite of rooms in the Imperial Palace of Brazil, the travel writer Maria Graham packed her things. Her maids, quick to notice that the fortunes of this woman they had dubbed the second stranger were in rapid decline, had already deserted her. That afternoon, Emperor Dom Pedro I had ordered her confined to her rooms until further notice, except when called down to give the little Princesses an English lesson. As governess to the five-year-old Dona Maria da Gloria (the future Queen of Portugal) and her younger sisters, Graham considered herself far more than a language teacher: in her own mind at least, she was responsible for the princesses’ moral as well as intellectual development. After writing the Emperor that I should never have quitted England nor a family which is honorable even in that distinguished Country to be a mere Teacher of the English Tongue, she prepared to leave the palace.¹\n\nThe Empress Maria Leopoldina, considered the first stranger in the court and Maria Graham’s sole ally, heard the news and rushed to help her friend. In tears and ignoring Graham’s half-horrified, half-admiring objections, empress of Brazil and Archduchess of Austria as she was, nothing could prevent her from using her small white hands in packing books and clothes in short whatever she could find (Life ch. 3). Two privileged European women, unused to servants’ tasks, jumbled Maria’s things into her trunks. But the Empress could not stay long; she dared not disturb the Emperor’s routine. Maria finished her preparations alone, shared a scanty supper with one of Maria Leopoldina’s wardrobe women (the Empress had warned Graham not to touch food given her by the servants, due to an apparently justified fear of poison), and prepared to set out into Rio de Janeiro. She had nowhere to live, and few friends, since she had recently offended most of the English community by slighting them as incurious money-makers in her newly published Journal of a Voyage to Brazil.\n\nJust a year earlier, Maria Graham’s prospects looked much brighter, largely as a result of her own indomitable spirit. When her husband died off the coast of Chile, she defied the English community’s advice and expectations by remaining, alone and unprotected, in South America. She explored its flora, fauna, and culture, contributing to and correcting existing representations of the New World by Europeans. In the wake of Alexander von Humboldt’s accounts of South America beginning in 1805,² the continent acquired a powerful role in the European imaginary: it was constructed as a tropical sublime, teeming with raw materials ripe for European exploration and exploitation. Although shaped by this trope of the new continent in the European imagination, Graham also countered it, emphasizing the New World instead as a place of culture, communities, and commerce rather than highlighting only its natural wonders and landscape aesthetics. Graham made friends among Chileans and traveled through the country as much as her always precarious health permitted. But after nine months, having survived a difficult few weeks in a country rocked not only by a major earthquake but also by the threat of civil war, she fled for the comparative stability of Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, she found herself unexpectedly honored by a prestigious offer: the Empress Maria Leopoldina asked her to accept the position of governess to their eldest child, Princess Maria da Gloria, then just four years old.\n\nMaria Graham, always conscious of status, accepted eagerly. Besides the obvious cachet of living in the Palace, she was not immune to England’s imperial ambitions—in fact, perhaps she was all the more anxious to further those ambitions because as a Scotswoman she had never felt entirely at home amongst the English. She dreamed of the moral and even political influence she might wield over the developing country: I confess that I was carried away by the notion of bringing up a person upon whose education and personal qualities the happiness of a whole Empire was to depend. I fancied what Brazil might be under a better government than any country but my own had ever enjoyed (Life ch. 3).\n\nAnd then suddenly, not even two months into her new position, Maria found herself ignominiously ejected from the Palace and separated from the two Marias, mother and daughter, whom she had already come to love. Despite the threat of a downpour, Palace courtiers conspired to ensure that no carriage was available to carry her trunks to her hastily arranged lodgings. The Empress had to intervene—ordering her own carriage—to spare the tubercular Graham the disgrace and danger of a long walk in the heavy rain. So her departure was as uncomfortable and undignified as hostile servants could make it. Not even the affectionate messages and packages sent by the Empress in the days after her exile could console her for the humiliation. After her return to England, Maria Graham never set foot in South America again.\n\nWhat could have happened in such a short time to bring about so much mistrust and misunderstanding? The story of Maria Graham, first governess to the first Imperial family in Brazil, is both individual and archetypical, radical and representative. As an early woman traveler who scripted plots for future women to follow, reshaping the few narratives already available for the solitary British woman abroad, Maria Graham’s story connected continents as she explored the limitations shaping early nineteenth century women’s lives. As a Scotswoman whose own narrative became intimately entwined—in ways whose Gothic twists ultimately proved her undoing—with the domestic life of the first royal family of an independent Brazil, she exposed the complex interactions of class, race, ethnicity, and national and cultural affiliations as they shaped international relations in the imperial age.\n\nMary Dundas to Maria Graham: Dislocations of Identity\n\nMaria Graham was born plain Mary Dundas near Liverpool on July 19, 1785, the daughter of George Dundas, a Scottish naval officer, and his wife Ann Thompson Dundas, an American emigrée. Her family embodied the complexities resulting from shifting constructions of national identity: both her parents crossed the Atlantic and spent considerable portions of their lives far from home (which, for Graham’s Anglo-American mother at least, was always already a displacement from her origins, her birthplace in England), and their lives reveal an uncomfortable familiarity with the dislocations and disturbances of the migratory class. Their daughter would continue their perambulations when, as an adult, she refashioned herself into the travel writer Maria Graham and journeyed to India, Europe and South America, writing well-received narratives about each location.\n\nIn 1793, eight-year-old Mary was sent south to a small town near Oxford, apparently due to her mother’s rapidly declining health; her father arrived home from one of his frequent long absences on naval business, and announced the plan to his wife. In her descendent Rosamond Brunel Gotch’s invaluable biography, which makes excellent use of family papers, an autobiographical fragment left by Graham vividly captures the child’s half-baffled perception of events:\n\nI saw that my mother had been weeping. She took me upon her lap and said several times to my father—I cannot, indeed I cannot bear it [. . .] Two or three days after, I saw the tall horse, Bob [. . .] and the pony also saddled, brought to the door. I thought my mother was going to ride, but I soon found that the pony was for me, and that I was going to Liverpool, but I wondered why my mother should weep so bitterly as she did. (Gotch 14)\n\nHer father carried little Mary off to Richmond, where she met her uncle, aunt and cousins, who pronounced her clothes unfit to wear, and I was hurried off to a warehouse, where [. . .] I was completely metamorphosed [. . .] This was my first, but by no means my last suffering in the cause of fashion, and created in me such a dislike of dress and finery as required years to overcome (Gotch 17). In her alien costume, the child was packed off to school. She never saw her mother again.\n\nIn 1804, eighteen years old and now known more elegantly as Maria Dundas, she accompanied her father (whom she had not seen since he left her at school) to Edinburgh to meet her extended family. In Scotland, she felt surrounded by her own kind for the first time since early childhood: whereas in England her schoolmates and her aunt and uncle in Richmond made her feel that it was a pity I was not a boy, for then my talents might be of some use, but no good ever came to learned ladies, that they were in general extremely conceited and unfit for anything useful, in Scotland she became part of an active intellectual community (Gotch 33). Nobody seemed surprised that she enjoyed reading, discussing ideas, and debating the nature of truth; in her uncle’s house she met leading intellectuals of the day, including Edinburgh University’s Dugald Stewart, John Playfair, Sir John Leslie, and Dr. Thomas Hope (Gotch 75).\n\nDuring her first year in Scotland she enjoyed an active social life, discussing moral philosophy in ballrooms and finding herself amusingly accused of wielding her learning to flirt with eligible young academics (Gotch 83). She must have discussed, among many other ideas, those of Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations (1776) which circulated widely at the time and proved influential not only in disseminating the doctrine of free trade, but in abolitionist critiques of slavery.³ During the following winter, confined to bed by her first attack of tuberculosis, she read widely: history, literature, philosophy. The following autumn, she was sent south again, to Richmond, for the sake of her health, but she never forgot her first taste of life among people as passionate about books and learning as she was herself.\n\nGraham began her travels at age 23 in 1809, when she sailed with her father and older sister for Bombay, where her father had been appointed head of the naval works at the British East India Company’s dockyard. En route she studied the literature, history, and languages of her destination with Lieutenant Thomas Graham, a young Scottish naval officer and third son of Robert Graham, laird of Fintry. She and Thomas married on Dec. 9, 1809, shortly after their arrival in Bombay; he soon had to leave her, first to join his ship, H.M.S. Russell, in Madras, and then in 1810 to command H.M.S. Hecate and later the Eclipse. Meanwhile she explored the country, keeping careful notes with an eye to future publication.\n\nOn returning to England in 1811, she became involved in literary work for the well-known publisher John Murray II. She also published her first book, Journal of a Residence in India (1812); it was well enough received to warrant a second edition, although the Quarterly Review commented condescendingly in an otherwise positive review that ‘The Journal of a Residence in India,’ by a young lady who probably went thither, like most young ladies, to procure a husband instead of information, is a literary curiosity which we are not disposed to overlook. ⁴\n\nIn the wake of the Napoleonic wars, a long peace led to near-desperation among the British naval officers lingering in port towns on half-pay, trying to make ends meet while hoping that family connections could produce a commission. Graham maintained her contact with distant intellectual and social communities via long letters. She wrote publisher John Murray to discuss editing work, books, and authors of the day, especially George Gordon, Lord Byron, one of Murray’s authors (when writing about Byron, Graham gushed in a way wholly uncharacteristic of her). She wrote her husband’s influential kinsman Lord Lynedoch, who was able to help both Graham’s brother and her husband to advance their careers. In 1812, for instance, she thanked Lynedoch for helping Thomas to obtain the post of Captain to the ship Laurentians; in 1813 she wrote, like a dutiful niece, to seek his approbation of her plan to join her husband in Halifax, where he had been posted:\n\nMy intention of going to Halifax will not surprise you I am sure, and I hope you will not disapprove of it for I am very jealous of your approbation. I would not go out with my husband nor would I cruize with him because when a man is on public duty I think the less he is led to consider his private and domestic ties the better, but as he is likely to be some years on the American station whether peace or war and as I have no tie to this country in his absence I feel it almost as much a duty as a pleasure to be the nearest to him that I can. And then—I have so long led a wandering life that the very circumstance of change is become agreeable to me especially as I feel no inconvenience from any kind of lodging or food.⁵\n\nBut she never did follow Thomas to Nova Scotia. His ship was wrecked and Thomas returned home; by 1815 they had moved to Broughty Ferry, Scotland, apparently for economy’s sake.\n\nIn letters to John Murray, she complained of isolation. Although she could see the College of St Andrews from her windows, she felt distanced from \"the nearest court of Modern Literature. Always passionately interested in politics, too, Graham went on to lament her lack of information about revolutionary events of the day; she told Murray that while you are listening to tales from Paris of oppressed people and King and spoiled galleries and humbled conquerors and imprisoned Emperors, in Broughty Ferry a weekly paper at most connects us with the news of the Southern world while local discussions [carry] one back only to times of violence and civil war and make one expect to hear more particulars of Huntley’s conspiracy, or of Mary’s [Queen of Scots] weakness and Knox’s hard justice. But,\" she concluded on a more optimistic note:\n\nWe have books and a garden and like all poor people plenty of occupation for our hands and even heads that we may live and not lose caste, which in this poor proud country where Montrose and Dundee are still in the mouths of the very people, is even more difficult than in most parts of the southern portion of the Island.—Our establishment here consists of our two selves, a sister of Graham’s, two women, two dogs—, and some poultry—and our cottage is large enough to entertain a friend so that in spite of peace—and half pay we are far better off than most of our brother officers.⁶\n\nBy 1819, Graham was out in the world again, traveling to Gibraltar, Malta, Naples, and Rome with her husband and their artist friend Charles Eastlake. While scanty evidence leaves us to guess at the purpose of this trip—perhaps Captain Graham was posted to the Mediterranean?—it resulted in Graham’s Three Months passed in the Mountains East of Rome, during the year 1819, published in London in 1820.\n\nIn 1821, Graham’s letters and other records tell us that her husband at last received command of a ship, the H.M.S. Doris, with orders to sail for South America to protect British interests along the coast; Graham accompanied him. She remained in Chile (much to the chagrin of the Anglo colony, which attempted to ship her back to England immediately) even after her husband died en route in 1823.\n\nHaving been offered the post of governess to the eldest child of the Emperor and Empress of Brazil in October 1823, she briefly returned to England to see her two Journals on Chile and Brazil into print and to gather teaching materials for young Maria. Remaining in England only seven months, she sailed back to Brazil in July of 1824 to take up her new post—but as we already know, she would be forced to leave the Palace just over a month later and under mysterious circumstances.⁷\n\nBy 1826, back in London, Graham continued with her literary work, compiling others’ notes and journals into Voyage of H.M.S. Blonde to the Sandwich Islands in the years 1824–1825 under Captain the Right Hon. Lord Byron, commander. In 1827, she married Augustus Wall Callcott, who was knighted in 1837, giving her—always so conscious of rank and precedence—her own title at last: Lady Callcott. In 1831, her longstanding tuberculosis resurfaced. After breaking a major blood-vessel, she remained an invalid for the remaining 11 years of her life and turned her literary attention to more sedentary genres: her famous children’s book Little Arthur’s History of England, translations, essays on art. She died of tuberculosis on November 21, 1842, at 57 years old.\n\nTravel Writing in the New World\n\nBy publishing well-received books about her travels to India, Italy, Chile, and Brazil, Maria Graham contributed to the surge of travel writing in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In many ways the methods and imaginative range of this stage in the development of the genre meshed with the conceptual and aesthetic goals of the Romantic movement. Travel literature located its ethos, in the words of Virgil Nemoianu, between a yearning search for the picturesque [. . .] and an effort towards ethnography (that is, almost the opposite: the attempt to integrate through an adequate discourse the values of a pristine and organic vitality into modern civilization) (166). Graham’s writing on South America, combining vivid descriptions, images paying homage to landscape aesthetics, painful portraits of slave markets, and detailed descriptions of everyday life, captures these contradictory impulses in early nineteenth century travel writing.\n\nWe tend to think of travel narratives as relatively raw texts: not much more than a sequence of events and descriptions, free from plotting and teleology. Many early writers reinforce that assumption by claiming that their jottings are merely faithful accounts of events as they occurred. The truth, of course, is that all travelers shape the stories they tell, choosing to highlight some elements of a particular voyage while downplaying or ignoring others; these scripts in turn help to shape the travelers’ experiences, so that all travel writing becomes at least partially an exploration of the interior landscape of the traveler. To this end, authors may adapt a novelistic plot arc to structure their accounts: perhaps echoing the Gothic novel, like Maria Graham’s Journal of a Residence in Chile, or perhaps following the masculine travel conventions Mary Louise Pratt dubbed monarch of all I survey.\n\nIn their texts, female travelers in particular often speak—directly or indirectly—to conventional restraints on their subject matter and tone, including the expectation that they avoid male topics like politics and adventure. Instead, women writers were expected to write within the safe confines of the domestic. Although early studies of travel writers often emphasized or unconsciously perpetuated dichotomies between male and female travel conventions, more recent studies have begun to question their rigidity. Susan Morgan, Elizabeth Bohls, Mary Louise Pratt and others explore sharp differences in the ways women’s travel texts were produced and consumed; at the same time these critics emphasize the ways female travelers self-consciously revised male scripts and strategies while working to create a space for the adventurous, independent female traveler. In this vein, Nigel Leask argues that many writers (including Maria Graham) actively defy the prescriptive feminine model sketched in Elizabeth Eastlake’s infamous 1845 review, Lady Travellers: that women writers should conform to the ideology of separate spheres by emphasizing the domestic or the picturesque. As Leask rightly notes, Graham’s literary persona, even in her first published book (her Journal of a Residence in India), refuses to be confined to the traditional women writers’ exclusive emphasis on domesticity, ranging instead through history, politics, religion, and science.\n\nWhen Maria Graham sailed for Brazil in 1821, she joined a vanguard of British travelers to South America. While European explorers had been charting the country since the sixteenth century, trade restrictions imposed by Spanish as well as Portuguese colonial policy (to be discussed in detail later in this introduction) meant that South America appears far less frequently in the great wave of late eighteenth century travel writing than continents more easily accessed by British travelers, for example India and Africa. Thus early European travel writers who described South America prior to the years of independence were, by and large, those merely making stops in the country en route to other locations or travelers granted special permission to journey through specific countries, as was Alexander von Humboldt, whose Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804 (with Aimé Bonpland) was translated from the original French and quickly became the standard work on South and Central America.⁸\n\nIn the first years of the century, the first large-scale history of Brazil was written by the Romantic poet Robert Southey, who blithely ignored the minor inconvenience of never having set foot in the country. In 1806, after a decade’s research and two short visits to Portugal, he modestly announced, On Portugal I am probably better informed than any other foreigner, and as well informed as any Portuguese (qtd. in Bethel, British 6). After Independence, British mercenaries’ involvement in South American naval campaigns as well as an influx of British merchants and explorers meant that British influence continued to expand.⁹ In his lists of British writing about Brazil, historian Leslie Bethel includes mineralogists, merchants, naval officers (and their wives), diplomats (and their secretaries), naturalists, clergymen and missionaries, doctors, newspaper owners and journalists, employees of railway and navigation companies, civil engineers, travellers and writers (British 8; note that Maria Graham, although she is probably the best-known and most enduring of this wave of writers, is here marked off in the parenthesis reserved for wives). By the time Graham set foot in Brazil, British trade was well established and travelers frequented South America, publishing their experiences with the explicit goal of increasing opportunities for British abroad—and, often enough, the implicit imperialist goal of disseminating British values and political systems.\n\nIn her South American journals, Graham plotted the course of her almost three years’ exploration along the edges of the continent. She accompanied her husband Thomas Graham on his assignment to take the ship Doris to safeguard British interests along the South American coast during the turbulent years of independence. After three months in Brazil, the Grahams headed for their next posting, Chile. But Thomas Graham was already weakened by a succession of fevers and battles with gout. As they rounded Cape Horn in frigid weather, he died.\n\nDespite offers of passage home, Graham refused to be packed onto the next ship back to England. Instead, after burying her husband, she rented herself a small house in the Chilean—not the English—part of Valparaíso, bought my roan horse Fritz, and proceeded to ride around the country, meeting prominent Chilean families and becoming embroiled in the wars of independence. Staying with Admiral Cochrane, commander of the Chilean navy, in December 1822, she survived a massive earthquake. With earthquake under me, civil war around me; my poor sick relation apparently dying; and my kind friend, my only friend here indeed, certainly going to leave the country, it seemed high time she follow suit, so when Cochrane offered her passage to Brazil—where he was heading to accept the position of commander of the Brazilian navy, since he seemed to have overstayed his welcome in Chile—she accepted gratefully.¹⁰\n\nHer Brazil journal, then, encompasses the first three and last seven months of her time in South America. The intervening 11 months are covered in her Chile journal. In the latter, she created herself as a Gothic heroine and plotted her narrative along a typically Gothic arc: beginning with her initial abandonment in the country, she traced her gradually increasing independence and paralleled her own story with a gradual transformation of Lord Cochrane into a Romantic hero. By contrast, during her interrupted and often difficult months in Brazil, she found no ready-made novelistic plot to shape her experiences.\n\nIn the first half of her journal, Graham describes her first experience of South America. As a result, she emphasizes its difference from Europe, its landscape, and her superficial impressions of its people. The second half of the journal provides more authoritative perspectives on these issues, but because she first landed in the country in 1821, Graham is able to offer remarkable insight into the political developments and social transformations leading up to Independence, as we will see shortly. In these early years too, Graham is the only female traveler to have published an account of her experiences in Brazil, so she provides a unique glimpse of domestic lives.¹¹ By contrast with male writers, Graham offers the advantage of a gendered insider’s perspective: men struggled to obtain entry into domestic spaces since custom isolated women from strangers—a custom male travelers despairingly dubbed Moorish.\n\nThus Graham’s precursor John Mawe (1812) and her contemporary Gilbert Mathison (1825) were rarely permitted to so much as see—much less converse with—middle- or upper-class women in houses they stayed in while travelling in the interior of Brazil; Mawe tells us for example that The few females we occasionally saw at any formal place generally secluded themselves on our arrival and during our stay; and, when they came near us by chance, they commonly ran away in as much apparent alarm as if they had been accustomed to be frightened at the name of an Englishman (153). Another contemporary, Alexander Caldcleugh (1825), complained in a similar vein that Brazilian society remained so closed to him that he rarely succeeded in so much as setting eyes on a woman of the middle or upper classes; ultimately he consoles himself, rather improbably, with the theory that Portuguese living in Brazil chose not to socialize due to reluctance to furnish their houses. John Luccock (1820) had better luck, probably because the presence of his wife and family gave him greater informal access to domestic spaces, but his perspective on the everyday life of a Brazilian household nevertheless remained oddly limited. His greatest insights involve such matters as the corpulence of women, which he attributes to the fact that they were seldom seen out of doors, except when going to mass. One of his few vignettes of domestic life describes a woman surrounded by slaves as too lazy even to reach for a glass of water, instead demanding that a slave place the glass in her hand (112, 113).\n\nOnly Henry Koster (1816) approaches Graham’s depth and complexity in his representation of everyday life in Brazil, probably because (as we will see shortly) his long knowledge of Portuguese language and culture and his personal introductions to Brazilians permitted him increased access and insight. Like Graham’s, Koster’s account is highly respected by Brazilians today for his detailed portrayal of their country in its first years. Although of an English family, he was born in Portugal (where his father’s sugar firm had a branch) and he grew up with, as he expresses it, the idiom of a foreign language [. . .] perhaps more familiar to me than that of my own (v). Yet despite his intimacy with Brazilian culture, as a male traveler descriptions of the domestic were not part of his expected repertoire; therefore his account does not convey the level of detail that we find in Graham’s journal.\n\nGraham’s first impression of Brazilian women comes one October morning in Bahia, just two days after anchoring off the city and a month after arriving in Brazil, when Miss Pennell (an English friend and the daughter of the British consul in Bahia, William Pennell) takes her on a round of visits to Brazilian ladies. The morning call was an established tradition in nineteenth century England, but Graham acknowledges, as it is not their [Brazilians’] custom to visit or be visited in the forenoon it was hardly fair to take a stranger to see them. However, my curiosity, at least, was gratified. Her curiosity seems to mean desire to observe Brazilians in their natural habitat, subject to an anthropological gaze that scarcely acknowledges the humanity of her objects of study. She expresses disgust at the disarray of their houses, lambasts their clothing, bodies, and hygiene, casts aspersions on their class status—and feels no apparent hesitation at the thought that these people might someday read her account of them.\n\nIn this early stage of her time in South America, Graham reacts in a typically colonial way to the unfamiliar mores she observes. While conscious that British clothing and habits may not be suitable in this very different climate and culture, she nonetheless clings to the notion that British styles are more civilized than lighter, looser dress. Louise Guenther develops an astute comparative reading of the British colony in early nineteenth century Brazil: as colonists struggled to maintain a clearly British identity predicated on difference from Brazilians, clothing became part of the signifying system distinguishing Self from Other. The British insisted on a visual contrast with their hosts, even when doing so required physical discomfort. In the orders they sent home, British merchants reflected their understanding that the clothing needed in Brazil was quite different from that appropriate for Britain; black cloth, for example, was absurd in a hot climate, so John Luccock rejected several bales of fabric for being ‘too gloomy for people who laugh at themselves. Let us have no drabs—we have no Quakers here. We want no dismal colours suitable for an English November [. . .] We live in a lively climate, and with people who love to laugh’ (qtd. in Guenther 18). Even while acknowledging its incongruity, however, British residents insisted upon good thick dark British wool for their own clothes. So Graham’s disgust at women who wore cool, loose-fitting clothing suitable to the climate reveals the process of colonial identity-formation.\n\nBetween Graham’s first and second visits to Brazil, her personal circumstances changed drastically. Oddly, this bipolar narrative structure allows a greater breadth than might otherwise be possible: Graham emphasizes the struggle for independence, contrasts with European civilization, and ethnographic portraits of Brazilians in the first half of the narrative, and she provides a more informed exploration of domestic life and personal engagement with Brazilians in the second.\n\nAfter spending nine months in Chile learning about its history and participating—to the extent a woman was able—in its Independence efforts, Graham returned to Brazil en route to England. When she landed again in Rio de Janeiro, on March 13th, 1823, Graham was newly widowed and ill with tuberculosis: altered, then, in both body and spirit. Since her husband died en route to Chile, too, she was no longer associated with the British navy and thus no longer restricted by the navy’s profession of neutrality—a constraint that had clearly irked her in the first half of the journal. As a result, during the second half of the journal, Graham is able to go anywhere and socialize with whom she pleases; she seems liberated to observe the country in a more immediate and direct way.\n\nHaving now passed a year and a half in South America, Graham understood its customs and culture more fully. Moreover, without the buffer of the British naval community, her self-consciously English identity was less strongly reinforced. Perhaps as a result, while Graham’s persona resembles the intrepid adventurer in the first half of her Brazil journal and a Gothic heroine in need of rescue in her Chile journal, in the second half of the Brazil journal she assumes the narrative persona that German critic Marie-Claire Hoock-Demarle has described as the exploratrice sociale (summarized in Pratt 160). Making a point of visiting cultural institutions including the public monuments, House of Assembly, museum, library, theatre, botanical gardens, arsenal, orphan asylum, and hospital, she also finds time to attend balls and visit country houses as well as an enghenho or sugar mill, where she observes the process of sugar cane production as carried out by slaves. Throughout her visits, she finds much to admire in Brazil, and she provides commentary on the country’s political, cultural, and moral future. She understands clearly that she witnesses times of enormous historical importance; therefore, during her second visit she immerses herself in Brazilian history in the newly created national library, so that her narrative can more accurately convey the political changes she describes.\n\nBy the end of April she has been befriended by Dona Ana, wife of Luis José de Carvalho e Melo. Her relationship with Dona Ana and her family marks a turning point in Graham’s narrative: before this close friendship with a Brazilian family, she emphasizes harsh judgment and cross-cultural comparison; after, she rejects the gleeful gossip and casual condemnation of Brazilians by the British community. With her entrée into the cultivated and educated de Campos family circle, Graham’s early view that Brazilian women are unintelligent, uncultivated, and slovenly begin to change. By contrast with the disgusting Brazilian women of the first visit, during the second visit she describes \"a very agreeable Brazilian lady [. . .] a regular Brazilian bas-blue in the person of Dona Maria Clara: she reads a good deal, especially philosophy and politics; she is a tolerable botanist, and draws flowers exceedingly well; besides, she is what I think it is Miss Edgeworth calls ‘a fetcher and carrier of bays,’—a useful member of society, who, without harming herself or others, circulates the necessary literary news. Intellectual pursuits are paramount for Graham, particularly in women, so this is high praise indeed. Shortly thereafter, Graham notes a difference in the way she chooses to spend her time: I have improved my acquaintance with my foreign friends; but of English I see, and wish to see, very little of any body but Mrs. May. Similarly, at a ball she avoids the few English guests to converse with some sensible and well-bred Brazilians, so that I was scarcely aware of the lateness of the hour, when I left my younger friends dancing at midnight. And she concludes with authority, after spending time with Dona Ana’s extended family, The family attachments here are quite beautiful; they are as close and as intimate as those of clanship in Scotland.\"\n\nEven as her own perspective changes as a result of increased understanding, the independent Brazil in which she landed on March 13, 1823, was likewise transformed from the Portuguese colony she had left months earlier.¹² Admiring the French and English furniture of a neat and elegantly fitted up house in Rio de Janeiro, all as different as possible from the houses I saw in Bahia, she comments, I am told that they are likewise as different from what they were here twenty years since, and can well believe it; even during the twelve months of my absence from Rio, I see a wonderful polishing has taken place, and every thing is gaining an European air. But has Brazil really changed so much in her absence—or has Graham been swept away by the political charge in the South American air as she became accustomed to a South American aesthetic? As the daughter of a North American émigrée and a Scot, she scarcely bothers to conceal her revolutionary sympathies; having seen independence in Chile firsthand, she seems dazzled by the glorious future Brazil has scripted for itself in the process of its own struggle for independence.\n\nIn the second half of her Journal, then, Graham begins to emphasize the unprecedented potential of this new land. She is pleased with the rulers who set the tone for the citizens, too: nobody is more good-natured than Don Pedro. And it is not only her relationships with individuals that have changed; in her view, the country itself becomes a prototype for European nations seeking revolutionary models. Of Brazil’s acquisition of the island of Maranham, for example, she notes approvingly, the first act of the new government was to issue a proclamation to the inhabitants of the province of Maranham, congratulating them on being no longer a nation of slaves to Portugal, but a free people of the empire of Brazil. Of Brazil’s new-scripted Constitution, she exults, astoundingly, that all Christians are eligible to all offices and employments; and I only wish older countries would deign to take lessons from this new government with its noble liberality. ¹³\n\nAs discussed earlier, Graham provides a richer and more detailed account of Brazilian domestic life than male travelers could do, and that is exactly what we might expect given the gendered conventions of travel writing. However, we would not expect another difference we see in Graham: she is more astute and more involved politically than many male writers of her time. Because of the constraints on writers, Graham is careful to provide the obligatory disclaimers before venturing into forbidden political territory, saying in her introduction (which is largely an historical summary intended to facilitate the reader’s understanding of the country’s present political situation) that she will not pretend to speak of political issues of the day with any claim to authority, since my opportunities of information were too few; my habits as a woman and a foreigner never led me into situations where I could acquire the necessary knowledge.\n\nAmusingly, however, within moments of landing in Pernambuco—her first port of call on her first visit to Brazil—Graham tips her hand. After telling us first that a canoe carrying two patriot officers (or supporters of Brazilian independence) arrived shortly after they anchored to ascertain [. . .] if we had come, as was reported, to assist the royalists, or if we would assist them, she notes how difficult it is for the politically involved to believe in the strict neutrality we profess. British naval personnel were strictly enjoined to neutrality, and as the wife of an officer, Graham was expected to conform to this expectation. Here, though, Graham’s use of the ambiguous term profess implies her own disbelief in that neutrality—an implication born out in the next paragraph, when she recounts a visit, the following morning, from the Royalist Colonel Patronhe, who asks that an English ship carry official Portuguese governmental dispatches to Lisbon. Graham comments, we felt glad that the strict rules of service prevented the captain from giving any such order to the master of the packet. It would be at once a breach of that neutrality we profess to observe, and, in my opinion, an aiding of the worst cause.\n\nAgain the profess, which here confirms that neutrality is an official policy rather than a personal conviction—and now she cannot resist also betraying her sympathy for the patriot, or revolutionary, perspective by stating her clear opinion that the royalist is the worst cause. In a letter written at this time to John Murray, who by now had become a close friend, she articulates her own views still more directly: \"I confess I wish our orders had been such as allowed us to take part with the changers for I have heard such things within 24 hours of the old regime that I am sure any change must be for the better. The packet sails tomorrow—if any fresh attack should be made tonight on Olinda or Recife I will write but I doubt it—I imagine our being here to protect the British property will awe both sides a little.\"¹⁴\n\nGraham clearly defies the prohibition that women not meddle in politics from the first pages of her journal—and the more she learns of Brazil and Chile, the more involved she becomes in the extraordinary political ferment transforming the New World. She was a keen botanist and appreciated the scientific importance of Brazil’s biodiversity—indeed, she even carried botanical specimens back to the British Museum and to William Hooker, later director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. But she found the social transformation even more fascinating, and in political terms, no topic—with the possible exception of free trade—was more loaded for British travelers than slavery.\n\nThe Historical Context of Slavery: The Anglo-Lusitanian Connection and Brazilian Independence\n\nAs we’ve suggested, when Graham travels to Brazil, she witnesses revolutionary changes taking place in the Portuguese colony. While these shifts predate her visit and continue after her departure, her travel narrative is a vivid account of the radical events taking place across South America as both Spanish and Portuguese colonies began agitating for independence from their European metropoles. Events in Europe, in particular the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, markedly affected the independence movements in South America and especially in Brazil. And when Bonaparte moves across the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal’s political landscape shifts dramatically and Brazil’s future is irrevocably transformed.\n\nBritain and Portugal had close political and economic relationships throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, well before Britain’s involvement in Brazilian independence. Leslie Bethel notes, Under treaties going back to the end of the fourteenth century England was also the guarantor of Portugal’s independence and the territorial integrity of the Portuguese empire (Brazil: Empire 3). By the eighteenth century, with the decline of Iberian power and the rise of British economic and political dominance, the British had established factories (that is, commercial houses) in the Iberian peninsula. England had become a major carrier for the Iberian nations and virtually held Portugal as an economic colony (Liss 8). At the end of the eighteenth century, war between France and the whole of Europe forced Portugal even further under British control, as Napoleon Bonaparte demanded Portugal declare war against Britain or risk invasion. This French threat was not as daunting to the Portuguese crown as declaring war against Britain, which could easily lose Portugal its primary colonial possession, Brazil, since British naval power could control trade routes to South America.\n\nWhen Napoleon demanded that Dom João, Prince Regent of Portugal (after his mother, the queen, was declared mentally insane), close his ports to English ships, imprison English residents in Portugal and confiscate their property, or face the consequences of a French invasion, the Prince Regent, escorted by four British warships, moved his entire royal court to Brazil in 1807 (Bethel, Brazil: Empire 14). The royal party that crossed the Atlantic Ocean was immense and impressive. Not only did it include the immediate royal family, but members of the government, councils of state, justices of the High Courts, not by the handful but by the thousands. According to Bethel, \"between the morning of 25 November and the evening of the 27th November some 10–15000 people [. . .] embarked on the flagship Prince Real\" and headed for Brazil (Brazil: Empire 15).\n\nThe transfers of the Royal Court to Rio de Janeiro signaled a significant shift for Brazil and for Portugal. The viceregal capital since 1763, and in the late eighteenth century increasingly important economically, Rio de Janeiro overnight became the capital of a worldwide empire stretching as far as Goa and Macao (Bethel, Brazil: Empire 16). Ironically, this transfer, though intended to maintain the integrity of the Portuguese empire while under French threat in Europe, signaled an unalterable shift in Brazilian history. It allowed a colony to attain a central role in the continuation of the Portuguese empire. This rise in stature was further cemented in 1815 when Dom João declared Brazil a kingdom, equal politically to Portugal. Russell-Wood notes:\n\nThe decision to transfer the court to Brazil had been ill-received in Lisbon, although it was an inevitable expedient. Once the immediate threat of French occupation of Portugal had diminished, the continued presence of the king in Brazil merely fueled resentment already felt towards the colony by members of the Cortes in Lisbon. Recognition that the roles of the colony and the metropolis had been neatly reversed was bitter but unavoidable. The decree of December 16, 1815, whereby Brazil was raised to the status of a kingdom on a level with Portugal, did nothing to smooth the already ruffled feathers of the deputies of the Cortes. (Preconditions and Precipitants 35)\n\nBritish ships escorted the convoy transferring the Royal Court to Brazil; this protection allowed Britain to position itself at the center of political policy and trade in South America.\n\nIn January 1808, as a favor for British assistance in the Royal Court’s move across the Atlantic, Dom João opened the ports of Brazil to friendly nations. Russell-Wood argues, This was an event of momentous importance, transcending the arrival of the royal court and even the declaration of independence (Preconditions and Precipitants 34). The desire for this trading status between Brazil and Britain had in many ways been at the center of British calculations when escorting Dom João and his entourage to Rio. With this act, not only would Britain gain access to Brazilian markets, but this would also give it greater access to South American markets, still officially closed to British trade by a weakened but wary Spain that was embroiled in its own troubles with its colonies. Though it suffered the loss of its North American colonies at the end of the eighteenth century, Britain’s influence and role in South America grew as it was strategically situated to gain economic and trading ground, while also seeming to remain neutral in the conflicts between colonies and Iberian metropoles.\n\nPortugal and Britain signed the Treaty of Navigation and Commerce in 1810, increasing British access to Brazilian-Portuguese trade. As Leslie Bethel explains, these trade concessions fixed a maximum tariff of 15 per cent ad valorem on British goods, mainly cottons, woollens, linens, hardware and earthenware, imported to Brazil. Commercial concessions were not the only thing granted; British merchants were not only given the right to reside in Brazil [and] to engage in the wholesale and retail trades, but in addition the British government was given the right to appoint judges conservators, special magistrates responsible for dealing with the cases involving British subjects in Brazil. The treaty favored British subjects culturally and economically in Brazil; by contrast, it did little for Brazilian/Portuguese goods traded in Britain, which continued to be subject to exorbitant duties (Bethel, Brazil: Empire 19-21).\n\nThe opening of its ports and therefore its trade was not the only Portuguese concession given, if grudgingly, by Dom João. Even more significant for Portuguese/Brazilian and British relations was the separate Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, which dealt specifically with the question of abolition and the slave trade. Since the end of the eighteenth century, the slave trade had become a central issue, first of British domestic and then of foreign policy. Portugal, and in particular Brazil, the largest slave-holding and trading empire that remained, incited particular fervor for British abolitionists. This question of the slave trade came under the purview of the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship. Up to this point, Britain had been unable to attain many concessions from Portugal regarding the slave trade. After all, though slavery was abolished in Portugal in 1761 as was the trade of slaves beyond the Portuguese Empire, the slave trade remained intact in Brazil and territories (Bethel, Abolition 5). Indeed, regardless of late Enlightenment ideas about the dignity of man, Portugal’s economy and empire relied on slavery, and as such, even by its more enlightened thinkers, slavery and the slave trade […] were indispensable for the agricultural development of Brazil, where land was plentiful and labour in short supply, and thus for the prosperity and security of Portugal and the empire as a whole (Bethel, Abolition 6).\n\nHowever, in its weakened state at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Portugal was, for the first time, forced to give way to British abolitionist demands, at least on paper. In Article 10 of the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, the Portuguese government declared that it was fully convinced of the injustice and mistaken policy of the trade in slaves, and with the assistance of Britain would undertake the cause of humanity of abolition by adopting the most effective means of achieving a gradual abolition in all its domains (qtd. in Marques 10). What gradual abolition meant, however, was far from clear since Portugal retain[ed] the right to pursue the slave trade in areas of the African coast belonging to Portugal (Marques 10).\n\nFrom this moment, British pressure to end the slave trade in Brazil would be relentless and powerful. The transfer of the Royal Court to Brazil provided a rare occasion for increased social pressure on the slave trade. As historian Manchester notes, the most serious friction which has ever arisen between England and Portuguese America resulted from the attempts of the British government to suppress the slave trade. From 1808 through the century until slavery was abolished in Brazil (1888), the constantly increasing pressure which the London Foreign Office brought to bear in its effort to abolish the traffic caused such an intense feeling of resentment on the part of the Brazilians that friendly relations of the two countries were seriously menaced (159). And indeed, while Britain gained concessions from Portugal that it would, at least theoretically, restrict and ultimately abolish the slave trade, in the period between 1808 and independence the slave trade only increased. As Manchester notes, between 1808 and 1822 the British Foreign Office restricted the Portuguese slave trade on paper, but to carry those restrictions on to the total abolition of the traffic, or even to make them effective, was beyond its power. More slaves entered Brazil in 1821 than in 1808 (185).\n\nNonetheless Britain actively sought to curtail the trade from Africa to Brazil. After the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, British ships began energetically and, by official standards of the 1810 treaty, illegally restricting the trade. The Treaty of Alliance and Friendship was vague about the exact parameters of Portugal’s abolition policies, allowing wide leeway for interpretation. In the years between 1810 and 1813, the British navy restricted the Portuguese slave trade north of the equator, something that had not been agreed to in the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship. British abolitionist sentiment deliberately interpreted the 1810 treaty in a broader and more concrete sense, giving the Royal Navy the excuse to start policing the Portuguese slavers in transit on the Atlantic Ocean (Marques 37). Having defeated Napoleon, British power in Europe and on the seas was unrivaled, and it planned to continue leaning on Portugal to end the slave trade. The British Royal navy, having identified four anti-slavery cruisers for the explicit purpose of curtailing the Portuguese slave trade, intervened along the West African coast (Marques 37). This cost Brazilian traders in Bahia and Pernambuco heavy losses, but did not stop British demands that Portugal curtail and ultimately end what William Wilberforce called the infamous commerce. And though at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Portugal agreed to ban the slave trade north of the equator in return for a financial indemnity and reiterated its determination to bring about a gradual end to the trade, the slave trade would continue to be a source of friction between Portugal and England until Brazilian independence and throughout the nineteenth century, indeed until Brazil banished slavery and enforced it in 1888 (Bethel, Brazil: Empire 24).\n\nIn this context, a paradox emerged concerning the"
