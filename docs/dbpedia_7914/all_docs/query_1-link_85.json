But there was no possible outcome of this trial that could have had anything other than disastrous JULY 2006 and Israel has launched a series of murderous air attacks against Lebanon. Rivers of blood continue to flow through the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. In Afghanistan the Taliban is back in business. In Africa, one year after the extravagant promises of the G8 leaders to end world poverty, nothing has changed for the poorest people of the planet.

Independence itself then is analysed on the basis of secession theories with particular attention paid to economy, territory, negotiations between the British and Scottish governments, and referendum issues, and their embodiment into the discussion. The National Conversation debate is examined through the lenses of reports produced by the Scottish Government as well as Liberal Democrats and by the independent Commission on Scottish Devolution established by Scottish Labour, Scottish Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats.
