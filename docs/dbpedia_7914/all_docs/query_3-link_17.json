        "meta_description": "First president of the National Party of Scotland, Cunninghame Graham can be seen as a pioneer equally of modern Scottish Nationalism, of British socialism and of Scots anti-colonialism. In 2010 William Kenefick argued that the birth of radical-socialist and anti-racist politics there 'was disproportionately influenced by radical-left Scottish migrants who firmly adhered to the colour-blind principles of international socialism, industrial unionism, and revolutionary syndicalism'. Clearly the two most important political formations in Scotland outside and to the left of the Labour Party, across much of the late-imperial era, were the Communist Party and the Independent Labour Party. Some strong claims have been made for the Church of Scotland as a focus for anti-colonialist sentiment, especially in empire's last stages and in relation to central and southern Africa.",
