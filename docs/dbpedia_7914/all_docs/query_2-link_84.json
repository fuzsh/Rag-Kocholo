In consultation with the publishers, the editors have sought to present it in three volumes. This is done for practical reasons. Each volume is in itself of some substance. To publish all three in one volume might have produced an unwieldy and inaccessible tome, not so much weighty as burdensome. The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature in three volumes then is, yet, a single work. Each editor has taken prime responsibility for an individual period: Thomas Owen Clancy for up to 1314, Murray Pittock for 1314–1707, Susan Manning for 1707–1918 and Ian Brown for 1918 onwards. Nonetheless, it is the essence of our editorial process that every chapter has been considered by all editors. In other words, the conception and shaping of this History aims to avoid false time divisions, and to promulgate the understanding that Scottish literature is a continuous and multi-channelled entity from its beginnings – presumably well before the first remnants that survive from the first millennium – till the present moment. Similarly, it has sought to include, and give adequate representation to, wide varieties of Scottish literature, including that in Gaelic, Latin, Norse, Welsh and French as well as the Scots and English most commonly in the past associated with the term ‘Scottish literature’. It also includes, as appropriate, oral and performance literature and diaspora literatures and writers. Scottish literature is best understood as an inclusive, not an exclusive, term. This is a theme, both of intellectual discourse and architectonic structure, of The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature. In preparing this History, the editors have sought at all times to marry the most up-todate and rigorous scholarship with the avoidance of a distracting reference apparatus unsuited to the needs of the general reader. Each of the following chapters is, the editors hope, marked by both a high degree of accessibility and straightforward readability, and also by reliability and the intellectual rigour that comes from commanding knowledge gracefully worn. It is in pursuit of this aim of a balance of deep scholarship and ease of access that the three-volume format has been adopted. Although of course it is entirely possible for an individual reader to choose to focus her or his study on the volume that most closely meets immediate needs or interests, each volume will be most rewarding when read in the context and light of the other two. Readers of volumes two and three are therefore recommended to bear in mind the matters raised in the Introduction which opens volume one. This contains two chapters considering the nature and study of Scottish literature, one prepared by the editors, the other by Cairns Craig. Volume one continues with the first two periods of the History, up to 1314 and 1314–1707. Volume Two contains the period 1707–1918. Volume three contains the period from 1918 onwards. Each volume has its own index and list of contributors and so can be read as a coherent whole. The editors, however, make no apology for the\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nfact that each volume contains material that relates to years beyond its explicit period or for the many cross-references between volumes that are required for a full understanding of the material under discussion. Many necessary cross-references between volumes demonstrate the power of the continuity of Scotland’s literature. This is a strength of these volumes, and an essential premise of their underlying argument. This volume, in common with the other two, has within its period sections a standard structure. Each period has introductory chapters providing a historical, a geographic and a linguistic context to the period’s literature. There is also a fourth introductory chapter in all but the first period concerned with the international reception and literary impact of Scottish literature. Such a chapter does not exist for the earliest period because during that period so much of the literature under discussion is shared between the developing Scottish literary tradition and others. From 1314 on, as more coherent and conscious traditions of Scottish literature develop, so it is more possible to discern and trace their international impact. The chapters in this History relating to this impact offer, for the first time, a coherent picture, based on objective measures of levels of translation, of the powerful impression made by Scottish literature on other cultures. This grew discernibly over the centuries, but began with some éclat with the enormously important writings of Duns Scotus and, later, the often-underrated impact of George Buchanan on wider European culture, particularly the dramaturgic development of writing for the modern European stage. In each period, following these introductory chapters, a variety of distinguished experts addresses aspects of Scottish literature in a series of chapters; some focus on the work of individual writers; more consider the varieties of interaction of writers with one another and with their cultural contexts. Taken as a whole, these volumes offer the most extensive, the most various and the most inclusive history of Scottish literature available to date.\n\n1\n\nChanging Cultures: The History of Scotland since 1918 Richard Finlay\n\nThis chapter will concentrate on a number of key themes that have featured prominently in the history of twentieth-century Scottish society and, as such, have been reflected in much of the literature of the nation. First, the theme of economic change will be examined as Scottish society has been profoundly influenced by the depression of the interwar years, the managed economy of the post-1945 era and de-industrialisation at the end of the twentieth century. At the most basic level, this is an important issue as it directly affected the quality of life experienced by most Scots. Work in the male-dominated heavy industries, economic depression, poverty and unemployment, to name a few, have featured extensively in the literature of the nation. Such issues have had a profound impact on the development of Scotland’s political culture and this forms the subject of our second theme. Class conflict is omni-present in Scottish fiction since 1918 and has been responsible for much of the depiction of Scotland as a gritty, working-class nation. The period was one of social and economic upheaval, but this shaped the experiences of men and women differently and the issue of gender will form the basis of our third theme. The fact that much of the literature of the twentieth century has had a male voice has deflected attention away from the distinctive experience of women and this gender imbalance is now being addressed by a generation of female writers. Finally, in a volume examining Scottish literature, attention will turn to questions regarding culture and national identity.\n\nEconomic change In spite of Hugh MacDiarmid’s strictures that he did not give a damn about economics, the mixed fortunes of the Scottish economy have had the single biggest impact on the lives of most Scots in the twentieth century. At the risk of overgeneralisation, it can be said that the history of the twentieth-century Scottish economy has been dominated by the single issue of its transformation from one that was characteristic of the nineteenth century into one that was characteristic of the twentieth. Indeed, it might be said that Scotland almost skipped a century, in that its nineteenth-century economic relics (the traditional heavy industries of coal, steel, shipbuilding and engineering) soldiered on well past their sell-by date late into the twentieth century, only to be replaced by the service-sector economy that is more characteristic of the twenty-first century. Stalwarts of the economy of the twentieth century (the petrol engine, the motor car, the mass-produced consumer durables, aircraft, super-tankers and the like) were not produced to any great extent in Scotland. In\n\n2\n\nRichard Finlay\n\nmany respects, if the nineteenth century was one of Scottish economic triumph, the twentieth century was one of missed opportunity and failure. The end of the Great War witnessed a transformation in the fortunes of the Scottish economy. An increasingly unstable world economy dried up demand for the traditional capital investment goods, such as ships, locomotives and engineering plant. This had a knock-on effect, hitting the coal and steel industries, which depended on the industries that produced these goods. In many respects the economy was like a house of cards, with demand from the international economy as the key prop in the centre of the stack. Once demand was gone, the rest of the economy would fall down as support for its elements collapsed. There were other problems too. The rise of Asian competition had a dramatic impact on the textile industries and changed political boundaries in Europe meant that the eastern European market for coal and herring were lost. Unlike the economies of the south of England, Germany and North America, Scottish industrialists stood fast, resolutely believing that things would pick up. There was no diversification into the new light industries that mass-produced consumer goods. The Scottish economy worked at under-capacity during the interwar era and things were made worse by the impact of the Great Depression in 1929. Companies moved their headquarters south, businesses amalgamated for protection and unemployment kept on rising. Some 400,000 were out of work in the early 1930s and contemporaries estimated that the scourge of unemployment affected one Scot out of three. Things improved only as a result of rearmament in the late 1930s as the heavy industries were re-flated to produce the materials of war. Yet, as most experts knew, the heart of the problem was an over-reliance on these industries and not enough diversification in the economy. The rhetoric of ‘homes for heroes’ was never realised after 1918. A royal commission of 1917 had recommended that there was an immediate need for about a third of a million new homes to tackle Scotland’s endemic overcrowding. The statistics make for shocking reading. Overcrowding was six times greater than England and infant mortality rates a third higher. Poor housing was seen as the single biggest factor in contributing to the nation’s health problems. In spite of the 1924 Housing Act, passed by the minority Labour government, new building failed to keep pace with dilapidation of old stock. The economic climate of the interwar era did not help. Unemployment was the single largest factor in accounting for endemic poverty. Even before the impact of the Great Depression, it was estimated that there were 100,000 men who were surplus to labour requirements in the western central belt. Statistical national averages do little to convey the reality of unemployment. Its impact was concentrated and industrial towns such as Motherwell, Coatbridge and Airdrie were likely to experience levels as high as two-thirds. Areas with high rates of unemployment had high local government rates, limiting available money to tackle the social problems. Government cut-backs, likewise, affected housing and social provision. On the eve of the Second World War, a quarter of a million Scots were still dependent on poor relief. The advent of ‘total’ war in 1939 offered a way out of the endemic social and economic problems that had plagued Scottish society. A revolution in economic thinking now placed government intervention at the centre of economic policy. Whereas the orthodoxy had been that government could do little to stave off the impact of market conditions, the war had demonstrated that the economy could be ‘commanded’ to regulate production and ensure the maintenance of full employment. In an endeavour to mobilise the population, politicians increasingly argued that ‘never again’ would there be a return to the days of high unemployment when the ‘Guilty Men’, who had also appeased the fascist dictators, stood\n\nThe History of Scotland since 1918\n\n3\n\nidly by, wringing their hands. This new political idealism was formally enshrined in the Beveridge Report of 1942, which called for the creation of the Welfare State to look after citizens from the cradle to the grave. The opportunities afforded by wartime planning were seized by the Scottish Secretary of State from 1941 to 1945, Thomas Johnston, who was eager to use state planning and regulation to tackle the twin problems of poor social conditions and too little diversification in the economy. Such ambitions were enshrined in the Clyde Valley Plan of 1947 written by Sir Patrick Abercrombie. Yet, as often happens, the plans were not fulfilled in the post-war era. The heavy industries continued to flourish in the late 1940s and 1950s as a result of the demand created by the reconstruction of mainland Europe. Few cared, as there was full employment. Although slower to make an impact, the Welfare State increased housing provision and provided better health and educational care. The impact of government intervention became a staple of Scottish political faith and the period from the end of the Second World War to the mid-1960s was the high-point of belief in the Union with England. Yet, the hoped-for reconstruction of the Scottish economy failed to materialise. Comparatively, the traditional heavy industries were uncompetitive, and new industry failed to materialise without considerable government subsidy. Scottish economic productivity, wages and standards of living failed to keep pace with the rest of the United Kingdom. The more the economy failed, the greater the expectation that government would rectify the situation. Public expenditure was some 20 per cent higher north of the border by the late 1960s. Economic planning was increasingly compromised by political expediency as politicians sought to influence government expenditure to maximise political gain. The following examples help to make the point. The Conservative administrations of the 1950s were obsessed with meeting housing targets and, as a result, pushed through extensive tower block building programmes because this was the cheapest way to re-house the maximum number of people in the shortest time. The Labour governments of the 1960s pushed for the creation of an aluminium smelter and a paper mill in the Highlands, even though their economic prospects were not good. Likewise, the decision to bring car manufacturing to Scotland was done more for political than economic reasons. Successive governments poured money into the mining, steel and shipbuilding industries, even though most were clearly established as economic ‘lame ducks’. By the mid-1970s, levels of government intervention were no longer sustainable and coincided with a global economic crisis that followed on from the Arab–Israeli War of 1973. With an older industrial structure, a greater dependency on branch plant manufacturing and an underdeveloped service sector, the Scottish economy was ill-prepared to deal with the symptoms of the ‘British disease’ that plagued the economy in the seventies. Rising inflation and interest rates, chronic industrial unrest, government deficits and mounting unemployment all took their toll. When the Conservative government took power in 1979 with the pledge that it would roll back the frontiers of the state, the Scottish economy was precariously dependent on government support. Worse still, it coincided with another downturn in the economy. Removing the buffers of state support meant that the traditional industries that had characterised much of Scottish life since the midnineteenth century, such as steel, coal, shipping and heavy engineering, withered in the cold climate of the unregulated free market. In the early 1980s, Scotland experienced a rate of de-industrialisation that was similar to eastern European societies following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1992. By the early 1990s, Scottish society had been transformed. Its economy was led by the service sector, with banking and insurance emerging as two key giants. Tourism,\n\n4\n\nRichard Finlay\n\npetrochemicals and electronics completed the transformation. This change was not achieved without social cost. The 1980s witnessed high unemployment and low wages, and there emerged a so-called ‘underclass’, those who did not fit in with the new economy. Marginalised in large council estates and largely dependent on social security, this group evolved into a sort of society within society. For the majority, however, the period witnessed increased prosperity. Home ownership increased from one-third to twothirds and by the mid-1990s Scotland was on the European Union average for most socioeconomic indicators.\n\nPolitical culture The effect of such economic and social turmoil during the twentieth century had its impact on politics. The First World War fatally wounded the mighty Liberal Party, which had dominated Scottish politics before 1914. The rise of politics based on class was a consequence of growing tensions that had been unleashed during the war. Inflation and government control put pressure on workers who increasingly resorted to their own efforts to seek redress of social and economic grievances. The Rent Strike of 1915 resulted in a freeze of rents for the duration of the war and had been inspired by a popular revolt against the activities of rapacious landlords. It demonstrated to the working class that it could bring about change by its own efforts. Industrial militancy plagued the Clyde munitions works and government endeavours at regulation and control were cack-handed. Liberal claims to represent the interests of the worker took a further blow when they entered into a coalition government with the Tories in 1915. There was an increasing perception that the government was in favour of the bosses rather than the workers. The suppression of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 further compounded problems for the Liberal Party as the Catholic community, mostly of Irish descent, abandoned the Liberals, whose former pledges in favour of Irish home rule now seemed hollow. The Labour Party and the trade unions were growing in strength. The outbreak of the Russian Revolution and increased workers’ militancy at home caused a realignment on the right of politics. Just as the working class became more militant so did the middle class. The hard-line Tories appeared a better prospect for the defence of property than the wishy-washy Liberals. By 1924, after the Liberals had supported a Minority Labour administration, much to the chagrin of the middle class, Scottish politics was polarised between a working-class Labour Party and a middle-class Tory Party. The Liberals were squeezed out of the middle. Class conflict was exacerbated by the economic situation in interwar Scotland. The dislocation in the international economy meant that endemic unemployment was a feature of the traditional industries. The early 1920s witnessed unemployment riots over benefits and in 1926 class war broke out during the General Strike. Riots hit Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, but the most bitter conflict was seen in the mining villages of Fife. In many respects, it is possible to characterise Scottish society between the wars as one divided politically between a working-class, urban and west-central belt and smalltown, rural and traditional Scotland. Of the two, it was the latter that had most political success. The impact of the Great Depression witnessed the collapse of the Labour Party as the leadership and a chunk of the minority administration went off to form the National Government with the Tories and Liberals in 1931. Politically, Labour collapsed, but this was due more to the impact of the electoral system than a decline in the popular vote. The first-past-the-post system worked to the advantage of the National Government: in the\n\nThe History of Scotland since 1918\n\n5\n\ngeneral election of 1935, even though Labour was able to win 41.8 per cent of the popular vote, this was not reflected in the number of seats won. The legacy of the thirties as the ‘Devil’s Decade’ was one that would long endure in Scottish political memory. The National Government’s response to the economic crisis was that there was little that could be done and that things would only improve once the international economy picked up. Time and time again, politicians of all hues expressed their frustration with the government’s seeming impotence to tackle the endemic social and economic problems that plagued Scottish society. This was changed with the impact of the Second World War and the revolution in thinking as to the role of the state in social and economic regulation. The demands of what was now seen as ‘Total War’ meant that government had to command all aspects of economy and society. It was not long before many began to ask if the government could regulate on this kind of scale to defeat the fascist dictatorships, why not do the same in peacetime to deal with unemployment, poor housing, bad health and poverty, which were just as great a social evil? The wartime political consensus was based on the premise that the state would use its powers to regulate the economy and intervene in social policy to guarantee the welfare of all citizens from the cradle to the grave. In Scotland, such a shift in attitude was especially welcome, given that there was much for the state to do in terms of regulating the economy. Up until the Thatcher governments of the 1980s, the template of Scottish political success was determined by how much the respective political parties could screw out of the British state with votes going to the highest offer. Not surprisingly, when it came to the advocacy of a welfarist and interventionist programme, the left seemed the natural party and Labour began to pull ahead of the Tories in the mid-1960s, although the first-past-the-post electoral system distorted Labour’s lead in terms of the number of seats won. It was when Westminster was perceived as failing to deliver the goods in 1967 and the mid-1970s that the vote for the SNP increased. In many respects the issue of Scottish devolution in the seventies was part and parcel of a series of crises that engulfed the Labour government of 1974–9. Labour analysis of the rise of nationalism was predicated on the assumption that it was driven by social and economic discontent. Indeed, the Scottish Secretary of State, Willie Ross, often used the threat of an upsurge in nationalism as a means to wring greater concessions from the Cabinet. The solution to the rise of the SNP, it was believed, was to rectify the social and economic problems that fuelled the discontent in the first place. Once this was achieved, it was argued, the nationalist vote would evaporate. This tenet of political faith began to run into problems in the mid-seventies. First, government intervention was not proving adequate as long-standing problems still dogged the Scottish economy. Second, there was a major balance of payments crisis in 1976 when Britain went effectively bankrupt. An international loan was predicated on a commitment from government to cut public expenditure and balance the books. This meant that the old policy of throwing money at Scottish problems came to an end and there was a need for a new policy to tackle the rise of the SNP. Devolution was essentially a makeshift policy, although there were those in the Labour Party and the Trade Unions who had been committed to it for some time. The Royal Commission on the Constitution under Lord Kilbrandon’s chairmanship had reported in favour of constitutional change in 1973 and he later played a role in the ‘Yes’ campaign, chairing its launch on 26 January 1978. Without the resources to rectify the social and economic problems which were believed to be the fundamental cause of nationalist discontent, the creation of an assembly that would give greater power to the Scots, but stopped short of independence, was believed to be the most pragmatic solution available. Evidence\n\n6\n\nRichard Finlay\n\nthat protest was the main force driving the SNP vote can be found in the fiasco surrounding the devolution referendum of 1979. What it showed was that the Scots were divided fairly evenly on the issue of greater autonomy. The result was a three-way spilt between those who did not vote, those in favour and those against. It was not a ringing endorsement and the scheme collapsed in bitter acrimony between the SNP and the Labour government. In the general election of 1979, the Conservatives were returned under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher and the SNP vote collapsed. Anti-Conservatism emerged as the dominant theme of Scottish politics in the eighties and nineties. The Tory commitment to the free market and hostility to state intervention meant that the corporatist structures holding up much of Scottish society took a pounding. The Conservatives were blamed for the nation’s economic woes and this manifested itself in consistent swings against the party at subsequent general elections. Also, the electorate had learned to use tactical voting as a means to oust Tory MPs, who were reduced to a rump in the general election of 1987. One other result of the use of tactical voting was to enhance the Labour and the Liberal Democrat presence. Conservative unpopularity north of the border had little impact on the party’s political fortune as it was buoyed up by an overall British majority. Repeated rejection in Scotland did little to change Conservative policy and it reached its nadir in 1988 with the introduction of the Poll Tax one year ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom. This indifference to the electoral opinion of the Scots hatched a new political phrase, ‘the Democratic Deficit’. No matter how Scotland voted, it was argued, it would not change the fact of an overall Conservative British majority. It was in response to this seeming political impotence that home rule emerged as a means to circumvent the imposition of unpopular Tory policies. The establishment of the Scottish Constitutional Convention in 1989 as an umbrella organisation brought together the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, together with local government, the Churches and the trade unions, to act as a representative forum for the popular expression of the demand for the creation of a Scottish parliament. The SNP refused to participate on the grounds that it was hopeful that Conservative obstinacy on the issue would polarise the electorate into making a choice between independence or Tory-dominated Unionism. The Convention laid down the template for the future Scottish parliament and resolved contentious issues such as the use proportional representation and a greater role for women. Following the election of a landslide Labour government, in September 1997 the Scots voted overwhelmingly in a referendum for their own parliament with tax-raising powers. Following the Scotland Act of 1998, the parliament was convened (or as Winifred Ewing, chairing its first meeting, put it, ‘re-convened’) in July 1999 and moved into its own building at Holyrood in 2004. Like many public buildings, it had run over budget and was delayed, but praise for its architectural qualities has been fulsome and surely deserved. Both the Parliament’s formal opening in 1999, with Sheena Wellington’s iconic singing of Burns’s ‘A man’s a man for a’ that’, in which those present joined, and the new building’s opening ceremony, highlighted by music from several Scottish traditions and Liz Lochhead’s reading of Edwin Morgan’s specially written poem, uplifted the public imagination.\n\nThe issue of gender Of all the great changes that have affected Scottish society, perhaps the greatest has been within the personal realm of family life and between men and women. Men and women\n\nThe History of Scotland since 1918\n\n7\n\nwere constructed for the best part of the century, that is to say that they were conspicuously moulded into being ‘men’ and ‘women’. This started from birth, with different attitudes adopted to the upbringing of boys and girls. Children born in the early part of the century entered into an unforgiving and hard world. Infant mortality rates remained shockingly high at about one in thirteen for most of the interwar period; a third higher than England and Wales and twice as high as the Netherlands. There was a cross-class consensus on the issue of gender conditioning. Working-class boys would be expected to enter a world of work that was hard, masculine and unforgiving to those of a ‘sensitive’ disposition. Middle-class boys would be expected to grow up as tough leaders of working-class roughs who would need a firm hand. Extensive beating was an effective way to remove awkward sensitivities and instil discipline and the Scottish language is well endowed with a lexicon of child-beating: leathering, hammering, skelping, tanning, hiding and battering, to name a few. A ‘successful’ marriage was what most parents wished for their daughter and the acquisition of the necessary feminine skills to attract a suitor were deemed a priority. Domestic skills for working-class girls and exaggerated femininity for the middle class were the norm. On entering the workplace, notions of masculinity were ruthlessly enforced and carried on after work in the pub and at the football match. Scotland’s overcrowded housing did not help matters either, with most men desperate to escape from the domestic environment. Women, on the other hand, had their gender identity reinforced by the communal nature of much of the child-rearing and housework. Apart from courting, it is true to say that men and women did not spend much private time together. The nineteenth-century notion of the division of responsibilities between men and women survived most of the traumatic changes of the twentieth century. The idea that men worked to support their family persisted throughout the Great Depression, with many unemployed men believing their masculinity was compromised and refusing to undertake part-time or unskilled work on the basis that it was demeaning. Furthermore, it was expected that in spite of men being idle, it was still the role of women to do the domestic work and, often, take on part-time work on the basis that it was not as demeaning for women. Mothers emerged starkly at the bottom of the family hierarchy during the Depression, often sacrificing their own welfare to put fathers and children first. Medical records show that women were more likely to suffer from stress and anaemia than men, suggesting that in terms of the toll taken on family life as a result of the Depression it was women who suffered the most. The limited advances that were made in the workplace during the First World War were cancelled out fairly rapidly. Trade unionists argued that the employment of women kept men out of a job and were used by employers on account of low pay, both of which, it was claimed, were detrimental to family life. The marriage bar existed in teaching and the civil service, denying married women the opportunity of advancement and promotion. Also, the family hierarchy was extended into the workplace. Most people worked locally, so that many worked with family and neighbours and the menfolk were able to use pressure in the home to ensure that the patriarchal hierarchy was unofficially enforced in the workplace. The Second World War once again opened up opportunities for women as a result of labour shortage, but this was not carried on to any great extent after 1945. Rather, there was an increase in the amount of unskilled and part-time work available to women, which grew faster as a proportion of the workforce and eventually overtook men’s by the end of the century. Changes in the economy provided more employment avenues for women. The growth in the service sector, retailing, branch-plant manufacture and social services demanded the labour of women. Yet, much of this work was for secretarial, unskilled\n\n8\n\nRichard Finlay\n\nassembly work and was often part-time. Evidence of the fact that talented women believed there was a dearth of opportunities in Scotland is to be found in the heavy rates of emigration for professional women. Sexist attitudes were ingrained in popular workplace culture. Even in the late 1960s, family planning clinics were not registered in many localauthority directories. Family life experienced fundamental changes in the post-war period. Increasing social and geographical mobility sounded the death-knell for the extended family as children moved away from parents. Contraception compressed the child-rearing years for women and most children grew up with siblings who were born within a few years of themselves. Divorce began to increase rapidly from the mid-1970s onwards and in the 1980s singleparent (usually female) families became increasingly prevalent. Without doubt, the opportunities available to women at the end of the twentieth century were much greater than at the beginning. Yet, although the position of women has improved over the course of the twentieth century, it is important to remember that it has also improved for men. The key issue is the question of relative improvement. In politics, there are a greater number of women, although this was a late development. In top private-sector jobs, senior civilservice positions and academia, women still lag behind men in terms of promotion. On a more mundane note, for all the endeavours of the Sex Discrimination Act, average pay for women is still less than men. In large part, this is due to the fact that most women workers are still employed in unskilled, low-paid, part-time work.\n\nConclusion It would be a mistake to regard the history of twentieth-century Scotland as one in which the rise of political nationalism is a dominant theme. Rather, nationalism makes sporadic appearances and only becomes significant as the century draws to a close. Yet, with the advent of the Parliament in Edinburgh, there is a tendency to see the history of the last hundred years leading to its establishment as a culmination. Ideas of Scottishness, and, for that matter too, Britishness, were subject to competing claims. The nineteenth-century idea of ‘Unionist Nationalism’ held that the Union was a partnership of equals between Scotland and England and stressed the role the Scots had played in the development of the British state and Empire. After the war, many of the tenets of this belief were brought into sharp relief and seemed to have lost their relevance in a more democratic society dominated by class divisions. Militarism was no longer as popular following the carnage of the First World War, emigration was a source of concern as population fell and the workshop of empire was in chaos. Increasingly, politicians told the Scots that they were dependent on the English for economic survival. It was in response to this crisis of identity that the writers of the Scottish Renaissance of the interwar years tried to recast Scottish identity and culture into a mould that was more applicable to the modern age. They wanted to address the big political issues of the day and were inspired by developments in other parts of the world. The couthy image of ‘Kailyard’ Scotland, they argued, should be replaced with something more vibrant and alive, rather than a pastiche of a shortbread tin. While leaving a successful artistic legacy, the Renaissance had little impact on altering contemporary attitudes to Scottish identity. Much of their plea for a revitalised Scottish culture fell on deaf ears. The role of the British state in improving the standard of living in the period after 1945 was crucial in bolstering a sense of British identity in Scotland. The Second World War had witnessed the extensive\n\nThe History of Scotland since 1918\n\n9\n\nuse of government propaganda to shore up British identity and the fact that half a million Scots were integrated with other individuals from the United Kingdom in the armed forces helped reinforce a sense of Britishness. The English were no longer stereotypes or caricatures, but serving comrades, and the fact that many Scots were stationed in England helped to introduce them to their fellow-countrymen and -women. The resentment of the 1930s gave way to sympathy as the prosperous south was heavily bombed during the war and made for a sort of atonement for the preferential treatment the area received from government. Radio and cinema, and from the 1950s television, further helped to promote a sense of Britishness. Only the press in Scotland retained a measure of autonomy, although devolved broadcasting from the late 1960s helped promote a greater Scottish presence on the airwaves. Traditional forms of community culture gave way to one that was increasingly global, commercial and individualistic in the post-1945 era, although the trend started earlier as the growth in cinema and spectator football demonstrates. The break-up of the inner-city tenements and the displacement of large swathes of the population to the new towns or the new city estates meant that traditional social relations began to break down and different ones were formed in the new environment. Distance meant that families no longer kept the same degree of personal contact, the hustle and bustle of the tenement gave way to the soulless estates where social amenities were in short supply. The advent of consumerism meant that individuals became the main focus of recreation. There were more things, and more money to buy goods for yourself. Society began to atomise as families stopped mixing with other families, and instead, stayed at home watching TV or going out in the car. Better housing conditions meant that teenage daughters and sons could withdraw into their own space of the bedroom, where their own consumerism of fashion and music held sway. The traditional seaside towns lost custom as the holiday-maker moved abroad to sunnier climes. Scottish moral certainties began to change as well. The Churches lost many of their social functions as they were passed over to the Welfare State. Church-going went into decline from the 1960s, with Protestant desertion rates higher than Catholic. Sectarianism lost much of its institutional support as the nationalised industries and the multinationals displaced the traditional industries that had employed discrimination in employment. The growth of local government and the rise in educational opportunity meant that Catholics were able to advance up the social scale without hindrance. Yet, bigotry retained its hold over significant elements of the community and, although increasingly ritualised at football matches, this did not make it less offensive. Scotland did not experience extensive non-European immigration, giving rise to the popular assertion that the Scots were more tolerant than the English because of a comparative absence of racism north of the border. Yet, the low figures reflect not so much Scotland’s racial tolerance, but, rather, the small number of its immigrants. The period from the late 1960s witnessed a remarkable growth in what might be called the re-discovery of Scotland that gathered pace towards the end of the century. In part, this was speeded up by the failure of devolution in 1979, which led many to turn to culture as an avenue for the expression of Scottishness, rather than politics as that was associated with failure. The experience of the Thatcher years, in which Britishness took on an increasingly Little Englander guise, exacerbated this process. Scottish literature expanded and was more confident. Scottish studies became more prevalent in the universities and Scottish issues gained a higher media profile. Changes in culture married with the political climate to propel the cause of home rule as the Scots chose to present themselves as a\n\n10\n\nRichard Finlay\n\ncivic society in contrast to the rampant individualism that characterised much of Tory Britain in the eighties and nineties. In this development, culture played an important part.\n\nFurther reading Devine, T. M. and R. J. Finlay (eds) (1996), Scotland in the Twentieth Century, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.

Land protest re-ignited in the Highlands. In the Lowlands, industrial unrest, fomented by the internationalism of Marxist-Leninism, centred on the shipyards of ‘Red Clydeside’. Scotland’s homes were not fit for heroes: diseases still killed 100 infants in every 1,000 live births. Only after a second global conflict was this geography to be fundamentally altered. From 1947, the emergence of widespread state welfarism allowed the reconstruction of Scotland’s urban environment, while new institutions and structural change reconfigured the organisation and management of the countryside. Technological advance and improvements to the overall standard of life mean that many Scots today will find it difficult to identify with the experiences of their grandparents. Although familiar trends rooted in regional and social inequality endure, the accelerated condition of everyday life that seems to characterise globalised society produces new geographies in, and of, Scotland. Although the look of the countryside has remained relatively unaltered, there have been pronounced changes in Scotland’s geographies of resource use, land-utilisation and landownership since 1918. True, agriculture still works its traditional heartlands: farmers grow arable crops on fertile soil in the eastern Lowlands and Fife; livestock graze fields on the mixed farms of Perthshire, the north-east, and south-west. True too, that swathes of the country’s north and west continue to be run as ‘traditional’ sporting estates, given over to leisure with gun and rod. Beneath such regional and local continuities lie more widespread shifts in the structure and control of the rural economy, and their impacts on rural society. The most significant trend has been the rise to prominence of state authorities, and latterly non-governmental organisations, as agents affecting the rural geography of Scotland. The state’s willingness to intervene in aspects of land management was first signalled with the establishment of the Forestry Commission in 1919. Treeless deer forests covered 3.4 million acres in the Highlands, and were the focus of trenchant criticism from those seeking resource redistribution. Trees offered one plausible alternative. Charged with creating a domestic timber resource, the Forestry Commission took immediate advantage of a depressed land market and the impact of death duties on the landed classes to secure substantial tracts of plantable land. By 1931, with holdings exceeding 500,000 acres, it had become the largest single landowner in the country. In subsequent decades the forestry industry achieved its economic objectives by introducing large-scale commercial afforestation and timber-extraction techniques. The policy of blanket conifer planting – popular in the 1960s and 1970s and applied with some abandon in areas such as Argyll\n\n12\n\nHayden Lorimer\n\nand Galloway – was heavily criticised for its negative aesthetic impact. More positively, the Commission was quick to recognise the amenity value of trees, and the possibilities for extending its organisational remit into nature conservation. The emergence of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943 signalled a preparedness to nationalise the country’s natural resources for energy production. From as early as 1896 opportunistic developers had taken advantage of plentiful water supply and steep relief to develop hydro-electric schemes connected to industrial plants in Foyers, Kinlochleven and Fort William. It was only in the political climate of national planning and economic reconstruction that systematic programmes of water-power developments were approved by Westminster. During the 1950s and 1960s lochs were dammed, glens flooded and river courses altered in over a hundred water power projects that stretched from the Mull of Kintyre to the Shetland Isles. The impact of ‘the hydro’ was not simply to change the face of the land. The provision of electricity to remote, rural communities altered irrevocably the rhythm and routine of social life. Yet, the failure to regenerate rural economies through hydro-electric power is an equally telling political legacy. The state’s record of intervention over the redistribution of the nation’s land is similarly chequered. Feudalism has proven to be a remarkably durable system of land-ownership. The prospect of land-reform legislation was not seriously entertained until Scotland’s constitutional landscape was itself reconfigured in 1998. Eighty years earlier, servicemen returning from the Great War to the Highlands and Islands – where hunger for land, and congestion on it, was greatest – expected a radical programme to settle claims first made in 1912. Instead they encountered bureaucratic delay. Despite an increased budget and new powers of purchase, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland secured relatively little productive land for new owners. This inaction, combined with landowners’ continued intransigence, represented a blunt message for several thousands: out-migration was the only practical option. Scots followed well-established routes by sea to North America and Canada in particular, and over land to Glasgow. The geography of the absentee landowner, a consistent target of criticism, today has a more uncertain future. Community buy-outs by resident populations, sometimes in partnership with charitable organisations like the John Muir Trust, are shifting the balance of power. The example first set by the crofters of Assynt in 1993 has since been followed by purchases on the islands of Eigg, Gigha and Harris. The formation of national institutions for environmental management reflects a broader awareness of the state’s role in the conservation of land and water resources. The protection of floral and faunal diversity is evident in the work of Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. Their multiple designations of landscape have led variously to the creation of National Scenic Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Nature Reserves, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and in 2002 to Scotland’s first National Park – Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. Throughout the twentieth century, Scottish farming laboured at a low ebb. Between the wars, increased foreign competition reduced profits and the mechanisation of agricultural processes rendered large numbers of the workforce redundant. A short boom prompted by enforced self-subsistence during the Second World War could not mask long-term patterns of decline. Later decades were characterised by an increasing reliance on state support and, since 1973, substantial financial subsidies from the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy. With the North Sea fishing industry likewise subject to European regulation, the primary sector of the economy now accounts for less than 10 per cent of Scotland’s workforce. In Scotland’s modern agri-business, farmers work to intensive and flexible systems of cultivation and husbandry, directly answerable to multinational\n\nScotland’s Geography since 1918\n\n13\n\nsupermarket chains. A downturn in farm incomes by as much as 40 per cent in the last decade, and the prospect of further widespread subsidy reform, reveal an industry in crisis. If farm diversification into luxury products, organic foods and energy production offers new prospects, the future of the Scottish countryside is increasingly based around postproductive economics. Stewardship schemes offer farmers and crofters financial reward for maintaining a treasured rural aesthetic. Such impacts are social too. Local geographies of custom, celebration and identity still exist – most notably in the Borders and north-east – but now have reduced claims to importance and declining levels of participation. Depopulation is endemic in some geographically remote communities. Hill farmers are recognised as a social group especially vulnerable to mental ill-health. Yet, more positively, the last thirty years have seen a population influx into traditional ‘farming towns’: city commuters, tele-workers, second-home owners, retirers, and those seeking an ‘alternative lifestyle’ all now populate the countryside. Across the course of this period, more Scots could claim to know the geography of rural Scotland better. For a youthful interwar generation, geographical knowledge was very often the product of first-hand experience. Non-working weekends and annual leave presented the working classes with new opportunities to escape the urban sprawl of the central belt and explore the upland areas on its fringes. A modern transport network and new bus services were the motors for this mass movement. Cycling and hiking were a popular means to connect together the hostels run by the Scottish Youth Hostel Association. Established as a means to provide cheap and basic accommodation in remote locations, the SYHA network of 57 hostels had spread as far afield as the north-west Highlands by the mid-1940s. Each hostel provided a base for activities ranging from hill-walking and mountaineering to field-science and bird-watching. The provision of official camping facilities was one of the chief reasons for the Forestry Commission’s establishment of National Forest Parks in Argyll, the Trossachs, Galloway and Glenmore. Meanwhile, among the less conventional rock-climbing community, greater freedoms were enjoyed in the secret camps and rough howffs scattered across the southern Highlands. This broad social movement was at once radical and regulatory. For activists, outdoor recreation was an expression of class politics and inalienable public access rights. For moralists, it was an effective means to impose a model of responsible and informed citizenship among visitors to rural Scotland. New membership organisations like the National Trust for Scotland, the Association for the Preservation of Scotland, and the Saltire Society were instrumental in shaping a collective sense of belonging, responsibility and patriotism. Founded on a combined ethic of public voluntarism and patrician benevolence, Scotland’s new civic establishment advanced a significant, modern project: one of architectural and landscape conservation. In the Trust’s case, high-profile interwar campaigns securing ownership of specific areas (Glencoe), monuments (Glenfinnan) and buildings (a Hebridean blackhouse) were an acknowledgement that the nation’s geography was worth protecting as it became vulnerable to change. In subsequent decades, the purchase of physical and cultural landscapes pieced together an influential narrative of the nation for the nation. Visiting these iconic landmarks has long been a favourite of the respectable day-tripping family. Trust membership, which peaked at 110,000 in the 1980s, might itself be read as a tangible expression of Scots’ appetite for getting to know their small country. By the 1950s a short annual holiday was a treat that the average working family could reasonably expect. Geographies of domestic tourism centred on seaside towns and holiday camps. More affluent families went mobile, motoring with a caravan in tow.\n\n14\n\nHayden Lorimer\n\nThe representation of Scotland’s geography in print has been of considerable significance too. During the 1930s, travelogues and holiday reminiscences flourished as a pulp genre, and confirmed an imaginative geography of the nation centring on the Highlands and the Hebrides. Alisdair Alpin Macgregor and Mary Ethel Muir Donaldson were notable contributors, writing paeans for a distinctive people and proud cultural tradition about to enter a ‘Celtic Twilight’. The master among the travel writers was H. V. Morton. In Search of Scotland (1928) and In Scotland Again (1933) transported the armchair tourist and nostalgic expatriate on gentle odysseys along the byways of a romanticised old country. The advent of regional and national guidebooks presented opportunity for authoritative reports on life and landscape. The most popular – from the Batsford publishing house – combined the public’s appetite for geographical description with social commentary. Texts like The Face of Scotland (1934) and The Heart of Scotland (1938) were hugely popular. The interwar years saw the emergence of an altogether more high-minded and politicised literary movement that also found inspiration in rural landscapes and communities. Among the novelists and poets who came to be known, collectively, as ‘the Renaissance’ were committed, if unconventional, geographical commentators. For Neil Gunn, Hugh MacDiarmid, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, Naomi Mitchison, Fionn MacColla and Sorley MacLean, the vitality of rural life was both intellectual stimulus and political project. Novels, poems, reviews and essays spoke of the tyranny of industrial capitalism, and proclaimed land and language as twin resources for a revival in national fortunes. With socialist, communist and nationalist ideologies in collision, achieving unity of vision (far less collective action) was always unlikely. The literati fired few sparks of activism, and changed little in working lives, but in iconic works like Sunset Song (1932) and The Lost Glen (1932) crafted important depictions of changing regional geographies. Geographical enquiry itself professionalised. The establishment of teaching positions at the universities of Edinburgh (1908), Glasgow (1909), Aberdeen (1919) and St Andrews (1935) led to the formation of academic departments. Scotland’s geography departments instituted their own programmes of regional survey: Glasgow was instrumental in documenting and mapping crofting land use in the Hebrides during the 1950s; Aberdeen was responsible for an exhaustive survey of beaches in the north of Scotland during the 1970s. In his West Highland Survey (1945), Frank Fraser-Darling offered some of the most provocative research on Scotland’s geography from an ecological perspective. The period was also one of increased visual literacy. For those less inclined to read, Scotland’s geography was rendered visible – and increasingly colourful – in illustrated magazines, in film and on television. As local and national newspaper editors fastened on to the sales potential of the front-page beauty spot and the wall calendar of views, The Scots Magazine became an established home for simple photo-essays depicting Scotland’s scenic splendour. Certain photographers secured public profile through their work. Long before Colin Prior and Colin Baxter made wilderness a coffee-table aesthetic, the work of Robert Adam complemented written appreciations of river, ben and glen. The popularity of W. A. Poucher’s mountain photography – which spanned five decades – began in his Scotland through the Lens (1938). By the 1950s, the availability of cheap, portable cameras meant that framing landscape and sharing travel experience was an activity for all. For many Scots the moving image held still greater appeal. Cinema took Scotland – or certain imagined geographies of it anyway – to Brigadoon, plied it with Whisky Galore!, pursued it up The 39 Steps, searched for a Local Hero before finally finding one in Braveheart. The Films of Scotland Committee, brainchild of documentarist John Grierson, produced a range of short promotional films. Most relayed an up-beat message, focusing on different\n\nScotland’s Geography since 1918\n\n15\n\naspects of working lives, land use, industrial change and technological advance across the country. The advent of the television age, and Scots’ own love affair with the ‘box’, brought similar subject matter into the home. From 1976, in Weir’s Way a veteran of the interwar outdoor scene took his audience on tours of remote mainland reaches and island archipelagos. The Munro Show – Muriel Gray’s lively 1991 guide to Scotland’s highest mountains and to hill-walking – inspired many into active participation. The goal of bagging all 284 mountain summits over 3000ft is now a modern recreational phenomenon. Claims to know the nation’s geography are now made credible by many pairs of calloused feet. Whereas key changes to the rural realm were broadly structural and managerial in character, Scotland’s built environment was drastically altered during the twentieth century. In 1918, the housing stock in all four major cities and the largest burghs was commonly of the poorest quality. In the slum dwellings of Glasgow conditions were catastrophic. Outside the ‘single-end’, industrial pollution made life only a little less hazardous. Bad health, poor diet, alcoholism, high rates of infant mortality and a relatively short life expectancy were common characteristics in a geography of deprivation without rival across Europe. Wartime promises of ‘homes for heroes’ were slow to materialise as bricks and mortar. Local authority ‘social housing’, built to an expensive cottage design, represented a positive start but could only meet the needs of a few. In 1911, 12.8 per cent of dwellings had only one room. In 1936, 44 per cent of dwellings still had only one or two rooms; almost half of the population had no access to a fixed bath, and over a third still shared a WC. In his Scottish Journey (1934), which took in Gorbals slums and depressionhit Lanarkshire towns, the poet and essayist Edwin Muir traded only in home truths: his harsh appraisal of the nation’s urban condition was a sobering antidote to H. V. Morton’s giddy sentimentalism. Muir’s travelogue was equally an exposé of economic deterioration. Scotland’s industrial geography of proud regional specialisation – engineering and shipbuilding on Clydeside, jute in Dundee, cotton thread in Paisley, linen and coal in Fife, coal in the Lothians, wool production and textiles in the Borders – was to become its crucial weakness. The same global market that had made Scotland wealthy took advantage after 1918 of its structural frailties. Government-sponsored overcapacity, increased foreign competition, the return of the gold standard at pre-war rates, the growth of protectionism and new possibilities for product substitution posed serious problems for an export-orientated economy. Localised recession outlived the Great Depression of 1926 and resulted in an economic blight that required fresh approaches to job creation. The state’s recognition of specific needs – most immediately in Fife, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire – was reflected in the 1934 Special Areas Act, a pioneering step towards regional economic planning. By channelling assistance, investment and support into unemployment ‘black-spots’, government sought to boost economic growth. If the areas in receipt reaped short-term dividends, rearmament and the war effort allowed their embattled heavy industries and manufacturing base a longer reprieve. Geographies of the workplace also changed. New managerial and organisational regimes shifted the traditionally male, skilled workforce into increasingly unskilled jobs, while the employment of women radically altered the occupational profile. Occurring alongside urban change and population movement, economic restructuring and the relocation of industry affected the social fabric of the population for decades to come. Following the Second World War, a full-scale state-led response to the chronic housing crisis was a simple matter of necessity. Slum eradication was matched by new programmes of housing construction and an acceptance that compulsory re-housing would be necessary. During the 1950s and 1960s over 250,000 dwellings were demolished. The\n\n16\n\nHayden Lorimer\n\nWelfare State, in the shape of Scotland’s local authorities, created a replacement housing stock. In Glasgow, where entire districts had been condemned, vast municipal estates – Drumchapel, Pollok, Easterhouse and Castlemilk – arose on the edge of the city. In central belt towns like Airdrie, Kilsyth and Coatbridge, council houses made up over 80 per cent of the housing stock. New building reached skywards and extended landwards. Throughout the 1960s, high-rise developments were the planners’ preferred remedy for the housing shortage: one in five new dwellings constructed between 1945 and 1972 was in a building over six storeys high. Yet too often housing schemes and tower blocks were poorly conceived. They lacked appropriate amenities, services and proper transport connections to the city, and soon showed signs of physical deterioration. Difficult living conditions created a familiar atmosphere of alienation and disenchantment. Despite refurbishment and the occasional ‘patch-up’, those that remain are awkward emblems of social and architectural failure. After estates and tower blocks, new towns were the third component in Scotland’s changing urban geography. East Kilbride (1947), Glenrothes (1948), Cumbernauld (1955), Livingston (1962) and Irvine (1969) were built according to the experimental social ideals of modern planning theory. New residents, many from Glasgow’s ‘overspill’, inhabited a world far removed from the enforced sociality of tenement life. Andrew O’Hagan’s The Missing (2000) conveys, for example, the unsettling artificiality of new towns and the associated problems in re-creating ‘community’. Changes to residential design prompted a new domestic geography where family life was increasingly a private affair, and improved living standards allowed for the consumption of mass-produced goods and aspirations of car ownership. By the 1970s Scotland’s residential geography had been socialised: the state housed 57 per cent of the population. New towns, identified as growth poles, were the setting for radical transformations in industrial geography: based on light engineering, electronics, and food and drink processing; organised around the Fordist production techniques of the branch plant economy; supported by the Scottish Development Department; but directed by foreign companies. Strategic economic needs were carefully wedded to planning legislation and the evolution of regulatory controls. The arrival of American and Japanese electronics multinationals in the central belt during the 1980s led to a much-heralded but short-lived boom in ‘Silicon Glen’. Regional aid also extended to the Highlands proper with the formation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. In the 1970s, the north-east economy enjoyed unexpected economic prosperity following the discovery of North Sea oil. Centring on Aberdeen but extending as far north as the Shetlands, the oil industry swept a determinedly provincial region into global circuits of capital. Further south, the Ravenscraig steelworks, Monklands coalfield and Linwood car-plant laboured on as bastions of trade unionism, shopfloor militancy and industrial dispute. Yet by the time of Jeff Torrington’s The Devil’s Carousel (1996) such industrial worlds were only remembered places. The ‘new’ manufacturing industries have lasted a little longer, albeit they have been hit first by recession and then intense competition from cheaper labour markets in the developing world. Scotland’s current workforce reveals a spectrum from blue to white-collar employment. The service sector – leisure, tourism, financial and retail services – now dominates. Between 1982 and 2002, the manufacturing share in employment dropped from 23 per cent to 12.5 per cent. During the same period, jobs in services increased from 65 per cent to 79 per cent. Female participation rate in the economy has risen from 32 per cent in 1921 to 66 per cent in 2003, even if gendered wage differentials remain. Much work is now an\n\nScotland’s Geography since 1918\n\n17\n\noffice-based, and technology-centred, experience. It may be argued that there has been in recent decades an absence of entrepreneurial habits in Scotland. In any case, business formation (measured by VAT registered business per 10,000 of population) is much higher on the east than the west coast. In today’s Scotland, few goods are produced, but innumerable services provided. Whether this creates a new version of skilled labour in an information-based society is still to be revealed. Those mobile professionals attracted by Edinburgh’s new clustering of finance industries are evidently not the same as the 45,000 people who front the same banking and telecommunications interests in dispersed call centres. The footloose business ethos that celebrates corporate de-centring to the Western Isles, Kinlochleven or Bathgate – securing a cheap, non-unionised workforce – can all too hastily take the same jobs to India or eastern Europe. Whatever messages are drawn from this economic transformation, Scotland’s workforce is today an ageing one. The national population, having totalled 4.7 million in 1911, peaked at 5.23 million in 1971. Since then, figures have followed a gradual decline to 5.05 million in 2001 – the lowest total since the 1950s. Projections based on recent demographic trends suggest that the figure will have dropped to 4.8 million by 2026. Population decline has been most acutely felt in marginal areas: the Western Isles experienced a drop of 50 per cent between 1911 and 1971. And yet localised patterns of growth have also emerged: in-migration to Skye during the 1990s resulted in one of the fastestgrowing population rates in Britain. Births, which numbered 131,000 annually before the Great War, fell to around 90,000 during the economic hardship of the 1930s, rallied to 104,000 by 1964, then slowly dropped to 51,000 in 2001, the lowest total since records began in 1855. Scottish women today have fewer children and do so later in life. Scotland’s death rate reveals persistent problems of ill-health. Between the 1920s and 1980s, the annual figure was consistent around 65,000. The current total of 57,000 outnumbers births, and in relative terms ranks among the highest in the European Union. Cancer and heart disease remain the most common cause of death. In statistical terms emigration, rather than immigration, dominated the demography of the period. Until the 1960s the Commonwealth countries played host to thousands of Scots on the move; after this, employment opportunities in England acted as a persistent pull-factor. Levels of immigration, though small in number, have made a qualitative difference, creating a more multicultural society. Building upon the influx of Irish-born from the late eighteenth century and east European from the late nineteenth century, twentieth-century Scotland marks the first period when non-European ethnic groupings settled in considerable numbers. Migrants from the Indian sub-continent were numerous enough in the 1920s for small communities to emerge in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The end of British rule in 1947 and social disruption caused by territorial reorganisation in the north of India prompted more widespread economic migration. A predominantly Muslim migrant population continued to grow during the 1950s and 1960s with the promise of employment in British industries affected by acute shortages in the domestic labour market. Pakistanis, the most numerous group to take up the immigration invitation, found employment in Dundee’s jute mills and, along with Indians, on the bus and train systems run by Glasgow Corporation. Public acceptance of this willing labour force was by no means universal. Casual racism and prejudice encountered in the Scottish workplace forced many Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants into independent business, most often in the small-scale retail trade. It is from these difficult beginnings that a now influential constituency in today’s west of Scotland business community emerged. Meanwhile, the country’s first settled Chinese community developed\n\n18\n\nHayden Lorimer\n\nin Glasgow around 1960. Their arrival was prompted, in large measure, by the collapse of the agricultural economy in the New People’s Republic of China. Following a route established by many Pakistani migrants, workers from the rural New Territories of Hong Kong first arrived in English cities before electing to move north in search of fresh business opportunities. Restaurants were an especially successful venture tempting further arrivals from urban Hong Kong and district. More Chinese and Vietnamese people arrived in the wake of the Vietnam War, a movement signalling the continuance of an established geography of refuge in Scotland as well as one of economic migrancy. The persecution and forced movement of Jews by fascist regimes in continental Europe led to new arrivals in Edinburgh and Glasgow during the 1930s. There they joined those who had fled religious and political discrimination in Russia and eastern Europe in the last years of the nineteenth century. The tight-knit Jewish communities that formed close to the industrial areas of the two cities would later disperse into the suburbs and more widely across Scotland. The Second World War and its aftermath resulted in further waves of refugees and ‘displaced persons’ from eastern Europe. The most numerous were Poles, many of them single servicemen. The Polish Resettlement Act of 1947 was formal recognition of their contribution to the Allied war effort and secured employment in the building and mining industries where labour shortages had been identified. Many Polish refugees established themselves as independent businessmen – laundrette-owners, watchmakers, jewellers, cobblers and grocers – and married ‘native’ Scots. In the small Border towns where many would eventually settle, Polish social clubs continue to function. Political upheaval and repression in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda and Chile brought smaller waves of African, Asian East African and South American refugees to Scotland. In the twenty-first century, local humanitarian challenges are being set for Scottish society in its acceptance of refugees from different ethnic conflicts across the globe. Housing estates in Glasgow and Edinburgh are very often a first base in the new lives of Bosnian, Iranian, Kurdish, Pakistani, Kosovan, Iraqi, Algerian, Sudanese, Afghan and Somalian exiles, though perhaps not yet ‘home’. These international flows of people also speak of dual geographies: for the Muslim woman in The Translator by Leila Aboulela (1999) identity as an exile exists in both Aberdeen and Khartoum. More settled minority communities are represented by the second- and third-generation Asian-Scots who work as doctors, nurses and teachers. A better knowledge of other cultures has also been prompted through events that focus on national celebration. Scotland has become increasingly adept at, and increasingly reliant on, staging versions of itself. This geography of spectacle and performance – where national and civic identities are self-consciously put on display – inspired the 1938 Empire Exhibition hosted by Glasgow in Bellahouston Park. Revealingly, in this celebration of industrial prowess, technological innovation and modernist design, the most popular attraction was ‘An Clachan’, a mock-up of a Highland township. Here, casts of Gaels hired to dress in native costume and demonstrate rural crafts foreshadowed trends in contemporary heritage developments where the past is always ‘historic’, where identity is invariably ‘traditional’ and both are always on show. An Clachan confirmed the potential for creating a recognisable Scottish culture that could be marketed as a brand. That image matters most in the competition to attract visitors is a lesson that has been learnt in a variety of quarters. Whatever the reality of experience, whisky, castles, heather and tartan remain the currency that Scotland’s tourist industry seems happiest to trade in. Since 1938 when Glasgow took centre stage, the urban environment has presented more specific challenges for civic ‘boosterists’. The slow economic shift from industrial\n\nScotland’s Geography since 1918\n\n19\n\nproduction to cultural consumption has resulted in an extended crisis of identity for Scotland’s cities. Place promotion campaigns have emerged as an important means to push through programmes of physical regeneration, and to change public perceptions. Different cities have effected various strategies in selling Scotland to outside audiences. The continuing expansion of the Edinburgh International Arts Festival and Fringe continues to offer annual occasion for capital celebrations. The success of this ‘flagship’ event, and the need to launch extensive urban regeneration initiatives led to Glasgow variously exhibiting itself as Garden Festival City in 1988, European City of Culture in 1990, UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999, and the high visibility ‘Glasgow’s Miles Better’ campaign, 1984–1990. Dundee has followed suit with its waterfront redevelopments and rebranding as ‘City of Discovery’. In Edinburgh, the most obvious imprint of constitutional change is a new architecture of nationhood. The Scottish Parliament, located in Holyrood, and the Museum of Scotland are its signature buildings, while the administrative headquarters of devolved government are a focal point for extensive commercial and residential developments along the Leith waterfront. Rather than being directed by city councils and urban planners, these regeneration projects are increasingly reliant on the private sector. Service provision and new housing are financed through entrepreneurial opportunism, corporate capital or partnership agreements with the public sector. With each reinvestment programme, relics of the manufacturing base are either removed or given a post-industrial makeover. Consequently, new urban landscapes are dominated by retail, leisure and tourist spaces. The art gallery, museum, specialist shopping mall, sports stadium complex and concert hall are today’s indicators of cultural vitality and economic prosperity. In the face of global and domestic competition, Scotland now promises fashionable ‘city-break’ destinations for urban escapism and lifestyle experiences. In Glasgow’s case, this transformation can be sold as an economic success story: this former ‘Second City of Empire’ today ranks as fourth favourite location to visit in Britain, and the most important retailing centre outside London. For a significant proportion of Scotland’s urban population, changes to external image and urban fabric have not brought any appreciable improvement in quality of life. Complex social geographies of poverty and inequality – long familiar to urban Scotland – have certainly not disappeared. Deprived localities exist in all major settlements, with the most chronic social conditions experienced in areas of Dundee, Glasgow and its industrial satellites. In close proximity to the bustle of city-centre enterprise lie excluded estates where living is expensive yet residents lack access to basic services, and anything other than staple foodstuffs. Misuse of alcohol and drugs, theft and a fear of violent crime are connected to high levels of mental ill-health. Lone parents, older people and victims of racial harassment are among the most vulnerable. If these precarious conditions for living have become apparent to more Scots through the grim fiction of James Kelman and of Irvine Welsh, statistics drawn from indicators of poverty and social exclusion make for no less uncomfortable reading. The widening income gulf between the majority of ‘haves’ and a sizeable minority of ‘have-nots’ can be variously demonstrated. Almost 25 per cent of Scotland’s population live below the lowincome threshold. At least one-third of children live in households where social security benefits are the main source of income. The result is one of the highest child poverty rates in Europe. According to the 2002 New Policy Institute report Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion in Scotland, published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, no work had then been secured for at least three years in 210,000 working-age households: even for many\n\n20\n\nHayden Lorimer\n\nemployed, short-term, low-status and poorly paid jobs are the only option. Homelessness is a growing problem, and one not exclusive to urban areas. Over 46,000 households live in temporary or insecure accommodation. If all this constitutes unwelcome change in the geographies of social class – captured in the polarisation between a widening middle class and a stranded ‘underclass’ – then ensuring its disappearance through policies for greater social justice is one of most important challenges facing contemporary Scotland. So where stands Scotland’s geography now? Having secured self-government what notes might best summarise the condition of this small country in our increasingly globalised world? Cultural distinctiveness is commonly understood to be an early victim in this age of accelerated inter-connection. The uniform quality of Scotland’s retail landscapes and the consumptive lifestyles of Scots might render this argument persuasive. But identities do not simply disappear: they are constantly being forged anew. Today, geographers recognise how global circuits of capital, information and culture are locally experienced as both the same and different. Thus, contemporary Scotland is a place of complex geographies: some parts imagined, some parts remembered and some parts real. Two examples hint at this open-ended and diffuse geography. Thousands of people (many in North America) claim personal allegiance to Scotland. Very often this is on the basis of only loose ancestral affiliation, sometimes only through a claimed spiritual connection with the idea of Scotland. Meanwhile, the conservation of Scotland’s landscape – so consistently a staple of doughty Scots’ campaigning – has extended to the restoration of past environments that are argued to be more ‘natural’ and ‘national’. Species reintroduction and habitat prioritisation are taking the intensive management of landscape into a highly contested terrain, in just the same way as Tartan Day proclaims Scottishness on the world stage. Scotland’s new geographies are as local – and as global – as anywhere else.\n\nFurther reading Adams, I. H. (1978), The Making of Urban Scotland, London: Croom Helm. Dickson, T. and J. H.

Since natural languages – shared social tools – do not exist independently of the social organisations which produce them, this characteristic of modern society has, of course, linguistic implications. A wide range of languages is now to be found in the great conurbations of the central belt, brought by different groups of immigrants over the last century, from Italian to Urdu to Cantonese to Kurdish, but the dominant languages remain those which have existed in Scotland for much longer. Of these, the language that has a claim to be the longest established is the Celtic variety, Gaelic, which will be discussed further below. The most socially salient linguistic varieties currently existing in Scotland, however, derive ultimately from Old English, otherwise known as Anglo-Saxon. A variety of Anglo-Saxon, Old Anglian, was spoken by these invading peoples from the seventh century onwards in what is now southeastern Scotland. Over the centuries other varieties derived from Anglo-Saxon, alongside distinct languages such as Norse (the language of Viking invaders), French, Latin, Gaelic and Flemish, interacted to a greater or lesser extent with this Old Anglian material to produce, by the late eighteenth century, the modern configuration. Three such varieties are usually distinguished in present-day Scotland: Scots, Scottish Standard English (SSE), and English of the kinds spoken in England (sometimes, rather oddly, referred to as ‘AngloEnglish’). The last of these is spoken by English immigrants and some members of the Scottish aristocracy; more importantly, however, it is also encountered through UK-wide radio and television. This electronic presence within the speech community is now known to have a greater effect on the other varieties than has perhaps been recognised hitherto by linguists. Scots and Scottish Standard English are, nonetheless, more socially significant than Anglo-English. ‘Scots’ is the term used for the traditional urban and rural dialects of Lowland Scotland and such regions as Caithness, Orkney and Shetland, with distinctive characteristics in all levels of language: accent, grammar and vocabulary. Scots speakers typically retain pronunciations which have disappeared in England (e.g. undiphthongised pronunciations of now, cow etc., retention of the fricative consonant in night), and have distinctive grammatical constructions (e.g. went as a past participle, patterns of negation such as she isnae leaving) and vocabulary (e.g. thole ‘endure’, bairn and wean ‘child’). Some usages are of course shared with other varieties of English and may even be derived from Scots’ influence on them. Thus Scots youse ‘you (pl.)’ is also characteristic of New York English; traces of the ‘Scottish Vowel-Length Rule’, which means that there is a length-distinction in Scottish accents between, for example, the vowel in greed\n\n22\n\nWilson McLeod and Jeremy Smith\n\n(short) and in agreed (long), are also found in some Northern Irish usage; and Scottish owners of slave-plantations have given crabbit ‘angry’ to present-day Jamaican English. In the late Middle Ages, Scots was elaborated, that is available for most registers of language from court to kailyard, but it lost its overt prestige from the seventeenth century onwards as a result of extralinguistic, historical developments. Its current situation is complex; having considerable covert prestige in its own speech communities, Scots continues, like all living languages, to evolve. ‘Scottish Standard English’ (SSE) was first described by scholars during the eighteenthcentury Scottish Enlightenment, when it was seen as a ‘refined’ form of Scottish speech, purged of allegedly crude Scotticisms. SSE is sometimes defined as ‘Standard English with a Scottish accent’. This definition is broadly correct. Although there are some distinctive grammatical and lexical features (e.g. needs done for ‘Anglo-English’ needs doing; outwith in many places where Anglo-English speakers use outside or beyond), SSE is largely indistinguishable, but for these categories, from the Standard English used by high-prestige speakers in England, especially in written form. Yet, even official documents use SSE forms and constructions (e.g. depute for ‘Anglo-English’ deputy; furth of for beyond, as in permission for study furth of Glasgow). However, the SSE-accent is distinctively Scottish, albeit modified somewhat in the direction of the ‘Received Pronunciation’ characteristic of middle-class Anglo-English speakers. Thus, for instance, speakers of SSE (like Scots) operate the Scottish Vowel-Length Rule referred to above (distinguishing the stressed vowels in such pairs as greed: agreed, mean: seize), and rhyme the pair good: food, but (like Anglo-English speakers) use a diphthong in words such as now, cow. These varieties form not a set of discrete categories, but rather a continuum of usages. Many Scottish speakers – especially those whose social ties to their particular communities are weaker – will switch from Scots to Scottish English depending on the social situation in which they find themselves. Many, of course, cannot; a recent notable court case saw a Scots-speaker being ruled in contempt because of a failure to shift to a form of SSE deemed appropriate for the occasion (he said Aye instead of Yes). But it is notable that middle-class speakers in particular, a group notoriously mobile in social terms, feel the centripetal pull of overtly prestigious ‘polite’ SSE and covertly prestigious ‘broad’ Scots, and often ‘code-switch’ between the two, becoming more or less ‘broad’ in the use of Scots. Derrick McClure has made an interesting distinction between ‘dense’ and ‘thin’ usage of Scots features along the SSE-Scots cline, and this useful terminology chimes well with current views on linguistic categorisation, where forms and varieties are seen in ‘more-orless’ rather than ‘either-or’ terms. It will be fairly clear from the discussion so far that the linguistic relationship between Scots and English is a complex one, reflecting the complicated, dynamic, conflicted and nuanced nature of social relationships. Whether one speaks Scots or English seems to be a matter of opinion, often with a political significance. The government has declined to include questions concerning Scots on the census, although questions concerning Gaelic ability have been asked from 1881 onwards. It is thus very hard to produce any satisfactory statistics about the relative numbers of speakers of Scots and SSE. Indeed, a clear-cut and straightforward Scots/English division, a model which some might find ideologically satisfying in terms of ‘purity’, is simply not to be had; there are, instead, good arguments that the search for such purity is misplaced. Meantime, the situation of Gaelic, the longest-established language in Scotland, has become increasingly contradictory. Today all Gaelic speakers are also fluent in English, and almost all children acquire both languages in infancy; language shift from Gaelic to English\n\nThe Languages of Scotland since 1918\n\n23\n\nhas now reached all parts of the Gàidhealtachd, even the strongest island communities where Gaelic was the normal language of all generations until very recently. However, at the same time, through a process of changing policies and changing attitudes in the later twentieth century, Gaelic has come to enjoy greater status and institutional recognition than ever before, in education, media and public life. Following a long campaign, the Scottish Executive in 2004 introduced legislation to ‘secure the status of Gaelic as an official language of Scotland’. Gaelic remains far from secure, however, and the signs of death are still more perceptible than any signs of health. Demographic decline in speakers of Gaelic has continued almost unabated over the last eight decades, with the speech community contracting by nearly two-thirds, although the rate of decline has been slowed; and this diminished pool of speakers makes less intensive use of the language than earlier generations. In 1921, the number of Gaelic speakers stood at 158,779 (3.3 per cent of the Scottish population), with some 9,829 monoglots. It was already a minority language in most Highland parishes; in parts of the Black Isle, Kintyre and Highland Perthshire, the Gaelic-speaking population had dropped below 10 per cent, while much of Easter Ross, Badenoch and Strathspey had dropped below a quarter. On the other hand, most of the mainland to the north and west of the Great Glen, to say nothing of the islands, remained well over 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. Ten parishes, mostly in Skye and the Western Isles, stood at over 90 per cent, with Applecross, at 91 per cent, being the strongest Gaelic area on the mainland. By 1971, however, no parish reached the 90 per cent threshold, no mainland parish had a Gaelic-speaking majority, and the number of Gaelic monoglots had dropped below 500. Language shift began to affect different areas at different times, reaching mainland districts before the islands, south and east before north and west. Although detailed local studies are lacking, the dynamics of the process were generally quite similar: in many cases, there seems to have been a ‘tipping point’ at which parents in a particular locality stopped socialising their children through Gaelic, so that few children born after a certain point acquired Gaelic in the home, and the language slowly passed out of community use. In some areas, the First World War was the watershed, in others the hardship of the interwar Depression, in others the Second World War; in the Western Isles, the last redoubt of the language, English began to make serious inroads from the 1970s onwards, ironically just as language revitalisation efforts in the islands were gathering momentum. The 2001 census showed 58,652 Gaelic speakers in Scotland, a mere 1.2 per cent of the national population, down from 65,978 in 1991 (1.35 per cent) and 88,415 (1.7 per cent) in 1971. In the Western Isles, the figure stood at 59.8 per cent, but most of the rural areas returned more than 70 per cent and some districts more than 80 per cent. Outwith the Western Isles, the only parish with a Gaelic-speaking majority (55.7 per cent) was Kilmuir in north-eastern Skye. On the mainland, Lochalsh (at 20.1 per cent) was the only parish where even one-fifth of the population was recorded as Gaelic speakers. The overall rate of decline has now slowed considerably, however, and for the first time the proportion of Gaelic speakers among younger age groups has begun to increase. This trend reflects the impact of Gaelic-medium education rather than a reversal of language shift within the home, but is unquestionably a positive development all the same. As Gaelic has declined within the Gàidhealtachd, fewer and fewer Gaelic speakers live in traditional Gaelicspeaking communities and the Gaelic population has become increasingly national in its distribution: in 1921, almost 80 per cent of Scotland’s Gaelic speakers lived in the traditional Highland counties, but by 2001 this proportion had dropped to 55 per cent.\n\n24\n\nWilson McLeod and Jeremy Smith\n\nIncreasingly, then, efforts to promote and revitalise Gaelic, most notably through Gaelicmedium education, are Scotland-wide in scope, and the role of the urban Gaelic communities is recognised as being increasingly important. Due to the traditionally marginal role of Gaelic in the educational system, literacy levels in Gaelic are low. According to the 2001 census, only 67 per cent of Gaelic speakers could read Gaelic and only 53 per cent could write it; comparable levels of English literacy among the Gaelic-speaking population are probably near 99 per cent. Even so, many of those who can read and/or write Gaelic put these skills to use relatively rarely; the quantity and range of material published in Gaelic (particularly writing of an informal, ‘low-register’ variety) remains highly limited, although information technology, including the Internet and e-mail, may be increasing the importance, and diversity, of written Gaelic. As already indicated, over the course of the twentieth century, the Gaelic-speaking community became increasingly bilingual, educated in and surrounded by varieties of English, and by the end of the period many ‘native speakers’ of Gaelic could be better understood as English-dominant bilinguals. The linguistic role of the Gaelic churches, the traditional bastion of formal, high-register Gaelic, including abstract and intellectual discourse, has diminished a great deal in recent decades (not least since the use of Gaelic as a language of the pulpit has steadily contracted). Many Gaelic speakers lack confidence in using the language, especially in formal settings, although the ongoing expansion of Gaelic-medium education and the professionalisation of the ‘Gaelic economy’ may work to ameliorate this. Learners of the language have become more prominent, even if they still form only a relatively small proportion (perhaps 10 per cent) of the overall speech community. These diverse sociolinguistic developments, paralleled in the interaction of Scots, SSE and AngloEnglish, have had significant consequences for the Gaelic language itself. Borrowings of terminology and idiom from English have been an important feature of Gaelic for several centuries, but with universal fluency in English and the ubiquity of English-dominated mass media the rate of their introduction has accelerated considerably. In addition, Gaelic speakers make much use of ‘code-switching’, moving between Gaelic and English or Scots, within a single conversation for clarification or rhetorical effect. The impact of English/Scots phonology (especially in a west-central Scotland variant) has become increasingly evident in the Gaelic of younger speakers, ‘native’ and learner alike. Unlike many other languages large and small, Gaelic has never had a language academy or central body charged with corpus planning, the formal linguistic development of the language. Language reference books (dictionaries, grammars, style books and so on) are sparse and less than fully adequate. There have been efforts to standardise Gaelic orthography, but the absence of an agreed prescriptive grammar that accords with acceptable contemporary usage leaves many speakers uncertain as to what is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong’. In the absence of any specialist body responsible for the development of new terminology, many new words and expressions come into the language through the broadcast media and the schools. Lack of planning and systematicity means that some of these coinages are illogical or imprecise, and some speakers feel alienated by such ‘new Gaelic’. Given the interesting complexity of linguistic relationships in twentieth-century Scotland, it is no surprise that Scottish authors have found themselves attracted to engagement with language. As is well known, authors are ‘found artists’; just as Picasso could make a bull’s head from a bicycle saddle and a set of handlebars, so authors use the materials available to them – that is, language – for the effects they wish to achieve. Inventio, as the medievals knew, is a matter of discovery, not of originality. Some writers indeed, like Christopher Whyte, who are Gaelic-learners, have then come to write in that language as\n\nThe Languages of Scotland since 1918\n\n25\n\nwell as English, so extending their artistic range of expression, while some Gaelic first speakers work, as Iain Crichton Smith did, in both Gaelic and SSE. The Scots/SSE/AngloEnglish continuum can meantime be taken as comprising a key set of choices available for selection. With the important proviso that authors needed to develop written-mode methods for representing spoken-mode varieties, it is possible to describe their o"
