        "text": "1 1/2 pages 8vo, Devonshire Club, St. James's, 20 October 1916.\n\nCunninghame Graham writes in the midst of preparations for a trip to South America to E. Wrench urging continued (undoubtedly) political wranglings: \"... Pray excuse haste as I am making arrangements to return to S. America. Trusting you will \"stick at it\" and bring the matter to a head.\"\n\nCunninghame Graham lived his life with tireless energy, he was (among numerous other things): a great adventurer and gaucho in South America (who earned his fortune cattle ranching as well as the nickname 'Don Roberto'); a socialist Scottish politician (a Liberal MP in England; a founder, and the first president, of the Scottish Labour Party; a founder of the National Party of Scotland in 1928; as well as becoming the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934); a fencing master; a writer; horse trainer; gold-prospector (the list goes on). His friend and contemporary Joseph Conrad remarked, “When I think of Cunninghame Graham, I feel as though I have lived all my life in a dark hole without seeing or knowing anything.”\n\nThis letter (although the subject he refers to is obscured) captures some of the boundless energy and restless campaigning of his life.\n\nNear fine."
