        "text": "Introduction: The memoirs of the independence fighters, considered as mediated texts, have been used by Greek historians as one of the most important sources for the study of modern Greek history. These texts provide a variety of information for the study of the social and economic situation of Hellenism during the last phase of Ottoman rule in Greece, but also during the Revolution. The Memoirs would be worth mentioning as a supplementary material by the history teachers in the secondary education, with the ultimate goal of the correct documentation of the modern Greek History. Also, these sources offer, with brilliance, rich folklore elements of the Armatolian tradition and popular mythological ideas. Purpose: The proposed study is part of the social history of Greece during the pre-revolutionary and revolutionary period. Its aim is to investigate the image of boatmen and thieves, as presented in the work of Nikolaos Kasomoulis. The study of the Memoirs of the fighters of 1821 contributes to the correct understanding and learning of the aspects of modern Greek History by the students, as a supplementary study material in the history lesson. Methodology: The present study is based on the Memoirs of the fighter, Nikolaos Kasomoulis, as well as on relevant literature. First, we give a general picture of rural society, as it developed during the Ottoman period, as well as the Greek gunmen and thieves, who formed the army of the revolution. The research is based on scientific documentation of historical and folklore elements of the Greek tradition, as presented by Kasomoulis. For the most comprehensive and comprehensive study of the subject, we examine the individual issues related to the role of gunsmiths and thieves, before and during the revolution of 1821. Therefore, the study of the Memoirs of the fighters of 1821 by the students, brings important results in the understanding and interpretation of Greek history. Conclusion: Nikolaos Kasomoulis describes the events in an objective and impartial manner. Initially, his work presents the oppressive image of the Ottoman power, which led some brave men to flee en masse to the mountains of Greece. He also analyzes the gradual increase of thieves in the pre-revolutionary period, who were the main military corps of the Greeks in the revolution of 1821. These predatory groups, in collaboration with the armatoloi, were the \"yeast of freedom\". Keywords: Thieves, Armatoli, Greek Revolution, Memoirs, Nikolaos Kasomoulis.\n\nThe multiplication of inaugural gestures in William Vollmann’s The Rifles is, paradoxically, paired to a stubborn refusal to offer the reader a frame of reference within which it might be read. «Text», «book» or «dream» are as indefinite a characterization as could be wished for and, all we discover on the title page, is an enigmatic list of events standing in both for a generic tag and for a statement of the text’s argument. Such a strategy seems geared at dramatizing the crossing of this textual threshold while referring us back to the unadulterated, inductive activity of reading which alone is capable of reconstructing a narrative sequence from this allusive and disjunctive list. Yet, a certain degree of indeterminacy remains. In so far as it is generated by a writerly activity that is only hinted at by the phrasal verb “disassembled from”, this list cannot not merely be considered as a metonymy of the text to come. Must we not recognize that, depending on how we identify what has been disassembled, we find ourselves confronted to an array of possible readings each with its own methodology and objectives? Recognizing the impossibility of an a priori characterization of the text, we consequently turn to its composition as a guide for our reading. The importance of source material (whether archival or contemporary), the span it covers from quasi-documentary sociological sequence to personal testimony and its inclusion of graphic documents all suggest The Rifles’ proximity with the methodology of historical enquiry, distancing it from the literary. This epistemological preoccupation with facts and systems (as opposed to narratives), materialized by the title of this text understood as a programmatic, analytic concept, would announce the disassembly of the form of the novel as well as of the heroic and picturesque narratives of Franklin that could have supported it. This hypothesis would help to explain the strategic importance of paratext in the novel, as an ideal place from which this challenge to the literary might be made. In so far as it blurs the distinction between the referential and the diegetic, the paratext indicates metonymically that this text does not function as an organic whole but gestures towards a topical context, a pragmatic objective, a rational paradigm. It therefore comes as no surprise if Vollmann should choose this vantage to state what appears to be the purpose of the text, writing to the Makivik Corporation: \"Tell me if there is anything that can be done, anything that you are doing, that has hope of addressing these long term problems, and if there is anything that my readers (by and large, US and British people of average decency, without much real knowledge of the Inuit) can learn from you, do with you or help you with.\" (401) As is suggested here, the author literally intends to put the text to work, informing the reader of a repressed historical truth and hence hoping to convert the latter from a passive aesthetic bystander to a social activist. Yet, this optimistic call to action based on the reinstatement of fact seems to be undermined, if only by the very limited scope of the readership considered and the apparent indifference of the Makivik Corporation to Vollmann’s proposal. The idealism of this posture of setting the records straight is far more ambiguous than might have been thought at first. As we read, we come to realize that the possibility of historical discourse, and the action which is predicated on it, are challenged by an arctic space not merely hostile but utterly foreign to it. Not only is narrativity disassembled but also the possibility of fact, universal reason, causality, objects and documents. This chapter argues that the notion of “dream”, evoked in the title of the series, comes to signify not so much the vague ambition to re-enchant the bleak reality of the arctic world but to qualify this constant shuttling back and forth between systematic enquiry and narrative quest which exposes the common dream of agency and liberation at the root of the expeditions of both the 19th and 20th centuries: that western history might be capable of fashioning and redeeming itself.\n\nPreface: We libidinal economists! Daybreak, Version Square Root of 2. With this debut volume of Zētēsis, the artists, philosophers, designers, technicians and scientists involved with this project and committed to an ‘old fashioned’ kind of research – that which is generated by a curiosity and deep commitment to know (the whatever) – declare a new Daybreak. It is one that intends to take as a given, complexity and the irrational/imaginary in art and the sciences, physics and metaphysics, culture and its economies, skin and the pleasures of the flesh. It steps to the atonal rhythms of the mimetic patterns of camouflage and the flâneur. It aligns itself with the history of those who were (and remain) willing to ask and act upon this basic question: Supposing it could be otherwise, what would this otherwise look like, become, be, now? It is fuelled by experiment, rigour, and a willingness to risk. We owe a strong debt of thanks to our past and present-day interlocutors, from the genealogists, libidinal economists, feminists and queer theory/practitioners to those dancing in, on, and with this new field of ‘wild science’ and its old but very welcome co-collaborator, the sensual. We also owe a strong debt of thanks to those who were and remain willing to take a (financial) punt on this possibly awkward, possibly bruised, blue-sky thinking endeavour: The School of Art in particular and its wider platform, The Birmingham Institute for Art and Design at BCU along with the staff and student artists, designers, philosophers, technicians, web aficionados, research fellows and scientists who gave generously of their time, despite wider pressures cascading onto their already overworked work schedules. This is not a perfunctory acknowledgment to the School of Art at BIAD-BCU. For the academic, dare we say, intellectual world – and the universities that nourish its diversity, strident intelligence, playfulness and rigour – seems to have lost its way. This world, our world, challenged as it has been for the last decade or so with profound cuts in the arts & humanities, alongside a gluttonous appetite for all things STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths), and topped with a seemingly wilful misreading of what constitutes experimentation, thinking, practice, indeed research itself, especially when it comes to art, philosophy, social science and culture, needs a bit of TLC (Tender Loving Care). So the journal and its future offspring, comes with a warning: be prepared to think outside the proverbial box, and to do so, slowly and with care, as if approaching an untamed but curious beast. As an aid memoire, we dedicate this, the first volume, no. 1 to questioning The Cruelty of the Classical Cannon. Each intervention/ contribution / design decision has been carefully selected, peer-reviewed with members from an internationally and discipline-diverse advisory board. Some pieces support the classical cannon; others reject it outright; others try to reject it but are swallowed back into its hard to dislodge repertoire; still others get lost along the way. All have something to do with Nietzsche’s seminal text, Daybreak, Lyotard’s shout (demand), We Libidinal Economists! and the first discovered imaginary number, . It is up to you to decide which is which, and why. Welcome to Zētēsis: research generated by curiosity. Johnny Golding Editor\n\nThe acknowledgement of coal, iron and steam power not only gave birth to the renowned industrial revolution, but to a new eon of economic and social phenomena that would have been mocked by our medieval ancestors. These phenomena combined are what we now call modernity; the emergence of rationalization, the rise of the nation-state, capitalism, population growth and urbanization. It is dutiful to state that not all things “modern” bring forth joy or success. History books from the 1800s and to our day in the third millennium illustrate that along with technological advancement, came warfare, increased violence –with larger consequences than pre-modernity, considering progression also included arms-, routine and Franz Kafka’s worst enemy; Bureaucracy. The dark clouds that surround the earth’s atmosphere aren’t only the result of factory waste and fumes, but they resemble the mass depression that has diseased the generations, an emblem of development; sad, boring and unsatisfactory. Therefore, using articles from journals and books, this paper will compare one of modernity’s strengths to one of its limitations. In consequence of said comparison, this essay will reach its argument that modernity’s violence and injustice have far outweighed its virtues of technological advancement that aided vital fields of life such as medicine and communication. This research will commence with defining modernity’s concepts in depth, such as McDonaldization, rise of the nation-state and colonization. The second section of the paper will review the importance of modern technology in undiscovered fields of life, such as vaccination or surgical procedures in medicine, and the impact of modernity on transportation development and advancing communication technology. The third section of the paper will analyze modernity’s initial concepts in reference to the injustices and dehumanization that it has caused, in order to critically compare and weigh the benefits and deficiencies. Subsequently, the paper will conclude with a restatement of its thesis and a summary of all previously-stated points."
