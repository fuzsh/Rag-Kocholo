        "text": "The delight of hearing hundreds of wee speugs feasting, squabbling, socialising or whatever it was they were doing in the middle of a buddleia bush at the side of the River Ericht lifted my heart. I hope yours too.\n\nI’m proud to claim Don Roberto among my relations. Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham founded the Scottish National Party. He was a passionate advocate of independence for Scotland. His memorial at Gartmore is carved with the words “Famous author, traveller and horseman. Patriotic Scot and citizen of the world. He was a master of life – a king among men.” I really wish I’d met him.\n\nPLAY THIS EPISODE NOW.\n\nContinue reading “Don Roberto and the Four Fathers.”\n\nThey say the pictures are better on radio. That’s why I’m making noises for sound effects. I’m putting more sounds into By The Way stories. It’s all about helping to create the environment where the dialogue takes place and to immerse my listener in the story. I know it’s an indulgence, but here’s how I put together 14 seconds of audio to convey the horror of a gas attack during the Great War. The attack recounted took place at Reningelst on 18 April 1918.\n\nThe image is of a Gas Rattle similar to the one used to warn soldiers that a gas attack was underway. No one could blow a whistle while wearing a gas helmet.\n\nPLAY THIS EPISODE NOW.\n\nHere’s a bit of Extra Information about Hill 60 on the Western Front near Ypres. Hugh, the 20 year old Gunner Graham, was a Scottish soldier in the Royal Garrison Artillery who was awarded the Military Medal in 1918. This bit of his story is too good to bin. I’ve been able to include more of the fascinating research than would have fitted in the original script, which is why I dropped the scene. Here it is as an Extra Information short.\n\nPLAY THIS EPISODE NOW.\n\nContinue reading “Hill 60 on the Western Front.”\n\nGunner Graham was an extraordinary Scottish soldier in the Royal Garrison Artillery during WW1. He had just turned 20 years old when he was decorated for gallantry in 1918 with the Military Medal. The Medal represents a level of valour in combat only surpassed by that for the Victoria Cross. As an enlisted man Gunner Graham didn’t qualify for the Military Cross, which was reserved for officers at the time. Listen to the story of his medal and how he overcame the endemic discrimination of the establishment.\n\nPLAY THIS EPISODE NOW.\n\nContinue reading “Gunner Graham”\n\nAngus Adamson is an Arranach. He was born and brought-up on Arran. We recorded a conversation the last week I lived there and it was a delight to hear the story of his connection to the island, its people and how he’s served the community in one way or another all his working days. Angus has been a mechanic, a fire-fighter and a Church of Scotland Minister. There are only two characters in this story. You’ll hear only two voices – Angus and the island of Arran. Angus and I spoke in his front room, but the island speaks through the sounds of wild-track I’ve recorded in the environment over the years.\n\nPLAY THIS EPISODE NOW.\n\nContinue reading “Arranach”"
