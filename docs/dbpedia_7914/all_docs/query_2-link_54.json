Since Jacques Derrida' s Writing and Difference appeared in English in 1978, difference as post-structuralist differance, seen both as constituting and as problematizing meaning, has opened up and furthered enormous geographies of debate which have intersected sometimes awkwardly with considerations of how writing occludes, constructs, or distorts racial and sexual difference. 1 During the 1980s many of the most theoretically orientated investigations, and the criticism which followed them, seemed to be geared up to the study or implementation of what Gayle Greene and Coppelia Kahn call, in the title of their book, Making a Difference. 2 Nothing seemed more thoroughly investigated, more fruitful for English studies, or more fashionable. Yet there were also areas of difference which almost all the consciously theorized writing of that period, as well as the more traditionally orientated criticism, obscured or ignored in a gesture which, deliberate or not, curiously reproduced distortions perpetuated by traditional literary criticism or historiography. If in 1879 J. C. Shairp could write a volume on Robert Burns for the series English Men of Letters, edited by John Morley, without demur, then over a century later Hugh Kenner, a widely respected commentator, is capable of producing a book called A Sinking Island, where the 'island' in question is England. 3 Now, no doubt, if questioned, Shairp (a Scotsman) would have admitted that there was a certain comedy in calling Burns an English man of letters. Similarly, Kenner, as an American, might concede that, while American usage often uses the word 'England' loosely, it is not true that England is an island. l Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978). 2 Gayle Greene and Coppelia Kahn, Making a Difference: Feminist Literary Criticism (London: Methuen, 1985). 3 J. C. Shairp, Robert Burns (English Men of Letters Series; London: Macmillan, 1879); Hugh Kenner, A Sinking Island: The Modern English Writers (London: Barrie and Jenkins, 1988).\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nShairp, after all, was working within the constraints of a particular and prestigious series; surely it was not his place to question the appropriateness of the series title to the life and work of Burns. Kenner was writing a book which ignores Scottish and Welsh writing, so surely he should be free to simplify cultural geography by assuming that England's boundaries extend to Aberystwyth and john o' Groats. These points may seem pedantic, or the products of the type of unusually thin-skinned sensitivity which Hugh MacDiarmid mocked in A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle when he caricatured the sort of prickly Scots who wrote to the newspapers about 'regimental buttons or buckled shoon, I Or use o' England whaur the U.K.'s meent'. 4 Yet they are points which indicate a noticeable slipperiness in the use of the term 'English', the term which, among other things, labels, or fails to label, the academic discipline of English Literature. The implications of this slipperiness are wider than they might appear initially. Much attention has been devoted to the question of how we might define, select, or construct the entity known as 'literature'. Until very recently it seemed the word 'English' was left unexamined. In the teaching of English Literature, however, practical problems arose which questioned assumptions about its unitary nature. Most university English departments ran special courses on American Literature. Some also ran courses on Irish Literature, Caribbean Literature, Canadian Literature, Scottish Literature, or Australian Literature. Yet the teaching of these last tended to be confined to geographical areas. Few universities outside Australia run courses in Australian Literature; few universities outside Scotland run particular courses in Scottish Literature. For some, this may be a 'natural' position, reflecting 'obvious' matters of literary value. Scottish Literature might be taught as such in its country of origin, perhaps, but elsewhere it does not merit an independent status, and may be subsumed within 'English' Literature. The same could hold good for Australian Literature, but American Literature escapes such limitations. Is this a question of literary merit, or of American economic and political power? Questions of cultural authority constantly arise in discussions of 'minor' literatures, such as Caribbean or Irish writing, where there is a repeated and troubled interaction with Anglocentric values. Yet in supposedly 'main-line' English courses these issues are easily ignored. Figures as diverse as Smollett, Carlyle, Eliot, and Joyce are 4\n\nMCP, 95.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nseen too often as unproblematic parts of 'English' writing, with only token attention being paid to their subtly un- English difference. While some of the leading literary theorists have written on issues of cultural difference-one of the most prominent examples being Edward Said's Orienta/ism-they tend to concentrate on cases where the differences are most striking. The differences chosen may be those between Oriental and Western culture, or between Third World and First World culture-as treated, for instance, in G. C. Spivak's In Other Worlds. 5 Even when teasing apart the strands of that 'English Literature' whose unity is an illusion, the tendency is to concentrate on groups most obviously typified as 'other' than the white English male. David Dabydeen' s collection, The Black Presence in English Literature, is a fine example of a study of this type. 6 Far less attention has been paid to less immediately visible cultural differences within 'English Literature', or, if that attention has been paid, all too often it has been confined to academic ghettos-Scottish Literature specialists, or those especially interested in Anglo-Welsh writing. This is peculiarly ironic, because, as the present book argues, the Scots in particular were crucially instrumental in constructing the university subject of English Literature itself. There was a time in the twentieth century when it seemed that issues of difference with relation to smaller, 'provincial' cultures might find a major theorist to be their spokesperson. We now know that, as Lindsay Waters points out, 'The young Paul de Man was a cultural nationalist', concerned with preserving the complex, multiple identities of Belgian culture in time of war, and deeply interested in then-fashionable ideas about the relationship between literature and national identity. 7 The wartime journalism which de Man produced shows, among other things, a repeated concern with minority-language literature in Flemish and with the expression of a Belgian identity through the use of French. De Man explored these issues through the mediums of both French and Flemish. A typicall942 piece, 'Surles caracteristiques du roman beige d'expression franc;aise', singles out as important the achievement of a dis5 Edward Said, Orientalism (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978); Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, In Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics (London: Methuen, 1987). 6 David Dabydeen (ed.), The Black Presence in English Literature (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1985). 7 Paul de Man, Critical Writings, 1953-1978, ed. Lindsay Waters (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989), p. xv.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ntinctly Belgian tone in works of French-language Literature. 8 De Man was interested in how a literature which could be seen as provincial might preserve a sense of independence while being written in the language of another, dominant culture. This present book argues not simply that such an issue is crucial to modern English-language writing world-wide, but that it emerges first, and is seen most subtly and constantly, in the literature of Scotland. De Man was concerned with cultural imperialism, national identity, and the construction of a pluralistic bilingual native tradition. But, as we now know, he was also prepared to align himself with Fascist killers. His concern with cultural nationalism led him to think that the best hope for Belgium lay on the side of the Third Reich. His wartime writings are rightly notorious because he sided with the exterminators, and his later work constitutes a decisive swerve away from all his earlier preoccupations. 9 Moving to America, it is as if he wished to put the maximum possible distance, physical and intellectual, between himself and his fascination with questions of the literary significance of cultural nationalism. Those questions tended to be avoided by Anglo-American critics and theorists in the post-war era, when it was perceived that the Romantic nationalism of the nineteenth century had ended in the abyss of the Third Reich. The fates of small nations such as the Baltic States were embarrassing to contemplate, while nationalist writers within Britain, such as Hugh MacDiarmid, were easily dismissed as local cranks. Ernest Gellner, writing in a widely praised 1983 study of Nations and Nationalism, sees nationalism only in terms of a 'problem', and even a recent series of conferences held in Aberdeen, Nottingham, and Luxembourg in the late 1980s under the title 'The Literature of Region and Nation' largely avoided discussion of the difference between a region and a nation. Some speakers, for instance, were happy to regard Scotland and Wales as regions; for others, they were obviously nations. On the whole, contemporary historians have shown a much more robust interest in nationalism than have commentators on literature. It would be exciting to see more of an attempt to relate to recent writing such a provocative comment as Eric Hobsbawm's that 'The declining 8 Paul de Man, Wartime journalism, 1939-1943, ed. Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan (Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 1988), 198. 9 One of the best examinations of de Man's wartime activities is Frank Kermode, 'Paul de Man's Abyss', London Review of Books, 16 Mar. 1989, 3-7.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nhistorical significance of nationalism is today concealed . . . by the visible spread of ethnic/linguistic agitations.' 10 Yet major literary theorists have tended to avoid issues of cultural identity. Most strikingly, Derrida, as a French-speaking Algerian of Jewish background growing up in the 1940s and stimulated to pursue a literary career by fellow-Algerian Albert Camus, must have been well aware of questions of cultural assimilation and difference. 11 His own work, though, seems as much an avoidance of the adoption of any stance on these matters as it is a subversion of the discourses of authority. While he is reported to have a strong wish to write about what it means to him to be Algerian, he has not done this to any significant extent. 12 If post-structuralist thought deconstructs ideologies of authority, then, since it does this for all ideologies, its practical effect is often to maintain the status quo rather than to support any countermovement. Often what small or vulnerable cultural groups need is not simply a deconstruction of rhetorics of authority, but a construction or reconstruction of a 'usable past', an awareness of a cultural tradition which will allow them to preserve or develop a sense of their own distinctive identity, their constituting difference. Tensions between historically minded commentators who wish to reconstruct the past, rewriting literary history with a non-standard accent, and post-structuralists deeply distrustful of any such empirically based historical work are clearly evident in feminist literary studies, where the work of a literary historian such as Elaine Showalter, who seeks to make available to women a sense that they have what her book calls A Literature of Their Own, may be set against the largely antihistorical work of post-structuralists such as julia Kristeva and Helene Cixous, whose writing often seems far removed from the circumstances and possibilities of actual cultural or social change. These tensions have been outlined incisively by Janet Todd in her study of Feminist Literary History. 13 Readers, writers, and critics interested in the 10 Ernest Gellner, Nations and Nationalism (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1983), 5; E. J. Hobsbawm, Nations and Nationalism since 1780 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 170. 11 See Christopher Norris, Derrida (London: Fontana, 1987), 11-12, 239-41. 12 I am grateful to Dr R. M. Cummings and Dr Sandra Kemp of Glasgow University for informing me of Derrida's remarks on this topic at the March 1988 conference on 'The Linguistics of Writing', held at the University of Strathclyde. 13 Elaine Showalter, A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Bronte to Lessing (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1977); Janet Todd, Feminist Literary History: A Defence (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1988).\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nliteratures of small cultures might learn a lot from the example of feminist studies, another area which, in the not so distant past, was often dismissed as an example of 'special pleading'. Certainly, this present book, though it deals mainly with male authors, has been encouraged by Todd's arguments in favour of the need for close, empirical re-examinations of writing produced by a marginalized group and tied to the circumstances of particular cultural struggles. Encouragement has come also from a very different approach. Though the idiom of Devolving English Literature is not at all that of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, their Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature contains material likely to be stimulating for anyone interested in questions of how an un-English identity may be preserved or developed within 'English Literature'. Their book addresses Kafka specifically, but its third chapter, entitled 'What Is a Minor Literature?', involves contentions which are both provocative and pertinent. Deleuze and Guattari state that 'A minor literature doesn't come from a minor language; it is rather that which a minority constructs within a major language.' They go on to argue that, partly because of the pressure exerted on the minority by the major language, it is characteristic of minor literatures 'that everything in them is political', and that they have a particularly strong sense of collective cultural identity . 14 This present book has attempted to remain alert to nuances of cultural politics embedded in most of the works discussed, nuances which set them apart from Anglocentric assumptions but which are ignored when these texts are read in an unexamined context of 'English Literature'. For some, my readings may appear eccentric, but this 'ec-centricity' is deliberate, a gesture designed to make us aware of issues too easily suppressed. Devolving English Literature has also attempted to be alert to manifestations of a collective identity, to cultural traditions that can only be seen if we are willing to have a devolved rather than a totalitarian or centralist approach to English Literature. Devolving English Literature aims to foster a receptive approach to cultural differences, to the way in which authors can question or negotiate with Anglocentricity in their writings. It aims to note, particularly, the differences between Scottish Literature, British Literature, and English Literature-all of which are entities that writers within 'English' have attempted to construct for particular 14 Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, trans. Dana Polan (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986), 16-17.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\ncultural ends. If, deliberately or not, we totalize all the constituents of English Literature, and if, as both traditional literary history and poststructuralist criticism have done all too often, we ignore matters of local origin, then we perform an act of na\"ive cultural imperialism, acting as if books grew not out of particular conditions in Nottingham, Dublin, St Lucia, or Salem, Massachusetts, but out of the bland uniformity of airport departure lounges. The act of inscription is not a simple entry into the delocalized, pure medium of language; it is constantly, often deliberately, an act which speaks of its local origins, of points of departure never fully left behind. The present book's title is not intended simply to comply with the view that writing in English has been a narrowly centralized activity, and that power must now be devolved from the centre to the margins. Rather, it aims to suggest that, while for centuries the margins have been challenging, interrogating, and even structuring the supposed 'centre', the development of the subject 'English Literature' has constantly involved and reinforced an oppressive homage to centralism. As such, English Literature is a force which must be countered continually by a devolutionary momentum. Creative writers have been more alert to this need than have most critics. Devolving English Literature devotes considerable space to American writing, and its last chapter looks at connections between a number of poets in Australia, Ireland, the Caribbean, northern England, and Scotland, all of whom wish to use the English language and its varieties to enunciate a cultural identity that is not that of the traditionally dominant London-Oxbridge English cultural centre. I hope that many of the points which emerge in discussing a text or literary tradition may spark off reflections about other kinds of 'provincial', 'colonial', or 'post-colonial' writing elsewhere. Yet I have chosen to concentrate particularly on Scottish culture and the strategies adopted by Scottish authors. These authors can be seen as contributing to an identifiably Scottish cultural heritage, but they are often either too smoothly assimilated into English Literature, or else (like Hugh MacDiarmid) awkwardly marginalized from considerations of work whose focus is not purely Scottish. There may be many parallels between the Scottish writing considered in the present book and the Irish writers so ably discussed in Seamus Deane's A Short History of Irish Literature (1986), and I would invite readers to develop these; but, though some Irish works are included in the last two chapters of this book, I have deliberately concentrated on the less\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nacademically fashionable, yet undeniably outstanding, work produced in Scotland since the Enlightenment. The first reason for choosing Scottish Literature for special attention is that it offers the longest continuing example of a substantial body of literature produced by a culture pressurized by the threat of English cultural domination. The second reason, which follows from this, is that, because of its historical longevity and cultural circumstance, Scottish writing has often formed a model for writers in other countries concerned to escape from being England's cultural provinces. This book examines the impact of Scottish writing on a number of American writers, but similar tasks could be undertaken for Canadian and Australian writing, to cite only two obvious examples. Because of Scotland's geographical proximity to England, and because Scotland, while it maintains separate legal, educational, and religious institutions, lacks political independence, Scottish writing in English (like Welsh writing in English) is particularly vulnerable to being subsumed within the English literary tradition with which it was frequently, but not exclusively, engaged. Scotland, therefore, becomes a, if not the, test case when considering whether or not we have devolved our view of 'English Literature' in order to take full account of the various different cultural traditions which are so easily lumped together under that label. Scotland itself, as was mentioned above and as is argued in detail in Chapter 1, was crucially instrumental in the development of the university teaching of English Literature, which has conditioned our view of the subject; so, again, Scotland appears a fundamental area to examine. Though I am concerned with delineating a literary genealogy which seems particularly important in Scottish writing, an anthropologically orientated line, this book is not a history of Scottish Literature, of which there have been several recent examples. 15 It does not argue that what it offers is the post- Enlightenment Scottish tradition. Nor is it a study of a particular period of Scottish writing. Attention has been drawn elsewhere to the problems of cultural identity which faced eighteenth-century Scottish writers. 16 This book 15 Roderick Watson, The Literature of Scotland (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1984 ), is an outstanding one-volume treatment; more diffuse is Cairns Craig (gen. ed. ), The History of Scottish Literature ( 4 vols.; Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1987 -8). 16 See especially David Daiches, The Paradox of Scottish Culture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964); David Craig, Scottish Literature and the Scottish People, 1680-1830 (London: Chatto and Windus, 1961); Kenneth Simpson, The Protean Scot: The Crisis of Identity in Eighteenth-Century Scottish Literature (Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1988).\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ndiffers not only by emphasizing the importance of seeing how these problems moulded the development of the university teaching of English Literature, but also by arguing that the Scots' solution to them was to develop a 'British Literature' throughout both the eighteenth and .nineteenth centuries, before a more explicitly nationalist, post-British literary consciousness came to the fore in the twentieth century. Devolving English Literature is intended to stimulate further debate by its emphasis on the way in which the 'provincial' energies so important to Scottish writing, and the anthropological viewpoint developed by Scottish writers, fed into American writing and into the essentially 'provincial' movement we know as Modernism. Lastly, through examining the 'provincial' and demotic energies of Modernism, it becomes possible to see how these continue to energize more recent 'provincial' and 'colonial' writers as diverse as Philip Larkin, Seamus Heaney, Douglas Dunn, Les Murray, and Derek Walcott, several of whom are usually accepted as being opposed to Modernism rather than indebted to it. Throughout this book the word 'provincial' often appears in inverted commas; this is to alert the reader to the fact that the term has come to acquire a derogatory meaning, and is often used as a term of cultural imperialism. 17 The chapters which follow make some effort to counter such attitudes, and even, on occasion, to valorize the term 'provincial'. Devolving English Literature, then, has a loop structure, beginning with a consideration of eighteenth-century Scottish anxieties and annoyances about the country's 'provincial' status, and concluding by showing the extent to which similar anxieties are highlighted by a variety of contemporary poets all too aware of the question of the 'provincial'. These anxieties and issues are ignored or p11pered over if we maintain a crude, unitary view of English Literature, but become apparent and exciting if we are prepared to achieve a devolved view which attends closely to local accents. Among other things, the achievement of this devolved view allows a provocative rereading of a wide variety of texts, from the works of Smollett and Boswell, through those of Scott, Carlyle, and Frazer, to the writing of the Modernists and of our own contemporaries. Readings of some eighteenth-century texts in this book are particularly detailed because, while today's readers may pay lip-service to the achievements of Smollett and 17 For one view of the development of the use of this term, see John Lucas, 'The Idea of the Provincial', in Romantic to Modern Literature: Essays and Ideas of Culture 1750-1900 (Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982), 7-29.\n\nIntroduction\n\n10\n\nBoswell, I suspect that those authors' works are increasingly unfamiliar, and that generous quotation is necessary. In dealing with more recent writers, such as Eliot or Heaney, I have assumed that the reader is more likely to be familiar with the material, and have quoted from it less extensively. If literary theorists have largely ignored Scottish writing, this may be another instance of post-structuralism's tendency in practice to do little to upset the status quo: Scottish Literature has been hardly the most popular area for critical investigation; literary theorists have done little to change this. Indeed, though there are a few signs that questions of Scottish cultural identity may be received into more theoretically lively areas of criticism, there are also indications that this may be done in a crude way which demonstrates little or no attention to Scottish cultural difference, and that there remains a great need for empirically grounded work to help free Scottish writing from the Anglocentric tones of conventional literary history and of newer approaches. Evidence to support such a contention is provided by a recent book of essays on Nation and Narration which examines-critically and often provocatively-such nationally tinged conceptions as 'English reading'. 18 Among the international array of contributors to this book only Gillian Beer seems to have a clear and explicit awareness that the words 'England' and 'Britain' are not synonymous. When Scottish Literature appears fleetingly in the person of Walter Scott in an essay called 'Literature: Nationalism's Other? The Case for Revision', the treatment of Scott's work in the context of 'nation and narration' is perversely careless and wrong-headed: 'In 1812 Scott published Waverlry . . . Scott's texts are not motivated. Unlike Tom Jones to which it is much indebted, Waverlry does not explain the occasion of its own writing.' 19 The fact that Scott published Waverlry in 1814, not 1812, is relevant because, only by siting this text accurately in a Scottish historical and cultural climate, can we understand its motivation, which is bound up with the construction of a Scottish and British national narrative. This motivation is explicitly and implicitly acknowledged in the novel, as is argued in detail in Chapter 3 of the present book. Throughout Devolving English Literature I have aimed to be stimulating and readily comprehensible, hoping to interest writers and 18\n\n19\n\nHomi K. Bhabha (ed.), Nation and Narration (London: Routledge, 1990), 6. Ibid. 147.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nreaders, not just teachers and students. This book seeks to use familiar procedures, idioms, and devices from conventional literary history, yet also to undermine the Anglocentric voice of that history. This is not a totalizing story of English Literature which co-opts non-English authors to incorporate them into a unitary English tradition, but a devolutionary history written on the margin. It tries to erode and complicate any ideas of such a unitary tradition, and force 'English' to take account of the other cultures which are in part responsible for the initial construction of 'English Literature' as a subject. This last-named aspect of the project brings it into contact with a good deal of recent scholarly work, such as Olivia Smith's consideration of The Politics of Language 1791-1819. Though it is not specifically about the history of the university subject ofâ¢ English Literature, Smith's study is extremely useful in its demonstration of how language in this period was the site of a conflict between a polished metropolitan ascendancy, whose values were those of the educational system, and provincial lower-class barbarians, whose views could be discounted because they were expressed in terms considered stupid or corrupt. 'The basic vocabulary of language study', writes Smith, '-such terms as \"elegant\", \"refined\", \"pure\", \"proper\", and \"vulgar\"conveyed the assumption that correct usage belonged to the upper classes and that a developed sensibility and an understanding of moral virtue accompanied it.' 20 Drawing its inspiration from developments in black studies and women's studies, Olivia Smith's book nicely complements the generally Marxist essays of Brian Doyle, Peter Brooker, and Peter Widdowson on the development of English studies, which these writers see as contributing to an upper-class, imperialist, metropolitan discourse aimed at taming the lower classes and Celts by educating them in accord with a more polished and humane English tradition. 21 This view accords with the subtler, more extended treatment of the subject by Chris Baldick in his widely praised book, The Social Mission of English Criticism, which devotes much attention to the institutional development of English studies in London, Oxford, and Cambridge, from Matthew Arnold to the 20 Olivia Smith, The Politics of Language 1791-1819 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), 9. 21 See Brian Doyle, 'The Invention of English', and Peter Brooker and Peter Widdowson, 'A Literature for England', in Robert Colis and Philip Dodd (eds.), Englishness, Politics and Culture 1880-1920 (London: Croom Helm, 1986), 89-115, 116-63; see also Brian Doyle, 'The Hidden History of English Studies', in Peter Widdowson (ed. ), Re-Reading English (London: Methuen, 1982), 17-31.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nLeavises, through critics who fostered ideas about the centrality of a certain English tradition. Terry Eagleton follows Baldick's model in his Literary Theory (1983). Jo McMurtry's non-Marxist look at some pioneers of literary teaching on both sides of the Atlantic fleshes out these other studies, while books by Gerald Graff and Kermit Vanderbilt examine the growth of the teaching of English and American Literature in the United States, where American Literature courses often reacted against certain norms assumed in the study of English Literature. There have been earlier attempts to chronicle the rise of English Literature, such as D. J. Palmer's very useful The Rise of English Studies ( 1965) and Stephen Potter's sometimes stimulating anti-academic report on The Muse in Chains (1937). 22 But the nature and proliferation of recent work in this field (which is often bound up with an examination of changing concepts of Englishness) suggests that increasing self-questioning is causing the discipline to examine and interrogate its own origins in much the same way that anthropology has been doing for some time. As the following chapter suggests, there may be a certain poetic justice in the way in which the roots of the teaching of English and the development of eighteenth-century anthropology are intertwined. Recent studies of the growth of English Literature as a university subject are insufficient because of the assumption they make that the actual origins of the subject are in nineteenth-century England. It is to be hoped that Devolving English Literature will supplement and, ironically, complicate the books mentioned above, just as it may intersect fruitfully with contemporary examinations of Englishness such as those of Robert Colis and Philip Dodd in Englishness, Brian Doyle in English and Englishness, and john Lucas in England and Englishness. 23 Though frequently helpful, these studies tend to ignore the subtle interrelationships between Englishness, Britishness, and Scottishness which have done so much to mould 'English Literature'. 22 See Chris Baldick, The Social Mission of English Criticism 1848-1932 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983); Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory (Oxford: Blackwell, 1983); Jo McMurtry, English Language, English Literature: The Creation of an Academic Discipline (London: Mansell, 1985); Gerald Graff, Professing Literature: An Institutional History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987); Kermit Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy: The Roots, Growth, and Maturity of a Profession (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986); D.

I hope it is clear when, for instance, I consider Tony Harrison in the final chapter that I do not see English culture as a clear, unified block. England may not have the complex linguistic and cultural divisions of a Scotland split for centuries between Gaelic, English, and Scots, but England is clearly a cultural amalgam to which a fully devolved reading of English Literature must address itself. Again, in speaking of Scottish culture, I concentrate on Lowland as opposed to Highland culture; I would be sad if this were taken as indicating any denial of Highland or of Gaelic cultural difference. When writing about matters of cultural nationalism and identity, it is always difficult to avoid treading on toes. A nice example of this occurs in the admirable recent series of Field Day pamphlets on Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature, where Terry Eagleton, addressing an Irish audience on the theme of Nationalism: Irony and Commitment, appears guilty of an ironic lapse when he writes that 'Those of us who happen to be British, yet who object to what has been done historically to other peoples in our name, would far prefer a situation in which we could take being British for granted and think about something more interesting for a change.' 25 The first irony here is that the whole of Ireland was for a time (and part of it remains) constitutionally British. For this reason, Ireland, like Scotland, has been-in part at least-a perpetrator as well as a victim of global British imperialism. Eagleton's paper seems to avoid the embarrassment of this situation. A second irony is that the sentence quoted above is likely to be extremely irritating to present-day Scottish or Welsh nationalists who still constitutionally 'happen to be British', yet will have no wish at all to 'take being British for granted' and will Lucas, England and Englishness, 39. Terry Eagleton, Nationalism: Irony and Commitment (Field Day Pamphlet 13; Derry: Field Day Theatre Company, 1988), 8. 24\n\n25\n\nIntroduction\n\n14\n\nbe likely to regard Eagleton's statement as one of ideological imperialism. Yet Eagleton's main argument in this pamphlet remains valid, for he contends that all oppositional nationalist arguments, political or cultural, 'move under the sign of irony, knowing themselves ineluctably parasitic on their antagonists'. 26 There is too often a heart-hardening, parasitical hatred which develops among cultural nationalists, and which Yeats recognized as leading only to 'withered old and skeleton-gaunt' frustrated ideals. 27 It is good that we should be suspicious of nationalisms and their traditions, subjecting them to the sort of sceptical scrutiny which is applied to the Highland and Jacobite traditions of Scotland by historians and critics as different as Hugh Trevor-Roper, Malcolm Chapman, Peter Womack, and Murray Pittock. 28 All cultural constructions may profit from having their shams exposed, from being demystified or deconstructed. Devolving English Literature also implies a taking-apart, but I have tried to emphasize as far as possible the positive side of the endeavour: that it is part of a reconstructing of a literary inheritance. Ultimately, the aim of this book is not deconstructive but creative. For, rather than something to be eschewed, the invention or construction of traditions is a key activity in a healthy culture, one whose view of itself and of its own development is constantly altering and under review. There is no fixed, unchanging entity called Englishness, or Britishness, or Jamaicanness. Each of these cultural identities, like that of Scotland, is in constant evolution, continually re-manufacturing itself. In Imagined Communities Benedict Anderson, though he grossly oversimplifies complex cultural issues about the languages of Scotland, is right to draw attention to Tom Nairn's 'good nationalist tendency to treat his \"Scotland\" as an unproblematic, primordial given'.

Writers are constantly aware of this. Scott, attempting to ensure and articulate Scotland's distinctive place in Britain in Waverlry, is conscious of the need both to construct and to reconstruct images of cultural identity that are other than Anglocentric. The modern poet Derek Walcott has related aims when he blends Caribbean nation and narration in Omeros. It is impossible to appreciate the project of either work if one considers the text as simply belonging to English Literature. One should bear in mind that most English-language writing is now produced outside England. To read many anglophone books of the past, and most anglophone books of the present, requires a devolving of the still prevalent idea of 'English Literature', and a specific attention to the slippages which that label encourages and which are all too often brushed aside. The best way to begin to understand how the Anglocentric notion of English Literature achieved such formidable cultural power, being disseminated through our institutions of higher education whose influence indirectly pervades the whole community, is to attend to the sense in which the subject of English Literature was, ironically, a Scottish invention. 29 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1983), 85.\n\n1\n\nThe Scottish Invention of English Literature WHETHER in Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Adam Ferguson's Essay on the History of Civil Society, John Millar's Observations Concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society, or a plethora of other works, eighteenth-century Scottish writing is filled with comparisons of cultures at various stages of development, and with speculations about how societies 'improve'. The concept and vocabulary of 'improvement', of turning the primitive into the civilized, govern manifold areas of Scottish life at this time, from agriculture, economics, and chemistry to poetry and the fine arts. Some aspects of the primitive, such as nobility and simplicity, were admired even as the general march continued towards mercantile and literary refinement. Discussions of the primitive and the refined were a major element of the Enlightenment, not only in a Montesquieu-fuelled Scotland but also across Europe and in North America. 1 Yet the debate was particularly intense in, and pertinent to, Scottish culture, because, rightly or wrongly, the small country of Scotland could be seen in various ways as strikingly divided between the barbarically primitive and the confidently sophisticated. Such a perception of Scotland pre-dates the eighteenth century. The Britannica, first compiled by the Englishman William Camden in 1586 and reprinted throughout the seventeenth century, declared that, 'With respect to the manners and ways of living, it is divided into the High-land-men and the Low-land-men. These are more civilized, and use the language and habit of the English; the other more rude and barbarous, and use that of the Irish.' 2 In the eighteenth 1\n\nSee Peter France, 'Primitivism and Enlightenment: Rousseau and the Scots',\n\nYearbook of English Studies 1985, 69; for Montesquieu's impact on eighteenth-century Scottish thought, see Ronald L.

In 17 55 the Edinburgh clergyman and historian William Robertson preached a sermon in which he suggested that society in the Highlands and Islands was society in its most primitive form. Also in 1755 he made the same claim for the society of the North American Indians. 3 Scottish Enlightenment writers, often anxious to play up their own country's increasingly 'civilized' values, rarely spoke of the inhabitants of Scotland in terms which so clearly linked them to North American 'savages'. But when Adam Ferguson discussed the systems of 'tribes or of clans' among primitive peoples, the word 'clan' must have carried with it some local resonance for a writer brought up on the Highland Line, the frontier between Highlands and Lowlands; the twentieth-century historian Duncan Forbes points out that Ferguson, like other Scottish Enlightenment writers, was encouraged by Scotland's divided cultural situation to take 'a long, cool look at both sides of the medal of modern civilization'. 4 William Robertson's Edinburgh friend Professor Hugh Blair linked ancient Ossianic Highlanders with American Indians in his 1763 Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian. James Boswell and Samuel Johnson both wrote of modern Highlanders in terms of native Americans. Unsure if Ossian's poems were ancient or modern, the Glaswegian Professor William Richardson moved easily from his long poem on North American Indians to his Ossianic drama The Maid of Lochlin and his 1778 dramatic poem Agandecca. Sir Walter Scott had an English judge liken Highlanders to North American Indians in his 1827 story The Two Drovers. 5 A constant interest in cultural parallels and comparisons which developed during the Scottish Enlightenment, and which was encouraged by the divided nature of Scotland, would have important repercussions for the development of Scottish literary culture.

Olivia Smith has pointed out the extent to which, in the second half of the eighteenth century, 'Civilization was largely a linguistic concept, establishing a terrain in which vocabulary and syntax distinguished the refined and civilized from the vulgar and the savage.' 6 In Scotland the general eighteenth-century concern with linguistic propriety was particularly intense because it was bound up with a conflict between the urge to treasure the language of Lowland Scotland-Scots-in which most of the great popular and learned poetry of Scotland, from Gavin Douglas to the ballads, had been created, and a contrary impulse to develop a Scotland which would take complete advantage of the 1707 Act of Union by playing its part in the newly united political entity of Britain. To play a full part, Scottish people would have to move from using Scots to using English, an English which was fully acceptable to the dominant partner in the political union. This English, it was argued, both had to replace Scots and had to be purged of what we would now call 'markers of Scottish cultural difference', purged of Scotticisms. The growing wish for a 'pure' English in eighteenth-century Scotland was not an anti-Scottish gesture, but a pro-British one. If Britain were to work as a political unit, then Scots should rid themselves of any elements likely to impede their progress within it. Language, the most important of bonds, must not be allowed to hinder Scotland's intercourse with expanding economic and intellectual markets in the freshly defined British state. Scots who, like Alexander Wedderburn in the 1755 Edinburgh Review, wrote about 'North Britain' rather than 'Scotland' in the context of 'improvement' were emphasizing the new opportunities open to a post-Union and post-Culloden Scotland loyal to the British constitution. Such figures were pro-British because they were pro-Scottish: it was in the promise of 'Britain' that they saw the richest future for a Scotland which would soon 'improve'. Linguistic 'improvement' would be a major step towards that. Throughout the eighteenth century an obsession with cultural comparison between improved and unimproved societies often feeds into, and is spurred by, that pursuit of improving linguistic studies which Nicholas 6 Olivia Smith, The Politics of Language 1791-1819 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), p. vii.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n19\n\nPhillipson has called the 'most characteristic preoccupation of the Scottish Enlightenment'. 7 So, for instance, Thomas Blackwell, Professor of Greek at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1735 devoted himself to presenting the poet Homer as poised between the societies which moulded him: one was a basic society of 'Warriors, and Shepherds, and Peasants such as he drew'; the other was of 'Cities blessed with Peace, spirited with Liberty, flourishing in Trade, and increasing in Wealth'. In this, Blackwell's Janus-faced Homer, born between a time of 'Nakedness and Barbarity' and one of 'Order and Established Discipline', was an eighteenth-century Aberdonian and, more generally, an eighteenthcentury Scot. 8 In Aberdeen Blackwell's work appears to have influenced the student James Macpherson, whose Ossianic epics were to valorize Highland warriors (made safely antique) and balance the primitive with a refinement suited to the 'improving' tastes of Hugh Blair, Alexander Carlyle, and Adam Ferguson, who compared Ossian with Homer. James Beattie, George Campbell, and Alexander Gerard, also students of Blackwell's, were all improvers who furthered the discipline encouraged by Blackwell's widow when, in 1796, she left money for the award of a prize to 'the person who should compose and deliver, in the English language, the best discourse upon a given literary subject'. 9 By 1796 the term 'literary subject' in a Scottish university referred not only to classical, but also to modern literature, which had been taught for almost half a century; the eighteenthcentury sense of the word 'literature' encompassed most fields of educated discourse. This Scottish pedagogical development was quite different from the scope and design of the Oxford Professorship of Poetry founded in 1708, whose early incumbents, such as Joseph Trapp, Robert Lowth, and Thomas Warton the Younger, lectured in Latin on Classical and Hebrew subjects, though some of their lectures were later published in translation for a wider audience.

Grant (Wakefield: EP Publishing, 1983), i. 306.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n20\n\nScottish university subject, like Blackwell's Homer, arose from the growing awareness of, and interest in, the gap between primitive or barbarous societies and 'civil', highly developed ones. The collection of data about both types, and the speculation about how one might relate to the other, were activities common to other Enlightenment countries, but Peter France has found particular interest in questions of the 'civil' and 'savage' in provincial areas on Europe's mountainous frontiers, as in Switzerland or Scotland. 10 In his epoch-making study of Victorian Anthropology George Stocking mentions the Scottish roots of anthropology when he points out that, in the winter of 1750-1, Adam Smith in Edinburgh and Baron Turgot at the Sorbonne each gave lectures attempting a more general or scientific formulation of the idea of progress in civilization. 11 Though Smith's lectures from this period do not survive, the painstaking research of Ronald Meek has argued convincingly that they closely resembled Smith's 1762-3 Glasgow lectures on jurisprudence, and that they contained Smith's first exposition of the celebrated 'four stages theory' of social evolution. 12 What is particularly interesting is that we know for certain that Smith was also lecturing in Edinburgh from 1748 until 1751 on 'Rhetoric and Belles Lettres' . 13 Because bothÂ·were very much concerned with the process of 'improvement', it comes as no surprise to find that the roots of the modern university disciplines of anthropology and of English Literature are mutually entwined, and that both are linked to the development of modern economics. To appreciate this further, and to understand the social and economic motivations which governed the emergence of universitylevel English Literature studies, we need a sketch of the Scottish cultural context. The growing network of convivial and intellectual clubs in eighteenth-century Scotland-starting with those like Allan Ramsay's Easy Club of 1712 which, though uneasy about the politics of the 1707 Union, nevertheless promoted 'Mutual Improvement in Conversation' -shows a strong accent on 'correct' (southern) taste, as demonstrated by the widespread reading of the Spectator. The clubs also indicate a concern with Scottish heritage, as is evidenced by their interest in antiquities, including literary antiquities. Though they tried to learn 'Improvement in Conversation' from the Spectator, the France, 'Western European Civilisation', 297-310. George W. Stocking, jun., Victorian Anthropology (London: Collier Macmillan, 12 Meek, Social Science and the Ignoble Savage, 90-11 7. 198 7), 14. 13 On this, see especially Adam Smith, Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, ed. J. C. Bryce (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), 7. 10\n\nII\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n21\n\nEasy Club's members soon changed their pseudonyms from those of English to Scottish literary figures-Allan Ramsay became 'Gavin Douglas'. There was a general difficulty about how one might preserve a Scottish identity while (as was increasingly encouraged by the upper classes) adopting English linguistic mores. 'Fergus Bruce' in 1724 prompted the retort that the efforts of Edinburgh people to 'refine their Conversation ... will contribute ... to the Pleasure of the South part of this Kingdom'. Scots was being replaced by English in schools, and students at Edinburgh University were welcoming help that would improve their taste in literature through better English composition. 14 John Stevenson, Professor of Logic at Edinburgh from 1730 until 1775, delivered in English what one student remembered as a 'Belles Lettres' hour. Stevenson used passages from Homer and Classical critics as well as modern English and French writers, including Addison and Pope. Thomas Somerville, one of the Edinburgh literati, recalled that Stevenson also occasionally read lectures on the cardinal points of criticism suggested by the text-books . . . his lectures included some judicious philological discussions, as well as many excellent examples and useful practical rules of composition. I derived more substantial benefit from these exercises and lectures than from all the public classes which I attended at the University. 15\n\nThe historian William Robertson also found these classes uniquely beneficial. Among Stevenson's other students were John Witherspoon, later President of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), and Hugh Blair, later Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh, who wrote an essay on 'The Beautiful' for Stevenson, and spoke of Stevenson's praise of this as making him decide to study 'polite literature' . 16 The phrase 'Rhetoric and Belles Lettres' probably came from Rollin, Professor of Rhetoric in Paris, whose lectures were published in France in 1726-8, and in a 1734 English translation as The Method 14 McElroy, Scotland's Age of Improvement, 14-16, 21; David Daiches, Literature and Gentility in Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1982), 44; Alexander Law, Education in Edinburgh in the Eighteenth Century (London: University of London Press, 1965), 33, 222. 15 Thomas Somerville, My Own Life and Times 1741-1814 (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1861), 13. 16 On Robertson, see Somerville, Life and Times, 14; on Witherspoon, Blair, and Stevenson, see Varnum Lansing Collins, President Witherspoon: A Biography (2 vols.; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1925), i. 14; on Blair and Stevenson, see also Henry Duncan, 'Blair', in Edinburgh Encyclopedia, ed. David Brewster (Edinburgh: Blackwood, 1830), iii. 567.\n\n22\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\nof Teaching and Studying the Belles Lettres, a book frequently quoted by British schoolteachers. 17 In Edinburgh in 1737 a collection of extracts from the Spectator, Tatler, and Guardian used 'Mr Rollin's Method of teaching and studying the belles lettres' . 18 Such developments were not uniquely Scottish. In some of the English Dissenting Academies (set up after 1689 to educate dissenters, who were excluded by law from the two English universities) there was, increasingly, some teaching of English studies in the eighteenth century. As their name suggests, the Dissenting Academies catered for (male) students, largely of non-aristocratic background, who were not part of the ruling English establishment. The location of the Academies tended to be provincial, northern, non-metropolitan; their links were less with Oxbridge than with the Scottish universities which conferred honorary degrees on Andrew Kippis, John Aikin, Joseph Priestley, and William Enfield, pioneers of the teaching of English studies. 19 But the Scottish universities matter most because they were universities, the dominant, established, mainstream (not dissenting) channels of higher education. Their development of English studies in a particular cultural climate shows most clearly how the subject involved an attempted suppression of native tradition in a process of cultural conversion that was thought of as a move from the barbarous Scottish to the polite British-thought of, in short, as 'improvement'. Particularly after the Jacobite Rebellions, which had brought civil war to Scotland, many influential Scots believed that common British norms-which meant, generally, Anglocentric norms-were needed if Scotland were to prosper and win English approval. A leader of this group was Henry Home, later Lord Kames, whose Essays upon Several Subjects Concerning British Antiquities (1747) attempted to purge Scotland of cultural distinctions which might invite English disfavour: 'When one dives into the Antiquities of Scotland and England, it will appear that we borrowed all our Laws and Customs from the English.' 20 Kames spoke Scots, but wished to encourage the use of English in Scotland. In 1762 his Elements of Criticism advocated the fine arts, which, 'by cherishing love of order ... inforce submission to government', and he subscribed that year (along with Hugh Blair, James 17 Ian Michael, The Teaching of English from the Sixteenth Century to 1870 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 163; D.

'All other dialects, are sure marks, either of a provincial, rustic, pedantic, or mechanic education; and therefore have some degree of disgrace annexed to them.' 22 When delivered in Edinburgh, each of Sheridan's lectures was followed by 'select readings from the English classics'. An Edinburgh student recalled that 'Among other results of Mr. Sheridan's visit, a society, consisting of literary men, was formed, for the purpose of concerting measures for the instruction of the young in this hitherto neglected, but, as was now supposed, primary branch of education.' Hugh Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres would later cite Sheridan with approval.2 3 Edinburgh's students, aspiring lawyers, preachers, and public men wished to shed tell-tale contraventions of standard English norms so as to succeed in their careers. A later authority on Scotticisms recalled being told that the 'Duke of Argyle' (a Scotsman of great political influence in London) 'thought a resemblance or identity of language of such real national importance, that he is said to have furnished Mr. Hume with the materials of his printed collection'. 24 This collection was the list of 'Scotticisms' appended to David Hume's 1752 Political Discourses. The list of proscribed expressions-such as the Scottish 'mind it' instead of English 'remember it'-may seem trivial, but it is an indicator of the way in which discourse itself was politically important, a key to gaining power in Britain. Like Kames's, Hume's speech was filled with native forms, but he attempted to excise these when writing, complaining of his 'corrupt Dialect'. 25 Eighteenth-century terms such as 'Scotch ism' and 'Scotchery' show clear signs of English prejudice 2!

To many it appeared that the way to advance as a Scot was to appear as English as possible, while at the same time upholding an ideal of Britishness in which Scotland would be able to play her full part. Sometimes the efforts of Scots to Anglicize their tongues gave rise to anxiety about loss of identity. Actors, used to elocution, were among those who gave lectures and demonstrations of 'proper' English. But occasionally we hear another note: At a period when the attention of the public is so laudably engaged in the study of the language of our sister kingdom; it is hoped it will not be deemed improper to pay some regard to that of our own; and that an effort to keep alive some of the first pieces of poetry that can adorn any language will meet with the approbation of those possessed in any degree of the Amor Patriae, or who do not wish the Scotch name to sink into utter oblivion. Therefore on Friday next, 15th March, in St Mary's Chapel, Mr Young will deliver a lecture on the Scottish language. 28\n\nSuch lectures in the mid-eighteenth century were building on the earlier efforts of anthologists like Allan Ramsay to raise public awareness of the literary importance of Scots. Yet Scots, as well as Scotticisms, was being pushed firmly out of the discourse of institutional power. Through the networks of gentlemen's 'improving' clubs in Edinburgh and other Scottish towns and cities, ideas were advanced about the improvement of language and speech, the removal of distinctive Scottish linguistic indicators. 29 There is no shortage of examples of how such attitudes pervaded the ruling class. One typical but interesting case must suffice. John (later Sir John) Sinclair, a Scottish MP in London, published his Observations on the Scottish Dialect in London in 1782 to be 'of use to my countrymen ... particularly those whose object it is to have some share in the administration of national affairs'. For those who wished See the entries for these words in the OED. See entry for 'Scotticism' in OED. For further examples of Scottish linguistic sensitivities, see Pat Rogers, 'Boswell and the Scotticism', in Greg Clingham (ed.), New Light on Boswell (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 56-71. 28 Law, Education in Edinburgh, 159. 29 See McElroy, Scotland's Age of Improvement, passim. 26 27\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n25\n\nto get on, 'new manners must be assumed, and a new language adopted. Nor does this observation apply to Scotchmen only: the same remark may be extended to the Irish, to the Welsh, and to the inhabitants of several districts in England.' The London model had to dominate all. Like Kames, Sinclair stressed the need for Scots to assimilate themselves to the English model: the time, it is hoped, will soon arrive, when a difference, so obvious to the meanest capacity, shall no longer exist between two countries by nature so intimately connected. In garb, in manners, in government, we are the same; and if the same language were spoken on both sides of the Tweed, some small diversity in our laws and ecclesiastical establishments excepted, no striking mark of distinction would remain between the sons of England and Caledonia. The Author of this little performance, with pleasure contributes his mite to a purpose so truly desirable. 30\n\nSinclair sees the repression of linguistic difference as essential to his political and social scheme of the cultural assimilation of successful Scots into an Anglocentric British mould. Like those of several Scottish 'improvers', Sinclair's linguistic efforts were only part of wider cultural and agricultural concerns. Tutored by Hugh Blair's literary friend John Logan, Sinclair published his first works in 17 69. 31 These were letters to the Caledonian Mercury, written in response to complaints about the unjust treatment of Highlanders driven to emigrate to America during the Clearances. Sinclair protests himself a patriot, yet one who finds it hard to believe 'that the departure of a few factious and idle Highlanders would prove detrimental to these united kingdoms ... iet them be transported to a country, where they may find a nation perhaps as savage as themselves, and, if possible, equally destitute of the least appearance of religion and virtue'. 32 If Sinclair saw the worst of the Highlanders as savages, he saw himself as an improver who wished, as he put it, to 'Kentify Caithness'. 33 As well as 'improving' the Highlands, Sinclair was the moving force behind the vast Statistical Account of Scotland, which, through the offices of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, anthologized a great data bank, a general assembly of geographical, commercial, demographic, and ethnological information Sinclair, Scottish Dialect, pp. iii, 2, 9-10.

This careful setting-in-order of Scottish material was conducted with a view to the better ordering of an improved Scotland. As an informational anthology, Sinclair's work is a major cultural achievement, fit to stand beside the Encyclopaedia Britannica as a highlight of eighteenth-century Scottish culture. His endeavours in furthering the Protestant, English-speaking Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge and his proscribing of Scotticisms were other aspects of the virtuous desire to improve; all helped Sinclair in his career in British government service. In information, as in lexis, he knew how to manipulate the discourse of power. Sinclair's work was far from alone. Another purger of Scots speech and Scotticisms was the spelling reformer, James Elphinston, whose Propriety Ascertained in Her Picture ( 1786-7) devoted almost all its second volume to examining the 'Scottish Dialect' and seeing how to get rid of such 'deviacions from dhe purity ov LONDON'. Elphinston held up Sinclair's work as a glorious example of how 'Dhe patriot wished indeed, not onely by discriminating dhe dialects to' reunite dhe kingdoms; but to' render INGLISH PROPRIETY, first accessibel in evvery part of dhe iland, and dhen in evvery quarter ov dhe globe.' 34 If Elphinston was attracted to world-dominating regularity, numerous other writers-like the Aberdeen poet, philosopher, and academic James Beattie, like James Bannantine, and like Hugh Mitchell-all had the more modest aim of removing from the writing of Scottish authors those linguistic indicators of cultural difference, Scotticisms. 35 Beattie had corresponded with Sinclair over the matter of Scotticisms, and the two utilized each other's work. Beattie's list includes Scotticisms drawn from the work of Scottish writers such as Smollett (who is accused of writing 'to take on for a soldier' instead of to 'inlist' [sic]). Beattie ends his work with 'An Exercise', a passage composed so as to contain a large quantity of italicized Scotticisms. Of this he writes defensively: These idioms are thus huddled together, by way of exercise, to young Scotch people, who may have been reading this pamphlet. But the English 34 James Elphinston, Propriety Ascertained in her Picture (2 vols.; London: Jon Walter, 1786-7), ii, pp. i and ii. 35 [James Beattie), Scoticisms Arranged in Alphabetical Order, Designed to Correct Improprieties of Speech and Writing (Edinburgh: William Creech, 1787); James Bannantine, Letter and list of Scotticisms in the Monthly Magazine, Dec. 1798, 434-9; Hugh Mitchell, Scotticisms, Vulgar Anglicisms, and Grammatical Improprieties Corrected (Glasgow: Falconer and Willison, 1799).\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n27\n\nreader will not suppose, that people of education in North Britain speak so uncouth a dialect. Many of them use a correct phraseology. Yet I fear there may be some (in the lower and middle ranks there are many thousands) who would read this exercise, without suspecting that there is any thing exceptionable in the style of it. 36\n\nScots seeking to progress m British institutions were genuinely troubled by the way in which their language threatened to hinder them; their position resembles in many ways that of many presentday 'provincial' speakers. A London Scottish correspondent in the Monthly Magazine for 1798 contributes a list of Scotticisms and anecdotes, warning that Scotticisms can divert attention from a speaker's subject-matter, leading him to lose political and other arguments. So, for example, Mr MONTGOMERY, now chief baron of the court of Exchequer, in Scotland, when lord advocate and member for Peeblesshire, made a speech on some important question, in the house of commons, where he mentioned his having made a note of something or other with a keeliveyne pen-the members, puzzled to discover the meaning of this outlandish word, and amused with the ridiculousness of it, had their attention altogether diverted from the argument of the speech-The right honourable orator meant a pencil. 37\n\nHere, picking a linguistic curio from Montgomery's speech, his largely English auditors perform an action as subtly patronizing and damaging as that of James Joyce's English Jesuit dean in the fifth chapter of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, who ignores Stephen Dedalus's arguments, choosing to seize instead on his use of the word 'tundish'. The questions of attitude to language which preoccupied eighteenth-century Scots have far from vanished from the Englishspeaking world. All climates are in some way prejudicial, but it is in the context of this particular eighteenth-century Scottish cultural climate that the development of the university teaching of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, the forerunner of English Literature, should be viewed. If John Stevenson was the herald of the new subject, it really expanded in the mid-eighteenth century under the guidance of the man who, at Glasgow University in 17 51, became the most important person since Stevenson to offer an official university course in English which covered the technique and appreciation of modern writers in that 36\n\n[Beattie], Scoticisms, 2, 97, 121.\n\n37\n\nBannantine, Letter and list, 434-5.\n\n28\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\nlanguage as well as writers in the classical tongues. This man was Adam Smith. It may seem strange that Smith is a progenitor of English studies, but his linguistic and literary work, like his work on economics, jurisprudence, and proto-anthropology, is part of the project of 'improvement'. If aspiring business men would profit from the ideas of the Wealth of Nations, there was also profit to be made from studying literary texts that, as models of English propriety, would impro~e and correct the language and taste of men ambitious to hold public office. In the development of English studies, as in Smith's other concerns, economics mattered. Smith had been a student at Glasgow under Francis Hutcheson ('father' of the Scottish Enlightenment); afterwards he had spent several years at Balliol College, Oxford, holding the prestigious Snell Exhibition. Then, in 1746, before his Exhibition had come to its end, he had done a surprising thing. He had gone home to Kirkcaldy in Fife. It was Lord Kames who realized that the Smith who had returned after six years in Oxford might be something of a national asset. Encouraged by Kames, Smith 'was induced to turn his early studies to the benefit of the public, by reading a course of Lectures on Rhetoric and the Belles Lettres . . . to a respectable auditory, chiefly composed of students in law and theology'. Among Smith's audience was Alexander Wedderburn, who published Smith's work in the Edinburgh Review of 17 55-6, where the editorial concerned itself with 'the difficulty of a proper expression in a country where there is no standard of language, or at least one very remote'. Also in Smith's Edinburgh audience was Hugh Blair, the future Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University. Smith's lectures appealed to Scots who were upwardly mobile: he offered the chance to hear 'proper English' spoken, as well as advice about what constituted good style and examples of great English stylists. 38 In Edinburgh Smith was lecturing to an audience of ambitious citizens, but in 1751 the lectures themselves became part of an official university curriculum when Smith was appointed a professor at Glasgow University. After he moved there to take up the Chair of Logic, he continued to teach Rhetoric and Belles Lettres to his 'private' class (the class to which the professor taught his own subject of special interest). Notes on these lectures were discovered in 1958 by John Lothian; the most complete scholarly edition, edited by John 38\n\nFor these passages and for fuller information, see Smith, Lectures, 7-23.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n29\n\nBryce, appeared in 1983 as part of the Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith. Despite Professor Bryce's exemplary edition, the full significance of Smith's work and its impact has yet to be assessed. W. S. Howell has set Smith's work against the framework of traditional Rhetoric-a necessary approach, but one which distorts what was particularly important about Smith's work in a mideighteenth-century Scotland confused about the proper language of Scottish culture. 39 In this context, Smith's work is seen as being at the root of what constitutes the university canon of English Literature, and also at the root of the struggle between vernaculars and the standard English language, both issues which were central not just to the Scottish tradition, but also to the international English-speaking world in the centuries which followed. The Smith who had decided to give up Oxford did not berate his Glasgow students for being Scottish, but he did subtly stress the need to conform to southern English linguistic models. Our words must not only be English and agreeable to the custom of the country but likewise to the custom of some particular part of the nation ... It is the custom of the people that forms what we call propri[ e ]ty, and the custom of the better sort from whence the rules of purity of stile are to be drawn. As those of the higher rank generally frequent the court, the standard of our language is therefore chiefly to be met with there ... 40\n\nSuch a point would have had a particular significance for Smith's Scottish audience. 'We in this country are most of us very sensible 39 Wilbur Samuel Howell, Eighteenth-Century British Logic and Rhetoric (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1971), 536-76. It should be said that, though Howell's interest in the emergence of modern from Classical models of Rhetoric prevents him discussing the significantly 'provincial' importance of writers such as Smith, Blair, Barron, and Witherspoon, he does acknowledge that the development of the eighteenth-century elocutionary movement associated with Rhetoric was significantly provincial: 'During the eighteenth century the British became aware that the many forms which their language had in various districts of England, and the many differences which existed between London English, on the one hand, and Scottish or Irish or American English, on the other, were no longer to be regarded merely as attractive and desirable variations from locality to locality, but as positive hindrances to the cultural, political, commercial, and occupational welfare of a growing and dynamic world empire.' (p. 156.) Howell's book does not aim to chronicle the history of English Literature as a university discipline, but it is valuable to all interested in the subject. He is also unusual in mentioning in his concluding paragraphs 'the capacity of the new rhetoric of eighteenth-century Scotland to bring about the development of English Literature as a field of study in nineteenth-century American and British universities' (p. 716). 40 Smith, Lectures, 4-5.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n30\n\nthat the perfection of language is very different from that we commonly speak in. ' 41 Having made this point, Smith spends no time in lambasting his audience for its Scotticisms; the records we have of eighteenth-century university lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres contain very little of that. But they do operate subtly, using significant exclusion, insinuation, and implicit guidance to point their audiences clearly in the direction of Anglocentric (though not solely English) Britishness. What Smith offers his audience is not only an education in Rhetoric as it was conventionally understood, but also the opportunity as Scots to confront a pure English style. The medium of his own lecturesEnglish, not Latin-was an important part of this, as early testimonials to his pure, un-Scottish style demonstrate. The literary material presented was also important. In his particular praise of Swift, whose 'language is more English than any other writer that we have', Smith directs attention to a model oflinguistic purity. 42 Again, one of the most important points is implicit. Like Smith's teacher, Francis Hutcheson, Swift was an Irishman with an admired English style, proof that it was possible for the provincial un- Englishman to upstage the London aristocrat if only he tried hard enough. Another subtle point, left entirely implicit, is that, when exemplifying the sounds to be avoided when trying 'to speak English with the proper accent', Smith begins with the [x] sound. 43 This attack on the most distinctive Scots linguistic shibboleth, the [x] sound of words like 'loch', went hand in hand with a devaluing of writing in Scots, which is remarked on either not at all or else in terms which present it as barbarous or primitive. As an early nineteenth-century Scotsman recognized, the task of the successful eighteenth-century Scottish writer involved 'guarding his diction against the words and phrases which he naturally spoke'. 44 Such guarding, necessary for the promotion of a British ethos, often seemed to involve a turningaway from the distinctively Scottish. Indeed, Smith's lectures contain so few Scottish references that, particularly in view of the circumstances in which they were delivered, this must have been deliberate policy. There are just sufficient quirks to pinpoint Smith's country of birth; only a Scotsman would have been likely to yoke together Pompey and Robert the Bruce, and one may detect a hint of pique 42 Ibid. 4. 43 Ibid. 15. Ibid. 42. Sir .James Mackintosh, Miscellaneous Works (3 vols.; London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1846), ii. 486. 41\n\n44\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n31\n\nwhen, classifying Clarendon as a partial historian, Smith points out how he spends considerable time on minor affairs in the English Court, while 'he discusses in two or three sentences all the actions of Montrose in Scotland tho' of the Greatest importance'. 45 But no Scottish poetry is mentioned in Smith's lecture on poetry, though recent collections of Scots verse, such as Allan Ramsay's Ever Green (1724) and Tea-Table Miscellany (1724-37), had fought to stress that poetry in the Scots tongue was not only a hardy perennial but also fit to be admitted to polite society. The 1781 catalogue of Smith's library (now in Tokyo) shows not only that he maintained an interest in the development of Rhetoric teaching throughout his life, owning such works as Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric, his pupil William Richardson's pioneering study of Shakespear's Remarkable Characters, and a synopsis of lectures on Belles Lettres at St Andrews University, but also that he owned copies of several important works of eighteenth-century and earlier Scottish Literature, including the works of Drummond of Hawthornden, Macpherson's Fingal and Temora, Ramsay's Poems and Ever Green, Bannatyne's Ancient Scottish Poems, and a collection of Scottish Tragic Ballads. Yet one of the most interesting features of Smith's lectures is that Allan Ramsay is not mentioned. A Scottish acquaintance of Smith's recalled that Smith disliked Ramsay because that poet (who used distinctively Scots forms) did not write like a gentleman. 46 The only lecture in which Smith does briefly demonstrate his familiarity with the Scottish poetic tradition is not his lecture on poetry; rather, he mentions Scots poetry as part of his explanation of how poetry precedes prose in society's progression from a primitive to a refined state. Detailed examination of this passage shows the workings of Smith's mind-how he skilfully associates Scots writing with the widely scorned Gaelic (the supposed primitive 'Erse' of the recently published Ossianic poems), and then moves swiftly on, in a discrediting anthropological glide, to 'the most Rude and Barbarous nations' and African 'savages', which are contrasted with a culture of commerce, modern security, and urban refinement-exactly the sort of society that the study of proper English models would further in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Smith's subject here was, appropriately, Smith, Lectures, 129-30, 115. Tadao Yanaihara, A Full and Detailed Catalogue of Books which Belonged to Adam Smith (Tokyo: lwanami Shoten, 1951), 75, 89,91-2, 107. 119; anon., 'Anecdotes ... of the Late Adam Smith' (1791), repr. in Smith, Lectures, 230. 45\n\n46\n\n32\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n'the Language of Business', which he showed as more highly developed than the earlier, apparently more 'difficult', language of poetry. It will no doubt seem at first sight very surprising that a species of writin[g) so vastly more difficult should be in all countries prior to that in which men naturally express themselves. Thus in Greece Poetry was arrived to its greatest Perfection before the beauties of Prose were at all studied. At Rome there had lived several! poets of considerable merit before Eloquen[ ce J was cultivated in any tollerable degree. There were English poets of very great reputation before [before) any tollerable prose had made its appearance. We have also several! poetical! works in the old Scots Language, as Hardyknute, Cherry and the Slae, Tweedside, Lochaber, and Wallace Wight in the original! Scotts but not one bit of tollerable prose. The Erse poetry as appears from the translations lately published have very great merit but we never heard of any Erse prose. This indeed may appear very unnatural that what is most difficult[y) should be that in which the Barbarous least civilized nations most excel! in; but it will not be very difficult to account for it. The most barbarous and rude nations after the labors of the day are over have their hours of merryment and Recreation; and enjoyment with one another; dancing and Gambolling naturally make a part of these dive[ r)sions; and this dancing must be attended with music. The Savage nations on the coast of Africa, after they have sheltered themselves thro the whole day in caves and grottos from the scorching heat of the Sun come out in the evening and dance and sing together. Poetry is a necessary attendant on musick, especially on vocal! musick the most natural! and simple of any. They naturally express some thoughts along with their musick and these must of consequence be formed into verse to suit with the music. Thus it is that Poetry is cultivated in the most Rude and Barbarous nations, often to a considerable perfection, whereas they make no attempts towards the improvement of Prose. Tis the Introduction of Commerce or at least of opulence which is commonly the attendent of Commerce which first brings on the improvement of Prose.Opulence and Commerce commonly precede the improvement of arts, and refinement of every Sort. I do not mean that the improvement of arts and refinement of manners are the necessary consequence of Commerce, the Dutch and the Venetians bear testimony against me, but only that [it] is a necessary requisite. Wherever the Inhabitants of a city are rich and opulent, where they enjoy the necessaries and conveniences of life in ease and Security, there the arts will be cultivated and refinement of manners a neverfailing attendent. 47\n\nA phrase such as 'the old Scots language' is a way of writing off Scots as obsolete; work in it is seen as paralleling the 'merryment' of 'least 47\n\nSmith, Lectures, 136-7.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n33\n\ncivilized nations'. The models for university study which Smith puts forward in Glasgow are entirely non-Scottish. His lectures are a means of translating his audience, subtly alienating it from the language of its own culture. In his work of translation, Smith was hoping to benefit his Scottish auditors. Yet any culture separated from the language of its heritage faces enormous problems. At Glasgow University the subject which Smith had introduced was continued by George Jardine from 1774 to 1824 in his 'system of lectures on general grammar, rhetoric, and belles lettres', which included 'the elements of taste and criticism, and ... the rules of composition, with a view to the promotion of a correct style, illustrated by examples'. Some of his students, including Francis Jeffrey, formed an Elocution Society. 48 The teaching of Belles Lettres was also developing at Aberdeen and St Andrews. In the former, George Campbell, a friend of Hugh Blair, was developing material for his Philosophy of Rhetoric in the late 1750s. At St Andrews Robert Watson, who had secured the approbation of David Hume and Lord Kames for his public lectures in Edinburgh on language, style, and Rhetoric, was appointed Professor of Logic, Rhetoric, and Metaphysics at St Salvator's College. But the teaching of Belles Lettres was most celebrated at Edinburgh University, where a member of Smith's earlier Edinburgh audience became a lecturer in Rhetoric and Belles Lettres in 17 59 and Professor in 1762. This man was Hugh Blair, whose bestselling Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres (published in 1783) both acknowledge a debt to Smith's work and take it further. Blair's first biographer saw the Professorship as entailing 'the task of forming the taste of the rising generation'. Blair was one of those, we are told, who worked 'with a generous view to improve literature in Scotland, where, though it had begun to dawn, it was but little advanced'. Blair stresses his lectures' unique potential to 'improve' their audience and 'cultivate their Taste'. Linguistic care was seen as the distinguishing feature of behaviour. 'Among nations in a civilized state, no art has been cultivated with more care, than that of language, style, and composition.' 'Taste is a most improveable [sic] faculty.' 49 Rather than being satisfied with the 48 George Jardine, Outlines rif Philosophical Education (Glasgow: no publisher given, 1818), title-page; see also entry on Jardine in Robert Chambers (ed.), A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, rev. Thomas Thomson (London: Blackie, 1875); for the Elocution Society, see McElroy, Scotland's Age of Improvement, 123. 49 John Hill, Life rif Hugh Blair (Edinburgh: T. Cadell and W. Davies, 1807), 24-5; Blair, Lectures, i, pp. iv, 2, 19.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n34\n\nbrief examples of good English given by Smith and Jardine, Blair gives numerous extended quotations, intended as practical guides to eloquence. A series of 'Critical Examinations' subjects essays from the Spectator and passages of Swift to minute scrutiny. One senses that, from the given examples, a canon is developing of writers who are approved for their proper English style. Like Smith, Blair avoids labouring any hostility towards writing in Scots; he simply concentrates on English models, taking it for granted that 'pure' style must be 'without Scotticisms or Gallicisms'. 5 Composing his lectures slightly later than Smith, Blair is occasionally able to introduce the work of Scottish writers as exemplifying such pure English. So, for instance, to illustrate the correct use of the words 'with' and 'by', Blair is able to point out how 'The proper distinction in the use of these particles, is elegantly marked in a passage of Dr. Robertson's History of Scotland.' The Edinburgh friends Blair and Robertson revised each other's writings prior to publication. 51 In his literary orientation Blair was a defender of what he saw as Scottish excellence, but that excellence had to be of the 'proper English' variety. He was a conscious Briton, writing of 'Our Island', at the same time as lacking no alacrity in championing such respectable Scottish eminences as the Latinist George Buchanan. 52 As a Scot, Blair manifested peculiar daring in his excursions into detailed criticism of the language of Addison (a favourite subject of the Lectures). What is particularly interesting is that, where Smith had almost entirely avoided mention of literature produced in Scotland, Blair's cultural patriotism leads him to devote rather more attention to Scottish works, and even to discuss Ramsay's pastoral, The Gentle Shepherd. Here an awkwardness manifests itself: on the one hand, Blair is anxious to claim merit for the Scottish writer and to encourage 'improved' writing in Scotland; but, on the other, he is uneasy about the way in which The Gentle Shepherd employed Scots as well as English. Like Smith, Blair tries to historicize Scots, seeing it as simply 'the old rustic dialect' and so fatally limited, yet at the same time clearly wishing to inscribe this Scottish presence into his approved canon of 'Pastoral Poetry'.\n\nÂ°\n\nI must not omit the mention of another Pastoral Drama, which will bear being brought into comparison with any composition of this kind, in any 50 52\n\nBlair, Lectures, i. 187. Blair, Lectures, ii. 284.\n\n51\n\nIbid. 201; Hill, Hugh Blair, 179.\n\nThe Invention of English Literature\n\n35\n\nlanguage; that is, Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd. It is a great disadvantage to this beautiful Poem, that it is written in the old rustic dialect of Scotland, which, in a short time, will probably be entirely obsolete, and not intelligible; and it is a farther disadvantage, that it is so entirely formed on the rural manners of Scotland, that none but a native of that country can thoroughly understand, or relish it. 53\n\nLike Smith, Blair engages not only with Classical writing and with the accepted English classic writers (such as Shakespeare and Addison), but also with modern writing. In the latter area there are several slight, but important, attempts to make the new English voice of Scotland (the voice, usually, of Blair's own friends) speak its part in correct literature. So, for instance, the 'Scottish Homer', William Wilkie, author of The Epigoniad (1757), is included in the consideration of epic, while john Home's 1756 Scottish drama Douglas (which David Hume at one time thought superior to Shakespeare) is regarded as worthy of consideration alongside the work of Euripides, Shakespeare, and Racine. 54 Knowledge of Home's play is taken for granted by Blair, as is knowledge of the Scottish text with which his name has come to be most intimately associated: the poems of Ossian. 'The Substance' of Blair's Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian, the Son of Fingal 'was delivered by the Author in the Course of his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres, in the University of Edinburgh', but the Dissertation was published in 1763 and is not contained in the published Lectures of twenty years later. 55 What is conspicuous there, though, is Blair's assumption that the reader's knowledge of Ossian's work can be taken for granted. Its popularity came about partly because the Ossianic poems represented a valorization not of those contemporary Highlanders so despised by Sir John Sinclair, but of the antique Gael, and because the poems appeared not in the barbarous language of Gaelic, but in a decorous 'translatorese' which harmonized beautifully with eighteenth-century standards of propriety. Blair delighted in the way in which the Ossianic poems combined 'the fire and the enthusiasm of the most early times' with 'an amazing degree of regularity and art', so that compared, for instance, with early Scandinavian poems, these Highland artworks seemed 'a fertile and cultivated country'; but his Lectures presented Gaelic as clearly both ancient and obsolete. 56 Like the Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles 53 55\n\nIbid. 351-3.
