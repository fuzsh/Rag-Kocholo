        "text": "The Scottish National Party is a progressive social democratic party and is the only party with Scotland’s interest at its heart. It’s key aim is independence for Scotland.\n\nBrief History\n\nA high point for the party was in the 1974 General Election polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. However, the party experienced a large drop in its support at the 1979 General election, followed by a further drop at the 1983 election.\n\nIn the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election the SNP emerged as the largest party with 47 seats and Alex Salmond became First Minister of Scotland.\n\nIn the Holyrood 2011 election, the SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament with 69 seats. This was somewhat unusual as the Labour Westminster Government designed, in 1999, the Additional Member system to prevent any party gaining overall control of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nBased on the 2011 majority, the SNP government held a Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014. The “No” vote prevailed in a close-fought campaign with only 45% of Scottish voters saying YES, prompting the resignation of First Minister, Alex Salmond and his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, being voted in as the leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland.\n\nNicola Sturgeon led the party to an outstanding result in the UK general election in May 2015. The party went from holding 6 seats in the House of Commons to 56, mostly at the expense of the Labour Party. Only 3 of the 59 constituencies did not elect an SNP candidate. The number of MP’s has varied but still continue to be a strong voice for Scotland at Westminster.\n\nConstitution and Structure\n\nThe primary level of the party’s organisation are the local Branches. All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association which are composed of delegates from all of the branches within the constituency.\n\nThe Constituency Association coordinates the work of the branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency and acts as a point of liaison between MSP or MP and the party.\n\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. Members of each branch can attend as delegates who can vote on the resolutions presented to the Conference. If you wish to attend as a delegate please contact the Branch Secretary on secretary@westfifesnp.com or our Convener on convener@westfifesnp.com."
