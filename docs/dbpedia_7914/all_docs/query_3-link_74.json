Some stubborn people thought it had been answered decisively by the Scots’ unexpected victory in June 1314 on the battlefield at Bannockburn – a triumph celebrated in epic and still sung about today. Other, equally stubborn people were sure that the question had been given a more modern but just as dusty answer when the Scottish Parliament – encouraged, as Robert Burns put it, by ‘English gold’ – voted for Union along with the English Parliament in 1707.1 A third group of folk, uncertain and wearied by the promises and counter-promises of Scotland’s twenty-first-century ‘neverendum’, wonder if the issue may go on being argued about for at least the next 700 years. Yoking the medieval Battle of Bannockburn to Scotland’s 2014 political arguments is asking for trouble. Yet in modern democratic politics the very terms used – campaigning, tactics, contest, struggle, jousting, victory – carry persistent military undertones. Always mobile, whether in reports or in stories, language skids through implications and ambiguities in directions that we cannot entirely control. Similarly, voters’ attitudes are guided on occasion by think-tanks’ and journalists’ supposedly neutral facts and figures, but at least as often by myths, beliefs, jokes, cherished ideals. It is naïve to regard this as foolish. Mythology, imagination and the play of literature\n\n2 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 are not separate from real life: they are important parts of the historical process because they encapsulate and engender values, losses and gains. Our stories matter. They help make us who we are both at individual and societal levels. They should not be dismissed as ‘mere stories’. Codifying what we love, loathe, laugh at, or are excited by, literary imagination defines us more fully and subtly than does any economic balance sheet or political slogan. History and imagination combine in surprising ways. For connoisseurs and casual observers of sport in Scotland, the date 2014 means Glasgow’s proud hosting of the Commonwealth Games. For an international assortment of admirably bookish people it signals the 200th birthday of Walter Scott’s globally influential Scoto-British novel Waverley. But for far more folk with Scottish interests the date 2014 marks the historic political referendum on national independence, which just happens to coincide dismally with the centenary year of the outbreak of World War I – and, perhaps more mischievously, with the 700th anniversary of the Scots’ spectacular victory over that English army at Bannockburn. Like it or not, old and recent conflicts, memories of carnage from Gettysburg to Baghdad, from El Alamein to Culloden, are a stubbornly insistent part of all national narratives. Even in modern-day Europe at least two crucial fourteenth-century battles for independence have gone on playing an ineradicable part in the literature and thought of small nations. That this should be so is at once undeniable and, like a lacerating thistle, rebarbatively hard to grasp. In Scotland’s case no one has set out in detail the way the 1314 battle of Bannockburn reverberates throughout seven succeeding centuries of imaginative writing; yet for Serbia, the literary and political repercussions of the 1389 battle of Kosovo have been chronicled with all too convincing and disturbing results by Branimir Anzulovic´.2 Kosovo (a medieval defeat for the Serbs at the hands of the Ottoman Empire) has been at least as important for Serbian literary and political history as has Bannockburn for the Scots. As with Bannockburn, Kosovo was sung in ballads and poems before passing into imaginative and historiographical prose. It continues to be a crucial reference point. In 1985, some time before the most recent outbreak of\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nconflict in the area then known as Yugoslavia, as a young poet and editor I talked with Miodrag Pavlovic´, a writer influenced by T. S. Eliot as well as by the literary inheritance of his native Serbo-Croat. I was struck by the intensity with which Pavlovic´’s poetry interrogated fourteenth-century havoc. Here was verse convinced that after the historic slaughter of the battlefield, through literature ‘our nakedness will be clothed with words’.3 Verbal art can clothe, memorialise, morph and even prolong conflict. Branimir Anzulovic´ shows how disastrously this has happened in the case of Serbian nationalism. The relevant corpus of imaginative writing runs from medieval celebratory ballads through later epic-length poems including The Mountain Wreath (1847) by Vladika Petar Petrovic´ Njegoš to twentiethcentury fiction and verse, most notorious of which is the poetry of the former Columbia University creative-writing student and admirer of Walt Whitman, Radovan Karadžic´. No poet in history has been more notorious for wartime atrocities. To read about the relationship between literary imagination and Serbian independence is to encounter a ‘glorification of genocide’ in the Romantic-era Mountain Wreath, which between 1847 and 1913 was ‘the most widely read literary work among the Serbs’, and was known ‘by heart’ by the Serbian terrorist Gavrilo Princip whose assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand sparked World War I. That glorification continues in works including the popular modern Bosnian Serb Vuk Draškovic´’s The Knife, with its celebration of the slaughter of Muslims, and culminates in the atrocities of Karadžic´ and Slobodan Miloševic´ who ‘followed’ the ‘precept’ of modern Serbian novelist Dobrica C´osic´.4 C´osic´ argues for the literary importance of ‘national mythology’ and ‘above all . . . the Kosovo myth’.5 In writing Bannockburns, I have kept in mind the example of Kosovo. This has made it all the more important to confront head-on the bloody and vitriolic anti-Englishness of some of the literary works discussed here, from Blind Hary’s medieval Wallace to its recent descendant Braveheart. Certainly there have been craven celebrations of political martyrology and slaughter in works championing Scottish independence. Overall, however, it would be perverse even for those most opposed to what the Scottish nationalist theorist Tom Nairn terms ‘the break-up of\n\n4 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 Britain’ (and what his British Unionist opponents sometimes term ‘Balkanisation’) to argue that Scottish ­independence and literary imagination have combined to produce anything like the atrocities of modern Serb nationalism.6 True, there are moments of bloodthirstiness to be found even in the work of Enlightenmentera democratic poets including the Robert Burns of ‘Scots, wha hae wi’ Wallace bled’.7 Yet the ideals of Bannockburn have been linked to modern warfare less by singers of Scottish independence than by writers committed to imperial British nationalism. Following the 1914 celebrations of the battle of Bannockburn, British ‘Kossovo Day’ celebrations of World War I (encouraged by such Scottish or Scottish-influenced figures as Elsie Inglis and the writer H. W. Seton-Watson) were designed to bolster loyalty to the militant British Empire. What is so striking about the modern ideal of Scottish independence and its literary imaginings is that no one has died for them. They have advanced not through battlefield bloodshed, but through democratic elections and referenda. Battles, like democratic nations, are seldom straightforward. My title, Bannockburns, uses a plural noun to suggest that the singular occurrence at Bannockburn on 23–4 June 1314 has long since become many Bannockburns. It has been reenvisioned in other contexts by writers in quite different eras. This book’s title also winks towards Robert Burns. His ‘Bruce to his Troops on the Eve of the Battle of Bannock-burn’ made him, almost 500 years after the conflict, both that battle’s greatest literary celebrant and the master-poet of modern democratic ideals. The following chapters acknowledge that the contest to preserve Scottish independence in the Middle Ages was, as Burns recognised, persistently bloody. Its masculinist militarism has been an important part of its literary legacies and may have conditioned the temper of its nation. Still, with the notable exception of Braveheart, it is noticeable how far recent imaginings of Scottish independence in literature and politics have attempted to carry forward ideals of freedom while moving away from battlefield violence. Modern Scottish literature is as far from Tacitus’s Calgacus, that first-century Caledonian freedom-fighter and opponent of Roman imperialism, as it is from medievalising Serbian mythology. If, at first, setting the\n\nIntroduction 5\n\ncultural legacy of Kosovo beside that of Bannockburn provokes thoughts of similarity, ultimately it reveals lasting differences. Bannockburns, then, is the first book-length consideration of how the ideal of Scottish independence has spurred, been sparked by and generally come into contact with writerly imaginations. Examining work from eight centuries, much of what follows deals with writing by and about men – some straight, some gay; this preponderance of males may be inevitable (little work by medieval and Renaissance Scottish women survives), but is also emblematic of continuing problems. Polls suggest Scottish independence is more popular among male than among female voters. In the gendering of Scottish identity and political life, some have argued, women are doubly ‘decentred’: by gender as well as by nationality.8 I leave that possibility for readers to ponder, and have resisted the temptation to co-opt for my literary-political topic fictions such as those of Janice Galloway, A. L. Kennedy and Alice Thompson which at times imagine in Scottish contexts the pain of the past, yet do not explicitly (or even, perhaps, implicitly) engage with the issue of the independence of the Scottish nation. For different reasons, I have omitted consideration of popular historical works and speculative thrillers such as those of Nigel Tranter, John Connell and Douglas Hurd since several of the best of these have been considered by Craig Buchanan in his contribution to Caroline McCracken Flesher’s innovative edited volume, Culture, Nation, and the New Scottish Parliament (2007).9 Future writers on literature and independence may address the topics of gender, Jacobitism, Gaelic and popular culture in a different idiom and at greater length. Yet whether they take their bearings from the literary quotations set into the Scottish Parliament’s Canongate Wall or from theorists as influential as Benedict Anderson or Homi Bhabha, they are likely to conclude that literary imagination is shaped by and helps to configure the political imaginary: the way a group – in this case a nation – articulates itself.10 Poets are alert to this. The title of at least one modern Scottish poetry anthology – Dream State, first published several years before the establishment of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 – sums it up with nice ambiguity.11 Often, the literary process of recording, dreaming and recounting a\n\n6 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 story of national independence develops over centuries. Yet there is not one unchanging entity called ‘Scottish independence’. The meaning of those words is hardly the same in 2014 as it was in 1314. Nor is there one essentialist ‘literary imagination’. Perhaps after the word Bannockburns this book’s subtitle should have gone on to flourish a knowing plurality of further plural nouns, but I hope that one is enough. Many of the works discussed here come from Scotland itself. A significant number of them, though, have been produced beyond the nation’s borders – whether in England or Canada, Australia or the United States. Though it surveys 700 years of writing, Bannockburns does not claim to be fully comprehensive. Literature in the sense of creative writing is at its heart; but the chapters that follow also pay a small amount of attention to film (how could I ignore Braveheart?) and to the scripting of history, whether by eloquent medieval chroniclers or by that influential colossus, Walter Scott. About half the volume is devoted to literature written before 1900, the other half to work produced since. In the last century Modernist-era writers did much to shape and inspire campaigns for Scottish self-government, while, more recently, authors from Edwin Morgan, Alasdair Gray and Liz Lochhead to David Greig, James Robertson and Kathleen Jamie have seen their works become part of political debate. While its idiom is that of literary history, this is not a history of Scottish literature: I have produced that elsewhere, in Scotland’s Books. Other recent histories include volumes authored by Roderick Watson, and those co-written by large teams of contributors under the editorship of Ian Brown, Marco Fazzini, Douglas Gifford and colleagues.12 All have shown Scottish literature to be adventurously protean, and some people might argue there is no need for further panoramic surveys of Scottish literary history just now, until Scottish criticism and theory have faced up to so much recent literary historiography. Still, one positive result of this burgeoning of literary histories is that only a fool would argue Scottish imaginative writers should confine themselves to addressing the constitutional position of Scotland. That is certainly not my contention here. All literatures are\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nresiliently porous; gleefully, imaginations go wherever they like. Yet this book has a deliberate and timely selective focus: it attends to imaginative works that deal explicitly with Scottish independence. Relatively few creative writers have concentrated on this theme. Many of Scotland’s most celebrated authors – from Robert Henryson to Muriel Spark and beyond – have avoided it. Nonetheless, Bannockburn and the topos of Scottish independence have remained, in the historian Pierre Nora’s terms, crucial ‘sites of memory’.13 The literary portrayal and transmission of them is part of that ‘cultural identity’ which, the theorist Jan Assmann argues, is communicated through ‘reusable texts, images, and rituals specific to each society in each epoch, whose “cultivation” serves to stabilize and convey that society’s self-image’.14 Assmann’s formulation is useful, but while Bannockburn and Scottish independence have such a function in Scotland, they can work also to unsettle the status quo. Published in the year that marks the 700th anniversary of the battle, Bannockburns is intended as a contribution to political arguments about the Scottish nation as well as a focused addition to recent literary scholarship. It aims to add nuance, depth and elements of surprise to vigorous continuing debates. Twentieth- and twenty-first-century thinkers as different as Jürgen Habermas and Peter Sloterdijk have cherished the importance of literature in the constitution of the public sphere.15 However, some observers still regard creative writing as peripheral to today’s politics. Such readers may have statistics on their side. In their 2012 study, The Scottish National Party: Transition to Power, James Mitchell, Lynn Bennie and Rob Johns analyse in detail the findings of a comprehensive survey of the membership of Scotland’s principal pro-independence party. The survey was conducted just after the SNP formed the Scottish Government of 2007. That minority administration was followed by the Nationalists’ achievement of an overall majority at Holyrood in the Scottish Parliamentary election of 2011, paving the way for the first-ever official referendum on Scottish independence. When asked what aspects of being Scottish were ‘important to you personally’, only about 20 per cent of respondents ranked ‘Scottish art, music and literature’ among their top three choices.16 Modern campaigners place\n\n8 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 far more emphasis on economics, social networking and digital media than on printed poems and stories. Yet, as the present book demonstrates, literature – from the poetry of Bannockburn eye-witnesses and of Robert Burns to bestselling Romantic-era fiction and modern drama – was and remains powerful in articulating ideals of Scottish autonomy. Writers were to the fore in the founding of the National Party of Scotland, and several continue to portray the cause of independence in addition to supporting the ‘Yes Scotland’ campaign launched in 2012. In an earlier book, Devolving English Literature (1992; 2nd edn, 2000), I set out among other things Scotland’s substantial contribution to the literary articulation of ‘Britishness’. Devolving English Literature shows how this grew in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before declining in the twentieth.17 Today there is a striking and surely revealing absence of imaginative writing from Scotland that communicates (as Scott and others once did) a positive ideology of Britishness. In some ways Bannockburns complements Devolving English Literature by showing how, over a longer period, Scottish independence has been presented by creative writers. For many readers the imagining of freedom may provide a ‘safety valve’, an escape from the immediate present into a fantasy ‘dream state’. Imagined Scottish independence may function as a sort of perpetual possibility for a putative and perhaps arrested national psyche preoccupied with ‘missing out’.18 Maybe such an awareness is a necessary part of the political unconscious; it need not translate into voting patterns. However, in the years leading up to the independence referendum, opinion polls have shown consistently that Scots desire further constitutional change, greater independence, whether or not as part of a modified British state. The imagining of independence in literature is part of this political pressure, fuelling it and fuelled by it. Many opinion polls conducted in Scotland before the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement on referendum arrangements, signed by British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, suggested that a majority of Scots favoured a ‘Devo Max’ option. This would have provided a maximum amount of political and fiscal devolution for Scotland, and would have moved the whole United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction 9\n\n(including that stateless nation, England, currently the only part of the UK without its own parliament) in the direction of a federation. Though Salmond was willing to entertain the idea of a ‘Devo Max’ option featuring on the independence referendum ballot paper, Cameron and his allies were not. As a result, at that time the majority of Scots lost out. The Edinburgh Agreement, confirmed by the Westminster Parliament in 2013 and subsequent deliberations in the Holyrood Parliament, specified that a referendum must present Scottish voters on 18 September 2014 with a single Yes or No question, whose wording became, ‘Should Scotland be an independent country?’ Despite sometimes insubstantial hints of ‘Devo More’, loss of the popular, if imprecisely defined, ‘Devo Max’ option led to a more polarised public debate. From the ‘Better Together’ Unionist camp came warnings that political independence would mean frightening risk, financial peril, pejorative change and no longer hosting a long-term base for nuclear weapons; it would bring, too, a period of scarcely manageable uncertainty, renegotiation of Scotland’s relationship with Europe and a revised, smaller UK, plus all the pains of separation. On the other side, the pro-independence ‘Yes’ camp envisioned a nation regaining greater control over its own affairs, managing its wealth (not least its natural resources) in a more just way, positive change and no longer hosting a long-term base for nuclear weapons; Scotland would become a nation-state like any other, renegotiating its relationship with Europe and a revised, smaller UK, rather than remaining a sort of northern province or what the British Broadcasting Corporation has sometimes termed a ‘national region’. The Scottish Government in 2012 claimed independent Scots would each be £500 better off and in 2013 asked for negotiations to clarify the terms of independence; the British Government in 2013 claimed Scots would each be £1 worse off, and refused pre-referendum negotiations. Whether the magnitude of either cash figure was likely to sway voters on the matter of their nation’s future is debatable. Having warned in 2012 about the consequences of uncertainty produced by a Scottish independence referendum, David Cameron complicated matters in 2013 by promising a future ‘in or out’ referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union\n\n10 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 – thereby creating prolonged uncertainties of his own. Many people in Scotland, as elsewhere, have grown cynical about economic forecasts and competing politicians’ financial and constitutional spin. The phrase ‘lies, damned lies, and statistics’ is hard to banish. Implicit throughout this book is the idea that Scottish independence is an issue involving long-term arguments about culture and imagination, not just immediate arguments about cash.\n\nThe written context Over the last century support for Scottish autonomy has grown markedly. Less well understood is the way in which throughout successive centuries literature has shaped and sometimes been shaped by the resilient envisioning of Scottish independence. As a poet and critic this topic has long fascinated me. Like many Scots, I have a vested interest in the debate. In the early 1990s I published my first collection of poems, A Scottish Assembly, as well as the prose of Devolving English Literature; both were contributions to the cultural climate that led to the 1999 re-establishment, after 292 years, of a Scottish parliament. In successive poetry and prose volumes I have gone on writing about Scottish-inflected themes, addressing Scots and non-Scots alike. No doubt, for good or ill, there are aspects of overlap between my practice as poet and as prose writer, but the two genres have different demands and this book does its best to avoid prose poetry. I am not a politician, or even a member of a political party, but Bannockburns makes claims for the lasting importance of literary voices as contributors to political debate. Quite rightly, arguments over whether in fact ‘poetry makes nothing happen’ will continue to be staged in seminar rooms; but Bannockburns provides support for the short-term and long-term efficacy of the literary imagination in politics – not just in Periclean Athens, in Yeats’s Ireland, or in modern Tahrir Square, but, more quietly yet still tellingly, in 2014 Glasgow and Edinburgh.19 Written in an idiom accessible to a general audience, Bannockburns is a work of literary and cultural history that\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nis, too, a political intervention. It aims to find readers outside university departments, but also, I hope, within them. Academic readers will be aware of a body of thought (including work by Anderson, Bhabha, Robert Young, and Deleuze and Guattari in Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature) that theorises how nations, not least small ones, assert their distinctiveness in writing.20 In Scottish contexts some of this has been drawn on in books by critics including Cairns Craig, Leith Davis, Ian Duncan, Susan Manning, Murray Pittock, Alan Riach, Janet Sorensen and Katie Trumpener, though there has been a tendency for many of these commentators to concentrate on particular post-Renaissance periods, especially the Romantic era, rather than thinking across a wider historical spectrum.21 If only to counterbalance smaller-scale chronological concentration, there is a good case for surveying the whole period from Bannockburn to 2014. Many different approaches could be taken to such a project. Other writers more thoroughly informed about, say, song or cyberculture, may produce their own. The sparky essay collection Unstated: Writers on Scottish Independence, edited by Scott Hames in 2012, brings together a range of authors from Kathleen Jamie to Suhayl Saadi and from James Kelman to Meaghan Delahunt. While not claiming to be representative, Hames’s book gives the cumulative and probably accurate impression that if Scottish independence had been left up to creative writers it would have been achieved long ago. Unstated as a whole has been too little read and discussed, though (often in distorted form) one of its essays, Alasdair Gray’s ‘Settlers and Colonists’ – considered in Chapter 5 below – has achieved notoriety. Hames’s thoughtful introduction apart, there is little extended work by Scottish or non-Scottish literary academics that directly addresses the context of the 2014 independence referendum. Perhaps this is because of the long gestation time involved in cultural study, but it may be due also to the complexly nuanced history of the university subject of ‘English’ in Scotland; a topic relevant when it comes to long-running arguments about whether or not there should be some compulsory elements of Scottish literature and history in the high-school curriculum. If there was certainly a ‘Scottish invention of English literature’ as an academic subject, then the development of that\n\n12 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 specialism, whether at Edinburgh, Glasgow, or St Andrews, or in India, Australia, or America was often bound up with the deliberate suppression of markers of local cultural difference, and its history can be read in terms of cultural – and political – colonialism.22 Sometimes ‘English’ academics are reluctant to face up to such aspects of their own discipline’s partly colonial or quasi-colonial history, especially when it relates to the immediate society in which they operate. The Australian poet Les Murray’s witty line, ‘a major in English made one a minor Englishman’, has sometimes resonated awkwardly in Scotland.23 Increasingly, academic critics and theorists of Scottish writing, including Eleanor Bell, Penny Fielding, Michael Gardiner and Graeme Macdonald, have emphasised the importance of postcolonial approaches to Scottish writing as well as, in Gardiner’s case, to the formation of the literature of England in The Constitution of English Literature (2013).24 The 2011 essay collection Scottish Literature and Postcolonial Literature, edited by Gardiner, Macdonald and Niall O’Gallagher, is presented by its publisher as ‘the first full-length study of Scottish literature using a post-devolutionary understanding of postcolonial studies’.25 Today questions of national independence feature constantly in postcolonial criticism, often drawing on some of the theorists mentioned in the paragraphs above. A good example of this might be the work of Lorna Burns on Deleuze, postcolonialism and Caribbean writing.26 But sometimes there has been a reluctance on the part of postcolonial critics to address works which deal explicitly with Scottish independence, while readers outside specialist university studies can be put off by arcane terms such as ‘sinathion’.27 In Scotland, postcolonial criticism has entered the public and political sphere less readily than has literary history; and, where it has done so, it has generated more heat than light. When the distinguished New York-based postcolonial critic Robert Young, arguing that the ‘Scots’ goal must be postcolonial nationhood’, gave a lecture at the 2010 Edinburgh International Book Festival he invoked the language of historian Michael Hechter’s Internal Colonialism, stating that ‘for many it has seemed that Scotland, like Wales and Ireland, have [sic] always been de facto “internal colonies” ’. Young’s words were denounced in the press as\n\nIntroduction 13\n\n‘academic drivel’, the ‘Wallace-like’ contentions of a ‘maudlin folk singer’.28 Writing in the Scotsman, Scottish historian Keith Brown, author of those last, emotive words, declared his own ‘unionist sympathies’, scornful of ‘emotive, manipulative language’ like Young’s. Professor Young the postcolonial theorist, Professor Brown implied, was guilty of ‘sloppy thinking’.29 However, to set out in emotive and even manipulative language a sense of national independence is exactly what a considerable number of influential major as well as minor works of Scottish literature do. Particularly now, this deserves sustained attention. I hope Bannockburns may be of interest to historians and postcolonial critics. Yet, rightly or wrongly, I want to sidestep their academic fisticuffs, so what follows is not addressed to them specifically. Moreover, there seems as little point in duplicating the work of Michael Gardiner and his colleagues in Scottish Literature and Postcolonial Literature as there would be in repeating the examination of Scottish historiography in William Ferguson’s The Identity of the Scottish Nation (1998). Other commentators have written on some aspects of the material I deal with in the present book. Most notably, in several literary studies from The Invention of Scotland (1991) to Scottish and Irish Romanticism (2008) and his more ­sociologically-oriented account of Scottish politics and history since the 1960s The Road to Independence? (2008) Murray Pittock has set forth ideas of Scottish identity involving (especially Jacobite) literary nationalism; building on the work of Marinell Ash, historian Graeme Morton has written on the iconography of William Wallace; Penny Fielding in Scotland and the Fictions of Geography: North Britain, 1760–1830 (2009) has produced one of the most sophisticated recent investigations of Scotland’s relationship with Britain in the Romantic era; Carla Sassi in Why Scottish Literature Matters (2005) has authored a succinct and provocative survey; Cairns Craig has been astutely insightful about Scottish fiction, though some of his recent work in Intending Scotland (2009) has moved into philosophy and cultural theory and away from the examination of imaginative writing; while the exhumation of Hugh Trevor Roper’s elegant relic The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History (2008) made me all the more ready to realise that imaginative writers are\n\n14 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 so important precisely because they are inventive: it is Fiona Stafford’s scholarship on Ossian, not Trevor Roper’s, which is truly illuminating.30 In timely fashion Gavin Bowd’s political study Fascist Scotland (2013) has shown how, especially in the early and mid-twentieth century, extremist rhetoric has fanned potentially dangerous flames on the Unionist and nationalist sides.31 I have learned from these and other critics, but the focus of this book is different from theirs. Attentive to the past but addressed to the present, it seeks both academic readers and a wider audience interested in the literary imagining as well as the potential realisation of Scottish independence. ‘The natives of Caledonia turned to armed resistance on a large scale’ wrote Tacitus almost 2,000 years ago. In his Agricola the Latin historian put into the mouth of that first-century Caledonian chieftain Calgacus the most ringing defence of independence and resistance to imperialism produced a­ nywhere in the ancient world. Conscious that his proud and resilient northern people are threatened with loss of their freedom, Calgacus denounces Roman colonists: Pillagers of the world, they have exhausted the land by their indiscriminate plunder, and now they ransack the sea. A rich enemy excites their cupidity; a poor one, their lust for power. East and West alike have failed to satisfy them. They are the only people on earth to whose covetousness both riches and poverty are equally tempting. To robbery, butchery, and rapine, they give the lying name of ‘government’; they create a desolation and call it peace.32\n\nWhile these words (quoted surprisingly little by postcolonial thinkers) resonate widely in terms of later superpowers’ interventions, whether in the seventeenth-century Caribbean or in twenty-first-century Iraq, they scarcely apply to present-day Scotland. Not even the most inveterate supporter of independence now maintains that Scotland is being subjected to plunder, butchery and rapine at the hands of an imperial invader; indeed the late Douglas Mack showed nicely how Scottish novelists spoke for British imperialism as well as, at times, articulating a ‘subaltern’ response to it.33 Yet it is unsettling to realise that as long ago as the time of Tacitus the resistance of Caledonia could emblematise struggles for self-determination.\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nSixth-century Iona, rather than fourteenth-century Bannockburn, is the most resonantly emblematic point of origin for literature emanating from the part of the planet we now call Scotland. Still, Bannockburn retains its literary and political importance. The Bannockburns invoked in the National Theatre of Scotland’s Black Watch or in James Robertson’s sweeping novel, And the Land Lay Still, or in the poetry of Kathleen Jamie are very different from those of medieval poet John Barbour or Romantic novelist Jane Porter, but they confirm the continuing importance of the events of 1314 to literary imaginations. Perhaps Bannockburn survives in literature most movingly as a lyric cry, one at once particularly Scottish and universally recognisable. Before setting out this book’s structure in more detail, a word about tone and explication. Some readers, following their particular interests, may use the volume’s index and subheadings to select individual sections; the parts of Bannockburns can be read on their own. However, the book covers a broad spectrum and has an over-arching design. Experience suggests that several of the works discussed – especially poems in the Scots tongue from the Middle Ages and by Hugh MacDiarmid – are linguistically challenging. Moreover, few folk today have read Blind Hary and Margaret Holford, or Hamilton of Gilbertfield as well as MacDiarmid. So, throughout, I have assumed little prior knowledge of the literature I deal with, including the Bannockburn passages from the Latin Scotichronicon and the Scots poems of MacDiarmid. I have supplied some translations, summaries and glosses. My hope is that, for the sake of the big picture, specialists may tolerate at times an introductory approach applied to their own particular area; this tone is designed to make all parts of an unusually wide-ranging book welcoming to an international readership whose background may lie in literature, in history, in politics, or in none of these fields. I would like to think that a variety of readers will find something new in Bannockburns.\n\n16 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014\n\nA summary of this book As the first chapter’s title suggests, ‘Writing Bannockburn’ concentrates on how the battle was presented in poetry and prose. My focus here is on the medieval and Renaissance eras. I begin with remarkable, little-known eye-witness poetry, then relate it to the more celebrated 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, still a familiar reference point for supporters of Scottish independence. Chapter 1 also considers later, epic-length celebrations of national freedom by the Scots poets John Barbour and Blind Hary as well as the literary imagination of Walter Bower’s ambitious Scotichronicon. Through literary craft, the emblematic victory for Scottish independence resounded across the later Middle Ages, even as the ideology of a British Union began to emerge. Apparently unaffected by the Unionist propaganda of that masterpiece Macbeth, works celebrating independence continued to be published throughout the Renaissance alongside fresh imaginings of Bannockburn. Sometimes in surprising ways writers, editors and patriotic publishers ensured that the battle and its associated ideals stayed exciting as Scotland entered the early stages of the Enlightenment, and parliamentary union with England drew near. ‘Burns and Bannockburns’, the second chapter, starts by looking at the literary climate around the 1707 Union. Showing how different accounts of Bannockburn circulated in imaginative writing, it focuses on two poets – one today little remembered, the other globally celebrated. Both writers maintained and developed ideals of Scottish independence. Most of this chapter looks at what the politically loaded word ‘independence’ meant to Robert Burns. I tease out how his political articulation of that ideal intersected with his enthusiasm for Wallace, Bruce and Bannockburn. However, before turning to Burns, I discuss an intensely popular work that shaped his thinking from infancy: William Hamilton of Gilbertfield’s reworking of Blind Hary’s Wallace. Unpublished south of the Anglo-Scottish border, but enjoying a very substantial audience in Scotland during the decades after 1707, Hamilton’s poem, more than the writing of any other author, kept the ideal of independence alive. Taking up themes as well as phrasing from Hamilton, Burns developed\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nthe topic. By linking Scotland’s freedom-fighting past to the brave possibility of a democratic future, he gave the notion of his nation’s liberty an Enlightenment modernity that cut loose from the dangers of nostalgia. This chapter provides the most detailed examination to date of Burns’s creative engagement with the ideal of Scottish independence. Just as Burns’s popularity was international, so the theme of Scottish independence was taken up with enthusiasm by writers beyond Scotland – often in unexpected circumstances. Surveying prose, poetry and drama from England to America and Australia, Chapter 3, ‘Beyond Scotland’, looks at how this happened. Though this part of the book considers Walter Scott and his legacy, it concentrates on the work of English women writers, particularly Margaret Holford and Jane Porter. Published four years before Waverley and read with enthusiasm in Europe and America, Porter’s The Scottish Chiefs was the nineteenth century’s most influential imaginative portrayal of Scottish independence. Circulating in many versions, her fiction enthused Americans who identified with the Scots’ idealisation of liberty. In Britain there were strained attempts by writers in Scotland and beyond to position Wallace and the victor of Bannockburn as precursors of British Empire rule. Yet in Porter’s novel and other works the imaginative excitement lies in a resolute assertion of Scotland’s independence. Informed by recent scholarship, Chapter 3 treats Porter’s sometimes patronised book as a crafted, long-lived piece of popular writing, rather than simply as an international cultural phenomenon. Noting the work of American authors linked to Porter, this chapter shows how a championing of Scottish liberty from beyond Scotland culminates eventually in the Australian-American-Anglo-Scottish blockbuster, Braveheart. Deeply indebted to literary imaginings, Braveheart – globally enjoyed, widely attacked and frequently ironised – remains a popular reference point in today’s arguments about Scottish independence. As the next chapter suggests, the roots of modern Scottish nationalism have nothing to do with Hollywood. Instead, they are bound up with print-based literary imaginations. Chapter 4 starts with an overview of early twentieth-century responses to Bannockburn, and with the work of such English-born Scottish\n\n18 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 nationalists as R. B. Cunninghame Graham and Compton Mackenzie. It then reads Hugh MacDiarmid’s often linguistically difficult poetry in the context of his spiky commitment to Scottish independence. Paying tribute to the poet’s provocative and often profound imaginative work, my analysis calls attention to serious limitations in his political thinking, especially when set beside that of his 1930s literary ally, the American Scottish nationalist James H. Whyte. Thanks in part to his background, this Jewish-descended, bisexual, English-educated immigrant presented in The Modern Scot the most nuanced theorisation of Scottish nationalism. His thinking was developed in conscious opposition to the European Fascism of the 1930s. Whyte supported an important circle of nationalists and other intellectuals; he left a legacy that continued for decades after he left Scotland. Whyte’s pluralist nationalism prefigures that of the present-day SNP, while pro-independence sympathies that he nurtured were passed down through several generations of writers and academics. In the 1970s, this legacy conditioned the education of the undergraduate Alex Salmond. That St Andrews student responded enthusiastically to his tutor’s presentation of Bannockburn and the Declaration of Arbroath, and has gone on to champion in the twenty-first century a pluralist version of Scottish independence. This book’s concluding chapter, ‘Voting for a Scottish Democracy’, looks particularly at works produced in the period between the 1979 devolution referendum and the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. It opens with extended considerations of the poetry of Edwin Morgan and the fiction of Alasdair Gray. Morgan’s metamorphic imagination has a political dimension that led to support for independence both in his writing and in his posthumous bequest of a million pounds to the Scottish National Party. Gray, on the other hand, has consistently authored fictions whose protagonists battle against kinds of entrapment: viewing this as the situation from which Scots must escape, repeatedly – sometimes subtly and sometimes not – he has set out a case for ‘why Scots should rule Scotland’.34 In Gray’s oeuvre the politics of nation are bound up with those of gender; but it is Liz Lochhead’s Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off which, more than any other work, has\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nbrought that combination of concerns to a wide popular audience. Chapter 5 examines Lochhead’s play and the more recent dramas Black Watch and Dunsinane. Generating controversy, these have become part of contemporary politicians’ arguments in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum. The chapter’s penultimate part considers James Robertson’s ambitious 2010 novel, And the Land Lay Still, which surveys over half a century of Scottish politics and traces the movement of pro-independence activists from the margins of politics into government. Robertson reveals political autonomy as a continuing process; it may be that the achievement of independence remains, as James Kelman (an advocate of Scottish independence, but no nationalist) puts it, ‘not an economic decision’, but ‘a decision to do with self-respect’.35 Finally, acknowledging that the twenty-first-century literary imagination has found convincing new ways of articulating in cyberspace and on solid ground the struggle for Scottish independence, the book considers contemporary poets’ responses to Bannockburn composed for 2014, that milestone year in Scotland’s journey.\n\nChapter 1\n\nWriting Bannockburn\n\nBannockburn, 1314 The Battle of Bannockburn had a poet-in-residence. Confident his army would subdue Scottish forces led by King Robert Bruce, in early summer 1314 England’s King Edward II commissioned a poet to accompany his soldiers, then write a Latin victory celebration as soon as the battle was won.1 This poem, like the conflict, would enhance Edward’s prestige, making clear that the might of one of Europe’s great monarchies had put paid to Scotland’s tenacious but absurd claims to independence. That was the script, and, given the overwhelming military superiority of the English army, its realisation seemed inevitable. King Edward’s sending a poet with his invading army was far from ridiculous. Today’s military knows the importance of public relations, embedded battlefront correspondents and even war artists; in the late twentieth century there was talk of commissioning Scottish poet Douglas Dunn to go with troops to Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion there. In medieval Scotland, though not as familiar as a soldier, a Latin poet was hardly an unknown figure; it is probable that Bannockburn was witnessed by several writers with access to various languages. This chapter is about how that famous military encounter came to be written up in poetry as well as in prose, and how the writing of it has resounded over the centuries, though hardly in the way that England’s King Edward intended. For the better part of a millennium before the Battle of Bannockburn, throughout the territory we now call Scotland,\n\nWriting Bannockburn 21\n\npoems circulated in Latin, Gaelic, Old Welsh, Old Norse, Old French, Old English and, eventually, in Scots. Most of these works have religious or military associations. They celebrate the power of God and the Christian church, or redound to the glory of competing kingdoms within the northern part of Britain. Dating from around the sixth century, a poem in Old Welsh whose hero has stood ‘Rhag Eidyn’ (‘Before Edinburgh’) tells how ‘Mynog Gododdin traethiannor’ (‘A lord of Gododdin will be praised in song’). Old French verses recount how ‘Fergus a trait le bonne espée’ (‘Fergus drew his favourite blade’) when the rusty-armoured Arthurian knight Sir Fergus from the southwestern kingdom of Galloway rides to vanquish a dragon dwelling in a north-eastern cave at Dunnottar.2 Even before Scotland took form as a nation, poetry hymned its precursor kingdoms. When, around the end of the first millennium AD, an identifiable Scottish nation emerged, the literary imagination played a significant part in its articulation. Poets set forth the character of the kingdom at those most crucial moments in medieval public life: the coronations of monarchs. The new ‘ “Scottish” kingdom,’ argues historian Colin Kidd, found its identity in Scoto-Celtic monarchy, whose foremost expression was the royal genealogy recited as part of the coronation ritual by a Highland sennachie or bard . . . Genealogies also catalysed pride in a Scottish ‘community’ by indicating great longevity and a national origin in remote antiquity under a great founding father; at the coronation of Alexander III in 1249 his descent was traced back beyond Fergus MacErch, who brought the Scots to Britain from Ireland, to a patriarchal founder, Iber Scot.3\n\nSuch pieces of mythistoire, enhanced by the bardic literary imagination, were not unusual in medieval nations. Poetry furthered statecraft, as well as inciting troops. To Lachlan Mór, a member of the hereditary bardic MacMhuirich family, is attributed the ‘brosnachadh’ or ‘incitement’ poem said to have been chanted to fighters of Clan Donald at the 1411 Battle of Harlaw. With its distinctive rhythms (the brosnachadh is associated with bagpiping), this Gaelic poem is an abecedarian work, its formally patterned lines following the course of the Gaelic alphabet:\n\n22 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 Gu h-àirneach, gu-arranta, Gu h-athlamh, gu h-allanta, Gu beodha, gu barramhail, Gu brìoghmhor, gu buan-fheargach . . . Be at them, be animals, Be alphas, be Argus-eyed, Be belters, be brandishers, Be bonny, be batterers . . .4\n\nToday this sort of poetry may seem unfamiliar, but war poetry has not gone away. In medieval Scotland, as across the world in our own era, verse could function as anguished lament or as victory song, propagandistic bluster or high art. An abiding, resolute art-form, it became an important channel for the expression of ideas about Scottish independence. Not only England’s Edward II realised the political value of verse. Scottish poetry was shaped by the Wars of Independence that raged from 1286 until after the middle of the following century. Strife continued to flare up whenever English kings sought to dominate Scotland. This conflict was symbolic as well as bloody: King Edward I of England, nicknamed the ‘Hammer of the Scots’, had encouraged the destruction of Scotland’s national historic records in 1296. That year a great national symbol, the ‘Stone of Destiny’, associated with the crowning of Scottish monarchs, was pillaged from Scone and taken by English forces to Westminster Abbey where, despite imaginative efforts at repatriation, it would remain for seven centuries. Kings in earlier medieval England had adopted such imperial titles as ‘imperator totius Britanniae’ (emperor of the whole of Britain); their political assumptions were bolstered by twelfth-century interweavings of myth and written history such as Layamon’s Brut and the History of the Kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth which imperiously asserted English overlordship over the entire island. Englishmen claimed that once upon a time King Arthur had ruled Britain, ‘Scandinavia and Gaul’.5 Scots countered with their own versions of myth and history, yet ‘For medieval Englishmen, as for so many of their early modern descendants, an independent Scotland was quite simply a political freak which flew in the face of all that was known about the\n\nWriting Bannockburn 23\n\nglorious British past.’6 The Wars of Independence strengthened ‘a Scottish national consciousness’ expressed by historians and poets.7 If the war of myths, symbols and ideas was fierce (and, for the Scottish kingdom, potentially lethal), actual physical conflicts were even fiercer. Along with earlier struggles of the freedom-fighter William Wallace, the decisive victory won by King Robert Bruce at Bannockburn, near the Lowland settlement of Stirling, came to emblematise an unflinching determination to maintain Scottish independence. From the start, Bannockburn was the most literary of battles. Drawing on earlier verse and prose accounts, the fifteenthcentury Latin Scotichronicon describes how Edward II brought with him to the fray ‘the most famous poet in the whole kingdom of England . . . so that he might compose to the shame of the Scots some verses about the triumph he had gained over them, verses which would remain as an everlasting memorial, since these northern troublemakers (as he thought) were bound to be conquered by him’. This poet, Carmelite friar Robert Baston, was captured by the Scots: ‘Brought to King Robert . . . in return for his release he was compelled to compose . . . verses without ambiguity about what had happened.’8 Baston’s verses might have remained a dusty curiosity had it not been for a surprising twenty-first-century intervention. In 2004, the eighty-four-year-old Edwin Morgan marked his appointment as Scots Makar or National Poet by translating this poem. A committed Scottish nationalist and internationalist, Morgan, who had been a professor of English literature at Glasgow University, argued that the claims made for Baston’s poetic eminence ‘may not seem too absurd if we remember that he antedated Hoccleve and Gower, Lydgate and Langland: what rivals could he have in 1314?’9 Certainly in England it fell to the fourteenth-century minor poet Laurence Minot to complain about the ‘skottes . . . ful of gile’ who had defeated ‘king Edward’ at ‘bannok burn’, leaving Minot only to hope that ‘at the last Edward sall haue al his will’.10 Edwin Morgan presents Baston’s dark account of slaughter as ‘a “horrors of war” poem’. The twenty-first-century version catches a good deal of the original Latin’s alliteration and onomatopoeia which are scattered ‘sometimes recklessly but often most effectively’.\n\n24 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 Hic rapit, hic capit, hic terit, hic ferit. Ecce dolores! Vox tonat, es sonat, hic ruit, hic luit. Arta modo ores! What snatching and catching, what bruising and broostling, what grief! What warhorns and warnings, what winding and wirrying, no relief!11\n\nHowever stylised, Baston’s verses give every appearance of emanating from an eye-witness. Mentioning England’s wish for ‘domination’ in the ‘double realm’ of Britain, Baston does present Robert Bruce as an inspiring orator, but the captured English poet never uses words such as ‘freedom’ or ‘liberty’, which are prominent in Scottish accounts of the conflict. He shows how before the battle the English soldiers ‘spent the night drinking, bragging how they’d bring down the Scots’. Yet on the first day of fighting, concealed pits in the ground dug by Scottish ‘plebs’ (Baston uses that Latin word) trap the English cavalry; their horses are impaled on wooden stakes hidden within. By the second day of the conflict ‘pain’ is piled on pain and the amazed invading force finds itself thrown and mown down in a gory humiliation that reduces the English poet to proclaiming his own sense of traumatised numbness. Bannockburn for Baston is a military disaster. His poem invokes the concept of ‘tragedea’ – tragedy.12 The intended victory song is a jeremiad of carnage. Other poems, too, dealt with the battle. Authored and assembled by monk and historian Walter Bower, and drawing on the fourteenth-century Latin Chronica Gentis Scotorum of John of Fordun as well as on further texts now lost, the prose Scotichronicon includes extracts from a substantial poem by ‘Bernard abbot of Arbroath’, a Benedictine monk who served as chancellor to King Robert Bruce from 1308 until 1328. Rhetorically skilled and one of the king’s most trusted advisers, Bernard is likely to have been present with Bruce on the battlefield. In Bower’s Latin Scotichronicon the English king is determined not just to kill Bruce and his supporters but ‘to remove their memory from the land’. Edward seeks ‘perpetual empire’ (‘perpetue imperio’) over the Scots; like the work of his literary supporters, his military campaign aims to control not just territory but national memory. The Scotichronicon is written to\n\nWriting Bannockburn 25\n\nstrengthen Scottish resistance to English imperium; famously its concluding colophon comments, ‘Christ! He is not a Scot who is not pleased with this book!’ The work’s modern editor, D. E. R. Watt, explains that Bower ‘intends to show that the spirit which animated Scots during the Wars of Independence was characteristic of their entire history’: Scotland and independence are one.13 The Scotichronicon circulated in various medieval manuscripts and this ‘monumental’ production’s ‘impact’ was ‘tremendous’.14 A lover of poetry and of imaginative literary craft, Bower attempts to write Bannockburn into national memory, making it ‘an example of destruction’ as far as the proud English imperialist Edward is concerned, and more generally a mirror (‘speculum’) to warn kings and princes. With literary artistry that might be regarded appropriately in terms of a large-scale processional tapestry, Bower presents Edward and his invading army as dauntingly imposing, yet also (Bower has just cited Old Testament examples of hubris) potentially overweening: So the king of England advanced in pomp with his forces with an abundance of supplies for them. He arranged also for the collection of herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep and of pigs beyond number, corn and barley with portable mills for supplying the army, and wine in large jars and casks. Gold and silver, golden and silver vessels and every kind of precious furnishings he took from the king’s treasury. He himself set out with his attendants, his vehicles and wagons, carts and horsemen, slingers and archers, crossbowmen and men-atarms, with their ingenious pieces of equipment for besieging castles such as petraries and mattocks, trebuchets and mangonels, ladders and engines, pavilions and awnings, slings and cannons, and other engines of war, while trumpets and horns rang out so that every district which they reached became fearful with frightened dread. So like locusts they covered the surface of the entire land until they reached Bannockburn.15\n\nAfter arranging to have the English hordes reconnoitered, Bower’s Bruce, like Baston’s, has his men dig camouflaged pits in the ground with sharp stakes fixed in them – an effective tactic against warriors on horseback. Yet the monk Bower directs more attention to King Robert’s piety than to his tactics. Passing over Bruce’s excommunication by the Pope several years\n\n26 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 before for murdering John Comyn, Bower shapes his narrative so as to highlight the advice that Bruce at Bannockburn gives his men before battle ‘to make confession and hear masses devoutly, and that they should all take communion in the sacrament of the body of Christ, and put their trust in God alone’. At this pious point Bower intensifies his narrative by supplying his most extended quotation from the Latin poetry of ‘the said Abbot Bernard’, who writes of how, at first light, masses were celebrated on the advice of the king, who then addressed his troops. Where Baston avoided mentioning ‘liberty’, in all Scottish accounts of Bannockburn it is freedom that is the writers’ predominant theme. So, here, in Bernard’s poem Robert Bruce orates benignly to his men ‘pro libertatis honore’, for the honour of liberty: O leaders, my people, true lovers Of liberty – for which the royalty Of Scotland has suffered, and offered Its sufferings to God – we have had, Here, eight arduous years, Fighting, remember, for our right To the kingdom, for integrity, for liberty.16\n\nAbbot Bernard’s Bruce speaks in verse of a foe who has commanded the extinction of Scotland, and ‘does not believe we can offer resistance’. Yet, calling upon ‘the Lord’, Bruce emphasises that the first day of battle is the birthday of John the Baptist. As well as St Andrew, he invokes St Thomas Becket of Canterbury (dedicatee of Bernard’s abbey at Arbroath) and ‘the saints of Scotland’ – all of whom the Scottish king sees as fighting ‘today for the honour of the people, with Christ in the vanguard’. His rhetoric rouses wholehearted commitment.17 It is highly unlikely that the king on the battlefield, maintaining God was on his side, addressed his troops in elaborate Latin verse. Yet the Scotichronicon’s use of poetry attributed to Bernard of Arbroath and others brings us as close as we are likely to get to Bruce’s military incitements. Like Baston’s poem such verse marks the rhetoricisation of Bannockburn. It suggests, even before the battle is fought, that verbal artistry matters; and the Scotichronicon makes clear that, after the physical clash is\n\nWriting Bannockburn 27\n\nover, victory too is bound up with oratory and poetry. Whatever else it may be, Bannockburn is a written triumph. The Scotichronicon presents several Bannockburns: the prose account comes with three significant poems, each offering a different take. As well as Baston’s verse and that attributed to Bernard of Arbroath, there is a further substantial poem in end-rhymed Latin couplets hymning God, praising Bruce and giving an account of the battle. This work, too, is very alert to the power of crafted language: Anglica, que plenis promebas cantica venis, sume sub hiis plenis Jeremie consona trenis. England, who used to sing full-blooded songs, Smitten, your Jeremiads will be sung.18\n\nOther Latin verses from Wales and Ireland festoon Bower’s narrative. There are so many poems that the chronicler seems to have been uncertain how to fit them all in. Bower relished poetry, knowing it could heighten his chronicle’s rhetorical tone; earlier he also quotes two poems about William Wallace. But nowhere does so much verse crowd his narrative as when he deals with Bannockburn. His chronicle establishes the 1314 victory as spiritedly literary.\n\nThe Declaration of Arbroath The earliest Bannockburn writings belong to the same rhetorical climate that powers the 1320 document now most commonly known by its post-medieval title, the Declaration of Arbroath. Itself included in the Scotichronicon and addressed in the names of the Scottish nobility, this formal plea was sent to Pope John XXIII not long after he had excommunicated Bruce for recapturing the town of Berwick from the English. Like some of the Scotichronicon’s Bannockburn verse, the Declaration of Arbroath has been attributed to Bruce’s chancellor, Bernard of Arbroath. To this day it remains the most famous piece of Scottish political rhetoric, its ringing sentiments a consequence of the writing of Bannockburn.\n\n28 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 For all that the letter is dated from the north-east Scottish coastal town of Arbroath on 6 April 1320, it may have been authored earlier and elsewhere. Nonetheless, its tone, tenor and detailed phrasing would need to have been officially sanctioned. That alone signals why it is so fully consonant with the poetry attributed to Bernard in the Scotichronicon. Its most famous passage, like the speech of Bruce in Bernard’s poem, exalts the cause of liberty in the face of English imperialism, stating with regard to the victor of Bannockburn: Quem si ab inceptis desisteret, Regi Anglorum aut Anglicis nos aut Regnum nostrum volens subicere, tanquam Inimicum nostrum et sui nostrique Juris subuersorem statim expellere niteremur et alium Regem nostrum qui ad defensionem nostram sufficeret faceremus. Quia quamdiu Centum ex nobis viui remanserint, nuncquam Anglorum dominio aliquatenus volumes subiugari. Non enim propter gloriam, diuicias aut honores pugnamus sed propter libertatem solummodo qum Nemo bonus nisi simul cum vita amittit. Yet if he should give up what he has begun, and agree to make us or our kingdom subject to the king of England or the English, we should exert ourselves at once to drive him out as an enemy and a subverter of his own rights and ours, and make some other man who was well able to defend us our king; for, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom – for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.19\n\nStriking for rhetorical power and constitutional resolution, these sentences show that the letter’s signatories, the Scottish barons, were willing to depose Bruce if he did not defend Scottish liberty. Some commentators detect here ‘a nationalist theory of popular sovereignty’, but R. James Goldstein argues ‘that the king would hardly have accepted a republican form of government able to depose him at the will of the community of the realm’.20 Goldstein also indicates how unstable was baronial support. Five of the many barons whose seals were attached to the letter were charged with treason just months after it was sent. Yet it is easy to understand how, encouraged by the course of Scottish politics and literature, the Declaration of Arbroath came to be interpreted as a proto-democratic manifesto. Its suggestion\n\nWriting Bannockburn 29\n\nof an elected leader can be read as anticipating aspects of the Renaissance political thought of George Buchanan. Writing of Scottish rules of kingship, Buchanan would manifest some republican sympathies, and his work would be reprinted in America in the years leading up to the American Revolution. However, the Arbroath petition in 1320 was a campaigning document emanating from an unstable society, and its author or authors could not be sure if they would be on the winning side. One indication of this may lie in the way the Declaration’s rhetoric is boosted by phrasing from the ancient historian Sallust’s Bellum Catilinae, an account of a first-century BC rebellion against the rule of Rome.21 In his narrative of Catiline’s rebellious conspiracy against the Roman authorities, Sallust includes a declaration of the ideals for which the rebels fight: ‘None of us has been allowed, in accordance with the usage of our forefathers, to enjoy the protection of the law and retain our personal liberty.’ The example is cited of ‘the commons themselves’ (‘ipsa plebes’) who have in the past ‘taken up arms and seceded from the patricians’: this does have a certain popular revolutionary ring to it, and, in the much later context of 1320 Scotland, prompts the thought that Sallustian language of republicanism does indeed become part of this iconic literary representation of Scottish freedom. Sallust writes, At nos non imperium neque divitias petimus, quarum rerum causa bella atque certamina omnia inter mortalis sunt, sed libertatem, quam nemo bonus nisi cum anima simul amittit. But we ask neither for power nor for riches, the usual causes of war and strife among mortals, but only for freedom, which no true man gives up except with his life.22\n\nThe phrasing of 1320 is very close to this, though the medieval writer, surely aware he is addressing the Pope, has substituted ‘vita’ (life) for ‘anima’ (the soul) in suggesting what a true man is willing to forfeit for freedom. Strikingly, the Sallustian context is that of a rebellion which eventually ends in terrible failure. The medieval Scottish writer’s echo may be intended as deliberate allusion, implying he accepts that the apparently high ideals of Bruce’s cause, too, could end disastrously. If the passage is\n\n30 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 simply an opportunistic echo, it is still revealing that the author of the Arbroath Declaration, shaping his phrases in the midst of a struggle whose outcome was far from clear, was attracted to this particular Classical passage for his most ringing rhetorical effect. Seemingly picking up on Bruce’s emphasis in his Bannockburn speech as versified by Bernard of Arbroath, the Declaration, issued just six years later, draws on Sallust to continue the same resonant theme. Its emphasis is very much on ‘Regnum nostrum’ (our kingdom), on rights, and on fighting ‘propter libertatem’ (for freedom). Attuned to the rhetoric of Bannockburn, the Declaration of Arbroath resonates, also, alongside the greatest of all the medieval poems that popularised such ideals in the vernacular. Becoming the central source for many generations of historians’ accounts of the battle, The Bruce continued the writing of Bannockburn and further mythologised King Robert Bruce as an emblem of Scottish independence.\n\nBarbour’s Bruce Walter Bower knew the monumental poem The Bruce, but it was far too long to include in his Scotichronicon. He pays tribute to King Robert’s ‘cheerful and indomitable spirit’ and his ‘victories and battles’, but does not enumerate these ‘because Master John Barbour archdeacon of Aberdeen has made the case adequately in our mother tongue about his several deeds with eloquence and brilliance, and with elegance too’.23 Bower implies that Barbour’s verse account of Bruce is familiar. Rather than giving a very detailed account of the battle of Bannockburn itself, he writes simply, ‘For an account of the marvellous fashion and glorious form of the victory in that battle see the book about the said lord King Robert which the archdeacon of Aberdeen composed in the mother tongue.’24 The ‘mother tongue’ was the Scots vernacular. Yet the booklength poem by John Barbour (c. 1325–1395) is only one among many which sang Bruce’s praises in the fourteenth century; and not all were written in Scots. A Latin epitaph, composed sometime after Bruce’s burial at Dunfermline Abbey in 1329, praises\n\nWriting Bannockburn 31\n\nKing Robert’s verbal eloquence, and presents a long litany of comparators fit for a king: Begotten of Priam, like Achilles the leader of the Greeks, Praiseworthy as Ajax, many-talented like Ulysses, Beloved as the Macedonian, like Arthur a jewel among men, A leader of the peoples, a Maccabeus for intelligence.\n\nThis last comparison was often used of Bruce, a king of cleverness as well as of killing. His flowing Latin epitaph looks not just to his greatest victory, but also towards songs about it: In good order the king of Scots brings his standard forth, Fighting mightily he bears it through a thick-packed host. To boundless praise he triumphs mightily over the foe, And sent him homewards, the English king, as our new lyric goes.25\n\nThough in translation those words ‘sent him homewards’ sound disconcertingly like a quotation from the twentieth-century anthem ‘Flower of Scotland’, the medieval ‘new lyric’ mentioned here is long lost to us. So are other works glorifying Bruce, including one mentioned by the French chronicler Jean de Bel, who makes reference to an ‘hystoire faitte par le dit roy Robert’ about the Scottish king’s deeds.26 Historians may lament these vanished sources. From the standpoint of literary imagination they simply confirm a medieval cornucopia of Bannockburns, the greatest and most lasting of which is that of Barbour’s Bruce. Eventually divided into twenty books, with Bannockburn at its centre, Barbour’s huge poem seems to have been composed with the encouragement of Bruce’s grandson, King Robert II. It glorifies that king’s heroic ancestor by fusing truthful historiography (‘suthfastnes’) with the ‘romanys’ genre and exalting ‘chevalry’. Barbour wrote when eye-witnesses to Bannockburn were still alive. Yet he relished, too, heroic medieval romances about Alexander the Great and figures from the Arthurian cycle. Protesting the truthfulness of his matter, while hinting at his taste for fiction, his opening lines show him operating on a borderline between textual poetry and oral tradition. He likes verse that will appeal not just to readers but to hearers.\n\n32 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 Storys to rede ar delatibill Suppos that thai be nocht bot fabill, Than suld storys that suthfast wer And thai war said on gud maner Have doubill plesance in heryng. The first plesance is the carpyng, And the tother the suthfastnes That schawys the thing rycht as it wes, And suth thyngis that ar likand Till mannys heryng ar plesand.27\n\nenjoyable nothing but fables should; true hearing recitation shows appealing man’s\n\nBonding the textual to the acoustic, Barbour also grants himself a certain licence in presenting his heroes, Robert the Bruce and his friend Sir James Douglas – ‘Off thaim I think this buk to ma[ke]’; in so doing, this ‘makar’ (poet) alerts us to the artistic ‘making’ necessary to any piece of good writing. Where the Latin epitaph named Bruce alongside Classical heroes, Barbour, though focused on the Scottish Wars of Independence, sets the Scottish king in the milieu of medieval courtly romance. Several times the makar claims both the structural elasticity and the conventional allure of the romance genre: ‘Lordingis, quha likes [who like] for till her [hear], / The romanys now begynnys her[e].’28 Periodic invocation of romance as an undergirding genre heightens the vividness of Barbour’s historical account. When Bruce stabs Comyn, his rival for the Scottish crown, in church, the narrative voice censures the hero, but also alludes to conventions ‘in romanys’.29 Asides referring to quite elaborate details about ‘Duk[e] Betys’ and ‘Gaudifer’ in the French Roman d’Alixandre suggest Barbour has in mind a sophisticated audience, perhaps that of Robert II’s court. Elsewhere he interpolates a passage mentioning a ‘Nygramansour’ (a worker of black magic) from Guillaume le Breton’s French Latin chronicle.30 Sections such as the opening of Book Five of the poem, with its set-piece about spring blossoms on trees, and the ‘syngyng’ of ‘byrdis’ heralding a voyage made by ‘the nobill king’, are drawn from the standard lexicon of medieval courtly verse.31 Often historians treat Barbour’s Bruce as if it were a chronicle. Freighted with history, it is also a product of literary imagination. Barbour’s King Robert has his own taste for romances. While\n\nWriting Bannockburn 33\n\nbeing rowed across Loch Lomond, he entertains his companions by recounting the ‘Romanys off worthi Ferambrace’– a tale from stories of resolute ‘chevalry’ associated with the French monarch Charlemagne.32 On another occasion Barbour weaves into his Bruceian narrative ‘Suth’ (truth) about the Classical hero Tydeus as retold in the French Roman de Thèbes.33 Skilfully weaving together historiography and poetic priorities, The Bruce draws on several genres including romance, chronicle and the ancient tradition of ‘advice to princes’. Sally Mapstone has shown that this last genre underpins a great deal of the Older Scots literary corpus.34 It presents uplifting examples of conduct for monarchs. Robert Bruce, though on occasion fallible, emerges as a paragon of chivalric kingship. In an age riven with aristocratic plots and counter-plots, his robust, courtly friendship with Sir James Douglas serves as a model of military loyalty. However imaginative, Barbour’s large-scale, romanceinflected account does develop themes important to surviving official documents. Its most famous passage, often presented as a free-standing extract ‘In praise of Freedom’, picks up on that Sallustian ‘libertas’ which marked the rhetorical high-point of the Declaration of Arbroath. Such continuities confirm Roger Mason’s argument that ‘the Latin libertas and its vernacular equivalents liberty and freedom were keywords in the political vocabulary of late medieval Scots [. . .] it was the value of freedom – and freedom as a value – that the Scottish mythomoteur served above all else to extol and underwrite’.35 Yet Barbour’s universalising praise of liberty opens with a wistfully exclaimed monosyllabic ‘A!’, suggesting that freedom may be exhaustingly elusive. This imaginatively crafted aspect of the poet’s libertarian paean gives it its peculiar, lasting resonance. It also led to its being written up as a ‘permanent text’ on the blackboard of an Edinburgh school during the years of the Second World War. The teacher of the young Archie Duncan (who went on to become a friend of the modern Scotichronicon editor, D. E. R. Watt, and then to edit Barbour’s Bruce) asked his class to memorise these lines in the early 1940s.36\n\n34 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 A! Fredome is a noble thing Fredome mays man to haiff liking. Fredome all solace to man giffis, He levys at es that freely levys. A noble hart may haiff nane es Na ellys nocht that may him ples Gyff fredome failyhe, for fre liking Is yharnyt our all other thing. Na he that ay has levyt fre May nocht knaw weill the propyrte The angyr na the wrechyt dome That is couplyt to foule thyrldome, Bot gyff he had assayit it. Than all perquer he suld it wyt, And suld think fredome mar to prys Than all the gold in warld that is.37\n\nallows; contentment ease; lives without freedom desired; over condition thralldom But if perfectly; know more; prize\n\nDuring the Second World War this was not anachronistic, but inspiring. In the immediate medieval context of Barbour’s poem, terms in the passage just quoted are picked up on by Bruce addressing his forces before Bannockburn. His pre-battle oratory invokes ‘our fredome’ and ‘our land’, repeating the word ‘fredome’ several times as well as outlining the dangerous possibility of ‘threldome’.38 Yet it is the poem’s earlier paean, beginning ‘A! Fredome’ and articulated not by Bruce but by the overall narrative voice, that has caught the imagination of generations of readers. It has served both as a great articulation of the ideal of Scottish independence and, globally, an idealisation of freedom all the keener for its insistent sense of being menaced. These famous lines early in The Bruce set up not just Bannockburn, but Bruce’s whole career as indissoluble from liberty. Across the centuries Barbour’s words and ideology have continued to resonate. James Goldstein sees The Bruce as ‘arguably the most impressive work of national ideology produced in Scotland before the novels of Sir Walter Scott’.39 Today the core narrative of Barbour’s poem, that of Bannockburn, is better known than the plot of any of Scott’s novels. If there is a canon of battles, Barbour more than anyone else makes the Scots’ victory at Bannockburn, perceived as a great national assertion of freedom, utterly canonical. He does for this 1314 victory\n\nWriting Bannockburn 35\n\nwhat Shakespeare would do later for the English triumph at Agincourt. Throughout hundreds of lines of verse Barbour sets out the battle in great detail. He shows at early-morning mass men ‘That thocht to dey [die] in that melle / Or than to mak thar contre fre’; he explains troop movements and Bruce’s strategic cleverness.40 Readers see the Scottish king attacked at full tilt by English knight Henry de Bohun. Bruce avoids de Bohun’s blow. Standing upright in his stirrups, he strikes so vigorously with his ‘ax [. . .] hard and gud’ that he cleaves through de Bohun’s helmet and skull: a gift to later illustrators.41 Military historians have pored over just what happened where and when; Barbour portrays England’s ‘drownyt hors and men’ – and the rabble of Scots youths who ‘slew thaim doun foroutyn [without] mercy’. Throughout, he shows Bruce to be an inspirational leader able to converse with ‘Bath mar and les commonaly’ – both highborn and low together. Without downplaying the carnage, Barbour humanises Bruce even as he renders him heroic. This process continues throughout the poem. So, for instance, Bruce holds up the progress of his entire army so that a laundrywoman can give birth. In a poem where freedom seems to belong exclusively to men, and to noblemen at that, this short, female-accented passage is all the more striking. It speaks volumes for Bruce as a king that he is ready to attend to the needs of the humblest of his followers, simply because he ‘has hard [heard] a woman cry’. After relating how the monarch waits with his army until this laundrywoman’s child is born, Barbour emphasises the episode’s significance. This wes a full gret curtasy That swilk a king and sa mychty Gert his men dwell on this maner Bot for a pouer lauender.42\n\ngreat courtesy such; so mighty made poor laundrywoman\n\nThis passage has the effect of a folktale, or an incident from a romance. If Bruce’s praise of valour in Book Six or his urging on his troops in the cause of freedom in Book Twelve confirms his kingly virtue, then so does this story about the laundress from Book Sixteen. Escapologist, fighter, friend and\n\n36 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 considerate leader, Bruce becomes, too, an incarnation of Scotland’s unquenchable desire for liberty. Barbour’s Bruce is heroic not least in his friendship with Sir James Douglas, termed ‘the Black Douglas’ for his swarthy complexion. Towards the end of the poem, Barbour tells how after Bruce’s death it is Douglas who carries the king’s heart inside a silver container onto the battlefield on a crusade. Much earlier, when the two friends are reunited after each has feared the other has been killed, there is great mutual weeping. The makar goes out of his way to explain that this is a particular kind of manly crying – not the sort of weeping sometimes indulged in by ‘wemen, that can wet / Thair chekys quhenever thaim list with teris [whenever they like with tears]’.43 Tender, but not effeminate, then, Barbour’s valorous Bruce is never the ‘semivir’ (halfman) reproached by the famous William Wallace elsewhere in the Scotichronicon.44 Yet, as Goldstein and others have emphasised, Barbour’s victor of Bannockburn is very much an artistically crafted figure. The poet simply avoids discussing why the younger Bruce had supported England’s King Edward I, the notorious ‘Hammer of the Scots’. In completely omitting Wallace, The Bruce may have been designed to counter the allure of that hero. If so, it failed. Already acclaimed, Wallace’s story would come to be so bound up with that of Bruce that the nature of Bruceian symbolism and even the meaning of Bannockburn would be recast.\n\nBlind Hary’s Wallace Something of the way the victor of Bannockburn was redefined can be sensed in an influential passage (perhaps ‘a traditional tale’) inserted into Walter Bower’s Scotichronicon.45 Bower presents an encounter between Bruce and Wallace, the earliest account of whom (in the mid-fourteenth-century Gesta Annalia II) links Wallace with ‘all who were in bitterness of spirit and weighed down [. . .] under the unbearable domination of English despotism’.46 Bower’s Bruce and Wallace meet just after Wallace’s defeat at the 1298 battle of Falkirk. This meeting is probably a work of literary imagination, but does encapsulate\n\nWriting Bannockburn 37\n\ndramatically struggles within the Scottish leadership. In the longer term, it helped establish a topos attuned to that facet of the Declaration of Arbroath which later interpreters, rightly or wrongly, saw as gesturing towards aspects of popular sovereignty. The Bruce in Bower’s post-Falkirk encounter is not the fighter for Scottish independence at Bannockburn but a Scot still loyal to England’s king. This earlier, pro-English Bruce is glossed over by Barbour. In Bower’s text, however, after Falkirk, Bruce calls across a steep glen to Wallace, ‘asking him who it was that drove him to such arrogance as to seek to fight in opposition to the exalted power of the king of England and of the more powerful section of Scotland’. Wallace’s reply, eloquent alike in Latin and English, is a reproach to a Bruce seen as having betrayed the cause of Scottish liberty: ‘Robert, Robert, it is your inactivity and womanish cowardice that spur me to set authority free in your native land. But it is an effeminate man even now, ready as he is to advance from bed to battle, from the shadow into the sunlight, with a pampered body accustomed to a soft life feebly taking up the weight of battle for the liberation of his own country, the burden of the breastplate – it is he who has made me so presumptuous perhaps even foolish, and has compelled me to attempt or seize these tasks.’47\n\nWith its opening exasperated repetition (in Latin ‘O Roberte, Roberte’), this speech portrays a king lacking in virility and needing to be incited by his subject Wallace to lead the struggle for Scotland’s freedom. The encounter was soon amplified by later writers, including the author of the mid-fifteenth-century Liber Pluscardensis.48 Bower’s equation of manliness with a strong sense of national liberty will characterise much future nationalist discourse, running, sometimes problematically, as far as nineteenth-century fiction and even Braveheart; but it is surprising to see Bruce in this early fifteenth-century narrative being taunted as a ‘semivir’ lacking masculine commitment. Here Wallace, the acclaimed head of a popular movement, emerges as the power behind the throne. He is the ‘dux Scotorum’ (leader – or sometimes ‘guardian’ – of the Scots), as he is first introduced in the Scotichronicon.49 Without Wallace’s\n\n38 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 efforts, this narrative implies, the victory at Bannockburn would have been impossible. As in influential later literary reimaginings, Wallace converts Bruce to the cause of Scottish independence. He does not dispute Bruce’s right to kingship, but highlights the way Bruce has abused that. Dead almost a decade before Bannockburn, Wallace had been praised in popular poems and songs (‘carmina’ Bower calls them) from at least the early fourteenth century.50 The minor poet Andrew of Wyntoun (c. 1355–1422) wrote about Wallace in his late-fourteenth-century Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland: Off his guid deidis and his manheid Gret gestis and sangis ar maid; Bot yit sa mony, I trow nocht, As he in his dais wrocht.\n\nOf his good deeds Great gestes and songs do not believe\n\nWyntoun goes on to speculate that Quha his worschip all wald write, He suld a mekle buke endite; And all his deidis to write in heire Thareto I want wit and laysere.51\n\nWho long book write leisure\n\nAlmost as if spurred by these words, the sophisticated poet nicknamed ‘Blind Hary’ composed a Wallace poem around the 1470s, splicing older, popular materials together into one extended heroic narrative to counterbalance Barbour’s Bruce.52 Tellingly, the sole manuscript copy of Hary’s poem (‘Advocates MS 19.2.2’) survives inscribed in single columns on 124 vellum leaves transcribed by John Ramsay in 1488 and now in the National Library of Scotland. Formerly it was bound together with Ramsay’s 1489 manuscript transcription of Barbour’s Bruce. The bonding of these poems and their heroes was emblematic. Not only Bruce but also Wallace came to be seen as foundational to the writing of Bannockburn. Anne McKim, its twenty-first-century editor, points out that Hary’s Wallace is designed in part ‘to incite hatred of the English in his readers’.53 A fanatical, no-holds-barred defence of independence, The Wallace, like the work of Bower, Barbour and other Scottish writers of the period, deals ‘not just with the lives of rulers and their narrow circle of supporters but the\n\nWriting Bannockburn 39\n\ncollective life of the Scottish nation’.54 Authored after many decades of warfare, Hary’s poem was made to quicken the cause of Scottish freedom in a period when some, including Scotland’s King James III, may have been inclined, out of pragmatism and relative weakness, to accept English overlordship. Probably the poem, whose sole surviving manuscript witness dates from just after King James IV’s accession to the throne, succeeded in its aim: James IV went on to resist the determination of England’s Henry VIII to crush Scotland. Yet, disastrously for Scottish independence, James’s resistance was put to the test at the 1513 battle of Flodden where the Scottish monarch and many of his nobility perished. In such circumstances of loss, Hary’s bloodily patriotic, metrically resourceful work grew increasingly popular. Sophisticatedly, its author claims to follow a Latin biography of his hero by the surely fictitious John Blair. Clearly Hary knows not only Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde and Canterbury Tales but also Barbour’s Bruce. He alludes, too, to medieval authorities including the philosopher Boethius and the heroic French romances of Charlemagne, Arthur and Alexander. The Scottish poet has absorbed chronicles by Wyntoun, Bower and Froissart. Yet from its opening lines his Wallace trumpets its unflinching political slant: ‘Our ald Ennemys cummyn of Saxonys blud, / That neuyr yeit to Scotland wald do gud.’55 The poem’s interminable preoccupation with ‘blud’ involves, James Goldstein argues, ‘a discourse of hatred of the Other’.56 Nicola Royan admits that ‘It is possible to read the Wallace as a racist text, for it dehumanizes the English as “Sotheron” ’; yet the poem ‘offers acute perspectives on Scottish nationhood, sharper than those of the more diffuse historiographers’.57 Arguably the medieval epic character of the poem may make the modern terminology of racism somewhat anachronistic, but Hary’s Wallace certainly mixes love of liberty with violent anti-Englishness. His Wallace seems ‘a man divinely ordained to free Scotland from English oppression’.58 Indeed, in a dream vision he is hailed by St Andrew, Scotland’s patron saint, who gives the hero a special sword: an emblematic weapon in the iconography of Wallace until Braveheart and beyond. The dreaming Wallace then beholds a female visitant who tells him\n\n40 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 ‘his destiny is to free Scotland from English oppression and to martyr himself for the nation’. Writing in 2011, Kylie Murray argues that this dream vision ‘replaces the kingly genealogy so central to Scotland’s independence, with a spiritual one, reflecting once more Wallace’s role, which is powerful yet distinct from kingship’.59 Revealing his learning, Hary refers to Scottish royal genealogical myths and to ‘Scwne’ (Scone), where ‘kingis was cround viii hundyr yer and mar’.60 Yet his warring Wallace has a cartoon-hero quality, seeming as much the avenging superhero of a dark graphic novel as a figure of courtly romance. Not royal, but (despite his noble title) a man of the people, Wallace soon decides that there is less point in killing ordinary members – ‘commounis’ – of the occupying force than in going after ‘thair Chiftanis’.61 Linked to the Ayrshire of ‘Cunyngayme and Kille [Kyle]’, Wallace, scorned by his enemies as a mere ‘king off Kyll’, extends his campaigning to much of Scotland and northern England; at one point he even threatens London.62 While sometimes accurate, Hary’s poem often reimagines history. It postpones, for instance, the battle of Falkirk by five years, and links Wallace to a battle at Loudon Hill in Ayrshire that was fought instead by Bruce. Hary’s Wallace traverses Scotland, inflicting losses on English occupying forces. Historians might be tempted to credit these successes to other, now forgotten local resistance fighters, but in the poem they enhance Wallace’s emblematic ruthlessness. So, in the seventh book of what post-medieval editors divide into a twelve-book poem, readers follow Wallace and his men as they slay English occupying forces and their collaborators. In the north of Scotland at ‘Dwnottar’ (Dunnottar) Wallace’s fighters spill huge amounts of ‘Sotheroun blud’.\n\nWallace in fyr gert set all haistely, [set all on fire] Bryn twp the kyrk, and all that was tharin. Burned up; therein Atour the roch the laiff ran with gret dyn. Around the rock the rest Sum hang on craggis rycht dulfully to de, crags; miserably Sum lap, sum fell, sum floteryt in the se. leapt; floundered Na Sotheroun on lyff was lewyt in that [was allowed to live]; hauld, refuge\n\nWriting Bannockburn 41 And thaim with in thai brynt in powdir cauld.63\n\nashes\n\nHary’s vehemently Anglocidal hero may be merciless, but he saves Scotland when even Bruce sides with the English ‘contrar his natiff men’.64 In the poem’s eighth book Wallace is invited to take the crown; later we are told that he did so, but only for one token day. This fundamentally unkingly aspect of Wallace is a powerful source of his popular appeal. As the poet Alan Riach puts it, ‘He was common. He was / of the people.’65 Hary’s Wallace may have obtained the power to ‘gowern all Scotland’, but he acts only as guardian until her rightful king returns.66 Wallace’s campaigning both upholds and serves as a stinging reproach to the Scottish monarchy. Towards the end of Hary’s eighth book, Wallace even parleys with the English queen, who seems attracted towards him. A skilled leader, he is capable of sophistication and, invoking ‘Sanct Androw’, even, at times, of piety.67 From one perspective this Wallace is every inch heroic. With his ‘Cler aspre Eyn [superlative eyes] lik dyamondis brycht’ he might have stepped straight from the pages of romance.68 Yet Hary’s Wallace is no mere poetic ornament. He is an ideological force. As Hary daringly surpasses the barer outline in the Scotichronicon, Wallace’s absolute resolution leads him to upbraid his king in steadfast terms. Hary’s Wallace meets Bruce ‘wpon Caroun syd’ – on the banks of the River Carron – after the pair have fought at Falkirk. In one of two encounters, which the great scholar Sir William Craigie called ‘perhaps the most dramatic scenes in the whole of old Scots literature’, Wallace straightforwardly accuses Bruce of ‘tresson’: In cursyt tym thow was for Scotland born. Schamys thow nocht that thow neuir yeit Are you not ashamed did gud, renegade devourer of Thow renygat deuorar off thi blud?69\n\nBruce tries to laugh off Wallace’s ‘ernystfulnas’ (earnestness). Soon, though, after battling on behalf of King Edward against the Scots, Bruce omits to wash his bloody hands before eating, and is taunted by a ‘Sotheroun’ lord: ‘Behald, yon Scot ettis\n\n42 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 [eats] his awn blud.’ At this point Wallace’s ‘wordis’ come back to Bruce with a vengeance, leading him to recommit himself to the Scottish cause and fight no more ‘contrar Scots’.70 Scotland remains ‘in hard perplexite’. Yet readers and hearers of the poem can be confident Wallace has brought back to Scotland’s defence the man whom he later calls ‘worthi Bruce’. 71 Independence has been preserved. Showing that Wallace remains true both to Bruce and to Scotland right to the end, Hary omits Wallace’s torture at his London trial and execution; the poet invokes ‘Master Barbour’ in his final book, and his martyr-like hero makes possible future Scottish victory.72 For all that the battle is never once mentioned, Blind Hary’s implied future is manifestly Bannockburn. Wallace’s sacrifice makes that victory possible. Cartoonily ruthless, Blind Hary’s Wallace also has an idealistic side. Though not a democratic work in any modern sense, its clear sympathy with Wallace produces a poem markedly inclined towards the popular, rather than simply the kingly, cause of freedom. This popular aspect of Hary’s text helped make it much loved in a Scotland whose later monarchs seemed to have priorities very different from Scottish independence. The Wallace came to embody a spirit of popular resistance: a longing for the possibility of Bannockburn.\n\nRenaissance legacies of Bruce and Wallace For all its vitriolic Anglophobia and bloodiness, Blind Hary’s Wallace is still capable of inspiring idealism. The American critic Elizabeth Walsh argued in 1984 that ‘Wallace’s struggle for freedom symbolizes not only Scotland’s desire for political liberation, but every man’s struggle to free himself from the tyranny of others.’73 Throughout the very different times of the early sixteenth century, even those who thought in the wake of Flodden that Scotland might be wise to accept union with England could admire aspects of Hary’s work. In 1521 the logician John Mair published his punningly titled Historia majoris Britanniae tam Angliae quam Scotiae: the title can mean ‘History of Greater Britain, England and Scotland’ or ‘Mair’s\n\nWriting Bannockburn 43\n\nHistory of Britain, England and Scotland’. Mair is the dry patron saint of the ideology of modern Britishness. His work seems angled to discourage Scottish independence, but its audience was small compared with that of Hary’s poem, and today Mair is seldom remembered. Even he clearly regarded Hary as ‘peritus’ (skilled) in his use of folk materials. It was simply that this Glasgow professor, ‘an unashamed advocate of union with England’, did not believe them all.74 The poet and his hero were unignorable, however. Mair and fellow Scottish historian Hector Boece apparently made use of aspects of Hary’s Wallace in their accounts of that heroic leader. Mair likens Wallace to Hannibal or Ulysses, while John Bellenden, reworking Boece’s work in 1536, styles Wallace a ‘campion’ (champion) of ‘inuincible curage’.75 By Bellenden’s time, printing had come to Scotland. Though only fragments survive in Glasgow and Cambridge, we know that Hary’s Wallace was one of the first books printed with the types of Walter Chepman and Andrew Myllar in Edinburgh around 1509: a sure sign of the poem’s marketability. The pioneering printers seem to have used a manuscript now lost: their version divides Hary’s poem into eleven books, rather than the twelve in Ramsay’s 1488 transcription. Chepman and Myllar’s printing of the Wallace was part of a project of cultural nationalism. They also brought into print Scots poetry by Robert Henryson and by William Dunbar who lamented how death ‘has Blind Hary and Sandy Traill / Slane with his schour of mortall haill’.76 If Flodden curtailed aspects of the literary Renaissance in Scotland, preventing for many years the publication of Gavin Douglas’s great pioneering translation of Virgil’s Aeneid (completed in 1513), nonetheless the 1549 Complaynt of Scotland includes shepherds who recount stories about Wallace and Bruce.77 Moreover, the Renaissance poet and historian George Buchanan continued to sing the praises of those heroes and the ideals of Scottish independence even as a ‘British unionist ideology’ was gathering pace, inviting Scots to accept ‘dependent status within a redefined British imperial framework’.78 Republished for centuries in Latin and in English translation throughout Scotland, England and beyond, Buchanan’s history\n\n44 Bannockburns: Scottish Independence, 1314–2014 of Scotland would be a standard school text for generations of Enlightenment Scots. From its sixteenth-century publication onwards it helped cement the image of Wallace not so much as an aristocrat but, with all his daring military ‘Pranks’, as a man of the people: a hero from ‘an ancient and noble family, but one that have lived poorly and meanly, as having little or no Estate’.79 Buchanan’s interest in Wallace was of a piece with his concern with political theory. In De Iure Regni apud Scotos Dialogus (A Dialogue on the Law of Kingship among the Scots) as in his biblical drama Baptistes (The Baptist), Buchanan was fascinated by resistance to tyranny. Roger Mason indicates how Boece in his 1527 Scotorum Historia highlighted the Scots’ ‘restraint and overthrow of errant monarchs’; Buchanan"
