        "text": "According to Declan Kiberd, \"postcolonial writing does not begin only when the occupier withdraws: rather it is initiated at that very moment when a native writer formulates a text committed to cultural resistance.\" The Irish in Latin America-a continent emerging from indigenous cultures, colonisation, and migrations-may be regarded as colonised in Ireland and as colonisers in their new home. They are a counterexample to the standard pattern of identities in the major English-speaking destinations of the Irish Diaspora. Using literary sources, the press, correspondence, music, sports, and other cultural representations, in this thesis I search the attitudes and shared values signifying identities among the immigrants and their families. Their fragmentary and wide-ranging cultures provide a rich context to study the protean process of adaptation to, or rejection of, the new countries. Evolving from oppressed to oppressors, the Irish in Latin America swiftly became ingleses. Subsequently, in order to join the local middle classes they became vaqueros, llaneros, huasos, and gauchos so they could show signs of their effective integration to the native culture, as seen by the Latin American elites. Eventually, some Irish groups separated from the English mainstream culture and shaped their own community negotiating among Irishness, Englishness, and local identities in Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, and other places in the region. These identities were not only unmoored in the emigrants' minds but also manoeuvred by the political needs of community and religious leaders. After reviewing the major steps and patterns of Irish migration to Latin America, the thesis analyses texts from selected works, offers a version of how the settlers became Latin Americans or not, and elucidates the processes by which a new Irish-Latin Ameri-can hybrid was created.\n\nFirst published in \"Irish Migration Studies in Latin America\" (www.irlandeses.org) in April 2003 and updated until October 2007. New book-length studies have been added in June 2019. This bibliography includes books, book chapters, articles, documentaries and websites grouped in two parts. Part I: Latin America; Central America; Caribbean; Argentina. Part II: Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru; Brazil; Colombia, Venezuela; Mexico; Paraguay, Uruguay; Portugal, Spain; San Patricio Batallion; Eliza Lynch (1835-1886); William Brown (1777-1857). Some entries repeat in more than one category. I am thankful to the late Brian McGinn for his practical help and generous encouragement with this bibliography. Many of the following bibliographical entries were first gathered by Brian for his website The Irish in South America: An Annotated Bibliography. I would also like to express my gratitude to the following people for their support and assistance in developing this bibliography: David Barnwell, Frank Cullen, Jorge Fox, Mike Geraghty, Jeremy Howat, Oliver Marshall, Bruce Bradley S.J., Peter Feeney, and Edward Walsh."
