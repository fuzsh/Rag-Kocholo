He attended The High School of Glasgow in 1939-1951 – some 100 years after Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman – and had degrees in Economics (1955), Divinity (1999) and Scottish Church History (PhD, 2003). He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and a Member of the Glasgow High School Club, the Scottish Church History Society, the Scottish Place-Name Society, the Liberal International (British Group) and the Liberal Democrat History Group, and was also a contributor to the Journal of Liberal History.\n\nAfter National Service, he worked in general publishing, in the iron and steel industry and in newspaper publishing, mainly in personnel and training roles. He joined the old Scottish Liberal Party (SLP) in 1951, serving for some years on its National Executive, convening its Housing Policy and Structure of Government Committees and making a major contribution to the development of SLP policy for an integrated income tax/social security system. He also held a range of offices in the former Glasgow Pollok, West Aberdeenshire and North Angus & Mearns (Kincardineshire) Constituency Liberal Associations and was the unsuccessful Liberal/Alliance candidate for Kincardine and Deeside at the 1983 General Election. In 1954-1955, he was a Vice-President of the old Scottish Union of Students and in 1957-1964, he was Liberal Whip and then Leader in the Glasgow Parliamentary Debating Association. He was latterly a member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.\n\nAs a school pupil and then as a student, he had leadership roles in the Scottish Schoolboys Club (SSC) and the Student Christian Movement (SCM). In later years, as an ordained Elder of The Church of Scotland, he was Session Clerk of Banchory-Ternan West Parish Church for eleven years, a Commissioner at a number of General Assemblies and a member of a number of General Assembly Boards and associated Committees. He was also Convener of the Business Committee of the Presbytery of Kincardine and Deeside, and Convener of Christian Aid Banchory.\n\nSandy and his wife, Sheila, lived in North-East Scotland after their marriage in 1965 and specifically in Banchory (Banchory-Ternan), Kincardineshire, from 1975. They have two children and four grandchildren, who live in Edinburgh and Newcastle.\n\nSandy Waugh died at home in Banchory in July 2017.\n\nForeword\n\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman is a much neglected figure in British political history. The names of Asquith and Lloyd George are more readily associated with the great reforming Liberal governments of the early twentieth century. Yet it can be forcefully argued that neither of them might have come to prominence were it not for the remarkable personality of CB, as he was known, and his success first in re-uniting the Liberals and then leading them to the stunning election victory in 1906. His holding of the office of Prime Minister lasted just over two years until his untimely death, during which much legislation which could have been counted to his credit was vetoed by the House of Lords.\n\nDr. Waugh spells out a series of justified tributes: He saved the ship of Liberalism from total shipwreck at a time when most of the crew and many of the pilots had lost all hope, all heart and all faith: No premier has ever been more deservedly or more widely popular than he was; and from Asquith himself: of all the men with whom I have been associated in public life, I put him as high as any in both moral and intellectual courage. The author also takes us through more of his early life, and he is painstaking in sometimes slightly irrelevant (most concerning their mutual alma mater, Glasgow High School) but nevertheless fascinating detail. For example he tells us that CB as a teenager heard Strauss play in Vienna and that he was distantly related to Fletcher of Saltoun (and correctly reminds us that Fletcher was in favour of the Union and only objected to the abolition of the Scottish Parliament).\n\nHe attributes the creation of the Scottish Grand Committee to CB, and in arguments relevant to today reminds us that he advocated a reformed House of Lords as a federal chamber after home-rule all round. CB pointed out: As Scottish Home Rule involves English Home Rule, Scottish Home Rule must wait until the sluggish mind of John Bull [the English] is educated up to that point’. The author also pays due attention to his remarkable 40-year tenure as the Member for Stirling Burghs; all letters from constituents had to be forwarded to him when abroad and every one received a personal reply.\n\nHis remarkable post Boer war association with Smuts is well recounted along with perhaps his most famous quote: When is a war not a war? When it is conducted by methods of barbarism in South Africa. Truly this is an intensively scholarly work which will do much to elevate Campbell-Bannerman’s reputation.\n\nSadly, the author passed away last year whilst the book was still at the proof stage. Sandy was a stalwart of the old Scottish Liberal Party whom I know from the 1960s. His commitment to the Liberal Democrats remained undimmed and we shall miss him greatly.\n\nDAVID STEEL\n\nTables\n\nChapter 1\n\nTable 1 The 1837 General Election in Glasgow\n\nTable 2 The 1841 General Election in Glasgow\n\nTable 3 The Major Scottish Presbyterian Churches and Associated Statistics\n\nTable 4 The Fasque-Stracathro Connection (Ramsay/Gladstone and Cruickshank/Campbell)\n\nChapter 2\n\nTable 5 The 1865 General Election in Glasgow\n\nChapter 3\n\nTable 6 Stirling Burghs – 30 April 1868 By-Election\n\nTable 7 Stirling Burghs – 20 November 1868 General Election\n\nTable 8 Stirling Burghs – 1871 Census\n\nChapter 4\n\nTable 9 The 1868 General Election\n\nTable 10 Scottish Universities – 1868 General Election\n\nTable 11 The 1874 General Election\n\nChapter 5\n\nTable 12 The 1880 General Election\n\nTable 13 The 1885 General Election\n\nTable 14 The Fifth Liberal Cabinet 1886\n\nChapter 6\n\nTable 15 – Owners of Belmont Castle 1800-1884\n\nChapter 7\n\nTable 16 – The 1886 General Election\n\nTable 17 – The 1892 General Election\n\nTable 18 – The Sixth Liberal Cabinet 1892-1894\n\nChapter 8\n\nTable 19 – The Seventh Liberal Cabinet 1894-1895\n\nTable 20 – The 1895 General Election\n\nChapter 9\n\nTable 21 – The 1900 General Election\n\nChapter 10\n\nTable 22 – The Eighth Liberal Cabinet 1905-1908\n\nChapter 11\n\nTable 23 – The 1906 General Election\n\nTable 24 – Election Results in Places where Sir Henry spoke in January 1906\n\nTable 25 – The Fifty Labour Candidatures in 1906\n\nChapter 14\n\nTable 26 – Cabinet Changes in April 1908\n\nAppendix 2\n\nTable 27 – Scotland – General Elections 1832 to 1918\n\nAppendix 4\n\nTable 28 – Other Members of the 1905-1908 Liberal Administration\n\nAppendix 6\n\nTable 29 – Glasgow High School Parliamentarians\n\nIntroduction\n\nOutline Genealogy – 1 – The McOran-Campbells\n\nOutline Genealogy – 2 – The Bannermans and The Hunton Line\n\nPolitical Timeline 1836-1908\n\n* Without overall majority in House of Commons\n\nThe Rt.

(In Scotland, the word DUX [Dux Litterarum] is used to refer to the top pupil in a school, form, class or subject in terms of academic achievement) In 1948 I was myself then (aged 13) in the Third Form of the School.\n\nSpecially invited contributors to the June 1948 Magazine included Jan Christiaan Smuts (then Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa), Viscount Samuel (a former Cabinet Minister and Liberal Leader), Viscount Simon (a former Cabinet Minister and Liberal National Leader), Dr. Andrew Browning (Professor of History, Glasgow University), Dr. William A. Cunningham (Librarian, Glasgow University), Professor Henry Contamine (University of Caen), Gilbert Murray (formerly Professor of Greek in Glasgow and Oxford Universities), George Macaulay Trevelyan (Master of Trinity College, Cambridge) and Lady Ponsonby of Shulbrede, whose late husband had been Principal Private Secretary for most of Sir Henry’s Premiership.\n\nThe Magazine article which most impressed me was perhaps that by Field Marshall Smuts, who wrote in his covering letter, ‘It is of course possible that the little article may attract wider attention and other papers may wish to quote from it or to reproduce it. It is my wish that no objection be raised to this. Let it all be in honour of Campbell-Bannerman and his remembrance in these confused days’. The Field Marshall’s article concluded with the words, ‘Don’t forget Campbell-Bannerman’.\n\nCoincidentally, Sir Henry’s motto, as a Campbell, as granted and recorded by Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh in 1872, was Ne obliviscaris [Do not forget]. The motto, which was also the motto of his father, Sir James Campbell of Stracathro [Grant and Record of 1859], is also the motto of the Scottish Dukes of Argyll, Chiefs of Clan Campbell. Such duplication would probably not be allowed nowadays. The motto was also used by Lady Frances Balfour as the title of her Ne Obliviscaris, Dinna Forget [1929-1930]. Lady Frances was a daughter of the 8th [Scottish] and 1st (UK) Duke of Argyll and a sister-in-law of both the Campbell-Bannermans’ friend Princess Louise [a daughter of Queen Victoria] and Arthur Balfour, Conservative Prime Minister in 1902-1905.\n\nAs a Campbell, Sir Henry’s coat of arms had a boar’s head crest. As a Bannerman, his crest was ‘a demi-man in armour proper’, with the motto Patri fidelis [Faithful to fatherland].\n\nSome years later, I was equally impressed by statements made by John Wilson in Herbert Van Thal (Editor), The Prime Ministers, Volume Two (1975), p.194 that Sir Henry ‘was one of the nicest and most sensible men ever to be leader of a political party or prime minister’ and by Colin Clifford in his The Asquiths (2002), p.134 that Sir Henry ‘was probably the most decent man ever to hold the office of Prime Minister’.\n\nOn the other hand, I am very much aware of what John Wilson wrote in his CB – A Life of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1973), p.15, that Sir Henry ‘today is almost forgotten. Most people have never heard of him, and those who have tend to class him as a dim and secondary figure’. Accordingly, my determination to help in making him much better known and much better appreciated.\n\nIt should also be appreciated that this publication has its origins in my A Scottish Liberal Perspective 1836-2008 – A Centenary Commemoration for Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman 1836-1908 which was published privately in December 2008 with a reprint in January 2009, Indeed, as I then stated, it was my hope that appropriate parts of the Perspective would be of assistance to a qualified Scottish historian in producing a long overdue biography of Sir Henry which is not too anglocentric, too localised or too error-strewn. I now have the temerity to present myself as that biographer.\n\nAs for evidence of anglocentricity, I need only refer to the statement by John Wilson (1973), p.15 that Sir Henry was \"an unusual person to emerge as the leader of a great political party in England\"! (England The United Kingdom)\n\nSir Henry’s constituency of Stirling Burghs included not only the Royal Burgh of Stirling (with some 43 % of the population) but also the Royal Burghs of Dunfermline (45 %), Inverkeithing (5 %), South Queensferry (5 %) and Culross (2 %). Accordingly, it should be appreciated that the early The Model Member – Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1914), by John Beveridge Mackie of the Dunfermline Journal, was somewhat localised in that it was written very much from a Dunfermline perspective,\n\nI also aim to correct some errors in previous biographies. For example, John A. Spender’s statement, in his Life of the Rt. Hon. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, GCB (1923), Volume 1, p.22, that Sir Henry and Lady Campbell-Bannerman married within a few months of their first meeting (rather six years later), was repeated by two later biographers – John Wilson, as above, in 1973, p.38, and Roy Hattersley in his Campbell-Bannerman (2006), p.10 – and by A.J.A. Morris in the entry (2004) for Sir Henry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB). (The error arose in that Spender dated the marriage of Sir Henry’s brother, James Alexander Campbell, at which the future Lady Campbell-Bannerman was bridesmaid, to 1860 rather than to the correct date of 1854.)\n\nMore positively. I believe that an individual’s way of life is conditioned by a number of inter-related factors such as family identity, education, religious affiliation and other formative experiences, including, for Sir Henry, much overseas travel and the history and interests of the five Royal Burghs he represented in the House of Commons. Accordingly, particularly in the early chapters, I have gone much further than previous biographers in referring to Sir Henry’s ancestry, his school (and its history and traditions of public service), the many places with which he and/or his family were connected, the family business, the political activities of his father and brother, what he himself wrote (mainly before he became an MP) and did in a non-political context, the family’s other interests, achievements and relationships and Scottish Church matters. I have also been able to refer to commemorative events held in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and other events as recently as May 2013.\n\nFurther, it is not so much that there have been new discoveries about Sir Henry but that there is little or no evidence that earlier biographers referred to the interesting political history of Stirling Burghs before the mid-19th century or, other than John B. Mackie for Dunfermline, to such sources as the archival material now held by Stirling Council Archives and the Dunfermline Carnegie Library or to such held by The High School of Glasgow (a selection of which was published in a Scrapbook in 1995) or to the items held by the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum or to appropriate entries in the invaluable Statistical Accounts of Scotland.\n\nMoreover, since the last major biography of Sir Henry (by John Wilson in 1973), much material has become readily accessible online, including, for example, the Glasgow Digital Library, Hansard 1803-2005, UK Parliament and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB). Also, by way of family history, reminiscences and the like, I have been able to have research exchanges with a number of Sir Henry’s present-day relatives and to refer to a dissertation about him written by another such relative in 2009.\n\nThe availability of digital or other modern reprints of some, relatively inaccessible, books, some originally published over a hundred years ago (and not available on inter-library loan) – as indicated in the Bibliography – has also been very helpful.\n\nNOTES\n\nWith the Campbell-Bannerman Papers originally deposited in what was the Library Department of the British Museum but, since 1973, located in the British Library, references to such are indicated as (CB/BL). References to Parliamentary business (speeches, votes, etc.) are taken from Hansard for the appropriate date. Extracts from Election Addresses for 1886 (February) and from 1892 to 1900 and the full text of such for 1906 are taken from originals held in the Dunfermline Carnegie Library. Refer to the Bibliography for sources for General Political Data (Election Results and Biographical Notes). Otherwise, full citations for all books mentioned in this introductory context and/or specifically quoted hereinafter are included in the Bibliography.\n\nThe McOran Campbells and Bannermans\n\nHenry Campbell to Henry Campbell-Bannerman to Sir Henry-Campbell-Bannerman\n\nThe future Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman’s paternal ancestors had adopted the surname McOran in the mid-17th century while living in Perthshire but resumed the surname Campbell on moving to Glasgow in 1804 – hence references to the McOran Campbells as a sept (branch) of Clan Campbell. Thus he was known as Henry Campbell from his birth in 1836 until 1872 when he adopted, by royal licence, the surname Campbell-Bannerman as a condition of an 1871 legacy – the life rent of the Hunton Court estate in Kent – from a maternal uncle, Henry Bannerman. He was thereafter commonly and affectionately known as CB. He was invested as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) by Queen Victoria at Windsor on 1 July 1895. Accordingly, hereinafter, references to Henry (Campbell), to CB and to Sir Henry (Campbell-Bannerman).\n\nElectoral Law and Practice\n\nThere were four major electoral enactments or groups of such during Sir Henry’s lifetime, The 1867 Reform Act for England and Wales and the 1868 Reform Acts for Scotland and Ireland, (effective from the 1868 General Election) extended the franchise to adult male householders in the burgh/borough constituencies and redistributed constituencies. As will be considered, the extension of the burgh/borough franchise in 1868 was of particular significance at the start of Sir Henry’s electoral career in the constituency of Stirling Burghs. The 1872 Ballot Act introduced secret voting. The 1883 Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act placed a maximum limit on election expenses incurred by candidates. The 1884 Reform Act and the 1885 Redistribution Act (effective from the 1885 General Election) extending the franchise to adult male householders in the county constituencies and redistributing constituencies.\n\nFurther, until 1918, General Elections were held over a period of some weeks, with polling in Orkney and Shetland and the University constituencies often being completed a week or so after polling in the other constituencies had been completed, Thus, for example, The 1906 General Election – 12 to 29 January (to 8 February), in Chapter 11 Table 23, indicates that the English boroughs started to poll on 12 January with such in all the boroughs, burghs and counties (except Orkney & Shetland) being completed by 29 January but with such in the Universities and Orkney & Shetland not being completed until 8 February. (Polling started in the Scottish burghs, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, on 18 January with such in the counties starting on 19 January) Accordingly, General Election campaigns continued after the early results were declared. For example, Sir Henry’s final campaign speech in 1906 not being until 22 January at Larbert in Stirlingshire. (Refer also to J. Blair and David Chapel, A Handbook of Parliamentary Elections in Scotland [1909])\n\nMinisterial By-Elections\n\nMinisterial By-Elections were caused by a provision in the 1707 Succession to the Crown Act – as modified in 1919 and totally repealed in 1928 – that MPs appointed to certain senior ministerial and other public offices were required to seek re-election at a by-election, unless, as in December 1905, a General Election was called immediately following the appointment(s). Such MPs were more often than not re-elected unopposed as at all four such 19th century by-elections in Stirling Burghs – Archibald Primrose (Courtesy Title – Lord Dalmeny), father of the 5th (Scottish) Earl of Rosebery (Liberal Prime Minister in 1894-1895), when appointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty in 1835 and Henry Campbell-Bannerman following his appointments as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1884 and as Secretary of State for War in 1886 and 1892.\n\nOthers were not so fortunate. William Gladstone did not contest a ministerial by-election in Newark on 29 January 1846 when he was appointed Secretary of State for War and the Colonies and was out of Parliament until elected for Oxford University at the July/August 1847 General Election. Winston Churchill was defeated at a ministerial by-election in Manchester North-West on 24 April 1908 when he was appointed President of the Board of Trade, but was elected, fifteen days later, at a by-election in Dundee on 9 May.\n\nPeerages\n\nUnless otherwise stated all peerages mentioned hereinafter are Peerages of Great Britain (1707-1801) or of the United Kingdom (from 1801)\n\nUntil legislation from 1963 onwards, Peers of Scotland and Ireland who also held English or, from 1707 or 1801, British or UK peerages were entitled to sit in the House of Lords by reason of such other peerages rather than as Scottish or Irish Representative Peers. George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th (Scottish) Earl of Aberdeen, when Peelite Prime Minister in 1852-1855, sat in the Lords as 1st (UK) Viscount Gordon. Archibald Primrose, 5th (Scottish) Earl of Rosebery, Liberal Prime Minister in 1894-1895, sat in the Lords for most of his parliamentary career as 2nd (UK) Lord Rosebery. Victor Alexander Bruce, 9th (Scottish) Earl of Elgin and 13th (Scottish) Earl of Kincardine, Liberal Colonial Secretary in 1905-1908, sat in the Lords as 2nd (UK) Lord Elgin. However, John Stuart, 3rd [Scottish] Earl of Bute, while briefly Tory Prime Minister in 1762-1763, sat in the Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer.\n\nNo Scottish Peerages, as such, were created after 1707. Scottish Representative Peers were elected for a Parliament with the last such elections being in 1959. However, Irish Peerages continued to be created until 1898. Irish Representative Peers were elected for life with the last such peer being elected in 1919 and the last such peer dying in 1961.\n\nNevertheless, unlike all other Peers who, until recently, were not eligible, other Peers of Ireland were eligible for election as MPs. Thus Henry Temple, 3rd (Irish) Viscount Palmerston (Prime Minister as a Whig in 1855-1858 and as a Liberal in 1859-1865) not being an Irish Representative Peer or having any British or UK Peerages, was able to serve in the House of Commons between 1807 and 1865.\n\nSons and some grandsons of Peers, including Lord Dalmeny as above mentioned, who were elected to the House of Commons usually used a courtesy title. John Russell (Prime Minister as a Whig in 1846-1852 and as a Liberal in 1865-1866), third son of the 6th (English) Duke of Bedford, was known as Lord John Russell until he was created Earl Russell in 1861. Spencer Crompton Cavendish (a Cabinet Minister as a Liberal in 1866, 1868-1874 and 1880-1885 and as a Liberal Unionist in 1895-1903) was known as Lord Cavendish until his father succeeded as 7th (English) Duke of Devonshire in 1858 and then as the Marquis of Hartington until he succeeded as 8th Duke in 1891. Alexander Murray (a Liberal MP in 1900-1912 and Chief Whip in 1910-1912) was known as the Master of Elibank, a traditional title for an heir to a Scottish Peerage, until he was created Lord Murray of Elibank in 1912. He predeceased his father and a younger brother succeeded to the family peerages.\n\nPurchasing Power of the £ Sterling 1836 to 1908\n\nThe purchasing power of the £ Sterling during Sir Henry’s lifetime was in the range of from 80 to 100 times current money values.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to acknowledge the work of all those at Austin Macauley who have been involved in the production of this book, especially Annette Longman, Chief Editor and Vinh Tran, my Production Coordinator.\n\nI am also particularly grateful to Lord Steel of Aikwood not only for writing the Foreword but also for other helpful comments.\n\nMy thanks also to The High School of Glasgow for giving me access to School publications dating from 1906, some including material dating back to the 16th century, and for confirming that extracts and illustrations from such may be reproduced provided due acknowledgement is given.

Sir Henry’s great-great-great-great-grandfather, John Campbell (Died c.1669) had the nickname of Duinecoir, from the Gaelic duine (‘man’) and coir (‘just/right’) but taken to mean ‘honest man’. In 1660x1665,¹ John Campbell’s son (Born c.1645) accidentally killed a young McColl. Although apparently forgiven by the deceased’s family, he thought it best to leave the district. Thus he arrived in the Menteith district of Perthshire and, under the assumed surname of McOran (taken to mean ‘son of the honest man‘) entered into the service of William Graham, 8th (Scottish) Earl of Menteith. On The McOran’s marriage, in 1670x1675,¹ to Nancy Haldane, a daughter of Hugo Haldane of Gleneagles and a niece of Patrick Haldane of Lanrick Castle, he was settled by the Earl on the farm of Inchanoch in the Parish of Port of Menteith. The farm, apparently between the lands of Rednock and Gartmore, was held by the family rent free until 1799 and then by a one year lease in 1799-1800, with the lease being renewed for nine years in 1800.\n\nThe Earl, who was also 2nd (Scottish) Earl of Airth, and had succeeded his grandfather in 1661, died, without issue, in 1694. However, fourteen years earlier, by reason of indebtedness, he had disposed of most of the already much reduced lands of the Menteith Earldom. One portion went to James Graham, 3rd (Scottish) Marquis of Montrose, the head of the senior branch of the Graham family. Another portion, including Inchanoch, went to the Earl’s nephew, the then Graham of Gartmore. Thus, from 1680, the McOrans held Inchanoch of the Grahams of Gartmore. Gartmore is in the Civil Parish of Port of Menteith which is now within the jurisdiction of Stirling Council, The Parish is now also part of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park.\n\nThe 7th Earl had been deprived of his Menteith Earldom by Charles I in 1632 for allegedly claiming that his ancestor, David Stewart, rather than David’s older half-brother, John Stewart (who reigned as Robert III) should have succeeded their father, Robert II as King of Scots in 1390. The Earl was given a new Earldom (Airth) instead, but was subsequently allowed to resume the Menteith title.\n\nThe McOran-Campbells continued to be mindful of their Argyllshire origins, being responsible in later years for reclaiming two farms – Easter and Western Lorne – from the Moss in the Melfort area.² (Also, as will be considered in Chapter 8, by reason of another family connection, a village in what is now Zimbabwe was named Melfort). Further, a Dugald McCorran is recorded at Fernoch, Melfort in 1689.³ So, the often quoted local saying, ‘there was never a Campbell in Menteith or a McOran out of it’, has to be interpreted as meaning that the McOran-Campbells never used the surname Campbell in Menteith.\n\nDonald McOran, the son of the original McOran and Nancy Haldane of Inchanoch, also married a Haldane (Agnes, probably a cousin). Their son, James was a great-grandfather of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In the Port of Menteith Parish Register for 1 February 1713 – which records James’ baptism – the spellings are ‘Haldan’ and ‘Inchie-noch’, with also ‘McCorran’ recorded, as above, as an alternative (and perhaps the more authentic) spelling of ‘McOran’ The Gaelic word oran is usually translated as ‘song’. Accordingly, it is appropriate to note that James McOran-Campbell, a descendant of the McOrans of Inchanoch, has become a leading concert and operatic singer in recent years.\n\nLanrick Castle (demolished illegally in 2002) was four miles north-west of Doune in Perthshire. It was held by the Earls of Menteith until 1460 when it was sold to a branch of the Haldanes of Gleneagles. The Haldanes of Lanrick Castle having been forfeited for their part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745-1746, the Castle was acquired in 1776 by General John Murray who was really a MacGregor.\n\nThe penal statutes against the MacGregors having been finally repealed in 1774, the General was publicly acknowledged as Chief of Clan Gregor and created a Baronet in 1795. The 2nd Baronet resumed the surname MacGregor by royal license in 1822. After reconstruction in the 1790s Lanrick Castle was known as Clan Gregor Castle until sold out of the family in 1831. The new owner was William Jardine, co-founder of the Hong Kong trading company Jardine Matheson, who was Whig MP for Ashburton, Kent in 1841-1842.⁴ His heir was his nephew, Sir Robert Jardine, Bt. who was a Liberal MP in 1865-1874 [Ashburton and Dumfries Burghs] and MP for Dumfries-shire as a Liberal in 1880-1886 and as a Liberal Unionist MP in 1886-1892\n\nCoincidentally, two Haldanes of Gleneagles were among Sir Henry’s 18th century predecessors as MPs for Stirling Burghs. (Refer to Chapter 3 and Appendix 1) Further, the descent of Sir Henry from the Haldanes of Gleneagles also means that he was very distantly related to Richard Burdon Haldane (Viscount Haldane 1911), who served in his 1905-1908 Cabinet as Secretary of State for War. As from the same descent, Sir Henry was also very distantly related to such maternally Haldanes as Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun (c.1653-1716), and Admiral Adam Duncan (1731-1804), Viscount Duncan of Camperdown.⁵\n\nAndrew Fletcher served in the old Scottish Parliament in 1681-1682 and again, after a period of political outlawry and exile, in 1702-1707. During the debates in 1706-1707, he favoured a federal, rather than an incorporating, union of Scotland with England (and Wales). Admiral Duncan was the victor of the sea battle of Camperdown in 1797. His son was created Earl of Camperdown and his son, known by his courtesy title of Viscount Duncan, was a Whig MP for Southampton in 1837-1841, for Bath in 1841-1852 and for Forfarshire (Angus) from 1854 until he succeeded to the family peerages in 1859. One of his residences was on inherited land at Gleneagles in Perthshire, reflecting his connection with the Haldanes. He was in favour of secret ballots and the ending of all religious discrimination. Robert Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown served in Gladstone’s First Administration as a Government Whip in the House of Lords in 1868-1870 and as Civil Lord of the Admiralty in 1870-1874. The Earl was responsible for persuading Richard Burdon Haldane, his distant relative and near neighbour in Perthshire, to enter active Liberal politics in 1878. ⁶ The Camperdown estate on the outskirts of Dundee has been converted into a large public park, a golf course and a nature reserve.\n\nPort of Menteith (Gaelic Port Loch Innis Mo Cholmaig) – on the north-east shore of what is usually known nowadays as the ‘Lake’ of Menteith (Gaelic Loch Innis Mo Cholmaig) – is the base for the ferry (Gaelic port) for the Island of Inchmaholme (Gaelic Innis Mo Cholmaig, meaning ‘My Colmac’s Island’.) In past times Port of Menteith itself, although giving its name to the Parish, was never more than a small hamlet – with church, manse, inn, school, schoolhouse and a few cottages – although given the status of a Burgh of Barony, in favour of the then Earl of Menteith, by King James III in 1466.\n\nScottish Burghs of Barony, as distinct from Royal Burghs, were granted in favour of tenants-in-chief who held their lands directly from the Crown. This gave the landowner various trading rights (to hold weekly markets and/or to trade overseas). The remaining Burghs of Barony were, as such, abolished in 1893 by the 1892 Burgh Police (Scotland) Act.\n\nIn records and maps of 1646,1654 and 1742 and in the (First) Statistical Account – with the entry for the Parish written by the then Parish Minister in 1791-1793 – the ‘Lake’ was known as a ‘Loch’, as also by Sir Walter Scott. Both ‘Loch’ and ‘Lake’ were used by Dr. Patrick Graham in his Sketches of Perthshire (c.1812). In the mid-19th century New Statistical Account – with the entry for the Parish written by the then Parish Minister – the reference was to the ‘Lake of Inchmaholme’, a very ‘English’ translation of the Gaelic. Queen Victoria, who visited the area in 1869, referred, in her Highland Journal to ‘the Loch of Menteith (the only loch in Scotland which is ever called lake)’.⁷ Further, according to Andrew F. Hutchison, writing in 1899, during the 19th century, many locals referred to the ‘Loch o’ Port’.⁸ The Loch/Lake, with its surface less than 100 feet above sea level, lies within a natural basin surrounded by hills. Hence, in early maps, the Loch/Lake is shown as within the Laicht of Menteith, with Laicht (otherwise ‘laich’ and ‘laigh’) meaning ‘lowland’. So, rather than refer to the ‘Lake of Menteith’, it would be more appropriate to refer to the Loch of the Laicht (Lowland) of Menteith. Nearly all the other ‘Lakes’ in Scotland are man-made except Manxman’s Lake which is a sea bay near Kirkcudbright.⁹\n\nInchmaholme Island’s Augustinian Priory, dating from c.1238, was visited by King Robert I (The Bruce) and King Robert II. It also provided refuge for three weeks in 1547 for Mary, Queen of Scots (then aged four) during a period of English incursions. By the time of the Reformation the Priory had ‘lay’ Abbots, known as Commendators. (A Commendator held his office in commendam [in trust] rather than in titilum [by entitlement] as did Abbots and Priors who were monks and lived in their monasteries.) Indeed, one such Commendator, David Erskine of Cardross (whose family became Patrons of the Parish of Port of Menteith) represented the Priory at the Reformation Parliament in Edinburgh in August 1560. By 1606, the Priory was no more than a secular possession of the Scottish Earls of Mar (Erskines) and later of the Scottish Marquises and Dukes of Montrose (Grahams), with the 6th Duke passing the Priory into the care of the State in 1926. The Priory’s remains are now in the care of Historic Scotland, with the ferry now running only from April to October.\n\nCoincidentally, the Rev. Linda Stewart, who was, in 2001-2008, Parish Minister of Meigle (where Sir Henry and Lady Campbell-Bannerman are buried) was Parish Minister of Port of Menteith (as linked with Aberfoyle in 1983) in 2008-2012. (The Parish Churches of Aberfoyle and Port of Menteith are about 4 miles apart.)\n\nAnother coincidence is that Lord Campbell of Pittenweem, Leader of the Liberal Democrat Party in 2006-2007, and Lady Campbell owned a little farmhouse near Port of Menteith for about twenty years from the 1970s.¹⁰ Further, the Glasgow birthplaces of Sir Henry (in 1836) and of Sir Menzies (in 1941), were only about half-a-mile apart, as the crow flies, or a half-hour walk, Moreover, both were born into Clan Campbell, educated at school and at university in Glasgow (and at universities furth of Scotland), married the daughters of Major-Generals, had an interest in the Speakership of the House of Commons and were thereafter elected party leaders in their sixties.\n\nIn 1785 Sir Henry’s paternal grandfather, James McOran (1752-1831), great-grandson of the first McOran of Inchanoch, married Helen Forrester (Born 1763). The Forresters had tenanted the farm of Frew (near Kippen) in Stirlingshire for over 300 years. Kippen was also in Menteith but, unlike the seven other Menteith parishes which were in Perthshire, Kippen Parish was divided between Perthshire and Stirlingshire. Unlike her husband, and most other people in Menteith at that time, Mrs. McOran did not have the Gaelic. Therefore, their four sons and four daughters did not learn Gaelic. Thus, the future Prime Minister was only one complete generation away from having Gaelic.\n\nApparently, both before and after his marriage in 1785, James McOran had exchanged visits with Captain Neil (or Niel) Campbell, a Melfort landowner. Indeed, the Captain had promised the young James a commission if he would enter the army. When the McOrans’ first son was both in 1787, the Captain expressed a wish that the child should be called Neil (or Niel). However, the parents preferred John as the child’s name. The Captain took the choice amiss and never visited Inchanoch again.¹¹. So, the family’s future lay elsewhere, in particular as from 1803 when the then ‘Graham’ of Gartmore (who used the surname Bontine) transferred the superiority of Inchanoch to the adjacent proprietor, Graham Shepherd of Rednock.\n\nRobert Graham (1735-1797) of Gartmore had assumed the surname Bontine in 1770 by reason of an inheritance of land but, after the death of his father (Nicol Graham), and as Radical MP for Stirlingshire in 1794-1796, he was again known as Robert Graham. Then, in 1796, he added Cunninghame to his surname by reason of another inheritance of land. He was a close friend of Charles James Fox and Rector of Glasgow University in 1785-1787 (in between Edmund Burke and Adam Smith.) His son, who inherited in 1797, was always known as Bontine but his colourful Harrow-educated grandson (1852-1936) resumed the surname Cunninghame-Graham in 1883 to become, as Robert Bontine Cunninghame-Graham of Gartmore, Liberal/Labour MP for North West Lanarkshire in 1886-1892. Thereafter, he was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893, the unsuccessful Liberal Candidate for West Stirlingshire in 1918, first Chairman of the National Party of Scotland (in 1928), which, in 1934, merged with the Scottish Party (formed in 1932) to form the Scottish National Party (SNP), of which he was first President.¹²\n\nThen, in 1804, the McOrans relinquished the lease of the family farm to Mr. Shepherd in return for a payment of £525 and moved to Glasgow where they resumed the surname of Campbell. They had in mind to move on to North America but – except for the eldest son, John – this notion was soon abandoned. The parents opened a grocer’s shop at 304 Gallowgate (east of Glasgow Cross). After moving to the Saltmarket (south of Glasgow Cross), they, gave up the business in 1807, and eventually retired to Parkhead, then in open country to the east of Glasgow.\n\nThe family also continued to be mindful of their Menteith connection. Sir Henry’s father, Sir James Campbell had known before his death in 1876 that a new Parish Church was to be built in Port of Menteith – to replace the Church, built in 1771, in which the family had worshipped – and had promised to make some provision for the new building as the means of fulfilling his promise to his parents to commemorate their association with the Parish. Thus, after Sir James’ death, the funding by his sons – James Alexander Campbell and Henry – of the Stained Glass Window for the new Church building, as opened on 3 October 1878.¹³ (Refer also to Chapter 4)\n\nJohn Campbell (1787-1872), who had already worked for a year as a grocer’s apprentice in Glasgow went to the USA where he married a Mary Kennedy He subsequently returned to Glasgow for a few years and worked in his brothers’ business. He then went back to the USA and eventually settled in Fonda (formerly Caughnawaga) in the Mohawk Valley, Montgomery County, New York State.\n\nIn 1863, during the US Civil War, he and his wife were involved in raising funds in Fonda to pay for two flags as then presented to the 115th New York Infantry Regiment. In 1885 John Campbell’s family were still living in Fonda.¹⁴\n\nThe Regiment, with headquarters in Fonda, was mustered on 26 August 1862 with men from Fonda serving in four of its ten companies. It was mustered-out at Raleigh, North Carolina on 17 June 1865. Caughnawaga was renamed Fonda after a late 18th century settler, Douw Fonda, an ancestor of Henry Fonda the actor. One wonders if any members of John Campbell’s family in Glasgow were aware that the former Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, after his release from imprisonment, visited Glasgow in 1869. He stayed with his friend, James Smith – a merchant who had supported the Confederates financially – at his residence of Benvue in Dowanhill. James Smith’s younger brother, Robert had been killed while serving as a Colonel in the Mississippi"
