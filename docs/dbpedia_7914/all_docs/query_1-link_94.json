        "text": "ACCRINGTON Jeanette Winterton (b. 1959 in Manchester), is the famous contemporary author of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, an account of her childhood in Accrington.\n\nASHTON-UNDER -LYNE A blue plaque commemorating H.V. Morton (1892-1979) is permanently located in Henry Square, Ashton-under-Lyne, close to his birthplace at Chester Square. He wrote many iconic travel books about Britain and the Middle East, of which In Search of England (1927) and In Search of Scotland (1929) are particularly characteristic. Simon Hoggart (1946-2014), journalist and broadcaster, was born in Ashton-under-Lyne. He wrote witty, but perceptive columns for both The Spectator and The Guardian, and numerous books.\n\nASHTON-UPON-MERSEY Stanley Houghton (1881 – 1913), playwright, was born here. He was a prominent member, together with Allan Monkhouse and Harold Brighouse, of a group known as the Manchester School of dramatists. His best known play is Hindle Wakes (1912). It was, for its time, open about sex and, thus, highly controversial. The Georgian poet Lascelles Abercrombie (1881–1938) was born in Ashton upon Mersey, part of Sale. He became a lecturer in poetry at the University of Liverpool.\n\nBLACKBURN Jessica Lofthouse (1906-1988) was born in Wilson Street, Clitheroe in 1906. She moved to Blackburn in 1917 and began her teaching career in Liverpool, but returned to Blackburn to teach Art and Local Studies. In 1938 she had a series of articles printed in the Blackburn Times illustrated with her own drawings. This was the basis of her subsequent career. Her many highly successful books include The Curious Traveller Through Lakeland (1954). Alfred Wainwright (1907 – 1991), author of the much revered Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells, is commemorated by a plaque at 331 Audley Range, Blackburn reading “The birthplace of Alfred Wainwright author and fell walker” (1907-1991)\n\nJosephine Cox (b. 1941), the author of some fifty “north country” novels, the first of which was published in 1988, was also born in Blackburn.\n\nBLACKPOOL Alistair Cooke, the broadcaster famous for his Letters from America, moved to 10 Vance Road, opposite the Bus Station on Central Drive, from Manchester in 1917. He attended Blackpool Grammar School. There is a plaque:\n\nAlistair Cooke, the broadcaster famous for his Letters from America, moved here in 1917, later attending Blackpool Grammar School.\n\nBOLTON Monica Ali (b. 1967) was born in Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to a Bangladeshi father and an English mother. When she was three, her family moved to Bolton. She went to Bolton School and then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Wadham College, Oxford. Her controversial first novel, Brick Lane (2003), illuminates Bangladeshi life in Tower Hamlets. It was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Bill Naughton (1910 -1992) was an Irish-born British playwright, best known for his play Alfie, lived in Bolton.\n\nBOWDON Alison Uttley (1884–1976), children’s writer, who was born in Derbyshire, moved to Bowdon in 1924 and wrote the highly successful Little Grey Rabbit books while living there. There is a blue plaque at Downs House, 13 Higher Downs, Bowdon, where she lived from 1924 to 1938. Juliana Ewing (1841–1885), a significant Victorian children’s author, also lived, for a comparatively short time, in Bowdon.\n\nBURNLEY Philip Gilbert Hammerton (1834 –1894), artist and art critic and author, was born on 10 September 1834 at Laneside, near Shaw, Oldham, but he was brought up on the outskirts of Burnley.\n\nBURY Richmal Crompton (1890–1969), author, was born on Manchester Road, Bury (a blue plaque marks the house).

Dodie Smith (1896–1990), playwright and novelist, is best known as the author of The Hundred and One Dalmatians. She was born in Whitefield, Bury but grew up in Old Trafford; there is a blue plaque on her childhood home at 609 Stretford Road, Manchester. Her highly successful plays included Autumn Crocus, and Dear Octopus (1938). Her first novel, I Capture the Castle (1949), is semi-autobiographical and is an enthralling book, subsequently made into a film. It has become a Virago Modern Classic. Howard Jacobson (born 1942), novelist, was born in Prestwich (see Manchester).\n\nCOWAN BRIDGE The Clergy Daughters’ School at Cowan Bridge was established in 1823 by the Revd William Carus Wilson (the prototype for Mr Brocklehurst in Jane Eyre). It became notorious as the original of Lowood Institution in Jane Eyre (1847). Charlotte Brontë entered the school in 1824 with her sisters. She always blamed the school’s harsh regime and punitive religious discipline for the early deaths of Elizabeth and Maria, her two older sisters, and her novel graphically portrays the pupils’ sufferings. Controversially Mrs Gaskell identified the school and its head teacher in her Life of Charlotte Brontë (1857). The school, much improved, was removed in 1833 to a new site at Casterton.\n\nDARESBURY (Cheshire) Lewis Carroll [Charles Lutwidge Dodgson] (1832 – 1898), was born in the little parsonage of Daresbury near Warrington and Runcorn. When Charles was 11, the family moved to Croft-on-Tees, North Yorkshire.\n\nHURSTWOOD Edmund Spenser (1552?–1599), the Elizabethan poet, is supposed to be descended from a local family, and it is assumed that he composed his Shepherd’s Calendar while staying with his relatives at Hurstwood. He is said to have lived between 1576 and 1578 in an attractive building constructed of gritstone known as Spenser’s House or, sometimes, Spenser’s Cottage. The Shepherd’s Calendar contains many dialect words and accurate descriptions of Lancashire wildlife. Spenser’s most famous poem is his Faerie Queen, said to be dedicated to a local girl, but rejected by her.\n\nKNOWSLEY HALL Between 1832-1836 Edward Lear (1812–1888) was employed at Knowsley by Edward Stanley, the thirteenth Earl of Derby. He drew sketches of the estate, and the plates to accompany the ‘Knowsley Menagerie’. He was popular with the Derby family and also wrote the Book of Nonsense for the Earl’s grandchildren. This was published in 1846, and along with a number of subsequent volumes published in the 1870s, popularised the limerick. His verse include eternal favourites such as the ‘Owl and the Pussy Cat went to Sea’\n\nLANCASTER In September 1914 The Times published For the Fallen, Laurence Binyon’s most famous poem:\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n\nLaurence Binyon (1869–1943), an art historian and poet, was born at 1, High Street, Lancaster and educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School. This Georgian poet was associated with both Gordon Bottomley (see Silverdale) and Lascelles Abercrombie.\n\nGarry Hogg (1902-1976), travel writer, studied English Language and Literature at Oxford, and became a schoolmaster who in the late 1940s and early 50s taught at Lancaster Royal Grammar School. Robert Woof (1931–2005), literary scholar and museum director, was head boy at the School. Born at Royal Albert Farm, Lancaster, he completed a PhD thesis at Toronto on ‘The literary relations of Wordsworth and Coleridge’ (1959), and became a literary scholar, and biographer. As a museum director he presided over the transformation of the Wordsworth museum at Grasmere into one of the most distinguished institutions of its kind.\n\nLancaster’s other literary associations are, perhaps, rather slighter. Charles Dickens stayed at the King’s Arms Hotel in 1857 & 1862. He informs us that “They gave you bride cake every day after dinner”. U. A. Fanthorpe (1929–2009), the first woman to be nominated as Oxford professor of poetry (1994), who won the queen’s gold medal for poetry in 2003, was “Writer-in-Residence” at St Martin’s College, Lancaster (now part of the University of Cumbria) from 1983 to 85.\n\nJohn Kelsall (1683–1743), Quaker minister and diarist, was brought up at Quernmore, near Lancaster. Richard Adams (1620-1661), poet, is buried in Lancaster Priory church, where he is commemorated by a wall tablet in the chancel. Tom Stephenson (1893–1987), writer and promoter of rambling, received an honorary doctor of law from Lancaster University in 1986. He played a highly significant part in the establishment of the first National Parks. Terry Eagleton (b. 1943), the celebrated literary scholar and cultural theorist, is Professor of English Literature at Lancaster University.\n\nLIVERPOOL A number of prominent authors have visited Liverpool including Daniel Defoe, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole all of whom spent extended periods in the city. Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864), the American novelist, lived in Liverpool as the United States consul between 1853 and 1856. His English Notebooks provide an interesting depiction of Britain in Victorian times.\n\nIn the eighteenth century William Roscoe (1753–1831), historian and patron of the arts, had considerable literary importance in Liverpool. He was born at the Old Bowling Green House, Mount Pleasant, and later lived at Allerton Hall. He became an MP, and made an important contribution to the fight to abolish slavery. Roscoe’s Life of Lorenzo di Medici was considered a remarkable achievement at the time. In addition to his historical works wrote nursery rhymes and other stories for children. There is a plaque at 114 Mount Pleasant, Liverpool, where he was born (1753) and another at Roscoe Gardens, Mount Pleasant which reads:\n\n1753-1831 William Roscoe MP Solicitor & slavery abolitionist ‘Greatest of Liverpool’s Citizens’ buried here\n\nRoscoe’ fifth son Thomas Roscoe (1791–1871), writer and translator, was born at Toxteth Park. Like his father he was fascinated by Italy and things Italian. William Stanley Roscoe (1782–1843), poet, was William Roscoe’s eldest son, and was in turn the father of William Caldwell Roscoe, (1823–1859), poet and essayist.\n\nJames Currie (1756–1805), physician and author, was born in Kirkpatrick Fleming, Dumfriesshire. He had a distinguished career as a medical man in Liverpool where there is a plaque at 53-57 Church Street:\n\nDr James Currie humanitarian & first biographer of Robert Burns lived here\n\nLike Roscoe he fought for the abolition of slavery. Together they wrote a poem entitled The African about the slave trade. Joseph Blanco White 1775-1841, theologian, poet & political exile, is buried at Roscoe Memorial Gardens, Mount Pleasant.\n\nRodney Street, named after Admiral George Rodney, was laid out by William Roscoe in 1783–1784. William Ewart Gladstone, four times prime minister, was born at No. 62, but the street also has several literary associations. No. 9 was the birthplace of Arthur Hugh Clough, and of his sister Anne, first principal of Newnham College, Cambridge. Lytton Strachey, biographer, historian & member of the Bloomsbury Group, lived at 80 Rodney Street. Nicholas Monsarrat (1910-1979) was born at 11 Rodney Street. A plaque states that he was Lieutenant Commander RNVR in the Battle of the Atlantic; famous seafaring son of Liverpool and author of The Cruel Sea.\n\nThomas De Quincey (1785–1859), visited friends in Liverpool in the summer of 1801 and was brought into contact with Roscoe, of whose poetry he had a poor opinion, but he thought highly of Roscoe and James Currie as abolitionists. In 1803 he went to stay at Everton, then a village, for three months and kept a diary, only published in 1927.\n\nFelicia Dorothea Hemans (1793–1835), poet, was born at 118 Duke Street, Liverpool. She is best known for her highly popular poem Casabianca (known as The Boy stood on the Burning Deck) published in 1826. It is about the fate of the ship Orient during the Battle of the Nile. A prolific poet, Hemans was well regarded by Wordsworth. Arthur Hugh Clough (1819–1861), poet, was born in Liverpool. In 1829, he entered Rugby School; there he formed lifelong friendship with Matthew Arnold. His first poetry was original and experimental. He is best known for his epic poem The Bothie of Tober na Vourich about a reading party in the Highlands. Clough’s reputation seemed to diminish during his lifetime. At one time he was thought of as a future poet laureate.\n\nCharles Dickens (1812-1870), the pre-eminent novelist, visited Liverpool in 1838, and from 1842 until 1869 he was a frequent visitor, giving readings from his novels to large audiences. Margaret Oliphant (1828–1897), novelist and biographer, was born in Scotland, but in 1838 her father became excise clerk in the custom house at Liverpool. They changed house in Everton several times before moving to Grosvenor Road in Birkenhead. Her first published novel, Passages in the Life of Margaret Maitland (1849), set in Liverpool, attracted the attention of both Charles Dickens and Charlotte Brontë. Herman Melville (1819-1891), who is best known as the author of Moby Dick, used his 1839 visit to Liverpool as the basis for his fourth novel, Redburn, or His First Voyage, published in 1849. Redburn was a fictionalized version of Melville’s own first voyage. It provides a lively account of Victorian Liverpool. It begins with Redburn following the path his father must have taken took through the city many years before. Melville visited the city again in 1856 and then travelled to Scotland searching for his own ancestors. Anthony Trollope’s The Way We Are Now (1875) has a scene set in Lime Street Station. Blanche Atkinson (1847-1911) Victorian novelist and author of children’s books, was born in Aigburth. She is noted for her and friendship with John Ruskin. Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889), poet, served as a priest 1879-1881 at St. Francis Xavier’s Church, 11, Langsdale Street, Liverpool, where there is a plaque.\n\nLate Victorian and Edwardian literary figures associated with Liverpool include Augustine Birrell (1850–1933), author and critic, who was born at Wavertree, and Richard Le Gallienne (1866–1947), poet and essayist, born in West Derby, and Robert Tressell [pseud.] (1870–1911) He is best known for his novel The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. He was born in Dublin and died at Liverpool Royal Infirmary in February 1911 from tuberculosis. There is a plaque at 70 Pembroke Place. Hall Caine (1853 –1931), popular novelist and playwright, was born in Runcorn (Cheshire}. His father emigrated from the Isle of Man to Liverpool, but at the time of Hall Caine’s birth was working in the Cheshire town. The family returned to Liverpool, where Caine was brought up. He was educated at the Hope Street British Schools. He discovered the poetry of Coleridge and the writings of John Ruskin, both of whom influenced him and, for a time, he was secretary to D. G. Rossetti. His best sellers were set in the Isle of Man whence he returned after his parents died. Wilfred Owen (1893 – 1918), war poet, was brought up in Birkenhead between 1898 and 1907. He went to the Birkenhead Institute until he was 14. Liverpool is associated with two significant book illustrators: Walter Crane (1845–1915), illustrator, designer, and painter, was born on 15 August 1845 at 12 Maryland Street, Liverpool; and Shirley Hughes (b. 1927), author and illustrator, has written more than fifty books, and illustrated more than 200. She twice won the Kate Greenaway Medals for British children’s book illustration. She was born in West Kirby, then in the county of Cheshire (now in Merseyside), and she grew up on the Wirral.\n\nLate nineteenth and early twentieth century Liverpool is connected with several considerable novelists. Hugh Walpole (1884–1941), the New Zealand-born writer, served as a lay minister at the seaman’s mission in Liverpool in 1906. In later life he lived in Cumbria and wrote the Herries novels there. Malcolm Lowry (1909 –1957) was an English poet and novelist who is best known for his novel Under the Volcano (1947), inspired by his residence in Mexico. He was born in Wallasey. James Gordon Farrell (1935 –1979) was a Liverpool-born novelist of Irish descent. He gained prominence for the series of novels known as “the Empire Trilogy”: Troubles, about Ireland, The Siege of Krishnapur, about India and The Singapore Grip, about the occupation of Singapore. The novels deal with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. From the age of 12 he attended Rossall School.\n\nMuch is made of the popular music of Liverpool of the sixties but, at the same time there was a flowering of performance poetry. Indeed, the two were sometimes indistinguishable. The anthology The Mersey Sound was published by Penguin in 1967, containing the poems of Adrian Henri, Roger McGough and Brian Patten. It brought these three poets to national attention. Adrian Henri (1932–2000), born in Birkenhead, was a poet and painter best remembered as the founder of poetry-rock group the “Liverpool Scene”. His poetry remained highly Liverpool orientated throughout his life. Roger McGough (b.1937) was born in Litherland, on the outskirts of Liverpool. He is perhaps best known for Let Me Die a Youngman’s Death. However, he has written much poetry distinguished, in the opinion of The Oxford Companion, by ‘high spirits, wit and accessibility’. His infectious enthusiasm for poets and poetry is illustrated in broadcasts on Radio 4. Brian Patten (b.1946) poet, was born near Liverpool’s docks, and attended Sefton Park School in the Smithdown Road area of Liverpool. He has published several collections of verse and written a great deal for children. In 2002 the three were given the Freedom of the City of Liverpool.\n\nJohn McGrath, (1935–2002), playwright and director, was born at 3 St David Road, Birkenhead. Jimmy McGovern (b.1949) initially a writer on Brookside he went on to write Cracker starring Robbie Coltrane and the film Priest as well as the reality based drama Hillsborough based on the tragedy. Peter Tinniswood (1936–2003), writer, was born at 5 Granard Road, Wavertree. When his father was offered a job on the Manchester Guardian the family moved to Manchester. His ironic pieces about village cricket made good broadcasts.\n\nBeryl Bainbridge (1932–2010), actress, writer, and artist, was born at 294 Menlove Avenue, Allerton and brought up in Raven Meols Lane, Formby. In early married life she and her husband settled in Liverpool in a house at 22 Huskisson Street, on the edge of Toxteth, but the marriage later broke up.\n\nAn acclaimed writer, nominated five times for the Booker Prize during her lifetime, she finally received a posthumous award in 2011. Dame Beryl Bainbridge’s first job was at the Playhouse Williamson Square. She based her 1989 novel An Awfully Big Adventure on her experiences. Many of her early stories are set in Liverpool In these books Bainbridge constantly ransacked and reinvented her past. Her aunts Margot and Nellie were central to The Dressmaker (1973). The Bottle Factory Outing (1974) drew on Bainbridge’s brief experience of working on a bottle-labelling line. A Quiet Life (1976) returned to the troubled setting of her Formby upbringing, dramatizing the relationship she had begun at fourteen with Harry Franz, a German prisoner of war, a decade her senior, whom she had met in the pinewoods near her home. Even Young Adolf (1978), which imagines Hitler’s visit to his sister-in-law in Liverpool, was set ‘with all the streets I remembered and the people I knew’\n\nDorothy Kathleen Broster, (1877–1950), novelist, was born at Grassendale Park, Garston She produced her best-seller about Scottish history, The Flight of the Heron, in 1925. Broster stated she had consulted eighty reference books before beginning the novel. Broster followed it up with two successful sequels, The Gleam in the North and The Dark Mile. Barbara Pym (1913-1980), novelist, studied at the Huyton College, in Liverpool, 1925-1931.\n\nMANCHESTER Manchester’s literature reflects the industrial evolution and the growth of the city as “Cottonopolis”. Thomas de Quincey (1785–1859), author and intellectual, best known for his Confessions of an English opium-Eater (1821) was born at Cross Street, Manchester where there was a plaque. He also lived at The Farm, Moss side and Greenheys. He attended Manchester Grammar School, but his principal literary achievements are associated with Scotland, and the Lake District. Samuel Bamford (1788-1872) Born in 1788 in Middleton, the son of a muslin weaver, Bamford was also educated at Manchester Grammar School, and worked as a weaver. He was always interested in literature and poetry, and he spoke publicly at the Peterloo Massacre. This event which prompted Passages in the Life of a Radical (1840). Charles Swain, (1801–1874), poet, was born in Every Street, and baptized at St Ann’s. His verses were very popular and often set to music. He died in Prestwich where there is memorial in the parish church. Harrison Ainsworth (1805–1882), novelist, was born 21 King Street, Manchester, where there is a plaque:\n\nWm. Harrison Ainsworth 1805-1883 novelist was born in a house which stood on this site.\n\nHe wrote 39 (usually historical) novels, among which the best-known is The Lancashire Witches (1848).\n\nMrs Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) grew up in Knutsford, and two of her books are based on the town: Cranford, and Wives and Daughters. After her marriage to a Unitarian minister in 1832, she lived at various places in Manchester including Chorlton-on-Medlock and 84, Plymouth Grove where there is a plaque:\n\nElizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (1810 – 1865) Novelist and Authoress of Mary Barton, Cranford and many other works lived here (1849 – 1865).\n\nThis fine regency house is open to the public. Mary Barton (1848) was Mrs. Gaskell’s first novel and an immediate success. It is a realistic portrait of industrial life in Manchester, and vividly displays her social concerns. As a result of her literary reputation she was visited by key mid-century literary figures including Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Mrs Harriet Beecher Stowe.\n\nWilliam Gaskell, Nonconformist minister and writer, a pioneer in the education of the working class, was appointed Minister of Cross Street Chapel in 1828, and served until his death in 1884. There is a plaque at Chapel Walks, Cross Street:\n\nFirst School and Chapel House built here 1734. Early meeting place of Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society founded 1781. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810 – 1865) worshipped here.\n\nIntriguingly another Unitarian Harriet Martineau (1802-1876), writer, sometimes thought of as the first woman sociologist, was once engaged to a young minister at Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, but he died in 1827. She used her acquaintanceship with Manchester to write what is regarded as the first work of fiction to deal with industrial relations, A Manchester Strike (1832). Later in the same decade Frances Trollope (1779–1863), novelist and traveller, also wrote much fiction which dealt with social themes. For a time in the 1840s Dickens saw her as a serious rival. In 1839 she visited Manchester for purposes of research and published an exposé of child labour in Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy (1839–1840):\n\nIn the very poorest agricultural village, the cottages which shelter its labourers have the pure untainted air of heaven to blow around their humble roofs; but where forests of tall bare chimneys, belching eternal clouds of smoke rear their unsightly shafts towards the sky, in lieu of verdant air-refreshing trees, the black tint of the loathsome factory seems to rest upon every object near it. The walls are black, the fences are black, the window-panes (when there are any) are all veiled in black. No domestic animal that pertinaciously exists within their tainted purlieus, but wears the same dark hue, and perhaps there is no condition of human life so significantly surrounded by types of its own wretchedness as this.\n\nCharles Dickens was very familiar with Manchester and knew both Harrison Ainsworth and Elizabeth Gaskell. He visited town in 1837 and stayed there in 1852. His industrial novel Hard Times (1854) is generally considered to be set in Manchester.\n\nManchester was where Charlotte Brontë (1816-1855) began to write Jane Eyre. A plaque at the Salutation, Boundary Street West reads:\n\nIn 1846 The Revd. Patrick Brontë came to Manchester for a cataract operation accompanied by his daughter Charlotte. They took lodgings at 59 Boundary Street West (formerly known as 83 Mount Pleasant) It was here that Charlotte began to write her first successful novel Jane Eyre.\n\nIn June 1851 Charlotte first called on Mrs Gaskell who eventually wrote her biography. A lesser figure in this web of literary relationships was Mary Louisa Molesworth (1839–1921), writer of children’s stories, was born in Holland, but she returned to England, first to Preston and then to Manchester. She called Manchester “Smokytown” in her children’s books, but the family were able to move further from the centre, finally to the select suburb of Whalley Range. In adolescence she attended the private classes of the Reverend William Gaskell.\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924), novelist, was born at 385 Cheetham Hill Road in Manchester, but after her father died, her mother sold up and moved to Tennessee to live with her brother. Burnett’s most famous novels were Little Lord Fauntleroy (1886) and The Secret Garden (1909). The Victorian novelist George Gissing (1857-1903), novelist, was born in Yorkshire, but attended a boarding school in Cheshire and got a scholarship to what is now Manchester University, but he was expelled. John Hay Beith [‘Ian Hay’] (1876 – 1952) novelist and playwright born at Platt Abbey on Wilmslow Road, Rusholme, Manchester. His best-liked play was The Housemaster (1936). He often collaborated with other writers including, for example, P. G. Woodhouse. Dodie Smith (1896 – 1990) author of One Hundred and One Dalmations lived at 609 Stretford Road, Old Trafford, as a child. It was so quiet and semi-rural that the corncrake could still be heard. [see Bury] Howard Spring (1889-1965) journalist and novelist, lived at 26 Hesketh Avenue, Didsbury from 1920 to 1931 when he was working on The Manchester Guardian. His most successful novel was Fame Is the Spur (1940), which describes the rise of the socialist movement in Britain from the mid19th century to the 1930s. Louis Golding (1895 –1958) novelist wrote a succession of popular novels of which Magnolia Street (1932) is the best known. It is set in Hightown and deals with the relationships between Jews and others. He was born at Red Bank, Manchester. Adrian Bell (1901–1980), writer about rural issues, was born on 4 October 1901 at 5 Birch Avenue, Stretford\n\nAnthony Burgess, novelist (1917-1993) is probably best remembered for The Clockwork Orange, (1962) made into a film by Stanley Kubrick. He was born in Harpurhey, Manchester. He became perhaps, Britain’s leading novelist of the 1960s and 70s. He was also an accomplished musician who composed more than 250 musical pieces, including, for example, a Shakespearian ballet. He was also a linguist of some distinction. There is a plaque at Manchester University:\n\nAnthony Burgess 1917-1993 Writer and Composer Graduate BA English 1940\n\nA generation later than Burgess came Howard Jacobson (b. 1942) novelist and critic, who was born in Prestwich in 1942; eventually he went on to teach at the Wolverhampton Polytechnic, which provided the source material his first novel. It was the first of many amusing, but highly perceptive novels including The Mighty Walzer (1999) based on the Jewish community in Manchester during the 1950s. In October 2010 he won the Booker Prize for his novel The Finkler Question, a witty look at Jewish culture.\n\nThere are two distinguished twentieth century playwrights associated with Manchester: Robert Bolt (1924–1995), scriptwriter and playwright, was born at Sale, now a part of Manchester. Both A Flowering Cherry (1958) and A Man For All Seasons (1960) were outstandingly successful in the West End. His screenplays include Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965) and Ryan’s Daughter (1970). Trevor Griffiths (b.1935), playwright and screenwriter, was born in Ancoats, Manchester. He entered Manchester University and read English. He has written for the theatre, television and cinema since the late 60s. His best-known play, Comedians, has been in production since 1975. Jack Morris Rosenthal, (1931–2004), the equally distinguished television dramatist, was born on 8 September 1931 at 27 Kendall Road, Crumpsall, Manchester.\n\nCarol Ann Duffy CBE, FRSL (b. 1955), Poet Laureate, was born in Glasgow. She is Professor of Contemporary Poetry at the Manchester Metropolitan University, and was appointed Britain’s poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot, and the first openly bisexual person to be laureate. Her collections include Standing Female Nude (1985), which won a Scottish Arts Council Award; Mean Time (1993), which won the Whitbread Poetry Award; and Rapture (2005), winner of the T S Eliot Prize.\n\nMILNTHORPE (Westmorland) Constance Holme (1880–1955), novelist and short-story writer, was born on 7 October 1880 at Owlet Ash, Milnthorpe, Westmorland, the youngest daughter of a land agent. Constance Holme’s formal education began as a weekly boarder at a small Methodist school, Oakfield Place, in nearby Arnside. She loved the estuary and hill landscape which provided the inspiration and setting for all her work and was a minor poet. She aroused critical interest with The Lonely Plough, and its dramatic climax drawn from the great River Kent flood of 1907, established her national reputation as a regional novelist of uncommon distinction, and became the book most identified with her name.\n\nSoon after her marriage, she settled at The Gables, Kirkby Lonsdale, where she spent the next twenty years. She returned to Milnthorpe, to live again at Owlet Ash. In February 1954 she moved to a small terraced house, 13 Orchard Road, Arnside.\n\nMORECAMBE Providing an unlikely literary connection, John Osborne, (1929–1994), playwright, wrote his game-changing “kitchen sink” play Look Back in Anger in May–June 1955, partly on the pier at Morecambe, where he was appearing in Seagulls over Sorrento, and partly on a Chiswick barge .\n\nNELSON CLR James (1901 –1989), left-wing author, intellectual and writer on cricket, was invited to live in Nelson by the cricketer and diplomat Learie Constantine. He later moved to London.\n\nOLDHAM Benjamin Brierley (1825-1896), weaver, poet, essayist and writer, was born in Failsworth. A bronze statue was erected of him in 1898 in Queens Park, Manchester. “Ben” Brierley was to become one of the leading exponents of writing in the Lancashire dialect, and achieved local notoriety by his recitals of these works to working men’s clubs. An early love of reading, encouraged by his uncle, and inspiration from the works of John Byrom, Shelley and Shakespeare, maintained his devotion to literary matters, such that he took employment as sub-editor of The Oldham Times, where he worked until 1862. Cofounder of the Failsworth Mechanics’ Institute, with the aim of improving the lot of working men. An original member of the Manchester Literary Club, he served as a City Councillor from 1875 to 1881, and on the Free Libraries Committee where he pushed for working-class reform. He had many of his writings published in local journals. He was popular and respected by all classes of society. He died in 1896. There is a plaque at ‘The Rocks’ 466 Oldham Road, Failsworth, Oldham:\n\nBen Brierley 1825 1896 Lancashire author & poet\n\nWas born in this house 26th June 1825\n\nRoy Fuller (1912 – 1991), an English writer, known as a poet was also born in Failsworth, but brought up in Blackpool. He published much highly regarded work and was Professor of Poetry at Oxford 1968-71.\n\nPADIHAM Padiham is perhaps best described as an overgrown village on the edge of industrial Lancashire. Charlotte Bronte visited Gawthorpe Hall as a guest of Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, who was a great friend and admirer of hers. The house was completed in 1604 and much of its Jacobean character remains. As well as good furniture and portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, the house contains a remarkable collection of textiles and needlework.\n\nPRESTON Both Francis Thompson and Robert Service were born in Preston. Charles Dickens came to report on the Preston strike of 1854 – where cotton mill owners were refusing to raise salaries. It is said that he used Preston as the background to Hard Times, although Dickens repudiated it. Francis Joseph Thompson, (1859–1907), poet and writer, was born on 18 December 1859 at 7 Winckley Street, Preston, Lancashire where there is a plaque, quoting from his noted poem “The Hound of Heaven”:\n\nFrancis Thompson Poet was born in this house Dec 16 1859. “Ever and anon a trumpet sounds From the bird battlements of Eternity”\n\nRobert W. Service (1874–1958), the poet and writer associated with the Yukon Gold Rush, was born at 4 Christian Road, and lived for a time on Winckley Street in the city centre. There is a Blue Plaque commemorating him on Christian Road, near the railway station.\n\nAngela Brazil (1868–1947), writer of school-girl stories, was born at 1 West Cliff, Preston.\n\nRobert Leighton (1822–1869), poet, was born in Dundee but worked for the LNWR at Preston for many years. His Poems by Robert Leighton was published in 1866 .\n\nROCHDALE Edwin Waugh (1817-1890), poet and wit, was the son of a shoemaker in Rochdale. He became one of the most successful of Lancashire dialect poets. It was in 1856 that his first dialect poetry appeared, including his most famous, “Come Whoam to thi’ Childer an’ Me”. He wrote many reports and essays on social and economic matters affecting working people and their poverty. Waugh died at New Brighton in 1890 and is buried at Kersal. Anna Jacobs (born 1941), romantic novelist, was born and lived in Rochdale before emigrating in 1973 to Australia. She continues to write historical novels set in Lancashire and about Lancastrians in Australia. Mike Harding (b. 1944), songwriter, poet, and performer was born in Crumpsall, but is known as ‘The Rochdale Cowboy’.\n\nROSSALL Among former pupils of Rossall is Leslie Charteris [pseud.] (1907–1993), writer, who was born Leslie Charles Bowyer Yin in Singapore, the son of a wealthy Chinese surgeon, and Lydia Bowyer (1876–1953). In 1919, Yin and his mother went to England, where he attended Rossall School His most famous fictional character was Simon Templar, ‘the Saint’.\n\nSALFORD Rather unfairly, Salford often gets subsumed into Manchester. However, it has such a highly distinguished cast, particularly of twentieth century literary giants that it deserves to be treated separately. For example both the novelist Walter Greenwood (Love on the Dole) and the dramatist Shelagh Delaney (A Taste of Honey) were born in, and wrote about, Salford. John Byrom (1692-1763), comic poet and creator of a system of shorthand, was born at Kersal Cell, Broughton, now in Salford. It is said that he wrote the hymn “Christians Awake” there, but it is more likely that it was written at the Old Wellington Inn in Manchester’s old market place. Byrom was educated at Merchant Taylor’s and Trinity College, Cambridge. He also studied medicine in Montpellier and, later, was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was an ardent Jacobite and wrote:\n\nGod bless the King! I mean the Faith’s Defender.\n\nGod bless—no harm in blessing—the Pretender!\n\nBut who Pretender is, or who is King,\n\nGod bless us all, that’s quite another thing.\n\nIn later life Byrom retired to Stockport. George MacDonald (1824 –1905), novelist and poet, was born in Scotland, but trained as a congregational minister in England. From 1854 he stayed at 3, Camp Terrace, Lower Broughton. In 1857 he took a room in Renshaw Street, Eccles and in 1858 his first major book appeared. His fantastic fiction includes At the Back of the North Wind (1871) and Lilith (1895). Mary Louisa Armitt (1851–1911), author and founder of the Armitt Library, Ambleside, was born at 19 Melbourne Terrace, Salford. She was the youngest of three daughters all three becoming versatile writers. Initially they attended Islington House Academy; later Mary studied music at Manchester Mechanics’ Institute.\n\nHarold Brighouse (1882–1958), playwright and novelist, was born at Inglewood, 25 Ellesmere Avenue, Eccles. He was educated at Clarendon Road School, Eccles before winning a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School. In 1900 he attended a season of plays by F. R. Benson’s company at Manchester’s Royal Theatre, which kindled his interest in drama. His best-known play was Hobson’s Choice (1916) set in Salford, the tale of a rebellious daughter. There was a 1953 film by David Lean. Brighouse was part of the group known as the Manchester School of Dramatists.\n\nWalter Greenwood (1903-1974), novelist and screenwriter was born in Ellor Street, Salford He is best known for the book Love on the Dole (1932) which detailed the plight of the Lancashire poor during the depression. It was turned into a successful play [see Accrington] and a film, made in 1941, starring Deborah Kerr. Greenwood wrote further socially-conscious novels which never quite matched the success of his earlier work. Alistair Cooke (1908–2004), broadcaster and writer, was born at 7 Isaac Street, Salford, but when Cooke was eight the family moved to Blackpool.\n\nEwan MacColl (1915–1989), songwriter, folk-singer, and playwright, was born at 4 Andrew Street, Broughton. Ewan MacColl (best known for “Dirty Old Town” and “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face”), attended North Grecian Street Primary School. There is a plaque:\n\nEwan MacColl 1915 – 1989, Working Class Movement Library\n\nMarxist, Singer songmaker and dramatist lived in this neighbourhood.\n\nShelagh Delaney (1938-2011), playwright, was born in Salford of Irish descent. She attended Pendleton High School, where she was actively encouraged to write by an enlightened headmistress. Her writing was steeped in her childhood experiences of life in the industrial north-west of England, and her roots were to provide the background to many of her most celebrated plays and novels. Perhaps her most famous is her debut work, A Taste of Honey (1958), set in 1950s Salford. There was a film in 1961. There is a plaque at 77 Duchy Road:\n\nThe childhood home of Shelagh Delaney celebrated writer, proud Salfordian and cherished daughter, mother and grandma. 25.11.1938 – 20.11.2011\n\nMike Leigh (b. 1943), playwright and film director, was brought up in Higher Broughton, Salford. He is a director and writer, known for Secrets & Lies (1996), and Vera Drake (2004). Leigh was the son of Alfred Leigh, originally Lieberman, eventually a general practitioner in Higher Broughton, “the epicentre of Leigh’s youngest years” and the area closely remembered in his television film Hard Labour (1973). The film is clearly drawn from Higher and Lower Broughton where he grew up., indeed one of the scenes was shot in a house just two doors along from where the Leighs had lived in Cavendish Road. John Cooper Clarke (b.1949), performance poet, is from Higher Broughton. On his website he recalls Salford:\n\nI’m from Higher Broughton, on the corner of Bury New Road and Great Cheetham Street East, opposite the Rialto picture house, and I used to go there loads. We lived above a chemist’s called Friedman’s and that corner was a really happening place actually. Potter’s Club was there where all the North West snooker players used to go. It was open 24 hours and if you were a member you got a key so you could knock about there for as long as you wanted. It’s where John Virgo, Alex Higgins and John Spencer used to practise their shots.\n\nSILVERDALE Elizabeth Glaskell (1810-65) Victorian novelist, was author of Wives and Daughters, Cranford, and other novels. She was married to a Manchester businessman and spent much of her time in Lancashire [see MANCHESTER]. She often went with her daughters to Silverdale, where some of her books were written, in Lindeth (or Gibraltar) Tower, a summer house in the grounds of the farm where they stayed. In 1858 she wrote to a friend:\n\n“We are going to Silverdale, close to Lancaster Sands and Morecambe Bay, and there we shall remain for six weeks, all get as strong as horses….. The house is covered with roses, and great white Virgin-sceptred lilies and sweetbriar bushes grow in the small flagged square court. At the end of the garden is a high terrace at the top of the broad stone wall, looking down on the Bay…”\n\nSome Elizabeth Gaskell followers believe that she based her novel ‘Cranford’ on the nearby town of Carnforth, but this is highly unlikely.\n\nGordon Bottomley (1874–1948), poet and playwright, was born in Yorkshire, and was an invalid for much of his life. Apart from his writing and a little travelling, his life was uneventful. He devoted himself to the arts, and even when his name was well known he was reclusive. In 1905 he married Emily Burton. Their picturesque home, The Sheiling, in Silverdale was originally built by Mrs. Gaskell’s daughters. It was celebrated by Edward Thomas (1878-1917) in a poem, composed when he visited Bottomley on his way to the front early in the Great War. Bottomley’s work often involved his Scottish roots, for example, his play Gruach was a prequel to Macbeth.\n\nSOUTHPORT Nathaniel (Nat) Gould (1857-1919), sporting novelist, was born at 127 York Street, Cheetham, Manchester, but educated in Southport. His novels were generally set in Australia whence he moved aged about twenty seven. Elsie Jeanette Dunkerley [Elsie Oxenham] (1880–1960), author of children’s books whose father was also a novelist lived in Southport. Lucy Maria Boston (1892–1990), writer, was born on 10 December 1892 at 8 Scarisbrick Street, Southport. She was educated at local schools in Southport and Arnside. She later lived in a fine house at Hemingford Grey, Cambridgeshire. Her children’s books included the Green Knowe series of stories. Much mocked Mary Webb [née Meredith], (1881–1927), novelist and poet, went to finishing school in Southport. However, Southport’s most striking literary personage was Michael Arlen (1895–1956), novelist. He was of Armenian extraction and was born in Rustchuk, Bulgaria. In 1924 came The Green Hat, a bestselling novel which was highly acclaimed. It epitomised glittering nineteen twenties. Arlen went to Hollywood and, among other things created “The Falcon” and wrote storylines for films starring Greta Garbo and Bette Davis.\n\nSTALYBRIDGE Benjamin Disraeli used Stalybridge in Coningsby. At about the same time Friedrich Engels (1820 – 1895), political scientist, published The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845), based on personal observations of factory towns in and around Manchester, used Stalybridge аs аn example:\n\n… multitudes оf courts, back lanes, and remote nooks arise оut оf [the] confused wаy of building … Add to thіs the shocking filth, and the repulsive effect of Stalybridge, in spite of its pretty surroundings, may be readily imagined.\n\nThe children’s author Beatrix Potter (1866–1943), the author and illustrator of the Peter Rabbit books, visited Gorse Hall many times as a child which was built by her maternal grandparents. There is a Blue Plaque to commemorate this. During the industrial revolution two local poets came to work in Stalybridge from elsewhere. John Jones (1788–1858), poet, known as ‘the Welsh Bard’ as he was born in Wales, came to Stalybridge and was popular there. He was buried next to the Wesleyan chapel, at Grosvenor Square where there is a memorial tablet. Nearby at Hob Hill Mews a plaque recollects Samuel Laycock (1826-1893):\n\nA dialect poet whose work presents a vivid impression of mid-nineteenth century working class life. He drew on his personal experience in the cotton industry. He came to Stalybridge aged eleven. He was the librarian at the Mechanics Institute from 1865 until 1871.\n\nLaycock published two books, Lancashire Rhymes (1864) and Lancashire Songs (1866). These poems record the everyday life of cotton workers.\n\nSTOCKPORT Ronald Gow (1897–1993), playwright, born in Heaton Moor Stockport, is best known for his play Love on the Dole (1934) based on Walter Greenwood’s novel about unemployment in Salford during the Great Depression. He lived in Altrincham, attending and later teaching at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys. Wendy Hiller played the lead in the play and, in 1937, Gow and Hiller married. He wrote much material for her later work on stage and in film. Christopher Isherwood (1904–86), novelist, had his family home at Marple Hall, though he was born at nearby Wybersley Hall. He was the author of Mr Norris Changes Trains (1935) and Goodbye to Berlin (1939)\n\nSTONYHURST Stonyhurst School near Clitheroe in the Ribble Valley has inspired poets and authors who include a former classics teacher Gerard Manley Hopkins, some of whose poems feature details of the local countryside.\n\nRibblesdale\n\nGerard Manley Hopkins\n\nEarth, sweet Earth, sweet landscape, with leav’s throng\n\nAnd louch’d low grass, heaven that dost appeal\n\nTo, with no tongue to plead, no heart to feel;\n\nThat canst but only be, but dost that long–\n\nThou canst but be, but that thou well dost; strong\n\nThy plea with him who dealt, nay does now deal,\n\nThy lovely dale down thus and thus bids reel\n\nThy river, and o’er gives all to rack or wrong.\n\nAnd what is Earth’s eye, tongue, or heart else, where\n\nElse, but in dear and dogged man?–Ah, the heir\n\nTo his own selfbent so bound, so tied to his turn,\n\nTo thriftless reave both our rich round world bare\n\nAnd none reck of world after, this bids wear\n\nEarth brows of such care, care and dear concern.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, who named Sherlock Holmes’ nemesis, Moriarty, after a fellow pupil, attended the preparatory school and then the senior school, from 1868 to 1875. The school grounds in the Ribble valley later reappeared in his fiction, notably “Baskerville Hall” which was modelled on Stonyhurst, the yew walk, the observatory, and the mists were transferred to Dartmoor in The Hound of the Baskervilles. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote part of The Lord of the Rings in a classroom during his stay at the college where his son taught Classics; his “Middle-earth” is said to resemble the locality. John Cunliffe (b. 1933), children’s book author who created the characters of Postman Pat and Rosie and Jim, attended Stonyhurst.\n\nAlfred Austin DL (1835 – 1913) also attended Stonyhurst. He was an English poet who was appointed Poet Laureate in 1896 on the death of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Oliver St John Gogarty (1878–1957), Irish poet, writer and wit, was educated at Stonyhurst, as was Wilfrid Scawen Blunt (1840–1922), poet.\n\nWIGAN John Critchley Prince (1808–1866) was an English poet born at Wigan. Prince was the son of a poor reed-maker for weavers. He learned to read and write at a Baptist Sunday school and became addicted to poetry. He published several books of his own verses which were well received. Prince died at Hyde in 1866. James Hilton (1900 – 1954) author of Goodbye Mr Chips and Lost Horizon, was born was born in 26 Twist Lane, off Wilkinson Street in Leigh, and was buried at St. George’s Church there. He went on to win an Academy Award for his screenplay for Mrs Miniver, which starred Greer Garson. Other award winning films based on his novels included ‘Half a Sixpence‘ (later made into a musical starring Tommy Steele) and ‘Random Harvest’. By this time a successful author, script and screen writer, he had moved to live in Hollywood in California. A blue plaque has been fastened to the wall of 26 Wilkinson Street where James Hilton was born on September 9, 1900.\n\nGeorge Orwell (1903-1950) wrote the memorably entitled The Road to Wigan Pier, first published in 1937. It is about the wretched conditions of the working class in the North of England at the time. He travelled widely in the North but it is in Wilton Street, Wigan that there is a plaque:\n\nThe writer George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair in 1903, received national acclaim for the books he wrote between 1920 and 1950 describing living conditions in Britain and abroad. He is known to have stayed nearby in Darlington Street and Warrington Lane in February, 1936, and afterwards published his well-known book “The Road To Wigan Pier”\n\nWYCOLLAR The picturesque, secluded hamlet of Wycoller, close to Colne and near the Yorkshire border, has been a source of inspiration for writers. It is thought that Charlotte Bronte fashioned ‘Ferndean Manor’ in the novel Jane Eyre after the deserted Wycoller Hall, a 16th century country house in the village, which is now in ruins.\n\nStrathard\n\nFrom Aberfoyle Leave by B829 to Inversnaid by Milton-of-Aberfoyle. There is a good general description of the Trossachs in E.A.Baker‘s Scottish Highlands. Interestingly, he regards Aberfoyle as their focal point:\n\nWhat was called Rob Roy’s or the MacGregor’s Country is the hilly region, difficult at that time with streams, marshes, lochans, and the absence of roads, the no-man’s land on the far side of Ben Lomond, the one habitable place in which was the hamlet of Aberfoyle. What romantic reader has not dreamed himself into the skin of Frank Osbaldistone, and gone with Bailie Nichol Jarvie on that journey from Glasgow into the fastnesses where Rob Roy bade his enemies defiance? Aberfoyle is now a most respectable place; a good hotel represents the tavern where Mr Jarvie fought the Highlandman with the red-hot coulter of a plough, and there are villas and boarding-houses where visitors from Glasgow and Edinburgh come and rusticate.\n\nQueen Victoria‘s description of her journey up Strathard, which is here fringed with meadowlands and called, on that account, the Laggan, is as follows:\n\nHere the splendid scenery begins – high rugged and green hills(reminding me again of Pilatus), very fine large trees and beautiful pink heather, interspersed with bracken, rocks and underwood in the most lovely profusion and Ben Lomond towering up before us with its noble range. We went on perhaps a quarter of a mile, and it being then two o’ clock, we got out and lunched on the grass under an oak tree at the foot of Craigmore. It was very hot, the sun stinging, but there were many lightwhite clouds in the blue sky, which gave the most beautiful effects of light and shade on this most marvellous colouring.\n\nIn Rob Roy Scott describes the inn at the Milton-of-Aberfoyle as follows:\n\nAbout half a mile’s riding, after we crossed the bridge, placed us at the door of the public house where we were to pass the evening. It was a hovel rather worse than better than that in which we had dined; but its little windows were lighted up, voices were heard from within, and all intimated the prospect of food and shelter, to which we were by no means indifferent.\n\nThe inn, ‘Jean MacAlpine’s Inn’, is the scene of perhaps the most famous incident in Rob Roy, the ‘Fray at the Clachan’. Frank Osbaldistone, who relates the occurrence, and his companions, including Bailie Nichol Jarvie, are engaged in a brawl with a gang of Highlanders:\n\nI put myself in a posture of defence, and, aware of the superiority of my weapon, a rapier or small sword, was little afraid of the outcome of the contest. The Bailie behaved with unexpected mettle: as he saw the gigantic Highlander about to confront him with his weapon drawn, he tugged for a second or two at the hilt of his shabble as he called it; but finding it loth to quit the sheath, to which it had long been secured by rust and disuse, he siezed, as a substitute, on the red hot coulter of a plough, which had been employed arranging the fire by way of a poker, and brandished it with such effect, that at the first pass he set the Highlander’s plaid on fire, and compelled him to keep a respectful distance, till he could get it extinguished. Andrew Fairservice, who ought to have faced the Lowland champion, vanished at the very commencement of the fray; but his antagonist, crying “fair play!” seemed courteously disposed to take no share in the scuffle. Osbaldistone’s aim was to possess himself of his antagonist’s weapon, but he declined from closing with him through fear of a dirk which he held in his left hand. The Bailie, notwithstanding the success of his first onset, was sorely bested. The weight of his weapon, the corpulence of his person, the very effervescence of his own passion, were rapidly exhausting his strength and his breath, and he was almost at the mercy of his antagonist when up started the sleeping Highlander, with his naked sword and target in his hand, and threw himself between the discomfited magistrate and his assailant, exclaiming, “her nainsell has eaten the town bread at the cross o’ Glasgow, and by her troth sh’ll fight for Bailie Sharvie at the clachan of Aberfoil.\n\nWalter Scott Rob Roy\n\nThe incident was depicted on the inn sign at the Bailie Nichol Jarvie Hotel in the village and, opposite the hotel, attached to the stout oak tree, the supposed ‘coulter’, often renewed, can be seen. This has led thousands of visitors to suppose that the affray took place there, but Scott undoubtedly set it at the Milton where a few stones behind the cottage at the foot of the Pass of Aberfoyle were, at one time, all that was left of the highland residence which was for long known as ‘Jean MacAlpine’s Inn’. The cottage has now been lovingly restored and thatched.\n\nAt the Milton there is another bridge over the infant Forth which tumbles in great style from Loch Ard to the Laggan. Just below the Milton this river, which is called the Avon Dow, joins the Duchary to form the Forth proper:\n\nThe Duchary, which is one of the parent streams of the Forth, takes its rise on the north-east shoulder of Ben Lomond, not much more than half a mile south of Loch Arklet, and for five or six miles flows in a south easterly direction through a wild and dreary and solitary valley. About half way from its source to its junction with the stream from Loch Ard it forms one of the wildest cataracts, with the exception of Foyers, I think I have ever seen. The stream here bounds over an overhanging precipice of great height into an extraordinary basin formed in the solid rock, well known in the district as ‘The Big Linn’.\n\nMalcolm Ferguson Tour Through the Highlands of Perthshire 1870\n\nThis waterfall is the Black Linn of Blairvaich. It is a fine fall, and it was used, very effectively, in a scene in the Richard Todd film of Rob Roy. It can be reached from the Milton, or from Kinlochard. Rather closer at hand is Craigmuick Cottage associated with William Glen (1789-1826) Scottish poet, and singularly unsuccessful businessman in the West Indian trade. He was author of Wae’s Me For Prince Charlie, and other lyrics, and was born and died in Glasgow. He married Mary MacFarlane of Aberfoyle, and spent the summers of the last eight years of his life at Craigie Cottage[Craigmuick Cottage] which is situated in the Loch Ard Forest. There is a relief of a small bird in the wall of the cottage commemorating Glen’s most famous poem. He also wrote the poem Mary, of Sweet Aberfoyle, about his wife when he was in the West Indies:\n\nThe sun hadna peeped frae behind the dark billow,:\n\nThe slow-sinking moon half illumined the scene,\n\nAs I lifted my head frae my care-hunted pillow,\n\nAn’ wandered to muse on the days that were gane.\n\nSweet hope seemed to smile o’er ideas romantic,\n\nAn’ gay were the dreams that my soul would beguile,\n\nBut my eyes filled wi’ tears as I viewed the Atlantic,\n\nAn’ thought on my Mary of sweet Aberfoyle\n\nThough far frae my hame in a tropical wild wood,\n\nYet the fields o’ my forefathers rose on my view;\n\nAn’ I wept when I thought on the days of my childhood,\n\nAn’ the vision was painful the brighter it grew.\n\nSweet days! when my bosom with rapture was swelling,\n\nThough I knew it not then, it was love made me smile,\n\nOh! the snow wreath is pure when the moonbeams are\n\ndwelling,\n\nYet as pure is my Mary of sweet Aberfoyle.\n\nGlen’s most famous poem is about the Young Pretender. Birds were used in songs like this to mean Jacobites. The poem was a favourite with Queen Victoria. It begins as follows:\n\nA wee bird cam to oor ha’ door,\n\nHe warbled sweet and clearly,\n\nAnd aye the owre-come o’ his sang\n\nWas ‘Wae’s me for Prince Charlie!’\n\nOh! when I heard the bonnie, bonnie bird\n\nThe tears cam drappin rarely,\n\nI took my bonnet aff my head,\n\nFor weel I lo’ed Prince Charlie.\n\nThese sights can be reached by walks from the Car Park in the Lochard Forest at the Milton.\n\nLoch Ard\n\nFrom the Milton the road climbs a short hill which forms the beginning of the Pass of Aberfoyle. Queen’s View, Loch Ard is the viewpoint where the Loch comes into sight. The road [B829] mainly by the lochside to Ledard. In discussing Scott’s literary techniques Coleman Parsons (1905-1991) , for long a significant authority on Scottish Literture, points out the way in which the author uses changes in the landscape to quicken the interest in the story. One such boundary is about to be crossed at the Pass of Aberfoyle, the narrow road which leads from the Milton to Loch Ard:\n\nScott is at his best in conveying awe, suspense, mystery, and personal feeling through nature. When Edward Waverley or Frank Osbaldistone penetrate the Highlands interest quickens. Entering Highland passes, caves, glens, and recesses is like slipping from the conscious into the unconscious, womblike, enfolding, dream freighted, or from the illusion of free will into the substance of fate. A border is also being crossed between what is and what might be, reality and romance, between selfish causes and lost causes, the calculating present and the impulsive past. This excitement and tension may be due to a symbolic re-enactment by Scott of his own crossing of the border between youth and manhood, fancy and sober control. Because renewed choice is renewal of possibility, to go back is a way of briefly recapturing what is lost.\n\nColeman Parsons Witchcraft and Demonology in Scott’s Fiction 1964\n\nOn the morning following the affray described above, Osbaldistone and his companions enter the Highlands by this route and very soon have a dramatic, if unreal, encounter with Helen MacGregor. Scott describes the scene, ‘such a scene of natural romance and beauty as had never before greeted my eyes’:\n\nTo the left lay the valley, down which the Forth wandered on its easterly course surrounding the beautiful detached hill, with all its garland of woods. On the right, amid a profusion of thickets, knolls and crags, lay the bend of a broad mountain lake, lightly curled into tiny waves by the breath of the morning breeze, each glittering in its courseunder the morning sunbeams. High hills, rocks, and banks, waving with natural forests of birch and oak, formed the borders of this enchanting sheet of water; and as their leaves rustled to the wind and twinkled in the sun, gave to the depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity. Man alone seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority, in a scene where all the ordinary features of nature were raised and exalted.”\n\nSir Walter Scott Rob Roy\n\nQueen Victoria is equally enthusiastic:\n\nAfter luncheon and walking about a little, not finding any good views to sketch, we got into the carriage (our horses had been changed), but had not gone above a few yards when we came upon Loch Ard, and a lovelier picture could not be seen. Ben Lomond, blue and yellow, rose above the lower hills, which were pink and purple with heather, and an isthmus of green trees in front dividing it from the rest of the loch. We got out and sketched.\n\nQueen Victoria Journal 1869\n\nLoch Ard is generally regarded as one of the most attractive of Scotland’s smaller lochs.\n\nFor picturesque effect it has justly been said to exceed almost all the Scottish Lakes.\n\nCharles Roger A Week at the Bridge of Allan 1851\n\n.\n\nThe best view of Loch Ard is that first encountered from Aberfoyle, the Queen’s View, so-called because Queen Victoria executed some sketches there when she visited Aberfoyle while she was staying at Invertrossachs in 1869. After making the sketches at the Queen’s View her account continues:\n\nWe then drove on, and certainly one of the most lovely drives I can remember, along Loch Ard, a fine long loch, with trees of all kinds overhanging the road, heather making all pink; bracken, rocks, high hills of such fine shape and trees growing up them as in Switzerland; the road rough and bad, with very steep bits of hill (but the post-horses went remarkably well) overhanging the loch, which reminded me very much of the drive along Loch Zug in Switzerland.\n\nA short distance beyond the Queen’s View the road climbs away from the loch to traverse a wood, situated above ‘The Narrows’, a strait which joins the two parts of the loch. It descends to the loch shore beside a steep cliff. Scott’s description of the road is faithful to the topography:\n\nOur route, though leading towards the lake, had hitherto been so much shaded by wood, that we only from time to time obtained a glimpse of that beautiful sheet of water. But the road now suddenly emerged from the forest ground, and winding close by the margin of the loch, afforded us a full view of its spacious mirror, which now, the breeze havingtotally subsided, reflected in still magnificence the high dark heathy mountains, huge grey rocks, and shaggy banks by which it is encircled. The hills now sunk on its margin so closely, and were so broken and precipitous, as to afford no passage except just upon the narrow line of the track which we occupied, and which was overhung with rocks, from which we might have been destroyed merely by rolling down stones, without much possibility of offering resistance. Add to this, that, as the road winded round every promontory and bay which indented the lake, there was rare;ly a possibility of seeing a hundred yards before us.\n\nIt was the stretch of country where Scott set the first memorable encounter in Rob Roy with Helen MacGregor. In the resulting skirmish Bailie Nichol Jarvie is suspended from a tree on one cliff, and Helen orders their guide to be thrown into the loch from another. The Bailie’s Rock is the one beside the road:\n\nThe Bailie, to whom fear had given a temporary share of agility, had ascended about twenty feet from the path, when his foot slipping, as he straddled from one huge rock to another, he would have slumbered with his father the deacon, whose acts and words he was so fond of quoting, but for a projecting branch of ragged thorn, which, catching hold of the skirts of his riding coat, supported him in mid air, where he dangled not unlike to the sign of the Golden Fleece over the door of a mercer in the Trongate of his native city.\n\nRob Roy so captured the imagination that it was successfully adapted for the stage as early as 1818, and used as the basis of the libretto for at least two operas. There can be no better illustration of the quality of some of these adaptations, and of the grasp that the average foreigner had and still has of Scottish history than the following plot summary of Act II of De Koven’s light opera, an ancestor of Brigadoon, first performed in New York in 1894:\n\nThe Highlanders led by Rob Roy are posted to guard a mountain pass. The Battle of Culloden is in progress and the Scotch expect a great victory. After a song by Janet, bag-pipes are heard in the distance. The Highlanders at first think it is a signal of victory, but presently they recognise the song of defeat, the coronach. The Scotch, led by the Prince and Locheil return wounded and defeated. a chorus declaring allegiance follows. A reward is offered for the Prince who, disguised as a peasant is sheltered by the MacGregors in their mountain retreat. The Provost and his henchmen appear as wandering ballad-mongers, having fled before the battle. They are still in highland dress, not having heard of the rout of the Scotch. Sandy MacSherry arrives and informs the Provost of the English victory, and the Provost, changing Highland kilt for English uniform, becomes an Englishman. He determines to obtain the reward offered for the Prince, and the at is mainly devoted to his his efforts toward this end and his sudden change of nationality according to the fortunes of war. At length the English capture the prince in the dress of a miller’s boy and are about to lead him away when Flora is led away by the English soldiers in spite of efforts made to rescue her by the Prince, Rob Roy and their followers.\n\nPatrick Graham, Minister of Aberfoyle, already referred to published his early account of the District in 1806 in his Sketches of Perthshire. It is the source of many subsequent accounts. For example, it was Graham who first described, long before the publication of Rob Roy, the echo at what subsequently became known as the ‘The Bailie’s Rock’:\n\nImmediately under this rock, near its western extremity, is a remarkable echo. In a calm day, a line of ten syllables, uttered with a firm voice, is distinctly repeated across the lake, and again repeated by the woods on the east.\n\nIn a preface Graham relates how he first put the description together in 1792 for a visit by Joseph Farington (1747-1821), one of the most influential artists of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, who was engaged in making some sketches of the Forth for what proved to be an abortive publication. Farington commented:\n\nA stranger must feel himself uncommonly struck on meeting, at the very back of Ben Lomond, in a spot so sequestered as to be almost unknown to the world, a scene like the present; an extensive sheet of water, skirted with woods and cultivated fields, and accompanied with every object essential to picturesque beauty; the whole grouped and diversified in a style of harmony which may be thought by some to rival the scenes presented by the Cumberland lakes.\n\nIt was Farington who advised Turner about his early visits to Scotland in 1797 and 1801, but the great man did not visit Loch Ard until 1831. Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1857) is generally regarded as Britain’s greatest landscape painter. Unlike Loch Katrine, Loch Ard did not produce any famous finished works, but his ‘Loch Ard Sketch Book’ contains notable drawings of Aberfoyle, Craigmore, the Queen’s View and Loch Ard. In their way they are quite as impressive as his drawings of other parts of the Trossachs. Turner was visiting the district with a view to illustrating Scott’s Poetical Works and outlined his plans to Scott, who offered him a pony for the duration of his visit, as follows:\n\nTherefore, do pray say how long do you think it will take me to collect the materials in your neighbourhood. Many are near but my bad horsemanship puts your kind offer of a pony, I fear, out of the account in shortening the time, and when I get as far as Loch Katrine shall not like to turn back without Staffa, Mull and all. A steamboat is now established to the Western Isles, so I have heard lately, and therefore much of the difficulty becomes removed, but being wholly unacquainted with the distance I will thank you to say what time will be absolutely wanting.\n\nJ.M.W.Turner April 1931\n\nTurner, not wanting to opt for pony trekking, opted for ‘public transport’ and was almost certainly following one of the formal ‘Trossachs Tours’. Farington’s comparison with the English Lake District is frequently echoed by later writers. Such parallels owe their origin to Thomas Gray and William Gilpin who, along with Boswell and Johnson, were amongst the first travellers to visit Scotland in the eighteenth century which, at the time, was far less well known than places on the\n\nContinent visited during the course of the ‘Grand Tour’. The Lake District had already been ‘discovered’, and the comparison was natural enough, although it tends to aggravate many Scots. The Wordsworths were by far the most prone to draw these parallels, and they were almost always to the disadvantage of the Scottish countryside. William Wordsworth visited Loch Ard and Loch Chon in 1814 in company with Mary Wordsworth and Sarah Hutchinson. The latter’s journal describes the\n\ndistrict:\n\nFrom Luss on Sunday morning we went to breakfast at Drymen and attended the kirk where there was an excellent preacher – this was a sweet drive by the side of Loch Lomond and then across an excessive, rich, and well cultivated strata just like English Parks, well wooded, and surrounded by all the magnificent hills of Scotland – the Duke of Montrose’s property – from Drymen to Aberfoyle where we spent the night and the next forenoon viewing Loch Ard and Loch Chon above Aberfoyle,\n\nand then we met with a friendly Highlander who went with us; he lived in an abject house but was a Gentleman and his wife a Lady – we passed also another highland farm where the genteel appearance of the inhabitants surprised us; for you can have no idea of the deep solitude of these places – but they go many miles to kirk – and during the interval of morning and afternoon service those who have not friends near, almost all the congregation indeed, sit in the churchyard. From Aberfoyle we passed a sweet lake in a vale – which hilly scene is called Menteith – with two islands, upon which are five ruins – and here we saw Stirling Castle at a great distance – the walls brightened by the setting sun – slept at Callander and went to the Trossachs where we were drenched.\n\nSarah Hutchinson Letter 3rd Aug 1814\n\nJames Sheridan Knowles (1784-1862), the nineteenth century actor-manager and playwright, frequently stayed at the residence of Robert Dick, Lochard Lodge, which is now Altskeith. In the summer vacation reading parties from the universities came to Loch Ard as well as to other Highland resorts. Charles Lloyd (1824-1862) from Christ Church, Oxford spent several summers at Loch Ard with reading parties, and was visited there by other literary lights, including John Campbell Shairp (1819-85) and Arthur Hugh Clough (1819-61):\n\nOn Thursday we passed through Glen Croe – descended on the fine salt Loch Long, crossed the four miles intervening miles and found ourselves on Loch Lomond – six or seven miles from its head. We went up it about three miles on a steamer ‘to the rough falls of Inversnaid’ crossed a high moor of five miles and found ourselves at the head of Loch Katrine – rowed twelve miles down and were landed in the Trossachs.\n\nOn Friday, Edward and Oliver went off to Perth, Tom and I crossed the hills to Loch Ard where a Christ Church man named Lloyd is staying with a pupil, and I went up the lake and there took a pony and joined them by a roundabout way, passing a very beautiful water called Loch Chon. I came back and slept at Inversnaid; they remained behind and attended a Highland reel party in a shoemaker’s hut at Loch Ard and after staying up dancing and drinking milk and whisky till half-past-two, rose at half-past-four, walked 11 miles to a hasty breakfast with, or rather after me and then took steam down to the foot of Loch Lomond, and so by Dumbarton we came home, dirty and dusty and bankrupt.\n\nLoch Katrine and Loch Lomond are both like Ullswater, the former less beautiful, the latter, I think more so. Both are less cultivated; Loch Katrine quite cold, and the little land-locked lakelet at its foot cut off by Lady’s Island and one or two promontories is exceedingly beautiful – the heather is also a great accession throughout the Highlands.\n\nArthur Hugh Clough Letters August 1845\n\nClough, who wrote poems set in the Highlands and in the Lake District, was with Lloyd and others at Drumnadrochit in 1845, and he returned to Loch Ard in 1846. Prodigious walks often before breakfast, like that described in the above letter, were characteristic of Clough. In 1846 on a day trip, we learn from his diary, he crossed from the Trossachs by Loch Drunkie to Aberfoyle, went to Loch Ard and then climbed Ben Venue descending to Loch Achray.\n\nA good descriptive piece about Loch Ard occurs in Cunninghame Graham‘s introduction to Kirk’s Secret Commonwealth (1933):\n\nStanding up sentinel above Loch Chon, Ben Lomond with the shadows of evening creeping up its flanks, to join the fleecy clouds that mantle round its top looms as gigantic as Aconcagua or Purac. It seems to watch over the whole district and to dominate it. No sound is heard, except the babbling of the mountain streams as they slip down over the smooth stones, or the sharp belling of a roe in the thick alder copsewood that surrounds Loch Ard. The little wavelets break upon the pebbly beaches, or plash gently on the rocks of the steep islet on which Duke Murdoch’s ruined Castle stands. In Couligarten Bay, the bullrushes bend gently, as the homing wild duck squatter down noiselessly amongst their stems, vanishing as silently as a seal slips into the sea. The lime trees on the point below the mansion of Alt Skeigh look dark and menacing, as the light fades gradually, blotting out the little pier, the beach, the high road, and the ground they stand upon, leaving their tops suspended in the air.\n\nThe lochside road clings to the very edge of the water in places until, at the head of it, there is a stretch of rather more open country where former country houses are occupied by the Youth Hostel, and the Forest Hills complex. At the end of this stretch is the seventeenth century farmhouse of Ledard. In 1821 Percy York, a student, published an account of a memorable visit to Ledard in Three Nights in Perthshire. Ledard is associated with Scott who used the waterfall behind the house in both Waverley and Rob Roy.\n\nI am sure you will be gratified by the scenery which time cannot make any impression upon. Pray do not omit to visit the head of Loch Awe, which I look upon as equal to anything in the Highlands. There is some curious scenery near Aberfoyle, in Perthshire, particularly a waterfall at Ledard, at the top of Loch Ard, within an hour’s walk of the inn, which from its size and accompaniments, I should think particularly qualified to fill up a Highland landscape. I never saw any thing which I admired so much: the height is not remarkable, but the accompaniments are exquisitely beautiful. In a different style, and at no great distance is an island called Inchmahome which has some ruins of a monastery surrounded by huge chestnut trees, very striking, though looking of no importance from the shore.\n\nSir Walter Scott Letter to David Wilkie 1817\n\nImmediately above the farmhouse of Ledard, and near the west end of the lake, is to be seen a cascade, which the traveller will do well to visit. The stream, which is considerable, falls in one sheet, over a height of ten or twelve feet, into a beautiful basin, formed of the solid rock, and so transparent, that, at the depth of ten feet the smallest pebble may be seen. From this basin, dashing over a ledge of rock, it precipitates itself again over an irregular shape of more than fifty feet, finely skirted with wood\n\nPatrick Graham Sketches of Perthshire 1806\n\nThe rocks now receded, but still showed their grey and shaggy crests rising among the copsewood. Still higher rose eminences and peaks, some bare, some clothed with wood, some round and purple with heath, and others splintered into rocks and crags. At a short turning, the path, which had for some furlongs lost sight of the brook, suddenly placed Waverley in front of a romantic waterfall. It was not so remarkable for either its great height or quantity of water, as for the beautiful accompaniments which made the spot interesting. After a broken cataract of about twenty feet, the stream was received in a large natural basin filled to the brim with water, which, where the bubbles of the fall subsided, was so exquisitely clear, that although it was of great depth, the eye could discern each pebble at the bottom. Eddying round this reservoir, the brook found its way as if over a broken part of the ledge, and formed a second fall, which seemed to seek the very abyss; then wheeling out beneath from among the smooth dark rocks, which it had polished for ages, it wandered down the glen forming the stream up which Waverley had just ascended.\n\nSir Walter Scott Waverley 1814\n\nAt this point in the narrative Scott appends a note: ‘The description of the waterfall mentioned in this chapter is taken from that of Ledard, at the farm so called on the northern side of Loch Ard, and near the head of the lake, four or five miles from Aberfoyle. It is upon a small scale, but otherwise one of the most exquisite cascades it is possible to behold.’ There can be little doubt that Scott’s description was influenced by Graham’s; indeed one can suppose that Graham introduced him to the place. It is at the waterfall that Waverley encounters Flora MacIvor, who says, “I have given you the trouble of walking to this spot, Captain Waverley, both because I thought the scenery would interest you, and because a Highland song would suffer still more from my imperfect translation, were I to introduce it without its own wild and appropriate accompaniments.” The song is another of Scott’s splendid incantatory romps through Scottish land names, reminiscent of The MacGregors Gathering :\n\nThere is mist on the mountain, and night on the vale\n\nBut more dark is the sleep of the sons of the Gael.\n\nA stranger commanded – it sunk on the land,\n\nIt has frozen each heart, and benumb’d every hand!\n\nThe dirk and the target lie sordid with dust,\n\nThe bloodless claymore is but redden’d with rust;\n\nOn the hill or the glen if a gun should appear,\n\nIt is only to war with the heath-cock or deer.\n\nThe deeds of our sires if our bards should rehearse,\n\nLet a blush or a blow be the meed of their verse!\n\nBe mute every string, and be hushed every tone,\n\nThat shall bid us remember the fame that is flown.\n\nBut the dark hours of night and of slumber are past,\n\nThe morn on our mountains is dawning at last;\n\nGlenaladale’s peaks are illumined with the rays,\n\nAnd the streams of Glenfinnan leap bright in the blaze.\n\nO high-minded Moray! – the exiled – the dear !\n\nIn the blush of the dawning the standard uprear!\n\nWide, wide on the winds of the north let it fly,\n\nLike the sun’s latest flash when the tempest is nigh!\n\nYe sons of the strong, when that dawning shall break,\n\nNeed the harp of the aged remind you to wake?\n\nThat dawn never beam’d on your forefathers’ eye,\n\nBut it roused each high chieftain to vanquish or die.\n\nO, sprung from the Kings who in Islay kept state,\n\nProud chiefs of Clan Ranald, Glengarry and Sleat!\n\nCombine like three streams from one mountain of snow,\n\nAnd resistless in union rush down on the foe!\n\nTrue son of Sir Evan, undaunted Locheil,\n\nPlace thy targe on thy shoulder and burnish thy steel!\n\nRough Keppoch, give breath to thy bugle’s bold swell,\n\nTill far Coryarrick resound to the knell!\n\nStern son of Lord Kenneth, high chief of Kintail,\n\nLet the stag in thy standard bound wild in the gale!\n\nMay the race of Clan Gilean, the fearless and free,\n\nRemember Glenlivet, Harlaw and Dundee!\n\nLet the clan of grey Fingon, whose offspring has given;\n\nSuch heroes to earth, and such martyrs to heaven,\n\nUnite with the race of renown’d Rory More,\n\nTo launch the long galley, and stretch to the oar.\n\nHow Mac-Shimei will joy when their chief shall display\n\nThe yew-crested bonnet o’er tresses of grey!\n\nHow the race of wrong’d Alpine and murder’d Glencoe;\n\nShall shout for revenge when they pour on the foe\n\nYe sons of brown Dermid, who slew the wild boar,\n\nResume the pure faith of the great Callum-More!\n\nMacNeil of the Islands, and Moy of the Lake,\n\nFor honour, for freedom, for vengeance awake!\n\nAwake on your hills, on your islands awake,\n\nBrave sons of the mountain, the frith and the lake!\n\n‘Tis the bugle – but not for the chase is the call;\n\n‘Tis the pibroch’s shrill summons – but not to the hall.\n\n‘Tis the summons of heroes for conquest or death,\n\nWhen the banners are blazing on mountain and heath;\n\nThey call to the dirk, the claymore, and the targe,\n\nTo the march and the muster, the line and the charge.\n\nBe the brand of each Chieftain like Fin’s in his ire!\n\nMay the blood through his veins flow like currents of fire!\n\nBurst the base foreign yoke as your sires did of yore,\n\nOr die like your sires, and endure it no more!\n\nWalter Scott Waverley 1814\n\nScott also uses the same waterfall in ‘Rob Roy’, and describes it in similar terms:\n\nThe brook, hurling its waters downwards from the mountain, had in this spot encountered a barrier rock, over which it had made its way by two distinct leaps. The first fall, across which a magnificent old oak, slanting out from the farther bank, partly extended itself as if to shroud the dusky stream of the cascade, might be about twelve feet high; the broken waters were received in a beautiful stone basin, almost as regular as if hewn by a sculptor; and after wheeling around its flinty margin, they made a second precipitous dash, through a dark narrow chasm, at least fifty feet in depth, and from thence, in a hurried, but comparatively more gentle course, escaped to join the lake.\n\nWalter Scott Rob Roy 1818\n\nRobertson points out in the Statistical Account that Ben Venue, the mountain on which the burn at Ledard rises is an English rendering of the gaelic for ‘less important mountain’ (i.e. less important than Ben Ledi). The following tribute may encourage the visitor to ascend Ben Venue:\n\nBen Venue is in every way a most beautiful mountain; in a sense, it seems to me to be a kind of epitome of the Scottish Highlands. The tourist from England or abroad is too often shewn the Trossachs and Loch Lomond as sample showpieces; having seen them from car, ‘bus, or steamer, he is allowed to have the impression that he knows what the Scottish Highlands are like. If, into the bargain, he were coaxed or encouraged to climb Ben Venue, he would realise some of the characteristics of Caledonia which, without that experience, remain unknown to him.\n\nW.Kersley Holmes Tramping Scottish Hills 1946\n\nKinlochard was the residence for some years of the modern poet Tom Buchan (1933-1991), who wrote a memorable poem – The Low Road – about Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine which mused about the threat posed by the storage of nuclear weapons in Glen Douglas during the Cold War. It is a different kind of catechism from Flora MacIvor’s song, but equally heartfelt … :\n\nBut no doubt they’ll have arranged\n\nfor an airburst over Glen Douglas\n\nthe fireball of which will deforest Inchlonaig,.\n\nvaporise Cailness and Rowcoish, fry\n\nthe Glasgow Councillors fishing for free\n\non Loch Katrine and kill all the spiders\n\nand earwigs between here and Crianlarich\n\nand me (he thought) as through the soft air\n\ntrucks cars buses and articulated lorries;\n\naccelerated their loads of Omo, people and bricks\n\ntowards Oban and Inveraray.\n\nTom Buchan The Low Road\n\nBen Lomond\n\nKinlochard is the best place to begin to tackle Ben Lomond from Strathard. The way is by Gleann Dubh, whence a track to Rowardennan crosses the Duchary and climbs the shoulder of the Ben. Ben Lomond towers above Loch Ard and has dominated the view thus far. It is a remarkable mountain in that it presents two further, quite different but equally attractive, faces to Loch Lomond. Very few Scottish hills have this quality. The witty Scottish poet, Thomas Campbell (1777-1844), came from Glasgow, and his ballad, Lord Ullin’s Daughter is printed in many anthologies. He was remembered for a long time for several patriotic verses, now forgotten. This poem to Ben Lomond is almost a hymn:\n\nBEN LOMOND\n\nHadst thou a genius on thy peak,\n\nWhat tales white-headed Ben\n\nCoulds’t thou of ancient ages speak,\n\nThat mock th’ historian’s pen.\n\nThy long duration makes our lives\n\nSeem but so many hours;\n\nAnd likens to the bee’s frail hives\n\nOur most stupendous towers.\n\nTemples and towers thou’st seen begun,\n\nNew creeds, new conquerors sway;\n\nAnd like their shadows in the sun,\n\nHast seen them swept away.\n\nThy steadfast summit, heaven-allied\n\n(Unlike life’s little span),\n\nLooks down, a Mentor, on the pride\n\nOf perishable man.\n\nThe Scenic Annual 1837\n\nChauncy Hare Townshend (1798-1868), was encouraged as writer by the ‘Lake Poet’, Robert Southey. He was a traveller, minister, mesmerist, writer and dilettante who visited Ben Lomond, and left the following account of it in his Descriptive Tour in Scotland published in Brussels in 1840. Townshend set off from Loch Lomond to Aberfoyle following the track over the shoulder of Ben Lomond from Rowardennan:\n\nI have generally remarked that the country people here have a great deal of quaint simplicity about them. They seem quite innocent if I may use the expression, and have melancholy voices with a sort of sing-song utterance. They are an ugly race, but the expression of their countenances is usually good. I have not found them grasping, but, on the contrary, contented with whatever one chooses to give them. But, to continue, never was I more glad to get out of a place than out of this wearisome morass. Had theground been all of one kind of badness, one might have endured it; but it was never the same for two minutes together: and, had we been but gifted with wings, we should doubtless have varied our mode of progress as frequently as Milton’s Satan when he scrambled through chaos. You remember the passage?\n\n“The Fiend\n\nO’er bog, or steep, through straight, rough, dense, or rare,\n\nWith head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,\n\nAnd swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.\n\nAt length, after a weary journey, we came in sight of Loch Ard, and here we parted with our guide, of whose services we no longer had any need, as the road was now plain before us to Aberfoyle. It leads along the banks of the two Loch Ards, Upper and Lower, two as lovely lakes as ever I beheld. They have the noble form of Ben Lomond, which here assumes its happiest character, for a background, rising with a double-pointed summit above the meaner mountains. There is something of Italian softness and richness about these lakes; Lower Loch Ard especially, the heights about which are beautifully wooded. It is divided in two by a singular isthmus of land, which gives it a pleasing peculiarity. In the shallow waters of the clear basin nearest to us, a group of variously coloured cattle were cooling themselves. Claude would have rejoiced in such a landscape.\n\nChauncey Hare Townshend Descriptive Tour in Scotland 1840\n\nOne literary visitor who did give an effective account of Ben Lomond, doing justice, for once, to its neglected precipices, was the prodigious bibliographer Thomas Frognall Dibdin (1776-1847) in his Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in the Northern Counties of England and Scotland of 1838. Dibdin’s book, as his title suggests, is really one of the first literary topographies. He is interested in places, not particularly for themselves, but for the books and writers associated with them. His first excursion into this genre was to France and Germany. His Scottish tour was, for its date, conventional, but bold, a crossing of Ben Lomond exemplifying his willingness to explore byways. At the summit Dibdin gazed over this precipice, remarking on the way in which even sheep which had been frightened seemed to halt on the edge of it:\n\nWe spent the greater part of an hour in the indulgence of an unbounded gaze; and having looked until our eyes began to ache, and our appetites to be strirred by the keenness of the mountain air, we thought we might as well betake ourselves to something like a sheltered recess, and “hold familiar discourse” with our basket of goodly viands. The guide-boatman said “it would do us a world of good – and might help us to lay the cloth upon a little jutting piece of rock or spar?” He had told us not to provide ourselves with water, as whiskey never mixed so well as with the water found upon the mountain. Accordingly he soon returned from filling a small jug to the brim; and I must say, made himself as agreeable and efficient a waiter as could be found at the Clarendon or the Albion. All things being prepared, we fell to our substantials: the guide seeming to enjoy the alacrity with which we “maintained the combat”. Cold chicken and Fyne herring are only to be eaten to advantage on the summit of Ben Lomond.\n\nThomas Dibdin 1838\n\nDibdin goes on to describe a series of toasts in which they then indulged, including, unsurprisingly in view of Dibdin’s dedication to books, the rather unlikely name of William Caxton.\n\nAnother nineteenth century literary visitor who actually succeeded in climbing to the top of Ben Lomond was Charles Nodier (seeAberfoyle). William Hazlitt (1778-1830), the journalist and critic, has left a somewhat unsatisfactory account, suggesting that he climbed Ben Lomond, in Liber Amoris. In it he related, to James Sheridan Knowles, his passion for Sarah Walker, his landlord’s daughter. This passion tortured him on a visit to Scotland in 1822, after visiting Loch Katrine from Loch Lomond he must have crossed to Strathard and then gone to Inversnaid. His graphic description of the route suggests the terrors of the Alps, rather than the ordinary road which he is actually describing:\n\nThe road preceded by the side of some inferior lochs and terraced woods, very stony and rough until you arrive at the mountain 3262 feet in height; and in crossing the most dreary, pathless part of it, a heavy storm came on. There was not the least shelter, and the heat of climbing such an ascent, together with the fear of losing myself in such a lonely place, almost overcame me; but I guided myself by the direction of the loch as well as I could, and at last, to my great joy, regained the track; but the road was stony and difficult, over a wide and dreary moor, full of bogs, till you arrive at Inversnaid Garrison, as it is still called, but it is in fact merely some ruins of what once was such, in the midst of the moor, the habitable part of which is occupied by a few poor people; and it was by the mere chance of going to beg a drink of water, that I found that this bore the name of Garrison, upon enquiring how far it was to it.\n\nWilliam Hazlitt Liber Amoris 1822\n\nSir Archibald Geikie (1835-1924), the Director of the Geological Survey and Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh, who travelled all over Scotland uses a story about Ben Lomond related by R. Jamieson in his edition of Burt’s Letters to discuss the impact of Sir Walter Scott on the Highlands:\n\nScott and the Highlands\n\nNo more remarkable contrast between the present tourist traffic in this lake region and that of the early part of last century could be supplied than that which is revealed by an incident recorded as having occurred about the year 1814, four years after the publication of Scott’s Lady of the Lake. An old highlander, who was met on the top of Ben Lomond, said he had been a guide from the north side of the mountain for upwards of forty years; ‘but that damned Walter Scott, that everyone makes such a work about!’ exclaimed he with vehemence – ‘I wish I had him to ferry over Loch Lomond: I should be after sinking the boat, if I drowned myself into the bargain; for ever since he wrote his Lady of the Lake, as they call it, everybody goes to see that filthy hole Loch Katrine, then comes round by Luss, and I have only had two gentlemen to guide all this blessed season, which is now at an end. I shall never see the top of Ben Lomond again! The devil confound his ladies and his lakes, say I!’\n\nIf this indignant mountaineer could revisit his early haunts, his grandchildren would have a very different story to tell him of the poet’s influence. For one visitor to his beloved mountain in his day there must now be at least a hundred, almost all of whom have had their first longing to see that region kindled by the poems and tales of Scott. No man ever did so much to make his country known and attractive as the author of Waverley has done for Scotland. His fictitious characters have become historical personages in the eyes of thousands of pilgrims who every year visit the scenes he has described. In threading the pass of the Trossachs, they try to see where Fitz James must have lost his ‘gallant grey.’ In passing Ellen’s Isle, they scrutinise it, if haply any relics of her home have survived. At Coilantogle Ford they want to know the exact spot where the duel was fought between the King and Roderick Dhu. At Aberfoyle they look out for the Clachan, or some building that must stand on its site, and their hearts are comforted by finding suspended to a tree on the village green the veritable coulter with which Bailie Nichol Jarvie burnt the big Highlander’s plaid. So delighted indeed have the tourists been with this relic of the past that they have sureptitiously carried it off more than once, and have thus compelled the village smith each time to manufacture a new antique.\n\nSir Archibald Geikie Scottish Reminiscences 1904\n\nLoch Chon\n\nFrom Kinlochard the B829 climbs briskly, dropping down at The Teapot, and then climbing again beside pleasing water breaks to reach Loch Dubh, the black loch. It then passes Rob Roy’s Well and arrives at Loch Chon where there are a variety of picnic places. Loch Chon is sometimes perceived as a dark, unfriendly place because the Forestry Commission have clothed the steep hillsides on its western shore with conifers. However, on a fine day there are few more attractive lochs in the southern highlands; the natural woodland which occur on its eastern bank provide a wonderful setting for a picnic and the Commission have made ample provision for car parking. In spite of this the sense of remoteness which can be obtained there is considerable because there are few houses.\n\nA notable modern collector of Folk Tales was R. MacDonald Robertson, the author of a number of distinguished books about fishing in the Highlands between and just after the wars. In Selected Highland Folk Tales he relates the following story about Loch Chon, which he calls Loch-a-Choin:\n\nThere is a chain of three beautiful lochans in West Perthshire – Loch Ard, Loch-a-Choin and Loch Arklet – situated by the main road between Aberfoyle and Inversnaid It is with Loch-a-Choin (The Dog Loch) that this story deals. Tradition attributes to this loch a water-monster in the shape of a huge dog.\n\nNot so very long ago, one oppressively hot summer’s day, a weary tourist sat down by the banks of Loch-a-Choin to have lunch. Soon he heard the sound of the rattle of pots and pans mingled with footfalls on the road behind him; and on looking round observed on the highway a tinker laden with various metal cooking utensils, trudging along the road in company with a young lad. To his astonishment, he saw the tinker suddenly seize the boy, and walking down to the edge of a ledge of rock, fling him into the water. Immediately after the splash of the body, there was a great swirl, and the savage head of a huge and grotesque dog-like monster broke the surface and swallowed the body of the child whole. The tinker thereafter mysteriously vanished from sight. Terrified beyond all measure the traveller fled to Aberfoyle as fast as possible. On entering the inn he met some local people and told them of his weird experience by the shores pof Loch-a-Choin.\n\nHe was told that what he had just seen was the recurrence of a tragically true event which had taken place on the banks of the loch many years ago, at the same place where he had rested for lunch, and that the tinker had been found out and hanged for his evil deed. The hiker had seen the murder re-enacted on the exact date and at the exact hour when the crime was originally perpetrated. To this day, many of the older inhabitants of the district believe that the dog-monster still lurks within Loch-a-Choin, waiting for victims.\n\nPatrick Graham drew attention to the mountain hollow beyond the head of Loch Chon:\n\nAbout a mile beyond the source of the Forth, above Loch Chon, there is a place called Coir-shi’an, or the Cove of the Men of Peace, which is still supposed to be a place of their residence. In the neighbourhood are to be seen many round conical eminences; particularly one, near the head of the lake; by the skirts of which many are still afraid to pass after sunset. It is believed that if on Hallow Eve any person alone goes round one of thse hills nine times, towards the left hand (sinistrorsum), a door shall open by which he shall be admitted into their subterraneous abodes.\n\nPatrick Graham Sketches of Perthshire 1806\n\nEnchantment in the Trossachs\n\nFairies from Aberfoyle and Elsewhere\n\nYou will not understand the literary history of the Trossachs half so well if you chose not to consider the enormous influence which the supernatural exercises on the place. If Loch Ness has something of a monopoly of water monsters, and the Cairngorms have something of a corner in mountain apparitions, the Trossachs in general, and Aberfoyle in particular, enjoy – in Scotland at least – an unrivalled reputation for fairies. Superstition is unfashionable. The language has abused words which, once upon a time, were to be taken seriously, or at least conjured up widely respected images. Folklore. primitive beliefs, pagan rituals, religion, the dead, changelings, household spirits and fairies used to be intermingled in people’s minds. Nowadays legends are respectable providing they are not too fantastic, religion is generally well-thought-of, but the occult, by and large, is not; fairies are no longer taken seriously. At the edge of the Highlands such distinctions were very much more blurred until not more than a hundred years ago’\n\nThe maestro, Sir Walter Scott, used folk history and the history of the district in The Lady of the Lake. His admirers included Charles Nodier, the French romantic, writer of short stories a fairy tales. Hans Christian Anderson (1805-75), one of the World’s greatest storytellers, and Jules Verne (1828-1905), founder of Science Fiction and exponent of the fantastic, all visited, and were enchanted by the Trossachs.\n\nRobert Kirk, the Minister of Aberfoyle, was as we have seen a serious student of folk beliefs and author of the first notable work on the subject. Patrick Graham, his successor, explainer of Kirk and inspirer of Scott, was, in his own right, a distinguished writer about both the topography and the fairy lore of the district. In addition to Grham’s mentions of it Scott edited n edition of The Secret Commonwealth in 1815, Andrew Lang (see Aberfoyle) edited the next edition in 1893, and R.B.Cunninghame Graham edited a third in 1933.\n\nThe following alphabetical guide has been compiled with reference to E.
