        "text": "Prof Dore\n\nElizabeth (Liz) Dore, Professor Emerita of Modern Languages and Linguistics at Southampton University, died in May 2022, leaving a great hole in the world of Latin American History.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York just after the end of World War II, Liz lived through the civil rights movement and came of age as an activist and academic at a time when socialist, even communist, world marked by equality and dignity seemed possible.\n\nLiz had a PhD from Columbia University and wrote extensively on modern Latin American history and politics, with a focus on Cuba, Peru and Nicaragua. Her special expertise was in relations of class, race, gender and ethnicity and key publications include: The Peruvian Mining Industry: Growth, Stagnation, And Crisis (1988), Myths of Modernity: Peonage and Patriarchy in Nicaragua (2006), How Things Fall Apart: What Happened to the Cuban Revolution (2022), and the edited volumes Gender Politics in Latin America: Debates in Theory and Practice (1997) and Hidden Histories of Gender and the State in Latin America (2000). Her book Myths of Modernity: Peonage and Patriarchy in Nicaragua (2006) grew out of her work with the Sandinista government in the 1980s.\n\nVoices from the Activist-Scholar\n\nAn life-long activist-scholar, Liz’s most proud project was the one she directed during the last two decades of her life: the Memories of the Cuban Revolution oral history project, which focused on Cubans’ memories of life since the revolutionary victory of 1959. Under Liz’s direction, a team of Cuban and British scholars collected more than one hundred in-depth life history interviews, drawn from a cross-section of men and women across the island. It was the first oral history project authorized by the Cuban government in forty years. In the final weeks before her death, Liz worked tirelessly to complete her book based on these interviews. How Things Fall Apart: What Happened to the Cuban Revolution, published by Apollo in summer 2022, was the result of this labour and commitment.\n\nFor her thoughts on the history of the circum Carribean and South American cooperative social movment that was an alternative free-trade zone approach, the Latin American Bolivarian Alliance (ALBA), see her 2012 talk.\n\nAn Enduring Impact\n\nHow Things Fall Apart is in many ways a culmination of Liz’s life work. In it, she sought to give voice to ordinary people reflecting on their own lives and history. She saw the book, like all her work, as a contribution to our collective thinking on how to create and mold more equal and just societies. It promises to leave a lasting mark on Latin American historical studies and beyond.\n\nLiz’s life partner, the economist John Weeks, died in 2021. She is survived by her sister Marge, her twin children, Rachel and Matthew Dore-Weeks, and her beloved grandchildren, Lukas and Hana, as well as countless friends and colleagues who will miss her sharp mind and kind heart.\n\nby Carrie Hamilton\n\nAnna Grimaldi, University of Leeds\n\nAt the general meeting of the UKLAH conference this year, we discussed some of the challenges and opportunities faced by historians of Latin America in the UK today. We talked about being scattered across different non-history departments – languages, cultural and media studies, development, political and social sciences – and how this poses a challenge to our existence as a distinct scholarly community. We discussed the limitations of mentoring students who, as fascinated as they may be with Latin American history, might find themselves limited in their engagement due to language barriers, their ability to deal with primary sources, and their experience with various frames of analysis. We also thought about some of the pressures facing academia more broadly, in terms of the amount of time and investment we would like to be putting into addressing these challenges, and the amount of time we realistically have at our disposal within current work models.\n\nThe conversation encouraged me to reflect about my own engagements with students this year. I believe that one project, titled Thinking Inside the Box, sheds light on some of the ways that we, as historians of Latin America here in the UK, might meet some of the challenges discussed above.\n\nThinking Inside the Box is a co-curricular, student-led pedagogical project set up at King’s College London. Working in close partnership with University of London’s Senate House Library, the project accompanied students to take a dive into the library’s largely unknown yet expansive Special Collection of Latin American Political Pamphlets of the mid- to late-20th century. The project was inspired by the work of Brazilian pedagogist Paulo Freire, with the intention being to bring students’ worldviews and diverse positionalities into the interpretation and treatment of the visual artefacts contained in the collection.\n\nStudents were prepared through a series of workshops and presentations on how to conduct their research, including an introductory meeting with Julio Cazzasa (the library’s Special Collection manager), a workshop on visual analysis with Lula Rappaport (an MA student of Strategic Communications), and a training session on how to navigate the online catalogue and request items (with myself). Students then formed groups based on specific countries, with each group selecting around five boxes of materials. During November and December of 2021, students visited the library in groups of six, receiving support from staff on how to handle the materials, take notes on their contents, and conduct visual analysis. Students then each chose one or two images to curate. These were scanned in high quality definition and brought together as an exhibition collection.\n\nThe exhibition launch was held on Wednesday 30 March, 2022. It invited over 60 guests, including students, academics, and members of King’s management. Images were displayed alongside captions produced by students, alongside audio descriptions of the items for people with visual impairments. While the exhibition was on display, the student and staff teams also organised additional events to highlight the interpretive value of the materials and their connection to various other areas of research. These included a presentation on Turkish Political Posters from 1968-1971, and another exploring the posters produced as part of the Tricontinental, through Cuba’s Organisation of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America (OSPAAAL). The latter was also joined by Dr. Zeina Maasri, a leader in the field of visual cultural studies with expertise in Lebanese political posters of the 1970s-1980s.\n\nThe project’s lifespan and reach extended far beyond the exhibition and parallel events. Students designed and produced an 80-page catalogue which has been registered at the British Library with its own ISBN. Among other things, the catalogue contained 19 reflective research essays written by students based on the materials they had curated. Students organised a virtual version of the exhibition, they created an instagram page, and they published on their experiences. Samantha Colorado, a final year history student, had her text printed in Issue 28 of Latino Life in English, and in the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s London Centre as a blogpost in Spanish.\n\nAll of the above goes to demonstrate the diversity of conversations and range of skills that were catalysed by a visit to the archival collection of Latin American Political Pamphlets. More importantly, the project highlighted some of the ways that we can anchor and inspire a range of activities in the study of Latin American history.\n\nThe project encouraged and supported students in making the most of their interdisciplinary cohort, and in bringing together a vast range of skills that allowed for pluralistic engagement with the artefacts. Some students spoke Spanish and/or Portuguese, others were experienced in visual analysis; some students brought an intimate understanding of Cold War history, while others had a personal connection to some of the Latin American countries we were dealing with; finally, students chose to engage with the materials in ways that best suited their own research goals – by working on reflective essays, by managing social media and outreach, or by making the exhibition more accessible to different users and audiences. And the experience has shaped students’ research plans and extra-curricular activities, with many continuing to visit the collections and taking part in related events and projects.\n\nIn the context of where UK-based historians of Latin America find themselves today, I believe that Thinking Inside the Box offers a small ray of hope in making the field relevant, inspiring, unifying, and educational far beyond the classroom.\n\nDr. Caroline A. Williams was a crucial figure in the development of Latin American history in the UK, a leader in Latin American Studies and a pioneer of interdisciplinary research across humanities and natural sciences. She died in 2019 at the age of 57 and left behind a body of work that is remarkable for its breadth (across history, Latin American Studies, volcanology, and maritime economics) and a significant human legacy in the many memories of her ways of working that influenced everyone she came into contact with. She worked as lecturer and then senior lecturer in Latin American Studies at the University of Bristol for over a quarter of a century. On 9 June 2022 the School of Modern Languages and the Society for Latin American Studies hosted a round-table event in Bristol to discuss and celebrate her work. We waited for the COVID-19 pandemic to subside so that we could meet up in person rather than mediate these memories through a virtual platform. This write-up is to be shared amongst readers of BLAR and beyond. It is full of embedded hyperlinks so that new readers can find their way to her work.\n\nJo Crow, Associate Professor in Latin American Studies at the University of Bristol, opened the round-table by reflecting on her own experience of being mentored by Caroline throughout her career. In themes that were seconded by many participants, she recalled numerous episodes in which Caroline took time to chat, guide, advise and encourage junior scholars, offering warmth, her home and her imagination. Dan Haines, Associate Professor in Environmental History, spoke later about how Caroline had taken him under her wing when he arrived at Bristol, coming to consider her as ‘like an elder sister’ and being inspired by her innovative interdisciplinarity’ and her ‘dedication to doing the type of work that needed to be done’. There were many smiles and nods of recognition across the room at memories of wine being drunk at the Hawthorns bar, cigarette-breaks outside 15 Woodland Road, and Caroline going ‘above and beyond’ the call of duty to support students. Dan recalled asking Caroline for guidance on future research projects – whether to choose a difficult, ambitious and important project that might lead nowhere, or an easier programme of work that would lead seamlessly to recognition and promotion. ‘Do the hard thing’ was Caroline’s advice.\n\nCaroline’s research in colonial archives was fundamental in the changes in the ways that indigenous histories were approached, taught, and understood. Linda Newson, Emeritus Professor of Latin American Geography at Kings College London, spoke of Caroline’s research in colonial Latin American history in glowing terms. She remembered acting as the External Examiner for Caroline’s doctoral thesis at Warwick University, ‘Conquest and Colonisation in the Colombian Chocó, 1510-1740’ and as the anonymous reviewer for the book that was eventually published as Between Resistance and Adaptation: Indigenous Peoples and the Colonisation of the Chocó, 1510-1753 by Liverpool University Press. She noted that the later research on Central American Mosquitia was published in the journal The Americas for which her article received the Tibesar prize for its best article in 2014. She suggested that Caroline’s research reveals the complexity of interethnic relations and was devoted to ‘understanding and bringing to life the lives of people’ and was characterized by ‘empathy and humanity’. The approach to the history of borderlands was ‘quietly pioneering’, and was expanded in the introduction to her edited book Bridging the Early Modern Atlantic. Matthew Brown, Professor in Latin American History at Bristol and current series editor of the Liverpool Latin American Studies book series, noted that Between Resistance and Adaptation was the first book in the series to be single-authored by a woman, and remains one of the standout titles even nearly two decades later.\n\nThe impact of Caroline’s dedication to archival sleuthing, building networks and forging connections went far beyond her regional specialisms. Erica Hendy, Senior Lecturer in Global Biogeochemical Cycles in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol, reflected on the CAKE collective (Caroline, Alison Rust, Kathy Cashman and Erica) which produced ground-breaking interdisciplinary research valued by volcanologists and climate scientists. She described how Caroline’s irrepressible curiosity ‘stretched across our disciplines’, sharing historical images of volcanoes and hunting down and sharing the first eyewitness accounts of the mystery ‘1809 Unknown’ eruption, ‘bringing historical actors to life’ and establishing, through the testimonies of Francisco José de Caldas and José Hipólito Unanue, that one of the biggest volcanic eruptions in the last 500 years took place in the tropics in early December 1808. Erica spoke about how the precision of Caroline’s translations of historical evidence from colonial Spanish to contemporary English informed the research group’s analysis, which would not have been possible without her.\n\nThe round-table provided an opportunity to reflect on Caroline’s unique research trajectory. Nicola Miller, Professor of Latin American History at University College London, who published an obituary of Caroline in the Bulletin of Spanish Studies, spoke about Caroline’s first book, From Sail to Steam: Studies in the Nineteenth-Century History of the Channel Islands, produced whilst a postdoctoral fellow at UCL. Caroline threw herself into the economic history of maritime commerce in a region and a century that were new to her, eventually producing a ‘beautiful, elegant, unassuming and precise book’. She spent many months poring over photocopies of archival documents, counting shipments of iron, building tables and charts and discerning patterns from her dense collections of data. The third part of the book, on the social history of the islands, took dry economic history sources and drew information to evoke the lives of so many peoples, experiences and emotions. The book is evidence of the extent to which Caroline cared about people’s lives, both in the past and in the present, Nicola concluded.\n\nMany of these themes also emerged in the words of Mark Allinson, Associate Pro-Vice Chancellor for Education (Learning and Teaching) at the University of Bristol, who remembered his time working closely with Caroline on education strategy and processes in the School of Modern Languages. Emphasising Caroline’s ‘deep wells of humanity’, ‘endlessly hardworking nature’ and her ‘collegiality and willingness to share’, Mark described Caroline as ‘my partner in crime, except she would never let me commit any crime’.\n\nThe round-table was closed by Bethan Fisk, Lecturer in the Colonial History of Latin America at Bristol, who described herself as ‘living in Caroline’s footnotes’ as she developed her own work on eighteenth-century Colombia upon the foundations set by Between Resistance and Adaptation. Bethan and Caroline only met once, but this was a lengthy and generous session in which Caroline explained the inner workings of the Spanish colonial archives in which she had such deep experience and knowledge. Bethan carries on Caroline’s commitment to studying the entanglements between peoples and between empires, her refusal to romanticise people of the past, and her focus on autonomy and agency.\n\nThe depth of feeling aroused by these contributions was such that the round-table was greeted with long and rapturous applause, loud enough for Caroline to hear.\n\nOther colleagues sent messages from afar, which were read at the event in the absence of a hybrid dimension. Karl Offen, Professor of Geography at Syracuse University in the U.S.A, expanded upon his recent publication about Caroline and spoke about their collaboration on the histories emanating from the Mosquitia region and how astonished he was at her meticulous analysis and readings of colonial archival documents. Anne Payne, who worked with Caroline as School Manager for over a decade, wrote that ‘Caroline was a wonderful colleague whose endless help and patience was priceless’. Former Bristol colleagues Kirsty Reid, Sally-Ann Kitts and Chris Macleod, who wrote an obituary of Caroline for The Guardian, communicated that ‘Caroline is a constant presence in our thoughts and hearts.’ Emer Stubbs, recently retired as the Subject Librarian for Hispanic, Portuguese and Latin American Studies, recalled how Caroline was ‘always the consummate professional, she was thoughtful and gracious in her dealings with me and with all the library staff with whom she came into contact’.\n\nWe conclude this piece with contributions from two historians whose careers were shaped by Caroline’s work and guidance. Julia McClure, Lecturer in Late Medieval and Early Modern Global History at the University of Glasgow, explained how Caroline’s work inspired her own by ‘offering a new narrative of indigenous agency’. Julia suggested that Between Resistance and Adaptation was amongst the early works ‘to move the historical narrative beyond the perpetrator-victim binary to tell more complex stories that brought Indigenous resistance and subversion into focus’. Michael Goebel, Einstein Professor of Global History at FU-Berlin, who Caroline supported when he had recently graduated, wrote from Germany that ‘in more than one sense, I owe my career to the bridges she built for me at that crucial moment when I needed them’. Michael’s conclusion is an apt conclusion to these words, combining an appreciation of her home and office life, with her often hidden work in mentoring and supporting colleagues. ‘Just like in her personal and professional relationships with other people’, Michael wrote, ‘in her work too I admired Caroline most for her humaneness; an unusual emotional intelligence through which she perceived the world around her near and far, with profound empathy and understanding, alongside a mild-mannered sense of humour. I miss Caroline and I believe academia, which needs more people than her, misses her too’.\n\nWe invite expressions of interest from historians of Latin America based in the UK to attend an in-person day of workshops and discussions at the University of Bristol on Friday 10 June 2022.\n\nThe event\n\nThe first meeting of UK-based historians of Latin America was held in London in June 2019. The intention to establish a more formal network with a major event in 2020 was scuppered by COVID-19. We gathered instead on Zoom and established this website. We now want to make the network real again. The face-to-face gathering in Bristol will create a space for historians of Latin America of all career stages based in the UK to reconnect, establish mentoring relationships, share research findings, and plan the next stages for our network.\n\nOn Friday 10 June 2022 we will have a morning of research papers and discussion, and then a post-lunch round-table on the state of the field of Latin American history in the UK. The day will be brought to a close with a session to discuss and plan the expansion of UKLAH, including the major conference at UCL in London in 2023.\n\nAction Required\n\nWe invite expressions of interest to uklahnetwork@gmail.com from:\n\na. Early-career researchers (doctoral candidates or researchers within 5 years of their PhD completion) to pre-circulate and present papers for discussion at the event. (Please send an abstract of 300 words max, plus a 1 page cv, via email, before 6 April 2022).\n\nb. Later-career researchers (i.e. everyone who is more than 5 years past their PhD completion) to act as discussants of the pre-circulated papers. (Please send an email indicating willingness via email before 6 April 2022).\n\nc. Historians of Latin America based in the UK who would like to attend and participate in the discussions without doing either a. or b. (Please send an email indicating your intention to attend before 6 April 2022).\n\nFinance\n\nThanks to the generous support of the University of Bristol Faculty of Arts, the Institute of the Americas at UCL, and other institutions, we hope to be able to cover the travel and accommodation expenses of as many participants as possible, prioritising those of early-career researchers. Please let us know in your email if you would like to be considered for this. Full details will be made available once we have an idea of the number of participants.\n\nOrganizers\n\nNathaniel Morris, Bethan Fisk, Paulo Drinot, Jo Crow, Michela Coletta, Matthew Brown\n\nCaroline Williams Memorial Event\n\nOn the evening preceding the UKLAH 2022 event, the University of Bristol will be hosting a round-table discussion to celebrate the research of Caroline Williams (1962-2019), Senior Lecturer in Latin American Studies and former president of SLAS. All participants in UKLAH 2022 will be warmly invited to attend. The event is being generously supported by the School of Modern Languages at the University of Bristol, and by the Society for Latin American Studies.\n\nFollowing the release of the paperback edition of Decadent Modernity: Civilization and ‘Latinidad’ in Spanish America, 1880-1920 in the autumn of 2021, I revisit the book’s conclusions in light of a renewed engagement by Latin American and critical south scholars from different fields of enquiry with the notion of modernity and its significance for the intensifying ecological crisis. While an excessive focus on this idea makes it appear washed out like an overexposed image where meaningful details are no longer visible, modernity has resurfaced in much of current decolonial work from and about Latin America. On the one hand, it is approached as the process that encapsulates the dystopian realisation of Enlightenment reason; on the other hand, it is being incorporated to express states of transition or in-betweenness by indigenous thinkers, for example through the notion of ‘indigenous modernity’. However, there is a tendency to be oblivious to the fact that the early-twentieth-century moderns, who first used ‘modern’ as an adjective that encompasses cultural, artistic, sociological and psychological conditions alongside material realities, more often than not coated their enthusiasm for progress with a warning. While celebrating the promises of a fast changing and increasingly interconnected world, many cultural critics used the language of emerging social and medical sciences to point to the pathological reverberations of this new modern civilisation.\n\nIn its inception, the book did not seek to interrogate the idea of modernity either as an interpretive framework or as a cultural discourse. However, the more I became familiar with the narrative topoi that circulated in the discourses about national and regional identities at the turn of the nineteenth century, the clearer it became that questions about modernity shaped the ways in which the Latin American elites positioned themselves and their own countries in a globalising world order. The starting point for the book was a hunch based on the rich poetic productions of the modernista and early avant-garde literary movements between the 1880s and the 1920s. It was striking how much of the Latin American literature in the nation-building decades was about the decadent denouement of modern urban life. Why was the foundational literature of Latin American nations decadent? This question seemed to have even more weight if one looked at the United States, where a small group of self-named decadent writers occupied a fringe space and were pretty much ostracised from national identity narratives. A hint came from Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz, who had stressed this idiosyncrasy and had concluded that the modernista writers were decadent because they wanted to be modern.\n\nAt a time when disciplines such as sociology and criminology were taking shape, European – and especially French – social critics diagnosed their nations with a pathological condition originating from the exposure to the excesses of modern life. An example is the flourishing of studies about suicide, which was seen as a tangible symptom of cultural and moral decay. By drawing from the European scientific and cultural discourse of degeneration, the Latin American intellectual and political elites were able to incorporate their nations in the emerging modern world. Decadent French literature epitomised the growing refinement and spiritual sophistication that made societies self-indulgent and weak: cultural Latinity was a way into modernity. The book argues that by advocating their adherence to Latin civilisation, the Spanish-and-Portuguese-speaking countries of the American continent rejected the threatening emptiness of the state of nature in which the New World had traditionally been placed. In tracing transnational and transatlantic networks, the book shows the relevance of cultural frameworks of modernity in the emergence of ‘Latin America’ as a geo-political region. Beyond unravelling the extent to which scientific and literary narratives intermingled in producing political and cultural identities, the book’s arguments also illuminate the self-critical outlook of early-twentieth-century moderns and their preoccupation with progress as a Janus-faced concept. This is possibly modernity’s most important legacy, and one that we need to engage with again.\n\nChalk and cheese, vinegar and oil, Cain and Abel – you name it, the Hispanic and Anglo worlds are often portrayed as antagonistic and alien to each other. The book The Hispanic-Anglosphere from the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Century – An Introduction (New York and London: Routledge, 2021) challenges such view with a new critical conceptual framework to open a window into the often surprising interactions of individuals, transnational networks and global communities that, it argues, made of the British Isles (England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) a crucial hub for the global Hispanic world, a launching-pad and a bridge between Spanish Europe, Africa, America and Asia in the late eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries. Perhaps not unlike today, that was a time marked by social uncertainty, pandemics, the dislocation of global polities and the rise of radicalisms.\n\nThe volume stems from the work of The Hispanic-Anglosphere: transnational networks, global communities (late 18th to early 20th centuries), a thriving international research network that since 2017 has been bringing together over twenty historians from the British Isles, continental Europe, the Americas and Russia to work in association with scholars from other disciplines and non-academic partners to reveal the extent of the contribution made by those who from any point of the British Isles were closely engaged with the global Hispanic world, regardless of their birth, religion or political allegiance as well as the input of those who came from the Hispanic world to the British Isles as visitors, exiles and/or migrants. The network’s objective is to break free from national perspectives and from intellectual – often disciplinary-induced – straight-jackets that tend to favour US-centrism and to force us to choose between either Spanish-British or Latin American-British perspectives.\n\nEstablished academics and rising stars from different continents and disciplines combined original, primary research with a wide range of secondary sources to produce a rich collection of ten case-studies (Section 1), 25 biographies and seven samples of interpreted material culture (Section 2) touching on themes of sustainability and social justice.\n\nSection I follows norms of detailed reference citation familiar to scholars and it offers insights on a diverse range of subjects including trade, the arts, education, language, politics, the press, religion, biodiversity, philanthropy, anti-slavery and imperialism. For example, in Chapter 1, readers are able to trace the way and the extent to which the word ‘colonies’ – never employed in the legal codes of the Spanish Monarchy to refer to its overseas dominions – came to be applied to the Hispanic context through increased entanglement with the Anglo world and also how it was strongly resisted by Spanish Americans who wanted to preserve the integrity of the Spanish Monarchy model of global governance. Chapter 3 places the Hispanic element at the heart of the East Asian and Pacific opium trade through a study of the establishment of the firm Yrisarri & Co. and shows it, not as an exception to a narrative dominated by British actors, but as the tip of an iceberg emerging from the Hispanic-Anglosphere.\n\nAlso looking into the Pacific basin, Chapter 4 suggests that hybridity in the provision of education should perhaps be considered as the permanent feature of Chile’s educational system, a conclusion arrived after studying the adoption in 1821 of the Monitorial method of education developed in the British Isles which Chapter 8 tells us it was embraced and adapted in Spain during the Liberal Triennium (1820–23), in an effort to mitigate poverty and encourage social inclusion and mobility. Chapter 5 traces the eventful route towards the development of Tyntesfield, a spectacular country residency near Bristol, England, now under the care of the National Trust, through an exploration of the private and public life of its founder, William Gibbs (1790–1875). Particularly highlighted are the roles played by women, emotional attachments, prejudices and epidemics in shaping the destiny of the man, his business practices and country retreat. The chapter looks into his formative years in Spain, the roots of his religious and aesthetic philanthropy in Britain and the measures he undertook with his brother George Henry Gibbs (1785–1842) to transform the family company Antony Gibbs & Sons into a global commercial powerhouse with permanent agents throughout Europe and the Americas. By demonstrating that these developments took place long before the signing of the series of contracts by which the government of Peru granted to the family firm exclusive rights to import guano (bird manure) to the United Kingdom, this study shows that far from relying on the fate of a single\n\ncommodity, the Gibbs participated in the globalization of many natural resources. The expansion of their business in the Americas, for example, was largely determined by the desire to acquire quina (Cinchona) bark, the ‘wonder drug’ used for the treatment of fevers, originating from a large shrub that could only be found in the Andean region of South America – that is, until seeds were smuggled out by Charles Ledger (1818–1905) to be successfully grown and commercialized by the Dutch in Asia, as Chapter 6 points out where wider conclusions are drawn about the interplay of scientific knowledge, bio-piracy and imperialism. Focusing on one particularly coveted species, the alpaca, it explains why British subjects came to see acclimatization as desirable and how they exploited their involvement in the Hispanic-Anglosphere, thus setting in motion biological and technological innovations that altered landscapes, rural practices and the environment forever.\n\nThe way and the extent to which the views of British-settled communities shaped and animated public opinion is assessed in Chapter 7 with a study of the English-speaking press in the River Plate. The circulation of bilingual papers spread critical views and generated discussions both within and outside British expat communities. Dissent of a much higher calibre, coupled with the hardening of migration laws across Western Europe and the Americas, explains the emergence in the 1890s of a what could hardly be considered as a settled group: a distinct Spanish libertarian community in Britain investigated in Chapter 9. A leading speaker in the Trafalgar Square rally was Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (1852–1936), future founder and first president of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP). He was also among the assiduous correspondents of the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno that are investigated in Chapter 10.\n\nSection 2 of the book offers a range of short articles that add information and bring to the fore more plainly many of the connections analysed earlier in the volume. The individuals covered in the biographies were selected under the sole criteria that they should be non-canonical figures and that their experiences could provide evidence relating to a wide spectrum of topics. In-text references are provided for all quotes and sources have been listed along with suggested secondary readings at the end of each entry, not just to ease reading in general, but mainly for pedagogical purposes. In light of the restrictions created by the Covid-19 emergency, particular effort was placed in identifying material that can be reached through open access in the Internet.\n\nWhile clearly important, the legal mechanisms and economic provisions that underpin any programme of land reform can only tell part of the story. The debates that occur beyond court rooms and government offices play a key role in shaping public perceptions of land reform and informing the narrative that different actors construct in defending their preferred outcome. In my forthcoming book, Land without Masters: Agrarian Reform and Political Change under Peru’s Military Government I show how state interventions in education, mass media and local politics that accompanied Peru’s 1969 agrarian reform were as impactful as the transfer of land itself.\n\nThe land reforms that swept across Latin America in the latter half of the twentieth century ranged from large-scale land redistribution—as in Peru and Bolivia—to more limited technical assistance and small-scale allocation of state-owned land, as in Colombia. Peru’s agrarian reform is unusual because it was introduced by a left-wing military government, at a time of right-wing dictatorships across the region. The Chief of the Peruvian Armed Forces, Juan Velasco Alvarado, seized power in a military coup in 1968. A man of humble origins, Velasco had a personal commitment to land reform and little confidence that a civilian government could bring about the radical change required. The 1969 Agrarian Reform Law redistributed around 45% of Peru’s agricultural land from large landowners to newly created peasant cooperatives.\n\nIn the 1960s, Peruvian politics were still dominated by a small, mostly white elite in the capital, Lima. The vast majority of the peasant population was denied the vote on the grounds of illiteracy. The agrarian reform shattered that status quo in two respects. Firstly, carrying out the processes of land expropriation and distribution required a massive extension of the state presence in rural areas. Secondly, the Velasco government also politicised that presence by expressly stating that the agrarian reform authorities would intervene on behalf of peasants against the landowners and by investing heavily in education and propaganda to mobilise rural populations in support of the reform. As a result, Peruvian politics were both radicalised—as new movements emerged on the Left and Right to contest the government’s narrative—and de-centred, becoming less focused on Lima and more inclusive of peasants as citizens.\n\nIn a propaganda effort that was unprecedented in Peru’s history, the Velasco government hired hundreds of artists, intellectuals and ‘promoters’ to articulate its reform agenda. Across the country, peasants were encouraged to imagine a more socially just world in which their life chances would not be constrained by the will of the landowner. This campaign has been touched on by others but never treated as an important story in its own right. I studied the dynamics of this campaign at local, regional and national levels, showing how it opened up new political debates. Examining newspapers, posters, pamphlets and film—sources not normally included within studies of agrarian reform—highlighted the broad cultural impact of the agrarian reform.\n\nA key argument of my book is that the agrarian reform was perceived differently in different parts of the country, and that the Velasco government became heavily invested in attending to regional politics whilst trying to roll out its national programme. I compared the contrasting regions of Piura, on the northern coast, Cusco, in the southern highlands, and Tacna, on the border with Chile. This revealed marked differences in how the agrarian reform was portrayed at the time. For example, in the predominantly mestizo Piura the new agricultural cooperatives were presented as a means to embrace modernity and access a better quality of life, while in Cusco the reform was framed as a way of retuning the land to its original indigenous owners.\n\nHowever, government officials were also forced to question their cultural assumptions about different regional populations. For example, the government’s vision of northern Peru as the site of large agro-industrial complexes did not take account of the great internal diversity of a region like Piura, the continued importance of communal identities (an idea the government associated almost exclusively with the southern highlands), nor the impact of migration flows between highland and coastal areas. Similarly in Cusco, officials assumed the region’s history of peasant unions and indigenous communal traditions would lead to strong support for agricultural cooperatives. But the ideas of collectivised production embodied in the government’s cooperative model often did not sit well with understandings of community and reciprocal labour in the highlands.\n\nAs well as enriching our understanding of the agrarian reform process in each of these regions, the book therefore tells a bigger story about the relationship between central government and the regions, how the idea of the region is consolidated and reshaped through state practice, and the challenges of establishing political hegemony in the context of great regional diversity.\n\nIn 1886, a frost descended on the north-western region of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, burning coffee harvests and ruining milpa fields. As newspaper editorials and court records attest, Altaverapance Mayas and Ladinos (non-Mayas) understood the frost as the work of the mountain deity Xucaneb seeking revenge for “the evils of coffee production and private property.” In the weeks leading up to the frost, Juan de la Cruz, a ladino tailor, led a group of Mayas in a series of rituals and pilgrimages to the mountain deity to illicit his goodwill. As a result, when the frost struck the region, many Altaverapacences believed that Juan de la Cruz and his accomplices had unleashed the forces of the most powerful mountain deity in the region to right the moral wrongs of coerced labour and land privatization. Subsequently, many rural Mayas fled their indebted labour obligations on coffee plantations, while state officials invaded the homes of urban Mayas, confiscated weapons, and sent armed militias into the countryside.\n\nThe 1886 frost and its aftermath reveal the vivid historical agency of non-human actors like mountain spirits in the shaping of events, and rural Maya responses reveal the importance of other conceptions of time as cyclical and guided by non-human forces. As Mayas fled to the forested mountainsides, we can also speculate that these fugitives might have sought to build alternative political futures beyond the eyes of the state and coffee planters. State responses, on the other hand, make vivid another potent rendering of time. In the aftermath of Xucaneb’s revenge, state officials and coffee planters alike declared the need to force rural Mayas to labour on coffee plantations, because such events demonstrated that they were not yet ready for free wage labour. Across the nineteenth century, state officials, intellectuals, coffee planters and others frequently countered Mayas’ efforts to build different kinds of modernities by declaring that Mayas were not yet civilized, and thus not ready for full citizenship and free wage labour, for example. By locating Mayas on the unfavourable end of a temporal scheme that categorized people into uncivilized racial others and modern racially whitened citizens, some Guatemalan elites consistently postponed Maya citizenship to an unknown point in the future. The declaration that Mayas were anachronistic in the nation thus had far-ranging political consequences, in practice that I term the politics of postponement.\n\nOur Time is Now: Race and Modernity in Postcolonial Guatemala traces struggles over time, race, and modernity among Mayas, ladinos, and German settlers in the region of Alta Verapaz across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Written as a multi-vocal narrative, this book tells the story of the making of Alta Verapaz, and Guatemala more broadly, across nearly a century as a struggle between different political ontologies and different renderings of time. The first half of the book “Translating Modernities” addresses the period from 1860s to 1914 and traces conflicts over race, labour, and the making of racial capitalism and the politics of postponement. The second half of the book “Aspirations and Anxieties of Unfulfilled Modernities” covers the period from 1908 to 1954 and examines how the wrought contradictions of the politics of postponement and capitalism in the region played out in populist dictatorship, democratic experiments, and revolution. In the process, Our Time is Now centres Maya political ontologies in order to understand the formation of the racial capitalism and the Guatemalan state with enduring legacies in the present."
