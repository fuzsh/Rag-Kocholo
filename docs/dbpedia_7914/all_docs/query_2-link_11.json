        "text": "This is an article written by a fellow blogger Peter Bell. I am republishing it on my site and Peter explains how he has changed his mind and now accepts that Scotland is treated as a colony by Westminster. What is great about this is Peter explains what changed his mind and the processes that he went through on his journey. His honesty is refreshing and deserves the widest audience.\n\nThe new thinking\n\n“THE NEW THINKING”\n\nby Peter A Bell\n\nThere is, I venture to state, a widespread if not general acceptance within the Yes movement that one of the positives of the 2014 referendum campaign was the normalisation of the word ‘independence’ – even if the actual concept was little examined. A term that had previously been consigned to the ideological fringe found currency in mainstream political discourse – there to remain. It might also be suggested that there was some normalisation, too, of the word ‘referendum’; and thereby of the idea of direct democracy. Again, there was little discussion of what a proper constitutional referendum should look like. And the idea of a referendum was not much linked to the wider concept of direct democracy. But it can hardly be denied that the referendum campaign had a normalising effect. I confidently contend that we are seeing a similar normalisation process in relation to other words and the ideas associated with them.\n\nI offer three examples of terms and concepts which have only lately entered the lexicon of the debate around the constitutional issue. I also contend that the process of normalisation in these instances has been both remarkably rapid in some quarters and inexplicably slow in others. The three terms are, in no particular order, ‘unilateral declaration of independence (UDI)’; ‘colony’; and ‘liberation’.\n\n#ScottishUDI\n\nI have previously written, and frequently spoken, of my (pleasant) surprise when I presented my thoughts on UDI to the Scottish Sovereignty Research Group (SSRG) Conference almost exactly a year ago (29 August 2022). I had expected considerable resistance to the idea, even if the audience was too sophisticated for the all-too-common knee-jerk reaction to the term ‘UDI’ that is the product of years of conditioning. I was taken aback by the response which actually greeted my remarks. Respectful if scowling silence while I spoke might have been the best I thought might be expected. In fact, what I saw was people nodding in agreement. There was even the odd smattering of applause, if I recall aright.\n\nIn the year since then, I have seen further confirmation of the normalisation of the idea of #ScottishUDI. There is even some agreement with my stated view that #ScottishUDI is the only way Scotland’s independence will be restored. We may be getting to the stage where it is those who react with the ‘traditional’ negativity who look outdated in their thinking. Or, to put it another way, they have yet to catch up with the new thinking on the constitutional question.\n\nScotland the colony\n\nWhile I might justifiably claim some small credit for contributing to the normalisation of ‘UDI’, there can be no disputing where credit goes for normalisation of the idea of Scotland as a colony of England-as-Britain. Professor Alf Baird’s work demonstrating the applicability of the term ‘colony’ to Scotland has been hugely influential. I can testify to this as I am of those who have been hugely influenced.\n\nI was long resistant to suggestions that Scotland has been colonised. But as I read Alf Baird’s arguments, I found myself quite unable to refute them. Everything that he says about what constitutes a colony I recognised as applying to Scotland.\n\nColonialism is not that difficult to understand. Colonialism is first and foremost economic plunder. Everything is taken from the country cheaply – oil & gas, energy, aggregates, food, whisky – with goods sold back to the natives at higher cost. The role of a colony is primarily to serve the needs of the mother country, in this case England.\n\nScotland’s Colonial Status\n\nI was, and remain, uncomfortable with some aspects of Alf Baird’s argument. Particularly his observation that “settler occupation” is a defining characteristic of colonisation and that this holds true for Scotland as elsewhere. While I may find this unsettling, it is impossible when confronted with the facts to dispute that demographics represent a significant factor affecting measured support for restoration of independence versus retention of the Union. Nor can it sensibly be denied that this significance is increasing. Whether it is a purposeful colonising ploy really doesn’t matter. Deliberate or coincidental, the impact on Scotland’s cause remains the same.\n\nThis is an issue that has to be approached with a great deal of sensitivity. But we owe a debt of gratitude to Alf Baird for bringing it into the light. For too long, there have been aspects of Scotland’s predicament which were held to be taboo topics by supporters as well as opponents of Scotland’s cause. Such matters must not be left to fester. They must be confronted and debated – hopefully with less than the customary vitriol. That is why it is so important that these terms and the ideas to which they refer are normalised. That this seems to be happening is one of the more promising portents for Scotland’s cause.\n\nLiberation\n\nJust as I flinched from the idea of Scotland as a colony, so I was reluctant to accept the suggestion that the people of Scotland are unfree implied by use of the term ‘liberation’. I recognise that oppression can take many forms and need not involve violent coercion to be defined as such. Even if there is a sense in which people in Scotland are placed in a sort of captivity by the Union, nobody in Scotland feels confined or constrained in a way that would commonly be associated with oppression. They sure as hell don’t feel enslaved!\n\nMy attitude to the term ‘liberation’. changed dramatically as I came to recognise that it was not the people per se who were the captives of colonisation but Scotland’s political and cultural institutions. It is our government and our parliament and our civil service and our language and our media and our history which have been captured in a process of surreptitious colonisation over a period of three centuries and more. It is these institutions which demand to be liberated if Scotland is to be a normal independent nation.\n\nWhen we talk of colonised minds, we refer to the long-term effect of the capture of all the fundamental apparatus of one nation by another. This effect is inevitable, insidious and intellectually incapacitating in that the colonised mind can only think like a colonised mind while vigorously rejecting the suggestion that it has been colonised. The grip of the coloniser is broken, but not completely removed, when the capacity to think outside the wee British box is triggered; often by some sudden realisation in the course of debate; either as a participant or as an observer. The process of decolonisation of the mind begins here. It can be a protracted process with many setbacks. A process which is different for every individual.\n\nI would hypothesise that for those affected, decolonisation of the mind is a process which is never completed. Generations may have to pass before the effect of colonisation of the mind is eradicated from Scotland’s population. People will have to be born and live their lives in an environment of liberated political and cultural institutions in order to have the possibility of being free of the effects of three centuries of creeping colonisation. Even then, they are likely to be ‘infected’ by the still partially colonized minds of parents and other older people in their environment.\n\nIt stands to reason that normalisation of the term and idea of liberation is essential if enough minds are to be sufficiently decolonised to recognise that the basic apparatus of Scotland the nation has been captured by a foreign power and fight to restore all our political and cultural institutions to the service of Scotland and its people rather than the ruling elites of England-as-Britain. That this normalisation appears to be happening is, therefore, a promising sign. For this, we have once again to thank Alf Baird. But also, Sara Salyers and everyone else involved with Salvo and Liberation Scotland and, of course, the Stirling Directive, even if the latter involves some very muted blowing of my own trumpet as a member of the groups which drafted the Stirling Directive.\n\nThe new thinking\n\nWhat is discussed and described above is what I call the new thinking in relation to Scotland’s constitutional issue. The terms and concepts referred to are all essential components of this new thinking. Unfortunately, the capacity to reconceptualise Scotland’s cause in any meaningful way totally eludes Scotland’s own political establishment. With vanishingly rare exceptions, all the Scottish (not British) politicians and parties defer to the alien concept of parliamentary sovereignty even while mouthing the sovereignty of Scotland’s people as if that concept were nothing more than an electoral campaign slogan. All this implies is that the process of retaking the institutions which define our distinctive political culture and national identity must be driven by the people.\n\nThis, too, is part of the new thinking. Thanks to the research undertaken by Sara Salyers and others, we now know that the “legal and constitutional” route to independence exists. That it does not exist in the legal and constitutional framework imposed on Scotland by the colonising power should not be at all surprising. I shall eschew further comment on those who maintained that this non-existent route was the democratic “gold standard”. I shall even restrain myself from passing judgement on those who yet adhere to this ‘old thinking’ despite all the real-world developments which point up the idiocy of doing so. That the “legal and constitutional” route does exist in Scotland’s own legal and constitutional environment will be news to most people, I suspect. It certainly was a revelation to me.\n\nMy hope is that this new thinking will spread and gain traction such that not even the politicians who are well-practised in turning a deaf ear and blind eye to the people are unable to brush it off in their customary high-handed fashion. How else might Scotland be rescued from colonisation?\n\nPETER BELL\n\nMY COMMENTS\n\nI would suggest the true success in politics is changing minds, not easy, but possible and very welcome. Salvo/ Liberation have changed a lot of minds in the last year and even more importantly opened a lot of minds to welcome the flood of information and argument that demonstrates the colonial status of our country under a thieves of Westminster who plunder our assets relentlessly each day. Join with us as we expand our organisation. There is still much to do.\n\nBEAT THE CENSORS\n\nRegretfully a number of pro Indy sites operate on the basis of censoring and blocking messages from other pro Indy sites that do not slavishly follow one particular Party. To overcome this attack on curtailing freedom of speech many of my readers share my articles to negate this censorship. My thanks for doing so.\n\nFREE SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nFree subscriptions are available on the Home and Blog pages of this site. This allows,for an email of each article to your Inbox and that is now how several thousands get my articles each day. This avoids problems that some have experienced gaining access from Twitter and Facebook. You will be very welcome to choose whatever route works best for you.\n\nSALVO\n\nThe work and important development of Salvo has been a beacon of hope and as it develops Salvo is creating campaigning hubs throughout Scotland. Salvo will join with Liberation.Scot and as the campaigning arm of Liberation we are looking at very effective campaigns. This requires money so all donations to this site, once the running costs are covered, will go to support the work of Salvo/ Liberation. I think you will see it well used and effective. Donations are currently limited to £3\n\nLIBERATION.SCOT\n\nWe are seeking to build Liberation.Scot to at least 100,000 signatures just as quickly as we can. This is part of our plan to win recognition as an official Liberation Movement via the United Nations. We intend to internationalise our battle to win Independence and through the setting up of our Scottish National Congress will prepare and develop our arguments to win progress in the International Courts. Please help by signing up at Liberation.Scot. It is from those who sign up to Liberation.Scot that the membership of the SNC will be created by ballot."
