        "text": "Robert Graham (1735 – 11 December 1797), who took the name Bontine in 1770 and Cunninghame Graham in 1796, was a Scottish politician and poet. He is now remembered for a poem If doughty deeds my lady please, which was later set to music by his great-great-grandson, Rev. Malise Cunninghame Graham and also by Sir Arthur Sullivan.\n\nEarly life\n\nRobert, the second son of Nicol Graham of Gartmore and Lady Margaret Cunningham, was born at Gartmore, Perthshire, and educated, along with his elder brother William, at the University of Glasgow (matriculating under Professor Andrew Rosse).\n\nHe spent much of his early life in Jamaica, where he was a planter, slave-owner and merchant, and became Receiver-General for Taxes in 1753 and profited from his involvement in sugar plantations in the Caribbean.\n\nSlave holder in Jamaica\n\nGraham writes in his letters of numerous liaisons with enslaved women and this infers he is likely to have fathered children by them.\n\nAs a wealthy businessman, Cunninghame acquired enslaved people as domestic servants, oversaw large groups of enslaved plantation workers and later sold the enslaved people he 'owned' when he and Anne Taylor returned to Scotland.\n\nIn 1752, Graham left Britain for the Colony of Jamaica, where he was a slave-owner, landowner and planter, politician, and public servant until 1770. By 1753, aged 18, he was the receiver-general of taxes.\n\nGraham represented the parish of St David in the Assembly of Jamaica (1765–67).\n\nBy 1770, he left Jamaica for Britain and became laird of Ardoch in Dunbartonshire. He had succeeded to the estate, (entailed upon him in 1757), on the death of his second cousin William Bontine in the late 1760s.\n\nFamily and marriage\n\nWhile in Jamaica, Graham married Anne Taylor, sister of Sir John Taylor Baronet of Lyssons Hall, in 1764 (as recorded in the Cunninghame Graham Family Bible) and Simon Taylor, one of Jamaica's wealthiest merchants and plantation-owners.\n\nHe built the current Ardoch House (near Dumbarton) in colonial style for Anne.\n\nAnne died in December 1780, leaving two daughters and two sons. He secondly married Elizabeth Buchanan circa 1783, by whom he had a further son and daughter; they separated in 1787 and divorced in 1789.\n\nProperty\n\nHe changed name twice; firstly, under the terms of an entail by which he inherited the Ardoch estate from William Bontine, he took the surname Bontine until his father died. Secondly, in line with the 1709 entail of William 12th Earl of Glencairn, he assumed the name and arms of Cunninghame, in addition to those of Graham, on the death in 1796 of Maj. Gen. John Cunninghame, 15th Earl of Glencairn and last in line.\n\nFrom him Robert inherited the Finlaystone estate, so that he is often known as Robert Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore and Finlaystone. At his death, his estates stretched from Perthshire (Gartmore & Kippen), through Dunbartonshire (Galingad & Ardoch) and across the Clyde to Renfrewshire (Finlaystone); in addition he held the lands of Lochwood in Lanarkshire and his Jamaican plantation at Roaring River.\n\nPolitical career\n\nGraham was elected a Member of Parliament, representing Stirlingshire, in 1794. He was a pro-Jacobin of that time, and identified as a Radical. During his time in the House he attempted to introduce a Bill of Rights which foreshadowed the Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nHe was a close friend of Thomas Sheridan, Charles James Fox, Sir Thomas Dundas (later 1st Baron Dundas) and the poet Hector McNeil.\n\nGraham was appointed Rector of the University of Glasgow, holding the position from 1785 to 1787, in which year he instituted the Gartmore Gold Medal (awarded biennially) for the best discourse by a student on political liberty.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nIn later life he suffered from frequent bouts of gout in the organs. He died at Gartmore on 4 December 1797 and was interred in the Gartmore family burial ground.\n\nRobert Burns – whose patron James, 14th Earl of Glencairn, was Graham's first cousin – writing to the Edinburgh bookseller, Mr Hill, describes Graham as: \"...the noblest instance of great talents, great fortune and great worth that ever I saw in conjunction.\"\n\nDescendants\n\nGraham's great-great-grandson, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham was a writer, journalist and adventurer. He was also a notable politician, being a Liberal Party MP. and a founder of both the Scottish Labour Party and the National Party of Scotland."
