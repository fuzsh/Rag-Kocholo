A fresh survey of the mythos and history of the Grahams through the ages, including the family’s origins, heraldry, heroes and villains. Genetic genealogy is used to untangle the family’s origin myths and main branches, encompassing both the noble house of Montrose and the bandit “reivers” of the Anglo-Scottish border. The heady mix of history and science is complemented by an original – and at times irreverent – biographical examination of some illustrious and nefarious Grahams. \n \n[Update Jan 2022: The book's prediction (p.31-34) that the Y-haplogroup of the \"noble Grahams\" would be I-M253 (Type 2) has now been confirmed; FT-DNA kit IN108665.]",
