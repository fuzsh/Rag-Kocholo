        "text": "Chapter II\n\n“And isn't your life extremely flat\n\nWith nothing whatever to grumble at!”\n\n-------------------------------\n\nDating from c. 1887, this poster, found in the archives of the National Action - Integralist Party, shows an early Conservative response opposing Joseph Chamberlain's efforts to 'bait' an uneasy electorate.​\n\n“Salisbury had enjoyed a remarkable string of good fortune by the summer of 1886. Returned as Prime Minister after two successive general elections, Conservative dominance over the British political system now seemed absolute. Salisbury, possessed of an apparently inherent ability to gather respect from the entirety of the party faithful, believed this to have been vital in his successful election campaign of 1886, where the solidity of Conservative unity provided the electorate with a firm contrast with Liberal infighting and recriminations. Support ranged from traditionalists, represented by figures such such the Duke of Richmond, to radicals associated with the quartet of the so-called \"Fourth Party\" all rallied around the Prime Minister. For many commentators, this stood in marked difference to the practically leaderless opposition party which was still reeling from the sudden resignation of the Earl of Leith.\n\nAlthough Salisbury was now in possession of a parliamentary majority, it was still weak enough to make Randolph Churchill’s position as Leader of the House of Commons one of the most challenging ones in the Cabinet. This was all the more obvious given the poor relations that the founder of “Tory Democracy” had with his more reactionary backbenchers, who now had to endure the sight of one of their most trenchant critics accusing them of disloyalty every time they made grumblings regarding any of Sailsbury’s hesitant social reform bills. The Local Government Act passed in September only with the assistance of dissident Liberals, and Churchill was unable to reconcile his love for Commons debate (with Salisbury in the Lords, Churchill was the most senior Conservative in the lower chamber) with a desire to bring about the social reforms he craved to introduce in Opposition.\n\nSalisbury, wary of the message that would have been sent by Churchill’s mooted resignation, decided to move his most dedicated radical to the Treasury in October of that year, with John Gorst, Churchill’s former ally in the opposition replacing him as Common’s Leader. The Prime Minister had little time for Gorst, who had irked many nonconformist voters after leading a procedural campaign to prevent the atheist MP Charles Bradlaugh from being sworn in as an MP 1880. Despite his trenchant Anglicanism, Sailsbury still viewed the incident as distasteful and had felt that it had entrenched the common view that Conservative Party was unwelcoming to prospective non-Anglican voters.\n\nHowever, Gorst’s expertise as a party organiser, which had been credited with having saved the party’s electoral fortunes following the retirement of the Earl of Beaconsfield, saved his career and the ambitions of the Tory modernisers in pushing for a more radical shake up of government housing policy. That a Conservative aristocrat was able to accommodate such radical voices within his Cabinet whilst maintaining the overwhelming support of the party establishment is a rarely stated truism of his political nuance and remains something that Salisbury deserves more credit for than he is oftentimes given.\"\n\n-From “Salisbury: A Life” by Abraham Roberts, MIPS Press 1994\n\nThe Liberal Party found itself in a moral and ideological quandary following the departure of Gladstone. A growing working class population, whilst far from being gifted with the franchise as a whole, increasing desired a radical voice that the two national parties seemed unwilling to give. Both led by Peers, the Liberals and Conservatives became seen as increasingly out of step with the radicalised voices of the literate artisan classes, who began to seek political solace in the growing voice of radicalised trade unionism. The Scottish miners, under the nominal leadership of Keir Hardie, had considered standing labour candidates for parliament after successful strike action in Ayreshire. With the local Conservative Associations crippled by the exponential growth of candidates standing on an explicitly trade union platform, it was Joseph Chamberlain’s “Radical League” that first mooted the principle of an “Anti-Conservative” Alliance in areas where the radical vote was split between Liberal and Trade Union candidates.\n\nIn reality of course, this usually meant that overtly socialist voices were silenced by the “useful lie” of the so-called “Lib-Lab Pacts.” In Wales, it was David Lloyd George, who had been converted to the Radical League’s cause after hearing Chamberlain speak in Birmingham, who began the association of nascent Welsh nationalism with Radical Liberalism. At the “Dinorwic Quarry Speech” in September 1886, Lloyd George introduced Chamberlain in his mother tongue, linking British patriotism with Welsh nationalism for the first time. The formation of Cymru Fydd (1886), the Welsh League for Social Democracy (1887) and Meibion Glyndŵr (1895) can all have their genesis traced to a speech given on the grey October morning in Snowdonia.\n\n-From “The Age of Expansionism” by Erich Hobsbawm, Abacus Books 1987\n\n“Chamberlain’s curious relationship with David Lloyd-George could fill a volume all by itself, the tale being one of almost Ovidian complexity. Whilst the early friendship between the two was certainly entirely platonic, it is quite clear from the various messages exchanged between the duo in the mid-eighties that they held a deep-set respect and admiration for one another, albeit in very much a paternal way. Witness the letter Chamberlain sent to the young solicitor several days after the twenty-three year old Lloyd George introduced Chamberlain at his “Quarry Speech” of 1886\n\n'The eloquence with which you held the crowd does you much credit. I believe that I have previously mentioned the unease I have with the expression of national sentiments that threaten the integrity of the Union, but, as I already expressed, I saw little sign of such disturbances in your speech yesterday. The preserve of ones heritage, especially amongst those working people who wish to learn and read together, is something that the Radical Movement must hold dear, lest they seek solace in more divisive movements.\n\nParnellism does not wish to build a political movement upon a cultural one, but rather desires separation for its own ends. That is clearly incompatible with the desires and principles of Radicalism, which can only survive if we impress upon all British subjects the principle of equal links with all members of the Empire.'​\n\nWhilst not stated explicitly, the principles that would later give rise to the Federalist wing of the Radical League’s platform can clearly be seen here, despite the obvious divergences that their careers would later take.”\n\n-From “The Chamberlain Dynasty” by J. E. Powell, Cambridge University Press 1955\n\n“The Liberal Party had always prided itself as being a united electoral force. Unlike the Conservative opposition, where the principle of individual consciousness maintained a minimalist approach for all but the most crucial of votes, Gladstone, Rosebery and Chamberlain all insisted on holding a system of tight party discipline. On most areas of legislation, such as Budget votes, this system fared very well. However, on more irrevocable constitutional matters, not least the notoriously prickly question of Irish Home Rule, the tightknit parliamentary structure risked bringing about schisms far easier than on the Conservative benches.\n\nFor Joseph Chamberlain, taking his “Birmingham Caucus” across the floor was a constant threat throughout Rosebery’s leadership. Arrangements with the Irish Parliamentary Party had been shelved when Gladstone had resigned, but it was never ruled out. Many traditional liberals, not least the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Childers, became increasingly vocal in their calls for Home Rule to become adopted as party policy, indeed, Childers had been elected as a “Liberal-Home Ruler” for Edinburgh South in the 1886 General Election. Outside Chamberlain’s stronghold in central England, the Home Rulers controlled a majority of local Liberal Associations, with Childers berating the Unionists as “spectres of petty self-interest” in a speech at Berwick in July of that year. Many Liberal activists saw Home Rule as presenting the best way of differentiating the party for the Conservatives, which held the Marquess of Salisbury as the acting as Parliament’s defender of the Union.\n\nAs the year wore on, with both Rosebery in the Lords and Harcourt in the Commons both failing to make any real impact upon the ascendant Conservative partnership between Randolph Churchill and Salisbury, most Liberal members began to speak in glowing terms about one man, to Childers intense frustration, it wasn’t him.”\n\n-From “’The Common Man Hath No Desire For An Aeroship!’ A History of Britain Since Gladstone” by A. P. G. Taylor, Oxford University Press, 1962\n\n“KINSALE INCIDENT: Minor national security and political scandal emerging following the interception of a weapons shipment by the Royal Irish Constabulary on 4th November 1886. The guns, believed to have been smuggled into the country by members representing a militant pro-independence force, were taken into Cork shortly afterwards to be destroyed. The unarmed police convoy was soon ambushed resulting in the recapture of most the shipment and the shooting of one police constable. The weapons were never recovered, although one was later recovered at the scene of a bank robbery in Tralee later that year.\n\nThe incident raised numerous questions over the competence of the RIC as well as prompting furious debate in Westminster regarding the Irish policy of the Salisbury government. After calling the incident “understandable, given the heterodox relationship between the civilian and military man in that part of the country,” the prominent Liberal MP Henry Labouchère was physically attacked by a Unionist mob in Trafalgar Square.”\n\nJoseph Chamberlain, then leader of the same faction of the Liberal Party, notably defended Labouchère, claiming that he was “misguided, but fundamentally a sound man,” greatly improving his relationship with the pro-Home Rule Radicals that had previously been allied against him. The incident is seen by some to have greatly aided his later career within the Liberal Party.\"\n\nSee Also: IRISH HOME RULE MOVEMENT, FEDERALIST ACT 1904, INDEPENDENT LIBERAL PARTY\"\n\n-From “The Encyclopaedia of British Politics, 5th Edition” by Jonathan Hopkin, Beaver Books 2005\n\nChapter III\n\n“If you wish in the world to advance,\n\nYour merits you're bound to enhance”\n\n-------------------------------\n\n​\n\nThe poster above advertises the highly acclaimed 1917 revival of the play at Sheffield's Lyceum Theatre. It is presented here with thanks to the Archives of the Sheffield Playhouses Group\n\n​\n\n“What Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham never lacked was a sense of prevailing destiny and ambition. Having stood twice for Parliament before the age of thirty-five, coming very close to election on both occasions, he moved to Glasgow, where his tales of cattle ranching in Patagonia, scandalous relationships with Latin beauties and gun smuggling to Mexican rebels all conspired to give him a mystique that was otherwise lacking in the dour world of Scottish parliamentarians.\n\nHaving almost been elected on a highly radical platform in Lanarkshire, in spite of the Conservative tide of 1886, it must provide little surprise that the colourful quarter-Spanish son of a minor Lowland aristocrat quickly attracted the attention of the radical section of the Liberal Party. Visiting Edinburgh close to Christmas of that year, Cunninghame Graham met a young David Lloyd George, then one of Joseph Chamberlain’s most vocal allies within the reform movement. In a rare event on the Radical Speaking Tour, Lloyd George found himself being heckled from the left by the debonair speaker, criticised for an alleged “betrayal of the basic principles of liberal and social justice” by Cunninghame Graham’s notoriously biting voice. Lloyd George, no doubt surprised by arousing the ire of one of a growing number of genuine socialists in Scotland, later visited him at the bar at the George Hotel. He learnt nothing but a name before being shooed away by the local magistrates.\n\nHaving come so close to being elected in a comparatively prosperous North Glasgow seat whilst standing on a platform which, amongst others aspects, called for the introduction of Scottish Home Rule, it is odd that Cunningham Graham would later become so involved with a political movement that was identified at the time with the leading voices against Irish Home Rule. Yet he was always a man who was prepared to reach amicable arrangements for people who shared his anti-Conservative feelings. On both attempts at fighting Lanarkshire North West, Cunningham Graham had almost been propelled to victory by an alliance of Liberals, Radicals and Socialists and was well aware of the benefits of what would later be termed “Popular Mandates.”\n\nIrish Home Rule was a matter close to Cunninghame Graham’s heart. A passionate supporter of Civil Rights, he engaged passionate feelings amongst the notoriously divided Glaswegian electorate. Adored by Catholics and loathed by Ulster-Scots, he was detained for three days in December 1886 after a fracas that followed a demonstration against the Coercion Acts. Visiting him in gaol, Lloyd George spoke with Cunningham Graham for well over three hours. By the end, whilst not converted to Imperial Reform, it is fair to state that the seed of an idea had been placed in the head of the errant Liberal, a matter that would take the best part of two decades to see fruition.”\n\n-From “The Federalists” by Ebenezer Skinner, Leeds Carnegie Press 1995\n\n“Despite misgivings over his personal life, Sir Charles Dilke was emerging as one of the most vocal supporters of Joseph Chamberlain in the House of Commons. In July 1885, he had been called to testify in a high-profile divorce case between fellow MP Donald Crawford and his wife Virginia. Dilke’s relationship with Virginia Crawford had originally been deemed irrelevant to the general case, but as the trial approached, some doubts over Dilke’s respectability began to emerge. At the time, most cases would have probably placed the onus of the affair entirely on the woman, yet Dilke’s position remained precarious.\n\nEarly in the trial, Justice Butt came close to dismissing Dilke from the case owing to limited allegations. As a close friend of Joseph Chamberlain, Dilke was naturally predisposed to request aid from his political ally. Chamberlain’s speaking tour disrupted communications between the two, with the event that little advice could be exchanged. In the end, this may have been beneficial, as Chamberlain later revealed that he would have advised Dilke to refuse to give evidence on the grounds of his other relationship with Virginia’s mother Ellen. Such an event may well have led to his dismissal from the case, opening up the real possibility of his being called to the trial in Virginia’s place, deprived of any real excuse not to testify.\n\nIn the end, the case collapsed in mid-March, with divorce between the Crawfords eventually coming the next year. Dilke emerged from the scandal with his reputation largely intact, although questions would continue to dog an otherwise successful political career. “\n\n-From “Selling a Pup: A History of the Radical Liberal Party” by Edward Jenkins, Rawlings and Co. 1972\n\n“Whilst Liberal MPs endlessly debated the Irish Question, in terms threatening and being threatened by expulsion, the British economy was in the depths of a business trough. In 1885, Salisbury was threatened enough by the poor economic climate to set up a Royal Commission on the Depression of Trade and Industry, which soon reported that well over half of all Chambers of Commerce within the United Kingdom felt that their local industries were in deep distress. By the end of the year, trade unions were complaining of an unemployment rate in excess of 10% and a demonstration of well over fifty-thousand labourers in March 1886 soon turned violent, with mobs sacking shops along Pall Mall and Piccadilly. “After such a disturbance and breakdown of police administration” wrote Octavia Hill in her diary on the 12th, “I wonder if one may now meet violence anywhere.”\n\nAt the heart of such disturbances, obviously, where the early Collectivist groups such as H. M. Hyndman’s Social Democratic Federation, founded in 1881. Anarchist groups had been moving to fill the gap in British terrorist caused by the reduction in Home Rule violence, and despite notable failures such as Martial Bourdin’s accidental self-detonation in Greenwich Park the previous February (later immortalised in Korzeniowski’s “The Assassin”) the fear of revolution only increased as the economic malaise continued to damage Salisbury’s government.\n\nRadical Liberals, led by Joseph Chamberlain, largely blamed the situation on the ‘unsound’ land system. Although a narrow view of a much wider problem, there is little doubt that the issue played a key role and the Conservative government was ill-helped by the likes of Henry Chaplin (better known as ‘The Squire’), who talked of agricultural protectionism that occasionally sounded dangerously close towards calling for a reintroduction of the Corn Laws. In an industrial society, British smallholdings were unable to compete with the vast prairie farms of the American Midwest, and demands for the government to make better use of the vast grain reserves of Canada moved from idle dinner party speculation to Parliamentary discussion as the decade wore on.”\n\n-From “’The Common Man Hath No Desire For An Aeroship!’ A History of Britain Since Gladstone” by A. P. G. Taylor, Oxford University Press, 1962\n\n\"Double Dealings; or, The Town Crier\" is a comic opera in two parts with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert and music by Arthur Sullivan. Premiering at the Savoy Theatre on 29th January 1887, it represents the tenth of fifteen such compositions between the highly successful creative partnership the two enjoyed.\n\nOriginally written shortly after the opening of the wildly successful \"The Mikado\" in 1885, \"Double Dealings\" was less well received on opening night in comparison to its predecessor, however, after some minor rewrites, it ran for 256 performances and produced a considerable profit.\n\nThe opera represented a return to the duo's traditional satires of British society in the style of \"Patience\" and \"Trial by Jury.\" After the aforementioned ribbing of the Judiciary and the Aesthetic Movement, it was local politics that was to be the recipient of Gilbert's acerbic wit, with the titular town crier being interpreted by many as a thinly veiled Joseph Chamberlain, then a leading Radical voice within the Liberal Party. Aspects of melodrama also filter into the script and stage layout.\n\nPart One opens with a young orphaned woman, Elizabeth Newrose, arriving in the Midlands market town of Millhaven, which stands in the shadow of a ruined castle. After being introduced to the locals by the wily Hugh Nettlejack, Elizabeth falls in love with the local area, seeing it as a world away from her home near the industrial heart of London. She proceeds to visit her aunt, Lady Geraldine, who informs her about the advances that the ambitious town crier, Jim Changemaker, has been putting on her to turn her estate, which includes the town and castle, over to the developers from the nearby city of Bullingdon.\n\nAfter being shown by a local youth, Piers Pilgrim, around the ruins of the nearby Norman fortress of St Olave's, Elizabeth is visited by the ghosts of previous inhabitants of the town, led by Baron Greybeard. They implore Elizabeth, who is stated to be \"Stout Of Heart And Pure Of Mind\" to protect their ancient home from development. Elizabeth leaves to parley with the town crier. Moments after she leaves, Hugh walks by and sees the ghosts. He flees, horrified.\n\nAfter Elizabeth returns to the market square, Changemaker arrives, holding council with the local property developers. He announces his plans to demolish St Olave's and replace it with a vast new municipal water tower, \"Fit For A Councilman Wanting It All!\" before being admonished by a furious Elizabeth. Hugh appears, yelling about the spectres in the castle. Changemaker orders him to be removed from his home, and chases him off stage as Elizabeth weeps.\n\nPart Two opens three weeks later, as Elizabeth sits, racked by misery in the nearby woods. Hugh returns, placing her mind at rest and claims that he has been living in the trunk of a vast oak tree. However, the reunion is cut short, Baron Greybeard re-emerges, stating that the ground will swallow up the whole of Millhaven if the castle is demolished. With only a day before the planned development begins, Elizabeth, Greybeard and Hugh lament their scenario, \"My Eyes Are Fully Open To Our Awful Situation\" before they covertly return to the town.\n\nElizabeth bumps into Piers, who claims that he has a plan to prevent the demolition of St Olave's. Working though the night, Hugh fashions a device to scare the construction workers away, whilst Piers and Elizabeth hunt for clues to take down Changemaker, who has finally tricked Lady Geraldine out of her estate.\n\nOn the day of the ground breaking ceremony, the entire local council arrives to observe the demolition of the castle. Moments before the Town Crier gives the order, Hugh finishes sawing away at a tree, which falls within inches of the local dignitaries, they fall in terror, thinking that the incident is a sign to stop their plans. Changemaker is not to be dissuade however, and plans to blow up the entire structure with explosive charges he has concealed in the castle walls.\n\nAt this point, Elizabeth and Piers arrive, followed by the ghosts who angrily berate the humbled town crier. He apologies, stating that his actual plan was merely a ruse to see if the curse was real and thus aid him in opening a tourist attraction for Americans. Besides, he sings “Why Have A Water Tower When A Reservoir Will Do?” The council members, livid at having had their lives put at risk, tear up their contract with Changemaker and return the land to Lady Geraldine as she returns, bearing news.\n\nShe states that Hugh is actually Elizabeth’s long-lost brother, spirited away at a young age. Elizabeth embraces him, having found both her brother and a new fiancée, Piers, in the same day. Baron Greybeard, his duty done, is returned to life and marries Lady Geraldine, who also gives Changemaker his job back, with the proviso that he restores the castle to its former beauty. The townspeople, councillors and reunited family all sing the finale, “The Blessed Calm of Matrimonial Yoke!” as Millhaven is restored to peace and quiet.\n\n-From “The Oxford Companion to English Music, Opera and Composers” by William H. Rehnquist, Oxford 1967\n\n“In early 1887, Lloyd George returned to London to co-ordinate the general workings of the Radical Liberals’ public operations in the capital. Taking the model of Disraeli’s Primrose League as a base point, coupled with Chamberlain’s “Radical Platform” released in July 1885, various discussion groups and meetings were organised by the leading supporters within the Liberal Party. Although competing against its well funded Conservative counterpart, a local chapter of the Radical Association was soon commonplace in every city and market town in England. Unlike the community focused and decentralised Primrose League, the RA’s took Chamberlain’s program as an official book of office, giving it an important advantage in spreading a coherent message to voters.\n\nLloyd George’s position and knowledge of his Welsh homeland also gave the Associations an important base outside Tory-dominated England. Hosting Welsh-language seminars on the principles of land reform, Liberal fortunes were revived in areas where they had appeared at risk of losing for a generation after the disastrous election of 1886. Lloyd George was held as instrumental in achieving this Liberal renaissance, although given the nonconformist heritage of the principality, it is likely that most of these areas would have swung back to the Liberal banner anyway.\n\nIt is around this time that Lloyd George began to see the advantage of seeking election himself. His prominent position within the Radicals gave him the ability to tour the country regularly, and he soon had offers of a seat by many Liberal Associations in Wales and the Midlands. Lloyd George remain uneasy at the idea of seeking one so early in his political career however, preferring as he stated in a letter to Thomas Ellis in March the, “autonomy of administration [which] suits me better, at present, than the collective nature of Commons loyalty.” In any case, he was uneasy at the idea of serving as an MP in any Party under the leadership of the Earl of Rosebery, who he disliked. Joseph Chamberlain clearly agreed with him, officially appointing him as Campaigns Officer of the Radical Association in April 1887, by which time Rosebery’s position as Party Leader was already under threat.”\n\n-From “Lloyd George: A Life for Land and Liberty” by Paul Murphy, University of Bangor Press 1997"
