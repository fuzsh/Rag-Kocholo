        "text": "Macfarlane Coat of Arms\n\n90.1 Early Clan History from www.scotweb.co.uk\n\nClan MacFarlane is a Highland Scottish clan. The clan claims a descent from the old line of the Earls of Lennox. The clan takes its name from a Malcolm MacFarlane, who lived in the fourteenth century. Clan MacFarlane took part in several conflicts and were loyal supporters of the Earls of Lennox. The clan was also noted for its raiding, and as such, it is said that the full moon was known as “MacFarlane’s Lantern”.\n\nThe ancestral lands of the clan were Arrochar, located at the head of Loch Long and further northwest of Loch Lomond. The lands of Arrochar were first granted to an ancestor of the clan in the thirteenth century, and were held by the chiefs until they were sold off for debts, in 1767. The last descendant of the chiefs, in the direct male line, died in 1886.\n\nIn the aftermath of the uprising, the English government decided to end the Jacobite military threat once and for all. Determined to bring the Highlands to heel, the army showed little mercy. Jacobites [and their sympathisers] were rounded up, imprisoned or executed. Estates were forfeited, the clan system dismantled and weaponry, plaid and pipes were outlawed. For Highland culture it was a disaster.\n\nHowever, it was not an unmitigated disaster for the whole of Scotland. For the Lowland Presbyterians the defeat of the Jacobites was a cause for celebration. The Union and the Presbyterian system of church government were safe. In the south, economic progress was increasingly viewed as the way forward. The failure of the ’45 rising was nothing less than the passing of a way of life which is now romanticised and celebrated all over the world as the spirit of Scottish culture, yet what few people recognise today is that there were many people living in Scotland at the time who, for religious or economic reasons, wanted this passing.\n\nThe Jacobite army passed through Perthshire close to the lands occupied by the Macfarlanes. We do not know their thoughts about the uprising, but they were Presbyterians, so were unlikely to have thrown their support behind the Catholic Prince Charles. Also, the fact that William Macfarlane b1787 became an officer in the English army, demonstrates that they did not seem to hold any resentment against the English. In addition, in the late 1700's and 1800's, the fortunes of many members of the family flourished, as they took advantage of booming economic conditions that developed in southern Scotland. See the various diagrams in this chapter showing how members of the Macfarlane family fit into our extended family tree.\n\nThe extracts below, from the Lamb family website, are interesting. They explain that for a time, the name Macfarlane was proscribed and family members adopted other names during this time. This may explain the lack of records for John Macfarlane’s ancestors. They also tell us that there were Macfarlanes living near the Bridge of Frew, which was just 4 miles south of Borland. GGGGF John Macfarlane b1785 married GGGGM Janet Forrester of The Bridge of Frew in 1810 (See Forrester Section of the Blog).\n\nThe history of the Clan Macfarlane goes back to the 13th century when Gilchrist, a son of the Earl of Lennox, obtained a charter to the lands of Arrochar, which lie to the west of Loch Lomond. From Gilchrist's grandson, Parlan or Farlan, the clan took its name, Macfarlane.\n\nThe lands of Arrochar included Loch Sloy/Sloidh, a small loch between Loch Lomond and Loch Long. The name Loch Sloy became the clan's battle cry. Involved in many clan wars during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Macfarlanes were proscribed, being deprived of both their land and the use of their clan name. The proscription was lifted in the 18th century and many resumed the name Macfarlane. Others kept the surnames they had adopted during the years of proscription. This accounts for the many septs of the Macfarlane Clan [and why some adopted the surnames Farlan or Farland].\n\nDuring these troublesome times, some Macfarlanes moved to Perthshire where their descendants are found in the parishes of Menteith. The earliest records of Macfarlanes are in the Parish of Kilmadock when Archibald, son of Walter Farlan, was baptized in 1623. A second son, Dugall, was baptized in 1627. In the early 17th century, the spelling Farlan was used. Later, Farlan became McFarlan; then Macfarlane by the 18th century.\n\nThe Macfarlanes of Mid Frew (from the Lamb family Website)\n\nThere were several farms along the narrow strip of land between Goodie Water and the edge of the moss covering the Forth, including Easter Frew, Mid Frew and Wester Frew. It was thought this area, called the Fords of Frew on an early map, was the site of several ancient fords before the moss covered them. Here the moss itself was not very deep, providing a sort of underwater causeway across to the south side. Even so, these crossings could only be used in late summer and fall when the water levels were at their lowest. Men and animals were roped together for safety. This risky crossing was favoured by the McGregor clan who knew the route and used it when taking their cattle to market.\n\nA family living in the Parish of Kilmadock close to the Bridge of Goodie were the Macfarlanes of Mid Frew. Mid Frew on the south side of the Bridge of Goodie was the home of John Macfarlane and his wife, Elizabeth Stewart, who were married in 1781. No earlier records of their baptisms were found in the Parish of Kilmadock. Their six children, all born at Mid Frew, were baptized in the Parish of Kilmadock: John in 1782, Elizabeth in 1783, Agnes in 1786, Kathrine in 1788, John in 1790 and Margaret in 1792. Elizabeth Macfarlane grew up at Mid Frew and married James Lamb, of Falkirk, in 1809.\n\nFor James Lamb and Elizabeth Macfarlane the year 1809 began with the proclamation of their intention to marry. The entry in the parochial register of the Parish of Kilmadock reads: 1st January 1809, James Lamb, in the Parish of Falkirk and Elisabeth Mcfarlan (sic) in this parish, declared their purpose of marriage and were married. The proclamation was also entered in the parochial register of the Parish of Falkirk, January 8th, 1809, James Lamb in this parish and Elizabeth Macfarlane in the parish of Kilmadock. In 1831, James Lamb and Elizabeth Macfarlane and their seven children, John 21 years old, Helen 17, William 15, Ann 13, Margaret 10, Janet 7 and James, almost 3 years old, sailed for Montreal and Upper Canada.\n\nNote: Our Forrester Family relatives lived at the Bridge of Frew and would have known the Macfarlane family described above.\n\nToday nothing remains of what was once Kilmahog ... just a few shops, a famous pub, some ruins. Behind the pub, we can see the remains of an old stone tower. This was once part of the parish church of Kilmahog, with a cemetery that was used until Victorian times. There are some interesting old tombs here, but nowadays the cemetery is more or less wild, with very little human attention.\n\n94.2a Will of James Macfarlane of Luggiebank (Abbreviated)\n\nJames Macfarlane's will, inventory and Notorial Disposition were recorded by the courts on 20 Nov 1848. According to an inventory presented by James' brother William Macfarlane on 18 Nov 1848, James' assets included\n\nBrother William described himself as William Macfarlane of Shirva sometime Coal and Lime Merchant and as sole executor of James' will, he had executed a deed of settlement of James' assets on 17 June 1736. Also presented was a disposition written by James that said\n\n\"I James Macfarlane of Luggiebank (state that) there never was any contract of marriage entered into between Mrs (sic) Janet Stevenson my spouse and me and that there are no children procreated of our marriage, therefore and for other good causes .... with ... the special advice of the said Janet Stevenson and I the said Janet Stevenson for myself hereby give, grant, assign, and dispone to and in favor of myself the said James Macfarlane and the heirs of my body whom failing to William Macfarlane Coal and Lime merchant at Muckcroft my brother and to his heirs all and sundry lands, bonds, bills, rents, decreets, accounts, goods and gear and all other estates that pertain to me at the time of my death namely\n\n1. In the First Place pay my debts and funeral expenses\n\n2. Secondly my disponees shall be bound to make payment to the said Janet Stevenson my spouse of a yearly annuity of £80 so long as she stays my widow as well as my household furniture and silverware. If she should remarry the annuity shall cease but she may keep the household effects.\n\n3. Thirdly In the event of me dying without issue the said William Macfarlane shall make payment to my brother Robert Macfarlane and sister Mary/Marg. Macfarlane a yearly annuity of £10\n\n4. Fourthly In the event of me dying without issue my brother William Macfarlane shall pay my sister Janet Macfarlane, spouse of Robert Kincaid (m.1824) farmer of Gartmore, and to her heirs a legacy of £20.\n\nThe above annuities and legacy are hereby declared to be in full and all that they can ask or claim through my death and on payment they shall be bound to grant a receipt.\" The will was dated 17 June 1836 and signed by both James and spouse Janet.\n\nNOTE 1: The use of the phrase 'in the event of me dying without issue' in this case was probably placed in the will as a matter of convention. James and Janet both agreed that there were no children involved and as the will was written shortly before his death, it was very unlikely that there would be any children.\n\nNOTE 2: James named several people in his will. The notes below are an attempt to identify them\n\nJohn and Isabella McQueen nee Macfarlane appear to have had at least four children; Mary McQueen b1802, Margaret McQueen b1805, John McQueen c1810 and Catherine McQueen b1814 (when Isabella was 40). Isabella's brother, William Macfarlane, only made provision for children John McQueen and Catherine McQueen in his will, which suggests Catherine's older two daughters, Mary and Margaret who had been baptised at Kincardine, died before 1851.\n\nSarah was baptised on the 4 Apr 1777 at Port of Menteith, Perthshire. No other records have been found for Sarah so she may have died as an infant.\n\n94.7 Robert Macfarlane (1782–c1840)\n\nRobert was baptised on the 1 May 1782 at Port of Menteith, Perthshire. In 1836 Robert was nominated as a beneficiary in his brother James' will. He was not listed in the 1841 census, nor in brother William's will in 1851 so he probably died around 1840.\n\n94.8 GGGGF John Macfarlane (1785-1830)\n\nAt the age of 35, Agnes married Lieutenant Donald Robertson 38 on 19 Apr 1824 at Thornhill a mile or two from Borland Farm. Being in her late thirties when she was married, may also have made it difficult for her to conceive children.\n\nAn undated letter attached to Donald's military record signed by John Lommens, minister of the chapel at Norriston stated that \"At Thornhill in Monteith on 19 Apr 1824 Donald Robertson Lieutenant on half pay of the 82 Regiment and Miss Agnes Macfarlane.... were married by me....\". The reverse of this letter was witnessed by Mr John Macfarlane, Mrs Catherine Macfarlane, Miss Jess G Robertson and Miss Janet Robertson. As John Macfarlane senior b1742 had died in 1814 the Macfarlane witnesses must have been Agnes' brother John Macfarlane b1785 and her mother Mrs Catherine Macfarlane nee Graham. There is some mystery about who the two Miss Robertson cousins were (See 95.4b).\n\nDonald's service record lists military activities from 1809 to 1817 but does not specify details of these. A letter dated 2 Mar 1849 providing evidence of the marriage signed by the Minister of Port of Menteith, Alex Turner (Church of Scotland) is also in the file and was required before a pension could be granted to Agnes.\n\nAgnes' mother died in 1828 and Agnes was appointed sole executrix and sol beneficiary. The reason given was that\"my other children are already sufficiently provided for\". Agnes Robertson of Dunoon, Glasgow, lodged an inventory of the personal estate belonging to her mother many years later, in Feb 1849. The estate included \"all and sundry tacks, bonds, bills, goods, gear, plate, jewels …..?, debts, sums of money, household furniture and plenishing, and whole other subjects, effects, means and estate of whatever kind or denomination presently pertaining and belonging or that shall pertain and belong or be indebted and resting owing to me at the time of my death nothing excepted or reserved with the whole vouchers and instructions of my said means and estate and all action and execution competent thereupon dispensing with the generality hereof and admitting and declaring these presents to be as valid and effectualto all extent and purposes as if every particular generally above conveyed were herein specifically.\"\n\nAt the time of the 1841 census, Agnes 55 (b1786) and Donald Robertson 55 b1786 were living at Luggie Bank, Kirkintillock with Agnes’ brother William Mcfarlan 54 (occupation unreadable but looks like 'menef', perhaps manufacturer?). Donald's occupation was listed as H.P, which may be a miswriting of 'A.P.' the abbreviation for Army Pension? Also in the residence were Catherine McQueen 26 (niece b1814, daughter of sister Isobel), Ann McMee 25 servant, Janet Ferguson 17 servant and Colin Fauld 17 servant, most of whom were mentioned in William's will ten years later.\n\nLieut. Donald Robertson died at their Slatefield home on 1 Nov 1848 aged 62 (b1786). At the time he had been receiving an army pension on half pay and Agnes put in an application (above) to receive a widow's pension on 17 Feb 1849. She stated the place of marriage to be Thornhill, Menteith, Perthshire.\n\nAgnes Robertson nee Macfarlane, widow of the late Lieut. Donald Robertson, died on the 5 Jun 1859 at Slatefield, Dunoon, Argylshire with a given age of 75 (b1784). Her death registration was quite detailed, but frustratingly gives very little information about her husband, apart from stating that she was the widow of 'a military officer'. It confirms her parents were John Macfarlane, deceased farmer and Catherine Graham deceased. Cause of death was cardiac arrest, and she was buried in the churchyard at Dunoon. The 'informant' was the husband of her niece Catherine Hardie nee Macfarlane, William Hardie of Ross Farm, Belford Parish, Northumberland.\n\nJanet Macfarlane married Robert Kincaid (c1785-1868) of Campsie in 1824 at Campsie, about 20m south of Port of Menteith and Gartmore. The wording in the record says, \"Robert Kincaid and Janet Macfarlane both of this Parish (Campsie) owned their irregular marriage to the session and were admonished.\" Unlike some other entries there is no confirmation of an official wedding. Children born to the couple were John Kincaid 1825, Robert Kincaid 1827-1843, Mary Kincaid 1829, Janet Kincaid 1831 and twins James Macfarlane Kincaid 1834 and William Macfarlane Kincaid 1834-1868. All births were registered at Campsie. If Janet was around 40 for the last births she must have been born in the early 1790's.\n\nIn 1836, older brother James Macfarlane bequeathed a legacy of £20 to \"Janet Macfarlane spouse of Robert Kincaid farmer of Gartmore and her heirs\". According to a gravestone erected by son James Kincaid, Janet Macfarlane died later that year (1836).\n\nIn 1841 Robert Kincaid 50 farmer was living at Mains, Campsie with six of his children and four servants/labourers. In 1861 Robert 74, was living at the same location with his twin sons and granddaughter. In 1861 Robert Kincaid of Mains of Bencloich, Campsie was the victim of an attempted poisioning by Agnes Kirkwood (JC26/1861/155). Robert Kincaid died in 1868 and son William Macfarlane Kincaid died in 1868.\n\nWilliam of Bencloich, [and] Luggiebank was admitted to the Highland Agricultural Society in 1832. The membership list above shows that William had a commercial interest in Benloich. This membership entry was many years later and does not indicate he owned Bencloich as early as 1832. The reference to Alexander Macfarlane of Thornhill in the same record was not GGGF Alexander Macfarlane who was born in 1825 but may have been a relative.\n\nNOTE: The estate of Bencloich was sold by Sir Archibald Edmonstone to Charles Macintosh, Esq. and William Macfarlan, Esq. in 1834 (https://electricscotland.com). There is an interesting history with many anecdotes about Bencloich at https://archive.org/stream/parishcampsie. Unfortunately, it stops short of the Macfarlane era.\n\nC) Campsie estates of Sir Archibald Edmonstone\n\nWilliam’s will listed “Parts of the estate of Campsie acquired from Archibald Emondstone 1835” in his assets. (acquisition date varies). The Campsie estates of Sir Archibald Edmonstone of Duntreath were sold by his grandson in 1834. \"The remainder of the estate was sold to Captain Macfarlane of Luggiebank, Kirkintilloch, whose trustees sold it to Sir Charles Stirling, Bart., of Glorat.\" (From https://archive.org/stream/). In his will, Alexander Macfarlane refers to William as 'Captain Macfarlane', so he obviously went by that title sometimes.\n\nD) Saint Flannans, Shirva & Drumhill near Kirkintillock\n\nWilliam’s will listed “All of my lands and estate of Shirva and St Flannan on the south side of the Great Canal and known by the names of Drumhill and St Flannan and village of Tintock sometimes occupied by James and William Martin....Bounded on the north by the Great Canal, on the east by lands owned by Walter Ballantyne, on the south by property owned by John Murray Gartshore and on the west by property of James Duncan\".\n\nThe 1860 ordinance survey above listed the St Flannans and Drumhill properties as farm steadings, the property of Captain Macfarlane’s heirs. They were about two miles east of Kirkintillock. At around this time mining companies had expressed interest in the properties (see below) and they would later be developed into significant coal mines in the early 1900’s. Although the mines closed many years ago there are still ruins marking the location of the mines.\n\nThe website www.durtnall.org.uk/DEEDS/ lists a document which is an \"agreement between trustees of William Macfarlan Esq of Bencloich and Luggiebank 1859 on the one part and Graham Hardie and Henry Hardie, coal masters (on the other part) to execute a lease in favour of the second parties of the \"Lands of Saint Flannans and Drumhill. Regards to the working and carrying away of minerals in said lands and to the sinking of pits and performing the operations necessary for that purpose. To bring up said minerals and more.\" This contract was agreed to after William's death and we know from GGGF Alexander Macfarlan's will that he was a trustee of William's estate, so he would have authorised the agreement.\n\nE) Luggiebank, Kirkintillock\n\nWilliam’s will listed “All and whole of my lands known as Luggiebank acquired from William Macfarlane (unrelated), Lime merchant at Muckroft 29 Sep 1838”.\n\nDumbartonshire Ordinance Survey 1860, has the above description of Luggiebank. The 'Directory to Gentlemen's Seats, Villages &c. in Scotland': includes in its 1843 listings the name of the resident “Macfarlane, William, Luggie Bank, Kirkintilloch, Dumbarton”.\n\nIn 'A Survey of Historic Gardens by East Dumbartonshire Council' a description of the Luggiebank property notes that \"The strategic location of the estate across the proposed routes for any trains carrying coal from the collieries to east of Kirkintillock to scows at the canal basin at Hillhead and the Campsie Railway allowed the owners additional income from selling land to the railways. The land was developed as a public park in the 1980's. Luggiebank House is now part of a mews housing development at the end of a short access road (Dun Park) off Redbrae Rd.\"\n\nThe report described Luggiebank House as, \"a typical small 18th century laird's house, which was visited by political radical Thomas Muir in 1792. The Macfarlanes (Captain William Macfarlane and later his nephew Alexander) who also owned Bencloich Estate in Campsie were the principal 19th century proprietors. Later owners included Dr Sam Henderson, a local GP, and the district newspaper, 'The Kirkintillock Herald'. The building was redeveloped as flats c.2000, with new-build mews-style housing causing a rear cul-de-sac.\"\n\n“Captain William Macfarlane (also owner of Shirva Farm, Kirkintillock]) had Bailie James Dalrymple of Woodhead as a factor to his advantage...Dalrymple managed to keep Luggiebank outside the burgh boundaries in 1881 and 1883..\" [and so reduce taxes due].\n\nWilliam Macfarlane knew James Dalrymple well as they were both Bailies for Kirtkinkillock in the 1840’s (above). Nephew Alexander Macfarlane who inherited Luggiebank must have also had a close relationship with Bailie James Dalrymple because he was a pallbearer at James’ funeral in 1901 (above).\n\n95.2 Later Life of William Macfarlane\n\nAt the time of the 1841 census (above) William was a resident at Luggie Bank, Kirkintillock, but his occupation is illegible. The household consisted of William Mcfarlan 54, occupation 'menef?'(manufacturer?), Donald Robertson 55 brother-in-law, occ 'A.P?' (Army Pension?), Agnes Robertson 55 sister, Catherine McQueen 20 niece (daughter of sister Isabella with age rounded down from 27), Ann McMee 25 servant, Janet Ferguson 17 servant and Colum Fauld 17 servant. From 1842 to 1843 William Macfarlane of Luggiebank was listed as a subscriber supporting the promotion of fine arts in Scotland.\n\nWhilst living at Luggiebank William was appointed as one of the municipal bailies of Kirkintillock from 1840 to 1846. He was joined in his final two years by his friend James Dalrymple.\n\nWilliam Macfarlane of Bencloich and Luggiebank, died on 19 Sep 1851 and was buried in Kilmahog churchyard. The size and quality of his memorial headstone also hint of a man of wealth (below). His gravestone reads \"In memory of William MacFarlan of Bencloich, Stirlingshire, and Luggiebank, Dumbartonshire, Lieut 17th Dragoons, born Parish of Port, 24 April 1787, died Slatefield, Dunoon, 10 Sep 1851.\"\n\nWilliam left a very detailed will (see below). No record of a marriage or children can be found, and all his siblings except younger sister Agnes predeceased him, which explains why his nephews and nieces were beneficiaries of his will. However, the probate record of 13 Aug 1860 provides the following information, \"William Macfarlane late of Bencloich and Luggiebank in the county of Dumbarton, formerly lieutenant in the 17th regiment of the Light Dragoons deceased who died 19 Sep 1851 at Slatefield Dunoon in the county of Argyle. Effects in England less than £100\". The fact that it specifies 'Effects in England' also confirms that he had wealth elsewhere such as Scotland.\n\n95.3 Beneficiaries of William Macfarlane's will\n\nWilliam Macfarlane's will was over 30 pages long and very detailed. It was dated 2 Jan 1851. He nominated many beneficiaries and was quite explicit in how his assets were to be distributed. There were four pages detailing his investments and debts owing, which amounted to over £10,000. There was another page listing properties that he had a financial interest in, which are explored in more detail above. They included:\n\n\"All and whole of the Lands of Carrour and Firbrae, Mains of Bencloich, Drummellon [Drumalling], Mill of Bencloich. Those parts of Greenhead north side of road from Kilsyth to Lennoxtown, Parts of the estate of Campsie acquired from Archibald Emondstone 1835.\n\nAll and whole of my lands known as Luggiebank acquired from William Macfarlane, Lime merchant at Muckroft 29 Sep 1838 and\n\nAll of my lands and estate of Shirva and St Flannan on the south side of the Great Canal and known by the names of Drumhill and St Flannan and village of Tintock sometimes occupied by James and William Martin....Bounded on the north by the Great Canal, on the east by lands owned by Walter Ballantyne, on the south by property owned by John Murray Gartshore and on the west by property of James Duncan\"\n\nThe main provisions in his will were;\n\nPayment of debts and \"of my deathbed and funeral expenses up to 100 guineas for the erection of a monument at my burial place\". See photo above.\n\n\"My cousin Miss Jessie Gordon Robertson, residing at East Mains, Callander £100 and her sister Isabella Robertson of Mansefield, Callander £100\". NOTE: How these cousins are related is unknown, but as the first named beneficiaries, William must have regarded them highly. Miss Jess G Robertson was a witness at William’s sister Agnes’ wedding. See 94.10 and also note below.\n\n£200 to Jean Graham (nee Unknown) wife of Duncan Graham residing at Millcroft near Glasgow and her daughter Jeanie Graham in gratitude for the attention paid to my sister Mrs (Agnes) Robertson (nee Macfarlane)\n\n\"My sister Agnes Robertson, residing at Slatefield, Dunoon, widow of the late Lieutenant Robertson, half the income of my estate\". [Agnes Macfarlane b1788, See 94.10]\n\nSurviving child of the late Isabella Macfarlane, my niece, wife of James Burns, of the Apothecary Hall, Liverpool, interest of £300 (for her) education until reaching majority. Isobel Burns nee Macfarlane b1817 was a daughter of William's brother GGGGF John Macfarlan b1785. In 1851 she was deceased and her only surviving child was Agnes Burns who was 11 at that time. See 97.4b\n\nOnly surviving daughter of the deceased Robert Macfarlane, late of the West Indies £300. \"If my sister Agnes dies without making a bequest to the child of Robert Macfarlane and the child of Isabella Burns (i.e. Agnes Burns), an additional £300\". Robert Macfarlane was a deceased son of William's brother John Macfarlan b1785 and Robert's only child was Frances Jane Macfarlane (1846-1923). See 102.2\n\n\"Catherine, Isabella and Janet McRuer, my cousins, £100\". See Theory 1 below.\n\n\"To my sister Mrs (Agnes) Robertson, a gold watch belonging to me, now in her possession which was made in Madras. At her death to my nephew John Macfarlane.\" (John Macfarlane b1812 married Isabella Fleming See 97.2)\n\n\"Upon the death of my sister Agnes, the whole lands of Luggiebank, Saint Flannan and Drumhill, all in the parish of Kirkintulloch and the county of Dunbarton to my nephew Alexander Macfarlane, late of Jamaica but now in Glasgow, son of my said brother John, for his lifetime, and to his eldest lawful son whom failing, to his eldest daughter in life at his death… the sum of £2000 as a provision which I bequeath to the whole younger or other children male and female of my said nephew Alexander Macfarlane, who shall be in life at the time of their father’s death\" See 103.0 for information about GGGF Alexander Macfarlane (1825-1909) and his only child.\n\nThe other half of the income of the estate to William's nieces and nephews, John Macfarlane b1812, GGGF Alexander Macfarlane b1825, Catherine Hardie nee Macfarlane b1810 (wife of William Hardie a farmer of Redhall, Berwickshire) See 98.0, Margaret Fleming nee Macfarlane b1814 (wife of Thomas Fleming now in New South Wales; see 100.0) and Agnes Macmillan nee Macfarlane c1788 (See 94.10) \"all children of my late brother John and also consisting of John McQueen and Catherine McQueen, children of my late sister Isabella McQueen\" nee Macfarlane b1774. See 94.4.\n\nTherewere a dozen or so other beneficiaries who seem not to have been related and £200 set aside \"for the poor of my native parish of Port Monteith\".\n\nNOTE RE ITEM 9 ABOVE\n\nAccording to this clause, William's lands as described above, should have passed to GGGF Alexander Macfarlane and on his death, to his eldest daughter (and only known child). As it turns out this child was GGM Margaret Allan Cunningham Macfarlane (now proven by many documents and DNA tests to be his child). The main reason that this did not occur, was that GGGF Alexander specifically denied that Margaret was 'of his blood', in his will. The fact that he was very clear on this point, in itself, suggests that he knew the truth, but wanted to ensure that ownership of William's lands passed to relatives in Scotland. He did provide £4000 to Margaret by way of 'compensation'. (See Cunningham and Smith Sections for more information). The other legal impediment was the use of the word 'lawful' in the will above, which probably excluded illegitimate children at that time.\n\n95.4 William Macfarlane's Cousins\n\nThe relationship of some of the listed cousins to William is not entirely clear. The notes below provide theories for how the McRuer and McRobertson sisters may be related and are partly based on ideas kindly provided by ‘PD’. Events in red are backed up by an existing record\n\n95.4a McRuer Sisters: Catherine, Isabella & Janet\n\nWilliam Macfarlane listed Catherine, Isabella and Janet McRuer as cousins in his will. If they were first cousins they were children of a sister of one of his parents. The only record that indicates a female Graham or Macfarlane married a McRuer is Isobel Graham marrying James McRuer in Aberfoyle in 1792 (below). This marriage is in the right timeframe, but no records show that she was a sister of Margaret Graham b1758.\n\nThere was an Isobel Graham born at Port of Menteith in May 1767 to John Graham c1740 and Isobel Macfarlane c1745. Either of her parents may have been related to William Macfarlane b1789. John Graham c1740 may have been a cousin of John’s mother Margaret Graham b1748 (son of a brother of Margaret’s father Robert Graham c1720 or Isabella Macfarlane c1745 may have been related to William’s father John Macfarlane c1742.\n\nOn 29 Dec 1792 at the age of 25 Isobel Graham b1767 married James McRuer (b1767 Aberfoyle) in Aberfoyle. There were no children listed for this couple in Aberfoyle, but records show that a James McRuer and Isobel Graham had at least eight daughters and one son baptised at Barony, Glasgow between 1798 and 1814. Four of the daughters were Margaret born 1800, Isobel 1802, Catherine 1805 and Janet born 1811. A last child named Jean was born in Feb 1814 when Isobel b1767 was aged 46. Strangely, at two censuses the sisters were listed in birth order, but their given ages differ considerably to the baptism dates above. Their given ages were all lowered by five years or more.\n\nThe 1851 census listed the four McRuer sisters living at 81 Bath St, Glasgow as Margaret McRuer 45 b1806 (really 50), head of the household, lodging housekeeper, Isabella McRuer 43 b1808 (really 48), Catherine McRuer 38 b1813 (really 46) and Janet McRuer 32 b1819 (really 40). All were born in Glasgow and were sisters.\n\nThe 1861 census listed Margaret McRuer 54 living in the same address with sister Isabella 54. Also living at that address was 19 year old servant Margaret Macfarlane (b. Isle of Mull) and lodger John Scott. Sister Janet McRuer had married William Hill at Barony in 1852.\n\nThe Glasgow McRuers were likely to be cousins of William. Both William and his nephew Alexander lived in Glasgow for a time in the 1840’s so the location makes good sense, but issues with the above records include:-\n\na) They do not explain why the eldest sister (Margaret) was not mentioned in William’s will, even though she was still alive and unmarried and living with her sisters at that time. However in his old age this may have been an oversight by William!\n\nb) The sister’s ages in both 1851 and 1861 censuses differ greatly from their baptism dates. Wrong ages were common in censuses, either from incorrect transcription, failing memories or a deliberated downplaying by the subject. Would the sisters collectively downplay their ages by so many years?\n\nc) The significant age differences may prove that there were two McRuer families; one in Perthshire and one in Glasgow. This is reinforced by Isobella b1767 being 46 at the birth of her last child. Records show that a Catherine McRuer (c1800 Aberfoyle) married farmer John Dobbie at Fintry in 1826 and died there in 1882. Isabella McRuer (c1810 Aberfoyle) married John McGregor in Aberfoyle in 1832. Perhaps the Aberfoyle McRuers were a different family! More research is needed.\n\n95.4b Robertson Sisters: Jessie Gordon & Isabella Robertson\n\nThe first beneficiaries listed in William Macfarlane's will, were; \"my cousin Miss Jessie Gordon Robertson, residing at East Mains, Callander £100 and her sister Isabella Robertson of Mansefield, Callander £100\".\n\nCatherine and Janet Robertson witnessed an undated letter for William’s sister Agnes Macfarlane which confirms they were close to the Macfarlane family (see 94.10). The above extract from the ‘Montrose Review', 1853: reported bequests in Janet G Robertson's will. It confirms that Janet resided in Torrie and was the daughter of Dr James Robertson, minister of Callander and sister of both Rev Peter Robertson also a minister at Callander and Duncan Robertson of Jamaica.\n\n'PD' who has traced his family back to the Reverend James Robertson (1739-1812), minister at Callander in Perthshire from 1768 until his death, has done much research on the Robertson sisters and has concluded that they were daughters of the Rev James Robertson and sisters to Rev Peter Robertson (see news item above). However, how they were related to William Macfarlane is unknown although he does wonder \"if Henry Graham of Baleich (grandfather of the two Robertson spinsters, Jessie and Isabella) and Dougal Grahame of Overdownance (possible grandfather of Lieutenant William Macfarlane) were brothers? That would make the spinsters and the Lieutenant second cousins.\" See 131.0 for more information about Dougal Grahame of Overdowance. (See diagram below)\n\nJanet was baptised on 13 Nov 1791 in Kilmadock and according to the Macfarlane Family Website on 29 Apr 1810 at the age of 19, Janet married GGGGF John Macfarlane (1785-1830) at Port of Menteith. They had nine children. See Part Five: Forrester Family for information about her early life.\n\n97.0 Nine Children of GGGGP John Macfarlan (1785-1830) & Janet Forrester (1791-1841)\n\nAll children were probably born near the village of Thornhill at Borland (the family farm on the outskirts of the town). However, most were baptised at the nearby church in Port of Menteith. (See 92.3).\n\nThornhill, Stirling is a small village about 30 miles north of Glasgow (photo below). Thornhill was founded as an early planned village in 1696 and most buildings date from the 18th, 19th and 20th century. In the aftermath of the 1745 Rebellion the population was boosted by displaced highlanders. GGGF Alexander Macfarlan had a soft spot for Thornhill (the place of his birth) and remembered the inhabitants in his will.\n\nJohn was born on 29 Feb 1812 at Port of Menteith. Records relating to John are hard to locate but Genny Kang's research has unearthed the following information.\n\nJohn aged 23 married Isabella Fleming 19 on 5 Jul 1835 in her home town of St.Ninians when he was in his early twenties. He was described as a farmer on his death certificate and as the first born male may have taken over management of the family property (possibly Borland Farm). There is an 1841 census record that lists John Macfarlane 30 of independent means living in Port of Menteith with Isabel Macfarlane 35 and Peter Macfarlane 48, clerk. Their address is described as N1 Brodleton. This record fits but Peter Macfarlane would have to be a distant cousin.\n\nJohn Macfarlane of Thornhill was listed as a member of the Thornhill Temperance Society in 1846 (below).\n\nJohn's wife Isabella Fleming b1816 was most likely sister to Thomas Fleming b1815 who married John's sister Margaret Macfarlane in 1836. Thomas Fleming was \"a native of Glasgow, son of William Fleming farmer at St Ninians in Stirlingshire (about 11 miles from Thornhill) and Elizabeth Cowen his wife\", according to his arrival papers as an assisted immigrant. Therefore, Isabella was most likely born in St Ninians as well and possibly it was her marriage to John that helped establish a relationship between John's sister and her brother.\n\nSadly, Isabella Macfarlane nee Fleming died in 1849 at the age of 33 and was buried at Tradeston, Glasgow on 18 Nov 1849. The family were living in Thistle St, Glasgow at the time, very close to the River Clyde.\n\nAnother record relating to John is found in his uncle William Macfarlane's will; \"to my nephews and nieces consisting of John.....\"; where he was listed as one of the beneficiaries in 1851. Another clause in the will stated \"To my sister Mrs (Agnes) Robertson, a gold watch belonging to me, now in her possession which was made in Madras. At her death to my nephew John Macfarlane.\"\n\nJohn's death certificate tells us that he had one daughter and confirms that both she and her mother were both deceased. In fact, her death and possibly that of his daughter may have been another factor for him choosing to migrate. The fact that John was alone in the 1850's, had received a sizable inheritance and that two of his siblings were living in Australia where the gold rushes were in full swing, may have also motivated John to migrate.\n\nA death notice was placed in The Argus, 10 Nov 1853 by John's brother Alexander. It read \"On 7th inst., Mr. John MacFarlan, aged 40 years formerly of Thornhill, Perthshire\".\n\nMargaret was born in Port of Menteith on 27 February 1814. On 22 May 1836 Margaret married Thomas Fleming at Kincardine by Doune. Two years later in 1838, the couple with their baby daughter Jessie Fleming, migrated to NSW. See 100.0 for more details of her life.\n\nAt the age of 24 on 31 December 1838, Isabel married James Burns 32 at Glasgow, Lanarkshire (See below). Isabel and James must have spent some time in Ireland after their wedding, because their only daughter Agnes Burns was born there in 1840.\n\nIsobel Burns nee Macfarlane probably died before the 1841 census and was certainly deceased by the time of her uncle William Macfarlane's death in 1851. William's will made provision for \"the surviving child of the late Isabella Macfarlane, my niece, wife of James Burns, of the Apothecary Hall, Liverpool, interest of £300 for the education until reaching majority\".\n\nFor more information about her husband James Burns, see below.\n\n97.4a James Burns (1806-1872)\n\nJames Burns was born at Dunipace (south of Stirling, Scotland) on the 8 Dec 1806. At the age of 32 he married Isobel Macfarlane 24 (b1817 Kincardine) on 31 December 1838 at Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland (see above). James and Isobel must have spent some time in Ireland after their wedding because their only daughter Agnes Burns was born there in 1840. Isobel Burns nee Macfarlane probably died when Agnes was very young because she did not appear in the 1841 census.\n\nIn 1851 James Burns 46 widowed chemist was living at 41 Louther St, Liverpool with daughter Agnes Burns 11 (b1840 Ireland) and Mary Molloy 23 servant.\n\nThe following year on 24 Dec 1852, James Burns 46 year old widower married his first wife's cousin, Catherine McQueen 38 (b1814) at Liverpool.\n\nBy 1861 James Burns 56 b 1805 druggist (chemist), had moved to 76 and 78 Myrtle St Liverpool, with his second wife Catherine Burns nee McQueen 47 b1814, their son William Burns 7 b1854 and Sarah Skillicorns 40 widow and visitor.\n\nIn 1871 the family was living a few doors away at 82 Myrtle St. and consisted of James Burns 65 widowed druggist, Agnes Burns unmarried daughter 32, William Burns 17 scholar, Isabella Burns 15 b1846 scholar and Helen Fowler 18 servant.\n\nLike many others in the Macfarlane family, Agnes left a very detailed will, with nephew Alexander Hardie and grandnephews William Hardie and William Robertson appointed as executors.\n\n97.7 William Macfarlane (1823-Inf)\n\nWilliam was baptised on 24 August 1828 at Port of Menteith, Kincardine by Doune, Perth. As there are no more records, he may have died as a child. His grandmother Katherine Graham died in 1828 so it is likely he was named in honour of her.\n\n98.0 Catherine Macfarlane (1810-?) & the Hardie Family\n\nCatherine was baptised on 25 April 1810 at Port of Menteith (1851 census) Kincardine by Doune, Perth.\n\nCatherine lived with her family until 30 Jul 1833 when at the age of 23 she married the much older widower William Hardie 42. At first they lived in Kilmadock, and Catherine had two babies John Robert Alexander Hardie b28 Apr 1834 and Isabella Cousin Hardie b17 Sep 1835.\n\nThe couple then moved 100 miles to the Ayton area, where William took over the tenancy lease on the Redhall Farm, Berwickshire and two more babies were born; Agnes Macfarlane Hardie bDec 1837 and William Hardie b20 Aug 1839. The 1841 census records the family as living at Redhall Farm, Ayton and comprising William Hardie 50 farmer and Catherine Hardie 31, their children John R A Hardie 7, Isabella C Hardie 5, Agnes M Hardie 3, William Hardie 1 and Janet Hardie 18 (daughter from William's previous marriage).\n\nIn the 1840's three more children were born; Catherine Macfarlane Hardie b6 Sep 1841, Marion Hardie b19 Aug 1845 and Joseph Hardie b15 Oct 1849. In September 1850 William was made executor of his brother David Hardie's will and was listed as being a \"farmer at Redhall in Berwickshire\".\n\nThe 1851 census listed the growing family living at Redhall Farm as William Hardie 60 farmer of 260 acres, Catherine McFarlan 41 (listed under her maiden name), John Hardie 16, Agnes Hardie 13, William Hardie 11, Catherine Hardie 9, Marion Hardie 5 and Joseph Hardie 1. All the children except Joseph were listed as 'scholars' (or being schooled).\n\nThe 1850's brought more joy and some tragedy. At the age of 42, Catherine's last baby Alexander Macfarlane Hardie (named after her brother) was born on 17 Nov 1852. In the early 1850's Catherine's uncle, William Macfarlane, died and leaving money in his will to Catherine Hardie nee Macfarlane b1810 (wife of William Hardie a farmer of Redhall, Berwickshire). William and Catherine possibly used this money to secure the tenancy lease of the Sunnyside and Kenneddar West Mains Farm at Ross near Belford in Northumberland. Sadly, daughter Agnes Hardie died there in 1855 at the age of 17. On 28th February 1855 William borrowed £200 via a promissory note from his brother David Hardie. David died in May 1856 and by the time his will was granted probate in June 1856, William was recorded as being \"sometime farmer at Redhall in Berwickshire, now at Ross in Northumberland shire\".\n\nJohn was born on 28 Apr 1834 at Thornhill and christened at Kilmadock on 8 May 1834. The 1841 and 1851 census indicates that John lived with his family at Redhall Farm, Ayton where his father was farming 260 acres up into the 1850's. In 1851 the household consisted of William Hardie 60, Catherine Macfarlan 41, John Hardie 16, Agnes Hardie 13, William Hardie 11, Catherine Hardie 9, Marion Hardie 5 and Joseph Hardie 1.\n\nAt some stage between 1851 and 1877, John migrated to NSW. His motivation for migrating to 'the colonies' may have been a desire to visit his uncle Thomas Fleming, Aunt Margaret Fleming nee Macfarlane (see 101.0) and their children (his cousins) who had been living in Australia since the 1830's.\n\nAn obituary was published in the Southern Mail 14 July 1922, \"By the death of Mr John Hardie, which took place at the residence of his son, Mr J M Hardie, ' Blinkbonny,' Wilde's Meadow, on Sunday last, the State has lost another of its pioneers; one who, during his 90 years of life, had lost no opportunity of devoting his energy and ability towards the welfare and advancement not only of the particular localities in which he resided from time to time, but of the State as a whole. Although born at Thornhill, Perthshire. Scotland, the greater part of his lengthy life had been spent in Australia, and much of it in this district. Many years ago he resided at Kangaloon, later on at Bowral, and then removing to Roseville, while the closing period of his life was passed at Wilde's Meadow. A man of the strictest honour and integrity, of genial and kindly disposition, he made many friends and no enemies, and has gone to his rest bearing the highest esteem of all who knew him. The remains were interred in the Presbyterian portion of the Burrawang general cemetery.\"\n\nJohn's wife Margaret Hardie nee Fleming aged 84, died ten years later in 1932, at her son's home Blink Bonny. (above)\n\nIsabella was born on 17 Sep 1835 and christened on 5 Oct 1835 at Kilmadock. By 1841 the family had moved to Redhall Farm, Ayton where her father was farming 260 acres up into the 1850's. Isabella was missing from the 1851 census, but in 1861 she was listed as a 25 year old visitor at 90 Sauchiehall St, Glasgow staying with Margaret Forrester 60 and her family (possibly a relation of Isabel's grandmother). Isabella's place of birth was listed as Donne; which is a misspelling of Doune.\n\nIn the early 1860's Isabella married James Gibson and they settled down at Gunsgreen Hill Farm in Ayton, Berwickshire, Scotland where they had their children; Catherine Helen Gibson b1865 (above), Helen Mary Gibson (1867–1942 and Isabella Marion Gibson (1869–1955).\n\nIn 1871 James Gibson 35 was listed as a farmer of 300 acres of arable land, employing 6 men and 4 women and was also running a manure factory employing 5 men and 2 women. Living with James were his wife and children; Isabella C H Gibson 35, Helen Mary Gibson 4 and Isabella M Gibson 1, Isabella's widowed mother Catherine M Hardie 60 and two servants. By 1881 they were still running the farm and factory but only two daughters were living at home. The family consisted of James Gibson 45 farmer, Isabella C H Gibson 45, Isabella Marion Gibson 11 and Agnes Macfarlane Gibson 10. Agnes must have died during the 1880's as she disappeared from the records after this time.\n\nThe main change in 1891 was that their property was described as Gunsgreens Mansion House. James Gibson 55 was still farming and living with the following family members Isabella Gibson 55, Catherine Gibson 26 and Isabella Gibson 21.\n\nJames Gibson died in 1899 aged 63 and Isabella C Gibson 65 and her daughter Isabella M Gibson 31 moved 270 miles to stay with her aunt Agnes Macmillan nee Macfarlane 77 and her husband Gilbert 74 at Lothmore (See 97.6). Interestingly, Isabella was described as 'merchant's wife' implying that her late husband had focussed on commercial activities in his later life.\n\nWilliam was born on 20 Aug 1839 at Redhall Farm, Berwickshire and lived there with his family in his younger days. In 1851 the household consisted of his parents William Hardie 60 farmer of 260 acres, and Catherine McFarlan 41 (using her maiden name; see 98.0) and children John Hardie 16, Agnes Hardie 13, William Hardie 11, Catherine Hardie 9, Marion Hardie 5 and Joseph Hardie 1.\n\nIn the early 1850's the family moved to Sunnyside and Kenneddar West Mains Farm at Ross near Belford in Northumberland. Sadly, sister Agnes Hardie 18 died there in 1855. The 1861 census listed the family as William Hardie snr 70 now a farmer of 1000 acres, Catherine Hardie 50, William Hardie 20, Catherine Hardie 19, Joseph Hardie 11 and Alexander M Hardie 8.\n\nCatherine was born on 28 Sep 1841 at Redhall Farm Ayton, after the census of that year. In the early 1850's the family moved to Sunnyside and Kenneddar West Mains Farm at Ross near Belford in Northumberland. Sadly, older sister Agnes Hardie 18 died there in 1855. The 1861 census listed the family as parents William Hardie 70 now a farmer of 1000 acres and Catherine Hardie 50 and children William Hardie 20, Catherine Hardie 19, Joseph Hardie 11 and Alexander M Hardie 8.\n\nCatherine's father died at Ross from a heart attack on 9 Aug 1869 aged 79 and Catherine's brother William took over the management of the farm. At the 1871 census living on the farm were William Hardie 30 unmarried farmer of 1520 acres employing ten men, eight women and three boys, his unmarried sister Catherine Hardie 28, unmarried brother Alexander Hardie 19 and niece Catherine Gibson 6 scholar (daughter of sister Isabella). The household had two servants.\n\nDuring the 1870's Catherine (in her thirties) married widower Edward Eccles (1833 -1910) of South Close Villa, Gateshead, Durham and she moved into his house, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Edward Eccles was born in Yorkshire in 1833 and had built up a business in the coal mining industry, owning both mines and ships by the 1870's. His first wife Margaret Newbigin died in 1864 and his only daughter died in 1869. In 1872 he launched his first ship the iron screw steamer 'Edward Eccles', which he named after himself.\n\nLiving in South Close Villa, Gateshead, Durham in 1881 (above) were Edward Eccles 47 ('coal fitter and ship owner') and Kate Macfarlane Eccles 38. They had two servants; Rachel Thompson 42 and Georgina Thompson 20. In 1891 the family was listed as Edward Eccles 57 (Justice of the Peace, City of Newcastle, coal owner and steamship owner), Kate M Eccles 48, Thomas Eccles 60 (Edward's brother; ship broker's agent) and two servants Janet Scongall 28 and Sadie Simpson 20.\n\nIn 1892 Edward Eccles was a part owner of Backworth Colliery (above). The owners at their own expense built the Backworth Workmen's Institute (opened in Feb) and Edward Eccles donated a billiard table for the use of workers.\n\n[NOTE: In 1980, Backworth's last pit, Eccles Colliery, the deepest in the Northumberland Coalfield at 1,440 ft, closed after 165 years of mining in the area.]\n\nIn 1900, Edward Eccles, a coal owner and mining engineer with land holdings in Rothbury and Earsdon commissioned the rebuilding of 'Ellesmere' at Pondicherry, Rothbury. The building was remodelled as six cottages. In 1901 Edward Eccles 67 was listed as being self employed as a coal owner and steamship manager and he was living with his wife Kate M Eccles nee Hardie 58 and two servants in Durham. Even in his seventies Edward was active in the coal industry. On 11th January 1904 he was one of the employer representatives at a meeting of the Conciliation Board at Newcastle-on-Tyne to decide upon the wages for the coming three months.\n\nCatherine Macfarlane Eccles nee Hardie died in 1906 at the age of 64 (above). She was buried in St John the Evangelist Church burial ground, Bilton, Yorkshire. Her gravestone notes that she was the daughter of the late W. Hardie of Ross, Belford and was the wife of Edward Eccles. Edward and Catherine Eccles nee Hardie had no known children.\n\nEdward Eccles of South Close, Gateshead and Springfield, Harrowgate died on 29 Nov 1910 and was buried with his wife at Bilton. Probate was granted in 1911 to Sir Walter Plummer, knight, William John Hardie and William Carrick coal owners. Estate value £96,390. At about this time Edward also received an inheritance of £500 from his brother-in-law Alexander Macfarlane. (The historic calculators convert £96,390 to over 20 million dollars today)\n\nEdwards Eccles made his fortune out of his coal mines and other investments, and there are several instances where he made donations to various communities. In the year of his death he organised the building of \"a fine Arts and Crafts style building to the west of the church\" known as the \"Edward Eccles Community Hall\" (Grade II, above) in Earsden. It was built in 1910-11 and given to the village by Edward Eccles, local colliery owner and is still in use today.\n\nMarion was born on 19 Aug 1845 and baptised at Ayton on 15 Oct 1845. Marion lived with her family at Redhall Farm, Ayton where her father was farming 260 acres. In 1851 the household consisted of parents William Hardie 60 and Catherine Macfarlane 41, and children John Hardie 16, Agnes Hardie 13, William Hardie 11, Catherine Hardie 9, Marion Hardie 5 and Joseph Hardie 1.\n\nIn early 1871 (EMI) Marion married George Robertson at Belford, Northumberland. Later, the brother of George Robertson (James Robertson) married Marion's cousin Frances Jane Macfarlane in 1875. (See 102.2)\n\nAlexander was born 17 Nov 1852 at Ayton Berwickshire. The 1861 census listed the family as William Hardie 70 a farmer of 1000 acres, Catherine Hardie 50, William Hardie 20, Catherine Hardie 19, Joseph Hardie 11 and Alexander M Hardie 8. There were also four servants to look after the house.\n\nAlexander's father, William Hardie, died at Ross from a heart attack on 9 Aug 1869 aged 79 and Alexander's brother William jnr then took over the management of the farm.\n\nAt the 1871 census Alexander was listed as living in Ross Village, Northumberland. Living there at the time with Alexander 19, were his brother William Hardie 30 unmarried farmer of 1520 acres employing ten men, eight women and three boys, his unmarried sister Catherine Hardie 28 and niece Catherine Gibson 6 scholar (daughter of sister Isabella). The household had two servants; Helen Charlton 21 and Alice Anderson 19.\n\nWhen his older brother William died unexpectedly in 1873, it appears that Alexander may have taken on the management of the farm himself. On 29 Nov 1876 Alexander married Annie Fulton at Dennistoun, Glasgow. The 1881 census (above) indicates that Alexander was residing in Ross Village and was a \"Farmer Of 1400 Acres Employing 11 Men 8 Women & 3 Boys\". He was living with his wife, Annie, and three sons (William John Hardie 3, David Fulton Hardie 2 and Alexander Macfarlane Hardie 6 months). The family were obviously quite prosperous as they had 3 domestic servants.\n\nIn 1891 the family were still living in Ross. There were Alexander M Hardie 39 farmer, Annie Hardie 39, Alexander M Hardie 10, Elizabeth Bowerman 23 governess and two servants. By 1901 the family had moved to 4 Catherine Terrace, Durham and Alexander had changed paths. He was now listed as a 'coal agent', but as he was a 'worker' (as opposed to employer), he was probably working for his brother-in-law Edward Eccles who had built up a prosperous coal mining company. This theory is supported by the fact that Alexander named his fourth son Edward Eccles Hardie when he was born in 1894.\n\nOn 22 May 1836 she married Thomas Fleming b1815 at St Ninians, Kincardine by Doune. The previous year Margaret's brother John had married Thomas' sister Isabella Fleming (at St Ninians). Possibly it was John's marriage that helped establish a relationship between Margaret Macfarlane and Thomas Fleming. Two years later on 23 Mar 1838, the couple with their baby daughter Jessie Fleming, migrated to NSW on the 'Portland' as assisted migrants. Their passage was paid by the government in an attempt to expand the workforce in the relatively new colony and they were brought out by immigration agents 'Gilchrist and Alexander'. They arrived in NSW on 18 Dec 1838. Their arrival registration provides many details about them. Margaret 23 was a 'native' of the parish of Port of Menteith. She was the daughter of John Macfarlane farmer and his wife Janet Forrester and could read and write. Thomas 23 was a 'native of Glasgow' and his occupation was farm overseer. His parents were William Fleming farmer of St Ninians and his mother Elizabeth Cowen, and Thomas could read and write. They had one child; Jessie Macfarlan Fleming who was only a few months old (born on 2 May 1838 in Glasgow). Both Thomas and Margaret were members of the Church of Scotland and were in good health. Their ship sailed from Greenock, Scotland on 24 August with 253 emigrants. On the four month voyage one female and three children died.\n\nThe couple settled in the agricultural district of Dungog where four more children were born; Elizabeth Fleming (1840-1930), William Fleming (1842-1920), Isabella Fleming (1846-1925) and Margaret Fleming (1848-1932). Two more children were born in the 1850's; Agnes M Fleming (1853-1879) and Mary Thomas Fleming (1855-1929) possibly at Shellharbour, which is where the family were living in 1855.\n\nIn late 1851 Margaret's wealthy uncle, William Macfarlane, died at his property named 'Luggiebank' in Scotland (see 95.0). He included Margaret in his will as a beneficiary and along with four of her cousins she was bequeathed an equal share of half of the income of William's extensive estate. Margaret's family probably all benefited from the bequest and 'honored' their relative through the names of their NSW properties. Margaret's daughter, Elizabeth, married Charles Smith. In about 1887 Charles and Elizabeth built a house in NSW and named it 'Luggiebank', probably with money from William's estate. One of the children of Charles and Elizabeth was William Fleming Smith whose son Horace built a house called Logiebank. (Macfarlane Website).\n\nHusband Thomas Fleming died in Shellharbour on 2 August 1855 at the age of 40 leaving the now widowed Margaret with five children under the age of ten. In 1861, daughter Elizabeth married James Charles Smith at Wollongong. Margaret Fleming nee Macfarlane died on 4 April 1887 aged 73 at Bowral, New South Wales and whatever assets she had left would have passed to her children. She was buried in Bowral alongside her daughter Elizabeth Smith nee Fleming (see 101.2).\n\nMrs Jessie Fleming or Mercer daughter of Margaret £1000 plus share in residue of estate\n\nMrs Elizabeth Fleming or Smith daughter of Margaret £1000 plus share in residue of estate\n\nMrs Isabella Fleming or Lindsay daughter of Margaret £10,000\n\nMrs Margaret Fleming or Hardie daughter of Margaret £10,000 shared equally with her husband (and cousin) John Hardie son of sister Catherine\n\nWilliam Fleming son of Margaret £5000\n\nMrs Mary Thomas Fleming or Boylean daughter of Margaret £5000\n\nAt the time of his death in 1755 all of John's siblings and six of his nine children from his first marriage were deceased. There were no known grandchildren from his deceased children. John’s will does not include his second 'wife' nor the three children from his second 'marriage', of whom at least two were still alive. It is worth noting that the testament was referring to moveable property. In its research guides NRS points out that the eldest son in a family was often not be mentioned, because he inherited the heritable property (land and buildings) of his deceased father.\n\nAt his death, his estates stretched from Perthshire (Gartmore & Kippen), through Dunbartonshire (Gallangad & Ardoch) and across the Clyde to Renfrewshire (Finlaystone); in addition, he held the lands of Lochwood in Lanarkshire and his Jamaican plantation at Roaring River. Graham's great-great-grandson, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham was a writer, journalist and adventurer. He was also a notable politician, being a Liberal Party MP. and a founder of both the Scottish Labour Party and the National Party of Scotland.\n\n129.0 Reserved for Future Use\n\nDOUGAL GRAHAM OF DOWNANCE\n\n130.0 Ancestors of Dougal Graham of Downance (c1700-c1770)\n\nVery few records exist that record the life of Dougal Graham of Downance and none have been found that confirm who his parents were. Looking at the timeline of his later life it seems he married Katherine Graham, b1705 in the first half of the 1730’s, which suggests he was born between 1690 and 1710.\n\nRecords show three Dougal Grahams born near Aberfoyle in this period.\n\na) 1700 Dougal Graham to Alexander and Isobel Graham at Aberfoyle. No other known children. This Dougal Graham seems to have married Kathryn Lenny in Drymen Parish in 1730 (south of Aberfoyle).\n\nb) 1706 Dougal Graham to James Graham and Margaret McFarlane at Port of Menteith. Other children baptised to this couple at Port of Menteith were Margaret and Jenet Graham 1701 (twins born in Jan), James Graham b1703, Helen Graham 1708, George Graham 1711 and possibly James Graham 1720.\n\nc) 1708 Dougal Graham to John (Gregor) Graham or McGregor and Janet McFarlane in Ruskanach in Buchanan parish. Another child named John Graham was baptised in 1712.\n\nDougal may have been one of the above or another person with baptism record lost). There are two likely possibilities in terms of his ancestral background. He may have descended from the Grahams of Downance or he may have come from a McGregor family that changed their surname to Graham as in c) above. It is even possible that both possibilities are correct. Perhaps an ancestor of Dougal McGregor married a member of the Downance Grahams. This would explain the source of the name Dougal and also how Dougal came to be “of Downance”.\n\nDougal probably had some education and came from a family that was reasonably well off. He later married into a family of similar economic standing. Although we cannot specifically find references to Dougal’s early life, at least some of the existing records (either from the Graham family or McGregor family) must refer to his family. Below I have suggested possible families based on the records that are available.\n\n130.1 Possibility One: Did Dougal descend from the Grahams of Downance?\n\nAbove I have detailed Graham families that were connected to Downance up until the late 1600’s (See 122.0). However, I have found few records re Downance in the early 1700’s and none that link Dougal Graham c1700 to the Graham families of Downance listed above. For reasons explained below I think this is unlikely and there is another possibility.\n\n130.2 Possibility Two: Did Dougal descend from Grahams of Glaschyll?\n\nThere is circumstantial evidence that Dougal descended from a line of Grahams of Ledard, Frenich and Glaschyll. All these locations are within a few miles of each other. (See 131.2 to 131.4 for more information.) This possibility does not exclude Possibility Three, as these locations all border McGregor lands, and Patrick and Dougal were both Christian names common to that clan.\n\n130.3 Possibility Three: Was Dougal Graham a McGregor?\n\n“Dougal” or variations of that spelling was a very rare name in any of the Graham families living near Aberfoyle at that time. However, it was a common name found in McGregor families including the famous Rob Roy McGregor who had familial connections to the Graham’s of Drunkie.\n\nThe name McGregor was illegal for many years between 1603 and 1774 which explains why many McGregor men opted to take their wives surnames and why there are so few baptism records of babies with that surname during that period. McGregor families occupied lands near Loch Arklet, around 10 miles from Aberfoyle and often intermarried with other local families. This theory is supported by the fact that Katherine’s sister Jenet Graham (1709-1748) married Robert McGregor (Rob Roy’s son) c1713 in 1748. Also supporting this ancestral line is fact that the name Dougal was commonly used in the McGregor family.\n\nA third fact is that the Graham families of Drunkie and surrounding areas were often troubled by some members of McGregor family, who had a habit of raiding, stealing from and fighting their neighbours. During the 1600’s and later years, relationships between the families waxed and waned between outright conflict to alliances. Marriages between the two families may have been an attempt to strengthen bonds and bring peace to the area. It seems there were at least three other women of Drunkie who married into the McGregor family. These were Isobel Graham c1635 married John Graham/McGregor of Dunverig around 1660, Katherine Graham c1660 married John McGregor/Graham of Corrie Arklet in 1680 and Jenet Graham 1709 married Rob Roy’s son Young Rob in 1748.\n\nRecords show that there were many McGregor/Graham families farming near Aberfoyle. At least three of these had sons named Dougal who took on the surname Graham and these are briefly described below. More detail can be found in the section about the McGregor Family.\n\n130.4 McGregors at Downance\n\nThe Commissariot Record of Dunblane: Register of Testaments, 1539-1800 lists a Mary McGregor in Over Donnans, Parish of Aberfoyle in 1684. From this we can deduce that\n\nMcGregors lived at Downance in the late 1600’s.\n\nMary seems to have died around 1684 and probably owned property.\n\nDougal (of Overdownance) c1700 may have been her son or the son of a brother.\n\n130.5 McGregors at Dunverig (Parish of Aberfoyle)\n\nAccording to other testaments, another McGregor living near Aberfoyle was John McGregor in Dunverig, about 2 miles S of Aberfoyle (Roy), just south of Balleich. (Testament dated 1680).\n\nJohn MacGregor (c1622) in Dunaverig (later of Brachern) and Isabella Graham of Drunkie, his Spouse had no children, but they did have a nephew named Dougal Graham c1660 of Blair, an early name for Balleich (GD38/1/406), which was adjacent to Dunaverig. Dougal may have been related to Henry Graham of Balleich. See below for more information about the various McGregor families living in the area.\n\n130.6 McGregors at Corrie Arklet (12 miles from Aberfoyle)\n\nJohn McGregor of Corrie Arklet was the son of Gregor McGregor in Dhu of Glengyle later Corrie Arklet c1620. John McGregor of Corrie Arklet c1646-c1706 married Katherine Graham of Drunkie around 1680 and took the surname Graham. Their first son was Dougal Graham b1681. This son was NOT our Dougal Graham because he died young without offspring (See 140.1 for more information).\n\n130.7 McGregors at Ruskanach (Buchanan Parish)\n\n‘McGroger’ has several posts on the Rootschat website with a baptism record dated 1708. It reads, ‘John Grame alias McGregor in Ruskanach and Janet Mcfarlan spouse had a son baptised called Dugald. Witnesses were Malcolm Graham alias McGregor in Ruskanach and John Mcfarlan, Kirk officer’. There is also a record for another son named John in 1712.\n\nRuskanach was located close to Comer in the Buchanan Parish about 15 miles from Drunkie House. Dougal McGregor b.1708 was the grandson of Gregor McGregor of Comer c1648-c1715 and his wife Katherine Ann Mclaren c1670. Gregor’s sister-in-law and Dougal’s great aunt was Katherine Graham of Drunkie. See 141.2 for more information about Gregor/John McGregor/Graham (c1673-c1750) in Ruskanach.\n\nOf all the possibilities in the extended McGregor family this Dougal b1708 was the most likely to have been the husband of Katherine Graham of Drunkie c1705 for the following reasons.\n\nHe was close in age to Katherine c1705.\n\nHis family had strong connections to the Grahams of Drunkie including a great aunt (Katherine Graham c1650), a great grandmother (Isobel Graham c1635) and Dougal’s cousin Robin Oig McGregor 1713-1754 married Jenet, daughter of John Graham of Drunkie around 1748 (a decade after Dougal married Janet’s sister Katherine).\n\nThe baptism record tells us that Dougal was baptised with the surname Graham.\n\nBeing the eldest son, Dougal would have received an inheritance when his father died and would have had a similar social standing to his future wife.\n\nHis parents and cousins were educated, some even travelling to France during times of trouble.\n\nLike the Graham’s of Drunkie, the McGregors of Ruskanach do not seem to have taken part in either the 1715 or 1745 rebellions.\n\nOf course, this does not prove that this Dougal Graham, son of John Graham alias McGregor, was the one that married Katherine Graham b1705 but it certainly is one of the strongest possibilities. There is also the question of how he came to be Dougal Graham of Downance by the time of his marriage. His father Gregor or John Graham in Ruskanach seems to have died in the 1720’s, so perhaps Dougal used his inheritance to purchase land ten miles away at Downance.\n\n131.0 Dougal Graham (c1700-c1770) of Downance & Katherine Graham (1705-1771)\n\nRecords show that Dougal Graham of Downance c1700 and Katherine Graham b1705 (daughter of John Graham of Drunkie) may have had at least four children named Jean Graham 1737, Margaret Graham 1739, Walter Graham c1742 and Katherine Graham c1747. Although there are records that support this contention, they also include discrepencies which I have outlined below. ‘PD’ has suggested that Dougal Graham c1708 of Overdownance married Katherine Graham of Drunkie b1705 (see 113.2). The marriage would have occurred in the mid 1730’s when she was about 30 and in addition to documented daughters Jean and Margaret, they may have had a daughter named Katherine in, say, 1746 when Katherine b1705 was 41. If this was so, Katherine b1746 would have been 22 when she married John McFarlane in 1768, which fits well with known facts. Another child named Walter Graham was born around 1740. There is no baptism record, but his 1763 marriage record describes him as the son of Dougal Graham in Downance.\n\nIn 1755 Dougal’s wife Katherine was listed as a beneficiary of her father’s will and in 1758 Dougal Graham was named as brother-in-law and executor of Captain Walter Graham’s will. Daughter Margaret b1739 was married in 1760 (aged 21) and her residence was described as in “Overdownance”. In 1768 Dougal Graham was listed as the father of Katherine Graham c1747 when she married John Macfarlane at Aberfoyle. The evidence shows that Dougal and Katherine lived at Downance all their married lives.\n\nDougal Graham probably died around 1770. Katherine Graham relict of the deceased Dougal Graham in Balleich died 12 April 1771 in Aberfoyle Parish.\n\n131.1 GRA4 Dougal’s Possible Ancestors from Glaschyll\n\n131.2 Patrick Graham (c1670-1737) of Ledard & Downance\n\nPatrick Graham may have been the father of Dougal Graham. Although no baptism records have been found, other records indicate that, like his son, Patrick married a member of the Drunkie Grahams. Patrick was probably born at Calgarbeig. After the death of his father around 1700, he moved five miles south to his own property at Ledard. Document GD220/5/60 is a copy of correspondence written in 1703 between James, 1st Duke of Montrose and Patrick Grahame of Ledward (Ledard). Ledard Farm was about ten miles from Drunkie House."
