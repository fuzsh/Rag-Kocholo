But in a long and remarkable life he was also a prolific writer, horseman, traveller, adventurer, visionary, internationalist and humanitarian.  This two-day event brings together specialists in different aspects of his life and work to build a portrait of one of the most significant, yet overlooked, figures of late 19th and early 20th century Scottish political and cultural life; and to ask the question: what can we learn from him today about Scotland and the wider world?
