        "text": "Reflecting on the news that the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Bannockburn branch has had a short term stay of execution, Bannockburn Councillor Margaret Brisley says,\n\n“If RBS are looking for our thanks for keeping the Bannockburn branch open for a few extra months, they can whistle. They shouldn’t be shutting it at all.\n\nThe taxpayer – you and I – are the majority shareholders in the Royal Bank. The Tory Government could if they chose to, intervene and tell the Royal Bank to develop and use a social backbone.\n\nOur Tory MP, Stephen Kerr, has been worse than useless – despite having a direct dial to the Treasury, he’s been unable to influence his own party to do the right think for his constituents. From bank closures to Universal Credit, Stephen Kerr and this Tory Government show time and time again they have nothing but hardship to offer working class communities and the most vulnerable in our society.”\n\nRBS announced some months ago that they were due to close the Bannockburn branch this month. This week they announced the branch will remain open until a new branch opens in the Thistle Centre. The new branch will also replace the premises at Pitt Terrace and occupy the former Costa Coffee unit at Murray Place and the Savers shop immediately behind it.\n\nCouncillor Chris Kane, whose Stirling East ward covers Hillpark and Whins of Milton, says,\n\n“I’m at a loss to understand how this new Thistle Centre branch is any more convenient than Pitt Terrace. Locals who need to use the bus will, I suppose, be able to move from the bus station to the new premises completely under cover. But that’s cold comfort if you’ve been soaked to the skin waiting for the bus at the other end.\n\nRBS continue to treat loyal, long standing customers and branch staff atrociously. RBS were quick to take a taxpayer bailout when they needed it, after years of pocketing outrageous profits for shareholders and senior management.\n\nWhen the customers who have remained loyal to them through the best of times and the worst of times need the bank’s help and support, they find the branch door slammed shut in their face.”\n\nSupporters of the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum, and Raploch’s Big Noise, received welcome confirmation today (Thursday) of a long held Labour position that proposals floated by council officers to cut funding to both organisations will NOT be in this year’s Stirling Council budget.\n\nThe Smith was facing a 90% reduction in its funding in 2020, with the Big Noise facing big reductions from next year. Both organisations have been the subject of grass roots campaigns to highlight the importance they play in their communities and the real threat to their futures.\n\nIn a Statement from Stirling Council SNP Labour Administration, Labour Councillor and Depute Council Leader Danny Gibson said,\n\n“The Big Noise and the Stirling Smith are jewels in Stirling’s cultural crown and we will not be taking the budget options concerning them forward into our final proposal this year. However, the immense pressure on local government finances looks set to get worse and eventually that will mean we cannot give money we do not have. I would urge everybody who had signed a petition or written a letter to continue their campaign by writing to every MSP and MP and urge them to save Local Authorities from more devastating cuts in the years ahead”.\n\nCouncillor Gibson’s comments were echoed by Labour’s Administration Partners, with the SNP’s Scott Farmer stating “the options relating to both the Stirling Smith and Big Noise are being removed from budget projections”.\n\nRumour has it that the Labour Group made it clear months ago that these options were non-starters, but that they still ended up in the Priority Based Budgeting consultation process.\n\n“When the school bully steals your lunch money, he’s still a bully if he offers you some of it back”\n\nThe longer term security of both organisations is no clearer than it is for any other local service, as the pressures on Stirling Council’s finances continue to mount. The SNP Government has done a deal with the Greens at Holyrood to lessen the impact of Derek Mackay’s turbo charged austerity agenda by increasing the money on offer to Local Authorities this year – but who knows what will happen next time.\n\nCouncillor Gibson said,\n\n“When the school bully steals your lunch money, he’s still a bully if he offers you some of it back. It is farcical for (local SNP MSP) Bruce Crawford to agree with Derek MacKay’s “fair” cut to our budget six weeks ago and then claim SNP decisions have delivered a “fairer” budget this week, when he’s only doing it because the Greens told him what to think. This pantomime nonsense of the SNP Government presenting a terrible deal simply so they can let a Green Knight ride to the rescue is hugely damaging and creates unnecessary fear and anxiety for council employees, the communities they serve and the services they provide. Stirling deserves better than this.”\n\n“The SNP Government has a habit of giving with one hand and taking away with the other”\n\nOn the new budget settlement announced this week by the SNP / Green “coalition”, the Labour Group’s Economy Spokesperson Councillor Margaret Brisley said,\n\n“The SNP Government has a habit of giving with one hand and taking away with the other, so I’m going to remain skeptical until we drill down into these figures. We’ve still got a projected budget deficit over the next five years in Stirling of over £20 million and it still isn’t clear if this is a one year settlement or if this additional cash will be included in the baseline for future settlements. If not, we’re right back where we started next year.”\n\nSo while there is still a great deal of work to be done before Stirling Council sets its budget for 2018/19 on February 22nd, Labour supporters can be assured that our Labour Councillors are working hard to write a budget that delivers for the many, not the few. Our councillors are also ensuring that the Administration continue to tell Finance Minister Derek MacKay exactly what his continued assault on local services are doing to Stirling, regardless of how uncomfortable that makes the SNP Councillors on the Partnership administration.\n\nStirling Council will meet to set its budget for the coming year on February 22nd.\n\nThe Labour Group Finance Spokesperson Margaret Brisley said,\n\n“The SNP Government has a habit of giving with one hand and taking away with the other, so I’m going to remain skeptical until we drill down into these figures. We’ve still got a projected budget deficit over the next five years in Stirling of over £20 million and it still isn’t clear if this is a one year settlement or if this additional cash will be included in the baseline for future settlements. If not, we’re right back where we started next year. Scotland has learned to ca’ canny with “I am the SNP, your saviour’ pronouncements from the nationalist throne in Edinburgh. There’s nothing progressive about the SNP Government and I’ll be working to ensure Labour values deliver for Stirling in the February budget.”\n\nStirling Council Labour Group Leader Danny Gibson said,\n\n“When the school bully steals your lunch money, he’s still a bully if he offers you some of it back. It’s farcical for Bruce Crawford to agree with Derek MacKay’s “fair” cut to our budget six weeks ago and then claim SNP decisions have delivered a “fairer” budget, when he’s only doing it because the Greens told him what to think. This pantomime nonsense of the SNP Government presenting a terrible deal simply so they can let a Green Knight ride to the rescue is hugely damaging and creates unnecessary fear and anxiety for council employees, the communities they serve and the services they provide. Stirling deserves better than this. The SNP Government have delivered nothing but misery for our local communities in recent years and for them to claim otherwise is disrespectful and wrong.\n\nThe Labour / SNP Partnership Administration published its “Priorities For Local Government” Document this week, with six key pledges to inform decision making over the next five years. The document follows in depth negotiations between Labour Councillors and SNP Councillors which has seen all of Labour’s 2017 Local Government manifesto included in the final document.\n\nWith commitments to build more social housing and tackle poverty in all its forms, Stirling Council’s priorities are delivering for the many, not the few.\n\nOf particular interest are commitments to create new community ownership solutions for public transport, energy and broadband – ensuring these vital services as delivered to community not commercial priorities.\n\nStirling Constituency Labour Party Secretary Jennifer Preston says,\n\n“Labour’s councillors are delivering on their commitment to put Labour values at the heart of local government during this Administration and it is clear that Labour’s vision and commitments are underpinning and driving the partnership administration. In these difficult times, I am heartened that we have Labour councillors in a position of power on Stirling Council who are prepared to push back against a centralising and austerity driven agenda from Holyrood and Westminster.\n\nLabour Group Leader on Stirling Council, Danny Gibson, says,\n\n“When we agreed to the partnership administration with the SNP, we did so on the condition that we would work together and as equals. We are at the heart of decision making, sitting as either a convenor or vice-convenor on all of the council’s decision making committees. We have outlined a vision for Stirling, which is now enshrined at the heart of what Stirling Council will do over the next four years and I’m looking forward to delivering for the many, not the few, over the coming years.”\n\nStirling Council’s priorities were agreed at a full meeting of the council on Thursday 8th December 2017. You can access the document by clicking here.\n\nThe six key priorities are:\n\nPriority A\n\nWe will look after all of our citizens, from early years through to adulthood, by providing quality education and social care services, to allow our communities to lead their lives to their full potential.\n\nPriority B\n\nWe will target all forms of poverty across our communities and mitigate the impact of austerity and welfare cuts on those hit the hardest.\n\nPriority C\n\nWe will create more affordable and social housing in all of Stirling’s communities and lead by example as an organisation in setting exceptional standards in building practice, environmental practice, employer practice and tenant relations.\n\nPriority D\n\nWe will deliver inclusive economic growth and promote prosperity delivering a City Region Deal and pursuing policies and solutions that encourage high quality, high paying jobs into all of Stirling’s communities.\n\nPriority E\n\nWe will develop and implement environment and infrastructure improvements and deliver new ownership and delivery methods around energy generation, public transport and internet access, ensuring profits and series are delivered to community, not commercial priorities.\n\nPriority F\n\nWe will commit and coordinate our resources to ensuring Stirling becomes a must visit destination with heritage, culture, environment and economic strategies working hand in hand to encourage tourists to stay for a minimum of three days and three nights.\n\nAt the December meeting of Stirling Council, councillors will hear about the devastating impact that the introduction of Universal Credit is having on our most vulnerable citizens. A report, first presented to the Council’s Community Planning and Regeneration Committee in November, was sent to full council because the impact was considered so vast and so great, that it cut across all council services.\n\nSpeaking at the November meeting, the Labour Convenor of the Community Planning and Regeneration Committee, Councillor Chris Kane, said,\n\n“It is difficult to overstate how much of a negative impact the introduction of Universal Credit has had in Stirling.\n\nI am appalled that a policy, peddled as liberating and progressive, is being implemented in such a cavalier and cruel fashion. Up and down the country, council after council are telling the same story: Universal Credit is fundamentally flawed and is devastating to the most vulnerable people in our communities.\n\nWe have heard stories today so astonishing they are almost inconceivable; women fleeing domestic violence being told that before they can begin the long grotesque wait for a new application to be processed, they must first spend weeks disentangling an existing joint claim, and must do it with their abusive partner at their side.\n\nStirling Council, and our third sector partners, have been preparing for this vicious storm for over a year. It arrived on 28th June and it is showing no signs of abating; in fact, it is getting worse. The question we must ask is not ‘are our services coping?’, but rather, ‘when will they break?’\n\nSo, what must we do? We must remit this report for consideration by the full council to ensure we have a coordinated response across all of our services and committees. We must share our evidence of the stark reality of this unfolding disaster with the UK Government, in the vein hope that one more voice pleading for a reassessment might be enough to make a difference. We must ask the Scottish Government to identify money to assist us; for while Local Authorities have the liabilities of Universal Credit it is Holyrood who have the power to provide mitigation resources.\n\nWhere this committee can influence change immediately is through internet access, particularly in our libraries. We must instruct our officers to establish what additional measures are required to ensure our citizens, many of whom do not have a computer or even an email address, get the support they need for a Universal Credit application process that is entirely online.\n\nFinally, we must thank Stirling Council staff and our Third Sector partners such as Home Start, the Citizens Advice Bureau, Start-Up Stirling and the Stirling Carers Centre for their professionalism and compassion. It is in stark contrast to the bureaucratic barbarism of the universal credit roll out.\n\nStirling Council Labour Group Leader, Councillor Danny Gibson, has today written to all local MSPs urging them not to support any minority Scottish Government budget that inflicts further financial pain and austerity on Scotland’s Local Authorities.\n\nThe letter, sent to constituency MSPs Bruce Crawford and Keith Brown, along with all Mid-Scotland and Fife list MSPs urges them to:\n\n“show your support for our remarkable council staff and our treasured local services by pledging not to support a budget that inflicts more austerity, more cuts and more unnecessary pain on Local Authorities.”\n\nThe letter comes just days before SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay is due to deliver his budget. Last week the Accounts Commission said that Local Authority budgets have fallen across Scotland by 7.6% in real terms since 2011.\n\nCouncillor Gibson said,\n\n“Whatever way the minority Scottish Government choose to dress it up, Scotland’s Local Authorities have less money to spend on essential services than they did 6 years ago. We are heading towards a cliff for local services and rather than throw us a lifeline, the minority Scottish Government is pushing us closer to the edge. It must stop and it must stop now. We need the support of all of our local MSPs to stop more council cuts.”\n\nThe full text of Councillor Gibson’s letter can be read below:\n\nDear\n\nFunding for Local Authorities in 2018/19\n\nNext week the minority Scottish Government will publish its budget for the coming year. This will include information on the grant being given to Local Authorities, including here in Stirling.\n\nI am writing today to ask you to pledge to NOT support any Scottish Government budget that imposes more austerity and financial pain on Local Authorities.\n\nLast week the Accounts Commission confirmed that Local Authority budgets fell in real terms in 2017/18 compared to 2016/17 and have fallen across Scotland by 7.6% in real terms since 2011. This has resulted in 30,000 local government job losses over this period and Unison Scotland state that nine out of ten austerity job losses in Scotland have been in Councils”.\n\nWhatever way the Scottish Government choose to dress it up, Scotland’s Local Authorities have less money to spend on essential services than they did 6 years ago.\n\nIf the Scottish Government do not act now to reverse the hugely damaging approach they are taking to Local Government finances, the question we must ask is not if council services will break, but when will they break?\n\nWe are heading towards a cliff for local services and rather than throw us a lifeline, the Scottish Government is pushing us closer to the edge. It must stop and it must stop now. We need the support of all of our local MSPs to stop more council cuts.”\n\nThe Scottish Parliament has never had so many economic levers to use to support our vital local services. We need a wholescale review of council tax, rather than the tinkering around the edges we saw last year. We need to use the tax raising powers of the Scottish Parliament to protect, not cut, the local services our citizens rely on every day.\n\nYou can show your support for our remarkable staff and our treasured local services by pledging not to support a budget that inflicts more austerity, more cuts and more unnecessary pain on Local Authorities.\n\nI urge you to tell Finance Minister Derek MacKay this before next week’s budget.\n\nOn budget day, you have a voice inside the chamber at Holyrood and, more importantly, a vote.\n\nKind regards\n\nCouncillor Danny Gibson\n\nLabour Group Leader on Stirling Council\n\nENDS\n\nLabour’s Bannockburn Councillor, Margaret Brisley, has today written to local MP Stephen Kerr demanding he stand up for local communities and fight the closure of Royal Bank of Scotland branches in Bannockburn, Bridge of Allan and Dunblane.\n\nCouncillor Brisley says,\n\n“Some of the Royal Bank’s elderly customers have loyally banked with them for half a century or more. These are the customers whose taxes bailed out the Royal Bank when the Royal Bank needed their support. I find it thoroughly disgusting that customer loyalty and support is being rewarded with the bank door slammed in their faces. As the majority shareholder, the UK Government can, and should, step in and stop this.”\n\nThe full text of Councillor Brisley’s letter can be read below:\n\n1 December 2017\n\nDear Stephen\n\nToday, residents in my ward woke to the news that the Royal Bank of Scotland is looking to close their Bannockburn branch. Residents in Bridge of Allan and Dunblane also received similar news.\n\nThis comes just days after the Bank of Scotland announced closures to branches in Bridge of Allan, Dunblane and Springkerse.\n\nElderly residents in my ward and across Stirling who rely on face-to-face banking are being let down by banks.\n\nSmall businesses in my ward and across Stirling who deal predominantly in cash transactions are being let down by the banks.\n\nCommunities who see branches as a cornerstone of shopping precincts are being let down by the banks.\n\nThe UK Government is the majority shareholder in the Royal Bank of Scotland. It can put pressure on the Royal Bank to be different.\n\nPressure to strengthen communities, not abandon them. To reward customers for decades of loyalty to the Royal Bank with a little bit of loyalty in return. To give loyal staff much better than callous uncertainly for their futures just weeks before Christmas.\n\nOur communities and our citizens were there for the banks in 2008 when the needed our help. Will you ask the UK Government to ensure that the Royal Bank is there for our communities when they need help now?\n\nAs the Member of Parliament for Stirling, will you meet with relevant government officials and ask them to find a way to reverse these hugely damaging closures?\n\nWill you put pressure on the Royal Bank of Scotland to work with communities to find a way to keep these branches open?\n\nI would be grateful for your responses soon – time is very much of the essence here.\n\nKind regards\n\nCllr Margaret Brisley\n\nLabour Councillor for Bannockburn Ward\n\nLabour MSP Richard Leonard was in Stirling this week to tour the Cunninghame Graham Library at the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum. Robert Bontine Cunninghame Grahame was a writer, politician, journalist and adventurer who became the first ever socialist MP when elected in North Lanarkshire in 1886. He went on to found the Scottish Labour Party in 1888 with James Keir Hardie and, much later, the Scottish National Party in 1934.\n\nThe library, which opened in 2016, houses the collected works of, and about, this giant of the early socialist movement in the United Kingdom. Whilst the library is free and available to visit by appointment at any time, every Thursday it is staffed by volunteers who are on hand to answer questions from visitors.\n\nAs Secretary of the Keir Hardie society, Richard was keen to reinforce the ties with the Cunninghame Graham society. He toured the library and the museum with Cunninghame Graham Society Convenor Gerry McGarvey and Smith Art Gallery and Museum Chairman Colin O’Brien.\n\nRichard says,\n\n“Keir Hardie and Cunninghame Graham were there at the very dawn of the Labour movement and without them, our political landscape would be very different. I am passionate about ensuring people have access to history so we can learn from it and I wanted to meet the volunteers here at the Stirling Smith who are doing so much to keep the legacy of Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham alive. My visit reminded me of the Great Dock strikes of 1889, which Cunninghame Graham supported and stood alongside the dockers fighting for a minimum wage for their work. These were also the docks which operated a policy where men would gather at the gates, sometimes two or three times a day, and hope to be called on to work. The dockers knew this the “call-on policy”, but today we might describe it as a zero hours contract. Each generation fights for what is right, but the similarities of what has gone before can provide context and help focus today’s efforts.”\n\nGerry says,\n\n“Cunninghame Graham is such an amazing character. In his day he was such a dynamic figure as a politician and a writer. But he was also an Argentinian cattle rancher and a British aristocrat. He travelled to Morocco disguised as a Turkish Sheik and he prospected for gold in Spain. He befriended Buffalo Bill in Texas and taught fencing in Mexico City. He founded the forerunner of both the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party. The more you find out about Robert Cunninghame Graham, they more you want to know.”\n\nRobert Bontine Cunninghame Graham died in 1936 in Argentina, but is buried at Inchmahome Priory on the Lake of Menteith, near to his family’s estate at Gartmore.
