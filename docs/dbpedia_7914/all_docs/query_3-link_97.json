As such, it has become a by-word for the assumption of various, often contradictory habits of thought, belief, behaviour and perceptions. Victorian studies and studies in nineteenth-century literature and culture have, from their institutional inception, questioned narrowness of presumption, pushed at the limits of the nominal definition, and have sought to question the very grounds on which the unreflective perception of the socalled Victorian has been built; and so they continue to do. Victorian and nineteenth-century studies of literature and culture maintain a breadth and diversity of interest, of focus and inquiry, in an interrogative and intellectually open-minded and challenging manner, which are equal to the exploration and inquisitiveness of its subjects. Many of the questions asked by scholars and researchers of the innumerable productions of nineteenth-century society actively put into suspension the clichés and stereotypes of ‘Victorianism’, whether the approach has been sustained by historical, scientific, philosophical, empirical, ideological or theoretical concerns; indeed, it would be incorrect to assume that each of these approaches to the idea of the Victorian has been, or has remained, in the main exclusive, sealed off from the interests and engagements of other approaches. A vital interdisciplinarity has been pursued and embraced, for the most part, even as there has been contest and debate amongst Victorianists, pursued with as much fervour as the affirmative exploration between different disciplines and differing epistemologies put to work in the service of reading the nineteenth century. Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture aims to take up both the debates and the inventive approaches and departures from\n\n6169_Shaw.indd ix\n\n19/09/19 4:37 PM\n\nx\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nconvention that studies in the nineteenth century have witnessed for the last half century at least. Aiming to maintain a ‘Victorian’ (in the most positive sense of that motif) spirit of inquiry, the series’ purpose is to continue and augment the cross-fertilisation of interdisciplinary approaches, and to offer, in addition, a number of timely and untimely revisions of Victorian literature, culture, history and identity. At the same time, the series will ask questions concerning what has been missed or improperly received, misread, or not read at all, in order to present a multi-faceted and heterogeneous kaleidoscope of representations. Drawing on the most provocative, thoughtful and original research, the series will seek to prod at the notion of the ‘Victorian’, and in so doing, principally through theoretically and epistemologically sophisticated close readings of the historicity of literature and culture in the nineteenth century, to offer the reader provocative insights into a world that is at once overly familiar, and irreducibly different, other and strange. Working from original sources, primary documents and recent interdisciplinary theoretical models, Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture seeks not simply to push at the boundaries of research in the nineteenth century, but also to inaugurate the persistent erasure and provisional, strategic redrawing of those borders.

The magazine fused literature and art with scientific and sociological essays, and it was widely applauded for its handsome design, inviting comparisons with other fin-de-siècle magazines, including The Yellow Book. As Branford quipped, it was ‘a fine art production from what was one of the filthiest and most degraded slums of Europe’.2 But The Evergreen and Geddes were not simply interested in contributing to the revitalisation of Edinburgh’s Old Town. In his assessment of The Evergreen’s aims, Branford makes reference to the magazine’s namesake, Allan Ramsay’s Evergreen (1724), a collection of poetry that hoped to arouse interest in medieval and early modern Scottish literature, in the wake of the 1707 Acts of Union. Branford believed that Geddes’s Evergreen was equally keen to defend and reanimate Scottish culture and traditions: In 1724 Allan Ramsay published his Evergreen, desiring thereby to stimulate the return to local and national tradition and living nature. [. . .] Amongst the ‘local and national’ traditions which patriotic Scotsmen are to-day trying to revive and keep alive, the present Evergreen specially concerns itself with those connected with Scottish nationalism, Celtic literature and art, and the old Continental sympathies of Scotland (more particularly the ‘ancient league with France’). [. . .] In the incipient Celtic Renascence, Ireland has played a much more conspicuous part\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 1\n\n19/09/19 4:37 PM\n\n2\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival than Scotland. But the writings of Miss Fiona Macleod are gradually disclosing to the British public quite another Scotland than that with which the lowland writers have familiarized them. And it is generally overlooked, too, that in Art the Glasgow School, in consideration of its local origin and its emphasis on colour and decorative treatment of subject, may be counted congenitally part of the Celtic Renascence. To many, the most hopeless quest will seem the endeavour to restore Edinburgh to its position as a culture capital, and to make Scotland again a power (of culture) in Europe, as it was in recent, in medieval, and most of all in ancient times. Yet who knows?3\n\nBranford here identifies several key features and objectives of Geddes’s community and The Evergreen magazine. He highlights Geddes’s desire to rehabilitate Scotland’s position as an international cultural power, by reanimating its European connections, including the Franco-Scottish alliance. In making these points, Branford is quick to caution that those in Geddes’s circle were not defined by an anti-Union sentiment, despite their connections to ‘Scottish nationalism’; they were primarily concerned with developing a revival movement that was firmly ‘of culture’, seeking to assert Scotland’s nationhood and its international presence through cultural means. A defining feature of this movement, in Branford’s assessment, was its enthusiasm for Celtic literature, mythologies and art – a passion that he finds reflected in the art of the Glasgow School, a reference to the pioneering circle of artists in Glasgow that encompassed Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Margaret Macdonald, the Glasgow Girls and the Glasgow Boys. In its desire to defend and revitalise Scottish literature and art, and its valorising of Celtic culture, Branford casts this movement as directly comparable with the Irish Revival (a more politically nationalist cultural movement headed by such figures as William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory and J. M. Synge), and characterises it as a key voice in the wider ‘Celtic Renascence’. In Branford’s framing, a national movement analogous to the Irish Revival, with international ambitions, took hold across Scotland at the fin de siècle, of which The Evergreen was one of its notable products. Branford was not the only contemporary critic to detect a concern with cultural defence and revivalism in fin-de-siècle Scotland. Writing in 1913, one of the first literary critics of the 1890s, Holbrook Jackson, identified a ‘Scottish movement’, analogous to the Irish Literary Revival, that centred on Geddes, which he characterised as an effective revival.4 Author and playwright Israel Zangwill asserted the existence of a fin-de-siècle ‘Scotch School’, which he applauded for trying to ‘emancipate itself from the intellectual thralldom of\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 2\n\n19/09/19 4:37 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nLondon’.5 Reflecting on the 1890s, Lewis Mumford, a collaborator of Geddes, wrote on the ‘artistic and literary revival in Edinburgh and Glasgow, which was dimmed only by the profounder Irish revival of O’Grady, A. E. and Yeats’.6 The author Neil Munro also noted that ‘we are having a Scots revival in literature’ in one of his letters to William Blackwood in 1894.7 And in the words of Elizabeth Sharp – editor of Lyra Celtica, a collection of poetry published by Patrick Geddes and Colleagues – Geddes’s projects intended to ‘arrest the tremendous centralising power of the metropolis of London’ and to ‘restore to Scotland something of its old pre-eminence in the world of thought’.8 As these various quotations illustrate, contemporary critics and witnesses of cultural developments in 1890s Scotland detected a palpable desire to challenge the centralisation of culture and intellectualism to London and a conviction to reassert Scotland’s distinctive cultural presence internationally. Despite contemporary critics identifying a concern with cultural defence and revival in fin-de-siècle Scotland, there has been no sustained consideration of it since. As Murray Pittock and Isla Jack have neatly summarised, while the Irish Revival’s ‘Scottish equivalent seemed almost as important’ in the late Victorian period, it ‘remains sadly neglected today’.9 Although Kurt Wittig noted that Scottish literature was ‘heaving again’ in this period,10 and Roderick Watson has more recently identified ‘stirrings’ of cultural confidence in the 1890s, such comments are often brief observations in studies on broader periods.11 The most substantial considerations of Scottish nationality in relation to fin-de-siècle culture to date are John Morrison’s chapter on the Celtic Revival in his book, Painting the Nation: Identity and Nationalism in Scottish Painting, 1800–1920 (2003), and Douglas Gifford’s 2015 essay, ‘From Celtic Revival to Scottish Renaissance?’. Although the latter is primarily concerned with revealing the health and vitality of Scottish culture c.1870–1920, tacitly challenging Tom Nairn’s view that there was little Scottish literature ‘worth attention from 1880 to 1920’,12 Gifford’s essay also usefully identifies similarities between Scottish and Irish culture at the fin de siècle, as well as continuities between Scottish literature of the fin de siècle and the ‘Scottish Renaissance’ of the 1920s. His polemic calls on critics of Scottish literature to revisit ‘our cultural maps of the 1870–1920 period’, which, he thinks, urgently require reconsideration.13 In highlighting the need for critics to focus on fin-de-siècle Scotland’s ties to Irish developments as well as the Scottish Renaissance of the 1920s, Gifford’s essay implicitly works against a common\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 3\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n4\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nassumption in Scottish literary criticism that Scotland developed a cultural revival comparable to Ireland’s only in the 1920s, with the emergence of such writers as Hugh MacDiarmid and Edwin Muir. For instance, when comparing late Victorian Scotland to Ireland, Glenda Norquay writes that a ‘project of Celtic revivalism in Scotland’ was not only absent but also ‘prevented’ by a relative lack of academic interest in Scotland’s Celtic inheritance, noting that Robert Louis Stevenson’s ‘espousal of Celtic’ was a rare exception.14 Alongside such understandings of absent Celtic revivalism, several literary scholars have also framed the fin de siècle as marking a weak point for Scottish nationality and culture. Associating 1890s literature with an anti-national and anti-international insularity, Margery Palmer McCulloch writes that, by the Second World War, Scottish modernist texts had travelled far from ‘kailyaird parochialism in the late nineteenth century’.15 Until recently the Kailyard – a term often associated with the 1890s writings of J. M. Barrie, S. R. Crockett and Ian Maclaren that were set in small Scottish towns – has tended to underpin characterisations of 1890s Scottish literature, breeding blanket generalisations that frame 1890s Scottish culture and identity in terms of the parochial and the anti-national. This was particularly apparent in the criticism of the 1960s through to the 1980s. Echoing Ian Campbell’s view that the late nineteenth century suffered from a ‘diluted national consciousness’,16 Gillian Shepherd argues that Kailyard writers ‘sought to thwart a national consciousness that might have been’ – a quotation that suggests Scotland was lacking a national consciousness in this period. Expanding on this claim, Shepherd starkly refers to Kailyard novelists as proponents of ‘national infanticide’.17 More nuanced understandings of the Kailyard have since been put forward by Andrew Nash, who shows that Kailyard literature was concerned not simply with locality but also with a defence of Scottish nationality: in Nash’s framing, certain Kailyard texts attempted to correct English characterisations of Scottish identity, and he also rightly notes that the parochial and the national need not be mutually exclusive paradigms in Scotland, through highlighting the broader literary tradition of portraying ‘rural and humble life as representative of Scottish national identity’.18 Nevertheless, the association of the Scottish fin de siècle with an infirm, or even deceased, national consciousness continues to be endorsed; Cairns Craig, for instance, has recently claimed that Scotland was ‘effectively dead’ before the Scottish Renaissance of the 1920s.19 Building on Gifford, Morrison, Pittock and Jack, this book presents the first sustained consideration of fin-de-siècle Scottish revivalism, which hopes to revise several of the misunderstandings of the\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 4\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nperiod that have taken hold, and to reveal the complexity of fin-desiècle Scottish culture. By assessing a range of literature and art from across Scotland c.1880–1914, these chapters unearth and analyse the Scottish Revival that the likes of Branford, Zangwill, Jackson, Sharp, Defries and Munro identified. I demonstrate here that several writers and artists were discontented with what they perceived to be the increasing marginality of Scottish identities, cultures and traditions in this period, which fuelled a concerted effort to defend and revive Scottish literature and art, anticipating several twentiethcentury developments. This revivalism can be found in neglected texts and artworks of the era, and also in key canonical works that have not been considered in relation to pertinent constitutional and cultural contexts, such as those of Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Violet Jacob and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. But although this book reveals that a number of figures across the nation desired to develop cultural revivalism in Scotland, it does not portray that desire as uniform or cohesive in shape. Not only was the nature of the Scottish Revival contested and complex, but also individual promoters were inconsistent on the issue, much like several Irish revivalists. Beyond uncovering the concern with revivalism in Scotland, and revealing the similarities (and tensions) between the Scottish and Irish Revivals, this book also explores the significant role that dissident fin-de-siècle styles and ideas played in supporting the Scottish Revival. In their turn to traditional Scottish culture, including Celtic crafts and mythologies, Scottish revivalists participated in a broader interrogation of fin-de-siècle modernity and ‘civilisation’ that was found across Europe, and they often looked to wider European cultural developments to fuel their revival. As in other European nations, Scottish revivalists engaged in decadent neo-paganism, occultism, neo-Jacobitism, japonisme and mysticism to fuel their attempts to define the nation and revive aspects of its culture. In shedding light on the decadent, symbolist and international dimensions of cultural revivalism in Scotland, this book hopes to add several new perspectives to critical understandings of Scotland’s fin de siècle, a period that Craig believes remains one of the least well understood in Scottish cultural history.20\n\nCultural Revivals in Fin-de-Siècle Europe The understanding of the term ‘cultural revival’ that I adopt in this study builds on John Hutchinson’s theory of cultural nationalism. In his essay ‘Cultural Nationalism and Moral Regeneration’, Hutchinson\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 5\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n6\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\njuxtaposes the concept of cultural nationalism with that of political nationalism. Political nationalism, he writes, is an endeavour that seeks ‘to secure a representative state for [a] community’, and it is this ambition for statehood that distinguishes political nationalism from cultural nationalism. For Hutchinson, cultural nationalism is not necessarily concerned with attaining statehood: its focus is on defining, ‘re-unit[ing]’ and regenerating a national community, and highlighting its distinctive development, ‘oppos[ing] assimilation of the community to any universal model of development’.21 While Hutchinson juxtaposes this cultural nationalist aim to build a stronger sense of nationality against political nationalism, he is nevertheless keen to stress that they are not mutually exclusive concepts. Cultural and political nationalists are ‘different, even competing’ groups, but cultural nationalists, he writes, ‘are often driven into state politics to defend the cultural autonomy of the nation’.22 Like Hutchinson’s definition of cultural nationalism, cultural revivalism refers to attempts to define and unify a national community through cultural apparatus, without necessarily arguing for statehood. But cultural revivalism is distinguished by its particular emphasis. Cultural revivals, such as the fin-de-siècle Scottish Revival, prioritise the recovery (or appropriation) of past cultural formations and traditions to bind and define the nation, and to resist the nation’s assimilation. As we shall see, these movements – defined by returning to folklore, mythologies, histories and traditional crafts – at times placed themselves in opposition to industrial modernity but, equally, they were not always antithetical to modernity. Several fin-de-siècle cultural revivalists were concerned with reconciling modernity with the continuance of tradition to define and unify the national self. Across fin-de-siècle Europe, such cultural revival movements were ubiquitous, developing distinctive accents in each nation. As Michelle Facos identifies, revival movements, concerned with the ‘survival of native traditions and values’, ‘thrived in much of Europe – in Scandinavia as well as in Ireland, Belgium, Hungary, Poland and Russia’.23 Facos argues that these movements were partly concerned with rejecting the dominance of industrial capitalism in the late nineteenth century, which was felt to be uprooting peoples, while Neil Kent proposes an additional explanation for their rise: they responded to anxieties about mounting centralisation and cultural homogeneity across Europe.24 This concern with cultural homogeneity was reflected in the Young Belgium movement, which I discuss in Chapter 2, whose writers hoped to defend their nation’s literary culture from increasing centralisation of artistic life to Paris.\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 6\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nTo safeguard their particular cultures, Facos demonstrates that several European revivalists turned to romantic nationalism, which ‘tended to be expressed in the form of durable “master narratives” containing an origin myth, historical heroes, ongoing antagonists, [. . .] nostalgia for a lost golden age, and the promise of an imminent revival’, according to Richard Marsden.25 Like the romantics before them, several revivalists also valorised the lifestyle of the peasantry, ‘whose links with primordial times continued unbroken in forests and villages’, which made them ‘sacred protectors’ of national cultures.26 Eric Hobsbawm illustrates that such ‘invented traditions’ were ‘mass produced’ throughout Europe between 1870 and 1914 in order to stimulate greater cohesion within groups,27 and literature and art became key tools for distributing these traditions. Various European artists and writers created works to advance their nation’s cultural revival, a striking number of which reveal a debt to a contemporary art movement that prioritised the mystical and spiritual over realism – symbolism. Facos writes that symbolism’s focus on realities beyond the material was in step with the ‘biomystical link between a landscape and its inhabitants’ that several revivalists developed,28 and she illustrates the clear convergence of cultural revivalism and symbolism in several Swedish revivalist artworks, including those of Richard Bergh, who turned to mythology, folklore and the mystical for artistic inspiration. Sweden’s fin-de-siècle revival provides an example of a nationalism that was not politically nationalist, by Hutchinson’s definition, as Sweden was already in possession of statehood. But several cultural revival movements in Europe ran alongside, and intersected with, political nationalist campaigns. Certain Irish revivalists, such as W. B. Yeats, embody this intersection, in looking to Celtic mythology to revive awareness of Irish tradition while finding themselves drawn into debates on political nationalism.29 Similarly, at the time of the Russification of Finland (a Russian policy intended to weaken Finland’s political autonomy at the fin de siècle), Akseli GallenKallela led Finland’s turn to mythology to bolster the nation’s artistic and cultural identity. Gallen-Kallela was especially influenced by Finland’s national epic, Kalevala, which informed several of his works, including the Aino Myth triptych (1891). As in Ireland and Finland, cultural revivalism in fin-de-siècle Scotland developed alongside growing anxieties over the nation’s constitutional position, with a number of Scots articulating their concern that Scottish nationality and the nation’s political autonomy were being undermined by increasing centralisation towards London. Although there was very\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 7\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n8\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nlittle interest in ‘secur[ing] a representative state’ for the Scottish nation amongst fin-de-siècle cultural revivalists, several critiqued the constitutional make-up of the United Kingdom, and certain figures actively campaigned to obtain some of the apparatus of statehood for Scotland, including a national legislature, through agitating for Home Rule. In order to understand the distinctive nature of the Scottish Revival fully, we must address the political contexts and anxieties that it developed against and, at times, directly spoke to.\n\nConstitutional Discontents and Scottish Home Rule In his study on Scottish national identity c.1830–60, Unionist Nationalism, Graeme Morton demonstrates that mid-nineteenth-century Scotland was broadly content with its constitutional position within the United Kingdom, on account of the fact that Scotland was largely self-governing. Morton highlights that, in this period, the British state’s capacities were so limited that there was minimal intervention in Scottish affairs and, consequently, the Scottish bourgeoisie were free to govern Scotland through its various institutions, such as the church, law, education, the periodical press and municipal government. In Morton’s framing, ‘it was anathema to contemporary thought to campaign for a Westminster-style Scottish state’ because the Scottish bourgeoisie ‘had all the power it needed to govern its own society’.30 In this period, rather than being antagonistic, Morton stresses that the Union and Scottish liberty were perceived as mutually supportive concepts – a phenomenon that he defines as ‘unionist nationalism’. We find this unionist nationalism throughout Scottish culture in the midnineteenth century, but it is perhaps best embodied by Joseph Noel Paton’s design for the National Memorial of the War of Independence (1859). This memorial design consisted of a large Celtic cross, adorned with various statues and bas-reliefs at its base, one of which depicted ‘The Union’. Here, on a monument that commemorates the military efforts of Wallace and Bruce, the Union is simultaneously celebrated through a depiction of two female symbols of Scotland and England joining hands ‘as Independent Powers’.31 The expression of Scottish national liberty and history is in no way portrayed as compromised by Union here: instead, the Scottish wars of independence are portrayed as facilitating an equal partnership, one in which Scotland can still express and commemorate its autonomy.32 The sense of Scotland’s continuing freedom within Union is reflected in mid-Victorian Scottish political poetry. Kirstie Blair’s\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 8\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nexamination of the ways Scottish periodical poetry engaged with nineteenth-century European nationalist movements reveals that Scots saw their nation as a model for European nations hoping to achieve national liberation, rather than as a nation that also needed to be liberated. Blair identifies an array of poems from the periodical press that demonstrate Scots’ sympathy for Kossuth’s and Garibaldi’s campaigns in Poland and Italy to illustrate this point. Scots portrayed their nation as ‘Land of freedom’, ‘whaur Freedom’s standard never fell’, ‘ever famed for thy beauty and freedom’.33 The poets that Blair identifies saw Scotland as a beacon of freedom and liberation in the mid-nineteenth century, a nation that had achieved its liberation in the fourteenth century, which had continued despite the Union. As late as 1884, in poetry written during the Reform Bill agitation, we find Scottish political poets referencing ‘the stern independence o’ Scotland’.34 Such lines illustrate that not only did many Scots think of their nation as free in the nineteenth century, but also there was still space in the public imagination to conceive Scotland as an independent nation. But even amidst the expressions of Scottish freedom and independence within Union in the mid-nineteenth century, there were nascent signs of Scottish discontent with the United Kingdom’s constitutional dynamics. In 1853, the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights was established, with an initial meeting in Edinburgh ‘crowded to excess, many hundreds besides having failed to obtain admission’.35 The association was primarily concerned with the under-representation of Scottish affairs in Westminster, and, to help remedy this discontent, the association proposed that ‘“the office for Secretary of State for Scotland be restored”’36 and that there should be increased Scottish parliamentary representation in Westminster.37 Michael Keating rightly notes that the association was ‘firmly within the unionist tradition, asking for more consideration for Scottish issues at Westminster and in Whitehall’,38 but it is important to stress that, for some in the Association, their goals were not limited to increasing Scotland’s presence in parliament and government. One attendee, at an even larger Glasgow meeting, called for a ‘Scottish assembly’, an idea echoed by Glasgow’s The Commonwealth newspaper, which argued that the establishment of a Scottish Secretary, along with increased representation in Westminster, would ‘do much; but they will not do all’ and that the ‘full remedy’ was a ‘parliament’.39 As we move into the later nineteenth century, several of the tensions that some Scots felt within the Union grew. A number of historians have noted that the nature of the Union changed in the late\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 9\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n10\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nVictorian period. For instance, Alvin Jackson notes that ‘for Scotland, the massive growth of the civil service in the later 19th century was essentially the growth of the union’.40 A growing state and growing centralisation, Jackson argues, led to the feeling that Scotland’s freedom was increasingly compromised and, consequently, according to Morton, unionist nationalism ‘died out’ at the fin de siècle, to be replaced by an identity that was ‘more Scottish than British’.41 We similarly find a concerted effort to defend and expand Scotland’s civic state at the fin de siècle, reflected in the proliferation of new national institutions, including the Scottish Text Society (1882), Royal Scottish Geographical Society (1884), Scottish History Society (1886), Scottish National Portrait Gallery (1889), Scottish Mountaineering Club (1889), Scottish Football League (1890), Royal Scottish National Orchestra (1891), Scottish Council for Women’s Trades (1895) and Scottish Trade Union Congress (1897). Richard Finlay argues that these institutions bore the mark of Scottish ‘cultural defensiveness’: they attempted to ‘create a cultural apparatus which would reinforce notions about Scotland’s distinctive national identity’.42 Similarly, Christopher Whatley has demonstrated that the many civic memorials that were erected in late Victorian Scotland reflected a ‘renewed sense of national consciousness’.43 These concerns over Scotland’s constitutional position, and a growing desire to defend the nation and its autonomy, are reflected in the formation of a further association, which hoped to enact the most radical reform to the Anglo-Scottish Union since its establishment in 1707 – the Scottish Home Rule Association (SHRA). Although London-based concessions, such as the restoration of the Scottish Office and the Secretary of Scotland, were made in 1885 to assuage anxieties over the rise of ‘insolent centralization’, as John Stuart Blackie, Chairman of the SHRA, put it,44 they were felt to be insufficient. Thus, in 1886, the SHRA was formed with the primary aim of re-establishing a Scottish legislature in Edinburgh, through either devolution or federation. Through this proposal, many in the Association hoped to reduce Westminster’s capacities chiefly to matters of empire (making it an ‘Imperial Parliament’). Colin Kidd suggests that the SHRA’s existence was, ‘if anything, a symptom of creative imperialism’,45 implying that Scottish Home Rule was primarily conceived to ease the pressures on a Westminster parliament overburdened with imperial affairs. But, while Scottish Home Rulers certainly sold the wider advantages that Home Rule might bring to the Empire, discontents with the Union and a desire to defend Scotland’s interests were very clearly (and sometimes strongly)\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 10\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nsounded. Adding nuance to Kidd’s claim that the Union was uncontested in this period – ‘part of the wallpaper in Scottish political life’46 – Whatley rightly stresses that ‘we should not assume that the wallpaper was to everyone’s taste’, and he highlights the fact that Home Rule became a ‘powerful movement’ in late Victorian and Edwardian Scotland as a consequence.47 Very few Scots questioned the presence of a union in the late nineteenth century, but there was growing discontent with the form of the Union. Evidence that Scottish Home Rule became a ‘powerful movement’, rather than one defined by ‘feebleness’ (as Tom Nairn characterised it), is reflected in its longevity and its increasing momentum between 1886 and 1914.48 Critiquing the idea that the SHRA was a mere ‘parrot cry’ of Irish discontents, Reginald Coupland argues that ‘if Scottish nationalism [. . .] had been only a pale reflection of Irish nationalism, it would probably have faded away in the course of that bleak Conservative decade [1895–1906]’.49 The Scottish Home Rule movement certainly went through its peaks and troughs between 1886 and 1914 but the issue did not subside over those three decades: Scottish Home Rule motions were carried in the House of Commons from 1893 onwards, which were supported by a clear majority of Scottish MPs, and these efforts led to two bills that were carried by significant majorities on their first readings across the whole of the House of Commons (in 1908 and 1911), and one that passed its second reading (1913) before being rejected in the House of Lords. With the support of the Liberal-backing Young Scots’ Society, as well as a body of pamphlet literature and various Home Rule periodicals – including The Scots Magazine and British Federalist (1893–4),50 Theodore Napier’s The Fiery Cross (1901–12), Charles Waddie’s The Scottish Nationalist: A Monthly Political and Literary Journal Devoted to the National Life of Scotland (1903), John Wilson’s The Scottish Patriot (1903–6) and T. D. Wanliss’s The Thistle (1909–18) – Home Rule ‘came seriously close to dominating Scottish politics before the outbreak of war in 1914’.51 In addition to its longevity, Scottish Home Rule was also a broad movement, even in its infancy, as SHRA membership records reveal. The association is often characterised as a primarily Liberal cause, which it was, but it also attracted a colourful range of figures from across the political spectrum, many of whom became prominent figures in British politics. Britain’s first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay Macdonald, its first socialist MP, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, and his co-founder of the Scottish Labour Party, Keir Hardie, were all Vice-Presidents of the SHRA. An early President was\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 11\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n12\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nGavin Brown Clark, who founded the Land Restoration League and successfully stood as a Crofters’ Party candidate in the 1885 General Election, taking the Caithness seat from the Liberals. John Crichton-Stuart (third Marquess of Bute), the aristocrat renowned for his architectural patronage and collaborations with William Burges, was a further enthusiast. Bute wrote on the topic of Home Rule in several publications, including The Scottish Review, a pro-Home Rule magazine, which its editor, William Metcalfe, hoped would ‘protest against the idea that London is the centre of Scottish life’.52 Metcalfe even proposed to Bute that the magazine could become the organ of a Scottish ‘National Party’ in 1889.53 While fronted by men, the movement also attracted prominent women, including Lady Florence Dixie, a war correspondent, author, champion of women’s rights, and aunt of Lord Alfred ‘Bosie’ Douglas. John Ferguson, an Irish Home Ruler who emigrated to Glasgow, was a further early Vice-President of the SHRA. His membership might suggest intimate co-operation between the two Home Rule movements but the SHRA’s response to Irish Home Rule was defined by a deep and complex ambivalence. While sympathy and solidarity were expressed towards the Irish, several Scottish Home Rulers also felt that the Irish question was being prioritised over Scotland’s concerns, as Naomi Lloyd-Jones has thoroughly demonstrated.54 As a consequence, a number of Scottish Home Rulers were openly derogatory. Belittling Ireland, Blackie proposed that Home Rule should be granted to the ‘sober-minded sensible nation first’.55 The Irish question’s most significant influence on Scottish Home Rule was that Gladstone’s Home Rule proposals in the mid-1880s were felt to shift Scotland’s constitutional position and escalate its assimilation into a unified British nationality. An early SHRA election poster reveals Scottish anxieties around the proposed changes to the Union, in light of Irish Home Rule (Fig. i.1). The poster identifies several Scottish discontents with the Union, mostly financial, but a striking warning is also issued to the voters regarding the proposals to establish an Irish assembly and remove all Irish representatives from Westminster: ‘Beware of dividing the United Kingdom into only two Kingdoms: Britain and Ireland. SCOTTISH NATIONALITY WOULD BE LOST.’ The poster undoubtedly tries to stir a sense of fear amongst the electorate, but to dismiss the quotation as mere scare-mongering would ignore the very real threat that such proposals for Irish Home Rule posed to a key concept that had helped ensure the stability of the Anglo-Scottish Union throughout the nineteenth century: three-kingdom unionism.\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 12\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nFigure i.1 Home Rule for Scotland election poster (c.1886–92).

Unlike the ‘four-nation’ understanding of the British state that gained traction in the twentieth century, the United Kingdom was widely understood as being composed of three kingdoms, despite the fact that they were all, technically, one kingdom – the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (a seeming contradiction that reflects the ambiguity of the Acts of Union 1707, which simultaneously created a single kingdom and also implied the continuing existence of different kingdoms).56 In the nineteenth century, several newspapers divided their news reports into three different sections, corresponding to each of these ‘kingdoms’, and national campaigns tended to highlight the three-kingdom composition of the United Kingdom: during the 1832 Reform Bill demonstrations, for instance, processions were often headed by the flags of the three respective kingdoms. Internationally, the United Kingdom was also referred to as the ‘three kingdoms’: commenting on the Edith Lanchester scandal in 1895,57 The New York Times noted that the affair would ‘rivet the attention of the three kingdoms’.58 It is easy to see why three-kingdom unionism was an appealing paradigm to defenders of Scottish identity: considering that Scotland was the smallest of the three kingdoms, it elevated Scotland’s position to that of an equal with Ireland and England. But, crucially, three-kingdom unionism also recognised the continuing national distinctiveness of each ‘kingdom’ within the union, and implied that the state was an alliance of three peoples, rather than one assimilated, ‘British’ entity. It was this understanding of the United Kingdom that was felt to be under threat in the late nineteenth century from the proposals for an Irish assembly, as the SHRA poster demonstrates. Home Rulers worried that the creation of an Irish assembly, with representatives sitting in Ireland rather than Westminster, would create an alternative paradigm – not a three-kingdom state but a British and Irish state, where Scotland’s distinctive national presence would be absorbed into ‘Britain’. Connected to this issue, Scottish Home Rulers were also concerned that, without Irish members, Westminster parliaments would be more unbalanced: rather than being checked by both Irish and Scottish representatives, England’s dominance over Scotland would increase. Waddie wrote to The Scotsman that the 1886 proposal for Irish Home Rule would amount to ‘national assimilation’.59 These anxieties reveal the deeply complex relationship between Irish Home Rule and Scottish Home Rule.\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 14\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nTo some extent, the Irish Home Rule campaigns provided a model for Scots, but Gladstone’s proposals for Irish Home Rule were also felt to threaten Scotland’s constitutional position and nationality, which further fuelled the desire for Scottish Home Rule. The extent of the SHRA’s members’ discontent with Scotland’s constitutional position at the fin de siècle is reflected in the fact that they courted anti-Union rhetoric and imagery. Kidd is right to note that some SHRA figures ‘insisted’ on their commitment to unionism,60 but others strongly attacked the 1707 Union. Crichton-Stuart, for instance, wrote on the ‘evils of Union’ in an essay published by the SHRA,61 while Blackie noted that the 1707 Union was not a union, ‘for a Union implies the separate existence of two bodies acting together in fair partnership’.62 Like many others in the SHRA, Blackie mourned the fact that the federal union proposed by Fletcher of Saltoun in the early eighteenth century had not been adopted. The visual statements of the SHRA reflect these attacks on the 1707 Union and suggest an even more marked dissidence. The SHRA’s heraldry in 1891 (Fig. i.2), for instance, adopts the coat of arms of pre-Union Scotland, which forms a visual attack not only on the 1707 Union specifically but on any union altogether. The use of Scotland’s pre-Union heraldry was not limited to the SHRA’s pamphlets either – it can also be found in the form of a large bas-relief above\n\nFigure i.2 Heraldry of the Scottish Home Rule Association (1891). With thanks to the National Library of Scotland.\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 15\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n16\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nthe entrance of J. M. Dick Peddie’s National Bank of Scotland building on St Vincent Street, Glasgow (1898–1900). While the iconography of pre-Union Scotland was being distributed, some writings by SHRA associates also toy with the concept of Scottish independence. One early Vice-President of the SHRA, the Gaelic language activist Stuart Erskine, or Ruaraidh Erskine of Mar, flirts with the notion of an independent Scottish state in his article, ‘The Independency of Scotland’ (1892). Distinguishing between Home Rule and independence, and citing Poland’s oppression by Russia, Erskine states that ‘the right of Scotland to independence is the natural consequence of her right to exist’.63 Similarly, in 1902, The Fiery Cross printed an article calling for the ‘Repeal of the Unions’.64 Evidently, Scottish discontent with the constitution was not always couched within proud unionism at the fin de siècle. Discontent with Scotland’s constitutional position was not simply expressed by those in the Home Rule Association. A larger-scale expression of constitutional discontent was voiced in 1898, when ‘it seemed to some that the Scottish nation was under challenge’.65 This discontent was rooted in the ubiquitous use of the word ‘England’ when referring to Britain. By no means a new issue, the problem escalated at the fin de siècle with the growth of the state and the rise of English nationalism. D. G. Boyce argues that, with the emergence of an increasingly centralised British nation-state, England was ‘the shaper of that unified nation’s identity’. As a consequence, Boyce contends, ‘the concept of Britishness that was being evolved in the late-nineteenth century was quintessentially English, based on English power, institutions and political necessity’.66 Scottish resistance to the perceived anglicisation of the British state was reflected in a petition to Queen Victoria in 1898, organised by Napier, which was signed by 104,647 Scots, objecting to the use of ‘England’ when referring to Britain.67 This discontent further escalated in 1902 with Edward VII’s coronation. A number of Scots felt that Edward’s title was a further example of Englishness fusing with Britishness, as there had never been a King Edward of Great Britain or the United Kingdom before. Among the responses to this problem, a series of ‘Scotch patriotic medals’ were made to dissociate Britishness from Englishness. One such medal styled the king as ‘Edward I of Britain’ and proclaimed that ‘Our Army, Navy / Flag, Parl’t & King / All Are / British not English’, distilling the various complaints that were raised in Wanliss’s book, The Bars to British Unity (1885), a ‘protest against the Anglifying of the Scottish people’.68 Such medals, and\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 16\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nWanliss’s book, were far from anti-unionist; if anything, they reveal Scots’ concerns that unionism was being lost and that Scotland was becoming assimilated into England, or a heavily anglicised Britain. But they do none the less demonstrate increasingly vocal discontent with the way the Union was changing and a desire to defend what many felt to be Scotland’s increasingly compromised nationality. If Scots broadly felt themselves to be free and independent within the Union in the middle of the nineteenth century, this was increasingly less the case by the fin de siècle.\n\nCultural Revivalism in Scotland Home Rulers relied on cultural apparatus to advance their cause – embodied in Charles Waddie’s collection of propaganda poems, Scotia’s Darling Seat: A Home Rule Sermon and other poems (1890) – and they were keen to recruit key cultural figures to the SHRA. One figure they approached was the town planner, sociologist and publisher of The Evergreen, Patrick Geddes. Responding to an invitation to join the SHRA, Geddes reveals his tacit support for Scottish Home Rule, demonstrating one instance of cultural revivalism intersecting with constitutional politics in fin-de-siècle Scotland. Although Geddes declines the invitation to join the SHRA, expressing his broader disinterest in parliamentary politics, his ‘total dissent from contemporary political methods’, he adds: I believe I can do best service to the cause by working at the realities of the Scots Renascence. I believe [that] all the peers and members can do nothing real or permanent until the literary, the academic, the social, the industry movement of Renascence floats them on. [. . .] I must wait until I see the members of the home rule association furthering Scottish literature, work for Scotch Universities, Scottish art, Scottish industries of a very greater extent before I could join them.69\n\nFar from opposing the principle of Home Rule, Geddes here stresses that a cultural revival must anticipate and underpin Scottish Home Rule, and he imagines himself as helping to further that cause through ‘working at [. . .] the Scots Renascence’ – reviving the health of Scottish literature, art and history. Beyond this letter, Geddes’s writings reveal that he shared Scottish Home Rulers’ deep discontent with the United Kingdom’s constitutional arrangements. He was vigorously\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 17\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n18\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nopposed to political centralisation in London, preferring civic and regional autonomy. He stated: at present we have ‘the provinces’ all bowing to Westminster, whence they are granted doles; so their best people leave for London. They send their money to Westminster, which [. . .] is returned to some of them in the alluring form of ‘a grant’. But why not use this money themselves in the first place?\n\nAccording to Lewis Mumford, Geddes was also known to speak of ‘the imbecility of the cockney’, when referring to parliamentarians.70 Geddes’s conviction about devolution and regionalism was not limited to Anglo-Scottish relations – he believed in a wider process of decentralisation away from Westminster – but his strong critique of the concentration of power in London nevertheless echoes the views of several Home Rulers, including Blackie. As with those of the Home Rule associates, Geddes’s statements were by no means anti-Union – at one point, he declared his commitment to ‘the larger responsibilities of united nationality’ – but they do point to his discontent with constitutional dynamics in the United Kingdom.71 It was his belief in countering centralisation, as well as his desire to reanimate Scottish culture, that led Geddes to develop his concept of the ‘Scots Renascence’ – one of the central expressions of Scottish cultural revivalism at the fin de siècle. In ‘The Scots Renascence’ (1895), an essay that closes the first issue of The Evergreen, Geddes elaborates his theory of cultural revivalism. Here, he provides an assessment of Scottish culture, identifying both the ‘depressing’ state of Scottish nationality (134) and the emergent buds of revival. The essay opens with an account of Blackie’s funeral, where Geddes speaks of the Celtic scholar and Home Ruler as ‘the leader of nationality’, and describes the Scots as ‘a Renascent – ever renascent – unconquerably renascent people’ (132). But, despite this hopeful initial statement, Geddes goes on to describe the neglect of Scottish history and culture in his age. He argues that there has never been ‘so large a proportion of Scotsmen conscientiously educating their children outside every main element of that local and popular culture, that racial aptitude and national tradition, upon which full effectiveness at home, and even individual success elsewhere, have always depended’ (133). He laments that Scottish history ‘has become well-nigh unknown among us’, citing the ‘utter forgetfulness’ of people with regard to William Wallace’s ally, John de Graham, who the town of Grahamston is named after, and complaining that the ‘education we\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 18\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nboast of [. . .] steadily falls behind that of other European countries’ (pp. 134, 138–9). While noting the greatness of Robert Louis Stevenson, who had also recently died, Geddes fears that Scottish literature too is ‘disappear[ing]’, noting that ‘the vacant place of native literature [is] supplied with twaddle and garbage in varying proportion, settled by the fluctuation of newsagents’ imports’ (134). In the midst of such neglect of Scottish tradition, history and literature, Geddes expresses his anxiety over the ‘spoiling of what might be good Scots to make indifferent Englishmen’ (133), echoing Blackie’s concerns over Scottish anglicisation in the Victorian period. Geddes’s bleak assessment of Scottish culture here resembles Hugh MacDiarmid’s ‘over-determined impulse for Renaissance’ in the 1920s72: by dismissing his own or recent generations’ culture, he adds greater urgency to his proposals. But Geddes does not purely dismiss his contemporary culture; he also highlights signs of cultural awakening. For instance, he notes the rebirth of art in ‘our Western inferno of industry’ (135) – a reference to the Glasgow School – along with his appreciation of the emerging ‘literature of locality’, citing J. M. Barrie as a contributor to this movement (137). He also identifies a ‘renascent’ Scottish architecture and the ‘resuscitation of Old Edinburgh’ (135), which he sees as a marker of renewing care for Scottish history and tradition. Indeed, it is knowledge of, and rootedness in, tradition that Geddes believes will nurture a ‘mightier literature’ and culture more broadly (137). ‘The Scots Renascence’ closes with an implied recommendation that Scots should increasingly turn to Celtic art, literature and tradition to nourish the national culture, equating ‘our Scottish’ with ‘our Celtic Renascence’ (139). In equating Scottish culture with Celtic culture, Geddes was at times guilty of ‘a rather undiscriminating homogenization of Scotland’s self-image’,73 but, at other times, he was attentive to the plurality of Scottish culture and of Scottish Celticism itself. For instance, several of his projects reflect his conviction that Scotland was home to two differing Celtic traditions: a Fingalian Highland Celtic tradition and an Arthurian Lowland Celticism, which I examine in Chapter 5. To overcome the perceived processes of centralisation and anglicisation, and to nourish awareness of Scottish history and culture, Geddes designed an array of projects, several of which are discussed in detail in this book. His cultural centre and museum, the Outlook Tower in Edinburgh, was designed, as has been noted, ‘to recreate an active centre and so arrest the tremendous centralising power of the metropolis of London’, and from this base in the Lawnmarket\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 19\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n20\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nof Edinburgh he designed various projects underpinned by cultural revivalism. He planned a mural sequence of Scottish heroes (discussed in Chapter 3); published a series of Celtic Revival texts, including The Evergreen and the Celtic Library; produced historical pageants that highlighted Celtic contributions to art and culture; and helped design Scottish national institutions, including the Scottish National Zoological Park and a National Institute of Geography.74 Commenting on such efforts, Israel Zangwill praised Geddes’s resistance to the ‘centripetal force’, as well as his desire to ‘range [Edinburgh] again amongst the capitals of culture’.75 Geddes’s ‘Scots Renascence’, as a theory and a collection of initiatives, was undoubtedly the most extensive example of cultural revivalism in fin-de-siècle Scotland, which drew the attention of individuals from across the globe. But late Victorian cultural revivalism was by no means limited to Geddes and his projects, as Branford was attentive to. In the ‘Western inferno’, Glasgow, Charles Rennie Mackintosh was calling for architecture to be ‘more national’,76 and his work, and that of the Glasgow School more widely, demonstrates interest in Celtic design traditions and the Scottish architectural vernacular, which I explore in detail in Chapter 2. Given Mackintosh’s and others’ rootedness in Scottish tradition, and their fusing of that tradition with modernity, it is unsurprising that Geddes was highly appreciative of the work undertaken in Glasgow and proposed inviting the Glasgow School of Art into ‘our artistic movement’.77 Not only did Geddes describe Mackintosh’s Glasgow School of Art building as ‘one of the most important buildings in Europe’,78 but he organised a tour of the partially completed building, led by Mackintosh, to coincide with the 1901 International Exhibition in Glasgow.79 The kinship between the East and West Coast revivalists is further reflected in the contribution of Glasgow artists, such as E. A. Hornel, to The Evergreen, and it culminated in a collaboration between Geddes and Mackintosh: between the 1910s and 1920s, Geddes commissioned Mackintosh to design arcades for a town planning effort in Lucknow, India, as well as a war memorial (the designs for which are housed in the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow).80 Rather than being ‘little related’, there were many similarities between cultural developments in Scottish cities, as well as active collaboration between them, as this book explores more fully.81 Glasgow was also the main site of cultural nationalism in theatre, where Scottish developments were explicitly modelled on a key institution of the Irish Revival – the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. In 1908, the Scottish actor, playwright and founder of the Glasgow Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage, Graham Moffat, established the Scottish National Players in Glasgow to ‘follow the example\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 20\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nof the Irish National players at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and to provide something similar for Scotland’.82 The Irish influence was also evident in the Scottish Repertory Theatre (1909–14), which was established by Alfred Wareing, who had managed the Abbey Company and previously brought Abbey Theatre dramas to Scotland in 1907. Wareing had four aims for the Scottish Repertory, the final of which was to encourage the development of ‘purely Scottish drama [. . .] for the production of plays national in character, written by Scottish men and women of letters’.83 Although the Scottish Repertory Theatre broadly failed to nurture new Scottish theatrical talents, it did produce a number of dramas by Scottish playwrights, including several by J. M. Barrie, Robert Louis Stevenson and Neil Munro (who was a director of the Scottish Playgoers Company). The Scottish Repertory also brought a wealth of European dramatic talent to Scotland. From its base at Glasgow’s Royalty,84 the Repertory was the first theatre in the United Kingdom to stage Anton Chekhov, with its production of The Seagull in 1909,85 while works by Maurice Maeterlinck, Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw were also staged. Perhaps alluding to their common endeavours, the Scottish Repertory produced a six-night run of Irish revivalist plays in 1912, including Yeats and Lady Gregory’s Cathleen ni Houlihan. Beyond its cultural nationalist aims, the Repertory had socio-political significance in Glasgow: as Helen Corr notes, its productions of plays by Shaw and Ibsen inspired one of Glasgow’s most influential radicals and suffragettes, Helen Crawfurd.86 Beyond literature, art and theatre, cultural revivalism was also evident amongst Scottish musicians and language activists. Alongside the formation of the national orchestra, Scotland’s folk revival of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which built on renewed interest in the collection of folk ballads, saw the rise of such composers as Alexander Mackenzie, Hamish MacCunn and Learmont Drysdale, who produced arrangements of traditional Scottish songs.87 Marjory Kennedy Fraser, closely connected to Geddes’s circle, recorded and adapted various traditional songs in her Songs of the Hebrides volumes (from 1909), featuring lyrics in Gaelic and English. The preservation of Gaelic hymns and literature was primarily advanced by a contributor to The Evergreen, Alexander Carmichael, best known for his collection of Gaelic folklore, Carmina Gadelica, while Gaelic language activism was furthered by various figures, including the editor of The Highlander, John Murdoch, and Ruaraidh Erskine, who published the radical Gaelic language magazine, Guth na Bliadhna, between 1904 and 1925. Douglas Hyde, an Irish Gaelic revivalist who would go on to become the first President of Ireland in 1938,\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 21\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n22\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nnoted that the Gaelic Revival in Scotland was ‘much healthier and more vigorous’ than in Ireland,88 and, challenging the notion that Scots simply mimicked Irish developments, James Hunter argues that Scots forged ‘the link between Gaelic revivalism and nationalism’ before revivalists in Ireland did.89 These Gaelic Revival efforts were complemented by attempts to defend the Scots language: for instance, in his preface on Scottish Vernacular Literature (1898), T. F. Henderson calls for a revival of the study of literature written in Scots.90 The growing demand to consider Scottish literature as a distinct discipline to English literature – evidenced by St Andrews University changing its syllabus wording from ‘English Literature’ to ‘English and Scottish Literature’ in 1897,91 and the formation of a Chair in Scottish History and Literature at Glasgow in 1913 – permitted greater scholarly attention be devoted to literature written in Scots. While all of these figures were united in reviving Scottish artistic traditions or awareness of Scottish cultural history, they were not all natural bedfellows. There was disagreement and competition over the forms that revivalism should take. For instance, the novelist and playwright Neil Munro found the Celtic revivalism of Geddes’s circle to be inauthentic. He wrote: This so-called Celtic Revival in Edinburgh is a rather curious thing. It is engineered very largely, I think, by people of no Celtic pedigree, and perhaps the only Celtic scholar in it is Mr Alexander Carmichael.92\n\nPositioning himself in opposition to the supposed inauthenticity of Edinburgh’s revivalists, Munro, from Inveraray, cast himself as the reliable revivalist of Celtic culture, ‘expound[ing] the genuine Highland character and direct[ing] attention to the illimitable stores of romance and poetry still lying in the old glens’.93 As I outline in Chapter 1, Andrew Lang criticised the Geddesian renascence in similar terms. Such tensions reveal that cultural revivalism in Scotland was not only pervasive at the fin de siècle but polyvocal, existing in a range of contested, competing forms.\n\nDecadence and Revival Rather than providing an exhaustive study of the various forms of cultural revivalism that developed in late Victorian and Edwardian Scotland, this book instead examines Scottish cultural revivalism through a particular lens. In his short essay, ‘Scotland and Decadence’,\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 22\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nStuart Kelly provides the only focused assessment of Scotland’s relationship to fin-de-siècle decadence to date, concluding that there was very little relationship to comment on. According to Kelly, Scotland failed to nourish a decadent writer, artist or thinker around the 1890s, and he also suggests that Scotland and decadence are ‘oxymoronic’. Drawing on reductive stereotypes of life in Victorian Scotland, where ‘restraint and gravity became the cardinal virtues’, Kelly argues that it was impossible for the excessiveness, indulgence and ‘fecklessness’ of decadence to take root.94 In Kelly’s framing, Scotland was a fundamentally anti-decadent space, resistant to the decadent sensibility. Since Kelly, critics have offered more nuanced readings of the period: in his essay on late Victorian Scotland, Tom Hubbard identifies several symbolist and decadent tropes in Scottish art and literature, provocatively describing John Gourlay in George Douglas Brown’s The House with the Green Shutters (1901) as ‘the most decadent of decadents’.95 But Hubbard ultimately concludes that Scotland ‘was innocent of Max Nordau’s charges of “degeneration” ’,96 invoking Nordau’s influential theory that the fin-de-siècle art was ‘degenerate’, prioritising immorality, irrationality and mysticism. In contrast to these understandings that portray Scotland as free from either decadence or degeneration, I demonstrate in this book that cultural revivalist literature and art were often underpinned by fin-de-siècle dissidence. Not only were Scottish revivalists inspired by the styles and ideas of decadent writers, artists and thinkers across Europe, and influenced those abroad, but their work embodied several of the features of ‘degeneration’ that Nordau outlined. Fin-de-siècle decadence and symbolism, I contend, played vital roles in supporting and defining Scottish cultural revivalism. Decadence and degeneration are closely related terms. Decadence, a term that ‘derives from the Latin decadēre, a “falling down” or “falling away” ’,97 was often used as a derogatory label in the late Victorian period to critique people, ideas or groups that were felt to be working ‘against the grain’ of industrial, scientific, moral and commercial progress. ‘Decadents’ were characterised as ‘over-civilised’ or as actively attempting to undermine Victorian civilisation and progress through their valorisation of past ages, be they Ancient Greece or the Caroline era.98 Indeed, figures associated with decadence (several of whom subversively adopted the derogatory label) were known to participate in ‘neo’, or revival, movements that celebrated ideas or concepts that were privileged in previous eras, including the new hedonism, new paganism, the Occult Revival, neo-Catholicism and the Jacobite Revival. On account of its adherents’ ambivalence\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 23\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n24\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\ntowards modernity and their willed returns to the past, decadence, like Nordau’s degeneration, was felt to be the ‘enemy of progress’.99 Instead of endorsing the stadialist notion that societies gradually improve through a series of developmental stages, several decadent writers countered that ‘historical crescendo predicted by the believers in progress’ by arguing that industry, commerce and rationalism embodied cultural decline.100 In their revivalist attempts to reanimate supposedly better ages or ideas from the past, many figures associated with decadence came into rhetorical proximity to cultural revivalists. George Moore was one decadent figure who, when mourning the ‘deadened conformity’ of late Victorian life, lamented the loss of ‘national’ traditions, noting that ‘the kilt is going or gone in the Highlands’.101 For Moore, the preservation of national traditions was an important means of staving off the unbridled advance of ‘progress’. In contrast to the increasingly dominant critical view that decadence was essentially ‘anti-national’,102 this book reminds us that, alongside the cosmopolitan facets of decadence, there were numerous instances when decadence and cultural (and political) nationalism intersected at the fin de siècle. Indeed, another Irishman, one of the most emblematic figures of decadence, Oscar Wilde, very explicitly styled himself as an Irish nationalist on his American tour, declaring that ‘we in Ireland are fighting for the principle of autonomy against empire, for independence against centralisation’.103 With Wilde and Moore, we see the capacity for decadence and nationalism to co-habit. If decadence indicates ‘the individuation of parts’, a theory that Regenia Gagnier explores in detail by building on claims by Paul Bourget, Havelock Ellis and Friedrich Nietzsche that literary decadence represented the triumph of individuation (the breakdown of the whole to the part), it is unsurprising that cultural revivalism and decadence overlapped on several occasions. Like decadent individuation, national revival movements, such as the Irish Revival, hoped to differentiate, to individuate, their nation from a larger entity or ‘whole’.104 The decadent counter-culture and cultural nationalisms were by no means mutually exclusive. The intersection of cultural revivalism and decadence was no less apparent in Scotland. As I demonstrate throughout this book, in their attempts to revive traditions and critique stadialist understandings of historical progress, Scottish revivalists frequently performed decadent styles and participated in movements that the likes of Nordau would class as ‘degenerate’, including neo-paganism, occultism, japonisme and neo-Jacobitism, to stimulate their cultural revival. The\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 24\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nEvergreen alone provides a clear example of this, as a Scottish revivalist magazine that featured many decadent facets, including ‘ScotoBeardsleyan’ illustrations that were clearly inspired by The Yellow Book.105 Throughout the magazine, we witness cultural revivalists’ concern with paganism, neo-Jacobitism, occultism, neo-Catholicism and Japan. These features led one critic for The Glasgow Herald to refer to The Evergreen as a ‘neo-Catholic, purified-pagan’ magazine, an assessment that I elaborate on in Chapters 3 and 4, while The Scotsman described it as a ‘sort of Scottish “Yellow Book” ’.106 As this quotation suggests, The Evergreen was not straightforwardly decadent, if any fin-de-siècle text was. The publisher, Geddes, was himself inconsistent in his evaluations of decadence, as I reveal in Chapter 3, and this ambivalence underpins the wider ‘ferment of decadence and anti-decadence’ in the magazine.107 Nevertheless, there were clear decadent facets to The Evergreen that underpinned and defined much fin-de-siècle Scottish revivalist art and literature. Even The Evergreen’s London-based counterpart, The Yellow Book, was a site for expressing Scottish cultural nationalism. This is especially marked in D. Y. Cameron’s illustrations for the front cover and spine of the eighth issue of The Yellow Book. By this point, following the scandal of the Wilde trial in 1895, The Yellow Book’s editors tried to distance the magazine from London’s culture of decadence, and contributions from further afield were actively solicited. This context most clearly informs the eighth issue, where the Glasgow School provides all of the visual art decorations, including the front cover. This cover design explicitly highlights the Scottish contribution, as well as the Glasgow-specific emphasis, through the emblems that are depicted: alongside the thistle that appears on the spine of this volume, Cameron’s front cover includes the four symbols of Glasgow’s heraldry in a shield: the tree, bird, fish and bell (Fig. i.3). Flanking this shield sit a unicorn on the left and a lion on the right, alluding to the Scottish styling of union heraldry. As such, the iconography here is unionist, but there is an element of national resistance to this design too. The most telling feature of the cover is the boat in the background, which features a lion rampant flag (the Scottish royal standard) flying at its stern. This feature forms a visual riposte to the standardised back cover design of The Yellow Book from the sixth issue onwards, which presents the bow of a very similar ship, decorated with an English bulldog. By imagining the stern of the ship with a Scottish flag, Cameron not only writes Scotland visually into the culture of decadence but asserts Scotland’s distinctive presence in the Union too.\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 25\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n26\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\nFigure i.3 D. Y. Cameron, front cover design for The Yellow Book, 8 (1896). University of Glasgow Library, Special Collections.\n\nThe place where Scottish cultural revivalism and decadence most commonly intersected was the Celtic Revival – a loose movement consisting of a range of initiatives concerned with Celtic myth, literature, art, languages and music at the fin de siècle. Many figures associated with fin-de-siècle decadence were involved in the Celtic Revival, such as W. B. Yeats, who was one of the leading lights of Irish Celticism and also a member of the Rhymers’ Club in London, a poetry club that attracted numerous decadent figures, including Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Symons, Oscar Wilde and John Gray (several of whom were also from Ireland or Wales). For the poet Edward\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 26\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nThomas, Celticism was, at its root, decadent: he labelled ‘these lovers of the Celt a class of “decadents”, not unrelated to Mallarmé’, on account of their mutual love of the impractical, their resistance to the mercantile and their concern with what William Sharp termed ‘the beauty of beauty’.108 But, while Thomas is right to note that there were common features that bound several Celtic revivalists to decadence, it is also important to note how amorphous the Celtic Revival was. Although there were attempts to bring Celtic revivalists from across the United Kingdom and Brittany together through such initiatives as the Pan-Celtic Congress meetings, the third of which was held in Edinburgh in 1907,109 divisions and polyvocality defined Celtic revivalism. Not only were there tensions between the differing nations’ styles of Celtic revivalism (Irish revivalists were keen to distance themselves from some developments in Scotland, and vice versa, as I explore in Chapter 3), but also there were tensions amongst Celtic revivalists within particular nations. For instance, as some Celtic revivalists in Scotland embraced Matthew Arnold’s presentation of the Celt as intuitive, feminine and politically ineffectual – a paradigm discussed in greater detail in Chapters 1 and 3 – others complicated this understanding. Due to the amorphous nature of fin-de-siècle Celticism, it has come to occupy a contested space in understandings of national identity on the British Isles. As Daniel Williams argues: From one perspective Celticism is a product of English epistemological mastery and political domination, an internal form of Orientalism in which the feminine, superstitious, and poetic Celt could be easily accommodated as a junior partner in the British Imperial adventure. From another, Celticism offers a radical reconceptualization of national identities within the British Isles, fostering new avenues of dialogue and artistic and political collaboration.110\n\nThe first part of this quotation builds on Joep Leersen’s view that Celticism was ‘imposed from outside’ on to the Celtic nations, by the likes of Ernest Renan and Arnold. Renan and Arnold, despite finding admirable qualities amongst ‘the Celts’, ultimately portray ‘Saxons’ as ‘the agents of history’, and only allow the Celts the opportunity ‘to contribute their sensuality, femininity and natural magic’ to Saxon progress. In Renan’s and Arnold’s paradigms, Williams contends, the Celt is ‘invited to assimilate’.111 But alongside these assimilationist valences, Williams also identifies more disruptive aspects of Celticism. Certainly in Ireland, Celtic identity was weaponised as a key\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 27\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n28\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\ntool for cultural and military resistance, and some Irish revivalists relied on Arnold’s stress on Celtic separation and otherness to do so. For Williams, Yeats’s embrace of Arnoldian notions of the Celt provides an example of ‘the ways in which a colonised author appropriates the stereotypes ascribed to his people by an imperial power and turns them into positive attributes’.112 This endeavour to recast supposedly backward, ‘Celtic’ traits – such as superstition and mysticism – into markers of civility and authority was also evident in Scotland, as I illustrate in Chapters 2 and 4. While we find evidence of Arnoldian Celticism being deployed to accommodate Scotland, I demonstrate here that the Scottish turn towards the Celt, like its turn towards decadence, also nourished a resistance to assimilation and an assertion of Scotland’s cultural difference. To illustrate and examine the development of Scottish cultural revivalism, and the ways it relied on dissident fin-de-siècle movements that critiqued ‘civilisation’, I begin by exploring the work of Robert Louis Stevenson, and the Scottish romance revivalists more widely. Chapter 1 argues that several of Stevenson’s works were both proto-Celtic revivalist and proto-decadent in their critique of civilisation, and that the adventure romance genre was an important cultural apparatus for interrogating Victorian Scottish society’s supposed divisions and for promoting greater national cohesion. The second chapter unlocks how internationally attuned Scottish revivalist writers and artists were, looking to other nations and traditions to inspire their revival of Scottish myths, crafts and literatures. I focus here on two international connections that Scottish revivalists were particularly keen to develop, one with the decadent and symbolist writers of Young Belgium and the other with Japan. I also demonstrate the ways in which these connections helped form a cross-border counter-hegemony that sought to resist the marginalisation of traditional cultures or smaller nations. A central facet of fin-de-siècle cultural revivalism across Europe was myth-making, and Chapter 3 examines the ways in which Celtic and Mediterranean paganisms were embraced and appropriated by Scottish cultural revivalists in order to fashion mythological origins and a collection of heroes to help bind the nation. This chapter also reveals the ways in which resistance to neo-paganism and cultural revivalism were voiced in Scotland, focusing on the work of John Davidson. Allied to neo-paganism was the Occult Revival, which several Scottish revivalists participated in, as I demonstrate in Chapter 4. Occultism’s proximity to neo-Catholicism and neo-Jacobitism made it especially attractive to Scottish cultural revivalists, who often associated\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 28\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n29\n\npre-Reformation Scotland with healthier days of Scottish nationality. Not only did cultural revivalists participate in the Golden Dawn and the Theosophical Society, but some attempted to create an equivalent occult order to Yeats’s Celtic Mysteries in Edinburgh. The final chapter examines a lesser-studied aspect of fin-de-siècle theatre – the Pageantry Revival. I demonstrate that a range of Scottish cultural revivalists embraced these processional, dramatic displays of history to distribute the particular myths of descent that they had created in their fiction and art to wider audiences. Through their turns to various aspects of Scotland’s past, and their participation in decadence and symbolism, the figures considered in this study mounted a ‘proto-modernist critique of civilisation’, which, they felt, was devaluing tradition and compromising their cultures and identities.113\n\nNotes 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27.\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 29\n\nBranford, ‘Old Edinburgh and the Evergreen’: 88.

As archetypal role models for this revival of nationality, Geddes selects and equates two figures that are rarely considered together by contemporary critics: Robert Louis Stevenson and John Stuart Blackie. These figures had died within three months of each other – Stevenson in December 1894 and Blackie in March 1895 – which prompts Geddes to reflect on their funerals, in Samoa and Edinburgh respectively, and to evaluate their contributions to Scottish life: From this pageant of Edinburgh it is but one step in thought to that solitary Samoan hill, up which dusky chiefs and clansmen, henceforth also brethren of ours, as he of theirs, were so lately bearing our other greatest dead – the foremost son of Edinburgh and Scotland. The leader of nationality in ripest age, the leader of literature in fullest prime, have alike left us. Each was in his own way ‘Ultimus Scotorum’; each in his own way the link with our best days of nationality and genius.1\n\nIn this quotation, Geddes treads a fine line between revivalism and twilight. On the one hand, Blackie and Stevenson are portrayed as the leaders of nationality, ripe and full. The admirable contribution these two figures have made to the health of Scottish nationality, in Geddes’s eyes, is their full engagement with Scottish history, along with their endeavours to place Scottish culture in dialogue with the wider world; both refused to submit to the ‘fool’s paradise’ of ‘narrower’ nationality (134). Their ability to unify Scotland is also highlighted by Geddes, reflected in the lexis he adopts to describe the\n\n6169_Shaw.indd 33\n\n19/09/19 4:38 PM\n\n34\n\nThe Fin-de-Siècle Scottish Revival\n\n‘tens of thousands’ at Blackie’s funeral, with such words as ‘uniting’, ‘merged’, ‘communion’, ‘multitude’, ‘chorus’ and ‘interpulsating’ (pp. 131–2). But, alongside these evocations of the health of Scottish nationality, embodied by these two figures, Geddes also implies that Scotland has lost its greatest defenders. They were not only surviving links with Scotland’s greatest days, but also ‘Ultimus Scotorum’ – the last of old Scotland.2 Geddes’s response to their deaths is a call to action; he feels the need to foster cultural revivalism to continue their legacy and, as Blackie and Stevenson did, recover ‘our best days of nationality and genius’. Although they may be dead, Geddes implies that, through Stevenson and Blackie’s examples, Scottish nationality can revive, like ‘the little mound of heather, opening into bloom’ on Blackie’s coffin (132). Despite Geddes’s deep appreciation for Stevenson’s writing and his intention to publish a volume of his work,3 Stevenson’s work and the broader culture of adventure romance fiction written by Scots in this period are very seldom considered in relation to Geddes’s projects or the wider interest in fin-de-siècle Scottish cultural revivalism. Indeed, even though the Scottish writers of the Romance Revival – including Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Andrew Lang, J. M. Barrie, Violet Jacob and John Buchan – all wrote on Scotland and many formed friendships with each other, there has yet to be a sustained consideration of them as a loose, vibrant group, responding to Scottish (among other) contexts. This chapter demonstrates that these writers’ representations of Scottish nationality bore several similarities, and that they all contributed to advancing Scottish cultural revivalism (albeit in differing ways). Each of the figures examined here not only helped lay the ground for greater national cohesion in Scotland, through interrogating the commonplace nineteenth-century notion of Scotland as a nation divided between Highland Celts and Lowland Saxons, but several of their romance writings also portray Scottish culture as threatened, and mock or defy attempts to assimilate Scottish culture into British or English culture. In doing so, several of these texts were concerned with defending Scottish cultural distinctiveness. We also find fin-de-siècl"
