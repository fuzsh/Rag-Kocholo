        "text": "It seems always to have been assumed that the progenitor of the family of de Moravia was an individual called Freskyn (Freskin or Francis) who settled in the north sometime during the reign of King David I (1124-52). Freskyn was a man of high repute and, before he even arrived in what is now Morayshire, he had already obtained a substantial estate, in Linlithgowshire (West Lothian), which was known as Strathbrock or Strabrock (‘the vale of the badger’). Many writers have described him as being a Fleming - largely because he bore a name that was common in that country – but there is no absolute proof that he was from Flanders. Indeed, as this paper progresses, we may find that we are directed towards an alternative construct which would suggest that Freskyn had some English/Welsh roots.\n\nWhen we think of genealogies in medieval Scotland our minds might turn at once to Gaelic, the Celtic language that was spoken in the Middle Ages from the southern tip of Ireland to the northernmost coast of Scotland. This is not unnatural. Texts that trace the ancestry of a notable individual generation by generation survive in their hundreds from the medieval Gaelic world. They are found today almost exclusively in late-medieval Irish manuscripts. Some genealogies originated in collections made as early as the tenth century. Presumably there were once many Scottish manuscripts containing genealogies, too. A reason why they would not have survived is that, in the Scottish kingdom during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Gaelic learned orders who would have had a primary interest in writing and copying this material declined in significance and ceased to participate in Gaelic literate culture. This chapter will open with a brief survey of medieval genealogical texts relating ...\n\nThe paper focuses on four crosier fragments, which represent the total survival from the Early Christian period, and which have not all been published together before. The paper is a by-product of the author&#39;s PhD thesis which, in re-assessing the dates and contexts of a number of Irish artefacts, forced a general reassessment of the metalwork as a whole. The crosiers are closely related to those of pre-Norman Ireland, and demonstrate close contact between the craftsmen of Scotland and the northern half of Ireland. Indeed, the crosier ofSt Fillan and the cast drop from Hoddom point to the possible settling in Scotland of Irish craftsmen. However, the evidence also suggests that the Scottish tradition lagged approximately 50 years behind the Irish and it seems that, if Irish craftsmen indeed settled in Scotland, they continued to work in the manner current at their departure. The crosiers are treated in categories according to their structure and decoration, before being related ..."
