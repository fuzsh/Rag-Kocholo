        "text": "\"Scottish Gaels had a large corpus of pre-existing cultural concepts and oral narratives which influenced the ways in which they perceived First Nations and their relationships with them. In many cases Gaels drew direct parallels from their own inheritance to the languages and cultures of First Nations. In the 19th century in particular Gaels encountered new paradigms of identity and metanarratives of history developed in the course of European imperialism whose power to reorder the world made them difficult to resist; eventually these incoming concepts were absorbed to a greater or lesser degree as Gaelic communities interacted with the wider anglophone world. Regardless, understanding the Scottish Highland experience in North America cannot be complete without a serious consideration of Gaelic texts, which reveal the synchronic developments of the internal reference points which informed Gaelic mentality and culture, and, in turn, collective and individual action. This contribution offers some observations and proposes a tentative framework for a line of scholarship which is yet in its infancy in Celtic Studies but which will complement parallel lines of enquiry about the complex unfolding relationships between European and native peoples in North America.\"\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson is well known as a writer of popular Victorian adventures, yet much of his fiction is steeped in the cultural and historical preoccupations of Scotland. Texts such as 'Kidnapped' (1886), 'The Master of Ballantrae' (1889), and 'Catriona' (1893) hinge upon culturally significant events such as the Jacobite Rising of 1745 and the Appin Murder. These works also allude to the Highland Clearances of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the Battle of Culloden with its ensuing disarming acts—all occurrences which contributed to or comprised significant catalysts for the large-scale expulsion of Scots from their homeland. Certainly, themes of exile pervade Stevenson’s Scottish work and maintain a more liminal presence in his later South Seas fiction, and many of the author’s finest characters can be read as enactments of temporary or permanent expatriates whose real-life counterparts form a fascinating cross-section of the diasporic movement. This paper focuses on several of these characters, whose adventures are encoded into their corresponding texts as fictional re-constructions of a broader experience common to displaced Scots in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some are driven from Scotland as a direct result of economic hardship or domestic conflict, while others leave (at least temporarily) as a means of avoiding the political corruption and intrigue characteristic of the historical struggle for Scottish independence. Through characters like David Balfour, Alan Breck Stewart, James Durie, and Archie Weir, Stevenson explores the psychological ramifications of politically enforced and self-imposed exile, thus providing fictional extrapolations of the Scottish diasporic experience. These portrayals, infused with a the author’s own experiences abroad, offer fascinating microcosms which gesture towards the collective experience of a wide-scale network of displaced Scots in the Victorian world. An early version of this paper was presented at the NAVSA 2012 'Victorian Networks' conference hosted by the University of Wisconsin at Madison.\n\nDiscourses of Gaelic language revitalization in Scotland are analyzed as examples of Greg Urban’s ‘metaculture’ in order to gain a better understanding of how people attempt sociolinguistic change through minority language revitalization efforts. After describing the 18th-century emergence of ‘discourses of revitalization and redemption’ about Gaelic, this paper analyzes seven different themes or predications about Gaelic made in the 18th through 20th centuries to justify its salvation. I demonstrate how the discourses constitute metacultural and meta-linguistic commentaries on cultural and linguistic practices, and how previously circulating elements of culture, including language ideologies and affective stances, are dialogically contained within each creative revitalizing response and facilitate its circulation."
