        "text": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a British writer who achieved global acclaim primarily for his creation of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Born on May 22, 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland, he was educated at Stonyhurst School and later studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. During this time, Doyle began writing short stories, marking the inception of his literary career. Although he initially struggled to find success as an author, Doyle's fortunes changed dramatically with the introduction of Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet, published in 1887. Holmes, with his distinctive deerstalker hat, pipe, and razor-sharp deductive reasoning, quickly captured the public's imagination. The character's popularity was so vast that, despite Doyle's attempt to kill off Holmes in The Final Problem to focus on other literary endeavors, public demand led him to resurrect the detective in subsequent stories. Beyond his contributions to detective fiction, Doyle was also known for his work in the genres of science fiction, historical novels, plays, and romances. He was a prolific writer, penning over 200 works in his lifetime. Additionally, Doyle had a deep interest in spiritualism and the paranormal, which significantly influenced his later works. His life and career were marked by a constant quest for truth, whether through the logical deductions of his famous detective or his exploration of the supernatural. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle passed away on July 7, 1930, but his legacy lives on through his enduring characters and stories.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson (13 November 1850 – 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist and travel writer, most noted for Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and A Child's Garden of Verses. Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life, but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse, Leslie Stephen and W. E. Henley, the last of whom may have provided the model for Long John Silver in Treasure Island. Stevenson spent several years in search of a location suited to his health, before finally settling in Samoa, where he died. A celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson attracted a more negative critical response for much of the 20th century, though his reputation has been largely restored. He is currently ranked as the 26th most translated author in the world.\n\nIain Banks (16 February 1954 – 9 June 2013) was a Scottish author. He wrote mainstream fiction under the name Iain Banks and science fiction as Iain M. Banks, including the initial of his adopted middle name Menzies ( (listen)). After the publication and success of The Wasp Factory (1984), Banks began to write on a full-time basis. His first science fiction book, Consider Phlebas, was released in 1987, marking the start of the Culture series. His books have been adapted for theatre, radio and television. In 2008, The Times named Banks in their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". In April 2013, Banks announced that he had inoperable cancer and was unlikely to live beyond a year. He died on 9 June 2013.\n\nSir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, (; 9 May 1860 – 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (first included in Barrie's adult novel The Little White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, a \"fairy play\" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland. Although he continued to write successfully, Peter Pan overshadowed his other work, and is credited with popularising the name Wendy. Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents. Barrie was made a baronet by George V on 14 June 1913, and a member of the Order of Merit in the 1922 New Year Honours. Before his death, he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, which continues to benefit from them.\n\nGeorge MacDonald (10 December 1824 – 18 September 1905) was a Scottish author, poet and Christian minister. He was a pioneering figure in the field of fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow writer Lewis Carroll. In addition to his fairy tales, MacDonald wrote several works on Christian apologetics. His writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors including W. H. Auden, J. M. Barrie, Lord Dunsany, Hope Mirrlees, Robert E. Howard, L. Frank Baum, T.H. White, Lloyd Alexander, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Walter de la Mare, E. Nesbit, Peter S. Beagle, Neil Gaiman and Madeleine L'Engle.C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his \"master\": \"Picking up a copy of Phantastes one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read. A few hours later\", said Lewis, \"I knew that I had crossed a great frontier.\" G. K. Chesterton cited The Princess and the Goblin as a book that had \"made a difference to my whole existence\".Elizabeth Yates wrote of Sir Gibbie, \"It moved me the way books did when, as a child, the great gates of literature began to open and first encounters with noble thoughts and utterances were unspeakably thrilling.\"Even Mark Twain, who initially disliked MacDonald, became friends with him, and there is some evidence that Twain was influenced by him. The Christian author Oswald Chambers wrote in his \"Christian Disciplines\" that \"it is a striking indication of the trend and shallowness of the modern reading public that George MacDonald's books have been so neglected\"."
