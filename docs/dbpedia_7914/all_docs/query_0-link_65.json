Cunninghame Graham (Don Roberto, as he was affectionately known in South America) was born into a noble Scottish family, the paternal line of which went back to Robert II and the Earls of Menteith. He was also a descendant of Robert Graham (whose biography he wrote), the poet of \"If Doughty Deeds My Lady Please.\" Between 1886 and 1892, as a liberal member of Parliament for the mining constituency of North-West Lanark, he rode on his horse to the House of Commons. This flamboyant gesture was typical of the man, as was his unremitting fight for better working conditions for the colliers, chain makers, and others of the underprivileged whom he considered to be the victims of cruel exploitation and an appallingly unfair class system. That he himself came from an aristocratic background in no way deterred him in his struggle. Always politically active, he had a social conscience that led to a sentence of six weeks in prison for his part in the 1888 Trafalgar Square Riots.\n\nAlthough born a Scottish landowner, Graham and his Chilean-born wife, Gabriela (a writer of not inconsiderable talent), spent much of their time abroad. Fluent in Spanish and a prolific writer in English of sketches, essays, polemical articles, travel books, histories, and stories, Graham wrote of the pampas and grouchos, amongst whom he lived and worked, and his beloved horses in The Horses of the Conquest, one of his last books, as well as in The Ipané and Rodeo. In these collections he describes in vivid detail the people and animals of South America. At heart an adventurer, Graham was in his element riding under the South American sun and exulting in the freedom the wide pampas offered, which he described as \"all grass and sky, and sky and grass, and still more sky and grass.\"\n\nIn his well-known collection Success Graham contrasts material, worldly success with gallant failure, to the former's disadvantage. Perhaps his most consistently interesting volume is Scottish Stories, a compilation of all his stories about Scottish personalities. There is a typical and entertaining irony in \"Christie Christison\" (1912), which recounts the experience of a sailor home on leave and full of lust. He finds in the brothel not only his daughter but also his wife, whom he excuses on the grounds that he had given her a \"daud\" (hit her) before he left.\n\nGraham included many authors among his circle of friends—Oscar Wilde, Joseph Conrad, and Bernard Shaw, among others. Indeed, Shaw used Graham as a basis for Sergius in Arms and the Man, and he admitted that without Graham's incomparable Mogrebel-Acksa, an account of his attempt to reach the forbidden city of Tarudant, Captain Brassbound's Conversion would not have been written.\n\nAlthough Graham wrote more than 30 books, he never wrote a novel, confining himself in fiction to the short story. While he enjoyed personal notoriety during his lifetime and his literary significance was recognized, his work later was sadly neglected. The vitality of the man is reflected in the vigor of his prose, his meticulous eye for detail in his flashing descriptions of people and animals, and his lyric sensitivity in the manner in which he encapsulates the essence of time and place.\n\n—Joyce Lindsay"
