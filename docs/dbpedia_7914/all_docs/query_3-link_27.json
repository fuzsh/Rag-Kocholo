But in a long and remarkable life he was also a prolific writer, horseman, traveller, adventurer, visionary, internationalist and humanitarian.\n\nThis two-day event brings together specialists in different aspects of his life and work to build a portrait of one of the most significant, yet overlooked, figures of late 19th and early 20th century Scottish political and cultural life; and to ask the question: what can we learn from him today about Scotland and the wider world?\n\nTickets for full weekend £33\n\nTickets from Eventbrite HERE\n\nThe weekend is organised by the Cunninghame Graham Society and hosted by the Stirling Smith Art Gallery & Museum. It is generously supported by Foundation Scotland, Gartmore House and Gartmore Heritage Society.\n\nOther Events at The Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum\n\nSimilar events you might like...\n\nFind other events in Stirling"
