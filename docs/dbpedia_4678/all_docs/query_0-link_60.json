        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Scarlet Street (1945)\n\nLowest Rated: 43% House of Dark Shadows (1970)\n\nBirthday: Feb 27, 1910\n\nBirthplace: Palisades, New Jersey, USA\n\nPersonable, extremely pretty and prolific star of a wide range of films in the 1930s and 40s. Bennett began her film career as a demure blonde ingenue (e.g. in George Cukor's \"Little Women\" 1933, William K. Howard's breathtaking \"The Trial of Vivienne Ware\" 1932). Raoul Walsh's delightful \"Me and My Gal\" (1932), though, did give her an offbeat chance to indulge in sharp wisecracking. Early on her acting abilities seemed a bit modest, but Bennett's warm speaking voice and quietly piquant charm gave her considerable appeal as a screen personality.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% Father's Little Dividend\n\n100% Scarlet Street\n\n94% Suspiria\n\n93% Man Hunt\n\n90% Father of the Bride\n\n89% Little Women\n\n88% There's Always Tomorrow\n\n86% The Woman in the Window\n\nPhotos\n\nSUSPIRIA, JOAN BENNETT, 1977 ARTISTS AND MODELS ABROAD, Joan Bennett wearing gold lame negligee designed by Edith Head, 1938 COLONEL EFFINGHAM'S RAID, (aka MAN OF THE HOUR), William Eythe, Joan Bennett, 1946, TM and copyright ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.
