        "text": "Joan Bennett was born May 4, 1935 in Evanston, IL. She passed away peacefully February 2, 2021 at her home in Lake Barrington.\n\nFamily was the cornerstone of Joan's life and she loved nothing more than being with family. She was an avid gardener and bridge player. Joan retired from Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary as a conference planner. She also worked for the Barrington Historical Society and began her career as an elementary school teacher.\n\nJoan is survived by her children, Susan, Stephen (Lisa), and David (Diane); grandchildren, Sophie, Lindsey (Dan) Cox, Lauren (Nate) Gustin, Matthew, Kimberly (fiancé Max Arpadi), Mark, and Scott; and great grandchildren, Kassidy, Kayleigh, and Bradley. She was preceded in death by her husband of 43 years, Donald in 2001; and her parents, Herman and Leone Riedel.\n\nVisitation will be 9am until the time of the funeral service at 11am, Saturday February 13 at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, 337 Ridge Road, Barrington Hills. Due to Covid restrictions, attendance for the service is limited.\n\nPrivate burial, for family only, will follow at Evergreen Cemetery, Barrington.\n\nIn lieu of flowers memorial donations may be made to St. Mark Episcopal Church, or to the Barrington Historical Society."
