While Constance became one of the highest paid actresses of the pre-Code era in a string of stunning hits, Joan languished in featured parts in lesser films. Joan’s career began its uptick when she costarred in the massively successful Little Women (1933).\n\nIn the late 30s, she began a collaboration with director Fritz Lang in a series of stunning noirs that saw the blonde Joan change to darker tresses. Also, at one point her husband shot her lover in the dick. Joan Bennett moved to television in the 50s, gaining nerd immortality on gothic soap opera “Dark Shadows.” She passed away in 1990.\n\nJoan Bennett’s Pre-Code Filmography\n\nPuttin on the Ritz (1930)\n\nCrazy That Way (1930)\n\nMoby Dick (1930)\n\nMaybe It’s Love (1930)\n\nScotland Yard (1930)\n\nMany a Slip (1931)\n\nDoctors’ Wives (1931)\n\nHush Money (1931)\n\nShe Wanted a Millionaire (1932)\n\nCareless Lady (1932)\n\nThe Trial of Vivienne Ware (1932)\n\nWeek Ends Only (1932)\n\nWild Girl (1932)\n\nMe and My Gal (1932)\n\nArizona to Broadway (1933)\n\nLittle Women (1933)\n\nStudios\n\nFox Films\n\nRKO\n\nWarner Brothers\n\nVideos of Joan Bennett\n\nA 1981 interview with her.\n\nBiography of Joan Bennett\n\nJoan Bennett Sites and Links\n\nIMDB\n\nTCMDB\n\nWikipedia\n\nOther Actresses to Explore"
