        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor, a name synonymous with glamour and allure, was a British-American actress who etched her mark in the golden era of Hollywood. Born on February 27, 1932, in London to American parents, she moved to Los Angeles before the outbreak of World War II where her beauty attracted the attention of film studios. The young starlet's first taste of fame came with the film National Velvet in 1944, which catapulted the twelve-year-old into overnight stardom. Over the course of her six-decade-long career, Taylor appeared in more than 50 films, earning recognition for her talent as much as her striking violet eyes. Taylor's personal life often garnered as much attention as her professional one. She was married eight times, notably twice to actor Richard Burton, an affair that began scandalously on the set of Cleopatra in 1963. Her turbulent relationships, health issues, and battles with addiction were often publicized, yet she remained unapologetic about her choices. Despite her tumultuous personal journey, Taylor's acting prowess remained undiminished. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress - for Butterfield 8 in 1960 and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966, cementing her place among Hollywood's greats. Beyond her acting career, Taylor was a vocal and dedicated philanthropist. After her close friend Rock Hudson died of AIDS in the mid-1980s, she became deeply involved in raising awareness about the disease. She co-founded the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) and established the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, both of which have made significant contributions to HIV/AIDS research, education, and patient care. Elizabeth Taylor passed away in 2011, leaving behind a legacy as a versatile actress, a passionate activist, and a woman who lived her life on her own terms.\n\nKate Mara, an American actress born in February 1983 in Bedford, New York, has etched a remarkable imprint in the world of acting. Raised in a family with deep roots in the National Football League (NFL), Mara chose to carve out a different path for herself in the entertainment industry. Her paternal family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers while her maternal side owns the New York Giants. Despite this sports-driven environment, Mara found her true calling in performing arts. Mara's journey began early, as she was bit by the acting bug at just nine years old when she attended a Broadway musical. She started her career in television, making guest appearances in shows like Law & Order and ER. However, it was her role as reporter Zoe Barnes on the critically acclaimed Netflix series House of Cards that catapulted her to international fame. This role not only showcased her strong acting prowess but also earned her an Emmy nomination. On the big screen, Mara has demonstrated her versatility across a range of genres. Notably, she starred in the 2015 superhero film Fantastic Four and portrayed the real-life character of Ashley Smith in the drama Captive. Further showcasing her acting chops, Mara took on the role of a marine corporal in the film Megan Leavey, earning praise for her authentic portrayal of a soldier's life. In addition to her acting career, Mara is a passionate philanthropist, advocating for veganism and animal rights.\n\nChelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is an American author and global health advocate. She is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, including taking a prominent role at the foundation with a seat on its board. Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father's first term as governor. She attended public schools there until he was elected President and the family moved to the White House, where she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. She received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University and later earned master's degrees from University of Oxford (having studied at University College, Oxford) and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014. Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. They have a daughter and two sons. In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother's Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She assumed a similar role in her mother's 2016 presidential campaign, making over 200 public appearances as her surrogate and again introducing her at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Clinton has authored five children's books and co-authored a scholarly book for adults on global health policy, as well as articles and opinion pieces published in major media outlets. She has received numerous awards and honors. Clinton has worked for McKinsey & Company, Avenue Capital Group, and New York University and serves on several boards, including those of the School of American Ballet, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Common Sense Media, Weill Cornell Medical College and IAC/InterActiveCorp.\n\nJoshua Winslow Groban (born February 27, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. His first four solo albums have been certified multi-platinum, and he was charted in 2007 as the number-one best selling artist in the United States, with over 22.3 million records. As of 2012, he had sold over 25 million records worldwide.Groban originally studied acting, but moved to singing as his voice developed. Groban attended the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, a free public school on the campus of California State University, Los Angeles, where students receive a conservatory-style education.David Foster called Groban to stand in for an ailing Andrea Bocelli to rehearse a duet, \"The Prayer\", with Celine Dion at the rehearsal for the 1998 Grammy Awards. Rosie O'Donnell immediately invited him to appear on her talk show. Foster asked him to sing at the California Governor's Gray Davis' 1999 inauguration. He was cast on Ally McBeal by the show's creator, David E. Kelley, performing \"You're Still You\" for the 2001 season 4 finale."
