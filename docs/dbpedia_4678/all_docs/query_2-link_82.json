She was born in Ames, Iowa, to Charley and Marian Finch, growing up in California, Texas, and Iowa. She graduated Ames High School and married Wilbur Bennett. She attended DMACC, both Boone and Ankeny, Iowa, College of St. Francis, Joliet, Ill., and then Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa, earning a master’s degree in health science. Joan and Wilbur moved to Texas in 1990, returning to Boone, Iowa, yearly for their granddaughter, Mellissa’s, dance recitals. Joan moved to North Carolina in 2023. She thoroughly enjoyed being close to more family members.\n\nJoan excelled at clarinet and was a vocalist for many years as well as playing the piano and organ. Joan enjoyed traveling, especially to Russia, Mexico, and Ireland, visiting the town where her grandmother lived prior to coming to the United States. Joan also enjoyed bird watching, sewing, and scrapbooking.\n\nNursing was her calling in life, having worked at many nursing homes and hospitals, also as a school nurse, hospice nurse, and later teaching nursing classes. Joan was a member of Iowa Partners in the Americas in the Women’s Health Division. She was able to travel to the State of Yucatan in Mexico, where she performed needed medical services. After her retirement from nursing and teaching, at age 75, she became a certified Ombudsman in Texas.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Wilbur; a son, Ronald L. Bennett; and a son-in-law, Steve Middleton.\n\nSurvivors include her daughters, Marlis Warner of Texas, and Karen (Danny) Tatum, of Union Grove, N.C.; brother, Al (Kathy) Finch of Bandera, Texas, granddaughter, Mellissa (Bruce) Myers and great grandson Ashton Crowdy, all of Statesville, N.C., step grandsons, Jonathan Tatum of Statesville and David (Brittany) Tatum of Morganton, N.C., a brother-in-law, Bill Devitt of Minnesota; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at Brookdale Peachtree and Hospice and Palliative Care of Iredell County for their care of Joan.\n\nA graveside service will be held at the Coastal Bend State Veterans Cemetery in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Thursday, September 5, 2024, at 2 p.m., where she will be laid to rest next to Wilbur."
