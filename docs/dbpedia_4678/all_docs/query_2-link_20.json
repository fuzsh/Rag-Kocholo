        "text": "Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.\n\nShe died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.\n\nMiss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in \"Bulldog Drummond\" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in \"Disraeli\" (1929) and John Barrymore in \"Moby Dick\" (1930).\n\nShe portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in \"Me and My Gal\" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in \"Little Women\" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in \"Private Worlds\" (1935).\n\nThe leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made \"Algiers,\" a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called \"Trade Winds,\" and she began an entirely new career. A Change of Personality\n\nCombined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- \"The House Across the Bay\" and \"The Man I Married\" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in \"Man Hunt\" (1941), a mysterious model in \"The Woman in the Window\" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in \"Scarlet Street\" (1946).\n\nShe also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's \"Macomber Affair\" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's \"Woman on the Beach\" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's \"Reckless Moment\" (1949).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
