        "text": "Personable, extremely pretty and prolific star of a wide range of films in the 1930s and 40s. Bennett began her film career as a demure blonde ingenue (e.g. in George Cukor's \"Little Women\" 1933, William K. Howard's breathtaking \"The Trial of Vivienne Ware\" 1932). Raoul Walsh's delightful \"Me and My Gal\" (1932), though, did give her an offbeat chance to indulge in sharp wisecracking. Early on her acting abilities seemed a bit modest, but Bennett's warm speaking voice and quietly piquant charm gave her considerable appeal as a screen personality."
