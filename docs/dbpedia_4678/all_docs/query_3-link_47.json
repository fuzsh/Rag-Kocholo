She was born June 8, 1938, in Hall, WV, a daughter of the late Atha Thomas and Agnes Clara Smith Haddix. On July 3, 1959, she married James Clinton “Jim” Bennett who preceded her in death on August 23, 2012. She is survived by two daughters, Sis Bennett of Buckhannon and Gail Bennett of Fairmont, WV; three sons, Clint Bennett of Buckhannon, Rex Bennett of Audra, WV and Charlie Bennett of Buckhannon; four grandsons, Derrick Lyons (Brittany) of Ellamore, WV, Gerren Simms (Megan) of Martinsburg, WV, Travis Bennett (Janie) of Camden, WV and Justin “Parker” Bennett of SC; four granddaughters, Brittany Sprouse (Michael) and four children of Walkersville, WV, Tiffany and Brandy Bachman of Hodgesville, WV and Brenda Gail Bennett and fiancé Christian Hanna of SC; seven great-grandchildren, Austin Lamb, Silas Lamb, Haley Grace Bennett and Houston Bennett of Camden, Liam and Kinsley Lyons of Ellamore and Drake Simms of Martinsburg, WV; four brothers, Bob (Sylvia) Haddix of Audra, Gerald (Wilmajean) Haddix of Audra, Tom (Peg) Haddix of Volga, WV and Randy (Debbie) Haddix of Audra; two sisters, Jean Long of Rock Cave, WV and Dot McDaniel of Wallace, WV; two sister -in-laws, Taresa Haddix of Audra and Ginny Shoemaker of Elkins, WV; many nieces and nephews and special friends, Mike and Kelli Dean, Ron Postalwait and Darlene Gregory, Nena Gail Harrison, Bub Winters and Timmy Winans. In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by two brothers, Jim and Rick Haddix; one sister, Margaret “Peg” Payne and one great-granddaughter, Emily Marie Bennett. The family would like to give a special thanks to Nicole Radabaugh for her loving and compassionate care as not only her physician but her friend, the WV Hospice and WV Home Health. Joann was a homemaker and loved to do jigsaw puzzles, watch game shows and, when able, work in her flowers and gardening. She was a loving parent and the best “Granny” in the world. She took in and cared for many children over the years, opening her house, arms and love to them all. Friends will be received Tuesday, March 5, 2024, from 11 AM to 2 PM at the Poling-St. Clair Funeral Home. A funeral service will be held 2 PM Tuesday at the funeral home with Pastor Jerry Murrell officiating. Burial will follow in the Bennett Cemetery in Kesling Mill, WV.
