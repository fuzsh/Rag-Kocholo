        "text": "Jeffrey “Jeff” Lee Taylor of Saginaw, Michigan\n\nBeloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, nephew, uncle, cousin, and friend passed away peacefully at his home on Saturday, August 3, 2024, at the age of 66 years. Jeff was born on February 12, 1958, in Alma, Michigan, on his father’s birthday, to the late James Leroy and Edna M. (Morey) Taylor. He was a proud 1976 graduate of Swan Valley High School. He married the love of his life and high school sweetheart, Shelly Hepinstall, on August 26, 1978, celebrating almost 46 years of marriage. Jeff worked as a service technician for Kessler Equipment Company for over 25 years of loyal and dedicated service. He was a proud member of James Township Fire Department for 34 years, now both his son and grandson are honorably carrying on the tradition. Jeff was a simple man, easy going with an excellent sense of humor. He enjoyed spending time with his family, as well as taking part in all their life events. An avid outdoorsman, Jeff loved to hunt and was proud of the many trophies he mounted from trips in and out of the state. He also loved to tinker in his garage, tend to his garden, cut grass, and just sit in his back yard and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. Fondly known as “Papa” to his grandchildren, Jeff was also known as the man on the golf cart with his dog Chico by his side, riding around the neighborhood.\n\nSurviving are his wife, Shelly M. Taylor of Saginaw; two sons: Chad (Jessica) Taylor of Saginaw; Cody (Alyssa) Taylor of Macomb; six grandchildren: Hunter, MaKayla, Hayden, Clark, Bennett, and Elliotte; two siblings: Janis (Bob) Young; Kevin (Rachelle) Taylor; and many dear friends, Bob (Pam) Luth; Jim (Janice) Ward; Tim (Janice) Creed; Beth Carpenter. Also surviving are an aunt, and many nieces, nephews, and cousins too numerous to list, but held close to his heart.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, James and Edna Taylor; father- and mother-in-law, Bob and Joan Hepinstall; brother-in-law, Amos Hepinstall Jr.; a nephew, Erik Anderson; and his best buddy, Chico.\n\nThe family would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to his loving sister, Jan, for always being there, as well as to Covenant Hospitals Cooper and Harrison, Select Specialty Hospital, Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation, and Covenant VNA Hospice for all the love and care they provided to Jeff and to his family."
