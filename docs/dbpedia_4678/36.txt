Bennett came from a prominent acting family, with her father, Richard Bennett, and her sisters, Constance and Barbara, also being successful actors. She began her acting career in the 1920s, making her Broadway debut at the age of 18 in the play "Jarnegan." She quickly transitioned to film, signing a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in the early 1930s.

In the 1940s, Joan Bennett's career took a notable turn as she became associated with film noir. Her work in films such as "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and "Scarlet Street" (1945), both directed by Fritz Lang, showcased her ability to portray complex, seductive, and morally ambiguous characters. Her collaboration with Lang and her performances in these films solidified her reputation as one of the prominent femme fatales of the era.

Her performances often involved a mix of charm, manipulation, and vulnerability, which captivated audiences and added depth to her characters. She had a distinct screen presence, with her dark hair, expressive eyes, and husky voice becoming her trademark features.

Outside of film noir, Joan Bennett had success in various other film genres, including romantic comedies, dramas, and thrillers. Some of her notable films include "Father of the Bride" (1950), directed by Vincente Minnelli, and "Little Women" (1949), where she portrayed Amy March. She also appeared in a range of television roles later in her career, including the popular gothic soap opera "Dark Shadows" in the 1960s.

In addition to her acting career, Bennett was also involved in philanthropy and activism. She supported charitable causes, including the American Red Cross, and actively participated in community efforts.

Joan Bennett's career declined in the late 1950s, but her impact on film noir and her contributions to the overall landscape of cinema remain significant. Her work helped define the femme fatale archetype and showcased her versatility as an actress. Bennett passed away on December 7, 1990, in Scarsdale, New York, leaving behind a legacy as a talented and influential figure in the world of film and entertainment.

[about the attention she was getting as a cast member of the cult series Dark Shadows (1966)] "I feel positively like a Beatle."

[on femme fatales] "Let people hiss. They'll still be sore at the bad woman long after they've forgotten the nice girl who got the man. Few people remember good women. They don't forget bad girls."

[1970] "Now that I stop to think of it, there are only a scant half-dozen of my own total of seventy films that were acceptable to me and they include Little Women (1933), Private Worlds (1935), Trade Winds (1938), Man Hunt (1941), The Woman in the Window (1944), and Scarlet Street (1945)."
