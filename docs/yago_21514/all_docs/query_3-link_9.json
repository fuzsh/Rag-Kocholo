The Christmas Song - Ray Charles [4:28] 5. For Annette & Warren [2:58] ...see complete tracklist Soundtrack Q & A Q: I can't seem to find the song that Annette did sign language to with a group of small students. The lyrics and music seemed very familiar, like a new arrangement of an old Beatles song or something. They went something like this, \"You ask how much I love you, and you know I always will...\" or similar lyrics. It was very touching and really grabbed my attention. Someone let me know if it's on the soundtrack or not, or where I can find that song, arrangement,etc. Thank you. (from Ya in Fenton, MI, USA) A: \"I Will\" by Ben Taylor. (thanks to faye, phil) add more info A: You can find it on Limewire (thanks to Celtic Warrior, Mashpee, MA. USA) add more info A: It sounds like a Beatle song to you because you've heard Paul McCartney sing it. (thanks to JoJo, Oxford, NC USA) add more info Q: Who composed the song \"For Annette and Warren\"? (from giulietta in Philippines) A: Ennio Morricone (thanks to OSTfan, Burlingame) add more info Q: We hear a song with the frequent lyrics \"...love affair...\" during the end credits with female vocal - sounds a bit like K. D. Lang. What is it, who's singing, and why isn't it listed on the end credits?? Thanks. (from Ron in Peabody, MA, USA) A: You are right, that's KD Lang singing \"Love Affair\". (thanks to ziyan, Philippines) add more info Q: What is the title of the song (instrumental) at the end of the movie when they meet again at Annette Benning's apartment (while she was sitting at the couch)? (from dean in australia) A: It's probably the track called \"Finding Each Other Again\" off of the soundtrack CD. (thanks to OSTfan, Burlingame) add more info Q: What is the song performed by children during the end credits? It doesn't seem to be included in the soundrack. (from ss in Vancouver, Canada) A: \"I Will\" by Ben Taylor (thanks to epo, dominican republic) add more info Q: Is there any way one can download that track with the children singing \"I Will\"? I think it was a piece which had so much purity and honesty. It is a pity they did not include it in the soundtrack. (from bigjob4u in Seattle, USA) A: You can get it on Limewire. (thanks to ProfSlainte, Dubln. Ireland) add more info A: Ben Taylor's version is found on Limewire; but I can't find the kids' version. If anyone knows how to search for it, please share. Thanks! (thanks to achikins, Philippines) add more info Q: What is the name of the vocalist (operatic) who performs the song \"Love Affair\" when Beatty was in the old woman's home reminiscing after her death?\n\n...from mychelle in florida (answer mychelle's question) Q: Does anyone have the lyrics to the song from the end credits on the DVD? (from bug in Kentucky) A:\n\nskies without stars all the nights without you I watch the world from a room without a view for you left me with so few memories I could close my eyes and cling to just a fading photograph I'd sometimes sink to all those smiles unexplored all the words left unsaid we strung our dreams on and all to slender thread for you left me with so few memories I could close my eyes and cling to just a half-remembered tune I'd sometimes sing to now I found what we lost time was all, all it cost love's always there knowing someday I would share in a life-long love affair with you love was always there knowing someday I would share in a life-long love affair with you in a life-long love affair with you\n\n(thanks to ziyan, Philippines) add more info Q: Who is the female singer of the lyrics heard in the end credits of \"Love Affair\"?
