        "text": "Some stories are so timeless that Hollywood keeps making them over and over again. The latest example is the Warren Beatty-Annette Bening version of “Love Affair,” the third film based on the story.\n\nThough made 55 years after Leo McCarey’s original “Love Affair” (1939) and 37 years after McCarey remade it as “An Affair to Remember” (1957), the new “Love Affair” shares many things with its predecessors, including two wonderfully corny shots of reflections: one of the Empire State Building, another of a painting by the hero that now belongs to the heroine. The original (on video through Movies Unlimited, 1-800-523-0823), the follow-up (FoxVideo, $9.98) and the new version also hew to the same tear-triggering plot: A womanizer on the verge of marriage discovers love with an engaged woman on an ocean voyage--only to be separated when she is hit by a car en route to their post-cruise rendezvous. How do the three versions of the “Love Affair” story diverge? Let us count the ways.\n\n- Compiled by the Film Clips staff\n\n1939\n\nHe is:\n\nMichel Mornay (Charles Boyer), international playboy who is sailing from Europe to New York to marry Louise Clark, the rock-and-gravel heiress.\n\nShe is:\n\nTerry McKay (Irene Dunne), former nightclub singer.\n\nThey meet cute:\n\nWhen she catches an indiscreet radiogram a breeze has blow out of his hands and through a porthole.\n\nThings get serious when:\n\nThey stop to visit his grandmother (Maria Ouspenskaya) in the south of Spain.\n\nThe aging matriarch offers words of insight:\n\n“One day, life will present a bill and Michel will find it hard to pay.”\n\nWhen they get back to the boat:\n\nThey don’t kiss or sleep together.\n\nHis words of warning:\n\n“I’ve never worked a day in my life.”\n\nThey agree to meet:\n\nIn six months, on July 1 at 5 p.m.\n\nIn the interim:\n\nHe becomes a painter and she goes back to nightclub singing.\n\nHis best friend is:\n\nHis art dealer.\n\nThe two lovers finally run into each other again:\n\nAt a Broadway play.\n\n1957\n\nHe is:\n\nNick Ferranti (Carey Grant), international playboy who is sailing from Europe to New York to marry Lois Clark, the rock-and-gravel heiress.\n\nShe is:\n\nTerry McKay (Deborah Kerr), former nightclub singer.\n\nThey meet cute:\n\nWhen she finds an indiscreet cigarette case he has lost.\n\nThings get serious when:\n\nThey stop to visit his grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt) in the south of France.\n\nThe aging matriarch offers words of insight:\n\n“He is always attracted to the art he isn’t practicing, to the place he hasn’t been, to the girl he hasn’t met.”\n\nWhen they get back to the boat:\n\nThey kiss but don’t sleep together.\n\nHis words of warning:\n\n“I’ve never worked a day in my life.”\n\nThey agree to meet:\n\nIn six months, on July 1 at 5 p.m.\n\nIn the interim:\n\nHe becomes a painter and she goes back to nightclub singing.\n\nHis best friend is:\n\nHis art dealer.\n\nThe two lovers finally run into each other again:\n\nAt the ballet.\n\n1994\n\nHe is:\n\nMichael Gambril (Warren Beatty), former pro football star and ladies’ man who is engaged to talk show star Lynn Weaver\n\nShe is:\n\nTerry McKay (Annette Bening), part-time musician, decorator.\n\nThey meet cute:\n\nOn an airplane, where she persuades him they’ve met before.\n\nThings get serious when:\n\nThey stop to visit his Aunt Ginny (Katharine Hepburn) in the South Pacific.\n\nThe aging matriarch offers words of insight:\n\n“Michael is an ugly duckling who doesn’t know he’s a swan.”\n\nWhen they get back to the boat:\n\nThey kiss and apparently sleep together.\n\nHis words of warning:\n\n“I’ve never been faithful to anyone a day in my life.”\n\nThey agree to meet:\n\nIn three months, on July 8 at 5:02 p.m.\n\nIn the interim:\n\nHe becomes a small-college football coach and she finds work singing commercial jingles.\n\nHis best friend is:\n\nHis attorney.\n\nThe two lovers finally run into each other again:\n\nAt a Ray Charles benefit concert at Carnegie Hall."
