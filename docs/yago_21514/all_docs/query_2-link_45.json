        "text": "“The trick in life isn’t getting what you want, my dear, it’s wanting it after you get it. ” – Ginny\n\nNumber of Times Seen – 1 (6 May 2018)\n\nBrief Synopsis – A Sportscaster and a singer meet on a Trans-Pacific flight and after falling in love must decide what to do since they are both engaged to other people.\n\nMy Take on it – This is the third (fourth if Sleepless in Seattle (1993) counts) version of this storyline.\n\nI’m usually not the biggest fan of new versions of older films, or remakes as they have been come to be known, but they actually do a nice job in this one and it works much better than the previous incarnations of the story.\n\nOne of the things that helps make this film even better is the teaming of newlywed couple Warren Beatty and Annette Bening who have great chemistry in this film just as they supposedly have in real life.\n\nThis film makes it seem much easier to believe that a quick relationship between the characters is plausible.\n\nIn one of her final film roles, Katherine Hepburn is great in a supporting role as Beatty’s aunt with whom the couple visit.\n\nSe easily steals every scene that she appears in.\n\nThey do a great job modernizing this films storyline and it comes across as feeling more realistic and plausible than any of the previous versions of this heart warming story of love and loss.\n\nBottom Line – Remake that works much better than the previous incarnations of this story. Beatty and Bening have great chemistry together and it’s so much easier to believe the quick relationship between the characters than in the earlier films. Hepburn is perfect in a supporting role and steals every scene she is in. Really liked the way that they modernized this storyline in a fashion that makes it feel even more plausible than it seemed in the other versions. Recommended!\n\nMovieRob’s Favorite Trivia – Warren Beatty personally lobbied Katharine Hepburn to come out of retirement and appear in this film. Though he personally rented a house for her in Los Angeles and had her referred to a special dermatologist, she wouldn’t give a definitive answer until the day of filming. (From IMDB)\n\nRating – Globe Worthy (7/10)\n\n_______________________________________\n\nCheck out my *updated* movie stats here\n\nTo see my reviews of Oscar Winning Performances check out this link\n\nTo see my reviews of all Oscar Best Picture Winners click here (now complete)"
