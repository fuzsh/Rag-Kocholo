        "text": "Why does every movie involving a cruise ship need to be a tragedy? Sure, we loved Leo and Kate in Titanic, but – spoiler alert – things don't end so happily.\n\nLikewise with 1972's The Poseidon Adventure (and its 2006 remake), Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, The Last Voyage, Speed 2: Cruise Control and the dozen or more other retellings of Titanic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurely, as the long run of TV's The Love Boat attests, there are happier stories at sea to tell. (And great theme songs!) Here are five movies from Hollywood history that paint a brighter picture of cruising.\n\nCasual fans might think of this movie as a remake of An Affair to Remember. Technically, that's true, but only because that was a remake of 1939's Love Affair. Confused yet? Well, then just focus on the amazing chemistry between Warren Beatty and Annette Bening and the beautiful scenery of Tahiti and Moorea. Love Affair, sadly, was also the last film appearance for the great Katharine Hepburn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. and Horatio Sanz think they're taking a singles cruise, but a vengeful travel agent books them on a cruise for gay men. This might not have been a disaster movie on the screen, but it sure was at the box office, with the gay community and with critics. The famed critic Roger Ebert wrote of Boat Trip: \"It is dim-witted, unfunny, too shallow to be offensive ... This is a movie made for nobody, about nothing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay, so maybe stick with An Affair to Remember."
