        "text": "Proband 1 (P1) was born as the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents of Caucasian descent after an uneventful pregnancy (Figure 1A, Table 1). At delivery a singular umbilical artery was noted. The global development was delayed from infancy on: with sitting at 18 months, standing with support at 14 months, walking at 26 months, first words at 24 months. She had slurred speech. Standardized cognitive tests performed at 5 and 10 years revealed a moderate intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 55 at last assessment using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC). Behavioral problems included a lack of distance to men and a sexualized behavior. At last assessment at 16 years-of-age, the girl had generalized muscular hypotonia with normal reflexes, but fine motor problems with a broad-based gait but no ataxia. When climbing stairs, she showed clear instability. The results of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 and 4 years as well as that of further work-up (including metabolic tests, electroencephalogram [EEG], ophthalmological assessment, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and abdominal sonography) were normal. Since preliminary genetic tests including chromosome analysis and array-CGH were normal in the index patient (P1), we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the underlying genetic cause. WES followed by bioinformatic analysis and confirmation with Sanger sequencing revealed the heterozygous de novo variant in the CRMP1 gene c.1766C>T (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5830253G>A) in the affected child P1 (Figure 1B; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). At the protein level, this variant leads to an amino acid change at position 589 from proline to leucine: P589L in long isoform, CRMP1A (NP_001014809.1), and P475L in short form, CRMP1B (NP_001304.1) (Figure 1B). The identified variant was not found in 1000Genomes, dbSNP, or gnomAD. The CADD phred score (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) and REVEL score was 24.8. and 0.695, respectively. The variant localizes to a highly conserved position, as demonstrated by PhyloP (5.327), PhastCons (1) score, and multispecies sequence alignment (Figure 1C).\n\nTable 1\n\nProband 2 (P2) was born as the second child of non-consanguineous parents of Caucasian descent after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery (Figure 1A, Table 1). Routine echographia during pregnancy did not show of any concern. The boy was macrosomic at birth but had no congenital microcephaly. His motor development was delayed (unsupported walking at 24 months-of-age) due to congenital mild muscular hypotonia with normal deep tendon reflexes, but no coordination problems. He had bilateral pes planus. A speech delay and language impairment with first words spoken at 36 months were diagnosed. He was also diagnosed with an ASD and normal cognitive abilities (IQ 95). At last assessment at 10 years-of-age, an obesity associated with hyperphagia was of raising concern, and he had secondary enuresis nocturna. The body mass index (BMI) at last evaluation was 26.1. The results of a cranial MRI and EEG were normal. Routine metabolic screening showed no abnormal results. Similarly, through WES followed by bioinformatic analysis, we identified a heterozygous de novo variant c.1280C>T in the CRMP1 gene (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5841279G>A) in proband (P2) (Figure 1B). This variant leads to an exchange of threonine to methionine at position 427 in the long form, CRMP1A (p.T427M, NP_001014809.1) and at position 313 in the short form, CRMP1B (p.T313M, NP_001304.1) (Figure 1B). The variant affects a highly conserved region of the protein (Figure 1C). The CADD phred score and REVEL score were 27.7 and 0.819, respectively. PhyloP (5.093), PhastCons (1) score, and multispecies sequence alignment show that the variant is in a highly conserved region (Figure 1C).\n\nProband 3 (P3) is the first child of three of a non-consanguineous family of European descent (Figure 1A, Table 1). She was born at gestation week 40 after an uneventful pregnancy, with normal birth parameters (weight: 3.610 kg, height: 50 cm, head circumference: 32.5 cm, Apgar score: 10/10). She had developmental delay with not being able to sit alone at 11 months and walked without support at 24 months. Her speech development was delayed with few words spoken at 30 months. She began to gain weight from 18 months, and overgrowth was noticed since the age of 2 years. At the age of 6 years, cell blood count, ionogram, lipid profile, endocrinological screening, and leptin blood level were normal with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 3.16 mmol/l (2.60–4.00), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio: 3.9 mmol/l (<4.4), serum triglycerides: 0.47 mmol/l (0.42–1.40), HbA1C: 5.4% (4.0–6.0), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): 3.27 µUI/ml (0.15–3.70), FT4: 10.25 ng/l (6.10–11.20), Cortisolemia: 92 µg/l (7.87–14.45), and Leptinemia: 131 ng/ml (19–251). There is familial history of obesity on both parental sides, and the father is macrocephalic (head circumference: 60.5 cm). She developed severe behavioral issues with temper tantrums, stubbornness, hyperphagia, obsessive–compulsive characteristics and ASD. She was attending special educational school at the age of 8. At the last assessment of 13 years-of-age, she had moderate intellectual disability and persistent severe behavioral disorders. Distinctive facial features were low forehead hair insertion, anteverted and large earlobes, broad nasal tip, short philtrum, and full lower lips. Genu valgum and hyperlordosis as well as abdominal and dorsal stretch marks were noted. Enuresis was noted. Cerebral MRI and abdomino-renal ultrasound were normal. Metabolic disorder screening and storage disease screening were negative, serum insulinemia was elevated: 32 mUI/ml (<25) with normal glycemia (0.9 g/l). Array analysis revealed two maternally inherited deletions: a 668 kb deletion at 3q26.31 and a 371 kb at 5q23.1, confirmed by genome sequencing and considered as variant of unknown significance. Further analysis through trio-based whole-genome sequencing identified a de novo variant in the CRMP1 gene c.1052T>C (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5841409A>G) (Figure 1B) and the mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The identified variant leads to an exchange of phenylalanine to serine at position 351 of long form of CRMP1 (CRMP1A (p.(F351S), NP_001014809.1)) and at position 237 in short form (CRMP1B (p.(F237S), NP_001304.1)) and it is located in the highly conserved region of the protein (Figure 1C). This variant is not found in gnomAD database. In silico pathogenicity prediction tools predict the identified variants to be deleterious (CADD phred: 23.60; REVEL 0.577), and the variant is located in the highly conserved region (PhyloP (2.826), PhastCons (1)). No additional pathogenic variants have been identified by trio genome sequencing, including all known genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nSince CRMP1 is known to oligomerize to form homotetramers and heterotetramers along with other CRMPs to regulate cellular functions (Wang and Strittmatter, 1997), we determined the effect of the identified human variants on its protein structure using known structures and protein structure prediction tools. The structure of CRMP1 short form, CRMP1B, has been determined at 3.05 A resolution (Liu et al., 2015) lacking the N-terminal 14 residues and residues 491–572 in their C-terminal region. A CRMP1 monomer consists of three structural parts, N-terminal β-strands followed by a linker β-strand connected to the central α/β-barrel (Figure 1D). Several residues contribute to the oligomerization interface of CRMP1 and the quaternary structure of CRMP1 tetramer is shown in Figure 1E. The amino acids (P475, T313, and F237) are located in the highly conserved region of CRMP1. The P475 is the last residue before the start of the C-terminal helix and the exchange of proline to leucine (p.(P475L)) is predicted to lead to serious clashes with the neighboring residues (Figure 1F). Such spatial constraints may alter the dipole moment of the helix and lead to long-range allosteric effects (Figure 1G). The T313 lies within the region of the α/β-barrel and oriented toward the inside of the protein and located close to one of the two cavities (highlighted in yellow) (Figure 1H). These two cavities are located in between two pockets (highlighted in magenta). Conformational changes within these pockets upon function or interaction with other molecules could shuffle these cavities to form a channel required for function. The exchange of threonine to methionine (p.(T313M)) is predicted to prevent the conformational changes which might affect the interaction of CRMP1 with other molecules and/or oligomerization. The F237 is localized directly in the center of interface 1 so the exchange of a heavy hydrophobic sidechain by a hydrophilic short sidechain (p.(F237S)) most likely interferes with the stability of the dimer interaction (Figure 1I). Based on structural simulations, all three variants are predicted to affect the ternary structure of CRMP1 and impact on its oligomerization.\n\nTo analyze the effect of CRMP1 variants on its protein levels and cellular function, two variants (CRMP1B-P475L (P1) or -T313M (P2)) were chosen for further functional analysis. The alternate splicing of exons 1a and 1b of CRMP1 gene brings two splicing variants CRMP1A (686 aa, long form) and CRMP1B (572 aa short form) (Figure 1B). CRMP1B is the major isoform expressed in the nervous system and most of CRMP1 studies including X-ray structural analysis have been performed with CRMP1B and therefore we used CRMP1B isoform for the experiments.\n\nWe purified the recombinant human CRMP1B-wildtype, -P475L (P1), or -T313M (P2) proteins using the E. coli GST-tag expression system. CRMP1B-wildtype showed two major 64 and 60 kDa bands on SDS-denatured gel electrophoresis (Figure 2A, left lane). The 64 and 60 kDa correspond to full-length CRMP1B and to a truncated, C-terminal region cleaved form, respectively. The yield of purified T313M (TM) or P475L (PL) was less than that of wildtype in the same condition (Figure 2A, middle and right lanes). This finding may be due to lower expression and/or aggregation of the variant proteins in E. coli. As T313M and P475L mutated residues are positioned close to the dimer/tetramer interface of CRMP1B, these variants may affect homo-oligomerization of CRMP1. We therefore examined the oligomerization of recombinant CRMP1 preparation with gel-filtration chromatography (Figure 2B). Truncated CRMP1B-wildtype (lower band) was present in the high molecular weight region (200–500 kDa) and full-length CRMP1B (higher band) was present between 400 and 100 kDa. The high molecular weight signal probably represents the homo-oligomerization of CRMP1B-wildtype under the native condition. In contrast, CRMP1B-T313M and -P475L were detected at the lower molecular weight region (40–200 kDa). The molecular size (120 kDa) of peak fractions of T313M and P475L may indicate the dimerization of these variant proteins.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2—source data 1\n\nCRMP1 variants impact the homo-oligomerization.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/80793/elife-80793-fig2-data1-v3.zip\n\nFigure 2—source data 2\n\nRatio of signal intensity of myc-IP band and input ratio of V5 blot.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/80793/elife-80793-fig2-data2-v3.zip\n\nWe further examined the homophilic interaction of CRMP1B-wildtype and the variants. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged CRMP1B-wildtype together with either one of V5-tagged CRMP1B-wildtype, CRMP1B-T313M, or CRMP1B-P475L. The cells were subjected to anti-Myc-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figure 2C, while V5-tagged CRMP1B-wildtype was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged CRMP1B-wildtype, co-immunoprecipitation of V5-tagged CRMP1B-T313M or -P475L was reduced. Immunoprecipitated and input V5-signal ratios from CRMP1B-T313M and CRMP1B-P475L were significantly decreased compared to CRMP1B-wildtype (Figure 2D). These results suggest that the amino acid exchange in the CRMP1 variants may interfere with the homophilic interaction of CRMP1 and homo-oligomerization.\n\nIn family 1, DNA samples of family members were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on a HiSeq XTen Deep Sequencer (Illumina, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The QC values include: >Q20 sequences 95.4%, the average depth is 36×, the >20× coding exons coverage 96.5%. The primary data analysis was done by a combination of Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) sequence aligner for reads alignment to human reference genome GRCh37/hg19, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline for calling single-nucleotide variants (SNV), and small insertions and deletions (indel), and ANNOVAR for variant characterization (Li and Durbin, 2010; Wang et al., 2010; DePristo et al., 2011). Identified variants were filtered through comparison with the disease-associated variants in the known databases (Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, 2020.2) and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)) and polymorphism databases (dbSNP143, 1000 Genome). The population allele frequency cutoff: for de novo heterozygous mutations, we demanded that there should be no match in databases such as GnomAD or ExAc; for homozygous or compound heterozygous variants, we required that there should be no match of homozygote in databases such as GnomAD or ExAc, if there be heterozygous match in databases, the allele frequency should be lower than 1 × 10−5. Sanger sequencing of the CRMP1 gene (NM_001014809) was performed to confirm the identified variants in the patients and further family members (CRMP1-forward primer: TCTTCGAGGGTATGGAGTGC, CRMP1-reverse primer: CGTCAGATCTCGATTCCCCA) and performed segregation analysis of the variants with the phenotype.\n\nIn family 2, variants were detected by routine WES diagnostics and variant calling using a parent-offspring trio approach as described previously (de Ligt et al., 2012). Briefly, the exome was captured using the Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon v5 library prep kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Exome libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with 101 bp paired-end reads at a median coverage of 75× at the BGI Europe facilities (BGI, Copenhagen, Denmark). The datasets have been filtered with 5% population allele frequency. Sequence reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using BWA and variants were subsequently called by the GATK unified genotyper, version 3.2-2 and annotated using a custom built diagnostic annotation pipeline. Array analysis (CytoScan HD platform) detected no clinically significant copy number variation (CNV) and this was confirmed by follow-up routine WES-CNV analysis using the Conifer algorithm. Multispecies sequence alignment was performed using Multialin, PhyloP, and PhastCons and the variants disease-causative nature was predicted using the free online tool Mutation Taster (https://www.mutationtaster.org/).\n\nIn family 3, trio-based whole-genome sequencing was performed on blood-derived genomic DNA at the Laboratoire de biologie médicale multisites SeqOIA (LBMS SeqOIA, Paris, France). After extraction, DNA samples were sonicated, and libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra-II kit (New England Biolabs). Whole-genome sequencing was performed in paired-end 2 × 150 bp mode, with a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina): Proband % genome >15× 96.3%; DOC: 37×, Mother % genome >15× 96.3% DOC: 37.2×, Father% genome >15× 96.4% DOC: 38.4×. Demultiplexed data were aligned to the genomic reference (hg19). Recalibration and variant calling were performed using GATK4 (Broad Institute). Short variants were annotated with SNPeff (4.3t). Copy Number Variants >4 kb were called using CNVnator (v0.4.1) and annotated with AnnotSV (v2.5.1). An average depth-of-coverage of >50× was obtained for both probands, and variants were prioritized according to impact, frequency, and segregation. The allele frequency cutoff applied was maximum 0.05. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the identified variants in the CRMP1 gene (CRMP1-forward primer: ACAAAAGCGGATCCTGGAGA, CRMP1-reverse primer: GTACACAGGGCAGTTGATCC). Haploinsufficiency and dominant negative are likely to be applicable in the same gene, such as some of the genes encoding for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Meyer-Schuman and Antonellis, 2017)."
