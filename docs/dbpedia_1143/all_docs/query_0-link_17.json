        "text": "Collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP1) is one of the CRMP family members that mediates signal transduction of axon guidance molecules. Here, we show evidence that CRMP1 is involved in Reelin (Reln) signaling to regulate neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. In crmp1-/- mice, radial migration of cortical neurons was retarded. This phenotype was not observed in the sema3A-/- and crmp1+/-;sema3A+/- cortices. However, CRMP1 was colocalized with disabled-1 (Dab1), an adaptor protein in Reln signaling. In the Relnrl/rl cortex, CRMP1 and Dab1 were expressed at a higher level, yet tyrosine phosphorylated at a lower level. Loss of crmp1 in a dab1 heterozygous background led to the disruption of hippocampal lamination, a Reeler-like phenotype. In addition to axon guidance, CRMP1 regulates neuronal migration by mediating Reln signaling.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Collapsin response mediator protein 1 mediates reelin signaling in cortical neuronal migration\n\nAU - Yamashita, Naoya\n\nAU - Uchida, Yutaka\n\nAU - Ohshima, Toshio\n\nAU - Hirai, Syu Ichi\n\nAU - Nakamura, Fumio\n\nAU - Taniguchi, Masahiko\n\nAU - Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko\n\nAU - Honnorat, Jérôme\n\nAU - Kolattukudy, Pappachan\n\nAU - Thomasset, Nicole\n\nAU - Takei, Kohtaro\n\nAU - Takahashi, Takuya\n\nAU - Goshima, Yoshio\n\nPY - 2006/12/20\n\nY1 - 2006/12/20\n\nN2 - Collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP1) is one of the CRMP family members that mediates signal transduction of axon guidance molecules.
