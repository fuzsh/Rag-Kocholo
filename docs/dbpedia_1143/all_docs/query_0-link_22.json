        "meta_description": "We previously identified that ngr1 allele deletion limits the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by preserving axonal integrity. However, whether this favorable outcome observed in EAE is a consequence of an abrogated neuronal-specific pathophysiological mechanism, is yet to be defined. Here we show that, Cre-loxP-mediated neuron-specific deletion of ngr1 preserved axonal integrity, whereas its re-expression in ngr1−/− female mice potentiated EAE-axonopathy. As a corollary, myelin integrity was preserved under Cre deletion in ngr1flx/flx , retinal ganglion cell axons whereas, significant demyelination occurred in the ngr1−/− optic nerves following the re-introduction of NgR1. Moreover, Cre-loxP-mediated axon-specific deletion of ngr1 in ngr1flx/flx mice also demonstrated efficient anterograde transport of fluorescently-labeled ChTxβ in the optic nerves of EAE-induced mice. However, the anterograde transport of ChTxβ displayed accumulation in optic nerve degenerative axons of EAE-induced ngr1−/− mice, when NgR1 was reintroduced but was shown to be transported efficiently in the contralateral non- recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2-transduced optic nerves of these mutant mice. We further identified that the interaction between the axonal motor protein, Kinesin-1 and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) was unchanged upon Cre deletion of ngr1 . Whereas, this Kinesin-1/CRMP2 association was reduced when NgR1 was re-expressed in the ngr1−/− optic nerves. Our data suggest that NgR1 governs axonal degeneration in the context of inflammatory-mediated demyelination through the phosphorylation of CRMP2 by stalling axonal vesicular transport. Moreover, axon-specific deletion of ngr1 preserves axonal transport mechanisms, blunting the induction of inflammatory demyelination and limiting the severity of EAE.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly induced by aberrant immune-mediated destruction of the protective sheath of nerve fibers (known as myelin). However, it has been shown that MS lesions do not only consist of this disease pattern, exhibiting heterogeneity with continual destruction of axons. Here we investigate how neuronal NgR1 can drive inflammatory-mediated axonal degeneration and demyelination within the optic nerve by analyzing its downstream signaling events that govern axonal vesicular transport. We identify that abrogating the NgR1/pCRMP2 signaling cascade can maintain Kinesin-1-dependent anterograde axonal transport to limit inflammatory-mediated axonopathy and demyelination. The ability to differentiate between primary and secondary mechanisms of axonal degeneration may uncover therapeutic strategies to limit axonal damage and progressive MS.",

        "text": "Results\n\nRGC-specific deletion or overexpression of NgR1 regulates axonal degeneration during EAE\n\nWe previously reported that NgR1-dependent phosphorylation of CRMP2 may potentiate axonal degeneration during neuroinflammation (Petratos et al., 2012). Here, we investigated how selective deletion of NgR1 in neurons, may prevent this signal transduction pathway from executing axonal degeneration during EAE. As a corollary, we also posited the question: how would the re-expression of full-length NgR1 in ngr1−/− CNS neurons modify axonal integrity during EAE?\n\nFor axon-specific manipulation of the NgR1, we used an intraocular delivery system of the rAAV2 as previously described (Petratos et al., 2012). Recombinant AAV2-eGFP, rAAV2-eGFP expressing the improved Cre (rAAV2-eGFP-iCre), and rAAV2-eGFP expressing mouse full-length NgR1 were generated (Fig. 1A–C). One week before EAE induction, direct intraocular injections into the vitreous cavity of right mouse eyes were performed using these vectors, to transduce RGCs and their axons. Retinal whole mount immunofluorescence revealed ∼40% of βIII-tubulin-labeled RGCs to be consistently transduced by all three rAAV2 vectors (Fig. 1G). qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA collected from the retinae revealed a ∼twofold downregulation of ngr1 upon rAAV2-eGFP-iCre transduction in ngr1flx/flx mice, and a ∼twofold upregulation upon rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 ngr1−/− mice compared with the uninjected left eye (Fig. 1H). Therefore, we verified that this rAAV2-mediated gene delivery system efficiently transduces RGCs to modulate the expression of NgR1.\n\nFigure 1-1\n\nAxon-specific overexpression of NgR1 in optic nerves of naïve ngr1-/- mice did not lead into axonal degeneration (A) Immunolabeling of rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 injected optic nerve sections of naïve ngr1-/- mice for NF-200, GFP, NgR1, and DAPI counterstaining. (B) Immunolabeling of serial section for βAPP, GFP, and DAPI counterstaining. (C) The percentage of degenerative GFP+ axons over total number of GFP+ transduced axons (n = 4, mean ± SEM). Download Figure 1-1, TIF file\n\nWe first analyzed rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1-injected optic nerves of naive (non-EAE) ngr1−/− mice to investigate possible axonal changes, which may occur without inflammation (basal changes as a consequence of NgR1 re-expression). We verified the expression of axonal NgR1. However, we could not detect axonal abnormalities, morphologically or by demonstrating βAPP accumulation in the transduced optic nerves (eGFP+/NgR1+; Fig. 1-1). This indicates that re-introduction of NgR1 to RGC axons, does not cause damage, without inflammatory infiltrates being present.\n\nIn line with our previous data generated for ngr1−/− mice (Petratos et al., 2012), we demonstrated a significant delay in the onset of EAE and reduction in the peak clinical score compared with ngr1+/+ or ngr1flx/flx mice (Fig. 1I–K). Furthermore, by Day 18 post-EAE induction, only 54% of ngr1−/− mice exhibited any form of clinical symptoms, whereas 84% of ngr1+/+ and 89% of ngr1flx/flx mice displayed EAE onset and progression (Fig. 1I). Immunofluorescence studies performed on transduced optic nerves at Days 18–21 post-EAE induction (corresponding to peak stage of EAE) revealed a significant reduction in morphologically identifiable degenerative axons of ngr1flx/flx mice transduced with rAAV2-eGFP-iCre (mean ± SEM: 8.220 ± 0.4239%) compared with the optic nerves transduced with rAAV2-eGFP transduction (controls; mean ± SEM: 21.53 ± 0.7954%). Furthermore, a significant increase in morphologically identifiable degenerative axons in the optic nerves of ngr1−/− mice transduced with rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 (mean ± SEM: 19.25 ± 1.298%) was identified compared with rAAV2-eGFP transduction in the same genotype (controls; mean ± SEM: 7.734 ± 0.3381%; Fig. 1L–N).\n\nTo further demonstrate axonal degeneration, we immunostained serial sections of rAAV2-transduced optic nerves localizing SMI-32, βAPP, and hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8). Consistent with the observed morphological changes of axonal degeneration observed within the eGFP+ transduced optic nerve axons following intraocular injection with rAAV2-eGFP-iCre, we identified significant reductions in the colocalization of SMI-32, βAPP, and AT8 (compared with the rAAV2-eGFP-injected optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice; Fig. 1O–T). Conversely, we demonstrated significant increases in the colocalization of all axonal dystrophy markers with GFP+ expression in the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1-injected optic nerves compared with rAAV2-eGFP-injected control optic nerves from ngr1−/− mice (Fig. 1O–T). These results suggest that axonal NgR1 drives axonopathy during neuroinflammation.\n\nInhibiting axon-specific NgR1-dependent signaling preserves axonal transport in the optic nerves during EAE\n\nTo assess the importance of neuronal NgR1-dependent signaling during neuroinflammation in the optic nerves of EAE-induced mice, we used the vesicular axonal transport qualities of ChTxβ subunit conjugated to the AlexaFluor 555 (ChTxβ-555) label. We identified stalling of ChTxβ-555-labeled vesicles as accumulation of immunofluorescence within dystrophic axons in the proximal ends of optic nerves that were either transduced with rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 in ngr1−/− mice (right optic nerves) following EAE induction, or in the nontransduced optic nerves (left optic nerves) of EAE-induced ngr1+/+ or ngr1flx/flx mice (Fig. 2B,C). The intensity of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence was minimal in the proximal ends of rAAV2-eGFP-iCre transduced optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice (Fig. 2C). This reduction was also observed within the rAAV2-Flag-CRMP2T555A-eGFP transduced optic nerves (phospho-mutant CRMP2 construct, Rho-associated kinase II phosphorylation site) of ngr1+/+ mice (Fig. 2B).\n\nFigure 2-1\n\nThe net velocity of axonal transport with and without stimulation of Nogo66 after transection injury.

Download Figure 2-1, TIF file\n\nThese observations were further validated when we measured the ChTxβ-555 fluorescence intensity along the distance of the optic nerve, from the proximal optic disc to the chiasm. We identified that rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced axons of ngr1−/− mice following EAE induction, displayed increased accumulation of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence intensity in the proximal segment of the right optic nerve compared with the contralateral nontransduced left optic nerve (Fig. 2B–D). We calculated the amount of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence accumulation in the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced axons of ngr1−/− mice following EAE induction, to be 126 ± 10 axons/mm2 of right optic nerve tissue, a threefold increase in the level of accumulation compared with rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP transduced optic nerves of ngr1+/+ mice (43 ± 8 axons/mm2); or twofold increase compared with rAAV2-eGFP-iCre transduced optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice (57 ± 8 axons/mm2; Fig. 2E). The overall percentage of dystrophic axons in the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced optic nerves of ngr1−/− mice, was 28.6 ± 3.7% of all transduced (eGFP+) axons (Fig. 2F,G).\n\nWe further interrogated the ChTxβ-555 fluorescence accumulation in the transduced or non-transduced optic nerve at the proximal, intermediate and distal segments, to assess the level of vesicular transport stalling in the axons of EAE-induced mice at the peak stage of disease (Fig. 2H,I). We demonstrated that in the proximal and intermediate segments of the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced right optic nerves of EAE induced ngr1−/− mice, the intensity of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence was 50.3 ± 6.6 and 53.3 ± 7.3 (A.U.) in these segments, respectively (Fig. 2H). This compared with 34.6 ± 2.8 and 13.3 ± 2.5 (A.U.) in the proximal and intermediate segments, respectively, as exhibited in the rAAV2-eGFP-iCre transduced optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice (Fig. 2H). Similarly, comparison levels of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence within the proximal and intermediate segments of rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP transduced optic nerves of ngr1+/+ mice were 28.3 ± 2.1 or 24.2 ± 4.3 (A.U.), respectively (Fig. 2H).\n\nConversely, the accumulation of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence in the uninjected (nontransduced) optic nerves of EAE-induced ngr1+/+ and ngr1flx/flx mice at the peak stage of disease, illustrated the existence of abrogated transport at the proximal and intermediate segments of the optic nerve, resembling the NgR1-overexpression studies performed in the ngr1−/− rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced optic nerve (Fig. 2I). Because there was a greater intensity of ChTxβ-555 fluorescence detected at the distal ends in the uninjected (nontransduced) optic nerves of EAE-induced ngr1−/− mice, without accumulation in the proximal and intermediate segments, we showed that the transport of ChTxβ was unimpeded in these mice. These data suggest that stalling of anterograde vesicular transport exists in the proximal through to intermediate segments of optic nerves when NgR1 is expressed in neurons during neuroinflammation. However, does this transport deficit occur because of Nogo-A (a potent myelin inhibitory factor) ligation through NgR1?\n\nTo answer this question, we isolated cortical neurons from wild-type and ngr1−/− mice allowing them to grow in microfluidic chambers. The axons of these neurons where allowed to grow freely into the grooves of the chambers, isolating the cortical neuron somas from their distal axonal terminals that had grown into the neighboring chamber (Fig. 2-1; also time-lapse videos are available from Movies 1, 2, 3, 4). After transecting the distal axonal terminals by aspirating the axonal chamber, we added 0.3 μg of Nogo-66 peptide, thereby stimulating NgR1 present on the axolemmal growth cone (if expressed). In the ngr1+/+ cortical neuronal cultures, we identified that Nogo-66 stimulation slows and stalls anterograde axonal transport of ChTxβ+ vesicles (∼0.0019 ± 0.0015 SEM μm/s) compared with transected but unstimulated ngr1+/+ axons (∼0.038 ± 0.015 SEM μm/s; Fig. 2-1). In fact, these anterograde vesicular transport velocity measurements were significantly different to those obtained from the ngr1−/− axons that showed (∼0.232 ± 0.028 SEM μm/s without Nogo-66 and ∼0.045 ± 0.018 SEM μm/s with Nogo-66 stimulation, respectively; Fig. 2-1). These data identify the stalling of anterograde axonal transport following stimulation with Nogo-66, a mechanism that we then set out to interrogate.\n\nAxon-specific deletion of ngr1 prevents dissociation of Kinesin-1 from CRMP2 during EAE\n\nThe vesicular cargo protein CRMP2, has been previously shown to associate with the Kinesin-1 motor protein to transport tubulin heterodimers in an anterograde manner (Kimura et al., 2005). Because NgR1-dependent phospho-CRMP2-Thr555 levels are increased within dystrophic axons during EAE (Petratos et al., 2012) and moreover, this specific phosphorylation can dissociate it from tubulin (Petratos et al., 2008, 2012), we further investigated whether this signaling can modulate the interaction of CRMP2 and Kinesin-1 [the main anterograde motor protein that transports α and β tubulin heterodimers to the “plus” ends of axonal microtubules (Yoshimura et al., 2005)], thereby impairing axonal transport during EAE and by extension MS.\n\nInitially, we stimulated ngr1+/+ and ngr1−/− cortical neurons that were transiently transfected with the pDendra2 construct encoding a flag-tagged mouse APP, with Nogo-66 to demonstrate the association of APP with Kinesin-1 and CRMP2. Upon Nogo-66 stimulation of ngr1+/+ cultures following a scratch injury, we showed accumulation of pDendra2+ APP to the proximal end of the axon (Fig. 3B, arrowheads; also time-lapse videos are available from Movies 5, 6) compared with the more punctate and distributed vesicles exhibited without Nogo-66 stimulation or the profile observed in the ngr1−/− cortical axons (Fig. 3C; also time-lapse videos are available from Movies 7, 8). Moreover, we collected the protein lysates from the un-stimulated and stimulated cultures from this experiment and identified the association of APP with KIF5c through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 3E). We identified increased association of APP with Kinesin-1 in ngr1−/− compared with the ngr1+/+ cortical neuron cultures (Fig. 3E). We next investigated how CRMP2 in ngr1+/+ and ngr1−/− cortical neuron cultures can regulate the association of Kinesin-1 in the presence or absence of neurite inhibitory factor, Nogo-66. By immunoprecipitation of CRMP2 from lysates of these stimulated neurons, we were able to identify that Nogo-66 inhibited the association with CRMP2 with a ∼sixfold reduction in the level of KIF5c observed in the stimulated ngr1+/+ and ngr1−/− cortical neuron cultures (Fig. 3F,G). This association was partially recovered following the blockade of Nogo-66 by pre-incubating this ligand with the soluble NgR(310)-Fc (∼3-fold increase from Nogo-66 stimulation alone; Fig. 3F,G).\n\nWe then collected protein lysates from inflamed lumbosacral spinal cords of ngr1+/+ and ngr1−/− mice at the peak stage of EAE and performed immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal anti-CRMP2 antibody. Western blotting using an anti-KIF5c (Kinesin family member 5c) antibody showed a significant reduction in the level of association with CRMP2 in spinal cord lysates from EAE-induced (peak stage) ngr1+/+ mice compared with naive ngr1+/+ controls (Fig. 3I–K). Whereas, we did not observe changes in the levels of these proteins following coimmunoprecipitation, within the spinal cords of EAE-induced (peak stage) ngr1−/− mice compared with naive ngr1−/− controls (Fig. 3I–K). We also demonstrated that the level of phospho-CRMP2-Thr555 was increased in the spinal cords of ngr1+/+ mice at the peak stage of EAE. Whereas, no modulation of pCRMP2-T555 levels was seen for spinal cord lysates obtained from ngr1−/− mice, at the peak stage of EAE (Fig. 3I,L,M). Therefore, the dissociation of KIF5c from CRMP2 in the spinal cords of ngr1+/+ mice during EAE, may be a result of NgR1-dependent signaling.\n\nBecause NgR1-dependent signaling may abrogate the interaction between CRMP2 and KIF5c, we then asked whether time-dependent and axon-specific deletion of NgR1 preserves this interaction. We collected protein lysates from rAAV2-transduced right optic nerves and their left optic nerves from uninjected eyes during EAE. We then performed immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. As expected, the left uninjected optic nerves of ngr1+/+ and ngr1flx/flx mice during EAE, showed a reduction in the levels of CRMP2 bound KIF5c compared with the optic nerves of naive ngr1+/+ mice (Fig. 4A,B). However, no difference in this interaction could be found in the left uninjected optic nerves of ngr1−/− mice during EAE (Fig. 4A,B). Importantly, both rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP-injected optic nerves of ngr1+/+ and rAAV2-eGFP-iCre-injected optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice showed a significant increase in the level of CRMP2-bound KIF5c compared with the left optic nerves lacking rAAV2-transduction, at the peak stage of EAE (Fig. 4A,B). Whereas, we found a reduction in the levels of CRMP2-bound KIF5c within rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1-injected optic nerves of ngr1−/− mice compared with the left nontransduced nerves at the peak stage of EAE, although these did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4A,B).\n\nThe dissociation of KIF5c from CRMP2 during EAE in the optic nerves of ngr1+/+ mice may be a result of direct axonal NgR1-signaling as the levels of pCRMP2-T555 were found to be reduced both in the rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP-injected optic nerves of ngr1+/+ and rAAV2-eGFP-iCre-injected optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice (Fig. 4A,C). Although not statistically significant, an increase in the level of phospho-CRMP2-Thr555 was observed in the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1-injected optic nerves of ngr1−/− mice compared with left nontransduced nerves, at the peak stage of EAE (Fig. 4A,C). These results suggest that axonal NgR1-signaling during EAE impairs Kinesin-1 association with CRMP2, a result of phosphorylation, and may govern the anterograde axonal transport blockade observed during axonal degeneration, although this hypothesis awaits further validation.\n\nAxon-specific deletion of ngr1 preserves myelin integrity in the optic nerves during EAE\n\nGiven that axonal degeneration during EAE is potentiated by neuronal NgR1 expression, we sought to determine whether the preservation of axons by conditionally deleting neuronal NgR1 could protect the myelin sheath from degeneration, following inflammatory infiltration. FluoroMyelin immunostained sections of optic nerves from all rAAV2-injected EAE-induced mice demonstrated reductions in demyelination surrounding rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP transduced axons in ngr1+/+ mice (∼1.5-fold) and restoration in FluoroMyelin intensity compared with optic nerves of ngr1+/+ mice transduced with rAAV2-eGFP during the peak stage of EAE (Fig. 5A,B). Optic nerve myelin integrity was also preserved in EAE-induced ngr1flx/flx mice following axonal transduction with rAAV2-eGFP-iCre compared with the optic nerves of rAAV2-eGFP injected EAE-induced mice at peak stage of disease (∼1.6-fold restoration in FluoroMyelin intensity; Fig. 5A,B). On the other hand, extensive demyelination was demonstrated surrounding rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced axons in ngr1−/− mice following EAE induction compared with rAAV2-eGFP transduced optic nerves following EAE at peak stage of disease (∼1.3-fold reduction in FluoroMyelin intensity). We observed an overall reduction of 1.8-fold FluoroMyelin intensity of optic nerves compared with naive ngr1−/− mice (Fig. 5A,B). Further observation of enhanced axo-myelin integrity was achieved at the ultrastructure level whereby immunogold-labeled rAAV2 particles carrying the iCre construct (Fig. 5-1, arrowheads) or the CRMP2T555A mutant construct (Fig. 5-1, arrowheads), localized in optic nerve axons, show lamellated intact myelin sheaths (Fig. 5-1). However, nontransduced axons within the same optic nerve segments demonstrated Wallerian degeneration with macrophage phagocytic activity (Fig. 5-1, arrows and asterisks). These results indicate that preserving axons during neuroinflammation via conditional deletion of ngr1 or, antagonizing NgR1-dependent signaling downstream to CRMP2, can also preserve myelin integrity.\n\nFigure 5-1\n\nIntact axonal structure with compact myelin in rAAV2-transduced axons Immunogold-labeled electron microscopic analysis of axons in (A) rAAV2-eGFP-iCre, (B) rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-GFP transduced right optic nerves, and (C) non-transduced control nerve.

We identified significant numbers of apoptotic oligodendrocytes in the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced optic nerves within EAE-induced ngr1−/− mice at peak stage of disease compared with rAAV2-eGFP-iCre transduced and rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP-injected optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx and ngr1+/+ mice, respectively (Fig. 6A,B; see Fig. 6-1) for the number of CC-1+ mature oligodendrocytes in optic nerves of naïve ngr1+/+ and ngr1−/− mice). In particular, we identified that the numbers of cleaved caspase-3-immunopositive, mature oligodendrocytes (CC-1+) were ∼2.5-fold greater in the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced axons of ngr1−/− mice (149.5 ± 7.31 per mm2) compared with the contralateral uninjected left optic nerves from the same mice (31.0 ± 5.6 per mm2; Fig. 6B,D). However, the numbers of cleaved caspase-3-immunopositive, mature oligodendrocytes (CC-1+) in rAAV2-eGFP-iCre transduced optic nerves of ngr1flx/flx mice (99.05 ± 7.67 per mm2), were reduced by ∼1.5-fold compared with the rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1 transduced axons in ngr1−/− mice during the peak stage of EAE (Fig. 6B). A similar reduction (∼1.5-fold) was calculated for the rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP transduced axons in ngr1+/+ mice, at the peak stage of EAE (79.07 ± 10.09 per mm2; Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that NgR1-dependent axonal expression drives oligodendrocyte dystrophy during inflammation of the optic nerve.\n\nFigure 6-1\n\nNumber of CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes in optic nerves of naïve ngr1+/+ and ngr1-/- mice.

These findings have set an important precedent for investigation of the molecular mechanisms underscoring CNS axon damage during neuroinflammation. We have previously shown that in the MOG35–55 model of EAE, elevated levels of pCRMP2-T555 occur in the optic nerves of mice that express NgR1 during the peak stage of disease and are associated with significant axonopathy (Petratos et al., 2012). In this study, the optic nerves of EAE-induced mice that were transduced with rAAV2-CRMP2T555A-eGFP inhibited profound axonopathy, demyelination, and oligodendrocyte dystrophy. This suggests that by abrogating CRMP2 phosphorylation, we cannot only limit axonal damage but also preserve myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte viability. However, the direct importance of NgR1-dependent CRMP2 phosphorylation localized in MS lesions and how this relates to disruption of the axonal transport machinery is an important question that needs to be addressed. We therefore first investigated the localization of pCRMP2-T555 expressed within deep cortical white-matter lesions of postmortem frontal lobe frozen tissue samples from secondary progressive MS (Fig. 7A,B).\n\nIn line with our previous study (Petratos et al., 2012), pCRMP2-T555 was shown to be elevated in dystrophic axons localized largely in chronic demyelinated lesions of brain tissue from individuals with secondary progressive MS (Table 3; Fig. 7D–G). In fact, colocalization of pCRMP2-T555 with the axonal degenerative markers βAPP (Fig. 7D, arrowhead), and non-phosphorylated neurofilament, SMI-32 (Fig. 7E, arrowhead), were observed. Moreover, axolemmal NgR1 immunostaining demonstrated colabeling of axonal spheroids with intra-axonal pCRMP2-T555 (Fig. 7F, arrowhead). In areas of apparent demyelination (represented by diffuse and discontinuous MBP-immunopositive myelin sheath staining), pCRMP2-T555 immunofluorescence was of greatest intensity within the PPWM lesions (n = 33 axons measured, across 4 separate tissue samples) compared with NAWM (n = 47 axons measured, across 4 separate tissue samples; Fig. 7G,H). These results suggest that pCRMP2-T555 is involved in axonal degeneration in MS and contiguous with myelin disruption.\n\nElevated NgR1 occurs with disassociated CRMP2-bound Kinesin and tubulin in brain lysates from individuals with MS\n\nWe finally correlated the levels of NgR1 expressed within postmortem tissue from individuals with MS and other neurological disorders, to the association of CRMP2/tubulin and Kinesin-1 motor protein complexes, in an attempt to identify the possible molecular events governing NgR1-dependent axonal dysfunction linked with anterograde transport. We found that only the lysates from individuals with secondary progressive MS, demonstrated elevated levels of NgR1 (Fig. 8A,B). We identified that there were ∼90, 85, 80, and 70% reductions in the percentage levels of Kinesin-bound to CRMP2 in AD, MS, HD, and FTD samples, respectively, compared with brain lysates from non-neurological control tissue (Table 3; Fig. 8C,D). We further identified that ∼80, 50, 60, and 40% reductions of tubulin-bound CRMP2 occurred in AD, MS, FTD, and HD brain lysates, respectively, compared with the non-neurological controls (Fig. 8C,E). These data suggest that tubulin and Kinesin dissociation from CRMP2 could be central to neurodegeneration although a dominant molecular mechanism governing neuroinflammatory axonopathy may be related to the expression of NgR1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the current study, we have defined that axon-specific NgR1 can drive inflammatory-dependent degeneration in the CNS by stalling the Kinesin-dependent anterograde transport mechanism, a direct consequence of the downstream phosphorylation of CRMP2. By using the highly efficient rAAV2 transduction system to either conditionally delete or overexpress neuronal NgR1, we identified that transduced RGCs were either salvaged from or driven toward degeneration, respectively. Importantly, we identified that by ablating NgR1 expression during inflammatory challenge in the optic nerve, not only could we preserve axonal integrity but simultaneously preserve myelin. Reintroduction of NgR1 in the ngr1−/− mice illustrated its central role in driving axonal damage and demyelination as a consequence of neuroinflammation. Moreover, the overexpression of a phospho-mutant T555A CRMP2 construct was able to structurally protect axonal and myelin integrity along with providing sustained axonal transport under neuroinflammatory conditions within the ngr1+/+ mouse optic nerve. Our data suggest that NgR1-dependent axonal damage and demyelination is potentiated under inflammatory condition, and this degeneration may be dependent upon the downstream molecular association of KIF5c with CRMP2. This molecular motor dissociation may lead to slowing or stalling anterograde vesicular axonal trafficking, leading to synaptic dysfunction.\n\nA functional measure of CRMP2 phosphorylation is the degree to which it associates with tubulin heterodimers (Arimura et al., 2005; Kimura et al., 2005). Previous reports have implicated this mechanism during developmentally regulated axonal growth, albeit through the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at the glycogen synthase kinase-3β Thr514 site (Yoshimura et al., 2005, 2006). However, phosphomimetic mutants display a weakened ability to drive axon growth during development and following acute spinal cord injury (Nagai et al., 2016). The importance of Rho kinase-mediated Thr555 phosphorylation of CRMP2 in potentiating acute axonal damage, was demonstrated through MAIF-dependent signaling, in an acute spinal cord injury model (Mimura et al., 2006). Indeed, blocking this signaling pathway can facilitate microtubule re-association with CRMP2, directly benefiting axon growth in this injury paradigm (Mimura et al., 2006). However, there remains a knowledge gap in the molecular drivers of axonal degeneration during inflammatory demyelination. In particular, the mechanism governing frank axonal dystrophy readily observed in NAWM within the CNS of individuals with MS, is yet to be elucidated (for review, see Lassmann, 2010).\n\nThe physiological importance of Kinesin/CRMP2 association is that it can be a marker for the fidelity of anterograde axonal transport and axon growth (Kimura et al., 2005), possibly through the Kinesin molecular motor protein associating with key developmental and functionally dynamic molecular cargo such as, βAPP, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE), SRA1/WAVE1 (specifically Rac1-associated protein-1/WASP family verprolin-homologous protein-1) complex/WAVE1 (Kamal et al., 2001; Kawano et al., 2005; Takata et al., 2009; Hensley et al., 2011). Stalling of Kinesin motor proteins during fast axonal transport has been shown to accumulate βAPP within swollen axons (Stokin et al., 2005). Indeed, Kinesin blockade and dystrophic axons have been reported in the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (for review, see Maday et al., 2014). Therefore, maintaining this anterograde transport is integral to the fidelity of axons and it is known that both are severely compromised during EAE and by extension, MS (Sorbara et al., 2014; Hares et al., 2017). We identified that the anterograde transport of βAPP by Kinesin-1 can be maintained if NgR1-dependent activation is abrogated.\n\nThe phosphorylation of CRMP2 can limit Kinesin anterograde motor proteins from binding and carrying vital molecular cargo for axonal growth and maintenance (Arimura et al., 2005). Our studies have identified the biochemical dissociation of Kinesin-1 from CRMP2 in chronic-active lesions of autopsy tissue obtained from secondary progressive MS patients and this was directly related to the intense βAPP localization in dystrophic axons. Therefore, the question was posed that if NgR1 signaling regulates the phosphorylation of CRMP2 during MS and EAE (Petratos et al., 2012) can this cause the stalling of Kinesin motor proteins within these axons potentiating their degeneration? Moreover, are these molecular events antecedent to myelin degeneration?\n\nWe initially asked whether the overexpression of full-length NgR1 in the RGCs from ngr1−/− mice promotes axonal damage during EAE, as a model of inside-out axonopathy. Overexpression was performed by transduction of RGCs with a rAAV2-eGFP-mNgR1, we were then able to demonstrate how NgR1 expression (within the ngr1−/− optic nerve) may promote degeneration of axons during inflammatory demyelination (assessed at peak stage of EAE) compared with those unlabeled (nontransduced axons–contralateral optic nerve) within the ngr1−/− mice, or following intraocular injection with rAAV2-eGFP in the control experiment. Our data implicate NgR1 as a driver of axonal damage in the context of CNS inflammatory challenge. Because the overexpression of NgR1 in naive ngr1−/− optic nerves did not exhibit axonal damage and there was a disconnect between the preservation of axons in the ngr1flx/flx optic nerve following Cre-mediated deletion, with axonal damage exhibited in the uninjected contralateral nerve of the same mice. This suggests that inflammatory-mediated axonal damage can be driven through NgR1 signaling.\n\nIt is then plausible that either: (1) the limitation of myelin debris enriched with Nogo-A, initiating signaling through the NgR1-dependent phosphorylation of CRMP2 (inflammatory-mediated demyelination and secondary axonal damage; outside-in axonopathy), preserves axons or; (2) limiting the phosphorylation of CRMP2 within the axon prevents myelin from degenerating (inside-out axonal damage; secondary demyelination) and abrogates the cycle of inflammatory cell infiltration within the CNS. These outside-in versus inside-out mechanisms of axonopathy still require investigation, particularly because Nogo-A is also highly expressed in axons and may play an active role in driving degeneration during neuroinflammation (Ineichen et al., 2017; Zemmar et al., 2018). Although neuronal Nogo-A-dependent signaling downstream to CRMP2 has not been well defined but has been identified in the regulation of axonal transport (Joset et al., 2010).\n\nIt was previously demonstrated that axonal transport deficits precede structural/morphological alterations of myelin during EAE (Sorbara et al., 2014). If indeed it holds true that the axon deficit can propagate the demyelinating pathology because of the blockade of vesicular transport, then it would seem that the physiological status of CRMP2 is fundamental for the preservation of an integrated CNS. Indeed recent protein interactome data have identified a further 78 protein partners for CRMP2 in the brain, vital for healthy neuronal function and plasticity (Martins-de-Souza et al., 2015). Importantly, the direct relevance of CRMP2 post-translational modifications in neurodegenerative pathologies have been highlighted through the targeting of proteins that may interact with CRMP2 (for review, see Taghian et al., 2012) or small molecules such as lanthionine ketimine-5-ethyl ester (LKE), that can facilitate the binding of CRMP2 to other proteins (Dupree et al., 2015). Importantly, the later small molecule has recently been trialed in EAE experiments whereby the investigators demonstrated significant protection of axonal caliber and myelin sheaths (Dupree et al., 2015), highlighting the translational potential for this cell-permeable analog of lanthionine ketamine. Whether LKE can in fact potentiate the association of CRMP2 with Kinesin and re-establish fast axonal transport remains to be elucidated.\n\nIt is now evident that the morphological hallmarks of axonal injury can precede histologically detectable demyelination (Onuki et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2005), and correlate strongly with the progression of EAE in mice (Ayers et al., 2004; Nikić et al., 2011). NAWM histologically resembles appropriately myelinated axonal fibers situated at least 1 cm from the edges of MS plaques (Filippi et al., 2012). However, NAWM from the CNS of MS patients demonstrates diffuse pathology, which includes inflammatory infiltrates, microglial activation and demyelination but of note is the loss of axons with ∼12–42% reduction in axonal density within the spinal cord and corpus callosum (Evangelou et al., 2000; Bjartmar et al., 2001; Moll et al., 2011). Despite its histopathological classification, the mechanism governing axonal degeneration in NAWM remains elusive. Recently, an elegant study identified that transport deficits actually precede structural alterations of axons and their myelin (Sorbara et al., 2014). These investigators argue that under the breach of CNS inflammation, axonal transport is disrupted before demyelination or damage to organelles and that this can be reversed through therapeutically administering redox scavenging agents (Nitric oxide scavenger, 2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide [cPTIO]) and anti-inflammatory methylprednisolone. The data highlight that inflammation is fundamentally linked to axonal transport deficits that can lead to progressive neurodegeneration. Our work suggests that NgR1 expression in axons under inflammatory conditions can propagate transport deficits in secondary progressive MS and support the recent identification synaptic dysfunction in experimental glaucoma models (Fu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015).\n\nThe hypothesis for induction of axonal degeneration manifest in MS, may suggest that the inflammatory attack of axons (outside-in) or primary neuronal and/or oligodendrocyte (inside-out) degeneration can both ultimately result in a similar neurological outcome, despite the possibility of differing pathogenesis. Here we show that the Nogo-A/NgR1/pCRMP2-T555 signal cascade drives axonal transport deficits that can lead to the degeneration of axons before robust demyelination and disease severity in EAE. Importantly, this mechanism may be operative during secondary progressive MS. Directly targeting axon-specific signaling may be a plausible therapeutic approach to limit neurological decline in MS patients."
