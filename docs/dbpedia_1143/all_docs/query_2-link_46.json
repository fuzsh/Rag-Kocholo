        "text": "3.1. Detection of the lattice-translocation disorder\n\nThe diffraction patterns of all CRMP-4 crystals of form B showed diffuse reflections independent of the cryoprotection used. The spots at higher resolution were particularly smeared. However, some spots at lower resolution appeared to be sharp Bragg reflections, indicating that these diffuse features cannot be solely attributed to thermal disorder. Pseudo-precession diffraction images, simulated from the experimental data, showed a pattern of alternating layers of sharp Bragg spots and streaky reflections (Fig. 1a). As a rule, sharp spots were observed for l = 5n and streaky diffraction spots for layers in between. The spots for l = 5n + 2 (and l = 5n + 3) were particularly streaky. However, for some data sets the sharpness of the Bragg spots at l = 5n diminished at higher resolution. This observation is in agreement with the plot of the mean intensity in the l layer versus l (Fig. 1b), where intensities for l = 5 are particularly strong and those for l = 5n+ 2 (and l = 5n + 3) are weak. Furthermore, all data sets for these crystals showed anisotropic diffraction, which in some cases was very severe. The diffraction was stronger in the l direction and weaker in the k and particularly the h directions, which again is at least partially related to the observed spot characteristics. Analysis of the native Patterson function for all data sets collected for crystal form B revealed two strong non-origin peaks. The peak heights for these were between 60 and 71% and between 24 and 33%, respectively (Table 2 ). The fractional coordinates of the higher peak are approximately (0.5, 0.5, 0.4) and those for the second, lower peak are approximately (0, 0, 0.2) (Table 2 ). Cell-content analysis confidently predicted two molecules in the asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 2.48 Å3 Da−1 and a solvent content of 50.4%. This indicated that one of the peaks might be attributed to tNCS. The second peak corresponds to a shift of approximately 24 Å along z (Fig. 2 ). Since CRMPs are 50–70 Å in diameter, this shift would lead to a physically impossible overlap. Hence, this peak must originate from some other interference term caused by translationally related scatterers. In addition, the tNCS alone could not explain the pathological height of the strongest non-origin peaks. Based on the same size-of-molecule reasoning, and as opposed to the case of nearly exact pseudo-centring with a Patterson peak at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), only different pairs of molecules can contribute to the equivalent peaks at (0.5, 0.5, 0.4) and (0.5, 0.5, 0.6). Therefore, the heights of the latter peaks cannot exceed half of the height of the origin peak and amount to 0.6. In principle, Patterson peaks would have been observed at the same positions if the crystal was twinned by reticular merohedry with twin index 5. However, this possibility was ruled out as there were no unaccounted spots during integration of images. The possibility of a different space group was also excluded since data scaled in lower symmetry showed the same features.\n\nData set 1 2 3 4 5 Resolution (Å) 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 First non-origin peak height (%) 71.0 59.9 65.6 62.4 64.7 First peak position (0.5, 0.5, w) 0.399 0.407 0.401 0.402 0.408 Second peak height (%) 33.4 24.4 27.5 32.1 29.0 Second peak position (0.0, 0.0, w) 0.201 0.186 0.197 0.195 0.184\n\nMore than five data sets were collected from CRMP-4 crystals of form B and all showed the same diffraction pathology and non-origin peaks in the Patterson maps. However, structure solution by molecular replacement was possible using these pathological data and solutions for two monomers in the asymmetric unit related by tNCS were found. The search model included only the core residues of CRMP, excluding residues from the C-terminal domain. The resulting electron-density map showed extensive unmodelled protein-like features (Fig. 3a), which may be attributed to the missing residues in the search model. Automated model building with Buccaneer (Cowtan, 2006 ) was successful in building approximately 200 residues into this density. However, closer inspection of the newly built chain showed that it had essentially the same structure as the adjacent half of the closest monomer. This monomer and the partial model were related by a fractional translation of 0.2 along z, which is in accordance with the Patterson peak at (0, 0, 0.2) (Fig. 2 ). Several residues of the initially omitted C-terminal domain were visible and could also be built (Fig. 4a), but its further extension was hampered by the apparent density from the non-existent molecule. Such ghost density strongly suggests the presence of the interference term in the observed intensities arising from lattice-translocation disorder.\n\nCombining the experimental information from the sharp/streaky diffraction pattern, unexplained native Patterson peaks and the ghost density from shifted molecules strongly indicates that the data exhibit severe lattice-translocation disorder. The presence of a Patterson peak at (0, 0, 0.2) implies that the equivalent molecules at the opposite sides of a translocation defect are shifted relative to each other by about one fifth of the c cell dimension and explains the sharp Bragg spots at l = 5n. To obtain a cleaner electron-density map, which could potentially reveal residues from the as yet unresolved C-terminal domain, correction of the intensities by demodulation was undertaken.\n\n3.2. Correction of intensities using lattice-translocation theory\n\nThe packing of crystal form B is shown in Fig. 2 and, in addition, a possible alternative position of a row of tetramers is indicated. Geometrically identical interfaces for the two packing modes might suggest their nearly equal probabilities. A difference between the two probabilities arises from small conformational changes defined by the positions of tetramers in the second coordination sphere. The mean size of the ordered domains decreases with the decrease of this difference. In turn, when the domain size decreases and becomes comparable with the coherence radius of X-rays, the interference contribution to the scattered intensity from adjacent domains is no longer negligible. This results in streaky reflections and modulation of intensities, as in the case of the CRMP-4 form B crystals in this study.\n\nIn principle, it should be possible to provide an idealized stochastic model of the X-ray diffraction by such a partially disordered crystal. However, it is difficult to design a model that would carefully account for all experimental parameters, including data-collection and data-processing geometries (e.g. the orientation and dimensions of the integration box). Therefore, it is common practice to use standard data processing followed by correction of the data using a simplified model of the partial disorder. For example, Wang, Kamtekar et al. (2005 ) used a two-lattice treatment of the data affected by translocation defects. In this model, two adjacent domains are expanded to restore the global translational symmetry. Such a synthetic crystal contains two copies of the same structure related by the translocation vector td and with different occupancies, also denoted as the lattice-defect fractions κ and (1 − κ). In this model, the total intensity Itotal of a given Bragg reflection h can be calculated from the intensity scattered by a single crystal, Iunit, as follows:\n\nIn (1 ) two parameters remain unknown: the translocation vector td and the fraction κ. The vector td can be determined with reasonable accuracy from the non-origin Patterson peaks. The fraction κ can be determined by a least-squares fit of (1 ) to the observed data. Under special conditions it can also be determined from the peak-height ratio (Wang, Kamtekar et al., 2005 ). In other approaches, κ may be determined by trial and error from the subsequent structure-determination process or systematically until the Patterson map is free of significant non-origin peaks (Hare et al., 2009 ; Zhu et al., 2008 ). Once the parameters are known (1 ) can be used to correct the observed intensities.\n\nUsing the least-squares fitting method, we determined κ to be 0.205 for data set 1. The translocation vector td was obtained from the Patterson peak position (Table 2 ). A model illustrating the corresponding translocation disorder is given in Fig. 2 . The resulting electron density (Fig. 3b) and refinement statistics (Table 3 ) were substantially improved. Using the method in which κ is obtained via reduction of the non-origin Patterson peak, the fraction κ was determined to be 0.20 (variation of κ in steps of 0.01). As expected, the two methods gave similar results, and correction of the intensities using the second method similarly improved both the quality of the electron-density maps (Fig. 3c) and the refinement statistics (Table 3 ). Naturally, this is also reflected in the layer-averaged intensity distributions, which are void of the modulation after correction (Fig. 1b).\n\n3.3. Further correction of intensities using the modelled crystal structure\n\nThe procedure described in the previous section removed modulations with a period of approximately 5 along l (Fig. 1b). However, substantial differences remained between the observed demodulated intensities averaged over h and k and the similar curve calculated from the atomic model. Therefore, we undertook an attempt to improve the demodulation procedure, and in particular to use the intensities from the refined model as a reference for fitting modulation parameters.\n\nFig. 5 presents a scheme of the putative structure of a defect area of the partially disordered crystal. The translocation defect with the translocation vector td is responsible for the lack of global translation in the direction a + b. Symmetry considerations suggest that an identical scheme can be drawn for the section defined by vectors c and a − b, implying a two-dimensional disorder. Lack of global translation in the directions a + b and a − b is supported by the presence of halos around the Bragg reflections in the views along c* (Supplementary Fig. 11). These halos are seen as diffuse streaks in the views orthogonal to c* (Fig. 1a). In addition, such two-dimensional disorder is in agreement with the parameters of anisotropic diffraction, because the drop of the mean intensity with resolution is faster along a* and b* than along c*.\n\nFor simplicity, we consider a partially disordered structure in which the global crystallographic translation is only missing in the direction a + b. Generalization to the actual two-dimensional disorder is straightforward but it would not change the results of this section. Three structures are considered to describe the modulation of the intensities and the demodulation procedure. The first structure (further referred to as structure L) is a structure of a single layer represented by one column of tetramers in Fig. 5 . We assume that this structure has an exact two-dimensional translation symmetry with base vectors c and a − b. The second (C) is a refined P21212 model structure which corresponds to an ordered domain of the disordered structure. The third (O) is a partially disordered structure containing the defects shown in Fig. 5 . This structure corresponds to a real partially disordered crystal. The structures C and O are considered to be composed from identical layers L; in this approximation, any small conformational differences between molecules with different contact patterns are disregarded. Different X-ray scattering patterns correspond to the structures L, C and O (lines, spots and streaky spots, respectively), but we are interested only in intensities at the points where crystal structure C has its Bragg spots. We denote the three sets of intensities at the Bragg positions as IL, IC and IO, respectively.\n\nAs follows from the schematic in Fig. 5 , the translocation vector td is collinear with c,\n\nHere τ ≃ 0.2, and the vectors v1 and v2 are expressed in terms of td and the base crystallographic translations as follows:\n\nTwo arbitrary layers L and L′ are related by a linear combination of v1 and v2 with integer coefficients j1 and j2,\n\nFrom (2–4) it follows that\n\nHence,\n\nwhere\n\nAccordingly, IO is expressed in terms of IL as follows,\n\nwhere x, IL and IO depend on hkl, while the coefficients qn are proportional to the probability of finding |j2 − j1| = n for two randomly selected layers. The separation between these layers has to be less than the coherence radius of the X-rays.\n\nIn the ordered P21212 domains (Fig. 5 ), as well as in the structure C, the vectors v1 and v2 alternate. Therefore, |j2 − j1| equals 0 or 1 with equal frequency and\n\nCoefficients between IO and IC are nonlinear functions of cos(x),\n\nand cannot be made linear in a general case. This is a likely reason for the large discrepancy between the demodulated intensities and intensities from the P21212 model if the demodulation procedure is performed according to (1 ). In addition, (8 ) describes the diffraction from the whole multi-domain crystal, as opposed to, for example, the two-domain (two-lattice) approximation used in (1 ).\n\nThe equations in this section relate the intensities at Bragg points, and any combinatorial estimate for coefficients q would work reasonably well only if the integration box for spot integration is small. In practice, the size of the box will affect the relative values of q as well as the overall anisotropic B factor. The coherence radius of an X-ray source is another factor that must be accounted for in any combinatorial estimate of these coefficients. Of course in practice accurate theoretical values of q are not needed, as they can simply be considered as unknown parameters (together with τ) in a nonlinear statistical model defined by (10 ). It is also possible to use the structure L as a reference and (8 ) for fitting of IO and IC (L is a substructure of C and is available as soon as C is available), thus avoiding small values that may occur in the denominator of (10 ). However, any fitting, linear or nonlinear, where the response variables are the intensities requires accurate weighting of residuals, otherwise the fitted values will mainly be defined by a few strong intensities. This problem is well known in crystallographic refinement and, for example, an accurate weighting of residuals is critical for least-squares minimization against intensities implemented in SHELXL (Sheldrick, 2008 ).\n\nTherefore, we used an even more simplified algorithm, DIGS. Here, the observations were grouped by two factors, the value of l and the parity of p = h + k. As follows from (7 ) and (10 ), the coefficients relating FO to FC (as well as the coefficient relating IO to IC) should be the same for all reflections from the same group. These can be used as unknown parameters in linear fitting, provided that each group contains a significant number of observations. There were 80 (i.e. 2lmax) such groups in data set 1, with an average of 319 reflections per group and only eight groups with less than 100 reflections. The estimates of these 80 parameters were used for demodulation. The entire refinement protocol using DIGS included the following two alternating steps.\n\nThe procedure was repeated each time the model was corrected. Convergence was reached at n between 2 and 5, dependent on the stage of model rebuilding. Eventually, an R and Rfree of 25.5 and 29.5%, respectively, between the final model and the final demodulated data were obtained. The iterative demodulation, refinement and model correction resulted in clearer electron density, which in turn allowed further model building and increased the correlation between the model and the experimental data (Table 3 and Fig. 4 ).\n\nWith this approach, any nonlinear fitting and any fitting involving intensities as predictor or response variables was avoided. We can envisage, however, that a more thorough approach, in which modulation equations are incorporated into the likelihood and weighting coefficient machinery of, for example, REFMAC5, would produce even better results and would not require simplifications as used in the discussed procedure.\n\n3.4. CRMP-4 structures from different crystal forms\n\n3.4.1. Quality of the structural models\n\nTwo different version of CRMP-4, full-length (1–570) and ΔC (13–490), were heterologously produced in good yield in E. coli. TEV protease removed the N-terminal histidine tag of the CRMP-4 ΔC efficiently. To speed up the purification and thus avoid exposure to proteases, the N-terminal tag was deliberately not cleaved off for CRMP-4 since it comprises the flexible C-terminal region which appears to be proteolytically susceptible. However, full-length CRMP-4 could be separated efficiently from the proteolytically cleaved version by size-exclusion chromatography and this was used for crystallization (Supplementary Fig. S2). CRMP-4 was crystallized in two different crystal forms, form A belonging to space group P21 and form B belonging to space group P21212. CRMP-4 ΔC crystallized in space group P21. All structures were determined by molecular replacement. Firstly, CRMP-4 ΔC was solved using a modified model of CRMP-5 ΔC as a search model. The refined model of CRMP-4 ΔC was then used for molecular replacement of the full-length versions.\n\nThe crystal of CRMP-4 ΔC contains a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Almost all of the residues are resolved in the electron density. Residue 490 is missing in all chains and residue 489 is missing in chains A and D. In chains C and D the serine from the N-terminal TEV cleavage site is also visible. The model was refined to an R factor of 19.1% and a free R factor of 22.6% (Table 1 ) and has excellent quality as indicated by MolProbity (100th percentile; Chen et al., 2010 ). One residue, Gly357, is found just outside the Ramachandran plot, as has been observed for other CRMPs (Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ). CRMP-4 (form A) was solved from a twinned crystal. The data scaled in the orthorhombic space group C222; however, the model could not be refined. Careful analysis of intensity statistics showed that the crystal belonged to space group P21 and was twinned. The twin fraction was refined to 31%. With structure factor-based twin refinement, the final R and Rfree converged to 18.7 and 23.6%, respectively (Table 1 ). The model consists of a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Residues 12–496 (or 497 in chain B) are resolved in the electron density. The electron density for the 6–8 C-terminal residues is weak (from residue 490 in chains A and C and residue 489 in chains B and D) but is sufficiently well defined to build a good model. The model of CRMP-4 from crystal form A has very good quality as indicated by MolProbity (Table 1 ).\n\nCRMP-4 from crystal form B was initially solved with uncorrected data. However, owing to the lattice-translocation disorder the refinement was performed against DIGS-corrected data as described above. The model consists of a dimer with the two monomers in the asymmetric unit related by tNCS. The crystallographic twofold symmetry relates two dimers which form the biologically relevant tetramer (Fig. 2 ). Both monomers in the model consist of residues 12–499. CRMP-4 from crystal form B has good quality as calculated by MolProbity (Table 1 ).\n\nCrystals of CRMP-4 contain primarily the full-length protein as shown by SDS–PAGE of dissolved crystals (Supplementary Fig. S3). Cell-content analysis for crystal form A (values in parentheses are for form B) gives a Matthews coefficient of 2.18 (2.48) Å3 Da−1 and a solvent content of 43.6% (50.4%) assuming that the full-length protein was crystallized, whereas values of 2.58 (2.94) Å3 Da−1 and 52.4% (58.1%) are calculated assuming that the crystal contains CRMP-4 ΔC. Crystal packing in both crystal forms show that the truncated C-terminus points towards the solvent region, where sufficient space is available for the disordered residues (Fig. 2 ). Hence, it seems very likely that although full-length protein is present in the crystal the C-terminal tail is dis­ordered and cannot be resolved in the electron density.\n\n3.4.2. Overall structure of CRMP-4\n\nBased on sequence similarity of the core region (residues 64–413), CRMP-4 and other members of the CRMP family are assigned as metal-dependent hydrolases in the Amidohydro_1 subfamily within the amidohydrolase superfamily (Pfam family PF01979; Punta et al., 2012 ). The amidohydrolase domain of CRMP-4 displays a typical triosephosphate isomerase-like barrel fold. It is capped by a smaller β-sandwich domain composed of residues from both the N-terminus and the C-terminus (13–63 and 414–455; Fig. 6a). This domain has no significant structural similarities outside the amidohydrolase family and no functional homologue in the Sema3A signalling pathway (Deo et al., 2004 ). The structure of CRMP-4 closely resembles the enzyme DHPase, which also belongs to the amidohydrolase superfamily. However, to date no DHPase activity has been observed for any of the CRMP family members (Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ; Wang & Strittmatter, 1997 ). As observed previously in CRMP-5, the majority of the C-terminal residues of CRMP-4 (497/500–570) were not visible in the crystal structure. Only 11 more residues, up to residue 499, were revealed with the CRMP-4 structure, which form an extended loop protruding from one protomer towards the other (Figs. 2 and 6 ). The extended loop is anchored by a conserved salt bridge between the guanidinium group of Arg496 and the carboxyl group of Glu221 residing in α-helix 6 (Fig. 4 ). Similar C-terminus anchoring salt bridges were observed in full-length CRMP-5 and bacterial DHPase from Sino­rhizobium meliloti (Martínez-Rodríguez et al., 2010 ; Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ). The location and conformation of the three most distal C-terminal residues, Gly497, Met498 and Tyr499, were resolved for the first time in CRMP-4, but only in crystal form B. These residues extend the C-terminal loop further in the same direction and pack well against the hydrophobic Trp295 of the neighbouring monomer.\n\nThe asymmetric units of CRMP-4 form A and CRMP-4 ΔC each contain four monomers forming a homotetramer with internal 222 symmetry. CRMP-4 form B contains two monomers forming a tetramer by crystallo­graphic twofold symmetry. All individual monomers are very similar to one another, with r.m.s. deviations between monomers from different crystal forms of around 0.1–0.4 Å (based on equivalent Cα positions). Similar homotetramers were observed for other CRMPs and for the enzyme DHPase. The homotetramer is formed by using two different dimer interfaces: monomers A and B (or C and D) form the `arm–lever' interface and monomers A and D (or B and C) create the second `arm–arm' interface (Fig. 6a; Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ). The arm–lever interface buries an average of 993 Å2 of accessible surface area per monomer and includes 4–5 hydrogen bonds and 2–3 salt bridges. The arm–arm interface buries slightly more surface area (1090 Å2 per monomer) and includes as many as 14–16 hydrogen bonds and four salt bridges. However, the smaller number of noncovalent bonds is compensated in the arm–lever interface by burying more hydrophobic residues (solvation free energy of −11.1 kcal mol−1 compared with −2.3 kcal mol−1 for the arm–arm interface) as calculated using PISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007 ). The arm–lever interface is further strengthened in CRMP-4 by 11 additional noncovalent interactions and a buried solvent-accessible area of 2124 Å2 per monomer. This increase in interface interactions is mainly owing to the anchoring of the extended loop by Arg496 and the three additional C-terminal hydrophobic residues. Disruption of the salt bridge by mutation of the equivalent Arg in a bacterial DHPase did not have any effect on tetramer assembly (Martínez-Rodríguez et al., 2010 ). However, this salt bridge may have a crucial role in positioning the flexible C-terminus present in CRMPs. The latter is predicted to be intrinsically unstructured and devoid of any defined secondary-structure elements in all CRMPs and is important in regulation and binding of several interaction partners (Yamashita & Goshima, 2012 ).\n\nWhilst conducting this research, a crystal structure of human CRMP-4 was deposited by the Structural Genomics Consortium (PDB entry 4bkn ) with no accompanying publication. The protein was produced in insect cells, in contrast to our study which used a bacterial expression system. As observed here and previously for other CRMPs, only residues 13–488 and 493–496 could be resolved and the C-terminal domain remains elusive. The space group for PDB entry 4bkn is C2, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit forming a dimer via the arm–arm interface. A tetramer is assembled by crystallographic symmetry. This arrangement and symmetry is different to the structures presented here. Nevertheless, the molecular structures are very similar to each other, with an r.m.s.d. of 0.23–0.30 Å between monomers and of 0.35–0.50 Å between tetramers.\n\n3.4.3. Homo- and hetero-oligomerization\n\nMembers of the CRMP family prefer to form heterotetramers rather than homotetramers (Fukada et al., 2000 ; Wang & Strittmatter, 1997 ). The molecular basis of the regulation and function of such hetero-oligomers remains elusive. CRMP-4 and CRMP-4 ΔC, similar to other CRMPs, form a homotetramer in the crystals using the arm–lever and arm–arm interfaces (see above). Using gel-filtration analysis, we identified CRMP-4 to exist as a tetramer in solution and CRMP-4 ΔC to exist as lower oligomers, possibly as monomers and dimers in equilibrium. The difference may be owing to concentration-dependent oligomerization as observed for CRMP-1, CRMP-2 and CRMP-5 (Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ). The homo-tetramer of CRMP-4 is similar to the tetramers of CRMP-1, CRMP-2 and CRMP-5, with r.m.s. deviations of 0.6–1.5 Å (based on equivalent Cα atoms). Analysis and comparison of the homotetramer interfaces using PISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007 ) revealed that CRMP-1 is distinct from all other CRMPs. Both the arm–lever and arm–arm interfaces of CRMP-1 are different in regard to the number of buried hydrophobic residues and noncovalent bonds. The arm–arm interface is strongest in CRMP-2 and CRMP-5 followed by CRMP-4. In CRMP-1 this interface buries a small hydrophobic surface and despite having a comparable number of noncovalent interactions the interface is weak. Concomitantly the arm–lever interface in CRMP-1 is strong, including more hydrophobic and other noncovalent interactions. CRMP-2 and CRMP-5 have the weakest arm–lever interface, but incidentally a stronger arm–arm interface. In general, it appears that CRMP-2 and CRMP-5 prefer the arm–arm homo-interface and CRMP-1 prefers the arm–lever homo-interface. For CRMP-4 this is less clear as both interfaces appear similar. The overall high sequence conservation and similar tertiary structure between members of the CRMP family may allow them to form hetero-oligomers without the need for major conformational changes. However, with no structural details of hetero-oligomers available to date, it is difficult to precisely identify the residues that may contribute to the preferential formation of such hetero-oligomers, but it is worthwhile pointing out a few putatively significant residues based on the available homotetramer structures. Some of the residues determining such hetero-oligomer preferences have been described previously. For example, CRMP-1 is able to form hetero-oligomers with all other CRMPs except for CRMP-5 (Fukada et al., 2000 ; Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ; Wang & Strittmatter, 1997 ). Residues Asn237 and Lys265 make two hydrogen bonds with Glu223 in the arm–lever interface in CRMP-5. These residues are replaced by Gly and Pro, respectively, in CRMP-1 but not in other CRMPs, thus hampering the hydrogen bonding. Similarly, Lys473 in CRMP-5 makes three hydrogen bonds with residues Glu370, Asn371 and Thr23 in the arm–arm interface, and is replaced by Glu only in CRMP-1. Together with other small changes, the sequence alterations at these two crucial spots will weaken CRMP-1–CRMP-5 heterotetramer formation (Deo et al., 2004 ; Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ).\n\nCRMP-4 was shown to form hetero-oligomers with all members of the family, making the identification of crucial preference-determining residues more challenging. In the arm–arm interface, there are two conserved positively charged residues at the end of α-helix 8, which are likely to be more involved in hetero-oligomerization rather than homo-oligomerization (Fig. 7a). The first residue is Lys/Arg268, which is able to form a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl O atom of Ser323 present at the end of α-helix 11′ in CRMP-3 and CRMP-4 and an additional hydrogen bond to the side chain of the corresponding asparagine found in CRMP-5 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The second residue is Lys/Arg269, which is able to make up to three hydrogen bonds to Asp/Glu262 from α-helix 8′ and is absent only in CRMP-5. Another potential hydrogen-bonding partner Ser265 from α-helix 8′ is present in CRMP-4 but is replaced by Ala in other CRMPs. Found in its vicinity are further residues able to form interface hydrogen bonds, such as Tyr316 in CRMP-4 and His316 in CRMP-3. This residue, belonging to α-helix 11′, is substituted by Phe in CRMP-2, which thus loses a favourable interaction. Moreover, residue Tyr477 (otherwise Phe, His or Thr) from α-helix 16 in CRMP-4 slightly increases the hydrophilic nature of the arm–arm interface and provides potential hydrogen bonding with Arg372 from α-helix 14′ of CRMP-5. Additionally, Lys480 from α-helix 16, which is conserved in all CRMPs except for CRMP-1, where it is replaced by a less favourable Gln, makes several interactions with acidic residues present in the loop between α-helices 13′ and 14′ as described previously (Deo et al., 2004 ). The number of residues differing between CRMP-4 and other CRMPs is smaller in the arm–lever interface than in the arm–arm interface. Asn178 present in α-helix 4 of CRMP-4 would make more favourable interactions with Asn201 and Asp/Glu203 (α-helix 5′ and the vicinity thereof) than the equivalent Asp in other CRMPs (Fig. 7b). Residue 245 in α-helix 7 is either a Gln (CRMP-2, CRMP-3 and CRMP-4) or an Arg (CRMP-1 and CRMP-5). Whereas Gln can donate and accept hydrogen bonds, Arg is usually only able to donate them to the conserved residues Glu208, Arg211 and Glu230 from α-helices 5′ and 7′. In CRMP-5 only, residues 208 and 211 are substituted by Gly and Glu, respectively, thus losing some favourable interactions.\n\nThese few changes seen at the interface of CRMP-4 give an indication of, but cannot clearly define, the preference for hetero-oligomer over homo-oligomer formation. The preference of a specific hetero-oligomer, for example CRMP-1–CRMP-2 over CRMP-1–CRMP-4, may not be solely based on the sequence conservation and structure, but most likely would be influenced by and be synergistic with the varying temporal and spatial expression patterns of CRMPs (Gu et al., 2000 ; Veyrac et al., 2005 ; Wang & Strittmatter, 1996 ).\n\n3.4.4. Putative CRMP active site\n\nAlthough CRMPs are closely related to the enzyme DHPase, essential residues mediating DHPase activity are missing in CRMPs, including CRMP-4. Only two of the six residues crucial for metal binding to DHPases are present in CRMP-4, and the carboxylated lysine bridging the two zinc ions is replaced by leucine (Leu165). However, the active-site-like cavity is still present in CRMP-4 and other CRMPs (Deo et al., 2004 ; Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ; Stenmark et al., 2007 ). With a pocket volume of around 893 Å3, it is more solvent-exposed and larger than the pockets in CRMP-1 (540 Å3) and CRMP-2 (580 Å3) and is considerably larger than that in CRMP-5 (277 Å3). Recently, CRMP-3, but not CRMP-4, was shown to exhibit histone H4 deacetylase activity which leads to E2F1-dependent neuronal death (Hou et al., 2013 ). Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are grouped into four classes and are either NAD+- or Zn2+-dependent enzymes (Bottomley et al., 2008 ; Lombardi et al., 2011 ). The active site of the metal-dependent deacetylases contains a zinc ion coordinated by the side chains of two conserved aspartate residues and one histidine residue. Furthermore, a tyrosine or histidine residue is involved in the stabilization of the transition state. Given the high sequence identity between CRMP-3 and CRMP-2 (77%), a reliable model could be obtained for CRMP-3 (see above). In the modelled CRMP-3 structure important DHPase active-site residues are absent and are replaced by the same residues as observed in CRMP-4. At 693 Å3, the pocket volume is slightly smaller than for CRMP-4. Since there is no classical NAD+-binding site found in CRMPs, available CRMP models were scanned for potential Zn-binding sites using the FEATURE metal-scanning web server (https://feature.stanford.edu/metals/ ; Ebert & Altman, 2008 ). Several potential Zn-binding sites were identified in the active-site-like pocket in the available experimental and modelled CRMP structures. However, only one site was unique to CRMP-3 and similar to HDAC active sites. This putative binding site for a zinc ion is found at the entrance of the pocket, comprising residues His227 and Glu200. His223 and Tyr170 found in the vicinity might also take part in mediating deacetylase activity (Supplementary Fig. S5). In CRMP-4 and other CRMPs His227 is replaced by Arg, therefore blocking the potential zinc ion-binding site. Other predicted sites were not unique or lacked at least one of the crucial residues for HDAC activity, e.g. Tyr170. Nonetheless, this requires further experimental investigation.\n\n3.4.5. CRMP-4 I141V mutation in ALS patients\n\nRecently, a mutation in the DPYSL3 gene encoding CRMP-4, c.421A>G (I141V; Supplementary Fig. S4), has been described in some ALS patient groups (Blasco et al., 2013 ). Experiments in cell cultures expressing the CRMP-4 mutant variant showed impairment of motor neuron survival as well as axonal outgrowth. The replacement of an Ile by a Val is a very conservative mutation, which would not necessarily have a drastic impact on the structural integrity of the protein. In the CRMP-4 crystal structure the mutation site is located close to the surface of the tetramer (Fig. 6a). The residue is central to a hydrophobic cluster in the core of the protein (Fig. 6b). Owing to the missing Cδ atom the observed mutation would cause a small void in this cluster. It is possible that this void destabilizes the protein slightly and/or causes some changes in the adjacent surface for protein binding, which could explain the biological effect. Ile141 is strictly conserved within the CRMP family in humans and amongst CRMP-4s between species. However, in human DHP the equivalent residue (135) is a Val, but here several other residues are altered in the cluster to compensate for the missing Cδ. Further in vivo and in vitro studies using purified mutant protein will help to explain the observed functional impairment."
