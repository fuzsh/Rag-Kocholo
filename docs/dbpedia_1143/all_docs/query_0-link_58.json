        "text": "Neurogenesis and neuritogenesis\n\nThe generation of neurons (neurogenesis) in various regions of the central nervous system depends on a carefully regulated process of neural progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation. During early development, the neural tube wall constitutes a pseudo-stratified epithelium made of highly polarized neuroepithelial cells. The proper amount of neurons is spatially and temporally controlled by accumulative activities of numerous extra-/intra-cellular factors. At the onset of neurogenesis and initiated by extracellular regulators (Notch, bone morphogenetic proteins, BDNF/TrKB/p75, Wnt/β-catenin/Sonic hedgehog)[11-13] and intracytoplasmic transcription factors (bHLH, Insm1, AP2γ, TRIM32)[14-16], these cells switch their identity and turn into radial glial cells (RG) expressing glutamate-aspartate transporter and brain-lipid binding protein[17]. They generate all diverse intermediate progenitor neurons and glial cells through orchestrations of numerous molecules (Nrg1, Foxg1, Retinoid acid)[18-20] and signaling mechanisms (Jack/Stat, Notch, BMP, FGF)[21-23]. Shortly after, the pro-neural factors (Ngn1/Ngn2/Ascl1, also known as Mash1)[24,25] and transcription factors (Salb2, Sima1Am2, Lhx2)[26-28] activate a generic program of neurogenesis, arrest the division of progenitor cells, suppress the alternative astroglial fate and select the neuronal fate. Subsequently, the newborn neurons extend neurites (neuritogenesis which begins with the concerted accumulation and organization of actin/microtubules) and migrate to appropriate locations. However, due to heterogeneous neuronal phenotypes generated at different times, in different layers and locations, there is considerable heterogeneity in neuritogenesis mechanisms. This makes it difficult to observe in vivo although we found recently that collapsin-response-mediator-protein (CRMP)3[29] has a profound influence on lamellopodia formation, neuritogenesis and dendritic arborization in vertebrate hippocampal neurons: The CRMP3-/- knock-out mice[30] display abnormal functional and structural neural networks associated with a delay in neurite outgrowth and alterations of dendrites and spines but not axon-morphology in hippocampal neurons during development that persist in adults. These alterations affect a subset of hippocampal circuits and hippocampal function: CRMP3-/- mice have a deficit in prepulse inhibition found in several mental diseases and abnormal long term potentiation (LTP). Such a bona fide mouse model is a critical first step towards exploring pathogenic mechanisms. There is increasing evidence that other CRMPs are involved in neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus and the olfactory system, and also regulate dendritic/axonal outgrowth[31-33]. Specifically, required for NT3-induced axon outgrowth/branching and linking kinesin to the Sra-1/WAVE cargo complex in axons, CRMP2 can convert established dendrites to axon or induce supernumerary axons[34] while mice lacking individual CRMP1, 4 or 5 present alterations in neuronal differentiation of specific brain areas and the behavior they control[35-37].\n\nAnother way to investigate neuritogenesis is using primary hippocampal neurons in culture. Few hours after plating, neurons start to extend minor neurites; then one of the multiple neurites extends rapidly and by morphological transformation generates the axon through stochastic selection; the other neurites mature into dendrites, leading to neuronal polarity. Live cell imaging using time-lapse video microscopy shows that the first two neurites have the highest potential to become axon. Because cultured neurons develop polarity without any presence of exogenous extracellular guidance/neurotropic cues, it has been suggested that an internal polarization program exists involving several intra-neuronal organelles and distinct repertoires of signaling molecules intrinsic to the neuron. Using that model, we reported that whereas neurons from heterozygous CRMP3+/- mice polarized and grew similarly to control wild type (WT), all CRMP3-/- neurons from homozygous CRMP3-/- littermates did not establish neuronal polarity. Such impairment in neurites to progress from stage 1 to stage 2 represents a failure of neurite initiation. Moreover, the correlation between the levels of CRMP3 expression and its activation of L- and N-type of voltage-gated calcium channels suggests that the facilitatory role of CRMP3 on neurite initiation, dendritic development and plasticity may be mediated via Ca2+ influx[38]. Other factors such as neurotrophins, extracellular matrix proteins, attractant/repellent guidance cues and guide-post proteins are considered extrinsic signals. Interactions between these molecules can provide short/long range guidance information or stably change the intrinsic ability of a neuron to extend/retract neurites during development or to engage them into an axono/dendritic differentiation path. It is tempting to suggest that similar players are required to refine neuritogenesis and to make synaptic connections (synaptogenesis) in vivo within the developing brain.\n\nSynaptogenesis and neuronal network genesis\n\nBrain complexity comes from the large diversity and number of neurons and the variety and number of synapses where neurons transfer their electrical and/or chemical signals to other neurons/cells. Electrical and chemical synapses differ in the molecular mechanisms supporting the transmission of information and in their morphological organization[39,40]. Their structure and composition vary across brain regions and their disruption in function and morphology may be involved in many neurological/mental diseases and after trauma. Electrical synapses are also a prerequisite for the chemical synapses formation in mammal brain during development. Within electrical synapses the gap junction channels processed by connexins and pannexins serve as conduits allowing a direct bidirectional communication and passage/exchange of metabolites, intracytoplasmic messengers, and ions between the cytoplasm of two cells (Figure 1B). Within neuronal networks, these electrical synapses provide synchronous electrical activity and field potential oscillations. They mediate an important form of direct intercellular communication and allow rapid transfers of pre-synaptic excitatory electrical impulses to post-synaptic potentials throughout the intercellular gap by generating synchronous oscillations of gamma-frequency (30-70 Hz) rhythms important for field potential oscillation within neuronal networks and necessary for the interplay of neural populations involved in memory processes.\n\nFigure 1 Diagrams illustrate chemical (A) and electrical (B) synapses. At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters (black) released from axonal boutons bind to postsynaptic receptors (light blue) and trigger specific signaling pathways via activation of proteins (red) in postsynaptic cells with prominent postsynaptic densities component (grey area). The information transmission is unidirectional (black arrow). At electrical synapses, gap junction channels (blue) directly connect the two adjacent cells, thus enable the bidirectional passage of electrical currents (black arrows) carried by ions (green), and of small peptides (yellow) or second messengers (dark red).\n\nIn contrast, there is no cytoplasmic junction between two cells at the two chemical synaptic subtypes: The excitatory asymmetric (mainly glutamatergic; Figure 1A) type I synapse has marked postsynaptic densities (PSD) while the inhibitory symmetric (mainly GABAergic) type II synapse has no thickened PSD. The genesis of chemical synapses is characterized by an enormous degree of complexity and diversity of protein-protein interactions. Axonal presynaptic boutons of excitatory synapses contain round clear vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitter glutamate and connected with dendritic spines while inhibitory presynaptic boutons contain slightly smaller vesicles and are most abundant at the neuronal soma. In CNS, maturation and stabilization of synaptic structures depend on neurexins and neurolignins, the molecule pairs in the CAM family[41-43], while plasticity which allows an individual to adapt to a rapid changing environment through strengthening, weakening, pruning or adding synaptic connection- is partially dependent on BDNF, ephrin, Wnts, NgR1, semaphorins class 3 and non-coding RNAs[44-48]. The mechanisms contributing to the synaptic plasticity include structural remodeling of the synapse, structural reorganization of presynaptic active zone, postsynaptic density area, protein synthesis, signal transduction pathways, Ca2+ fluxes, kinases activities, neuronal activities, change in transmitters release and receptors trafficking. However, plasticity creates a significant challenge to the intrinsic architecture and integrity of neural networks which is counterbalanced by compensatory regulatory mechanisms for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, leading to a balance between wiring plasticity and stability.\n\nSynapses, the sites where two neurons connect and pass information, are the building blocks of the neuronal networks defined by “a set of elements with time-variant properties that interact with each other” and network dynamics defined by the real-time changes in response to internal and external stimuli. It should be noted however that information is not stored in a chemical form but is processed and retrieved by neuronal networks. The global neuronal network complexity can be defined as a dynamic interconnected functional system characterized by a series of simpler networks organized into increasingly effective local or global complex networks constrained however by the intrinsic structural brain architecture[49]. It has the capacity to support complex thought, action and learned behavior that any single neuron/element of the system would not be able to support alone and its resting-state reflects the stable and intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. Importantly, dysfunction of local networks may spread easily between linked elements, leading to pathological cascades that cause dedifferentiation or trans-neuronal degeneration and encompass large areas of the system. It may also lead to dynamic adjustments and reorganization of the other networks to compensate these changes. Consistent with the view that network organization fundamentally influences brain diseases, many studies including connectomic approach, address the behavioral impairments that arise from network insults or dysfunction and challenge to predict patterns of disease spread and targets of intervention[50,51]. In various mental diseases, neuroimaging observations, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography report altered structures and functions of PFC and hipF and deficits in functional integration between these two elements (Figure 2) suggesting overlapping pathogenic mechanisms.\n\nFigure 2 Localized interregional connectivity. Diagram shows pathway connections of hippocampus (blue), amygdala (dark red), thalamus (orange) and prefrontal cortex (green). HippoC-PFC pathway originating from the subiculum and the CA1 of the hippocampus to the PFC is unidirectional, direct in a monosynaptic manner in rodents and primates. HippoC-AmyG pathway shows bidirectional connection between ventral HippoC with AmyG and the pathway AmyG-PFC has also bidirectional connections. Together, both the HippoC and PFC are reciprocally connected with the AmyG and disruption of these pathways, anatomically or functionally may be a common origin of mental diseases. Moreover, there are bidirectional connections between PFC/HippoC with Thalamus. PFC: Prefrontal cortex.\n\nThe PFC, which matures later in development than more caudal cortical regions, exerts “top-down” control of many cortical and sub-cortical areas; moreover some of its neuronal subpopulations exhibit complex dendritic arbor. Its development is characterized by growth in early childhood, decrease in adolescence and continued maturation in adulthood. It is well established in human that PFC is involved in language, maintenance of attention, executive functioning, organization of inputs from diverse sensory sources, coordination of goal-directed behavior, socialization and moral decisions. HipF is structurally and functionally heterogeneous. The anterior and posterior parts receive/extend different afferent and efferent connections and play a role in various functions such as learning and memory, stress, spatial and emotional processing. The neuronal projection from the HIP either directly -monosynaptic- or indirectly polysynaptic to the PFC is referred to as the hipocampal-PFC pathways (HIP-PFC). In rats, the direct monosynaptic HIP-PFC pathway originating from the CA1 and the subiculum projects to the anterior cingulated areas of the PFC through fimbria/fornix system. It exhibits activity-dependent synaptic plasticity such as LTP/LTD or depotentiation. Treatment with lidocaine disrupts its performance. However, fine details of the human HIP-PFC are lacking because direct powerful tract-tracing techniques cannot be applied. Within the hipF, neuroanatomical studies show that the ventral CA1 and subiculum also project to the basolateral amygdala (AmyG) which has a critical role in expression of fear and autonomic defense responses whereas recent works highlight the importance of distinct AmyG projections to other structures and their importance in controlling reward/learned behavior. Functional imaging in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP) shows that the rate of resting cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in AmyG is elevated and positively correlates with depression severity and relapse. In addition, the dual-projection of hippocampal neurons is crucial for coordinating PFC/AmyG activity during memory retrieval. Meanwhile, AmyG neurons densely arborize within superficial layers of PFC and form synapses with layer II pyramidal neurons. Disruption of the AmyG-PFC pathway increases choice of risky rewards suggesting that it is important for top-down control of emotion, anxiety and fear. Presently, it is well-established that patients suffering from a number of mental diseases, such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar and PTSD, display cognitive impairment, have structural abnormalities, disorganized neural networks and aberrant functional coupling within HIP/PFC/AmyG and their pathways[52-56].\n\nSchizophrenia\n\nSchizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder with variable symptomatology characterized by hallucination, delusion, anhedonia and cognitive dysfunction. Studies of post-mortem brains provide patterns of abnormalities that reflect failures in early brain development and maturation which can be attributed to alterations in gene expression (NRG1/Akt/Dysbindin-1/Reelin/COMT/DISC1) affecting neuronal differentiation[57-60], gene duplication (25q11-13, 16p11.2, 16p13.1)[61,62] or deletions (2p53, 3q29, 15q13-q14, 15p11.322q11.2)[63,64] . There is also evidence for contribution of multiple different epigenetic events [stress that activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increases dopamine brain function, viral infection, DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNAs]. Of note, recent proteomic, gene targeting, post-mortem and SNP linkage studies include CRMP1 and 2 in the list of schizophrenia susceptibility genes[65,66]. As schizophrenia typically starts in the late adolescence and as brain development is a continuous process, the remodeling of cortical and hippocampal structures and synaptic connections is thought to be critical. Indeed, patients with schizophrenia show structural anomalies in the HIP and cortical thinning in the PFC associated with aberrant functional coupling -i.e., reduced fractional anisotropy values in the superior longitudinal fasciculus white matter bundle between two areas during resting state or working memory present in both first-episode patients and persons at risk[67]. This scheme suggests that the dysfunction is not a consequence of the disease or treatment but is consistent with abnormal HIP/PFC interaction. Precisely, it has been proposed that deficit in emotional regulation is likely dependent on the dysfunction of HIP, which contributes to aberrant dopaminergic synaptic activities in nucleus accumbens, which in turn influences PFC maladaptive processes leading to delusion and psychosis. To this extent, structural and functional vulnerability and abnormalities of GABAergic, glutamatergic serotoninergic and cholinergic synapses have been reported by several groups[68,69]. As synapses are ultimately linked to neurotransmitter release and their signal transduction and as spine morphology is closely linked to synaptic function, altered spine shape, size and density have multiple functional effects on neuronal networks, and dendritic spine dysfunction may have an etiological role in schizophrenia. Several post-mortem studies reveal altered white matter myelination/projection and a profound reduction in spine density in the PFC of patients while the reduction in spine density found in the auditory cortex could potentially be associated with auditory hallucinations. Other evidence suggest that the heterogeneity of schizophrenia may originate from larger disturbances in neural elements of several interconnected brain circuits and structures[70] including HIP, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, AmyG, superior and transverse temporal gyri, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, and several nuclei of the thalamus. Indeed normal neural structure in morphometric imaging may not guarantee normal function.\n\nNP treatment with CBD3, a peptide derived from CRMP2\n\nPresently, the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of NP is incomplete, and new concepts are needed to improve its treatment. Genetic and clinical studies have validated N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) as targets for NP treatment[116-118] but selective blockers have potential serious side effects. Targeting protein interactions to direct channel block has been proposed[119]. This approach has yielded a novel peptide-derived therapeutic prototype for NP relief: A CRMP2-derived peptide (tat-CBD3; Figure 3) that disrupts the CaV2.2/CRMP2 interaction shows anti-nociceptive activity in animal models of neuropathic pain[120]. The relative lack of toxicity provides evidence that CBD3 has therapeutic promise[121]. Recent efforts to optimize the peptide’s efficacy resulted in the generation of a myristoylated version of the peptide; myr-tat-CBD3 -a myristoylated CBD3 peptide harboring a 14-carbon fatty acid, myristate, onto an N-terminal glycine[122]. N-myristoylation is a lipid anchor modification of eukaryotic and viral proteins targeting them irreversibly to locate to the membrane[123-125]. Tethering the CBD3 peptide to the membrane through myristoylation confines its action(s) to the uncoupling of membrane CaV2.2-CRMP2 and blocks Ca2+ influx without affecting the CRMP2 functions mediated by interactions with other cytoplasmic proteins[126].\n\nFigure 3 A possible model for N-myristoylated collapsin response mediator protein 2 peptide’s actions on CaV2. 2 trafficking and efficacy in neuropathic pain model. Application of an N-myristoylated tat-conjugated CRMP2 peptide (myr-tat-CBD3) results in membrane-delimited “rimming” of the peptide whereas the non-myristoylated version (tat-CBD3) appears to be spatially diffusely distributed in the cell cytoplasm. Analysis of penetration of peptides into GPMVs, which are “blebs” of membrane devoid of organelles and actin cytoskeleton, reveals an unrestricted distribution of the membrane sensitive dye (di-4-ANNEPDHQ) with tat-CBD3, whereas the myristoylated peptide induces a lateral heterogeneity of the fluorescent signal resulting in dye aggregation into micro domains within these model membranes[122]. While CRMP2 has been demonstrated to exist as a tetramer, the oligomeric state of membrane proximal CRMP2 is as yet unknown; however, neither peptide appears to affect CRMP2 oligomerization[123]. Whereas the cells take up both forms of the peptide with similar efficiency, the myristoylated peptide demonstrates a lesser degree of efflux[124]. The apparent increase in retention of myr-tat-CBD3 translates into a superior potency and efficacy in inhibition of evoked calcium influx in sensory neurons presumably via greater uncoupling of CRMP2-CaV2.2 interactions at or juxta-membrane[125]. Increased inhibition of CaV2.2 surface trafficking induced by myr-tat-CBD3 compared with tat-CBD3 may account[126] for the more pronounced restriction of calcium influx imposed by the myristoylated peptide. Cdk5-phosphorylated CRMP2 has been demonstrated to have an enhanced interaction with CaV2.2[129]; however myr-tat-CBD3 does not affect the levels of Cdk5-phosphorylated CRMP2[127], thereby ruling out a role of phosphorylated CRMP2 in regulating calcium influx. CRMP2 binding to tubulin is strengthened by the peptides[130]; the consequences of this are currently unknown. Importantly, where tat-CBD3 is completely ineffective in reversing mechanical hypersensitivity in a rat neuropathic pain model (tibial nerve injury), the myristoylated peptide reverses this hypersensitivity when administered in vivo[122]. Neither peptide elicits any reward-like addictive behaviors. GPMVs: Giant plasma membrane vesicles; CRMP: Collapsin response mediator proteins.\n\nAs summarized in Figure 3, the myr-tat-CBD3 peptide is equal or better in its efficacy to tat-CBD3 on reducing pain-related behaviors with pronounced reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity in a postoperative incisional pain model[127] at dose of 0.1 mg/kg in contrast to the lack of effect observed even at 20 mg/kg of tat-CBD3[122]. Moreover sustained relief (> 6 wk) of NP was obtained with an AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat DRG[128]. Both tat-CBD3 and myr-tat-CB3 reduce pain-like behaviors without demonstrating any reward-like potential. These experiments demonstrate the possibility of tailoring molecules that affect membrane targets for specific inhibition of CaV2.2-CRMP2 interactions (Figure 3)."
