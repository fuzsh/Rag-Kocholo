Their density and structure are shaped by experience, pointing to their role in memory encoding. Dendritic spine imaging, followed by manual analysis, is a primary way to study spines. However, an approach that analyses dendritic spines images in an automated and unbiased manner is needed to fully capture how spines change with normal experience, as well as in disease.NEW METHOD: We propose an approach based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) to detect dendritic spines in two-dimensional maximum-intensity projected images from confocal fluorescent micrographs. We experiment on both fractionally strided convolution and efficient sub-pixel convolutions. Dendritic spines far from the dendritic shaft are pruned by extraction of the shaft to reduce false positives. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing predicted spine positions to those manually marked by experts.RESULTS: The averaged distance between predicted and manually annotated spines is 2.81±2.63 pixels (0.082±0.076 microns) and 2.87±2.33 pixels (0.084±0.068 microns) based on two different experts. FCN-based detection achieves F scores > 0.80 for both sets of expert annotations.COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Our method significantly outperforms two well-known software, NeuronStudio and Neurolucida (p-value < 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: FCN architectures used in this work allow for automated dendritic spine detection. Superior outcomes are possible even with small training data-sets. The proposed method may generalize to other datasets on larger scales.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30130608\n\nAbstract\n\nSynapse density on cortical pyramidal neurons is modulated by experience. This process is highest during developmental critical periods, when mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are fully engaged. In mouse visual cortex, the critical period for ocular dominance (OD) plasticity coincides with the developmental pruning of synapses. At this time, mice lacking paired Ig-like receptor B (PirB) have excess numbers of dendritic spines on L5 neurons; these spines persist and are thought to underlie the juvenile-like OD plasticity observed in adulthood. Here we examine whether PirB is required specifically in excitatory neurons to exert its effect on dendritic spine and synapse density during the critical period. In mice with a conditional allele of PirB (PirB(fl/fl)), PirB was deleted only from L2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo by timed in utero electroporation of Cre recombinase. Sparse mosaic expression of Cre produced neurons lacking PirB in a sea of wild-type neurons and glia. These neurons had significantly elevated dendritic spine density, as well as increased frequency of miniature EPSCs, suggesting that they receive a greater number of synaptic inputs relative to Cre(-) neighbors. The effect of cell-specific PirB deletion on dendritic spine density was not accompanied by changes in dendritic branching complexity or axonal bouton density. Together, results imply a neuron-specific, cell-autonomous action of PirB on synaptic density in L2/3 pyramidal cells of visual cortex. Moreover, they are consistent with the idea that PirB functions normally to corepress spine density and synaptic plasticity, thereby maintaining headroom for cells to encode ongoing experience-dependent structural change throughout life.\n\nView details for PubMedID 27752542\n\nAbstract\n\nSynapse pruning is an activity-regulated process needed for proper circuit sculpting in the developing brain. Major histocompatibility class I (MHCI) molecules are regulated by activity, but little is known about their role in the development of connectivity in cortex. Here we show that protein for 2 MHCI molecules H2-Kb and H2-Db is associated with synapses in the visual cortex. Pyramidal neurons in mice lacking H2-Kb and H2-Db (KbDb KO) have more extensive cortical connectivity than normal. Modified rabies virus tracing was used to monitor the extent of pyramidal cell connectivity: Horizontal connectivity is greater in the visual cortex of KbDb KO mice. Basal dendrites of L2/3 pyramids, where many horizontal connections terminate, are more highly branched and have elevated spine density in the KO. Furthermore, the density of axonal boutons is elevated within L2/3 of mutant mice. These increases are accompanied by elevated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency, consistent with an increase in functional synapses. This functional and anatomical increase in intracortical connectivity is also associated with enhanced ocular dominance plasticity that persists into adulthood. Thus, these MHCI proteins regulate sculpting of local cortical circuits and in their absence, the excess connectivity can function as a substrate for cortical plasticity throughout life.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/cercor/bhu243\n\nView details for PubMedID 25316337\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring critical periods of development, the brain easily changes in response to environmental stimuli, but this neural plasticity declines by adulthood. By acutely disrupting paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) function at specific ages, we show that PirB actively represses neural plasticity throughout life. We disrupted PirB function either by genetically introducing a conditional PirB allele into mice or by minipump infusion of a soluble PirB ectodomain (sPirB) into mouse visual cortex. We found that neural plasticity, as measured by depriving mice of vision in one eye and testing ocular dominance, was enhanced by this treatment both during the critical period and when PirB function was disrupted in adulthood. Acute blockade of PirB triggered the formation of new functional synapses, as indicated by increases in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and spine density on dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In addition, recovery from amblyopia--the decline in visual acuity and spine density resulting from long-term monocular deprivation--was possible after a 1-week infusion of sPirB after the deprivation period. Thus, neural plasticity in adult visual cortex is actively repressed and can be enhanced by blocking PirB function.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/scitranslmed.3010157\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000343318000004\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4476552\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring critical periods of development, the brain easily changes in response to environmental stimuli, but this neural plasticity declines by adulthood.

Here we show that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule H2-D(b) is necessary and sufficient for synapse elimination in the retinogeniculate system. In mice lacking both H2-K(b) and H2-D(b) (K(b)D(b)(-/-)), despite intact retinal activity and basal synaptic transmission, the developmentally regulated decrease in functional convergence of retinal ganglion cell synaptic inputs to LGN neurons fails and eye-specific layers do not form. Neuronal expression of just H2-D(b) in K(b)D(b)(-/-) mice rescues both synapse elimination and eye-specific segregation despite a compromised immune system. When patterns of stimulation mimicking endogenous retinal waves are used to probe synaptic learning rules at retinogeniculate synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP) is intact but long-term depression (LTD) is impaired in K(b)D(b)(-/-) mice. This change is due to an increase in Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors. Restoring H2-D(b) to K(b)D(b)(-/-) neurons renders AMPA receptors Ca(2+) impermeable and rescues LTD. These observations reveal an MHC-class-I-mediated link between developmental synapse pruning and balanced synaptic learning rules enabling both LTD and LTP, and demonstrate a direct requirement for H2-D(b) in functional and structural synapse pruning in CNS neurons.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nature13154\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000335454300032\n\nView details for PubMedID 24695230\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4016165\n\nAbstract\n\nAmyloid-β (Aβ)-induced changes in synaptic function in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that Aβ generation and accumulation may affect fundamental mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of APP overexpression on a well characterized, in vivo, developmental model of systems-level plasticity, ocular dominance plasticity. Following monocular visual deprivation during the critical period, mice that express mutant alleles of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and Presenilin1 (PS1dE9), as well as mice that express APPswe alone, lack ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex. Defects in the spatial extent and magnitude of the plastic response are evident using two complementary approaches, Arc induction and optical imaging of intrinsic signals in awake mice. This defect in a classic paradigm of systems level synaptic plasticity shows that Aβ overexpression, even early in postnatal life, can perturb plasticity in cerebral cortex, and supports the idea that decreased synaptic plasticity due to elevated Aβ exposure contributes to cognitive impairment in AD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5369-11.2012\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000305091800024\n\nView details for PubMedID 22674275\n\nAbstract\n\nAn ideal preparation for investigating events during synaptogenesis would be one in which synapses are sparse, but can be induced at will using a rapid, exogenous trigger. We describe a culture system of immunopurified subplate neurons in which synaptogenesis can be triggered, providing the first homogeneous culture of neocortical neurons for the investigation of synapse development. Synapses in immunopurified rat subplate neurons are sparse, and can be induced by a 48-h exposure to feeder layers of neurons and glia, an induction more rapid than any previously reported. Induced synapses are electrophysiologically functional and ultrastructurally normal. Microarray and real-time PCR experiments reveal a new program of gene expression accompanying synaptogenesis. Surprisingly few known synaptic genes are upregulated during the first 24 h of synaptogenesis; Gene Ontology annotation reveals a preferential upregulation of synaptic genes only at a later time. In situ hybridization confirms that some of the genes regulated in cultures are also expressed in the developing cortex. This culture system provides both a means of studying synapse formation in a homogeneous population of cortical neurons, and better synchronization of synaptogenesis, permitting the investigation of neuron-wide events following the triggering of synapse formation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/cercor/bhn194\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000267888000003\n\nView details for PubMedID 19029062\n\nAbstract\n\nExperience can shape cortical circuits, especially during critical periods for plasticity. In visual cortex, imbalance of activity from the two eyes during the critical period shifts ocular dominance (OD) towards the more active eye. Inhibitory circuits are crucial in this process: OD plasticity is absent in GAD65KO mice that show diminished inhibition. This defect can be rescued by application of benzodiazepines, which increase GABAergic signalling. However, it is unknown how such changes in inhibition might disrupt and then restore OD plasticity. Since NMDA dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms are also known to contribute to OD plasticity, we investigated whether NMDA receptor levels and function are also altered in GAD65KO. There are reduced NR2A levels and slower NMDA currents in visual cortex of GAD65KO mice. Application of benzodiazepines, which rescues OD plasticity, also increases NR2A levels. Thus it appears as if OD plasticity can be restored by adding a critical amount of excitatory transmission through NR2A-containing NMDA receptors. Together, these observations can unify competing ideas of how OD plasticity is regulated: changes in either inhibition or excitation would engage homeostatic mechanisms that converge to regulate NMDA receptors, thereby enabling plasticity mechanisms and also ensuring circuit stability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.171215\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000266981400020\n\nView details for PubMedID 19406876\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are more than 50 class I MHC (MHCI) molecules in the mouse genome, some of which are now known to be expressed in neurons; however, the role of classical MHCI molecules in synaptic plasticity is unknown. We report that the classical MHCI molecules, H2-K(b) and H2-D(b), are co-expressed by Purkinje cells (PCs). In the cerebellum of mice deficient for both H2-K(b) and H2-D(b) (K(b)D(b-/-)), there is a lower threshold for induction of long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber to PC synapses. This change may be a result of additional glutamate release observed at K(b)D(b-/-) CF to PC synapses, which are thought to \"train\" the cerebellar circuit. A behavioral correlate of cerebellar LTD is motor learning; acquisition and retention of a Rotarod behavioral task is significantly better in K(b)D(b-/-) mice than in WT cohorts. These physiological and behavioral phenotypes in K(b)D(b-/-) mice reveal a surprising role for classical MHCI molecules in synaptic plasticity and motor learning.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.0902018106\n\nView details for PubMedID 19346486\n\nAbstract\n\nUntil recently, neurons in the healthy brain were considered immune-privileged because they did not appear to express MHC class I (MHCI). However, MHCI mRNA was found to be regulated by neural activity in the developing visual system and has been detected in other regions of the uninjured brain. Here we show that MHCI regulates aspects of synaptic function in response to activity. MHCI protein is colocalized postsynaptically with PSD-95 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons. In vitro, whole-cell recordings of hippocampal neurons from beta2m/TAP1 knockout (KO) mice, which have reduced MHCI surface levels, indicate a 40% increase in mini-EPSC (mEPSC) frequency. mEPSC frequency is also increased 100% in layer 4 cortical neurons. Similarly, in KO hippocampal cultures, there is a modest increase in the size of presynaptic boutons relative to WT, whereas postsynaptic parameters (PSD-95 puncta size and mEPSC amplitude) are normal. In EM of intact hippocampus, KO synapses show a corresponding increase in vesicles number. Finally, KO neurons in vitro fail to respond normally to TTX treatment by scaling up synaptic parameters. Together, these results suggest that postsynaptically localized MHCl acts in homeostatic regulation of synaptic function and morphology during development and in response to activity blockade. The results also imply that MHCI acts retrogradely across the synapse to translate activity into lasting change in structure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.0702023104\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000245869200061\n\nView details for PubMedID 17420446\n\nAbstract\n\nMHC class I proteins are cell-surface ligands that bind to T cell receptors and other immunoreceptors and act to regulate the activation state of immune cells. Recent work has shown that MHC class I genes and CD3zeta, an obligate component of T cell receptors, are expressed in neurons, are regulated by neuronal activity, and function in neuronal development and plasticity. A search for additional neuronally expressed T cell receptor components has revealed that the T cell antigen receptor beta (TCRbeta) locus is expressed in neurons of the murine central nervous system and that this expression is dynamically regulated over development. In neonates, expression is most abundant in various thalamic nuclei. At later ages and in adults, thalamic expression fades and cortical expression is robust, particularly in layer 6. In T cells, protein-encoding transcripts are produced only after recombination of the TCRbeta genomic locus, which joins variable, diversity, and joining regions, a process that creates much of the diversity of the immune system. We detect no genomic recombination in neurons. Rather, transcripts begin in regions upstream of several joining regions, and are spliced to constant region segments. One of the transcripts encodes a hypothetical 207-aa, 23-kDa protein, which includes the TCRbeta J2.7 region, and the entire C region. These observations suggest that TCRbeta may function in neurons.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1735415100\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000186301100097\n\nView details for PubMedID 14569018\n\nAbstract\n\nIn cortical development, subplate axons pioneer the pathway from neocortex to the internal capsule, leading to the proposal that they are required for subsequent area-specific innervation of cortex by thalamic axons. A role for p75 neutrophin receptor (NTR) in area-specific thalamic innervation of cortex is suggested by the observation that p75NTR expression is restricted to subplate neurons in a low-rostral to high-caudal gradient throughout the period of thalamocortical innervation. In vitro, neurotrophin 3 binding to p75NTR increases neurite length and filopodial formation of immunopurified subplate neurons, suggesting a role for p75NTR in subplate growth cone morphology and function in vivo. Consistent with this idea, subplate growth cones have markedly fewer filopodia in mice lacking p75NTR than in wild type mice. Despite this gross morphologic defect, many subplate axons in knock-out mice pioneer the projection to the internal capsule as they do in wild-type mice. However a few subplate axons in the knock-out mice make ectopic projections rostral in the intermediate zone and frontal cortex. Concomitant with the altered morphology of subplate growth cones, mice lacking p75NTR have diminished innervation of visual cortex from the lateral geniculate nucleus, with markedly reduced or absent connections in 48% of knock-out mice. Thalamic projections to auditory and somatosensory cortex are normal, consistent with the gradient of p75NTR expression. Our present results are unusual in that they argue that p75NTR functions in a novel way in subplate neurons, that is, in growth cone morphology and function rather than in axon extension or neuronal survival.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000175296200035\n\nView details for PubMedID 11978834\n\nAbstract\n\nThe thalamocortical axon (TCA) projection originates in dorsal thalamus, conveys sensory input to the neocortex, and has a critical role in cortical development. We show that the secreted axon guidance molecule netrin-1 acts in vitro as an attractant and growth promoter for dorsal thalamic axons and is required for the proper development of the TCA projection in vivo. As TCAs approach the hypothalamus, they turn laterally into the ventral telencephalon and extend toward the cortex through a population of netrin-1-expressing cells. DCC and neogenin, receptors implicated in mediating the attractant effects of netrin-1, are expressed in dorsal thalamus, whereas unc5h2 and unc5h3, netrin-1 receptors implicated in repulsion, are not. In vitro, dorsal thalamic axons show biased growth toward a source of netrin-1, which can be abolished by netrin-1-blocking antibodies. Netrin-1 also enhances overall axon outgrowth from explants of dorsal thalamus. The biased growth of dorsal thalamic axons toward the internal capsule zone of ventral telencephalic explants is attenuated, but not significantly, by netrin-1-blocking antibodies, suggesting that it releases another attractant activity for TCAs in addition to netrin-1. Analyses of netrin-1 -/- mice reveal that the TCA projection through the ventral telencephalon is disorganized, their pathway is abnormally restricted, and fewer dorsal thalamic axons reach cortex. These findings demonstrate that netrin-1 promotes the growth of TCAs through the ventral telencephalon and cooperates with other guidance cues to control their pathfinding from dorsal thalamus to cortex.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000088354000032\n\nView details for PubMedID 10908620\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent studies have proposed roles for neurotrophins in the formation and plasticity of ocular dominance columns as well as in the regulation of dendritic arborization in visual cortex of higher mammals. To assess potential roles for neurotrophins in these processes, we have examined the developmental expression of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA in the cat's visual system using in situ hybridization. BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs are dynamically regulated in many CNS structures during embryonic and postnatal development, and both mRNAs undergo striking developmental changes in laminar specificity and levels of expression within primary visual cortex during the critical period for ocular dominance column formation. Within visual cortex, BDNF mRNA is found in neurons in deep cortical layers (5 and 6) prior to eye opening, and in both deep and superficial layers (2 and 3) shortly afterwards. Within layer 4, the target of thalamocortical axons, BDNF mRNA is low initially and rises to high levels by the end of the critical period for ocular dominance column formation. NT-3 mRNA is first detectable in small stellate neurons at the base of layer 4 (4c) after eye opening, and levels decrease near the end of the critical period. BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs can be detected in the lateral geniculate nucleus at birth, and levels peak during the critical period. In both structures, BDNF mRNA expression is maintained into adulthood, while NT-3 is undetectable in the adult. The presence and dynamic regulation of these neurotrophins in visual structures is consistent with suggested roles for both of these neurotrophins in axonal and dendritic remodeling known to accompany the formation of ocular dominance columns.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000086207000001\n\nView details for PubMedID 10745216\n\nAbstract\n\nThe neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has emerged as a candidate retrograde signaling molecule for geniculocortical axons during the formation of ocular dominance columns. Here we examined whether neuronal activity can regulate BDNF mRNA in eye-specific circuits in the developing cat visual system. Dark-rearing throughout the critical period for ocular dominance column formation decreases levels of BDNF mRNA within primary visual cortex, whereas short-term (2 d) binocular blockade of retinal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) downregulates BDNF mRNA within the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortical areas. Brief (6 hr to 2 d) monocular TTX blockade during the critical period and also in adulthood causes downregulation in appropriate eye-specific laminae in the LGN and ocular dominance columns within primary visual cortex. Monocular TTX blockade at postnatal day 23 also downregulates BDNF mRNA in a periodic fashion, consistent with recent observations that ocular dominance columns can be detected at these early ages by physiological methods. In contrast, 10 d monocular TTX during the critical period does not cause a lasting decrease in BDNF mRNA expression in columns pertaining to the treated eye, consistent with the nearly complete shift in physiological response properties of cortical neurons in favor of the unmanipulated eye known to result from long-term monocular deprivation. These observations demonstrate that BDNF mRNA levels can provide an accurate \"molecular readout\" of the activity levels of cortical neurons and are consistent with a highly local action of BDNF in strengthening and maintaining active synapses during ocular dominance column formation.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000085181200021\n\nView details for PubMedID 10662837\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring visual system development, neural activity regulates structural changes in connectivity including axonal branching and dendritic growth. Here we have examined a role for the candidate plasticity gene 15 (cpg15), which encodes an activity-regulated molecule that can promote dendritic growth, in this process. We report that cpg15 is expressed in the cat visual system at relatively high levels in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) but at very low levels in its synaptic target, layer 4 of the visual cortex. Prenatally, when cpg15 mRNA in the LGN is most abundant, expression is insensitive to action potential blockade by tetrodotoxin. Postnatally, activity regulation of cpg15 emerges in the LGN coincident with development of ocular dominance columns in the visual cortex. cpg15 can be detected in layers 2/3 and 5/6 of visual cortex postnatally, and expression in layers 2/3 is activity-regulated during known periods of activity-dependent plasticity for these layers. Localization and regulation of cpg15 expression in the visual system are consistent with a presynaptic role for CPG15 in shaping dendritic arbors of target neurons during activity-dependent synaptic rearrangements, both in development and adulthood.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000082539900032\n\nView details for PubMedID 10479700\n\nAbstract\n\nPropagating neural activity in the developing mammalian retina is required for the normal patterning of retinothalamic connections. This activity exhibits a complex spatiotemporal pattern of initiation, propagation, and termination. Here, we discuss the behavior of a model of the developing retina using a combination of simulation and analytic calculation. Our model produces spatially and temporally restricted waves without requiring inhibition, consistent with the early depolarizing action of neurotransmitters in the retina. We find that highly correlated, temporally regular, and spatially restricted activity occurs over a range of network parameters; this ensures that such spatiotemporal patterns can be produced robustly by immature neural networks in which synaptic transmission by individual neurons may be unreliable. Wider variation of these parameters, however, results in several different regimes of wave behavior. We also present evidence that wave properties are locally determined by a single variable, the fraction of recruitable (i.e., nonrefractory) cells within the dendritic field of a retinal neuron. From this perspective, a given local area's ability to support waves with a wide range of propagation velocities-as observed in experiment-reflects the variability in the local state of excitability of that area. This prediction is supported by whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, which measure significant wave-to-wave variability in the amount of synaptic input a cell receives when it participates in a wave. This approach to describing the developing retina provides unique insight into how the organization of a neural circuit can lead to the generation of complex correlated activity patterns.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000079883700031\n\nView details for PubMedID 10212317\n\nAbstract\n\nNeural activity is critical for sculpting the intricate circuits of the nervous system from initially imprecise neuronal connections. Disrupting the formation of these precise circuits may underlie many common neurodevelopmental disorders, ranging from subtle learning disorders to pervasive developmental delay. The necessity for sensory-driven activity has been widely recognized as crucial for infant brain development. Recent experiments in neurobiology now point to a similar requirement for endogenous neural activity generated by the nervous system itself before sensory input is available. Here we use the formation of precise neural circuits in the visual system to illustrate the principles of activity-dependent development. Competition between the projections from lateral geniculate nucleus neurons that receive sensory input from the two eyes shapes eye-specific connections from an initially diffuse projection into ocular dominance columns. When the competition is altered during a critical period for these changes, by depriving one eye of vision, the normal ocular dominance column pattern is disrupted. Before ocular dominance column formation, the highly ordered projection from retina to lateral geniculate nucleus develops. These connections form before the retina can respond to light, but at a time when retinal ganglion cells spontaneously generate highly correlated bursts of action potentials. Blockade of this endogenous activity, or biasing the competition in favor of one eye, results in a severe disruption of the pattern of retinogeniculate connections. Similar spontaneous, correlated activity has been identified in many locations in the developing central nervous system and is likely to be used during the formation of precise connections in many other neural systems. Understanding the processes of activity-dependent development could revolutionize our ability to identify, prevent, and treat developmental disorders resulting from disruptions of neural activity that interfere with the formation of precise neural circuits.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000079476200001\n\nView details for PubMedID 10203134\n\nAbstract\n\nSubplate neurons are early-generated neurons that project into the overlying neocortex and are required for the formation of ocular dominance columns. A subset of subplate neurons express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and produce nitric oxide (NO), a neuronal messenger thought to be involved in adult hippocampal synaptic plasticity and also in the establishment of certain specific connections during visual system development. Here, we examine whether the NOS-containing subplate neurons are involved in ocular dominance column formation in the ferret visual system. Ocular dominance columns form in ferrets between postnatal day 35 (P35) and P60. NOS expression in the visual subplate is low at birth, increases to a maximum at the onset of ocular dominance column formation, and falls thereafter. Nevertheless, blockade of NOS with daily injections of nitroarginine from P14 to P56 fails to prevent the formation of ocular dominance columns, although NOS activity is reduced by >98%. To test further a requirement for NOS in the patterning of connections during CNS development, we examined the cortical barrels in the somatosensory system of mice carrying targeted disruptions of NOS that also received injections of nitroarginine; cortical barrels formed normally in these animals. In addition, barrel field plasticity induced by whisker ablation at birth was normal in nitroarginine-injected NOS knock-out mice. Thus, despite the dynamic regulation of NOS in subplate neurons, NO is unlikely to be essential for the patterning of thalamocortical connections either in visual or somatosensory systems.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000076616600027\n\nView details for PubMedID 9786989\n\nAbstract\n\nTo elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent synaptic remodeling in the developing mammalian visual system, we screened for genes whose expression in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is regulated by spontaneously generated action potentials present prior to vision. Activity blockade did not alter expression in the LGN of 32 known genes. Differential mRNA display, however, revealed a decrease in mRNAs encoding class I major histocompatibility complex antigens (class I MHC). Postnatally, visually driven activity can regulate class I MHC in the LGN during the final remodeling of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals. Moreover, in the mature hippocampus, class I MHC mRNA levels are increased by kainic acid-induced seizures. Normal expression of class I MHC mRNA is correlated with times and regions of synaptic plasticity, and immunohistochemistry confirms that class I MHC is present in specific subsets of CNS neurons. Finally, beta2-microglobulin, a cosubunit of class I MHC, and CD3zeta, a component of a receptor complex for class I MHC, are also expressed by CNS neurons. These observations indicate that class I MHC molecules, classically thought to mediate cell-cell interactions exclusively in immune function, may play a novel role in neuronal signaling and activity-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000076196400008\n\nView details for PubMedID 9768838\n\nAbstract\n\nSubplate neurons, the first neurons of the cerebral cortex to differentiate and mature, are thought to be essential for the formation of connections between thalamus and cortex, such as the system of ocular dominance columns within layer 4 of visual cortex. To learn more about the requirement for subplate neurons in the formation of thalamocortical connections, we have sought to identify the neurotransmitters and peptides expressed by the specific class of subplate neurons that sends axonal projections into the overlying visual cortex. To label retrogradely subplate neurons, fluorescent latex microspheres were injected into primary visual cortex of postnatal day 28 ferrets, just prior to the onset of ocular dominance column formation. Subsequently, neurons were immunostained with antibodies against glutamate, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-67), parvalbumin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SRIF), or nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Retrograde labeling results indicate that the majority of subplate neurons projecting into the cortical plate reside in the upper half of the subplate. Combined immunostaining and microsphere labeling reveal that about half of cortically projecting subplate neurons are glutamatergic; most microsphere-labeled subplate neurons do not stain for GAD-67, parvalbumin, NPY, SRIF, or NOS. These observations suggest that subplate neurons can provide a significant glutamatergic synaptic input to the cortical plate, including the neurons of layer 4. If so, excitation from the axons of subplate neurons may be required in addition to that from lateral geniculate nucleus neurons for the activity-dependent synaptic interactions that lead to the formation of ocular dominance columns during development.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000075035900006\n\nView details for PubMedID 9703030\n\nAbstract\n\nThe semaphorins constitute a large gene family of transmembrane and secreted molecules, many of which are expressed in the nervous system. Genetic studies in Drosophila have revealed a role for semaphorins in axon guidance and synapse formation, and several in vitro studies in mice have demonstrated a dramatic chemorepellent effect of semaphorin III (Sema III) on the axons of several populations of neurons. To investigate the function of Sema III during in vivo axon guidance in the mammalian CNS, we studied the development of axonal projections in mutant mice lacking Sema III. Projections were studied for which either the in vitro evidence suggests a role for Sema III in axon guidance (e.g., cerebellar mossy fibers, thalamocortical axons, or cranial motor neurons) or the in vivo expression suggests a role for Sema III in axon guidance (e.g., cerebellar Purkinje cells, neocortex). We find that many major axonal projections, including climbing fiber, mossy fiber, thalamocortical, and basal forebrain projections and cranial nerves, develop normally in the absence of Sema III. Despite its in vitro function and in vivo expression, it appears as if Sema III is not absolutely required for the formation of many major CNS tracts. Such data are consistent with recent models suggesting that axon guidance is controlled by a balance of forces resulting from multiple guidance cues. Our data lead us to suggest that if Sema III functions in part to guide the formation of major axonal projections, then it does so in combination with both other semaphorins and other families of guidance molecules.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000075037700001\n\nView details for PubMedID 9675049\n\nAbstract\n\nNMDA receptors have been implicated in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the developing visual cortex. We examined the distribution of immunocytochemically detectable NMDAR1 in visual cortex of cats and ferrets from late embryonic ages to adulthood. Cortical neurons are initially highly immunostained. This level declines gradually over development, with the notable exception of cortical layers 2/3, where levels of NMDAR1 immunostaining remain high into adulthood. Within layer 4, the decline in NMDAR1 immunostaining to adult levels coincides with the completion of ocular dominance column formation and the end of the critical period for layer 4. To determine whether NMDAR1 immunoreactivity is regulated by retinal activity, animals were dark-reared or retinal activity was completely blocked in one eye with tetrodotoxin (TTX). Dark-rearing does not cause detectable changes in NMDAR1 immunoreactivity. However, 2 weeks of monocular TTX administration decreases NMDAR1 immunoreactivity in layer 4 of the columns of the blocked eye. Thus, high levels of NMDAR1 immunostaining within the visual cortex are temporally correlated with ocular dominance column formation and developmental plasticity; the persistence of staining in layers 2/3 also correlates with the physiological plasticity present in these layers in the adult. In addition, visual experience is not required for the developmental changes in the laminar pattern of NMDAR1 levels, but the presence of high levels of NMDAR1 in layer 4 during the critical period does require retinal activity. These observations are consistent with a central role for NMDA receptors in promoting and ultimately limiting synaptic rearrangements in the developing neocortex.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1997YC94700030\n\nView details for PubMedID 9334411\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have examined the hypothesis that the segregation of LGN axon terminals into ocular dominance (OD) patches in layer 4 of the visual cortex requires neurotrophins, acting as signals to modulate the pattern of synaptic connectivity. Neurotrophin receptor antagonists, composed of the extracellular domain of each member of the trk family of neurotrophin receptors fused to a human Fc domain, were infused directly into visual cortex during the peak phase of OD column formation. Infusion of trkB-IgG, which binds BDNF and NT-4/5, inhibited the formation of OD patches within layer 4, while trkA-IgG and trkC-IgG, which preferentially bind NGF and NT-3, respectively, had no effect. The autoradiographic labeling of LGN terminals in cortical layer 4 was reduced by trkB-IgG, in contrast with the increased labeling observed following NT-4/5 infusion. These data suggest that an endogenous ligand of trkB, normally present in limiting amounts within visual cortex, is necessary for the selective growth and remodeling of LGN axons into eye-specific patches.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1997XN39400007\n\nView details for PubMedID 9247264\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dendritic form of a cell may be established by many factors both intrinsic and environmental. Blockade of action potentials along the course of axons and in their postsynaptic targets dramatically alters the development of axonal morphology. The extent to which blockade of target cell activity retrogradely alters the dendritic morphology of the presynaptic cells is unknown. To determine whether the establishment of dendritic form by developing retinal ganglion cells depends on activity within their targets, the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), was administered via minipumps to the diencephalon of cat fetuses from embryonic day 43 (E43) to E57. At E57 retinae were removed and living retinal ganglion cells injected in vitro with Lucifer yellow to reveal their dendritic morphology. In the TTX-treated animals both alpha and beta types of retinal ganglion cells were present, as were putative gamma cells. Overall, the dendrites of retinal ganglion cells in TTX-treated animals appeared qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of untreated animals. The only significant change in the TTX-treated cases was a small increase in the number of dendritic spines on the non-beta cells. These results indicate that the acquisition of basic dendritic form of developing ganglion cells is not influenced by the action potential activity within their targets, and that it is also independent of the terminal branching patterns of their axons.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1997XJ33500016\n\nView details for PubMedID 9279005\n\nAbstract\n\nNeurotrophins play important roles in the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of CNS neurons. To begin to investigate specific roles for these factors in the mammalian visual system, we have examined the cellular localization of the neurotrophin receptor trkB within the developing cerebral cortex and thalamus of the ferret using extracellular domain-specific antibodies. At prenatal ages (gestation is 41 d), trkB-immunostained fibers were observed in the internal capsule and as two distinct fascicles within the intermediate zone of the cerebral cortex. The staining of these fiber tracts declined with increasing age, whereas soma and dendrite staining of cortical neurons was first evident in early postnatal life and increased during subsequent development. Staining of subplate neurons [by prenatal day 5 (P5)] was followed by staining of cortical layer 5 neurons (at P10). By P31, trkB immunoreactivity was particularly prominent in layers 3 and 5 but was absent from subplate neurons. Staining included cells, especially pyramidal neurons, in all cortical layers by P45, and this pattern was maintained into adulthood. The optic tract and fibers within the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were also strongly trkB immunoreactive at prenatal ages. Cellular staining of a subset of LGN neurons, those within the C-layers and perigeniculate nucleus, was apparent by P10 and maintained until P45, when the adult pattern of highly trkB-immunoreactive neurons in all layers of the LGN first appeared. The pattern of trkB immunoreactivity suggests that specific subsets of cortical and thalamic neurons may respond to neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and/or NT-4/5 at discrete developmental times and locations. The appearance of trkB on axon fibers early in development and then on cell bodies and dendritic processes later is consistent with roles for both long-range and local, including autocrine and/or paracrine, delivery of neurotrophins in cell survival and maturation.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1996VW94500018\n\nView details for PubMedID 8987824\n\nAbstract\n\nThe developing human cerebral cortex is distinguished by a particularly wide subplate, a transient zone in which crucial cell-cell interactions occur. To further understand the role of the subplate in human brain development, we have studied the immunohistochemical expression of certain neuronal (GAP-43, MAP-2, parvalbumin) and astroglial (vimentin, GFAP) markers in the developing visual cortex from gestational ages of 14 weeks to 9 months post-term. At 14-22 weeks, immunoreactivity to GAP-43, a protein involved in axonal outgrowth, was most prominent in the subplate and marginal zone neuropil and in the fibers of the radiations running near the ventricular zone; at 22-42 weeks, GAP-43 immunoreactive fibers were observed in the maturing cortical plate. Immunoreactivity for the microtubule-associated protein MAP-2 was present in the differentiating cortical plate at 14 weeks, but at 22-42 weeks was most prominent in the somata and dendrites of differentiated neurons, particularly the Cajal-Retzius neurons of the marginal zone, in neurons of the subplate and in those forming cortical layer 5. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity did not appear until 26 weeks, when stained neurons were in a sparse band of cells in layer 6 and upper subplate. Vimentin and GFAP did not stain differentiated neuronal cells. Vimentin immunoreactivity appeared early in neuroepithelial and radial glial cells, decreasing after 35 weeks, with a concomitant increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in radial glial and maturing astrocytic cells. Our results show that despite the greater complexity of the developing human neocortex, molecular markers are expressed in spatial and temporal patterns similar to those observed in non-human primates, carnivores and rodents. These protein markers should prove useful in developmental staging, and in providing a framework in which to examine congenital disorders of cerebral development.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1996VL76400006\n\nView details for PubMedID 8922336\n\nAbstract\n\nNeural connections in the adult central nervous system are highly precise. In the visual system, retinal ganglion cells send their axons to target neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in such a way that axons originating from the two eyes terminate in adjacent but nonoverlapping eye-specific layers. During development, however, inputs from the two eyes are intermixed, and the adult pattern emerges gradually as axons from the two eyes sort out to form the layers. Experiments indicate that the sorting-out process, even though it occurs in utero in higher mammals and always before vision, requires retinal ganglion cell signaling; blocking retinal ganglion cell action potentials with tetrodotoxin prevents the formation of the layers. These action potentials are endogenously generated by the ganglion cells, which fire spontaneously and synchronously with each other, generating \"waves\" of activity that travel across the retina. Calcium imaging of the retina shows that the ganglion cells undergo correlated calcium bursting to generate the waves and that amacrine cells also participate in the correlated activity patterns. Physiological recordings from LGN neurons in vitro indicate that the quasiperiodic activity generated by the retinal ganglion cells is transmitted across the synapse between ganglion cells to drive target LGN neurons. These observations suggest that (i) a neural circuit within the immature retina is responsible for generating specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity; (ii) spontaneous activity generated in the retina is propagated across central synapses; and (iii) even before the photoreceptors are present, nerve cell function is essential for correct wiring of the visual system during early development. Since spontaneously generated activity is known to be present elsewhere in the developing CNS, this process of activity-dependent wiring could be used throughout the nervous system to help refine early sets of neural connections into their highly precise adult patterns.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1996TR32600013\n\nView details for PubMedID 8570602\n\nAbstract\n\nNeural connections in the adult central nervous system are highly precise.

The initial processes of axonal pathfinding and target selection are not thought to require neural activity, whereas the later fine-tuning of connections into their final adult patterns does. We report an apparent exception to this rule in which action potential activity seems to be required very early in development for thalamic axons to form appropriate patterns of terminal arborizations with their ultimate target neurons in layer 4 of the cerebral cortex. Blockade of sodium action potentials during the 2-week fetal period when visual thalamic axons initially grow into the primary visual cortex in cats prevents the normally occurring branching of lateral geniculate nucleus axons within layer 4. This observation implies a role for action-potential activity in cerebral cortical development far earlier than previously suspected, weeks before eye-opening and the onset of the well-known process of activity-dependent reorganization of axonal terminal arbors that leads to the formation of ocular dominance columns.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1995TF89100087\n\nView details for PubMedID 7479973\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the adult mammalian retina, the principal direction of information flow is along a vertical pathway from photoreceptors to retinal interneurons to ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. We report here, however, that initially in development, at a time when the photoreceptors are not yet even present, there are already functionally defined networks within the retina. These networks are spontaneously active rather than visually driven, and they involve horizontal rather than vertical pathways. By means of optical recording using the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2, we have found that sets of retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells, a type of retinal interneuron, undergo synchronized oscillations in intracellular calcium concentration. These oscillations are highly correlated among subgroups of neighbouring cells, and spread in a wave-like fashion tangentially across the retina. Thus, in development of retinal circuitry, the initial patterning of neuronal function occurs in the horizontal domain before the adult pattern of vertical information transfer emerges.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1995QU30400048\n\nView details for PubMedID 7715725\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring the development of the visual system of higher mammals, axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) become segregated into eye-specific patches (the ocular dominance columns) within their target, layer 4 of the primary visual cortex. This occurs as a consequence of activity-dependent synaptic competition between axons representing the two eyes. The possibility that this competition could be mediated through neurotrophin-receptor interactions was tested. Infusion of neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into cat primary visual cortex inhibited column formation within the immediate vicinity of the infusion site but not elsewhere in the visual cortex. Infusion of nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), or vehicle solution did not affect column formation. These observations implicate TrkB, the common receptor for BDNF and NT-4/5, in the segregation of LGN axons into ocular dominance columns in layer 4. Moreover, they suggest that in addition to their better known roles in the prevention of cell death, neurotrophins may also mediate the activity-dependent control of axonal branching during development of the central nervous system.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1995QM39700042\n\nView details for PubMedID 7886458\n\nAbstract\n\nThalamic axons are known to accumulate in the subplate for a protracted period prior to invading the cortical plate and contacting their ultimate targets, the neurons of layer 4. We have examined the synaptic contacts made by visual and somatosensory thalamic axons during the transition period in which axons begin to leave the subplate and invade the cortical plate in the ferret. We first determined when geniculocortical axons leave the subplate and begin to grow into layer 4 of the visual cortex by injecting 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine (Dil) into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). By birth most LGN axons are still confined to the subplate. Over the next 10 days LGN axons grow into layer 4, but many axons retain axonal branches within the subplate. To establish whether thalamic axons make synaptic contacts within the subplate, the anterograde tracer PHA-L was injected into thalamic nuclei of neonatal ferrets between postnatal day 3 and 12 to label thalamic axons at the electron microscope level. The analysis of the PHA-L injections confirmed the Dil data regarding the timing of ingrowth of thalamic axons into the cortical plate. At the electron microscope level, PHA-L-labelled axons were found to form synaptic contacts in the subplate. The thalamic axon terminals were presynaptic primarily to dendritic shafts and dendritic spines. Between postnatal days 12 and 20 labelled synapses were also observed within layer 4 of the cortex. The ultrastructural appearance of the synapses did not differ significantly in the subplate and cortical plate, with regard to type of postsynaptic profiles, length of postsynaptic density or presynaptic terminal size. These observations provide direct evidence that thalamocortical axons make synaptic contacts with subplate neurons, the only cell type within the subplate possessing mature dendrites and dendritic spines; they also suggest that functional interactions between thalamic axons and subplate neurons could play a role in the establishment of appropriate thalamocortical connections.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994PR42300010\n\nView details for PubMedID 7874312\n\nAbstract\n\nTo identify mechanisms that regulate neuronal form in the mammalian CNS, we have examined dendritic development in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during the period of segregation of retinal ganglion cell axons. The tracer Dil was used to label retrogradely LGN neurons that send their axons to primary visual cortex at different ages between embryonic day 36 (E36) and E60 in the cat. LGN neurons grow extensively during this period, in concert with the progressive restriction of ganglion cell axons from the two eyes to their appropriate eye-specific layers. At E36 neurons have simple bipolar morphology; by E60 all have acquired complex multipolar dendritic trees. During this period, soma size increases by 190% and total dendritic length increases 240%. Dendritic complexity, as measured by dendritic branch points, also increases. As dendrites grow, the number of spines increases, but their density remains constant at 0.015/micron throughout this period. Since it is known that blockade of action potential activity significantly alters the branching pattern and extent of retinal ganglion cell axonal arbors within the LGN, we also investigated whether the dendritic development of the postsynaptic LGN neurons is similarly susceptible. Following 2 weeks of the intracranial minipump infusion of TTX between E42 and E56, the morphology of LGN neurons was examined. Surprisingly in view of the striking effect of the treatment on the morphology of retinal ganglion cell axons, dendritic growth and development were essentially normal. However, the density of dendritic spines increased almost threefold, suggesting that this specific feature of dendritic morphology is highly regulated by action potential activity. These observations indicate that normally during this period of development, the previously described changes that occur in the morphology of the presynaptic inputs to LGN neurons are accompanied by a progressive growth of post-synaptic dendrites. Because the intracranial TTX infusions have almost certainly blocked all sodium action potentials, our results suggest that the basic dendritic framework of LGN neurons can be achieved even in the absence of this form of neural activity. Moreover, since the same treatment causes a profound change in the morphology of the presynaptic axons, at least some aspects of axonal and dendritic form must be controlled independently during this prenatal period of development.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994NR13800016\n\nView details for PubMedID 8207474\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring the first 3 weeks of postnatal development in the ferret retina, cells in the ganglion cell layer spontaneously generate waves of electrical activity that travel across the retina in the absence of mature photoreceptors (Meister et al., 1991; Wong et al., 1993). Since few chemical synapses are present at the earliest stages when waves are present, we have explored whether gap junctions could act to correlate the activity of cells in the immature ganglion cell layer. Retinal ganglion cells in a living in vitro preparation from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P45 were intracellularly injected with the tracer Neurobiotin and the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow, molecules that are known to pass through gap junctions. Lucifer yellow consistently filled only the injected cell, whereas Neurobiotin filled not only the injected cell but also passed to a constellation of neighboring cells. Coupling revealed by Neurobiotin is seen as early as P1, but, at this stage, it was not possible to identify the various morphological types of cells that were coupled. Thereafter, alpha ganglion cells showed homologous coupling to other alpha cells and to both conventionally placed and displaced amacrine cells. Likewise, gamma ganglion cells appeared coupled to other gamma cells and to amacrine cells. However, beta ganglion cells never showed tracer coupling in the neonatal or in adult retinas. The percentage of alpha and gamma cells that were coupled to other cells increased progressively with age. By the end of the third postnatal week, the pattern of Neurobiotin coupling in the ferret retina was adult-like, with virtually every injected alpha cell showing tracer coupling. Our observations suggest that intercellular junctions able to pass Neurobiotin are present in the inner plexiform layer during the period when the firing of retinal ganglion cells is highly correlated. Such junctions could contribute to synchronization of the activity of subsets of neighboring ganglion cells during development, but it cannot be the sole mediator of this activity because beta cells, which also participate in the correlated activity, showed no coupling at any stage. In addition, the continued presence of coupling in the adult retina implies that other changes in retinal circuitry are likely to contribute to the disappearance of the waves.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994NR13800033\n\nView details for PubMedID 8207489\n\nAbstract\n\nTo investigate the cellular interactions within the mammalian visual cortex that are important in ocular dominance column formation, we have examined the role of subplate neurons in this process. LGN axons segregate in layer 4 of the cat's visual cortex between the third and sixth postnatal weeks to give rise to the adult pattern of ocular dominance columns. Subplate neurons are a transient population of neurons that sit in the white matter but have extensive projections into the overlying cortex, particularly layer 4, during neonatal life. Many subplate neurons are present at birth, but most are gone by the end of the period of LGN axon segregation. To examine whether these neurons are required for the segregation of LGN axons, we deleted them by intracortical injections of kainic acid either just after LGN axons had grown into layer 4 (first postnatal week) or later, just before the onset of segregation (third postnatal week). The consequences for the patterning of geniculocortical terminals were evaluated by transneuronal transport of 3H-proline injected into one eye at times when segregation would normally be complete. Following deletion of subplate neurons at either age, LGN axons failed to segregate into ocular dominance columns. Following the late deletions only, geniculocortical axons lost their laminar restriction to layer 4 and projected to layers 2 and 3 as well. Deletion of subplate neurons also resulted in long-term changes in the cytoarchitecture of layer 4. These observations suggest that the interactions that mediate segregation of LGN axons within layer 4 of visual cortex are susceptible to influences from subplate neurons. Although the mechanisms by which subplate neurons exert their effect are not yet clear, these experiments strongly suggest that interactions between LGN axons and layer 4 neurons are not sufficient for column formation, and that subplate neurons most likely play a critical role in interactions leading to ocular segregation.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994NR13800038\n\nView details for PubMedID 8207493\n\nAbstract\n\nThe adult cerebral cortex extends axons to a variety of subcortical targets, including the thalamus and superior colliculus. These descending projections are pioneered during development by the axons of a transient population of subplate neurons (McConnell et al., 1989). We show here that the descending axons of cortical plate neurons appear to be delayed significantly in their outgrowth, compared with those of subplate neurons. To assess the possible role of subplate neurons in the formation of these pathways, subplate neurons were ablated during the embryonic period. In all cases, an axon pathway formed from visual cortex through the internal capsule and into the thalamus. In half of all cases, however, cortical axons failed to invade their normal subcortical targets. In the other half, targets were innervated normally. Subplate neurons are therefore likely to provide important cues that aid the process by which cortical axons grow toward, select, and invade their subcortical targets.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994NF02600002\n\nView details for PubMedID 7512631\n\nAbstract\n\nCell division, cell death, and remodeling of connections are major features of the construction of the mammalian CNS. We have begun to address the role of neurotrophins in these events through characterization of the expression of their receptors in the developing ferret visual system. By use of chemical cross-linking of iodinated neurotrophins, proteins corresponding to trkB, trkC, and p75 were identified as receptors for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) throughout development. BDNF was also cross-linked to a truncated form of trkB that lacks the tyrosine kinase domain (trkB. T1) in retinal target tissues and in cortex. At the earliest developmental age examined (E24), the ratio of full-length to truncated trkB is > > 1 in the retinal target tissues, LGN and superior colliculus. During the ensuing period of retinal ganglion cell death and segregation into eye-specific layers, the amount of truncated trkB increases markedly relative to full-length trkB. By P27, truncated trkB is the predominant receptor for BDNF in the retinal target tissues and this pattern is maintained into adulthood. Within all subdivisions of visual cortex including the ventricular zone (VZ), intermediate zone (IZ), and cortical plate (CP), similar profiles of bands are observed. The developmental increase in abundance of truncated trkB relative to full-length occurs earliest in the VZ, with a major increase between E30 and P3. In the IZ, this shift to a predominance of truncated trkB occurs between P15 and P30, while in the CP the shift is even further delayed, not occurring until after P30. Within each subdivision of cortex, the shift to a predominance of truncated trkB occurs at times that correlate with the onset of cell death and maturation of axonal connections. This study demonstrates that members of the trk family, previously identified in the CNS on the basis of mRNA transcripts, are present as receptors with specific binding affinities for BDNF and NT-3. Moreover, the correspondence between the developmental shift from full-length to truncated trkB and the critical periods for cell fate determination, cell death, and axonal remodeling suggests an important role for neurotrophic factors in the development of the visual system.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994MZ40700037\n\nView details for PubMedID 8126572\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring cerebral cortical development, ingrowing axons from different thalamic nuclei select and invade their cortical targets. The selection of an appropriate target is first evident even before thalamic axons grow into the cortical plate: initially axons accumulate and wait below their cortical target area in a zone called the subplate. This zone also contains the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex, the subplate neurons. Here we have investigated whether subplate neurons are involved in the process of target selection by thalamic axons by ablating them from specific cortical regions at the onset of the waiting period and examining the subsequent thalamocortical axon projection patterns. Subplate neurons were ablated at the onset of the waiting period by intracortical injections of kainic acid. The effect of the ablation on the thalamocortical projection from visual thalamus was examined by DiI-labeling of the LGN days to weeks following the lesion. At two to four weeks post-lesion, times when LGN axons would have normally invaded the cortical plate, the axons remained below the cortical plate and grew past their appropriate cortical target in an anomalous pathway. Moreover, examination of LGN axons at one week post-lesion, a time when they would normally be waiting and branching within the visual subplate, indicated that the axons had already grown past their correct destination. These observations suggest that visual subplate neurons are involved in the process by which LGN axons select and subsequently grow into visual cortex. In contrast, subplate neurons do not appear to play a major role in the initial morphological development of the LGN itself. Subplate ablations did not alter dendritic growth or shapes of LGN projection neurons during the period under study, nor did it prevent the segregation of retinal ganglion cell axons into eye-specific layers. However, the overall size of the LGN was reduced, suggesting that there may be increased cell death of LGN neurons in the absence of subplate neurons. To examine whether subplate neurons beneath other neocortical areas play a similar role in the formation of thalamocortical connections, subplate neurons were deleted beneath auditory cortex at the onset of the waiting period for auditory thalamic axons. Subsequent DiI labeling revealed that in these animals the majority of MGN axons had grown past auditory cortex instead of innervating it. Taken together these observations underscore a general requirement for subplate neurons throughout neocortex in the process of cortical target selection and ingrowth by thalamic axons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1993KY54800018\n\nView details for PubMedID 8325233\n\nAbstract\n\nThe synaptic organization of identified retinogeniculate axons was studied during the prenatal development of eye-specific layers in the LGN of the cat. During this period, retinogeniculate axons undergo stereotyped morphological changes. Retinogeniculate axons originating from one eye and passing through LGN territory destined to be solely innervated by the other eye (inappropriate territory) initially give rise to many side branches. As the eye-specific layers emerge, these axons elaborate extensive terminal arbors within territory appropriate to their eye of origin and concurrently retract their side branches from inappropriate territory (Sretavan and Shatz, 1986). These transient side branches may therefore represent a morphological substrate for the observed functional convergence of inputs from the two eyes onto common LGN neurons during prenatal development (Shatz and Kirkwood, 1984). This possibility was investigated by examining whether identified axons and their side branches form synapses in inappropriate territory. Three retinogeniculate axons from two fetuses aged embryonic day 53 (E53) and E57 were filled with HRP in an in vitro preparation, prior to being processed for electron microscopy (EM). The HRP-filled axons, originating from the contralateral eye, were first reconstructed at the light microscope level. The portion of axon passing through the center of ipsilaterally innervated layer A1 was then serially sectioned and reconstructed by EM. Two sets of 450 serial EM sections revealed that all three contralateral axons established synaptic contacts in ipsilateral territory. Many of these synapses were made by side branches and a few were even formed by the main axon trunks. Both side branches and trunks formed mainly en passant asymmetrical contacts that were associated with spherical synaptic vesicles and that were apposed to immature dendritic elements and dendritic shafts. For comparison, a portion of the same E53 axon within the future contralateral layer A was also serially sectioned and reconstructed for EM. Within this contralateral zone, the E53 axon formed synaptic contacts similar to those established in the ipsilateral region, except that in the appropriate zone they contained significantly more synaptic vesicles. These results demonstrate that axons from the contralateral eye can establish synapses in territory simultaneously innervated by the ipsilateral eye, both via side branches and by means of contacts along the main axon trunk. Thus, the development of eye-specific layers is accompanied by the formation and subsequent elimination of synapses that almost certainly represent a morphological substrate for the known transient functional convergence of inputs from the two eyes.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1992HT83700027\n\nView details for PubMedID 1578274\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dendrites of ganglion cells in the mammalian retina become extensively remodelled during synapse formation in the inner plexiform layer. In particular, after birth in the cat, many short spiny protrusions are lost from the dendrites of ganglion cells during the time when ribbon, presumably bipolar, synapses appear in the inner plexiform layer and when conventional, presumed amacrine, synapses increase significantly in number. It has therefore been postulated that these transient spines may be the initial or preferred substrates for competitive interactions between amacrine or bipolar cell terminals that subsequently result in the formation of appropriate synapses onto the ganglion cells. If so, the majority of synapses made onto developing ganglion cells should be found on these dendritic spines. To test this hypothesis, we determined the synaptic connectivity of identified ganglion cells in the postnatal cat retina during the period of peak spine loss and synapse formation. The dendritic trees of ganglion cells were intracellularly filled with Lucifer yellow that was subsequently photo-oxidized into an electron-dense product suitable for electron microscopy. In serial reconstructions of the dendrites of a postnatal day 11 (P11) alpha ganglion cell and a P14 beta ganglion cell, conventional and ribbon synapses were found predominantly on dendritic shafts. Only three out of a total of 341 dendritic spines from the two cells received direct presynaptic input, all of which were conventional synapses. Thus, our observations suggest that the transient dendritic spines are not the preferred postsynaptic sites as previously suspected. However, it is possible that these structures play a different role in synaptogenesis, such as mediating interactions between retinal neurons that may lead to cell - cell recognition, a necessary step prior to synapse formation at the appropriate target sites (Cooper and Smith, Soc. Neurosci. Abstr., 14, 893, 1988).\n\nView details for PubMedID 12106402\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring development of the mammalian cerebral cortex, thalamic axons must grow into the telencephalon and select appropriate cortical targets. In order to begin to understand the cellular interactions that are important in cortical target selection by thalamic axons, we have examined the morphology of axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as they navigate their way to the primary visual cortex. The morphology of geniculocortical axons was revealed by placing the lipophilic tracer Dil into the LGN of paraformaldehyde-fixed brains from fetal and neonatal cats between embryonic day 26 (E26; gestation is 65 d) and postnatal day 7 (P7). This morphological approach has led to three major observations. (1) As LGN axons grow within the intermediate zone of the telencephalon toward future visual cortex (E30-40), many give off distinct interstitial axon collaterals that penetrate the subplate of nonvisual cortical areas. These collaterals are transient and are not seen postnatally. (2) There is a prolonged period during which LGN axons are restricted to the visual subplate prior to their ingrowth into the cortical plate; the first LGN axons arrive within visual subplate by E36 but are not detected in layer 6 of visual cortex until about E50. (3) Within the visual subplate, LGN axons extend widespread terminal branches. This represents a marked change in their morphology from the simple growth cones present earlier as LGN axons navigate en route to visual cortex. The presence of interstitial collaterals suggests that there may be ongoing interactions between LGN axons and subplate neurons along the entire intracortical route traversed by the axons. From the extensive branching of LGN axons within the visual subplate during the waiting period, it appears that they are not simply \"waiting.\" Rather, LGN axons may participate in dynamic cellular interactions within the subplate long before they contact their ultimate target neurons in layer 4. These observations confirm the existence of a prolonged waiting period in the development of thalamocortical connections and provide important morphological evidence in support of the previous suggestion that interactions between thalamic axons and subplate neurons are necessary for cortical target selection.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1992HA64400004\n\nView details for PubMedID 1729444\n\nAbstract\n\n1. The development of excitatory activation in the visual cortex was studied in fetal and neonatal cats. During fetal and neonatal life, the immature cerebral cortex (the cortical plate) is sandwiched between two synaptic zones: the marginal zone above, and an area just below the cortical plate, the subplate. The subplate is transient and disappears by approximately 2 mo postnatal. Here we have investigated whether the subplate and the cortical plate receive functional synaptic inputs in the fetus, and when the adultlike pattern of excitatory synaptic input to the cortical plate appears during development. 2. Extracellular field potential recording to electrical stimulation of the optic radiation was performed in slices of cerebral cortex maintained in vitro. Laminar profiles of field potentials were converted by the current-source density (CSD) method to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of neuronal excitation within the subplate and the cortical plate. 3. Between embryonic day 47 (E47) and postnatal day 28 (P28; birth, E65), age-related changes occur in the pattern of synaptic activation of neurons in the cortical plate and the subplate. Early in development, at E47, E57, and P0, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation is most obvious in the subplate, and longer latency (presumably polysynaptic) excitation can be seen in the cortical plate. Synaptic excitation in the subplate is no longer apparent at P21 and P28, a time when cell migration is finally complete and the cortical layers have formed. By contrast, excitation in the cortical plate is prominent in postnatal animals, and the temporal and spatial pattern has changed. 4. The adultlike sequence of synaptic activation in the different cortical layers can be seen by P28. It differs from earlier ages in several respects. First, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation can be detected in cortical layer 4. Second, multisynaptic, long-lasting activation is present in layers 2/3 and 5. 5. Our results show that the subplate zone, known from anatomic studies to be a synaptic neurophil during development, receives functional excitatory inputs from axons that course in the developing white matter. Because the only mature neurons present in this zone are the subplate neurons, we conclude that subplate neurons are the principal, if not the exclusive, recipients of this input. The results suggest further that the excitation in the subplate in turn is relayed to neurons of the cortical plate via axon collaterals of subplate neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1991GW56400024\n\nView details for PubMedID 1812236\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dendrites of ganglion cells in the retina have an excess number of spines and branches that are normally lost during the first postnatal month of development. We investigated whether this dendritic remodeling can be prevented when the action potential activity of ganglion cells is abolished by chronic intraocular injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) during the first 4 or 5 postnatal weeks in the cat. Dendritic tree morphologies of alpha and beta ganglion cells from TTX-treated, non-TTX-treated (contralateral eye), and normal control retinae were compared after intracellular filling with Lucifer yellow. Qualitative observations and quantitative measurements indicate that TTX treatment does not prevent the normally occurring loss of spines and dendritic branches. Indeed, the dendritic trees of both alpha and beta cells in TTX injected eyes actually have even fewer spines and branches than normal cells at equivalent ages. However, because the total dendritic lengths of these cells are also reduced after TTX blockade, spine density is indistinguishable from untreated animals at the same age. In addition, although dendritic field areas are not altered with treatment, the complexity of the dendritic trees is reduced. These observations suggest that dendritic remodeling can occur in the absence of ganglion cell action potential activity. Thus, the factors that influence the dendritic and axonal development of retinal ganglion cells must differ, because similar TTX treatment during the period of axonal remodeling does have profound effects on the final pattern of terminal arborizations.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1991GH71100003\n\nView details for PubMedID 1662709\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the developing nervous systems of both invertebrates and vertebrates, neurons must develop precise sets of axonal connections. One strategy used by both orders of animals is to generate a special class of neurons whose axons \"pioneer\" the first pathways between these cells and their targets. In the developing mammalian telencephalon, the subplate neurons (which are among the first neurons to be generated in development) extend axons to long-distance subcortical targets before the neurons of the deep cortical layers 5 and 6 have been generated. The axons of layer 5 and 6 neurons later follow a similar pathway to form permanent subcortical projections to the thalamus and tectum, and thereafter the vast majority of subplate neurons die. These results have generated the hypothesis that subplate axons may actually be required for the axons of layer 5 and 6 neurons to innervate their appropriate subcortical targets. The complexity of growth cones has previously been correlated with axonal decision making: differences in growth cone morphologies have been noted in comparisons of leading versus following axons (LoPresti, Macagno, and Levinthal, 1973; Nordlander, 1987; Yaginuma, Homma, Kunzi, and Oppenheim, 1991), and at choice points along axon pathways (Raper, Bastiani, and Goodman, 1983; Tosney and Landmesser, 1985; Caudy and Bentley, 1986a,b; Bovolenta and Mason, 1987; Holt, 1989; Bovolenta and Dodd, 1990; Yaginuma et al., 1991). Thus, as a first step toward addressing the question of whether the axons of deep-layer neurons simply follow subplate axons to their targets, we have studied the morphology of cortical growth cones at various points along the corticothalamic pathway and at different stages of development. We examined the brains of fetal ferrets and cats at ages ranging from embryonic days (E) 24 to E50, using the fluorescent lipophilic tracer 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) to reveal the axons and growth cones of cortical neurons. Growth cones were drawn, and quantitative measurements of their complexity were made by counting filopodia and calculating their surface area. No morphological differences were found among growth cones at different points along the corticothalamic pathway at a given age. However, growth cones belonging to early-generated cells (likely to be subplate neurons) are significantly larger and more complex than are the growth cones of later-generated cortical neurons. This evidence is consistent with the suggestion that subplate growth cones actively pioneer the corticothalamic pathway, and that the axons of layer 5 and 6 neurons follow it.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1991GB72100007\n\nView details for PubMedID 1919567\n\nAbstract\n\nThe development of orderly connections in the mammalian visual system depends on action potentials in the optic nerve fibers, even before the retina receives visual input. In particular, it has been suggested that correlated firing of retinal ganglion cells in the same eye directs the segregation of their synaptic terminals into eye-specific layers within the lateral geniculate nucleus. Such correlations in electrical activity were found by simultaneous recording of the extracellular action potentials of up to 100 ganglion cells in the isolated retina of the newborn ferret and the fetal cat. These neurons fired spikes in nearly synchronous bursts lasting a few seconds and separated by 1 to 2 minutes of silence. Individual bursts consisted of a wave of excitation, several hundred micrometers wide, sweeping across the retina at about 100 micrometers per second. These concerted firing patterns have the appropriate spatial and temporal properties to guide the refinement of connections between the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1991FM04000028\n\nView details for PubMedID 2035024\n\nAbstract\n\nThe neurons of layer 4 in the adult cerebral cortex receive their major ascending inputs from the thalamus. In development, however, thalamic axons arrive at the appropriate cortical area long before their target layer 4 neurons have migrated into the cortical plate. The axons accumulate and wait in the zone below the cortical plate, the subplate, for several weeks before invading the cortical plate. The subplate is a transient zone that contains the first postmitotic neurons of the telencephalon. These neurons mature well before other cortical neurons, and disappear by cell death after the thalamic axons have grown into the overlying cortical plate. The close proximity of growing thalamocortical axons and subplate neurons suggests that they might be involved in interactions important for normal thalamocortical development. Here we show that early in development the deletion of subplate neurons located beneath visual cortex prevents axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus from recognizing and innervating visual cortex, their normal target. In the absence of subplate neurons, lateral geniculate nucleus axons continue to grow in the white matter past visual cortex despite the presence of their target layer 4 neurons. Thus the transient subplate neurons are necessary for appropriate cortical target selection by thalamocortical axons.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990DY35200061\n\nView details for PubMedID 2395469\n\nAbstract\n\nAmong the first postmitotic cells of the cerebral cortex is a special population located below the cortical plate: the subplate neurons. These neurons reach a high degree of morphological maturity during fetal life, well before the neurons of the cortical layers have matured, yet nearly all of these cells die after birth in the cat. Subplate neurons are also known to receive synaptic contacts. Here we have investigated whether these contacts are functional by making intracellular recordings from subplate neurons in cortical slices maintained in vitro. Subplate neurons were identified based on their location and morphology by injecting them with biocytin following the intracellular recordings. At all ages studied between embryonic day 50 and postnatal day 9, electrical stimulation of the optic radiations elicited EPSPs and synaptic and antidromic spikes in subplate neurons, indicating that some of the synapses seen at the ultrastructural level are indeed capable of synaptic transmission. The spiking patterns of 39 morphologically identified subplate neurons were examined by injecting depolarizing current, which revealed that a large majority gave only a single spike or a brief train of spikes in response to maintained depolarization, in contrast to the regular spiking pattern found in many neurons of adult cortex. Biocytin injections into subplate neurons revealed that they are a morphologically heterogeneous population with respect to their dendritic branching patterns; roughly half were inverted pyramids, the classic subplate neuron morphology. The axonal processes of subplate neurons were remarkable in that many not only arborized within the subplate, but also entered the cortical plate and terminated in the marginal zone. At early postnatal ages, these axons also gave off collaterals within cortical layer 4. The results of this study indicate that subplate neurons participate in synaptic microcircuits during development. While the presynaptic identity of the input to subplate neurons is not known conclusively, it is likely that geniculocortical axons, which wait in close proximity to subplate neurons, contribute significantly. The pattern of axonal branching of subplate neurons also implies that information conferred to subplate neurons may be relayed, in turn, to the neurons of cortical layer 4. Finally with the death of subplate neurons, the geniculocortical axons leave the subplate and invade the cortical plate to innervate directly the neurons of layer 4. Thus, subplate neurons may function as a crucial, but transient synaptic link between waiting geniculocortical axons and their ultimate target cells in the cortex.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990DW22100009\n\nView details for PubMedID 2388080\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the mammalian visual system, retinal ganglion cell axons terminate within the LGN in a series of alternating eye-specific layers. These layers are not present initially during development. In the cat they emerge secondarily following a prenatal period in which originally intermixed inputs from the two eyes gradually segregate from each other to give rise to the characteristic set of layers by birth. Many lines of evidence suggest that activity-dependent competitive interactions between ganglion cell axons from the two eyes for LGN neurons play an important role in the final patterning of retinogeniculate connections. Studies of the branching patterns of individual ganglion cell axons suggest that during the period when inputs from the two eyes are intermixed, axons from one eye send side branches into territory later occupied exclusively by axons from the other eye. Ultrastructural studies indicate that these branches in fact are sites of synaptic contacts, which are later eliminated since the side branches disappear as axons form their mature terminal arbors in appropriate territory. In vitro microelectrode recordings from LGN neurons indicate that they can receive convergent synaptic excitation from electrical stimulation of the optic nerves before but not after the eye-specific layers form, suggesting that at least some of the synaptic contacts seen at the ultrastructural level are functional. Finally, experiments in which tetrodotoxin was infused intracranially during the two week period during which the eye-specific layers normally form demonstrate that it is possible to prevent, or at least delay, the formation of the layers. Accordingly, individual axons fail to develop their restricted terminal arbor branching pattern and instead branch widely throughout the LGN. These results indicate that all of the machinery necessary for synaptic function and competition is present during fetal life. Moreover, it is highly likely that neuronal activity is required for the formation of the eye-specific layers. If so, then activity would have to be present in the form of spontaneously generated action potentials, since vision is not possible at these early ages. Thus, the functioning of the retinogeniculate system many weeks before it is put to the use for which it is ultimately designed may contribute to the final patterning of connections present in the adult.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990CQ75500012\n\nView details for PubMedID 2181063\n\nAbstract\n\nNerve growth factor and its receptor (NGFR) are known to be present in diverse embryonic and neonatal central nervous system tissues, including the cerebral cortex. However, the identity of the cortical cells expressing NGFR immunoreactivity has not been established. We have used immunolabeling coupled with [3H]thymidine autoradiography to identify such cells in ferret and cat brain. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a conserved amino acid sequence of the NGFR were used for this purpose. Western (immunologic) blot analyses show that these antibodies specifically recognize NGFR and precursor proteins. In both species, NGFR immunoreactivity is primarily associated with the early generated and transient subplate neuron population of the developing neocortex, as indicated by the following evidence: the immunoreactive cells (i) are located directly beneath the developing cortical plate, (ii) frequently have the inverted pyramid shape characteristic of subplate neurons, and (iii) can be labeled by an injection of [3H]thymidine on embryonic day (E) 28, a time when only subplate neurons are being generated. Intense NGFR immunostaining is seen on the cell bodies of these neurons as early as E30, several days after their last round of cell division, and this immunostaining remains strong for approximately 3 weeks. The NGFR immunoreactivity begins to decline around E52 and has disappeared from the region altogether by E60, at which time subplate neurons begin to die. The cellular localization and timing of expression suggest that the NGFR may play a role in the maintenance of subplate neurons and in the maturation of the cerebral cortex.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990CH19000040\n\nView details for PubMedID 2153287\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the developing vertebrate nervous system, cell death is known to play an important role in determining final neuron number. Retinal ganglion cells in the cat's visual system undergo a massive elimination by cell death during the prenatal period between E44 (age of embryo in days) and birth (= E65). We have examined whether neural activity contributes to ganglion cell death by infusing tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. TTX was infused intracranially via osmotic minipumps implanted in utero at E42. The effects of the TTX treatment on ganglion cell death and optic nerve ultrastructure were examined at either E49 or E57 by electron microscopy and quantitative analysis of optic axon number. The numbers of optic nerve axons counted in the optic nerves of animals after either 1 or 2 weeks of TTX treatment were not significantly different from the counts in normal animals at comparable ages: E49 TTX-3.2 x 105; E48 normal-3.3 x 105; E57 TTX-2.1 x 105; E59 normal-2.4 x 105. These results suggest that retinal ganglion cells cannot be rescued from death by blockade of neural activity central to the optic chiasma. However, the ultrastructure of optic nerves following 2 weeks of TTX infusion was quite abnormal. The usual packaging of axons into fascicles by glia was disrupted by the presence of many pale, organelle-poor processes that were about 10 times larger in their cross-sectional areas than axons in either normal or TTX-treated nerves. Examination of these processes in serial transverse or in longitudinal electron microscope (EM) sections of the nerve revealed that they were most likely glial in origin. The ultrastructural organization of the optic nerve following 1 week of TTX treatment was normal, indicating that this effect on glial ultrastructure is either cumulative or delayed in onset. These results suggest that while the conduction of action potentials to the terminals of retinogeniculate axons may not play a significant role in regulating ganglion cell number prenatally, it may affect the normal maturation of optic nerve glia.\n\nView details for PubMedID 12106051\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring development, the earliest generated neurons of the mammalian telencephalon reside in a region of the white matter, the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Neurons in the subplate are only transiently present in the telencephalon: shortly after birth in the cat the majority have disappeared. During their brief life, however, subplate neurons mature; they extend long-distance and local projections, and express immunoreactivity for GABA and several neuropeptides. In the present study we examined the relation between possible transmitter phenotypes of subplate neurons and their connectivity. To do so, we used a double-label technique in which immunohistochemistry for neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SRIF) or calbindin (CaBP) was combined with retrograde tracing. Experiments were performed in neonatal cats and in ferret kits at equivalent postconceptional ages, times when subplate neurons are numerous. Subplate neurons immunoreactive for neuropeptides and CaBP could be double-labelled by an injection of retrograde tracer either into the cortical plate or the white matter, indicating that this particular subset of subplate neurons can make local circuit projections. In contrast, peptide or CaBP immunoreactive subplate neurons could never be retrogradely labelled from a tracer injection into the thalamus. Taken together, these observations indicate that subplate neurons immunoreactive for NPY, SRIF and CaBP are likely to be interneurons exclusively. On the other hand, subplate neurons with long-distance projections to the thalamus or the contralateral hemisphere could be labelled by the retrograde transport of d-[3H]aspartate, suggesting that at least some projection subplate neurons might use an excitatory amino acid as a neurotransmitter. These results indicate that there is a defined relationship between the putative transmitter phenotypes of subplate neurons and their patterns of projection. Interneurons of the subplate express peptidergic properties while projection neurons to the thalamus may use an excitatory amino acid. Thus, these basic organizational features of the transient subplate are reminiscent of those found in the adult cortical layers.\n\nView details for PubMedID 12106275\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring the development of the nervous system, growing axons must traverse considerable distances to find their targets. In insects, this problem is solved in part by pioneer neurons, which lay down the first axonal pathways when distances are at a minimum. Here the existence of a similar kind of neuron in the developing mammalian telencephalon is described. These are the subplate cells, the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex. Axons from subplate neurons traverse the internal capsule and invade the thalamus early in fetal life, even before the neurons of cortical layers 5 and 6, which will form the adult subcortical projections, are generated. During postnatal life, after the adult pattern of axonal projections is firmly established, most subplate neurons disappear. These observations raise the possibility that the early axonal scaffold formed by subplate cells may prove essential for the establishment of permanent subcortical projections.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1989AM93300029\n\nView details for PubMedID 2475909\n\nAbstract\n\nThe earliest-generated neurons of the cat cerebral cortex have been studied here during development using a combination of 3H-thymidine birthdating with immunohistochemistry for the neuron-specific protein MAP2 or for several neuropeptides/transmitters.
