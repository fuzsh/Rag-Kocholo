        "text": "Learning Objectives\n\nDescribe how enzymes in body fluids provide protection against infection or disease\n\nList and describe the function of antimicrobial peptides, complement components, cytokines, and acute-phase proteins\n\nDescribe similarities and differences among classic, alternate, and lectin complement pathways\n\nIn addition to physical defenses, the innate nonspecific immune system uses a number of chemical mediators that inhibit microbial invaders. The term “chemical mediators” encompasses a wide array of substances found in various body fluids and tissues throughout the body. Chemical mediators may work alone or in conjunction with each other to inhibit microbial colonization and infection.\n\nSome chemical mediators are endogenously produced, meaning they are produced by human body cells; others are produced exogenously, meaning that they are produced by certain microbes that are part of the microbiome. Some mediators are produced continually, bathing the area in the antimicrobial substance; others are produced or activated primarily in response to some stimulus, such as the presence of microbes."
