        "meta_description": "Murine brain is an excellent tool for studying protein expression and brain function in mammals. Although mice are an extensively used model to recapitulate various pathological conditions, the proteome of the normal mouse brain has not been yet reported. In the present study, we identified the total proteins of different parts of the brain of CB7BL/6 mice, a widely used strain, by applying proteomic methodologies. The adult mouse brain was dissected anatomically into the following regions: frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum, hypothalamus and medulla. Total protein extracts of these regions were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, following in-gel digestion with trypsin. Protein identification was carried out by peptide mass fingerprint. Thus, 515 different single-gene products were identified in total, 54 expressed specifically in the olfactory bulb, 62 in the hippocampus, 36 in the frontal cortex, five in the cerebellum, nine in the midbrain, eight in the hypothamamus and 10 in the medulla. The majority of the proteins were enzymes, structural proteins and transporters. Moreover, the distribution of these molecules appears to exhibit direct correlation with the function of the brain regions where they were expressed. This study leads to the complete characterization of the normal mouse brain proteome as well as the protein expression profile of the different brain regions. These results will aid in addressing unmet scientific needs regarding physiological and pathological brain functions.",

        "text": "Materials and Methods\n\nMaterials and reagents. Immobilized pH-gradient (IPG) strips and IPG buffers were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA). Acrylamide/piperazine-di-acrylamide (PDA) solution (37.5:1 w/v) was purchased from Biosolve Ltd (Valkenswaard, the Netherlands) and the other reagents for the polyacrylamide gel preparation from Bio-Rad. 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany), urea from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany), thiourea from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 1,4-dithioerythritol (DTE) and EDTA from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All reagents were kept at 4°C, apart from CHAPS, which was kept at 23°C.\n\nExperimental animal model. Eight C57BL/6N inbred mice 12 weeks old, weighing approximately 25 g each, were used in this experiment. All the experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Athens, Faculty of Biology and the local competent authority based on European Directive 86/609 on the Protection of Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The animals were sacrificed, and their brains were anatomically separated into seven distinctive parts: cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum, hypothalamus and medulla. The brain parts were kept at -80°C (9).\n\nTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The brain parts were homogenized in a Wheaton Glass Tissue Grinder containing 250 μl of urea buffer consisting of 0.5 M Tris-Hcl, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 0.4% DTE and a mixture of protease inhibitors [1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 tablet Complete™ (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) per 50 ml of suspension buffer] and phosphate inhibitors (0.2 mM Na2VO3 and 1 mM NaF). The cells were lysed by sonication at three times for 60 s in 35% amplification and the suspension was centrifuged at 13000 × g for 30 min at 4°C The protein content in the supernatant was determined by applying the Bradford method (10) using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories).\n\n2-D Gel electrophoresis was performed as previously reported (11). Samples of 1.0 mg total protein were applied on immobilized 3-10 pI and 4-7 pI non-linear gradient strips (17 cm) at their basic and acidic ends. Focusing started at 250 V for 30 min and the voltage was gradually increased to 5000 V at 3 V/min and remained constant for an additional 16 h.\n\nThe second-dimensional separation was performed in 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (180×200×1.5 mm), running at 40 mA per gel in a PROTEAN apparatus (Bio-Rad). After fixation with 50% methanol containing 10% acetic acid for 2 h, the gels were stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie blue (Novex, San Diego, CA, USA), washed twice with water and scanned in a densitometer (GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer; Bio-Rad).\n\nPeptide mass fingerprint (PMF). Peptide analysis and protein identification were performed as described elsewhere (4). Spots were automatically detected by Melanie 4.02 software (GeneBio, Geneve Bioinformatics S.A., Geneva, Switzerland) on the Coomassie blue-stained gel, excised by a Proteiner SPII instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), destained with 30% acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and dried in a speed vacuum concentrator (MaxiDry Plus; Heto, Allered, Denmark). Each dried gel piece was rehydrated with 5 μl of 1 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 50 ng trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) and left in the dark overnight at room temperature. A total of 10 μl of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid were added to each gel piece which was then incubated for 20 min with constant shaking. The resulting peptide mixture (1.5 μl) was simultaneously applied with 1 μl of matrix solution, consisting of 0.025% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and the internal standard peptides [Des-Arg]-bradykinin, (904.4681 Da; Sigma-Aldrich) and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18-39, (2465.1989 Da; Sigma-Aldrich) in 65% ethanol, 35% acetonitrile and 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid.\n\nSamples were analyzed for PMF with matrix-assisted laser desorption-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Ultraflex II; Bruker Daltonics). Matching peptide and protein searches were performed automatically, as described by Berndt et al. (12). Each spectrum was interpreted by Mascot Software (Matrix Sciences Ltd., London, UK). For peptide identification, the monoisotopic masses were used and a mass tolerance of 0.0025% (25 ppm) was allowed. Unmatched peptides, or peptides with up to one miscleavage site were not considered. The peptide masses were compared with the theoretical peptide masses of all available proteins from all species using SWISS-PROT, IPI and MSDB databases. The probability score identified by the software was used as the criterion for identification. The identified proteins were annotated on the gel image semi- automatically.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe brain is the control room of every organism, regulating all the functions of the body. Therefore, exploring the protein profile of the whole brain, as well as of its specific regions, is an important asset for neuroscience. The application of proteomics in the analysis of the central nervous system introduces neuroproteomics as a new field with specific evaluation requirements for the applied methodology and the results obtained. The possibility of studying the whole brain proteome is attractive, especially in order to correlate protein interactions and modifications at a cellular and functional level. In neuroproteomics, the different pieces of the nervous system are performed, so that the dynamics of each given sub-proteome can be better understood. Thus, by creating a profile of the human brain proteome, it is becoming possible to better understand numerous disorders of the central nervous system, such as neurological and psychiatric conditions (13, 14). Furthermore, a goal of the extensive application of neuroproteomics is the generation of the proteomic neuroanatomy of the individual brain regions and sub-areas, completing functional neuroanatonical studies (15).\n\nIn humans, the first approach for the proteomic analysis of brain resulted in the construction of a 2-D protein database of human fetal brains from control individuals. Although the specific database included 437 different gene products, being the largest protein database for higher eukaryotes at the time of publication, the absence of different brain regions from the analysis renders the functional analysis of the results difficult (16).\n\nBearing in mind the increased interest on the proteomic analysis of the brain and the difficulties in the analysis of human brain samples, neuroproteomics has been applied to the analysis of whole brain and to brain regions of mammals (mainly mouse and rat) in order to elucidate the general pattern of protein expression in these regions under physiological and pathological conditions (8, 17). However extensive application of proteomics in the analysis of the mouse brain and of the distinct areas of the normal brain has not yet been carried out (18).\n\nNeedless to say, the mouse is generally recognized among biomedical scientists as a key mammal for research purposes, and is clearly the mammal of choice in the increasingly dominant field of genetic research. Although its brain is much smaller and simpler compared to humans, it is of direct relevance with respect to human studies because it contains the same array of basic components laid out in a more linear pattern, and serves very well as an introduction to mammalian brain architecture and function (19).\n\nIn the present study, seven parts of the normal mouse brain were the subject of the proteomic analysis. There are numerous different tasks carried out by anatomically distinctive brain areas, which are characterized by alterations in tissue complexity resulting from different molecular tasks. Many attempts have been made to assess the proteome of some brain parts (18, 20-22), but to our knowledge an approach analyzing the entire proteome of the anatomically distinct different regions has never been made. Therefore, it seems essential to create a proteomic profile of normal murine brain and its regions, which will serve for the creation of a database consisting of this data and a reference map of these areas.\n\nWe applied 2-DE followed by MS in order to approach the entire proteome of mouse frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum, hypothalamus and medulla. By this approach, 515 proteins were identified (Table I), including many groups of proteins. Six members of the 14-3-3 protein family were indentified in the analyzed parts of the normal mouse brain. Previous studies indicated that 14-3-3 proteins were highly expressed in the brain, present in the cytoplasmic compartment, intracellular organelles and plasma membrane of neurons (23). Additionally, some isoforms are particularly enriched in the synapses, suggesting that they play a functional role in neuronal differentiation, migration and survival, neurite outgrowth and ion channel regulation (24). Their precise neurophysiological function is not fully-understood; previous studies have implicated 14-3-3 proteins in a number statement of neurological disorders. In accordance with the above, we identified α-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson’s disease, as well as three Disk homolog, which previous studies proposed as partners of 14-3-3 proteins (25).\n\nAnother group of proteins indentified by proteomics are the collapsin response mediator proteins, also called dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins (DPYLs). In mice, this family consists of five members (Dpyl 1 to -5), and in the present study, we identified all five members as being differentially expressed in the mouse brain parts analyzed. DPYLs are exclusively expressed in the nervous system, implicated in its development, while some isoforms are expressed in specific neuronal structures (26) and through direct or indirect interaction with other cytoskeleton molecules, are implicated in molecular pathways of neurodevelopmental physiology, such as neuronal differentiation and migration, invasive growth and axon guidance (27-39). In our previous studies, we observed that the expression levels of DPYLs were altered in intrauterine growth restriction rat brains compared to controls, suggesting that these proteins might be related to neuronal inability to correct synaptogenesis and differentiation in these animals (31). Furthermore, examining rat hippocampal lateral asymmetry, we found that DPYL2 and DPYL4 were differentially and more abundantly expressed in the right hippocampus than the left (8). In humans, DPYL2 expression was found to be lower in individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder as compared to non-psychiatric controls (32), while Barzilai et al. described an up-regulation of DYPL expression in Parkinson’s disease (33).\n\nEight out of the 14 members of the septin family of proteins were indentified in the normal mouse brain. The obtained results indicated that septins 3 and 7 were expressed only in the cortex, while septin 10 was found exclusively in midbrain. Although the entire function of septins in the brain and the neuronal system is not fully-known, relevant data has indicated that they may play a role as molecular scaffolds and membrane modulators required for cell polarity. Consistent with these results, it is indicated that septin-2 participates in epithelial cell polarity by facilitating apical and basal factor vesicle transport along microtubule tracks (34). In human neuropathology, several septins have been found to associate with protein aggregates that are common in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, but their role seems to be complex and poorly-understood (35, 36).\n\nThe environment of the brain is finely regulated; almost 30% of newly-synthesized proteins are incorrectly folded and thus degraded (37). Under normal conditions in order to maintain protein homeostasis, the brain utilizes a protein control system including molecular chaperones, such as heat-shock proteins, interacting with the ubiquitination machinery to target the misfolded proteins to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (38, 39). In accordance with this, by the proteomic approaches applied in the present study, we identified 14 members of the proteasome family, six members of the ubiquitin family and 11 members of the heat-shock protein family (Table I). This high number of proteins related to protein aggregation and degradation suggests that these mechanisms are essential to normal brain functions and that disturbances in these could lead to brain abnormalities. The pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Down’s syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, shares several common features, including the abnormal accumulation and aggregation of specific proteins in specific brain areas, which is suggested to lead to neurodegeneration, in which many proteins of the ubiquitin, proteasome, and chaperone systems have been implicated (40).\n\nIt is interesting that Calb1 and Calb2 proteins were identified in many brain parts in this study. Relevant studies indicated that Calb1 protein is related to learning, memory, locomotion, behavior and to the regulation of synaptic plasticity, while Calb2 is a calcium-binding protein which is abundant in auditory neurons (8, 41-43).\n\nFinally, in order to understand the role of the identified proteins to the specific function of the analyzed brain parts, two-way comparison analysis (part-by-part) was performed.\n\nFive proteins were isolated specifically from the cerebellum. One of these, pleckstrin (PHLB2), seems to be very important because previous studies indicated that it is associated with the post-synaptic membrane at the skeletal neuromuscular junction, concentrated at the borders of the post-synaptic domain as it develops, regulating acetylcholine receptor aggregation in this domain. Furthermore, PHLB2 binds both phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate and γ-filamin, and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulates its association with the membrane (44). The identification of this protein in the cerebellum alone needs further study, as the entire role of pleckstrin in brain function has not been fully elucidated.\n\nIn the hypothalamus, eight proteins were identified as being expressed specifically in that brain part. It is interesting that bile salt sulfotransferase-2 or hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (St2a2), a protein related to steroid metabolism was expressed only in the hypothalamus (45). The hypothalamus hypophysis axis is known to regulate steroid hormone production in the adrenal cortex and in gonads, and thus the identification of St2a2 in the hypothalamus is possibly related to allosteric regulation or feedback of these hormones.\n\nIn the medulla, 10 proteins were found to be uniquely expressed, including three helicases, three other enzymes, calponin-1, septin-10, target of myb1-like protein 2 (Tom1-like protein 2, TM1L2) proteins and the heat shock protein 75 kDa (Trap-1). Isoforms 8 and 10 of the septin protein family were expressed in the medulla. Previous studies have showed that septins 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11 might be functional within the presynapse as they were found in presynaptic terminals of mature synapses. They are functionally linked to the cytoskeleton and vesicle traffic, presynaptic neuronal septin complexes are probably important for ensuring proper axon development and neurotransmitter release (46). In the present study, septin 10 was isolated for the first time from the brain, while septin 8 was identified for the first time in the medulla.\n\nIn the cortex, 36 proteins were identified, including septins 3 and 7 and disks large homolog 1, 2 and 4 (Dlg 1, 2 and 4). DLGs were previous detected in many human brain parts because they are required for synaptic plasticity associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Furthermore, DLG2 is required for perception of chronic pain through NMDA receptor signaling and previous studies indicated that it regulates surface expression of NMDA receptors in dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord (47). Moreover, DLG proteins seem to be closely related to psychiatric disorders, while DLG4 is probably linked to the etiology of schizophrenia (48).\n\nIn the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, 62 and 54 proteins, respectively, were found to be overexpressed compared to the other brain parts analyzed, indicating that their function may be more complicated.\n\nThe obtained findings indicate the complexity of the brain as a whole, as well as of its parts, suggesting that a systems biology bioinformatics-based analysis is further needed in order to elucidate the specific role of the identified proteins in the function of each brain part."
