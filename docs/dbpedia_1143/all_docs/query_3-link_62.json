Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a positive regulator for neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival but the functions of its precursor (proBDNF) are less characterized.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that proBDNF collapses neurite outgrowth in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and cortical neurons by activating RhoA via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). We demonstrated that the receptor proteins for proBDNF, p75NTR and sortilin, were highly expressed in cultured DRG or cortical neurons. ProBDNF caused a dramatic neurite collapse in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was about 500 fold more potent than myelin-associated glycoprotein. Neutralization of endogenous proBDNF by using antibodies enhanced neurite outgrowth in vitro and in vivo, but this effect was lost in p75NTR−/− mice. The neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons from p75NTR deficient (p75NTR−/−) mice was insensitive to proBDNF. There was a time-dependent reduction of length and number of filopodia in response to proBDNF which was accompanied with a polarized RhoA activation in growth cones. Moreover, proBDNF treatment of cortical neurons resulted in a time-dependent activation of RhoA but not Cdc42 and the effect was absent in p75NTR−/− neurons. Rho kinase (ROCK) and the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) were also involved in the proBDNF action.   Conclusions proBDNF has an opposing role in neurite outgrowth to that of mature BDNF.

        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe morphology of axons and dendrites of neurons depends on the dynamics of the cytoskeleton which is regulated by diffusing factors from the environment, extracellular matrix, cell surface receptors and intracellular signals [21]. BDNF and other mature neurotrophins are important factors regulating neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation during development. However, the physiological function of proneurotrophins such as proBDNF in neurite outgrowth remains unclear. Our hypothesis is that endogenously released neuronal proBDNF may oppose functions of mature BDNF [22], [23], [24]. ProBDNF is highly expressed in DRG neurons and cortical neurons, can change transport anterogradely and retrogradely [25], [26], [27], and acts as a negative regulator via the p75NTR for the migration of cerebellar granule cells [11]. In the present study using a live cell imaging methods and immunostaining, we show that proBDNF is a potent neurite collapsing factor. The effect of proBDNF on neurite growth of neonatal cortical neurons is the same as in adult sensory DRG neurons. Most importantly, we have found that the neutralization of proBDNF with antibodies which recognize the prodomain of proBDNF shows a very robust increase in neurite outgrowth both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of the neutralization antibody on neurite growth is at least comparable to that of mature BDNF. Despite of some controversy regarding proBDNF distribution and release [28], [29], proBDNF has been detected in a number of brain regions by Western blot and immunohistochemistry [27], [30]. These studies strongly indicate that endogenous proBDNF may have physiological and pathological functions on axonal growth and guidance.\n\nNeurotrophins bind two kinds of receptors, tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) family and p75NTR, to mediate diverse functions during nerve development and in the adult brain. p75NTR is normally co-expressed with all Trks and modulates the Trks survival response of neurons. On the other hand, p75NTR is the coreceptor of NgR and the p75NTR/NgR complex mediates neurite outgrowth inhibition in vitro by MAG, OMgp, and Nogo [13], [14], [18]. Thus, during the development, neurite outgrowth depends on the balance mediated by p75NTR between positive signals stimulated by neurotrophins and negative signals from these myelin components in their environment [20], [31]. Simple deletion of p75NTR causes a retardation of axonal elongation in the periphery of developing mice [32] but significantly increases axonal growth in the central nervous system [33], indicating the importance of environmental factors in neurite growth regulated by p75NTR. In the present study we have identified that proBDNF is a potent neurite collapsing factor which activates RhoA via p75NTR to regulate neurite growth. As proBDNF and BDNF are anterogradely transported and are likely released concomitantly together in an activity dependent manner [22], [23], [24], proBDNF may play an antagonizing role in axonal elongation and dendritic arborization. Our in vivo data showed that blocking endogenous proBDNF dramatically increased the neurite outgrowth in the ventral planta, supporting the notion that proBDNF may be a physiological factor counteracting mature BDNF to maintain the balance of innervating territory. Recent studies by Miller’s group showed that p75NTR regulates dendritic, axonal pruning and axonal degeneration during development [18], [34]. Extracellular shedding of p75NTR can antagonize the inhibitory effect of myelin associated proteins on neurite outgrowth [35], indicating the soluble extracellular domain of p75NTR can block inhibitory factors. As p75NTR and sortilin are coreceptors for proBDNF [19], [36] and both are expressed in primary sensory neurons and primary cortical neurons, proBDNF may act as an autocrine or paracrine factor. In this study, we confirmed that the proBDNF, p75NTR and sortilin, are highly expressed on DRG and cortical neurons. Our studies show that altering the balance by application of anti-proBDNF antibodies to neutralize endogenous proBDNF can promote neurite outgrowth and axonal elongation, suggesting that proBDNF is normally released and functional. As no effect of anti-proBDNF is seen in DRG neurons of p75NTR−/− mice, it is most likely that the full length proBDNF, rather than the prodomain fragment which does not bind the p75NTR, works via p75NTR to cause neurite collapse.\n\nTo further confirm the inhibitory effect of proBDNF on neurite growth, we used MAG as the positive control [37], [38] to compare their effects. Both dose-dependently inhibit neurite growth but proBDNF is 533∼583 fold more potent than MAG. As endogenous myelin-associated inhibitors are considered major impediments to regeneration after nerve injury, a myriad of strategies are applied to suppress these factors for promoting regeneration [39], [40], [41]. However the results are disappointing as the elimination of MAG, Nogo, OMgp or Semaphorin-mediated inhibition are not sufficient to promote extensive axon repair after spinal cord injury [41], [42]. These studies suggest that these inhibitors do not play a major role in CNS axon degeneration [43]. In the present study, we found that proBDNF is over 500 more potent than MAG in collapsing neurites, suggesting that proBDNF can be one of the potent inhibitors for nerve regeneration after CNS injury. In particular, when axons are injured, proBDNF is anterogradely transported to the injury sites then accumulates in the injured axonal bulb in the spinal cord [25]. It is likely that the accumulated proBDNF is released to collapse growth cones of CNS axons and prevent the regeneration of injured neurons. Thus the suppression of endogenous proBDNF and other proneurotrophins following CNS injury may promote regeneration of injured nerves.\n\nFilopodia can detect environmental cues to transduce signals which then guide growth cone directions and dynamics [21], [44]. Growth cone turning was induced by the guidance cue, BDNF, and by the repellent factor, MAG [45]. In this study, we confirmed that proBDNF participates in growth-cone morphology and motility by reducing the length and number of filopodia. It is also likely that during development, proBDNF may function to repulse axons and balance the effect of mature BDNF to guide axons to their right destination. This is consistent with our previous work demonstrating that proBDNF repulses the migration of cerebellar granule neurons and their neurites, whereas mature BDNF or proBDNF antibodies attract them [11].\n\nGrowth cone protrusion and retraction of neurons is due to the dynamic assembly and disassembly of tubulin and actin cytoskeletal proteins. RhoA, Cdc42, Rac1 GTPases provide the necessary integration sites for the complex regulation of growth cone motility, cell division, and actin dynamics in neuronal growth [4], [46]. Over expression of dominant active forms of Rho initiate axon outgrowth and control of growth cone filopodial dynamics and promote axonal regeneration [4], [47]. Rho proteins, like other members of the Ras superfamily, have been shown to control the actin cytoskeleton by the active cycle changes between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. p75NTR interacts with Rho-GDI which is stimulated by MAG, initiating the activation of RhoA to inhibit the growth [48], [49]. We found that RhoA-GTPase is immediately activated in response to proBDNF, which was dependent on p75NTR. It is likely that the binding of proBDNF to p75NTR directly stimulates the interaction with Rho-GDI and promotes the generation of RhoA-GTPase which causes the subsequent collapse growth cones and filopodia.\n\nThe activation of RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK leads to growth cone collapse and neurite growth arrest, a mechanism that has been extensively studied in experiments on the myelin-associated inhibitors MAG, Nogo, and OMgp [50], [51]. To directly link the proBDNF-induced activation of RhoA and ROCK with inhibition of neurite outgrowth, pharmacological approaches were used to prevent the activation to abrogate the deleterious effects of the proBDNF. The reversal of inhibition with C3-transferase was less than that of Y27632, and this may be attributable to relatively lower cell permeability of C3-transferase [52]. Our studies show that the inhibition induced by proBDNF is via engagement of activation of RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK.\n\nIn the present study, using p75NTR−/− neurons and mice we could show that p75NTR is the proBDNF downstream signal molecule which is essential for the neurite collapse. We found that proBDNF neurite collapsing effect in vitro and in vivo are lost in p75NTR−/− neurons and in p75NTR−/− mice. Furthermore, we found that the RhoA activation by proBDNF was also abolished in p75NTR−/− neurons. These data indicate that p75NTR is responsible for the action of proBDNF. Our data raise a question of how to reconcile the contradictory roles of p75NTR in neurite growth/collapse. Yamashita et al. showed that mature neurotrophins inhibit RhoA in the absence of Trk receptors, promoting neurite growth [48]. Recently, Yamashita’s group discovered another pathway demonstrating that p75NTR may activate paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIR-B) which recruits Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatise (SHP)-1 and SHP-2, that dephosphorylates Trk receptors and reduces neurite growth [53]. The activation by mature neurotrophins of p75NTR in the presence or absence of Trk receptors would promote neurite growth via inactivation of RhoA and/or activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [48], [54], [55], [56]. On the other hand, the activation of p75NTR by proneurotrophins and/or myelin inhibitory factors in the absence of Trk or low levels Trk receptors in neurons would activate RhoA and suppress the signal transduction of Trk/MAPK, leading to the neurite collapse and degeneration. Thus, activation or inactivation of RhoA signaling pathway via the p75NTR is ligand- and coreceptor-dependent. The double-faced actions of p75NTR on neurite growth explains why no enhanced nerve regeneration is seen in p75NTR−/− mice after spinal cord injury [57].\n\nThe function of p75NTR in neurite growth does not only depend on neuronal expression of p75NTR, but also on the glial expression of p75NTR [58]. This interrelationship between different cell types expressing p75NTR is even more complicated in the peripheral nervous system. For example, macrophages express p75NTR and have been reported to affect peripheral nerve regeneration [59], p75NTR is highly expressed by peripheral neurons and also Schwann cells after Wallerian degeneration. We and others showed that Schwann cell p75NTR positively regulates nerve regeneration. The depletion of p75NTR causes retardation of peripheral nerve regeneration after nerve injury [57], [60], [61] and reduces the nerve elongation during development [32], [62].\n\nIn summary, proBDNF is a powerful neurite outgrowth inhibitor which activates RhoA via p75NTR. ProBDNF also decreases filopodial length and number of growth cones and triggers a polarized distribution of activated RhoA in the tips of growth cones. Neutralization of endogenous proBDNF enhances the innervation. Endogenous proBDNF may play an opposing role to that of mature BDNF regulating neurite growth.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals and Reagents\n\nAll experimental procedures were under the guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Flinders University. Adult 8–10 weeks old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 12), neonatal 129 sv wild-type (p75NTR+/+, n = 24), postnatal day 5 (P5, p75NTR+/+, n = 15), p75NTR deficient mice (p75NTR−/−, n = 12) were used.\n\nRecombinant proBDNF with a RR-AA mutation of the cleavage site and the neutralizing proBDNF antiserum were produced in our lab and their biological activities have been characterized [63]. The antisera directed against proBDNF for immunohistochemistry have been characterised [27]. The neutralizing antiserum specifically recognize proBDNF but not mature BDNF and other neurotrophins [11], [12], [25], [26], [63]. Culture media were obtained from Invitrogen and other reagents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless specified otherwise.\n\nPrimary Neuron Culture\n\nLumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected from SD rats (∼250 g, n = 6) and cut into eight pieces, digested at Collagenase II Ca2+ free Hank’s solution as described previously [64]. The tissues were dissociated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, the cell suspension was layered on top of a 15% fatty acid-free albumin bovine serum (BSA, Sigma) solution. After a 400 g centrifugation for 20 min the pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.25% foetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen), penicillin–streptomycin (100 U), L-glutamine (2 mM) and B27 (2%) serum-free supplement (Invitrogen). The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion and 2×104 DRG cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated cell culture dishes and cultured at 37°C in 95% O2 ? 5% CO2 incubator. Cultured DRG neurons were treated with proBDNF (0, 3, 10, 30, 100 ng/ml), anti-proBDNF (10 µg/ml), BDNF (50 ng/ml), normal sheep IgG (IgG, 10 µg/ml) or recombinant rat MAG-Fc chimera (0, 3, 10, 30 µg/ml, R&D Systems, USA).\n\nFor primary cortical neuron cultures, p75NTR+/+ (n = 12), p75NTR−/− (n = 6) mice postnatal day 1 (P1) were killed, neurons were purified as described previously [11], [65]. Briefly, cortices were collected, meninges removed and tissue sliced into 0.5 mm pieces. Tissue blocks were incubated in 1% trypsin ? EDTA (Invitrogen, Australia) with 0.1% DNaseI (Worthington, NJ, USA) for 8 min at 37°C with shaking every 5 min. Digestion was stopped by adding 15% FCS. After a 400 g centrifugation for 10 min the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (2%), N2 (1%), penicillin–streptomycin (100 U), L-glutamine (2 mM) and FCS (2%). 1×106 cortical cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated cell culture dishes, after 24 h cultured at 37°C in 95% O2 ? 5% CO2 incubator, neurons were incubated with BSA as a control, proBDNF or MAG. Neurite length was measured after 2 h treatment.\n\nTime-lapse Video Microscopy\n\nPhase-contrast images from cultured DRG neurons were collected using an inverted microscope (BioStation, Nikon, Japan). Digital images were captured every 30 sec for 30 min, collected individually and analyzed by Advanced Research software for the determination of the neurite extension length. The extension rate was defined as the difference between the length at time point 0 and the time examined and divided by the time period (seconds).\n\nWestern Blot of ProBDNF, p75NTR and Sortilin in Cortex or DRG\n\nThe cultured neuron protein concentration for Western Blot was assayed using a BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). 40 µg of homogenate proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min and separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 µm pore size, GE Healthcare Life Science) was probed with primary antibodies directed to rabbit anti-p75NTR (1∶1000, G3231, Promega, USA), rabbit anti-sortilin (1∶1000, Osenses, Australia) and a monoclonal antibody to β-actin (1∶1000, Sigma) as the internal control overnight, respectively, followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) at 1∶2000 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences).\n\nIndirect Immunofluorescence and Neurite Outgrowth Assay\n\nFor outgrowth assays, primary cultured neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), then incubated overnight with 1∶1000 rabbit anti-MAP2 polyclonal antibody (Osenses, Australia) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, USA). Images were acquired from randomly selected fields (n = 8∼12) under Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus BX50). The length of the longest neurite of 80∼120 neurons per condition was determined using ImageJ software [66]. Each experimental condition was done in duplicate wells, and at least three independent experiments were conducted to acquire the final results.\n\nActivation Assay of RhoA and Cdc42\n\nThe proBDNF-dependent activation of RhoA and Cdc42 was assessed using a pull-down assay kit according to manufacturer instructions (NewEast Biosciences, USA). Due to the limited number of DRG neurons we used cortical neurons in this assay. 107 cortical cells from p75NTR+/+ and p75NTR−/− mice were cultured and treated with 30 ng/ml proBDNF for 0, 5, 10, 20 min, and subsequently homogenized and lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). One aliquot was used for immunoblot (IB) analysis, the second aliquot was incubated with GTP-RhoA or GTP-Cdc42 antibody, bound with protein A/G agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE, detected by anti-RhoA or anti-Cdc42 antibodies. GTP-activated levels were normalized to the corresponding total RhoA levels using densitometric analysis using ImageJ software. The data were expressed as a percentage of the signals obtained at 5, 10 and 20 min in comparison with the time point 0.\n\nImmunohistochemical Detection of Activated RhoA and Cdc42\n\nPrimary cultured rat DRG neurons (n = 6) were exposed to proBDNF for 0, 5, 10, 20 min, fixed with 4% PFA and incubated with antisera directed against GTP-RhoA or GTP-Cdc42 (NewEast Biosciences, USA) respectively, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluro 594 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, USA). The presence of GTP-activated RhoA or Cdc42 in growth cones was quantified by measuring signal intensity in each growth cone using ImageJ. For F-actin staining, primary cultured DRG neurons were fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde, quenched with 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride for 15 min, followed by incubation rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, USA). The staining of growth cones were captured using a confocal microscope (Leica SP5, Germany).\n\nNeurite Outgrowth Assay Detects Activation of RhoA and ROCK Pathway\n\nThe chemical approach included treatment of cultured DRG neurons with the RhoA inhibitor, C3-transferase (25 µg/ml; Cytoskeleton), and/or the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 (10 µM; Calbiochem), before adding proBDNF (30 ng/ml). 2×104 cultured DRG neurons were treated after 24 h later, neurite length was measured as above mentioned. Cell lysates were assayed for activated RhoA and for phosphorylated CRMP-2 (rabbit polyclonal anti phosphorylated CRMP-2 affinity purified antibody was a gift from Dr S. Petratos, Monash University, Clayton, Australia).\n\nIn vivo Delivery of Exogenous ProBDNF and its Neutralizing Antiserum into the Footpad of Pups\n\n10 µl of proBDNF (1 µg), anti-proBDNF (5 µg) or IgG (5 µg) were injected into the footpad of P5 p75NTR+/+ and p75NTR−/− mice (n = 5/treatment) on three consecutive days. On day ten, the pups were anesthetized and immobilized perfused through the heart with 30 ml saline followed by 50 ml Zamboni’s fixative as described previously [11]. After perfusion, the injected ventral planta was dissected and post-fixed overnight in the same fixative. The next day, the planta was cryopreserved in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline +18% sucrose. Sagittal cryostat sections (30 µm thickness) were cut into five series using a freezing microtome (Leica, Germany) and mounted on gelatine-coated glass slides as described previously [11]. The series in every fifth mid-sagittal sections were used for nerve fiber density quantification. These sections were blocked using 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature then incubated with anti-neurofilament antibody (1∶1000, RT97, Abcam, UK) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse secondary antibody. Images were taken from 8 sections per animal under Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus BX50). The nerve fiber density was determined by determing the area occupied by nerve fibers at 150 µm intervals using ImageJ program. Five animals per treatment were used in this study. The data were expressed as a normalized nerve fiber density using normal sheep IgG group as 1.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe in vivo experiments of footpad injection were carried out in a double blinded manner. The data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Experiments with intra or inter group were analyzed by using Student’s t test or one way ANOVA with Least-significant Difference (LSD) Post Hoc Test. p values<0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses of the experimental data were performed using 13.0 SPSS."
