        "text": "Worldwide deaths from diabetes mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer increased by 90% and 57%, respectively, over the past 20 years. The risk of colorectal cancer was estimated to be 27% higher in patients with type 2 DM than in non-diabetic controls. However, there are potential confounders, information from lower income countries is scarce, across the globe there is no correlation between DM prevalence and colorectal cancer incidence and the association has evolved over time, suggesting the impact of additional environmental factors. The clinical relevance of these associations depends on understanding the mechanism involved. Although evidence is limited, insulin use has been associated with increased and metformin with decreased incidence of colorectal cancer. In addition, colorectal cancer shares some cellular and molecular pathways with diabetes target organ damage, exemplified by diabetic kidney disease. These include epithelial cell injury, activation of inflammation and Wnt/β-...\n\nThe potential involvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor for colon cancer (CC) has been previously reported. While several clinical studies show a higher incidence of CC and a lower survival rate in diabetics, others report no association. Our own experience indicates that diabetes does not seem to worsen the prognosis once the tumor is present. Despite this controversy, there are no wide‐spectrum molecular studies that delve into the impact of T2DM‐related mechanisms in colon carcinogenesis. Here, we present a transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of paired tumor and normal colon mucosa samples in a cohort of 42 CC patients, 23 of which have T2DM. We used gene set enrichment and network approaches to extract relevant pathways in diabetics, referenced them to current knowledge, and tested them using in vitro techniques. Through our transcriptomics approach, we identified an unexpected overlap of pathways overrepresented in diabetics compared to nondiabetics, in...\n\nCollagen type I alpha 2 chain (COL1A2) has been shown to participate in the development of various human malignancies. However, the role of COL1A2 in human colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. This study investigated the expression pattern of COL1A2 in primary CRC tissues as well as the correlation of COL1A2 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis of CRC. The function of COL1A2 in CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as the possible mechanisms were also examined. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the expression of COL1A2 in primary cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from CRC patients. A COL1A2-expressing lentiviral vector was transfected into CRC cells, and cell counting kit-8 and Transwell assays were used to explore the effects of COL1A2 on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Microarray-based mRNA expression profile screening was performed to reveal the possible signaling pathwa...\n\nThe burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing all over the world. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing. It is estimated that diabetes affects 387 million people worldwide. It is predicted that 552 million people worldwide will develop diabetes by 2030. A large pool of data indicate that DM increases by 2 fold the risk of CRC. This is the reason to firmly suggest the inclusion of DM in the criteria for CRC screening as an important measure to decrease the mortality of this ailment.\n\nA substantial body of literature has provided evidence that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and colorectal neoplasia share several common factors. Both diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide and have an increasing incidence. In addition to usual risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and family history, common pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of these diseases have been identified. These include changes in glucose metabolism associated with adipose tissue dysfunction including insulin resistance resulting to hyperinsulinemia and chronic hyperglycemia. In addition to altered glucose metabolism, abdominal obesity has been associated with accented carcinogenesis with chronic subclinical inflammation. An increasing number of studies have recently described the role of the gut microbiota in metabolic diseases including T2DM and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Due to the interconnectedness of different pathophysiological p...\n\nIntroduction Colon cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an emerging health problem worldwide. 1,2 Both conditions share relatively similar risk factors, including, age, obesity, reduced physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol. 3,4 T2DM is often considered an independent risk factor for the progression of colorectal cancer. 5 The risk of colon cancer increases by 40 to 60% in patients with diabetes. 6 Although most of the risk factors for T2DM and colon cancers are similar, the potential epidemiological evidence linking the Keywords ► colon cancer ► KRAS ► gene expression ► immuno-histochemistry ► type 2 diabetes Abstract Background Cancer and diabetes have a tremendous impact on health globally. This study aimed to evaluate the KRAS gene in colon cancer tissues obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methodology Data from 315 cases (156 colon diabetics and 159 patients were nondiabetics) were retrospectively retrieved. mRNA from surgically resected colon cancer tumors were also retrieved. Results The expression of KRAS mRNA was significantly higher in patients afflicted with T2DM than nondiabetic patients. The KRAS mRNA levels were significantly amplified from primary to metastatic lesions (p < 0.001). Conclusion The association between T2DM and colon cancer was well-established in the present study."
