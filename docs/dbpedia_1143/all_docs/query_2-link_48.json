        "text": "Genetic analyses\n\nIn family 1, DNA samples of family members were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, and whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on a HiSeq XTen Deep Sequencer (Illumina, CA, USA), with an average coverage of ∼36X, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary data analysis was done by a combination of Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) sequence aligner for reads alignment to human reference genome GRCh37/hg19, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline for calling single-nucleotide variant (SNV), and small insertion and deletion (indel), and ANNOVAR for variant characterization 18-20. Identified variants were filtered through comparison with the disease-associated variants in the known databases (Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, 2020.2) and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)) and polymorphism databases (dbSNP143, 1000 Genome). Sanger sequencing of the CRMP1 gene (NM_001014809) was performed to confirm the identified variants in the patients and further family members and performed segregation analysis of the variants with the phenotype.\n\nIn family 2, variants were detected by routine WES diagnostics and variant calling using a parent-offspring trio approach as described previously 21. Briefly, the exome was captured using the Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon v5 library prep kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Exome libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with 101 bp paired-end reads at a median coverage of 75× at the BGI Europe facilities (BGI, Copenhagen, Denmark). Sequence reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) and variants were subsequently called by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) unified genotyper, version 3.2-2 and annotated using a custom built diagnostic annotation pipeline. Multi-species sequence alignment were performed using Multialin, PhyloP and PhastCons and the variants disease-causative nature were predicted using the free online tool Mutation Taster (www.mutationtaster.org).\n\nIn family 3, trio-based whole-genome sequencing was performed on blood-derived genomic DNA at the Laboratoire de biologie médicale multisites SeqOIA (LBMS SeqOIA, Paris, France). After extraction, DNA samples were sonicated, and libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra-II kit (New England Biolabs). Whole-genome sequencing was performed in paired-end 2×150-bp mode, with a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina). Demultiplexed data were aligned to the genomic reference (hg19). Recalibration and variant calling was performed using GATK4 (Broad Institute). Short variants were annotated with SNPeff (4.3t). Copy Number Variants >4kb were called using CNVnator (v0.4.1) and annotated with AnnotSV (v2.5.1). An average depth-of-coverage of >50x was obtained for both probands, and variants were prioritized according to impact, frequency, and segregation. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the identified mutation in the CRMP1 gene.\n\nPhenotype and genotype of index patients\n\nProband 1 (P1) was born as the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents of Caucasian descent after an uneventful pregnancy (Fig 1A, Table 1). At delivery a singular umbilical artery was noted. The global development was delayed from infancy on: with sitting at 1.5-2 years-of-age, standing with support at 1-1.5 years-of-age, walking at 2-2.5 years-of-age, first words at 2-2.5 years-of-age. Standardized cognitive tests performed at 5-10 years revealed a moderate intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 55 at last assessment using the Kaufman Assessment battery for children (K-ABC). She had speech disorder. Behavioral problems included a lack of distance to men and a sexualized behavior. At last assessment at 15-16 years-of-age, the girl had generalized muscular hypotonia with normal reflexes, but fine motor problems with a broad-based gait but no ataxia. When climbing stairs, she showed clear instability. The results of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 - 4 years as well as that of further work-up (including metabolic tests, electroencephalogram (EEG), ophthalmological assessment, electrocardiogramm, echocardiogramm, abdominal sonography) were normal. Since preliminary genetic tests including chromosome analysis and array-CGH were normal in the index patient (P1), we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the underlying genetic cause. WES followed by bioinformatic analysis and confirmation with Sanger sequencing revealed the heterozygous de novo variant in the CRMP1 gene c.1766C>T (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5830253G>A) in the affected child P1 (Fig 1B). At the protein level, this variant leads to an amino acid change at position 589 from proline to leucine: P589L in long isoform, CRMP1A (NP_001014809.1) and P475L in short form, CRMP1B (NP_001304.1) (Fig 1B). The identified variant was not found in 1000Genomes, dbSNP or gnomAD. The CADD score (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) was 24.5. The mutation localizes to a highly conserved position, as demonstrated by PhyloP (5.327), PhastCons (1) score and multi-species sequence alignment (Fig 1C). The Provean score of the identified variants predicted to have a deleterious effect (−5.854, cutoff= -2.5).\n\nProband 2 (P2) was born as the second child of non-consanguineous parents of Caucasian descent after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery (Fig 1A, Table 1). The boy was macrosomic at birth but had no congenital microcephaly. His motor development was delayed (unsupported walking at 2-2.5 years-of-age) due to congenital mild muscular hypotonia with normal deep tendon reflexes, but no coordination problems. He had bilateral pes planus. A speech delay and language impairment with first words spoken at 3-3.5 years-of-age were diagnosed. He was also diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and normal cognitive abilities (IQ 95). At last assessment at 10-11 years-of-age, an obesity associated with hyperphagia was of raising concern, and he had secondary enuresis nocturna. The results of a cranial MRI and EEG were normal. Similarly, through WES followed by bioinformatic analysis, we identified a heterozygous de novo variant c.1280C>T in the CRMP1 gene (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5841279G>A) in proband (P2) (Fig 1B). This variant leads to an exchange of threonine to methionine at position 427 in the long form, CRMP1A (p.T427M, NP_001014809.1) and at position 313 in the short form, CRMP1B (p.T313M, NP_001304.1) (Fig 1B). The variant affects a highly conserved region of the protein (Fig 1C).\n\nProband 3 (P3) is the first child of three of a non-consanguineous family of European descent (Fig 1A, Table 1). She was born at gestation week 40 after an uneventful pregnancy, with normal birth parameters (weight: 3.610 kg, height: 50 cm, head circumference: 32.5cm, Apgar score: 10/10). She had developmental delay with not being able to sit alone at 1-1.5 years-of-age and walked without support at 2-2.5 years-of-age. Her speech development was delayed with few words spoken at 2.5-3 years-of-age. She began to gain weight from 1.5-2 years-of-age, and overgrowth was noticed since the 2-2.5 years-of-age. Endocrinological screening, including leptin blood level was normal. There is familial history of obesity on both parental sides, and one of the parent is macrocephalic. She developed severe behavioral issues with temper tantrums, stubbornness, hyperphagia, obsessive-compulsive characteristics and autism spectrum disorder. She was attending medical-educational institute at the age of 8-8.5 years. At the last assessment of 13-14 years-of-age, she had moderate intellectual disability and persistent severe behavioral disorders. Distinctive facial features were low forehead hair insertion, anteverted and large earlobes, broad nasal tip, short philtrum and full lower lips. Genu valgum and hyperlordosis as well as abdominal and dorsal strech marks were noted. Enuresia was noted. Cerebral MRI and abdomino-renal ultrasound were normal. Metabolics and storage disease screening were negative. Array analysis revealed two maternally inherited deletions: a 668 kb deletion at 3q26.31 and a 371kb at 5q23.1, confirmed by genome sequencing and considered as variant of unknown significance. Further analysis through trio-based whole-genome sequencing identified a de novo variant in the CRMP1 gene c.1052T>C (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5841409A>G) (Fig 1B). The identified variant leads to an exchange of phenyl alanine to serine at position 351 of long form of CRMP1 (CRMP1A (NP_001014809.1)) and at position 237 in short form (CRMP1B (NP_001304.1)) and it is located in the highly conserved region of the protein (Fig 1C). This variant is not found in gnomAD database. In silico pathogenicity prediction tools predicts the identified variants to be deleterious (CADD pared: 23.60; REVEL 0.577 (Thresholds > 0.5 Damaging), ClinPred 0.975 (Damaging ≥ 0.5), Mistic: 0.90 (Damaging Threshold ≥ 0.5)). No additional pathogenic variants have been identified by trio genome sequencing, including all known genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nEffect of identified CRMP1 variants on protein structure\n\nSince CRMP1 is known to oligomerize to form homotetramers and heterotetramers along with other CRMPs to regulate cellular functions, we determined the effect of the identified human variants on its protein structure using known structures and protein structure prediction tools. The structure of CRMP1 short form, CRMP1B, has been determined at 3.05A resolution22 lacking the N-terminal 14 residues and residues 491-572 in their C-terminal region. CRMP1 monomer consists of three structural parts, N-terminal β-strands followed by a linker β-strand connected to the central α/β-barrel (Fig 1D). Several residues contribute to the oligomerization interface of CRMP1 and the quaternary structure of CRMP1 tetramer is shown in Fig 1E. The amino acid exchange of P475L, T313M, and F237S are located in the highly conserved region of CRMP1. The P475L is the last residue before the start of the C-terminal helix and the exchange of proline to leucine is predicted to lead to serious clashes with the neighboring residues (Fig 1F). Such spatial constraints may alter the dipole moment of the helix and lead to long-range allosteric effects (Fig 1G). The T313M lies within the region of the α/β-barrel, is oriented towards the inside of the protein and located close to the ligand-binding active site/cavities (Fig 1H). Rearrangements within the protein upon interaction with other CRMPs or molecules could shuffle these cavities for normal functioning. The exchange of threonine to methionine is predicted to prevent rearrangements and to affect the oligomerization as well as other interactions. The F237S is localized directly in the center of interface 1 so the exchange of a heavy hydrophobic sidechain by a hydrophilic short sidechain most likely interferes with the stability of the dimer interaction (Fig 1I). Based on structural simulations, all three variants are predicted to affect the ternary structure of CRMP1 and impact on its oligomerization.\n\nP475L and T313M mutations affect homo-oligomerization of CRMP1B\n\nTo analyze the effect of CRMP1 variants on its protein levels and cellular function, two variants (CRMP1B-P475L (P1) or -T313M (P2)) were chosen for further functional analysis. We purified the recombinant human CRMP1B-wildtype, -P475L (P1) or -T313M (P2) proteins using the E. coli GST-tag expression system. CRMP1B-wildtype showed two major 64 kDa and 60 kDa bands on SDS-denatured gel electrophoresis (Fig 2A, left lane). The 64 kDa and 60 kDa correspond to full-length CRMP1B and to a truncated, C-terminal region cleaved form, respectively. The yield of purified T313M (TM) or P475L (PL) was less than that of wildtype in the same condition (Fig 2A, middle and right lanes). This finding may be due to lower expression and/or aggregation of the mutant proteins in E. coli. As T313M and P475L mutated residues are positioned close to the dimer/tetramer interface of CRMP1B, these mutations may affect homo-oligomerization of CRMP1. We therefore examined the oliogomerization of recombinant CRMP1 preparation with Blue-Native gel electrophoresis (Fig 2B). A broad band of CRMP1B-wildtype was present at high (720 kDa) but residual amount of monomeric form was detected at low molecular weight (70 kDa) on Blue-Native gel. The 720 kDa band probably represents the homo-oligomerization of CRMP1B-wildtype under the native condition. In contrast, CRMP1B-T313M and -P475L showed the increased monomeric 70 kDa band, suggesting weakened self-association of these mutants.\n\nAs these mutations were found in the heterozygous state in the affected patients, CRMP1B-T313M and/or -P475L expression might perturb the oligomerization of CRMP1B-wildtype in a dominant-negative manner. We therefore next co-expressed V5-CRMP1B-wildtype together with either myc-CRMP1B-wildtype, -T313M, or -P475L in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig 2C upper and middle panels, co-expression of myc-CRMP1B-T313M or -P475L did not alter the expression level of V5-CRMP1B-wildtype on SDS-denatured gel electrophoresis. Anti-V5 immunoblot analysis of these specimens on Blue-Native gel electrophoresis (Fig 2C, lower panel) revealed that the co-expression of myc-CRMP1B-wildtype showed major 1100 kDa and minor 360 kDa bands of V5-CRMP1-wildtype. In contrast, co-expression of myc-CRMP1B-T313M or -P475L increased the lower (360 kDa) V5-CRMP1B-wildtype, suggesting that these mutants potentially impede multimer formation of CRMP1B-wildtype. As V5-immunoreactive signal at higher molecular size (1100 kDa) in P475L was remarkably decreased than that in T313M, P475L may exhibit stronger dominant negative effect."
