        "meta_description": "Collapsing response mediator protein-1 (CRMP-1) was initially identified in brain and has been implicated in plexin-dependent neuronal function. The high amino acid sequence identity among the five CRMPs has hindered determination of the functions of each individual CRMP. We generated viable and fertile CRMP-1 knock-out ( CRMP-1 −/−) mice with no evidence of gross abnormality in the major organs. CRMP-1 −/− mice exhibited intense microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining in the proximal portion of the dendrites, but reduced and disorganized MAP2 staining in the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Immunoreactivity to GAP-43 (growth-associated protein-43) and PSD95 (postsynaptic density-95) (a postsynaptic membrane adherent cytoskeletal protein) was also decreased in the CA1 region of the knock-out mice. These changes were consistent with the mutant mice showing a reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region and impaired performance in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory tests. CRMP-1 −/− mice showed a normal synapsin I labeling pattern in CA1 and normal paired-pulse facilitation. These findings provide the first evidence suggesting that CRMP-1 may be involved in proper neurite outgrowth in the adult hippocampus and that loss of CRMP-1 may affect LTP maintenance and spatial learning and memory.",

        "text": "Construction of targeting vectors.\n\nMouse CRMP-1 genomic DNA, 10 kb in length (nucleotides 32,963–42,541, according to the Celera Genomics database), coding for exons 3–6, was isolated from a 129/Sv genomic DNA BAC library (CITB mouse; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by the gap-repair technique (Lee et al., 2001) using the following primers: BACSP63′U (5′-CCAATTCCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCGA-ATTTCTGCCATTCATCCGCTTGCGGCCGCGATACGCGAGCGAACGTGA-3′) and CRMPBAC6D (5′-CTGAGCTATCAAATCTCCATTTTCTGCATGGACTAAGATCACAGCTCCCAAAGTCGACTTCTT-AGACGTCAGGTGGCAG-3′). The 10 kb CRMP-1 genomic DNA fragment was inserted into a pBR322 plasmid and further digested with appropriate restriction enzymes to obtain long and short arms for homologous recombination.\n\nTwo CRMP-1 targeting vectors were generated based on a pHPRT-loxP vector modified from pKO-loxP (Yadav et al., 2003) by replacing the neo cassette with the mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. The pHPRT-loxP vector enables hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT) selection for the presence of HPRT under the control of the mouse PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, as well as gancyclovir selection for absence of the viral TK (thymidine kinase) gene. The constructed targeting vectors I and II (see Fig. 1A) were used to insert the loxP-flanked HPRT into introns 5 and 3 of CRMP-1, respectively. The long and short CRMP-1 homologous arms derived from the 10 kb genomic DNA consisted of a 5.9 kb HindIII–ApaI fragment (nucleotides 35,089∼41,010) containing a portion of intron 3, exons 4–5 and a portion of intron 5 of CRMP-1 (long arm) and a 1.38 kb ApaI–NcoI fragment (nucleotides 41,010–42,390) containing the remaining portion of intron 5, 100 bp upstream of exon 6 of CRMP-1 (short arm). The long and short arms were modified at their ends and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pHPRT-loxP, respectively. A third loxP sequence was obtained from pULwL (Kondo et al., 2003) and inserted at the blunt-ended ClaI site (nucleotide 36,967) of intron 3. Targeting vector II (see Fig. 1A) was derived from targeting vector I by shortening the long arm to a 1.9 kb HindIII–ClaI fragment (nucleotides 35,089∼36,967) by deleting the XhoI fragment to become the short arm. The other arm in targeting vector II was the 4.0 kb XhoI to BamHI fragment of targeting vector I (ClaI–ApaI fragment of nucleotides 36,967∼41,010 of CRMP-1), blunt-ended and modified to have EcoRI ends before being inserted into the unique EcoRI site of pHPRT-loxP. There was a unique NotI site in pHPRT-loxP for linearization of both targeting vector I and II. The orientation and nucleotide sequences of the two constructs were confirmed by sequencing.\n\nSelection and screening for homologous recombination and generation of homozygous CRMP-1−/− mice.\n\nEmbryonic day 14 (E14) (E14TG2a, HPRT−) embryonic stem (ES) cells were used for transfection experiments. Growth and expansion of the ES cells, ES cell DNA isolation, Southern blotting, and preparation of DNA probes by labeling with [α-32P]dCTP were performed as described previously (Yu et al., 2004). The vector I-targeted ES clones (which failed to incorporate the third loxP site in intron 3) were subjected to Cre-mediated excision of the loxP-flanked HPRT fragment in intron 5. Cre excision was performed by transient transfection of the cells with a plasmid [pCAGGS-NLS-Cre; given by Dr. A. Nagy (Toronto University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada)] carrying the DNA coding for Cre recombinase (Vooijs et al., 2001). ES cells that survived the Cre transfection were subjected to limiting dilution and grown in the absence of HAT and then examined by Southern blotting for loss of HPRT. The resultant ES clones were further transfected by targeting vector II to recycle the loxP-flanked HPRT into intron 3. The Cre-recombinase plasmid was reintroduced to delete exons 4–5 of CRMP-1.\n\nCRMP-1-deleted ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to establish chimeric mice. Germline transmission of the CRMP-1−/− allele was achieved by crossing the chimeric mice with normal C57BL/6 mice. Mice born from the intercross of the heterozygous F1 littermates were used for most of the experiments. The littermates from the intercross of the heterozygous mice that had been backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background for four generations were also used in some experiments as specified.\n\nGenotyping, Northern blot analysis, and reverse transcription-PCR.\n\nMouse tail genomic DNA was isolated with a DNA Purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Genotyping of F1 and successive progenies was performed on tail DNA by Southern blotting as described for ES cells (Yu et al., 2004), and by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primer pairs: primers 3U plus 3D and 4D or 4U plus 4D (see Fig. 1A) for the wild-type CRMP-1 allele, and primers 3U plus 5D for the targeted allele. The primer sequences used were as follows: 3U, 5′-GCCAAATGACAGGCAGATTC-3′; 3D, 5′-ATTGATAGTGGGTCATGGGAG-3′; 4U, 5′-CAGCGCAGCAGAGCTCTTTCC-3′; 4D, 5′-ATGTGGAGATGGTAAAGTTCAAC-3′; and 5D, 5′-GCACAGTTCTACAGTAATAGCC-3′. The amplification reaction conditions were as follows: 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 1 min cycles at 94°C, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 72°C for 7 min.\n\nFor Northern blotting and reverse transcription (RT)-PCRs, whole brain and kidney were surgically removed from P7 wild-type and CRMP-1−/− mice, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until used. RNA was isolated from the frozen samples by treating the homogenized thawed brain tissue specimens with TriPure (Genesis Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan). Northern blotting was performed using the glyoxal method as described previously (Yu et al., 2004). Briefly, a 25 μg aliquot of total RNA was electrophoresed and detected by a 1.2 kb CRMP-1 cDNA fragment (coding for exons 1–11), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA fragment (Yu et al., 2004). Reverse transcription was performed using oligo-d(T)n as the primer for first-strand synthesis at 42°C (Yu et al., 2004), and the resultant product was used as the template for PCRs with oligonucleotide primers 2U (5′-AATGATGACCAGTCCTTCTAC-3′) plus 6D (5′-TCAAATCTCCATTTTCTGCATGG-3′) for CRMP-1 message and specific primers for GAPDH (Yu et al., 2004). PCR conditions for all of the primer pairs were the same as described for tail DNA genotyping.\n\nWestern blotting.\n\nSamples of whole brains, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of wild-type and mutant littermates at P1 and 8–12 weeks were homogenized in homogenization buffer [2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm TPCK (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone), 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate in PBS]. Total protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of total extracts were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting and observation with enhanced chemiluminescence (Western; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The antibodies used were anti-CRMP-1 (prepared in-house or purchased from Millipore), anti-CRMP-2 (prepared in-house), anti-CRMP-4 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) (Millipore) and anti-actin polyclonal antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). ECL data were semiquantified by densitometry using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). The relative density of each band was normalized against that of α-actin and expressed as means ± SEM. Significant differences between groups were evaluated by applying Student's t tests; values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nHistology and DiI labeling.\n\nTo demonstrate Nissl substance in tissue sections, mice at P7 were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 400 mg/kg trichloroacetaldehyde (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), and were perfused transcardially with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation overnight at 4°C, the brains were removed, submerged in 30% sucrose overnight, and 15-μm-thick coronal sections were cut on a freezing microtome. Sections were stained with cresyl echt violet for 5 min, washed with distilled water, dehydrated in ethanol, and mounted onto glass slides. The hippocampal commissural projection in the brain was examined by labeling nerves with the lipophilic fluorescent dye 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) (Invitrogen) (Taniguchi et al., 1997). P1 neonatal mice used for DiI labeling analysis were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, DiI crystals were injected into the CA3 region of the left hippocampus. The specimens were incubated at 37°C for 2 months, and 50-μm-thick brain sections were collected with a Vibratome (VT1000S; Leica, Nussloch, Germany). Sections were counterstained by submerging for 5 min in SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen). After washing in distilled water, sections were mounted and observed under a fluorescence microscope (DMR; Leica).\n\nFluorescent immunohistochemistry.\n\nMice (P1 and 8–12 weeks) were deeply anesthetized and perfused with normal saline followed by PBS with 15% picric acid, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1% glutaldehyde. Whole brains were then isolated for postfixation overnight in the same fixative at 4°C and embedded in paraffin. Ten-micrometer-thick coronal sections were deparaffinized followed by epitope retrieval with citrate buffer. L1–L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were prepared without perfusion and sectioned as described above. After blocking with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (FBS/PBST), tissue sections were incubated overnight with individual primary antibodies against CRMP-1 (1:200 dilutions), MAP2 (1:200), GAP-43 (1:200), neurofilament (1:200), Tau-1 (1:50 or 1:200; recognizing dephospho tau) and PSD95 (1:200) (all from Millipore), Synapsin I (1:200; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and Tau (1:200; recognizing unphosphorylated and phosphorylated tau proteins; Abcam) in FBS/PBST at 4°C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing in PBST three times followed by detection with an Alexa Fluor 488 Signal-Amplification kit (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing off unbound materials, sections were air-dried, coverslipped with mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), and examined on a confocal microscope (EZ-C1; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The computer software MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of the MAP2 labeling in confocal images of area CA1.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings.\n\nWild-type and mutant mice aged 8–12 weeks were killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains were quickly removed and placed in cold cutting buffer (87 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.26 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm MgSO4, 25 mm glucose, 75 mm sucrose, and 1 mm kynurenic acid) saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The hippocampus was sliced transversely into 400-μm-thick pieces and maintained for at least 1.5 h before recording in an interface chamber at room temperature where they were submerged in artificial CSF (aCSF) buffer (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.26 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm glucose) bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A bipolar tungsten-stimulating electrode was placed in the middle of the striatum radiatum layer of area CA1, and extracellular field potentials were recorded using a glass microelectrode (3 MΩ; filled with aCSF). The pulse duration was 100 μs, and test responses were elicited at 0.05 Hz (GS-3200; Gould, Cleveland, OH). aCSF was perfused over the tissue continuously at a rate of 1–2 ml/min.\n\nLTP was induced by two trains of 100 Hz stimulation, lasting 1 s for each train with a 20 s intertrain interval. The stimulation strength was set to provide field EPSPs (fEPSPs) with an amplitude that was 40∼60% of the maximum. When paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was examined in area CA1, paired-pulse stimulation was delivered at 0.01 Hz with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20, 50, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ms with stainless-steel bipolar electrodes placed in the outer or inner molecular layers of the piriform cortex. fEPSPs from corresponding layers were recorded via glass pipettes filled with 3 m NaCl (resistance, 0.5–1 MΩ) and were amplified and filtered at 1 kHz. PPF ratio was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the second fEPSP by the amplitude of the first fEPSP.\n\nBehavioral analysis.\n\nF2 progeny of intercross matings between heterozygous F1 mice, which have a mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6, were used for behavioral testing. Some experiments were repeated using mice that had been backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background for four generations. All behavioral results are presented as means ± SEM. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare data among the groups. Post hoc Scheffé's tests were used to detect the sources of detected significant comparisons.\n\nWater maze.\n\nSpatial memory performance was evaluated with the Morris water maze task (D'Hooge and De Deyn, 2001) using a circular water maze pool that was 120 cm in diameter and 60 cm high. The pool was divided into four quadrants and filled to a depth of 35 cm with milky water at 25 ± 0.5°C. A platform 9 cm in diameter was placed at the center of a fixed quadrant ∼1.5 cm below the water surface. Young (8–12 weeks; backcrossed to C57BL/6 for four generations) and old (F2 generation; 5–10 months) mice were placed in the testing room with the pool surrounded by visual cues external to the maze including three plain posters fixed on three walls. During training, mice were placed at equidistant positions along the edge of the four quadrants of the maze and allowed to search for the location of the submerged platform. The duration between entering the water and climbing onto the platform was recorded as the escape latency, and the mean latency for finding the invisible platform was calculated for each mouse. Each mouse received four consecutive daily training trials for 6 d. The movement paths of the mice were monitored and recorded with a video camera mounted on the ceiling over the maze, and subsequently analyzed by a software program (EthoVision; Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). When a mouse failed to find the platform within 60 s, it was picked up by the experimenter and placed onto the platform for the duration of the 20 s intertrial interval.\n\nRetention was assessed with a probe trial given 24 h after the final training session. During the probe trial, the submerged platform was removed from the water maze and each mouse was placed in the water at the edge opposite to the quadrant where the platform had been located during the training trials. Mice were allowed to swim freely and search for the platform for 60 s. The duration that the mice searched within the quadrant that had previously contained the platform (target quadrant), and the durations spent in the other quadrants (nontarget quadrants) were recorded.\n\nAs a control for intact vision, the mice were subjected to a cued version of the water maze task 24 h after the probe trial. In the cued task, mice were placed in the water maze with the platform mounted 1 cm above the milky water surface so that it was visible. The escape latency of each mouse was determined.\n\nLocomotor activity.\n\nSpontaneous locomotor activity was assessed by placing each mouse in a small dark area (448 × 448 × 450 mm) that served as an activity chamber. They were allowed to explore the environment for 1 h. Total distance traveled, time and distance in the center of the field, and time and distance in the perimeter of the field were calculated by a computer that was connected to the activity chamber (TSE Technical & Scientific Equipment, Bad Homburg, Germany).\n\nNociception tests.\n\nThe tail-flick and hot-plate analgesia tests were performed according to protocols described by Eddy and Leimbach (1953). For the former, each mouse was gently restrained in a small plastic cylinder so that its tail was placed above an apparatus with a radiant heat source connected to an automatic timer to assess the analgesic response (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA). The heat source was set at an arbitrary setting of “55.” The latency of the mouse to flick its tail away from the heat source was recorded. A cutoff latency of 50 s was adopted to avoid tissue damage. The hot-plate test was performed on mice kept in a glass cylinder (17 cm high by 16 cm diameter) on a heated hot-plate surface (Fargo Instruments, Fargo, ND) set at 55 ± 0.5°C. A positive response was recorded when the mouse rubbed its forepaws together, wiggled its hindpaws, or jumped away from the plate. A cutoff time of 60 s was used."
