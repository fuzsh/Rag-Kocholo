TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) is a 2007 animated film based on the popular comic book series created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. Directed by Kevin Munroe, the movie serves as a continuation of the original film series that began in the 1990s.

The story follows the four anthropomorphic turtles named Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, who are trained in ninjutsu by their rat sensei, Splinter. The turtles, who live in the sewers of New York City, continue their mission to fight crime and protect the city from various threats.

In this installment, the turtles face their greatest challenge yet when an ancient warrior named Yaotl resurfaces and seeks to harness the power of thirteen mythical monsters to conquer the world. To stop Yaotl and his minions, the turtles must reunite and work together alongside their allies, including April O'Neil and Casey Jones.
