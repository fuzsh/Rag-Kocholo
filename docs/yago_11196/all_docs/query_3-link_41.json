The main characters would be once again played by their original voice actors while celebrity actors would cast in supporting roles.

He could do a great job too. But my main favourite would be Kevin Munroe on a animated Sonic feature. Maybe he could come back and do a animated Crash Bandicoot film too. It doesn't matter if you consider your opinions on the director, all that matters if you choose the director to do it."
