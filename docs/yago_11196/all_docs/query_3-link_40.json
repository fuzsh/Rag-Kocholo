        "text": "It seems like Imagi Animation just can't hold onto their directors. First they switched out David Bowers for Colin Brady on AstroBoy, now apparently TMNT's Kevin Munroe has dropped out of Gatchaman, their big sci-fi project. The reason - Munroe will now go on to direct a live action adaptation of Dylan Dog, a Dark Horse Comics series that originated in Italy about a nightmare investigator. Bloody Disgusting also confirms that Superman Returns star Brandon Routh has been officially attached as the lead in the film.\n\nI'm not too familiar with Dylan Dog at all, but it's an Italian comic that was brought to the US via Dark Horse. The comic is about the character Dylan, a penniless nightmare investigator who defies the whole preceding horror tradition with a vein of surrealism and an anti-bourgeois rhetoric. It's been described as \"an early, slacker P.I. version of the X-Files.\" The series is mainly set in London, where the protagonist lives, though he occasionally travels elsewhere. His clothes are one of his defining characteristics: he always dresses the same way, in a red shirt, black jacket, and blue jeans. You can check it out on DarkHorse.com.\n\nShooting will begin this July in Toronto. Horror company Hyde Park Films is producing. BD apparently has Munroe also listed as the writer, but we can't confirm whether that is 100% accurate, although he did write the script for the TMNT movie, too. Apparently the official title of the movie is Dead of Night, which you can find over at IMDb with some outdated information.\n\nWhile this isn't anything I'll immediately take an interest in, it sounds like a dark thriller that could turn into something unique. I'm much more interested in seeing how Munroe handles live action, if that is indeed how he's shooting, since he seems like a guy who is best at directing animated movies (e.g. TMNT or Gatchaman). You can read more about his background in our interview last March. In the same vein, it will be interesting to see how Brandon Routh handles a darker horror role after playing Superman."
