        "text": "TMNT (22-Mar-2007)\n\nDirector: Kevin Munroe\n\nWriter: Kevin Munroe\n\nMusic by: Klaus Badelt\n\nProducers: Thomas K. Gray; H. Galen Walker; Paul Wang\n\nKeywords: Action/Adventure\n\nFollowing the defeat of The Shredder, New York City's foremost fighting turtles square off against an ancient evil threatening Earth.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles -- Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael -- lack a sense of direction after the defeat of their greatest rival, going their separate ways and growing apart in the absence of a strong villain to fight. Strange events affecting New York City prompt Leonardo and sensei Master Splinter to work to reunite the Turtles, bringing them back together for a showdown against a horde of ancient creatures poised to take over the world.\n\nNameOccupationBirthDeathKnown for Dee Bradley Baker Actor 31-Aug-1962 Voice actor Jeff Bennett Actor 2-Oct-1962 Voice of Johnny Bravo Jim Cummings Actor 3-Nov-1952 Prolific voice actor Grey DeLisle Singer/Songwriter 24-Aug-1973 Singer and voice actress John DiMaggio Actor 4-Sep-1968 Voice of Bender on Futurama Chris Evans Actor 13-Jun-1981 Captain America Laurence Fishburne Actor 30-Jul-1961 The Matrix Sarah Michelle Gellar Actor 14-Apr-1977 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Jennifer Hale Actor 30-Jan-1972 Sam on Totally Spies!
