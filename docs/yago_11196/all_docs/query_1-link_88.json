        "text": "No one will hear the word “cowabunga” in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and that’s a good thing.\n\nThe new filmmakers behind the titular reptilian franchise have allowed Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello to evolve, figuratively speaking.\n\nThose creative minds are led by the quintessential Peter Pan and dude bro Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the film with Evan Goldberg (“Sausage Party”), and Jeff Rowe (writer of critical fave “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”), who also co-directs with Kyler Spears.\n\nIn fairness, Rogen’s work has matured over the years, but when you’re dealing with a group of teenage mutant ninja turtles as part of your resume, should the audience expect “mature?” I say not. The maturity and Rogen’s party boy ethos play out in an introductory film that sets the turtles up for stardom with a new generation. A sequel and the two-season order for a TV season are already on the agenda.\n\nThe film deftly delivers a message about acceptance while throwing the best on-screen blowout possible for kids and adults who go way back to the TMNT’s onscreen beginnings in 1990 (yup, guilty). It’s relevant for multiple generations as Rogen and company infuse the source material with an attitude courtesy of Generation Z with plenty for those of us claim Gen X status.\n\nWhat’s that mean? The soundtrack is of today. There is an inherent sense of appreciating anyone and everyone for who they are unless they, through nefarious deeds, prove that appreciation is unwarranted. Ultimately, however, it’s just serious fun.\n\nFor those who don’t know the origin story: Radioactive ooze turns four turtles and a rat into human sized, talking beings. The makeshift family lives in the sewers of New York City away from prying human eyes. Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan), the fatherly rat, tells his sons Leo, Mikey, Raph and Donnie that humans are bad and not to be trusted and, thus, keeps them hidden.\n\nAs teens, they long for some sense of normalcy (as normal as talking reptiles can get), which leads them to April (Ayo Edebiri), an aspiring journalist who discovers their existence. Soon the fast friends realize they can help each other.\n\nApril can help the turtles burnish an image as superheroes and, in the process, they can help her gain notoriety for her cause. Along the way, other mutants and their issues take center stage, which ends in a monster mash-up that includes Ice Cube voicing a character named Superfly.\n\nYes, that’s as much fun as it sounds given the attitude he injects into every syllable. It represents just one element that fits the film’s party-with-a-message attitude that’s enhanced by some funky, cutting-edge animation that gives “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a joyous, unique and gritty look.\n\nGeorge M. Thomas dabbles in movies and television for the Beacon Journal.\n\nReview\n\nMovie: “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem”\n\nCast: Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Rose Byrne\n\nDirected by: Jeff Rowe, Kyler Spears\n\nRunning time: 1 hour 39 minutes\n\nRated: PG for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material"
