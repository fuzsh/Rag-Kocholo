        "text": "Last Updated on July 23, 2021\n\nBack in May Ammon hit you all with a small DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT update that had a brand new teaser poster making the international rounds. Now that was exciting… but wait until you hear today’s update!\n\nAlright, I’ve got to be honest… Today’s update isn’t all that exciting either. Why beat around the bush? You see the guys over at ShockTillYouDrop have learned that DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT will be rated PG-13 ‘for scenes of creature violence and action, language including some sexual references, and some drug material.’\n\nSo did anyone expect this flick to not be rated PG-13? Come on now, this thing has screamed PG-13 from the very beginning! But hey… that’s alright. At least we expected this rating from the get-go, so it doesn’t leave much room for disappointment. I doubt this new rating will change your opinion of the flick either – you were either looking forward to this one or you weren’t, a PG-13 rating won’t change that at this stage of the game.\n\nThe problem is DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT has been stumbling around for a while now, with no news of distribution. Word has it we’ll be hearing something soon but this is getting ridiculous. The flick has already seen several international releases but nothing here in the US yet. Coming from director Kevin Munroe, the flick stars Brandon Routh, Peter Stormare, Taye Diggs, Sam Huntington, Brian Steele, Anita Briem (below), Marco St. John, Kurt Angle, Randal Reeder and Courtney J. Clark.\n\nDYLAN DOG will chronicle the adventures of supernatural private eye, Dylan Dog, who seeks out the monsters of the Louisiana bayou in his signature red shirt, black jacket, and blue jeans. In the film Dylan Dog is forced back into his nightmare investigations after he is approached by a woman who claims to have seen her father brutally murdered by a mysterious creature. With his street smarts, his gun, and a set of paranormal weapons, Dylan attempts to restore order both above and below ground.\n\nSo there you have it. A title, a rating and all the goods in between… but no release date! Hopefully we hear more on this project soon. As always, as soon as we hear something we’ll be sure to pass the good word along to all of you!"
