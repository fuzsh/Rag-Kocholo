        "text": "VTNVIVI does it again, digging up some groundbreaking Sly Cooper news. As you can see for yourself in the attached video, it looks like Sony dropped Kevin Munroe (director of the Ratchet and Clank film) from the Sly Cooper Movie. In short, Kevin Munroe posted an excerpt of text to Instagram admitting that he got dropped by the entertainment giant. He doesn't reference Sly Cooper in the post, but what else could he mean? People come and go all the time in the production stage of a movie, but how could this impact an already delayed timeline? Let me know what you think in the comments, and I'll be addressing some of the recent major website updates around here shortly!"
