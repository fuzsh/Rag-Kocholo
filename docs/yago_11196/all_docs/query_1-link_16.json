        "text": "Paramount hasn’t even started their CinemaCon session yet and news is breaking like flies on a rib roast.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin based on the fan-fave graphic novel is in the works with Tyler Burton Smith writing and Walter Hamada producing through his 18hz production company, as part of his multi-year deal with the studio. The movie will be the first R-rated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. Hopefully, there won’t be any naughty scenes involving turtles ala Fritz the Cat.\n\nSmith recently co-wrote the upcoming Roadside Attractions R-rated action movie Boy Kills World which hits theaters on April 26.\n\nLast Ronin was published as a miniseries between 2020 and 2022 and is set in a totalitarian future New York City as the Turtles and their master Splinter are assassinated by the grandson of their prime villain Shredder and his posse. One of the Turtles survives and swears revenge. It’s unclear if it’s Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo or Raphael as the reptile is armed with all the weapons which rep each’s specialty.\n\nCo-creator Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz wrote Last Ronin based on an older story by Eastman and co-creator Peter Laird. Artists on the miniseries were Esau and Isaac Escorza, Ben Bishop and Eastman.\n\nThe turtles delivered in $1 billion in retail sales for Paramount. Last year, the studio’s foray with the comic-book IP, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem delivered over $180M at the global box office.\n\nNo release date was announced for Last Ronin. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies through seven movies have grossed $1.3 billion."
