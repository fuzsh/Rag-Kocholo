        "text": "Theater counts: The Equalizer 3 charges into 3,965 theaters\n\nAugust 31st, 2023\n\nIt will be one week and done for Blue Beetle as the widest release as this weekend’s only new wide release makes its way into theaters and to the top of the list in the form of the third installment of The Equalizer franchise. While Blue Beetle pulled in a solid $12 million in its second weekend, it was stymied by newcomer Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story, along with the continued success of worldwide phenom, Barbie, which took the first and second place prize respectively at the box office. More...\n\nTheater counts: Blue Beetle and Strays not enough to oust Barbie from its spot as widest release\n\nAugust 17th, 2023\n\nBarbie continues to count up impressive numbers on a daily basis, crossing the $500 million mark domestically last Friday, and now with a 27-day North American total of just under $542 million. The film has fared even better overseas as it has charted $660 million from international markets. As Barbie continues to hit milestones and blaze trails, another Warner Bros movie buzzes into theaters in the way of the latest DC superhero film, Blue Beetle, while the R-rated talking-dog comedy, Strays, also makes its arrival. More...\n\nTheater counts: billion-dollar Barbie remains widest release for the third consecutive week\n\nAugust 10th, 2023\n\nAs the Summer season begins to wind down, there seems to be no stopping Barbie at the box office. Since making its debut on July 21, the film has become a worldwide phenomenon, capturing well over $1 billion in earnings in only 20 days in global cinemas. The movie also places director Greta Gerwig as the only female in the billion-dollar club with sole credit for directing a film. Like last week, Barbie should have little problem staying atop the box office charts this week, but there are a couple of fresh names to this week’s list in the way of The Last Voyage of the Demeter, and Jules More...\n\nTheater counts: Barbie adds theaters as it cruises into its second weekend\n\nJuly 27th, 2023\n\nAfter opening as the second-widest release last week, Barbie stands alone atop this week’s list of widest releases. The larger half of the duo known as “Barbenheimer” scored a whopping $162 million in its opening weekend and currently enjoys a six-day domestic total of over $237 million. While the opening weekend rush might be over, the Greta Gerwig directed feature looks to have another big weekend at the box office as the film adds 94 locations to its opening count of 4,243 cinemas, becoming available in 4,337 theaters this week. Last week wasn’t solely about Barbie however, as Oppenheimer gladly took home its fair share from the weekend, with domestic earnings of $82.45 million. Oppenheimer starts its second week in 3,647 locations. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for March 10th, 2015\n\nMarch 11th, 2015\n\nIt's a short list this week for two reasons. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1's DVD and Blu-ray Combo Pack came out on Friday and this scared away the competition. This is also partially due to the fact that I'm dealing with what is clearly an alien disease. Friends came over on Saturday and one of them must have been infectious, because on Sunday my mouth tasted like salt. I Googled reasons why that could happen (never a good idea) and it turns out it could be from an infection. I used some Listerine to get rid of whatever bacteria was causing it, but the salty taste overpowered the flavor of the Listerine. That tells you how strong the salty taste was. The next day, the salty taste wasn't as bad, but my throat was killing me. I figured it was Strep throat. The next day, the salty taste was gone, my throat felt fine, but my sinuses were so clogged that the sinus pressure was making my teeth hurt. The next day, the sinus pressure was down dramatically, but I had sneezing attacks ever few minutes, including while I was trying to sleep. Today, the sneezing isn't as bad, but I have a bad cough and it feels like I broke a rib while sneezing. Clearly this isn't a normal cold, but instead I believe I am the subject of an alien experiment. Regardless, the best new release of the week is The Legend of Korra: Book Four: Balance and the DVD or Blu-ray is absolutely worth picking up. However, the best release on this week's list is The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. I finally got to the review of the Blu-ray Combo Pack and it is the Pick of the Week. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for December 16th, 2014\n\nDecember 16th, 2014\n\nIt is getting very close to Christmas and while this means there are more and more people shopping, it also means the new releases are less likely to stand out in a sea of sales. The biggest release of the week is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is coming out on a 3D Blu-ray Combo Pack. However, it is also one of the worst big releases of the year. There are some releases that are contenders for Pick of the week, including Extant: Season 1 on DVD or Blu-ray, Tootsie on Blu-ray, and The Americans: Season 2 on DVD. In the end, I went with The Skeleton Twins on Blu-ray. More...\n\nFeatured TV on DVD Review: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete First Season\n\nOctober 4th, 2014\n\nThis is the fourth Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series and the third animated series. Season three has already started airing on TV and the first season was previously released on three separate volumes, while I reviewed the first DVD release from Season Two. Yeah, it's a bit of a mess. Since this DVD has been released previously, the real question is whether or not it is worth the double-dip? Or if it is worth picking up for those who missed it the first time. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Will Summer End this Weekend?\n\nAugust 14th, 2014\n\nThe strong opening by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles allowed summer to be extended one more weekend. This week three films look to avoid flopping, thus signaling the end of summer, but in order to do so, they must defy critics. The Expendables 3 is the biggest of the three films opening this weekend, but the franchise appears to be on a downward trajectory. Let's Be Cops opened on Wednesday, but with simply awful reviews, the word-of-mouth could kill it by the time the weekend starts. Finally, The Giver is the latest Young Adult adaptation, but this genre has produced more flops than even midlevel hits. Frankly, the most interesting aspect of the weekend box office will likely be milestones reached by Guardians of the Galaxy and other movies, rather than the new releases. This weekend last year was also arguably the the end of summer. The Butler was the only movie to make more than $20 million, while three of the four wide releases opened in fifth place or weaker. It looks like 2014 will continue its winning streak. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Turtles Topple Guardians\n\nAugust 11th, 2014\n\nDespite earning some of the worst reviews of the summer, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles easily won the race for the top of the box office chart unseating Guardians of the Galaxy, which earned some of the best reviews. The rest of the new releases were well back. Overall, the box office was down from last weekend, but by less than 0.5% to $185 million. Compared to last year, the box office was 16% higher, which is a great result. Year-to-date, 2014 is still behind 2013, but the deficit was down to 4.4% or $300 million at $6.52 billion to $6.82 billion.
