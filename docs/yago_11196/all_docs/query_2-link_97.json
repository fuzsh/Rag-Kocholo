        "text": "As we’ve gotten closer to the release of the Ratchet & Clank movie, friends and fans alike have been kind enough to reach out and tell me how excited they are. It’s an exciting time—Ratchet and Clank, two characters who have meant so much to people (yours truly included), will finally have their day in the theaters. But as some of you have noticed, I haven’t been talking much about the film on social media. I haven’t done any press or appeared on panels. When I’ve tweeted about R&C, it’s always been about the game (which I wrote with the talented Jon Paquette). The reason is that I didn’t want to dive into the behind-the-scenes stuff and risk worrying people when there is no reason to be. But I feel like a bit of a sham dancing around people wishing me congratulations for the final product, so it’s become clear I should explain:\n\nI left the Ratchet & Clank movie over two years ago.\n\nThis won’t be a huge surprise to some, as I have mentioned it on Twitter a few times. But I’ve spent the majority of my time dancing around it for fear of what people might say. I wrote the original draft of the script, but it’s since been handed off to director Kevin Munroe and writer Gerry Swallow. If anyone deserves credit or accolades for the final product, it’s them.\n\nSo why did I leave? Well, it was a combination of things. The first and most important was schedule. I’ve been fortunate enough to work on a ton of studio projects since leaving Insomniac, and all of that takes time. At the time that Ratchet was moving into production, I had jumped into my Fox project (The Men Who Kill) while also working on a Disney project and a New Line project. I never want my output to be anything less than 100%, so I needed to make some tough decisions. My contract for Ratchet was wrapping up, and it seemed like a good time to pass off the baton.\n\nThe other reason was a simple difference of opinion. The director and I agreed on a lot of things, but there were just as many things we didn’t see eye to eye on. This happens on pretty much every project in development, so it’s very normal. No one is ever right or wrong. I didn’t create the Ratchet franchise, so I certainly have no hold or authority over its story, characters, or tone—and Kevin deserved to have his handcuffs taken off so he could create his own unique vision for the movie universe. He’s a talented director and it was a very amicable split, so I wish him and the team the best. I know that seems like a recycled line, but it’s the truth.\n\nMy fingerprints are still on the movie, and several of my jokes and plot points are still in (hence you’ll still see my name in the credits). What isn’t mine was made by people who truly love the universe. And remember—the good folks at Insomniac have been there watching and helping to guide Kevin and Rainmaker through the process.\n\nAs for me, I’m not sure if I’ll return to R&C any time soon—but never say never. I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for those characters, so it’s hard to say goodbye. For now I am focused on The Men Who Kill, Popeye, and a few other projects I am excited to tell you about. Even as a former writer for one of the greatest game franchises out there, I hope you’ll stick with me.\n\nIn the meantime, I’m excited to see the final cut of the movie."
