        "text": "Hong Kong (September 13, 2007) – An exclusive interview with director Kevin Munroe will appear on IMAGI Animation Studios' website – www.IMAGI.com.hk – starting September 13 at 5pm (Hong Kong time). To be posted in the “What's New” section, Munroe answers questions for the first time about his upcoming CG-animated motion picture, Gatchaman.\n\nMunroe, who made his feature film directorial debut with IMAGI's TMNT, has spent the last decade in the animation industry, working on television shows, feature films, comic books and video games.\n\nGatchaman, scheduled for release in early 2009, originated in Japan in the 1970s as the television series Science Ninja Team Gatchaman. Aired in the U.S. as Battle of the Planets and G-Force, it soon became a top syndicated TV show.\n\nFeaturing some of the most ambitious action sequences ever seen in animation, Gatchaman is a big, effects- rich movie set in a future world grappling with environmental and technological issues. The story focuses on five reluctant heroes whose remarkable genetic code makes them Earth's only hope of defeating extra- terrestrial invaders.\n\nwww.IMAGI.com.hk"
