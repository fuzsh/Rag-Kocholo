        "text": "I know a good percentage of you guys have never read Dylan Dog, the Italian horror comic that is the basis for the upcoming movie “>Dead of Night, but that ignorance shouldn’t prevent you from looking forward to the film. It sure isn’t dampening my anticipation of it!\n\nSTYD got to chat up Dead of Night director Kevin Munroe recently and he revealed that they’re on track for a hopeful January start date for shooting; right now he’s working with an as-yet unnamed makeup effects artist to create all the monsters that make up Dylan’s world.\n\n“We’ve got werewolves, zombies and vampires – and a few sub-categories of those,” Munroe told the site. “His world is everything and the kitchen sink so with this one we don’t have anything quite as broad as, say, Hellboy II where you go to the [Troll Market] with different creatures, but here it’s a little bit more classic for the first movie and in the second [film] you go a bit deeper.”\n\nYes, they are hoping for more Dead of Night films, the continuing adventures of Dylan Dog, but nothing is locked in place yet, unfortunately. Expect to hear more casting news very soon as pre-production edges closer to a start date!\n\n– Johnny Butane\n\n“>CHECK OUT DREAD CENTRAL’S NEW POSTER STORE!\n\nGot news?
