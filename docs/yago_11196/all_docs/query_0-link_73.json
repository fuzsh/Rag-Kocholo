        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Second Chance Cinema on Spotify. TMNT is a 2007 computer-animated superhero film written and directed by Kevin Munroe (in his feature directorial debut). It is the fourth theatrical Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and a standalone sequel to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993).[6] The first animated film in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, it features an ensemble voice cast including Chris Evans, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mako, Kevin Smith, Patrick Stewart, and Ziyi Zhang with narration by Laurence Fishburne. In the film, after having grown apart following the final defeat of their arch-enemy, the Shredder, the four Turtles — Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo (voiced respectively by James Arnold Taylor, Nolan North, Mitchell Whitfield, and Mikey Kelley) — are set to reunite and overcome their faults to save the world from evil ancient creatures. A computer-animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film was first announced in 2000, with John Woo supposedly directing, but the project languished in development hell, and Woo ultimately moved on to other projects. The choice to do the film in CGI instead of live action like the prior Turtles films was to have audiences suspend their beliefs easier as well as to save budget. When writing TMNT, Munroe wanted to divert away from the lighthearted elements of the franchise and put a heavier emphasis on the darker tone of the original comics. The animators that worked on the fight sequences were inspired by Hong Kong action films. TMNT was released theatrically in the United States on March 23, 2007, by Warner Bros. Pictures, and in Hong Kong, on March 29 by Gold Scene. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but it was a small commercial success, grossing over $95 million worldwide against a budget of $34 million. Planned sequels were cancelled after Nickelodeon acquired the franchise in 2009, rebooting the film series with the live-action film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 2014.   Teenage turtles fight amongst each other and, yet, they still save the world  -SPRO   Cowabunga, dude Four turtles.
