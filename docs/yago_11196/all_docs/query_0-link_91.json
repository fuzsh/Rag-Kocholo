        "text": "For many years, fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been eagerly awaiting the return of their beloved turtles on the big screen.\n\nBut is TMNT coming back in 2023?\n\nFrom the release date, voice actors to the storyline, hereâ€™s what we know about the essential details.\n\nIs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) Coming Back In 2023?\n\nYes, the highly anticipated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming back in 2023.\n\nIt is a new CGI-animated adventure film featuring the four Turtle Ninja brothers: Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo.\n\nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem was announced in June 2020, a few years after the release of TMNT: Out of the Shadows (2016).\n\nIt leaves Turtle fans with different expectations of what our favorite Heroes in a Half-Shell must bring.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Release Date\n\nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem release date is set for August 2, 2023, Wednesday [1].\n\nThe release date was previously announced to be on August 4, Friday, but Paramount has decided to release the movie a bit earlier.\n\nThe Mutant Mayhem is supposed to be a part of a trilogy, the last film installment next to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) and TMNT: Out of the Shadows (2016).\n\nTMNT Storyline\n\nThe storyline of TMNT: Mutant Mayhem would focus on the teenage aspect of the Turtle Heroes, according to the film's producer, Seth Rogen.\n\nIn this film, April O'Neil, a human reporter, and friend, helps the Turtle brothers with their heroic acts as they aim to be accepted by New Yorkers.\n\nWho Makes This Movie?\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle: Mutant Mayhem is developed and made by Paramount Pictures, Point Grey Productions, and Nickelodeon Movies.\n\nFrom Point Grey, we have Seth Rogen, James Weaver, and Evan Goldberg to work on the story production.\n\nThese producers teamed up with Ramsay Naito and Jason McConnell, who have been overseeing the project for Nickelodeon Animation and Paramount Animation. Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears direct the film.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2023 Casts\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2023 cast is Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, and Micah Abbey as Donatello [2].\n\nThe action movie icon, Jackie Chan, will play Master Splinter, while Ayo Edebiri from 'The Bear' will be the human reporter, April O'Neil.\n\nOther mutant characters who could be a friend or a foe will be Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), and Ray Fillet (Post Malone).\n\nCheck out our cool TMNT party ideas here.\n\nIs There A 5th Ninja Turtle?\n\nYes, there is a fifth Ninja Turtle aside from the classic Turtle brothers consisting of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Her name is Jennika, and she used to be a human, unlike the four brothers, who are already turtles.\n\nHer appearance on Mutant Mayhem has yet to be confirmed, but many fans positively respond to her as the team's fifth member. Here are some cool TMNT gift ideas.\n\nWill TMNT 2023 Be Live-Action?\n\nNo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a fully CG-animated film and not a live-action, contrary to the original plan for the movie.\n\nThe Ninja Turtles first appeared in a live-action film trilogy in the 1990s. But in 2007, Kevin Munroe wrote and directed the first computer-animated film of the Turtle brothers.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, TMNT returned to a live-action reboot trilogy by Michael Bay, which Mutant Mayhem is supposed to be part of as the third installment.\n\nWho Is Shredder In TMNT 2023?\n\nDetails about the Shredder, the fearsome main villain of the TMNT franchise, have yet to be officially revealed by the Mutant Mayhem makers.\n\nInstead, we can expect Baxter Stockman portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito, to play the main villain in the movie.\n\nOther characters who may cause trouble for the Turtle brothers are Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Superfly (Ice Cube), and Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph).\n\nBebop and Rocksteady, the dimwitted duo, are also present, portrayed by the movie's producer, Seth Rogen, and WWE superstar, John Cena, respectively.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs there going to be a TMNT: The Last Ronin movie?\n\nNo, there is currently no news if TMNT: The Last Ronin will be adapted into a movie. The Last Ronin is a comic that follows the story of Michelangelo in a post-apocalyptic world after his beloved brothers and father are long gone.\n\nHowever, Magnus Edlund posted a fan-made animation on the YouTube channel Speedokaggen in 2022 based on The Last Ronin's story.\n\nIs there a yellow Ninja Turtle?\n\nYes, there is a yellow Ninja Turtle. She is Jennika, the fifth member of the Ninja Turtles and a former Foot assassin.\n\nShe transformed into a mutant turtle after Leonardo and Donatello gave her their blood in an attempt to save her life.\n\nIs there an evil Ninja Turtle?\n\nNo, there is no evil Ninja Turtle among the four brothers. But there was a character named Slash introduced in the 1990s. He is sometimes presented as a villain, but he also acts as an ally to the brothers sometimes.\n\nHe was referred to as the fifth turtle before Jennika.\n\nFinal Say\n\nThe release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is undoubtedly exciting news for fans of all ages.\n\nBut as we await the movie release, let us have fun first with our family and friends with this Monopoly Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Board Game.\n\nWe also offer a wide variety of officially licensed TMNT merchandise that we ship for free within the US (except Alaska and Hawaii).\n\nReferences:"
