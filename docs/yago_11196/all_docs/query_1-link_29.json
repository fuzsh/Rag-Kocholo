        "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). Directed by Steve Barron, 1 hr. 33 min., PG, action/adventure/comedy\n\nIn New York mysterious radioactive ooze has mutated four sewer turtles into talking, upright-walking, crime-fighting ninjas. The intrepid heroes—Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo—are trained in the Ninjutsu arts by their rat sensei, Splinter. When a villainous rogue ninja, who is a former pupil of Splinter, arrives and spreads lawlessness throughout the city, it’s up to the plucky turtles to stop him.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023). Directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears, 1 hr. 39 min., PG, animation/action/adventure\n\nAfter years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend, April O’Neil, helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate.\n\nArrive at 6 pm to participate in a scavenger hunt to win one of four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles street decks, inspired by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, courtesy of our sponsor Bear Walker!\n\nWhether you are searching for a clue that could lead you to your next skateboard or searching for the perfect place to sit, be sure to stop by the Kono Pizza food truck (menu) located next to East Café.\n\nWhere do I park? Can I bring my dog? How about picnics? What happens if it rains?
