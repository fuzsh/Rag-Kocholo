        "text": "The upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from Seth Rogan has finally received an official title and a new release date. The film will be titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and will come out on August 4. 2023, in the United States.\n\nLast year, the film was set to release on August 11, 2023. However, the movie will come out a week earlier according to the new date. The movie also got new artwork which certainly looks cool and gives a comic book vibe.\n\nThe film is directed by Jeff Rowe and produced by Rogen. Rogen has said before that the movie will focus more on the teenage aspect of the film. The film is the seventh theatrical Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, as well as the second reboot of the series. It is co-produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio with Paramount as distributor.\n\nThe CGI-animated movie will be followed up by more TMNT movies focusing on the franchise’s villains. A number of spinoff films were announced in February 2022 during Viacom CBS Investor Day, which will premiere exclusively on Paramount+ starting next year. These movies will be unrelated to Rogen’s reboot of the franchise.\n\n2007’s TMNT directed by Kevin Munroe was the first film in the franchise to be made using CGI. Rogan’s film will be the second to use this method. Another reboot from the studio is in the works, written by Colin Jost and his brother Michael Bay as producer. The film is going to be live-action, however, and not many details are know as of now.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles began as a comic book and was created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984. The comic books tell the story of four anthropomorphic turtle brothers who are adept in ninjutsu. They fight crime in New York City against enemies such as Baxter Stockman, Krang, and the Shredder. An animated series was made in 1987 that launched the characters into the mainstream, becoming one of the most popular animated series in history."
