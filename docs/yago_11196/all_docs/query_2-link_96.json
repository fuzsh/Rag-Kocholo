        "text": "My nephew brought a DVD version of 2007’s TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) to a recent holiday visit and we watched it twice. One side of the disc was widescreen (true to the theatrical release aspect ratio) and the other was fullscreen (sides cut off for the shape of old television sets, a crime to movies). Watching this movie, which is now 10 years old, reminds me of a time when I had no problem watching the same movie on repeat like some children do. I also realized I can still do that today as long as I like the movie enough which brings me to TMNT. This film served as a sequel to the original live action films (1990, 1991, and 1993), yet was animated and voiced by some notable actors including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Chris Evans, Patrick Stewart, and Laurence Fishburne. The film shows what the turtles have been up to without fighting crime together, explores a challenging sibling rivalry dynamic, and as an evil is introduced, gives the four brothers a chance to unite and save the day.\n\nAs a PG rated film, the violence is kid-friendly, comic book style, and uses a secondary animation style for flashbacks that is a welcome mix. Each of the turtles personalities are clearly defined, showcased, and used to setup the tension and comradery between them. It also sets up for some laughs, the animation of fight scenes works great with the detail of the city, jungle, and creatures, and has a quick pace which works well for the stand alone adventure set in a larger universe. The film is animated by Imagi Animation Studios who also made Highlander: The Search for Vengeance (2007) and Astro Boy (2009), and is written and directed by Kevin Munroe who most recently made Ratchet & Clank (2016) and is next making Troll: The Tale of a Tail. The characters were originally created by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman and were first published in a comic in May 1984. The voice actors are no strangers to animated productions. Sarah Michelle Gellar also voiced in Happily N’Ever After (2006), Chris Evans in Battle for Terra (2007), Patrick Stewart in Bambi 2 (2006), and Laurence Fishburne in Osmosis Jones (2001).\n\n2007, PG, 1h 27m\n\nDistributor – Warner Bros.\n\nBudget / Worldwide Box Office (in millions) – $34 / $95\n\nLinks\n\nIMDB – 6.3"
