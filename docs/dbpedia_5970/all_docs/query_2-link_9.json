        "text": "Drew Barrymore (born February 22, 1975, Culver City, California, U.S.) is an American actress, producer, and director who transitioned from child star to leading lady and is especially known for her work in romantic comedies.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nBarrymore comes from a long line famous actors, most notably her grandfather John Barrymore and his siblings Lionel and Ethel. She appeared in several television movies before making her film debut in Altered States (1980). In 1982 she became famous for her performance as the adorable Gertie in Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. Later that year Barrymore, at age seven, became the youngest-ever host of the television show Saturday Night Live. In 1984 she appeared in the thriller Firestarter, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel, and in Irreconcilable Differences, for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination for her supporting role as a child who sues her business-oriented parents for emancipation.\n\nBarrymore’s roles as a teenager took on a harder edge, perhaps motivated by the troubled reality of her adolescence; as she discussed in her autobiography Little Girl Lost (1990), by age 13 she had to seek treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. In the early 1990s she was cast in such roles as the seductive teen in Poison Ivy (1992); the abused and violent Anita Minteer in Guncrazy (1992), for which she earned another Golden Globe nomination; and the lead in The Amy Fisher Story (1993), a television movie that was based on the true story of a teenage girl who shot her lover’s wife. In 1995 Barrymore’s career shifted with the formation of her own production company, Flower Films. The next year she also attracted attention for her work in Woody Allen’s musical Everybody Says I Love You and Wes Craven’s hit thriller Scream.\n\nIn 1998 Barrymore moved to romantic comedy, starring in The Wedding Singer as the humble waitress Julia, who is torn between her rude fiancé and the funny and considerate wedding singer (played by Adam Sandler) who befriends her. She continued as a romantic lead in Ever After (1998), a Cinderella-like story, and Never Been Kissed (1999), which she also executive produced.\n\nBarrymore produced and starred in the popular Charlie’s Angels (2000) and its sequel, Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle (2003), which were based on the 1970s television series; her costars were Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. In 2001 Barrymore played a teacher in the sci-fi cult classic Donnie Darko (2001), which starred Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled teenage boy who talks to an oversized rabbitlike creature. Barrymore’s other films included the comic thriller Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the environmentally themed drama Big Miracle (2012), and the romantic comedies 50 First Dates (2004), Fever Pitch (2005), Music and Lyrics (2007), He’s Just Not That Into You (2009), and Going the Distance (2010).\n\nIn 2009 Barrymore made her debut as a film director with the coming-of-age tale Whip It, about a rebellious teenager who joins a Roller Derby team. She again starred with Sandler in the romantic farce Blended (2014), in which the two portrayed single parents who take their children on an African vacation. She was cast opposite Toni Collette in the sentimental drama Miss You Already (2015), about two best friends coping with illness and the complications of family life. In the comedy The Stand In (2020), Barrymore appeared in dual roles.\n\nIn addition to her big-screen work, Barrymore starred as the reclusive socialite “Little Edie” Bouvier Beale in the television movie Grey Gardens, which was based on the 1975 documentary by Albert and David Maysles. For her performance in the acclaimed drama—which also featured Jessica Lange—she won a Golden Globe Award. She later starred with Timothy Olyphant in the Netflix series Santa Clarita Diet (2017–19), playing a realtor who becomes a zombie. In 2019 she was a judge on the TV series The World’s Best, an international talent show. The following year she began hosting The Drew Barrymore Show, a daytime talk show that aired on CBS."
