        "text": "It's been almost two decades since Drew Barrymore last kicked butt with Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz on the big screen.\n\nAnd while she's currently dominating the small screen with her synonymous daytime talk show and brand-new Netflix children's series Princess Power, Drew weighed in on whether she'd be interested in reuniting with her Charlie's Angels co-stars for a potential third installment.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exclusively told E! News correspondent Carolina Bermudez on the Feb. 7 episode of E! News (airing tonight at 11 p.m. on E!). But the 47-year-old would only do it if her fellow Princess Power executive producer, Today co-host Savannah Guthrie, joined in on the action.\n\nAfter Savannah asked Drew, \"Can I get a cameo?\" she enthusiastically responded, \"You have to be one of the Angels,\" adding, \"Me and Savannah and Cameron and Lucy in 2025, probably...most likely.\"\n\nIn addition to starring in 2001's Charlie's Angels and its 2003 sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle—both based on the 1970s TV show of the same name—Drew also served as a producer on both films.\n\nAnd just like Charlie's Angels, Drew and Savannah's new kids' show Princess Power features a female leading cast.\n\nBased on Savannah and co-author Allison Oppenheim's books Princesses Wear Pants and Princesses Save the World, the show follows four princesses from different kingdoms as they work together to make their world a better place.\n\nHear more from Drew and Savannah on E! News tonight, Feb. 7, at 11 p.m. on E!.\n\nPrincess Power is now streaming on Netflix."
