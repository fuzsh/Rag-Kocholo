        "text": "Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler touch people’s hearts in their romantic comedy film 50 First Dates. Directed by Peter Segal, the 2004 film follows the story of a marine veterinarian who falls in love with an art teacher diagnosed with short-term memory loss that causes her to forget everything that happens when she falls asleep.\n\nThe film also stars Dan Aykroyd, Blake Clark, Lusia Strus, Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.\n\nBarrymore stars in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind as Penny Pacino. Together with Sam Rockwell and George Clooney, the flick retells the story of Chuck Barris’ unauthorized autobiography of the same name as he works as an assassin for the CIA outside his career in Hollywood. It highlights his claims about killing 33 people behind cameras.\n\nFollowing her appearance in E.T., Barrymore wowed her fans again with her performance in Firestarter.\n\nHer character in the 1984 film has pyrokinesis, which allows her to create and control fire through her mind. When it becomes public, The Shop — a secret government agency — begins pursuing her to control her.\n\nThe flick stars Barrymore as Charlie McGee, and David Keith, Martin Sheen, Heather Locklear, Freddie Jones and Moses Gunn are also part of the cast.\n\nBarrymore stars as Josie Geller in Raja Gosnell’s Never Been Kissed. Her character is a 25-year-old who works as a copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times. As part of her job, she enrolls at her former high school and eventually falls in love with her English teacher.\n\nJessica Alba, Michael Vartan, David Arquette and Leelee Sobieski are among the cast members.\n\nBarrymore plays a small role in the hit 1996 Wes Craven-directed film Scream, but her appearance is one of its highlights.\n\nThe film is about the infamous masked knife maniac who stalks high school students. The serial killer then finds Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her friends, making them his next targets."
