        "text": "Some people simply have a wicked sense of humor. According to Drew Barrymore, Hugh Grant is one of those people. Barrymore defended Grant on her talk show, The Drew Barrymore Show, after the actor called her singing “horrendous” in their 2007 film, Music and Lyrics: “He is a hilarious, good human being.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIn a Wired video interview posted to YouTube last week, Grant did not mince words when describing Barrymore’s vocal talent in Music and Lyrics. The film stars Grant as Alex Fletcher, an aging former boy band member who teams up with Sophie Fisher, Barrymore’s aspiring lyricist, in hopes of reinvigorating his waning career. “Drew Barrymore was in that film with me, and I don’t think she’d mind me saying her singing is just horrendous,” said Grant, laughing. “I’ve heard dogs bark better than she sings.” Grant also disparaged his own singing in the clip, saying that though he wasn’t auto-tuned “as much” as Barrymore, she still ended up sounding “way better” than he did.\n\nWhile some might call that comment flat-out rude, Barrymore took the jab in stride in conversation with TV personality Ross Mathews on her talk show. “If you know Hugh, like, that is his way of loving you,” said Barrymore on Friday. She also discussed the awkward exchange between Grant and Ashley Graham at the Oscars. “There’s, like, this thing going around with, like, him and Ashley Graham on the red carpet, and people are like, ‘Oh, he’s such a curmudgeon and she’s so thrown,’” said Barrymore. “I’m like, No, that is Hugh Grant. You think you’re getting this charming movie star, and what you really get is grumpy Hugh. And then you fall in love with grumpy Hugh.”\n\nBarrymore doubled down on defending Grant’s sardonic sense of humor. “When he says that, I’m telling you, he is being absolutely funny. He doesn’t mean one negative thing about it,” said Barrymore. “The person that Ashley Graham met on that carpet is the real Hugh.” Mathews pointed out that Barrymore’s “happy puppy”-like personality seems at odds with Grant’s grumpy demeanor, and asked Barrymore how the two were able to gel. “Well, it took me a second,” Barrymore admitted. “I was like, Oh, no. I love you. I want to love you. You’re not letting me love you. And then as I got to know him, I was like, I do love you. I love you for the real you.”\n\nDespite Barrymore’s vocals and mixed reviews, Music and Lyrics was a box office hit, raking in nearly $146 million worldwide. Grant and Barrymore have remained friendly as well; in 2021, Grant came on The Drew Barrymore Show and spoke fondly of the film. “I love to hate the films I’ve been in, and I do hate some of them,” Grant said on the talk show. “But Music and Lyrics, it’s impossible to hate. We’re so good in it and so charming.”\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nHollywood\n\nHow Real Tornados Tormented the Making of Twisters\n\nLee Isaac Chung, director of the Twister sequel, wanted to shoot in Oklahoma during storm season: “I was very naive.”\n\nMovies\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Writing a Memoir Because She’s “Mad as Hell”\n\nIn a statement to People, Minnelli expressed disappointment with other representations of her life and revealed that she’s releasing a memoir set to hit stands in spring of 2026: “It’s my own damn story.”\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M. Chu are reportedly attached to helm the film for Universal.\n\nHollywood\n\nDan Stevens Is Down to Get Weird\n\nMore than a decade after leaving Downton Abbey, the Cuckoo star reflects on what he’s learned—and passed on to costar Hunter Schafer: “I think it was refreshing and delightful for her to realize that not every job needs to be like Euphoria.”\n\nHollywood\n\nInside Kamala Harris’s Loyal Circle of Hollywood Friends\n\n“I used to say, ‘I wish voters saw the Kamala we know.’ And I feel like in the last 24 hours, more people are.”\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ewan Mitchell Is Channeling Tony Soprano and Robert De Niro\n\nMitchell, who plays the one-eyed Prince Aemond, drops by Still Watching to chat about his character’s motivations and surprising vulnerability.\n\nTelevision\n\nTom Sandoval Sues Ariana Madix For Sharing Proof That He Cheated on Her\n\nMadix’s lawyer responds that Sandoval is continuing to “torment” his ex with an “abhorrent” suit, which accuses Madix of invasion of privacy and distribution of explicit videos featuring Sandoval and their former Vanderpump Rules castmate Rachel Leviss.\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season."
