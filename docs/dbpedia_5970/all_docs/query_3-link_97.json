Thankfully, their names have been changed to protect the nongoofballs.\n\nGreg Ferrian of Mendota Heights becomes “Karl Hootkin,” who travels to Alaska to help an international effort to free three whales trapped in the ice. James LeGros plays Hootkin with an accent and degree of goofiness that make the characters in “Fargo” look like they’re in a documentary. That, and liberties Ferrian feared would be taken with the story he participated in, had him nervous about seeing the movie. To his surprise, he’s a big fan of “Big Miracle.”\n\n“Honestly, I think it’s going to be a hit,” said Ferrian, a manufacturer’s representative in microelectronics. “I think people my age (55) will want to see it and my grandkids will want to see it.”\n\n“Big Miracle” is based on “Freeing the Whales,” a book that describes events in October 1988, when the plight of a trio of California gray whales dubbed Fred, Wilma and Pebbles became a global phenomenon. Ferrian heard about it the way everyone did: on the news.\n\n“I came home from work, and I was watching TV while I was changing my clothes. It happened to be a slow day on the news, and I saw this story about the whales,” Ferrian said. “A light bulb went off immediately that I had a solution.”\n\nThe solution was the Kasco De-icer, called the Hootkin De-icer in the film. Invented by Ferrian’s father-in-law, Bill Skluzacek, it was introduced in the early 1970s to keep boats and docks free of ice. Instantly, Ferrian was convinced the de-icer was the solution to freeing the whales, and within 15 minutes and a couple of phone calls, he was speaking to one of the key figures on the ice in remote Barrow, Alaska, where the drama was taking place.\n\n“The whole thing is amazing to me,” Ferrian said. “It still doesn’t make sense how it all happened – back in those days, not having cellphones and all.”\n\nAlthough, if cellphones had been in common usage, Ferrian probably wouldn’t have found himself on that same Barrow ice within days. Skluzacek was at a convention on the East Coast and unreachable by phone. Decision-makers in Alaska were available by phone but were not convinced the Kasco de-icer, basically a fan that churns around water to keep slush and ice from forming, would do the job. So Ferrian did what he had to do. He lied.\n\n“We raided the family bank account for $3,500 bucks. And I told my brother-in-law, Rick, they wanted us up there – it was kind of a white lie – and he and I headed up,” Ferrian said.\n\nOnce Ferrian and Rick Skluzacek, 51, of Cottage Grove arrived in Alaska, it still took a lot of convincing. But as the movie shows, within hours of putting the de-icer to use, the slush was cleared and the whales had room to breathe. Kasco’s $3,500 was never reimbursed, but the company ended up getting lots of free advertising.\n\nMany details in the film are fictionalized. For instance, “Big Miracle” shows the characters based on Ferrian and Rick Skluzacek, who is wackily named “Dean Glowacki,” showing up well after reporters turned it into a worldwide story. They actually arrived early in the effort, staying for 10 days. And the job of helicoptering a generator to the whales’ ice hole wasn’t as perilous as it looks in the film. But on balance, Ferrian says he was pleasantly surprised by the movie when he saw it at a screening in Washington, D.C., last week.\n\n“I went in with a negative attitude. My wife kept reminding me the story was ‘inspired by’ rather than the real story, but I couldn’t get to that point because I’d been there,” said Ferrian, who was interviewed by the filmmakers and visited the Alaska set in October 2010. “Then, afterward, I came out with a smile on my face. I needed to understand the Hollywood thought process, and that finally hit me somewhere toward the middle of the movie.”\n\nHe was still smiling when a stranger came up to him after the screening and said, as Ferrian recalled, ” ‘Before I introduce myself, I want you to promise not to hit me.’ He was the screenwriter who wrote Carl, the one based on me. He said he went to school in Madison and that after a few beers, he and his college buddies used to joke around and do the ‘Fargo’ accent, so he had to get it in the movie.”\n\nWhich explains what that ridiculous “Minnesota” accent is doing in “Big Miracle.” But Ferrian, who had no previous interest in whales and never considered himself much of an environmentalist, cannot account for what drew him to Fred, Wilma and Pebbles in the first place.\n\n“I honestly have no clue. I’ve wondered about it,” Ferrian said. “But none of this makes sense other than there’s some kind of magic about whales.”\n\nChris Hewitt can be reached at 651-228-5552 or follow him on twitter.com/ChrisHMovie.\n\nOriginally Published: February 4, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
