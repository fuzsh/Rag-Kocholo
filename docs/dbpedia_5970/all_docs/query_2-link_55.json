        "text": "Drew Barrymore got an emotional surprise on the set of her talk show Thursday.\n\nThe actress, 48, staged a reunion with her former \"Bad Girls\" co-stars Andie MacDowell and Mary Stuart Masterson from the 1994 Western film, but there was one more person she hadn't planned on coming — Dermot Mulroney.\n\nCovering her face with her hands, she cried as she embraced Mulroney, 60.\n\n\"I'm so happy to see you, I might cry,\" Mulroney told Barrymore.\n\nThe two shared a tissue as they took a seat on a couch.\n\n\"Oh my God, Dermot, I was just watching you in 'Anyone But You' — which I love, by the way. It's such a good movie,\" Barrymore told Mulroney.\n\nBarrymore then revisited the cast's time on \"Bad Girls,\" praising Mulroney for being \"so kind\" to her at the time.\n\n\"You were so good to me. I really was a lost 17-year-old,\" Barrymore, who has been open about her challenging childhood, said. \"I was having so much fun, but I didn’t know how to take care of myself. And you took such good care of me.\"\n\nShe told the audience: \"I mean, I was wild, guys. I was really, really wild.\"\n\nThe \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" actor called Barrymore an \"incredible survivor\" before apologizing to the audience for crying: \"Sorry guys, I cry now. I knew I was gonna and I came anyway. I decided I’m gonna go ahead and cry in public.\"\n\nMulroney and Barrymore starred in the 1994 drama with Madeleine Stowe, James Russo, Masterson and MacDowell. The film follows four sex workers who join together to travel the Old West."
