        "text": "Fans longing for a “Happy Gilmore” reprisal can rejoice — a sequel is on the way.\n\nDrew Barrymore revealed on Friday’s episode of “The Drew Barrymore Show” that the movie’s co-writer and star, Adam Sandler, is working on a screenplay for “Happy Gilmore 2.”\n\n“Variety reports that Adam Sandler may have written the first draft for ‘Happy Gilmore 2,'” Barrymore said.\n\n“I want it. I need it. And I stayed up last night with my daughter watching ‘Billy Madison,'” Barrymore said in a clip released by the show.\n\n“I sent sent [Adam] Sandler a video of that, and then he sent me another video back, and I’m waiting to see if he’s confirming about the ‘Happy Gilmore 2’ script because actor Christopher McDonald, who was Shooter McGavin … he was in the original 1996 film, but he claims that Adam recently showed him a copy of the first draft of the sequel to ‘Happy Gilmore.'”\n\nLater in the show, Barrymore looked at her phone. “This just in, I have breaking news,” she said. “I’ll just say this, from my source, that [the movie script] is in process.\n\n“There is a process, and that process is in process.”\n\nBarrymore and Sandler are good friends and have starred in three movies together: “The Wedding Singer” (1998), “50 First Dates” (2004) and “Blended” (2014).\n\nIn regard to McDonald, Barrymore was referencing a radio interview that McDonald did with “The Ken Carman Show” in Cleveland when he first broke the news about the “Happy Gilmore 2” script.\n\n“I saw Adam about two weeks ago, and he says to me, ‘McDonald, you’re gonna love this,’” he told Carman. “I said, ‘What?’ He says, ‘How about that?’ and he shows me the first draft of ‘Happy Gilmore 2.’\n\n“Maybe you should cut that because I don’t wanna be a liar,” McDonald told Carman, “but he did show me that and I thought, ‘Well, that would be awesome.\n\n“So it’s in the works. Fans demand it, damn it!”\n\nSandler starred in the 1996 cult favorite “Happy Gilmore” as an unsuccessful ice hockey player with rage issues and a foul mouth who becomes an unlikely golf hero.\n\nIn addition to McDonald, the movie featured Julie Bowen and Carl Weathers.\n\nThe fan-favorite flick is remembered for a scene in which Happy Gilmore and 72-year-old game show host Bob Barker, playing himself as Happy’s golfing partner, slugged it out on the green."
