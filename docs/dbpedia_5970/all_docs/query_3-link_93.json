        "text": "Actress | Director Born Feb. 22, 1975 in Los Angeles, CA\n\nDrew Barrymore, who hails from the multi-generational Barrymore acting dynasty, became a child star at age 6 when she appeared as the little sister Gertie in Steven Spielbergâs now-classic âE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.â\n\nMore youth roles followed, but Barrymore became prematurely sidelined by drugs and alcohol and, at age 13, entered rehab for the first time. A suicide attempt and another rehab stint followed the next year, after which she never relapsed.\n\nBarrymore reinvented herself in an eclectic series of young adult film roles. But it wasnât until 2000, when she acted in and produced (with partner Nancy Juvonen, with whom she formed Flower Films in 1995) the hit movie remake of the late-1970s TV show âCharlieâs Angels,â that the ingratiating, free-spirited Barrymore became considered a full-fledged adult movie star.\n\nA sequel to that film followed, as did roles in a string of romantic comedies, many of which she also produced. Barrymore was also the subject of the 2005 mockumentary âMy Date With Drew.â\n\nShe made her feature directorial debut with 2009âs roller derby tale âWhip It.â\n\nBarrymore was honored with Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards, as well as an Emmy nomination, for playing the eccentric âLittle Edieâ Bouvier Beale in the acclaimed 2009 HBO telefilm âGrey Gardens.â"
