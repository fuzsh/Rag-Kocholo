Three years later, Barrymore appeared on the big screen in the 1980 science fiction drama, Altered States. But it was in 1982 that the precocious, sweet-faced, blond tyke burst into the American consciousness in one of the most popular movies of all time, E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial. Playing the youngest of three children who help E.T. find his way home, Barrymore launched her film career by capturing the hearts of moviegoers of all ages.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Barrymore appeared in a wide range of big and small screen films, the best-known of which was Firestarter (1984), in which she played the petulant Charlie McGee, a little girl with telekinetic fire-starting abilities linked to her bouts of anger. But Barrymore's acting career soon took a back seat to her troubled personal life. At age nine, Barrymore had her first drink, by ten she was smoking pot, and by the time she was 12 she was hooked on cocaine. Two years later, she attempted suicide, and began a string of stints in rehab. Despite finding steady work in little-seen films such as Babes in Toyland (1986), See You in the Morning (1989), and Far From Home (1989), the caliber of Barrymore's acting disintegrated along with her personal life. Soon her tabloid appearances outnumbered her acting roles, and many saw Drew as heir to the \"Barrymore curse.\"\n\nIn 1989, the 15-year-old became the youngest person ever to publish a memoir, Little Girl Lost, which chronicled her battles with addiction. But beneath the teenager's troubles lay a steely determination to succeed in the family business. Riding the wave of publicity sparked by her memoir and a nude photo shoot in Interview, the 17-year-old Barrymore began an impressive comeback in Poison Ivy (1992), playing a part that cleverly mirrored her off-screen tabloid persona of a sluttish and seductive teen.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Barrymore was everywhere—on screen, on talk shows, on magazine covers, on billboards. And her movie career flourished. Despite a few misguided choices such as The Amy Fisher Story, America embraced Drew's bad girl persona in films such as Bad Girls and Batman Forever. But slowly more subtlety and depth began to find its way into her roles. In Boys on the Side (1995), playing the spunky Holly, one of three women who escape their lives by driving cross country together, she earned the praise of Roger Ebert who wrote that she was developing into \"an actress of great natural zest and conviction.\"\n\nEven as the wider public focused on wild Drew moments such as her chest-baring incident on The David Letterman Show, Barrymore was struggling to earn the respect of the movie industry powers-thatbe after forming her own production company, Flower Films. With her star in the ascendant, in 1996 the 21-year-old Barrymore earned critical praise for her diverse performances in Wes Craven's Scream and Woody Allen's Mad About You. As Casey Becker in Scream, Barrymore's ability to convey palpable fear set the tone for the film that many felt revitalized the horror genre. That same year, Barrymore successfully played against type as the fiancée of a proper young man in the Woody Allen musical.\n\nBarrymore's growing reputation as a competent and compelling actress led to a string of immensely popular movies. In the Cinderella remake Ever After (1997), Barrymore starred as the intelligent, spirited, book-loving, and beautiful stepdaughter who wins the heart of a prince. Barrymore's next star turn was undoubtedly her most popular film since E.T. As Julia, the warm-hearted waitress in The Wedding Singer, Barrymore's soulful spunk proved the ideal counterpoint to Adam Sandler's nerdy and forlorn Robbie Hart, and the romantic comedy became the surprise blockbuster of 1998.\n\nBy 1999, Barrymore was earning $3 million a picture, and had won the respect of Hollywood as a talented actress, an audience favorite, and one of the rare young female stars who can single-handedly carry a picture. In Never Been Kissed, Drew winningly played Josie Geller, a nerdy newspaper employee sent undercover back to high school. Though the film was not a critical success, Barrymore's star remained undimmed. From child star to troubled teen to blonde bombshell to box office gold, Drew Barrymore has spent most of her life in the public eye. But she is just now beginning to come into her own as a film actress—and one can only eagerly await the performances yet to emerge from one of the film industry's most exciting young stars.\n\n—Victoria Price"
