        "text": "Hey All!\n\nI recently had the amazing opportunity to interview the fabulous Drew Barrymore and the amazing Adam Sandler about their new film BLENDED.\n\nIt was a fun filled day that started with an advanced screening of the film, hair and make up sessions, and a delicious lunch before chatting with the stars. It was a great way to spend my day as I waited for Drew and Adam to arrive.\n\nDidn’t my hair come out great!\n\nI have always wanted to meet Drew as I’ve essentially grown up watching her in films. I actually met Adam Sandler in my NYU days as he too went to NYU. It was great to see him again all these years later. He actually remembered the event we met at way back when. We chatted with the stars about the making of the film and why they enjoy working together.\n\nBLENDED marks the third comedy collaboration between stars Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, following their successful onscreen pairings in the hit romantic comedies “50 First Dates” and “The Wedding Singer.” After a disastrous blind date, single parents Lauren (Barrymore) and Jim (Sandler) agree on only one thing: they never want to see each other again. But when they each sign up separately for a fabulous family vacation with their kids, they are all stuck sharing a suite at a luxurious African safari resort for a week.\n\nI loved the film and it has the same feeling of 50 First Dates. They have come together for yet another great film anyone who sees it will enjoy.\n\nHere is what Drew and Adam had to say about the film:\n\nSo, how did this movie come about? Why did you want to make a movie together?\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI mean, why not? I always joke that I call Adam, well when we first met I called him, because I know that we’re supposed to partner up. I just know it in my heart. And I stalked him until he accepted the ways. And then, he is always great to work with.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nIt wasn’t that hard by the way. But, it was pretty much, Drew Barrymore wants to have lunch with you. I go, all right.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nWell, that’s good. That’s nice. And then, he found, or presented, because it was his project, the Wedding Singer.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nAnd I knew reading it, I was, that’s it. That’s the one. And Adam really, really cares and scrupulously as a producer and a great writer, really makes sure that the script is tailor-made for us, and has all the things, like our strengths, or things we want to try, or things we want to put in it, or fun set pieces where you’re, like, I get to do that? Oh my gosh, this is so fun. Okay. And then, when we found 50 First Dates, I actually sat down to a typewriter and I wrote him a letter crying. And I was, like, I know this is the one. I know it. I know it. I know it. And then he got the letter.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nAnd I said I better do this, or something bad is going to happen.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI guess it was received well because we did the movie. I never questioned to be the letter or not.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nAnything you ask for I do by the way.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nReally?\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYou asked for the Wedding Singer movie. We did that, 50 First Dates.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes, that’s true.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nA year ago, or two years ago, about three years ago, right?\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nWe had lunch and she said, come on, I think it’s time we should do another movie. And then, a few months later a friend of mine, my daughter and his son are in the same class. He showed me the script, and I loved it.\n\nAnd I called Drew, I said, you got to read this script. I think this could be the one. And then, you called me that night.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes, because I sat down to read it immediately. And it was special. I locked myself in my closet and read it, which sounds weird, but it wasn’t. And I laughed and I cried, and that’s what I care about in life. I want to laugh, and I want to cry. I think laughter and crying are twins. And they’re the same thing seesawing together. And I loved that it was about kids. And so that just is where Adam is at in life. I am new to that in life. And I thought this is perfect.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes.\n\nHow has becoming parents changed what films you do, or what projects you take one?\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nWell, this is that example. You answer that better.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nOh, you know, since I had my kids, I have done some movies that are a little heavier. And I come home shook up. I did a rated-R comedy since I’ve had kids.And I definitely felt guilty every morning at breakfast. I just had a hard time knowing what was coming in the future. And them seeing that movie, and then saying you said never to do that, well, my character, you know. Both my kids have seen this movie about five times each, and they love it. And there are a couple of things in there that go over their head, and they’re not sure what anyone’s talking about, especially with the masturbating. I think. I hope. But it felt great about making this movie. It’s about respect for parenting and being a good parent, and a respect for putting your kids first, and being true. It’s hard. Look, I love my wife. And in the movie, my character was married, and his wife passed away, and it’s about moving on. And that’s a hard thing to talk about. In real life, when I’m with my wife, I tell her that’s it. It’s me and you, and god forbid anything ever happen to either one of us, I tell her, you should move on. Move on with somebody else, and have a good time. But, I tell her, that’s it. I’m done. So, when I watch the movie, I feel a little, like, ah, that’s the only thing that hurts is that my guy does move on, but it makes sense in the movie. He’s got a family. He’s got three daughters that need someone in their life other than him. And Drew just makes them feel special in a way that I can’t make them feel. And that’s it, that’s what I like about the movie.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI remember when I read it, one of my favorite lines in the movie is on their date night towards the end of the movie, and he says you’re a good mom. And she looks at him and she says you’re a good mom, too. Sorry. I actually texted him that yesterday.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes, you did, for Mother’s Day.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI did.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nAnd you said, and Jackie is, too, though.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nOf course.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nShe always shows the respect to my wife, too.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes, of course.\n\nWhat was the most emotional part of the film for you? Because I know I cried in certain parts.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nFor me, it’s weird. I think different days I experienced different things. Like reading the script I loved when Jessica’s [Lowe as Ginger] character, the son softens for a second. And she’s, like, oh my gosh, maybe we’re going to be okay. Maybe we’re going to be a good family. That just slayed me reading it. And then, the mom line, that you’re a good mom, too. But, then watching the movie, the scenes that kills me every time I’ve seen is Espn saying, mom said she had a great time. And, you know, that whole scene. I can’t even talk about it.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nOh, yes. She’s great, that kid, too.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nShe’s so good.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nEmma. She’s a great actress. She breaks your heart, that girl. And I love when Drew is singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow, and the kids are affected by it. It’s great. It’s a lot of sweetness.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nFew on that one, because when he sent me that, again, I always read my scenes. I’m, like, Adam, oh my gosh, I get to do this, and I get to do that. That’s so exciting. And that’s when I was, like, Adam, really? The most beloved song on the planet. Fine, I’ll just read it at the table read, and I’ll do it. And then, I thought that it was going to get cut, and that’s going to save us all from going down sinking ship style, and then he kept it. And I was, like, why is he keeping it.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nBecause it was sweet.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI thought, this is bad isn’t it?\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYou were saying it nice and with your heart, and that it affects the kids. And you and little Lou laying in bed together, there was nothing sweeter. And then, me outside peeing.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes. It’s the best.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nAdding to the sweetness.\n\nIt’s kind of, like, a Wedding Singer reunion. Was that planned, or was it just, something that just happened during the making of the film?\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes. Well, we know we love Director Frank Coraci.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nAnd he’s a great director, and a great friend of ours. And he was with us on Wedding Singer. He’s a great director and his energy and vibe is just totally like Drew’s. I remember Drew so many times during the Wedding Singer when we do emotional stuff, right before action, see Drew and Frank alone talking, and getting in the right place. And I was, like, oh, those two have some special connection.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nFrank’s not afraid of emotion.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nAnd for being a really good comedy director, I feel like sometimes that emotion gets lost. And if you’re tuned into emotionality, sometimes you’re not as good with the funny. And Frank is good with both.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nAnd also, grounded moments where his [Jim, played by Adam Sandler] daughter is saying, it’s okay to let mom go meets this broad comedy. That takes a skill set to be able to balance those two things, and bring them together cohesively. And Frank’s just awesome. He’s just the raddest person.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nHe’s all good energy, always happy, or sleeping after a big meal.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nAnd Adam is such a good filmmaker, and cares about every shot, and every angle, and every word, and every improv. You and Frank are good partners. You’re a good team, because you’re behind it.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nIt’s good, it’s a good combination.\n\nSo, all of your characters had a lot of big adventures in this movie, and I was wondering if you guys got to have any adventures off camera while you were on location?\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes, totally.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nOh, yes.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nIn Africa, it’s hard not to.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nEvery weekend was pretty awesome. And when we weren’t working, we went somewhere neat, and there were always animals involved. And the kids got to see everything. It’s just neat. Going out to eat there was cool.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nThere were signs on the glass of the windows, not even on the door. They were right on the glass of the windows so you wouldn’t miss it. I mean, it’s written on your window. And it was, like, do not open these windows, or monkeys will ransack your room, we’re not kidding. And, of course, everybody would forget and leave their windows opened. I’m sure some people like me were sort of, like, bring it. I want to see this. And they really would ransack the room. It looked like one of those scenes in a movie where you’d walk in, and you’re like, somebody’s been here. It was crazy. It was so cool.\n\nDo you think we’ll have to wait 10 years to see you on screen again together? We want to watch you grow old together.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nWell, we were thinking maybe, like, I don’t know. Can we afford every 10 years?\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes. I know, we’re not sure how long we got.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nSomeone asked us earlier, could we see us doing an On Golden Pond. And then, Adam said, with more jokes, yes. Which I liked.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nWe should.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes.And doesn’t she call him an old poop in the movie?\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nYes.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYou old poop.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nLake Winnepesaukah.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI know. Your favorite lake in the country.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nWinnie.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nI’m good to go. I think we should speed it up a little bit.\n\nMr. Adam Sandler:\n\nAt least every six.\n\nMs. Drew Barrymore:\n\nYes. Exactly. Six years goes by so fast. I had two kids since we had the idea for this one.\n\nThey were kind enough to take a photo with use after the interview was done.\n\nThey were so much fun to chat with and this was such a fun event for this film. We chatted with Wendi McLendon-Covey who is in BLENDED as well. Stay Tuned for that interview as well.\n\nBLENDED is in theaters May 23rd!\n\nFor more info on this fantastic Film Visit the Official Website\n\nLike on Facebook\n\nFollow on Twitter, Google+ and Tumblr with hashtag #Blended"
