        "text": "yes omg i totally noticed it! i was up late and this movie came on the other nite and i was wondering how did they get away with it? but i think this movie ended happier than mad love, and drew barrymore looked a lot better than kirsten dunst, but i think kirstens acting was a lot better.\n\nreply share\n\nI don't really find Nicole Oakley's behavior / attitude as far fetched as that of the female character in Mad Love. All things considered, Nicole seems like your normal struggling seventeen year old (with a dramatic back story). Also, I think Mad Love has a stronger Rome and Juliet complex. Anyway, I wouldn't go as far to call Crazy/Beautiful a rip off of Mad Love, but I can see where you are coming from. Good observation.\n\nreply share\n\njefftaggert2000 17 years ago\n\nThis movie was a billion times better than Mad love.\n\nreply share\n\nYeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, similar storyline to Mad Love. Except in Mad Love Drew's character had an actual serious mental illness...bipolar disorder..which does get helped with meds. Kristen's character's struggles seem more like personality disorder issues, not so uch a formal diagnosable mental illness. Kristen did good with that role.\n\nreply share\n\nThe films have similarities but that happens -- there are just a limited number of basic plots. One difference here is the racial/class issues. Chris O'Donnell as the straight edge kid isn't exactly the same as this guy. This is important since the setting is an important aspect of why this film is worthwhile.\n\nreply share\n\nI wouldn't call it a rip-off but, lets say, a remake. C/B is a lot better but ML has a nice 90's grunge feel and that's also enjoyable.\n\nreply share"
