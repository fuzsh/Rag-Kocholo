It’s 1995, grunge is sort of dead but it’s still working for movie themes. We finally review Mad Love starring Drew Barrymore and Chris O’Donnell. On this episode we talk the lure of teen romance in 90s films, the logistics of running away from home, and I pretty much drool over all the fashion and the AMAZING soundtrack.

Our off topic rants this episode include: skydiving, ridic 90s theories, and comparisons to the movie Fear.
