        "text": "KOLKATA: Opening batsman Fakhar Zaman insisted Sunday that Pakistan have not surrendered their World Cup dream, claiming “historically we don’t accept defeat.”\n\nPakistan have lost four of their six matches and need to win their remaining three games while hoping other results fall in their favor.\n\nHowever, Zaman and his teammates have been inspired by the 1992 Pakistan team which under the leadership of Imran Khan came back from losing three of their first four games to win the World Cup.\n\n“If you see, historically we don’t accept defeat,” Zaman, who is the only Pakistan batsman to score a double hundred in one-day internationals, said Sunday.\n\n“Everyone in the squad is hopeful of winning the last three matches and after the way we fought against South Africa we are sure of a comeback.”\n\nIn Chennai on Friday, South Africa survived a late charge from Pakistan to pull off a thrilling one-wicket win.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaman said he has recovered from a knee ligament injury and is available for Tuesday’s key match against Bangladesh in Kolkata.\n\n“It’s disappointing to miss matches through injury because the World Cup comes every four years and I missed last year’s Twenty20 World Cup with the same knee injury,” he said.\n\nAfter facing Bangladesh, Pakistan conclude their group stage campaign against New Zealand in Bengaluru on November 4 and England back in Kolkata seven days later.\n\nKARACHI: The Counterterrorism Department (CTD) of the police in Pakistan’s southern Sindh province announced on Saturday it had foiled a major attack planned to coincide with Pakistan’s Independence Day on August 14, following the arrest of two militants belonging to a proscribed armed group operating in the region.\n\nThe Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) is a separatist militant outfit known for its violent activities aimed at promoting Sindhi nationalism.\n\nThe group has been involved in a range of attacks, including bombings, targeted killings and sabotage of infrastructure such as railway tracks and electricity pylons.\n\nThe CTD reported it had arrested two members of the group, Jameel Sheikh and Salahuddin Jatoi, with the help of intelligence agencies while they were planning an attack in Larkana, a major urban center known historically and politically as the hometown of the Bhutto family.\n\n“The arrested terrorists had planned to bomb the central ceremony and the jail on Independence Day,” CTD Deputy Superintendent of Police Syed Asghar Shah said in a written statement.\n\n“Explosives weighing 350 grams, six detonators, a hand grenade, safety fuse, wire, nuts and bolts and black powder were recovered from the terrorists,” he added.\n\nShah said the two suspected militants were also involved in the attack on a police office with a hand grenade two months ago.\n\n“The arrested terrorists had received 15 days of training in Kandahar, Afghanistan,” he added.\n\nThe CTD announced the arrest of another SRA militant on Thursday, saying he was involved in violent activities targeting paramilitary personnel, Chinese workers and a prominent religio-political party in the country.\n\nIt reported he was arrested in Shaheed Benazirabad district, previously known as Nawabshah, along with a significant quantity of explosives and detonators, as he was planning to carry out an explosion on a train traveling from Sindh to Punjab.\n\nAll three SRA militants were said to have visited Afghanistan for training.\n\nOfficials in Islamabad have frequently accused the Taliban administration in Kabul of facilitating groups involved in cross-border attacks against Pakistani people and security forces.\n\nHowever, the Afghan government has denied the allegation and described Islamabad’s security challenges as Pakistan’s domestic issue.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday issued instructions to award one of the country’s highest civilian honors to javelin ace Arshad Nadeem, who won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics with a massive throw of 92.97 meters this week.\n\nNadeem, who hails from a poor family in a rural settlement in the central Pakistani region of Khanewal, made history by ending his country’s 32-year Olympic medal drought while setting a new Games record.\n\nHe was expected to face tight competition from other athletes, particularly India’s defending champion Neeraj Chopra, but put significant pressure on them with his record-breaking throw on the second attempt.\n\nThe Pakistani athlete stood on the winners’ podium set in Champions Park near the Eiffel Tower on Friday, with his country’s flag hoisted high and the national anthem playing in the background.\n\n“President Asif Ali Zardari has directed the awarding of Hilal-e-Imtiaz to Pakistani athlete Arshad Nadeem for his record performance in the Olympics,” an official statement announced.\n\n“The President will present the civil award to Arshad Nadeem in a special ceremony in recognition of his outstanding services in the field of sports,” it added.\n\nThe statement mentioned the Presidency had sent a letter to the Cabinet Division on Zardari’s instruction to confer the honor on the Pakistani athlete.\n\n“Arshad Nadeem has made the nation proud with his exceptional performance on the field,” Zardari was quoted as saying.\n\nHe emphasized that Nadeem’s achievement on the global stage had become a source of pride for the nation.\n\nHilal-e-Imtiaz, or Crescent of Excellence, has been conferred in the past to distinguished Pakistanis in diverse fields, including literature, arts, science and public service.\n\nISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday condemned Israel’s attack on a school in Gaza, saying it had “crossed all limits” following international media reports of nearly 100 fatalities in what appears to be one of the deadliest strikes since the war began in October last year.\n\nA civil defense official in Gaza informed the media that three Israeli rockets had targeted the school, which housed displaced Palestinians uprooted by 10 months of war in the area.\n\nHe also said the death toll was between 90 and 100, with dozens more wounded in the attack.\n\nThe Israeli military, however, said it had targeted an active “military facility,” adding that the strike had killed around 20 Hamas and Islamic Jihad members.\n\n“Israel has crossed all limits with its brutal actions,” the prime minister said in an official statement. “An attack on schoolchildren is open aggression. Such barbarity is unprecedented in history.”\n\n“The international community, including the United Nations, should take practical steps to stop Israel’s brutality,” he added.\n\nSharif prayed for all the people who lost their lives in the attack and expressed condolences to their families.\n\n“We once again reiterate our demand that the Israeli leadership and security forces be brought to justice for the genocide and war crimes against Palestinians,” he continued. “Israel should be severely punished for its cruel actions.”\n\nThe prime minister also referred to the verdict of the top United Nations court earlier this year in May wherein it ordered Israel to halt its offensive of the southern city of Rafah and withdraw from the Gaza Strip.\n\n“The International Court of Justice’s decision against Israel should be enforced,” he said.\n\nSharif also noted that Pakistan would continue to extend moral and diplomatic support to Palestinians on every front.\n\nIsrael launched its air and ground offensive targeting Gaza following the October 7 surprise attack by Hamas, in which nearly 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage.\n\nThe Palestinian group maintained its attack was in response to the deteriorating conditions faced by Palestinian people living under occupation.\n\nIsrael’s response was widely viewed as disproportionate by the international community, with nearly 40,000 people, mostly women and children, having lost their lives so far.\n\nKARACHI: The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) on Friday launched the second Global Cuisine Show in Karachi that showcased local ingredients and products in a bid to attract buyers from the Middle East and other parts of the world.\n\nThe three-day show is part of the TDAP’s International Food and Agricultural Exhibition 2024 and has brought together chefs from different parts of the world to prepare a diverse range of cuisines using Pakistani ingredients.\n\nCulinary experts from Bahrain, South Africa, Egypt, Indonesia, Maldives and Singapore took turns on the first day of the event at Expo Center Karachi to create recipes from their respective regions using Pakistani ingredients and the dishes were then served to those in attendance from various parts of the world.\n\n“The Middle East is a very important location for us because our diaspora is in the region. Our major chunk of Agro food exports goes to the Middle East,” TDAP Assistant Manager Iqra Ilyas told Arab News on Friday.\n\n“We have around 200 buyers coming from the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and all over the Gulf. We are looking forward to having more response from our Middle Eastern brothers.”\n\nChef Zahra Hussain from Bahrain said she was “very excited” to be a part of the show, and was in awe of the kind people and high-quality ingredients she witnessed in Pakistan.\n\n“This is my first visit to Pakistan but it feels very familiar and friendly to me, because there are a lot of Pakistanis in Bahrain,” she said. “They are very kind. But here, they are not only kind but friendly, lovely and helpful people.”\n\nHussain said she intended to prepare something from the Arab culture, particularly traditional Bahraini food.\n\n“I want to prepare something sweet because in Bahrain when we love somebody, we give them sweets and coffee better than the main dish. I will make sago [halwa],” she said.\n\n“It aligns with the culture of Pakistan and India. They use cardamom, saffron and rosewater. So, I have to get close to your culture to bring it closer to our culture.”\n\nThe first edition of the Global Cuisine Show took place around the same time last year and at the same location.\n\nAll of the ingredients used in the recipes prepared by a lineup of 15 international chefs are from Pakistan, according to the show organizers. The chefs have only brought the recipes with them.\n\nIbrahim Ghoush, a chef from Egypt who currently works in Saudi Arabia, decided to make American-styled chewy cookies at the global show.\n\n“I have come here to make some kind of Egyptian and international [food]. I am a professional baker but since I don’t have enough time to execute something from an artisan bakery, I decided to make cookies. They come easy, fast and tasty,” he told Arab News, assembling ingredients for the recipe.\n\nGhoush is known for innovation in European-style baked items, while he has also researched on the ancient Arab bread.\n\nWhile these foreign chefs offered cuisines from their respective regions, Pakistani food stalls remained a major attraction for foreign delegates in attendance.\n\n“It’s a very good event for marketing our food and our culture, it’s sort of food diplomacy for us,” TDAP Assistant Manager Ilyas said.\n\n“Our basic purpose is to enhance agro-export, trade and the Global Cuisine Show is one of the tools that will help us achieve it. It helped us last year as well. We did have a lot of queries from the buyers. We are very hopeful that this will pave the way for our future agro food trade.”"
