His entrepreneurial journey is marked by a devotion to excellence, innovation, and a genuine desire to empower aspiring entrepreneurs and established enterprises alike.\n\nAfif’s leadership has propelled Bizhub to the forefront of the business setup industry, positioning it as a trusted partner for those navigating the dynamic landscape of Dubai’s business environment. Through a combination of expertise, personalized service, and a forward-thinking approach, Afif Zaman has cultivated Bizhub into a beacon for individuals and organizations seeking seamless and efficient business establishment solutions in Dubai.\n\nJoin us in exploring the inspiring journey and entrepreneurial spirit of Afif Zaman, the catalyst behind Bizhub’s success, as he continues to redefine the narrative of business setup services in Dubai.\n\nWhat is your company name and contacts?\n\nBizhub | Your Friendly Business Setup Guide!\n\nWho are the founders and co-founders of the company?\n\nAfif Zaman and Nazumus Sakib\n\nA complete journey about the Bizhub? When you have started, how and where?\n\nThe inception of Bizhub AE marked its humble beginnings on February 13, 2023, when Sakib and the narrator initiated operations with just a small coffee table and two chairs. Their journey commenced in Dubai, eventually moving from place to place one time they were at All Day Market in Business Bay, Dubai, and later in Sharjah Library as they offered their services. Equipped with nothing more than their old-school laptops running Microsoft Excel and Word, they documented their initial business associations and transactions.\n\nThe concept of Bizhub emerged from the founders’ observation of the constant growth within the UAE and a realization that many people were unaware of the opportunities available. Moreover, those who were aware often found themselves misled. Originally named CAT Hub, reflecting the combination of Tourism and Advertising, the founders later decided to rebrand, as the name seemed inadvertently associated with pets and veterinary services. After a bit of evolution, Bizhub emerged, signifying a place where business is nurtured and developed.\n\nIn the early stages, the company operated with a basic website in red, black, and white. However, the founders always envisioned incorporating the colors yellow and purple, symbolizing happiness and peace, respectively, for their clients. Over time, the team expanded from two to ten individuals, prompting a move to a 220 sq/ft space in Empire Heights. As the business progressed, Bizhub attracted numerous joint venture associations, solidifying its partnerships. This journey reflects Bizhub’s evolution from a small coffee table to a flourishing business hub, symbolizing its commitment to fostering growth and success for its clients in the vibrant business landscape of the UAE.\n\nThe journey of founder and co-founders?\n\nAfif Zaman, my father, was a prosperous and diligent individual in the UAE, engaging in sub-leasing apartments and holding a managerial position in an oil field company. The pinnacle of his success took a turn in 2015 when he encountered a significant financial crisis, challenging both me and our family. In 2016, while pursuing a major in B.Arch, I found myself compelled to drop out of university due to the inability to meet the fees. Subsequently, I entered the workforce, specializing in promotions and activations. However, the experience proved to be less fulfilling, lacking the educational growth I sought. Driven by a desire for professional development, I made a pivotal decision to transition into a corporate job, believing it would provide a more conducive environment for my career aspirations.\n\nMy journey commenced with an electronics company where I initially started as an employee. After a year and a half, feeling the need for change, I made a hasty decision to leave the job. Unfortunately, this decision proved challenging as I struggled to find another opportunity amid the global impact of COVID-19. During a year of unemployment, I ventured into entrepreneurship with the concept of a mobile eco-friendly car cleaning company. Regrettably, the business faced challenges stemming from inadequate decision-making and time management, ultimately leading to its failure. Subsequently, I secured a job as a call center agent and worked for nine months. However, the difficulties of juggling responsibilities between employment and my small business led to the termination of my position.\n\nNavigating through a financial spot while attempting to balance dual responsibilities left me in a challenging situation for the next four months. However, a turning point emerged when I secured a dream job that played a pivotal role in laying the foundation for my business venture with Sakib. Joining a company formation entity, I was fortunate to find a mentor, a seasoned senior figure. Beginning as an operations executive under my manager Gaurav Rajyana, I later transitioned to a role as a sales executive.\n\nAs January drew to a close and my morale waned amid professional distinctions, I took a leap of faith, conceptualizing the formation of Bizhub. At this point, it was more than just an idea, but a vision. Despite facing doubt and peer pressure, fueled by the memory of a previous startup failure, I embarked on this new venture with determination and resilience.\n\nThe decisive push came from my manager Gaurav, serving as the final catalyst that led to the establishment of this association with my best friend, Nazumus Sakib. Sharing a strikingly similar background, Sakib also had to discontinue his studies at Murdoch University while completing his Degree Entry Program. He briefly worked alongside me as a call center agent before deciding to leave and prioritize his education. This shared journey and commitment to our respective aspirations laid the groundwork for the formation of our partnership.\n\nAs financial challenges escalated for Sakib, leading his family to return to Bangladesh, he sought employment with his family who held an advertising company in the UAE. Despite dedicating almost two years to the company, he felt a sense of stagnation in his career. During a candid conversation in the car, where he shared his frustrations, the seed for Bizhub was planted. This revelation prompted both of us to shake hands on the idea and embark on this entrepreneurial journey together.\n\nWho are your customers? and have you supplied it to anyone? what is the feedback?\n\nPrimarily targeting an international audience, our focus at Bizhub is to illustrate the opportunities for individuals to enhance their lives in the UAE. We guide them on kickstarting their voyage by either relocating their finances and companies or beginning afresh in a tax-friendly environment. In the first three months, we laid the foundation for the company, ensuring stability, and subsequently, within the following seven months, we successfully facilitated the establishment of over 50 companies. Our rapid growth underscores our commitment to providing comprehensive solutions for those seeking to thrive in the dynamic business landscape of the UAE.\n\nWhile we may have a limited number of reviews, the ethos behind Bizhub AE has always been rooted in complete transparency and authenticity. Our commitment to constructing a reliable and genuine company remains unwavering. Quality has always taken precedence over quantity in our approach. Whether few or many, each review and feedback we receive is meticulously curated to be on-point and top-notch. This dedication ensures that every individual associated with Bizhub AE experiences satisfaction, emphasizing the value we place on delivering excellence.\n\nWhat support do you need from the public and customers?\n\nThe support that would be immensely valuable to us is the consideration and encouragement of SMEs like ours. Our primary goal extends beyond mere profitability; it is centered on fostering healthy relationships with everyone associated with our company. This not only sets a positive example for the youth but also encourages them to embark on their career tracks with integrity. As a youthful and passionate team at Bizhub, we undertake the responsibility of building a community where the youth can grow and progress with a mindset focused on networking and building sustainable success rather than opting for shortcuts. Your support in embracing and promoting this vision is pivotal for our collective growth and positive impact.\n\nIs there any breakeven?\n\nIn what may sound unconventional, we initiated our business with a modest investment of just AED 7,000 jointly contributed by Sakib and me. Our investments were strategically made as we continued to serve clients within our network who chose to collaborate with us based on the strong relationships we had cultivated. Excitingly, within six months of our company being in the market, we are proud to announce that we have successfully achieved breakeven. This milestone underscores the efficiency and resilience of our business model.\n\nYour Website & Social media pages.\n\nWebsite: https://bizhub.ae/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bizhubdxb/\n\nLinkedIn: https://ae.linkedin.com/company/bizhub-business-setup-uae\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bizhubae\n\nMessage to your customers and viewers.\n\nOur heartfelt message to both our valued customers and viewers is a plea for your unwavering support. As a locally-driven startup founded by two individuals who embarked on this journey from scratch, your support means the world to us.\n\nMoreover, I want to convey to everyone that if you have a dream and sense something holding you back, it’s essential to recognize that fear is often the only obstacle. The fears of handling losses, shouldering family responsibilities, and sustaining a lifestyle are common concerns at every stage of life. However, with unwavering faith in God and your relentless hard work, every obstacle can be overcome, and every dream can be realized. We appreciate your support and encourage you to join us on this journey towards turning dreams into reality."
