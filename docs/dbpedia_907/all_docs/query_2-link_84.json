        "text": "Bangladesh protests: Moments after Sheikh Hasina resigned as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and fled the country following massive violent protests, Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman took over the administration and announced the formation of an interim government.\n\nIn Bangladesh today, thousands of protesters stormed and vandalised Sheikh Hasina's official residence in Dhaka. They demolished a statue of her father, Mujibur Rahman, with hammers and set fire to her party's offices, celebrating her resignation as Prime Minister. Hasina, who is 76, stepped down amid widespread protests against her government.\n\nIn a television address, the Army General confirmed Hasinaâ€™s resignation and took the responsibility of the government. \"PM Sheikh Hasina has resigned. Interim Government to run the country. We will return peace to the country. We ask citizens to stop violence. We will investigate all killings that have happened over the past few weeks,\" says Bangladesh's army chief Waker-uz-Zaman. He said that he met political leaders and told them the army would take over responsibility for law and order. The Army chief urged the protesting students to stay calm and return home, ending the conflict.\n\nWho is General Waker-uz-Zaman?\n\nWaqar Uz Zaman, who assumed the role of Army Chief of Bangladesh on June 23 this year, is 58 years old and will serve a standard three-year tenure.
