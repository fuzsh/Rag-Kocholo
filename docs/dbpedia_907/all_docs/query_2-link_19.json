        "text": "Zaman International is a world-class nonprofit organization with more than 25 years of on-the-ground experience in empowering women and children to break the cycle of extreme poverty. Since 2010 we have helped over 480,000 of our neighbors in southeast Michigan, while serving more than 4.7 million around the world.\n\nZaman applies a needs-based, community-driven approach to help households meet their basic needs and break the cycle of poverty through evolving education, workforce development and employment programs at our Hope For Humanity Center in Inkster, Michigan near Detroit.\n\nUnlike many organizations, we develop personal relationships with our clients through home visits and regular in-person consultations to ensure assistance can quickly and effectively meet their diverse set of needs. By both providing urgent assistance and promoting self-reliance as a means to pursuing sustainable employment, Zaman helps transition families from a hand-out to a hands-on model.\n\nSince our founding in 1996, Zaman has grown from a grassroots group of volunteers to a world-class global nonprofit. The success of our organization and continued growth comes from the passion and dedication to our mission shared by our team, volunteers, supporters and community partners.\n\nWe hope you will join us as we work to break the cycle of poverty one family at a time.\n\nZaman International is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit humanitarian organization, EIN: 20-1946065.\n\nFounding Story\n\nThe story of Zaman International begins in 1996 with the terminal diagnosis of a three-month-old infant. His parents, newly immigrated to the United States, had to face the heart-wrenching reality that no treatment would save him.\n\nZaman Founder and CEO, Najah Bazzy, a transcultural clinical nurse specialist, was providing clinical, spiritual, and cultural support to this family throughout their time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.\n\nVisiting the family at their home, their sparse living conditions shocked Najah. Instead of a refrigerator, the family used a picnic cooler to house their limited food supply and baby formula. Instead of a stove, a portable propane stove was used for cooking. The infant's bed consisted of a laundry basket piled high with towels, and the infant only had the hospital's receiving blanket to keep him warm.\n\nWhen the infant passed away and the family was unable to bury him, Najah raised funds from the community to provide him with a proper burial. This began Plots for Tots, one of Zaman's signature programs, which provides dignified burial support for families which have lost a fetus or infant.\n\nWitnessing this family's sorrowful experience and shocking living conditions, inspired Najah to harness the community's efforts to help struggling families in similar situations. She asked community members to donate furniture, food, clothing, and household goods. The support and need for such efforts quickly increased, encouraging Zaman to formalize as an organization committed to using community support to address community needs and alleviate poverty and hunger."
