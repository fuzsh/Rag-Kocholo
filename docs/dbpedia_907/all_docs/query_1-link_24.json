You can use either Zaman or Zamaan, both are correct and acceptable. If you like this variant more and you'd like to pronounce it the way it is spelled (different than the original name), this is perfectly acceptable. For more details please see the main entry at: Zamaan.\n\nFull Meaning of Zaman\n\nArabic for “time”, “age”, “era”."
