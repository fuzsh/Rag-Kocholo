From the parchment colored box to the black ink illustrations, this is a tea design that looks to the past to pay homage to the quality of the product. The intricate lined patterns and tea kettle give the overall design an elevated and luxurious feel, all while giving off the Ethos that this is tea of unparalleled quality.\n\nZaman is a beautifully designed tea for the discerning drinker.\n\nZaman is an Arabic word for old-time or era “retro” style, meaning something is imitative or consciously derivative of lifestyles, trends, or art forms from the historical past, including in music, modes, fashions, or attitudes. This retro-inspiration is how the packaging was approached, to reflect the good quality of the Tea."
