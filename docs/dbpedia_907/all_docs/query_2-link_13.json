In 2014, she participated in a conference by the Hrant Dink Foundation that was dedicated to Armenian-Turkish reconciliation.[7] Zaman, who recognizes the Armenian genocide as fact, believes that the Turkish government must reconcile with its history concerning the Armenians.[8][9] In response to the Turkish government's letter of condolences to Armenians on 24 April 2014, Zaman declared:[9]\n\nAs a citizen who believes that the Armenian genocide must be recognized, apologized for, and whose victims be properly compensated, even if these expectations may be far from occurring, I officially stand with the state's first written letter to the Armenian victims.\n\nZaman states that she is a target of a vilification campaign by pro-government media.[10] In 2013, Amberin Zaman was sacked as a journalist for HaberTurk because of columns that were considered unacceptable by the government.[10]\n\nZaman was attacked on Twitter for reporting the Gezi Park protests. She described the attacks as \"abusive, violent and sexual\".[11]\n\nIn 2014, the Prime Minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, called Amberin Zaman \"A militant in the guise of a journalist, a shameless woman... Know your place!\"[10] and \"scum\" at two successive election rallies. In a response to the accusations by the Prime Minister, Zaman wrote a column in the newspaper Taraf entitled \"First be a human!\" (Turkish: Önce insan ol!).[12] A public apology campaign had started with numerous human rights groups and journalist associations throughout the world.[13] Erdogan's rhetoric was condemned by a representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation, The Economist, and the Turkish Journalists' Association.[13] The Equality Monitoring Women's Group of Turkey collected 130 signatures demanding that Erdogan apologize for his language.[13]\n\nZaman \"experienced a mass attack on Twitter\" for her reporting on the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015. Zaman stated: \"It's like a public lynching. It has made me frightened for my physical safety when I am out in the streets.\"[11] Zaman has not returned to Turkey since 2016. The Metropolitan Police have installed a panic button in her home in London.[14]\n\nIn November 2022 she experienced a smear campaign launched against her by pro-Turkish-government media outlets and social media users after she met with Turkey’s main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in London.[15]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nShe is married to Joseph Pennington, the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq.[5]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
