        "text": "Friday has seen the latest crackdown of Turkish President Recep Erdogan on freedom of press. Turkish authorities forcefully entered and seized Zaman, Turkey’s most widely circulated newspaper. This followed a court order to install a state trustee at the head of the newspaper’s board. Outside of the building the police used water cannons and tear gas to get the upper hand over a group of protesters. Zaman’s editor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme reported that she was pushed by police as authorities tried to take her out of the building.\n\nThis marks the latest incident in the rapid deterioration of free-speech rights under the Erdogan government. The objective of the government is to gain control over the largest opposition newspaper and to silence the cleric Fetullah Gülen. Gülen used to be a close ally of Erdogan, however the two are bitter rivals now. Zaman is believed to stand ideologically close to the Hizmet movement that Gülen initiated. Gülen, who currently lives in exile in the United States, is perceived as a great threat to the power of Erdogan. Hizmet has been declared a terrorist organization by the Turkish government.\n\nThis comes just shortly after the editor-in-chief of the Cumhurryiet newspaper Can Dünar and the newspaper’s Ankara correspondent Erdem Gül were arrested. Both faced sentences, punishable with life imprisonment. Following a ruling of the constitutional court that ordered the release of the two journalists, Erdogan declared that he was not going to accept the court ruling.\n\nWhile the Hizmet movement and especially its leader Gülen are not free of controversy, this cannot justify the actions of Erdogan’s government against the Zaman newspaper. It is another lowlight of the continuous war waged on opposition and freedom of press. Ultimately, however, it reveals much bigger problems. Turkey is struggling with the weight of more than two million refugees from Syria, it is waging a war with Kurdish separatists, and Islamic State has successfully launched multiple deadly attacks in Turkey. The country– once seen as a stable place in a hostile region– is on the verge of slipping into severe political instability.\n\nMuch of this instability can be traced back to the Turkish president Recep Erdogan. He has become increasingly hostile when dealing with opposition. Academics have been targeted for speaking out against the government, Turkish courts have been extremely busy charging all sorts of people with a crime called ‘insulting the president’ and now the seizing of Zaman.\n\nOne might attribute this to the personal feud between Erdogan and Gülen. Gülen was a close ally of Erdogan and helped him deconstruct the military’s control over politics through a series of trials related to coup charges against many military officials. Much of the evidence in these cases was later determined to be fabricated. However, in 2013 the two had a falling-out over numerous issues including the support of rebel groups in Syria and the relations to Israel. Since then, Erdogan has been trying to eradicate the movement.\n\nHowever, the means that Erdogan is using to pulverize his opposition suggests that he is on the way to become an autocratic leader. So far Turkey’s status as a stabilizing power in the region has allowed him to be relatively untouched by the European Union and other international organizations.\n\nFriday’s seizing of Zaman, however, has to be heard by journalists, activists, organizations and governments around the world as a dramatic violation of the freedom of press. The deliberate deterioration of this fundamental freedom in Turkey under Recep Erdogan has to stop, or it will lead to further instability."
