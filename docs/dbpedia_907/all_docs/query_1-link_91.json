        "text": "When Caliph Attahiru of Sokoto chose flight over submission to the British in March 1903, it was left to the blind and aging Waziri, Muhammad al-Bukhari, to provide those who remained behind with an explanation of how they could remain good Muslims while accepting infidel rule. Citing a text of the caliphate's founder, Shehu ʿUthman Dan Fodio, he argued that one could befriend the British with the tongue, without befriending them with the heart. It remained for others to develop the vocabulary that their tongues would need for this task.\n\nA particularly intriguing item in the vocabulary that emerged during the turbulent first decade of colonial rule was a new usage of zaman(time, era) that occurs in the records of the Emir of Kano's judicial council in such terms as hukm al-zaman (rule of the era) and ʿumur al-zaman (things of the era). It is worth noting that the judicial council did not keep written records before being instructed to do so by British Resident C.L. Temple in 1909, so the records might be seen as preserving what was essentially oral discourse—expressions of the tongue. These terms occur uniquely in relation to legal matters in which the British had intervened. Understanding them can shed new light on the religious and political adaptation of northern Nigerian Muslim leaders to life under British rule. To explore their meaning requires a threefold process of examining various usages and understandings of zaman in non-legal sources; describing how the judicial council used the word; and then analyzing how this usage may have been related to any of a number of influences, ranging from British officials to West African Islamic scholars to Western-educated North Africans passing through the region.\n\n3. The different roles of oral and written discourse in the Sokoto Caliphate need further exploration. If John Hunwick is correct in his contention that the Kano Chronicle was only committed to writing during the reign of Muhammad Bello in the 1880s, one could argue that efforts to use writing to stabilize political institutions began shortly before the arrival of the British. See “Not Yet The Kano Chronicle: King-lists With and Without Narrative Elaboration From Nineteenth Century Kano,” Sudanic Africa, 4 (1993), 95–130.Google Scholar C.L. Temple was assiduous in his efforts to promote written records: see Lovejoy, Paul, Mahadi, Abdullahi, and Mukhtar, Mansur Ibrahim, “C.L. Temple's ‘Notes on the History of Kano’ (1909): a Lost Chronicle of Political Office,” Sudanic Africa, 4 (1993), 7–76.Google Scholar\n\n22. At the outset of the colonial era, Europeans were sometimes referred to as Nasara, or Christians. But the term Turawa (Europeans) rapidly gained currency. There may have been a religious argument behind the choice. It was easier to justify submitting to conquerors described by an ethnic term than to ones acknowledged to be Christian. By a similar token, North Africans popularly referred to the French as rumi, or “Roman.” Indeed, the Hausa Turawa may have been derived from this usage. A Hausa speaker, asking a North African Arabic speaker where the “land of the Romans” was would have been told it was around Istanbul (Rumelia or, in Arabic, bilad al-rum). This would have led to a natural confusion between Turks and Europeans."
