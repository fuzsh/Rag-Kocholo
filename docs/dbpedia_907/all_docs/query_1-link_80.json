        "meta_description": "Zaman by Dunya, released 16 June 2023\n\n1. Zaman\n2. Solmuş Güller\n3. Damla Damla\n4. Marianne Landbrieff\n5. Qualle\n6. Kader\n7. Incir Ağacı\n8. Interlude\n9. Tatlı Hayalim\n10. Smoke\n11. Oleander\n\nDoes time pass differently when we cross borders? When we don&#39;t just move in a straight line in one direction, but go into the depths, travel into the past and sound out intermediate states? The Hamburg band Dunya makes very different dimensions audible on their debut album &quot;Zaman&quot; (Turkish for &quot;time&quot;): accelerating in anger, melting into memory, celebrating the fleeting. An absolute openness pervades the work of this five-member collective. For Dunya (Turkish for &quot;world&quot;) sees itself as an unconditionally cosmopolitan band. Their songs oscillate poetically between Turkish, German and English. Constant changes of perspective that challenge in the most beautiful way. Which lead from pure understanding into a stimulating mysteriousness. That make time and existence vibrate beyond stress and usability. And all this embedded in a complex and at the same time extremely engaging sound between psychedelic rock and dream pop, between oriental flow and herbaceous noise. But as elegiac and experimental as Dunya&#39;s songs sound, the quintet is driven by a very concrete attitude: How does history influence us? And what do we have to do acutely now in this time so that we can live well together in the future? The band seeks answers in the artistic process, which beyond the music also includes the design of the artwork, sustainable merchandise and vinyl recycling. A mindful and expressive togetherness that gives plenty of impulses and is exciting to experience.",

Silverlight over the streets, shimmering concret. Third of the way is done. There is no turing back. I walked all the way, in someone else's shoes. But just the moon knows, just the moon knows."
