        "text": "\"Being a woman journalist of colour has a significant impact on my work, as the challenges and experiences I faced are different from my male and white colleagues. It affects my ability to cover certain topics. Ultimately, what keeps me motivated is the belief that journalism can make a difference, and that by doing my job with integrity and professionalism, I can help to create a more just and equitable society.\"\n\nListen to Annie Zaman telling her story here:\n\nSoundcloud\n\nAgainst all odds, I have spent the last 18 years of my career as a woman journalist. Overcoming challenges has become a regular part of my journey, but perhaps the most disappointing of them all is the fact that my work is at times undervalued compared to that of my male colleagues. To this day, I have to put in more effort than a man. As a woman journalist of color, I have faced greater security risks, more difficulties in accessing resources and information than my male colleagues. These challenges have a significant impact on my ability to cover certain topics, and it is a reality that many women of color in journalism face.\n\nDuring my career, I have faced various forms of harassment including verbal harassment, death threats via Twitter, cyber bullying and sexism. Even after filing complaints with HR, I received no support from my workplace in Germany which made me anxious and fearful. It forced me to confront a difficult truth: the system provides significant support to male journalists, but their female counterparts, regardless of location and workplace culture, are left with woeful absence of such support.\n\nTo protect myself from further harm, I felt the need to change the way I work, from the use of my social media to my offline work techniques. However, I refused to engage in self- censorship, nor was I willing to shy away from certain topics or stories for fear of retribution. So at one point, I chose to write anonymously to protect my identity.\n\nIt is important for the world to know about the online and offline violence that women journalists specifically experience because it is a significant issue that affects not only the journalists themselves but also the wider society. It also limits the diversity of voices and perspectives in the media. When we are targeted and silenced, our stories and perspectives are also silenced.\n\nI advocate for better legal protection at the workplace for women journalists, and more accountability for those who perpetrate violence or threats against the press is a personal mission that I undertake with great conviction. To maintain my well-being, I prioritize self-care practices like meditation and sports. I am grateful to have a supportive environment of colleagues, friends, family and my therapist who are always there and offer encouragement.\n\nDespite the challenges I face, what keeps me motivated is the belief that journalism can make a difference. I firmly believe that through practicing my craft with integrity and professionalism I can contribute towards a more equitable and just society. Therefore, I would like to say to all women journalists: stay connected, stay informed, and stay committed to your values and principles. Know that your voice and your work are important and valuable, and that you have the power to make a difference in the world.\n\nIn cooperation with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Rights in the Picture, Free Press Unlimited organised a photo exhibition at UNESCO in Paris. The theme is ''Safety of journalists: the faces and stories behind attacks on women journalists'' and consists of 12 portraits of women journalists who experience online and offline violence/threats. We all need to hear their stories."
