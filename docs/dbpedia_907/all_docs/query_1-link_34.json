It then determines from popular usage on the web whether the name is more commonly for a male or a female.\n\nWatch some cool Video Blogs from Vancouver BC Canada. Listen to some original jazz music. Visit my home page for other stuff.\n\nSponsors: Vancouver restaurants and Vancouver wedding music.\n\nLooking to guess the gender of a Hindu name? Try Sanjay Kattimani's Gender Teller.\n\nBaby Name Guesser was formerly called Geoff's Gender Guesser. This website still allows you to guess the gender of a name, and discover whether the name is more commonly a male or female name. Try it for foreign or ethnic names and it will tell you the likelihood that a name is a man or woman's name, based on popular usage of that name on the Internet. The Baby Name Guesser can also help you avoid the embarrasing situation where you don't know the gender of a person you are trying to contact."
