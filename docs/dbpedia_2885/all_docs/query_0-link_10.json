        "text": "Sleep in a comfortable couchette from Paris to the Spanish border, with pillow, sleeping bag, bottled water & amenities kit.\n\nParis to Barcelona by sleeper\n\nThe direct trainhotel from Paris to Barcelona was sadly withdrawn in 2013. But you can still travel between Paris & Barcelona overnight, using a French overnight train from Paris to either Latour de Carol for a local train through the scenic Pyrenees to Barcelona, or to Cerbère on the Spanish border for a local train to Barcelona. This page tells you how, in either direction. Information good for 2024.\n\nOption 1, Paris-Barcelona by sleeper via Latour de Carol\n\nTrain times, Paris to Barcelona\n\nTrain times, Barcelona to Paris\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\nTravel tips\n\nRoute map\n\nOption 2, Paris-Barcelona by sleeper via Cerbère\n\nTrain times, Paris to Barcelona\n\nTrain times, Barcelona to Paris\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\nTravel tips\n\nRoute map\n\nOption 3, Paris-Barcelona by daytime train\n\nSee the Paris-Barcelona by TGV page\n\nOption 1, via Latour de Carol\n\nThis is a relaxed & scenic but time-effective option, straight through the Pyrenees via the remote and lonely yet imposing international station at Latour de Carol. Although seeing only a trickle of passengers, Latour de Carol's grand station is almost unique in being served by trains of three different track gauges: Spanish broad gauge from Barcelona, French standard gauge to Toulouse & Paris, and French narrow gauge as it's the terminus for the celebrated Petit Train Jaune.\n\nParis ► Barcelona\n\nStep 1, travel from Paris to Latour de Carol by sleeper train, leaving Paris Gare d'Austerlitz at 21:40, arriving Latour de Carol at 10:07.\n\nThis is an Intercité de Nuit overnight train with 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & 2nd class seats. If you want privacy you can book a whole 1st or 2nd class couchette compartment. There are power sockets & free WiFi. More about Intercités de Nuit.\n\nThis train runs every day all year round, but trackwork sometimes affects it so check that it's running on your date using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com. It should open for booking 4 months ahead, but sometimes less than this.\n\nThe last hour into the Pyrenees is wonderfully scenic, past the castle at Foix (on the right hand side just after the station) and up into the mountains - at Porté-Puymorens (the last station just before Latour) the train reaches the highest point on any normal standard-gauge railway in Europe, 1,562m (5,125 feet) above sea level. The railway from Toulouse to Foix opened in 1862, but the difficult line beyond Foix through the Pyrenees to Latour de Carol only opened in 1929.\n\nLatour de Carol is a vast but little-used border station in the middle of nowhere, ringed by mountains, where the French Railways standard gauge line ends and the Spanish Railways Iberian gauge line to Barcelona begins. It's sometimes known as Latour de Carol-Enveitg, and in Catalan it's La Tor de Querol-Enveig.\n\nStep 2, travel from Latour de Carol to Barcelona by local train, leaving Latour at 10:26 & arriving Barcelona Sants at 13:46.\n\nThe local train is comfortable, air-conditioned with 2nd class seats. It's a lovely & scenic run, twisting through the Spanish side of the Pyrenees before reaching the Barcelona suburbs. There's no catering, so bring your own food & drink.\n\nYou will not, I repeat, not find this local train on normal train booking systems, so read the following paragraphs carefully!!\n\nYou can easily check times for the La Tor de Querol to Barcelona Sants train for your date of travel at the special Barcelona suburban trains website rodalies.gencat.cat/en, as this route is classed as a Barcelona suburban train in spite of being very rural.\n\nYou can also check times at www.renfe.com, but it will not be shown in the main Renfe journey planner, you have to do it like this: Click the globe symbol top right & select Ingles for English. Ignore the main journey planner, hover over Cercanias (Commuter) top left and click on Rodalies Catalunya. Search from La Tor de Querol-Enveig to Barcelona Sants. Easy when you know how.\n\nTip: After the 10:26, the next local train leaves at 13:26. You can have lunch in the Bistro de la Gare on Latour de Carol station forecourt, www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune.\n\nBarcelona ► Paris\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to La Tour de Carol by local train, leaving Barcelona Sants at 14:31 arriving Latour de Carol at 17:51.\n\nThe local train is comfortable, air-conditioned with 2nd class seats. There's no catering, so bring your own food & drink. It's a lovely scenic run up into the Pyrenees. There's not much at Latour de Carol, a huge but under-used border station in the middle of nowhere, ringed by mountains, so bring your own supplies or check if the Bistro de la Gare on the station forecourt will be open, see www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune.\n\nYou will not, I repeat, not find this local train on normal train booking systems, so read the following paragraphs carefully!!\n\nYou can easily check times for the Barcelona Sants to La Tor de Querol train for your date of travel at the special Barcelona suburban trains website rodalies.gencat.cat/en, as this route is classed as a Barcelona suburban train in spite of being very rural.\n\nYou can also check times at www.renfe.com, but it will not be shown in the main Renfe journey planner, you have to do it like this: Click the globe symbol top right & select Ingles for English. Ignore the main journey planner, hover over Cercanias (Commuter) top left and click on Rodalies Catalunya. Search from Barcelona Sants to La Tor de Querol-Enveig. Easy when you know how.\n\nStep 2, travel from Latour de Carol to Paris by sleeper train, leaving Latour de Carol at 18:50 & arriving Paris Gare d'Austerlitz 07:03.\n\nThis is an Intercité de Nuit overnight train with 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & 2nd class seats. If you want privacy you can book a whole 1st or 2nd class couchette compartment. There are power sockets & free WiFi. More about Intercités de Nuit.\n\nThis train runs every day all year round, but trackwork sometimes affects it so check that it's running on your date using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com. It should open for booking 4 months ahead, but sometimes less than this.\n\nIn summer when it's light, the first hour and a half twisting and turning through the Pyrenees is beautifully scenic. At Porté-Puymorens, the first station after Latour, the train passes the highest point on any normal standard-gauge railway in Europe, 1,562m (5,125 feet) above sea level. Watch out for the impressive castle at Foix, on the left. The railway from Foix to Toulouse opened in 1862, but the difficult line through the Pyrenees from Latour de Carol to Foix only opened in 1929.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nParis to Latour de Carol starts at 20 in a reclining seat, 35 in a 2nd class 6-berth couchette, 63 in a 1st class 4-berth couchette.\n\nA couchette is recommended! Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nSole occupancy of a 2nd class 6-berth couchette compartment for 1-6 people starts at 150, sole occupancy of a 1st class 4-berth compartment for 1-4 people starts at 180. More about Espace Privatif.\n\nLatour de Carol to Barcelona costs 12.\n\nThis is a fixed price, any day, any date, paid in cash (not card) on the train southbound, or at the station in Barcelona northbound.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nStep 1, buy tickets for the overnight train between Paris & Latour de Carol at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) or www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee).\n\nIf you want sole occupancy of a whole couchette compartment, see the Espace Privatif instructions on the Intercité de Nuit page.\n\nYou print your own ticket or can choose a mobile ticket to show on your phone.\n\nBooking should open up to 4 months ahead, but these night trains often open less than this, sometimes as little as 2 months, so don't be impatient. There are odd dates when this train is affected by engineering work, and its timings can vary, but in principle at least it should run every day.\n\nStep 2, buy the ticket between Latour de Carol & Barcelona on the day, as follows:\n\nSouthbound, just buy the ticket from the conductor on board the train. Yes, it's that simple. You cannot buy it online and don't need to, there are no reservations, just hop on & go. And no, you can't buy this Renfe ticket from the SNCF ticket office at Latour de Carol, either! It's a good idea to have cash on you in case their card machine doesn't work, but conductors on this route now normally take credit cards.\n\nNorthbound, buy a ticket at Barcelona Sants, either from the staffed counters or self-service ticket machines. There is no need to buy it in advance, it cannot sell out, it's just a local ticket.\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\nIntercité de nuit sleeper train at Paris Gare d'Austerlitz. More about Intercités de Nuit.\n\nFoix, the castle is on the right just south of the station.\n\nInto the Pyrenees. The sleeper train heads into the mountains beyond Foix.\n\nMore mountain scenery in the Pyrenees.\n\nLatour de Carol, where two nations, two trains and three track gauges meet. This is the huge international station building. The station bistro is on the forecourt, just out of shot to the left.\n\nThe inexpensive Bistro de la Gare (above right) on the forecourt at Latour de Carol is ideal for breakfast or a coffee between trains, check opening hours at www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune. Courtesy of Adrian Fuentes.\n\nAt Latour de Carol, the French standard-gauge overnight couchette train has arrived from Paris on the right. On the left, the Spanish broad-gauge local train is about to leave for Barcelona. The third gauge at Latour is the narrow-gauge Petit Train Jaune to Perpignan, its platform is behind the couchette cars shown here.\n\nThe air-conditioned local train from Latour to Barcelona. 2nd class only. Bring your own food & drink. The 'R' stands for Rodalies, Catalan for suburban network.\n\nThe snow gives way to autumnal browns & golds as the train to Barcelona wends its way south.\n\nTravel tips\n\nAlways book a couchette rather than just a seat, so you can sleep lying down in a safely-locked compartment. To see more about what the sleeper train is like, watch the Intercité de Nuit video.\n\nYou take luggage onto the train with you and put it on the racks. There are no airline-style luggage limits, if you can manage it yourself it's fine. On the sleeper, luggage fits under the lower berths, on a rack above the window, or in a big recess above the compartment door that projects over the ceiling of the corridor. On the local train, it goes on the overhead racks or simply goes on the floor near your seat.\n\nThere's no cafe car on the sleeper or the local train, so eat before boarding and take some supplies, perhaps a bottle of wine for the evening.\n\nThere aren't many great eateries at the Gare d'Austerlitz, but when heading south from Paris, why not have dinner at the celebrated Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon? It's an experience in itself. After dinner, it takes just 10 minutes to walk across the bridge over the Seine from the Gare de Lyon to the Gare d'Austerlitz on the far bank.\n\nAt Latour de Carol, you can use the Bistro de la Gare on the station forecourt between trains, check opening times at www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune.\n\nLatour de Carol, Latour de Carol-Enveitg and (in Catalan) La Tor de Querol-Enveig are all the same place.\n\nTo see what the scenery is like between Toulouse, Latour de Carol & Barcelona, watch the Slow train through the Pyrenees video.\n\nRoute map\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 2, via Cerbère\n\nThis is similar to option 1, but uses the Paris-Perpignan-Cerbère Intercité de Nuit rather than the Paris-Latour one. It runs daily in summer, but usually only Fridays & Sundays in winter, leaving Paris coupled to the train to Latour de Carol. It's a lovely scenic run along the coast between Perpignan & Cerebère, through Port Vendres & Collioure. You then take a Spanish local train on the classic line from Cerbère (on the French side of the Spanish border) through Portbou, Figueres (for the wonderful Salvador Dali museum) & Girona to Barcelona. Alternatively, you can take the sleeper to Perpignan and use a high-speed train to Barcelona, which is faster, but a little more expensive.\n\nParis ► Barcelona\n\nStep 1, travel from Paris to Perpignan or Cerbère by sleeper train\n\nThe sleeper train leaves Paris Gare d'Austerlitz at 21:22, arriving Perpignan at 08:38 & Cerbère at 09:27.\n\nThis sleeper train runs Fridays & Sundays all year, every day in high summer, but SNCF doesn't issue a timetable so until you see it in the booking system, nobody's really sure. It also runs daily 9-25 February, 5-21 April 2024, and 5 July until late August. Timings vary, leaves Paris at 20:08 some dates.\n\nThis is an Intercité de Nuit overnight train with 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & 2nd class seats. If you want privacy you can book a whole 1st or 2nd class couchette compartment. There are power sockets & free WiFi. More about Intercités de Nuit.\n\nCheck if it's running using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com, it should appear 4 months out, but usually doesn't, the booking horizon is often much shorter than that for these night trains. I've seen it open for booking as little as a month ahead.\n\nBeyond Perpignan, the train runs along the beautiful Côte Vermeille through Port Vendres & Collioure, with great sea views.\n\nStep 2, travel from Perpignan or Cerbère to Barcelona\n\nThe fastest option is to get off the sleeper at Perpignan and use the new high-speed line to Barcelona. A high-speed AVE leaves Perpignan at 11:18 arriving Barcelona Sants at 12:38. It also calls at Figueres Vilafant & Girona.\n\nThis train has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. There are great views of Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees. More about AVE S100 trains.\n\nThe cheapest option is to stay on the sleeper to Cerbère and use the classic slow but scenic route along the coast. A local train leaves Cerbère 12:04 on weekdays, arriving Barcelona Sants 15:10. On Saturdays & Sundays, leave Cerbère 11:46, arriving Barcelona Sants 15:10.\n\nThese are local trains which you won't find in normal train booking systems, to check times use rodalies.gencat.cat/en. These trains also stop at Figueres (for the wonderful Salvador Dali museum) and Girona. It's 2nd class only, there's no catering so bring your own food & drink.\n\nBarcelona ► Paris\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to either Cerbère or Perpignan\n\nThe cheapest option is to use the classic slow but scenic route along the coast. A local train leaves Barcelona Sants at 15:16 arriving Cerbère 17:56.\n\nOr an earlier train leaves Barcelona Sants at 13:16 arriving Cerebère 15:56 if you prefer a more robust connection.\n\nThis is the original line to the French border via Girona & Figueres. It's a local train, you won't find it in normal train booking systems, check times using rodalies.gencat.cat/en. It's 2nd class only, there's no catering so bring your own food & drink.\n\nThe fastest option is to use the modern high-speed line from Barcelona to Perpignan and pick up the sleeper there. A high-speed AVE train leaves Barcelona Sants at 16:34 arriving Perpignan at 17:56. It also calls at Girona & Figueres Vilafant.\n\nThe train has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.

More about AVE S100 trains.\n\nStep 2, travel from Cerebère or Perpignan to Paris by sleeper train\n\nThe sleeper train leaves Cerebère at 18:59 or Perpignan at 19:46, arriving Paris Gare d'Austerlitz at 06:40 next morning.\n\nThis sleeper train runs Fridays & Sundays all year, every day in summer, but SNCF doesn't issue a timetable, so until you see it in the booking system, nobody is really sure.

More about Intercités de Nuit.\n\nIn summer when it's light, it's a lovely run from Cerebère to Perpignan along the Côte Vermeille coastline through Collioure & Port Vendres.\n\nWhen does this sleeper train run? Good question! It should run on Fridays & Sundays all year round and every day in summer, but SNCF doesn't issue a timetable, so until you see it in the booking system, nobody knows. Also runs daily 9-25 February, 5-21 April 2024.\n\nCheck if it's running using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com, it should appear 4 months out, but usually doesn't, the booking horizon is often much shorter than that for these night trains.
