        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nPlanning a trip to Barcelona and are thinking about side trips? Keep scrolling for my list of the best day trips from Barcelona by train worth adding to your Spain itinerary!\n\nVisiting the capital of Catalonia and want to escape the crowds by planning day trips from Barcelona by train?\n\nIt’s a great idea! Many visitors stay in Barcelona for their whole trip but there are so many beautiful places near Barcelona to explore too. Not only in the Catalan region, but also in other parts of Spain and even beyond the French border.\n\nWhile day trips from Barcelona to Mallorca or other Spanish islands aren’t doable (unless you’ve got the cash to splash on a private jet!), hopping on train trips from Barcelona couldn’t be simpler.\n\nNo stressing over navigating foreign roads, rental insurance, or city traffic!\n\nThis guide lists all the best day trips from Barcelona by train, whether you’re in the mood to sip on cava in a local wine region or dive into the historic center of another bustling city.\n\nIt includes all the logistical info you need too!\n\nBarcelona to Zaragoza Day Trip\n\nZaragoza is the capital city of Spain’s Aragorn region resting along the Ebro River. The jewel of Zaragoza is the Nuestra Señora del Pilar Basilica, a baroque church with many domes dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nThere are lots of Moorish and Gothic buildings in Zaragoza which all make up the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIt’s one of the top day trips from Barcelona by train because it’s easy and not too far away. Zaragoza also looks nothing like Barcelona so despite it being a big city, you’ll definitely feel like you’re seeing another side of Spain.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Zaragoza by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants station, take a direct Renfe AVE service to Zaragoza-Delicias station which is approximately a 90-minute journey. Renfe is the name of Spain’s national rail service. There are around 13 trains per day that travel on this route and tickets start from €7.\n\nRenfe’s AVANT, AVE, and EUROMED services all cater to this route which are different versions of high-speed trains but AVE trains are slightly faster.\n\nOn high-speed services, the carriage classes are Básica (2nd class) and Prémium (1st class). Sometimes, they have ‘Elige’ tickets which allow you to choose some of the perks of 1st class, but not all.\n\nDay Trips from Barcelona to Figueres\n\nFigueres is a small town north of Barcelona, not too far from the French border. Many travelers like to take a day trip to Figueres from Barcelona because it is the birthplace of world-renowned surrealist Salvador Dalí.\n\nThe Dalí Theatre-Museum was curated and built by the man himself and you can even visit his former home. Aside from the Dalí-related attractions, Figueres is a charming, walkable city with few crowds.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Figueres by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants take a direct Renfe MD train to Figueras station which takes less than two hours and departs every 30 minutes. MD (Media Distancia) high-speed trains are standard for Renfe’s regional services.\n\nTicket prices for this journey start from €11.10 which makes a day trip from Barcelona to Figueres perfect on a budget!\n\nBarcelona to Cerbère, France Day Trip\n\nIs it possible to take day trips to France from Barcelona? Absolutely! While some might suggest hopping on a train to cities like Perpignan or even Montpellier, these journeys will take over four hours.\n\nBut if you want to take day trips from Barcelona to France where you’re not spending half of the day sitting on a train, stopping by the seaside town of Cerbère is perfect. It’s just beyond the French border and has several rugged, pebbled beaches like Plage d’El Canu and Plage De Cerbère.\n\nThere’s a small harbor and a hilltop lighthouse you can hike to called Phare du Cap Cerbère. It’s not too strenuous and you’ll see beautiful views across the coastlines of both Spain and France.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Cerbère by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants, hop on a direct Renfe regional train service to Cervera de la Marenda which is the name of Cerbère’s local station. This train journey takes around three hours and there are approximately nine services every day. Tickets are around €48.40, so it’s better to book in advance to save money.\n\nDay Trips from Barcelona to Girona\n\nFor travelers who are completely unsure where to go from Barcelona on a day trip, Girona is an easy recommendation. It’s one of the closest places to visit near Barcelona and it’s also absolutely gorgeous.\n\nGirona’s Ciutat Antiga (Old Town) has patchwork-colored houses lined against the River Onyar which wouldn’t look out of place on the Italian Riviera. It has one of the best-preserved Jewish Quarters in Europe too.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Girona by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants, get a direct Renfe AVE, AVANT, MD, or EUROMED service to Girona station which can take 40 minutes to one hour. There are around 21 services a day for this train and tickets for this journey start from €7.\n\nBarcelona to Ribes de Freser Day Trip\n\nThe Pyrenees mountains form a natural, mountainous border between France and Spain. This range stretches all the way from the Bay of Biscay on the west to the Mediterranean on the east coast.\n\nBecause they’re mountainous, it’s difficult to travel from Barcelona to Pyrenees by train as buses can weave between the peaks more easily. But it’s definitely doable! You can travel to the mountain town of Ribes de Freser, or get off earlier at the town of Vic if you prefer.\n\nRibes de Freser is a pretty town situated on the banks of three rivers with lots of hotels, restaurants, and tourist centers for hikers. There are lots of shorter walks you can do on a day trip, and the Mirador de Ribes de Freser observation deck offers an incredible panoramic view of the region.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Ribes de Freser by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants, take a direct Renfe Cercanías R3 service to Ribes de Freser station. These journeys take just over two hours and there’s only one service every four hours, so don’t miss it!\n\nCercanías services are commuter trains which means you cannot book in advance or reserve seats. You just buy them at the station before you travel! This does mean the tickets are cheaper than normal, with most costing between €2.40 – €6.95.\n\nGet Our FREE Barcelona Travel Planner\n\nWe respect your privacy.

Stroll around Valencia’s Old Town, check out the Cathedral, and don’t forget to wander through the city’s Central Market too.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Valencia by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants, hop on a direct Renfe Intercity service to Valencia Station North.

These trains take just over an hour and there are roughly 15 services per day.

From Barcelona-Sants, hop on a Renfe Cercanías R4 service to Martorell Central station. This journey should take about 40 minutes.\n\nAt this station, change trains to a Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya R5 service to Monistrol de Montserrat which is a 20-minute journey.\n\nFrom there, you can take the funicular up to Montserrat. Despite the changes, this journey should only take about two hours in total. You can buy single tickets that will cover your entire journey from Barcelona to Montserrat for only €13.25.\n\nBarcelona to Vilafranca del Penedès Day Trip\n\nFrance has champagne, Italy has prosecco, and Spain has cava!\n\nNot only that but it’s mostly grown in the Catalan region. It’s the most underrated and underappreciated of all the sparkling wines and you can help spread the word by spending a day in the wine region.\n\nVilafranca del Penedès is one of the easiest Barcelona day trips by train into the cava wine region. There are lots of wineries, like Cava Torreblanca and Família Torres, that are a quick five-minute taxi journey from the center.\n\nPlus the city itself is beautiful and compact with so many great wine bars, you don’t even need to see the vines.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona to Vilafranca del Penedès by Train\n\nFrom Barcelona-Sants, take a direct Renfe Cercanías R4 service to Vilafranca del Penedès station.
