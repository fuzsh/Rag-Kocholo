On the second week I was thinking of driving to Andorra, France, and maybe as far as Genoa Italy if it is worth seeing, driving along the coast and hopefully seeing views of the Med and nice towns along the way (is this a pleasant viewing trip?). Any advise Is greatly appreciated! on any part of the trip. My last days will be back around Barcelona, with short visits to Montserrat and Sitges. Is the Rojas region worth visiting? I have apartment rental already in Barcelona, but could use advise on money, transportation, sight seeing (best way) , restaurants, tapas bars, entertainment, hotels (outside Barcelona) etc.."
