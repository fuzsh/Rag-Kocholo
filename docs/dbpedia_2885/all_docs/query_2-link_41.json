        "text": "The distance between two destinations in Spain’s Catalonia region, the medieval city of Girona and the seaside town of Cadaqués, located on the region’s Costa Brava, is 32 miles (51 km). The easiest and quickest way to make the trip is by car (1 hour 15 minutes), either renting one yourself or hiring a private car service.\n\nWhile trains do not run directly to Cadaqués, an alternative option is to take the train to Llançà (50 minutes) where you can a catch a taxi (30 minutes) or take the train to Figueres (40 minutes) and take a bus (1 hour) from there. Trains can also be taken from Girona to. Buses going directly from Girona to Cadaqués are the most affordable option, but they run once daily (none on weekends) and will take 1hour and 45 minutes.\n\nFor an overview of the best ways to spend your time on the Costa Brava and nearby Catalonian capital Barcelona, check out kimkim’s 10 Day Itinerary.\n\nBy Rental Car or Private Transfer\n\nDuration: 1 hour 15 minutes, more with stops\n\nHaving a car gives you the freedom to explore the route between Girona and Cadaqués, and perhaps take a few side trips. Rental car companies abound in Girona, with Enterprise, Dollar, and Hertz being the highest rated. Remember that non-EU driver’s license holders must obtain an International Driver’s Permit in order to drive in Spain.\n\nThe most direct route takes you North along the AP-7 highway and then East towards the coast. This trip takes about 1 hours and 15 minutes, with many convenient options to stop at along the way like Figueres, home to the Dalí Theatre-Museum, and Roses, an important fishing port close to your final destination.\n\nRead more about unique places to see in the Catalonia region in the third option in 7 Days in Spain: 4 Unique Itinerary Ideas.\n\nIf you prefer not to drive, hiring a private transfer online is easy. Companies abound for car services from shared shuttles to private luxury vehicles, with prices just as variable. The rode from Figueres to Cadaqués is windy and steep at parts, so definitely take that into consideration. Many private car services will offer off-the-beaten-path stops such as the Monasterio de Sant Pere de Rodes, a monastery founded in the 9th Century and perched on the side of Verdera Mountain.\n\nBy Train and Taxi\n\nDuration: 1 hour 20 minutes\n\nWhile there is no direct train from Girona to Cadaqués, there are two convenient and quick options to take a train part of the way to either Llançà or Figueres and to continue on from there.\n\nIn the first train option, you can take a quick train to Llançà (50 minutes) and take a taxi from there to Cadaqués (30 minutes) . Renfe runs hourly trains from Girona's train station to Llançà, which is only 13 miles (21 km) from Cadaqués. Trains should be taken in the direction of Cerbere.\n\nTaxis are available at Llançà station, or easily booked online in advance for peace of mind. This option will cost about half of the price of taking a private car the whole distance.This is an ideal option if you prefer not to have your own car, but want to save a significant chunk of money on your car hire.\n\nBy Train and Bus\n\nDuration: 1 hour and 40 minutes\n\nIf you prefer to take public transit the whole way, Renfe also runs regular trains from Girona to Figueres. Note that there are two train stations in Figueres, Figueres Station and Figueres Vilifant. Figueres Station is located next to the bus station, where you can catch one of the four daily SARFA buses to Cadaqués. Overall, this will be far cheaper than taking the train to Llansa and a taxi from there, but can potentially add a lot of time waiting for the bus. Therefore, plan your bus time in advance and consider booking your ticket on SARFA's website.\n\nBy Bus\n\nDuration: 1hour 45 minutes\n\nThe most affordable option is to take the bus directly from the Girona Estació, Girona's bus stop right next to the main train station, to Cadaqués Estacio, which is only an 8 minute walk to Plaça del Passeig. However, the bus company Moventis runs only one SARFA bus a day during the week, none on the weekends.\n\nIf you opt for the bus, keep in mind that the road is steep and windy, so pack an anti-nausea pill or choose seats closer to the front."
