Take a morning Eurostar to Paris in 2h20 from £52 one-way or £78 return, have lunch at the remarkable Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon, then take the afternoon double-deck TGV Duplex from Paris to Figueres (for the Salvador Dali museum), Girona & Barcelona with cafe-bar & free WiFi from 39 each way.

I recommend a first class Club Duo seat on the upper deck (pictured, above), wonderful! Put your feet up & relax, watch the pretty French villages of the Rhone Valley pass by, catch up on your reading & your emails, perhaps watch a movie on your iPhone. You can buy some wine from the bar car or feel free to bring your own! To anyone who has only known the stresses of airports, flights & motorways, chilling out on a high-speed train is a revelation. Watch the video here.\n\nBreakfast in London, lunch in Paris, dinner in Spain. You can travel from London to Figueres, Girona or Barcelona by train in a single day with great scenery, a glass of wine to hand and not an airport security queue in sight.\n\nImpressive 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck TGV Duplex trains link Paris with Barcelona in around 6h30, 667 miles centre to centre with cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi, past some great scenery. There are two Paris-Barcelona TGV trains every day in each direction, with a third in summer.\n\nStay overnight in Barcelona (I suggest some good hotels near the station) and continue next day to Madrid in 2h30 by AVE, Alicante in 4h45 by Euromed or to Seville or Malaga by AVE in around 5h30.\n\nAvoiding Paris: If you have lots of luggage, small kids or mobility problems and want to avoid crossing Paris, you can go London-Lille-Nîmes, overnight stop, then Nîmes-Barcelona by AVE or TGV see option 2.\n\nSpain by sleeper: The Elipsos sleeper trains from Paris to Barcelona & Madrid were sadly discontinued in 2013, but it's still possible to travel by sleeper train between Paris & the Spanish border, see option 3 using the sleeper from Paris to Latour de Carol or option 4 using the sleeper from Paris to Perpignan or Cerbère.\n\nWhich route to choose?\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris - fastest, easiest\n\nTrain times London to Barcelona\n\nTrain times Barcelona to London\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV with overnight stop in Nîmes - avoids crossing Paris\n\nOption 3, by overnight sleeper to Latour de Carol & local train - scenic option through the Pyrenees!\n\nOption 4, by overnight sleeper to Perpignan or Cerbère - another overnight option\n\nOption 5, by ferry from Portsmouth to Santander or Bilbao, then train - the ferry alternative!\n\nOption 1, London-Barcelona by high-speed train\n\nThis is the fastest & easiest option, by Eurostar from London to Paris and 320 km/h (199 mph) TGV Duplex from Paris to Barcelona. You can do the trip in a day or break it up with an overnight stop in Paris.\n\nLondon ► Barcelona (morning departure)\n\nStep 1, travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 09:31 every day, arriving Paris Gare du Nord 12:50.\n\nEurostar has two cafe-bars, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Standard Premier & Business Premier fares include breakfast, served at your seat.\n\nCross Paris by metro or taxi to the Gare de Lyon, just 2 stops on RER line D. Why not take an earlier Eurostar and have lunch at the wonderful Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon?\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to Barcelona by TGV Duplex, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 14:42, arriving Figures Vilafant 20:28, Girona 20:45 & Barcelona Sants 21:27.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class, café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Book an upper deck seat for the best views, any seat number >60 is upper deck.\n\nThe train speeds along the Rhône valley past pretty French villages & picturesque churches, look out for flamingos on the étangs in southern France, the Fort de Salses on the right and great views of Mt Canigou in the Pyrenees. Figueres is worth a stop for the remarkable Salvador Dali museum -Dali's home at Port Lligat is a bus or taxi ride away on the coast, also well worth visiting. Map of Barcelona showing station.\n\nLondon ► Barcelona (evening departure, overnight in Paris)\n\nDay 1, travel from London to Paris on any evening Eurostar you like.\n\nThe last Eurostar usually leaves London St Pancras at 20.01 arriving Paris Gare du Nord 23:18, by all means book an earlier one and spend a pleasant evening in Paris.\n\nEurostar has two cafe-bars, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Standard Premier & Business Premier fares include a meal with wine, served at your seat.\n\nCross Paris by metro or taxi to the Gare de Lyon.\n\nStay overnight in Paris. If you want a hotel on arrival at the Gare du Nord, I recommend the excellent 25 Hours Terminus Nord, directly across the road from the Gare du Nord with great reviews & great feedback from Seat61 users. If you'd rather stay at the Gare de Lyon ready for the morning train to Spain, the Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon is part of the Gare de Lyon station complex with great reviews for staff, cleanliness & comfort. See other suggested hotels near the Gare du Nord or Gare de Lyon.\n\nDay 2, travel from Paris to Barcelona by TGV Duplex, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 09:42 and arriving Figures Vilafant 15:32, Girona 15:49 & Barcelona Sants 16:31. This train runs daily all year round.\n\nFrom 6 July to 1 September 2024 there's also an earlier TGV, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 06:38, arriving Figures Vilafant 12:36, Girona 12:55 & Barcelona Sants 13:39.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class, café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. I recommend an upper deck seat for the best views, any seat number >60 is upper deck.\n\nThe train speeds along the Rhône valley past pretty French villages & picturesque churches, look out for flamingos on the étangs in southern France, the Fort de Salses on the right and great views of Mt Canigou in the Pyrenees. Map of Barcelona showing station.\n\nBarcelona ► London (morning departure)\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to Paris by TGV Duplex, leaving Barcelona Sants at 09:28, Girona 10:10 or Figueres Vilafant 10:27, arriving Paris Gare de Lyon 16:12.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class, café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nIn Barcelona, there's a brief X-ray baggage check at the entrance to the platforms.\n\nBook an upper deck seat for the best views as the train rolls past Mt Canigou in the Pyrenees, past flamingos on the étangs in southern France, then speeds along the Rhone Valley towards Paris.\n\nCross Paris by metro or taxi, just 2 stops on RER line D. Why not have an early dinner in Paris and catch a later Eurostar? The Brasserie Terminus Nord (www.terminusnord.com) is good and typically French, and it's directly opposite the Gare du Nord.\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to London by Eurostar, leaving Paris Gare du Nord at 18:12 Mondays-Fridays & Sundays arriving London St Pancras at 19:39, or at 19:12 Saturdays arriving 20:30.\n\nEurostar has two cafe-bars, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Standard Premier & Business Premier fares include a meal with wine.\n\nBarcelona ► London (afternoon departure, overnight in Paris)\n\nDay 1, travel from Barcelona to Paris by TGV Duplex, leaving Barcelona Sants at 13:25, Girona 14:07 or Figueres Vilafant 14:24, arriving Paris Gare de Lyon 20:18.\n\nFrom 6 July to 1 September 2024 there's also a later TGV, leaving Barcelona Sants at 16:04, Girona 16:48, Figueres Vilafant 17:05, arriving Paris Gare de Lyon 23:18.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class, café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nIn Barcelona, there's a brief X-ray baggage check at the entrance to the platforms.\n\nBook an upper deck seat for the best views as the train rolls past Mt Canigou in the Pyrenees, colonies of flamingos on the étangs in southern France, then speeds along the scenic Rhone Valley towards Paris.\n\nChange station in Paris by metro or taxi from the Gare de Lyon to the Gare du Nord.\n\nStay overnight in Paris. If you want a hotel on arrival at the Gare de Lyon, I suggest the Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon as it's part of the station, just metres from where your train arrives. If you'd prefer to stay near the Gare du Nord I suggest the 25 Hours Terminus Nord, directly across the road from the station with great reviews. Other suggested hotels near the Gare de Lyon or Gare du Nord.\n\nDay 2, travel from Paris to London on any morning Eurostar you like. The first Eurostar of the day usually leaves Paris Gare du Nord at 07:12 on Mondays-Saturdays or 08:12 on Sundays, arriving London St Pancras at 08:30 Mondays-Saturdays or 09:30 Sundays.\n\nEurostar has two cafe-bars, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Standard Premier & Business Premier fares include breakfast.\n\nYou can be in central London for the start of the working day!\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Barcelona by TGV Duplex starts at 39 each way in 2nd class or 59 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares. Book early and avoid busy days or dates for the cheapest fares. For a more detailed explanation of fares for the TGV see the Paris to Barcelona TGV page, for Eurostar see the London to Paris by Eurostar page.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBook your hotels\n\nwww.booking.com lets you book accommodation with free cancellation - so you can safely book with zero risk before train bookings open. Any hotel with a review score over 8.0 will usually be pretty good.\n\nClick here for suggested hotels in Barcelona, either near the station or in the old town.\n\nBook at www.raileurope.com\n\nRaileurope.com connects to the British, French & Spanish ticketing systems so you can buy all your tickets from the UK to Spain in one place, in plain English, in , £ or $. There's a small booking fee. You print your own tickets or can show them on your phone. Who are Raileurope.com?\n\nWhen does booking open?\n\nEurostar opens up to 11 months ahead, Paris-Barcelona TGVs up to 6 months ahead.\n\nHowever, it's often less than this and data may be incomplete more than 3-6 months ahead. I recommend waiting until both trains are open for sale so you can confirm times & prices before buying a non-refundable Eurostar ticket. On Paris-Barcelona, dates after the mid-December timetable change (including Christmas & New Year) usually open in mid-October.\n\nSpanish trains open anything from 15 days to 6 months ahead, Renfe loads trains when they feel like it, only weeks ahead on some routes, months ahead on routes where they have competition. Feel free to book Eurostar & TGV first, onward Spanish trains later.\n\nMore about when train bookings open. You can book hotels before booking your trains risk-free if you use www.booking.com with free cancellation.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead\n\nFares are dynamic like air fares, so book early and search for the cheapest departures. The cheapest tickets mean no refunds, no changes.\n\nOut one way, back another?\n\nYou can go out one way & back another. Almost all European trains are priced one-way, where a return is simply two one-ways. I find it easier to book one way at a time.\n\nBut Eurostar is an exception with return fares that are cheaper than two one-ways, so book Eurostar as a London-Paris round trip or a London-Lille round trip if you can.\n\nHow to book\n\nFirst, a reality check. You can't just put London to Malaga into a journey planner and expect it to book you from London to Barcelona, arrange a hotel and 8am wake-up call, then book you from Barcelona to Malaga after breakfast. Systems aren't that clever!\n\nYou can book from London to Barcelona as one transaction, but if you're going further into Spain, or want to stop overnight in Paris, you need to split the booking.\n\nMethod 1 is easiest. Use this if you are travelling from London to Barcelona in a single day, one-way or return, with or without an onward train further into Spain the following day.\n\nMethod 2 can cope with more complex journeys, including ones involving an overnight stop in Paris on the way out or the way back, or using different routes out & back.\n\nIncidentally, there are no through tickets from London to Spain, however you book you get a Eurostar ticket to Paris, a French ticket from Paris to Barcelona and separate onward Renfe tickets. But connections across Paris are protected by the Railteam/HOTNAT and AJC.\n\nMethod 1\n\n1. Go to www.raileurope.com\n\n2. Enter London to Barcelona, number of passengers, date of travel, set departure time 07:00.\n\n3. If you're coming back and will also be going Barcelona to London in a single day, enter your return date with departure time set to 10:00.\n\nOn French & Spanish trains a return is two one ways, but on Eurostar, return fares are significantly cheaper than two one ways so a round trip involving Eurostar should always be booked as a return.\n\n4. Now the science bit. Click More options and enter Paris Nord as a via station with stopover duration set to 1 hour (to guarantee a minimum acceptable 1 hour between trains in Paris) or 2 hours (a more robust connection, recommended) or 3 hours (for lunch in Paris). Otherwise the system may offer risky cross-Paris connections as tight as 42 minutes. Advice on crossing Paris.\n\n5. Run the enquiry. Look in the search results for journeys with 1 change. Add to basket.\n\n6. If you are staying overnight in Barcelona and travelling on to Madrid, Seville, Malaga, Alicante or wherever next day, book a suitable onward train as a second separate booking and add to basket.\n\n7. If you're making a round trip, book from Seville, Malaga, Alicante (or wherever) to Barcelona for the day before your return journey from Barcelona to London, as a third separate booking, and add to your basket.\n\n8. Check out, paying for all tickets as one transaction.\n\nMethod 2\n\nFirst, read the relevant destination section on this page and find a train service that suits you, out & back. By all means go out one way and back another, or go outward with an overnight stop in Paris, back with an overnight stop in Barcelona, whatever. Note down each individual train you want to book, on what specific date. Then go to www.raileurope.com.\n\nStep 1, book your chosen train from Paris to Barcelona, one-way, add to basket. This is the crucial train so do this first & confirm times.\n\nStep 2, book your chosen train from Barcelona to Paris, one-way, and add to basket. Confirm times.\n\nStep 3, book the Eurostar from London to Paris & back as a round trip and add to basket.\n\nEurostar return fares are cheaper than two one ways, so a round trip on Eurostar should always be booked as a return.\n\nUse the suggested Eurostar times on this page as a guide, but by all means book an earlier Eurostar than the one I suggest going out, or a later one coming back, if you'd prefer a more robust connection (as I do), if the fare is cheaper, or if you want to have lunch in Paris (also me!).\n\nJust remember that with this method, it's up to you to make sure there's at least 60 minutes between trains in Paris southbound, 90 minutes northbound (to include the Eurostar check-in), ideally 2 hours. So engage brain! Advice on crossing Paris.\n\nStep 4, if you are travelling beyond Barcelona, book a suitable train from Barcelona to Seville, Malaga, Alicante (or wherever), add to basket. If you're making a same-day connection in Barcelona, look for a train leaving Barcelona at least 1 hour after the TGV from Paris arrives.\n\nStep 5, if you're coming back, book your train from Seville, Malaga, Alicante (or wherever) to Barcelona & add to basket. If you're making a same-day connection in Barcelona, book a train which arrives in Barcelona at least 1 hour before the TGV to Paris leaves.\n\nCheck out, paying for all tickets as one transaction.\n\nTravelling from the UK regions\n\nRaileurope can book journeys starting from any British station, not just London. It allows about an hour for Eurostar check-in.\n\nHowever, consider booking from London to Spain first, then buying a separate ticket from your local station to London. There are 2 reasons to do this: First, you might want a more robust connection between trains in London, say 2 hours. Second, Raileurope doesn't sell the special tickets to London International CIV which can sometimes save you money in the weekday morning peak, learn about these here.\n\nChildren & infants\n\nChildren under 12 qualify for the child rate on Eurostar, the TGV and trains in Spain.\n\nOn Eurostar & TGV, infants under 4 travel free, no need to buy them a ticket, just bring them along. But they don't get their own seat.\n\nTip: You can give an infant their own seat on the Paris-Barcelona TGV for 9 with a Billet Bambin. Add the infant to your booking with their age.\n\nImportant: On Spanish long-distance trains, infants under 4 travel free, but need a ticket. When booking Spanish domestic trains you should add your infant to the booking to get a 0 infant ticket. If you forget, ask for one at a Renfe ticket office before boarding, see advice here.\n\nChoose an upper deck seat on a TGV Duplex\n\nAn upstairs seat gives the best views on the double-deck TGV Duplex. www.raileurope.com allows you to choose upper or lower deck when you book. Seats 11-58 are lower deck, 61-128 are upper deck, see TGV Duplex seating plan, Euroduplex type.\n\nTGV fare expensive?\n\nParis-Barcelona fares start from 39, but if fares on your date of travel are expensive, see these tips that might make it cheaper.\n\nAfter booking, you can change your Eurostar seats\n\nAfter you've booked using www.raileurope.com, you can go to www.eurostar.com and use the Manage booking feature to change your Eurostar seats, see instructions & tips for choosing seats here.\n\nYou can also download the Eurostar app and load your Eurostar booking into it using the 6-character booking reference. You can then manage your booking in the app should you need to change it.\n\nTrain seat maps: See Eurostar, TGV & Spanish train seat maps.\n\nWhen two TGV units run coupled, the first unit is numbered 1-8, the second as 11-18, so if you're in car 12, look at car 2 on the seat map.\n\nOr book at Thetrainline.com\n\nYou can also book trains from London to Spain at www.thetrainline.com.\n\nLike Raileurope, it connects to the Eurostar, SNCF (French Railways) and Renfe (Spanish Railways) ticketing systems so you can easily book all your tickets in one place, in plain English, in , £ or $ with overseas credit cards no problem. Who are Thetrainline.com?\n\nMost of the Raileurope booking tips above also apply to booking on www.thetrainline.com.\n\nThetrainline.com can do several things Raileurope.com can't: It can sell Espace Privatif on overnight trains between Paris and the Spanish border and it can sell tickets with a Carte Avantage discount if you have such a card.\n\nThetrainline.com lets you choose your seat from a seat map on the Paris-Barcelona TGV if booking 1st class.\n\nHowever, Raileurope.com has a killer advantage, you can specify a via station with a stopover duration. This is really useful for a London-Barcelona journey where you want to allow sufficient time in Paris.\n\nWhen using Thetrainline.com you can specify a via, but not the duration, so I recommend using method 2.\n\nApart from these differences you should find prices are the same on both sites, it really comes down to personal preference.\n\nOr book at eurostar.com + sncf-connect.com + renfe.com\n\nYou can of course book each train separately with the relevant operator. It's more work than using Raileurope or Thetrainline and the operator sites can be more fiddly to use, fares should be the same. But there's no booking fee and in some cases you can select seats from a seat map.\n\nMost of the Raileurope booking tips also apply to booking this way.\n\nStep 1, go to www.sncf-connect.com and book from Paris to Barcelona, looking for the direct TGV. You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone. When booking 1st class on the TGV, www.sncf-connect.com lets you choose seats from a seat map.\n\nStep 2, go to www.eurostar.com and book a connecting Eurostar from London to Paris & back, allowing at least 60 minutes to cross Paris on the outward, 90 minutes on your return (including the 30-minute Eurostar check-in). You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone. You can also book Eurostar at www.sncf-connect.com if you prefer, to keep all bookings together.\n\nUse the Eurostar times on this page as a guide, but by all means choose an earlier Eurostar from London or a later Eurostar back from Paris if these are cheaper or if you'd like to stop off in Paris\n\nStep 3, go to the Spanish Railways website www.renfe.com and book trains from Barcelona to Madrid, Seville, Malaga, Alicante, Algeciras and so on. However, given Renfe's quirky translations and fussy payment system which has been known to reject some overseas cards, it's easier to use www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com which sell Renfe tickets with a small booking fee. Remember to include babies and infants in your booking when buying train tickets within Spain, see the advice here.\n\nOr use an Interrail pass\n\nPass or point to point?\n\nLet's be clear, a pass will usually not save money over the cheapest point-to-point advance-purchase fares you might see if you book a few months ahead. But when point-to-point fares for Eurostar & TGV are expensive (for example, at short notice) OR you want flexibility, for example the ability to change your mind, re-route or reschedule, you can travel from the UK to Spain & back using an Interrail pass.\n\nIf flexibility is what you want, buy the pass. If it's about saving money, you'll have to check point-to-point prices and do the maths.\n\nIt's worth doing the maths if you are under 28, if you have kids (kids get a free pass when accompanying an adult but still need to pay reservation fees) or if you live a long way from London (as a pass covers you from your home station to London). Passes are available in 1st & 2nd class.\n\nBe aware that Spain is not a pass-friendly country because every long-distance train and even some regional ones requires a reservation in addition to the pass, and some reservations can be difficult (or even impossible) to make outside Spain. Within Spain, point-to-point tickets can be easier! More about passholder reservations in Spain.\n\nHow to use a pass for a trip to Spain\n\nStep 1, buy a 4-days in 1-month Interrail pass from www.raileurope.com (click Rail passes and select Europe) or www.interrail.eu, see pass prices on the Interrail page. You load the pass into the Railplanner app on your phone.\n\nA 4-day pass is sufficient to get from almost anywhere in mainland Britain to Barcelona, Valencia or Alicante & back, or from London to almost anywhere in Spain & back, but you might need a longer pass to get from Inverness to Santiago de Compostela!\n\nA 4-day pass gives you unlimited train travel on any 4 dates you choose in an overall 1 month period. The first travel day can be any date you select in the 11 months after buying it, the 1 month period starts from that date. More about how Interrail passes work.\n\nStep 2, you need a Eurostar passholder ticket from London to Paris & back, see cost of Eurostar reservations & how to make them. Tip: Eurostar passholder availability is limited, check availability before buying a pass.\n\nStep 3, if you're using a Paris-Barcelona TGV you need a passholder reservation, see cost of reservations & how to make them.\n\nBy all means go out one way, back another, with Interrail you can use almost any of the trains & routes to/from Spain shown on this page including the overnight trains to Latour de Carol or Cerbère, find out how to reserve each train using the Interrail reservations guide.\n\nStep 4, you need a passholder reservation for each high-speed train you take in Spain, see cost of reservations & how to make them.\n\nOr have your trip arranged as a package\n\nByway (Byway.travel) is a new UK-based eco-holiday firm with a 5-star TrustPilot rating. If you're nervous about booking train travel yourself, they'll book a London-Spain journey for you as a package, including overnight hotels, starting from any British station you like. Byway includes package protection, Covid refund guarantee, free disruption & re-planning & on-demand WhatsApp support while you're away.\n\nTo see pre-configured packages UK to Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Granada or San Sebastian, use the journey planner on their website.\n\nTip: First book a one-way outward journey to your destination city on your outward date. Then change the direction of the arrow and book an inward journey on your return date.

You can usually only phone during office hours, online booking is 24/7. But if you want to book by phone, see my list of UK ticketing agencies.\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\n1. London to Paris by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Paris in 2h20, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Standard Premier and Business Premier fares include a light meal with wine (or breakfast, on departures before 11:00). There's a 30-minute minimum check-in as all border formalities are carried out before you board. More about Eurostar & check-in procedure. St Pancras station guide. Paris Nord station guide. How to change trains & stations in Paris.\n\nLunch in Paris?\n\nWhy not allow time for lunch at the famous Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon before catching the Barcelona Express? Or at least have a coffee or beer in the bar, which makes an excellent VIP waiting lounge. More about the Train Bleu restaurant.\n\nThe train to Barcelona leaves from the magnificent Gare de Lyon in central Paris, see station guide.\n\n2. Paris to Barcelona by TGV See video guide\n\nThe Paris-Barcelona trains are impressive 320 km/h (199 mph) TGV Duplex double-deck high-speed trains. You board through a wide sliding door into a small hall at one end of the lower deck. An internal door opens into a lower deck seating area and a short & easy flight of stairs leads from the entrance door to a landing at one end of the upper deck. You walk along the train from car to car at the upper level, the café-bar is also at the upper level. There are toilets & luggage racks both upstairs & downstairs, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. If you have problems with stairs or very heavy luggage, the lower deck might be best. But for the best views (over the top of the occasional sound barrier on the high speed lines), choose an upper deck seat. For couples in first class, an upper deck 'club duo' table-for-two is easily the nicest option. Paris Gare de Lyon station guide. Barcelona Sants station guide.\n\nTGV Duplex at Paris Gare de Lyon. These 320 km/h double-deckers link Paris with Barcelona. Watch TGV Duplex video.\n\n2. Speeding down the Rhone Valley. The train joins the Sud-Est high-speed line and accelerates smoothly to 186mph through the Paris suburbs, soon emerging into open country. The train now speeds along the scenic Rhone Valley, passing pretty French villages with picturesque churches. The dark line of the Massif Central mountains are on the far side of the valley to your right, and on a clear day you can see the snow-capped French Alps in the far distance to your left. The TGV leaves the high-speed line towards Nîmes, continuing on the classic line.\n\nBetween Valence and Nîmes the train crosses a broad stretch of the River Rhone with a view of the wine-producing Chateau de Montfaucon on the right, www.chateaumontfaucon.com.\n\n3. Béziers. After calling at Nimes and Montpelier, the train passes non-stop through Béziers station and crosses the River Orb. Look to your right for a magnificent view of Béziers' 13th century cathedral.\n\nTime for dinner? Above left, food from the cafe-bar, a magret de canard avec pommes de terre and some wine. Or feel free to bring your own picnic and bottle of red!\n\n4. The Mediterranean coast (above left). Between Montpellier & Perpignan the train skirts the glistening Mediterranean coastline with deserted beaches & marshland.\n\n5. Vineyards (above right). The train passes countless vineyards. Glass o' red from the bar car, anyone?\n\n6. Étangs & flamingos. The train passes numerous étangs (lakes), where flocks of flamingos stand one-legged in the shallows.\n\n7. Fort de Salses. Just before Perpignan, the train passes by the impressive Fort de Salses on the right, a 15th-century Catalan fortress captured in 1642 and French-held ever since, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_de_Salses.\n\n8. Mt Canigou & the Pyrenees. One of the highest peaks in the mighty Pyrenees, the 2,784m (9,137 feet) high Mt Canigou dominates the skyline on the right all the way from Perpignan to Girona, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou.\n\n9. Barcelona Sants is in central Barcelona with plenty of taxis and a modern metro to all parts of Barcelona. There are left luggage lockers (consigna), bars & restaurants.

London to Barcelona with one easy same-station change in Lille and another in Nimes. I think Nîmes makes the best stopover given the timings, but the direct AVE from Nimes to Madrid also calls at Avignon TGV, Montpelier and Perpignan, so you could stop overnight at any of those places instead.\n\nLondon ► Barcelona\n\nDay 1, travel from London to Lille by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 13:01 & arriving Lille Europe at 15:27.\n\nThe Eurostar has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nAt Lille Europe it's an easy same-station change, with time for a coffee or beer between trains.\n\nDay 1, travel from Lille to Nimes by TGV, leaving Lille Europe at 17:01 and arriving Nîmes Centre 21:39.\n\nThe TGV has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.

The Ibis Styles Nimes Gare next door is a more upmarket option, but also inexpensive with good reviews.\n\nDay 2, travel from Nîmes to Lille Europe by high-speed TGV with cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nOn Mondays-Fridays you leave Nimes Pont du Gard at 09:33 and arrive Lille Europe at 14:24.\n\nOn Saturdays & Sundays you leave Nimes Centre at 09:27 and arrive Lille Europe at 14:18.\n\nNimes Centre is the original station in the city centre. Nimes Pont du Gard is a new out-of-town station several kilometres outside the city, so you'll need a taxi or bus to reach it, or there's a regional train leaving Nîmes' city centre station at 08:50 which connects with the TGV, check times when you book.\n\nAt Lille Europe it's an easy same-station change onto Eurostar.\n\nDay 2, travel from Lille to London by Eurostar, leaving Lille Europe at 15:30 arriving London St Pancras at 15:57.\n\nThe Eurostar has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nAlternatively, spend a morning in Nimes and leave Nîmes' city centre station at 15:19, change at Lille and arrive London St Pancras 21:57 (21:27 Saturdays).

One of the highest peaks in the mighty Pyrenees, the 2,784m (9,137 feet) high Mt Canigou dominates the skyline on the right all the way from Perpignan to Girona, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou.\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 3, London to Barcelona overnight via Latour de Carol & the Pyrenees\n\nThe scenic route! The Elipsos sleeper trains from Paris to Barcelona & Madrid were sadly discontinued in December 2013, but it's still possible to leave London in the late afternoon by Eurostar, sleep in a couchette on an overnight train from Paris to the Pyrenees, then take a scenic local train into Barcelona. It's an interesting alternative to the high-speed option with great scenery through the Pyrenees, watch the video here. See route map.\n\nLondon ► Barcelona\n\nStep 1, travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 15:31 arriving Paris Gare du Nord at 18:50.\n\nCross Paris by taxi or métro to the Gare d'Austerlitz.\n\nThere's a later Eurostar at 16:31, but I recommend taking an earlier departure for a more robust connection and to have dinner in Paris at the Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon. After dinner, stroll over the bridge across the Seine to the Gare d'Austerlitz.\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to Latour de Carol by sleeper train, leaving Paris Gare d'Austerlitz at 21:40, arriving Latour de Carol at 10:07.\n\nThis is a French Intercité de Nuit overnight train with 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & reclining seats. The train has power sockets at all berths & free WiFi. More about Intercités de Nuit. Exact times may vary.\n\nIf you want privacy you can book a whole 1st class 4-berth compartment for 1, 2 or 3 people (or a whole 2nd class 6-berth compartment for 5 people) by paying the Espace Privatif supplement.\n\nThis train runs every day all year round, but engineering work sometimes affects it so check that it's running on your specific date using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com. It should open for booking 4 months ahead, but sometimes less than this.\n\nThe last hour into the Pyrenees is wonderfully scenic, past the castle at Foix (on the right hand side just after the station) and up into the mountains - at Porté-Puymorens (the last station just before Latour) the train reaches the highest point on any normal standard-gauge railway in Europe, 1,562m (5,125 feet) above sea level. The railway from Toulouse to Foix opened in 1862, but the difficult line beyond Foix through the Pyrenees to Latour de Carol only opened in 1929.\n\nLatour de Carol is a vast but little-used border station in the middle of nowhere, ringed by mountains, where the French Railways standard gauge line ends and the Spanish Railways Iberian gauge line to Barcelona begins. It's almost unique in being served by trains of three different track gauges: Spanish broad gauge from Barcelona, French standard gauge to Toulouse and Paris, and French narrow gauge as it's also the terminus for the celebrated Petit Train Jaune. It's sometimes known as Latour de Carol-Enveitg, and in Catalan it's La Tor de Querol-Enveig.\n\nYou can have breakfast in the Bistro de la Gare on the station forecourt, www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune.\n\nStep 3, travel from Latour de Carol to Barcelona by local train, leaving Latour at 10:25 & arriving Barcelona Sants at 13:45.\n\nThe local train is comfortable, air-conditioned with 2nd class seats. It's a lovely & scenic run, twisting through the Spanish side of the Pyrenees before reaching the Barcelona suburbs. There's no catering, so bring your own food & drink. The next local train is at 13:26, should the sleeper be late.\n\nImportant: You will not, I repeat, not find this train listed on normal journey planners, so read the following paragraph carefully!!!!\n\nYou can check times from La Tor de Querol to Barcelona Sants at the special Barcelona suburban trains website, rodalies.gencat.cat/en as this route is classed suburban in spite of being rural.\n\nYou can also check times at www.renfe.com, but it will not be shown in the main Renfe journey planner, you have to do it like this: Click the globe symbol top right & select Ingles for English. Ignore the main journey planner, hover over Cercanias (Commuter) top left and click on Rodalies Catalunya. Search from La Tor de Querol-Enveig to Barcelona Sants. Easy when you know.\n\nBarcelona ► London\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to La Tour de Carol by local train, leaving Barcelona Sants at 14:31 arriving Latour de Carol at 17:51.\n\nThe local train is comfortable, air-conditioned with 2nd class seats. There's no catering, so bring your own food & drink. It's a lovely scenic run up into the Pyrenees. There's not much at Latour de Carol, a huge but under-used border station in the middle of nowhere, ringed by mountains, so bring your own supplies or check if the Bistro de la Gare on the station forecourt will be open, see www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune.\n\nYou will not, I repeat, not find this local train listed on normal journey planners, so read the following paragraphs carefully!!\n\nYou can easily check times for the Barcelona Sants to La Tor de Querol train for your date of travel at the special Barcelona suburban trains website rodalies.gencat.cat/en, as this route is classed as a Barcelona suburban train in spite of being very rural.\n\nYou can also check times at www.renfe.com, but it will not be shown in the main Renfe journey planner, you have to do it like this: Click the globe symbol top right & select Ingles for English.

Easy when you know how.\n\nStep 2, travel from Latour de Carol to Paris by sleeper train, leaving Latour de Carol at 18:50 & arriving Paris Gare d'Austerlitz 07:03.\n\nThis is a French Intercité de Nuit overnight train with 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & reclining seats. The train has power sockets at all berths & free WiFi. More about Intercités de Nuit. Exact times may vary.\n\nIf you want privacy you can book a whole 1st class 4-berth compartment for 1, 2 or 3 people (or a whole 2nd class 6-berth compartment for 5 people) by paying the Espace Privatif supplement.\n\nIn summer when it's light, the first hour and a half twisting and turning through the Pyrenees is beautifully scenic. At Porté-Puymorens, the first station after Latour, the train passes the highest point on any normal standard-gauge railway in Europe, 1,562m (5,125 feet) above sea level. Watch out for the impressive castle at Foix, on the left. The railway from Foix to Toulouse opened in 1862, but the difficult line through the Pyrenees from Latour de Carol to Foix only opened in 1929.\n\nThis train runs every day all year round, but times vary and engineering work sometimes affects it so check for your specific date at www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com. It should open for booking 4 months ahead, but often less than this.\n\nIn Paris, cross by métro or taxi to the Gare du Nord.\n\nStep 3, travel from Paris to London by Eurostar, leaving Paris Gare du Nord at 09:12 and arriving London St Pancras 10:30.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Latour de Carol starts at 20 in a reclining seat, 35 in a 6-berth 2nd class couchette or 63 in a 4-berth 1st class couchette. Like Eurostar, fares vary dynamically like air fares.\n\nLatour de Carol to Barcelona costs a fixed-price 12, paid in cash on the train, no reservation or pre-booking necessary or possible.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nStep 1, book from London to Latour de Carol at www.raileurope.com.\n\nIt's easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit or debit cards no problem, and you either print your own tickets or can show them on your phone. There's a small booking fee. Booking for Eurostar opens 6 months ahead. Booking for French trains opens up to 4 months ahead, but for Intercités de Nuit it can be less than this.\n\nYou can book from London to Latour all in one go, but it's better to split the booking like this: First book from London (or any station in Britain) to Paris and back, add to basket, then book the overnight train from Paris to Latour de Carol one-way and add to basket, then book Latour de Carol to Paris one-way and add to basket, then check out.\n\nThis way you can mix & match a 2nd class seat on Eurostar with a 1st class 4-berth couchette on the overnight train, and you can book an earlier Eurostar if it has cheaper seats available or if you'd like more time in Paris. Southbound when catching a sleeper, I'd allow at least 2h between trains across Paris. Northbound, I'd allow at least 2h between trains to include the Eurostar check-in.\n\nAlternatively, you can book from London to Paris at www.eurostar.com, then book the Paris to Latour couchette train at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com, more work but no booking fee.\n\nStep 2, the local ticket from Latour de Carol to Barcelona cannot be booked online and doesn't need to be booked in advance.\n\nSouthbound, simply get on the train and pay the conductor on board in cash, no reservation is necessary or possible, it cannot sell out. This ticket can't even be bought from the French SNCF-run ticket office at Latour de Carol. I repeat, simply get on the train and pay on board! It's a good idea to have cash on you in case their card machine doesn't work, but conductors on this route can now take credit cards.\n\nNorthbound, buy a ticket to Latour de Carol on the day at Barcelona Sants station, either from the staffed counters or self-service ticket machines. Tickets cannot sell out, it's only a local train.\n\nOr use an Interrail pass\n\nSee the advice here.\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\n1. London to Paris by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Paris in 2h20, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats and free WiFi.

It's similar to option 3, but instead of going straight through the Pyrenees using the overnight train from Paris to Latour de Carol, you use the Paris-Perpignan-Cerbère night train and go around the southern end of the Pyrenees. The sleeper runs along the scenic Côte Vermeille coastline through Collioure & Port-Vendres to Cerbère, you then take a local train from Cerbère to Figueres, Girona & Barcelona. Or you can get off the sleeper at Perpignan and take a high-speed train to Barcelona, which is faster but more expensive. The Paris-Cerbère sleeper is a useful alternative to the Paris-Latour de Carol train, as sometimes the Paris-Cerbère train runs when the one to Latour de Carol is affected by engineering work. However, the Paris-Cerbère sleeper isn't daily all year, it's daily in summer, only on Fridays & Sundays at other times. See route map.\n\nLondon ► Barcelona\n\nStep 1, travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 15:31 arriving Paris Gare du Nord at 18:50.\n\nCross Paris by taxi or métro to the Gare d'Austerlitz.\n\nThere's a later Eurostar at 16:31, but I recommend taking an earlier departure for a more robust connection and to have dinner in Paris at the Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon.

It also runs daily 9-25 February, 5-21 April & 5 July to late August 2024. Timings vary, leaves Paris at 20:08 some dates.\n\nThis is a French Intercité de Nuit overnight train with 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & reclining seats.

I've seen it open for booking as little as a month ahead.\n\nBeyond Perpignan, the train runs along the beautiful Côte Vermeille through Port Vendres & Collioure, with great sea views.\n\nStep 3, travel from Perpignan or Cerbère to Barcelona:\n\nThe fastest option is to get off the sleeper at Perpignan and use the new high-speed line to Barcelona. A high-speed AVE leaves Perpignan at 11:18 arriving Barcelona Sants at 12:38. It also calls at Figueres Vilafant & Girona.\n\nThis train has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. There are great views of Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees. More about AVE S100 trains.\n\nThe cheapest option is to stay on the sleeper to Cerbère and use the slower classic route along the coast. A local train leaves Cerbère 12:04 on weekdays, arriving Barcelona Sants 15:10. On Saturdays & Sundays, leave Cerbère 11:46, arriving Barcelona Sants 15:10.\n\nThese are local trains which you won't find in normal train booking systems, to check times use rodalies.gencat.cat/en. These trains also stop at Figueres (for the wonderful Salvador Dali museum) and Girona. It's 2nd class only, there's no catering so bring your own food & drink.\n\nBarcelona ► London\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to either Cerbère or Perpignan:\n\nThe cheapest option is to use the slower classic route along the coast.

I've seen it open for booking as little as a month ahead.\n\nStep 3, travel from Paris to London by Eurostar, normally leaving Paris Gare du Nord at 09:12 and arriving London St Pancras 10:30.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Perpignan or Cerbère starts at 20 in a reclining seat, 35 in a 6-berth 2nd class couchette or 63 in a 4-berth 1st class couchette. A couchette is recommended whatever your budget, for comfort & security. Like Eurostar, fares vary dynamically.\n\nPerpignan to Barcelona by high-speed train starts at 25 in 2nd class or 45 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nCerbère to Barcelona by local train costs around 14, fixed-price, any day, any date, buy at the station.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nStep 1, book from London to Perpignan or Cerbère at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nAnyone can use these sites, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, you print your own tickets or can show them on your phone. There's a small booking fee. Booking for Eurostar opens 6 months ahead. Booking for French trains opens up to 4 months ahead, but for Intercités de Nuit it can be less than this.\n\nIt's best to split the booking like this: First book from London to Paris & back and add to basket. Then book the overnight train from Paris to Perpignan or Cerbère & back and add to basket, then check out.\n\nThis way you can mix & match a 2nd class seat on Eurostar with a 1st class 4-berth couchette on the overnight train, and you can book an earlier Eurostar if it has cheaper seats available or if you'd like more time in Paris. Southbound when catching a sleeper, I'd allow at least 2h between trains across Paris. Northbound, I'd allow at least 2h between trains to include the Eurostar check-in.\n\nAlternatively, you can book from London to Paris at www.eurostar.com, then book the sleeper train at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com, more work but no booking fee.\n\nStep 2 if you plan to use the AVE between Perpignan and Barcelona: Book this as a one-way or round trip at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com and add it to your basket as a final booking before checking out. You can also book this train www.renfe.com (more fiddly, see my advice on using it).\n\nStep 2 if you plan to use the local train between Cerbère & Barcelona: Buy this at the station, the price is fixed, it cannot sell out, no prior reservation is necessary or even possible, it's only a local ticket,\n\nOr use an Interrail pass\n\nSee the advice here.\n\nWhat's the journey like?\n\n1. London to Paris by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Paris in 2h20, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats and free WiFi. Standard Premier and Business Premier fares include a light meal with wine (or breakfast, on departures before 11:00). There's a 30-minute minimum check-in as all border formalities are carried out before you board the train. More about Eurostar & check-in procedure. St Pancras station guide.

Paris to Perpignan or Cerbère by French overnight train\n\nThe intercité de nuit overnight train from Paris to Perpignan & Cerbère has 1st class couchettes in 4-berth compartments & 2nd class couchettes in 6-berth compartments, each bunk supplied with lightweight sleeping-bag & mineral water. More about intercités de nuit. Watch the video guide. Paris Austerlitz station guide.\n\n2nd class 6-berth couchettes.\n\nA cosy 2nd class couchette.\n\n3. Cerbère to Figueres, Girona & Barcelona by local train\n\nThis is a simple local train, technically classified suburban (Cercanias in Spanish, Rodalies in Catalan). 2nd class only, no catering so have some supplies with you.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Madrid & Zaragoza\n\nThe Elipsos sleeper train from Paris to Madrid was discontinued in 2013 and is sadly missed, but it's still easy to travel from London or Paris to Madrid by train, with an overnight stop in Paris or Barcelona. If you want to avoid crossing Paris, option 2 takes you London-Lille-Nîmes on day 1, overnight stop, then Nîmes to Madrid by direct high-speed AVE on day 2. Also worth considering is the northern route in option 3 with an overnight stop in San Sebastian, this can often be cheaper.\n\nFor Zaragoza, use either option 1 or 2, simply book from Barcelona or Nîmes to Zaragoza instead of Madrid.\n\nWhich route to choose?\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & Paris-Barcelona TGV with overnight stop in either Paris or Barcelona - fastest way, with two departures per day\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & Lille-Nîmes TGV, with overnight stop in Nîmes - avoids crossing Paris if that's important to you\n\nOption 3, by Eurostar & Paris-Hendaye TGV with overnight stop in San Sebastian - often cheapest, with a chance to see Basque country.\n\nOption 4, by ferry from Portsmouth to Santander or Bilbao then train - the ferry alternative!\n\nOption 1, London to Madrid via Barcelona\n\nLondon ► Madrid (morning departure, overnight in Barcelona)\n\nDay 1, travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 09:31 every day, arriving Paris Gare du Nord 12:50.\n\nCross Paris by metro or taxi to the Gare de Lyon, just 2 stops on RER line D. Why not book an earlier Eurostar and have lunch at the wonderful Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon?\n\nDay 1, travel from Paris to Barcelona by TGV Duplex, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 14:42 and arriving Barcelona Sants 21:27.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class, café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. I recommend an upper deck seat for the best views, any seat number >60 is upper deck.\n\nThe train speeds along the Rhône valley past pretty French villages & picturesque churches, then look out for colonies of flamingos on the étangs in southern France, the Fort de Salses on the right approaching Perpignan and great views of Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees.\n\nStay overnight in Barcelona. The Hotel Barcelo Sants is top choice here, it's located above Barcelona Sants station itself and gets great reviews, with nice rooms, a great breakfast buffet and a delightfully kitsch space theme. Alternatively, the Nobu Hotel and AC Sants Hotel by Marriot are both just across the road from the station. Other suggested hotels near the station.\n\nDay 2, travel from Barcelona Sants to Madrid Atocha by AVE S103 high-speed train using any suitable departure.\n\nThese leave almost every hour taking as little as 2h30 at up to 320 km/h.

If you buy a Premium ticket you can use the Sala Club 1st class lounge at Barcelona Sants for up to 2 hours before your train leaves.\n\nLondon ► Madrid (evening departure, overnight in Paris)\n\nDay 1, travel from London to Paris by any evening Eurostar you like.\n\nThe last Eurostar leaves London St Pancras at 20.01 arriving Paris Gare du Nord 23:18, but by all means book an earlier one.\n\nCross Paris by metro or taxi to the Gare de Lyon.\n\nStay overnight in Paris. If you want a hotel room on arrival at the Gare du Nord, I recommend the excellent 25 Hours Terminus Nord, directly across the road from the Gare du Nord with great reviews & great feedback from Seat61 users. If you'd rather stay at the Gare de Lyon ready for the morning train to Spain, the Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon is part of the Gare de Lyon station complex with great reviews for staff, cleanliness & comfort.

Remember that at Spanish stations there's a brief X-ray baggage check at the entrance to the platforms for long-distance & high-speed trains.\n\nMadrid ► London (in a single day)\n\nStep 1, travel from Madrid to Barcelona by lo-cost Avlo train, leaving Madrid Atocha at 06:15 arriving Barcelona Sants at 08:45.\n\nThe lo-cost Avlo train is one-class only, no catering, free WiFi. Check the baggage limits & fees carefully.\n\nStep 2, travel from Barcelona to Paris by TGV Duplex, leaving Barcelona Sants at 09:28 and arriving Paris Gare de Lyon at 16:12.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class, café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nBook an upper deck seat for the best views as the train rolls past Mt Canigou in the Pyrenees, colonies of flamingos on the étangs in southern France, then speeds along the Rhone Valley towards Paris.

If you book this later TGV, you can leave Madrid Atocha on a later 11:30 AVE to Barcelona.\n\nThe TGV Duplex is a 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck high-speed train with 1st & 2nd class & café-bar. Book an upper deck seat for the best views as the train rolls past colonies of flamingos on the étangs in southern France, then speeds along the scenic Rhone Valley towards Paris.\n\nChange stations in Paris by metro or taxi from the Gare de Lyon to the Gare du Nord.\n\nStay overnight in Paris.

London to Madrid with just one easy same-station change in Lille and another in Nimes. I reckon Nîmes makes the best stopover given the timings, but the direct AVE from Nimes to Madrid also calls at Avignon TGV, Montpelier and Perpignan, so you could stop overnight at any of those places instead.\n\nLondon ► Madrid\n\nDay 1, travel from London to Lille by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 13:01 & arriving Lille Europe at 15:27.\n\nThe Eurostar has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nAt Lille Europe it's an easy same-station change, with time for a coffee or beer between trains.\n\nDay 1, travel from Lille to Nimes by TGV, leaving Lille Europe at 17:01 & arriving Nîmes Centre at 21:39.\n\nThe TGV has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.

With the onward French & Spanish trains it doesn't matter, a return is simply two one-ways.\n\nIf you have any problems getting it to offer a journey via Lille, book London to Lille & back, add to basket, book Lille to Nîmes, add to basket, book Nîmes to Lille, add to basket & check out. It makes no difference to the price and it's separate tickets either side of Lille in any case.\n\nStep 2, still on www.raileurope.com, book from Nimes to Madrid one-way and add to basket.

The Renfe station is currently being reconstructed, access to the platforms is on the far side of the tracks so allow a little extra time.\n\nStay overnight in San Sebastian, a lovely city, well worth a longer stop. The Pension San Ignacio Centro is just 10 minutes walk from San Sebastian Renfe station and gets great reviews. If you want somewhere in the old town try the Pension Garibai or Pension Alameda. If you want to push the boat out, San Sebastian's most venerable hotel (which I can recommend personally, having stayed there) is the Hotel de Londres y Inglaterra, on the sea front.\n\nDay 2, travel from San Sebastian to Madrid by Alvia S120 train, leaving San Sebastian Renfe station at 09:02 arriving Madrid Chamartin at 13:56.\n\nIf you need to be in Madrid earlier, on Mondays-Fridays an Intercity train leaves San Sebastian at 05:02 arriving Madrid Chamartin at 09:57.\n\nIf you'd like a day in San Sebastian, there are afternoon trains too, check at www.thetrainline.com, www.raileurope.com or www.renfe.com.\n\nThese smart Alvia & Intercity trains have a cafe-bar and power sockets at all seats, a pleasure to travel in.

They then complete the second half of the journey over classic lines, with great scenery winding up into the Pyrenees approaching San Sebastian.\n\nIn San Sebastian it's a 10 minute walk from the Renfe station to Euskotren's Amara station, see walking route.\n\nStay overnight in San Sebastian, a lovely city, well worth a longer stop.

Cross Paris by metro or taxi to the Gare du Nord.\n\nDay 2, travel from Paris to London by Eurostar, leaving Paris Gare du Nord at 17:12 arriving in London St Pancras at 18:32.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Hendaye by TGV starts at 25 each way.\n\nHendaye to San Sebastian costs 2.75, paid at the station on the day.\n\nSan Sebastian to Madrid starts at 17 in 2nd class (standard) or 22 in 1st class (comfort), again fares work like air fares so book ahead for the cheapest prices.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nGo to www.raileurope.com.

If returning, book Madrid to San Sebastian as a second one-way journey and add that to your basket. Then check out and pay for all journeys as one transaction.\n\nThe Euskotren ticket between Hendaye & San Sebastian can be bought on the day at the station with coins or debit/credit card, no problem.\n\nAlternatively, you can book each train separately at the relevant website like this, more work and more fiddly but avoids payi9ng a booking fee. I recommend doing a dry run on all three sites first.\n\nBook from London to Paris at www.eurostar.com with print-at-home tickets and no booking fee.\n\nBook from Paris to Hendaye and (and back, if returning) at www.sncf-connect.com, with print-your-own, show-on-phone or collect-at-station tickets and no booking fee. Make sure you allow at least 60 minutes to change trains & stations in Paris southbound, 90 minutes northbound as this needs to include the 30-minute Eurostar check-in.\n\nBook the train from San Sebastian to Madrid using the Spanish Railways website, www.renfe.com, see this step-by-step guide to booking tickets with renfe.com, no booking fee.

London to Paris by Eurostar: More about Eurostar\n\n2. Paris to Hendaye by TGV Duplex Océane: More about TGV Duplex Océane\n\n3. Hendaye to San Sebastian by Euskotren: See the San Sebastian section below\n\n4. San Sebastian to Madrid by Alvia train\n\nThese smart S120 Alvia trains have a cafe-bar, some but not all have power sockets at seats. There's great scenery winding down out of the Pyrenees after leaving San Sebastian. Alvia trains have adjustable axles so they can leave San Sebastian on the classic Iberian-gauge line, at some point during the journey they pass through a gauge-changing shed at 20 km/h, then they run on the standard-gauge high-speed line at up to 250km/h the rest of the way to Madrid Chamartin.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Malaga, Cordoba, Seville\n\nWhich route to choose?\n\nHere are three good options for travel from the UK to Andalusia & the Costa del Sol, with a fourth in summer. Option 1 is fastest, simplest and usually cheapest, if you don't mind changing trains & stations in Paris. It's too far to do in a day, so an overnight stop is necessary in Barcelona. Option 2 takes a little longer, but involves a same-station connection in Lille so avoids having to cross Paris, with an overnight stop in Nimes in the south of France. Option 3 uses a French couchette train so avoids having to stop overnight in a hotel and involves some nice scenery. You can of course go out one way and back another.\n\nOption 1, London to Cordoba, Seville, Malaga by Eurostar & TGV via Paris, with overnight stop in Barcelona - Simplest, fastest, usually cheapest.\n\nOption 2, London to Cordoba, Seville, Malaga by Eurostar, TGV & AVE via Lille, with overnight stop in Nîmes - avoids crossing Paris, also fast.\n\nOption 3, London to Cordoba & Seville by Eurostar, French sleeper train & onward connections - the sleeper option!\n\nOption 4, London to Cordoba, Seville, Malaga by Eurostar & TGV via Paris, with overnight stop in Paris - runs 6 July to 1 September 2024.\n\nOption 5, London to Spain using a ferry from Portsmouth to Santander or Bilbao - the ferry alternative.\n\nFor Torremolinos, Fuengirola, Marbella & Estepona, travel to Malaga then take a frequent local train as explained here.\n\nOption 1, London to Seville & Malaga with overnight stop in Barcelona\n\nYou can easily travel from London to Seville or Malaga by high-speed trains with an overnight stop in Barcelona.
