        "text": "The R2 is a line of Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona commuter rail service, operated by Renfe Operadora. It is a major northâsouth axis in the Barcelona metropolitan area, running from the southern limits of the province of Girona to the northern limits of the province of Tarragona, via Barcelona. North of Barcelona, the line uses the BarcelonaâCerbÃ¨re railway, running inland through the VallÃ¨s Oriental region. South of Barcelona, it uses the conventional MadridâBarcelona railway, running along the coast through the Garraf region. The R2 had an annual ridership of 33.6 million in 2016, achieving an average weekday ridership of 125,948 according to 2008 data, which makes it the busiest line of the Barcelona commuter rail service.[1][2]\n\nR2\n\nR2 Nord\n\nR2 SudOverviewService typeCommuter railStatusOperationalLocaleBarcelona metropolitan areaFirst service1989 ( )Current operator(s)Renfe OperadoraRidership125,948 (2008)[1]Annual ridership33.6 million (2016)[2]RouteTerminiSant VicenÃ§ de Calders (R2 Sud), Castelldefels (R2), BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport (R2 Nord)\n\nBarcelona EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a (R2 Sud), Granollers Centre (R2), MaÃ§anet-Massanes (R2 Nord)Stops34Distance travelled133 km (83 mi)[1]Average journey time59 minâ1 h 38 minService frequencyEvery 8â60 minLine(s) used\n\nMadridâBarcelona\n\nBarcelonaâEl Prat Airport rail link\n\nBarcelonaâCerbÃ¨re\n\nTechnicalRolling stockCivia, 447 Series, 450 Series and 451 Series EMUsTrack gauge1,668 mm (5 ft5+21â32 in) Iberian gaugeElectrification3,000 V DC overhead linesTrack owner(s)Adif\n\nAll R2 trains use the AragÃ³ Tunnel in Barcelona, where they share tracks with Rodalies de Catalunya's regional rail lines R11, R13, R14, R15 and R16, calling at Sants and Passeig de GrÃ cia stations.[3] The line originally had no branches, with Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders and MaÃ§anet-Massanes serving as its only southernmost and northernmost terminus, respectively. In 2009, it took over the service offered by Barcelona commuter rail service line R10, incorporating the branch lines to BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport and Barcelona's EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a. A new line scheme has been in operation ever since; the services starting or terminating at the airport run north towards MaÃ§anet-Massanes and are designated R2 Nord (\"North\"), whilst the ones starting or terminating at EstaciÃ³ de FraÃ§a run south towards Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders and are designated R2 Sud (\"South\"). The rest of the services, simply designated R2, operate between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre.\n\nTogether with lines R1, R3 and R4, the R2 (then simply numbered line 2) started services in 1989 as one of the first lines of the CercanÃ­as commuter rail system for Barcelona, known as Rodalies Barcelona. In the long-term future, it is projected to take over the R4 south of Barcelona, connecting the inland regions of the Barcelona metropolitan area.\n\nHistory\n\nThe predecessor of the modern-day R2 started operating in 1989 as line 2 of Rodalies Barcelona, the CercanÃ­as commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year. Since its creation until 2009, the R2 had preserved its original line scheme with no branch lines, using only MaÃ§anet-Massanes and Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders stations as its northern and southern terminus, respectively. Due to the construction works of the new Sagrera railway station in Barcelona and the urban renewal project associated with it, the operational capacity at Sant Andreu Comtal railway station and its surroundings was restricted. Consequently, several rail services were modified, with Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona commuter rail service lines R2 and R10 as the most affected. On 31 January 2009, the R10, which linked BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport to Barcelona's EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a, suspended services. The R2 then took over the service offered by the R10, incorporating the branch lines to the airport and EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a, and a new line scheme came into service.[5] The R10 was initially scheduled to resume services two years later.[6]\n\nAccidents and incidents\n\nMain article: Castelldefels train accident\n\nOn 23 June 2010, twelve people were killed and fourteen were injured when an express train ran into them as they were crossing the line at Platja de Castelldefels station.[7]\n\nMain article: 2017 Barcelona train crash\n\nOn 28 July 2017, fifty-four people were injured when a R2 Sud train coming from Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders collided with a buffer stop at Barcelona's EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a terminus.[8]\n\nInfrastructure\n\nLike the rest of Rodalies de Catalunya lines, the R2 runs on the Iberian gauge mainline railway system, which is owned by Adif, an agency of the Spanish government. All of the railway lines carrying Rodalies de Catalunya services are electrified at 3,000 volts (V) direct current (DC) using overhead lines. The R2 operates on a total line length of 133 kilometres (83 mi), which is entirely double-track, except for the single-track section between El Prat de Llobregat and BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport stations.[9] The trains on the line call at up to 34 stations, using the following railway lines, in order from south to north:[10]\n\nFromToRailway lineRoute number Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders (PK 618)Barcelona Sants (PK 677.6)MadridâBarcelona200 Airport (PK 0)El Prat de Llobregat (PK 6.7)AirportâEl Prat de Llobregat254 Barcelona Sants (PK 99)Barcelona EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a (PK 106.6)MadridâBarcelona260 AragÃ³ Junction (PK 108.3)\n\n(after Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia station)Sant Andreu Comtal (PK 113.2)AragÃ³ Tunnel268 Sant Andreu Comtal (PK 113.2)MaÃ§anet-Massanes (PK 175.9)BarcelonaâCerbÃ¨re270\n\nAll of the infrastructure used by the R2 is shared with other services, except the section between BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport and El Prat de Llobregat stations, which is exclusively used by R2 Nord services. Between Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders and Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia stations, it shares tracks with Rodalies de Catalunya's regional rail lines R13, R14, R15 and R16, as well as a number of long-distance services to southern Spain, using the AragÃ³ Tunnel through central Barcelona.[11] R11 regional rail services commence their route at El Prat de Llobregat or Bellvitge stations, joining the route of the R2 and the other regional and long-distance services from these points on to Passeig de GrÃ cia.[12] After Passeig de GrÃ cia, R2 Sud trains, together with the R13, R14, R15 and R16, as well as long-distance services, branch off to Barcelona's EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a, terminating there. The rest of R2 services continue northwards through the AragÃ³ Tunnel, calling at El Clot-AragÃ³ railway station, and share tracks with the R11 only.[13] North of Mollet-Sant Fost railway station, Barcelona commuter rail service line R8 and several freight services join their route. The R8 terminates further north at Granollers Centre so that the R2 only shares tracks with the R11 and freight services from this point on.[14]\n\nOperation\n\nAll services running south of Castelldefels railway station, to the south of Barcelona, use EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a as their northern terminus, with Vilanova i la GeltrÃº or Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders stations serving as their southern terminus, in order from north to south. The services terminating at Vilanova i la GeltrÃº call at all stations along their route, whilst the ones terminating at Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders operate limited service, running non-stop between Sitges and Castelldefels, as well as GavÃ and Barcelona Sants. On the other hand, all services running north of Granollers Centre railway station, to the north of Barcelona, use the airport station as their southern terminus, with Sant Celoni or MaÃ§anet-Massanes stations serving as their northern terminus, in order from south to north, calling at all stations. Some of the services terminating at the airport also use Granollers Centre as their northern terminus. The rest of the services on the R2 run between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre, calling at all stations, so that they do not terminate neither at the airport nor at EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a. The first trains run about 5:00 in the morning, with the latest arriving at about 1:00 at night.[15]\n\nThe designation of the services on the line depends on the route they operate. All services terminating at the airport are designated R2 Nord (\"R2 North\"), whilst the services terminating at EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a are designated R2 Sud (\"R2 South\"). The Nord and Sud designations refer to the fact that such services mostly run on the line's northern and southern portion, respectively. The through services between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre are simply designated R2.[15]\n\nAs of August 2015, the service routes operating on the R2 are as follows:[15]\n\nLine Route No.\n\nof stations Journey time Days of\n\noperation Notes R2Castelldefels â Granollers Centre141:021 h 2 minMonâFri[lower-alpha 1]Calls at all stations along its route.

Some early morning and late night services call at all stations. In addition to the services mentioned above, which make up almost the entirety of the services running on the R2, the following services also operate on the line either in the early morning or at late night, calling at all stations (they are not listed in the table because they cannot be linked to a particular designationâR2, R2 Nord or R2 Sud):\n\nSant VicenÃ§ de Calders â Sant Celoni\n\nVilanova i la GeltrÃº â Granollers Centre\n\nVilanova i la GeltrÃº â MaÃ§anet-Massanes\n\nCastelldefels â Barcelona Sant Andreu Comtal\n\nCastelldefels â Barcelona EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a\n\nAirport â Barcelona EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a\n\nThe line's activity gathers on its southern section, between Vilanova i la GeltrÃº and Barcelona, where an approximate peak-time service frequency of 10 minutes is offered. All services on the line converge on the section between El Prat de Llobregat and Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia stations, where they together offer an approximate peak-time service frequency of 8 minutes. The overall service frequency reduces as the line moves away from Barcelona, especially on the section north of Sant Celoni, where R2 Nord services only operate during the morning rush hour or at night. During the rest of the day, this section is served by regional rail line R11.[12] Moreover, the services between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre only run on weekdays.\n\nAs of August 2015, the approximate service frequencies on the R2 are as follows:[15]\n\nSection Frequency RH OP WE Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders â Vilanova i la GeltrÃº30â²30â²30â² Vilanova i la GeltrÃº â Castelldefels10â²15â²15â² Castelldefels â El Prat de Llobregat10â²15â²15â² Airport â El Prat de Llobregat30â²30â²30â² El Prat de Llobregat â Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia8â²10â²10â² Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia â Barcelona EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a10â²15â²15â² Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia â Granollers Centre15â²15â²30â² Granollers Centre â Sant Celoni15â²30â²60â² Sant Celoni â MaÃ§anet-Massanes60â²ââ\n\nThe trains used on the R2 are Civiaâspecifically, the 463, 464 and 465 Series, which consist of three, four and five cars per set, respectively, 447 Series, 450 Series and 451 Series electrical multiple units (EMU).[1] The 450 and 451 Series are technically and aesthetically identical, differing only in the number of cars per set; the first consist of six cars, whilst the latter consist of three cars. Furthermore, they consist of double-decker cars, becoming the only type of bilevel rolling stock on the Rodalies de Catalunya system. The R2 is the only Rodalies de Catalunya line where 450 and 451 Series trains operate.[16] Normally, the 450 Series runs only on R2 Sud services between Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders and Barcelona's EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a, whilst the 451 Series runs only either on R2 Sud services between Vilanova i la GeltrÃº and EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a, or on R2 services between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre stations. Civia and 447 Series trains are used interchangeably on all R2, R2 Nord and R2 Sud services on the line.[9] On average, the trains used on the line operate a total of 216 services every day on weekdays, accounting for a ridership of 125,948, according to 2008 data.[1]\n\nFuture\n\nThe 2008â2015 Rail Infrastructure Master Plan for the Barcelona Commuter Rail Service, developed by the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport, plans to establish a \"coast-to-coast\" and \"inland-to-inland\" line scheme. According to this project, the current R2 will be extended southwards from Barcelona Sants to Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders stations, via Vilafranca del PenedÃ¨s, taking over the southern section of the present line R4. The R2 will become the \"inland-to-inland\" line, creating a new major southânorth axis through the inland regions of the Barcelona metropolitan area. R2 trains will continue to use the AragÃ³ Tunnel in central Barcelona with the new line scheme, which is currently not possible due to the configuration of the southern rail accesses to Barcelona Sants. A long-term project with an uncertain completion date, the new configuration would require multimillion-euro investments since it is associated with the construction of a new underground route in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat for the Rodalies de Catalunya lines running through the city as well as the new rail link for BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport.\n\nAs stated in the master plan, the proposed peak-time service frequencies for the future R2 would be as follows:\n\nSectiontph Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders â Martorell5 Martorell â Granollers Centre10 Granollers Centre â MaÃ§anet-Massanes5\n\nList of stations\n\nThe following table lists the name of each station served by line R2 in order from south to north; the station's service pattern offered by R2, R2 Nord and/or R2 Sud trains; the transfers to other Rodalies de Catalunya lines, including both commuter and regional rail services; remarkable transfers to other transport systems; the municipality in which each station is located; and the fare zone each station belongs to according to the Autoritat del Transport MetropolitÃ (ATM Ãrea de Barcelona) fare-integrated public transport system and Rodalies de Catalunya's own fare zone system for Barcelona commuter rail service lines.[20][21]\n\n# Terminal of a service * Transfer station to other transport systems #* Transfer station and terminal â Station served by all trains running through it â Limited service station\n\nStation Service Rodalies de Catalunya transfers Other transfers Municipality Fare zone R2 R2 Nord R2 Sud ATM AdB Rod Sant VicenÃ§ de Calders# âR4, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, RT2âEl Vendrell6A6 Calafell âR13, R14, R15âCalafell5A5 Segur de Calafell âR13, R14, R15âCalafell5A5 Cunit âR13, R14, R15âCunit5A5 Cubelles âR13, R14, R15âCubelles4A5 Vilanova i la GeltrÃº# âR13, R14, R15, R16, R17âVilanova i la GeltrÃº4A4 Sitges âR13, R14, R15âSitges3A4 Garraf âââSitges2A3 Platja de Castelldefels âââCastelldefels12 Castelldefels# ââR13, R14, R15âCastelldefels12 GavÃ ââR13, R14, R15âGavÃ 12 Viladecans ââR15âViladecans12 Airport#* ââBarcelonaâEl Prat Airport\n\nBarcelona Metro line 9 (L9 Sud)El Prat de Llobregat14 El Prat de Llobregat* âââR15Barcelona Metro line 9 (L9 Sud)El Prat de Llobregat11 Bellvitge* âââR15Barcelona Metro line 8, as well as Baix Llobregat Metro and other commuter rail services at Gornal stationL'Hospitalet de Llobregat11 Barcelona Sants* âââR1, R3, R4, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, RG1Renfe Operadora-operated high-speed and long-distance rail services\n\nTGV high-speed rail services\n\nBarcelona Metro lines 3 and 5 at Sants EstaciÃ³ station\n\nNational and international coach servicesBarcelona11 Barcelona Passeig de GrÃ cia* âââR11, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17Barcelona Metro lines 2, 3 and 4Barcelona11 Barcelona EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a#* âR13, R14, R15, R16, R17Renfe Operadora-operated long-distance rail services\n\nBarcelona Metro line 4 at Barceloneta stationBarcelona11 Barcelona El Clot-AragÃ³* ââR1, R11, RG1Barcelona Metro lines 1 and 2Barcelona11 Barcelona Sant Andreu Comtal* ââR11Barcelona Metro line 1 at Sant Andreu stationBarcelona11 Montcada i Reixac ââââMontcada i Reixac11 La Llagosta ââââLa Llagosta2D2 Mollet-Sant Fost ââR8âMollet del VallÃ¨s2D2 MontmelÃ³ ââR8âMontmelÃ³2D2 Granollers Centre# ââR8, R11âGranollers3D3 Les Franqueses-Granollers Nord âââLes Franqueses del VallÃ¨s3D3 Cardedeu âââCardedeu3D4 Llinars del VallÃ¨s âââLlinars del VallÃ¨s3D4 Palautordera âââSanta Maria de Palautordera4G5 Sant Celoni# âR11âSant Celoni4G5 Gualba âR11âGualba4G5 Riells i Viabrea-Breda âR11âRiells i Viabrea4G5 Hostalric âR11âHostalric5H6 MaÃ§anet-Massanes# âR1, R11, RG1âMaÃ§anet de la Selva6G6\n\nNotes\n\nThe services between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre do not run on 3â28 August.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nJuliÃ Sort, Jordi (October 2013).
