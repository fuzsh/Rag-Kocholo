        "text": "Final Destination: Cerbere and Port Bou\n\nThe railway line between Port Bou on the Spanish side of the border and CerbÃ©re on the French side of the border is one of the four international railway routes between Spain and France.\n\nThe daytime express trains from Spain to France now take the high speed line, but local and regional trains still travel this older route.\n\nDeparting from Barcelona:\n\nDeparting from Barcelona:\n\nDue to construction work on the railway to the north of Barcelona - work has recommenced on the construction of Barcelona Sagrera station; until further notice these trains are commencing their journeys at Barcelona Sant Andreu Comtal station - which is located to the north of the city centre.\n\nThis station is served by local Rodalies trains on lines R2 and R2 Nord, which call at Barcelona Sants station and Passeig de GrÃ cia station**](https://goo.gl/maps/Janmqd9AqgXamQAV8), which is much closer to the heart of Barcelona than Sants station.\n\nFour to six of these trains per hour are typically available, they will typically be heading to Granollers Centre or Macanet - Massane\n\nTickets for this journey aren't sold online, so book them at the station in Barcelona, you'll need to use the Media-Distancia ticket desks.\n\nRail Pass Users:\n\nTake these trains and connect in Port Bou and not only will you avoid the reservation fees charged on the RENFE-SNCF trains (2nd class pass users will save at least â¬15 and 1st class pass users will save at least â¬20) - you'll also have a more scenic journey!"
