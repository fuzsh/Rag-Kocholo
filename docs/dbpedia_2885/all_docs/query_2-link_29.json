        "text": "Trains reach all corners of France – taking your bike on French trains need not be a hassle if you do a little research prior to departure and know which trains allow bikes (and which don't).\n\nThe French train network is generally very good if you're travelling by bike – especially once you understand it and know how to make the most of it.\n\nFrench trains reach all corners of the country, and different types of trains offer different services – from fast point-to-point routes to slower local journeys that can help you link to bike routes or avoid cycling in poor weather.\n\nWe try and explain them on this page, along with\n\nA quick note on buying tickets: If you are taking a longer journey that involves multiple changes (or more than one of the train types listed below), you should search individual legs separately on the SNCF website. This is because the online booking system cannot cope with multiple journeys by bike and will tell you it's not possible to take your bike on a route when in fact it is. You therefore need to break the journey down into smaller chunks using the map below, search leg-by-leg and buy each ticket separately.\n\nTaking bikes on local TER trains in France\n\nSee the TGV section below for what TER trains to take on major/fast routes when TGVs will not take fully assembled bikes.\n\nYou can get pretty much anywhere in France on a local TER train – it just sometimes takes time and multiple changes.\n\nWhat are TER trains?: TERs are local trains. They stop at most stations, including the smaller towns and villages that TGVs and Intercites bypass. Very, very small villages/stations may receive every second or third TER train rather than every train on the timetable, but they are nonetheless still serviced.\n\nTER trains are great for linking bike routes, taking shortcuts if you’re pressed for time, to avoid bad weather or if your legs just need a break.\n\nOther names for TERS:\n\nIn and around Paris, TER-equivalent trains are called Transilien and RER trains. In Normandy, TERs are called NOMADs. In Grand-Est (Calais, Somme, etc), they are called something entirely different (see this page for more information and an explanation).\n\nTeoz trains are also similar to TERs and run on medium-distance routes from Paris to Auvergne, and also link cities across south and central France, such as Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulouse, Caen, Reims and Paris.\n\nBuying TER tickets: Tickets can be bought at stations prior to departure, although they can also be booked ahead on any of the regional TER websites – just Google the region name + \"TER\". Each route will have a little bicycle sign to show if the train takes bikes (all TERs should). TER tickets can also be brought via SNCF or via Trainline, but these options tend to prioritise the fastest route rather than showing you all options.\n\nWhen searching for TERs: It can help to add in a smaller station midway on the journey using the 'via' button as this will cut out fast/TGV options and leave you only with TERs. There is no need to tick the bicycle box if searching for TERs - with a few exceptions such as Brittany, most TERs do not require bicycle bookings so the bike sign won't always show up on SNCF or Trainline searches – another reason why if you know you want to go by local TER, it's easier to just use a local TER website.\n\nTaking bikes on TERs: Bikes can be carried free of charge on most TER trains but there are some exceptions – see below. If bike reservations are NOT required, you simply walk your bike on after having bought your own ticket. You can usually use TERs with your bike even if the official SNCF website does not have the little bike symbol when you search. Just search for your own ticket without using the velo search function. As stated above, it can help to add in a smaller station midway on the journey using the 'via' button as this will cut out fast/TGV options and leave you only with TERs. As also stated above, if you know you want to take a TER (and avoid fast trains/TGVs that don't take bikes), then just use a TER website for searches.\n\nBikes can usually be taken on TERs with a regular ticket and without a separate bike booking/ticket, but there are a few exceptions ...\n\nPays de la Loire: This region covers the area south of Brittany (Saint-Nazaire area), east towards Saumur and south into the Vendée. All TER trains take bikes but it is necessary to make bike reservations in summer. See this page for full details.\n\nFrench Alps (Grenoble, Valence, Lyon etc): Bikes can be taken on local TER trains but some lines do require bike reservations at some times of year. See this page.\n\nBurgundy: Some TER lines require free bike reservations – see here for more information.\n\nGrand-Est region:\n\n- The TER network in this region is called \"TER Fluo\". Trains don't take bikes between Strasbourg, Mulhouse and Basel Monday to Friday during peak hours 6am-8.30am and 4pm-6.30pm.\n\n- TERs on the Paris-Troyes-Mulhouse line and the Paris-Châlons en Champagne-Strasbourg line require bicycle reservations. €3 per bike and you need to buy these in advance online or at the ticket office.\n\nHauts-de-France region (Calais region): See this page for exceptions.\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine (Bordeaux region): Some TER trains require bike reservations during summer. See this page.\n\nProvence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur: TER trains don't take bicycles Monday-Friday 7am-9am and 4.30pm-6.30pm.\n\nIle-de-France (Paris): Transilien and RER trains (TERs) don't take bicycles Monday-Friday 6.30am-9am and 4.30pm-7pm. See here for tickets, but it's probably just as easy to buy them on the day. See here for more on bikes-trains in Paris.\n\nBrittany: Bikes need to be booked (free of charge) on TERs during high season (usually the start of June to the start of September). Bikes can be booked when you buy your regular tickets from the local TER website from the start of May. See here for more on using trains with bikes in Brittany.\n\nBurgundy:\n\n- Paris-Dijon-Macon (Lyon) line requires (free) bike reservations during some peak periods. If using this line, it's best to book a spot in advance from the local TER website. It should issue you with a special velo ticket/coupon in addition to your regular ticket. The reservation is free but mandatory. See here for more on bikes-trains in Burgundy.\n\n- Paris-Morvan requires (free) bike reservations during some peak periods. If using this line, it's best to book a spot in advance from the local TER website. It should issue you with a special velo ticket/coupon in addition to your regular ticket. The reservation is free but mandatory. See this page for more info.\n\nNormandy: TER trains in Normandy are part of the NOMAD transport system (essentially a NOMAD train = TER train). Bikes can travel on nearly all local TER trains but reservations are compulsory on some lines in summer (usually from July 1) when the number of places on each train for bikes is more limited. See here for full details.\n\nSee the TGV section below for what TER trains to take on major routes when TGVs will not take fully assembled bikes.\n\nRegion-by-region pages with additional information:\n\nFrench Alps train map\n\nBurgundy train map (Beaune, Dijon, etc)\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine train map (Bordeaux, Dordogne, Biarritz, Limoges etc)\n\nPays de la Loire train map (Nantes, Angers, etc)\n\nBrittany train map (Rennes, Roscoff, etc)\n\nParis Metro and RER train map\n\nOccitanie train map (Pyrenees, Canal du Midi, Montpellier, etc)\n\nNormandy train map (D-Day Beaches, Mont St-Michel, Dieppe, Caen, etc)\n\nProvence bike map (Ventoux, vineyards, ViaRhona, etc)\n\nCalais, Dunkirk and Somme (Hauts-de-France region)\n\nGrand-Est region map and info (Alsace, Champagne and Lorraine)\n\nThe bike carriage area on TERs will look something like this and be marked with 'velo' or a bicycle logo on the door. Storage depends on the train mode (bikes will either hang or be stored in an area marked for bikes in the carriage proper).\n\nFast trains: TGV and Intercités\n\nNote: TER local trains are not shown on the map below but they generally go wherever the faster trains (TGVs and Intercites) go, albeit with many more smaller/local stops than shown on the map.\n\nClick map or here for a downloadable PDF of the map.\n\nClick here or on the map for a larger jpeg you can download.\n\nThe high-speed and long-distance network – with the excellent TGV and Intercités at the fore – links major city/town centres. The TGV links Paris to Lyon and Paris to Bordeaux in just two hours, and Marseille or Grenoble to Paris in around three hours.\n\nTaking bikes on TGV trains\n\nWhat are TGVs?: TGVs are very high-speed intercity trains that only stop at major towns and cities. They often travel between major cities non-stop or with very few stops. They are the fastest way to travel. Trains have buffet cars with food and drinks. There are also 'OuiGo' TGVs that run on high-speed lines offering discounted tickets.\n\nBuying TGV tickets: TGV tickets can be booked at SNCF or at any station or SNCF ticket office. You can also use the Trainline booking service from anywhere in the world. Your ticket should be marked 'velo' (or similar) and you will have been allocated a specific seat with a bit storage area nearby.\n\nBagged or boxed bikes on TGVs: Bikes can travel free of charge on all TGVs if they are bagged or boxed. You simply place your bagged/boxed bike in the luggage area as you would a suitcase. The size limit for bagged/boxed bikes is 120cm x 90cm but I've never heard of anyone's bag being measured or anyone being stopped for an oversized bag.\n\nFully assembled bikes on TGVs: Some lines do take fully assembled bikes and some don't. You need to check OUI.sncf to confirm (our list below may be subject to change but will provide a general guide to problematic lines).\n\nIf your TGV DOES take fully assembled bikes, your bike MUST be booked in when you reserve your seat. If you do not book your bike in when you buy your own ticket it may not be possible to add the bike on to the reservation later. For this reason, it is very important that you check if your TGV takes bikes before buying any tickets. You can do this on the OUI.sncf website or via Trainline.\n\nHere is a summary of which TGV lines DO AND DO NOT take fully assembled bicycles and some suggested workarounds ...\n\nFor the suggestions below, if you need to take multiple trains to avoid TGV-unfriendly lines, you need to research and book individual legs separately on SNCF website, or use local TER equivalent website. The main SNCF system cannot handle multiple changes/stations with a bicycle. Buy each leg individually. Search WITHOUT ticking travel with a velo option.\n\nParis to Toulouse: This is possible by TGV with a bike from Paris Gare d'Austerlitz to Toulouse. You need to make a bike reservation for Paris-Toulouse at the same time you buy your own ticket. The bike symbol should come up on relevant services on a regular search for tickets on the SNCF website.\n\nToulouse to Carcassonne, Montpellier, Avignon, Marseille, Perpignan, etc: TER trains run on these lines and you can wheel your bike on – see here for times and reservations. An Intercites train (bike reservations needed) also links Marseille St Charles station directly with Toulouse. Marseille/Montpellier-Toulouse Intercites train also takes fully assembled bikes (bike reservation needed; usually only a few a day). From Avignon, it's usually necessary to go via Marseille or Nimes-Montpellier and then on to Toulouse. Train map here.\n\nParis-Rennes-Nantes: TGVs take fully assembled bikes. Book your TGV tickets and your bike in advance. You can also take TER trains on this route.\n\nSee our Pays de la Loire (Nantes) train map.\n\nSee our Brittany train info.\n\nParis Montparnasse-Bordeaux: TGVs take bikes. Book your TGV tickets and your bike in advance (at the same time when buying your own ticket). Once in Bordeaux, local TERs and most Intercites trains also take bikes (though reservations may be required). See the Nouvelle-Aquitaine/Bordeaux train info and map here.\n\nParis-La Rochelle: There is a TGV that takes bikes. Book your TGV tickets and your bike in advance (at the same time when buying your own ticket). You can also go via Bordeaux (see above) and then up to La Rochelle on a TER or Intervites train. You can also go Paris-Rennes-Nantes and then down the coast to La Rochelle on local trains.\n\nLa Rochelle train map here.\n\nParis-Limoges: Intercites trains take bikes (book your ticket and your bike in advance).\n\nTrain map here.\n\nParis-Perigueux: Go via Bordeaux (see above) or Limoges (see above) and then use local connections.\n\nTrain map here.\n\nBordeaux-Tarbes/Pau (for the Pyrenees): You need to take an Intercites from Bordeaux to Toulouse and then another Intercites train or a local TER train from Toulouse-Tarbes/Pau (bike reservations needed on Intercites).\n\nBordeaux train map here.\n\nFor Pyrenees, go here.\n\nBetween Saint-Nazaire, Nantes, Rennes, Morlaix and Roscoff, you need to take local TERs trains. Search and book individual legs separately as online systems generally cannot handle so many changes. When searching for TERs it can help to add in a smaller station midway on the journey using the 'via' button as this will cut out fast/TGV options and leave you only with TERs.\n\nSee here for Brittany train info.\n\nHere for Pays de la Loire (Nantes)\n\nNormandy: No problem with your bike - see here.\n\nParis-Lyon TGV: Takes fully assembled bikes, but you need to reserve a space in advance. On this line, you can also get the local TER regional service between Paris Bercy station and Lyon Part Dieu. You may need a reservation on this TER service if the train has come from Dijon (see this page for booking links).\n\nParis-Avignon TGV / Paris-Nice TGV: Do not take fully assembled bikes. There is one overnight Intercites train a day from Nice to Paris Austerlitz (and one from Paris Austerlitz to Nice) that takes fully assembled bikes, but these spaces are notoriously hard to find/book – book as far ahead as possible. Seats need to be reserved one at a time so it's a good option for solo riders and couples, but less so for groups of 3 or 4 people who may have trouble finding spots on the same train.\n\nYou can also use a combination of local trains to get to/from Provence from Paris. For example, go from Paris Bercy station to Lyon Part Dieu and then on to Avignon/Marseilles/Nice - all on local regional TER services, but you do need to break these journeys up and search them individually. You could also take the TGV Paris-Toulouse and head east from there on regional trains. Alternatively, you could take a combination of TER and Intercites trains from Paris to Clermont-Ferrand and then south on local services – all with a fully assembled bike.\n\nAs per the guidance above, if using the SNCF site, you need to search these legs separately as the SNCF booking system cannot handle multiple changes, so search 'Paris to Lyon' and then buy tickets separately for 'Lyon to Avignon' and 'Avignon to Nice' for example).\n\ntrains take bikes but only in second class and spaces are limited. You should book as far ahead as you can. The TGV INOUIs go from the Paris Est station to Strasbourg in 1hr 45 to 2 hours. You need to book the bike space at the time of buying your ticket by adding the bike option on the SNCF website. If you can't find a bike space on your chosen day, you can also go by local TER train but this takes 4h 45min to 5 hours – you can also see these trains and book on the SNCF website. If you choose to go via TER, it can help to break the journey down into stages to check tickets – this way you eliminate the TGVs from the search. Try the following (or in reverse if travelling from Strasbourg to Paris): Paris-Dole and then Dole-Strasbourg. Or Paris-Troyes-Mulhouse and then Strasbourg. See also this page for a map and local guidance.\n\nColmar to Paris: Try Colmar-Mulhouse-Belfort-Paris or Colmar-Strasbourg-Paris (or in reverse if going to Colmar). From Colmar you can also go Mulhouse-Belfort-Paris. These are all local TER services that take bikes. Again, it may be easier to research and book individual legs separately as online systems can't always handle so many changes. See also this page for a map and local advice.\n\nBurgundy: The TGV and Lyria trains from Paris do not take fully assembled bikes. You need to take a TER from Paris Bercy to somewhere like Dijon and access the local Burgundy TER trains from there. For Besançon, also go via Dijon. You could also go from Paris to Lyon on a TER or TGV and then take local TER trains north into Burgundy from there. We have a map of the full Burgundy TER network and more information here. Major Burgundy canal and wine route places like Beaune, Macon and Chalon are all linked by TER train. You can also link to Nevers by local TER for the Loire bike route EuroVelo 6.\n\nThe bike storage on TGVs varies depending on model but usually looks something like the photos below if the train takes fully assembled bikes. You usually take your bike on board, up a few steps and into a separate cabin with room for two bikes. You strap your bike in with the 'seatbelt' provided. If you have panniers, it's easiest to take them off before boarding, take your bike on and return to the platform for the panniers (the train will not go without you!)\n\nTaking bikes on Intercités trains\n\nWhat are Intercites trains?: Intercities are a step down from TGVs. They are a little slower and they stop at more stations than TGVs. They usually stop at all major town and cities, though they will not stop at smaller towns and villages (you need a TER - see above - for those).\n\nHere is a map of Intercites destinations - click image or here for a downloadable PDF.\n\nClick map to enlarge map of Intercites lines or download it here.\n\nBuying Intercites train tickets: Tickets can be booked online at SNCF or at any station or SNCF ticket office. You can also use the Trainline booking service from anywhere in the world.\n\nBagged or boxed bikes on Intercites trains: Bikes can travel free of charge on all Intercités trains if they are bagged or boxed. You simply place your bagged/boxed bike in the luggage area as you would a suitcase. The size limit for bagged/boxed bikes is 120cm x 90cm but I've never heard of anyone's bag being measured.\n\nFully assembled bikes on Intercites trains: If an Intercites train takes fully assembled bikes, a little bike symbol will appear when you do a regular ticket search on SNCF. Intercites trains require reservations for bikes. A surcharge of €5-10 usually applies for bikes. There are usually bike spaces for between 12 and 20 bikes on Intercités trains, though this can vary depending on the train length. Train carriages with bike storage have a bike logo or are marked 'velo'. Arrive on the platform early and ask a staff member where on the platform the bike carriages will stop so that you are positioned well to get your bikes and panniers etc on. (During busy times people sometimes put luggage in the bike areas, so it's good to get in first).\n\nIntercité night trains\n\nNight trains reservations are needed for both you and your bike. There is usually a separate carriage/space for bikes. As above for reservation info and links.\n\nParis Austerlitz – Briançon\n\nParis Austerlitz - La Tour de Carol - Luchon – Cerbère\n\nParis Austerlitz - Toulouse / Rodez - Carmaux – Albi\n\nParis Austerlitz - Hendaye (Irun) / Tarbes\n\nParis Austerlitz – Savoie\n\nParis Austerlitz – Nice\n\nHendaye - Bordeaux – Nice\n\nHendaye (Irun) – Genève\n\nLuxembourg - Nice / Port-Bou\n\nStrasbourg - Nice / Port-Bou\n\nThe bike storage area on regular Intercites varies depending on the model of the train, but may look something like this (make sure you board early on busy trains to beat the luggage trap):\n\nAvoiding problems with bikes on trains\n\nThe Fédération française des Usagers de la Bicyclette (FUB, the French bicycle users' association) advises taking a copy of the train operator's cycle carriage policy with you, but I have never found this necessary. I have never had a bike-train problem in France when I've had a ticket. Even so, FUB have this advice (it may or may not be useful, depending on your level of French):\n\n“If you get on a train that accepts cycles, and the inspector says no and wants to put you off:\n\n* keep the document (original or a copy) showing that cycles are allowed on that train;\n\n* keep calm and polite, it makes things easier. Tell the inspector where you got your information. The inspector should not forbid you to get on board (if) the train has no cycle space or luggage van (when) it should have;\n\n* if you are unconvinced, but he insists, you can always obey, get off the train, and (shh!) get on again at the other end. Or you can ask him to write out the fine, and get it cancelled later if you are within your rights. It’s a bit chancy. Inspectors have been known to delay a train to throw cyclists off, even from trains allowed to have cycles!”\n\nTandems, trailers and other bikes\n\nTandems, trailers and other 'non-standard' bikes are not permitted on TGVs or Intercites services. They are also generally banned from TERs, however we have received dozens of reports from cyclists who have used local TER services with no problems. Arrive early, be courteous and avoid peak-hour travel. Also be prepared to wait for the next service if you do happen across a conductor who won't let you on. It also may help to collapse trailers etc to make your load look as small as possible.\n\nBus replacement services\n\nOccasionally when there is track work or on lines where buses have replaced redundant train lines, SNCF runs buses (marked as 'autocars' or sometimes just 'cars' on timetables). We have used these a number of times over the years and have never had any problems with the driver storing our bikes under the bus in the luggage area. Indeed most regional services include bikes in their carriage policies. Be courteous, remove all luggage, and be prepared to wait for the next bus if the service is particularly busy.\n\nWe have a separate article here on dedicated bus services. See also the budget Flixbus service.\n\nShipping your bike instead of taking it on the train\n\nSee here or try our bespoke shipping service.\n\nMore on bikes and French trains\n\nHow-to guide for taking the Eurostar with a bike\n\nCatching trains to France from abroad\n\nThe special Loire bike train\n\nUPDATE: Note that some of the comments below may be out of date when discussing booking bikes on trains.
