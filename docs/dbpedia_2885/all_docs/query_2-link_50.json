I would be curious to know if anyone else recently taken the train from BCN to Sants. Hopefully 4+ hours is enough time to collect baggage, & navigate our way over to the other terminal. I am also wondering if I can get away purchasing the Sants train tickets upon arrival. Thanks in advance, -Rick"
