It is intended to serve as the central station for northern and eastern Barcelona, with Sants serving as the central station for southern and western Barcelona.

It will also be on the conventional Barcelona–Cerbère and Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railways. Once fully completed, it will be a major public transport hub, with dedicated stations on Barcelona Metro lines 4 and 9/10, as well as a bus station. The complex will be fully underground excepting for the station building, with two levels of platforms, accounting for a total of 18 railway tracks.",

        "text": "Not to be confused with La Sagrera-Meridiana station.\n\nSagrera railway station (Catalan: Estació de la Sagrera, Spanish: Estación de la Sagrera) is a major through station under construction in the Barcelona districts of Sant Andreu and Sant Martí, in Catalonia, Spain. It is intended to serve as the central station for northern and eastern Barcelona, with Sants serving as the central station for southern and western Barcelona. Together with El Prat de Llobregat and Sants, currently the only high-speed rail stations in the Barcelona area, it will be on the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line.

Once fully completed, it will be a major public transport hub, with dedicated stations on Barcelona Metro lines 4 and 9/10, as well as a bus station.[1] The complex will be fully underground excepting for the station building, with two levels of platforms, accounting for a total of 18 railway tracks.\n\nQuick Facts Barcelona Sagrera, General information ...\n\nClose\n\nThe new station is part of a larger urban redevelopment project along the corridor formed by the railways accessing Barcelona from the north-east, which divides the districts of Sant Andreu and Sant Martí. This project includes the rebuilding of Sant Andreu Comtal railway station, to the north of Sagrera, and the construction of a 3.7-kilometre-long (2.3 mi) linear artificial park over the railways running on the corridor, which will be put underground.[3] At an estimated cost of €2 billion,[4] the project is funded and managed by Barcelona Sagrera Alta Velocitat (BSAV), a public partnership made up of the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Government of Catalonia and the Barcelona City Council.[5]"
