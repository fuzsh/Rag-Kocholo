        "text": "I am awaiting the answer too - because I would like to visit Caduques and some years ago when I did the research it was not easy - so I didnt go (I was in Barcelona at the time and the bus connection was dicey) - I would be coming from France in this instance, so I guess you have figured out how to get to the train - I think you have a problem there, since after all you are changing countries - There would be no reason to have an airport shuttle crossing national lines! I will see what others say, but you just might have to spend the night in Perpignan....\n\nThank you, pfsmalo! Yes, to go to Perpignan the day before is our \"plan B\". Another option is to rent a car at the airport, which we would like to do in order to see as many places as possible, and maybe travel along the coast (if there are nice country roads there), and to have a convienient transport back to the airport as well. The only concern right now is how to use a French reg. car hire in Spain, because it'll be my first trip there, and the AA published a warning: \"Motorists should be aware of contrived incidents. Foreign registered vehicles, especially those towing caravans, and hire cars are often targeted in service areas or tricked in to stopping on the hard shoulder by the occupant of a passing vehicle. They will gesture that something is wrong with the vehicle. Lock all doors and keep bags out of sight. The number of thefts by bogus policemen has increased in Madrid and Catalonia.\" [original link]\n\nI don't know how serious all that info or real situation is, but I'll travel with a child on board... Oh, by the way, what is that new French law when motorists must keep a breathalyser in their cars, does the same apply in Spain, please?\n\nThank you for taking your time to reply!\n\nFor crossing into another country you would have to ask the renter about that, one may let you with of course a bump in the premium, but that'll probably still work out cheaper than paying a drop-off fee.\n\nI think the number of thefts etc etc is exagerated. I have family that live in Ceret, close to Perpignan and they go down to the market at Figueras every two weeks, never been a problem. Even stop off at the cheap \"eat to your fill\" restos on the road.\n\nIn France the breathalyser in the car thing has been dropped, no need for it. Pretty sure it doesn't in Spain either. Remember that in Spain you must have the high-viz jackets too (in the habitacle) and you are supposed to have 2 (two) warning triangles (France 1)\n\nThe jackets and warning triangles do come with the cars we've rented but I would be sure to check. Sometimes people take them out of their rental cars and the service folks forget to check.\n\nThe drive up the coast to Perpignan is stunning if you stay along the coast. We've crossed the border a few times but always get and return the car in France so don't know the costs involved in renting in Spain and dropping in France.\n\nIf we had an early flight, I'd spend the night before in Perpignan. It's just one less thing to worry about . . . and Perpignan is a really fun city to visit.\n\nEnjoy your trip.\n\nThak you, pfsmalo for providing info on breathalyser. I read that the lack of them for sale in some places stoped the police to issue a penalty of 11 â‚¬ on spot - good news for me, as I don't need to search the ones with FN symbol (approved in France). As to the hi-viz jackets and the triangle, I can take it with me both, but if the jacket is light and takes no space in the hand luggage, I cannot say the same about my portable, but heavy triangle.\n\nIf the French law says two triangles in the car, should I expect to see them in the French rent car?\n\nFrench law only requires one triangle and you will need two if you drive in Spain. I'd ask the rental company to provide them. If they allow (and insure) you to drive in Spain, they should provide two triangles. Be sure to keep the jackets in the car proper, not the luggage carrier that I think you call the boot. That is also French law.\n\nWe rent in France, drive in France and Spain and return in France and have had no problems. It gives us great freedom to get off the beaten path. The roads up the coast are just stunning and it would be a shame to miss them. The little villages inland are also wonderful. Then turn in the rental car in Perpignan on your last night and enjoy the city and some of Roadquill's breathalyzer juice.\n\nWhatever you decide, have a wonderful trip.\n\nWell, if Beausoleil says that renting in France and traveling in Spain with the rental car is not a problem, then I would strongly suggest you rent a car for the freedom it will give you to explore - especially with a child. That would avoid the getting to the airport early problem, although you can find a modest hotel in Perpignan, a deux etoiles for instance, at 50 or 60 euros, for the night, that surely wont break your budget. There is much to see around Perpignan too. By the way, could you please share with me your information on the bus schedules from Figueras? Do they go on to Caduques? I dont drive so I dont have that option. I can recommend Girona, the center is really lovely, and of course Barcelona is....well...Barcelona....And on both the French and Spanish side there are picturesque villages in the Pyrenees with old Romanesque churches, etc. So all that is available with a car....\n\nMust admit, we always book the car ahead. Not only is it cheaper, you can get what you want or need. You will need to have the two triangles, vests and child seat and should be sure you have insurance that covers driving in Spain . . . and that you are allowed to take the car into Spain. This can be done on the spot, but it may limit you and it's much easier done ahead of time. The companies we've used the most are Kemwel and AutoEurope. Here are their web sites. I'd suggest you check as many web sites as you can and take the best deal.\n\n[original link]\n\n[original link]\n\nWe have also used Sixt but not for years and years. Here's their web site for you to check.\n\n[original link]\n\nFriends have used Novacarhire and been happy with them but we've not used them. You can also check them. [original link]\n\nAll the major rental agencies will probably be in the Perpignan area and you can check the Perpignan Airport web site for their rental agencies to check directly. Here's the car rental in English for the airport. [original link]\n\nIf you take the N260 from Figueres over to Llanca and continue north, the drive is spectacular along the coast. In France the N260 becomes the D914. About 30 km south of Perpignan on the way is the lovely coastal village of Collioure. That would be a must-see. It is just beautiful and if you can manage a mealtime there, you can eat right on the shore with a historic church on one side of the bay and a historic chateau on the other side of the bay. It's just beautiful and worth the short detour from the D914.\n\nHave a great trip.\n\nWow! Beausoleil, thank you so much! I copy almost all the info you kindly share with people here, and I have created a file to use during the holiday. I need to digest a lot of information, and I would also like to prepare a plan what to do, visit, etc., during our stay. I think, two plans, actually, the first - we travel by a car, and the second - the public transport is our main transportation.\n\nWhen I use [original link] and quote the car less than seven days ago, the best one came with an offer of 185GBP (Alamo, Perpignan airport, second driver incl.), the picture now is not so bright - it's topping 210-260 pounds for economy 2door car... By the way, for some reason they stated that \"The driver will be held responsible if no breathalyzer can be provided when asked for by the police authorities\".\n\nAnyway, thank you once again, and I hope everything will be just allright!"
