The station serves as the northern terminus of Barcelona commuter rail service lines R1 and R2 Nord as well as a stop for all trains on regional line R11. On 24 March 2014 ( ), Girona commuter rail service line RG1 also started services, providing a direct connection between the Maresme and the Girona areas without having to interchange at this station.[9]

Under the name "Riera de Santa Coloma", the station was first opened on 27 August 1860 ( ) with the construction of the Barcelona–Portbou Railway on its section from Granollers to this location, which was carried out by Compañía del Camino de Hierro del Norte ("Northern Railway Company"). One year later, on 1 August 1861 ( ), Camino de Hierro del Este ("Eastern Railway") opened the extension of the Barcelona–Mataró Railway from Arenys de Mar to the already existing station, leading to the connection of both railways.[10]
