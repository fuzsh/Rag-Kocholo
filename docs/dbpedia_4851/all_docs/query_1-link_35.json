        "text": "A weekly newsletter on campaigning, lobbying and political influence in the U.K.\n\nBy JOHN JOHNSTON\n\nHello and welcome to London Influence. Recess means more time to read transparency spreadsheets, right? Tips, gossip, state secrets and coffee requests @johnjohnstonmi or [email protected] | View in your browser\n\nRULES SHAKE UP IMMINENT? Whitehall’s lobbying transparency regime is set for a major tightening up according to a just-landed report in the Guardian. The paper’s Aubrey Allegretti reports that approaches to ministers by phone calls, virtual meetings, personal emails, texts and WhatsApps will all have to be disclosed under plans to be unveiled “later this week” … a classic taking out the trash move if ever there was one.\n\nMana for Influence: Citing “sources,” the paper reports that a broader range of senior civil servants, including commercial and finance directors, will also now be bound by the rules with departments told they should “aim” to replace the quarterly transparency publications with monthly disclosures. It comes two years after the Greensill scandal prompted an official review to call for major changes.\n\nSNEAK PEEK\n\n— Is this summer’s hottest trend … sitting in the office doing work?\n\n— Government (finally) promises (kinda) tougher ethics rules (at some stage).\n\n— Portland launches a joint team to prepare for 2024’s THREE elections.\n\nLOBBYING WESTMINSTER\n\nSUMMER DAZE: MPs are packing their suitcases and TV news producers are prepping their stories about surfing dogs. It can only mean one thing … it’s recess.\n\nSorry: But Influence is here to ruin your plans for a lazy summer by asking industry pros whether lobbying in recess is still a worthwhile endeavour.\n\nHell yes: That’s the conclusion from Craig Beaumont, chief of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses, who says an empty order paper is no reason to rest.\n\nConsultation nation: “Firstly, officials are wily — on Monday as you casually scan the horizon in the wake of the by-election news, you’ll squint and see there are some hefty piles of documents in the distance — these are the reams of consultations issued just as officials are packing up for summer holidays,” he says.\n\nForward planning: Beaumont points out that these are often set with response dates … for the end of summer so that officials have them ready for their return.\n\nHe adds: “This is great for their diarized summer holidays with an umbrella cocktail by the pool; it’s less great for your policy teams who’ll need to spread them across the team to work out the approach to drafting submissions.”\n\nDoing a (civil) service: Grayling director Christine Quigley agrees that summer can be a great change to grab some time with officials to talk through the more wonk-ish aspect of policy and get the inside track on a department’s priorities — without the minister breathing down their necks.\n\nBlue sky thinking: Just because MPs are not in Westminster doesn’t mean they aren’t working, of course. And the clever operator can still get valuable face time.\n\nThink local: The best pitches are those that work for ministers spending at least some of their time trying to show face in their constituency (at least during the bits where they are not in a donor’s Tuscany villa.) So, if you can craft an event that fits their brief and is on their doorstep you may be onto a winner.\n\nNot-so-radio-silent: Watch out for ministers popping up on telly to wax lyrical too. Beaumont says the government’s claim that it doesn’t put reps on broadcast for the sake of it should come with a “pinch of salt for your piña colada rim.” If news happens, they’ll still be expected to speak.\n\nNew blood: Combine the swathe of resigning MPs with current polls and the next election is likely to deliver lots of new faces to the green benches. Elizabeth Ames, COO of agency Atalanta, spies a golden summer opportunity to build relationships.\n\nShe says: “A quiet drink in the sunshine can be a very useful way to build the kinds of strong connections that actually help drive things forward on key areas when things pick up again.”\n\nDog days: “Use the occasional warm day to think outside the box on ways to catch up,” she adds. “I have been known to encourage contacts to join me for a walk with Atalanta’s Chief Canine Officer, Walter — a nice way to remember there is a world outside of the office and get your steps up.”\n\nSilly season: Recess can also be prime time for pitching story ideas to journalists desperately scrambling around for a scoop during the news drought (as if!).\n\nCase in point: Beaumont said he managed to get a breakthrough last summer after months of pitching the impact of energy prices on small businesses in vain.\n\nHe said: “One journalist finally realised a human story with us in August and it finally exploded — and Liz Truss made a commitment in her election that later led to the Energy Relief Scheme that saved thousands of small firms … that otherwise would have gone under.”\n\nBut but but: They all agree that putting some time aside to nail down your party conference planning is a smart play — especially given this year’s jamborees are going to be high-stakes events.\n\nParty planners: “This party conference season is likely to be the most critical in a decade, with a significant possibility that they will be the last before a change of government,” Quigley said. “While public affairs pros will of course have been planning since January … the summer is a great time to book in meetings and finalize plans before the whirlwind September sitting.”\n\nAll work and no play: One final thing. Time away is crucial to being prepped for the manic months ahead — and stubbornly working through is only going to leave you with an empty inbox weird pallor.\n\nBeaumont says the summer grafters “don’t look as good as those who caught some summer sun, turned off work notifications and came back ready to get stuck in with better mental health, a bit of a tan and a smile to face the autumn.”\n\nQUICK HITS\n\nFINGER ON THE PULSE: Our bid to get Labour to chat for last week’s story about shadow ministers tapping up private donors to secure staffing budgets was met with stony silence from the party — little surprise given the latest register of interests shows there’s no sign of the practice slowing down.\n\nCooper’s coppers: Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper added three new staff to her team — funded for the next 18 months — thanks to a £210,000 donation from business tycoon Gary Lubner.\n\nMiliband’s moolah: And the shadow climate change supremo Ed Miliband secured a whopping £233,000 — to be paid in instalments over the next 12 months — via philanthropist Lisbet Rausing.\n\nTECH TIMES: My colleague Tom Bristow on the POLITICO U.K. tech team has interviewed venture capitalist and former diplomat Priya Guha, who is chairing a new ‘digital revolution’ group at the British Chambers of Commerce.\n\nKey tasks: Guha said the group would produce three areas of focus and then come up with “granular” policy details for government. She said: “We are not seeing this as lobbying. This is trying to frame a conversation.”\n\nAcronym wars: Pressed on their new CBI-style business council and whether they were try to muscle in on their turf, she said: “It is really important businesses get heard”. And while a BCC spokesperson denied they were trying to take over the CBI’s work, they said their problems meant firms “don’t have that voice in the way they used to.”\n\nSOZ MOZ: The Conservatives have chosen Susan Hall as their candidate for the London Mayoral race — beating out criminal barrister Mozammel Hossain.\n\nBad luck: To Moz’s supporters — especially the clutch of fellow legal eagles who had donated a whopping £140,000 to support his campaign in the week’s leading up to his defeat.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY: Women in Public Affairs launched a survey to get views from women and allies in the sector on what you’d like to see the group campaign on in the coming year. Give ’em your views here.\n\nTALKING SHOP\n\nOH GOD: With a Westminster election steaming down the tracks it might be easy to forget that both the U.S. and EU are … also preparing to hold their own polls. That makes 2024 an unprecedented year of election chaos. Yay!\n\nMaking sense of it all: Enter Beyond the Ballot — a new joint division from political consultancy Portland and consumer outfit Ketchum. The team sat down with Influence to explain their plans.\n\nThe pitch: The shops reckon organizations will need support to keep across three votes with major policy implications. And social and cultural debates will continue to bubble up from new sources — like TikTok and Instagram — around the world. These can quickly grab the narrative and require a business response.\n\nIncoming: “Those two things are about to come together in a really, really big way and my experience tells me that businesses aren’t ready for this,” says Portland CEO Victoria Dean.\n\nShe added: “They find talking to politicians anxiety inducing — their instinct is to slightly ignore it … but our argument is it really does matter and you need to understand it’s going to be more different than ever before.”\n\nSocial affairs: A key argument from the team is that social issues can increasingly hijack the political narrative. Jo-ann Robertson, Ketchum’s CEO of global markets, says tracking these things can be much harder when they originate abroad.\n\nIn the bubble: “This kind of triple election is going to be fascinating from a consumer point of view and how that impacts the political class,” she said. “We are more interrelated than ever before, so issues that bubble up in the U.S. or the EU absolutely filter through to the U.K.”\n\nShe adds: “We know from history that major societal, political and economic issues that bubble up in the U.S. will often make their way across the pond, and particularly post-Brexit you see those new tensions between the EU and the U.K.”\n\nToolkit: By merging political and consumer expertise — as well as using proprietary software that tracks emerging conversation trends online — the pair believe they can prepare firms for the unexpected.\n\nAlarm bells: “It’s an early warning system for business here in the U.K. to say that we’re tracking a major issue bubbling up — and if it’s going to travel here, how are we going to be ready?” Robertson says.\n\nShe added: “The earlier you can get out on something and be prepared to respond, usually, the better your reputation is as you manage your way through it. I think that’s really powerful.”\n\nTrending issue: There’s a growing sense that the public affairs industry can no longer keep a narrow focus on Westminster gossip and their own policy brief. “I think any business in Britain that thinks it can just hide away when issues flare up and not have a view or communicate on them is mistaken,” Dean says.\n\nBuckle up: The Portland boss says political disruption in the U.K. means public affairs pros have been in a near constant cycle of policy shift and network-building, of the sort usually reserved for election periods.\n\nAnd: While people in government affairs are understandably “exhausted,” they are going to have to get ready to do it all over again — and on a bigger scale. “Issues bubble up in one jurisdiction and emerge elsewhere … I think we need to be hyper aware that the EU in particular wants to be the legislator of first choice … it’s very deliberate on their behalf to legislate fast and first, especially in the tech sector,” says Dean.\n\nNot me, guv: The long and short of it is: get clued up on other capitals or risk falling behind. Dean argues business critical issues like staffing, supply chains and data handling are all up for discussion.\n\nListen up: “All [British businesses] are going to be influenced and impacted by this in some form and have to pay attention to all three elections … We want to help them do that in a slightly less panicky reactive fashion than they’ve had to do in the last few years.”\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nCameron MacIndoe started as head of media and communications at London City Airport following a stint at Pagefield.\n\nShivani Bhatt joined Strand Partners as an executive.\n\nTom Martin joined Lexington as a director based in Leeds.\n\nKane Emerson left Emily Thornberry’s team to join YIMBY Alliance as head of housing research.\n\nBeki Elmer is starting a new role as associate director at Lansons.\n\nLeo Watson has been promoted to senior account director at Grayling.\n\nAdam Isaacs is joining Too Good To Go‘s public affairs team after a five year stint at Dentons.\n\nJobs jobs jobs: The Startup Coalition is hiring for a ClimateTech policy lead … The UK Warehousing Association needs a policy and public affairs manager … Bowel Cancer UK are on the hunt for a senior public affairs and campaigns officer … BACP are hiring a parliamentary and public affairs officer … College Green Group are looking for an account executive … Green Alliance are hiring for a political adviser … and Polimapper are looking for a business development manager.\n\nThanks: To editor Matt Honeycombe-Foster for being my little ray of sunshine.
