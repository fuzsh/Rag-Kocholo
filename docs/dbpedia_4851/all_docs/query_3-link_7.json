        "text": "Running as an Independent Candidate in 2024\n\nCandidates may have their name placed on the general election ballot as an independent candidate if they did not vote in the primary or runoff primary election of either party. (Sections 142.008, 162.003, 162.015 Texas Election Code).\n\nTo file as an independent candidate, candidates must follow a two-part process. A candidate MUST:\n\nFile a Declaration of Intent to Run as an Independent Candidate (PDF) between November 11, 2023 and 6:00 p.m. on December 11, 2023 with the county judge (county or precinct offices) or the Secretary of State (district and state offices) (Sections 142.002(b)(2), 142.005, Texas Election Code). This Declaration of Intent to Run as an Independent Candidate is mandatory. If you do not file a declaration during the applicable filing period, your subsequent candidate application will be rejected.\n\nFile a candidate application (PDF) | Spanish (PDF) along with a supporting nominating petition (PDF). The application, along with petition, must be filed by 5:00 p.m. on June 27, 2024, with the county judge (county or precinct offices) or the Secretary of State (district and state offices). (Sections 142.005, 142.006, Texas Election Code).\n\nDetails on Nominating Petition: After the primary elections (or after the primary runoff election, if the office you are seeking is involved in a primary runoff election), you must collect signatures from registered voters who support your candidacy. (Section 142.009, Texas Election Code).\n\nThe signers of your petition must be registered voters who have not participated in the general primary election or the runoff primary election of a party that has nominated, at either election, a candidate for the office you seek. (Section 142.009, Texas Election Code).\n\nCandidates for federal office must file a federal application (PDF) | Spanish (PDF).\n\nJudicial Candidates\n\nNEW LAW: Pursuant to HB 2384 (88th Leg., R.S.), effective September 1, 2023, candidates for certain judicial offices must provide additional information with their judicial application for a place on the ballot (PDF). (Section 141.0311, Texas Election Code) See Running for a Judicial Office in 2024 for more information.\n\nSee our FAQs on Party Affiliation and Candidacy for more details about how primary voting or candidacy affects (or does not affect) candidacy in the general election.\n\nContact the Secretary of State’s office concerning the number of signatures required.\n\nIndependent (Nonpartisan) Candidate Public Office Sought in 2024 File Declaration of Intent and Application with Additional Information Required Nominating Petition Sec of State County Judge % Signatures a Maximum Number of Signature b\n\nUnited States Senator\n\nx - - 1% -\n\nUnited States Representative\n\nx - - 5% 500\n\nRailroad Commissioner\n\nx - - 1% -\n\nJustice, Supreme Court\n\nx - x 1% -\n\nJudge, Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nx - x 1% -\n\nState Senator\n\nx - - 5% 500\n\nState Representative\n\nx - - 5% 500\n\nMember, State Board of Education\n\nx - - 5% 500\n\nChief Justice and Justice, Court of Appeals\n\nx - x 5% 500\n\nDistrict Judge\n\nx - x 5% 500\n\nCriminal District Judge\n\nx - x 5% 500\n\nFamily District Judge\n\nx - x 5% 500\n\nDistrict Attorney\n\nx - - 5% 500\n\nCriminal District Attorney\n\nx - - 5% 500\n\nCounty Judge\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nJudge, County Court-at-Law\n\n- x x 5% 500\n\nJudge, County Criminal Court\n\n- x x 5% 500\n\nJudge, County Probate Court\n\n- x x 5% 500\n\nCounty Attorney\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nSheriff\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nTax Assessor-Collector\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nCounty Commissioner\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nConstable\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nJustice of the Peace\n\n- x - 5% 500\n\nSource: Texas Election Code Section\n\n§§142.002, 142.005 §141.0311 §142.007"
