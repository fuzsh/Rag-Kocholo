        "text": "The federal government and ACA aren‚Äôt the only culprits; state insurance departments enjoy running little fiefdoms of their own and imposing pet mandates as well (there was a stretch of time during which hair transplants were deemed mandatory in Minnesota - though that‚Äôs neither directed at Michael F. Cannon nor yours truly üòâ). I‚Äôd go a step further - let employers decide what state‚Äôs laws they‚Äôd like to have apply to their health plans. We‚Äôd likely see a reduction in both state premiums taxes (wait; what? the states have a material interest in keeping premiums high?!?) and ill-conceived benefit mandates at the state level. benefEx benefit consulting or a local Mitigate Partners advisor can help with these and other strategies‚Ä¶\n\nThis Ask Me Anything with Peter Koenig and Nadjeschda Taranczewski, MCC was another rich conversation. Topics covered were: ü§î When dealing with members of a younger generation who have prioritised purpose over money and who less money than previous generations - what is the right way to handle this? ü§î What about sources who are world leaders that are refusing to leave the stage? ü§î How to talk to people who have a lot of money while also dealing with people who don't have any money and are feeling very threatened by crumbling structures. How can you do justice to everyone with such different realities and needs? ü§î How to know if you really dropped the role of source in an initiative and let go of the vision? ü§î How do you reclaim source when you feel someone has taken over? Watch the replay below and join us for the next AMA on August 20th https://lnkd.in/dpg_Mgyz\n\nI have been waiting for the right moment to post this message and after the last 48 hours, now is the right time. Your marginalized and multicultural communities are suffering. Most of us who were born here are now suffering from an identity crisis and a belonging crisis. I urge you to check in on your colleagues and make sure that they take 5. They may look OK but they are not. Let us remember that diversity and inclusion are not mere buzzwords or checkboxes on an agenda. They are living, breathing concepts that require genuine care, understanding, and action. By encouraging an atmosphere of empathy and compassion, we can create spaces where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued. Over these months, we have witnessed the power of our convictions as we engage in impactful boycotts. By supporting local businesses and rejecting those that fail to align with our values, we are not only reshaping the market but also shifted the spotlight onto the importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. As we continue down this transformative path, let us remember that the true power lies within us ‚Äì within our collective to bring change, within our ability to lead by example, a world that embraces compassion. I encourage you to watch the below video, it is a powerful message, I have watched it a few times since Christmas. I also encourage you to google Harrison Ford's aka Indiana Jones üòâ 2019 Climate message which is equally as powerful. Thank you https://lnkd.in/e4UDDHHH\n\nThis isn't just a red pill, it's an 800mg horse pill sized reminder of what is required to be free. Gary Barnett reminds us, if any out there want freedom, you will have to take it. Keeping in mind that it's an election year, politicians will be making many promises they don't intend to keep. Jacob Hornberger lays out the difference between serfdom reform vs. liberty. If you're skeptical about whether it makes a difference where you get your information, you need to see this. NPR veteran Uri Berliner explains how the network lost America's trust and became an echo chamber. What can be done to help heal the growing divisions in our society and culture? Kelly Gregg and Conrad Kickert say that happier, more connected neighborhoods start right in the front yard. Article of the Day: This is your regular reminder that the people who foisted a souped up coronavirus on us and locked down the world in a naked power grab are still in power. Michael Herman reviews the facts for anyone interested. Sponsors: Life Saving Food Fifty Two Seven Alliance Iron Sight Brewing Co. Quilt &amp; Sew\n\nHappy Friday! üèò Here are a few ways Delib's Citizen Space Engagement Platform can help authorities meet housing regulatory standards: üëÄ Transparency and Accountability: it integrates feedback mechanisms and online forums, enabling authorities to openly communicate plans, proposals, and regulatory standards. This fosters a transparent environment, vital for meeting regulatory requirements. Create dedicated pages on your site for information gathering, participation opportunities, and feedback collection from previous engagement phases. Plus, our advanced Response Publishing tool allows you to publish responses in a controlled, accessible environment. Example customer page for JLP: https://lnkd.in/ei6_2hkm üñá Consultation and Feedback: the platform excels at enabling public consultations on housing policies, plans, and regulatory changes. With multiple formats tailored for effortless handling of large-scale and complex document consultations, including a chapter-based format for organising themes and policy areas, engaging with citizens has never been easier. Automatic summary reports and intelligent analysis tools seamlessly close the feedback loop, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making processes. Great example of Sevenoaks utilising the Response Publishing tool for their LP: https://lnkd.in/e-dQhwup üìÉ Document management: centralise housing regulation documents effortlessly, including policy documents, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks. This ensures seamless accessibility to all pertinent information for citizens and stakeholders alike, fostering compliance with regulatory standards. ü§ù Accessibility and Inclusivity: prioritises accessibility for all citizens, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology. Consolidate all online and face-to-face engagement data into one platform for comprehensive analysis. Our content-led approach allows for the inclusion of easy-to-understand symbols, emojis, and even British Sign Language (BSL) videos directly within questions. Built on fully responsive web design, our platform seamlessly adapts to all devices and screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience. Plus, our interactive mapping Geospatial tool is optimised for mobile use, enhancing accessibility for all users. Let us know if you'd like to learn more about Citizen Space and its capabilities. I can set up a free demo of the platform for you too, or if a customer chat to your dedicated Customer Success Manager!"
