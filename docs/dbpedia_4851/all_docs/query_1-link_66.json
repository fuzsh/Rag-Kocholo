        "text": "Araceli holds dual roles at LIFT. As the Deputy Director of LIFT-Los Angeles, she manages all program activities and member services. She supervises a diverse team of program staff and Social Work student interns while developing and strengthening partnerships in the community. In her role as the Race, Equity and Inclusion (REI) National Advisor, she helps develop, guide, monitor and implement program activities that will meet the organization’s REI goals. For over two years, Araceli has lead the organization’s REI Advisory Committee who’s members represent each region and department in the organization.\n\nAraceli earned a bachelor’s degree in Social Work from San Jose State University and a master’s degree from University of Southern California. As a Social Worker, she has dedicated her career to working with vulnerable communities. Before coming to LIFT, Araceli managed a home visiting program for pregnant women, and infants. Araceli managed a child abuse prevention home visitation program, which focused on strengthening families and reducing risk of child abuse and neglect.\n\nAraceli grew up in South Los Angeles and currently resides in East Los Angeles with her husband and two daughters. Araceli loves her work at LIFT because she knows firsthand what living in poverty feels like. She is committed to doing her part to ensure that her daughters’ children do not experience poverty, or live in fear simply because of their gender, last name and color of their skin.\n\nAllie leads the team at LIFT-Los Angeles. In her role, she is responsible for developing the organization’s vision, and achieving its goals for continued financial stability, community engagement and enhancing the impact of its program.\n\nEquity and access have always been at the heart of Allie’s work. She lifts because she has the same hopes for the families of LIFT that she has for her own family—that they too will get to live the life that they dream of and reach their full potential. Allie firmly believes that one’s zip code, the language that one speaks, one’s educational level, the color of one’s skin or the amount of money in one’s bank account should not determine the opportunities that one is afforded. She is inspired by how LIFT approaches its work—through relationships based in respect, human dignity, authenticity and trust. She believes that LIFT has the power to equalize the future for children and families—helping to be the support system that families need to provide bright futures for their children.\n\nAllie brings more than a decade of nonprofit experience to her new role. She began her career working in NYC public schools developing academic, enrichment, after school & mentoring programs for middle and high school youth.\n\nMost recently, Allie served as the National Director of Corporate Partnerships at Reading Partners. She played a key leadership role across all 14 regions in elevating the organization’s strategy and engagement with corporate partners. Prior to joining Reading Partners, Allie spent eight years at City Year. She last served as the National Director of Business Development for the organization. In this role, she raised millions of dollars for the organization’s local and national programs and engaged thousands of corporate volunteers in the schools and communities in which the organization served.\n\nAllie attended Vassar College and majored in Latin American Studies, Spanish, and Education and received her New York State Teacher’s Certification in Adolescent Education, Spanish. She is the proud mama of two small children who inspire her daily, keep her on her toes and push her to dream a little bigger. She resides in Los Angeles with her husband, two children and their crazy terrier.\n\nMichelle’s career has been defined by standing up for equity and access for disenfranchised individuals and communities. Prior to joining LIFT, Michelle spent nearly 20 years leading youth and community development efforts in New York and Los Angeles. Michelle joined LIFT in 2012 as the Founding LIFT-Los Angeles Executive Director where she seeded many of the program innovations that are now core to LIFT’s nationwide program model, including the focus on an intergenerational approach to breaking the cycle of poverty, the integration of financial coaching into traditional supports, and giving cash directly to members. After serving as LIFT’s Chief Cities Officer overseeing all of LIFT’s regional operations, in 2019, Michelle was promoted to and now serves as LIFT’s Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMichelle LIFTs because she believes in the transformative power of “hope, money and love” – her signature take on LIFT’s special sauce. Her own parents loved her fiercely and instilled in her the notion that she could do and be anything she wanted. She fully understands that this firm belief and investment in her possibility provided a buffer against socioeconomic inequity. It is an honor for her to pass on this transformative power of love, backed by rigor and dedication, to populations historically marginalized and unjustly overburdened by stigma, isolation, and disregard.\n\nMichelle is a sought-after public speaker and thought leader whose has been featured in SSIR, Variety magazine, LA Magazine, NPR’s Marketplace, and the 2018 United State of Women Summit, amongst others. She is a Senior Fellow at both the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab at the USC Marshall School of Business, a Promise Venture Fellow, and part of the inaugural class of ProInspire’s Catalyst Collective of BIPOC nonprofit executives across the country,\n\nMichelle resides in Los Angeles and is the proud mother of two beautiful children who are her ultimate source of motivation and inspiration. She loves them fiercely!\n\nNeils joined LIFT-DC as their Executive Director in 2023. Prior to LIFT, Neils worked at Stronger Consulting as an Associate Partner of their strategy consulting division. Prior to Stronger, Neils worked at DC Prep Public Charter School as the Chief of External Affairs supporting fundraising, communication, community engagement efforts, and college access and success during his tenure. Neils also previously worked for College Track as the launch director for the DC region.\n\nNeils worked for City Year, Inc. for nearly a decade, serving as a regional managing director for recruitment and admissions and start-up executive director for City Year Tulsa. Neils also served as an impact director and impact manager for City Year Washington, DC, helping to start five new school partnerships and supporting City Year in the Congress Heights area. Neils is a member of the Fall 2018 Cohort of Pahara NextGen Fellowship, the 2014 LEAD class of City Year, and he served as an AmeriCorps member of the 2009 class of City Year Washington, DC.\n\nThe son of Ghanaian immigrants, Neils was born and raised in Alexandria, Virginia.

In 2017 Neils founded a nonprofit consulting business called Heroes for Hire which specializes in social entrepreneurship. He currently resides in Capitol Heights, Maryland with his wife, Shamelle, and their two sons.\n\nAt LIFT, Helah oversees new program design and implementation across the organization’s four regions. She works closely with the regional teams to use Member feedback, program evaluation data, and stakeholder input to improve LIFT’s services, design new program innovations, and maximize impact.\n\nHelah LIFTs because she believes in every person’s potential to succeed when they are supported by their community and connected to the right opportunities and resources.\n\nBefore joining LIFT, Helah served as Program Manager-Africa at Vital Voices Global Partnership, a Washington, D.C.-based international development NGO that identifies and invests in emerging women leaders around the world. At Vital Voices, Helah designed and led a multi-million dollar, a multi-year international economic development program for women entrepreneurs across sub-Saharan Africa and served as the regional expert for Vital Voices’ human rights and political participation programs in the region. Helah also has experience in organizational capacity building, strategic planning, and stakeholder engagement, and research. Helah holds a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service and a Certificate in International Development from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and a Master of Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School. While at the Kennedy School she received the Carr Center Prize for Human Rights and worked with a team of students to recommend improvements to Boston’s early education portfolio.\n\nAs Chief Operations and Finance Officer, Rebecca will lead our efforts to create a strong and sustainable organization that positions LIFT for even greater impact and sustainability. A member of LIFT’s Executive Team, Rebecca’s portfolio will include finance, operations, talent and culture, and technology, and she will contribute to our overall organizational development efforts.\n\nRebecca’s work has crossed multiple fields, including education, workforce and community development, and most recently local news. The throughline of her career, regardless of the context, is a passion for using business and management skills to create strong and healthy organizations poised for sustainable growth, strong service delivery, and impact.\n\nIn her most recent leadership role, Rebecca was COO of the education news organization, Chalkbeat, where she helped build a $2 million project into a $10 million, eight-city operation prepared for its next phase of growth. She helped the CEO put in place the capabilities the organization needed to thrive and has since been working with other news entrepreneurs around the country who need operations, finance, and planning support to achieve their strategic visions.\n\nEarlier in her career, she helped design anti-poverty solutions and strengthened the capacity of organizations that execute these strategies. As a VP at ideas42, she developed behavioral interventions aimed at promoting better economic mobility outcomes for students, workers, and families. As a VP at Seedco, she launched conditional cash transfer experiments that created an early evidence base for giving cash directly to families, and designed strategies that helped workers stretch their pay.\n\nShe LIFTS because income inequality in this country continues to grow, and the work of addressing socioeconomic disparities could not be any more urgent.\n\nRebecca holds a BA from Vassar College and an MPA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Fels Institute of Government. She resides in Maplewood, NJ, with her husband and her two kids.\n\nAs Chief Advancement Officer, Gabe leads our development and communications teams to build philanthropic support for LIFT. As a key member of the executive team, Gabe is also instrumental in contributing to strategy, management, and culture to move LIFT’s work forward.\n\nGabe LIFTs to ensure every parent can create a strong foundation for their children. He joins LIFT from New Leaders, where he served as Chief Development Officer. Gabe managed a team of regional and national fundraising professionals to raise more than $15M annually, collaborated closely with colleagues to ensure funding supported key priorities, and shaped organizational strategy as a member of New Leaders’ executive team.\n\nBefore joining New Leaders, Gabe served in a variety of roles at Teach For America-New York. During his tenure, he doubled the incoming TFA corps from 200 to 400 members, negotiated a large district contract with increased general operating support, and launched an early childhood education program line.
