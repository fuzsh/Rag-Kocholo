        "text": "Voters in Stroud district head to the polls on Thursday (May 2) to elect their representatives on the District Council.\n\nAll 51 seats at Ebley Mill are up for grabs at the which is currently led by a co-operative alliance of the Green, Independent Left, Community Independent and Liberal Democrat Groups.\n\nGoing into the elections, the Conservatives have 18 seats, the Greens 14, there are four Community Independents, four Independent Left councillors, four Labour members, three Liberal Democrats and two non-specified councillors. There is also a vacant seat in Nailsworth due to the death of much-respected Norman Kay in December last year.\n\nREAD MORE: Local elections 2024: List of candidates competing for a seat on Cheltenham Borough Council\n\nMORE NEWS: Local elections 2024: List of candidates competing for a seat on Gloucester City Council\n\nEach of the main parties and groups have set out below the reasons why they believe people should vote for them on May 2.\n\nCommunity Independents\n\nStroud District Community Independents is a network of community leaders and independent councillors, who practise politics based on kindness, compassion and common decency.\n\nWe're not politically led and we aren't told what to do, say or think by any national political party. We do not serve the interests of others, only our communities.\n\nWe have chosen not to field candidates for every ward in Stroud as other groups have done. We don't agree with this practice which leads to increased hostility between political parties and instead we choose to put forward people who we know will give everything to their communities in wards close to where they actually live.\n\nWe have four candidates standing: Charlie Mitchell in Cainscross, Thea Pilikian in Stroud Slade and Helen Elliott-Boult and Robin Layfield in Rodborough.\n\nIf you want to elect someone who cares about what you think more than what's being shouted about in the newspapers then vote for us.\n\nConservative Party\n\nWe urge residents of the Stroud District to cast their votes in favour of your hard working local Conservative candidates in the forthcoming elections.\n\nOver 12+ years, Stroud has experienced the challenges of governance under a fragmented coalition. This has resulted in missed opportunities for vital funding, exemplified by the loss of over £16 million in Levelling Up Funding due to administrative inefficiencies. Moreover, the local planning process, lacking resident input, has faced significant setbacks, including a ten-month pause prompted by fundamental concerns from planning inspectors.\n\nThe coalition of Greens, independent groups elected as Labour councillors, and the Liberal Democrats has failed to provide cohesive leadership or tangible progress.\n\nBy electing Conservatives, Stroud stands to benefit from:\n\n· Promoting business growth and fostering supportive environments.\n\n· Ensuring sound financial management.\n\n· Facilitating the development of purpose-built housing in suitable locations.\n\n· Enhancing community involvement in the planning process.\n\n· Strengthening collaborative ties with neighboring authorities for mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nGreen Party\n\nThe Green Party is growing, with more councillors than ever before in Stroud District. Stroud Greens have a practical vision of positive change, based on the Greens’ commitment to investing in communities, our shared environment, and the local economy.\n\nThis builds on many years of Green councillors’ experience at the District Council, and the past two years that we’ve been leading it. Green councillors put social justice, nature and the climate crisis at the heart of everything we do.\n\nWe thrive on collaborative working, with many of our biggest achievements securing backing from all the political parties. We have a plan to build more energy-efficient council homes, to support training for new jobs in the renewable energy and building sectors, to invest in market towns, to develop health and wellbeing services, to support cultural activities and to renew play areas, amongst other things.\n\nIf you like our manifesto, please join us!\n\nLabour Party\n\nVoters will have a full slate of Labour candidates on ballot papers, whichever ward they are in, for the first time in over 20 years.\n\nLabour has outlined a programme of work they plan to implement if they win control. They plan to reduce energy bills through new sustainable, locally owned, community energy schemes. Work is already underway thanks to an expert team pulled together by Dr Simon Opher, Labour’s MP candidate and local GP.\n\nLabour has also pledged to work with tenant groups in the Stroud District, making community engagement a priority, and work to bring all social and private rented homes up to a good living standard. Labour has successfully worked with Community Land Trusts to build more affordable homes and plans to continue this work to help to reduce the housing waiting list.\n\nIf elected, Labour councillors plan to maintain free car parking where it already exists, and review parking charges in Stroud town.\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nThe Liberal Democrats exist to build a fair, free and open society in which no-one is enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity. In very tough times, now more than ever people deserve A Fair Deal.\n\nWhen budgets are tight it’s more important than ever that local residents are championed at Stroud District Council. Liberal Democrat Councillors fight to retain all the amenities and services that make each community, whether village or town, across the District such special places to live.\n\nIn these elections Liberal Democrats stand for:\n\nA cleaner, safer environment\n\nImproved roads and local transport networks\n\nBetter, more accessible local health services\n\nA vibrant and sustainable local economy in every community\n\nWhen elected our councillors have a track record of successfully fighting to keep local bus services and other community assets, of road safety initiatives, and of responding effectively to individual resident issues. Liberal Democrats get things done, for all of us.\n\nTrade Unionist and Socialist Coalition\n\nThe Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) is standing 279 candidates across 55 authorities, including four candidates in the Stroud District in May’s elections in England. Every TUSC candidate is committed to stand up to the establishment parties, including Reform, who have all shown themselves to be virtually indistinguishable when it comes to representing the interests of working class people – in domestic policy and foreign policy too.\n\nWe believe we need a new political party to represent the interests of ordinary working class people. The TUSC core policy platform for our 2024 council candidates is that every one of them will be a stop the cuts and stop the war candidate in the May 2nd polls.\n\nWe oppose austerity, the cuts and privatisations that are destroying our public services and causing widespread poverty. This economic crisis is the result of the greed of the wealthiest 1 per cent and their representatives in all the main political parties.\n\nStroud District Council election candidates by ward\n\nAmberley and Woodchester\n\nCanning, Sarah -
