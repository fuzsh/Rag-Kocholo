        "text": "A\n\nMargaret Adams Scholarship Endowment\n\nMargaret Adams was associated with Bay Health Systems and very supportive all of nursing students. She believed in the training Delta College offered for both licensed practical nurses (LPN) as well as registered nurses (RN), and felt each type of student needed support. This scholarship was established in her name as the result of a financial contribution that was received back in 1972.\n\nAndrew F. & Mary H. Anderson Scholarship Endowment\n\nThis scholarship honors Andrew and Mary Anderson of Bay City. Andrew worked at Northern Automotive Supply Company, a company his father Oscar founded, and served as president from 1962 until his passing in 2000. Many Anderson family members have been connected to Delta College. Oscar, was a member of the “Committee of 300” (considered to be the College’s founders) and served as a Charter Member of the Delta College Board of Trustees in 1957. Oscar’s daughter, Annette Diebel, later served on the Board of Trustees from 1975 until 1993. And Andrew’s wife Mary founded the Delta College Flute Choir in 1974. In 2011, the Anderson family honored Delta College’s 50th anniversary by helping to create the Delta Sculpture Walk and contributing for the construction of the “Currents” sculpture on main campus.\n\nAthletic Scholarship Endowment\n\nDelta College Athletics has a commitment to excellence and addresses the total student athlete. We are committed to coaching our athletes to success, not only on the field of play, but also in academics, through personal growth, career and community service. Students are challenged to appreciate the value of a total education. They learn on the court or field but are also well-rounded in the classroom. For years, the Delta College Foundation organized an annual Delta College Golf Classic. This event raised money for men's and women’s athletic scholarships and equipment needs. Although the event has been discontinued, the accumulated proceeds are held in an endowment that support Delta College's athletes.\n\nB\n\nM. Seth Babcock Scholarship Endowment\n\nThis scholarship was established in memory of M. Seth Babcock, a successful Bay City businessman who passed away in 1947. Mr. Babcock was an accountant and successful realtor, who then became a part owner of Bay City Dredge Works, later renamed Bay City Shovels. He joined the company in 1917 and it eventually became one of the most successful manufacturers of excavators and cranes. Mr. Babcock believed in the power of education, having served for a time on the Board of Education in Bay City. This scholarship was launched in 1961, when Delta College opened its doors.\n\nMary Ann (McGregor) Badour Scholarship Endowment\n\nMary Ann (McGregor) Badour, a well-known realtor in the Saginaw area, opened Marshall Realty in 1972 and merged her business with Keller Williams Realty in Saginaw. She was born in Saginaw, and is the mother of one daughter, Leslie Ann Lowell. She believes in education and realizes the difference it can make in a person’s life. She is also interested in helping area students achieve their dreams and reach their educational goals.\n\nJames W. & Joy A. Baker Scholarship Endowment\n\nJames W.
