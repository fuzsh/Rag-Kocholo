        "text": "Guests: Ed Rendell, Marcy Kaptur; Jim McDermott, Jamal Simmons, Maria Teresa Kumar, Dana Milbank, Joseph Lowery\n\nREVEREND AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: Welcome to \"Politics Nation.\" I`m Al\n\nSharpton.\n\nTonight`s lead, Bain of his existence. The Obama campaign is going right\n\nat what they must see as a major weakness in Mitt Romney`s appearance to\n\nvoters. His time at Bain Capital, and they`re taking that into the heart\n\nof the country.\n\nToday, vice president Joe Biden went to a manufacturing plant in\n\nYoungstown, Ohio today and unloaded.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I resent the fact that I\n\nthink we are talking about envy, job envy, wealth envy. That we don`t\n\ndream. My mother believed and my father believed that if I want today be\n\npresident of the United States I could be, I could be vice president. They\n\ndreamed as much as any rich guy dreams.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: They don`t get us. They don`t get who we are.\n\nThis election is going to be a choice between two fundamentally different\n\nphilosophies. That choice is about whether or not we`re going to rebuild\n\nthe middle class, or continue to help those at the top and hope everything\n\nworks out well.\n\nRomney made sure the guys at the top got to play by a separate set of\n\nrules. He ran up mass of debts in the Middle class laws. And folks, he\n\nthinks that experience is going to help our economy?\n\nLet`s take a look. Look, with these guys, past is prologue, man. So, I\n\nwant you to think about what he will do as president. Laying on debt,\n\nlaying off workers, doing what could for those at the top while every else\n\nspends for themselves. We can`t afford that in the valley. We cannot\n\nafford that in a nation.\n\nThings really are starting to come back. There are signs of life, and\n\nhope, and heart in the heartland. Jobs are starting to come back. And the\n\nones coming back are the kind of jobs you can build a middle class family\n\non.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSHARPTON: The kinds of jobs you can build a middle class family on.\n\nThey`re taking the fight to places that build this country. Pennsylvania,\n\nWisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio. Places where millions of\n\nAmericans have been hit hard by the economic downturn.\n\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs while Governor Romney and his pals at\n\nBain Capital made off with millions of dollars in profits. This week the\n\npresident hit Romney with an ad featuring workers from a steel mill in\n\nKansas city that Bain Capital shut down.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You get up on national TV and brag about making jobs,\n\nwhen he has destroyed thousands of people`s careers, lifetimes, just\n\ndestroying people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: And today we learned of another company that Bain shut down in\n\nFlorida. Dade Behring, which, saddled with debt, wound up shuttering two\n\nmedical technology facilities in Miami. Some 850 jobs were lost. While\n\nBain walked away with $242 million. And 800 percent return on its\n\ninvestment.\n\nBut for some reason, Willard continues to pretend he is a great job\n\ncreator. He will have to fool hard hit workers in places like Ohio where\n\nvice president Biden spoke today, and where the president`s policies have\n\nalready helped millions of Americans.\n\nIn 2010, 10.6 percent of the state was unemployed, but unemployment has now\n\ndropped to 7.5 percent today. It`s no wonder President Obama officially\n\nkicked off his campaign in Ohio, and went right after Willard`s time at\n\nBain Capital.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He`s one large financial\n\nfirm. And I think he has drawn the wrong lessons from those experiences.\n\nHe sincerely believes that`s if CEO and wealthy investors like him make\n\nmoney, the rest of us will prosper as well.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMitt Romney may have a credible response to this line of attack, but if so,\n\nwe haven`t heard it yet.\n\nJoining me now is Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, and former\n\nPennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, now an MSNBC political news analyst.\n\nThanks to both of you for being here tonight.\n\nREP. MARCY KAPTUR (D), OHIO: Thank you, Rev.\n\nED RENDELL, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: My pleasure.\n\nSHARPTON: Congresswoman, you`re up for reelection in Ohio, does the attack\n\non Romney`s time at Bain resonate with voter in your state?\n\nKAPTUR: It resonates. Our people understand what corporate radars are.\n\nWe have seen them coming to our areas, suck our community dries of equity,\n\nshutdown plants, get very rich in the process to put thousands of thousands\n\nof workers put out of work. Even Governor Rick Perry of Texas called Mitt\n\nRomney a vulture capitalist. Books are written about barbarian of the gate\n\nand those that run the Hedge funds and company that`s come in and just suck\n\nthe equity out throwing thousands and thousands and thousands of people out\n\nof work. Our people have experienced this firsthand.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, Governor Rendell, Mr. Romney has accused the president of\n\ntrying to divide the country with class warfare, let me show you his\n\nstatement this year.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, I think it`s about\n\nenvy. I think it is about class warfare. I think when you have a\n\npresident encouraging the idea of dividing America based on 99 percent\n\nversus one percent and those people who have been most successful will be\n\nin the one percent. You open a new wave of approach in this country which\n\nentirely inconsistent with concept of one nation under God.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: No. In the heartland, where you were governor of Pennsylvania,\n\nwhere people have suffered and absolutely have felt the pain of the\n\neconomic downturn, will the class warfare argument by Romney resonate?\n\nRENDELL: No, I think as the campaign moves on, people are going to see\n\nthat what the president wants to do is really help create jobs for the\n\nmiddle class. And he wants to do it by getting our economy back on track\n\nand that means balancing the budget, and that means that the wealthiest\n\nAmericans should pay more.\n\nBut, you know, one thing people should understand, Reverend, is the\n\npresident is not saying we should go back to the days when people in the\n\ntop one percent paid 70 percent or 50 percent of their income on taxes.\n\nHe is saying they should go back to the days of bill Clinton when they paid\n\nnot 35 percent they pay, but 39 percent. And think about that, under Bill\n\nClinton, we created 23.5 million new jobs, and those rich people, even\n\nthough they feel a little more taxes, they got really rich during that same\n\ntime.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, it`s not just his history then, but his policies now. What\n\nhe is saying now, he is a pro-Ryan plan, $2.9 trillion in cuts to low\n\nincome programs. Wants tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Would\n\nrepeal affordable care act, would slash Social Security and Medicare.\n\nCongresswoman, we`re not just talking about Romney of yesteryear, we are\n\ntalking about what he is advocating today as a candidate for president.\n\nKAPTUR: That is correct. He and all of his friends like Congressman Ryan\n\nas the budget committee, Senator Portman, even my opponent, Joe the\n\nplumber, they all favor helping the one percent, and I think - and what\n\nabout the other 99 percent? What about the middle class?\n\nIf you look at hedge fund managers and hedge fund executives, they pay 15\n\npercent. It would be great if all the Bain Capital executives including\n\nGovernor Romney would pay the same thing as my neighbors pay. Let them pay\n\nas they raise as the middle class pays tax. That isn`t happening. So they\n\nsheltered income in a thousand ways, and they made huge amounts of fortune\n\noff of raiding companying, and they`re not playing by the same rules. So\n\nthey`re protecting the super class that has done so much to damage this\n\neconomy.\n\nSHARPTON: So, let me get this right, Congresswoman. In your district, the\n\nticket is Willard Romney and Joe the plumber.\n\nKAPTUR: That is correct.\n\nSHARPTON: And Mr. the Plumber, or Joe the plumber, how I should refer to\n\nhim, is supporting Willard and the Ryan plan I assume.\n\nKAPTUR: He certainly is. I can`t understand, of course, you know Joe,\n\nthat`s not his name and he`s not a plumber actually. I don`t know why he\n\nwould be supporting those policies. He should be fighting for the middle\n\nclass, not the super rich.\n\nSHARPTON: Now Governor Rendell, Congresswoman says Plumber is not a\n\nplumber, Mr. Romney says he`s a job creator, but he has a hard time\n\nexplaining how he is a job creator. Watch this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP0\n\nROMNEY: In some businesses shrunk, we tried to turn them around, sometimes\n\nsuccessfully, sometimes not. But let`s not forget, this is the free\n\nenterprises that capitalism works. Free enterprise works. You never want\n\nto see an enterprise go bankrupt. And those that have been documented to\n\nhave lost jobs lost about 10,000 jobs.\n\nI`m someone who believes in free enterprise. Free enterprise with all of\n\nthis different dimensions and plays makes America the strongest economic\n\nnation in the world.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Now that`s him responding in debates in a Republican primary for\n\nbeing attacked for his service as CEO of Bain, and where he has touted this\n\nas his record as a job creator, and he is trying to justify Bain.\n\nTherefore, is it not legitimate, Governor Rendell, that the opponents, of\n\ncourse the incumbent president and his team, raise questions about his\n\nbehavior and what happened under his tenure at Bain.\n\nRENDELL: Absolutely. And you know, Governor Romney keep saying that they\n\ncreated a whole lot more jobs than they closed down. Well, he should open\n\nthe books at Bain, tell Bain to open the books so the press can look at\n\nthat and do an accurate computation.\n\nBut, Reverend, I think there is one other factor that (INAUDIBLE).\n\nGovernmental experience matters too. But, Governor Romney saying that as\n\npresident, he will know what to do to create jobs where he was essentially\n\nthe president of a state. The governor is a president of the state, the\n\nstate of Massachusetts. And while he was governor of Massachusetts for\n\nfour years, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation, 47\n\nout of 50 states.\n\nAnd remember, Massachusetts had has all of the new hightech.com businesses\n\nand they still ranked only 47th in job creation during his term as\n\ngovernor. That to me is even more telling than Bain.\n\nSHARPTON: And two of those that were underneath him, in the 47th percent\n\nwere hit by Katrina that year. So, let`s not forget that.\n\nAnd thank you for being on, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and Governor Ed\n\nRendell.\n\nKAPTUR: Thank you, Reverend.\n\nSHARPTON: Congresswoman, tell Joe the plumber, if he wants equal time,\n\ncall Al the preacher. But, I`m really a preacher.\n\nAhead, hours after W elevator endorsement, Willard can`t seem to remember\n\nBush`s name. Funny how that happens? And why Sarah Palin`s latest move\n\nhas Republicans talking, a big story could be developing behind closed\n\ndoors.\n\nAnd the political beer test. Why President Obama`s likeability might be\n\nthe answer to all of that GOP money.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: You know. You have a bunch of people around who are always\n\nlaughing at your jokes and thinking you`re funny, and all the stuffs.\n\nMichelle is like, this guy? And I will tell you, when she does it in front\n\nof my team, they love it, they`ll crack up. And the, I`ll look at them and\n\nthen.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: You`re watching \"Politics Nation\" on MSNBC.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSHARPTON: Nothing beats the summer time, days at the beach, cookouts with\n\nfriends, and of course John Boehner making threats to hold the economy\n\nhostage. That`s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSHARPTON: It`s hard to believe, but summer is just around the corner. Get\n\nready for the barbeques, the beach days, and of course, Speaker John\n\nBoehner bringing the economy to the edge of collapse. Yes, Boehner is\n\nalready at it again, restarting last summer`s drag out fight to raise the\n\ndebt limit. But he says it`s no threat.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Speaker Boehner, why are threatening default\n\non the debt limit in May of 2012?\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER (R), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I am not threatening default.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Boehner and other leaders met behind closed doors at the White\n\nHouse today, and guess how that went? Leader Pelosi tells us about it.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP0\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: I haven`t heard Kumbaya\n\n(ph) in so long I would not recognize it. I`m glad Speaker enjoyed the\n\nsandwiches. I think the - was it frank, but cordial conversation.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: I don`t think we will be hearing Kumbaya (ph) this summer.\n\nJoining me now is Congressman Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington.\n\nCongressman, this was a huge failure last summer, why would Speaker Boehner\n\nthreaten to do this again?\n\nREP. JIM MCDERMOTT (D), WASHINGTON: Well, Reverend, if I didn`t know\n\nbetter, I would think John Boehner was a slow learner. When he went\n\nthrough all that stuff he went through last year and brought the country to\n\nall that chaos, you would think he would not want to do that get in an\n\nelection year. Except for the fact that they decided that the best way to\n\nbeat the president is to create chaos, don`t solve any problems, makes a\n\nmess everywhere you can, throw everybody under the bus you can get a hold\n\nof, anything that will prevent Barack Obama from being re-elected.\n\nJohn Boehner does not care about the people of the United States. If he\n\ndid, he would never be talking about threatening him again, and threatening\n\nthe recovery that`s going on in this country.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, the fact that the congressional approval rating fell to a\n\nthen record low after the last debt ceiling fight. Only 13 percent\n\napproved of congress last August. So, I mean, he is not even doing well\n\nfor his own colleagues.\n\nMCDERMOTT: No, you know if you think about it, he is going into an\n\nelection where he has to elect some of these folks that he has drug back\n\nand forth through the mud on his own side for these silly vote that don`t\n\ngo anywhere and make them look bad. There a tax on women and a tax on all\n\nkinds of things, on science, where ever you look, he dragged them through\n\nthis, and now he is going to say go out and get yourself reelected. He has\n\nbeen no help whatsoever to them. And I think he is going to wind up asking\n\nMrs. Pelosi, would she please take the gavel from the next January.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, he is not by himself because Paul Ryan was on CNBC\n\nyesterday. And he was asked about whether he compromised. And this is\n\nwhat he had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE ANCHOR: You got to give up something, you can`t have a\n\ndeal just by saying this is my position.\n\nREP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN: So look, I`m not interested in negotiating\n\nwith myself on television, that futile in my opinion.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Now, we see that the speaker, has said, after the meeting,\n\nPresident Obama spokesman says he doesn`t want a replay of last summer`s\n\nfight, but Boehner`s office had a much different take. He says, the\n\nspeaker told the president quote, \"as long as I`m here - as long as I`m\n\naround here, I`m not going to allow a debit ceiling increase without doing\n\nsomething serious about the debt.\"\n\nBut, at the same Congressman, Boehner could be trying to use a debt limit\n\nas a bargaining tool because on January 1st, the Bush tax cuts expire and\n\n$500 billion in defense cuts will start to go into effect. Is that what\n\nthey`re after trying to raise some kind of bargaining chip on this?\n\nMCDERMOTT: My feeling is, Al, they have created the perfect storm. They\n\nhave all of those tax cuts. They got all of those cuts in the military.\n\nThey got all of the discretionary cuts in the budget, all coming due along\n\nwith this debt crisis at the same time right around the election.\n\nAnd I believe they really have no interest in anything but capturing the\n\nWhite House. Boehner became the chief spokesman for the Romney team to get\n\nRomney elected. He simply has given up dealing with what`s best for the\n\nAmerican people.\n\nSHARPTON: Can you fight them? Can something be done to stop this?\n\nMCDERMOTT: We`ll keep talking about it, and let the people - the people\n\nwill make the decision ultimately. I trust the American people to look at\n\nthis and say why is he creating chaos again this year, the same as he did\n\nlast year?\n\nYou know, the definition of mental illness is doing the same thing over and\n\nover and expecting a different result. He expects he is going to get some\n\ndifferent result this time, and he is not. He is going to have chaos.\n\nSHARPTON: Congressman Jim McDermott, thanks for your time tonight.\n\nMCDERMOTT: You`re welcome.\n\nSHARPTON: Ahead, Sarah Palin has been a little quiet recently, but what\n\nshe is doing behind the scenes has her party on alert.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSHARPTON: Welcome back to \"Politics Nation.\"\n\nMitt Romney loves a lot of things. He loves his money. He loves his\n\nfamily, and he loves his presidents.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROMNEY: Bill Clinton announced that the era of big government was over.\n\nEven Jimmy Carter would have given that order.\n\nRonald Reagan`s famous word --\n\nOne of Missouri`s greatest sons Harry Truman --.\n\nThat we have since Hoover.\n\nAbraham Lincoln --\n\nTeddy Roosevelt --\n\nDwight Eisenhower --\n\nJohn Adams, JFK and FDR, they even link --\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Yes, the great LBJ, and don`t forget Harry Truman. You give him\n\nhair, Harry. He even got John Adams in there. But, he just can`t seem to\n\nremember the guy who came before President Obama.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROMNEY: I find it incomprehensible that a president can come to office and\n\ncall his predecessor`s record irresponsible and unpatriotic. And then, do\n\nalmost nothing to fix it.\n\nYou see, he was very critical of his predecessor for the debts the\n\npredecessor put in place. He was very critical of his predecessor because\n\nthe predecessor put together $4 trillion of debt.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Predecessor -- his name is George W. Bush. Folks, isn`t that\n\nweird? Well, not so much. After all, Bush did have the highest\n\ndisapproval rating of any president in Gallup history, higher than Nixon.\n\nYes, that Nixon, the one who resigned in disgrace.\n\nWell, I guess that makes sense, he did get us into two wars that were not\n\npaid for. He left us with all of that massive debt because on the Bush tax\n\ncut, the same debt that Willard won`t stop talking about.\n\nBut let`s not feel bad for George W. Bush. This summer, he plans to\n\npublish a book, outlining strategies for economic growth. That`s right.\n\nComing soon, you too can soak in all of Bush`s economic knowledge. You can\n\nbuy the secrets to his economics strategy.\n\nI wonder if Willard will buy the book.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAL SHARPTON, HOST, MSNBC LIVE: Welcome back to POLITICS NATION, we have a\n\nlot of balls in the air today when it comes to politics, we`re looking at\n\nthe likeability and endorsements, and even the aliens. That`s right,\n\naliens.\n\nJoining me now to go through it all, is Jamal Simmons, democratic\n\nstrategist and national democratic editor for GoVote.com. And Maria Teresa\n\nKumar, executive director of Voto Latino and an MSNBC contributor. Thanks\n\nfor joining me tonight.\n\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR, VOTO LATINO: Thank you for having me, Reverend.\n\nJAMAL SIMMONS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me.\n\nSHARPTON: Let`s get started with our first topic. Voting for Mr.\n\nPopularity. How much will likeability matter in deciding the election?\n\nPresident Obama showed off his ability to connect yesterday on \"The View,\"\n\ntaking a pop culture quiz from Joy Behar.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOY BEHAR, HOST, \"THE VIEW\": Let`s see what you have been reading.\n\nNumber one, which Kardashian was married for only 72 days?\n\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: Now, it would be Kim.\n\nBEHAR: Very good.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOK. OK. Now, this one you may not know. I`m hoping that you don`t\n\nas a matter of fact. What`s the controversial sex book that`s on million\n\nof women`s bedside tables.\n\nOBAMA: I don`t know that one.\n\nBEHAR: Good, OK, next.\n\nOBAMA: But I`ll ask Michelle when I get home.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: A new Gallup poll shows the President has a two to one\n\nmargin over Mitt Romney when it comes to likability. But Jamal, does that\n\nmatter or will it just bow down to the economy and jobs? I mean, we`ve\n\nseen it. Clinton was more likeable than his opponent and Dole. And Bush\n\nseems to be more likable than Kerry. Does this really matter or will it\n\ncome down to the economy and jobs?\n\nSIMMONS: You know, Reverend. It also helps when the President has\n\nsomebody like Michelle Obama that he can drop in the mix because she`s more\n\npowerful than all of them. But, you know, likeability is important. But\n\nreally the issue is about trust. Likeability is a part of that. People\n\nwant to know that the President is sitting in a room with nobody else\n\naround watching them. He`s going to make a decision for their families\n\nthat they can trust what that decision is going to be. And the reason why\n\nBush was able to beat Kerry was because people at the end were not quite\n\nsure what John Kerry was going to do. That was the flip-flop thing. And\n\nwe`re seeing that right now with our current republican nominee because\n\npeople just don`t have a bid on this guy. They don`t know where it is and\n\nwants to do.\n\nSHARPTON: So, do you think the beer test is really over estimated in\n\nterms of how voters will react Teresa, or is it about as Jamal says, trust,\n\nor is it about the economy and jobs.\n\nKUMAR: Well, I think it`s definitely likeability. I think you do\n\nwant to pass the beer test. And I say that because when you start talking\n\nabout presidents and whether pop culture matters at all, what you want is a\n\npresident that also understands your values. Something that always comes\n\nto mind is when George senior went into the super market and didn`t know\n\nwhat a scanner was. What is that meant, that basically signal to voters\n\nthat he didn`t understand basic issues that voters were actually\n\nencountering. So, the more that Obama could play into the pop-culture in\n\nthe accessibility and the more Mitt keeps up his guard, it is actually a\n\nwin for Obama. And the Obama campaign, what I would actually encourage\n\nthem to do is to continue basically playing up Mitt Romney as a tycoon who\n\nis simply out of touch and just use a lot of his words against him.\n\nBecause right now, Mitt is having a hard time identifying with everyday\n\nfolks.\n\nSHARPTON: All right. Let`s go to the next topic. The Godfather\n\nmakes an endorsement that Mitt Romney can`t refuse. Remember Herman Cain,\n\nwe remember Cain mostly for his singing and other notable phrases during\n\nthe campaign.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHERMAN CAIN (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Imagine there`s no\n\npizza.\n\nWhen they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-stan-stan,\n\nI`m going to say, you know, I don`t know.\n\nFirst of all, 9- 9-9.\n\nWe`re putting in 9-9-9.\n\nNine-nine-nine.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Now today, Cain attended a Tea Party conference in\n\nWashington and finally publicly joined team Romney.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHERMAN: Today, I want to formally endorse Governor Mitt Romney for\n\npresident of the United States of America. My endorsement evolved.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: And it sure has evolved. Back in January, Cain made his\n\nfirst endorsement throwing his support to quote, \"the people.\" A week\n\nlater he endorsed Newt Gingrich. Now he settled on Willard. Maria, I wish\n\nhe would sing it. First, I was the people, then -- I mean, it would be\n\nbetter. But anyway, Maria, is this what party unity looks like?\n\nKUMAR: I don`t know. I mean, first -- her citizenship. You have\n\nnewly basically talks about moon colonies, and then you have Herman Cain\n\nwith all his -- endorsing Mitt Romney. I don`t know if he wants, if he\n\nwants these endorsements in the first place. I think if anything, it\n\ndemonstrates that Mitt Romney is the presidential nominee for the\n\nRepublican Party because they rejected everybody else in the game. And\n\nwhat Mitt Romney really needs to do is figure out, how does he coalesce the\n\nTea Party who he doesn`t have as a base? And a lot of the other GOP come\n\nwith a convention. And what`s happening is that, because the Tea Party is\n\ngoing to vive for a voice at the convention, he might unify the Republican\n\nParty way too late for him and that`s a danger that he definitely has.\n\nSHARPTON: Well, Jamal, is the message unity, because I don`t know if\n\nany of these guys really bring a lot of votes with them at this point.\n\nSIMMONS: Well, the message has got to be unity. And Rev, I know I`m\n\ngoing to my class reunion down in Warehouse (ph) this weekend, speak at the\n\nBaccalaureate Service. So, I have to be a little bit careful because we\n\nprobably will see Mr. Herman Cain down there this weekend, but I think his\n\nendorsement has about as much weight as a thin crust pizza, I don`t think\n\nit matters very much at all in this campaign.\n\nSHARPTON: For the last topic, let`s go to space now. Let`s go to\n\nour last topic in outer space, what about the aliens, that`s what Will\n\nSmith`s son Jaden asked the President when they visited the White House\n\nrecently. Smith talked about it on a British radio show.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILL SMITH, ACTOR: The night before Jada had said to me, dad, I got\n\nto ask the President about the aliens. You know, I was like, dude, no, no,\n\nit`s not cool. Jada says, excuse me, Mr. President -- and Barack Obama\n\nsays, don`t tell me in perfect form like this is why he is the President,\n\nhe stopped and looked at Jada and said, the aliens, right? And he said,\n\nOK, I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of extraterrestrials but I\n\ncan tell you, if there had been a top secret meeting and if there would\n\nhave had would been a discussion it, it would have taken place in this\n\nroom.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: Jamal, if you were a little kid, would you ask the\n\nPresident about aliens?\n\nSIMMONS: Absolutely. Absolutely. What other chance do you have to\n\nsignify the President of the United States and ask him one of the most\n\nburning questions Americans want to know, are there aliens?\n\nSHARPTON: But Maria-Teresa, the real answer is how did the President\n\nknow what he was going to ask. Maybe aliens talked to the President and\n\nthe President didn`t deny it? What is that mean?\n\nKUMAR: I think that he and the aliens and maybe his kids are very\n\nattuned to what young people want and what to hear. And the fact that he\n\nwas had so much fun with Will`s son and would able to communicate say, hey,\n\nyou know, what? It`s kind of like there might be a center or not, but he\n\ndoesn`t ruin the dream by being so direct, but just keeping that kind of\n\nwindow of a cloud over the issue, I think that makes it fun.\n\nSHARPTON: That`s why I like having you on, you go right back to where\n\nwe started, likeability. Jamal Simmons, Maria Teresa Kumar, thank you both\n\nfor your time tonight.\n\nKUMAR: Thank you so much, Reverend.\n\nSIMMONS: Thank you.\n\nSHARPTON: Ahead, Sarah Palin`s been a little quiet recently. But\n\nwhat she has been doing behind the scenes has her party on alert, that`s\n\nnext.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSHARPTON: Still ahead he marched for justice with Dr. King, and more\n\nthan 50 years later he is still on the front lines of the civil rights\n\nmovement, my conversation with Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery, ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSHARPTON: We`re back on POLITICS NATION with a simple question. Who\n\nactually runs the Republican Party? This is actually a serious question.\n\nI know that Mitt Romney is going to be the nominee, and I know that John\n\nBoehner is the speaker, but who actually has the power? Could it be the\n\nMama Grizzly? Last night Sarah Palin`s pick for the Nebraska Senate\n\nprimary, a total long shot candidate beat GOP candidate backed by the -- of\n\nRick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, and Jim DeMint. Palin and a last minute\n\nflood of outside money gave a win to a dark horse candidate, and it`s not\n\nPalin`s only victory this season. Her pick in Indiana`s GOP Senate primary\n\nmanage to oust the sixth term republican incumbent. Despite the backing of\n\nGOP heavy hitters like Mitch Daniels and John McCain and Harley Barbour.\n\nAgain, Palin`s candidate beat the establishment. Palin may not be running\n\nfor president, but she is still picking winners and losers. And it is\n\nexactly what she said she would do when she decided not to run.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSARAH PALIN (R), FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: I believe I can be an\n\neffective voice in a real decisive role in helping get true public servants\n\nelected to office, not just in the President seat, but we have 33 Senate\n\nseats coming up. You don`t need a title to make a difference in this\n\ncountry.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: So, she`s wielding power by avoiding actually\n\nresponsibilities. Maybe that`s what she wanted all along.\n\nJoining me now is Dana Milbank, columnist for The Washington Post.\n\nThanks for joining me tonight.\n\nDANA MILBANK, THE WASHINGTON POST: Good evening, Reverend.\n\nSHARPTON: Dana, is Sarah Palin still a force to be reckoned within\n\nthe Republican Party?\n\nMILBANK: Well, she is a forth to be reckoned with in Reverend in the\n\nTea Party which he has basically taken over at the Republican Party. So, I\n\nthink that`s a fair thing to say. Particularly in states like Nebraska.\n\nYou have to realize you`re dealing with a very small slice of the elector\n\nrate in these republican primaries. But she was very clever about this.\n\nShe saw this candidate rising, came in there at the last minute, pushed her\n\nover the top, and now she is getting josanas from Al Sharpton.\n\nSHARPTON: Well, she`s getting recognition, I`m a little more careful\n\nwith my josanas. But let me say this. You`re right about the Tea Party\n\nangle, because in 2010, her endorsement skewed towards anti-establishment\n\ntypes. She backed 4 1 Tea Party Republicans but only 23 establishment\n\nRepublicans. So clearly, they have to be concerned about her with the Tea\n\nParty. But at the same time, as a power player, she is still very\n\nunpopular nationally. Charts show that she started out in 2008 with a\n\ndecent favorability number. She saw a big drop leading up to a 2008\n\nelection, and steadily watched her un-favorability rise and favorability\n\ndrop. The most recent polls put at 58 percent unfavorable, 28 percent\n\nfavorable. So, I guess the establishment has to deal with Tea Party\n\npopularity but in a general election has to worry about, she comes with a\n\ndouble edge.\n\nMILBANK: I think that`s right, Reverend. I mean, we still talk about\n\nrepublican establishment here in Washington. Basically, the Tea Party has\n\nhijacked the establishment in much of this country. The three candidates\n\nin this race were all Tea Party candidates at some extent even the ones who\n\nstayed office holders. So,really the establishment is the Tea Party in\n\nplaces like this. That`s where Sarah Palin is strong, and that`s why she\n\nis smart to say rather than run for elective office, she`s certainly not\n\ngoing to win on the national level with numbers like that, she can\n\ninfluence the party and shape it to her liking, then she has a whole lot of\n\ncredits built up with people in the Senate, people in the House with\n\nGovernors, and she can wield this power in a quiet way without, you know,\n\nhaving to rely on the majority support of the country.\n\nSHARPTON: But doesn`t she have a point though. I mean, she is\n\npicking winners and people do come out for her and she is helping with\n\nturnout, so you can`t just dismiss her.\n\nMILBANK: No, I think you would be crazy to dismiss her. I would\n\ndismiss her as a plausible national election candidate. But look, she is\n\nobviously a rainmaker within the party and within that move, and she is\n\nable to do what she wants, give speeches, be a commentator, and yet have\n\nthe trappings of power without having to answer for it. It`s really, you\n\nknow, it`s a pretty good work if you can get it.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, do you think she will work for Romney? Let me frame\n\nwhile I`m asking you that. At CPAC this year, she talked about how the\n\nrepublican nominee needed to be instinctively conservative in nature.\n\nWatch this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPALIN: Our nominee must be ready, strong, fortified, passionate, a\n\nfighter for American ideals. Our candidate must be someone who can\n\ninstinctively turn right to constitutional conservative principals. It`s\n\ntoo late in the game to teach it or to spin it at this point. It`s either\n\nthere or it isn`t.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: She`s listed a lot of qualities, and then she got Willard.\n\nWill she go for Romney? And is she a plus or minus for him if she does.\n\nMILBANK: Yes, Reverend. I wonder which candidate she was talking\n\nabout there. Look, I don`t think you`re going to expect the full Grizzly\n\nroar from Sarah Palin for Mitt Romney, but she wants to be in a position of\n\nlooking like, that she`s not dooming his candidacy. She doesn`t want to be\n\nblame for if he losses. But she also wants to be in a position say, I told\n\nyou so, we got to go with a more conservative next time. So, I don`t think\n\nyou`ll going to hear that kind of outride opposition but the support will\n\nbe rather top it.\n\nSHARPTON: Dana Milbank, thanks for your time tonight.\n\nMILBANK: Thanks, Reverend.\n\nSHARPTON: Coming up, nearly 50 years after marching with Dr. King,\n\nhe`s still on the front lines of the civil rights movement. I talked to\n\nthe Dean, Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery. Next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREV. DR. JOSEPH LOWERY, FOUNDER, SCLC: We ask you to help with --\n\nwhen blacks will not be asked to get back. When brown can stick around.\n\nWhen yellow will be mellow. When the red man can get ahead, man. And when\n\nwhite will embrace what is right. Let all of those who do justice and love\n\nmercy say amen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: That`s the Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery giving the\n\nbenediction at the historic inauguration of Barack Obama. Reverend Lowery\n\nis known as the dean of the civil rights movement, a founding member of the\n\nSouthern Christian leadership conference with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nReverend Dr. Lowery has led someone the most important events in civil\n\nrights history. The 1963 march on Washington, freedom rides challenging\n\nlaws across the Jim Crowe south, and the 1965 march for voting rights. And\n\nat 90 years old, he is still making an impact. This year, he joined us as\n\nwe kicked off from his rally. His annual event commemorating the voting\n\nrights march as we marched and reenacted the steps in Selma in Montgomery\n\nthis year, aimed at new voter suppression.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLOWERY: One of the things we cannot ever been in this crowd, and not\n\nunderstand, is holy ground. And we are here understanding that we are sent\n\non a holy mission.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHARPTON: And just this week, he and I joined other civil rights\n\nleaders in supporting brother President Obama`s stand on same sex marriage\n\nwith other brothers and sisters into the movement. Sixty years into the\n\nstruggle, he is still on the frontlines fighting for rights for the\n\npowerless. Giving a voice to the voiceless. And standing not for one, but\n\nfor all.\n\nJoining me now, Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery, it`s really an honor to\n\nhave you with us tonight, Dr. Lowery.\n\nLOWERY: It`s my honor, I`m happy to be here with you.\n\nSHARPTON: Why do you take a position supporting the president on this\n\nissue of same-sex marriage? Certainly you have every honor that one can\n\nhave, and yet you still step out in the forefront with issues that you know\n\nwill raise controversy and questions.\n\nLOWERY: Well, frankly, I couldn`t imagine myself denying a right to\n\nmy neighbor, my fellow citizen, that I enjoy myself. So, I don`t think you\n\ncan say we believe in equal rights for some people, but not for others. I\n\nthink that`s what they call an oxymoron. I think we have, if you believe\n\nin equal rights, you help grant them to all of the people. I`d simply\n\ncould not imagine myself saying to someone, I have a right, but I would not\n\npermit you to enjoy. I have to give it to everybody if I give it to\n\nanybody. That`s what Dr. King meant when he said, injustice anywhere\n\nbreeds injustice everywhere.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, you know many church leaders have taken a different\n\nposition on this issue, particularly even in the black church but you see\n\nthis as a civil rights issue.\n\nLOWERY: I do. I think basically it`s a civil rights issue. It`s\n\nunder the law that we have the right to affect a union, a covenant, a\n\nrelationship, a marriage if you will. Between two consenting people.\n\nSHARPTON: Now, we also are dealing with the threat of voter rights\n\nwith the voter ID laws. Every year, Mrs. Evelyn Lowery and you convene us\n\nat Edmund Pettus Bridge where you among other leaders lead the original 65\n\nmarch. This year, voter ID, we left your gathering and reenacted as you\n\ndone many times the walk from Selma to Montgomery around voter ID, voter\n\nsuppression. As one of those that walked shoulder to shoulder and shared\n\nthe board for Dr. King of SCLC, how do you view these threats to voter\n\nrights and view voter suppression in 2012?\n\nLOWERY: Well, I do want to inject politics here. But they became\n\npopular, these ID laws and regulations under the republican\n\nadministrations. And they insist on that raising the question about fraud,\n\nvoter fraud, and I guess their suggesting that people vote twice, or vote\n\nmore than once. And I tell you, I wish I could find some African-Americans\n\nwho are guilty of voting twice. We have a devil of a time every year,\n\nevery election getting them to vote once, let alone twice. So, I think the\n\nissue of voter fraud is a smoke screen to give the people who are in power\n\nincreased opportunity to remain there.\n\nSHARPTON: You walked hand in hand with Dr. Martin Luther King, did\n\nthe inaugural benediction for President Barack Obama. You received the\n\nhighest citizen`s award in this country, just celebrated your 90th\n\nbirthday, what is your proudest moment Dr. Lowery?\n\nLOWERY: Well, you mean other than my family, I guess joining Barack\n\nObama on the stage there in January of `09. It has to rate way up there\n\nwith anything that happened to me, in-spite of the fact that I can go back\n\nthrough the voting right marches through the time, that my wife was shot\n\ninto the car -- in Alabama when we were trying to defend a young retarded\n\nman who could not ride a bike and yet they were accusing him of driving a\n\ncar, and committing a rape. I could go back to -- people would have come\n\nto, I was passing through the airport and now saw last year. And a young\n\nman came up to me and said, hey, you don`t know me, but I`m in law school\n\nbecause of you and something you did that inspired me.\n\nThose are precious moments, but I think I have to say that it`s\n\nhardly anything that could surpass standing on the capitol steps and\n\nlooking across the mall and seeing the Lincoln memorial, and Washington\n\nmonument and being reminded that I was there to celebrate the inauguration\n\nof the first African-American president. I just -- it just seems like\n\nyesterday when 1965, and Martin asked me to take the demands of the Selma\n\nto Montgomery march to Governor Wallace. He seems just like yesterday that\n\nI was saying, hear our demands. We demand the right to vote, and then we\n\nraise a question. Will we ever see a black president? And most of us said\n\nthere will be one, but we probably won`t see it. And there I was on the\n\nsteps not only witnessing the inauguration of the first African-American\n\npresident, but participating in the process. So that it would be hard to\n\ntop that. It`s hard to top that.\n\nSHARPTON: Well, Dr. Joseph Lowery. We thank you for your time\n\ntonight. And God knows we thank you for your services down through the\n\nyears.\n\nLOWERY: Well, thank you for having me, and thank you for what you\n\ndo. I`m proud of your work that keeps this country abreast of the\n\nstruggles and the history of the movement, and the future that we still\n\nhave to build for ourselves and this country. And I`m hoping that God will\n\ncontinue to bless you as you carry on that work.\n\nSHARPTON: Thank you Dr. Lowery.\n\nThanks for watching. I`m Al Sharpton. \"HARDBALL\" starts right now.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
