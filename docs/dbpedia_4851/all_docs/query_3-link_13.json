        "text": "Candidates may have their name placed on the general election ballot as an independent candidate if they are not affiliated with a political party. (Section 1.005(9), Texas Election Code). If you vote in a party’s primary elections or participate in a party’s conventions, you thereby affiliate with the party. (Sections 142.008, 162.003, 162.007, Texas Election Code).\n\nTo file as an independent candidate, candidates must follow a two-part process. A candidate MUST:\n\nFile a Declaration of Intent to Run as an Independent Candidate between November 13, 2021 and 6:00 p.m. on December 13, 2021 with the county judge (county or precinct offices) or the Secretary of State (district and state offices) (Sections 142.002(b)(2), 142.005, Texas Election Code). This Declaration of Intent to Run as an Independent Candidate is mandatory. If you do not file a declaration during the applicable filing period, your subsequent candidate application will be rejected.\n\nFile a candidate application along with a supporting nominating petition . The application, along with petition, must be filed by 5:00 p.m. on June 23, 2022, with the county judge (county or precinct offices) or the Secretary of State (district and state offices). (Sections 142.005, 142.006,Texas Election Code).\n\nDetails on Nominating Petition: After the primary elections (or after the primary runoff election, if the office you are seeking is involved in a primary runoff election), you must collect signatures from registered voters of the territory who support your candidacy. (Section 142.009, Texas Election Code).\n\nThe signers of your petition must be registered voters of the territory from which the office sought is elected who have not participated in the general primary election or the runoff primary election of a party that has nominated, at either election, a candidate for the office you seek. (Section 142.009, Texas Election Code).\n\nSee our FAQs on Party Affiliation and Candidacy for more details about how primary voting or candidacy affects (or does not affect) candidacy in the general election.\n\nContact the Secretary of State’s office concerning the number of signatures required.\n\nIndependent (Nonpartisan) Candidate Public Office Sought in 2022 File Declaration of Intent and Application with Nominating Petition Sec of State County Judge % Signatures a Maximum Number of Signature b United States Representative x - 5% 500 Governor x - 1% - Lieutenant Governor x - 1% - Attorney General x - 1% - Comptroller of Public Accounts x - 1% - Commissioner of General Land Office x - 1% - Commissioner of Agriculture x - 1% - Railroad Commissioner x - 1% - Justice, Supreme Court x - 1% - Judge, Court of Criminal Appeals x - 1% - State Senator x - 5% 500 State Representative x - 5% 500 Member, State Board of Education x - 5% 500 Chief Justice and Justice, Court of Appeals x - 5% 500 District Judge x - 5% 500 Criminal District Judge x - 5% 500 Family District Judge x - 5% 500 District Attorney x - 5% 500 Criminal District Attorney x - 5% 500 County Judge - x 5% 500 Judge, County Court-at-Law - x 5% 500 Judge, County Criminal Court - x 5% 500 Judge, County Probate Court - x 5% 500 County Attorney - x 5% 500 Sheriff - x 5% 500 Tax Assessor-Collector - x 5% 500 District Clerk - x 5% 500 District & County Clerk - x 5% 500 County Clerk - x 5% 500 County Treasurer - x 5% 500 County Surveyor - x 5% 500 County Commissioner - x 5% 500 Justice of the Peace - x 5% 500 Constable - x 5% 500 Source: Texas Election Code Section §§142.002, 142.005 §142.007"
