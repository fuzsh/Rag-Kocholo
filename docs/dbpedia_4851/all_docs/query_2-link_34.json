The following comments point out the more significant developments noted during the current period. Vii; 3TINCS a. Labor established. Whether or not these latter departments will be founded-at \"constituent conferences\" or in a more infernal fashion is not kern.,rn at present. The importance, however, of reporting on \"constituent conferences\" si:-:ilar t^ those hold during the current period, is emphasized; The new international trade departments may play a major role in the organization and support of international strike movements directed against the Wostorn economy. It is apparent that emphasis has been placed by the Communist Parties on a more efficient international coordination of their auxiliary organizations in the labor union field. The 10th Congress of Soviet Trade Unions (see S-Morro 453) was heavily attended by foreign delo ate\"s. The Trade Union Congress in Warsaw (1-5 Juno 1949) furnished another occasion for informal discussions, and the Second World Congress of the ',?*PU, preceded by a meeting of the ^fl I Executive 'Committoe (Milan, June 19+9), assembled Communist labor leaders from all parts of the world. The emphasis on coordination of Communist dominated labor unions, however, is illustrated chiefly by the program launched by WFTU during the current period, involving the establishment of international trade departments of the ddFTU. These trade departments are to be orgn ized on a functional basis embracing national unions in related industries which may be affiliated with international labor organizations hostile to the now completely Soviet-Communist controlled WFTU. Several such international trade departments were created at constitutent conferences held during the current period, viz., Fur and Leather Workers; Textile Workers; Metal Workers; Wood, Building, and Construction Workers; Miners; Seamen and Harbor Workers, and T.achers (see Meeting section). By the end of the year, departments for Petroleum, Transport (excluding maritime workers), Farming and Forest, Food, Post and Telegraph, Radio and Chemical Industries are to be The orgeo.iz^tional effectiveness of the international nea.co campaign appeared to decline. jn X11--Union Conference of the Partisans if Ponce (also referred to as \"Congress of the Friends of the Soviet Union\") was hold in Moscow in August 1949, and several foreign delegates attended. No ether international meeting of significance was held. 7fforts to convene the long postponed Pence Congress for Latin America were directed toward Mexico City where a Continental Congress finally came off in September 1949 without appreciable propaganda effects, c. National Congresse,s.and.Conferances The 9th National Congress of OP Czechoslovakia (Prague, May 1949) was the most important Party affair during the period covered. It was distinguished by the presence of G. ILKOV, member of the Politburo/CPSU; SUSLOV, member of the Secretariat/CPSU, and P. YUDIN, presumably still chief editor of the Cominform Journal. Unconfirmed reports claimed that a Cominform meeting was held at the occasion of the Congress but no substantiating evidence was obtainable. In its overt pronouncements, the Congress seemed to be less concerned with-matters affecting the international Communist movement than with the internal affairs of CP Czechoslovakia. Several Congresses were held in Latin America (Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia), but their international significance appeared to be reduced furnishing an Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000100260002-0 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000100260002-0 occasion to bring together a few Latin American leaders -- there were no delegates froi_ other continents. There are no indications at present that CPSU is ready to convene its long overdue 19th Party Congress. It is aLmsir that OPSU, a stickler for \"doiocratic contralisL1 when it comes to foreign Parties, disregards Party democracy at horieo C. Travel to Prague Prague continued to be the destination point for \"unexplained\" trips. fia.rin- the current period, such trios -)ririnated particularly in Belgium and Den ark. d. Coz-inforu, Meetings Several Coriinform meetings were rtiiored but none are believed to have been held. TRAVEL HOV;cMMM .dTS The volume of individual movements increased considerably during the current period.. One thousand one hundred forty-one (1l41) items were recorded as compared with six hundred fifty-seven (657) items in the last report (S-iieno p53). However, this increase concerns overt trnvol only, anc. illustrates aeroly amore extensive representation of various Parties at interne aonal meetings. (Sao, for instance, the travel of delegates from the USSR to the various constituent conferences cf the ?a1I\"?U trade doparti,onts). a. Travel to the USSR The influx of forei m Communists into the USSR decreased. The May Day Celebrations, the Pushkin Anniversary, (June 1949), and the Moscow Peace Congress (magus: 1949) furnished the chief occasions for foreign delegates to visit the USSR overtly. However, the number of foreign visitors was comparatively small, b, oviot Delegates to Nat,anal Congresses Abroad The presence of id. A. SUSLOV at the 9th Congress of CP Czechoslovakia further supports the observation -lade in S-Mono #53 to the effect that SUSLOV, a i-;ember of the Secretariat /CPSU, may specialize in the direction of foreign Parties.
