        "text": "This article focuses on the appeal that writing and authorship hold for Kurdish women singers in contemporary Turkey. It argues that authorship has come to the fore as an object of aspiration at a moment when a history of political silencing intersects with a more recent commodification of Kurdish culture. In this context, authorship constitutes an avenue for Kurdish women to insert themselves into struggles for political rights, discourses of history writing, and an emerging cultural market. Yet, as the analysis shows, becoming an author centrally relies on gaining access to means that allow materially inscribing voices and making them durable. Authorship therefore needs to be recognized as a fragile achievement, especially for subaltern authors, whose position is marked by restricted access to inscriptive means. Tracing Kurdish women's attempts at making their voices, quite literally, matter, the article contributes to our understanding of the politics of voice in the contemporary world.\n\nStudies on female playwrights and female dramatis personae, mostly from the feminine point of view, have appeared either in whole books or in papers during the last twenty years, following the arousing of interest by so many historical, sociological, psychological, semiological or philological works 1 . Focusing on modern Greek drama, especially the postWar and contemporary, besides the occasional comments of performance critique, there have been some general assessments of the female image in the work of (the most prominent) contemporary Greek playwrights either of both sexes 2 or of women playwrights especially 3 . All to a varying extend have pronounced on the subject that the female image in modern Greek drama lags behind the historical/social evolution and is for the greatest part traditional, in presenting female characters as „the second sex‟. Patsalides, analyzing the work of several women playwrights, draws attention to the fact that the post-War female voices were all invo...\n\nAs Turkey struggles to define itself both at the international level and within the confines of its own borders, its women strive to negotiate an identity for the self in a continually changing homeland. Contemporary short stories such as Esmahan Aykol’s Bayan Naciye House, Muge Iplikci’s A Question and Mine Sogut’s Why I Killed Myself in Istanbul narrate the lives of women repetitively coerced to construct their selves within the confines of Islam, secularism and patriarchal tradition. Dismayed with Istanbul, they are often unable to protect their bodies, their honor and their rights to live their lives as they please. Uncertain with the roles that they may be allowed to play in the construction of the nation state, the female characters in these stories realize that owing to the complex national identity of their westernized/modernized Islamic Turkey it is not possible to ascribe to any single definition of the self. Yet attempts to embrace multiple identities prove challenging as the dominant social and political structures require these women to adopt modernity in theory only. Seen as transgressors, these women are often lonely. This paper examines the challenges, anxiety, dilemma, fear, sexual frustration, despair and lack of recognition suffered by Turkish women through the various rhetorical devices (such as anaphoras, rhetorical questions, dialogues between Istanbul—usually portrayed as a male lover—and the female narrator, uncertain endings, myth and fantasy) used by the different writers of these stories.\n\nFor a range of reasons, there has been a tendency to preach a dearth of interest in the ways writers assert their authorship, constructing individual and collective writerly identities to voice their authorial intentions. While some theoreticians and philosophers, evoking the ghost of biographical positivism, promoted anti-authorialism, postmodernity was immersed in intertextual studies. Though the announced death of the author assumed a significance matching the earlier death of God, the author returns as \"writer,\" scriptor or \"function\" in the writing of Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, as the process of becoming (Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari) or as a performative concept (Gérard Genette, Erika Fischer-Lichte). The aim of the article is to examine a narrow selection of writing authored and co-authored by three women playwrights-Deborah Levy, Djanet Sears and Tanika Gupta-who set out to speak on why they write, aiming in that way to articulate their authorship in essays, notes and conversations which have the status of diverse paratextual forms. The article starts by exploring the relevance of discussions on authorship as well as the implications of institutional policies in regard to women writing for the theatre. Further on, on a tropological level, the article analyses the figurative rendering of self-reflection as a passage from roots to routes, from a concept of fixed identity to mobile, performative concepts converging on epistemological alertness and openness to recognising the ontology of writerly identity as becoming."
