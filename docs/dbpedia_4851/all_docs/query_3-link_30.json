        "text": "Don’t miss: UPSC Prelims Paper Analysis 2024\n\nMany people in India or the world do not believe or support the agendas and manifesto of a certain political party. Also, many individuals feel burdened working under a certain party. For example, the Indian constitution has given rights to such people to stand as independent candidates and not to be affiliated with any party and to be eligible for the election ticket from the election commissioner. To get an idea of who an independent candidate is, we need to know some facts about independent candidates, including tons of knowledge about independent candidates.\n\nFacts about independent candidates definition\n\nTo understand facts about independent candidates definitions, we need to understand the formal definition, meaning what it states about independent candidates in elections. For example, a person who is eligible to be on the general ballot election and is not currently a member or has an affiliation with any political party that has been granted or has applied for the general ballot status is an independent candidate. Depending on their beliefs and agendas, they may or may not support the bills and reforms presented by the other ruling party in the Lok sabha. That is the foremost ethical fact of how independent candidates are different from candidates of political parties.\n\nTo state facts about independent candidates definition, we can say that even if the definition states that the person who is an independent candidate is not affiliated or supported by any political party, they can still vote in favour of their policies if elected as their representatives in Lok sabha by the people of their constituency, if the bill presented or reform benefit their people.\n\nSome other facts about independent candidates definition are that an elected independent candidate cannot be the prime minister or minister of India unless he forms a political party or joins a political party and gets the required majority in the Lok Sabha election.\n\nConstitutional rights for independent candidates in the election\n\nThe facts about independent candidates’ definitions will always change and get enhanced following their definition stated in the constitution of India. If they get more beneficial or disadvantageous for the independent candidate, then there will be a misbalance in the justice and equality of the country.\n\nConstitutional rights and laws are not the ground to know how independent candidates are different from candidates of political parties. In the Indian constitution, both candidates have been given equal rights and liberty to contest and campaign for the election.\n\nEligibility criteria for independent candidates in elections in India\n\nThe Indian constitution has some eligibility criteria established for the independent candidates standing in the general election of either Rajya Sabha or Lok sabha. The person who is an independent candidate or aspires to stand as one must meet the same criteria as any other candidates, just not to be directly affiliated with any other political party. Some of the common criteria are:\n\nHaving age above 25 years with at least ten candidates from the same constituency who can sign the nomination papers for the person aspiring to stand as an independent candidate.\n\nThe person (independent candidate) should only be related to an unrecognized political party.\n\nHow are Independent candidates different from candidates of political parties?\n\nThere are no major differences between the candidates if we discuss eligibility criteria. Still, sometimes candidates from the political party have the upper hand in getting the nomination from the recognized party because they only have to take one proposer with them at the time of the nomination. In contrast, independent candidates are obliged to take ten persons who can sign the nomination papers for them so that the election commission can ensure that the person standing will have significance in the election.\n\nThe law commission of India has also not been kind to the independent candidates in the past. They have started a debate on the fact that independent candidates stand to confuse the constituency’s people and do not play any major role in inequality, and are also not serious about the election. In India, the winning percentage for independent candidates has continuously decreased while the number of contestants is still increasing.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndependent candidates are as important to the nation’s equality as the candidates of the political party because they provide a sense of hope to the country’s sector of voters. They think that no political party in their constituency is worth their time, trust, and votes. The person who has won an election as an independent candidate is free from any burden and pressure while working. Within was no forcing on the h, and a politician who has a positive vision for the betterment of their people can work easily and with great determination and responsibility."
