Registered voters can use the Voter Search to confirm their party affiliation. Individuals that have not registered to vote yet can learn how to do so at How to Register.\n\nDo you wish to change your party affiliation? The civilian voter registration deadline (25 days before Election Day) is also the deadline for voters to change their party affiliation or unaffiliated status for the next election. Learn how to do so at Updating Registration.\n\n7 Political Parties\n\nNorth Carolina recognizes seven political parties: The Constitution Party, the Democratic Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the No Labels Party, the Republican Party, and the We The People Party. A voter may choose one political party or can decide not to register with a political party. If a voter does not register with a political party, the voter will be registered as unaffiliated.\n\nIn a partisan primary, voters affiliated with a political party may only vote their party’s ballot and may not vote in another party’s primary. For example, a registered Republican may only vote in the Republican Party primary. This remains true even if the party you are affiliated with does not have a primary.\n\nUnaffiliated voters may choose any one political party’s ballot or a nonpartisan ballot (if available) in a primary election.\n\nIn a general election, voters may vote for the candidate(s) of their choice, regardless of party. North Carolina does not allow straight-ticket voting (also called straight-party voting)."
