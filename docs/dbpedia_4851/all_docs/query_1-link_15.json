        "text": "Reid Sigmon joined the Oklahoma State athletic department in the role of Deputy Athletic Director in 2021.\n\nDuring his career, he has been a key figure in the planning of three Super Bowls and an NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Final Four, has served as Chief Financial Officer of the College Football Playoff and has worked with such organizations as the Cleveland Browns and Kansas State.\n\nSigmon comes to OSU following a four-year run as Deputy Athletic Director for Finance and Operations/Chief Operating officer at the University of Tennessee. While in Knoxville, he served as sport administrator for men's basketball, managed the day-to-day operations of the department, oversaw internal and external operations and was liaison to the university's Office of the General Counsel and Senior Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance. He took on the additional responsibility of serving as a member of the Southeastern Conference's Ticket Committee as well as the league's Working Group on Event Security.\n\n\"I am excited by the opportunity to work at Oklahoma State with Chad Weiberg and continue to build on the championship history of OSU Athletics,\" Sigmon said. \"I look forward to serving the student-athletes, staff and fans. Thank you to John Currie, Phillip Fulmer and Danny White for the opportunity to work at the University of Tennessee for the last four years.\"\n\nSigmon has a significant background in football with high-level administrative experience as Executive Director of the Tampa Bay Super Bowl XLIII Host Committee (2007-09), Vice President of Operations of the Jacksonville Super Bowl XXXIX Host Committee (2003-05) and Director of Operations of the Tampa Bay Super Bowl XXXV Task Force (1999-01).\n\nAn original staff member of the College Football Playoff, Sigmon was responsible for all financial, administrative and revenue aspects of the CFP. He also provided support to the selection committee. During his time as a leader with the College Football Playoff, it was named the Sports Event of the Year by the Sports Business Journal in 2015. He was also named by Al.com as one of the \"SEC's behind-the-scenes power players you need to know\".\n\nHe also worked from 2005-07 as the Director of Stadium Development and Event Operations for the NFL's Cleveland Browns, where he was responsible for the management, supervision and coordination of all the organization's event logistics and stadium construction projects. He managed all capital projects at Cleveland Browns Stadium, special events such as draft-day parties and training camp and also assisted with overall stadium operations and gameday management.\n\nPrior to his three Super Bowl appointments, Sigmon was the Assistant Director for the Tampa Bay Organizing Committee for the 1999 NCAA Division I Men's Final Four in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nSigmon has previous experience in the Big 12, as he worked at K-State from 2009-13, ultimately rising to the post of Senior Associate AD and COO. While in Manhattan, he managed the day-to-day operations of the Wildcats' athletic department, including finance and contractual and legal matters. Sigmon helped transform K-State Athletics from a department with a forecasted $2 million operating deficit in 2009 to one eventually recognized by ESPN, USA TODAY and other outlets as a model of intercollegiate fiscal responsibility, while also laying the groundwork for what grew to $210 million in athletic facility improvements, all privately funded without state or university dollars.\n\nHe also was the K-State athletics liaison to the university counsel and vice president for administration and finance offices. And he worked closely with the Wildcats football program and legendary Hall of Fame Coach Bill Snyder, earning a 2012 Big 12 football championship ring.\n\n\"I have known Reid Sigmon for over a decade and had the privilege of working with him at Kansas State,\" incoming OSU Athletic Director Chad Weiberg said. \"I have always been impressed with his intelligence, tremendous work ethic, high integrity and ability to build strong relationships. Reid is without a doubt one of the most talented administrators in all of college athletics and I couldn't be more pleased to have him join our team here at OSU. I look forward to our student-athletes, coaches, staff, and fans getting to know him,\"\n\nHis career in intercollegiate athletics administration began in 1996 at his alma mater of Wake Forest after the conclusion of his football playing career--during which he lettered as a placekicker and played for head coaches Bill Dooley and Jim Caldwell--as he landed a position as an operations and facilities assistant.\n\nActive in philanthropic initiatives, Sigmon stood for four years as a governance officer on the College Football Playoff Foundation, which serves as the CFP's charitable arm.\n\nA longtime NACDA member, Sigmon graduated magna cum laude with a degree in politics from Wake Forest in 1996, and he earned his MBA from Florida in 2003. At UF, he served as president of the MBA Association and was a Matherly Scholar.\n\nSigmon Year-by-Year\n\n1996-98 - Wake Forest, Operations and Facilities Assistant\n\n1998-99 - Tampa Bay Organizing Committee 1999 Men's Final Four, Assistant Director\n\n1999-01 - Tampa Bay Super Bowl XXXV Task Force, Director of Operations\n\n2003-05 - Jacksonville Super Bowl XXXIX Host Committee, Vice President of Operations\n\n2005-07 - Cleveland Browns, Director of Stadium Development and Event Operations\n\n2007-09 - Tampa Bay Super Bowl XLIII Host Committee, Executive Director\n\n2009-13 - Kansas State, Senior Associate AD/Chief Operating Officer\n\n2014-17 - College Football Playoff, Chief Financial Officer\n\n2017-21 - Tennessee, Deputy Athletics Director for Finance and Operations/Chief Operating Officer\n\n2021-pres. - Oklahoma State, Deputy Athletic Director"
