Protection more than one year prior to the general election should only be granted in extraordinary, case by case circumstances in consultation with the committee, based on threat assessment and other factors.\n\nCriteria have been established to assist the DHS Secretary and the advisory committee in their decision making (as of 2017).\n\nWhen determining whether a candidate for the Office of President or Vice President of the United States qualifies as a major candidate, the Secretary has broad discretion and may consider a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\nWhether the candidate has publicly announced his or her candidacy and has filed the appropriate documentation with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, and related laws;\n\nWhether the candidate is actively campaigning on a national basis for the office for which his or her candidacy has been announced, as demonstrated by operating a national campaign apparatus, regularly appearing at public events in multiple states, producing and publishing campaign advertisements, and other similar indicia of a campaign;\n\nA threat assessment conducted by the Secret Service of general or specific threats directed towards the candidate (for these purposes, “threats” should be defined as explicit threats of bodily harm to the candidate or indications of inappropriate behavior towards the candidate suggesting potential bodily harm);\n\nWhether, during and within an active and competitive major party primary, the most recent average of established national polls, as reflected by the Real Clear Politics National Average or similar mechanism, the candidate is polling at 15% or more for 30 consecutive days;\n\nWhether the candidate is the formal or de facto nominee of a major party for President or Vice President;\n\nWhether the candidate is an independent or third-party candidate for President polling at 20% or more of the Real Clear Politics National Average for 30 consecutive days;\n\nWhether the candidate is the Vice Presidential running mate of the above independent or third-party candidate.\n\nTitle 18 U.S.C.' 3056(a)(7) states that the U.S. Secret Service is also authorized to protect spouses of major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, as identified by the DHS Secretary, within 120 days of the general Presidential election. Some candidates have received protection earlier in the campaign pursuant to Presidential memoranda.\n\nWhat is the history of candidate/nominee protection?\n\nCandidate and nominee protection was expanded to include major candidates for President and Vice President in 1968:\n\nMajor candidates and their spouses began receiving protection after the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. PL-90-331 was passed June 6, 1968. (Language since adopted into 3056);\n\nPrior to this event, candidates and their families did not receive Secret Service protection;\n\nProtection of a candidate/nominee is designed to maintain the integrity of the democratic process and continuity of Government.\n\nMedia\n\nJune 4, 2024, DNC Press Conference\n\nCHICAGO – U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle met with Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling and public safety professionals from throughout…\n\nRead More\n\nJune 6, 2024, RNC Press Conference\n\nMILWAUKEE – On June 6, U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle met with public safety professionals from the FBI, Milwaukee Police Department, Milwaukee Fire Department…\n\nRead More\n\nJune 21, 2024, Republican National Convention Security Measures Press Conference\n\nWashington DC – Increased local security measures will be in place in the days leading up to, during and immediately following the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee July 15-18....\n\nRead More\n\nJuly 25, 2024, U.S. Secret Service Outlines 2024 Democratic National Convention Security Measures\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Increased local security measures will be in place around Chicago’s United Center and McCormick Place in the days leading up to, during and immediately following the 2024 Democratic National Convention…\n\nRead More"
