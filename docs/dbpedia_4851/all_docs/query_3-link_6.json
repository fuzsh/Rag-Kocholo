        "text": "Californians are independent and free-thinkers.\n\nIndependents treasure our personal freedom and Constitutional liberties.\n\nThe new American Independent Party connects positive, visionary and independent candidates with California voters. We all deserve to find inspiration at the ballot box.\n\nWe believe in electing leaders who can help foster a better tomorrow.\n\nThis requires breaking the old political mold left over from past generations.\n\nVoting independently rewards creativity and fresh ideas instead of politics-as-usual. This means evaluating ideas and electing independent candidates. Our votes should never be taken for granted.\n\nVoters crave variety. The AIP rejects a limited world with only two stale flavors to choose from on Election Day. The American Independent Party trusts you to think for yourself, and then vote your conscience.\n\nReal candidates discuss important issues with the People. They have honesty and integrity. Real candidates work hard to unite us. Real candidates need to earn your respect, not just assume they have your vote.\n\nIt’s time for California to declare independence from the antiquated two-party system.

We strive to reduce the use of force, thus increasing happiness, harmony, and prosperity for all.\n\nWe believe that the most peaceful, prosperous, socially fair, and tolerant society is one that solves its problems without government force. We believe that social woes like inaccessible healthcare, inadequate social justice, inadequate housing, economic instability, and racial disparity are caused and perpetuated by officials who would rather increase their power instead of solving problems.\n\nWe believe in freedom. For 50 years, the Libertarian Party has been at the forefront of advocating once radical issues like marijuana legalization, marriage equity, school choice, gun rights, transportation competition, and ending mandatory minimum sentences and asset forfeiture laws. We oppose foreign wars and want to bring our troops home from overseas.\n\nWe want to stop giving money and power to the same people who have caused the problems we face today.\n\nIt is time for a big change.

We should not have to sacrifice our health, our livelihoods, and our planet for billionaires’ profits. Tax the rich, whose wealth is created by workers, to pay for people’s needs.\n\nOur Goals:\n\nSocial justice & equality: Free universal health care for all. *Free education for everyone, preschool through university. *Full immigrant rights; no deportations. *End homelessness, housing for all. *Jobs or Income; labor rights for all. *End racism, LGBTQ and women’s oppression, and all discrimination. *Comprehensive services for disabled people.\n\nEnvironment: *Reverse Climate change. *Restore and protect the environment.\n\nJustice reform: *Abolish the death penalty. *Stop police abuse and prison torture.\n\nPeace: *No U.S. wars, sanctions, or coups. *No foreign bases.\n\nDemocracy: *Repeal California’s “top two” election law. *Implement proportional representation.\n\nWhile capitalism puts the wealthy first, we will continue to suffer war, police brutality, low wages, unsafe workplaces, and pollution. We advocate socialism: the ownership and democratic control of the economy by the people. By taking control of our industries and natural resources, we can make progress for the common good.\n\nRegister Peace and Freedom Party!\n\nPeace and Freedom Party\n\nP.O.

It has only made things worse. Homelessness and poverty are increasing. Taxes are too high. Houses cost too much, and crime rates are skyrocketing. Instead of helping, government has made things worse. Instead of fixing the problems, the party currently controlling Sacramento wants to raise your taxes even higher.\n\nRepublicans believe you deserve a break, and we’re fighting for you. You deserve a job with a paycheck that covers your housing costs, car payment, living expenses, and health insurance, with money left over for your future.\n\nRepublicans are fighting to rebuild California’s economy, for better public schools, and for a state that is affordable for everyone. Instead of political games, we’re committed to working with people from all walks of life to make a successful future for our children and grandchildren.\n\nEveryone is welcome in the California Republican Party. Your diversity is our strength. Please join us, and let’s make California better. Visit CAGOP.org to learn more.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party\n\n1001 K.
