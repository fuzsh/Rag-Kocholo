See N.C.G.S. § 163-278.6(53) and N.C.G.S. § 163-278.6(20).\n\nPolitical party committees, PACs, independent expenditure political committees, individuals, corporations, professional associations, labor unions and other business entities may make independent expenditures. So long as independent expenditures are in fact independent, and not coordinated with any candidate, there is no limit on how much an individual or entity may spend.\n\nPolitical party committees, PACs and independent expenditure political committees report independent expenditures on the committee’s regular disclosure reports. Other individuals and entities making independent expenditures with a value in excess of $100 in an election are also required to file disclosure reports. N.C.G.S. § 163-278.12(a). These individuals and entities are referred to as Independent Expenditure Filers.\n\nIndependent Expenditure Filers that support or oppose statewide candidates, legislative candidates, judicial candidates, or candidates for district attorney file disclosure reports with the State Board of Elections. Independent Expenditure Filers that support or oppose statewide ballot issues also file with the State Board.\n\nIndependent Expenditure Filers that support or oppose county or municipal candidates file disclosure reports with the county board of elections. Independent Expenditures Filers that support or oppose ballot issues contained within one county also file with the county board of elections.\n\nAn Independent Expenditure Filer must disclose expenditures within 30 days after independent expenditures exceed $100 or 10 days before an election the independent expenditures affect, whichever occurs earlier. N.C.G.S. § 163-278.12(d). After the initial disclosure report, the Independent Expenditure Filer must continue to file reports on the same schedule as political committees until the end of the election. 08 NCAC 21 .0102(f). The final report for a given election must cover the period through the day of the election.\n\nIn certain circumstances, donations made to Independent Expenditure Filers must also be disclosed. N.C.G.S. § 163-278.12(c). Donations must be disclosed if made to further the reported independent expenditure. A donation is made to further an independent expenditure if any of the following apply:\n\nThe donor designates, requests, or suggests that the donation be used for an independent expenditure or for multiple independent expenditures, and the filer agrees to use the donation for an independent expenditure.\n\nThe filer expressly solicited the donor for a donation for making or paying for an independent expenditure.\n\nThe donor and the filer engaged in substantial written or oral discussion regarding the donor’s making, donating, or paying for an independent expenditure.\n\nThe donor or the filer knew or had reason to know of the filer’s intent to make independent expenditures with the donation.

N.C.G.S. § 163-278.12(e).\n\nIndependent Expenditure Filers submit their 48 Hour Report using forms CRO-2210A, CRO-2210B, and CRO-2210C.
