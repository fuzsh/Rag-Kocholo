        "text": "In countries such as Britain, all candidates submit nominations on an individual basis. The rules for candidates nominated by political parties are no different from other candidates in the procedures they must follow. In some other countries, registration procedures for 'independents' differ from those for party nominees.\n\nFor example, in Australia, independent candidates and candidates nominated by unregistered political parties are not permitted to have a label or description appended to their names on the ballot forms. Also, they are not entitled to state financial aid towards their election expenses, see Registering Parties/Candidates for Elections.\n\nIn countries such as the United States, there are special barriers that independents and members of small parties must overcome before their names are included on the ballot. Such candidates are required to collect a large number of signatures to support their nominations. Candidates of the two established parties - the Republicans and the Democrats - are free from this task, see Signatures.\n\nIn countries with proportional representation (PR), special treatment is needed for independent candidates, depending on the form of PR. For example, the German additional member system of PR provides for half of the seats to be won in contests in single-member constituencies, and the other half to be allocated according to the proportional principle. It is therefore open to an independent candidate to contest the former category of seat. By contrast, it is not possible for an independent to win seats in the second category, unless he creates a list together with a large number of other candidates, who together stand a chance of overcoming the threshold of five percent of the national vote. This is the percentage required to gain any seats in the second, proportional category.\n\nLikewise, in Japan, independent candidates cannot stand for election in the PR districts in either the Lower or Upper House without party endorsement, for the ballot calls for the voter to write the name of a party, not a candidate.\n\nIn countries with a majoritarian electoral system, the law may prevent independent individuals from standing as candidates for elective office. This is the case in Tanzania, for example, where a political party must nominate candidates for the national Parliament. At the same time, there are stringent and restrictive laws relating to the registration of parties. The effect of this combination of regulations is to favour candidates of the ruling political party, which has held office ever since the country's independence from British rule. The ban on independent candidates handicaps challenges in specific electoral districts by individuals who are opposed to the government, and who may well be well-known and well-liked locally.\n\nDraft Only"
