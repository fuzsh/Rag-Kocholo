        "text": "Earth Day on Wednesday got everyone thinking about the environment and its issues, thanks to the Green Team. The afternoon started with the beautiful documentary ‘Home,’ showing the progression of the Earth’s life, up to and including human input – good and bad. At the same time Andrew and Outdoor Work ran a sustainable building workshop, sustained by homemade vegetable soup and brown rolls. Later there were two seminar sessions, each with four diverse and fascinating speakers. Maddy Harland gave us insight into the Sustainability Centre, as well as her magazine ‘Permaculture,’ while Katie Millward spoke about human/animal rights abuses all over the world, knowledge acquired through working as a journalist for EcoStorm and the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting. Beki Adam spoke about the dangers of Fracking and Adam Harper showed the links between politics/politicians and all of these environmental issues. These speakers made up the final panel for Jaw, and took questions from the whole school. Earth Day will hopefully become an annual tradition, and it is widely agreed that this was an excellent start.\n\nBy Tilly Driscoll-Smith, 6.1"
