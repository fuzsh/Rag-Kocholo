        "text": "What is an independent?\n\nAn independent is a member of the Australian Parliament who does not belong to a political party. An independent can be a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Independent senators represent their state or territory and independent members of the House represent an electorate. Independents sit on the seats that curve around at the end of the Senate and House. These seats are called the crossbench.\n\nWhat does an independent do?\n\nIndependents speak and vote on behalf of the people they represent like all members of parliament do. They do this by:\n\ndebating and voting on bills – proposed laws\n\ngiving speeches in Parliament\n\nworking on committees that look into important issues\n\nscrutinising – closely examining – the work of the government.\n\nAn independent can also introduce their own bill. These are called private member's or private senator's bills. Since bills cannot pass without the support of the majority, private bills usually do not become laws.\n\nVoting in the Parliament\n\nMembers in the House of Representatives.\n\nDPS Auspic\n\nDescription\n\nMembers working in the House of Representatives.\n\nCopyright information\n\nPermission should be sought from DPS AUSPIC for third-party or commercial uses of this image. To contact DPS AUSPIC email: auspic@aph.gov.au or phone: 02 6277 3342.\n\nMembers of parliamentary parties usually vote together to support or reject an idea in Parliament. Because independents do not belong to a political party, they can make up their own mind about whether to vote for or against an idea. Independents sometimes vote with the government and sometimes with the opposition on an issue. On some occasions, an independent may choose to abstain – choose not to vote.\n\nBalance of power\n\nThe government often does not have a majority in the Senate. Independent and minor party senators can have the balance of power – their vote can decide if a bill is passed or fails."
