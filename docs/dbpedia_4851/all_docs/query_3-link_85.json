        "text": "What is a Closed Primary?\n\nA closed primary is a type of primary election conducted to vote for the candidates who will run in the general election.\n\nWho Can Vote in a Closed Primary?\n\nIn partisan office contests in a primary election, a voter may only vote for the candidates of the party in which he or she is registered. That's why different ballot styles exist in a primary election. The voter's ballot style is tied to his or her party affiliation.\n\nVoters registered with no party affiliation (NPA) are not eligible to vote for partisan candidates in a primary election unless a Universal Primary Contest (UPC) occurs.\n\nAll registered voters regardless of party affiliation are entitled to vote on non-partisan candidates and issues.\n\nIn a General Election, all registered voters receive the same ballot regardless of their party affiliation and are eligible to vote for any candidate.\n\nWhat is a Universal Primary Contest (UPC)?\n\nA Universal Primary Contest (UPC) occurs if all candidates for an office have the same party affiliation and the winner will have no opposition in the general election. In a UPC, all qualified voters regardless of party affiliation may vote in the primary election for that office.\n\nHow to Change your Party Affiliation\n\nA voter can declare or change their party affiliation by submitting a Florida Voter Registration Application online, in person or by mail or by submitting a signed, written notice that includes the voter's date of birth or Florida voter registration number.\n\nInformation on Florida's major and minor political parties can be found on the Florida Division of Election's website.\n\nMail completed request to:\n\nMarion County Election Center\n\nPO Box 289\n\nOcala, FL 34478-0289\n\nDeadline to Change your Party Affiliation (Bookclosing)\n\nAll party changes for a primary election must be made by the registration deadline (bookclosing) which is 29 days before the election. If the request is made after the deadline, the change will not take effect until after the election. For a general election, a party change can be made at any time."
