        "text": "Danny Ocean is ready for another heist.\n\nGeorge Clooney revealed that there is “a great script” written for a brand-new installment in the “Ocean’s” franchise.\n\n“We have a really good script for another ‘Ocean’s’ now, so we may end up doing another one,” Clooney, 62, told Uproxx while promoting his latest film, “The Boys in the Boat,” on Wednesday.\n\n“It’s actually a great script,” Clooney added.\n\nThe new storyline is reminiscent of the 1979 comedy “Going in Style,” which starred George Burns and Art Carney as elderly bank robbers.\n\nBased on the 1960s Rat Pack film of the same name, the “Ocean’s” franchise began in 2001 with the release of “Ocean’s Eleven” starring Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia and several other high-profile celebrities.\n\nThe film grossed nearly $451 million at the box office and spawned two more films in 2004 and 2007, all directed by Steven Soderbergh.\n\nIn 2018, the franchise was revamped with “Ocean’s Eight,” starring Sandra Bullock as Danny’s (Clooney) sister, Debbie, who assembles an all-female heist team composed of Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Sarah Paulson, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nIt was announced in October that “Barbie” alums Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were tapped to lead a new film, which is reportedly set in Europe in the 1960s.\n\n“I can’t really say much,” producer Josey McNamara said to GamesRadar+. “But I think we’re just trying to do right by the franchise.”\n\nMcNamara added that he’s “excited for people to experience it when it’s ready.”\n\nClooney appeared to accidentally confirm that Robbie, 33, and Gosling, 43, were slated to play his character’s parents in the franchise’s next potential installment.\n\n“Yeah! Margot Robbie is my mother? I’ve always thought that,” the “Descendents” star said to People. “Ryan Gosling is my father. Now when you think about it, it makes sense. Truly.”\n\nThe LuckyChap Entertainment — Robbie’s production company — executive is also excited for the pair to reunite.\n\n“They’re wonderful together,” McNamara noted. “The more projects even outside of that we can have them do would be amazing.”\n\nAccording to McNamara, the “Ocean’s” film could launch more movies starring both actors.\n\nSince starring in the Mattel film — which grossed nearly $1.4 billion at the box office — Gosling and Robbie have received a tidal wave of praise.\n\nThe Greta Gerwig-directed “film”Barbie” swept the recent Golden Globe nominations with a total of nine nods and scored a whopping 18 Critics Choice nominations, breaking the previous record which was held by 2022’s “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and 2017’s “The Shape of Water” at 14.\n\nThere is currently no release date attached to the new “Ocean’s” film."
