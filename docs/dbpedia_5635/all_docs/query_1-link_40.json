        "text": "George Clooney's iconic character Danny Ocean could be coming back for one last job. The actor, who starred in the 2001 caper Ocean's Eleven along with its two sequels, is eager to make another movie in the series, and has already read a \"great script.\"\n\nA remake of the 1960 movie which starred Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, Ocean's Eleven followed a similar plot, which involved the titular Ocean gathering a crew of expert thieves to rob several Las Vegas casinos in a single night. Steven Soderbergh's version proved so popular, thanks in part to the chemistry and star power of its cast (Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon also played key roles) that it spawned two sequels: Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen.\n\nA spinoff entitled Ocean's Eight, which involved an all-female crew and a heist at the Met Gala, was released in 2018, starring Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean's sister, Debbie. In that movie, Danny is stated to be dead—but the franchise is so known for its twists and narrative curveballs that it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to reveal that he actually faked his death.\n\n\"We have a really good script for another Oceans now, so we may end up doing another one.,\" Clooney said in a recent interview while promoting his new movie The Boys in the Boat. \"It’s actually a great script,\" he continued, adding that the idea is \"kind of likeGoing In Style,\" referring to the 1979 comedy about a trio of senior citizens who embark on a heist to break up the monotony of retired life.\n\nClooney didn't say whether any of the original cast were up for a fourth film, and so a long wait is likely in store. In the meantime, however, a prequel is in the works: Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have reportedly signed on to play Danny Ocean's parents in an Old Hollywood-inspired heist romance set on the French Riviera."
