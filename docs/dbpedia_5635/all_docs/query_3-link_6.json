        "text": "Disney might still be best-known as the king of cartoons, but five or six decades ago, the studio was equally renowned for its feature-length live-action nature films, such as the Oscar-winning “Beaver Valley” and the wonderful “Perri,” the squirrel-adventure film that nabbed a Golden Bear in Berlin.\n\nDisney rebooted its nature-based documentary arm last year with the Disneynature release of the good-looking but under-whelming “Earth,” but all is forgiven with its newest entry, “Oceans,” which was shot over, in, and under the watery wilds of five seas.\n\nSure, there are plenty of opportunities to check out films about the ocean and its inhabitants on myriad cable stations. But I don’t care how big your home entertainment center is, nothing is going to take the place of a huge movie screen to capture the majesty that this film goes after and gets.\n\nFrom the first shot of cameras following a dinosaur-like marine iguana floating through the sea, to one of the last scenes, which gives a whole new meaning to the term “swimming with sharks,” this film is an awe-inspiring celebration of another world.\n\nWe meet creatures down there that are so alien to anything on land (and to most of the sea life we’re familiar with), this film could easily pass for science fiction.\n\nThere’s nothing to do but gawk in wonder at a glowing, pulsating bloom of jellyfish or a bright orange magic carpet-like blanket octopus. Most viewers will likely gasp or at least say “wow!” at the sight of the delicate leafy sea dragon or the hunting prowess of the mantis shrimp – one truly nasty crustacean.\n\nA big chunk of the film focuses on the fact that it’s a fish-eat-fish world down there. But it’s not much different when the cameras come up for air, fixing their lenses on hapless sea lions being gobbled down by great white sharks and Orcas, or on frigate birds going after newborn sea turtles, as they make a mad dash from the beach to the safety of the water.\n\nThere’s some entertaining and smartly written narration, delivered in a relaxed, casual manner by Pierce Brosnan. He might offer a bit of biographical information on a certain species of fish, address the variety of underwater life by noting that “down here it’s like nature has given everything a try,” or state that “anyone who knows the sea will tell you of her power.” That last part is a prompt for the film to focus on the habitat instead of the inhabitants. We see gigantic waves crashing onto shore, wrapping around lighthouses, and threatening to swallow small boats and big ships.\n\nWhen it isn’t gazing at or explaining what’s down there, “Oceans” shifts, smoothly and without any lecturing, to the environmental side of things. The blue fin tuna is in danger of extinction because of overfishing. Many other sea creatures are getting caught in the huge tuna nets. Satellite images show polluted rivers emptying into oceans. There’s mention of rising water temperatures and melting ice floes.\n\nSome parts of the film will make you laugh (slipping and sliding penguins), others will give you the willies (battalions of spider crabs attacking each other, like marauding armies in a Sam Peckinpah film). One jaw-dropping sequence, of a massive blue whale gliding by the camera, is reminiscent of the huge imperial ship in the opening scene of “Star Wars.” If in the unlikely event viewer attention starts to drift, thank goodness for an order the directors called for many times: Cue the dolphins!"
