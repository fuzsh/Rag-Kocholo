        "text": "Playing with tricks that require perfect timing and clever scheme makes this movie interesting. Most of the tricks shown in this movie exploit human's vulnerability, a key in the Social Engineering schemes. For us who live at the beginning of the modern digital age and pandemics, understanding how these manipulative actions successfully deceived their prey will be really important.\n\nSocial engineering is defined as a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables (Kaspersky). This kind of cybercrime actually can happen online, in person, and via other interactions. However, social engineering is often used as a very dangerous complement in hacking data or access to systems.\n\n#1 Free Products from Cosmetic Shop\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) easily “stolen” several branded cosmetics by grabbing them, then strolling around luxurious cosmetics, and finally going to the cashier: she simply said that she would like to return/refund those products.\n\nSince she couldn’t show the receipt, the staff couldn’t process them. She cleverly acted like she was angry for the overcomplication of the return procedure then left.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that we should always watch for “unidentified object/person” who enters our “system” (email, business, document, or even our physical environment) and validate that object/person.\n\nThe branded cosmetic shop should always remember all of their loyal customers (can be identified by the transaction volume or frequency). They should’ve noticed an unidentified customer who suddenly asked for a refund in the first place.\n\n#2 Free Staying at Luxurious Hotel\n\nShe, again, tricked the staff at the hotel by disguising herself as the guest (over a phone call) who just left. She just simply stated that she would stay a few days longer due to flight cancellation.\n\nHer trick worked really well because she added a few crucial elements in Social Engineering: knowing key information. Debbie captured the name of the guest and hotel staff, then fabricated a very common story in the hospitality industry: an extended stay.\n\nThe staff hotel could prevent this fraudulent activity by asking for either upfront payment or detailed data verification. But Debbie, our main character in the movie, got the upper hand since it is a luxurious hotel where most customers might find it rude for hotel staff to ask about upfront payment or data verification.\n\n#3 Getting into McCallister Security to Get Access to Their Camera System\n\nIt is both hilarious and sad that a security staff fell for such a cheap trick (but well, he is the Visual Matrix Design Dept. Head, but still!). The key here is once again, those bad guys will try to analyze your profile to manipulate us. They will examine any digital footprints available in social media or any websites.\n\nThe poor Paul Damanian clicked the \"phishing email\" and just like that, the crisis has been solved for The Ocean's 8 ladies. This can be prevented by not clicking any suspicious, not usual email. If you want to validate the authenticity of an email or website, always check the information outside the email, use a new window and find information about the source of the email or the company offering you something on trusted websites (e.g., web comparison, news). And also, control yourself toward things you like :)\n\nBonus: Recent Practices in Indonesia and Australia\n\nCase in Indonesia\n\nA few months ago, someone in Indonesia just used my photo from either Instagram or Facebook, put it as his/her WhatsApp profile picture then contacted SEVERAL of my friends, asking for money. Either this person has researched me for quite a while or he/she is actually my old friend who betrayed me: he/she could use 2 languages toward my 2 real friends who use different languages (Indonesian and Javanese). Luckily, my nearly-tricked friends felt something was off and contacted me via my old-consistent phone number. Some of my friends at work also experience the same thing: someone tries to disguise themselves and ask for money.\n\nNext time your friend asks for money using a different phone number or social media account, you have a reason to be afraid and ask them via regular contact. And be a cool-headed person, some bad guys even will shout about \"accident\" or \"your family member is in danger\" to add an element of surprise, just don't let your guard down!\n\nCase in Australia\n\nBefore I left Australia, I got several random text messages asking me to click certain links because \"my shipment or e-commerce orders got a problem\". I just ignored them all and block the contacts. I always check official websites/mobile apps where I bought the products or official websites of courier/shipment/delivery services then check my order via official code/reference issued by them.\n\nIt is a concerning threat as some people indeed order a lot of stuff that she/he might forget about the details then accidentally click one of the scams. Be careful all the time!"
