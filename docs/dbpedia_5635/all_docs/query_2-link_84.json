        "text": "All of the previous movies I’ve discussed have been superhero or sci-fi movies, but I made this blog to talk about women in all types of action movies. I don’t know exactly if Ocean’s Eight is classified as an “action” film, but it’s one that is interesting to look at when examining female leads in traditionally male-led genres (or in this case, a previously male-dominated franchise).\n\nWhen it was announced that Ocean’s Eight would be released, most people recognized that it was a reboot of the 2001 Ocean’s Eleven trilogy starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon among many others. However, the franchise actually began with the 1960 film Ocean’s 11, which starred Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. All four of these movies centered around thief Danny Ocean (played by Sinatra and Clooney) and the team that he assembles to execute elaborate heists, characterized by their unique twists and surprises.\n\nBoth versions of the eleven person team are exclusively male. In Ocean’s Twelve, the 2004 sequel, Ocean’s wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), joins the team, but she takes on an incredibly minor role after being roped into the plot after the original plot goes awry. In Ocean’s Thirteen, another man is added to the group.\n\nThe original eleven members of Ocean’s team were highly skilled in particular areas – often the best in the world at their trade. But, in Ocean’s Twelve, Tess doesn’t have any special abilities that make her an indispensable part of the team. As previously mentioned, she was a last minute addition to the team and strongly protested being a part of her husband’s criminal activities. She is only necessary for their plan because of her striking resemblance to Julia Roberts. Although this is incredibly funny and leads to many jokes, it means that the only thing she brought to the team was her appearance.\n\nOcean’s Eight features an eight woman team, led by Danny’s younger sister, Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock). It stars incredibly talented actresses: Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Rihanna, and Helena Bonham Carter. However, when it was first announced, some critics were worried that the all-female continuation of the original trilogy would end up similar to the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, which received very harsh reviews and was critiqued by opponents to female reinterpretations of male-dominated franchises for not living up to the original movie. Ocean’s Eight did not elicit the same level of sexist hatred, but how did it compare to the original trilogy?\n\nTo be continued…"
