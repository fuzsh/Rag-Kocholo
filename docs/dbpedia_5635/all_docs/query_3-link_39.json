        "text": "The original 1960-released Ocean’s 11 is the definitive Rat Pack movie, oozing cool from every frame. It was also the first movie all five Rat Pack members – Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop – appeared in together.\n\nLegend has it that Peter Lawford first heard the broad outline of the heist film’s story from Hollywood director Gilbert Kay. He, in turn, had heard the idea — about Danny Ocean, who corrals 10 of his fellow World War II paratrooper buddies to rob five Las Vegas casinos in one night —from a gas station attendant. Lawford snapped up the rights in 1958, with William Holden in mind for the lead role of Ocean. When Sinatra heard the plot, he reportedly said, “Forget the movie, let’s pull the job!”\n\nThe singer-actor moved into the lead role as the heist’s mastermind. He pulled down a salary of $700,000 ($6 million today) to star.\n\nAs the film’s ensemble came together, Dean Martin was cast as wisecracking lounge singer Sam Harmon. And Sammy Davis Jr. took the role of Josh Howard, a vet who becomes a sanitation worker to pull off the con. Lawford signed on as wealthy rake Jimmy Foster, and Joey Bishop took the role of “Mushy” O’Connors. Rat Pack “mascots” Angie Dickinson and Shirley MacLaine also had parts in the film.\n\nLewis Milestone, director of the antiwar epic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), helmed the picture.\n\nRenowned director Billy Wilder was one of the writers who worked on the Ocean’s 11 script as a favor to Sinatra. The star thanked Wilder by gifting him with a sketch by Pablo Picasso. Despite script-doctoring by Wilder, most of the scenes between the actors — who had known each other for years by then — were reportedly ad-libbed.\n\nOne story goes that as soon as 5 p.m. hit, all of the Rat Packers called, “Cut.” Most of the cast were also performing in the Sands’ Copa Room after shooting wrapped each day, in a show called the “Summit at the Sands.” After the evening performance, the gang supposedly partied late into the night. And the Rat Pack’s wild ways were evident when they showed up on set looking the worse for wear the following day.\n\nNo matter – rather than harm the movie, that relaxed attitude to work and love of a party came through on the screen… and cemented the Rat Pack legend forever, long before George Clooney and Brad Pitt reinvented it for a new generation."
