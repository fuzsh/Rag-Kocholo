        "text": "The world has gone through a lot of changes over the past few weeks in response to the Coronavirus crisis. With most of us being ordered to stay home, we’ve been searching for interesting ways to occupy our time.\n\nAs much as we love activities like board games, puzzles, reading and crafts, sometimes we’re in the mood for a movie (and some popcorn, of course!). Movies are great for taking your mind off of things and escaping into a fantasy world for an hour or two.\n\nHere are 10 great movies on Netflix that ocean lovers are sure to appreciate:\n\nDolphin Tale 2: As a sequel to the 2011 film Dolphin Tale, Dolphin Tale 2 is another dose of family-friendly dolphin goodness. In Dolphin Tale 2, the crew from the original film (which includes stars such as Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, and Harry Connick Jr.) reassembles to find the beloved dolphin, Winter, a suitable companion. If you fall in love with Winter like we did, you may want to check out our dolphin jewelry range (once the credits start to role of course).\n\nBig Miracle: In this heartwarming tale, a news reporter (John Krasinski) and his environmentalist ex-girlfriend (Drew Barrymore) unite to try and save a family of gray whales. The film is not only entertaining— it’s based on the incredible true story of Operation Breakthrough, which took place in 1988.\n\nThe Little Mermaid (2018): By now, we’re likely all familiar with Disney’s The Little Mermaid, a 1989 animated film based on Hans Christian Anderson’s classic tale. This beloved story gets a brand new spin with 2018’s live-action film, The Little Mermaid. Though 2018’s The Little Mermaid is inspired by Hans Christian Anderson, you’ll be surprised and delighted by the rejuvenated storyline. If you’re intrigued by the mythic mermaid, you may be interested in learning more about the symbolism of mermaids on our blog.\n\nHook: What’s better than adventure and intrigue on the high seas? Steven Spielberg’s 1991 film Hook became an instant classic— and it’s not hard to see why! The children of Peter Pan (who is played by Robin Williams) are abducted by Captain Hook. With the help of Tinkerbell and the lovable Lost Boys, Peter Pan must fight to save his kids from the evil Hook.\n\nMission Blue: In this immersive and thought-provoking documentary, we follow renowned oceanographer Dr. Sylvia Earl, as she works to save the ocean. Dr. Earl’s passion is contagious in this 2014 Emmy-winning film, and it’s an honor to get a comprehensive look at her noble journey. This film is eye opening, and a must-see for ocean lovers everywhere.\n\nOceans: The whole family will enjoy this awe-inspiring documentary, which gives viewers an up-close look at aquatic life. Narrated by Pierce Brosnan, you’ll love the experience of following whales on their migration journey, swimming alongside a great white shark, frolicking with the dolphins at play, and so much more!\n\n47 Meters Down: While this survivor horror film may not be easy watching, you may want to check it out (after the kids go to bed) if you’re in the mood to explore the darker side of the ocean—and a fictional side at that! Starring Mandy Moore, the film centers on two sisters who get trapped on the ocean floor after their cage diving trip goes terribly wrong. Will they be able to escape before their oxygen supply fades?\n\nRip Tide: This family-friendly Australian teen drama follows an American teenager who travels to an Australian beach town to live with her aunt. If you’re a fan of heartwarming coming-of-age films set in gorgeous locations (with plenty of surfing and romance!) this movie is for you.\n\nScales: Mermaids are real: A young girl learns she’s destined to transform into a mermaid on her 12th birthday. This film follows her journey as she comes to terms with her newfound fate, saying goodbye to her family and friends while also trying to evade danger that comes from those that want to capture her.\n\nA Plastic Ocean: For anyone who loves the ocean and wants to learn more about the serious issues that are threatening it, this documentary is a must-see. Filmmaker Craig Leeson begins his journey by searching for the elusive blue whale, and discovers a startling amount of plastic waste in the ocean along the way. Though hard to watch, this movie highlights just how important it is that we all do our part to help the ocean.\n\nFor anyone who loves the ocean and is looking for something interesting to watch, the above 10 movies will get you started in the right direction. All you have to do is just add popcorn.\n\nWishing you and yours a very safe and healthy quarantine, that will hopefully be made a bit more entertaining with the suggestions above. Enjoy!"
