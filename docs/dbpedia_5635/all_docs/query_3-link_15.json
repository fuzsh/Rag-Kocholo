        "text": "Sarah: I went to see this movie on Friday, 8 June. That morning, one of my neighbors mentioned hearing that all the reviews she’d seen were really terrible, that it was a “missed opportunity” or some such whatever. I, slightly less-than-entirely caffeinated and therefore lacking neighborly diplomacy, asked if the reviewers who wrote those reviews were men, and if so, I didn’t plan on listening to them because for a large percentage of male critics of any form of entertainment, well, they don’t like it when women win.\n\nI like it a lot when women win.\n\nAnd there is a fair amount of win in this movie. Wow, is there winning.\n\nThe summary is pretty simple: Debbie Ocean, sister of Danny Ocean, who is presumed dead (there’s a grave and everything but of course there’s no body so who knows?) (even the characters acknowledge he might not be entirely dead, and therefore slightly alive) gets out of prison after 5+ years. The film opens with her parole hearing, then skips to her exit as she puts on lipstick, advises a guard what to do with the next shipment coming in, and heads out with $45 in her pocket, saying she can do anything she wants.\n\nShe immediately cons her way into some upscale cosmetics, then a hotel room, and then some clothes in a random suitcase – one presumes those items fit her – and her first day out ends with her in the bathtub looking at a hand-drawn list as she drinks wine.\n\nShe finds her former partner Lou, played by Cate Blanchett – more on that in a moment – and begins sketching out an outrageous heist. The heist part you saw in the trailers: there’s jewels, there’s the Met Gala so there’s umpty-twelve levels of sparkly glamour surrounding the heist, and there’s the team assembled to pull it off, whom you also saw in the trailers: Rhianna, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sarah Paulson.\n\nI loved so much about this film. I loved each character’s strengths, and how they built on and complemented each other. I loved the wardrobe – especially Cate Blanchett’s character who needed more screen time just standing still. I really enjoyed the large and small ways in which they took care of each other, and I adored that they were fearlessly conning others and had no shame about that. Everything in society is a con already, especially against women, so why not con harder?\n\nMy only major problem was that I didn’t think there was a truly looming, oh-shit moment of peril wherein I thought, nope, they are completely and utterly fucked. Because of that, the slide toward the end seemed less exhilarating than the first 3/4ths of the movie.\n\nI also wonder if Lou and Debbie’s relationship could have been more in the foretext (?) instead of a hint. At one point Debbie mentions that she was going through “a rough patch with Lou” – and their relationship seemed cast as more than friendship, more like the time-worn familiarity of two people who used to be together. I wish that had been more obvious, because hinting when everything else was so very much determined to take advantage of the obvious seems like a let-down.\n\nThe thing I remember most is how much fun I had in the theatre, how many moments I was laughing. Even when James Corden, Professional British Puppy, showed up, I didn’t find him too annoying (I typically enjoy very small Corden doses). Heist movies are fun, heist movies with a crew of women are very fun, and this movie in particular was exactly what I wanted, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nRHG: So my history with the Ocean’s movies is LONG- I love 11 with an unabashed glee and it’s one of my “I know I have it on DVD and streaming but if I find it on cable I’ll watch it” movie. 12 was clearly a lot of fun to make, even if the plot is kiiiiind of a mess, but as a rebuttal, I give you Vincent Cassel. And 13 is just fun.\n\nSo you tell me that I get an all lady Ocean’s movie and you give THAT cast, and I am in all the way. ALL. THE. WAY.\n\nHeist movies tend to come in two flavors, kinda rompy, or deadly ass serious. (Den of Thieves and The Town are examples of Deadly Ass Serious. The Ocean’s series, The Italian Job, these are rompy.\n\nI loved just about everything- the relationship between Debbie and Lou, the clear joy Anne Hathaway had in having all these supprotie ladies around her, the pairing of Helena Bonham Carter and Mindy Kaling, which I never expected and now I want them to have a road trip movie.\n\nWe also know that my love for Richard Armitage is pure and true, and he was perfectly cast as the handsome but kinda douchey and completely out of his depth dude who got on the wrong side of an Ocean. (Don’t get on the wrong side of an Ocean. You’ll just lose a lot of your money and be tired.)\n\nThe thesis of the movie was clearly stated when Lou and Debbie were going over potential candidates for the 7th member of the team, and Lou holds up a picture of a dude, and Debbie says “No dudes. They get all the attention.” instead this was Ladies Doing It For Themselves (the title of my second favorite personal playlist on my phone) and it was glorious.\n\nThe only quibble I have, and it’s a fairly minor one, all things considered, is that they didn’t really get to the truly ridiculous level of over the top that costumes for the Met Gala can take. It’s probably a question of finances- that would be incredibly expensive. But it is the kind of place where the Chair of the Gala would wear a $150 million dollar necklace. I’d just expect her gown to be MORE.\n\n(Also you should definitely take the opportunity to watch the documentary First Monday in May, which is about the Met Gala and how it’s put on. It’s fascinating, and I highly recommend it.)\n\nOh, and Debbie and Lou definitely were in a relationship with each other at some point. 100%. Possibly still. I mean, wouldn’t you?\n\nSarah: I’m for a B+ on this one. You?\n\nRedHeadedGirl: B+. No question.\n\nSarah: If you like fun heist films with a lot of glamour and savvy women working together, you’ll really enjoy this one.\n\nSo what about you? Did you see Ocean’s 8 this weekend? What did you think?"
