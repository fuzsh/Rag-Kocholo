        "text": "Everyone is entitled to a binge-watch sometimes – think of it as a well-deserved pleasure! Perhaps you want to avoid boredom on a long flight to your favorite scuba destination, enjoy a film night with friends, or pass the time during an extended surface interval. Whatever the reason, if you’re planning a marathon movie session, then why not do it like a diver with some of the best ocean movies of all time? In no particular order, here are 30 binge-worthy movie ideas to get you started.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\n\nInto the Blue\n\nFor Your Eyes Only\n\nThunderball\n\nMen of Honour\n\nThe Deep\n\nThe Abyss\n\nThe Big Blue\n\nSanctum\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\n\nOpen Water\n\nDark Tide\n\nFool’s Gold\n\nDeep Blue Sea\n\nFinding Nemo\n\nSphere\n\nAquaman\n\nThe Cave\n\nMission Impossible: Rogue Nation\n\nJaws\n\nTitanic\n\nThe Perfect Storm\n\nThe Little Mermaid\n\nThe Hunt for Red October\n\nLife of Pi\n\nTrue Spirit\n\nThe Dive\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water\n\nBlueback\n\nThe Deepest Breath\n\n1. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\n\nThis might not be Bill Murray’s most revered movie, but Wes Anderson’s story is certainly watchable. Also, the film was dedicated to Jacques-Yves Cousteau. In the movie, fictional Oceanographer Zissou plans to get revenge on a mythical shark that killed his partner, leading to much offbeat humor and proper belly laughs. Did you know that Bill Murray even became a PADI Open Water Diver before making the movie? He’s one of the numerous actors and Hollywood A-listers that are also certified PADI divers!\n\n2. Into The Blue (2005)\n\nThis film tells the entertaining story of a group of young divers who go looking for a legendary treasure ship in the Bahamas. While diving, they stumble upon an airplane wreck full of illegal drugs, leading to an underground storyline of mobs and underwater action. The movie has an abundance of shark footage, most of which was filmed using live, wild sharks in their natural habitat. The movie also stars Jessica Alba and Paul Walker, and the exotic scenery will take you off your couch and into your next dive trip!\n\n3. For Your Eyes Only (1981)\n\nOf course, no underwater movie list can ever be complete without a James Bond movie (or two, or three…!). For Your Eyes Only includes up-close, underwater footage of Roger Moore in both Greece and the Bahamas. But you might not have known that true to good old 1980s filming techniques, most of the scenes were actually filmed on a soundstage, with special effects added later to give the impression of water moving around them.\n\n4. Thunderball (1965)\n\nTurning back the James Bond clock to the nineteen sixties when Sean Connery was the man of the moment is Thunderball. In this Bond classic, Connery dives with sharks in the Bahamas. During filming, clear plastic panels were placed in the water to separate the actor from the sharks. But, behind the scenes, this didn’t work as intended, and the sharks, being the intelligent species that they are, soon found their way around the panels and were swimming up to the cast – of course, aside from the odd fright, everyone lived to tell the tale.\n\n5. Men of Honor (2000)\n\nThis Oscar-winning under-the-sea movie starring Cuba Gooding Jr. was a box office hit. Gooding plays Carl Brashear, the U.S. Navy’s first African-American Master Diver. Both discouraged and driven by his instructor (Robert De Niro), Brashear overcomes the institutional racism that was commonplace in the 1940s and his incomplete education to become an operational diver in the Navy. It’s a feel-good movie with a message – and of course, you might want to have tissues on hand for the multiple tear-jerking moments in this scuba flick!\n\n6. The Deep (1977)\n\nThis seventies hit movie was based on a novel by Peter Benchley and follows a vacationing couple who stumble upon some mysterious artifacts while wreck diving off Bermuda. It is rumored that the making of The Deep required 9,985 dives, 10,870 hours underwater, and 1 million cubic feet of compressed air – which, if nothing else, definitely puts it in the record books!\n\n7. The Abyss (1989)\n\nAliens and deep sea diving rolled into one by James Cameron – what’s not to love about that? Did you know that James Cameron has a passion for the ocean, is an avid scuba diver himself, and was the third person ever to dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench? In The Abyss, a US nuclear submarine sinks near a massive trench after encountering a mystical underwater entity. If the storyline doesn’t wow you, then the amazing special effects still make this deep sea movie a worthwhile watch!\n\n8. The Big Blue (1988)\n\nReleased in Europe as Le Grand Bleu, the storyline is around two lifelong friends who grow up to be freediving rivals in the Mediterranean Sea. This is one of the best marine movies to whisk you away to some of Europe’s most impressive tropical locations, and the dolphin scenes are bound to brighten your day!\n\n9. Sanctum (2011)\n\nBased on real-life experience, Sanctum is a cave diving thriller produced by James Cameron. This is one that will have you glued to the screen; however, this tense and gripping movie may not be suitable for those who are claustrophobic or planning to take their PADI Open Water Diver certification.\n\n10. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954)\n\nDespite numerous remakes over the years, the original Walt Disney Productions version is an all-time classic when it comes to deep ocean movies. From scenes of battling with giant squid to Nautilus divers scouring the ocean floor for sea life to help feed the crew, it’s bound to keep you entertained – which also explains why it won two Academy Awards and has become a timeless classic!\n\n11. Open Water (2004)\n\nOpen Water is the story of two people being left behind in the open ocean by their dive boat. As expected, sharks eventually appear, and tensions rise as the couple’s holiday rapidly takes a nosedive. Very watchable but probably not one of the best ocean movies for new divers who are about to embark on their first boat diving experience!\n\n12. Dark Tide (2011)\n\nHalle Berry stars as a “Shark Whisperer” who is haunted by her memories following a shark attack – which she inevitably has to overcome and win the day. This is not one of Halle Berry’s most famous movies, and it didn’t have a big impact at the box office, but it’s still very watchable.\n\n13. Fool’s Gold (2008)\n\nA must-watch scuba movie for Matthew McConaughey fans, filmed in beautiful Australia. McConaughey’s character is a deep-sea treasure hunter who rekindles his relationship with his estranged wife Kate Hudson during a quest to find a Spanish shipwreck full of treasure. This is great family entertainment, despite the questionable diving techniques. The smattering of charm and humor makes for easy and entertaining watching for all ages.\n\n14. Deep Blue Sea (1999)\n\nDeep Blue Sea stars Samuel L. Jackson, whose character takes on genetically modified sharks at an isolated research facility from which the sharks are trying to escape into the open ocean. This one obviously packs both action and suspense as Samuel L. Jackson fights his way to victory over these fishy friends.\n\n15. Finding Nemo (2003)\n\nIt’s impossible to be a scuba diver and not have some affinity for this movie. The fish characters brilliantly display real-life characteristics which have been transplanted into their personalities. Perfect family entertainment and equally ideal for teaching kids some fish ID skills, it’s considered one of the best-animated ocean movies by divers and non-divers alike!\n\n16. Sphere (1998)\n\nSphere is another Samuel L. Jackson deep sea movie that also stars Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone as a team of scientists. The team is sent to investigate a 300-year-old spaceship 1,000 feet/304 meters underwater, which subsequently turns out to be an American craft, presumably from the future, sent back through time after a mission through space. The movie is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, and with an all-star cast, it’s certainly worth a watch.\n\n17. Aquaman (2018)\n\nFollowing years of waiting for an Aquaman movie, this did everything expected of it – non-stop action and adventure that spans the vast underwater world of the seven seas. The storyline is a rather predictable superhero affair, but what’s not to love about that? Definitely one to include in any scuba diving binge-watching session!\n\n18. The Cave (2005)\n\nWhile on a dig in a Romanian forest, a group of scientists finds a huge abbey built over the entrance to a network of caves. They hire a team of divers who are armed with new high-tech scuba gear (essentially a modified rebreather) that allows them to stay underwater for a full 24 hours. They soon discover they are not alone, as scary creatures make their presence known.\n\n19. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015)\n\nKnown for his characters’ crazy stunts, which he often performs himself, Tom Cruise learned freediving skills to prepare himself for making this MI movie. As a result, Cruise reportedly became a very competent freediver, achieving static breath holds of six minutes – very impressive after just two months of training!\n\n20. Jaws (1975)\n\nYou can’t talk about the best ocean movies without also mentioning the famous Jaws franchise. Despite there not being much scuba-related content, this movie forever changed the perception of sharks for many people (not necessarily a good thing). This is often cited as one of the most groundbreaking motion pictures of all time but undeniably contributed to the image of sharks as man-eaters worldwide.\n\n21. Titanic (1997)\n\nStarring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, there is no scuba diving, but some of cinema’s most memorable underwater scenes. James Cameron admitted he made the movie only so he could dive the Titanic himself – which he did, using the Mir submersibles and a Russian exploration vessel. The details contained in the movie are reportedly all accurate portrayals of the real vessel (even down to the crockery used in the restaurant), and when combined with Hollywood A-listers and a heart-wrenching love story, it’s a gripping movie and a real feat of film production.\n\n22. The Perfect Storm (2000)\n\nBased on true events from the 1991 Perfect Storm, this epic disaster movie follows a group of fishermen who get caught at sea during the worst possible conditions. Featuring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, the film received mixed reviews but is still worth a watch so you can decide for yourself.\n\n23. The Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nThis classic Disney musical tells the story of Ariel, a rebellious mermaid who is fascinated by the world above the surface, much to the disapproval of her father – King Triton. Following a deal with an evil sea witch, Ariel meets (and falls in love with) a real human prince. It’s undeniably one of the best underwater movies for kids – and adults if you haven’t seen it yet!\n\n24. The Hunt for Red October (1990)\n\nOne of the best ocean movies to watch if you love a good spy thriller, this is a tense adaption of Tom Clancy’s acclaimed 1984 novel. Sean Connery stars as a Soviet nuclear submarine commander heading for the US, while the CIA’s Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) tries to anticipate his next moves.\n\n25. Life of Pi (2012)\n\nAng Lee’s Oscar-winning adaption is a survival tale of faith and friendship. The story follows a teenage boy, Pi, and a Bengal tiger stranded on a lifeboat for 227 days. Blending tragedy, philosophy, and stunning visuals, this is an unmissable, refreshing, thought-provoking alternative to the usual disaster-themed or scary ocean movies.\n\n26. True Spirit (2023)\n\nThis ocean movie follows the real-life story of 16-year-old Jessica Watson (played by Teagan Croft) who dreams big! Jessica wants to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe non-stop. Her brave journey is fraught with a few mishaps along the way (think storms, loneliness, and even a stray cargo ship). This is a truly inspirational story – especially if you are watching with young adventurers.\n\n27. The Dive (2023)\n\nThis remake of Heden’s 2020 Norwegian film Breaking Surface is packed with action from start to finish. As two sisters head out on a diving trip, they couldn’t have known what lay ahead. After a freak underwater incident traps one of the sisters underwater, it becomes a fight for survival and a race against the clock.\n\n28. Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)\n\nIf you were a fan of James Cameron’s original Avatar movie back in 2009, then this is one for you. What’s even more impressive is that Kate Winslet reportedly completed a 7-minute breath-hold during filming – a feat for any freediver. With more films reportedly coming soon from the Avatar franchise (and Pandora), combined with an increasing list of Hollywood A-listers, we can’t wait to see what comes next!\n\n29. Blueback (2022)\n\nThis heartwarming and inspiring movie is based on the original novel by Tim Winton. The lead character is a young Australian named Abby (Mia Wasikowska) who forms a relationship with a blue grouper while freediving. Her underwater moments with the grouper inspire her to become a spokesperson for coral reef protection in Australia – a nice eco twist combined with incredible cinematography.\n\n30. The Deepest Breath (2023)\n\nThis riveting docu-movie, directed by Laura McGann, is packed with incredible underwater footage and tells of the relationship between freediver Alessia Zecchini and her safety diver, Stephen Keenan. Filmed in some of the best freediving locations around the world, it also provides a behind-the-scenes look at the sport of competitive freediving.\n\nHave you got your popcorn ready? After you’ve binge-watched all the best ocean movies that you can, why not join some of these Hollywood A-listers and get started on your scuba diving certification?\n\nIt’s as easy as taking an online course, visiting your local dive center to practice in confined water, and then diving into open waters, like those portrayed in these films, to finish off your certification."
