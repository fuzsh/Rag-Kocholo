        "text": "It was said of Irving Thalberg, production chief at MGM and model for Monroe Stahr in Fitzgerald's The Last Tycoon, that he didn't make films, he remade them, meaning that he was always re-editing other men's work. Steven Soderbergh, though he has no reason to, is a remake man in the more obvious sense, having remade Siodmak's Criss Cross as The Underneath, Simon Moore's Traffik as Traffic, and under the original titles a forthcoming American production of Erik Skjoldbj√¶rg's Insomnia, and this week's heist movie, Ocean's Eleven.\n\nRobbing casinos is a familiar movie plot. In 1955, five years before Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean and his obsequious clan of former wartime buddies shook down five Las Vegas casinos in one night, a crew of college kids planned a raid on a Reno gambling spot in Five Against the House, and eight years after the Rat Pack caper there was the gritty They Came to Rob Las Vegas.\n\nBut Soderbergh's is a state-of-the-art heist flick, a gleaming stretch-limo of a picture set in the new Vegas, the gambling Disneyland from which the Mob have been ejected to be replaced by corporate sharks such as the ruthless, quietly spoken Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who owns the Bellagio, the casino where Braques and Picassos look down contemptuously on diners and gamblers, and keeps the money from the MGM and the Mirage in his vaults.\n\nTess (Julia Roberts in Angie Dickinson's original role) manages the gallery side of the business and is both Terry's lover and Danny Ocean's ex-wife. So when Danny (George Clooney) gets out of the New Jersey slammer after serving four years for theft he decides to lift $80 million from Terry's impenetrable vault and reclaim his wife.\n\nLooking like Clark Gable, but more self-contained, Clooney's Danny contacts old chum Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), poker teacher to the Hollywood stars, and gets bank-rolled by an ex-Vegas tycoon, a former mobster with a grudge against Benedict.\n\nLike Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, the pair set about recruiting their magnificent 11. They pick a wild bunch of experts, among them an elderly Jewish con man (Carl Reiner), a Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin), a Mormon electronics wizard (Scott Caan), and a black British safecracker (Don Cheadle), who talks in cockney rhyming slang, a jokey reference to Terence Stamp as the eponymous hero of Soderbergh's The Limey, whom no American can understand. Precisely what everyone's role is would take a Sherlock Holmes to infer, and part of the fun is seeing the master plan fall into place bit by bit, until the final preposterous piece completes the whole picture.\n\nThe movie is more like an elegant journey in a hot-air balloon than a trip on a rollercoaster and is that rare thing, a thriller without any violence, sex or profanity (just one four-letter word mangled in Chinese English). In a little epilogue, the gang silently contemplates its work and the beauty of Vegas at night to the strains of Debussy's 'Clair de Lune'. Unlike the 1960 Sinatra picture, it ignores showbusiness and we never see a floor show or a cabaret act.\n\nOcean's Eleven is devoid of morality other than a dedication to honour among thieves; it's consistently funny in a way that invites appreciative smiles rather than loud laughter; it's exciting without bringing disagreeable sweat to the palms; it's engaging, but never does anything as vulgar as taking us out of ourselves. In a word, it is what it sets out to be (and what the Sinatra Rat Pack thought they were, but more often than not failed to be) - quintessentially cool. As cool in fact as Danny Ocean emerging from jail not once but twice wearing the midnight-blue tuxedo in which he was arrested."
