        "text": "George Clooney may be returning to the “Ocean’s” franchise. In a new interview with Uproxx while promoting his movie “The Boys in the Boat,” the actor revealed that a script for another “Ocean’s” movie exists that would seemingly reunite the original trilogy’s cast for a movie set after the events of 2007’s “Ocean’s 13.” Clooney did not provide any concrete details.\n\n“We have a really good script for another ‘Ocean’s’ now, so we may end up doing another one. It’s actually a great script,” Clooney told the publication.\n\nWhen Uproxx asked if the script was for a potential “Ocean’s 14,” Clooney responded: “Well… I don’t want to call it that… I mean, the idea is kind of like ‘Going in Style.'”\n\nClooney is referring to Martin Brest’s 1979 heist comedy, which famously starred George Burns, Art Carney, Lee Strasberg and Charles Hallahan. Zach Braff remade the film in 2017 with a cast that featured Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin. The plot centers on a three senior citizens who team up to pull off a heist.\n\nThe original “Ocean’s” trilogy, directed by Steven Soderbergh, featured Clooney opposite Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and more. The heist trilogy launched in 2001 with “Ocean’s Eleven,” a critical favorite and a commercial hit with just over $450 million at the worldwide box office, and continued with 2004’s “Ocean’s Twelve” ($362 million) and 2007’s “Ocean’s Thirteen” ($311 million). A spinoff, 2018’s “Ocean’s 8,” starred Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean opposite Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Mindy Kaling and Anne Hathaway. The movie hit the $297 million mark worldwide.\n\nAs the world waits to see if Clooney and the gang reunite, Warner Bros. is moving forward first with an “Ocean’s” prequel movie that will reunite “Barbie” stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Plot details for the prequel are still being kept under wraps, but the story is expected to take place in 1960s Europe.\n\n“I can’t really say much,” producer Josey McNamara recently told Games Radar about the project. “But I think we’re just trying to do right by the franchise. I’m excited for people to experience it when it’s ready.”\n\nReports have surfaced that Robbie and Gosling will play the parents of Clooney’s Danny Ocean. Speaking to Variety on the red carpet of his new directorial effort “The Boys in the Boat,” Clooney reacted to the news by wisecracking, “Margot Robbie’s my mother? I’ve always thought that. And Ryan Gosling is my father, and when you think about it, it makes sense. Truly.”\n\nJay Roach is attached to direct the “Ocean’s” prequel movie."
