        "text": "Is “Under the Sea” already playing in your head? Almost everyone has wondered what it would be like to be part of that world and astrology can help us understand which marine animal you would be if you could embrace your inner mermaid. With that in mind, let’s do a deep dive into to which ocean animal matches your zodiac sign’s personality the most.\n\nAlthough the cosmos, there’s nothing more fascinating than the ocean. Summertime memories of catching minnows and breaking apart snails to feed rock crabs may immediately come to mind when you think of the ocean. But once we go beyond hermit crabs scuttling across the beach at low tide, an plethora of incredible marine animals await you. If you’re ever so lucky to snorkel in the coral reefs, then you will be amazed watching the fish dart in between the anemones while predators lurk just out of sight. But if the reefs aren’t calling your name, you may feel more inclined to go on a whale-watching excursion to see playful dolphins swim alongside your boat while a whale breaches in the distance. Then again, the icy Arctic has so much to offer, from narwhal sightings to adorable emperor penguins. Even a trip to the local aquarium will do wonders, since it may expose you to a captivating marine species you didn’t know about! No matter which of the seven seas is calling your name, you will always be amazed by what the changing tides bring.\n\nThe ocean animal that captures each zodiac sign"
