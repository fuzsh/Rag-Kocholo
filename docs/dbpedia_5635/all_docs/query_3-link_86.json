        "text": "October 1, 2022\n\nSo unterhaltsam und spannend wie der Film.\n\nJune 22, 2018\n\nRead before the movie. It was quite Ok, but I still stick to the wonderful film.\n\nRead\n\nMay 26, 2020\n\nThis book kept me interested and wanting to hear more inconstantly, I loved it from the massive heists just to the charterers. This book is about a few people who decided to plan a heist. I wish I could tell you more but the book is just so good you'll have to read it yourself. I would recommend this book to anyone upwards of there teens and that enjoy criminal books or just anyone who's interested in this book it's truly amazing.\n\nDecember 27, 2010\n\nHas anyone ever successfully robbed a casino? Many wonder the different options one can take in illegally stealing from a bank vault similar to those of nuclear silos. But only one man, Daniel Ocean, has the exact plan and courage to take on such a task. Ocean, a top hit man criminal type is at it again right after he gets out of jail. His target: 3 five-star casinos located in downtown Las Vegas.\n\nThis edition of the fabulous 70's classic integrates modern technology with Ocean's (and his men) plot to overtake Terry Benedict for messing him over and stealing his woman. If you have not yet seen the movie, then this book is just for you.\n\nBe ready, however, to experience great jumps as the story hops around different scenes and explains most but not all the details. You will have to figure the rest out yourself.\n\nIf you liked the movie, this book is literally just the script written in paragraph form. It adds a bit more of an insight of the characters, and is still generally entertaining. If you're a die-hard fan (like myself) of the series, you'll like this book.\n\nMore of Purplycookie’s Reviews @: http://www.goodreads.com/purplycookie\n\nBook Details:\n\nTitle Ocean's 11\n\nAuthor Dewey Gram\n\nReviewed By Purplycookie\n\nFebruary 22, 2020\n\nIt's difficult to turn a movie into a book. It's usually the other way around, and when this is the case, the book is usually better than the movie.\n\nAugust 1, 2015\n\nLow quality chewing gum. Written in a fast cut screen way, this would have been better as a graphic novel. The story is fine: it's a heist, with a bunch of specialists. You have to wonder why guys like this (always guys, never gals) appear to be only able to make money illegally - perhaps it pays better? If so, it's an indictment of how society treats its experts. Aha, because 'fiction'.\n\nAnyway.\n\nCoincidences abound: people get hurt, but only for that scene. After the scene, they might screw their eyes up, but it does not prevent them doing acrobatics or improbable jumps. Gadgets abound: the 'spider' to hijack the video feed is a clever idea; the remote control driving is interesting; the fast costume changes, the 'make it look like I was there all along', the various slight of hands.... Part of me felt there wasn't time for the various things to happen, but 'because fiction' allows time, and disbelief, to be suspended.\n\nWhy two stars? Because it felt like the movie, not like a book: this is a short story writ long, in large font with wide spacing. One dimensional characters (except for Ocean). Deus ex machina inserts to make your eyebrows stand above your forehead. More 'guess what's than a six year old telling a tall tale.\n\nJanuary 2, 2008\n\nBook is based on the screenplay and is basically a scene for scene write up of the updated movie. That said, if you liked the movie or the subject matter (vegas/casino related) you'll enjoy it. Very fast read.\n\nMay 10, 2012\n\nCharacters-3.5\n\nStoryline/Plot-5\n\nWriting-3\n\nOverall- 3.8\n\nI got this book because I'm a huge fan of the movie.\n\nFor me the movie is a lot better. I think the characters are more developed and you get a better sense of them. Of course I love the storyline.\n\nMarch 6, 2018\n\nIf you like the movie, you will like this book. If you have not seen the movie and are into witty heist stories, this is worth a read. The only perk of the movie over the book were the high intensity movie scenes were anti-climatic in writing.\n\nJuly 18, 2019\n\nExactly like the movie because it's a novel based on the screenplay. So doesn't matter if you watch the movie first. The book doesn't give descriptions of the charters, because they are Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt etc.\n\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nKannte den Film schon und hab ihn sehr gemocht. Das Buch dazu war ebenso interessant. Alles wußte ich ja doch nicht mehr und so wurde es nicht langweilig. Schnell gelesen ist das Buch zudem auch.\n\nApril 6, 2018\n\nLove con artist type reads and this one does not disappoint, the ending in the old Rat Pack original was pretty funny\n\nJune 7, 2017\n\nBEST MYSTERY/ACTION BOOK EVER. LOVED IT.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 21, 2021\n\nIn this action packed thriller, it takes you through the journey of two friends ( Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan) who plan a mischievous heist to rob $150 million from Terry Benedict, who is a big time casino owner In Las Vegas. Danny Ocean seeked Vengeance on Benedict because he had been associated with Ocean's ex-lover (Tess). Risk taking, Explosions, and shoot outs, this tale will leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. Dewey Gram really made the life of a gangster in the 1960s come to life, capturing the good and bad in people, who are from different ends of the wealth spectrum.\n\nGram allows you to fully visualise the story he is trying to portray, and with that it brings you into the minds of the characters which allows you to feel all of their sneaky, and snakish thoughts. If you are a lover of The Hunter , then you will be thrilled with this action filled masterpiece.\n\nSeptember 19, 2023\n\nDewey can bring it, but Dewey didn't bring it. Somebody had Dewey on a tight leash. Pearls (Dewey) before swine (Warner Bros.)\n\nRead the novelization of Sneakers instead.\n\nApril 1, 2015\n\nIn Las Vegas,Nevada, the usual people coming from all over are far from usual. But they all come looking for a good time and getting lucky from casinos. Anyone can win big but sometimes there are other means than gambling to do it, even though it is still gambling. Wouldn't you say robbing a casino is a gamble.\n\nIn Danny Ocean's case robbing a casino isn't a gamble but another job. Even if he doesn't even care about the money. He really just wants to get revenge. I love the plot of this book and the way it is written. I like it so much because I can relate to the way Danny and Rusty talk to each other and the way they talk to other people. If you have that one friend that you can tell what they are going to do before they do it then you can understand their relationship.\n\nMaybe a little scattered from scene to scene the author does change the image in your head very frequently, has if to always keep you focused and in tuned to the planning and execution. Though not such a long story it really is full of lots of action and interaction between characters, which is probably why I loved reading it every second. If any of this sounds interesting to you or like your cup of tea, then I would definitely read it as soon as possible.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 15, 2016\n\nIk hou van de Ocean's 11, Ocean's 12 en Ocean's 13 films! Dit boek was net zo leuk als de film en ik vind het jammer dat er de laatste twee niet in boek vorm zijn geschreven.\n\nJuly 21, 2007\n\nReally captures teh spirit and humor of the movie, though it doesn't add much. Still a fun read.\n\nRead\n\nApril 9, 2009\n\ni saw the movie :P"
