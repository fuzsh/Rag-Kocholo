        "text": "The One with Two Parts, Pt. 2\n\nAfter weeks of procrastinating, Rachel finally takes down the Christmas light on their balcony, only to fall off the balcony and sprain her ankle. At the hospital, Rachel - who has no insurance - cajoles Monica into trading identities so she can use Monica's coverage. When Ursula breaks Joey's heart Phoebe tries to fix it.\n\nRadio Days\n\nRoseanne wants Dan to enter a country music song-writing contest sponsored by the local radio station. Dan is reluctant to do so until he finds out that the grand prize is a hundred dollars. Unable to come up with a new idea, and not pleased with anything he wrote in the past, Dan chooses one of Roseanne's old poems to put to music. Sexual tension between Jackie and Booker heat up in the workplace. Becky and Darlene are at each other's throats.\n\nLovers' Lane\n\nRoseanne talks Booker and the women from work into going bowling. Becky gets dolled up for the night out, because she has a first crush on a boy from her school that works at the bowling alley, but is mortified at the thought of being embarrassed by her parents. Jackie and Booker make a \"friendly\" wager involving a sleepover vs. toilet bowl scrubbing."
