George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle go for broke to pull off the most sophisticated and daring Las Vegas casino heist ever. Less than 24 hours after being paroled, charismatic Danny Ocean (Clooney) handpicks a top-notch team of smooth operators to pocket $150 million--in one night! The mark: ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Benedict controls three of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas ... and Ocean’s sexy ex-wife (Roberts). In any other place they'd be bad guys, but Ocean and his crew stick to the rules: Don't hurt anybody. Don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it. And play the game like you've got nothing to lose. Are you in or out?",

        "text": "Ocean’s Eleven maintains the appropriate swagger and air of cool collectedness, but it’s hard to be impressed with its suavity as it bungles its own caper trail.\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nIt’s well - paced and completely entertaining and -- unlike its predecessor -- this take on Ocean's Eleven even has a semimeaningful plot.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nIs Ocean’s Eleven the coolest film ever made? It’s certainly a contender.\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nSteven Soderbergh and his cool cast accomplish what Lewis Milestone couldn’t with the original Vegas playboy Rat Pack back in the 1960s: they swing to the beat of the heist.\n\nOctober 15, 2022\n\nSoderbergh luxuriates in the sheer lazy pleasure of a straightforward big Hollywood vehicle. He drives it better than most, but this one stalls on him just the same.\n\nSeptember 17, 2022\n\nTwenty years on, Ocean's 11 has become a time capsule, capturing not only the moment between Las Vegas's split identities, but also the last go-round of the Movie Star era.\n\nDecember 19, 2021\n\nIt's a compulsively re-watchable, funny, exciting, and altogether fun movie, one of the best of director Steven Soderbergh's career. (20th anniversary)\n\nDecember 15, 2021"
