        "text": "Recently I’ve caught Ocean’s Eleven on my local channel network. I remember seeing it when it came out at the beginning of the millennium, so I decided to watch it after such a long time. The movie is still great, but what bothered me is the conversation over coffee the next day. My colleagues admired George Clooney’s hero Daniel Ocean as a fabulous project manager. Moreover, I found similar thoughts over the internet on specialized project management resources.\n\nI disagree. I don’t think that Daniel Ocean is a good project manager.\n\nIf you’re studying project management, you are or want to become a project manager, be my guest:) In this article, I’ll describe my analysis of the Ocean’s Eleven movie (and how to perform a robbery) from a project management perspective.\n\n1. Define Project Scope\n\nTalking about any project we begin with the project scope. Project scope is the part of project planning that involves determining project goals, project deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines, and costs. Defining project requirement clarity is a must. Don’t take the example of Danny, who didn’t tell his partner Rusty his real goal — to win Tess back.\n\nIt is important to identify limitations and possible risks. Among others in the movie one can name a technically complicated risky plan, ‘no blood’ strategy, avoid getting killed, caught, or Benedict finding out about their involvement.\n\nNext, involve correct stakeholders and define their aim:\n\nDanny’s participation is about the rivalry\n\nRusty’s participation is about the money\n\nReuben’s participation is about the rivalry\n\nOkay, here’s the problem. We’re stealing two things. And when push comes to shove, and you can’t have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember — Tess does not split eleven ways! (Rusty)\n\nLast but not least — change management. In a real project, changes are inevitable. To avoid disagreements by stakeholders, it is best to have strict change management processes in place. Rusty almost left the team, after finding out about Ocean’s ex. Basher also was close to calling Game Over before he found a solution to the power problem. Panic gripped Reuben when Danny was blacklisted.\n\n2. Find the Team\n\nIt will be nice working with proper villains again! (Basher)\n\nBelow is my vision of the Ocean’s Eleven:\n\nDanny’s team is a good example of a cross-functional team (it was far 2001 when the movie came out!). Cross-functional teams act faster, as they don’t rely on the legwork of other teams. They tend to tackle and solve problems right away themselves. It’s easily noticed, that there are up to 3–4 members tops in each scene. Several exceptions though take place during the kick-off meeting, the team building after the casino’s replica been made, and the robbery has taken place.\n\n3. Holding the Kick-Off meeting: project deliverables\n\n— I have a question, say we get into the cage, and through the security doors there and down the elevator we can’t move, and past the guards with the guns, and into the vault we can’t open… [] we’re just supposed to walk out of there with $150,000,000 in cash on us, without getting stopped?\n\n— Yeah.\n\nDanny delivered the bad and the good news as project deliverables: the project environment, the project definition, and their project goal. He followed his story with a WBS (work breakdown structure) — a simplified vision of the plan. He also estimated the deadline — the delivery date. Watch the video below — that’s a nice example of a project presentation.\n\n4. Create a Project Schedule\n\nI know more about casino security than any man alive, I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got locks, they got watchers, they got timers, they got vaults, they got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris! (Reuben)\n\nI enjoyed how the project was divided into tasks and clear outputs. What matters, all responsibilities were assigned to each of the team members. Most tasks are independent and being run in parallel. If possible blockers appear — throughout communication allows solving problems quite fast.\n\nIt is not shown in the film, but if you probably don’t see the hero for some time — he is working on the backlog = creating the vault replica.\n\n5. Deployment to Prod\n\n-You’re a thief and a liar.\n\n-I only lied about being a thief, I don’t do that anymore.\n\n-Steal?\n\n-Lie.\n\n(dialogue between Danny and Tess)\n\nThat’s what we bought the tickets for :) The robbery was like a well-rehearsed performance. Some details make it close to ideal. For example, when Benedict questions Linus about his work in the Nevada Gaming Commission it is shown how detailed team preparation was. Whoever was responsible for Risk Management has done his job well. I believe this hero also gave Linus a pair of working batteries.\n\nSo why not Danny?\n\nI’ve noticed most of the acts in the movie was orchestrated by Rusty. He is the key figure.\n\nIn the movie Danny’s management is limited to their trip to the California Institute of Advanced Science. That was poorly performed, as may have gone better. Given the fact, Danny withheld key information and drawn unnecessary attention int the casino, I believe Clooney’s hero needs more practical experience in the field of project management.\n\nEpilogue\n\nI wanted this analysis to be short, and I believe I’ve reached my goal. I have a couple of movies in mind, that can also be analyzed from a management perspective. If you have some thoughts — I’d be glad to hear from you. Here are some nostalgia quotes to make your day:\n\nMight as well call it whitejack.\n\nThey’ll be watching you like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.\n\nApparently, he’s got a record longer than my… well, it’s long.\n\nThanks for reading :)"
