It's been three years since Danny Ocean (GEORGE CLOONEY) and his crew - fronted by detail man Rusty Ryan (BRAD PITT), up-and-coming pickpocket Linus Caldwell (MATT DAMON), explosives expert Basher Tarr (DON CHEADLE) and safecracker Frank Catton (BERNIE MAC) - pulled off one of the most audacious and lucrative heists in history, robbing ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict (ANDY GARCIA) of every dime stored in his impenetrable Las Vegas vault. After splitting the $160 million take, each of the infamous Ocean's crew have tried to go straight, lay low and live a legit life...but that's proven to be a challenge, much to the chagrin of Danny's wife Tess (JULIA ROBERTS). When someone breaks Rule Number One and rats them out to Benedict, going straight is no longer an option. He wants his $160 million back – with interest – or else.",

        "text": "Twist after twist after twist is just not enough to save Ocean's Twelve.\n\nApril 28, 2024\n\nWith such a charismatic cast, it’s impossible for \"Ocean’s Twelve\" to be an awful bore. But it’s an underwhelming case of six of stars, half-a-dozen of the other that doesn’t let everyone, including the audience, in on the fun.\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nAn exercise in Rat Pack razzle dazzle, wrapped in enviable tailoring and topped off with 12 pairs of perfect white teeth, the film milks every last drop of fun from the easy onscreen camaraderie of the ultimate in-crowd.\n\nJuly 3, 2023\n\nIt’s utterly silly and featherweight, but Soderbergh knows how to make it swing and the fun-loving camaraderie he captures on camera is so convincing that you feel like a part of the fun.\n\nOctober 15, 2022\n\nThere is a general convoluted feel about this installment. There are too many additional characters battling for space amid the narrative's over-complicated backstory.\n\nMarch 27, 2020\n\nAn amiable sequel that doesnt really add much to the original, but does manage to have a feel-good nature and charm to it.\n\nNovember 18, 2019\n\nOcean's Twelve is busier, messier and thinner than its predecessor, and while it looks like the cast is having a blast and a half, the studied hipness can get so pleased with itself it borders on the smug.\n\nMarch 13, 2018"
