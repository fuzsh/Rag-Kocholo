Rather, the plastic is dispersed, forming massive âdebris fieldsâ. But that does not mean these areas arenât highly polluted and don’t require cleaning up. The average concentration of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is around 60 kg per square kilometer, and peaks at several hundred kg per square kilometer. For comparison: a few hundred kilometers from the patch youâd struggle to find values of 0.1 kg per square kilometer. A summary of the science of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can be found here and more details on the trash island misconception here.\n\nHow much plastic is in the ocean?\n\nQuantifying the amount of plastic in the ocean is not an easy feat, and new papers on the pervasiveness of plastic in the marine environment come out every week.\n\nIn our article published in Scientific Reports in 2019, we relied on models and statistics to estimate how much plastic was being emitted into the ocean and where it would end up.\n\nIn the article, we estimated that 107 and 290 million metric tons of plastic were emitted into the ocean between 1950 and 2015. Over this period, plastic output increased exponentially, and it continues to increase as global plastic production surges.\n\nPlastic pollution on a beach in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nPlastic extracted from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch with System 002\n\nDepending on the buoyancy of the plastic, its journey once it enters the ocean differs. Approximately 35.5% of the plastic entering the ocean is considered non-buoyant and can therefore be assumed to sink close to the ocean entry point. The rest (65.5%) is considered buoyant plastic, which will either a) beach onshore, b) sink to the seabed close to shore, or c) escape out into the ocean and eventually end up in the so-called garbage patches. While the latter fraction is the smallest of the three, it remains important as it moves the floating trash out of reach for cleanup efforts operating closer to shore.\n\nThe journey of a piece of plastic can be very long, beaching and re-entering the ocean multiple times, all the while slowly breaking down and releasing microplastics. It might also take years or even decades before a plastic piece has traveled all the way to a garbage patch.\n\nTo conclude, we need to stop plastic from entering the ocean. But to mitigate harm to the environment and limit the generation of further microplastics it is also essential to clean up the plastic that has made its way into the ocean.\n\nTo learn more, also see these FAQs and pages:\n\nOcean Plastic Pollution Explained\n\nWhat types of plastics do you find in the middle of the ocean?\n\nWhat are microplastics, and macroplastics and why may they be harmful?\n\nWhat is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?\n\nPlastic Tracker – Simulate a journey for a piece of plastic from anywhere in the world\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of plastic pollution in the ocean?\n\nOur cleanup technology for Oceans\n\nOur cleanup technology for Rivers\n\nIs the plastic all at the ocean surface, or deeper down as well?\n\nIn 2014 and 2015 The Ocean Cleanup organized several expeditions to measure the vertical distribution of plastic, in high resolution for the top five meters of the ocean. Results were published in Biogeosciences and Nature Scientific Reports.\n\nThe smaller the pieces get, the more sensitive they are to mixing due to wind and wave turbulence. The measurements showed that even the microplastics stay on or near the surface in turbulent seas. The highest concentrations of microplastics were found directly on the surface and quickly went to trace concentrations when at only a few meters of depth. Larger objects, which comprise most of the mass of plastic in the ocean, are more buoyant and are found almost directly at the ocean surface.\n\nIt is important to note that weâre referring to the floating fraction of plastic. Part of the plastic that enters the ocean is of a plastic type that is heavier than water. However, most packaging and fishing gear (the two primary sources of ocean plastic) is made of buoyant types of plastic (Polyethylene and Polypropylene), and most life can be found in the top part of the ocean, which is why The Ocean Cleanup focuses on the floating plastic.\n\nThe vertical distribution of ocean plastic in wind condition that are average for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (left) and more windy conditions (right). Derived from Kooi et al., 2016.\n\nIs it true that most of the plastic pieces are tiny (microplastics)?\n\nAlthough microplastics are most abundant by count, our reconnaissance of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch revealed that 92% of the plastics are still large objects in terms ofÂ mass. The smallest size class we quantified, pieces smaller than 1.5mm, accounts for just 0.77% of the mass.\n\nCompare it to standing next to Mount Everest while holding a handful of pebbles. While the pebbles in your hand are more abundant by count than the mountain (for which the count equals 1), the mountain, obviously, contains more rock than your hand does. As you can see, itâs the mass that counts (pun intended).\n\nSo, most of the plastic floating in the ocean garbage patches is still intact as large objects, which is even more reason to go and clean it up â before the 92% breaks down into more and more small pieces.\n\nMost plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is contained in large objects. Lebreton et al., 2018\n\nWhat are microplastics, and macroplastics and why may they be harmful?\n\nMicroplastics are plastic objects smaller than 5 millimeters in size. They can consist of plastic fragments, flakes, fibers, or pre-production pellets (also known as nurdles). We differentiate between primary microplastics, which are plastic pieces produced in that size (nurdles, cosmetic microbeads, etc.), and secondary microplastics, which come from the degradation of larger objects (found in the form of fragments, fibers, paint flakes, etc.).\n\nExamples of secondary microplastics; plastic fragments stemming from larger objects\n\nMacroplastics are typically categorized as anything larger than 5 millimeters. However, at The Ocean Cleanup, we differentiate between mesoplastics (0.5 â 5 cm), macroplastics (5 â 50 cm), and megaplastics (>50 cm). This is to reflect the wide variation of sizes in plastic pollution. As larger objects left in the environment may slowly break down into smaller pieces, monitoring and documenting the full-size spectrum of plastic pollution and its evolution over time is essential.\n\nMacroplastics being sorted on board the support vessel of System 002, in January 2022\n\nExample of megaplastic pieces caught during the System 002 mission\n\nOf all the size classes, microplastic accumulation poses the greatest risk of harming the environment. Because of their small size, their bioavailability increases, meaning they can potentially impact many more species than larger objects. The ingestion of microplastics can result in physical damage to organisms. Concerns have also been raised surrounding the toxicity of plastic ingestion, as plastic can carry possible harmful chemicals (either through absorption or leaching). Finally, as pathogens and parasite vectors have also been identified on microplastics, there is an increased risk for ecosystems. However, there is still no consensus on how damaging microplastics are to the environment, and their impact depends on the plastic size, environment, organisms, and level of exposure.\n\nHow plastic pollution travels up the food chain\n\nFloating macroplastics also have apparent impacts on marine megafauna through ingestion or entanglement. As they degrade over time, they can generate large numbers of microplastics â and like their smaller counterparts, macroplastics can carry chemicals and invasive species. The increasing accumulation of floating plastic âraftsâ on the ocean surface provides a gateway for species to move from one continent to another like never before, representing a real risk for biodiversity due to species invasion.\n\nLearn more about ocean plastic pollution here.\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of plastic pollution in the oceans?\n\nBecause plastic is such a persistent material, the ecological, economic and eco-toxicological effects of plastic pollution are all long-term. These include:\n\nPhysical impact on marine life: entanglement, ingestion, starvation\n\nChemical impact: the buildup of persistent organic pollutants like PCBs and DDT\n\nTransport of invasive species and pollutants from polluted rivers to remote areas in the ocean\n\nEconomic impact: damage to fisheries, shipping, and tourism\n\nIn recent years, the amount of attention focused on very small plastic particles has increased dramatically, but little is yet known about their long-term effects on the environment. The microplastics The Ocean Cleanup is focused on preventing is the so-called secondary microplastics, i.e. plastic fragments resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic debris at land and sea.\n\nFor more information, see our Ocean Plastic Explained pageÂ as well as our research about the persistent organic pollutants on the plastic.\n\nWhat types of plastic do you find in the middle of the ocean vs closer to shore?\n\nNot all plastic makes its way to the garbage patches once released into the aquatic environment. During our expeditions and cleanup missions, we have mainly seen and caught HDPE plastics (High-Density Polyethylene), with a smaller fraction comprised of LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene) and PP (Polypropylene). Their density is lower than water, which makes them stay afloat and more likely to persist in the ocean for long periods.\n\nExamples of plastic products we find in the ocean, typically made with HDPE, are:\n\nFishing equipment, ghost nets\n\nBottle caps\n\nToothbrushes\n\nDetergent bottles\n\nShampoo, conditioner, shower gel bottles\n\nSome types of beverage bottles\n\nCrates\n\nPieces of buckets\n\nToys\n\nGhost net lifted onboard the vessel in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, during the System 001/B mission 2019\n\nExamples of plastic caught during the System 001/B mission in 2019.\n\nOther plastic types usually wash up on the shore, or sink close to the coast. Examples of these plastic types are:\n\nPlastic bags\n\nCigarette filters\n\nPET bottles (note: the cap does float)\n\nStyrofoam food- and beverage containers\n\nStraws\n\nTextiles made of plastic\n\nWith our Interceptor solutions, we aim to catch plastics before it beaches, sinks, or escapes to the ocean. Our ocean systems will tackle the legacy plastic already out there, as it can take decades before plastic pieces make it to the ocean garbage patches.\n\nLearn more about plastic becomes ocean plastic on our Ocean Plastic Explained page.\n\nWho should be responsible for cleaning the gyres?\n\nSince the accumulation zones are located outside of national territories, no single party is seen as responsible for the cleanup of the plastic pollution. Hence, intergovernmental bodies or independent private initiatives are the only entities likely willing to tackle this problem.\n\nHow can I help prevent plastic pollution?\n\nThere are several steps you can take to prevent plastic pollution, but some depend on recycling facilities in your area. Here are a few tips:\n\nSpread awareness for plastic pollution\n\nOrganize beach, river bank or land cleanups (and start a fundraiser for The Ocean Cleanup while doing your local cleanup)\n\nReduce your use of disposable plastics (including microbeads in cosmetics)\n\nMake sure you dispose of trash properly\n\nWash your synthetic clothing as little as possible\n\nReuse and recycle whenever possible\n\nSupport us financially with a donationÂ or apply to The Ocean Cleanup to help us develop our system\n\nLobby to your (local) government\n\nWill cleaning just incentivize people to continue polluting?\n\nThis assumes littering is a conscious action. Plastic enters the oceans primarily through negligence; unconscious actions of people that do not think about (or are unaware of) the consequence of the action. Once the consequences of oneâs actions are raised to the conscious level, people can make rational cost-benefit analyses of their actions and would probably think twice about throwing their rubbish into the environment. And what better thing can one do to raise the topic into the public awareness than by executing a very visible project like The Ocean Cleanup?\n\nRight now, the oceanic plastic problem is quite an abstract problem. Since the patches arenât solid masses of plastic they’re difficult to photograph, and, in any case, they are very far away. By lifting the plastic out of the ocean and showing the world mountains of trash coming into port, we remove the abstractness of the problem and bring it much closer to home.\n\nCleaning plastic from the ocean, as well as all the R&D required to make it happen, also helps to increase the available knowledge of the problem, as our numerous scientific publications have shown. This, in turn, allows us to develop better technologies and policies to also address the prevention-side of the equation.\n\nThe moral hazard argument can also be countered by the Broken Window Theory, which says that that visible signs of social disobedience (graffiti, litter, etc.) promotes more of such behavior. People are, for example, more likely to litter when the park they walk in is already littered. By making the ocean clean again, we avoid the idea that the oceans are already full of plastic and that one extra piece of plastic wonât make much of a difference. Saying that the oceans canât be cleaned up and the only thing we can do is to try to not make it worse is a very depressing message. If the oceans are truly polluted forever, why bother trying to do something about it?\n\nFollowing the logic of the moral hazard in reverse, it looks like the best way to stop plastic pollution will be to stop collecting litter from the streets and remove any waste infrastructure because these things all give people an incentive to create more waste in the first place. Obviously, that is not true. The data shows countries with the least amount of waste infrastructure have the highest rates of plastic leakage.\n\nAs always, it is important to make a balanced assessment between a hypothetical risk in the future, versus a certain impact today.\n\nHow do your work and research impact local and international communities?\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup provides data and knowledge from scientific research and field operations for governments and institutions to consider when discussing new policies and legal frameworks to regulate plastic pollution.\n\nWe were recently granted Consultative Status by the United Nations, which will allow us to have a voice and play a role in formal deliberations with UN bodies, NGOs, and member state governments. The international community is currently negotiating a new United Nations Treaty on plastic pollution and conserving marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\n\nIn every project we initiate worldwide, we seek partnerships with civic and private waste management authorities and strive to ensure the waste caught by the Interceptor is managed responsibly.\n\nIn times of globalization, we all share the responsibility to create a better global framework and a cleaner environment for the next generation\n\nOcean cleanup system\n\nThe concept\n\nIs the cleanup system already installed and cleaning up the ocean?\n\nYes. We have been cleaning in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch since July 2021, when System 002 captured our first plastic. System 03, our current cleanup system in the GPGP, was deployed in August 2023.\n\nYou can follow System 03âs progress on our Dashboard.\n\nCan you rid the oceans of plastic entirely?\n\nWe will never be able to remove every single piece of plastic from the oceans. However, by intercepting plastic in rivers, and cleaning what is already out there, a significant decrease of floating debris in the oceanâs accumulation zones can be achieved. Our aim is to remove 90% of floating ocean plastic by 2040.\n\nCan you provide an overall solution to ocean plastic pollution?\n\nSolving the entire problem will require radical changes at the individual, corporate, and governmental levels of society. In addition to these efforts, cleanup of the oceanic accumulation zones is necessary; plastic in these zones does not go away by itself and it creates an ecological risk as it breaks down into more dangerous microplastics. Intercepting plastic before it reaches the ocean, rather than waiting for policy/societal change, will also help in limiting the effects plastic has on sea life, economies, and human health.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup can significantly reduce the concentration of plastic in the ocean garbage patches and work with stakeholders all over the world to intercept plastic in the worldâs most polluted rivers. With the application of these solutions, our aim is to reduce 90% of the floating plastic pollution by 2040.\n\nWill the systems interrupt shipping pathways?\n\nThe ocean garbage patches are vast (three times the size of France) and vessels crossing through it are rare â on average there are less than five within its boundaries.\n\nTherefore, we expect minimal interactions with other vessels and will not be interrupting active shipping pathways. By having an active system, we can coordinate with other ships and change course when appropriate. We will put out a notice to mariners in that area, and there will be signs and lights on the ship and on the retention system to ensure it is visible. We will also be able to contact other vessels to inform them of our presence if necessary. If there are multiple systems in the area, we will follow the same procedure.\n\nHow will the systems withstand severe storms?\n\nBecause the cleanup systems are meant to stay in the patch for long periods of time, it is important that our systems can withstand the forces of the ocean. We will continually monitor the loads in the system and adapt the speed and span to lower the loads in the case of rough seas. We will also monitor weather forecasts and plan a trajectory to avoid storms, and by understanding the patch climate, we can plan to operate in less critical locations. In the case of a particularly severe storm, the system can be temporarily withdrawn from the operation.\n\nHow do you make sure the system does not break?\n\nOur system was designed with minimal components and high flexibility, and minimizing opportunities for breakages was always in our minds. WeÂ continually monitor the system with loadcells and adapt the speed and span to lower the loads in the case of rough seas. We also monitor weather forecasts and plan our route to avoid storms. By following weather forecasts, we also aim to operate in areas where conditions are more favorable. In the case of a particularly severe storm, the system can be temporarily withdrawn from the operation. Inspections and repairs are always conducted during initial deployment and final recovery for each trip. When expected wear and tear occurs, we can usually fix these components on deck during idle periods, for example, during transit to and from port.\n\nWill the systems impact sea life?\n\nThe driver behind our mission to rid the worldâs oceans of plastic is to make the ocean a healthier place for all life that benefits from it, so our number one priority is safety for the environment and our crew. While the overall risks of our operations were found to be negligible, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) conducted by CSA Ocean Sciences determined that some interactions are likely with some species of fish, turtles, and certain plankton and neustonic organisms with limited mobility, so we must minimize this impact as much as possible.\n\nThe EIA notes that the long-term impact on marine species of the removal of large amounts of plastic and marine debris should be beneficial, and it is unlikely that any potentially impacted species will decrease in number. As data is still limited, there is uncertainty about the residual impact our operations may have on these communities; therefore, we aim to help fill these knowledge gaps by continuing to collect data during our operations and sharing this with the scientific community.\n\nOur systems are designed to be safe for the marine environment; speed (slower than a casual stroll), materials, and shape have all been chosen to minimize negative side effects. We have also incorporated mitigation measures into our systems to deter marine animals from interacting with the system or provide easy exit routes in case they do â and we continue to develop new mitigation measures as we operate. Alongside increasing our underwater cameras, System 03 introduced a new Marine Animal Safety Hatch, which can activate to encourage any animal in the Retention Zone to exit, further limiting any chances for an animal to become trapped. While extracting plastic, dedicated Environmental Observers and crew are present and monitoring the area. If necessary, we can -and do- halt cleanup operations based on the event severity level.\n\nAs we continue to develop our technology and learn more about the natural behaviors of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and its wildlife, we will adapt as needed to ensure our net impact on this environment remains as positive as possible.\n\nRead this Update: âHow we Ensure an Environmentally Sound Cleanupâ for more information about mitigation measures.\n\nWill the systems have a Fish Aggregating Device (FAD) effect?\n\nFish are often attracted to floating structures found offshore, such as flotsam, and oil and gas platforms. This also applies to the plastic that is currently in the ocean, including large ghost nets. By collecting this plastic, fish may gather around our system temporarily. However, because the retention zone is emptied every two weeks, and the entire system may be removed from the water every four weeks, these FAD effects are removed, and the fish disperse.\n\nLearn more about how the system is designed for limited environmental impact in this YouTube video.\n\nWhat are you doing to offset your fuel emissions for your offshore activity?\n\nLimiting our impact on the environment is at the core of each decision we make. As with any large-scale activity at sea, currently, consuming fuel is inevitable. With System 03, this is primarily related to the vessels operating the system. Since the start of our activities in the GPGP in 2018, we have been offsetting all carbon emissions related to our operations following a third-party assessment of our total carbon footprint. We will continue to do so with S03, while continuously working on minimizing emissions. Our offshore partner, Maersk, will continue to develop the most fuel-efficient vessel routing and logistics for our scale-up and hope to further incorporate sustainable fuels, with the aim to integrate renewable fueled assets into our operations. We are also working on a full cost-benefit assessment to determine our net impact on the environment.\n\nHow has the concept changed over time?\n\nThe main shifts in our concept have involved the switch from a moored system to a drifting system and later to an active system. We learned this has many advantages: higher plastic capture efficiency, reduced deployment and maintenance costs, and reduced risk of system damage due to lower forces from wind, waves, and currents, to name a few.\n\nSystem 001 suffered from fatigue issues and could not keep a sufficient speed difference with the plastic. The learnings gained from System 001 were implemented into a redesign: System 001/B, a smaller, modular version that could be adjusted offshore if necessary. Although we did successfully capture and retain plastic, we concluded that we could not effectively scale up with this design. Therefore, with System 002, we developed a new approach that uses active propulsion to move slightly faster than the plastic continuously. With an actively propelled system, we will be able to catch plastic more quickly and efficiently because contrary â to the passive approach â we can now direct our system towards areas with high concentrations of plastic.\n\nSystem 002 received proof of technology in October 2021. We continued to harvest plastic System 002 while beginning the gradual transition to System 03, which was completed in August 2023. System 03 is not only significantly bigger (wings length and depth + retention zone length) but also features upgraded system components to reduce overtopping and increase integrity and reliability – improving uptime and capture efficiency.\n\nAs we have scaled up the size of our system, we have also increased our measures to safeguard marine life and the environment during our operations. As well as the elements already in place with System 002, we added additional underwater cameras all along the Retention Zone of System 03. These cameras are monitored by protected species observers (PSOs) on board. System 03 also has a newly developed Marine Animal Safety Hatch, which can be activated to create an opening for the animal to exit while closing off the rest of the Retention Zone and preventing the animal from becoming trapped. This function also prevents us from losing our entire plastic catch when we are required to free an animal. The MASH complements the other (already existing) openings on the underside of the retention zone.\n\nSystem 03 was deployed on its first cleaning trip in August 2023. As with any other change and upgrade, we need to test and learn how to operate it efficiently before deciding how to move forward. We aim for System 03 to be the blueprint for scale-up to a full fleet. Stay tuned to follow the learnings from System 03 on our website and social media.\n\nDid you conduct environmental impact assessments for your ocean systems?\n\nYes, we have conducted environmental impact assessments for our previous ocean systems, as well as the current one operating in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch â System 03. You can see the EIA for this system here.\n\nBefore we scale up to a fleet of systems, we will reference our original assessment and conduct additional EIAs based on any design changes and the scope of the operations. We will only move forward with deployment once we have confirmation from new EIAs that our activities will not adversely affect the environment.\n\nRead more about out prevention and mitigation measures in this blogpost.\n\nWhat impact will your cleanup technology have on floating organisms (neuston) in the ocean?\n\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment conducted by CSA (independent third-party) for our technology estimates that impacts of System 03 on Neuston likely range from negligible to low. However, we acknowledge that it is difficult to determine what positive or negative impact will occur between our technology and floating organisms (neuston) as little is known about the interaction of these organisms with this offshore environment, plastic, and our technology. There is still much to learn, hence the need for continued research. Fortunately, our operations provide a unique platform to conduct regular and systematic research on this under-studied topic, helping us to understand our potential impact on the marine environment and providing greater insights into these organisms. We are currently investigating the seasonal dynamics of neuston and how they relate to plastic accumulation in the GPGP and beyond.\n\nTo read more about our findings, preventions, and mitigations in the System 002 campaign, you can visit this update. See also our update on research on neuston in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\nWhat are the nicknames of your ocean cleanup systems?\n\nSYSTEM 001 â WILSON\n\nSystem 001 was nicknamed Wilson in reference to the volleyball that is Tom Hanksâ friend in the film Cast Away, while he is stranded on a small island in the South Pacific. Wilson is lost in a storm and floats away. His fate remains unknown, however, oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer suggests he could have ended up in the garbage patch between Australia and South America, floating for years in a vortex, or becoming washed ashore on a small island somewhere in the gyre.\n\nSYSTEM 001/B â WILSONâ² (WILSON PRIMED)\n\nAfter completing design upgrades based on the insights from System 001, System 001/B was engineered. System 001/B took on the name Wilsonâ² (Wilson primed) as a logical step since the prime is used in mathematics to generate variable names for items that are similar â therefore, Wilsonâ² is a system related to or derived from Wilson.\n\nSYSTEM 002 â JENNY\n\nContinuing the Tom Hanks theme, Jenny was chosen as the name for System 002. Tom Hanks named his boat in the film Forrest Gump âJennyâ, after the girl he was in love with. This boat was driven by active propulsion and caught trash. With System 002âs adapted design and active propulsion, we aim to catch plastic more efficiently and effectively than previous systems.\n\nSYSTEM 03 â JOSH\n\nGiven that System 03 had to be big (2.1 km or 1.3 miles in length) to increase the catch efficiency, we had an easy reference to the next Tom Hanks movie â BIG. The movie is about a kid named Josh, who is tired of being limited by the rules of adults. When visiting a fair, he sees a wishing slot machine and makes a wish to become an adult. This machine magically grants his wish, and he is transformed the next morning into an adult (played by Tom Hanks). So, Josh is a fitting name for System 03, as the wish to be big became a reality.\n\nWhy did you move from a passive to an active approach to clean the oceans?\n\nBased on our learnings with the first two iterations and the development work that we undertook after those deployments, we concluded to need to make this pivot to improve our cleanup efficiency, keep it affordable and make it scalable.\n\nWhat is new in System 03?\n\nSystem 03 is The Ocean Cleanupâs third ocean cleanup system designed by The Ocean Cleanup and deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) in August 2023.\n\nSystem 03 is not only bigger than its predecessor, System 002, but much better. We have upgraded System 002 components to make our cleanup more efficient and economical. At peak efficiency, System 03 can clean an area the size of a football field in five seconds.\n\nThe system now extends deeper under the surface and catches plastic floating underneath. Yet, this does not represent a further danger to marine life. Regarding mitigation measures, System 03 comes with MASH: the Marine Animal Safety Hatch. If an animal is spotted in the Retention Zone, the MASH is activated, blocking any further entrance into the Retention Zone and giving the animal a clear way out. Additionally, we can ensure that animals exit the Retention Zone without compromising the plastic catch.\n\nSystem 03 is the result of years of testing and experimentation. We hope it becomes the blueprint for the fleet we need to rid the oceans of plastics.\n\nWant to know more about System 03? Visit the Update: System 03: A Beginner’s Guide for answers to the 10 commonly asked questions.\n\nCapture efficiency / Vertical distribution\n\nHow long will it take to clean up a gyre?\n\nA complete cleanup of a gyre is unrealistic, but our ambition remains to clean up 90% of ocean plastic by 2040. To ensure we clean up as much plastic as possible, intercepting plastic from rivers, the major sources of ocean plastic, will need to continue to occur simultaneously.\n\nTo what depths will you be able to extract plastic?\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup focuses on the floating fraction of plastics. Since most are located between the surface and a depth of two meters, the cleanup system will be designed to clean up only the plastic in this upper layer of the water column. System 03 has a screen that extends 4 meters deep.\n\nFor more information about the distribution of plastic in the water column, read our update about vertical distributionâ¯hereâ¯(2016) and our research on the fallout of microplasticâ¯hereâ¯(2020).\n\nWhich sizes of plastic can your system capture?\n\nWe are specifically targeting plastics larger than 15 millimeters, but we do not yet know the exact size the system will be able to capture.\n\nEven though sub-centimeter-sized plastic represents a significant share of the plastic count, the mass is made up of larger objects. These larger objects will eventually turn into microplastics if not extracted, so our goal is to prevent that from happening.\n\nHow much plastic can you remove from the ocean?\n\nOur aim is to clean up 90% of floating ocean plastic by 2040. The cleanup needs to be paired with river plastic interception on land in order to ensure lasting effects.\n\nRiver Interceptorsâ¢\n\nThe technology\n\nWhat is an Interceptorâ¢?\n\nTo rid the worldâs oceans of plastic, we must remove legacy waste and prevent plastic from entering the ocean. Because rivers are the primary source of ocean plastic, this is where we must take action.\n\nThe Interceptor Original is the worldâs first scalable solution for preventing river debris from entering the ocean. Designed for series production, the Interceptor Original relies on natural forces (river currents and solar power) to extract debris flowing through rivers and ensure this waste never makes its way to the ocean.\n\nWhile we designed our Interceptor Original to be suitable for a wide range of rivers, our understanding of the differences among these 1000 rivers has shown us that a single solution would not be sufficient to handle all conditions experienced in scale-up. Thus, we are now creating a family of Interceptor solutions, a toolkit we can use to apply the best solution for each specific location. Our toolkit currently consists of the Interceptor Original, the Interceptor Barrier, the Interceptor Tender, the Interceptor Barricade, and the Interceptor Guard. To learn more about our river technology, check out our River page.\n\nHow does the Interceptorâ¢ Original work?\n\nThe Interceptor Original is a barrier and conveyor belt system that concentrates and extracts plastic from rivers. The flow path is uninterrupted due to the catamaran design, which allows plastic to flow freely into the device and water to continue with the current.\n\nThe barrier concentrates the debris as it floats with the current and directs it to a permeable conveyer belt. At this point, the waste is transferred up the belt to an automated shuttle that distributes the waste between one of six containers located on a separate barge. Once full, the barge is exchanged, and the waste is transferred to a local waste management facility. Apart from unloading, discharging, and reinstalling the waste collection barge, the Interceptorâ¢, due to its solar power, does not require polluting and expensive fuels, allowing for efficient operating costs and minimal labor requirements for its activities.\n\nTo learn more, see our river page.\n\nWhere are your Interceptorsâ¢ currently deployed?\n\nCurrently, there are Interceptor Originals in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, the United States (L.A. County), and Vietnam, with more deployments planned for Thailand and Indonesia. The Interceptor Barrier, Tender, and Guard have been deployed in Kingston, Jamaica, and you can find our Interceptor Barricade in Guatemala. Check out our Interceptor deployments on our Dashboard.\n\nWhat are theÂ technical specs and the size of the Interceptorâ¢ Original?Â Â\n\nThe Interceptor size is 8M x 24M x 5M with a waste collection (barge) capacity of 50 MÂ³; it is fully autonomous with an off-grid power generation, remote monitoring dashboard, automated extraction control, 4G data uplink to the cloud, and more.\n\nThe Interceptor pontoon weighs 45.2 metric tons and the barge with the dumpsters weighs 10.2 metric tons.\n\nFor more details, see our Interceptor Original page.\n\nHow much waste can the Interceptor Original extract?\n\nThe Interceptor Original has 6 barges with a total capacity of 50 m3. When the barges are full they are emptied by local operators. The amount removed per river will vary depending on local conditions such as elevation, slope, annual rainfall, etc.\n\nWe also recognize that each river is unique, and our measures may need to be adapted to fit a specific river, such as installing a double barrier or using a different Interceptor Solution. See our Rivers page for more details on our family or Interceptor solutions.\n\nSurrounding environment\n\nHow do you manage boat traffic near Interceptors?\n\nInterceptors are placed in the river only after consultation with relevant public bodies and stakeholders, while considering all applicable rules and regulations. That said, the barrier of the Interceptor does not have to span the entire width of the river â because we can identify the natural plastic accumulation paths in a river, or âhotlinesâ, we can place the Interceptor in a location that prevents the majority of plastic flowing through the river while still allowing vessels to pass by. If this hotline is not present, we can create an artificial one using a second barrier upstream.\n\nWill the Interceptors harm the environment?\n\nPrior to each Interceptor deployment, we work with local and global partners including expert consultants to scan for environmental and social impacts unique to the specific conditions of each river and to comply with local environmental laws and regulations. We commissioned third-party environmental and social impact scanning (ESIS) with Royal Haskoning, Arcadis, and Witteveen+Bos for the deployment areas in question. With an ESIS we estimate the possible impact on the environment. To date, the assessments have shown the impact to tend towards negligible. In tandem, we are developing monitoring processes to better understand this possible impact â with some pilot efforts currently active. While we are still very much in a learning phase, for each deployment, we will conduct additional ESISs and develop monitoring efforts for verification\n\nDid you conduct environmental impact assessments for the Interceptors?\n\nBefore our operations commence, The Ocean Cleanup takes several steps into consideration of local communities, wildlife, and habitats.\n\nPrior to each Interceptor deployment, we work with local and global partners including expert consultants to scan for environmental and social impacts unique to the specific conditions of each river and to comply with local environmental laws and regulations. We commissioned third-party environmental and social impact scanning (ESIS) with Royal Haskoning, Arcadis, and Witteveen+Bos for the existing and upcoming deployment locations.\n\nThese reports are shared with the necessary regulatory stakeholders for each project when applicable, but as they involve multiple third parties, which differ for each Interceptor, it is not appropriate for us to publicly share the assessments at this time. For each Interceptor project, we will conduct additional ESIS assessments prior to deployment. Since the approach and depth of the assessments can vary, we are learning how to best conduct, standardize, and share environmental and social impact scanning. Part of this process includes the development of management plans with monitoring and mitigation protocols, including recording occurrences of animal interaction and collected debris composition. This information is used to continuously improve our technology and methodology to reduce impacts.\n\nConsidering that we are still developing this process, our intention is to provide more information here in the future, including a summary of the results of existing impact assessments.\n\nRiver strategy\n\nWho operates the Interceptorâ¢?\n\nFor each deployment location, we will collaborate with a local operator and governments to ensure it is safely and legally implemented and that its operations are well-maintained.\n\nWho will own the Interceptorâ¢?\n\nWe currently expect that the respective operator of an Interceptor will take ownership of the system. If necessary, ownership can be assisted through sponsorships or low-interest loans. Where local circumstances require a different solution to keep the momentum, we will look into it. For us, the impact is more important than the ownership.\n\nWhy did you start with developing technologies for rivers?\n\nWe could have chosen to commit to cleanup only, while others focused on the prevention side. Yet, after two years, we decided to also tackle the other part of the equation. The Ocean Cleanup cannot be successful if the input isnât halted, especially considering the amount of plastic entering the oceans continues to increase, rather than decrease.\n\nHow will you be able to tackle 1000 rivers?\n\nOur ambition is to tackle the pollution problem in the 1000 most polluted rivers by applying our technology, knowledge, experience, and network. We have a toolkit, the Interceptor Solutions, that can work in the majority of these rivers, but we will get to our goal much faster if everyone helps â this means better waste infrastructure, awareness, education, collaboration between initiatives, and more.\n\nWe know the goal of 1000 rivers is ambitious, but it is a necessary one.\n\nWhy not prevent plastic from reaching rivers in the first place?\n\nPrevention is indeed a necessary part of the entire solution; it is one of many options, but it is a much more complex issue, which likely requires a mix of legislative change, infrastructure change, and advancements in materials science. All efforts to prevent and remove plastic from our waterways are necessary, but, as a technology foundation, we have decided to focus on what we know best: technology. Furthermore, we believe this is the path that could yield the fastest results, which is key considering the urgency of the problem.\n\nWe go into more details on the topic in this update: Why Rivers are the Key to Rapidly Stopping Plastic Pollution.\n\nWhy was the river project kept a secret at first?\n\nWe kept this project under the radar to avoid raising false expectations. Our objective was to be able to announce a project that was actually working and when we had systems operating, we believed it was the right time to unveil this to the wider public.\n\nDuring the initial development phase, funds for this project were earmarked by specific donors and were, therefore, allocated as promised. Because we are a nonprofit, we did touch on the subject in our yearly annual report, albeit succinctly, to avoid unnecessary external pressure during this crucial period.\n\nIs this a replacement for your ocean cleanup technology?Â Â\n\nWe project that we can remove 90% of floating ocean plastic by 2040, and to truly rid the worldâs oceans of plastic we must do two things: cleanup legacy plastic and stop it from entering the ocean. Both are necessary to achieve this mission, so we will continue our efforts in the ocean to ensure we have a safe and healthy ocean in the future.\n\nBecause plastic in the oceans is persistent, the only way to reduce the amount of plastic in the oceans is to also clean up the legacy. No ocean cleanup, no clean ocean.\n\nPlastic extraction and usage\n\nOceans\n\nWhat will you do with the plastic once it’s extracted from the oceans?\n\nWe want to give the plastic collected from the ocean a new life. Our plan is to work with partners to recycle the plastic and transform it into durable plastic products. By recycling the collected ocean plastic into useful products that are made with certified plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, we aim to make the cleanup operational costs, to a large extent, financially self-sustainable.\n\nTo demonstrate this is possible, we have already transformed the catch from our prototype System 001/B into our first product â sunglasses. To learn more, visit theoceancleanup.com/sunglasses/Â\n\nPlease note: the sunglasses are out of stock as of February 2022.Â\n\nHow will you extract the plastic from the ocean?\n\nIn simple terms: when our system is operating, the Retention Zone acts like a huge bag, collecting the plastic guided into the bag by the systemâs wings. Once the bag is full, we take it out of the water, empty the contents onto the deck of our vessels, and put it back to collect another load.\n\nIn a bit more detail: Once we see the Retention Zone is full of plastic, both ends of the system are attached to a single vessel. A buoy is connected to the extraction vessel, activating a choke to close off the Retention Zone opening, allowing it to be rolled onto the ship deck.\n\nThe extraction vessel has a crane to lift the Retention Zone, emptying the extracted plastic onto the deck below.\n\nOnce the plastic is on deck, the Retention Zone is re-secured and placed into the water to return to cleaning. We have many videos of our extractions on our YouTube channel.\n\nWhy do you transport the plastic to land instead of processing it at sea?\n\nAfter exploring the options of recycling the plastic at sea, our team has determined that processing plastic on land is more practical. Our first catch was made with recycled ghost nets from Mission One made into sunglasses. To learn more, visit theoceancleanup.com/sunglasses/. Â Please note: We are out of stock as of February 2022 and will not make more products of our own. Instead, we will partner with companies that will be using our ocean-certified plastic in their product lines.\n\nCan my company use the plastic you have caught in the ocean?\n\nIn October 2020, we launched our first product made with plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch: The Ocean Cleanup Sunglasses. These sold out in February 2022. With this proof of concept, we were able to show that it was possible to make high-quality products from our catch. We want to ensure that the collected plastic continues to be seen as a material with value. By recycling the collected plastic into durable products, we help fund the continued cleanup. We also want to ensure that we have a plan to keep the products out of the environment when they reach their end of life.\n\nWe have decided not to be a plastic supplier, but rather we will use the collected plastic as part of a larger-scale partnership with companies who can use it in their products. Our Global Partnership with Kia is a good example. Through this multi-year agreement, Kia will provide funds and in-kind contributions. In addition, their experience in product design, development, manufacturing, and go-to-market strategies will help to create a resource circulation system by integrating part of our catch into their production and value chain process. The end products will be durable to avoid harvested plastics ending up back in the environment. To ensure maximum impact, as our plastic supply is small in comparison to the plastic industry, we take this selective approach with our catch.\n\nTo learn more, visit our Waste Management and Recycling page, and reach out to us via our contact form, to discuss collaboration opportunities.\n\nWhy don’t you use the plastic for fuel on the vessels?\n\nIn line with our waste management policy, our primary focus is on recycling the collected plastic. We are currently exploring alternatives for the fractions of the waste that cannot be mechanically recycled. Turning waste into fuel for the vessels required for our ocean system operations could be a promising option for this reject fraction, but there are many technical and logistical challenges that we would have to investigate prior to implementation.\n\nTo read more about what we are doing with the waste collected, see our Waste Management and Recycling page.\n\nWhy is the plastic you catch in the ocean so clean?\n\nWe sometimes receive the question: why do some of the plastic pieces shown in our System 002 catch videos look so clean, compared to plastic pollution people are used to seeing closer to shore (i.e., washed up on coastlines).\n\nMany factors influence the growth of organisms on the plastic and the weathering of the floating plastic debris at sea. For example, the waters of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) contain far fewer nutrients when compared to coastal waters. This is because the GPGP is far from land and, therefore, far from key nutrient sources. Furthermore, very little nutrient-rich deep water rises to the surface within this region. Fewer nutrients mean less ideal environment for biofouling â meaning cleaner-looking items.\n\nAdditionally, the plastics rub against each other while in the retention zone of the system, meaning barnacle growth on the outside of the objects often falls off.\n\nRegardless, the plastic is not always as clean as it may appear in the catch videos, which generally show the whole catch in one overview rather than zooming in on specific pieces. Biofouling is present on the plastic, especially in cracks and inside. Biofouling is usually more common on parts submerged in the water. The parts that remain at the surface are exposed to more UV radiation and are typically free from biofouling.\n\nBiofouling can be seen under, inside, and in the crevasses of several of the items.\n\nBarnacles in a piece of a basket, extracted by System 002\n\nAdditionally, some biofouling is often easier to see when plastic is submerged underwater, as species like sea anemones then spread their tentacles; when they are out of the water, they make themselves smaller and are more difficult to see.\n\nIt is also important to note that not all pieces of plastic are the same. It is possible that an object that has been in the water for years has much less biofouling than an object spending only a couple of days in coastal waters due to polymer type and production process. We primarily find fishing gear in our GPGP catch. This gear is made to persist for long periods in the marine environment, often containing additives in the polymers to reduce the amount of life growing on them, ensuring they can stay âcleanâ and free of biofouling even after decades in the ocean.\n\nWe have collected a wide variety of plastic items from the GPGP, with varying levels of marine growth. You can check out some items found in this Facebook album , this YouTube video, and this Tweet from Boyan Slat (CEO and Founder).\n\nRivers\n\nWhat will you do with the extracted waste from rivers?\n\nAs we aim to help tackle the 1000 most polluting rivers, we cannot manage the local waste handling ourselves. There are many challenges to disposing of the waste as facilities and waste diversity vary from country to country; therefore, we implement solutions, in collaboration with partners and governments, according to the current and future waste management capacities of each deployment location. Meanwhile, we continue to investigate solutions to properly treat and dispose of the collected plastic waste in accordance with our internal waste management policy that are affordable, and compliant with local regulations and environmental and social standards. Recycling is preferred, and technical feasibility is being assessed.\n\nInterceptors in operation are helping us to further improve how we approach the treatment and disposal of collected waste while also encouraging local stakeholders to address overall waste management practices and infrastructure.\n\nTo learn more about the waste management approach for Interceptors, check out our dedicated blog post on river waste management and see our Waste Management and Recycling page for a general overview.\n\nAre the Interceptorsâ¢ a replacement for waste management?\n\nNo, this technology is not a replacement for waste management and infrastructure, nor conscious behavior of plastic production, consumption, and disposal. Governments and many organizations are already focused on improving solid waste management systems. Our aim is to provide an alternative solution which is complementary to the broad range of actions.\n\nEssentially, we are a project, and our goal has always been to put ourselves out of business; therefore, all efforts to care for plastic waste are necessary.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup Organization\n\nHow did The Ocean Cleanup come into existence?\n\nIn 2011, then 16-year-old Boyan Slat was diving in Greece and was surprised to see more plastic than fish. Together with a friend he explored oceanic plastic pollution and the difficulties of cleaning it up for a high school science project. Boyan remained fascinated by the problem and continued working on his passive clean-up concept during his freshman year at university. This eventually led him to start The Ocean Cleanup.\n\nIs it possible to do my internship at The Ocean Cleanup?\n\nPlease visit the Careers page to see if we have any outstanding internships available.
