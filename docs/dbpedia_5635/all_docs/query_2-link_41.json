        "text": "“My life is better than your vacation.”\n\nIt’s kind of a snarky line, but many folks who live in resort areas like ours believe it to be true. After all, locals in paradise get to live a life that others only experience on their best days. The days they are on vacation.\n\nBut we all know that life, even in a place like Aspen, has its ups and downs, and just like everywhere else, those of us who live here need to get out every once in a while. Aspenites seem to travel to exotic locales more often than they stay home. If you are one of those folks who frequent Instagram and other social-media sites, you likely see posts, photos, and reels of your friends more when they are on vacation than you do in actual real life. Bump into someone you haven’t seen in a long time, and the first question they ask is, “Have you taken any trips?” Usually, the answer is yes, and generally, there is an ocean involved.\n\nHawaii, specifically Kuai and even more specifically the town of Hanalei, is a favorite destination amongst Aspenites. I’m guessing the locals there think of people from Aspen the way we think of people from Austin: There’s just too damn many of them. Beyond the Hawaiian Islands, folks from Aspen travel to Mexico in droves with San Miguel de Allende being the hot spot for the artistic crowd and Cabo San Lucas or Tulum the choices for those looking for more visceral, though very different experiences. And then there are the Costa Rica aficionados who plan trips based on the tides and surf forecasts.\n\nYes, the travel bug is contagious, and we all need to get away.\n\nStudies show that it is not just the act of travel that gets us goosed. Rather the planning of a trip can have positive effects on our psyche, as well. A study in the Netherlands a few years back found that 97% of people who have travel plans report a greater sense of happiness and well-being. According to The New York Times report on the study, which appeared in a journal titled Applied Research in Quality of Life, the largest boost in happiness comes from the simple act of planning a vacation. In the study, the effect of vacation anticipation boosted happiness for eight weeks. Not bad for just booking a flight and getting a VRBO.\n\nBut it’s fully understandable. The anticipation of a vacation or a trip gives us something to look forward to. In some cases, it can be better than the trip itself. The future is wide open. You don’t know what’s going to happen, but you know it will be great. Perfect even.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I love to travel, and as I write this, I am looking at the Pacific and about to take a swim. But as good as the reality is, there is something about that anticipation of getting in the water that is as good as the actual reality of getting in the water. Both are great. And we need that combination of anticipation and actual vacation if we want to be fully fulfilled. Still as great as a trip to the sea is rewarding, I’m looking forward to getting back to Aspen soon.\n\nBecause my life there is better than your vacation."
