        "text": "‘Basically, Oceans XI is a Dungeons and Dragons campaign but instead of being about orcs and dragons it’s Cool Heist Bros’\n\nThe weird choice to put XI like it’s a football team aside; this was a statement that I put on Twitter on Monday while I was discussing the Ocean’s Eleven movie. I meant it as a throw-away joke but the more I thought about it, I thought there was a case for it.\n\nAnd if Christopher Nolan can convince everyone that Inception, a mind-heist movie that is just a load of great video game levels put into one quite fun narrative that tries to do the Matrix thing where they try and make the audience think ‘whether they are in the dream/simulation or the real world’, is about the movie-making process; I can make a case that Oceans is DnD with ‘Cool Heist Bros’.\n\nSo the first question to ask is, have you seen Oceans Eleven? If you have great that makes it so much easier to do this, if you haven't then have you seen any popcorn heist movie over the past 20 years, because bar the aforementioned Inception they are all in some way just a reskin of Oceans Eleven.\n\nThe film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a remake of a film of the same name that was released in 1960 that starred Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. Like many films of the late 1990s — early 2000s, it brings together an all-star cast of Hollywood’s biggest names alongside a number of character actors to fill in the gaps.\n\nMy second question is do you know what Dungeons and Dragons is? I know that my audience is likely between the ages of 15–40 years old who have seen the likes of Community, Harmon Quest, Futurama, Stranger Things, The IT Crowd, Freak and Geeks etc. which all have episodes or plot threads based around the game.\n\nThere are also some great Youtube channels that are dedicated to the game such as Critical Role.\n\nI have only played it a handful of times myself, with my friends either ‘having lives’ or on the other end of the spectrum ‘too far into a campaign to allow a newcomer’, but in simple terms, you have your quest, you have a dungeon master who has a set way he wants you to do it (which never happens) and you have a group of people that have their own characters with rich backstories that no one really cares about.\n\nThat last point is where I’m going to begin my comparison. When you watch these heist movies, the characters can feel let’s say a little one-note, but to try and give them more ‘development’ the writer offer flashes back to some caper or part of their past which inspired them to do what they do.\n\nNo one really cares that much about it, it’s superfluous to the actual story, but I think in some ways it helps the actors portraying those roles get more into character and that is the same as in DnD.\n\nThis might actually be more common than you’d expect. Quentin Tarantino revealed in the Empire Film Podcast, that ahead of his most recent film ‘Once Upon A Time In Hollywood’, he had written an entire biography for the main character Rick Dalton, just to help Leonardo Di Caprio get into character. He said:\n\n“It gives you a little quickie biography of his life. And then it starts going through the career: ‘…and then there’s this episodic television show, and then this other television show, and then this movie, and that movie’, and starts with the small parts he has in this one, and it builds, with little reviews of each thing, little synopses of each of them. And it goes through the entire career until he retires in 1988.”\n\nBut of course, no one is going to stick to Director/Writers notes exactly and everyone is going to add their own quirks to make the character feel more unique. For example, there is no way on God’s green earth that anyone told Don Cheadle to put on *that* British accent.\n\nBut the people who are in the film also fill in specific roles for what you’d expect makes up a group of people that would play Dungeons and Dragons. There’s the experienced guy who’s done this 100 times before and is taking the lead (George Clooney’s Danny Ocean), there’s a guy there who’s kinda into it but is mainly just there for the snacks and comradery (Brad Pitt’s Rusty Ryan).\n\nThere are the old veterans in Elliot Gould’s Reuben Tishkoff and Carl Reiner’s Saul Bloom and there’s also the greenhorn of Matt Damon’s Linus Caldwell. The cast is colourful and bounces great off each other; they feel like their having fun.\n\nI think this is one of the great things about Ocean’s Eleven which makes it a great movie but it is also a key factor about any DnD campaign, the people that are in it feel like they are enjoying themselves and it keeps the energy high throughout.\n\nThey are never truly phased by the big bad, a corrupt casino owner played by Andy Garcia, who is the stereotype of any shady businessman. He’s one-dimensional, much like most of the characters in this movie, but works because he doesn’t need to be anything more than that.\n\nThe film is about the journey, not the destination. How they set up for the heist is 70% of the movie with the actual execution taking no more than 5 minutes.\n\nOf course with any good DnD campaign, things go off the rails in more ways than one. Firstly, there are the tangents; in Ocean’s Eleven Danny is trying to get his ex-wife back from the aforementioned big, evil, corrupt casino owner (his name escapes me but I think it works better for my point that it doesn’t matter if I don’t look it up).\n\nBut then there is the ‘final battle’ or the heist. Everyone needs to work together to achieve their goal and they all have their part to play.\n\nEach character has their own particular set of skills (no this isn’t Liam Neeson’s Taken). One is an explosive expert, one wears disguises, two are mechanics and inventors, and one is an acrobat.\n\nIf you’ve seen a Soderbergh heist movie before though however, you’ll know that there’s always a twist. The heist that’s been planned for the entire movie, is not how the heist actually happens at the end of the film.\n\nIt’s very ‘look how cool and clever we are to figure this out’ and is for want of a better phrase, controlled chaos. Now think if you’ve ever played DnD, has the endgame ever turned out how you planned or have you ever figured something out in the last few minutes of the climactic battle that completely cracks the whole thing wide open and allows you to grasp victory.\n\nIn the world of the film, this doesn’t quite work because the final plan was Danny Ocean’s plan at all, but in the narrative of the film, it works because they present it as a rug pull.\n\nThey even use a character that hardly gets any screentime as the lynchpin for the whole plan succeeding, Shaobo Quin’s Yen. It’s like when you pick up a random relic or weapon halfway through a campaign, never use it, and then remember it’s in your inventory in the final battle and it again, cracks the whole thing wide open.\n\nOcean’s Eleven is a style over substance movie and I think the biggest parallel you can make with DnD is that it only works if the audience completely buys into it.\n\nI described it at the start as ‘Cool Heist Bros’ but if you instantly think at the start, well these guys are pretty lame and this plan is convoluted, you don’t feel the satisfaction when they pull it off and walk off into the sunset while sticking it into the man.\n\nOther than maybe Danny Ocean, there’s no one really to get invested in, they’re all pretty terrible shallow people and the money is only going to benefit them. It’s like if you fell into the Fast and Furious series at Fast Five and they remove any scene in which Vin Diesel talks about family.\n\nIt’s a really fun movie at the end of the day and if you haven't seen it I recommend it, just don’t watch Twelve. That one has a weird meta bit about celebrities that I don’t really think lands (Julia Roberts plays a character who to trick a mark pretends she is Julia Roberts but an exaggerated version).\n\nBut while you’re watching it just remember that some random guy on the internet once made the ridiculous statement that it was ‘DnD but with Cool Heist Bros’."
