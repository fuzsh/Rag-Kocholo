        "text": "Summer may be winding down, but there’s still time to hit the beach! Just make sure you visit an open one. These 62 beaches across Massachusetts are closed, mostly due to bacteria concerns.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health says bacteria levels tend to rise right after periods of heavy rainfall. Dirty runoff from the streets gathers excrement and other harmful bacteria in the sewers, which in turn can run into nearby bodies of water.\n\nSwimming in unsafe water can potentially lead to a bevy of health problems. The most frequent and notable effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, like nausea and diarrhea. When ingested, bacteria can also cause flu-like symptoms, skin rashes, and eye-nose-throat problems.\n\nIt is unclear when the beaches will reopen. Water testing results take 24 hours, DPH says, so results typically come out the next day. For now, the department warns beachgoers to be vigilant and check their interactive beach water quality dashboard.\n\nBeaches closed as of Thursday, Aug. 8\n\nBeaches with an * indicate beaches that were closed for over a week. Two asterisks (**) indicate the beach has been closed for more than two weeks.\n\nAmherst\n\nPuffers Pond**\n\nStanley St. swimming hole**\n\nAshby\n\nDamon Pond Beach**\n\nAshland\n\nAshland Reservoir\n\nAthol\n\nEllis Beach\n\nBeverly\n\nDane Street\n\nMingo\n\nBoston\n\nConstitution\n\nMalibu**\n\nSavin Hill*\n\nTenean**\n\nChatham\n\nBucks Creek**\n\nConcord\n\nWalden Pond**\n\nDanvers\n\nSandy Beach*\n\nDartmouth\n\nHidden Bay\n\nJones Town Beach North and South\n\nMoses Smith Creek*\n\nFramingham\n\nLearned Pond Beach\n\nFreetown\n\nFreetown Town Beach*\n\nHarwich\n\nSand Pond*\n\nHingham\n\nHingham Town Beach\n\nHolland\n\nCollette Drive Beach**\n\nHubbardston\n\nAsnacomet Pond Beach\n\nLowell\n\nMerrimac River Bath House\n\nLynn\n\nKings**\n\nLynn Shore Beach**\n\nManchester\n\nWhite\n\nMarblehead\n\nGrace Oliver*\n\nNantucket\n\nSesachacha Pond**\n\nNatick\n\nCochituate State Park Beach*\n\nNorth Andover\n\nStevens Pond – Center**\n\nNorthampton\n\nMusante Beach\n\nOxford\n\nCarbuncle Pond**\n\nRutland\n\nWhitehall Pond Beach**\n\nSalem\n\nCamp Naumkeag**\n\nChildren’s Island**\n\nCollins Cove\n\nJuniper Point\n\nOcean Avenue*\n\nOsgood*\n\nWillow Avenue\n\nSaugus\n\nPearce Lake\n\nShutesbury\n\nLake Wyola**\n\nSpringfield\n\nBass Pond\n\nSwampscott\n\nFisherman’s*\n\nKings**\n\nTaunton\n\nWatsons Pond**\n\nTempleton\n\nBeamans Pond**\n\nTownsend\n\nPearl Hill Pond Beach**\n\nTruro\n\nLongnook**\n\nTyngsborough\n\nTyngsborough Town Beach\n\nWest Stockbridge\n\nCard Pond Beach**\n\nWest Tisbury\n\nLong Cove**\n\nSeth’s Pond**\n\nWestborough\n\nLake Chauncy Beach\n\nWilliamstown\n\nMargaret Lindley Park\n\nWinchendon\n\nLake Dennison*\n\nWinchester\n\nShannon Beach\n\nWinthrop\n\nWinthrop Beach\n\nWorcester"
