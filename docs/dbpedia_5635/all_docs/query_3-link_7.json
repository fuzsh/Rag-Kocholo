He starts to think on it. I think the entire rest of the movie does not actually happen but is all part of his thinking about what'd do out of prison.\n\nI think it explains everything in the movie. How cool he is, how specifically uncool some of them are, how stereotypical else everyone is, the moments of luck they have, the coincidences, the cool vibe of the movie in general, the whole fantasy of going against the biggest challenge and succeeding, how it involves his ex wife who left him, all that. It's all fake!!!!\n\nI haven't finished the movie. Since there are other two movies i'm guessing the movie doesn't finish by proving this right. Maybe it does, i don't know. What i know is none of this actually happened in real life. The movie's real life.

Ocean 8...\n\nIt's just a parallel fantasy he had about his sisters, about how things might be after his death 🤔\n\ndodo\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n4,050\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#32\n\nI feel like \"after a certain point X is all a dream\" theories usually just end up fantasizing about making movies less interesting. besides being a twist for the sake of being a twist, what would this reveal bring to ocean's eleven?\n\nMoonlitBow\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,033\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#34\n\nSo in the beginning of the movie there is a scene where Danny is in prison and the lady asks what he'd do if he left the prison. He starts to think on it. I think the entire rest of the movie does not actually happen but is all part of his thinking about what'd do out of prison.\n\nIt had been years since I watched Ocean's 11 but I thought that scene was basically about Danny Ocean getting a 2nd chance and he decides to use it to go back to his old ways. It pretty quickly established what kind of character he was, I recall and that was reflected in his interactions with others.\n\nSalmonax\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,097\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#35\n\nDanny was on the cat's collar, and the cat was dead the whole time.\n\nIDreamOfHime\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n15,202\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#36\n\nBut Oceans 12 has Arsenal in it.

I should watch again in case I was just comparing it to 11 too much.\n\nIt's terrible but I do love the actual performances.\n\nThe ending makes zero sense and is an actual plot hole (a term which is often poorly applied but fits here). It's painstakingly established that Toulour will be watching them all 24/7 from a specific moment in the film on. And yet the trick they use to win is just to have Clooney and Damon rob the fabergé egg courier on a train. How shit exactly is Toulour's surveillance on them if they can do that train fight and switch bags without raising any suspicion from Toulour?\n\nFoltzie\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n6,921\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#39\n\nThat the character Julia Roberts plays is acknowledged to look like the actress Julia Roberts, and they have a scene with her pretending to be \"real-life\" Julia Roberts but she then bumps into real-life Bruce Willis, who thinks she's real-life Julia Roberts.\n\nNot only is it absolutely awful, it also makes zero sense... so the rest of the cast all just look like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, etc? And nobody ever mentions it?\n\nIt's just so lame.\n\nWhat you are describing is the setup, the gag is that everyone tells Bruce Willis that they saw the twist coming in the Sixth Sense only for the ruse to fail and Bruce to declare \"I Knew It!\" which makes that scene worth strained setup.\n\nmaybe. sorta.\n\nI laughed.\n\nThe Llama\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,026\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#40\n\nWhat I can say is that Ocean's Twelve absolutely positively 100% happens... and there's a gag involving one of the central characters, and how they use her in the plan that truly beggars belief when it comes to actual \"reality\".\n\nThat's all I'll say.\n\nOceans 12 is so bad. 11 and 13 are each some of my favorite movies (a few years ago, if anyone asked I would say that Oceans 11 was my favorite movie of all time; not sure if I'd still answer that tbh but I do love it).\n\nYes but have you watched the original Oceans 11 with the Rat Pack?\n\nBleh, I've made the mistake of doing this 2 or 3 times. It's..... not good.\n\nMandos\n\nNov 27, 2017\n\n33,457\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#41\n\nOceans 12 is so bad. 11 and 13 are each some of my favorite movies (a few years ago, if anyone asked I would say that Oceans 11 was my favorite movie of all time; not sure if I'd still answer that tbh but I do love it).\n\nBleh, I've made the mistake of doing this 2 or 3 times. It's..... not good.\n\nI'm being honest here I almost did once but I never got around to it... feel I made the right choice. Original Italian Job was good though!\n\nNow this thread makes me want to rewatch the trilogy\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#42\n\nThe trilogy is awesome and, yes, you can tell everyone loved filming them. The cast chemistry was wonderful.\n\nOceans 12 is so bad. 11 and 13 are each some of my favorite movies (a few years ago, if anyone asked I would say that Oceans 11 was my favorite movie of all time; not sure if I'd still answer that tbh but I do love it).\n\nyeah the movies are just fun to watch, like Mamma Mia or some shit. Dont think too much about the plot or logistics or physics. Also definitely the cast had fun making it, i would love to see the blooper reels.\n\nAnd 11 > 13 >>>>> 12.\n\nFoltzie\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n6,921\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#43\n\nIt's terrible but I do love the actual performances.\n\nThe ending makes zero sense and is an actual plot hole (a term which is often poorly applied but fits here). It's painstakingly established that Toulour will be watching them all 24/7 from a specific moment in the film on. And yet the trick they use to win is just to have Clooney and Damon rob the fabergé egg courier on a train. How shit exactly is Toulour's surveillance on them if they can do that train fight and switch bags without raising any suspicion from Toulour?\n\nThe scene(s) you reference occurs prior to that specific moment. As a result they undo the prior two acts as a 'show'. I dont know if that is better than a plot hole.\n\nLeMarc tells them what's up w/ 6 days left, the initial meeting with Toulour is w/ 5 days left. The egg was lifted before the game started.\n\nMusubi\n\nUnshakable Resolve - Prophet of Truth\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n24,768\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#44\n\nThis thread made me realize I haven't seen this movie in years and I went on Netflix and watched it. lol\n\nboxter432\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n9,695\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#45\n\n11 is awesome. 12 is terrible. 13 is definitely worse than 11 but wayyyy better than 12.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\njulia crawford\n\nTook the red AND the blue pills\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n37,234\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#46\n\nOh man these movies are so good\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\njulia crawford\n\nTook the red AND the blue pills\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n37,234\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#47\n\nWell i liked 12.
