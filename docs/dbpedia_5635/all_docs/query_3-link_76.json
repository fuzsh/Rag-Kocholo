        "text": "After fighting in the First World War, Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender) goes looking for the quiet life and finds it at the ends of the earth. As “The Light Between Oceans” begins, he is interviewed for—and accepts—a job as a lighthouse keeper. Warned that it may prove tough, he replies, “It’s not likely to be tougher than the Western Front.” Solitary and bereft of kin, he should be a blank slate, but we sense that the slate has been scrawled upon, in the hell of the past few years. There are no flashbacks to the war, and we don’t need them; so fierce is Fassbender, and such is the glare of his gaze above the bristling military mustache, that we instantly believe in Tom as a veteran—a disciplined soul determined not to crack. Hence his unnerving stillness, in this opening scene. For a moment, I thought the projector had stuck.\n\nDerek Cianfrance’s film, based on the novel of the same name by M. L. Stedman, was shot in Australia and New Zealand. But where, exactly, is it set? The lighthouse lies on a fictional island, Janus, which turns its face to two seas; but which seas? Apart from a glimpse of a nautical chart, the movie is mapless—a minor but exasperating flaw, because the story depends on the depth of Tom’s isolation. “You’ll be the only living man for a hundred miles in every direction,” he is told, but the boat that takes him there seems to ply back and forth with cheerful frequency, and we see Tom tapping out messages in Morse. We also learn that his predecessor was widowed on Janus, his wife having thrown herself from a cliff, and lost his reason; yet that hint of a haunted spot—or of a curse—is unfulfilled. Tom is not marooned in madness.\n\nBefore setting out from the mainland, he is invited into polite society. A couple called the Graysmarks (finely played by Garry Macdonald and Jane Menelaus) present him to their daughter Isabel (Alicia Vikander), who claims him with a look. Once he leaves for Janus, they correspond, and, on his return, she more or less proposes to him; after some delay, arising from Tom’s idea that he is neither worthy nor wantable, they embark for Janus as newlyweds, with every intention of starting a family. They are the only inhabitants of the island, unless you count the chickens.\n\nAll this occurs at disconcerting speed, which many will take as proof of the film’s romantic impetus—of Cianfrance’s faith in the headlong lunge of love. After all, he is the man who made “Blue Valentine” (2010). On the other hand, something about the latest film feels rushed and crammed; apparently, more than two hundred hours of digital footage were shot, which sounds impressive, though you want to ask how any semblance of dramatic shape can emerge from that welter of material, and what gets elided in the process. Thus, we skip over Tom’s first step upon the fateful isle, and, as for the seascapes, the camera glances at the graceful wash of the waves and moves on, not daring to linger. Then, there is the lighthouse itself; the framing of it recalls the lighthouse at Two Lights, in Maine, that impelled Edward Hopper to create paintings of an ominous serenity, but, again, Cianfrance seems too impatient to let the tower loom large.\n\nTo be fair, he does find room for a tempest. Also, he has a mystery to cope with. One day, a mournful Isabel—recovering from a second miscarriage—spies a boat offshore. In it are a dead man and a living baby girl. Tom is about to report the discovery, but Isabel stays his hand. “No one will know she’s not ours,” she says. From that hesitation flows the rest of the plot. The girl, whom they name Lucy, is raised devotedly as their own, unquestioned by their relatives, until, on a trip to shore, Tom becomes aware of her true mother, Hannah (Rachel Weisz), who believes that her husband and child drowned. To whom does Lucy belong, or wish to belong? Can Isabel be persuaded to give her up? And will Tom, advised by his inner Jiminy Cricket, let his conscience be his guide?\n\nStand back from this fable and examine it for logic, and you see how nonsensical it is. By what miracle an infant could survive and an adult perish, on the open sea, is unexplained. Only in the late romances of Shakespeare do such curious details—children lost and found, an island refuge, a savage storm—hang together, and there the characters breathe an air that is dense with magic. Those who attend the climax of “Pericles,” where a daughter is reunited with her parent, were described by T. S. Eliot as “creatures who are more than human, or rather, seen in a light more than that of day.” But Cianfrance does not summon such a light, and folks like Tom and Isabel, though crazed by destiny, are stubbornly grounded. How their story might have flourished under Michael Powell, say, or Albert Lewin, the director of “Pandora and the Flying Dutchman” (1951), both of them unabashed in their lyrical exploits, we can but guess.\n\n“The Light Between Oceans” is an oddly old-fashioned enterprise, wedded to the principle that love conquers all. However hasty, the tale is straightforwardly told. Not for Cianfrance, this time, the chronological leaps and loops that made “Blue Valentine” so painfully tense, or the generational span of “The Place Beyond the Pines” (2012), which could barely contain itself under the pressure of narrative ambition. The effect of this plainness is to throw an extra burden on the actors, who, once introduced, are seldom left alone for long, and who must submit to concentrated closeups. Weisz deals wonderfully with the scene in which Hannah encounters her child, now age four, in Isabel’s arms—not yet knowing that Lucy is hers but sensing a strange tug of fellow-feeling. As for Vikander, she is one of those performers who, for all their beauty, remain uncomfortable to watch, such is their lack of a protective layer; emotions rise up in her, unhindered, and declare themselves, down to the last tremor, on her face. It’s an extraordinary sight, and the wellspring of her stardom, though you do keep wanting to reach out and offer her a tissue. And that’s before the sad bits even start.\n\nWhether the film cuts it as a fully functioning weepie is another matter. I was in pieces after “Blue Valentine,” and had to be swept up from the floor of the cinema by the guy who retrieves the spilled popcorn, but the “The Light Between Oceans” left me disappointingly intact. Partly, this has to do with Fassbender, who is never at ease with the depiction of happiness, and is therefore less than persuasive, as a griever, when it is snatched away. The movie is rather prim, too, shying from sexual heat, and its devotion to correct attire is both touching and telling; with Isabel swathed in beach-friendly knitwear and hats, and Tom rarely devoid of a collar and tie, they must be the first lovers on record to greet their blessed seclusion by adding more clothes rather than ripping them off. Perhaps such formality was to be expected, given that both players have done their finest work as robots—Fassbender in “Prometheus” (2012) and Vikander in “Ex Machina” (2015). Still, the joyous and red-blooded fact is that, in real life, they emerged from the filming as a couple, much as Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes did from “The Place Beyond the Pines.” If the directing ever dries up, Cianfrance could run a dating agency. He’s got the knack.\n\nAnybody who goes to “Max Rose” hoping for gags and goofery will walk out frustrated at the end. Although Daniel Noah’s film stars Jerry Lewis in the title role, mayhem is off the menu. People tell jokes to one another, but very slowly and often more loudly than is required. I know that most of the movie is about elderly people, but does it follow that the lines should be enunciated as if the cinema, likewise, were populated solely by the deaf?\n\nMax, a retired jazz pianist, begins in mourning, and stays there. His wife of sixty-five years, Eva (Claire Bloom), has just passed away, and he looks hollowed out—sitting glumly in his red sweater and white socks, and batting aside the gentle entreaties of his granddaughter Annie (Kerry Bishé). He also has a son, Chris (Kevin Pollak), whom he openly scorns. All in all, it’s no surprise when Max is shifted to a retirement home, where he can knit pot holders and practice his disgruntlement round the clock. Revisit Lewis in his pomp, and you’ll notice how much activity went on in the southern regions of his face; he still has a resentful grind to his lower jaw, and that monkeyish mouth is as busy, in “Max Rose,” as it was in “The Nutty Professor” (1963), when, in the guise of Buddy Love, the slick-haired Lothario, he brought a whole night club to a halt. But Noah takes a fatal decision to trade snap for mush, and the movie only stirs in the final twenty minutes, when Max pays a nocturnal call on Ben Tracey (Dean Stockwell), who cuckolded him long ago. Regrettably, they make their peace, but, for a moment, the sequence smacks of something threatening and fresh: oldster noir. ♦"
