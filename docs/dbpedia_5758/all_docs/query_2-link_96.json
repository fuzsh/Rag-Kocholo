According to curator Elsy Lahner, the exhibition ‘shows works in which artists - from different countries with a different cultural background – deal with their stay in Paris, responding to the city, its everyday life, referring to current happenings and events of the day, and to their own experiences’. Bøthun plans to produce three-dimensional objects that reference the ‘ready-made’ through what she describes as a re-invention of ‘the so-called ordinary object through a series of interventions and subversions’. Other participating artists include Ovidiu Anton, Guillaume Aubry, Alexandra Baumgartner, Catrin Bolt, Åsil Bøthun, Eva Chytilek, Audrey Cottin, Jakob Emdal, Eva Engelbert, Ann Guillaume and Akiko Hoshina. Curator: Elsy Lahner, curator at the Albertina Museum in Vienna, Austria\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Agnes Nedregård (b.1975 in Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) in the International Performance Art Festival Accion! MAD 2011 in Madrid, Spain. In her performance titled You, me and the other – YOU, Nedregård explores her interest in ‘how we perceive each other–who we define as us, and who are the others’. Taking place at venues throughout the city, including the Museo National Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, the festival use the new economic and political realities in Europe as a backdrop for a diverse programme, which, according to curator Nieves Correa, focuses on ‘absolute independence’ as an urgent ‘national and international reference’.

Curator Andreas Brøgger indicates that the exhibition brings together artists who ‘explore the relationship between the real and the virtual, highlighting the effects of blurred boundaries between gaming environments and physical environments’. Verbiesen plans to present her installation Pole Position, which, according to the artist, allows ‘viewers to interactively inhabit the space as a dimension that they control themselves’. Other participating artists include Jeremy Bailey, Aram Bartholl, Katsumoto Yuichiro, Cao Fei and Bill Viola.

The project is part of the series of One Night Stands that has been running for a year at WIP:STLHM, where the board invites different artists and curators to do exhibitions for a day. According to curator Line Halvorsen (b.1976 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), the exhibition investigates ‘the party and art culture’ that surrounds the proliferation of one-night exhibitions by using the metaphor of the ‘walk of shame’, which she describes as ‘leaving someone’s house with the same clothes you had the night before, full of affect on carelessness, fear of STD’s and pregnancy’. Other participating artists include Anastatisa Ax, Tova Mozard and Kristoffer Svenberg. Curator: Line Halvorsen, independent artist and curator based in Oslo, Norway.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Kurt Johannessen (b.1960 in Bergen, Norway, lives in Oslo, Norway) in Co-Lab Editions 6: Nazaket Ekici—Kurt Johannessen at SAVVY Contemporary in Berlin, Germany. According to curator Márcio Carvalho, Co-Lab Editions ‘is dedicated to exchange between artists that use performance art as one of their primary working media’ by using the blog as a point of departure through which ‘artists can start working together from their home countries by posting visual material that can be important for the development of the work’. After collaborating remotely via the blog, the artists will then come together in Berlin for one week to produce a performance.

According to curator Eileen Legaspi Ramirez, the overall theme of the biennale, ‘Maximum City’, ‘logically creates a picture of a city bursting at its seams, this trope of development also suggests an implied need—for new people, new expertise that may not have initially been present amidst an initially homogenous population’. Pascua will contribute works that reference the complex issues related to migration and assimilation. Other participating artists include Ai Weiwei, Cai Zhisong, Dylan Martorell, Felix Bacolor, Julie Rrap and Sandra Nyberg. Curator: Eileen Legaspi Ramirez, Guest curator, Jakarta Biennial 2011, Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Morten Andersen (b.1965 in Lørenskog, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), photojournalist Jonas Bendiksen (b.1977 in Tønsberg, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and curators Ingrid Nilsson, Director, Preus Fotomuseum, and Jan Erik Lundstrom, Director, Samisk Kunstsenter, in the Nordic Photography Experience, a cultural collaboration and educational programme at the FotoDepartament Gallery in Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

According to curator Maria Lind, ‘Abstract Possible’ is a ‘research project in the sense that it evolves over a longer period of time, exploring a set of questions in relation to physical and spatial articulations which then in turn lead to further iterations of the project’. Beginning at Malmö Konsthall, the project continued on to the Museo Tamayo in Mexico City and the Zurich University of the Arts before arriving in its new iteration in Stockholm. Faldbakken has produced a new series of Triple Screenprints specifically for the exhibition. Other participating artists include Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Yto Barrada, Pia Camil, Jose Leon Cerillo and Zachary Formwalt. Curator: Maria Lind, Director, Tensta Kunsthall, Spånga, Sweden\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artists Randi Nygård (b.1977 in Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Munan Øvrelid (b.1978 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition ‘New Horizons, Landscape and the Contemporary Romantic’ at Kunstraum T27 in Berlin, Germany. According to the curator Rebecca Partridge, the exhibition brings together artists who ‘look to the natural sciences, literature and art history to underline and explore the impact ideas about nature on contemporary life’. Nygård plans to develop ‘an installation where still images from films about biology and scenes from fiction films are mixed’. Øvrelid plans to develop a video project using ‘monuments/statues representing figures from Romanticism,’ which will ‘break down and open the static image they represent’. Other participating artists include Jane Hughes, Bjarte Alvestad, Sarah Jane Gorlitz, Wojciech Olejnik and Katie Paterson. Curator: Rebecca Partridge, independent artist and curator, based in Berlin, Germany and London, UK.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Tommy Høvik (b.1979 in Trondheim, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Javier Barrios (b.1979 in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Zac Tomaszewski (b.1987 in Los Angeles, USA, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Thomas Falstad (b.1977 in Trondheim, Norway, lies and works in Oslo, Norway), Christer Glein (b.1984 in Trondheim, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Oda Broch (b.1982 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works Oslo, Norway), Tara Rolfsen (b.1982 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Hans Christian Skovholt (b.1982 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition ‘Crystallomancy’ at Control-Room in Los Angeles, CA, USA. According to curator Zac Tomaszewski, the artists in the exhibition are ‘all working around the ideas of perception and expanded reality, whether by referencing sci-fi tropes or the paranormal, or by trying to craft perceptual experiences that are surprising to apprehend, whether for their novelty, confounding nature, or overwhelming aspect’. Curators: Zachary Tomaszewski and Tommy Høvik, both independent artists and curators, based in Oslo, Norway.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Rachel Dagnall (b.1972 in Liverpool, UK, lives and works in Nesodden, Norway) in a lecture seminar titled ‘(in)flexible cities: The City Seminar’ at the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH) at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. According to the organisers, the discussion will centre on artist Anish Kapoor’s proposed ArcelorMittal Orbit project in London’s Olympic Park ‘as a symbol of urban change and as a partial realisation of Tatlin’s unbuilt Monument to the Third International’.

According to curator Eneas Bernal, the purpose of the project 'is to convey, show, transmit, objectify, set in motion, through art, the explosions of sensitivity that have taken place and continue to do so today from the North Pole to Greece, from the unprecedented forces of beauty of Charles Fourier’s clairvoyance'. Tor Navjord will collaborate with artists Miriam Martín and Rafael Sánchez-Mateos Paniagua to produce the exhibition and accompanying catalogue.\n\nCurator: Eneas Bernal, cultural manager and curator, MUSAC\n\nSupport provided for the development of artist Jorunn Hancke Øgstad’s (b.1979 in Bærum, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) performance project and exhibition at the El Parche Artist Residency programme in Bogotá, Colombia. According to the artist, her work ‘cites the formal language of abstraction and minimalism, but the focus is not on the analysis of form and content, but rather on playing through these elements of style in order to go beyond their logic’. At El Parche, she will use Samuel Beckett’s play Quad (1981) as a point of departure to engage local performers in the development of a collaboration the manifests itself in a performance and exhibition. Curator: Olga Robayo and Marius Wang, funders and curators, El Parche, Bogota, Colombia\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Fine Art Union, consisting of Synnøve G. Wetten (b.1978 in Akershus, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Annette Stav Johanssen (b.1979 in Kristiansand, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), in ‘Axis, Allies and Neutrals’, a screening and performance event at the Overgaden Institute for Contemporary Art in Copenhagen, Denmark. According to curator Anna Holm, the event ‘presents hybrid projects that utilise storytelling as a way of introducing alternative accounts of past, present and future’. Fine Art Union plans to present two performances that deal with identity, gender and borders through the use of a handcrafted flag. Other participating artists include Maria Lusitano, Shirin Sabahi and Jeuno Je Kim. Curator: Anna Holm, curator, Overgaden, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nSupport provided for the participation of the artist-run space KNIPSU, consisting of Hilde Jørgensen (b.1973 in Mosjøen, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway), Kristin Tårnesvik (b.1964 in Birtavarre, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) and Maya Økland (b.1980 in Bergen, Norway, lives in Bergen, Norway), in Supermarket, an international artist-run art fair in Stockholm, Sweden.

KNIPSU has invited the artist group Ytter (consisting of Julie Lillelien Porter (b.1975 in Plymouth, UK, lives and works in Bergen, Norway), Anne Marthe Dyvi (b.1979 in Bærum, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) and Anngjerd Rustand (b.1982 in Bergen, lives and works in Bergen, Norway and Berlin, Germany) to participate in an ongoing collaborative project, which they describe as ‘thematically linked by keywords such as positions, economy and authority in both art life and society in general’. Other participants in the Supermarket fair include Candyland, Ed Video Media Arts Centre, Fotogalerie Wien, MUU galleria and Zolder Museum. Curator: Pontus Raud, project manager, Supermarket 2012, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of the artist-run space Volt founded by Marie Nerland (b.1972 in Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) in Supermarket, an international artist-run art fair in Stockholm, Sweden.

The result of her nine-month residency at WIELS, the project will consist of a 16mm film. According to the artist, the film will feature ‘five women operating professional Bolex 16mm film cameras while bicycling in a park—an action which seems almost impossible’. The project echoes Gunnes’ ongoing reflection on the construction of identity. A group of five women bicycle in circular paths while filming each other with Bolex cameras. The revolving movements captured by the five subjective cameras draw a molecular structure without a fixed center and convey an idea of a non-hierarchical multiple subjectivity. An artist-book will be launched and French art historian Benoît Lamy de La Chapelle will write an essay to accompany the exhibition. Curator: Devrim Bayar, Residency Curator, WIELS Contemporary Art Centre in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Stine Gonsholt (b.1973 in Skien, Norway, lives in works in Oslo, Norway) in the exhibition ‘Atlas—Measures of Dreams’ at the Kunstraum Kuhturm in Leipzig, Germany. According to curator Nina Lundstrom, the exhibition uses the atlas as a point of departure to for assembling artists whose work asks questions such as ‘How does one orientate as a nomadic, contemporary human being in a global world?’ and ‘What processes take place when one takes root somewhere new, find a new home and try to integrate into already existing social systems?’ The artist describes her practice as an ‘animation of documentary material’ through drawing and video. Other participating artists include Nicole Degenhardt and Nina Lundström. Curator: Nina Lundström, independent artist and curator, based in Weimar, Germany.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artists Margrethe Aanestad (b.1974 in Stavanger, Norway, lives and works in Stavanger, Norway), Else Leirvik (b.1972 in Stavanger, Norway, lives and works in Stavanger, Norway) and Ole Martin Lund Bø (b.1973 in Stavanger, Norway, lives and works in Stavanger, Norway) in the exhibition 'The Meeting' at Open Source Gallery in Brooklyn, NY, USA. Acording to curator Marte Danielsen Jølbo, the exhibition ‘is a project about giving and taking space, starting with how personal space is affected by the nature and culture one is coming from’. The artists plan to stay in New York for one month to produce site-specific projects for the exhibition, which will occur at Open Source Gallery as well as a few private apartments in close proximity to the gallery. Curators: Marte Danielsen Jølbo, independent curator based in Stavanger, Norway. Margrethe Aanestad and Else Leirvik, co-curators, independent artists based in Stavanger, Norway.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Aurora Passero (b.1984 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the Glasgow International Festival for Visual Arts in Glasgow, Scotland. Titled ‘Manifesto Without A Title’, the exhibition will be organised by The Mutual, an artists’ co-operative in Glasgow. Nine artists were invited to create a rule for a manifesto, which will be collected and sent out to each artist so that they can develop a project as a response to the overall manifesto. According to the artist, she will develop a site-specific installation in response to the manifesto, which will incorporate her ‘tradition-oriented textile techniques like weaving, braiding and dying’ in order to develop ‘an experimental form using non-traditional materials such as nylon, rubber and acrylics’. Other participating artists include Iben Elstroem, David Shushan, Tisa Pickering, Fabien mar Ques and Katrine Holmgren. Curator: Katrine Holmgren, freelance artist and curator, based in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nSupport provided to the Art Video Exchange (AVE), a two-day international exchange programme in collaboration with Small Projects in Tromsø, for the participation of Igor Bošnjak (b. 1981 in Sarajevo, Bosnia, lives and works in Trebinje, Bosnia) and Elie Souaiby (b. 1983 in Beirut, Lebanon, lives and works in Beirut, Lebanon). According to AVE, their goal is to ‘foster a greater appreciation of video art and an exchange of ideas between artists, curators and audiences worldwide’. As a nomadic programme, AVE does not have a dedicated space so they rely instead on collaborations with different organisations and spaces. For the AVE programme at Small Projects, eleven artists/curators have been invited from nine countries. Curator: Mona Bentzen, artist and organizer, Art Video Exchange, Oslo.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of curator and publisher Arne Skaug Olsen (b.1974 in Gjøvik, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) in the book launch of We Who Feel Differently by artist Carlos Motta at the New Museum in New York, NY, USA. Olsen is a co-founder of the Bergen-based publishing house Ctrl+Z, which produced the book for Carlos Motta. He states that the ‘main concern’ of Ctrl+Z ‘is to independently investigate structural conditions for art production, art mediation and art discourse in the form of printed matter’. A collection of 300 of the books will also be shown as an installation within Carlos Motta’s exhibition at the New Museum. Curator: Eungie Joo, Keith Haring Director and Curator, New Museum, New York, USA\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Bjørn-Kowalski Hansen (b.1979 in Nesttun, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) within the Nordic Pavilion at the Dak’Art Biennial in Dakar, Senegal. According to curators Power Ekroth and Marita Muukonen, the exhibition, titled META-REALITIES, ‘poses in a playful way the question of whether or not can art function as a meta-structure of the realities we live in, and is that the only meta-structure we have despite of geo-cultural etc. differences?’ Hansen, the curators write, is a part of a group of artists who are ‘shaking realities more directly by creating alternative cultures driven by dreams, by expanding, questioning and re-creating boundaries between economy, corporate ideas, utopia, society and art’. Other participating artists include Nathalie Djurberg, Matti Kallioinen, Parfyme, Jesper Just, Teemu Mäki and Egill Säbjörnsson. Curators: Power Ekroth and Marita Muukkonen, curators, Dak'Art Biennial 2012, Dakar, Senegal.\n\nSupport provided for the first international institutional solo exhibition of Hariton Pushwagner (b.1940 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) at the Milton Keynes Gallery in Milton Keynes, UK. According to curator Natalie T. Hope O’Donnell (b.1979 in Lørenskog, Norway, lives in works in London, UK), the exhibition ‘will be a focused presentation of early work, arranged in three groupings: “Soft City” provides the narrative content of much of the artist's work; the “Family of Man” section focuses on his prints, sketches and process; and the “Apokalypse Frieze” demonstrates the zenith of his technical and imaginative accomplishments’. The exhibition will travel to the Boijmans Museum in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and the Vestfold Haugar Kunstmuseum in Tønsberg, Norway. Curator: Natalie Hope O'Donnell, independent curator, writer and translator, based in London, UK\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artists Heidi Kårtveit (b.1983 in Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Magnhild Øen Nordahl (b.1985 in Ulstein, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) in the exhibition ‘Spatial Displacements: The Space In Between’ at Tin Sheds Gallery within the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. According to the curator Dr. William Seeto, the ‘exhibition examines spatiality in built environments with artworks possessing elements of both architecture and sculpture’. Seeto describes Kårtveit’s practice as an examination of ‘human relationships and social interaction in built environments that hints at proxemics, and incorporates kinaesthetics and sound to enable a shift in experience’. Nordahl’s is described as ‘analogous to space as metaphor, with a spatiality requiring movement and duration’. Other participating artist include Sibylle Hofter. Curator: Dr William Seeto, independent curator and artist based in Sydney, Australia\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Marius Engh (b.1974 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Berlin, Germany) in the exhibition 'Fantasie fluttuanti' at the Torrione Passari Center for Contemporary Art in Molfetta Bari, Italy. According to curator Giacomo Zaza, the exhibition ‘is focused on a kind of practice which is developing toward elaboration of forms, contents and contexts that are “in the middle” of present cultural and ontological arguments’. Engh will contribute three installation works to the exhibition, including No Surrender (2002), Utah Drain (2011) and Moon (2011), which, according to the artist, ‘share the qualities of the use of simple forms with a reflective surface that makes the work’s content shift between visible and invisible’. Other participating artists include Franz Ackermann, Via Lewandowsky, Olaf Metzel, François Morellet, Cesare Pietroiusti and Thomas Zipp. Curator: Giacomo Zaza, Artistic Director, Torrione Passari Center for Contemporary Art, Molfetta Bari, Italia\n\nSupport provided for the participation of artist Lars Cuzner (b.1974 in Södertälje, Sweden, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in a series of seminars and workshops at Kim? Contemporary Art Centre in Riga, Latvia as part of the Baltic Cute Curators network. One of the founders of the network, Maija Rudovska, describes it as a platform for curators from the ‘Nordic and Baltic countries whose ‘working field is broad, encompassing both local and international relevance’ with the aim of ‘gaining recognition and acceptance as well as learning from already existing practices and institutional structures’. Other participants in the project include John W Fail and Joachim Hamou. Curators: Maija Rudovska and Juste Kostikovaite, both independent Baltic curators based in Riga, Latvia and London, UK.\n\nSupport provided for a solo exhibition by artist Marianne Hurum (b.1978, Oslo, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) titled ‘Ancient Trail: The Steinstraße Series’ at Lothringer13 in Munich, Germany. The artist plans to make a series of sculptures, watercolour paintings and prints during a six-week residency in Munich prior to the opening of the exhibition. The works will represent a further development of Hurum’s investigation of site-specific painting practices in which she uses items from her immediate environment and transforms ‘such objects to pure shapes in a low brow every-day modernist manner’ by painting them in a palette derived from ‘surrounding colour combinations found in the design of local transport and newspapers, shop signs and houses’. Curator: Sebastian Stein, Shirin Botas, Mitra Wakil, Adrian Djukic and Stephan Janitzky, curator team, Lothringer13\n\nSupport provided to the curator Marianne Zamecznik (b.1972 in Trondheim, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) for the inclusion of artist Josefine Lyche (b.1973, Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in ‘The Feast’, a group exhibition at the European Culture Congress in Wroclaw, Poland. The exhibition presents the work of Pawel Jarodzki, Oliver Laric and Josefine Lyche, who, according to Zamecznik, ‘all contribute to create a peaceful atmosphere for relaxation and reflection’. Lyche presents an installation in which ‘emitted coloured light acquires a new form, but is not negating its origin (the physical colour filter and daylight) through the creation of something new’. Curator: Marianne Zamecznik, independent curator and art critic based in Oslo and Berlin\n\nSupport provided to Kunsthall Oslo, Oslo, Norway for the participation of artists Hassan Khan (b.1975, Cairo, Egypt, lives and works in Cairo, Egypt) and Dina Danish (b.1981, Paris, France, lives and works in Cairo, Egypt) in ‘Run, comrade, run, the old world is behind you’, a series of 23 presentations of artists’ work, screenings, readings and performances during a month period. According to curators Per Gunnar Eeg-Tverbakk, Elisabeth Byre and Will Bradley, part of the inspiration for the project ‘comes from the events of the so-called “Arab Spring”, in particular the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, and the proposition made by theorists that the world is entering a potentially transformatory crisis more profound than that of the late 1960s and early 1970s’. A key part of the project is the involvement of artists from Egypt such a Hassan Khan and Dina Danish. Other participating artists include The Art Militia, Øyvind Berg, Marius Engh, Laura Oldfield Ford, Søren Thilo Funder, Ahmad Ghossein, Jean-Luc Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville, Marianne Heier, Runhild Hundeide.

In this thematic context, Haloba will present her work The Greater G8 Advertising Market Stand (2009), which was first exhibited in the 2009 Venice Biennale. Other participating artists include amongst others Bani Abidi, AES Group, Halim Al-Karim, Halil Altindere, Francis Alÿs, Rasheed Araeen, Kader Attia, Yto Barrada, Richard Bell, Guy Ben-Ner, Tamy Ben-Tor.

Tandberg presents a number of photographs from her series Old Man Going Up and Down a Staircase (2003). Other participating artists include Ray Johnson, Alastair MacKinven, Thomas Raat and The Bruce High Quality Foundation.

According to the artist, the project ‘revolves around the common fears we have for the extermination of mankind…an anxiety that can often give us the inability to act, but can also give us the catalyst to overcome problems’. The ‘Phase’ series at Beaconsfield commissions site-specific projects by mid-career artists in tandem with a retrospective view of earlier works. Curator: Naomi Siderfin, Director, Beaconsfield\n\nSupport provided for the ‘The Darkest Hour Seeks Forgiveness’, a project by artists Jorid Lekve Eide (b.1982, Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Frode Halvorsen (b.1980, Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) at Beaconsfield in London, UK. The artists use the novel Gulliver’s Travels (1726) by Jonathan Swift as a point of departure. Swift’s satirisation of the values and political events of England and Ireland at the time is used, according to the artists, ‘to draw parallels to Norwegian society today’. The artists plan to produce three distinct installations inspired by the stories and characters depicted within Swift’s novel. Curator: Curator: Naomi Siderfin, Director, Beaconsfield\n\nSupport provided for a solo exhibition by artist Kaia Hugin (b.1975, Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Kolbotn, Norway) at Muratcentoventidue Artecontemporanea in Bari, Italy.

Curator: Dr. Angela Gonnella, Founder, Gallery Muracentoventidue\n\nSupport provided to MIT’s ACT program for the participation of artist Jana Winderen (b.1965, Bodø, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the Maryanne Amacher Tribute.

According to curator Åsa Grönlund, the exhibition ‘will focus especially on the large-scale, closely cropped images of faces taken from archival photographs’. Furunes also plans to produce a new work specifically for the exhibition. Curator: Åsa Grönlund, curator, Västerås Konstmuseum\n\nSupport provided for the artists artists Jumana Manna (b.1987, New Jersey, USA, lives and works in Los Angeles, USA) and Sille Storihle (b.1985, Tromsø, Norway, lives and works in Los Angeles, USA) to conduct a lecture at the International Academy of Art Palestine in Ramallah, Palestine in relation to their research and preliminary shooting for the production of their film Osloånden: The Oslo Peace Accords.

Teljer’s contribution to the seminar and exhibition will focus on ‘male problems in a wealthy, spoiled society where the concept of solidarity has died away’.

According to curator Jonathan Watkins, the work ‘essentially is a machine that runs for no reason except that, after one thousand years, it will turn itself off. Powered by light, a sequence of geared wheels rotate increasingly – exponentially – slowly, so that the movement of the last one is imperceptible’. The presentation of Kristoffer Myskja´s work coincides with the presentation of two other artists’ work, namely Tadasu Takamine and John Salt. Kristoffer Myskja’s work will be shown by itself in the small tower room gallery of the Ikon Gallery.\n\nCurator: Jonathan Watkins, curator and director of the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, UK.\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Anna Martine Nilsen (b. 1974 Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the event ‘Fase- Zona de prueba’, which will take place at the Centro Cultural Recoleta in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 5–8 May.

The artist allows the audience to ‘dismantle the pile by borrowing a box in order to perform their own Speakers Corner somewhere in the park’. Ramberg refers to the fact that ‘President Medvedev has called for a Speakers Corner in Moscow after visiting Hyde Park in 2009. So far it has not been realised, because of political resistance from the Duma’. Other participating artists include Kalle Purhonen, Kaarina Kaikkonen, Laura Feldberga, Lars Ramberg and Hrafnkell Sigurgsson.

According to AVE, their goal is to ‘foster a greater appreciation of video art and an exchange of ideas between artists, curators and audiences worldwide’. As a nomadic programme, AVE does not have a dedicated space so they rely instead on collaborations with different organisations and spaces.

According to the curators, ‘Mohaiemen uses text, photo, video and archives to explore histories of the international left, utopia/dystopia slippage, post-partition South Asia, and globally interlinked security panic. Working between two countries, Mohaiemen sometimes explores the contradictions between Bengalis in marginal migrant status, and majoritarian (and authoritarian) roles in their own country’.\n\nCurators: Markús Þór Andrésson, independent curator, writer and documentary filmmaker, based in Reykjavik, Iceland; Theodor Ringborg, artistic director of Milliken Gallery, Stockholm, Sweden; Aura Seikkula, currently a PhD student fellow at the Finnish Doctoral Programme in Social Sciences, Helsinki, Finland; Christian Skovbjerg Jensen, freelance curator and writer based in Copenhagen, Denmark; and Marianne Zamecznik, independent curator, exhibition designer and writer, based in Berlin, Germany.\n\nSupport provided to the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), London, UK for the presentation of a performance by Nils Bech, (b.1981 Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway).

Jan Freuchen will present his project (Works from) the Capgras Collection. The artist states that ‘work consists of recognizable fragments from recent art history, mashed up into new hybrids’. The project was initiated in 2007 for the exhibition ‘Come Into the Open’ at 0047, Oslo. For the exhibition at Gallery NON, Freuchen will develop several new works under the same title and concept. Curator: Nazli Gurlek, independent curator and critic based in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nSupport provided to Human Resources, Los Angeles, CA, USA for the participation of Fine Art Union, a performance duo consisting of Synnøve G. Wetten (b. 1978 Akershus, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Annette Stav Johannesen (b. 1979, Kristiansand, Norway lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition ‘Queering Sex’ at Human Resources. Fine Art Union will present their project Demo Demonstration. ‘Queering Sex’ will present performances and videos by artists who deal with issues of gender and sexuality, thus considering how artists across generations use sex as a way to understand and explore what lies at the core of one’s identity. According to curator Sarvia Jasso ‘Fine Art Union’s progressive stance on feminism, gender and queer politics not only aligns them with the other artists, but their unique voice will undoubtedly have a profound impact in “Queering Sex” because Demo Demonstration is the kind of project that is both engaging and critical’. Other participating artists include Theo Adams, Skip Arnold, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Kathryn Garcia, Kalup Linzy, and Lovett/Codagnone, among others.\n\nCurator: Sarvia Jasso, independent curator, lives and works in New York, USA and Kathryn Garcia, artist and co-organizer, lives and works in New York, USA\n\nSupport provided for Milena Bonilla's (b. 1975 in Bogotá, Colombia, lives and works in Amsterdam, the Netherlands) participation in the ongoing series ‘Opus Incertum' in the group exhibition titled ‘Screaming From The Mountain’ at Sørlandets Kunstmuseum. According to the museum, ’”Opus Incertum” is a series of installations where works by artists from near and far are set into a dialogue with our own collection’. Previously invited artists include Cho Duck Hyun and Rhee Ki Bong (South Korea) and the Danish collective A Kassen. The curator Pontus Kyander states that Bonilla will ‘contribute several series from her previous collection and produce a new work for the third installment of “Opus Incertum”’.\n\nCurator: Pontus Kyander, director, SKMU Sørlandets Kunstmuseum\n\nSupport provided to Mette Tronvoll (b. 1965 Trondheim, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) for a solo exhibition at the Haus am Waldsee, Berlin where she will show unpublished material from the last eight years. The artist states that ‘I always worked with seriality and this time I wish to break it up, to dissolve the serial element and make a more fluid connection between the images’. According to the curator, Tronvoll’s practice ‘is based on a great respect for her sitters and brings out traces of pure joie de vivre which shine forth in the moment of isolation and distance to modern event culture’.\n\nCurator: Dr. Katja Blomberg, director, Haus am Waldsee, Berlin, Germany\n\nSupport provided towards travel and accommodation for Bjørn Hegardt (b. 1974 Ørebro, Sweden lives and works in Berlin, Germany) who will present Fukt Magazine-for contemporary drawing at PrintRoom, Rotterdam, Netherlands. Hegart will present the magazine together with a selection of drawings from the contributors. According to the artist, ’the display will be set up as an installation together with the publications’. In connection with the exhibition there will also be an artist talk/lecture concerning Hegart´s artistic practice and the publishing project. In addition, the new issue of Fukt number 10 will be launched.\n\nCurator: Karin de Jong and Ewoud van Rijn directors of PrintRoom, Rotterdam\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Sissel Tolaas (b. 1961 Stavanger, Norway, lives and works in Berlin, Germany) in the group exhibition ‘TALK TO ME’ at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY, USA. She will present her work BERLIN, smellresearchproject 2004-2011. Tolaas has done extensive research on the local smell identity of four different areas of Berlin. She states that ‘the four individual areas were carefully analysed for characteristics in aspect of a local smell identity for each site’. She goes on to explain that ‘In our society, at least, smell is too underdeveloped a sense for it to speak for itself, despite the claims of perfume ads’. The results of the analyses will lead to the development of a vocabulary that will be used in the presentation of the project. Other participating artists include Mayo Nissen, Electronic Ink, Evan Roth, Emily Read and Chen Hsu, among others.\n\nCurator: Paola Anton Elli Senior, curator, Department of Architecture and Design, Museum of Modern Art, New York, USA\n\nSupport provided for Rachel Dagnall (b. 1972 in Liverpool, UK, lives and works in Nesoddtangen, Norway) in the context of the artist group Henry VIII´s Wives, to participate in the group exhibition ‘A Future Pump House’ at the Pumphouse Gallery, London, UK. Due to funding cuts, the Pumphouse, along with many other galleries, has been forced to make significant changes as a result of the spending review. Henry VIII’s Wives intends to make a site-specific work, which, according to Dagnall, will function as ‘an artistic evaluation of the current economic political situation in the UK for galleries, museums and art institutions and a consideration of their future roles’. Other participating artists include Jonathan Allen, Simon Faithfull, Thomas Kilpper, Christian Jankowski, Bik van der Pol and Richard Wentworth.\n\nCurator: Nick Aikens, independent curator and writer based in London, UK\n\nSupport provided to Los Angeles Nomadic Division (LAND), Los Angeles, CA, USA for the participation of Matias Faldbakken (b.1973 in Hobro, Denmark, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in ‘Nothing Besides Remains’, a large-scale, site and situation specific exhibition in Marfa, Texas. The exhibition comprises a series of public projects. Faldbakken will present FREIGHT TRAIN SCULPTURE, a project that will be pushed off a freight train in motion. Faldbakken indicates that ‘the train cutting through the city (day and night) was one of the most impressive things about Marfa and I immediately thought of somehow borrowing that image in order to try to lend it to an artwork’. The idea is for the sculpture to be pushed off the train at night, when no one or few people will see it.\n\nCurator: Shamim M. Momin, curator and director of Los Angeles Nomadic Division.\n\nSupport has been provided for the first solo exhibition in London, UK, by Marte Eknæs (b. 1978 Elverum, Norway, lives and works in Berlin, Germany). ‘Escalate’ is the title of a site specific installation consisting of two and three dimensional works that, according to the curator, ‘explore and expand the idea of sculpture’. Connected through various manifestations of circular shapes and motion present in the looped video and mechanics of the escalator, the works come together in a multi-faceted formal investigation. By including urban planning elements designed for protection and control of our movement such as anti-slip tape, a bollard and a panic bar, ‘Eknæs raises issues of how devices and objects are used to shape behaviour in public space’. These features taken out of their original context are not only present in the exhibition as a political comment, but simultaneously claim their presence as sculptural objects.’ Curator: Wolfgang Tillmans, artist and director of Between Bridges, London, UK\n\nSupport provided to the 4th Fotofestival Mannheim Ludwigshafen Heidelberg, Germany, for the participation of Torbjørn Rødland (b. 1970 in Stavanger, Norway, lives and works in Los Angeles, USA and Oslo, Norway) in the exhibition ‘THE EYE IS A LONELY HUNTER’. The 4th Fotofestival Mannheim Ludwigshafen Heidelberg’s project description states that the theme ‘unfolds as a photographic testimony of insights into all the stages of life from birth to coming of age, adulthood, old age, and death’. Further ‘The Festival will organise artist-talks, discussions and screenings.’ According to curators Solvej Helweg Ovesen and Katerina Gregos ‘Rødland has been making work that baffles, finding commonality between nudists, priests, Nordic landscapes and curious still-lifes of food, such as one of George W. Bush's favourite things: Diet Coke, tortilla chips, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Häagen-Dazs \"Pralines & Cream\" and Field of Dreams’.\n\nCurators: Katerina Gregos, independent art historian and museologist, specialised in lens-based media, based in Brussels, Belgium and Solvej Helweg Ovesen, independent curator and cultural studies theoretician based in Berlin and Copenhagen.\n\nSupport provided to Kunstmuseum Bern, Bern, Switzerland for Knut Henrik Henriksen’s (b.1970 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Berlin, Germany) participation in the group exhibition ‘Rectangle and square: From Picasso to Judd’. Henriksen will present A Story about the Sun, the Moon and the Water Leak, a special site-specific project in dialogue with the other works and artists of the Rupf Collection. According to curator Susanne Friedli ’Knut Henrik Henriksen is – because of his interest and his closeness with abstract and constructivist art – a perfect “partner” to develop and realize a project like this.’ Henriksens idea is to work a certain location in the museum, temporary installed walls that cover the two only windows in the Museum.\n\nCurator; Susanne Friedli, manager and curator at the Kunstmuseum Bern, Switzerland\n\nSupport has been provided to the 12th Istanbul Biennial for the participation of Michael Elmgreen (b.1961 Copenhagen, Denmark lives and works in Oslo Norway and Berlin, Germany) and Ingar Dragset (b.1969 Trondheim, Norway, lives and works, Oslo, Norway and Berlin, Germany) at the 12th Istanbul Biennial with their work The Incidental Self. The curators describe the work as a ‘a large shelving system that occupies a wide wall space with 500 smaller framed photographs of various gay cultural and everyday life situations on display. The display references the standard family photo set-up found in almost any home around the world, but is exaggerated both in terms of quantity and in its definition of \"family\". The installation highlights alternative modes of living’. The 12th Istanbul Biennial will explore the relationship between art and politics, focusing on works that are both formally innovative and politically outspoken. Curators: Adriano Pedrosa, founding director of Programa Independente da Escola São Paulo (PIESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil and Jens Hoffmann, director, CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco, USA\n\nSupport provided to the contemporary art festival Printemps de Septembre, Toulouse, France for the participation of Fredrik Vaerslev (b. 1979 Moss, Norway, lives and works in Drøbak, Norway) and Matias Faldbakken (b. 1973 in Hobro, Denmark, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition ‘D’un autre monde’. According to the curator, ‘the artists chosen to participate in this exhibition all have in common a tendency not to represent the world as it is, but to propose abstract, imaginary universes that are anchored in an elsewhere, or otherwise’. The exhibition will be dispersed across the city, and also in its environs. Artists who are chosen for the exhibition work in various techniques, as they are painters, sculptors, performance and video artists who present wide possibilities of expression. Other participating artists include Ei Arakawa, Karla Black, Joe Bradley and Roberto Cuoghi, among others.\n\nCurator: Anne Pontegnie, Artistic Director, Printemps de Septembre, Toulouse, France\n\nSupport provided to Grazer Kunstverein, Graz, Austria for the participation of Helene Sommer (b. 1978 Oslo, Norway, lives and works Oslo, Norway and Berlin, Germany) in the international group exhibition ‘Public Folklore’. The exhibition will question the function of folklorism within nationalist politics. According to curator Søren Grammel, ‘the project is pivotal and necessary now because a constantly increasing tendency to national self-construction has been evident in culture and politics in all the countries of Europe for several years’. The works included in ‘Public Folklore’ will critically explore the phenomena of folklore in current politics, media, tourism, popular culture and commercialism. Sommer will present A Tale of Stone and Wood, which she describes as ‘more than relevant for the concept of the show as it examines the role of film production in the construction of history, national identity and collective memory’. Other participating artists include Eva Arnqvist, Annika Eriksson, Roza El-Hassan, Andreas Fogarasi, Folk Archive / Jeremy Deller and Alan Kane, among others.\n\nCurator: Søren Grammel, artistic director, Grazer Kunstverein; Graz, Austria\n\nSupport provided to Naoshi Okura (b. 1977 Kobe, Japan lives and works Kobe, Japan) for the transport and insurance of art by Kjersti Andvig, Ane Graff, Kim Hiorthøy and Magnus Vatvedt in his project ‘VOID289’, which is organized as one of the official programmes of KOBE Biennale 2011. ‘VOID289’ will function as a temporary art space where Okura intends to introduce contemporary and emerging artists from around the world. He states that the plan is ‘to hold several exhibitions as a project director during the biennale period and to construct a meeting place between global/local artists and audiences through this project’. Other participating artists TBA.\n\nCurators: Naoshi Okura project director, VOID289, and co-curator Are Blytt, artist and curator based in Oslo, Norway, the Kobe Biennial 2011, Kobe, Japan\n\nSupport provided for Øystein Aasan (b. 1977 Kristiansand, Norway, lives and works in Berlin Germany) to participate within the group exhibition ‘Totem and Taboo’ at Museum Quartier, Vienna, Austria with his project LORD MELODY. The work is an assembly of acoustic platforms that are made with the intension to create a diffusion of the ambient sounds in the rooms of the Museum Quartier. According to the artist, ‘the platforms are brought forward equally as a conceptual idea, as well as underlining the functional aspect, with the changes it makes to the ambient sound of the space. This change is constituted on two levels, one in terms of acoustics and thereby changing the architecture and one visual also changing the architecture and the display of the works in the exhibition’. Other participating artists include Stephane Barbier Bouvet, Paolo Chiasera, Jan De Cock, Martino Gamper, Jeppe Hein, Lisa Lapinski and Rodney LaTourelle, among others.\n\nCurator: Dr. Elena Aguido, a member of the curatorial team of Museum Quartier, Vienna, Austria\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Are Blytt (b. 1981 Bergen, Norway lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the Kobe Biennale 2011 in Kobe, Japan. Are Blytt will contribute to the biennale as an artist, and as a co-curator of ‘VOID289’, which, according to the artist, ‘is a temporary space focusing on Scandinavian contemporary art’ for which Blytt will produce five paper works. According to curator Naoshi Okura, the goal of the biennale is ‘to build a meeting place between global and local artists and audience’. Other participating artists include Kjersti Andvig, Ane Graff, Kim Hiorthøy and Magnus Vatvedt.\n\nCurator: Naoshi Okura, project director for ‘VOID289’, official project of the Kobe Biennial 2011, Kobe, Japan.\n\nSupport provided to Mari Meen Halsøy (b. 1978 in Porsgrunn, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) for her participation in the Beirut Street Festival 2011 with the performance A Perfectly Safe Hide-out. According Halsøy, the work draws upon ‘questions and situations inspired by “real life” conditions, politics, social structures and (hi)stories of society’. Together with Sara Christophersen and Helle Siljeholm she has created a site-specific performance combining dance, visual art and music in which she attempts to ‘heal the wounds from the war with tapestry’. The project will show in the Barakat Building/Beit Beirut on 1 and 2 October 2011. Built in 1924, Beit Beirut used to house upper middle class families until the outbreak of the civil war in 1975, when it became a vantage point for snipers due to its strategic location on the dividing ‘Green Line’. In 1997 it was sentenced for demolition, but was saved in 2003 by the efforts of officials, architects, heritage activists, journalists and NGOs. This is the first and last time a performance is being staged in the building, which is scheduled for restoration to accommodate the ’Museum of Memory’, tracing the 7000-year history of the city. According to the artist, 'the ravaged location can be read as a symbol of the wounds, stories and experiences of the city's people. The tapestries, some of which are designed to fit and mounted in the building's wounds, could in this context be conceived as a gesture to heal and repair the impact of war’. The Beirut Street Festival 2011 is curated by director Moustapha Yamouth.\n\nSupport provided for Bodil Furu (b.1976 Askim, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) towards travel and accommodation related to her participation in the exhibition ‘Nordic Art Today’ which takes place at Loft Project Etazhi, in St. Petersburg, Russia, November 2011. The Norwegian curator Kari Brandtzæg has selected Furu´s work Zero (2009) for inclusion in the exhibition. According to the artist, ‘Nordic Art Today’ is a ‘collaborative project between curators and artists from Nordic countries and North West of Russia. The main focus of the project is to discover curatorial and artistic reflections on the most challenging social issues that the Nordic region faces in the first decade of the 21st century’. The exhibition is curated by an international curatorial team: Birta Gudjonsdottir (Iceland), Anna Bitkina (Russia), Power Ekroth (Sweden), Aura Seikkula (Finland) and Simon Sheikh (Denmark). Project 'Nordic Art Today' is initiated and organised by Creative Association of Curators TOK, St Petersburg\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Danger Museum consisting of Øyvind Renberg (b.1976 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Berlin, Germany) and Miho Shimizu (b.1976 in Tokyo, Japan, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition ‘Museum Show: Part 2’ at Arnolfini, Bristol, UK. According to the artists, ‘Danger Museum will approach their participation in the 'Museum Show: Part 2' with the creation of a mini-retrospective’. According to curator Nav Haq, 'Museum Show’ will be ‘a large-scale exhibition – a museum of museums – displaying this comprehensive selection of highly idiosyncratic, fictional institutions’.\n\nCurator: Nav Haq, curator, Arnolfini, Bristol ,UK\n\nSupport provided for the realisation of three solo exhibitions by Dubravka Duba Sambolec (b. 1949 Ljubljana, Slovenia, lives and works in Oslo, Norway). The exhibitions will be held in three different non-profit galleries: ŠKUC Gallery, Ljubljana, Slovenia, Centre for Contemporary Arts, Celje, Slovenia (2012) and Croatian Artists Association, Zagreb, Croatia (2013). According to the artist, ‘the installation of the exhibitions will take form in concentrated areas of works with large empty spaces between them and will be reminiscent of different territories’. Dubravka goes on to state that ‘the project comprises textual drawings printed on the indoor banner media, drawings, wall pieces, sculptures, neon text and video performance’. Curator for the three solo-exhibitions: Ursa Jurmann, independent, curator, critic, editor, researcher and organizer in the field of visual arts, based in Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Toril Johannessen (b.1978 in Trondheim, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway), Matias Faldbakken (b. 1973 in Hobro, Denmark, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Åase Texmon Rygh (b.1925 in Troms, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) within dOCUMENTA 13 in Kassel, Germany. Faldbakken will contribute with the publication series 100 Notes-100 Thoughts. Both Åase Texmon Rygh and Toril Johannesen will be a part of the constellation 'When you step inside it is filled with seeds'- a project that revolves around notions of biodiversity and ecology. According to curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, one of the main challenges is 'to move exhibition planning and presentation beyond a traditional format– from being an 'exhibition' to becoming a 'constellation' of interrelated temporalities, cultural fields, spaces, places, histories, artworks and other possibilities of engaging with art and the world at large'.\n\nCurator: Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, Artistic Director, Kassel, Germany\n\nSupport provided for the research and development of a traveling solo exhibition by the artist Hariton Pushwagner (b.1940 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) organized by the Milton Keynes Gallery, Milton Keynes, UK. The curators Natalie T. Hope O'Donnell (b.1979 in Lørenskog, Norway, lives and works in London, UK) and Anthony Spira write of a particular resonance between the works of the artist and Milton Keynes with 'its high-rise buildings, precise grid system and vistas of parking lots evoking the atomised existence of Pushwagner's Soft City workers, a graphic novel which was completed in London in 1976'. The exhibition will travel to the Boijmans Museum, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and the organisers are currently also negotiating relationships with institutions in Norway. A comprehensive, illustrated catalogue will accompany the exhibition. Curators: Anthony Spira, director of Milton Keynes Gallery and Natalie Hope O'Donnell, independent curator, based in London, UK\n\nSupport provided for 'Life in Schools #2', a seven-day workshop and exhibition at the International Academy of Art, Ramallah, Palestine. According to the project curator Ane Hjort Guttu (b.1971, Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), the main purpose of the workshop and exhibition is to place 'greater emphasis on self-reflection and discussion about pedagogy, student and teacher roles and art education, in the art academy'. Developed in collaboration with artists Jeanette Christensen (b.1958 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Jesper Alvær (b.1973 in Copenhagen, Denmark, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), the project also highlights the very different 'situational frameworks' of art education in Norway and Palestine as a reflection of the 'wider political and international economic realities of the two countries'. Organiser: Ane Hjort Guttu, artist and undertaker for workshop, International Academy of Art Palestine\n\nSupport provided for a solo exhibition by Stein Rønning (b.1953 in Askim, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) at Gallery D.O.R., a new non-profit artist-run space in Brussels, Belgium. The artist will produce four photographs and employ an actor, who will repeat a spoken text to all of the visitors to the gallery. Rønning says that the project 'is about formal repetition and situational difference'. The spoken text will also form the basis of a small publication produced for the exhibition. Curator: Sverre Gullesen, Gallery D.O.R and Stein Rønning\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Torpedo Press (Elin Maria Olaussen b.1975 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway; Karen Tandberg b.1976 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway; and Eivind Slettemeås b.1974 in Bø, Norway, lives and works in Harpefoss, Norway), Oslo, Norway, in the PA/PER VIEW Art Book Fair at Wiels Contemporary Art Centre, Brussels, Belgium.

According to the curators, the exhibition 'aims at opening a space for multiple projects suggesting and testing other realities of life from small-scale artistic tryouts to larger social experiments'. Sonjasdotter will present the project 'A Potato Perspective on the Relation Between Matter and Content; Part I; The Research', which she says 'looks into power and knowledge structures in relation to breeding' by focusing 'on the potato plant, since it has played a major role for the demographic and economic development in Europe since The Enlightenment'. Curators: Franziska Lesak, Berit Fischer, Moira Zoitl and Dorothee Albrecht, the curatorial team for 'Other Possible Worlds'\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Book & Hedén (Carina Hedén b.1948 in Mora, Sweden, lives and works in Oslo, Norway and Ingrid Book b. 1951 in Malmø, Sweden, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition 'Extreme Crafts' (working title) at the Freies Museum, Berlin, Germany. According to curator Ulrike Solbrig, the exhibition investigates 'current approaches in art that deal with the ethical and aesthetic dimension of craft and its potency as an idea in art'. Book & Hedén plan to develop a photo-based project around the new E6 highway between Oslo and Gothenburg, which will explore what they term 'mobile vision' or a new experience of landscape from a mobile viewpoint. Curator: Ulrike Solbrig, independent curator based in Germany\n\nSupport provided to the Kalmar Konstmuseum, Kalmar, Sweden, for the participation of Kjersti Andvig (b.1978 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Ivan Galuzin (b.1979 in Murmansk, Russia, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Jumana Manna (b.1987 in New Jersey, USA, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Kristian Skylstad (b.1982 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition 'The Return of the Losers'. According to the curator Martin Schibli, many of the artists in the exhibition can be 'seen as provocative', but 'they have not taken the role of the victim; on the contrary, they are embracing the new world and its possibilities, and at the same time take a critical stand towards the old ideologies'. Other participating artists include Dahn Vo, Sören Thilo Funder, Klas Eriksson, Theis Wendt, Elin Magnusson and Tamar Guimaraes, among others. Curator: Martin Schibli, director of exhibitions, Kalmar Konstmuseum\n\nSupport provided for the development of 'A Thin Line Between Art and Activism', a project organised by the artists Victor Mutelekesha (b.1976 in Chililabombwe, Zambia, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Samuel Ghitui at the Kuona Trust art space, Nairobi, Kenya. According to the artists, this two-week festival of 'unhindered expression' will articulate 'more progressive, positive and fair approaches to social, political and economical issues that affect the voiceless and marginalised groups in society who are ironically the majority in numbers alone'. In addition to using the art space as a base of operations, the artists will produce public interventions in the streets and parks of Nairobi as a means to 'retrace the hotspots of violence' during the contested elections of 2008. Organiser: Danda Jaroljmek, director, Kuona Trust, Nairobi, Kenya\n\nSupport provided to Arnolfini, Bristol, UK for the participation of Matias Faldbakken (b.1973 in Hobro, Denmark, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the group exhibition 'Magical Consciousness'. According to the curator Runa Islam, the exhibition revolves around her own 'research interests into the act of looking and reflexive forms of lens-based representation' as a means to approach other artists' work 'for the potential that comes out of denying or obscuring images'. Faldbakken will present his work Untitled (Outline) (2009), which is described as 'an unknown word sprayed onto the wall, layered over and over again, until the paint runs out from the can, and the word is obliterated because of the amount of paint'. Other participating artists include Rosângela Rennó, Ellen Harvey and Helena Almeida, among others. Curator: Nav Haq, exhibitions curator and Runa Islam, co-curator, Arnolfini\n\nSupport provided to the Kristinehamns Konstmuseum, Kristinehamns, Sweden, for the participation of Gardar Eide Einarsson (b.1976 in Oslo, Norway, lives and works in NY, USA), Tor Børresen (b.1963 in Hamar, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway), Snorre Ytterstad (b.1968, in Bodø, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) and Monica Winther(b.1976 in Bergen, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in the exhibition 'Nordic Darkness'. According to the curators Staffan Boije af Gennäs and Johan Zetterquist, the exhibition looks at the development of 'music genres such as Drone and Black Metal' over the last decade as 'significant cultural exports from Norway and Sweden' as a means to investigate the 'common denominators' between the art and music scenes. Other participating artists include Daniel Andersson, Roger Andersson,Veronica Brovall, Stiina Saaristo and Banks Violette, among others. Curators: Staffan Boije af Gennäs and Johan Zetterquist, independent curators based in Sweden\n\nSupport provided to the Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, for the participation of Toril Johannessen (b.1978 in Trondheim, Norway, lives and works in Bergen, Norway) in the group exhibition 'The End of Money'. According to curator Juan Gaitan, the exhibition is a 'reflection on the different fears, hopes and expectations associated with the end of money as the primary standard of value', which also investigates 'the limits that the contemporary economic structure imposes on the imagination, and on the imagination as the cause of the present conception of the economy'. Other participating artists include Pierre Bismuth, Peter Fischli and David Weiss, Vishal Jugdeo Agnieszka Kurant and Lawrence Weiner, among others. Curator: Juan Gaitán, curator, Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art\n\nSupport provided to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Roskilde, Denmark, for the participation of Tori Wrånes (b.1978 in Kristiansand, Norway, lives and works in Los Angeles, USA) and Jana Winderen (b.1965 in Bodø, Norway, lives and works in Oslo, Norway) in ACTS — Festival for Performative Arts.

According to curator Bice Curiger, 'the term \"nations\" in \"ILLUMInations\" applies metaphorically to recent developments in the arts all over the world, where overlapping groups form collectives of people representing a wide variety of smaller, more local activities and mentalities'. The artist is currently developing an installation of found object sculptures and paintings specifically for the exhibition. Other participating artists include Monica Bonvicini, James Turrell, Nicholas Hlobo, Carol Bove, and Oscar Tuazon, among others.

According to curator Valentinas Klimasauskas, the exhibition is 'researching the possibility of the functioning of artworks and exhibitions as universes within another universe' by focusing 'on collaborations and networking by artists from across the Nordic and Baltic region'. Krunglevicius and Hvamen will produce a public work that will function as 'an audio guide based upon a text by the artist Douglas Gordon', which 'is heavily contextualized and inspired by literature, immateriality and the use of language in contemporary art'. Curator: Valentinas Klimasauskas, independent curator based in Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nSupport provided for the participation of Morten Norbye Halvorsen (b.1980 in Stavanger, Norway, lives and works in Paris, France) in the group exhibition 'MORE OR LESS, A FEW POCKET UNIVERSES' at Gallery Augusta (in conjunction with the Helsinki International Artist-in-Residence Programme (HIAP)) on the island of Suomenlinna, Helsinki, Finland.
