        "text": "About the game\n\nExplore remarkable landmarks in an entertaining manner. We blend gamification with sightseeing to offer a unique and engaging experience! Teams will traverse 23 locations at Oscarsborg and tackle diverse tasks. Equipped with a map and a tablet as their trusty tools, teams won't have time to visit every spot, so a strategic plan is essential. Given the variety of tasks, each team member can make a valuable contribution. Typically, the winning team excels in effective teamwork, creativity, and a strong desire to win!\n\nKlikk for Ã¥ se ->\n\nThe Map\n\nTogether with the tablet, each group will receive a physical map featuring the game's 23 checkpoints. These checkpoints offer varying point values based on their geographical distance. At each location, you'll encounter diverse missions that can earn you additional points. Crafting a strategy is a wise move: Do you aim to tackle the checkpoints with the longest distance and the highest point rewards, or do you prioritize visiting more checkpoints that are closer by but offer fewer points? As you move between checkpoints in the game, you'll also receive additional tasks on the tablet to help boost your score!\n\nKlikk for Ã¥ se ->\n\nThe content of the game\n\nThe game contains a wide range of different tasks. Teams compete in a creative point hunt and sightseeing activity where they visit the locations on the map. The locations selected are specifically interesting for the area you are in. You won't have time to visit all the locations, so you need to create a strategy. The game includes quiz, brain teasers, riddles, poems, sound clips, video tasks, and photo tasks.\n\nKlikk for Ã¥ se ->\n\nPractical information\n\nLet's Play provides an activity complete with all instructions and equipment for the group.
