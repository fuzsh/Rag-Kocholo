Born in 1908, Lansdale was a swashbuckling Air Force officer who (though he long hid the fact) worked in the Philippines from 1945 until 1954 for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and its successor spy agency, the CIA. His exploits there won him a transfer to Vietnam, where his accomplishments in 1954 and 1955 “proved that one man and his vision can make a difference in history,” wrote Neil Sheehan in A Bright Shining Lie (1988), still the best book on the Vietnam War. Without Lansdale, “the American venture in Vietnam would have foundered at the outset…. South Vietnam, it can truly be said, was [his] creation.” An official CIA history of the war concluded that Lansdale was responsible for the agency’s “most substantial achievement” in the twenty years of the conflict.\n\nAnd yet if you watched the recent Ken Burns–Lynn Novick documentary on Vietnam, you heard just one brief reference to Lansdale, never saw him, and never learned about his critical contributions in the mid-1950s. This lack of serious attention to Lansdale is not unusual—Sheehan’s book was an exception. One other exception was a hagiographic 1988 biography of him written with his cooperation by Cecil B. Currey, a professor at the University of South Florida. Today Lansdale is primarily remembered by aficionados of the war and by many of us for whom Vietnam was a personal experience. Most books about Vietnam include few references to him, or none at all.\n\nOne enduring source of his fame may be the oft-repeated tale that he was the model for Graham Greene’s Alden Pyle, the antihero of The Quiet American. The fictional Pyle was a romantic young CIA agent stationed in Saigon in the early 1950s who tried to promote a “third force,” neither pro-French nor Communist. He and Lansdale shared some attributes, particularly a naive confidence in their own capacity to shape Asian realities, but Greene didn’t need Lansdale as a model. He finished his novel more than a year before Lansdale arrived in Vietnam.*\n\nMax Boot has now put Lansdale back where he belongs, at the center of the story of the war. A fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who is an Op-Ed columnist for The Washington Post, Boot has the reputation of a “Never Trump” neoconservative, but his book is the product of serious scholarship, not ideology. Boot has scoured the archives and found intriguing new material, especially Lansdale’s revealing personal letters to his long-suffering wife and his Filipino mistress, who became the second Mrs. Lansdale in the last years of his life. The Road Not Taken is an admiring but also critical biography; it invites many quibbles but rewards the reader with an engrossing portrait of a unique figure who defied the bureaucratic values of the institutions in which he served.\n\nEdward Lansdale was present at the creation of the Vietnam War, which really began in 1954 with the invention of a new country, South Vietnam. In the course of ten months beginning that June, Lansdale enjoyed his greatest successes. He made Ngo Dinh Diem the functioning leader of a state devised on the fly to try to impede the spread of communism. He orchestrated clandestine psychological warfare and organized an ambitious US Navy flotilla that brought 900,000 Vietnamese, mostly Catholics, from North Vietnam to the south, a propaganda coup. In April 1955, when many American officials had concluded that Diem could never lead a successful nationalist movement, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles approved a cable announcing withdrawal of American support for him. But Lansdale intervened with both Diem and the Eisenhower administration, which reversed Dulles’s decision. That maneuver preserved American support for Diem and his creation, the country we came to know as South Vietnam. The zeal of subsequent American administrations to save that creation led us fatefully to war.\n\nAbsent Lansdale’s personal involvement, Diem’s rump state would likely have disappeared soon after the 1954 Geneva conference on peace in Indochina had provided the pretext for its creation. Had it been absorbed then into the new Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which Ho Chi Minh and his comrades ruled from Hanoi, the US would not have squandered 58,220 American and more than two million Vietnamese lives. We would have saved hundreds of billions of dollars and avoided one of the greatest disasters of American history.\n\nLansdale cannot be blamed for those catastrophes. In the two decades that followed his feats in the mid-1950s, American policymakers usually ignored his advice. He favored trying to win hearts and minds, not gunfights. He argued against many of the policy choices that made Vietnam so catastrophic, especially the decision to send a huge American expeditionary force to fight a conventional military campaign against the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. Lansdale believed that only a Vietnamese army that had the political support of the people, under the leadership of a popular national leader, could win the war.\n\nBut he was not an innocent bystander. His actions made the kind of big war he hoped we could avoid more likely. In 1961, Lansdale helped persuade his admirer John F. Kennedy to let the thousands of American military “advisers” in Vietnam fight in combat beside the South Vietnamese army units they were training. This led to the first American casualties and deepened the American commitment to what proved to be a hopeless cause.\n\nAnd Lansdale eagerly engaged in intense meddling in South Vietnamese affairs, beginning as soon as he took up his post as a CIA operative in Saigon in June 1954. Meddling was a tactic he had learned in the Philippines several years earlier, when, as an agent of the new CIA’s secret Office of Policy Coordination based in Manila, he cultivated a personal friendship with Ramon Magsaysay, a Filipino congressman who became his country’s minister of defense and then, in 1953, its president.\n\nLansdale was Magsaysay’s intimate adviser. Together they guided a successful counterinsurgency against the Huks, a left-wing insurgency group whose soldiers had fought first against the Japanese occupation of their country and later against its postwar government. Magsaysay famously won the support of the peasants the Huks sought to organize against his government, and squelched the rebellion.\n\nLansdale learned from Magsaysay the importance of treating peasants and soldiers with dignity and respect, skills he retained. Magsaysay’s honest, nationalist regime and his personal popularity provided a model for coping with left-wing insurgencies that beguiled American officials. For years afterward, his experience with Magsaysay contributed to “a certain mystique,” in the words of a former colleague, that Lansdale avidly cultivated. “He was the leader of [a] cult,” said Daniel Ellsberg, the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971, years after he worked for Lansdale in Vietnam. “I was a member of that cult.”\n\n“He became the go-to guru,” said Leslie H. Gelb, the former official and journalist who supervised the compilation of the Pentagon Papers between 1967 and 1968. “That was the source of his power.”\n\nIt was Lansdale’s experience in the Philippines that persuaded Allen Dulles, the CIA director, to send him to Vietnam in 1954. Dulles and his colleagues hoped that Lansdale could apply what he had learned to the newest Asian flashpoint and help block further Communist victories in a far-off land little understood by Americans, even the officials responsible for US policy.\n\nThat lack of understanding was crippling. The American officials who gave us the Vietnam War were, to a man, ignorant about Vietnam’s history, culture, and politics. Lansdale was no exception. He had made himself an expert on the Philippines, a former American possession where English was widely spoken and American ways were mimicked and admired. He spent three years as a military officer stationed there, traveling throughout the country, making local friends, and learning the lore and the folk music (some of which he liked to play on his ever-present harmonica) even before he became an intelligence operative secretly counseling Magsaysay.\n\n“By contrast,” writes Boot, “when he arrived in Vietnam, [Lansdale] had previously spent only three weeks [Boot’s italics] in the country and had as of yet made no Vietnamese friends.” He spoke not a word of Vietnamese—like most of the Americans who served in Vietnam, he never learned the language—and just a smattering of French, which Diem and all members of the colonial-era Vietnamese elite spoke fluently. He knew almost nothing of Vietnam’s complex society or of its ancient history. Nevertheless, he was ready to conclude, twenty-four days after he landed in Saigon, that Ngo Dinh Diem was the best available candidate to be a Vietnamese Magsaysay—a leader capable of rallying Vietnamese who wanted to keep the south out of the grips of Ho Chi Minh.\n\nThis was a doubtful proposition. As Sheehan wrote, when Diem returned to Vietnam from four years of exile in the US and Belgium—as a new premier appointed by the emperor Bao Dai, a French quisling so close to the old colonial power that he actually lived in France—he was “almost as ignorant as Lansdale was of the political and social realities of his country.” Diem’s ignorance, Sheehan noted, “was willful. He was a mystic. He lived in a mental cocoon spun out of a nostalgic reverie for Vietnam’s imperial past.” Diem had none of Magsaysay’s personal charisma; he “fit no one’s image of a dynamic leader,” as Boot puts it. “Best available” he may have been, but as subsequent events made clear, he was not good enough.\n\nDiem landed in Saigon on June 25, barely three weeks after Lansdale’s arrival. That first day Lansdale mingled with citizens of Saigon who were waiting to see their newly appointed leader on his motorcade from Ton Son Nhut Airport into the city. Landsale was impressed by the level of public curiosity, and by Diem’s political clumsiness. He rode into town in a sedan with closed windows, invisible to the crowd on the street, never stopping to greet any of his new countrymen.\n\nThis did not deter Lansdale from spending the rest of that day and the entire night writing an unsolicited memo to Diem offering detailed suggestions on how to run a new country. He offered extensive, specific advice: bring several existing militia groups into a new South Vietnamese army; organize a coalition of anti-Communist political parties; organize forums in towns and villages where citizens could share their concerns with government officials; immediately adopt a constitution like the one Lansdale helped Magsaysay write for the Philippines; and more.\n\nThis was extraordinarily presumptuous: a newcomer who knew almost no national history and spoke no Vietnamese presuming to tell a recently appointed leader just back from four years of exile—a man with no apparent political skills—how to run a brand-new country that the newcomer had known for just twenty-five days. Boot is less troubled by this temerity than seems warranted, and more impressed that Diem decided he liked Lansdale—an opening Lansdale used to cultivate a friendship with this strange man. But Boot does acknowledge that Diem ignored the recommendations in that first Lansdale memo, just as he ignored much more advice in the years that followed.\n\nWinning the friendship of Asians may have been Lansdale’s greatest talent. Boot writes about his skill as a listener who knew how to show respect for people who were used to colonial white men bossing them around like children. Lansdale himself, writes Boot, was “utterly devoid of condescension and racism.” The sympathetic friendship he offered to Magsaysay made Lansdale, over time, a surrogate member of the Magsaysay family. Soon after his arrival in Vietnam he achieved a similar status in Diem’s.\n\nLansdale favored an aggressive American presence in post-Geneva Vietnam. “In order to construct a Free Vietnam which can be an effective bulwark against further Communist aggression in Southeast Asia,” he cabled his CIA superiors in July 1954, “the United States must accept a dominant and direct role in aiding the country.” The best that can be said about that cable is that it fit the mood of the times in Washington, where the Dulles brothers still dreamed of “rolling back” communism. A harsher but more accurate appraisal would be that in a single sentence, Lansdale encapsulated the vainglorious American attitude that produced the war in Vietnam.\n\nThe productive phase of Lansdale’s involvement in Vietnam essentially ended with the completion of his first tour of duty as a CIA operative in Saigon in December 1956. The CIA had no next assignment for him (he was never popular inside the agency) so Lansdale resumed his military career as an Air Force colonel.\n\nAlways good at self-promotion, he began to make a name for himself inside the Pentagon as an expert on the newly fashionable field of unconventional and guerrilla warfare. Soon he had a job directing the Office of Special Operations, which advised the secretary of defense on all types of unconventional war. Vietnam became one of the office’s preoccupations. In 1959 and again in 1960 Lansdale visited Vietnam to evaluate the guerrilla war that by then posed an ongoing threat to Diem.\n\nBy 1960 the South Vietnamese Communists were widening their influence, especially in the populous Mekong Delta. Bickering politicians in Saigon bedeviled Diem. In April 1960, he formally asked the US to send Lansdale back to Saigon to help him. The idea was controversial inside the Eisenhower administration; many officials thought Lansdale was a loose cannon beyond the control of the normal chain of command. Finally a deal was struck to allow him to visit Diem, but on a short leash.\n\nThe visit finally took place in January 1961 and lasted just twelve days. On the way home Lansdale wrote an alarming report on his findings. “1961 promises to be a fateful year for Vietnam,” it began; he found the Communists poised to make substantial advances. He defended Diem but lambasted the stiff American ambassador in Saigon, a blueblood named Elbridge Durbrow whom Diem disliked. He outlined what Boot calls an “overly ambitious” program to reconstitute the US mission with new people and a new sense of purpose. He warned that Diem’s grip on power was uncertain at best.\n\nLansdale’s timing was excellent. His report made it to Walt W. Rostow, an MIT professor then working on the transition team preparing for John F. Kennedy to take power a few days later. Rostow was so impressed that he put Lansdale’s report at the top of a pile of important reading for JFK. Thus began one of the most interesting periods of Lansdale’s career. He was soon being touted, even by Kennedy, as a possible new American ambassador to Saigon or commander of the military assistance group there. Both were jobs Lansdale knew did not suit his talents or interests. But he was fully prepared to lead a new Presidential Task Force for Vietnam and to oversee the implementation of that task force’s plan in Washington and Saigon.\n\nThe posturing and bureaucratic maneuvering that followed ended badly for Lansdale, apparently because of his talent—on display repeatedly throughout his career—for alienating colleagues, especially superiors. Boot shows that Kennedy’s secretaries of state and defense, Dean Rusk and Robert S. McNamara, both lost confidence in Lansdale and blocked him from further participation in policymaking. This is the only episode Boot recounts that he cannot really explain. “Lansdale had tried but failed to take control of the Kennedy administration’s policy toward Vietnam,” he writes. Boot quotes Lansdale’s own explanation that Kennedy “severely damaged” his influence by suggesting he might be the American ambassador or military commander in Vietnam. That just inflamed jealous colleagues who disliked him, Lansdale thought.\n\nKennedy’s admiration for Lansdale survived, however, and got him an influential new job as chief of operations of the super-secret Operation Mongoose, an idea promoted by the president and his brother Robert, the attorney general, to try to repay Fidel Castro for the humiliation of the Bay of Pigs fiasco of 1961 with a covert campaign of harassment and perhaps assassination, none of which got anywhere. Boot devotes twenty pages to this sad tale, recounting the “nutty schemes” (the phrase is CIA director Richard Helms’s) that remained hidden from public view until the 1975 hearings of the Church Committee investigation of CIA dirty tricks. Those hearings did “irrevocable damage to Lansdale’s reputation,” Boot writes.\n\nBoot was born in 1969. He has no personal memories of Vietnam, but he has been interested in the war for years. In his earlier writings he embraced the view that “the Vietnam War was winnable if we had fought differently,” as he put it in a 2011 essay. This idea may still have been in his mind when he chose the title of this book. The Road Not Taken implies that there was a road available that might have led to a better outcome in Vietnam. Boot almost says this in the prologue to this book.\n\nVietnam was “a catastrophe,” he writes, but “it might conceivably have been avoided if only Washington policymakers had listened to the advice of a renowned counterinsurgency strategist,” Lansdale:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to suggest that the whole conflict, the worst military defeat in American history, might have taken a very different course—one that was less costly and potentially more successful—if the counsel of this CIA operative and Air Force officer had been followed.\n\nThe word “might” is crucial here. If we are told that it is “no exaggeration” to say that something “might” have happened, what have we learned? Not much.\n\nTo his credit, near the end of this long book Boot acknowledges that, in fact, all the possible roads that the US might have traveled in Vietnam led to the same destination. His thorough research produced a formidable list of reasons why the American effort was doomed—not least the failure of the South Vietnamese to organize an effective, popular, and honest government. “In fairness,” he writes near the end, “South Vietnam might not have survived even if Lansdale had enjoyed more success” in selling his ideas about counterinsurgency.\n\nLansdale may have been overly idealistic in imagining that democracy could blossom in the tropical soil of South Vietnam even as a war raged…. North Vietnam would have been a tough and determined adversary under any circumstances, with more will to win than the United States had.\n\nBoot skims over what I consider the most important reason for the outcome in Vietnam—the fact that South Vietnam never was a real nation. Vietnamese in every region seemed to understand that they lived in one country. South Vietnam’s leaders during the twenty years it existed could never match the nationalist credentials of Ho and his comrades. The North Vietnamese were Communists, which made them unpopular with some Vietnamese—especially the Catholics, who included Diem—but they were the ones who had begun fighting a war for Vietnamese independence back in 1941. In 1954, Ho and his great general, Vo Nguyen Giap, heroically humiliated the French colonial army at Dien Bien Phu. They won their country’s independence.\n\nLansdale was mindful of this reality. On his second tour in Vietnam (1965–1968), which proved much more frustrating than productive, he tried to promote free and fair elections in the south, hoping they might legitimize the politicians who won them. But by then he knew the truth. In a 1967 memo to Henry Cabot Lodge, then the US ambassador in Saigon, Lansdale lamented the fact that “there is no potential candidate for the Presidency in South Viet Nam who has an image to compare favorably with Ho’s in the minds of the electorate.”\n\nLansdale was particularly critical of the idea of running a South Vietnamese general for president. Those generals, he wrote to Lodge, “are viewed for what they were before 1954 by most Vietnamese…corporals or sargeants in the French forces fighting against the Vietnamese nationalists.” Lodge’s candidate for president at the time was Nguyen Van Thieu, a general who, as a young man, did indeed fight with the French against Ho’s Vietminh. Thieu won a rigged election with just 35 percent of the vote, and went on to serve as president for eight years. In 1975, he presided over the collapse of South Vietnam.\n\nThis Issue\n\nJune 7, 2018\n\n-------------------------\n\nWhose Country?\n\nDonald E. Voth, reply by Robert G. Kaiser\n\nJune 28, 2018 issue\n\nSubmit a letter:\n\nEmail us letters@nybooks.com\n\nIn response to:\n\nThe Meddling American from the June 7, 2018 issue\n\nTo the Editors:\n\nRobert Kaiser, in his review of Max Boot’s The Road Not Taken: Edward Lansdale and the American Tragedy in Vietnam [NYR, June 7], states that “South Vietnam never was a real nation. Vietnamese in every region seemed to understand that they lived in one country.” Ken Burns’s popular documentary on the Vietnam War makes the same statement, even more bluntly. It is absolutely and obviously false. The separate southern Nguyen regime began in 1558 when the Nguyen Prince went south with his entourage and established himself in his capital at Hue. That separation was formalized in 1611 when the Nguyen dynasty stopped paying taxes to the northern Trinh “Lords” who pretended to represent the dysfunctional Le regime.\n\nFor nearly two hundred years the two regimes, the Trinh in the North and the Nguyen in the South, operated completely independently. In fact, they fought against each other the whole time. The southern regime flourished partly because of the vigorous international trade at its port at Hoi An, which became the major port of all of Southeast Asia. It completely overshadowed the northern regime.\n\nAnyone who pretends to believe this fantasy might read Li Tana’s Nguyễn Cochinchina: Southern Vietnam in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (Cornell University Southeast Asia Program, 1998), or, for that matter, pretty much any reputable history of Vietnam. As to what “Vietnamese in every region seemed to understand,” Kaiser may, of course, have his opinion. That is not my impression after sixty years of formal study of and contact with Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, including knowledge of the language.\n\nDonald E. Voth\n\nProfessor of Rural Sociology, Emeritus\n\nUniversity of Arkansas\n\nFayetteville, Arkansas\n\nRobert G. Kaiser replies:\n\nProfessor Voth reminds us of some of the complexity of Vietnamese history in the centuries before the French made Vietnam their colony in the mid-nineteenth century. But does the history he describes provide a cultural or historical basis for a twentieth-century political entity called the Republic of Vietnam, located on the Indochina Peninsula below the 17th parallel? I don’t think so. In a brutal century of colonialism, the French transformed Vietnam and stimulated a pan-Vietnamese nationalism that ultimately led to France’s defeat at the hands of the Vietminh, the movement of Ho Chi Minh and his comrades. A Vietnamese sense of nationhood made that victory possible, and the victory itself made Ho and his comrades heroes of Vietnamese wherever they lived. Edward Lansdale understood this, ironically—he realized Ho’s Communists had better credentials as nationalists than the South Vietnamese generals whom the US supported in the war, who were nearly all former members of the French army. My essay focused not on the history of Vietnam before 1800 that interests Professor Voth, but on the period that began in 1954, the period of American involvement.\n\nwww.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/south-vietnam-whose-c...\n\nGerman collectors card in the series E - Filmstars der Welt 2. Band by Greilings-sammelbilder, no. 162. Photo: Hamann / Meyerpress.\n\nPetite and glamorous Sonja Henie (1912-1969) was one of the greatest figure skaters in history, the ‘Pavlova of the ice’. She won more Olympic and World titles than any other ladies figure skater. At the height of her acting career, the Norwegian figure skater and film star was one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood. She had a shrewd business sense and was immensely successful next with a series of ice revues.\n\nSonja Henie was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway in 1912. She was the only daughter of Wilhelm Henie, a Norwegian fur wholesaler and his wife Selma Lochmann-Nielsen. In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time World Cycling Champion and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. As a girl, Henie was ranked Norway's third best tennis player, and she was also a skilled swimmer and equestrienne. She initially showed talent at skiing, and then followed her older brother Leif to take up figure skating. She received her first skates from her father on the Christmas after her sixth birthday. Once Henie began to train seriously as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity. She studied ballet with Tamara Karsavina a former teacher of Anna Pavlova, and eventually she combined skating and ballet on ice. She won the children's figure skating championship of Oslo when she was 8, and two years later, in 1923, she won the figure skating championship of Norway. She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the 1924 Winter Olympics, at the age of eleven. Henie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen. That year she also made her film debut with a small part in the romantic comedy Syv dager for Elisabeth/Seven Days for Elizabeth (1927, Leif Sinding). Henie went on to win first of her three Olympic gold medals the following year. She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her World titles annually until 1936. She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936. Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion. Henie was the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating, wear white boots, and make use of dance choreography. Henie also had great spinning ability. She incorporated 19 different spins into her programs, and she could spin nearly 80 revolutions. Her innovative skating techniques and glamorous demeanor transformed the sport permanently and confirmed its acceptance as a legitimate sport in the Winter Olympics. Towards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters. However, she held off the competition and went on to win her third Olympic title at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Henie travelled widely and was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and North America. She became so popular that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various cities.\n\nAfter the 1936 World Figure Skating Championships, Sonja Henie gave up her amateur status and took up a career as a professional performer in acting and live shows. As a girl, Henie had decided to try to become a movie star when her competitive days were over. In 1936, following a successful ice show in Los Angeles orchestrated by her father to launch her film career, Hollywood studio chief Darryl Zanuck signed her to a long term contract at Twentieth Century Fox. It made her one of the highest-paid actresses of the time. Her first film, One in a Million (1936, Sidney Lanfield) with Adolphe Menjou, was a box-office smash. She continued to make profitable light comedies throughout the late 1930’s and early 1940’s. Each film had several ice skating sequences. These films included Thin Ice (1937, Sidney Lanfield) with Tyrone Power, Second Fiddle (1939, Sidney Lanfield) again with Power, and Sun Valley Serenade (1941, H. Bruce Humberstone) with John Payne and the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Henie became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck, and insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films. In addition to her film career at Fox, Henie formed a business arrangement with Arthur Wirtz, who produced her touring ice shows under the name of ‘Hollywood Ice Revue’. Wirtz also acted as Henie's financial advisor. At the time, figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States. Henie's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment. Throughout the 1940’s, Henie and Wirtz produced ice skating musicals with lavish costumes and spectacular routines at Madison Square Garden, attracting millions of ticket buyers. At the height of her fame, her shows and touring activities brought Henie as much as $2 million per year. She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts, and deals to market skates, clothing, jewelry, dolls, and other merchandise branded with her name. These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time. In 1948 she made her last film, The Countess of Monte Cristo (1948, Frederick De Cordova). Henie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name ‘Sonja Henie Ice Revue’. It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz, whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion Barbara Ann Scott. Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates, Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as Ice Capades. The collapse of a section of bleachers during a show in Baltimore, Maryland in 1952 compounded the tour's legal and financial woes. In 1953 Henie formed a new partnership with Morris Chalfen to appear in his European Holiday On Ice tour. This was a great success. She produced her own show at New York's Roxy Theatre in January 1956. However, a subsequent South American tour in 1956 was a disaster. Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring, and this marked her retirement from skating.\n\nSonja Henie's connections with Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officials made her the subject of controversy. During her amateur skating career, she performed often in Germany and was a favourite of German audiences as well as of Hitler personally. As a wealthy celebrity, she moved in the same social circles as royalty and heads of state and made Hitler's acquaintance as a matter of course. Controversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a Nazi salute during an exhibition in Berlin some time prior to the 1936 Winter Olympics; she was strongly denounced by the Norwegian press. She did not repeat the salute at the Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby Berchtesgaden. Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription. After beginning her film career, Henie kept up her Nazi connections, for example personally arranging with Joseph Goebbels for the release of her first film, One in a Million, in Germany. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, German troops saw Hitler's autographed photo prominently displayed in the Henie family home. As a result, none of Henie's properties in Norway were confiscated or damaged by the Germans. Henie became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1941. Like many Hollywood stars, she supported the U.S. war effort through USO and similar activities, but she was careful to avoid supporting the Norwegian resistance movement, or making public statements against the Nazis. For this, she was condemned by many Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans. After the war, Henie was mindful that many of her countrymen considered her to be a quisling. However, she made a triumphant return to Norway with the Holiday on Ice tour in 1953 and 1955. Her autobiography Mitt livs eventyr/Wings on My Feet (1938-1940) was republished in a revised edition in 1954. Henie was married three times, to Dan Topping (1940 - 1946), Winthrop Gardiner Jr. (1949 - 1956) and the wealthy Norwegian shipping magnate and art patron, Niels Onstad (1956 - 1969). After her retirement in 1956, Henie and Onstad (nicknamed ‘the Onassis of Norway’) settled in Oslo and accumulated a large collection of modern art. In 1968 they opened the Henie Onstad kunstsenter (Henie-Onstad Art Centre) at Høvikodden, about 10 km from Oslo. At the time of her death, Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970. In the mid 1960’s, Henie was diagnosed with leukemia. She died of the disease in 1969 during a flight from Paris to Oslo. She was 57, and one of the ten wealthiest women in the world when she died. Sonja Henie is buried with her husband in Oslo on the hilltop overlooking the Henie-Onstad Art Centre. After her death her brother Leif published with Raymond Strait the biography ‘Queen of Ice, Queen of Shadows: The Unsuspected Life of Sonja Henie’ (1990). According to her brother, Henie was obsessed with money and sex, had a vile temper when crossed, and used her family and others shamelessly to advance her own ends. However, Henie is inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame (1976) and the International Women's Sport Hall of Fame (1982), and the signature of her ice skate blades adorns the cement at Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\n\nSources: Jone Johnson Lewis (Women’s History Guide), The New York Times, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Wikipedia, and IMDb.\n\nGill and I went to Avebury for the solstice and to celebrate our marriage.\n\n1000 visitors have come and gone\n\nSomething to reflect upon\n\nGill has died\n\nBut hope lives on\n\nThere will be a public memorial at Avebury on November 1 2009\n\nRanked # 1 of about 19,200 for poems about finding hope after a shattered heart.\n\nRanked #1 of about 272,000 for hope in the midst of darkness poem.\n\nRanked #7 10 of about 191,000 for pagans against gaza attack\n\nComes up sixth on Google.com of about 25,500,000 for \"hope in darkness\".\n\n#364 on explore\n\nRight now I find it hard to get beyond the irony of this. At least this is not the holy land where the neighbours come at you with bombs guns and white phosphorus, in retaliation for your fireworks landing in their garden. Oh sorry, sorry ,sorry, if this seems prejudiced. It is just that your Israeli neurotic fear of being killed, almost unreal, contrasts hugely with the real terror imposed on the Palestinians. Hammas was democratically elected. Terrorists are not. Can't you tell the difference.\n\nOK, so there are Iranians in power who want another holocaust.

Even I have not been aware of how well, what adjective to use, ....they are.\n\nI trust John Pilger, one of the only truly honest journalists on the planet\n\nRead him:8 Jan 2009\n\nWriting in the New Statesman, John Pilger calls on 40 years of reporting the Middle East to describe the 'why' of Israel's bloody onslaught on the besieged people of Gaza - an attack that has little to do with Hamas or Israel's right to exist.\n\n“When the truth is replaced by silence,” the Soviet dissident Yevgeny Yevtushenko said, “the silence is a lie.” It may appear the silence is broken on Gaza. The cocoons of murdered children, wrapped in green, together with boxes containing their dismembered parents and the cries of grief and rage of everyone in that death camp by the sea, can be viewed on al-Jazeera and YouTube, even glimpsed on the BBC. But Russia’s incorrigible poet was not referring to the ephemeral we call news; he was asking why those who knew the why never spoke it and so denied it. Among the Anglo-American intelligentsia, this is especially striking. It is they who hold the keys to the great storehouses of knowledge: the historiographies and archives that lead us to the why.\n\nThey know that the horror now raining on Gaza has little to do with Hamas or, absurdly, “Israel’s right to exist”. They know the opposite to be true: that Palestine’s right to exist was cancelled 61 years ago and the expulsion and, if necessary, extinction of the indigenous people was planned and executed by the founders of Israel. They know, for example, that the infamous “Plan D” resulted in the murderous de-population of 369 Palestinian towns and villages by the Haganah (Jewish army) and that massacre upon massacre of Palestinian civilians in such places as Deir Yassin, al-Dawayima, Eilaboun, Jish, Ramle and Lydda are referred to in official records as “ethnic cleansing”. Arriving at a scene of this carnage, David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, was asked by a general, Yigal Allon, “What shall we do with the Arabs?” Ben-Gurion, reported the Israeli historian Benny Morris, “made a dismissive, energetic gesture with his hand and said, ‘Expel them’. The order to expel an entire population “without attention to age” was signed by Yitzhak Rabin, a future prime minister promoted by the world’s most efficient propaganda as a peacemaker. The terrible irony of this was addressed only in passing, such as when the Mapan Party co-leader Meir Ya’ari noted “how easily” Israel’s leaders spoke of how it was “possible and permissible to take women, children and old men and to fill the roads with them because such is the imperative of strategy … who remembers who used this means against our people during the [Second World] war... we are appalled.”\n\nEvery subsequent “war” Israel has waged has had the same objective: the expulsion of the native people and the theft of more and more land. The lie of David and Goliath, of perennial victim, reached its apogee in 1967 when the propaganda became a righteous fury that claimed the Arab states had struck first. Since then, mostly Jewish truth-tellers such as Avi Schlaim, Noam Chomsky, the late Tanya Reinhart, Neve Gordon, Tom Segev, Yuri Avnery, Ilan Pappe and Norman Finklestein have dispatched this and other myths and revealed a state shorn of the humane traditions of Judaism, whose unrelenting militarism is the sum of an expansionist, lawless and racist ideology called zionism. “It seems,” wrote the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe on 2 January, “that even the most horrendous crimes, such as the genocide in Gaza, are treated as desperate events, unconnected to anything that happened in the past and not associated with any ideology or system... Very much as the apartheid ideology explained the oppressive policies of the South African government , this ideology – in its most consensual and simplistic variety – has allowed all the Israeli governments in the past and the present to dehumanise the Palestinians wherever they are and strive to destroy them. The means altered from period to period, from location to location, as did the narrative covering up these atrocities. But there is a clear pattern [of genocide].”\n\nIn Gaza, the enforced starvation and denial of humanitarian aid, the piracy of life-giving resources such as fuel and water, the denial of medicines and treatment, the systematic destruction of infrastructure and the killing and maiming of the civilian population, 50 per cent of whom are children, meet the international standard of the Genocide Convention. “Is it an irresponsible overstatement,” asked Richard Falk, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and international law authority at Princeton University, “to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity? I think not.”\n\nIn describing a “holocaust-in-the making”, Falk was alluding to the Nazis’ establishment of Jewish ghettos in Poland. For one month in 1943, the captive Polish Jews led by Mordechaj Anielewiz fought off the German army and the SS, but their resistance was finally crushed and the Nazis exacted their final revenge. Falk is also a Jew. Today’s holocaust-in-the-making, which began with Ben-Gurion’s Plan D, is in its final stages. The difference today is that it is a joint US-Israeli project. The F-16 jet fighters, the 250-pound “smart” GBU-39 bombs supplied on the eve of the attack on Gaza, having been approved by a Congress dominated by the Democratic Party, plus the annual $2.4 billion in war-making “aid”, give Washington de facto control. It beggars belief that President-elect Obama was not informed. Outspoken on Russia’s war in Georgia and the terrorism in Mumbai, Obama’s silence on Palestine marks his approval, which is to be expected, given his obsequiousness to the Tel Aviv regime and its lobbyists during the presidential campaign and his appointment of Zionists as his secretary of state, chief of staff and principal Middle East advisers. When Aretha Franklin sings “Think”, her wonderful 1960s anthem to freedom, at Obama’s inauguration on 21 January, I trust someone with the brave heart of Muntadar al-Zaidi, the shoe-thrower, will shout: “Gaza!”\n\nThe asymmetry of conquest and terror is clear. Plan D is now “Operation Cast Lead”, which is the unfinished “Operation Justified Vengeance”. The latter was launched by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001 when, with Bush’s approval, he used F-16s against Palestinian towns and villages for the first time. In the same year, the authoritative Jane’s Foreign Report disclosed that the Blair government had given Israel the “green light” to attack the West Bank after it was shown Israel’s secret designs for a bloodbath. It was typical of New Labour Party’s enduring, cringing complicity in Palestine’s agony. However, the 2001 Israeli plan, reported Jane’s, needed the “trigger” of a suicide bombing which would cause “numerous deaths and injuries [because] the ‘revenge’ factor is crucial”. This would “motivate Israeli soldiers to demolish the Palestinians”. What alarmed Sharon and the author of the plan, General Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Chief of Staff, was a secret agreement between Yasser Arafat and Hamas to ban suicide attacks. On 23 November, 2001, Israeli agents assassinated the Hamas leader, Mahmud Abu Hunud, and got their “trigger”; the suicide attacks resumed in response to his killing.\n\nSomething uncannily similar happened on 5 November last, when Israeli special forces attacked Gaza, killing six people. Once again, they got their propaganda “trigger”. A ceasefire initiated and sustained by the Hamas government – which had imprisoned its violators - was shattered by the Israeli attack and home-made rockets were fired into what used to be Palestine before its Arab occupants were “cleansed”. The On 23 December, Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire, but Israel’s charade was such that its all-out assault on Gaza had been planned six months earlier, according to the Israeli daily Ha’aretz.\n\nBehind this sordid game is the “Dagan Plan”, named after General Meir Dagan, who served with Sharon in his bloody invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Now head of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence organisation, Dagan is the author of a “solution” that has seen the imprisonment of Palestinians behind a ghetto wall snaking across the West Bank and in Gaza, effectively a concentration camp. The establishment of a quisling government in Ramallah under Mohammed Abbas is Dagan’s achievement, together with a hasbara (propaganda) campaign relayed through a mostly supine, if intimidated western media, notably in America, that says Hamas is a terrorist organisation devoted to Israel’s destruction and to “blame” for the massacres and siege of its own people over two generations, long before its creation. “We have never had it so good,” said the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Gideon Meir in 2006. “The hasbara effort is a well-oiled machine.” In fact, Hamas’s real threat is its example as the Arab world’s only democratically elected government, drawing its popularity from its resistance to the Palestinians’ oppressor and tormentor. This was demonstrated when Hamas foiled a CIA coup in 2007, an event ordained in the western media as “Hamas’s seizure of power”. Likewise, Hamas is never described as a government, let alone democratic. Neither is its proposal of a ten-year truce as a historic recognition of the “reality” of Israel and support for a two-state solution with just one condition: that the Israelis obey international law and end their illegal occupation beyond the 1967 borders. As every annual vote in the UN General Assembly demonstrates, 99 per cent of humanity concurs. On 4 January, the president of the General Assembly, Miguel d’Escoto, described the Israeli attack on Gaza as a “monstrosity”.\n\nWhen the monstrosity is done and the people of Gaza are even more stricken, the Dagan Plan foresees what Sharon called a “1948-style solution” – the destruction of all Palestinian leadership and authority followed by mass expulsions into smaller and smaller “cantonments” and perhaps finally into Jordan. This demolition of institutional and educational life in Gaza is designed to produce, wrote Karma Nabulsi, a Palestinian exile in Britain, “a Hobbesian vision of an anarchic society: truncated, violent, powerless, destroyed, cowed... Look to the Iraq of today: that is what [Sharon] had in store for us, and he has nearly achieved it.”\n\nDr. Dahlia Wasfi is an American writer on Palestine. She has a Jewish mother and an Iraqi Muslim father. “Holocaust denial is anti-Semitic,” she wrote on 31 December. “But I’m not talking about World War Two, Mahmoud Ahmedinijad (the president of Iran) or Ashkenazi Jews. What I’m referring to is the holocaust we are all witnessing and responsible for in Gaza today and in Palestine over the past 60 years... Since Arabs are Semites, US-Israeli policy doesn’t get more anti-Semitic than this.” She quoted Rachel Corrie, the young American who went to Palestine to defend Palestinians and was crushed by an Israeli bulldozer. “I am in the midst of a genocide,” wrote Corrie, “which I am also indirectly supporting and for which my government is largely responsible.”\n\nReading the words of both, I am struck by the use of “responsibility”. Breaking the lie of silence is not an esoteric abstraction but an urgent responsibility that falls to those with the privilege of a platform. With the BBC cowed, so too is much of journalism, merely allowing vigorous debate within unmovable invisible boundaries, ever fearful of the smear of anti-Semitism. The unreported news, meanwhile, is that the death toll in Gaza is the equivalent of 18,000 dead in Britain. Imagine, if you can.\n\nThen there are the academics, the deans and teachers and researchers. Why are they silent as they watch a university bombed and hear the Association of University Teachers in Gaza plea for help? Are British universities now, as Terry Eagleton believes, no more than “intellectual Tescos, churning out a commodity known as graduates rather than greengroceries”?\n\nThen there are the writers. In the dark year of 1939, the Third Writers’ Congress was held at Carnegie Hall in New York and the likes of Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein sent messages and spoke up to ensure the lie of silence was broken. By one account, 3,500 jammed the auditorium and a thousand were turned away. Today, this mighty voice of realism and morality is said to be obsolete; the literary review pages affect an ironic hauteur of irrelevance; false symbolism is all. As for the readers, their moral and political imagination is to be pacified, not primed. The anti-Muslim Martin Amis expressed this well in Visiting Mrs Nabokov: “The dominance of the self is not a flaw, it is an evolutionary characteristic; it is just how things are.”\n\nIf that is how things are, we are diminished as a civilised society. For what happens in Gaza is the defining moment of our time, which either grants the impunity of war criminals the immunity of our silence, while we contort our own intellect and morality, or gives us the power to speak out. For the moment I prefer my own memory of Gaza: of the people’s courage and resistance and their “luminous humanity”, as Karma Nabulsi put it. On my last trip there, I was rewarded with a spectacle of Palestinian flags fluttering in unlikely places. It was dusk and children had done this. No one told them to do it. They made flagpoles out of sticks tied together, and a few of them climbed on to a wall and held the flag between them, some silently, others crying out. They do this every day when they know foreigners are leaving, believing the world will not forget them.\n\nOn the BBC this morning I heard the man from the UN itself denounce the terrible complicity of the west in the Israeli barbarism.\n\nThe BBC really excelled itself today with the worst excuse imaginable for denying air time to an appeal for the victims of Gaza.\n\nThe Government is clear that there is access. Point 1 rejected\n\nPoint 2, that it would show a political bias is a challenge to the integrity of international humanitarian aid.\n\nThe destruction of so many UN centres in surgical strikes by Israeli bombers is a fact of war criminal intensity,\n\nHope\n\nWhy Hope\n\nI despair of any justice or integrity\n\nDear friends,\n\nObama is challenging Israel's right-wing government to stop its settlements, which are killing prospects for peace -- let's raise a massive global chorus to help him overcome powerful opposition in Israel and the US:\n\nWest Bank settlement maps show how Palestinians are only allowed to live in small parts of their land:\n\nPresident Obama just made a remarkable speech in Egypt, committing personally to building peace in the Middle East. Unexpectedly, his first move is to directly challenge the new right-wing government of America's ally Israel -- pressing them to stop their self-destructive policy of settlements (illegal colonies set up on territory recognised by the US and the world as Palestinian).\n\nThis is a moment of rare crisis and opportunity. Obama’s bold strategy is facing powerful opposition, so he’s going to need help around the world in the coming days and weeks to strengthen his resolve. Let’s start right now -- by raising a massive global chorus behind Obama’s statement that the settlements in occupied territory must stop.\n\nWe’ll advertise the number of signatures in key newspapers in Israel, as well as in Washington DC (where some are trying to undermine Obama in the US Congress). Read Obama’s words now and add your signature to them at the link below, then forward this email to friends and family so they can do the same:\n\nwww.avaaz.org/en/obama_stop_settlements\n\nThere is broad agreement that the settlements are a significant barrier to peace, a view also shared by a silent majority of the Israeli public. Combined with a network of roadblocks and barriers, these colonies now blanket the West Bank, seizing territory and forcing Palestinians to live effectively as prisoners in smaller and smaller pockets (see map at right).\n\nUntil this problem is tackled, it seems impossible to build a viable Palestinian state or any kind of lasting peace. For Arab states deciding what more they themselves can do for peace, stopping the settlements has become a crucial test of Israel’s seriousness.\n\nWe’ll need to urge the other parties to take bold steps too. If we can help Obama to stay the course on settlements, shift Israeli policy and encourage the Palestinians and key Arab states also to stretch out their hands, a new beginning for the Middle East is possible.\n\nBut none of this will happen without a growing global movement of citizens taking action to support it.

(100 x 130.5 cm.)\n\nPainted in 1905\n\nEdvard Munch (1863-1944) was a turn-of-the-century Norwegian artist, best known for his extremely personal brand of Symbolism, which helped lay the foundations for and proved a lasting influence on the later Expressionist school of art.\n\nEdvard Munch was born on December 12, 1863, in the small town of Loten, Norway, as the second of five children. His father was Christian Munch, a military doctor, and his mother Laura Cathrine Munch, née Bjolstad. Edvard had three sisters, Sophie, Laura and Inger, and one brother, Andreas. Although ostensibly middle class, the family had but modest means and often struggled financially.\n\nIn 1864, soon after Edvard's birth, the family moved to Kristiania, the capital of Norway (the city would be renamed to \"Christiania\" in 1878 and again to \"Oslo,\" its present name, in 1924). In 1868, Edvard's mother died of consumption (tuberculosis) and her sister, Karen Bjolstad, took care for the children and the household upon herself. In 1877, Edvard's elder sister Sophie also succumbed to tuberculosis. These two deaths greatly affected the future painter and echoes of the pain and despair he felt at the time would appear frequently in his work.\n\nAlthough Munch was interested in painting since he was a boy, his family was not in love with the idea and urged him to acquire a more prestigious and profitable profession. In 1879, at the age of 16, he entered the Oslo Technical College with the idea of becoming an engineer. He pursued this field of study for little more than a year before deciding that his true calling was art and dropping out of the college. Soon thereafter, he enrolled for evening classes at the Royal Drawing School in Oslo. By 1881, he was studying there full-time.\n\nEdvard Munch was a quick and able student. At the Royal Drawing School, he was considered one of the most gifted young artists of his day. In addition to his normal classes, Munch also began taking private lessons with Christian Krohg, an established artist and good friend. He also attended the open-air summer school of Frits Thaulow at Modum.\n\nIn 1883, Munch exhibited at the Oslo Autumn Exhibition for the first time. Over the next few years, he would become a regular participant.\n\nMunch was exposed to a wide range of artistic influence during his formative period, which lasted from about 1880 to 1889. The painter often visited Kristiania's (Oslo's) rather modest National Gallery, and had an avid interest in contemporary art magazines. Like most of Northern, Eastern and Central Europe, Norway was considered culturally to be a provincial backwater and, like many of his colleagues and contemporaries, Munch traveled extensively to learn from both the rich painting traditions and the latest artistic developments of Europe's enlightened West and South.\n\nIn 1885, the painter attended the World Exhibition at Antwerp and paid a brief visit to Paris, then considered the Mecca of contemporary art. Munch was certainly familiar with the work of the Impressionists, whose large exhibition in Paris he visited that year and again in 1888, when there was another such exhibition in Copenhagen. Certainly, a variety of influences can be seen in Munch's work of the time, such as Maridalen by Oslo (1881), Self-Portrait (1881), Aunt Karen in the Rocking Chair (1883) and At the Coffee Table (1883). Conservative tastes reigned in Oslo at the time, and much of the painter’s work was poorly received by critics.\n\nAt home in Norway, the artist was part of a group of radical young intellectuals, which included both painters and writers and espoused a variety of political views, from anarchism to socialism to Marxism. Their ideas certainly influenced Munch's own. However, the painter's artistic focus would always remain on himself and his own subjective experiences, almost notoriously so. Thus, he often re-visited the tragic episode of his beloved sister's sickness and death in such works as The Sick Child (1885-86) and Spring (1889).\n\nThis latter painting delighted the critics and paved the way, in 1889, for Munch's first solo exhibition at Kristiania. That same year, he received a scholarship from the Norwegian government to study abroad. The artist traveled to Paris, where he enrolled at the art school of Leon Bonnat. He also attended the major exhibitions, where he became familiar with the works of the Post-Impressionists. His own canvases of the time show considerable Impressionist influence: witness Rue Lafayette (1890) or Moonlight over Oslo Fjord (1891), painted during a brief return to Norway. On the other hand, Night in St. Cloud, a dramatic and highly emotional work, has all the characteristic traits of Naturalism.\n\nIn 1892, Munch visited Berlin, where he had been invited to exhibit by the Berlin Artists' Association. The painter's work was received very poorly, and the exhibition was closed down after only a few days, as the critics howled in outrage. Undeterred, the painter toured through Cologne and Dusseldorf, before returning once again to Berlin. As so often happens, the initial scandal attracted a great deal of attention to the artist, and he quickly found supporters and patrons. Munch stayed in Berlin for over a year. Many of his paintings found customers and he was at last able to make a comfortable living.\n\nIn the following years, he traveled throughout Europe, exhibiting in Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen and Stockholm. In 1896, he exhibited at the Parisian Salon des Independents for the first time.\n\nIn 1888, Munch had discovered Asgardstrand, a seaside resort located about 50 miles away from Oslo, and rented a cottage there the following year. He would spend many summers there. In 1897, he finally purchased the house and established it as his home base, though he continued to travel extensively.\n\nMunch's work of the period is concerned with human life, love and death. The paintings are more and more concerned with melancholy and the darker emotions. Some of the most notable products of this time include: Moonlight (1893), Puberty (1894), The Day After (1894-95), The Kiss (1897) and Man and Woman (1898). Contrast the picture Evening on Karl Johan Street (1892) with his earlier, brighter Spring Day on Karl Johan (1890). The famous Scream (1893) -- Munch produced several versions -- also belongs to this period. The painter gathered these works into an ensemble he titled The Frieze of Life, which he exhibited in a series of European cities. Like so much of Munch's previous work, this series of works had mixed reception among the critics and the public.\n\nIn 1903, the artist was commissioned by physician Dr. Max Linde to paint a number of decorative pieces for the children's room in the doctor's house. Munch produced eleven large canvases, depicting landscapes. Although Dr. Linde paid the artist in full, he was not completely satisfied with the results. The paintings, known as the Linde Frieze, stayed up for only eleven months before being taken down, stored and finally returned to the painter, from where they would find their way, separately, to a variety of museums and collections. Although the subjects of the paintings were quite tame, showing the beautiful Asgardstrand landscape, the doctor felt they were \"unsuitable for children,\" perhaps because of the melancholy, brooding air that Munch seemed to unconsciously imbue his work with.\n\nIn 1906, Munch was commissioned by Max Reinhardt, the famous German theater director, to paint a decorative frieze for the Deutsches Theater. The painter had previously designed the stage set for Reinhardt's production of Ghosts, by Henryk Ibsen. The frieze was intended to decorate one of the rooms at the theater. For it, Munch chose to use the same theme as he had for the Linde frieze, but, unconstrained now, he peopled the landscape of Asgardstrand with vacationers and lovers. Works from the Reinhardt Frieze include: Asgardstrand, Two Girls, Couple on the Shore and, of particular note, The Lonely Ones. In total, the artist painted 12 canvases for this project.\n\nWhile not rejected outright, the work was again received poorly although it is, arguably, some of Munch's best. After only a few years, the room was re-decorated and the paintings taken down. The artist himself complained about the project, claiming that it had been a large amount of work for meager pay.\n\nIn fact, Munch was in dire financial straits at this time, which were not helped by his nerves, frail health and heavy drinking. In 1908, he suffered a breakdown, as a consequence of which he retired to his cottage at Asgardstrand, there to live in relative isolation and solitude for the next several years.\n\nIn 1909, Munch entered a competition to design murals for the Festival Hall at the Oslo University. His designs were chosen out of a number of competitors, not without controversy, after the University of Jena, Germany, offered to purchase the painter's projects for themselves. The University of Oslo would not allow that and, in 1911, Munch was reluctantly given the job. The canvases, nine of them, 15 feet high each, with the largest spanning 38 feet in width, were finally unveiled in 1916 and easily rank among some of the artist's best work. The most notable painting in this group is probably The Sun, together with Alma Mater and History.\n\nAround this time, Munch purchased the estate of Ekely in a quiet suburb of Oslo, which he would make his permanent home in the coming years.\n\nAfter 1920, Munch grew increasingly withdrawn from public life, limiting social contacts and carefully guarding his privacy. He lived alone, without a servant or housekeeper, with only several dogs for company, and devoted his days to painting. It was during this period, ironically, that he at last began to gain the recognition that had been denied him previously by both critics and public.\n\nAs early as 1912, Munch's work had been exhibited alongside the works of such acclaimed Post-Impressionist painters as Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh. The artist inspired great interest in Germany, which saw him as a vital link between the art world of Paris and the art world of Northern Europe.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1928, large exhibitions of his work were held in Berlin, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt, Dresden, Mannheim and Munich, as well as Copenhagen and Zurich. Works of this period include: Model by the Wicker Chair (1919-21), The Wave (1921), Model on the Couch (1924-28), The Wedding of the Bohemian (1925) and Red House and Spruces (1927).\n\nIn 1930, a blood vessel in the painter's eye burst, seriously impairing his vision. As a result, Munch was forced to paint much less than before. In 1933, major exhibitions were held in honor of the painter's 70th birthday.\n\nIn 1936, the painter's eye problems grew worse, and he was forced to abandon work on decorative friezes and murals. That year, Munch had his first exhibition in England, which had thus far not shared the enthusiasm with which the painter was greeted in Central and Northern Europe. Ironically, the attitude towards the painter in Germany, where the painter had first gained widespread recognition had changed for the worse. With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, artistic innovations began to be regarded negatively. In 1937, eighty-two of Munch's paintings were declared \"degenerate\" and removed from museums. Many of these works found their way to the private collections of prominent Nazis, indicating that their personal views on Munch's art were rather different from the official party line.\n\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Norway. The artist refused to be associated in any way with the Nazis and the Quisling puppet-government they set up in Norway, isolating himself in his country home. His dramatic self-portrait By the Window (1940) dates to this period. In the painting, a balding and aging Munch stares defiantly upwards at something beyond the canvas. In the window behind him, a tangled winter landscape contrasts sharply with the warm, ruddy colors of the interior and the painter's face.\n\nFollowing the USA's entry into the Second World War in 1942, the painter's anti-Nazi stance gained him recognition there as well. That year saw his first -- and only -- exhibition in the Americas, less than one and a half years before the artist's death.\n\nEdvard Munch died on January 23, 1944, at his estate in Ekely. He bequeathed all of his property, which included over 1,000 paintings and close to 20,000 sketches, woodcuts and lithographs, to the city of Oslo. The Munch Museum was subsequently opened there to mark the painter's centenary, in 1963.\n\nBiography by Yuri Mataev.\n\nOil on canvas.\n\nEdvard Munch (1863-1944) was a turn-of-the-century Norwegian artist, best known for his extremely personal brand of Symbolism, which helped lay the foundations for and proved a lasting influence on the later Expressionist school of art.\n\nEdvard Munch was born on December 12, 1863, in the small town of Loten, Norway, as the second of five children. His father was Christian Munch, a military doctor, and his mother Laura Cathrine Munch, née Bjolstad. Edvard had three sisters, Sophie, Laura and Inger, and one brother, Andreas. Although ostensibly middle class, the family had but modest means and often struggled financially.\n\nIn 1864, soon after Edvard's birth, the family moved to Kristiania, the capital of Norway (the city would be renamed to \"Christiania\" in 1878 and again to \"Oslo,\" its present name, in 1924). In 1868, Edvard's mother died of consumption (tuberculosis) and her sister, Karen Bjolstad, took care for the children and the household upon herself. In 1877, Edvard's elder sister Sophie also succumbed to tuberculosis. These two deaths greatly affected the future painter and echoes of the pain and despair he felt at the time would appear frequently in his work.\n\nAlthough Munch was interested in painting since he was a boy, his family was not in love with the idea and urged him to acquire a more prestigious and profitable profession. In 1879, at the age of 16, he entered the Oslo Technical College with the idea of becoming an engineer. He pursued this field of study for little more than a year before deciding that his true calling was art and dropping out of the college. Soon thereafter, he enrolled for evening classes at the Royal Drawing School in Oslo. By 1881, he was studying there full-time.\n\nEdvard Munch was a quick and able student. At the Royal Drawing School, he was considered one of the most gifted young artists of his day. In addition to his normal classes, Munch also began taking private lessons with Christian Krohg, an established artist and good friend. He also attended the open-air summer school of Frits Thaulow at Modum.\n\nIn 1883, Munch exhibited at the Oslo Autumn Exhibition for the first time. Over the next few years, he would become a regular participant.\n\nMunch was exposed to a wide range of artistic influence during his formative period, which lasted from about 1880 to 1889. The painter often visited Kristiania's (Oslo's) rather modest National Gallery, and had an avid interest in contemporary art magazines. Like most of Northern, Eastern and Central Europe, Norway was considered culturally to be a provincial backwater and, like many of his colleagues and contemporaries, Munch traveled extensively to learn from both the rich painting traditions and the latest artistic developments of Europe's enlightened West and South.\n\nIn 1885, the painter attended the World Exhibition at Antwerp and paid a brief visit to Paris, then considered the Mecca of contemporary art. Munch was certainly familiar with the work of the Impressionists, whose large exhibition in Paris he visited that year and again in 1888, when there was another such exhibition in Copenhagen. Certainly, a variety of influences can be seen in Munch's work of the time, such as Maridalen by Oslo (1881), Self-Portrait (1881), Aunt Karen in the Rocking Chair (1883) and At the Coffee Table (1883). Conservative tastes reigned in Oslo at the time, and much of the painter’s work was poorly received by critics.\n\nAt home in Norway, the artist was part of a group of radical young intellectuals, which included both painters and writers and espoused a variety of political views, from anarchism to socialism to Marxism. Their ideas certainly influenced Munch's own. However, the painter's artistic focus would always remain on himself and his own subjective experiences, almost notoriously so. Thus, he often re-visited the tragic episode of his beloved sister's sickness and death in such works as The Sick Child (1885-86) and Spring (1889).\n\nThis latter painting delighted the critics and paved the way, in 1889, for Munch's first solo exhibition at Kristiania. That same year, he received a scholarship from the Norwegian government to study abroad. The artist traveled to Paris, where he enrolled at the art school of Leon Bonnat. He also attended the major exhibitions, where he became familiar with the works of the Post-Impressionists. His own canvases of the time show considerable Impressionist influence: witness Rue Lafayette (1890) or Moonlight over Oslo Fjord (1891), painted during a brief return to Norway. On the other hand, Night in St. Cloud, a dramatic and highly emotional work, has all the characteristic traits of Naturalism.\n\nIn 1892, Munch visited Berlin, where he had been invited to exhibit by the Berlin Artists' Association. The painter's work was received very poorly, and the exhibition was closed down after only a few days, as the critics howled in outrage. Undeterred, the painter toured through Cologne and Dusseldorf, before returning once again to Berlin. As so often happens, the initial scandal attracted a great deal of attention to the artist, and he quickly found supporters and patrons. Munch stayed in Berlin for over a year. Many of his paintings found customers and he was at last able to make a comfortable living.\n\nIn the following years, he traveled throughout Europe, exhibiting in Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen and Stockholm. In 1896, he exhibited at the Parisian Salon des Independents for the first time.\n\nIn 1888, Munch had discovered Asgardstrand, a seaside resort located about 50 miles away from Oslo, and rented a cottage there the following year. He would spend many summers there. In 1897, he finally purchased the house and established it as his home base, though he continued to travel extensively.\n\nMunch's work of the period is concerned with human life, love and death. The paintings are more and more concerned with melancholy and the darker emotions. Some of the most notable products of this time include: Moonlight (1893), Puberty (1894), The Day After (1894-95), The Kiss (1897) and Man and Woman (1898). Contrast the picture Evening on Karl Johan Street (1892) with his earlier, brighter Spring Day on Karl Johan (1890). The famous Scream (1893) -- Munch produced several versions -- also belongs to this period. The painter gathered these works into an ensemble he titled The Frieze of Life, which he exhibited in a series of European cities. Like so much of Munch's previous work, this series of works had mixed reception among the critics and the public.\n\nIn 1903, the artist was commissioned by physician Dr. Max Linde to paint a number of decorative pieces for the children's room in the doctor's house. Munch produced eleven large canvases, depicting landscapes. Although Dr. Linde paid the artist in full, he was not completely satisfied with the results. The paintings, known as the Linde Frieze, stayed up for only eleven months before being taken down, stored and finally returned to the painter, from where they would find their way, separately, to a variety of museums and collections. Although the subjects of the paintings were quite tame, showing the beautiful Asgardstrand landscape, the doctor felt they were \"unsuitable for children,\" perhaps because of the melancholy, brooding air that Munch seemed to unconsciously imbue his work with.\n\nIn 1906, Munch was commissioned by Max Reinhardt, the famous German theater director, to paint a decorative frieze for the Deutsches Theater. The painter had previously designed the stage set for Reinhardt's production of Ghosts, by Henryk Ibsen. The frieze was intended to decorate one of the rooms at the theater. For it, Munch chose to use the same theme as he had for the Linde frieze, but, unconstrained now, he peopled the landscape of Asgardstrand with vacationers and lovers. Works from the Reinhardt Frieze include: Asgardstrand, Two Girls, Couple on the Shore and, of particular note, The Lonely Ones. In total, the artist painted 12 canvases for this project.\n\nWhile not rejected outright, the work was again received poorly although it is, arguably, some of Munch's best. After only a few years, the room was re-decorated and the paintings taken down. The artist himself complained about the project, claiming that it had been a large amount of work for meager pay.\n\nIn fact, Munch was in dire financial straits at this time, which were not helped by his nerves, frail health and heavy drinking. In 1908, he suffered a breakdown, as a consequence of which he retired to his cottage at Asgardstrand, there to live in relative isolation and solitude for the next several years.\n\nIn 1909, Munch entered a competition to design murals for the Festival Hall at the Oslo University. His designs were chosen out of a number of competitors, not without controversy, after the University of Jena, Germany, offered to purchase the painter's projects for themselves. The University of Oslo would not allow that and, in 1911, Munch was reluctantly given the job. The canvases, nine of them, 15 feet high each, with the largest spanning 38 feet in width, were finally unveiled in 1916 and easily rank among some of the artist's best work. The most notable painting in this group is probably The Sun, together with Alma Mater and History.\n\nAround this time, Munch purchased the estate of Ekely in a quiet suburb of Oslo, which he would make his permanent home in the coming years.\n\nAfter 1920, Munch grew increasingly withdrawn from public life, limiting social contacts and carefully guarding his privacy. He lived alone, without a servant or housekeeper, with only several dogs for company, and devoted his days to painting. It was during this period, ironically, that he at last began to gain the recognition that had been denied him previously by both critics and public.\n\nAs early as 1912, Munch's work had been exhibited alongside the works of such acclaimed Post-Impressionist painters as Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh. The artist inspired great interest in Germany, which saw him as a vital link between the art world of Paris and the art world of Northern Europe.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1928, large exhibitions of his work were held in Berlin, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt, Dresden, Mannheim and Munich, as well as Copenhagen and Zurich. Works of this period include: Model by the Wicker Chair (1919-21), The Wave (1921), Model on the Couch (1924-28), The Wedding of the Bohemian (1925) and Red House and Spruces (1927).\n\nIn 1930, a blood vessel in the painter's eye burst, seriously impairing his vision. As a result, Munch was forced to paint much less than before. In 1933, major exhibitions were held in honor of the painter's 70th birthday.\n\nIn 1936, the painter's eye problems grew worse, and he was forced to abandon work on decorative friezes and murals. That year, Munch had his first exhibition in England, which had thus far not shared the enthusiasm with which the painter was greeted in Central and Northern Europe. Ironically, the attitude towards the painter in Germany, where the painter had first gained widespread recognition had changed for the worse. With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, artistic innovations began to be regarded negatively. In 1937, eighty-two of Munch's paintings were declared \"degenerate\" and removed from museums. Many of these works found their way to the private collections of prominent Nazis, indicating that their personal views on Munch's art were rather different from the official party line.\n\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Norway. The artist refused to be associated in any way with the Nazis and the Quisling puppet-government they set up in Norway, isolating himself in his country home. His dramatic self-portrait By the Window (1940) dates to this period. In the painting, a balding and aging Munch stares defiantly upwards at something beyond the canvas. In the window behind him, a tangled winter landscape contrasts sharply with the warm, ruddy colors of the interior and the painter's face.\n\nFollowing the USA's entry into the Second World War in 1942, the painter's anti-Nazi stance gained him recognition there as well. That year saw his first -- and only -- exhibition in the Americas, less than one and a half years before the artist's death.\n\nEdvard Munch died on January 23, 1944, at his estate in Ekely. He bequeathed all of his property, which included over 1,000 paintings and close to 20,000 sketches, woodcuts and lithographs, to the city of Oslo. The Munch Museum was subsequently opened there to mark the painter's centenary, in 1963.\n\nBiography by Yuri Mataev."
