        "text": "Post by tomiseksj on\n\nLet me begin by saying that this is not an original idea -- I contributed to a similar thread on another forum and found it quite interesting.\n\nThis thread will involve members posting their covers, and/or stamps that have postmarks matching the month and day of their posting.\n\nFor example, as I am creating this post it is August 10th in the U.S. so my contribution to the calendar thread is the following first day cover with a pair of the 5c Overrun Countries issue: Luxembourg (Scott 912) postmarked in Washington, DC on August 10, 1943.\n\nThe goal is to have at least one postmark added to the thread each day -- an admirable goal that may prove as illusive as those low value, hard to find issues currently being discussed in another forum boad.\n\nPost by I.L.S. on\n\nYou know I was always fascinated by that thread also but the organization of my collection hasn't come as far as documenting the dates in chronological order as of yet but the thought is compelling however! So if you have a cover with today's month and day on the time/date slug in the CDS you post it here correct? So if I had one with an August 12th CDS it would go here?\n\nI have an awesome one coming up on the 18th! but so far nothing from today.\n\nPost by tomiseksj on\n\nJay and Zuzu,\n\nThe postmark on your cover, card or stamp should match the Month and Day that you are posting it.\n\nI included postmark dates in my cover and card inventory so that has made it easier for me to find covers to post.\n\nI haven't done the same with my stamps yet but I'm considering it -- this thread could provide the forcing function I need to get that effort up and running.\n\nI'm looking forward to you joining in on the 18th as that will fill one of my gaps.\n\nI could use some help on the 17th as well.\n\nAlso, just because a date has been covered doesn't preclude others from piling on -- that is a good thing as we all get to see a wider range of material.\n\nPost by Philatarium on\n\nSteve: I just wanted to offer up some moral support for this idea. I have many, many covers, US & foreign, but they're all in storage right now. Until I figure out what else to do with them, I could use them for their cancel dates. (And this indeed may be their new-found highest and best purpose.)\n\nBut I am realistically a couple of months away, at a minimum, from being able to tackle that. (I have a project deadline in early October I need to hit first.) But I'm with you here in concept.\n\nThanks for doing this!\n\n-- Dave\n\nPost by tomiseksj on\n\nAugust 20th, 1934. I wish I had the whole cover, whatever it was, but it is what it is. On the SS President Hoover to somewhere.\n\nWe at least know from the U.S.T.P. Sea Post postmark that the piece was being sent somewhere in the Pacific.\n\nHere is a picture of the S.S. President Hoover pierside in Manila:\n\nA caption accompanying the photo (see here on flickr) reads:\n\nJust after midnight in the early hours of December 11, 1937, one of the world's most luxurious cruise liners ran aground on Hoishoto Island (now Green Island) off the east coast of the Japanese colony of Formosa (Taiwan).\n\nThe American ship was en route from Kobe in Japan to Manila, Philippines. Her name was the SS President Hoover, a jewel in the crown of the Dollar Steamship Line.\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nA caption accompanying the photo (see here on flickr) reads:\n\nJust after midnight in the early hours of December 11, 1937, one of the world's most luxurious cruise liners ran aground on Hoishoto Island (now Green Island) off the east coast of the Japanese colony of Formosa (Taiwan).\n\nThe American ship was en route from Kobe in Japan to Manila, Philippines. Her name was the SS President Hoover, a jewel in the crown of the Dollar Steamship Line.\n\nThis made me curious so I looked up the history of the ship on Wikipedia. Very exciting! Among her adventures, she was bombed by Chinese forces led by Claire L. Chennault while trying to evacuate American citizens from Shanghai during the Sino-Japanese war. Chennault later got his own stamp, so I guess there were no hard feelings. ha ha\n\nRyan\n\nPost by tomiseksj on\n\nOn August 23, 1852, this stampless cover was sent from Wrentham, Massachusetts to Portsmouth, New Hampshire at the \"not prepaid\" rate of 5c. Prepayment of postage on domestic letters in the U.S. didn't become compulsory until April 1, 1855.\n\nPrior to July 1, 1845, postage was determined by the number of sheets of paper comprising a letter so the use of an outer wrapper or envelope incurred an additional postage charge. After July 1, 1845, the use of envelopes was no longer subject to an additional postage charge, opening the way to growth in the use of this form of stationery. In the U.S., the first machines for manufacturing envelopes were patented in 1848. (Source: American Stampless Cover Catalog, Volume I, 5th Edition)"
