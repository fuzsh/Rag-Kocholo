        "text": "Stanley Graduate Awards for International Research\n\nNora Connolly\n\nMFA, creative writing, fiction\n\nDestination: Ireland\n\nProject title: Around the Kitchen Table: Discourse on Irish Women’s Work, 1939-1985\n\nI will be traveling to Dublin and Cork to research the ways in which the advent of Irish women’s radio programs and cooking schools changed the way women communicated about their food-related labor between the years 1939 and 1985. I will investigate the ways in which the increase in media directed at women allowed them to share their thinking and strategies related to the domestic labor they performed and create a sense of solidarity as workers. This research will inform my novel-in-progress and help to situate it in a larger story of women’s work, women’s writing, and the history of cooking and restaurants in the 20th century.\n\nPoonam Dhir\n\nMFA, playwriting\n\nDestination: Punjab, India\n\nProject title: Understanding Grief: The Study of Death Rituals in Punjab, India\n\nI will spend six weeks in Punjab, conducting essential research on death rituals, a central element of my thesis play. As a playwright, I explore identity, trauma, memory, and the relationship between belief and belonging. I contemplate themes of migration, displacement, and loss. Conducting in-person research will allow me to consider these themes as they relate to this project. The Stanley Award will give me the opportunity to immerse myself in site-specific rituals and better understand the world of my characters.\n\nMaxime Garcia Diaz\n\nMFA, creative writing, poetry\n\nDestination: United Kingdom\n\nProject title: The English Internet: Traces of Computing History in the United Kingdom\n\nMy international research project explores the history of computing and the invention of the internet. I am interested in tracing the historical development of these extremely crucial technologies, which have been reshaping human society since the 1960s, and continue to do so in newer and newer ways. This thematic constellation forms the basis of my thesis project as well as my second full-length poetry collection. The Stanley Award allows me to fund my travel to the United Kingdom, where I aim to think through some crucial threads in the historical formation of the internet-and-the-computer: for instance, I want to investigate WWII code-breaking technology and the legacy of the British computing pioneer Alan Turing. I will process these themes into my writing practice, which is research-based, to complete a project that moves between academic research and poetry.\n\nRichard Frailing\n\nMFA, nonfiction writing\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject title: The Tides of History Along the Wadden Sea\n\nAs an ecological writer, I will research the natural history of the Wadden Sea in northern Germany, which is the largest intertidal wetland in the world and the home of my paternal ancestors. I am particularly interested in reckoning with the German past and the ways that ideology and ecological values shape each other across time. The Wadden Sea—now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site—specifically compels me as a site for meditating on the anthropocene. With the Stanley Award, I will be able to investigate archives, interview family members, and study the ecology of the Wadden Sea in person. This research will be crucial to writing a project of creative nonfiction that both reckons with history and seeks to understand paths towards greater environmental awareness and resilience.\n\nErica Hwang\n\nMFA, fiction\n\nDestination: South Korea\n\nProject title: Gwangju: Stories\n\nI will visit the May 18th National Cemetery, the Gwangju National Museum, the May 18th Democratization Movement Archives, Chonnam National University Museum, and epicenters of conflict — Provincial Hall, the Catholic Center, Gwangju High School, the YMCA— to make sense of place more real in my writing. As my maternal family is from Gwangju, it has always been important for me to write about the city’s history.\n\nSpencer Jones\n\nMFA, nonfiction\n\nDestination: England\n\nProject title: English Elementary School in Wartime, 1912-1920\n\nI will be conducting research in various archives to understand the experience of antiwar schoolteachers in England during World War I. I am interested in the intersections between conscientious objection, socialist movements, and the rise of universal schooling and professionalized teaching at the turn of the 20th century. Having taught high school myself for seven years before I came to the University of Iowa, I'm interested in using primary sources to understand how teachers understood the meaning of their vocation before, during, and after a national crisis. The Stanley Award will allow me to conduct on-the-ground primary source research in Derby, a city where there was significant commitment to socialist politics and antiwar advocacy. My MFA thesis profiles a family of antiwar teachers who were charged with conspiracy to assassinate Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1916. The Stanley Award will allow me to conduct research at the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford and the National Archives at Kew, where the transcripts and papers pertaining to the trial are housed. This funding will help me understand how wartime politicized teaching as a profession, and how one family in particular became caught in, and responded to, that crossfire.\n\nJeremy Karn\n\nMFA, creative writing, poetry\n\nDestination: Switzerland\n\nProject title: The Narratives of How Liberia Used Children as Fuel for a Civil War\n\nThanks to the Stanley Award, it will enable me to gather first-hand accounts of children who were abducted as child soldiers, children who went missing from their families and children who suffered horrendous abuses at the hands of rebels during a protracted civil war that was documented by the International Committee of the Red Cross. This award will afford me the resources, time, and space to complete my thesis and to uncover stories about how the children of Liberia were pinched into this lasting trauma from their experiences because their country used them to fuel the prolongation of a civil war—which will be the bedrock of my MFA thesis.\n\nStephanie Krzywonos\n\nMFA, nonfiction\n\nDestination: England\n\nProject title: Ice Folx: Stories from the Margins of Antarctic History\n\nAfter living and working in Antarctica for seven seasons, I realized that, as a woman of color, I couldn't see myself in traditional polar narratives, so I set out to write a book that profiles people on the margins of Antarctic history. In England, I'll examine unpublished primary source material from the tragic and legendary Terra Nova Expedition. Specifically, two of the men on that expedition could be the first documented queer relationship in Antarctic history; another of their fellow explorers is likely the first trans woman. England holds a trove of unpublished primary source material on the so-called ‘golden era' of Antarctic history, and the Stanley Award will enable me to access these priceless archives.\n\nSofia Kwon\n\nMFA, creative writing, fiction\n\nDestination: South Korea\n\nProject title: Representing Korean History: Contextualizing the Jeju Massacre within Twentieth-Century South Korean Global Development\n\nI am a first-year fiction student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop seeking to conduct research in South Korea to finish my MFA thesis project. My research will focus on a historical event, the April 3 Jeju Uprising and Massacre, to illuminate how state violence and United States global involvement contributed to the broader process of North and South Korea’s division, in order to depict Korean history in my work with nuance and care. Through the Stanley Award, I will visit various archival sites in Korea to use primary documents about the Jeju Massacre for which I wouldn’t otherwise have access. I’ll also seek to walk through various historical sites in Jeju Island related to the massacre, which the characters in my novel will also visit.\n\nYegene Lee\n\nMFA, creative writing, fiction\n\nDestination: South Korea\n\nProject title: Re-examining Modern Korean Identity Through Traditional Folklore\n\nThe research conducted this summer will support my MFA thesis project, a collection of ten short stories attempting to understand the common imagined Korean identity as it exists currently, both in Korea and abroad in the diaspora, through a re-interpretation of traditional folklore. Specifically, I hope to retell four major folktales (the Tale of Shim-cheong, the Legend of the Gumiho, the Legend of Arang, and the Song of Sun and Moon), in the same modern literary tradition of Angela Carter, Helen Oyeymi, and Bora Chung. Through the Stanley Award, I will access oral history recordings and primary documents at the National Archives of Korea in Daejeon and visit physical shrines in Gyeongsang-do and Jeju Island dedicated to major figures in Korean folklore. With the grant, I will track the evolution of women in folklore, as both storytellers and characters, and how their representation shifts based on whether the folk tale follows shamanic (the indigenous Korean religion), Buddhist, or Confucian tradition.\n\nUgochukwu Madu\n\nPhD, journalism and mass communication\n\nDestination: Nigeria\n\nProject title: “Ogbanje” – the Sickle Cell Disease Misinformation in Nigeria: Media as a SOURCEtainable Solution\n\n“This study investigates the role of mass media in combating Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) misinformation in Enugu, Nigeria, where SCD has been misinterpreted as Ọgbanje (a traditional phenomenon). This research not only addresses a critical public health issue but also serves as a preliminary step toward my dissertation, which focuses on public health and misinformation. Additionally, the findings will contribute to public health, sickle cell, and misinformation scholarships, potentially offering insights into how mass media can be leveraged to eradicate SCD and misinformation in Nigeria and beyond. Given that I am getting ready for my candidacy petition and dissertation proposal, this Stanley Award will enable me to get preliminary findings to work on my dissertation proposal on health misinformation.”\n\nSophia Musoki\n\nMA, geography\n\nDestination: Uganda\n\nProject title: Ugandan Women Farmers and Knowledge of Indigenous Vegetables\n\nMy research explores the role that women’s material lived experiences play in contributing to the production and preservation of food knowledge of indigenous and wild leafy green vegetables. I aim to explore how food knowledge is produced and passed on/preserved by women subsistence farmers and how this knowledge can inform efforts towards climate-related challenges such as global hunger. The Stanley Award will enable me to conduct vital research in western Uganda, among women subsistence farmers to answer my research questions. Using the financial assistance from the award, I will travel to Uganda and collect vital data that will contribute to my thesis and program completion.\n\nMofiyinfoluwa Okupe\n\nMFA, nonfiction\n\nDestination: Nigeria\n\nProject title: Mothertongue: Matrilineal Reckonings and Remembrances\n\nMothertongue is a project committed to tracing matrilineal ancestry through the land of southwestern Nigeria first to trace the life and times of my maternal grandmother and secondly to investigate and give words to the portrayals of ‘mother’ within the Yoruba traditional mythology and cosmology. This research is important to me because it seeks to combat the erasure of women in hyper-patriarchal societies while showcasing the redemptive force of memory to create art and preserve ancestors. Mothertongue is a project committed to tracing matrilineal ancestry through the land of southwestern Nigeria first to trace the life and times of my maternal grandmother and secondly to investigate and give words to the portrayals of ‘mother’ within the Yoruba traditional mythology and cosmology. This research is important to me because it seeks to combat the erasure of women in hyper-patriarchal societies while showcasing the redemptive force of memory to create art and preserve ancestors.\n\nJoshua Thermidor\n\nMFA, creative writing, poetry\n\nDestination: United Kingdom\n\nProject title: Imperium: Violence of Language in Empire's Cradle\n\n'A hurricane does not roar in pentameters,' said Kamau Brathwaite, speaking of imperial language’s inability to convey the Caribbean experience. From colonization of the West Indies, to West Indian regiments in World War I, to Windrush, to Grenfell— Britain has given countless evidence of how empires plunder their 'subjects.' Over a month, I will research the experiences of Caribbean migrants to Britain through the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton, the George Padmore Institute in Finsbury Park, and the British National Library. This research will be formative for my writing practice and serve as source material for my graduate thesis, a poetry collection about statehood, identity, and the power of lineage. Without the help of the Stanley Award funding, it would be far more difficult to make this journey. The Stanley Award is also a really great opportunity to develop research skills needed for my future plans in academia.\n\nEmily Wieder\n\nPhD, French and francophone world studies\n\nDestination: France\n\nProject title: Out from the Shadows: Women Surrealists who Resisted the Nazis in Paris\n\nMy project will investigate claims about two surrealist poets’ wives (Nusch Éluard and Jacqueline Lamba) and determine their role in the Resistance against the Nazi Occupation of Paris (1940-1944). By consulting archives and museum collections in Paris, I intend to valorize the role women surrealists played in the Resistance, which has not yet been fully developed in the scholarship. My prospectus, dissertation, future articles, and eventual scholarly collaborations will grow from this research. Obtaining the Stanley Award at this moment in my academic career – which coincides with the 100th anniversary of surrealism, a pivotal event for a rising scholar to witness – will equip me to make breakthrough contributions to this field.\n\nJeffrey Xiong\n\nMFA, creative writing, fiction\n\nDestination: Hong Kong\n\nProject title: Memory and Revolution in Chinese Contemporary Art\n\nAt the Asia Art Archive in Hong Kong, I will engage with archival material of major Chinese artistic movements and artists of the 80s, including the China Avant-garde and China’s New Art, Post-1989 exhibitions, to properly depict the artistic zeitgeist of this period, and inform my depictions of both the historical and speculative settings of my novel. I am specifically interested in the ways through which contemporary and avant-garde art defy the societal establishments of their time, carry the power to incite change, and reflect society at a slant.\n\nMiharu Yano\n\nMFA, literary translation\n\nDestination: Japan\n\nProject title: Translating Kora ~ Postwar Feminist Poetics ~\n\nMy project is to examine the manuscripts of Japanese poet Kōra Rumiko (1932-2021) in Tokyo, Japan. Her work is extensive, with her career spanning over 70 years, and her influence as a poet and a feminist historian is felt both in literary and academic spheres. I genuinely believe Kora’s work should be read by more people. The scope of this project goes beyond my own academic progress- she deserves a wider readership, and translation is one cogent way to achieve this. Access to Kora's manuscripts, which are only available in the Kora Rumiko Reference Room until the end of 2024, will provide me with the necessary materials to translate her work as I develop my thesis on Kora Rumiko.\n\nLara Zeng\n\nMFA, creative writing\n\nDestination: Singapore\n\nProject title: Theater in the Public Eye\n\nWith the support of the Stanley Award, I will conduct experiential performance and theater-based research in the unique city-state of Singapore. I am interested in the effects of state regulation, funding, and cultural policy on the Singaporean performing arts landscape, especially as they pertain to artwork and institutions such as Loo Zihan’s ‘Cane,’ the Singapore Fringe Festival, the Sands Theatre, professional-level student drama clubs, and Wayang (Chinese Street Opera). The ekphrastic work I produce will serve as the foundation for my MFA thesis in creative writing at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. As an aspiring multinational arts educator, I will also gain a greater understanding of effective arts pedagogy by illuminating and immersing myself in student and professional Singaporean theater.\n\nIsaac Addai\n\nActing in Theatre Arts\n\nDestination: Ghana\n\nProject Title: Sankofa\n\nIdentity is a complex and necessary part of humanity, it is our sense of self within the universal community. Identity may seem to be defined as spontaneous and autonomous in our present time, however, I believe that the essence of identity is rooted in the understanding of our history. In Ghanaian culture, the past is believed to possess the ability to provide context for the present and the future. There is a word in Twi from the Akan tribe of Ghana called Sankofa which means “go back and get it;” this word is derived from the Adinkra symbol of a bird which is symbolic of returning to one’s past to retrieve what is good in order to usher it into the present. My project intends to do just that, to go back and explore the knowledge of my motherland by utilizing historical artifacts from the University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art as living tour guides on my journey to discover what these emotional props have to offer to my personal sense of identity as well as the greater African and Black community here in Iowa City, and more broadly in the United States. This research will also provide experiential insight for my M.F.A thesis on my personal acting method. My professor of Acting, Caroline Clay, is currently on the university tenure track, a renowned working actress, and my personal mentor, will be guiding me in translating this research into a One-Man-Show that I intend to perform at the University of Iowa and in the greater community.\n\nLuke Allan\n\nBook Arts\n\nDestination: Iceland\n\nProject Title: Exploring the Sagas in Iceland\n\nFor the written component of my MFA thesis at the Center for the Book, I am developing an essay on books and family. The essay is a work of historical scholarship, exploring the book as a physical and cultural phenomenon across time. It is also a work of personal memoir and a meditation on loss. Bridging the academic and the personal is one of the creative challenges of my essay, which I first began to develop in a course titled “Readers and Reading” with Jennifer Burek Pierce in spring 2022 and have since developed further under the one-on-one supervision of Karen Carcia (fall 2022) and Inara Verzemnieks (spring 2023).\n\nJordan Barger\n\nLiterary Translation\n\nDestination: Norway\n\nProject Title: Translating Sigbjørn Obstfelder\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Grant for Travel to support research that is crucial to my MFA in Literary Translation. The primary reason for travel is to access the manuscripts of Sigbjørn Obstfelder, which are housed in the archives of The Munch Museum in Norway. Sigbjørn Obstfelder (1877-1900) was a Norwegian writer of the late 19th century, close friend of Edvard Munch, and considered to be the first modernist Norwegian writer. His poem “Jeg Ser” is known by all Norwegians and mimics the sense of alienation found in Munch’s famous painting The Scream. Obstfelder and Munch were so close that the remains of Obstfelder’s unpublished work were in Munch’s archives, which are now in the possession of The Munch Museum. I first made contact with The Munch Museum when I translated Obstfelder’s essay “Edvard Munch: A Defense,” published in the art history magazine Caesura. I would like the Stanley Grant to support the research necessary for my MFA Thesis, a critical paratext, as well as a publication of the Collected Works of Sigbjørn Obstfelder.\n\nElise Bickford\n\nLiterary Translation\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject Title: Translating Elke Erb's Kastanienalle\n\nIf readers in the US are at all familiar with the literature of East Germany, it is likely through the works of Bertolt Brecht, Christa Wolf,\n\nand Heiner Müller and the lens of literary socialism. Much of GDR literature, especially that which emerged in underground scenes and\n\nchallenged state-authorized aesthetics, remains undiscovered by American readers. For instance, Elke Erb, one of the most prominent\n\nvoices of the GDR Avant Garde, is largely unknown to the Anglophone world. A celebrated poet in Germany, Erb is famous for her spare and stubborn poems, which calmly but relentlessly interrogate language. While some of these exceptional poems have been translated,\n\nonly a small selection is available in English. Furthermore, none of the poems from one of her most innovative books, Kastanienallee,\n\nare accessible in English.\n\nFor my MFA thesis in Literary Translation, I intend to translate Kastanienallee and write a substantive critical introduction, which analyzes and historically situates the unique form of reflexive poetic consciousness Erb develops within it. A Stanley Graduate Award in International Research would facilitate this work. The grant would enable me to spend six weeks in Berlin, Germany, visiting the Elke Erb Archive and consulting local poets and scholars, including Erb herself. I also would conduct site-specific research around the street of Kastanienallee, where Erb wrote the collection, and the surrounding neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg, which was the home of many pre-Wende publishing houses and art collaboratives.\n\nFrancisco Javier Espinosa Momox\n\nCeramics\n\nDestination: Mexico\n\nProject Title: Herencia Means Heritage\n\nCreate an audiovisual documented experience that portrays the collaborative link between me and four artisans with a long trajectory in the field. It is important because I intent to reflect on how we conceive creativity according to our different creative visions.\n\nChristopher Green\n\nCreative Writing (Fiction)\n\nDestination: UK\n\nProject Title: God’s Own Country: English Institutional and Ecclesial Decline in Fiction\n\nAs a first-year at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I am applying for the Stanley Graduate Award for International Research in order to spend four weeks in Yorkshire, England, conducting research for my M.F.A. in Creative Writing thesis project, “Throwing Away My Entire Life,” a collection of short stories about evolving religious beliefs in the U.K. and its former colonies. Raised in a blue-collar household, I write about characters of low-and-middle-incomes who are defined by larger trends of absent social support, political turbulence, and institutional decline. I will travel to Yorkshire (known by locals as “God’s Own Country”), which maintains many oral history archives (unavailable online) that should illuminate an unprecedented shift of religious views among the working-class over the last half-century. Just this year the British Office for National Statistics reported a sharp decline in Christian affiliation in the last two decades, from 72% to 46%; while the British Trades Union Congress reports that manufacturing employment in the U.K. experienced one of the steepest declines of almost any advanced economy globally between 1960 and 2015. My research will explore how this correlation has manifested in Yorkshire individuals and ecclesial organizations of the last fifty years.\n\nKayla Howerton\n\nCommunication Sciences and Disorders\n\nDestination: South Korea\n\nProject Title: International Collaboration on Brain Computer Interface for Hearing\n\nUnderstanding speech in noise is a difficult task, even among normal hearing listeners, but especially for those with a hearing impairment. Right now, the only support available to hearing impaired listeners are hearing aids. While these listening devices do help in most situations, they fail when the listener enters the most difficulty listening situation, speech in background noise. Hearing aid companies boast that their newest devices are the best at understanding speech in noise; however, the problem remains. Hearing aids all have their own proprietary algorithms, but they essentially all do the same thing. When sound enters the external microphones, it is then digitized by the processing chip, amplified, and then leaves through a speaker in the patient’s ear canal. While hearing aids are “customized” to each persons’ specific hearing loss, this still does not tell the hearing aid what to listen for and what to ignore. This becomes especially difficult in situations where what the person wants to listen to and what needs to be ignored are within the same frequency range. For example, when a listener is at a restaurant. The hearing aid will amplify the speech of interest, say the person across the table, but it will also amplify the surrounding speech. Thus, providing the listener with a multitude of sounds, all amplified to aid with their hearing loss. These types of listening situations are among the most difficult for hearing aid wearers and cause a great amount of frustration. Therefore, we aim to develop a brain computer interface (BCI)-based closed-loop hearing aids, which is based on BCI that automatically identifies the target sound the user wants to hear in a noisy environment, selectively amplifies that target and reduces other noises.\n\nXiaoyan Kang\n\nPlaywriting\n\nDestination: China\n\nProject Title: The Words of Ants\n\nI am seeking a Stanley Graduate Award for International Research, from May 21 to June 19, 2023, to conduct research in China’s Jiangyong County for my full-length play. In feudal China, a community of women in Jiangyong created their own script to secretly communicate with each other. They called it the script of ants, inscribing it on handkerchiefs, fans and papers like little ornaments, deemed insignificant by men. This script thus escaped men’s notice and safely circulated among women, providing an outlet for their sufferings and sorrows. It is a script of women’s hardships as well as their secret rebellion against the patriarchy. It remained secret until being discovered by a man in 1954. In 1983, the script of ants aroused international attention and has since been publicly known as Nüshu, the script of women. In my play, the last natural inheritor of Nüshu finds herself in a difficult situation. She refuses to write Nüshu because it only reminds her of past sufferings. Also, it is meant to be shared only among sworn sisters, not for public spectacles. However, the local officials as well as passionate lovers of traditional cultures constantly urge her to preserve this cultural heritage and pass it on. I want to visit Jiangyong County to discover the final decision of my main character. I will visit the Nüshu museum to learn about individual stories surrounding this script and how Nüshu is publicized in modern China. I will also attend the local Nüshu school to study the script and its chanting. This research process will contribute greatly to the building of my characters and I intend to complete the first draft of my play shortly after the trip.\n\nSarah Khatry\n\nNonfiction Writing\n\nDestination: Nepal\n\nProject Title: Tigers of the Terai\n\nThe endangered Bengal tiger is a potent symbol both of the power of the natural world and its vulnerability. In 2022, Nepal became the only country to hit international conservation milestones for tigers, tripling their tiger population from 2009. Soon, what had been a rare conservation success story turned into widespread news briefings about the comparable rise in deadly incidents among local people who live within or alongside the tiger habitats, along with the predation of livestock. With the support of a Stanley Travel Grant, I am interested in investigating and writing narrative journalism about the complex tension between the environmentalism of an idealized natural world, often imposed top-down by the state, and what has been called “the environmentalism of the poor,” which arises from the local communities that are in fact enmeshed with the natural world.\n\nSun Young Lee\n\nCreative Writing - Fiction\n\nDestination: South Korea\n\nProject Title: Fictionalizing the History of South Korean Film Censorship, 1963–73\n\nSpecifically, I am interested in the anti-communist propaganda films Marines Are Gone (Lee Man-hee, 1963), The Dead and the Alive (Lee Kang-cheon, 1966), A Hero without Serial Number (Lee Man-hee, 1966), 8240 KLO (Jung Jin-woo, 1966), Special Agent X-7 (Chung Chang-hwa, 1966), Accusation (Kim Soo-yong, 1967), Flame in the Valley (Kim Soo-yong, 1967), ​​I Want to Be Human (Yu Hyun-mok, 1969), and Testimony (Im Kwon-taek, 1973). This list will grow as I explore the archive and refine my research questions based on my viewings. At the National Archives of Korea, I plan to read and translate primary documents of the Motion Pictures Act of 1963, 1966, 1970, and 1973; related government documentation; and criminal statutes on obscenity.\n\nSiqi Liu\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: China\n\nProject Title: Years of Fewer Sparrows: Culture and Politics in 1960-1990 Hunan\n\nAfter completing my first year as a fiction student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I will travel to Changsha, China in June 2023 to conduct thesis research at the Hunan Library and the Hunan Museum. My thesis will be a short story collection that follows the Chinese diasporic experience from Hunan to the American Midwest, and spans from the Cultural Revolution to present day. The first half of the collection, which is comprised of three short stories and a novella, is set in Hunan and will be the focus of my research. I will visit the Hunan Museum’s Mawangdui exhibit to gather reference material for my novella. I will also examine regional newspapers in the Ancient Books Reading Room of the Hunan Library to learn about the historical and political context for my stories set in the Cultural Revolution’s aftermath.\n\nDavid Lomoywara\n\nJournalism and Mass Communication\n\nDestination: Kenya\n\nProject Title: The Role of Local Radio in Eradicating Female Genital Mutilation in West Pokot County, Kenya\n\nThere is a high prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in West Pokot County, Kenya, despite local continued efforts by multiple stakeholders – healthcare workers, non-governmental organizations, and media outlets – to sensitize community members about its negative implications. To explore the role of local radio in eradicating FGM, I plan to interview stakeholders in West Pokot County. In the Pokot community, local radio is instrumental in disseminating relevant information to community members. This study will be a foundation for the larger project I intend to do for my dissertation. It will also be vital in adding knowledge to community media, development communication, media literacy, misinformation, and the role of local radio in the Global South.\n\nSara Luzuriaga\n\nWriter's Workshop - Fiction\n\nDestination: France\n\nProject Title: Multicultural Modern Dance in Contemporary France: Writing Fiction about the Montpellier Dance Festival\n\n“Outside of Paris, a modern dancer is still not a ‘dancer,’” choreographer Maguy Marin explained to a New York Times reporter in 1983, during the first performances of French modern dance in New York. I am applying for a Stanley Graduate Award for International Research to travel to France after my second semester at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Over five weeks in Paris and Montpellier, I will conduct research for my MFA thesis in fiction writing, a novel about a Philadelphia-based modern dance company, Garza Movement, that participates in the Montpellier Dance Festival (MDF). This project involves understanding how the MDF has shaped modern dance in France, and how France’s multiculturalism manifests in this developing form. The U.S. developed its own modern dance techniques from choreographers like Merce Cunningham and José Limón; France, conversely, prioritized classical ballet until recent decades. I will interview multicultural French dancers and choreographers with whom I connected during a year in Lyon. Library and municipal archives in Paris and Montpellier offer undigitized footage from the festival’s inauguration in 1981. This research will reveal how modern dance is developing in contemporary France, with a particular eye toward how France’s diverse population represents itself in this genre.\n\nYen Pham\n\nCreative Writing/Fiction\n\nDestination: Vietnam\n\nProject Title: Post-War Urban and Cultural Transformation through the Diasporic Lens in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nI propose to travel to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam to carry out research for my M.F.A thesis in fiction, a novella about the development of a young artist. It touches on themes of urban transformation, legacies of colonialism, and experiences of the Vietnamese diaspora. HCMC is unique in Vietnam for its cosmopolitanism, mix of global influences, and swift rate of growth and change. The central figure in my novella, which is set in the present day, is a visual artist of Vietnamese descent who has grown up in Australia. She has the opportunity to spend time in HCMC as part of an artist development program. As a consequence, her parents also travel to Vietnam, which they left as refugees.The unifying frame in the text is the protagonist’s work on an art project that interprets and responds to the city’s history of occupation and conflict, as well as its ongoing transformation.\n\nMy research focuses on two questions: if art is one of our primary methods of meaning making, how do human beings process rapid urban and cultural shifts through art? How do we construct our senses of self and identity when our original reference points no longer exist? These questions are pertinent not only in reference to the past but to the future, as phenomena like climate change and population ageing will result in significant demographic shifts and migration, reshaping the world. The support of the Stanley grant will allow me to conduct the site-specific research into contemporary Vietnamese art and into HCMC itself that will make it possible for me to complete my project.\n\nMan Phan\n\nEducational Policy and Leadership Studies\n\nDestination: Vietnam\n\nProject Title: Understanding Vietnamese Parents’ Perspectives on U.S. Public and Private Universities\n\nInternational students are increasingly important to the U.S. higher education in terms of their presence, economic contribution and cultural exchanges. To recruit more international students, U.S. institutions need to understand how international students identify US campuses to apply to, and subsequently choose to attend. The literature on college choice is expansive, but few researchers have paid close attention to the nuances of how students in specific nations approach the process. This study will apply a qualitative, phenomenological approach to exploring how Vietnamese parents shape their students’ process of pursuing attendance at U.S. public and private universities. The findings will contribute to the current knowledge of international students’ decision-making process. Furthermore, this study will benefit recruiters of U.S. institutions and high school counselors who need to understand the education trends of Vietnam, one of the leading countries which sent most students to the U.S.\n\nShay Ridl\n\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\n\nDestination: Canada\n\nProject Title: Examining the record of Alpine and Apennine Mountain Building\n\nDeepwater marine systems of the Marnoso-arenacea and Laga formations preserve an extensively studied record of mountain building associated with topographic development and erosion of the Apennine mountains in northern and central Italy. Fundamental questions still remain on the genesis of these strata, primarily regarding whether the sediment was derived from the older (Eocene-Oligocene) western and central Alps or if it was derived from younger (Miocene-Pliocene) Apennine source regions. The distinction is important as the timing of mountain building helps us understand the drivers and provides insight into fundamental Earth processes. This study aims to collect new detrital apatite fission track (AFT) data from the rock formations of interest in order to provide insight into the genesis debate. The proposed research outlines a month-long (31 day) international collaborative laboratory study to collect these data. This project will provide an advanced hands-on learning experience that will ultimately help advance academic and career goals and build international collaborations while living abroad for an extended period of time.\n\nOthuke Umukoro\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: Ghana\n\nProject Title: The poetics of bodies, blood and water: the transatlantic slave trade\n\nFor over three centuries hell was let loose on the African continent. At least 12.5 million of my ancestors—men, women and children—were captured, shackled, sold and smashed into monstrous ships that sailed for the New World where, under heartless conditions, they worked their souls to death in sweltering cotton fields and endless sugarcane plantations. The transatlantic slave trade is a bitter and historical subject, one that is so vast it's almost inexhaustible. This project brings the poetics of bodies, blood and water face to face with the history of the transatlantic slave trade, examining how in that intersection there is an empire of ruin. In the winter of 2023, my creative writing research will take me to Elmina Castle, in Ghana, one of the major slave-holding depots of the transatlantic slave trade in West Africa built in 1482 by the Portuguese.\n\nKelly Vu\n\nPharmD & Global Health Certificate\n\nDestination: Japan\n\nProject Title: The Perspectives of Japanese Women Ages 18-45 on Herbal Medicine and Kampo Use for Premenstrual Syndrome Management\n\nAbout 75% of women are affected by premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and herbal medicine can be a viable option for treatment (OASH 2021). In Japan, Kampo is a subtype of herbal medicine that can be utilized for different treatments. Kampo is an affordable option as it can be covered by the Japanese government based on the National Health Insurance Price List (Maegawa et al., 2014). This study will investigate the efficacy of Kampo use for PMS from the perspectives of Japanese women. My population of interest is Japanese women ages 18-45 who have experienced PMS. I will use online surveys and semi-structured interviews to obtain data through a mixed methods approach. I plan to conduct this study for about 3-4 months in the summer of 2023. Physicians can use the data from this study to understand patients' perspectives and see the benefits from prescribing Kampo as an option for PMS treatment. Other doctors from outside Japan can use this information to integrate herbal medicine into treatment plans, leading to better patient-provider rapport (Tonob & Melby 2017).\n\nNatalia Zdaniuk\n\nCreative Writing/Fiction\n\nDestination: Poland\n\nProject Title: Students in Solidarnosc: The Collaborations and Tensions between University Association and Labour Unions During Poland's Solidarity Movement\n\nWith support from the Stanley Graduate Award for International Research, I propose to spend four weeks in Poland, in the cities of Gdańsk and Warsaw, to conduct archival research to inform a historical novel I am writing for my MFA thesis in fiction at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop. The novel is set in Poland during the pivotal years of the Solidarity Movement between 1976 and the fall of Communist rule in 1989. Understood as both a labour struggle and a national fight for independence, the strength of this movement was made possible by the collaboration between workers and intellectuals (Bloom, 2013). My novel seeks to examine this collaboration, following the story of Basia, a Polish university student actively involved in The Workers Defence Committee and the Student Committee of Solidarity. It is a novel of interconnected narratives, told from the varied perspectives of Basia’s family, friends, and fellow protestors. In particular, it explores the tension between Basia and her father — a factory worker — and the distinct ways they are each impacted by their country’s political situation. By examining archival materials from labour unions and university associations, I aim to gain detailed insights that will enhance a literary depiction of how Polish workers and intellectuals negotiated their differences.\n\nXiadi Zhai\n\nCreative Writing/Poetry\n\nDestination: Ireland\n\nProject Title: Modernizing Irish Keening to Heal from Communal Grief\n\nIn the wake of global loss from this pandemic, my proposed Stanley Grant will allow me to revive and modernize the ancient Irish poetic form of keening. For centuries, \"caoineadh\", or keening, was a necessary part of Irish funerary rituals. The extemporaneous dirges were composed and performed publicly by women to lament their deceased. This tradition allowed entire communities to gather in grief, moved by words and wailing. While there is ongoing research in Irish folklore departments to study the history of keening and some recent work to reimagine it in a modern context, this undertaking of composing a modern-day keen is novel. Through this 34-day research project, I will utilize oral composition methods to produce a modern keen in Cork County, Ireland, where the infamous “Lament for Art O’Leary” was composed by Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill. The resulting poem and performance will be an exploration of grief and mourning foundational to my poetry thesis.\n\nAdedayo Agarau\n\nCreative Writing - Poetry\n\nDestination: Nigeria\n\nProject Title: Environmental Violence and the Concept of Empire in Lagos: Writing Poems About the Reality of Environmental violence in Lagos, and other cities in Nigeria\n\nI am applying for a Stanley Graduate Award for International Research to write poetry of and about neighborhoods in Lagos (the 7th largest economy in Africa) and Ibadan (the largest city in West Africa) in partial completion of my graduate project which responds to the ecological assault in the post-independence phase of Nigeria. In the manuscript, I will explore places like Eti Osa, Makoko, 7Up, Bariga, Festac Town, and Epe in Lagos to visualize environmental waste and pollution, and several markets in Ibadan like Bere, Oja Oba, Molete, Sasha, and Eleyele which are some of the dirtiest places. I will use my poetry to paint these places, interrogate dwellings and question the perception of home. I will visit government-licensed dumpsites, creating poetry about the meanings of structures in places that have been marked for degradations. I will also visit historical landmarks like Osogbo, the home of the river goddess, “Osun” where I will interrogate godhood and sanctity, in contrast with the environmental degradation and the influence of climate change in larger cities like Lagos and Ibadan.\n\nEric Akuoko\n\nScience Education/Teaching & Learning\n\nDestination: South Africa\n\nProject Title: Epistemic Tool Use in a 'Discursive' Science Classroom for Knowledge Generation: The Role of Argumentation in Inquiry - Based Instruction\n\nThe proposed Stanley grant study seeks to examine the role argumentation plays during\n\nepistemic discourse/talk in a typical inquiry-based science instruction. Drawing on two\n\ntheoretical frameworks—Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach and Toulmin’s Argument\n\nPattern/model (TAP)—this study focuses on how argumentation is enacted in a prototypic\n\nknowledge generation science classroom (Greenbowe & Hand, 2005; Loiu, 2006). The 8-week\n\ndata collection/study (June-August,2022) would be conducted at African Leadership Academy in\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa. Participant Observation and semi-structured interviews would be the main data collection tools for this project. Given that, inquiry-based science instruction is immersive and the argumentations that characterize such lessons are better noticed during participant observations, the choice of this case-study, fieldwork is in tandem with the decision to undertake on-site participant observation (Stake, 2014). This pre-dissertation study will not only contribute to existing scholarship on knowledge generation, but also prepare me for my Ph.D. dissertation and research practice.\n\nMunachim Amah\n\nMass Communication / School of Journalism and Mass Communication\n\nDestination: Nigeria\n\nProject Title: Reporting Marginality: News media representations of poverty in Nigeria\n\nFor a qualitative research seminar that I took in the first semester of my PhD program, I conducted a pilot study on the coverage of poverty in Iowa. I found that journalists often relied on macro data and quotes from official sources instead of talking to people from low-income communities. Consequently, the daily realities of such people were mostly absent from news: How do they access healthcare? How do they access education? What kinds of choices do they have to make about food and housing? How do they form and maintain social ties? My goal for my doctoral research is to broadly examine how poor people are represented in news and the relationship between such representations and public opinion as well as policy. I intend, with a Stanley award, to explore this phenomenon in the Nigerian context where, according to recent World Bank data, over 40% of the population lives in poverty. As a preliminary study for my dissertation proposal, this study will enable me to investigate an aspect of the aforementioned broad research problem.\n\nHilary Bell\n\nCreative Writing, Fiction\n\nDestination: Italy\n\nProject Title: Friulian Dialect and The Madre Lingua in Translation\n\nAfter the completion of my third semester of coursework at The Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I will travel to Aviano, Italy to conduct research for my M.F.A. thesis in fiction–a full-length novel–as well as my Graduate Certificate in Literary Translation. My novel concerns a young American teacher who abandons her post at an Italian air base to search for her estranged mother. It explores the complexities of regional dialect, the Italian idea of the \"Madre Lingua,\" linguistic identity, and family dynamics across cultures. Alongside the drafting of this manuscript, I plan to translate an accompanying selection of Italian writings, as well as a section from my own novel, for my Graduate Certificate in Literary Translation. In doing so, I hope to examine the intersection of fiction and translation in real time–exploring the ways in which the act of translation becomes both a narrator and a character in the stories we tell.\n\nSamuel Boucher\n\nHistory\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject Title: German Reputation in Latin America\n\nThe Stanley Award would allow me to examine the economic success of the Low-German Mennonite colonies of Latin America by looking at perceptions of Germans (and therefore Mennonites) found in Spanish-language media sources located centrally in the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut (IAI). While in Berlin and not Latin America, IAI is one of the leading libraries for Latin American studies in the world (https://www.iai.spk-berlin.de/startseite.html). It is filled with records and sources in this topic (such as: Una anecedota de Humboldt found in Mundo argentino 23 de agosto de 1915) in both Spanish and German). Additionally, IAI is located near the Free University of Berlin, the nexus of the literature on Germans in Latin America. Thus, I will also be able to connect with the major scholars in the field (such as Stefan Rinke), and further develop my dissertation topic:\n\nDispersed throughout Latin America are small colonies of Mennonites, a Low German Anabaptist sect. Originating in Holland and Switzerland, the persecuted Mennonites eventually moved from East Prussia to Russia then Canada before finally settling in Latin America, but—like other German settlers—the Mennonites have maintained their German language and customs throughout this sojourn. From the hinterlands around Ciudad Cuauhtémoc in Chihuahua, Mexico to the jungles of Western Belize, from the Eastern plains of Bolivia to the pampas of Argentina, Mennonites have formed nearly one hundred colonies within Latin America, and they have been able to accumulate capital and become relatively prosperous in relation to their host country's native population.\n\nNathan Chaplin\n\nHistory\n\nDestination: Nicaragua\n\nProject Title: The Gateway to the Universe: The Nicaragua Canal and the Midwest\n\nThroughout the late 19th century, U.S. politicians viewed Nicaragua as the most promising location for a trans-oceanic canal. The San Juan River, which composed a large part of Nicaraguan’s southern border, meant less dredging than the alternatives and the Nicaraguan route was consistently presented as the cheapest option. In the 1850s, U.S. politicians emphasized the canal’s capacity to unite the United States, facilitating immigration to and trade with the new state of California. While the transcontinental railroad eventually made this a lesser priority, by the 1890s control over a trans-isthmian route signified dominance over Pacific trade. Across the 19th century, Midwestern scientists played an essential role in the continuous canal construction efforts. Numerous botanists, funded by the Nicaragua Canal Construction Company, provided popular sketches of the Nicaraguan environment, culture, and population for Midwestern readers. Physicians and engineers attempted to solve the numerous logistical problems of large-scale tropical construction, while simultaneously projecting an image of the United States to their Nicaraguan colleagues. Upon their return to Midwest, these scientists harnessed their overseas expertise to bolster the reputation of their young universities, including the University of Iowa. At the same time, these professors used their academic credentials and position as objective scientists to stress the validity of the canal project, often at the behest of their corporate financiers.\n\nHyunsik Chun\n\nSociology and Criminology\n\nDestination: Korea, Australia\n\nProject Title: The Diffusion of Collective Actions for Memorialization: Collective Memories, Discursive Opportunities, and Divergent Outcomes\n\nThis project will systematically examine social movements as a carrier of the ideas and definitions that affect historical injustice to contemporary inequality issues. Two contemporary social movements and their cultural impacts will be examined to understand the diffusion pattern of memorialization and its variant outcomes. The campaign to remove Confederate statues is part of the BLM movement in the United States that challenges the western history of racism, and the campaign to build statues of Peace is part of the transnational feminist “comfort women” movement that commemorates the sexual trafficking victims of the Imperial Japanese Army during the WWII. This project will combine traditional quantitative data analysis with qualitative in-depth interviews to examine how social movements affect local discursive opportunities and affect the decision to remove (the United States) or build (Korea and Sydney, Australia) statues. I will examine when and how the Black Lives Matter movement and the “Comfort Women” movement affect the diffusion pattern of memorialization and its variant outcomes.\n\nEirill Falck\n\nLiterary Translation\n\nDestination: Norway\n\nProject Title: Researching and Translating Edvard Munch’s Literary Manuscripts\n\nWith a Stanley Graduate Award, I will spend four weeks in Norway researching and translating the literary manuscripts of Edvard Munch and writing the critical introduction to my thesis.\n\nWhile Edvard Munch’s paintings rank among the most famous artworks in the world, is not well-known that Munch also harbored substantial literary ambitions. His personal notebooks contain drafts of stories, novels, poems, aphorisms, and essayistic diary entries. My aim is to create a book-length collection of translations showcasing the range of Munch’s writing, employing translation practices that foreground the link between Munch the artist and Munch the writer.\n\nRebecca Flowers\n\nNonfiction Writing Program\n\nDestination: Australia\n\nProject Title: Aboriginal Divers in New South Wales: Alternate Histories of Diving\n\nI plan to research the relationship of aboriginal peoples in New South Wales, Australia to diving. I will collect oral histories from aboriginal divers and others in their communities to understand the diving culture on-site in New South Wales from June 15th through July 15th, 2022. My data collection will involve interviews with aboriginal peoples, advocates, and researchers in the area. I will shadow divers to better understand their diving practices and their passage from generation to generation. The Stanley Award for International Research is perfect for achieving these goals. My scuba diving certifications, background in biology, and interest in diving outside of the European tradition inform my approach. My research will culminate in at least one robust 6,000-word essay, if not more. The data I collect will serve as the basis for my MFA thesis, which will consist of a series of essays considering the history of scuba diving. This project will take place after my first year of graduate studies, allowing me a head start on research necessary for my thesis.\n\nJacob Goldwasser\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: Netherlands\n\nProject Title: Historical Narratives of Environment in the Netherlands\n\nI’m applying for the Stanley Award for International Research to study the paradox of the Netherlands in the climate crisis. Early Dutch companies and contemporary Dutch megacorporations pioneered the global supply chains that are in part responsible for the modern catastrophe of greenhouse gasses and sea-level rise. But the Netherlands is also extremely vulnerable to rising seas, with more than a quarter of its land below sea level and 17% of its land reclaimed from water. Research into Dutch environmental history and technology will provide a foundation for my poetry thesis on psychological ramifications of climate change and environmental degradation. It will serve as an case study in the historical interaction with the changing environment.\n\nIn the Netherlands, I plan to research the history and current state of water management as it has shaped a national and regional character, in particular: the North Sea flood of 1953; land reclamation projects such as the formation of the Flevoland polder; contemporary windmill, levee, and dam engineering projects, especially the Delta Works; and the Polder System, a tradition of political cooperation and a form of mutual aid aimed at maintaining critical water-management infrastructure for the better part of a thousand years. Over the course of this 32-day trip, through on-site and archival research only possible in the Netherlands, I plan to write a series of 10 poems that will be the basis for my poetry thesis.\n\nSik Suen (Rosemarie) Ho\n\nFiction\n\nDestination: United Kingdom\n\nProject Title: British Colonial Suppression of the 1925 Hong Kong General Strike\n\nWith support from the Stanley Graduate Award for International Research, I propose to spend four weeks in London from mid-June to mid-July for archival research into the 1925-1926 Hong Kong-Canton general strike—specifically the general socioeconomic conditions that led to mass discontent, and the ways in which officers in the employ of the colonial administration and other colonial subjects perceived the dedicated organizing of local unions and activist groups for better economic/political conditions as a threat to the imperialist project. My archival research at the National Archives and the London School of Economics’ special collections will inform the structure and content of my novella about the colonial repression of Hong Kongers, which doubles as my thesis project for my MFA in fiction at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.\n\nFalak Jalali\n\nGeographical and Sustainability Sciences\n\nDestination: India\n\nProject Title: Impact of Education on the Imagined Future of Agriculture\n\nThe Stanley Award will allow me to conduct 6 weeks of ethnographic research in the rural district of Sirmour in Himachal Pradesh (HP), India, to examine how education shapes youth’s perceptions and visions for agriculture. India’s economic policy of liberalization in the early 1990s influenced (i) the decline in the economic viability of agriculture, as well as (ii) increased employment opportunities in the urban core of the country. This prompted huge numbers of rural youth to enroll in higher education to gain formal employment in urban centers. Despite increased enrollment in education, the attempts to ‘educate oneself out of agriculture have largely been futile especially for marginalized communities. A large body of research documents how India’s “jobless” growth has not enabled widespread formal employment for the rural poor - 60% of the Indian population is engaged in agriculture. While scholars have rigorously documented the dynamics of jobless growth, pursuits of higher education, and agrarian distress, there is surprisingly little research investigating how education may shape the actual practices and future visions for agriculture. The research that does exist on the linkages between education and agriculture offers conflicting findings: while some suggest that education results in youth being disinterested in agriculture, others suggest that education may enable new forms of curiosity and innovation in agriculture. Additionally, historical processes of caste, class, and gender discrimination as well as the continued shadow of colonialism within the Indian education systems has hindered equal access to quality education. A key objective of my research is to investigate the impact of higher education on the future of farming imagined by young men and women from agrarian communities and how this imagination varies along the axes of gender, caste, and class.\n\nTrevor Kildiszew-Sikorski\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject Title: The Soft Outlines: Hannah Höch's Garden & Weimar Judaism\n\nMy proposed Stanley Grant will allow me to see the undigitized, 12,000-artifact estate of renowned Dadaist Hannah Höch in Berlin, Germany. It would also allow me to do on-site research and cataloging of plants in both Höch’s World War Two garden refuge as well as prominent sites of Jewish heritage in Berlin during the Weimar era with hopes of exploring and writing about the subjectivity and resilient joy of people on the fringes during times of intense violence. The grant would pay for travel expense, lodging, numerous trips to at least 3 Berlin galleries, as well as on-site exploration of the gardens and homes of individuals who brought radical, joyous change to the art and media world at a time when Europe was on the brink of destruction. By cataloging plant-life, writing about artifacts and Höch’s gender-nonconforming art practice, and the flourishing of Weimar era Jewish community, I will end with a chapbook-length project of documentary poetry, essay, and ekphrasis.\n\nSora Kim\n\nLanguage, Literacy and Culture Education\n\nDestination: Korea\n\nProject Title: Foreignness Explored by Teachers and Learners of Korean Language\n\nI will visit Korea to undertake preliminary research investigating foreignness in Korean as a Second Language (KSL) classrooms in Korea. Instructors of Korean language from a variety of settings will be interviewed to reveal participants ' experiences and thoughts as to how they position themselves when Korean language and culture are globalized and capitalized, demarcating natives and foreigners. Understanding the struggles of instructors of Korean language can also give valuable insights into the present and future of pedagogy for world language education.\n\nLauren Krukowski\n\nPrintmaking\n\nDestination: South Africa\n\nProject Title: Printmaking and Print Collaboration in South Africa\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, I will spend six weeks in South Africa participating in a Print Workshop Residency at the David Krut Workshop in Johannesburg. The David Krut Workshop is an established collaborative print workshop specializing in intaglio and monotype techniques. There, I will observe and assist professional printmakers in collaborating with artists to make editioned fine art prints. I will also visit other print workshops, artists' studios, and museums in South Africa to broaden my understanding of printmaking and the global community of printmakers working today.\n\nYasmin Majeed\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: United Kingdom\n\nProject Title: Writing the History of the British Asian Youth Movements in Fiction\n\nI will spend four weeks in the United Kingdom conducting research for my M.F.A. thesis project, Tributary, a novel-in-stories that follows an interconnected group of Pakistani immigrants living in the U.K and the U.S. The novel follows several characters, including Asad, who grew up in the U.K. in the 70’s and 80’s. I plan to do research that will inform a significant section of the novel that follows Asad as a young man coming of age during Thatcher-era Britain, where he is involved in youth-led anti-racist organizing. The research will also shape the chapters on his son Samir’s present-day visit to the U.K. as an adult, where he attempts to reconnect with his father and his radical political past. My cultural and historical research focuses on the Pakistani diaspora in the U.K., and on the Asian Youth Movements, grassroots organizing done in response to institutional racism in Britain in the 1970’s and 80’s. Inspired by the Civil Rights and Black Power movement, working class South Asian youth mobilized against anti-immigration policies, police brutality, and labor injustices. The U.K. holds many of the major archives on this history, including the Bishopsgate Institute, the British Film Institute, and the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Archive. With this research, I plan to explore the relationship between my character’s ethnic and class identities, and in turn, the legacy of British Asian resistance movements, and I will have greater historical accuracy and a richer characterization of the Pakistani immigrant community in my novel.\n\nThomas Mira y Lopez\n\nLiterary Translation\n\nDestination: Brazil\n\nProject Title: Translating José J. Veiga's Little Horses of Platiplanto (Os Cavalinhos de Platiplanto)\n\nJosé J. Veiga (1915-1999), a contemporary of writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Julio Cortazar, was a Brazilian fiction writer known for surreal, regionalized stories that feature the distinct landscape and culture of Brazil’s interior, often set in his home state of Goiás. While Veiga is a hallowed figure in Brazilian literature, regarded as the foremost practitioner of magical realism and the recipient of Brazil’s most prestigious literary prizes, he remains little known in the Anglophone world. For my MFA thesis in Literary Translation, I am working to bring Veiga’s first book Os Cavalinhos de Platiplanto to English speaking audiences, a task that requires deep immersion in both field and archival research. Perhaps more than anything, Veiga’s work is about a time and place—the first half of the 20th century in Goiás—a version of Brazil that is markedly different from what most English readers are familiar with. The Stanley Graduate Award for International Research would allow me to investigate the many ways that Goiás’ cultural and regional particularities influenced Veiga’s fiction, and would facilitate not only my translation of his work, but future scholarship in order to introduce Veiga to English-speaking audiences.\n\nJasmin Msuya\n\nLinguistic Anthropology/ Anthropology\n\nDestination: Tanzania\n\nProject Title: Archival Collections on Tanzania's Language Policy in Education from 1880s-2000s\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Award for International Research to conduct archival research in two Tanzanian cities, Dar es Salaam, and Iringa, for 11 weeks starting May 23rd and ending August 5th, 2022. The purpose of this research is to collect, analyze, and understand different available documents on educational language policy and indigenous language use during the colonial and post-colonial periods years, the 1880s-the 2000s. Tanzania offers a fascinating case to study language policy across these eras as it is a multilingual country that comprises over 120 tribal languages that co-exist with national languages which are Swahili and English. Despite the diversity of tribal languages, Tanzanians are unified by a common post-colonial national language, Swahili; most people are fluent speakers of Swahili. The current national educational language policy was revised in 2014 by president Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete under a program known as Sera ya Elimu na Mafunzo ya Ufundi (Educational Policy and Vocational Training). Apart from recognizing the use of Swahili, English, and Sign language in education, this policy duplicates problematic linguistic divisions in public schools. At the primary level, Swahili is the language of instruction; English is taught as an academic subject. At the secondary and higher educational levels, English serves as the medium of instruction, whereas Swahili is taught as an academic subject. This language policy imposes a barrier to education and learning proficiency for many Tanzanian youths. Thus, to understand the current education policy, language use, and linguistic controversies, it is important to trace language use and national language policies from the 1880s to the 2000s.\n\nNitya Rayapati\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: India\n\nProject Title: “To Our Mother Telugu”: Linguistic Nationalism in South India\n\nWhat makes someone die for a language? In 1952 Madras (now Chennai), a man named Potti Sreeramulu began a hunger strike for a Telugu-language state. Sreeramulu was one of the first people in modern Indian history to actually starve himself to death. His passing prompted violent riots. Within days the Indian prime minister conceded and created a Telugu state. Andhra Pradesh was the first linguistic state formed in independent India, paving the way for organizing the whole country by linguistic lines. As a graduate student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I’m working on a short story collection exploring how linguistic, cultural, and political identity intersect for members of the Telugu diaspora. My story collection, which will become my M.F.A thesis in fiction, has two key objectives. First, through historically-informed fiction, I imagine the lives of political activists and witnesses during the 1940s movement for a separate Telugu state. Second, I explore the complicated afterlives of this movement with stories about Telugu people today, as they navigate complex relationships to their mother tongues through family relationships, political involvement, and South Indian popular culture. I’m applying for a Stanley Graduate Award to spend four weeks doing archival and experiential research in Hyderabad (the former capital of Andhra Pradesh and current capital of Telangana) and Chennai (the center of the Telugu nationalist movement of the 1940s).\n\nAndres Restrepo Sanchez\n\nAnthropology\n\nDestination: Colombia\n\nProject Title: Obstetric Violence and Sex Work in Medellin, Colombia\n\nObstetric violence is an invisible yet predominant gender-based violence in many countries. Colombia has suffered a particularly violent history that shapes the lives of its population, in which women experience this phenomenon regularly, with a significant incidence in vulnerable groups such as sex workers. This research will use ethnographic theory and methods to understand better how sex workers experience violence within obstetric health to advocate for better practices of humanized care.\n\nLara Dopazo Ruibal\n\nSpanish Creative Writing\n\nDestination: Mexico\n\nProject Title: Non-fiction Project Based on the Life of a Human Rights Defender\n\nFor my proposed Stanley project, I will spend four weeks in Chihuahua and Mexico City, Mexico, interviewing a selected group of people and compiling observations and data for my MFA non-fiction project in Spanish Creative Writing. As part of my fieldwork, I will interview Estela Ángeles Mondragón and travel to the Baqueachi indigenous community. They are the main characters of my project. I will meet experts on Anthropology and Human Rights defenders from the Mexican National Association of Human Rights Defenders (RNDDHM) as well. Through the support of this institution and the Stanley award, I will collect field data, interview specialists, catalog my findings, and revise and draft notes during the period of my grant. The goal of this study is to collect testimonies from Lic. Ángeles and her indigenous collaborators regarding the story of their land; their resistance and the violence they have suffered when defending it. This project will form the backbone of my MFA creative nonfiction thesis. Furthermore, I will seek venues outside of the University of Iowa to publish this work and publicize the crucial work being carried out by these individuals.\n\nClay Scofield\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject Title: Play and Collective Healing: Play in the Reunification of Berlin\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Award for International Research to travel to Berlin, Germany, in June - early July 2022 to complete independent research on the role of play in the ongoing reinvention and healing of the city since post-Cold War reunification in 1990. This research will contribute to my thesis manuscript required for the completion of my MFA degree in 2023. My manuscript is a poetic exploration of play as a transformational practice with potential to heal and liberate. For a brief working definition in this proposal, play is activity done for enjoyment, for its own sake, rather than a practical or productive purpose. I’ve been researching play for many years, through autoethnography, exploratory research through creative practice, field research within intentional artist communities, and archival research. Through autoethnography and exploratory research, I’ve used myself and my life to investigate the potential of play to transform the self and heal trauma. This aspect of the research is deeply internal, embodying what I learn about play and putting play into practice as a core value in my life and creative practice. I use play as a method to write and explore poetry, and I document my lived experiments, performances, and play practices through poetry, essay, and other media. While my own experience of transformation through play forms a deep case study, it’s a necessary expansion of this research to consider how play can transform communities and heal division beyond the individual. I’m interested in studying how to integrate play at the collective level.\n\nOlivia Tse\n\nCreative Writing\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject Title: Collaging Ecopoetry After Berlin Dadaists\n\nI am applying for a Stanley Grant to travel to Berlin and write poetry about buildings that reimagine our future energy consumption. Berlin contains a hub of buildings that are carbon neutral or technologically-equipped to reduce emissions. Over 4 weeks I will visit 3 specific buildings and 1 archive to write poems responding to the visions behind these sites’ architectures. The poems will emphasize the possibilities of sustainable design, borrowing stylistic elements from Raoul Hausmann (1886–1971) and Hannah Höch (1889–1978), Berlin Dadaists and pioneers of collage art. Hausmann was also an experimental poet and I will view both their collage archives, which are available at Höch’s estate. This research is relevant to my MFA thesis in Creative Writing because I am interested in executing poetry that discusses technology and the environment, using visual techniques like collage. My thesis will ask the reader to consider how we reconcile a growth mindset with its environmental and social consequences.\n\nCorinne Watts\n\nAnthropology\n\nDestination: Madrid\n\nProject Title: Fibrolite Axe Sourcing, Trade, and Use in Prehistoric Central Iberia\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Award for International Research to examine the use and distribution of fibrolite stone tools in the Stone Age (Neolithic) and Copper Age (Chalcolithic) in the Madrid province of central Spain (5000-2000 BCE). Fibrolite is a light-colored, durable, and rare mineral used by prehistoric Western European farmers to create small stone tools measuring 2-4 inches long. Prehistoric communities may have used these tools for daily activities such as woodworking and farming, or for religious activities and burials. However, the rarity of fibrolite may mean that these tools also functioned as status symbols for individuals or were traded as valuable goods, similar to amber or ivory. So far, these artifacts have not been studied due to their rarity. Compared to tools made from popular stone materials such as flint, which number in the thousands, fibrolite artifacts have been overlooked despite the role they might have played in the significant cultural changes that resulted from unequal access to resources. From May 25 to July 20, I will work with materials at the two main archaeological collections in Madrid province. These include one hundred stone artifacts held at the Museo Arqueológico Regional (Madrid Regional Archaeology Museum) in Alcalá de Henares, a city northeast of Madrid. Additionally, I will work with fifty-seven stone artifacts held at the Museo de San Isidro (San Isidro Museum) in Madrid.\n\nEbenezer Aidoo\n\nCommunication\n\nDestination: Kenya\n\nProject Title: Mobile technology adoption and use in Africa: Assessing how Kenyans are accepting and using mobile technology in healthcare delivery\n\nThis study seeks to examine how Kenyans are adopting mobile technology in healthcare delivery. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and restrictions on international travel, I will be working remotely for eight (8) weeks with DataDiggers Market Research LLC, to collect data from Kenya. DataDiggers are research experts with research partners in Kenya that can help provide me with the data needed to embark on this research without traveling to Kenya. Using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT; Venkatesh et al., 2003), This pre-dissertation research will prepare me for my dissertation fieldwork as well as contribute to knowledge in the health communication scholarship.\n\nKeren Alfred\n\nBook Arts\n\nDestination: Jamaica\n\nProject Title: Lacebark in Jamaica: Possibilities for Revival and Sustainable Use\n\nMy research will focus on expanding my knowledge of the lacebark tree (Lagetta lagetto) and the role it played in Jamaica. This tree has only been found in Jamaica, Cuba, and Hispaniola (the island divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), however most residents of those islands don’t know of its existence. My broader research goal is to sustainably harvest lacebark (the inner bark of the tree with fibers that can be teased apart to mimic lace), create art with it and to rediscover an aspect of Jamaica’s natural history that many are unaware of. By creating art, I want to learn the traditional methods of preparing and using lacebark and to share my work with other Jamaicans. My research will involve reading articles and books on lacebark (including reading some of the earliest written records of plant life in Jamaica from the 17th and 18th centuries), viewing collections in museums remotely and video calling with experts in the area of lacebark, natural history and textiles in Jamaica.\n\nJulián Bañuelos\n\nCreative Writing/Poetry\n\nDestination: Chile\n\nProject Title: Las Cancioncitas and the Sonnet Through a Bilingual Lens\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Graduate Award to conduct essential research for my thesis, a collection of poetry, in order to graduate with an M.F.A. from the Iowa Writer’s Workshop. The collection of poems is titled, Las Cancioncitas, which will be comprised of sonnets both in English and Spanish. The sonnet is a poetic form that has been around since the thirteenth century via the Italian sonneteers, and even still its appeal has lasted the test of time. Contemporary poets have since pushed the limits of what a sonnet ought to be and do. My collection aims to pay homage, break molds, and tell a love story through the lens of a bilingual being. I will work with two Chilean collections of poetry written in Spanish by Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral. Simultaneously, I will also be examining sonneteers of the English language from past and present.\n\nIlana Bean\n\nNonfiction Writing\n\nDestination: New Zealand\n\nProject Title: Tuatara: The Sole Survivor of the Rhynchocephalia Order\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Award for International Research to research the evolution and conservation of the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), an animal found exclusively in New Zealand. The tuatara is a reptile that superficially resembles a lizard, but, importantly, is not one. Tuataras are the last remaining species from the taxonomic order Rhynchocephalia, a category of reptile that emerged around 200 million years ago, predating dinosaurs. I will investigate breaking research on the tuatara, and how it approaches questions regarding genomic data ownership and Māori perspective in ecology. I will also study the history and impact of tuatara conservation in New Zealand culture and ecosystems, how novel approaches led to the species’ survival, and how this knowledge can be used to combat the loss of biodiversity, both in New Zealand and globally. I will research these questions over a period of six weeks, from June 1st to July 13th. I will examine published papers, conduct interviews, search archives, and engage with physical representations of the tuatara. My background in biology, which includes a biology minor, and upper-level courses in genetics and ecology, informs my approach. This research will culminate in a 6,000 word essay. This will serve as the basis for my MFA thesis during my third year in the Nonfiction Writing Program, which will consist of a series of essays about animal science. This project will take place after my first year of my graduate studies. Because my work is heavily research-based, I will spend the time prior to my thesis conducting research necessary to write scientifically accurate essays.\n\nAdam Beaser\n\nCreative Writing/Fiction\n\nDestination: Hungary\n\nProject Title: Art in Times of Crisis, An Ancestral Study in Hungary\n\nI am an MFA candidate in Fiction at the Writers’ Workshop applying for a Stanley Graduate Award for International Research to spend four weeks conducting international research for a hybrid piece of fiction/non-fiction exploring artistic pursuit in the midst of personal and political upheaval. This will be examined through the lens of my maternal grandfather, who was a prodigy violinist in Hungary but had to escape with his mother as a teen during the Holocaust. My research will focus on the intersection of art and politics particularly in Transylvania, Romania and Budapest, Hungary, including at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, where my maternal grandfather studied violin. Before his death in 2015, my grandfather completed his memoirs of this time and my work will use this document to mix memory, history, and fiction.\n\nAdam Beaser is the winner of a Fulbright Study/Research grant in Creative Writing to Hungary for 2022-23\n\nMadison Bennett\n\nBook Arts\n\nDestination: United Kingdom\n\nProject Title: Ultrathin Parchment Making\n\nIn Western Europe during the Middle Ages, before the advent of paper, scribes wrote on parchment that was so supple and durable, it could be repeatedly scraped down and written on again to create new texts. This process created a palimpsest, a manuscript that contains hidden layers of text. As a lettering artist, I have written on parchment in various ways for nearly a decade. I am fascinated by its unique ability to withstand multiple cycles of writing and scraping. Due to slowed demand over the last several centuries and mystery surrounding its preparation techniques, parchment as thin as the pages of medieval manuscripts is not available in the market today. This summer, I will prepare three calf skins, aiming to replicate the average thinness of a medieval manuscript page based on my own academic research in the University of Iowa’s Special Collections Library and under the guidance of the foremost parchment maker in the US. Ultimately, I will use these three pieces of parchment for my 2022 MFA thesis show, which will explore the concept of a contemporary palimpsest, an art object that contains several hidden layers.\n\nKyle Bikowski\n\nAnthropology\n\nDestination: Mexico\n\nProject Title: Online Performances of Masculinity Among Mexican \"Gaymers\"\n\nMasculinities are changing rapidly in Mexico. Yet little is known about the ways online interactions contribute to this process. This project will use digital ethnographic methods to investigate how Mexican “Gaymers” (gay video game enthusiasts) incorporate local and global ideologies of manhood, Mexicanness and sexuality into online performances of gender. It will reveal how these new ways of being men might challenge some, and reinforce other, hierarchies of manhood, race, and nationality.\n\nRuthwika Bowenpalle\n\nCreative Writing/Fiction\n\nDestination: India\n\nProject Title: Land is Wealth—A history rooted in bonded labor\n\nAlthough monetary wealth is the primary interpretation of wealth and prosperity, land is a source of other types of wealth—the intangible currency tied to one’s heritage, family history, oral traditions, cultural practices as well as theological and societal structures. Societies and individuals have been historically motivated and continue to be motivated by the need to take possession of this land wealth, while simultaneously depriving those belonging to oppressed strata of society of the same right. The outlawed system of ‘vetti-chakiri’ or forced, bonded labor once practiced by feudal landlords in the Telangana region of India deprived the bonded classes of ownership and right to ownership of agricultural land, and therefore the multitudes of wealth(s) associated with land possession. As an MFA student in creative writing, I’m working on a historical novel set in Telangana, India. Set to be my graduate thesis, it explores the relationship between the landed, ancestral aristocrats and the indentured, bonded classes in Telangana’s agrarian regions in the 1950s and 1960s; an exploitative relationship that led eventually to a violent, armed communist struggle known as the Naxalite movement. The novel seeks to hold a mirror to the true natures of truth and humanity, exploring political, generational, and familial realms through the plot of two brothers born into the bonded classes, one of whom joins the Naxalite movement while the other attempts to escape his circumstances through access to educational opportunities. I’m applying for a Stanley Graduate Award for International Research to spend four weeks examining the links between land dispossession and the very human costs on those belonging to the bonded classes, within the context of the Naxalite move\n\nRajorshi Das\n\nEnglish\n\nDestination: India\n\nProject Title: Hierarchies in Publishing: Queer Narratives from India and Bangladesh in Print and Digital Media\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Graduate Award (Fellowship) for International Research to access and experience queer literature emerging out of India and Bangladesh, with a specific focus on transnational publishing platforms in print and digital media. As a second-year PhD candidate in English, this will serve as a step towards writing the research article that is a required component of my comprehensive exam portfolio. This research is to be undertaken over a period of six weeks, between May and June 2021. It involves close reading of scanned copies of manuscripts and letters from the Hoshang Merchant papers, archived at Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University and accessing Dhaka-based digital platforms like Roopbaan magazine and Oboyob Diversity Circle oral history project. Merchant had edited India’s first gay anthology, Yaraana: Gay Writing from India (1999) which was published by Penguin Random House. In contrast to the visibility of Indian queer literatures in English that have found an international reading market, Bangladeshi queer writers and activists have been relying on digital platforms to create alternate spaces of storytelling in Bangla. In order to understand the regional and linguistic hierarchies of such literary productions in the two countries, I shall interview Merchant, Akhil Katyal, Joya Sikdar, and other activist-artists associated with such platforms. By doing so, I hope to set the ground for my doctoral research around the possibilities and limitations of queer narratives in South Asia.\n\nReid Dempsey\n\nLiterary Translation\n\nDestination: Germany\n\nProject Title: Translating Saša Staniši's Fallensteller (Trappers)\n\nThere is a tradition of multilingual writers from Henry James to Franz Kafka, Joseph Conrad to Orhan Pamuk who have chosen to write monolingually. As part of my MFA degree in Literary Translation, I am applying for Stanley funds to continue my research and translation of another such writer, the contemporary Bosnian-German novelist Saša Staniši. Staniši, now a citizen of Germany and the EU, was a refugee of the Yugoslav Wars and acquired German as a second language. Today he publishes only in that language, including his recent memoir Herkunft (Origins), winner of the 2019 German Book Prize. As a translator of Staniši, understanding the political and aesthetic significance of his decision to present a minority perspective in a majority language is of the utmost importance. Stanley funds would allow me to conduct remote research in international archives dedicated to migrant Yugoslavian experience in the summer of 2021 while continuing my translation of Staniši. The primary product of this proposal is a fifteen-page critical foreword to accompany my MFA thesis, a translation of Staniši’s 2016 short story collection Fallensteller (Trappers), a series of interlaced tales of contemporary multicultural Europe. This critical foreword is a required component of my thesis, and for readers it would contextualize Staniši and his language(s) in the history of Balkan migration to Germany; it would also allow me to critically interpret his work through a lens of multilingualism and language politics in the EU.\n\nMichaeljulius Idani\n\nCreative Writing/Fiction\n\nDestination: Sierra Leone\n\nProject Title: Unsettled Resettlement: The Lives of the Krio in Sierra Leone\n\nThe Stanley Graduate Award for International Research will afford me one month to conduct research focused on the lives of liberated Africans from around the world that were disposed in the Crown colony of Freetown, Sierra Leone after the British Empire abolished the Atlantic Slave trade in 1807. The liberated Africans that arrived in Freetown spoke different languages, worshipped different Gods, and practiced different customs, but quickly melded into a new people with a shared language called Krio. I will utilize the Liberated Africans Project, a free digitized repository of historical documents made available by a consortium of governments and research institutes, to learn about the history of the Krio people. This research will form the primary resources essential to my in-progress collection of short stories that will comprise my MFA thesis in fiction at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, where I am currently a first-year student.\n\nRachael Maxon\n\nArt History\n\nDestination: Iran\n\nProject Title: The Forgotten Archaeologists of Susa\n\nIn 1897, Jacques de Morgan and his team under the auspices of the French government began the systematic archaeological excavation of Susa, Iran. The excavation report published in the early 20th century describes only the quantifiable data regarding the rediscovery of some of the most notable works of Near Eastern art including the Hammurabi Code Stele, and the Stele of Naram-Sin. While the excavated objects themselves have made it to museums across the globe, the majority of the maps, photographs, personal notes, and correspondences of early archaeologists like Jacques de Morgan and Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy are left out of these early reports. By removing these individuals from the narrative of the object, we are left with only part of its history, tantamount to divorcing the object from its context which drastically impacts our reading and understanding of the object in all respects. This project seeks to reintegrate the archaeologist into the history of the object and the site of Susa through the translation and analysis of the primary source material housed in the Bibliotheque nationale de France and the Academie de Beaux-Art that was not included in the archaeological reports. By reintroducing this material, the letters, notes, correspondences and other documents not fit for the official reports from Susa, we can better understand the objects themselves as well as their impact on Near Eastern art history and art collecting.\n\nMcKenzie Toma\n\nCreative Writing/Poetry\n\nDestination: Romania\n\nProject Title: Romanian Poet Ion Negoiţescu and Queer Literary Censorship in Communist Romania\n\nI am applying for The Stanley Award for International Research to study the work and life of Romanian writer Ion Negoiţescu (1921-1993), one of the few openly gay male writers active in Romania during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu (1965-1989). As an MFA candidate in the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, this research will inform my thesis, a 60 page collection of poetry. Being a queer writer with Romanian heritage myself, my thesis will explore the history of dissidence, censorship and queerness as a form of political resistance, and be written in prose, free verse, and couplets. The anti-fascist nature of the poetry of Ion Negoiţescu coupled with him being openly gay resulted in his censorship, arrests, and imprisonment by Ceaușescu. By researching what, why, and how Negoiţescu wrote during this oppressive era, I will have an historically informed framework from which to write this collection of poems. I plan to use the digitized public archives at the Open Society Archives (OSA) at Central European University in Budapest, Hungary to do my research over the course of six weeks. This large repository of publicly accessible documents features Radio Free Europe (RFE) “Information Items” and “Situation Reports” describing the activism of this writer, the conditions of Jilavia Prison where Negoiţescu was held, and the state of literature and life in Romania during the rule of Ceaușescu.\n\nJulia Wohlstetter\n\nCreative Writing/Poetry\n\nDestination: France\n\nProject Title: Tracing Chris Marker's Epistolary Mode\n\nI am a first year MFA student in the Writer’s Workshop applying for a Stanley Fellowship for International Research in order to spend four weeks researching the French cinematic essayist and audio-visual poet Chris Marker. Using Marker’s films as a point of departure, I will write a cycle of poems addressing the relationship between memory, time and the poem as archive. I will focus on such acclaimed master works as \"Sans Soleil\", \"Le fond de l’air est rouge\", \"Si j’avais quatre dromedaires\", \"Loin du Vietnam\", \"Lettre de Siberie\", and \"Le joli mai\", seeking to broaden my understanding of Marker’s epistolary approach to cinema, and assimilating material to be included in the poetry cycle I compose. I will also integrate my research into my MFA poetry thesis, exploring the emergence and flowering of documentary poetics in the twentieth century.\n\nZhen Zhang\n\nArt History\n\nDestination: China\n\nProject Title: Research on the Catalog of Southern Song Academic Painting\n\nMy project critically assesses the Catalog of Southern Song Academic Painting (Nansong yuanhua lu, hereafter CSSAP), a Chinese art catalog from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), edited by a member of literati, Li E (1692-1752). The CSSAP is of tremendous historical importance because it is perhaps the most comprehensive early primary source to describe academic painting from the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) in China. However, my project argues that many of the citations in the CSSAP are problematic. I show that in numerous cases Li E misquoted or intentionally altered the original sources he cited, resulting in the misinterpretations of those sources. Moreover, I demonstrate that Li E cited a number of other highly questionable sources, some of which might even be fabricated. Different from other art catalogs from that time, the CSSAP showed its preference to academic painting, paintings produced in the imperial painting academy, although this style was deemed to have lesser artistic value than literati painting, paintings created by scholar-amateur artists. By conducting a close reading of this book, I examine to what extent the CSSAP challenged the canon of Qing art and why it deviated from the mainstream at that time.\n\nHao Zhou\n\nCinematic Arts\n\nDestination: Taiwan\n\nProject Title: Moving Images: LGBTQ+ Taiwan\n\nI propose to make a short-form film essay/documentary that explores Taiwan’s queer cinema of the past two decades. Consisting of film montages, interviews, and my narration, the film will make thematic connections among Taiwanese LGBTQ+ films, with a focus on queered notions of East Asian family, sexuality, gender, and politics. For the visual component, I will make montages of 10-15 Taiwanese LGBTQ+ films. These montages will be intercut with footage related to LGBTQ+ social developments in Taiwan as well as virtual interviews that I will conduct with relevant artists, activists, and scholars. I will carry out this project with guidance and participation from various (already secured) collaborators, such as the Taiwan International Queer Film Festival. The film’s aesthetic and scholarly development will be guided by faculty at UIowa’s Department of Cinematic Arts and the film scholar Dr. Chang-min Yu and colleagues at National Taiwan University. After completing the project, I will share the film via multiple platforms and institutions, including festivals, LGBTQ+ NGOs, universities, and streaming websites.\n\nEbenezer Olamiposi Adeyemi\n\nAnthropology\n\nDestination: Lagos State, Nigeria\n\nProject Title: Health Care, Coping, and Malaria in Makoko, Nigeria\n\nI am applying for the Stanley Graduate Award for International Research to undertake eight (8) weeks of research, from June 1 to July 20, 2020 in Makoko, Lagos State, Southwestern Nigeria. The research will focus on the malaria epidemic in Makoko, specifically the coping strategies that people employ to access health care despite limited resources and a lack of government services. Makoko is arguably the largest shack settlement in Lagos State, Nigeria and has faced a malaria epidemic for over one hundred years. Life in Makoko is characterized by a lack of safe and hygienic water, paved roads, waste disposal systems, public hospitals, and government services. Due to the foregoing factors, Makoko residents are prone to infectious diseases including malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea. The Nigerian malaria epidemic has long served as a point of interest for my research given its scope and social impact. According to the World Health Organization Malaria report (2019), Nigeria accounts for (25%) of malaria infection and death globally, making the country the most affected in the world. My earlier research on the Nigerian malaria epidemic focused on the causes of malaria in Southwestern Nigeria. My current interest in the coping strategies employed to deal with malaria was piqued by my self-sponsored preliminary visit to Makoko during the 2019-20 winter break. Through interactions with Makoko residents, I established that malaria is the most common and widespread health issue in the community. However, while the current literature details several factors that leave communities like Makoko susceptible to malaria, there is a discernible absence of literature that analyzes the mechanisms that people adopt to cope with malaria’s effects. My research will address this gap in the literature through long-term fieldwork on the dynamics of health and inequality in Makoko.\n\nAnthony Capparelli\n\nMusical Arts\n\nDestination: Berlin, Germany\n\nProject Title: An Immersive Approach to Understanding Repetiteurship\n\nIn the changing world, the career path of a piano performance major can unfold in a number of ways, frequently including a smattering of freelance work. One such path is that of the vocal collaborative pianist, opera coach, and répétiteur. However, the standard performance degree does not necessarily prepare a pianist with the tools needed to be successful in this specialized line of work, and many piano students might not stumble on this career until later in their growth as a musician. For my Stanley research, I will spend 8 weeks in Berlin, Germany, a city and country where opera is thriving, as a répétiteur apprentice for the Berlin Opera Academy. I will work in all levels of the opera house, assist the conductor and director in preparing two full operas, study diction and coaching practices, and experience the full immersion of the role as a rehearsal pianist in Europe. The purpose of this fieldwork is to better understand the répétiteur skillset, the differences and expectations in a European as opposed to an American setting, and to one day develop curriculum and pedagogical tools to assist my future students who might hope to pursue this line of work.\n\nJulia Conrad\n\nLiterary Translation\n\nDestination: Pavia, Italy; Otranto, Italy\n\nProject Title: Translating Maria Corti's Siren Song (Canto delle Sirene)\n\nMany U.S. readers are familiar with Italo Calvino, Umberto Eco, or Nobel-winning poet Eugenio Montale, yet their contemporary Maria Corti, one of Italy’s most important intellectuals and writers, is relatively unknown in the United States. This fact has largely to do with much of her work being unavailable in English. For my MFA thesis in Literary Translation, I am translating what is considered to be Corti’s best literary work, Siren Song (Canto delle Sirene), a novel about intellectual seduction. I am applying for a Stanley Graduate Award in International Research to spend six weeks in Italy, visiting the archive in Pavia that Corti herself founded to study the original manuscript and drafts of the novel, as well as the Salento region of Puglia, where part of the novel is set, and whose landmarks and specific regional dialects would be essential to the translation.\n\nNatalie Dawson\n\nFiction\n\nDestination: United Kingdom\n\nProject Title: The Third Window: Examining the Anchorites’ Renunciant Dream\n\nI am a graduate student pursuing an MFA in fiction at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. I am applying for the Stanley Award in order to conduct research in the United Kingdom on the women anchorites of the Middle Ages, whose self-imposed isolation was so extreme that they held living funerals, complete with burial rites, before being locked away in a single room for the rest of their lives. This research will form the foundation for a significant portion of my MFA thesis, a collection of works about women who reject the social mandate of caretaking.\n\nEliot Duncan\n\nFiction\n\nDestination: Berlin, Germany\n\nProject Title: No Future : Looking For Boyhood, Transmasculine Identities in Weimar Germany\n\nMy research will unearth histories of transmasculine identities in Weimar Germany. I will do in extensive archival research at the Schwules Museum's (queer history museum's) archive. The era, 1919-33, is famous for gay freedom for cis men and women. The era is also known for the beginnings of trans liberation and medicalization via Magnus Herschfeld and his clinic. However, there r"
