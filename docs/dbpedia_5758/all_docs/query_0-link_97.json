        "text": "Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi concludes his analysis of tragedy in late capitalism with a bold call to arms: post-liberal dystopia must be faced and dissolved by irony. He argues for a renewed ironic autonomy, which emphasises the independence of mind from knowledge and the excessive nature of the imagination. Developing Berardi’s argument, I suggest there are three obstacles to theorising irony as a form of politics. The first is that a politics of irony is often accused of being either a fraudulent or amoral form of politics, which has itself allowed a post-liberal malaise to fester and grow. The second problem is that irony may no longer be simply an ambivalent tool of critique from the edges of political discourse, but instead a tool which perpetuates its very centre. The third problem is that theorising the performance and place of irony in relation to political critique often results in a slippage from the complexity of the second problem to the impasse of the first. I argue that Berardi’s ‘ironic autonomy’ is entirely possible, so long as the politics of irony is understood as depending on the different forms and media of interpretative space through which contemporary politics takes place.\n\nThis international meeting aims at exploring the many senses of irony as a rhetoric figure and existential tone, and its relevance for the study of social and political experience. During four days, scholars form various fields in the Humanities (Philosophy, Cultural and Literary Criticism, History of Ideas, Psychoanalysis) will be debating on the many ways to understand irony and its meaning in different historical periods. From Antiquity and Renaissance to Modernity and Postmodernity…and beyond. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, Hegel, Kierkegaard, William (and Henry) James, Freud, Leo Strauss, Vlastos, Nehamas, Derrida Rorty and Lear will be revisited on the issue of irony, but also earlier and modern classics like Cervantes, Montaigne, and Shakespeare, and contemporary writers as Penelope Fitzgerald and Nabokov, Pynchon and Foster Wallace, Kundera and Piglia. Irony seems contrary to sincerity, engagement, truthfulness and the justification for each one’s way of life and beliefs; but irony has also to do with self-examination, caring and tolerance needed to live a life with less violence and cruelty. These topics will open further discussions on some decisive drifts in the political sensitivity and thinking since the 1990s. What happened to the ironic, yet socialdemocratic committed citizen that Richard Rorty so highly praised? Why did such a Neo-Nietzschean as Sloterdijk want to paint the rortyan democrat as the successor of Nietzsche's “last man”? What is the difference between cynicism à la Baudrillard and the new political sensibilities? How does Žižek really distinguish between irony, sarcasm and cynicism? Can we still be ironic in our time –a time of destruction, endless violence and permanent horror? Should we vindicate the virtue of irony over again? Or should we rather say farewell to irony? We will have the special participation of Professor Richard J. Bernstein (New School for Social Research in New York), among whose books there are titles as influential as Hannah Arendt and the Jewish Question (1996) Freud and the Legacy of Moses (1998), Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation (2002), The Abuse of Evil: The Corruption of Politics and Religion since 9/11 (2006) and most recently Reflections on Violence. Thinking Without Bannisters (2013). Professor Bernstein will give a special lecture on the actuality of Socratic irony and the art of living, He will also contribute with a presentation on his departed friend Richard Rorty and Jonathan Lear’s A Case for Irony. He is currently preparing a new book on the idea of irony in the philosophical tradition. Sponsored by Marcos de entendimiento.

López (UNED) and J. Infante (UNED-UC3M) Information: almalopez@bec.uned.es\n\nThe present study discusses several pragmatic and cognitive views on irony and hyperbole while paying special heed to concepts such as pretense, interpretive resemblance, relevant inappropriateness and non-veridicality. The role played by irony and hyperbole within networks of face-threatening acts and facework-related strategies such as those displayed by sitcom dialogues will be illustrated. 1. Aim of the present study This study is intended as a critical evaluation of contemporary views on irony and hyperbole in the light of both pragmatic concepts and cognitive notions, with particular emphasis laid on concepts such as pretense, the use/mention distinction, relevant inappropriateness and non-veridicality. Once overlappings and dissimilarities between various accounts have been discussed, the implications of both irony and hyperbole upon politeness phenomena such as face-threatening acts and facework-related strategies will be illustrated by analysing several conversations from sitcom dialogues. 2. On verbal and situational irony The present discussion will start by stressing the clear-cut distinction between verbal irony, a linguistic phenomenon defined as the strategy of using incongruity between reality and expectation, and situational irony, a state of the world which is perceived as ironical (Gibbs 1994). With verbal irony, the speaker intentionally creates a juxtaposition of incompatible actions or words, while situational irony unveils events which are ironic irrespective of the speaker's implication. Awareness of a discrepancy between expectation and reality reveals that irony is not a matter of language but of thought, a fundamental pattern in the workings of the human mind (Gibbs 1994: 365). In his 'Concept of Irony' Kierkegaard regards it as all-pervasive and therefore representative of human nature: \" As philosophers claim that no true philosophy is possible without doubt, by the same token, one may claim that no authentic human life is possible without irony \" (Keirkegaard in Gibbs 1994: 363). Famous examples of situational irony testify to the presence of an ironical mode of thought: thus, the man who invented the guillotine was beheaded by it; the man who built the Bastille was imprisoned in it; the bishop who invented the iron cage was the first to be confined in it. While verbal irony may be intended, a speaker cannot deliberately do something ironic:\n\nIn his pioneering work,A Case for Irony(2011) Johnathan Lear has advanced a powerful and novel case in support of Søren Kierkegaard&#39;s striking thesis that “no genuinely human life is possible without irony.” Lear can be credited for attempting to show not only that irony can play a positive role in living a genuinely human life, but that the role played by irony is genuinely distinctive. However, in this paper, I argue that Lear&#39;s use of psychoanalytic theory in making his case for irony is problematic; and I demonstrate that Kierkegaard&#39;s own writings contain resources to provide a stronger defense of the stated thesis. In this way, I aim to provide a critical defense of Lear&#39;s case for irony by arguing for a return to Kierkegaard in place of psychoanalysis. On my Kierkegaard‐inspired account, the experience of irony erupts as a disciplinary force in cases where an individual&#39;s concrete, practical deliberation has been substituted or “swallowed up” by disinteres..."
