        "text": "In January, Uno-X Mobility was thrilled to receive another invitation to the Tour de France. Today, we proudly present the riders of the Norwegian-Danish team who will participate in the world's largest annual sporting event. When the cycling race kicks off in Florence, Italy, on June 29, we aim to secure a stage victory in this year's race.\n\nThe team has delivered a series of strong results so far this season, and Magnus Cort's recent stage victory in the Critérium du Dauphiné was an impressive achievement. This was the team's first World Tour victory, and racing in the yellow leader's jersey added an extra dimension to the event. As we shift our focus to this year's major highlight, the Tour de France, we are confident in our strong team.\n\n\"The team was well noticed during last year's Tour de France, achieving 11 top-ten finishes. We have now assembled a team that we believe can take another step up from last year,\" says General Manager of Uno-X Mobility, Thor Hushovd.\n\nSeveral Qualified Riders\n\nA number of riders have shown great riding strength and delivered good results this season. The team has also strengthened its position as the third-best Pro Team in the world. Some riders have been a given for a while, while others have earned their place on the team in the past few weeks.\n\n\"Our focus in the team selection has been to find a good combination of lead-out skills, climbing skills, and general riding strength. The riders we have selected complement each other very well, and I am confident that we will make our mark on several stages throughout the race,\" says Hushovd.\n\nAlexander Kristoff delivers again with a series of victories, approaching his one-hundredth professional career win. His convincing performances prove that he is still a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\"We will continue to build the team around the biggest Norwegian and Danish profiles, and it is therefore really nice that we have both Magnus Cort and Alexander Kristoff on this year's team,\" says Hushovd.\n\nSeveral riders in top form\n\nAmong the more obvious selections is Jonas Abrahamsen. He has taken major steps this season, and the victory in Brussels Cycling Classic at the beginning of June was a remarkable performance.\n\nSøren Wærenskjold impressed again in Paris-Roubaix in April, and he has since shown steadily improving form. His overall victory in the Baloise Belgium Tour last weekend is a very good indication of this.\n\nInjuries have created uncertainty\n\nThe team's leader in the mountains during last year's race, Tobias Halland Johannessen, has had a challenging build-up to this year's Tour. The rider from Drøbak, Norway, had a bad crash at the start of the season and had to spend many weeks in alternative training. He made a strong comeback in La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, but another crash in the latter race caused new injury issues. Halland Johannessen is now back in good form and is a rider who can make a significant impact, especially in the latter part of the Tour de France.\n\nThe young talent Johannes Kulset (20) is among the greatest climbing talents Norway has seen. Kulset delivers impressive numbers, and despite his young age, he has been one of the team's best climbers over time. During the team's altitude training camp in Sierra Nevada, the rider from Oslo suffered a bad crash, casting doubt on his ability to return in time for this year's major highlight. However, Kulset has impressively fought his way back, and he is a rider we look forward to following on this year's mountain stages.\n\nStrong riding skills and experience complete the team\n\nRasmus Fossum Tiller has again proven himself as one of the team's strongest riders throughout the spring season. Tiller will play an important role in the lead-out on flat stages, while there are also stages that suit him well. The ninth stage with 14 gravel sectors is an example of this.\n\nOdd Christian Eiking came to Uno-X Mobility late before this season. With his many years of experience as a professional rider and good climbing skills, he will be an important contributor to the team.\n\nThree reserves have been selected in addition to the mentioned riders. The reserves are listed in no particular order and will be evaluated based on the rider to be replaced.\n\nPositive and proactive team owner\n\nUno-X Mobility Cycling is part of Reitan Retail, in which Ole Robert Reitan is CEO and co-owner. This year, he is even more closely involved in the cycling initiative, as chairman of the operating company behind the team.\n\n\"The sporting results in the spring season show that Uno-X Mobility belongs on the biggest stage in cycling. We are ready to show the world what we are made of, and I am really looking forward to following this year's Tour de France,\" he says.\n\nReitan emphasizes that the cycling initiative is an integral part of the business strategy at Reitan Retail.\n\n\"The cycling initiative is a symbol of the transformation we are undergoing, towards a forward-looking player that facilitates more sustainable choices – at home, on the go, and along the road. Just as we have shifted gears and are fully committed to electrification of both the passenger car market and the heavy-duty vehicle market, the cycling team has also taken a new sporting step. The goal is undoubtedly that we will stand on the top of the podium in at least one stage of the Tour de France this year,\" he says.\n\nUno-X Mobility in Tour de France 2024\n\nMagnus Cort (DEN)\n\nAlexander Kristoff (NOR)\n\nSøren Wærenskjold (NOR)\n\nJonas Abrahamsen (NOR)\n\nTobias Halland Johannessen (NOR)\n\nJohannes Kulset (NOR)\n\nRasmus Fossum Tiller (NOR)\n\nOdd Christian Eiking (NOR)\n\nReserves\n\nMarkus Hoelgaard (NOR)\n\nAnders Skaarseth (NOR)\n\nAndreas Leknessund (NOR)"
