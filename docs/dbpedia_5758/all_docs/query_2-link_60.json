From Italian troops invading the Stone Age people of Abyssinia, to Adolf Hitler’s mechanised Blitzkriegs and America’s atomic bombing of Japan, it also charts the major developments of twentieth-century warfare. This was the first truly ‘world war’, with combat touching most continents. The principal theatres of war were Europe, Asia and the Mediterranean (including the North African coast, Greece and the Balkans) and the war on the Eastern Front in Russia – the campaign that ensured Hitler’s grand designs were ruined. Germany’s war with Russia was a massive conflict, where the fighting was on a larger, more ferocious scale, the distances were greater and the troop casualties higher than in any other area of the conflict. When Eagles Dared is a salute to the men and women who participated in the war and the filmmakers who have immortalised their stories on screen. Each chapter discusses a theatre of war, an event, a campaign or battle, by explaining the historical background and then examines how filmmakers have depicted these events. Also in each chapter there is a ‘focus film’ which best represents the chapter’s subject, though many further films are analysed within this format. To take one example, the chapter discussing the ‘War Behind the Wire’ focuses on The Great Escape (1963), the most famous and successful WWII prisoner of war film, but also discusses many other examples, from The Wooden Horse (1950) to Escape to Victory (1981). The selections are not restricted to American or British depictions of the war and throughout the book you will find films oﬀering Italian, German, French, Japanese, Yugoslavian, Algerian and Russian perceptions of the conflict. Some films I discuss are famous, highly regarded and successful, while others are less so. All oﬀer interesting perspectives on the conflict, as these storytellers brought history to life onscreen, however accurately. I imagine that almost all participants in WWII would agree that there has never been a movie made that has completely expressed the ‘Hell on Earth’ of combat.\n\nHowardHughes_Prelims.indd Sec1:ix\n\n12/20/2011 5:27:27 PM\n\nx\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nThere is no real way to fully convey the sensory experience of war – the smell of burning flesh, the acrid smoke, the screams, the noise, the blood, the fear. WWII films have mirrored changing times and public tastes. During the war itself, films tended to be propagandist ‘message’ stories, designed to lift the nation’s spirits. In Britain’s case this included such films as The Lion Has Wings, Went the Day Well?, The Way Ahead, We Dive at Dawn and In Which We Serve and Hollywood produced Back to Bataan, Casablanca, G.I. Joe, Mrs Miniver, Guadalcanal Diary, Objective, Burma!, Immortal Sergeant and They Were Expendable. When the war ended, audiences demanded escapism, adventures which fed the imagination but gradually drifted further from the truth. In Britain audiences flocked to The Colditz Story, The Dam Busters, Ice Cold in Alex, Dunkirk, Reach for the Sky and The Cockleshell Heroes, while in America Flying Leathernecks, From Here to Eternity, To Hell and Back and Stalag 17 were typical 1950s war fare. The beginning of the 1960s marked the emergence of the all-star international war epic, part of a trend that saw cinema reacting to the threat posed by television. This resulted in the release of widescreen spectacles such as The Guns of Navarone, The Longest Day, The Great Escape and Where Eagles Dare. There were war film comedies (Kelly’s Heroes) and cynical, violent action movies (The Dirty Dozen). From the late 1970s onwards there has been a renewed attempt to bring authentically grimy realism to WWII films, from Cross of Iron, The Big Red One and The Boat (Das Boot) to Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line and Letters from Iwo Jima. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, as the war fades ever further from memory, filmmakers have made films both in the ultra-cynical style of The Dirty Dozen – as\n\nDouglas Bader (Kenneth More) returns from a sortie in Lewis Gilbert’s popular screen biography of the WWII RAF hero, Reach for the Sky (1956).

WWII films fall into four broad subgenres. The first is travelogue war movies, which follow a character or group of characters through the historical events of the war. These films include To Hell and Back, The Victors, The Big Red One and Saving Private Ryan, and also biopics such as Patton, MacArthur and The Desert Fox. The second is re-enactments of historical events, usually deploying star names in the principal roles. Key examples of this category include The Longest Day, Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, Sink the Bismarck!, A Bridge Too Far, The Battle on the River Neretva, Tora! Tora! Tora! and Battle of the Bulge. These films provide accurate depictions of historical events – often at great expense – with realistic drama, good stories and largely convincing performances. The third category is adventure movies, usually depicting a special mission, with scant regard for historical accuracy but plenty of action. Here the war is an excuse for larger-than-life heroism and explosive special eﬀects. Good examples of this type include The Guns of Navarone, The Dirty Dozen, Where Eagles Dare, The Heroes of Telemark, Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, Von Ryan’s Express, Objective, Burma!, The Dirty Heroes, Eagles Over London, The Eagle Has Landed, The Secret Invasion, Kelly’s Heroes and Enzo G. Castellari’s The Inglorious Bastards. The Great Escape falls into this category also. Though it is loosely based on fact, it takes many liberties with history. War films of this type predominantly present a comic-book history of World War II. Having ‘Eagles’ or ‘Heroes’ in the title seems to help too. The fourth category is dramas that use the war as a backdrop to the story, such as Ice Cold in Alex, The Boat, The Star and The Bridge on the River Kwai.\n\nOn-set publicity shot depicting men on a mission and their target: the Navarone guns.

Several Hollywood directors worked as documentary filmmakers during the war: for example, John Ford led a documentary crew for the US Navy in the Pacific War and George Stevens’ unit covered the European theatre. Many actors served their country’s armed forces during the conflict. Dirk Bogarde was a captain with Lieutenant General Frederick Browning in Normandy and Arnhem – he went on to play Browning in A Bridge Too Far. Henry Fonda enlisted in the US Navy and served on Admiral Nimitz’s flagship USS Essex and later portrayed Nimitz for In Harm’s Way and Midway. James Stewart served in the US Air Force and by 1945 had risen to the rank of colonel. Before he became a film star, Richard Todd was a lieutenant in the British 6th Airborne Division during the attack on the Orne River Bridge on D-Day and later played his paratroop commander Major Howard in The Longest Day. Hollywood star David Niven became a lieutenant with the commandos and was granted leave (termed ‘special duty’) to appear in two wartime propaganda films: The First of the Few (1942) and The Way Ahead (1944). While these ‘reel heroes’ were becoming real heroes, other actors remained in Hollywood. John Wayne became a star in Ford’s Stagecoach (1939) and went on to appear in many patriotic war movies to keep wartime spirits up, but didn’t see combat himself. The first Hollywood actor to be killed on active service was 1930s star Phillips Holmes, who was in the Canadian Air Force and died in 1942. Leslie Howard, the director-producerstar of First of the Few, which depicted the invention of the Spitfire, was shot down in 1943 by German planes on his way back to London from Lisbon. The Germans reputedly thought they had killed Winston Churchill. When Eagles Dared is also about the millions of people – from many nations – who fought and died during World War II. For me this was a recent war. I grew up in the Cheshire village of Churton. In the 1970s I remember elderly uncles (it was always uncles) recounting their experiences of the war, or showing me faded photographs of their younger selves in uniform, posing with an array of smiling comrades-in-arms in front of army vehicles. During the war, members of my family enlisted in the Farndon Platoon, ‘B’ Company, 5th Cheshire Battalion of the Home Guard. Formerly the Local Defence Volunteers, this countrywide home defence against German invasion was the inspiration for the TV show Dad’s Army. My grandfather William Hughes, who was a lieutenant in the Home Guard, was put in charge of ‘stores and uniforms’ and the company’s headquarters was his house, ‘Holly Bush’ in Farndon. My other grandfather Philip Steel served in Malpas Auxiliary Fire Brigade and other relatives and family friends served in Burma, North Africa, landed on D-Day and fought through Italy and France. In Farndon churchyard stands a cenotaph, inscribed with 23 names: 18 men who died in the Great War (1914–18), five in World War II (1939–45). The names aren’t famous, but this war memorial stands as a symbol of the village’s loss, ‘In perpetual memory of those men who died for their country’. These wars touched every family and every village cenotaph tells its own story – its little piece of history – of forgotten heroes, remembered once a year. ‘When you go home, tell them of us and say: “For your tomorrow, we give our today”’.\n\nHowardHughes_Prelims.indd Sec1:xii\n\n12/20/2011 5:27:30 PM\n\nWAR AND REMEMBRANCE\n\nxiii\n\nWar memorial in St Chad’s church, Farndon, Cheshire.

The right-wing Nazi Party’s emergence coincided with Germany’s economic depression in the 1930s. Hitler joined the Nazi Party – the National Socialist German Worker’s Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP) – after serving in the Great War. Voters became intoxicated by the party’s ideals for a new, greater Germany – the Third Reich (empire) – and the party won seats in parliament, the Reichstag. The First Reich was the Holy Roman Empire, the second was the German Empire of 1871–1918. The Third Reich rose out of the Weimar Republic (as Germany was known after World War I) in 1933 and lasted until 1945. Many Germans gravitated towards Nazism to counter a perceived threat from communism, while there were those factions in German society who blamed the Jews (Juden in German) for the country’s defeat and compromised position in Europe after World War I. Hitler became Reich Chancellor (prime minister) in 1933 and then, following the death of Germany’s President Von Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, he became all-powerful Führer (‘leader’). Germany was by now a police state and the Nazi Party ruthlessly persecuted its political opponents and social victims – especially the Jewish population. Pre-war anti-Semitic purges reached a crescendo on 9–10 November 1938, the notorious Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), when 7,000 Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed across Nazi Germany and between 25,000 and 30,000 Jews were transported to concentration camps. By 1941, Hitler and his collaborators concocted the ‘Final Solution’ to remove all Jews from Europe. The rise of National Socialism in Germany has been depicted on film in The Hitler Gang (1944 – with Robert Watson as Hitler), The German Story (1956 – You and Other Comrades), Mein Kampf (1960), The Life of Adolf Hitler (1961), Hitler (1962 – with Richard Baseheart as Hitler), The Black Fox (1961 – narrated\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 1\n\n12/20/2011 12:42:59 PM\n\n2\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nby Marlene Dietrich), The Double-headed Eagle, its sequel Swastika (both 1973), and Fred Zinnemann’s Julia (1977), starring Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave and Jason Robards. Edgar Reitz’s West German TV series Heimat (1984) depicted life in the ‘Homeland’ between 1919 and 1980 and Volker Schlöndorﬀ ’s unsettling Best Foreign Film Oscar winner The Tin Drum (1979), adapted from the novel by Günter Grass, was set against the Nazis’ rise to power. The November 1918 Armistice – which ended the ‘War to End All Wars’ – and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles resulted in Germany losing territory. Germany was also prohibited from building an army of any strength. When he became Führer, Hitler promptly ignored the Treaty of Versailles’ restrictions. He cut unemployment by carrying out huge construction projects, infrastructure improvements (including extensive road building) and in 1935 a programme of rearmament. The chassis for the first two marks of the famed German Panzer tanks, for example, were disguised as agricultural tractors to bypass the treaty’s restrictions. The reorganised German armed forces, the Wehrmacht, included the mechanised Panzergrenadiers, which would be key to the German strategy at the outset of war in Europe, when they deployed ground troops, bombardments and air assaults in swift-striking Blitzkrieg attacks. Hitler became security conscious as his national and global profile grew. This is exemplified by his increasingly bomb- and bullet-proof chauﬀer-driven Mercedes cars which he travelled in for public appearances. The black-uniformed Schutzstaﬀeln (SS protection squads) originated as Hitler’s personal bodyguards. The SS incorporated its military wing, the elite Waﬀen-SS and the Gestapo (the Geheime Staatspolizei, or State Secret Police). The SS became known for their fanatical Nazism and brutality, and their ‘Death’s Head’ units ran the concentration camps, which were established soon after the Nazis rise to power in 1933. These were political prison camps in Germany – Dachau (near Munich) and Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald (northeast of Frankfurt) – where opponents of the Nazi party were tortured and starved. Every German soldier’s belt buckle bore the inscription ‘Gott Mit Uns’, reminding them always that God was on their side in Hitler’s anti-Semitic, anti-communistic war. The most famous symbols of Nazism were the swastika emblem (the hooked cross, originally an Indian symbol which was hijacked by Hitler) and the Heil Hitler salute, the so-called ‘Hitler greeting’ of the Nazi Party, with the right arm extended. This was thought to have originated in ancient Rome – the ‘Hail Caesar’ that is seen so often onscreen in sword and sandal epics. The Italian Nationalists, in particular Gabriele D’Annunzio, allied the salutation to their extreme politics. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini later decreed that it should be used instead of a handshake and the German Nazi party made the salute compulsory in 1926. It will always be associated with Hitler’s massive Nuremberg rallies in 1934, which were captured in the powerful propaganda film, Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will (1935). Hitler annexed neighbouring land to allow Germany Lebensraum – ‘Living Room’ or ‘Living Space’ (literally room to live). He had seen how since World War I Germany had trailed other European powers, principally Britain and France, who owned and exploited territories abroad. Hitler’s obvious intentions for German expansion were countered by a policy of ‘Appeasement’ by France\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 2\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\nBEFORE THE BLITZKRIEG\n\n3\n\nand Britain, as they tried to avoid war. German troops occupied the Rhineland adjacent to France in March 1936 and took Austria in March 1938, in the socalled Anschluss. The occupation of Austria by Nazi troops features prominently in Robert Wise’s musical The Sound of Music (1965). Hitler and Neville Chamberlain, the conservative prime minister of Britain, held a summit in Munich in September 1938 to discuss Czechoslovakia. Germany wanted to occupy Sudetenland – German-speaking territory in Czechoslovakia – after which there would be no more territorial demands in Europe. Chamberlain returned from Munich waving a worthless piece of paper promising ‘Peace in our time’. Hitler, a vegetarian and a non-smoker, was 50 years old when war was declared. On meeting the Führer in Munich, Chamberlain described Hitler’s appearance – severely parted black hair and a trademark Charlie Chaplin moustache – as ‘undistinguished’: ‘You would never notice him in a crowd’. Regardless of Chamberlain’s opinion, Hitler is one of the most recognisable figures of the twentieth century and in history. It was Hitler’s ambition, political views and charisma that defined the Nazis. His plans for Europe were outlined in his 1924 manifesto Mein Kampf (‘My Struggle’). Hitler was the public face of Nazism and he was the one featured in Allied cartoons and newsreels as ‘the enemy’. In North America, mock Western-style ‘Wanted’ posters were printed for the Führer ‘Alias Adolf Schicklegruber, Adolf Hittler or Adolf Hidler’, which read: ‘For Murder . . . For Kidnapping . . . For Theft And For Arson, This Reckless Criminal Is Wanted – Dead Or Alive’. Hitler has been portrayed many times in cinema and on TV, from the consummate, chilling impersonation by Bruno Ganz in Downfall (2004), to spoofs such as That Nazty Nuisance (1943) with Robert ‘Bobby’ Watson, who impersonated Hitler in several films, including The Story of Mankind (1957). Other actors to have played the Führer include David Bamber (Valkyrie), Anthony Hopkins (The Bunker), Alec Guinness (Hitler: The Last Ten Days), Rolf Stiefel (Battle of Britain), Billy Frick (Is Paris Burning?), Peter Miles (The Eagle Has Landed), Günther Bader (Schtonk!), Steven Berkoﬀ (War and Remembrance), Günther Meisner (The Winds of War), Richard Basehart (Hitler) and Martin Wuttke (Inglourious Basterds). The self-styled ‘Little Corporal’ was mercilessly caricatured by Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator (1940), by Peter Sellers’ barelysuppressed Nazi saluting Dr Strangelove (1964) and by British TV comedians such as Freddie Starr and Spike Milligan, though was the Führer ever a suitable subject for comedy? Chaplin later said that if he’d known about the Holocaust he’d never have made The Great Dictator, in which he played the dual roles of a Jewish ghetto barber and dictator Adenoid Hynkel of Tomania. On 1 September 1939, the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein fired on the Polish fort on the Westerplatte peninsula, near Danzig (now Gdansk) in Poland. These were the first shots of the conflict and without declaring war Hitler’s forces invaded Poland. Germany had signed a non-aggression pact with Russia in August 1939 and Joseph Stalin’s Red Army invaded Poland from the east on 17 September. Warsaw fell on 27 September and the entire country had capitulated by 5 October. The stage was set – the ‘War To End All Wars’ was about to have a sequel.\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 3\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE (1940)\n\nOn 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland. Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September and there followed eight months of ‘Phoney War’. The Germans called it the Sitzkrieg (‘Sitting War’) and in France it was Drôle de Guerre (‘Funny War’). This was a strange stalemate, as Europe held its breath and waited for something to happen. The false security of this period appeared in many films, such as In Which We Serve (1942) and in Spike Milligan’s autobiographical Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1972), while Stephen Poliakoﬀ ’s period espionage thriller Glorious 39 (2009) – which featured Ramola Garai, Julie Christie, David Tennant, Bill Nighy, Jenny Agutter, Eddie Redmayne and Christopher Lee – was set in the uncertain summer preceding the declaration of war. The British propaganda film The Lion Has Wings was released during the Phoney War in November 1939. It was produced by Alexander Korda and co-directed by Adrian Brunel, Brian Desmond Hurst and Michael Powell. Made in two weeks on a tiny budget, it combines newsreels, stock footage and dramatic re-enactments. The film begins by contrasting Britain’s tranquillity with the political turmoil in Germany. ‘This is Britain, where we believe in freedom’, intones the patriotic voiceover by E.V.H. Emmett (from Gaumont British News). Pastoral scenes of the countryside, children at school and at play, holidays, sports and pastimes are intercut with goose-stepping parade footage from Triumph of the Will. ‘What is your idea of a holiday?’ asks the narrator. ‘This?’ (a shot of a fairground carousel) ‘or this?’ (Hitler delivering a speech). Britain’s military power on land, sea and air is celebrated and factories churn out bombers, weapons and munitions. Newspaper headlines recount Hitler’s territorial demands and gains in Europe (including ‘Frightfulness In Occupied Poland’). We see a recreation of Wellington bombers attacking German ships in the Kiel Canal and a Luftwaﬀe bombing raid on south-eastern England (created from various footage, as Britain had not yet been bombed). The first wave of bombers is repulsed by\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 4\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE (1940)\n\n5\n\nBritish fighters, the second wave is broken up by anti-aircraft fire (‘Stand by boys to welcome the Nasties’, notes an ack-ack gunner) and the third wave curtail their attack on London when they spot the area is protected by barrage balloons (blimps tethered by steel wires), which force the bombers to fly at an altitude too high for accurate bombing. This raid is compared to the Spanish Armada, via stock footage of Flora Robson as Elizabeth I in Fire over England (1937). Lion Has Wings also features a scene between a husband and wife, an RAF oﬃcer (Ralph Richardson) and a nurse (Merle Oberon), both of whom are doing their bit for the not-yet-at-war eﬀort. Oberon delivers a speech extolling the virtues of land and freedom, and a Britain that believes in truth, beauty, fair play and kindness. The film is a naive view of what lay in store – the British Army was hopelessly outclassed in terms of tactics and armour, and it was going to take more than a few balloons to discourage the Luftwaﬀe. But the film served its purpose as encouraging, reassuring propaganda. As the Phoney War simmered, the German navy sneaked into the Atlantic in preparation for hostilities. In the Allies’ shipping lanes the Germans deployed magnetic mines, U-boat submarines and surface raiders, which sank commerce tonnage wherever they found it. The most famous was the ‘pocket battleship’ the Admiral Graf Spee. Pocket battleships were so-called because of their small size in comparison with true battleships, though they were heavily armed and armoured – the Graf Spee had 11-inch guns and 4-inch thick armour. Their size was necessitated by the Treaty of Versailles, which banned Germany constructing warships larger than 10,000 tonnes. The Graf Spee and her sister ship the Deutschland were loose in the Atlantic in August 1939, before the outbreak of hostilities. Under the command of Captain Hans Langsdorﬀ, the Graf Spee struck in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. From late-October to earlyDecember she sank the following merchant ships: the Clement (30 September), the Newton Beach (captured 5 October, sunk 7 October), the Ashlea (7 October), the Huntsman (captured on 10 October, sunk on 17 October), the Trevanion (sunk 22 October), the Africa Shell (15 November), the Blue Star Line’s Doric Star (2 December), the Tairoa (3 December) and the Streonshalh (7 December). The Graf Spee met her match on 17 December near Montevideo harbour in neutral Uruguay, following an encounter with British naval Force G (based on the Falkland Islands) in the mouth of the River Plate. The Battle of the River Plate (1956) accurately retold the Graf Spee’s last month at sea. The film begins on Wednesday 15 November 1939, with the sinking of the M.S. Africa Shell in the Mozambique Strait of the Indian Ocean. Her captain, Patrick Dove (Bernard Lee) is taken prisoner and he’s soon joined by other merchant captains and crew members captured by the German ship. Graf Spee refuels from the supply ship the Altmark and sets oﬀ around the Cape of Good Hope into the South Atlantic, sinking more merchant ships and eventually heading for South America. There she is attacked by Force G under Commodore Harwood: the cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Exeter and the New Zealand HMNZS Achilles. Though outclassed, the trio of cruisers inflict heavy damage on the Graf Spee, which heads into port in Montevideo, while the Exeter heads for the Falklands for repairs. As running repairs are carried out on the Graf Spee and\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 5\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\n6\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nthe British prisoners are released in neutral Uruguay, a diplomatic storm brews as to the German ship’s rights in a neutral harbour. The newly repaired HMS Cumberland arrives from the Falklands. British intelligence, misinformation and whispered rumours on the streets of Montevideo inflate the British force lying in wait for the Graf Spee to be as many as 13 vessels. On the evening of Sunday 17 December, Langsdorﬀ sails the Graf Spee out of the harbour, abandons ship and scuttles her in the Rio de la Plata. The Battle of the River Plate was known as The Pursuit of the Graf Spee for US release. It was the penultimate collaboration between writer-director-producers Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell, and was based on Patrick Dove’s 1940 book I Was Graf Spee’s Prisoner (Dove also acted as a technical advisor on the imprisonment scenes) and on Powell’s 1956 book Graf Spee. The film was a factually accurate re-enactment of the events, using several actual naval ships, which are an improvement on the models and miniatures usually deployed in movie sea battles. Here the Achilles was played by the Indian Navy’s INS Delhi, the Exeter was HMS Jamaica, Ajax was portrayed by HMS Sheﬃeld, HMS Cumberland played herself and the US heavy cruiser Salem made a memorable Admiral Graf Spee. Peter Finch played Langsdorﬀ, Anthony Quayle was Commodore Harwood aboard his flagship the Ajax and John Gregson was Captain Bell on the Exeter. Lionel Murton played American Mike Fowler, a fast-talking NBC news reporter, who provides a running commentary on developments in Montevideo harbour (filmed in Montevideo and Malta). In a cast of future stars, Patrick Macnee (later Steed in TV’s The Avengers) had an early role as Lieutenant Commander Medley, Jack Watson played Swanson, the Cornish lookout who first spots the Graf Spee, John Le Mesurier (later of TV’s Dad’s Army) was the Exeter’s padre and Barry Foster played a rating (a non-commissioned sailor). Christopher Lee had a brief role as Manolo, a moustachioed bar owner in Montevideo. Michael Goodliﬀe played Naval Attaché McCall and Anthony Newley appeared as a captured merchant seaman. The film loses momentum when the story arrives in Montevideo, becoming bogged down in diplomacy, but the naval scenes of Force G and the Graf Spee on the move are splendidly shot in colourful VistaVision and more than compensate for the film’s talky lulls. The biggest failing is the stagy use of studio-bound interiors recreated at Pinewood for the warships’ bridges: these are completely unconvincing, being both windless and motionless. The film also allows Langsdorﬀ dignity in defeat and the climax concentrates on the victorious British ships sailing into the sunset. In reality Langsdorﬀ committed suicide on 18 December in Buenos Aires. The catastrophic fall of France amazed the world in May and June 1940 and still confounds historians today. The Phoney War ended when Hitler’s Wehrmacht (‘armed forces’) turned its attention to Western Europe. First they invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, in operations that combined seaborne transporters and airborne landings. To the south, Denmark too was overrun on 9 April. Since the invasion of Poland, Hitler had amassed his army along the eastern borders of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. By May, the Germans were prepared for an invasion, but the eight-month gap since Poland’s demise had\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 6\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE (1940)\n\n7\n\nallowed the Allies to mobilise their forces. Eight Dutch divisions protected Holland; 18 divisions deployed in Belgium (with four in reserve); and 22 divisions protected France’s northern border (with a further 22 in reserve). The British dispatched the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) under General Lord John Gort to the Western Front. Nine divisions joined the French line, with two in reserve in the Netherlands. Prime Minister Chamberlain was convinced that ‘Hitler has missed the bus’, but although the Allies outnumbered the German troops – the Allies numbered over 2.8 million troops and 3,600 tanks; the Germans 2.3 million troops and 2,700 tanks – Hitler’s generals deployed their resources more eﬀectively. Crucially the Germans had the advantage in the air – 3,200 planes to the Allies 1,700 – and knew that their Luftwaﬀe air force could be best used in conjunction with their ground forces. This Blitzkrieg, or ‘Lighting War’, was a sustained spearhead push that would punch a hole through enemy defences. The fast-moving ground columns, a combination of armour and mechanised infantry (the Panzergrenadiers), were supported by air cover from the bombers – the two-engined fighter bomber the Messerschmitt Bf 110C and most significantly the Junkers Ju-87, the deadly Stukas. The Stukas were airborne artillery, swooping on their targets and obliterating them, their Junkers Jumo engines emitting a piercing scream as the planes dived. They bombed their opponents into submission while the well-drilled Panzer Corps – motorised infantry and tanks – provided a hammer blow on the ground. Behind enemy lines, paratroop and glider shock-troops secured vital objectives. The Allies, still labouring under the preconceptions and tactics of the last war, weren’t prepared for Hitler’s lightning bolts. Hitler struck on 10 May, the day Chamberlain stepped down as prime minister of Britain and was replaced by Winston Churchill (the Conservative head of the Admiralty). The Allies had expected the Germans to avoid the Maginot Line – the French defences which ran from Luxembourg to Switzerland – and were prepared for an attack through Belgium. This would have been a replay of the Schlieﬀen Plan, the German tactics used in World War I. True to form, the German forces did attack in the north into Holland and Belgium on 10 May. Operation Amsterdam (1959) was set during the weekend the Germans invaded Holland. British intelligence’s Major Dillon (Tony Britton) and two diamond experts, Walter Keyser (Alexander Knox) and Jan Smit (Peter Finch), infiltrate the city to extract the country’s valuable supply of industrial diamonds before the Germans can loot them. Eva Bartok played their Dutch compatriot Anna and the film is more espionage-thriller than war movie, though the deserted Amsterdam streets, with their carnivalesque Pierement organ players, are rather eerie. The German invasion of Holland and Belgium was a diversion – Hitler’s strategist General Erich Von Manstein had formulated a new plan: Operation Sichelschnitt (Operation Sickle Cut). German airborne troops took the fortress at Eben Emael, which defended the Albert Canal and allowed German troops to attack Belgium. On 14 May, Rotterdam was levelled by German bombers in the so-called Horror Raid, which resulted in Holland’s surrender on 15 May. Meanwhile Hitler’s Panzers of Army Group A worked their way through the Ardennes\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 7\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\n8\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nforest, catching the Allies completely by surprise. The dense Ardennes in the Allies centre had been deemed impassable to armoured vehicles, but General Heinz Guderian found a way through, meeting only light resistance, and drove on to the River Meuse. The river was crossed at Sedan and Monthermé in the south and at Dinant in the north. The Germans achieved a breakthrough at Sedan and once the line was breached there was no stopping Guderian. French and British counterattacks failed and a German column reached the Channel coast at Noyelles on 20 May. The BEF and French forces fighting in Belgium now found themselves outflanked and surrounded. Boulogne was taken on 25 May and Calais the next day. On 28 May Belgium surrendered, leaving the remaining Allied forces hemmed in on the coast and low on supplies, with a further pocket of French forces surrounded inland around Lille. In an attempt to salvage something from this shambles, the Allies evacuated the BEF, French and Belgian forces stranded on the Dunkirk coast back to England in Operation Dynamo. Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay oversaw the operation from the Dynamo Room, which was cut into Dover’s white cliﬀs. The operation was a logistical nightmare, as the Royal Navy couldn’t cope with such a large-scale expedition. The Admiralty provided 42 destroyers and other large transporters and assembled an armada of boats of all types – the Mosquito Navy – from boatyards and private owners along the Thames and the south coast. Anything deemed suitable was commandeered: fishing boats, cabin cruisers, motor boats, tugs, fire ships, pleasure boats, paddle steamers, barges, launches and yachts. They sailed from Sheerness, Ramsgate, Dover, Folkestone, Newhaven and Margate, and Southend and Deal were also used as return points. On the French coast, the evacuation began on 26 May from the beaches of Malo-les-Bains, BrayDunes, La Panne and St. Pol-sur-Mer, and the port of Dunkirk. The Luftwaﬀe strafed and dive-bombed the beaches, as the helpless soldiers waded out into the sea (to be picked up by the smaller boats and ferried to larger destroyers) or queued on makeshift jetties and piers. The Allies’ saving grace was that the sand muﬄed the bomb explosions, minimising the radius of shell burst. The rescue ships had to avoid enemy E-boats (surface water motor launches), submarines, mines and artillery barrages. The beaches became littered with abandoned and burned-out vehicles and bodies, as grim Dynamo went on. All the BEF’s equipment was left behind, including some 75,000 vehicles and 11,000 machine guns. On 2 June, the Germans bombed a hospital ship and by 4 June, when Dynamo was called oﬀ, 338,000 Allied soldiers had been rescued. On 5 June, the French rearguard finally capitulated, collapsing the beachhead defences. Ealing Studios, a British company best-known for comedies, produced the finest version of these events. Dunkirk (1958) told the evacuation’s story through three protagonists – cynical journalist Charles Foreman (Bernard Lee) and cowardly civilian John Holden (Richard Attenborough), both of whom are in England, and British ‘Tommy’ Corporal Tubby Binns (John Mills) with the stranded BEF. British soldiers were called ‘Tommies’ after ‘Tommy Atkins’, the name used as the example on specimens of oﬃcial enlistment forms. These three protagonists’ separate stories intertwine on the beach at Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo.\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 8\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:00 PM\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE (1940)\n\n9\n\nStranded in France with the British Expeditionary Force, British ‘Tommy’, Corporal Tubby Binns (John Mills, right), contemplates his next move in Leslie Norman’s Dunkirk (1958). Courtesy Kevin Wilkinson Collection.\n\nIn 1940, during the ‘Phoney War’, journalist Foreman tries to force straight answers from British Army spokesmen who are economical with the truth, while Hitler’s divisions mass on the border. When the fury of the Blitzkrieg is unleashed, the Belgian, French and British forces are overwhelmed. Binns and his Wiltshire regiment are ordered to pull back from their defence of the River Dyle, destroying bridges as they go. An aerial attack kills Lieutenant Lumpkin (Kenneth Cope) and Binns takes command of the remaining four men, who are separated from their unit in the confusion of the war zone. They witness a Royal Artillery battery obliterated by a dive-bombing Stuka attack: ‘That’s murder, that’s sheer bloody murder’, notes a British Tommy. It is decided that the situation is hopeless and the BEF is ordered to pull back to Dunkirk for evacuation. In an eﬀort to assemble a flotilla, the Royal Navy requisition ‘anything that can float’. Foreman and Holden have their riverboats purloined and sail to Ramsgate, via Sheerness, where they volunteer to take their boats across the Channel. Meanwhile Binns and his men scrounge for food as the Germans close in. They manage to break through German lines and hitch a lift in a British lorry heading for Dunkirk. On the outskirts of the town they scuttle the lorry to prevent it falling into enemy hands (emptying the sump and running the engine until it seizes up) and join the thousands of soldiers waiting for rescue on the beaches. The troops are at the mercy of the Luftwaﬀe, who strafe the beaches and bomb the relief ships oﬀshore. Foreman’s boat is sunk and Holden’s engine packs up,\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 9\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:01 PM\n\n10\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nso they try to repair it on the beach. During an air attack, Foreman is killed. Holden, his boat fixed, ferries Binns and his comrades back to Blighty. Produced by Michael Balcon and directed by Leslie Norman (UK film critic Barry Norman’s father), Dunkirk was based on The Big Pick Up, a 1955 novel by Adam Hall (as ‘Elleston Trevor’) and the play Dunkirk by Lt-Col Ewan Butler and Major J.S. Bradford. The screenplay was written by David Devine and W.P. Lipscomb. Malcolm Arnold provided the rousing, patriotic score. Norman shot interiors at Ealing Studios and used authentic locations for the English scenes, including Fingringhole, Colchester and Sheerness Dockyards in Kent. The flotilla sails down the Thames past Westminster and Big Ben, and the cliﬀs of Dover also appear as a backdrop. The long flat beach backed by dunes on Camber Sands in East Sussex was ‘Dunkirk’. Dunkirk’s parallel stories keep the plot moving. Mills is his usual stalwart self in a genre he excelled at. He made many war movies, including three in 1958: Dunkirk, Ice Cold in Alex and I Was Monty’s Double. Bernard Lee (later M in the James Bond films) is good as the cynical journalist who stands on Dunkirk beach and witnesses the fiasco firsthand. He notes that the BEF are using ‘last-war weapons, last-war methods’. But it’s Attenborough who most impresses, with his portrayal of Holden, the garage owner and proprietor of a small engineering firm which makes belt buckles for the army. Holden thinks he’s ‘doing his bit’, but others take him for a cowardly shirker with a ‘soft job’. He initially claims that he’s far too busy to pilot his boat to Sheerness, let alone to Dunkirk, and frets for his wife Grace (Patricia Plunkett) and their newborn baby. In a moving scene, he attempts to fit a cumbersome gasmask on the baby. Holden realises that he’s not doing enough for the war eﬀort. The navy requisition his vessel, the Heron, and his young employee Frankie (Sean Barrett) volunteers to go to France, convincing Holden to sail with the flotilla. It is Holden, not Foreman, who survives and returns a hero. Dunkirk is convincing in its recreation of the period – the film’s technical advisors were Ewan Butler and Lt-Cdr John Pidler. Historical figures General Lord Gort and Vice-Admiral Ramsay both appear (played by Cyril Raymond and Nicholas Hannen). Newsreel footage is used in the film’s introduction, outlining the present political unrest in Europe. British Tommies in France watch cartoons mocking Hitler – ‘Run Adolf, Run Adolf, Run Run Run’, sung to ‘Run Rabbit’. In England Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen (appearing as themselves) entertain theatre audiences with ‘Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line’ and Holden turns oﬀ a wireless broadcasting Lord Haw-Haw’s pro-Hitler ‘twaddle’. But soon the ‘Phoney War’ – the war of words and propaganda – gives way to the real conflict. Black-and-white war films have always been more realistic than their colour counterparts, mainly due to their resemblance to newsreels and propaganda films of the time. Monochrome cinematography also facilitated the use of actual war footage in battle scenes, cheaply adding an air of authenticity to the action. In Dunkirk, stock-footage Stukas dive-bomb an artillery emplacement in a wood and archive film of Hitler’s ‘lightning war’ steamrollers though Belgium and France. When an Allied transporter is Stuka-bombed, the footage of men scrambling for safety and the sinking ship is recreated in a studio and the scenes\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 10\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:03 PM\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE (1940)\n\n11\n\nof returning troops disembarking after the evacuation are a mixture of stock and recreated footage. Scenes of chaos in France bring home the grim logic of war. German planes don’t bomb fleeing refugee columns, but machine-gun them: the Germans want the roads intact for their advancing tanks. In the actual battle, the French removed road signs to confuse the German advance, a tactic that would be unthinkable today, when even private cars have satellite navigation. When Binns and his men reach the beach, Dunkirk’s depiction of the evacuation is its finest achievement, with expansive wide shots of Camber Sands crowded with troops. They resemble archive photographs and Retreat from Dunkirk, the painting by Charles Cundall, with palls of black smoke, circling German aircraft, shell bursts, boats and evacuees. The film’s embarkation scenes are a combination of special eﬀects (using backdrops, scale models, reproduction boat sets and a water tank) and recreations on Camber. A Tabac near the beach is converted into a makeshift field hospital, where medical oﬃcer Lionel Jeﬀries and his men draw lots to see who will remain to tend the wounded. An RAF pilot sheltering on the beach is harangued by Allied troops who complain about the lack of air cover, with the Stukas striking at will. In reality the RAF was largely powerless against the German air superiority, even though Churchill diverted precious aircraft earmarked to defend mainland Britain in the coming months. Binns and his men think they’re on their way home when they board a transporter, but it is hit and the survivors struggle, spluttering and shivering, back to shore. German planes drop fliers urging the Allies to surrender and a padre leads the waiting troops in the Lord’s Prayer during a service which is dispersed by a Stuka strike. It is during this attack that Foreman is mown down. The troops play football, gamble, clean their weapons or huddle in the sand, but all wait and hope for liberation. The finale depicts not defeat and retreat, but triumphs: the British and their ‘miracle’ rescue of the BEF, Holden’s contribution to the war eﬀort and Binns, whose men would have perished without his leadership and Holden’s valour. Apart from Leslie Norman’s film, few outings have depicted this dark hour. Henri Verneuil’s Weekend at Dunkirk (1964 – Week-end à Zuydcoote) had French soldier Jean-Paul Belmondo caught up in the evacuation. Verneuil’s staging of the devastated beaches is convincing and was backed by an eﬀective Maurice Jarre score. The film opens with a holiday poster advertising the sunny seaside resort with the tagline ‘Ses Dunes, Sa Plage, Son Air’ (‘Its Dunes, Its Beach, Its Air’) which fades into a shot of the beach overcrowded with retreating French troops. Dunkirk was also recreated in the romantic drama Atonement (2007), which featured a continuous five-minute shot along the beach and shattered seafront (filmed at Redcar, near Middlesbrough), as witnessed by British soldier Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). This sequence depicts a beached yacht, a carousel and Ferris wheel, and soldiers shooting their horses, disabling vehicles and singing the hymn ‘Dear Lord and Father of Mankind’ in a bandstand. In Reach for the Sky (1956), Douglas Bader (Kenneth More) flies an RAF sortie over the evacuation and during In Which We Serve (1942) HMS Torrin takes part in the evacuation. Sailor Shorty Blake (Mills again) hands out hot cocoa and biscuits to wounded British soldiers, while the BEF oﬃcers on the bridge with the ship’s\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 11\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:03 PM\n\n12\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nskipper, Kinross (Noël Coward), fare rather better. As Kinross notes of their tipple: ‘It’s just ordinary Bovril rather heavily laced with sherry’. Mrs Miniver (1942), directed in Hollywood by William Wyler at MGM, highlighted the wartime plight of ‘a quiet corner of England’ for American audiences. As the trailer states, it was based on ‘Jan Struther’s Book-of-the-Month Club Hit!’ The story begins in the summer of 1939 ‘when the sun shone down on a happy, careless people, who worked and played, reared their children and tended their gardens’. Greer Garson took the role of housewife Kay Miniver after Norma Shearer had turned it down. The war gradually encroaches on average middle-class family life in the fictional country village of Belham. Kay’s architect husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon) joins the Mosquito Navy and sails to Ramsgate for Dunkirk. Kay herself is confronted by a downed Luftwaﬀe pilot brandishing a Luger, whom she finds under a bush in her garden. The Minivers’ son Vin (Richard Ney, later Garson’s husband) joins the RAF and fights in the Battle of Britain and Carol (Teresa Wright), his wife of two weeks, is killed during the battle by a stray bullet. Life goes on in Belham, as they endure air raids and the Minivers’ house, Starlings, is hit by a bomb: ‘Oh, it’s not as bad as it looks – we just didn’t have time to clear it all up’, cheery Kay tells a shocked visitor. Dame May Whitty played Carol’s mother, snooty Lady Beldon, and Henry Wilcoxon was the vicar, who in the film’s climax delivers a rousing speech from the pulpit of a bombed out, roofless church. World War II films are predominantly a male-dominated genre and it was rare examples, such as Mrs Miniver, that headline a female star. Women were usually relegated to playing ‘love interest’ nurses, secretaries or radio operators. WWII films with prominent female characters tended to be set on the Home Front, such as Mrs Miniver or Tender Comrade (1943 – starring Ginger Rogers), or else behind the front lines, in hospitals (for example Cry ‘Havoc’) or prison camps (A Town Like Alice). Garson won a Best Actress Oscar for Mrs Miniver, Wyler Best Director and the movie Best Picture. Despite many tragedies, the Belham locals occupy themselves with churchgoing, hymn-singing and their Flower Festival, in this melodrama which is still surprisingly powerful today. Churchill thought the film’s plucky, positive message was worth more to the war eﬀort than troops and armaments. A sequel, H.C. Potter’s The Miniver Story (1950), again with Garson and Pidgeon, saw the family reunited in post-war England. By far the most inventive deployment of the Dunkirk evacuation was Enzo G. Castellari’s Eagles Over London (1969). The film begins with Captain Paul Stevens (Frederick Staﬀord) leading a BEF rearguard action against advancing German armour (the German tanks are 1950s vintage American US M47s and M48s). The British are ordered to withdraw and join a column retreating towards Dunkirk, which is strafed by a German fighter. Stevens’ men destroy a bridge and proceed to the Dunkirk beachhead. Some money was obviously spent on Eagles by producer Edmondo Amati, as the Dunkirk evacuation scenes and the return to Dover port are impressive. The beaches are littered with personnel and equipment and three German planes swoop from the sky, machine-gunning and bombing the evacuees. This snapshot of history is shown being captured on film by a war cameraman on the beach. The troops wade out to the small boats, are\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 12\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:03 PM\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE (1940)\n\n13\n\ntransferred to transporters and sail for Dover. The bustling port is recreated, as Stevens is reunited with his lover RAF lieutenant Meg Jones (‘Evelyn Stewart’/ Ida Galli) and French fliers enlist in the RAF. In an ingenious twist, during the retreat in France, German SS commandos led by Major Krueger (Luigi Pistilli) murder a squad of British soldiers, don British uniforms and travel to Dover in the rescue boats. The remainder of Eagles Over London has Kruger’s men let loose in London. Their mission is to blow up aerial radar installations and the control room operations centre during the Battle of Britain. ‘Hank Milestone’/Umberto Lenzi’s From Hell to Victory (1979), another Amati production, was released in some territories as From Dunkirk to Victory. Spanning the entire war, it begins in August 1939 with four friends, an American, a German, a Frenchman and a Brit (played not wholly convincingly by George Peppard, Horst Buchholz, George Hamilton and Jean-Pierre Cassel) boating on the Seine. Soon the war arrives – we know this via a series of exclamatory titles: ‘Poland Defeated!’ ‘France Invaded!’ – and tears their friendship apart. Buchholz becomes a tank commander, Peppard an OSS agent, and Hamilton and Cassel are trapped at Dunkirk and shipped back to Dover. Their evacuation is depicted by chunks of footage from Eagles Over London. With the departure of the BEF in June 1940, the second phase of the German invasion of France, codenamed Operation Red, began on 5 June. Paris fell on 14 June and the German army methodically mopped up French resistance in the south. Almost one third of the French army was employed defending the Maginot Line, which was never attacked. France signed an Armistice with Germany on 22 June in the same Parisian railway car that the Allies had accepted the German surrender in 1918. On 20 June Mussolini’s Italian forces struck in the South of France and the French signed an armistice with Italy on 24 June. France was then split into zones. Occupied France – that is France under German control – was the northern and western territory, which encompassed France’s Atlantic coastline (to guard against Allied amphibious invasion). Newly-formed Vichy France was the south-eastern part of the country, including its Mediterranean coast. From the town of Vichy, French prime minister Marshal Henri Pétain governed the collaborationist unoccupied zone (the ‘zone libre’) and also France’s overseas colonies, including Tunisia, Algeria and French Morocco in North Africa. Charles De Gaulle was declared the head of France’s ‘government in exile’ in London and formed the Free French, the French Resistance movement. In May and June 1940 the Allies were tactically outclassed and the new model German army, defined by steel and speed, seemed to have risen mythically from another age. But despite the rapier Blitzkrieg, some German infantry units still used bicycles and the slow supply columns and artillery trains used horses and oxen to cart their kit. Sometimes Blitzkriegs were too quick for their own good, but the campaign in France was a resounding success. The Germans may have been well-drilled and eﬃcient, but the Allies certainly proved they could improvise. If the Allies took anything from the debacle it was the indomitable ‘Dunkirk Spirit’ which drove the British war eﬀort, as Britain stood defiantly against all-conquering Hitler across the Channel.\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 13\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:03 PM\n\nChapter 2\n\nTHE WAR IN THE SKIES (1940–45)\n\nWith the evacuation of Dunkirk and the fall of France, Hitler expected Britain to surrender, but Churchill stood firm: ‘The Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin’. In the summer of 1940, Hitler planned an amphibious invasion of Britain, designated Operation Seelöwe or ‘Sealion’. Rather than attacking Britain through the rougher North Sea, the Germans decided on routes across the English Channel. From the peninsula at Cherbourg three divisions (Army Group B) would land in Lyme Bay at Lyme Regis and move north to Bristol. From Le Havre four divisions (Army Group A) would take the Isle of Wight and Brighton. Six divisions of Army Group A would leave Boulogne, Calais, Dunkirk and Ostend and attack the southeast coast, at Bexhill, Folkestone, Dover and Ramsgate. Objectives included the outflanking and surrounding of London, and a frontline (stretching from Southampton to Gravesend) which would move north to capture Gloucester, Oxford, St Albans and Maldon. For the German plan to succeed, it was vital that they gain air superiority to protect their invasion fleet – it would have more chance against the Royal Navy if they could deploy the Luftwaﬀe to its full potential. In May 1940, Anthony Eden, Britain’s Secretary of State for War, announced the formation of the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV), later renamed the Home Guard. It consisted of men aged between 17 and 65 who would defend Britain’s home soil in the event of a German invasion. Their importance to Britain’s safety considerably increased after Dunkirk. The big-screen spin-oﬀ from the UK TV series Dad’s Army (1971) tells how the (fictitious) Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard was assembled. They are commanded by pompous Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), a bank manager in ‘Civvy Street’, whose military experience is that he served in France in 1919 (a year after World War I ended). His squad – who were familiar from the TV series – included urbane Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier), miserable undertaker Frazer (John Laurie), black-marketeering\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 14\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:03 PM\n\nTHE WAR IN THE SKIES (1940–45)\n\n15\n\nspiv Walker (James Beck), whingeing ‘Stupid Boy’ Pike (Ian Lavender), deaf-asa-post Godfrey (Arnold Ridley) and butcher Lance-Corporal Jones (Clive Dunn). Jones is a fine creation. A veteran of the Sudan (where he fought under Kitchener against the ‘fuzzy wuzzies’), the Boer War and World War I, he gave the series some memorable catchphrases, such as ‘Cold steel – they don’t like it up ‘em’ and his famous ‘Don’t panic!’ Other regular characters reprised in the movie include grumpy ARP Warden Hodges (Bill Pertwee), the Reverend Timothy Farthing (Frank Williams) and the verger (Edward Sinclair). The brisk, episodic plot sent the bungling platoon on army manoeuvres, where they manage to flatten their own tents with a traction engine and send Major General Fullard (Bernard Archard) and his horse drifting downriver on a section of pontoon bridge. They later become heroes when they save the vicar and other villagers from three Luftwaﬀe crewmen who have bailed out and taken the locals hostage in the village hall. The Home Guard foil the invaders by disguising themselves as a church choir, emerging from the crypt singing ‘All things Bright and Beautiful’ dressed in cassocks and surpluses. The film was shot at Shepperton Studios and on location (Walmington-on-Sea’s street was Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire) and the film version retained the series’ famous theme tune, ‘Who Do You Think You’re Kidding, Mr Hitler?’ sung by Bud Flanagan. The film is at its best when depicting the Home Guard’s inadequate equipment. In that respect Dad’s Army was historically accurate. The Home Guard were often poorly armed and the LDV designation was cruelly reinterpreted as ‘Look, Duck and Vanish’. In the film, their first ‘uniforms’ arrive (simply arm bands reading ‘LDV’) and they receive ammunition, but no rifles. They muster their own weaponry – a formidable selection of assegai spears, shotguns, sabres, pitchforks and broom handles with knives taped to the end – and plan to defend the promenade from the Novelty Rock Emporium. Their home-made defences include two-dozen petrol bombs in lemonade bottles, a rocket-firing anti-aircraft device made from drainpipes, a one-man, bullet-proof tank (an upside down cast-iron bath on wheels), a gas-powered ‘armoured car’ (Jones’ butchers van) and an ‘anti-vehicle device’ which emits an oil slick on the road. Powell and Pressburger’s The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) begins and ends with a Home Guard exercise – a mock defence of London against invasion – during which old soldier Clive Wynne-Candy V.C. (Roger Livesey), a retired general and Boer War and World War I veteran, realises that he is out of touch with modern ‘total war’. Told ‘the war starts at midnight’, Blimp is captured when an enterprising young oﬃcer (James McKechnie) surprises him in a Turkish bath, by not playing by the rules and starting the exercise early – as the Germans would do. Featuring a wonderful performance by Livesey, Colonel Blimp is most interesting in its depiction of Candy’s relationships with three women – Edith Hunter (whom he loses to German oﬃcer Theo KretschmarSchuldorﬀ [Anton Walbrook]), Barbara Wynne (whom he marries) and Angela ‘Johnny’ Cannon (his young driver during World War II). All three are played by Deborah Kerr. Future Dad’s Army regular John Laurie played Blimp’s batman and butler Murdoch, who joins the Home Guard.\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 15\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:04 PM\n\n16\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nOperation Sealion was provisionally set for 15 September 1940. The Royal Air Force (RAF) were Britain’s first line of defence – their motto was ‘Per Ardva Ad Astra’: ‘Through Adversity to the Stars’. RAF Fighter Command, led by Air Chief Marshall Sir Hugh ‘Stuﬀ y’ Dowding, consisted of 591 aircraft (though more were being rushed out on production lines). They were divided into four groups: Fighter Command Group 10 defended south-west England; Number 11 protected the southeast; Number 12 the east and Midlands; and Number 13 the north. The German aerial attacks began on 10 July 1940 in an attempt to disrupt shipping by bombing ports, docks and vessels at sea. With 13 Divisions massed on the Channel coast, on 17 July German troops began rehearsing embarkation and invasion drill under their commander-in-chief, Field Marshal Walter Von Brauchitsch. During this first phase of the invasion plan, Portsmouth was bombed on 11 July and on 8 August a convoy was attacked at Weymouth, as part of the ongoing campaign to weaken Britain’s Channel defences. To counter Germany’s aerial threat, Britain deployed anti-aircraft batteries, powerful search lights, barrage balloons (‘shiners’ as the RAF pilots called them) and the Observation Corps of spotters. The BBC stopped transmitting television programmes for the duration of the war, so the signal couldn’t be used to guide in German bombers. Britain also deployed the newly invented radar system (the RDF, or Radio Direction Finding), which meant that the RAF didn’t have to patrol the skies, but could ‘scramble’ (take oﬀ ) when the early warning system alerted them to the presence of approaching enemy aircraft, which were then tracked on maps in the operations room. Britain’s principal air defences were fighter squadrons of Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes (both powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines) and a small number of two-seater Defiants. Against them was the formidable German Air Force, under its commander-in-chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, which was divided into Luft Flotten (air fleets). Luftlotte 2 launched from the Low Countries and north-east France, Luftlotte 3 was based in north-west France and Luftlotte 5 was stationed in Norway and Denmark. They consisted of Ju-87 Stuka (an abbreviation of Stukageschwader) dive-bombers (used so eﬀectively as ground troop support in the Blitzkrieg), Messerschmitt Bf-109 fighters (with their brightly coloured yellow or red nose cones), twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf-110 fighter-bombers; Junkers Ju-88 bombers, Dornier Do-17 bombers (the long thin ‘Flying Pencils’) and Heinkel He-111 twin-engined bombers. The German air assault on Britain began on 11 August 1940, with the bombers protected by fighter escorts. Designated Adler Tag (‘Eagle Day’), the operation initially stalled due to low cloud and eventually got underway on 13 August. This was the first day of what became known as the Battle of Britain. By 18 August the bombing campaign wasn’t going the Luftwaﬀe’s way and Göring’s assurances to Hitler of impending German air supremacy were unfounded. The RAF and the ground defences fought tenaciously and the Luftwaﬀe suﬀered great losses. On 20 August, Churchill made his famous speech which proclaimed: ‘Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few’. The RAF bombed Berlin on 24 and 25 August. From 24 August until 6 September, the Luftwaﬀe changed tactics, concentrating its attacks on the airfields of\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 16\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:04 PM\n\nTHE WAR IN THE SKIES (1940–45)\n\n17\n\nFighter Command Group 11 in the southeast. On September 6, in response to the bombing of Berlin, Hitler ordered attacks on London to begin in earnest. The sustained bombing of Britain’s capital, which lasted until May 1941, became known as the Blitz. This allowed depleted Fighter Command to reorganise and recuperate, and proved to be Hitler’s biggest blunder of the battle. The RAF’s staunch defence pushed Hitler’s Sealion plan back to 27 September. The Germans needed ten day’s notice to mobilise the invasion, so the Luftwaﬀe had to gain air superiority by 17 September. Sunday 15 September 1940 was the decisive day in the engagement and was known thereafter as ‘Battle of Britain Day’, a swirling battle for control of the skies over London. At 11.35 am the first wave of German bombers and fighters arrived over the British coast at Dungeness on the Straits of Dover, and by noon the first planes had reached London. Battle was joined and between 11.30 and 12.30, the swirling dogfights stretched between London and the coast. Meeting sustained resistance from the RAF, the Germans dropped their bombs and returned swiftly to their bases. The encounter tailed oﬀ and another German attack began at 2 pm but was repulsed by the tenacious Spitfires and Hurricanes, who peeled oﬀ, swooped and attacked. The Spitfires attacked the fighter escorts while the Hurricanes harassed the bombers. Two unexploded bombs fell in the grounds of Buckingham Palace and a Dornier crashed into the front of Victoria Station. Its crew, hit for six, parachuted into the Oval cricket ground. The last attack of the day came at 5 pm, but the RAF triumphed. The RAF’s victory on 15 September, the most famous aerial battle of the war, put Sealion on hold permanently. The aerial fighting over Britain continued, with 27 September planned by the Germans as the day they would finally wipe out the RAF, but it ended in failure. By 31 October, when the Germans conceded defeat, the RAF had lost 1,023 planes and the Luftwaﬀe 1,887. Just as Lord Nelson’s victory over the French and Spanish fleets oﬀ Spain’s Cape Trafalgar in 1805 curtailed Napoleon’s invasion of Britain, so the Battle of Britain foiled Hitler’s invasion plans. Battle of Britain (1969) was an ambitious US-financed, British and Europeanshot recreation of the Luftwaﬀe’s prolonged air strikes against Britain, with an all-star cast. Directed by Guy Hamilton (of Goldfinger fame), it was based on the 1961 book The Narrow Margin by Derek Wood and Derek Dempster. James Kennaway and Wilfred Greatorex fabricated a screenplay around the actual events and an early working title was The Thin Blue Line. The film begins in France in May 1940, with the Dunkirk retreat, and follows several RAF squadrons as their airfields in France are overrun and they return to England to defend London and the southeast of England. It also provides the German viewpoint, with scenes depicting Luftwaﬀe commanders and their strategies, and the preparations for Operation Sealion in the French Channel ports. Columns of trucks transport assault barges, harbours are crammed with ships and German troops mass on the coast, lifejackets at the ready. Events are recreated as they happened and for audiences with no interest in the battle, the pace is slow. For historians however, Battle of Britain is a treat. It was produced by Harry Saltzman with finance provided by United Artists in New York. Initially budgeted at $3.5 million, the film was beset with\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 17\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:04 PM\n\n18\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nproblems – particularly bad weather during the dreadful wet English summer of 1968 – and the eventual cost shot up to $13 million. The troubled making of the film is told in Leonard Mosley’s excellent first-hand account, Battle of Britain, published by Pan to tie-in with the film’s release in 1969. In addition to a costly star cast, Saltzman gathered an impressive roster of actual World War II aircraft. The Messerschmitt Bf 109s are repainted Germandesigned Hispano Buchon planes from the Spanish airforce. They are powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, which sound quite diﬀerent to their authentic Daimler-Benz originals (‘Bf’ means the plant in which they were made – Bayerische Flugzeugwerke). The technical manager was engineer Willy Messerschmitt. During the war, camouflage paint was applied to the top half of the plane and the upper side of the wings (so they blended with the landscape below when spotted from above) and they were painted pale grey or blue on their undersides (to merge with the clouds and sky when observed from the ground). The RAF planes are authentic Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes. Twenty-eight Messerschmitts, Fifty Heinkel He-111s and a three-engined Junkers Ju-52 appeared for the Luftwaﬀe. They were flown with consummate expertise by Spanish pilots and four lively Texans from the Confederate Air Force. So many authentic aircraft were reconditioned, repaired and leased for the film that it was the 35th largest air force in the world at the time and was dubbed ‘Saltzman’s Private Air Force’. Much of Battle of Britain was shot in Spain, with filming commencing in March 1968. The French Lafayette Escadrille air bases used by the Luftwaﬀe were filmed at the El Copero and Tablada air bases, near Seville. The Dunkirk evacuation scenes were filmed on Huelva beach, west of Seville, using Spanish extras, matte special eﬀect shots and an artificial sandbank. A Luftwaﬀe HQ was a farmstead near the Guadalquivir River. On the northern Spanish coast east of Santander and near the French border, San Sebastian’s harbour and beach became a French Channel port swarming with German troops preparing for the invasion. San Sebastian itself was redressed as Berlin for a night time air raid scene. The railway station at Irurzun, 60 miles from the Pamplona mainline, was used for the arrival of Marshal Göring in Pas De Calais, with a Spanish dining coach redressed for the period. By April the main unit returned to England to film on authentic British bases: RAF Duxford (Cambridgeshire), RAF Hawkinge (Kent) and North Weald Aerodrome (Essex). RAF Bentley Priory, Middlesex, the HQ of Fighter Command, appeared as itself. The main unit shot at Duxford, while the air unit was based at RAF Debden airfield. The attack on ‘B Station’, Duxford by the Luftwaﬀe was the film’s biggest, most expensive special eﬀects sequence, which called for several large explosions and a disused aircraft hanger to be destroyed – the smoking, burning devastation was captured in aerial shots. For the scenes of the bombing of London, the film company bought and burned down an old tea warehouse in London’s Docklands. The scenes depicting ruined streets and fire crews tackling blazes were filmed in Dragon Road, Camberwell, London. These derelict streets were slated for demolition in the Greater London Council’s slum clearance. Londoners shelter from the rain of bombs in the Aldwych underground tube station, which became a vast air raid shelter. Interiors were filmed in Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Towards the end of August,\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 18\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:04 PM\n\nTHE WAR IN THE SKIES (1940–45)\n\n19\n\nSpitfires, Messerschmitts and a B-25 relocated temporarily to Montpellier in the south of France, to get some flying shots bathed in sunshine. Awful weather, including sleet, ensured exterior shooting dragged on in England – at a daily cost of £55,000 – until the filming finally wrapped in September 1968. Battle of Britain features an impressive roster of British talent, a mixture of established thespians, war movie stalwarts and 1960s new faces. The film began shooting in March, but Saltzman only announced his cast on 2 May 1968. Laurence Olivier played Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding (a role originally to have been played by Alec Guinness), Ralph Richardson was Sir David Kelly (British Minister to Switzerland), Patrick Wymark was Air Vice Marshall Traﬀord Leigh-Mallory, Michael Redgrave played Air Vice Marshal Evill and Kenneth More appeared as Group Captain Baker.

Rex Harrison was originally going to play Park, but had to drop out when weather delays pushed the filming dates back. Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Barry Foster and Ian McShane played the RAF’s finest pilots. Most notable was Robert Shaw as ace squadron leader ‘Skipper’. The idle boredom of waiting for the next ‘scramble’ is well illustrated – a Polish pilot reads 1000 Words in English – and the cast model authentic RAF leather flying jackets, white polo necks and blue uniforms. The problem with this all-star-casting during the aerial combat scenes was noted by Time’s reviewer: ‘Once they are airborne and covered with goggles and oxygen masks, it is impossible to distinguish between any of the actors’. Amongst the German contingent, Curd Jürgens played Baron Von Richter, Karl Otto Alberty played Jeschonnek, a Luftwaﬀe strategist, and Dietrich Frauboes played Field Marshal Milch, who arrives by Junkers and Mercedes to inspect the rows of Heinkels during Maurice Binder’s colourful title sequence. Hein Riess (better known as a music hall singer in Hamburg) was a moonfaced caricature of Göring, who arrives in the Pas-de-Calais in September 1940 to oversee the invasion and who loses his jovial demeanour when his beloved Luftwaﬀe is dismantled. Having berated his commanders, he leaves on a train to report the bad news to the Führer. Subplots on terra firma – including the troubled relationship between Squadron Leader Colin Harvey (Christopher Plummer) and his wife, WAAF Section Oﬃcer Maggie Harvey (Susannah York) – don’t detract from the action. The pilots and WAAFs socialise in the ‘Jackdaw Inn’, Denton, near Canterbury, and the LDV drill outside the pub before popping in for a pint. Only York’s 1960s-style blonde bob conspicuously lacks the film’s visual authenticity. The moment when Maggie, having just met a facially disfigured RAF assistant controller, learns that Colin has been badly burned in a crash, is the most moving scene in the film. The controller she meets, Squadron Leader Tom Evans, was played by Bill Foxley, himself a WWII RAF pilot whose hands and face were severely burned in a plane crash. Due to the pioneering, untried plastic surgery that rebuilt his face and hands, he was a member of the so-called Guinea Pig Club. Air Chief Marshal Dowding visited the Pinewood set and was reduced to tears when he viewed rushes of the movie. In a separate incident, RAF hero Douglas Bader and other RAF veterans refused to meet with Luftwaﬀe pilots. Twenty-eight years later, the RAF were not yet ready to ‘forgive and forget’ – they didn’t want the widows and children of RAF pilots killed in action to see them ‘carousing with their murderers’. Even by 1968 it seems that for those who took part in the conflict, it was too soon to make peace with their ‘enemies’. War heroes like Bader felt that a film of the Battle of Britain might demean their victory, at a time when Germany’s role in the war was being re-evaluated. He certainly didn’t want to be seen as their ‘friends’ and would reiterate to anyone listening ‘We won!’ Bader needn’t have worried. Battle of Britain is historical storytelling of the highest order, with great attention to detail – even down to the array of vintage cars and trucks on display. The film was shot in Panavision and Technicolor by Freddie Young. Key moments from the battle, including Eagle Day and Hitler’s London blunder, are restaged on a grand scale. The Eagle Day attacks on RAF\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 20\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:07 PM\n\nTHE WAR IN THE SKIES (1940–45)\n\n21\n\nairfields is a spectacular sequence, with the German bombs raining fire down on the aerodromes, as the pilots scramble to take oﬀ. No expense was spared – there’s even one of Hitler’s rousing speeches restaged in showbiz Nazi style. The aerial sequences are the greatest World War II dogfights in cinema. Cameras were fitted to Messerschmitts, Spitfires and Heinkels, but most of the aerial filming was carried out by a customised twin-engined B-25 Mitchell Bomber, specially adapted as a camera plane, which was piloted by John R. Hawkes. The onboard cameramen in this ‘flying studio’ were Skeets Kelly and Johnny Jordon. The film’s assistant director Derek Cracknell dubbed the Mitchell ‘The Psychedelic Monster’ due to the multicoloured paint job on its fuselage. Spitfires and Hurricanes swoop in picturesquely executed arabesques, filmed against magnificent cloud formations, as they attack the German Heinkels and their fighter escorts – unleashing hails of machine-gun bullets and spitting death at the push of a button. Stricken aircraft tailspin towards earth, a trail of smoke charting their last desperate flight, until they disintegrate on impact in showering explosions. Many of the aerial duels, heavenly and ethereal in their beauty, were filmed above the clouds, or else over the patchwork quilt of farmland or the rolling Channel. The special eﬀects work is above average, with row upon row of German aircraft in attacking formation. In addition to the shots of real planes, many scale models and matte shots were used, particularly when the burning planes explode in mid-air, or crash into the Channel. The Stuka attack on a coastal radar station has real Spitfires pitted against model Stukas. During the battle over London, a German He-111 bomber crashes into a railway station, while another makes it back to the German invasion fleet’s harbour, trailing smoke. RAF Sergeant Pilot Andy (Ian McShane) returns from helping the emergency services to discover the church hall ‘rest centre’ where his wife and sons were sheltering is now a burning ruin. In a lighter moment, pilot oﬃcer Archie (Edward Fox) parachutes to safety and flattens a gardener’s glass and timber flower cloche. A little boy appears and oﬀers him a cigarette: ‘Thanks awfully old chap!’ coos Archie. The Canadians, Poles and Czechs who flew with the RAF are mentioned in the film and a downed Polish pilot who parachutes into English farmland is mistaken by a pikel-wielding yokel for a German. There are other moments of cinematic beauty, as in the depiction of the Blitz attacks on the London docklands, glowing red on the horizon – a burnished, burning Waterloo Sunset. The score, by Ron Goodwin, is one of his finest. Goodwin excelled in the war genre, with memorable contributions for Operation Crossbow, 633 Squadron and Where Eagles Dare. His rousing themes include an echo of ‘Deutchland Über Alles’ for the Luftwaﬀe. The film was originally to have been scored by Sir William Walton and conducted by Malcolm Arnold, but Saltzman rejected this music. Only Walton’s darting ‘Battle in the Air’ can be heard in the finished film, during the RAF’s defeat of the Luftwaﬀe on 15 September. This scene is played with Walton’s score alone (no overlaid plane engines or sound eﬀects) and is a fitting climax to the film. Walton’s score has now been restored and there is a version of the film on DVD with his music in place of Goodwin’s. Battle of Britain was released by United Artists in the UK in September 1969 rated U and in the USA in October. It was less-than-successful, losing UA $10 million.\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 21\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:07 PM\n\n22\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nBut reviewers who complained about the film’s lack of pace and plot missed the point. With the array of vintage aircraft, the cast is almost incidental and in the era of CGI action films, Battle of Britain’s authenticity soars high as a great filmmaking achievement. The Battle of Britain also features in Enzo Castellari’s Eagles Over London (1969 – Battle Squadron and Battle Command), produced by Edmondo Amati. Its original title, La battaglia d’Inghilterra, translates as ‘The Battle of England’ – presumably to cash in on Hamilton’s film. German SS commandos under fanatical Major Krueger (Luigi Pistilli) disguise themselves as British Tommies and are evacuated back to England from Dunkirk. Their sabotage mission is to destroy a powerful radar station in Portsmouth and to overwhelm the control centre for Allied aerial operations, in preparation for Hitler’s invasion, here codenamed ‘Marine Lion’ (a mistranslation of Seelöwe). Captain Paul Stevens (Frederick Staﬀord) organises Operation Valiant to track down the German agents in London. Castellari partly filmed on location in London, including Tower Bridge and Westminster. Hitler orders his Luftwaﬀe to attack, but it is repulsed by the RAF. In retaliation for the Allied bombing of Berlin, the Germans turn their attention to London and 15 September 1940 is designated ‘Day of the Eagle’, an allout attack on the capital (hence the film’s title). Stevens is involved in a tug-oflove struggle for RAF Lieutenant Meg Jones (Evelyn Stewart) with Air Marshal George Taylor (Van Johnson). Stevens is befriended by Lieutenant Martin Donovan (Francisco Rabal), one of the German commandos, who rooms with him in London. Krueger’s men successfully blow up the radar tower at Portsmouth and infiltrate the RAF’s operations control room at RAF Bentley Priory, but in a shoot-out Stevens and his men scupper their plans, while the RAF are victorious in the skies. Air Marshal Taylor is shot down and killed during the Battle of Britain, leaving Stevens and Meg together for the fade-out in a railway station where they listen to Churchill’s famous ‘Never in the field of human conflict’ speech broadcast over a tannoy. Just as Sergio Leone’s western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) recreated the American Civil War, Italian-style, Castellari’s Eagles Over London restages Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain on a grand scale. Like Battle of Britain location scenes involving hundreds of extras were shot largely in Spain. Francesco De Masi provided the rousing score and Alejandro Ulloa’s impressive widescreen cinematography is lost in cropped prints, especially the scenes when Castellari deploys groovy 1960s split-screen eﬀects. Alberto De Martino was slated to direct the film, but Castellari convinced the producer Amati to hire him by screening split-screen footage which used a mixture of recreations and tinted archive footage. Castellari and Tito Carpi wrote the convoluted story in one week in a Madrid hotel. It was one of the most expensive Italian films ever made up to that time and was a massive success domestically, though it was never released theatrically in the USA. Castellari’s film is a comic-book depiction of 1940s Britain, which mixes thriller elements with wartime action. The Home Front subterfuge leads one British soldier to moan, ‘This ain’t a war, it’s a crossword puzzle’.

Eduardo Fajardo was the German general overseeing Operation Marine Lion and Renzo Palmer played Stevens’ cockney sidekick, Sergeant Donald Mulligan. The film features numerous scenes depicting aerial combat over the Channel and London, while the bombing of London by the Luftwaﬀe is depicted via archive footage combined with staged shots of burning buildings. The model and eﬀects work for the dogfights at Cinecittà Studios was by Spanish special eﬀects master Emilio Ruiz Del Rio (of Conan the Barbarian, Dune and Pan’s Labyrinth). Numerous historical details are wrong, including the odd selection of planes that are deployed as the RAF and the Luftwaﬀe (with Hurricanes repainted with German livery). When the German commandos attack the Portsmouth radar installation they pack their knapsacks with dynamite and become human bombs. Murdered Allied soldiers are discovered across London with their identities stolen. A love scene between Stevens and Meg is filmed in a darkened room sporadically illuminated with flashes, as the Germans bomb London. A scene when Stevens’ men corner a German commando on a London rooftop plays like a wild-west gunfight, and the numerous fistfights recall ex-stuntman Castellari’s penchant for action. When a German commando is captured, what else can he do but commit suicide in time-honoured war movie cliché fashion, by taking a Cyanide capsule? The London Blitz began in September 1940, but the night raids over the city continued during November and December 1940. ‘Science fiction’ visions of the future such as Things to Come (1936) and Q Planes (1937 – Clouds Over Europe) had predicted the bombing of Britain before war had broken out. Midnight Menace (1937) even featured bomb-laden pilotless planes years before the V-1 ‘Doodlebugs’ were launched by Germany against British cities. Key German targets included Birmingham, Plymouth, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiﬀ, Southampton, Sheﬃeld and Bristol. Five hundred bombers\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 23\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:07 PM\n\n24\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nattacked Coventry on 14 and 15 November 1940, destroying a third of the city’s houses and killing 600 people. ‘Coventrize’ came to mean the levelling of a city in one raid and by the end of the Blitz in 1941, 40,000 British civilians had been killed. The figures could have been much higher however. Prior to Germany’s aerial attacks on Britain, millions of civilians, including many children, were relocated from cities and industrial targets, to rural communities. The nine-minute documentary London Can Take It (1940) was propaganda for US audiences. It depicted one day in the life of London during the Blitz. Its US release title, Britain Can Take It, was somewhat inappropriate, as Britain could take it, but it could do with America’s help. In Which We Serve depicted the bombing of Plymouth. Confirm or Deny (1941) looked at the dark days of the Blitz and Operation Sealion, via a tale of espionage, while John Boorman’s semiautobiographical Hope and Glory (1987) depicted life during the Blitz. The UK TV drama series Danger UXB (1979) followed bomb disposal engineer teams diffusing unexploded bombs in England, during the Blitz and thereafter. The interestingly offbeat It Happened Here (1963) was a mockumentary of ‘what ifs’, had Hitler invaded and Britain succumbed to fascism. On the Home Front, audience morale was kept up by comedy thrillers such as Cottage to Let (1941 – starring Leslie Banks) and by George Formby vehicles such as Let George Do It (1940), wherein ukulele-playing cheeky chappy George slaps Hitler during a rally. Alfred Hitchcock’s Foreign Correspondent (1940 – starring Joel McCrea) was pro-British propaganda for American audiences disguised as a spy thriller, exhorting them to join the war. According to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005), the Pevensie children, four evacuees, discover the country of Narnia in an item of furniture. George More O’Ferrall’s Angels One Five (1953) was a monochrome British production shot on location at RAF Kenley, south of London. The fictional story begins in June 1940 and continues into the Battle of Britain. RAF pilots used their own slang jargon – ‘bandits’ were enemy aircraft, ‘pancake’ meant they were to land immediately and ‘angels’ was the height at which they flew in thousands of feet. Scottish Pilot Oﬃcer T.B. Baird, nicknamed ‘Septic’ (John Gregson) joins the RAF ‘Pimpernel’ squadron stationed at RAF Neethley (part of Fighter Command Group 11) commanded by Group Commander ‘Tiger’ Small (Jack Hawkins). Baird announces his arrival at the airfield by ‘pranging’ his Hurricane when he crashes into a house. The film depicts life at the aerodrome through various protagonists: the WAAFs (members of the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force) and other staﬀ of the Operations Room bunker (with its charts, radar and glass war map), flying ace Flight Lieutenant ‘Batchy’ Salter (Humphrey Lestocq), Squadron Leader Bill Ponsford (Andrew Osborn) and Betty Carfax (Veronica Hurst), Baird’s love interest. Michael Denison was particularly good as Peter Moon, formerly commander of the Operations Room who takes over as squadron leader when Ponsford is killed. Denison’s wife Dulcie Gray played nurse, Nadine Clinton, the ‘lady with the lamp’ – a guiding light for pilots landing on the airfield by night. Much of Angels One Five’s aerial action occurs oﬀscreen, with events mapped out on the Operation Room’s war boards, or else seen as distant vapour trails and\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 24\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:08 PM\n\nTHE WAR IN THE SKIES (1940–45)\n\n25\n\nWAAFs in the Operations Room at RAF Neethley await news of an impeding Luftwaffe attack in George More O’Ferrall’s Angels One Five (1953).

In the film’s most memorable scenes, the airfield is devastated and the Operations Room suﬀers a direct hit, causing the hefty reinforced ceiling to collapse, a dusty tangle of concrete and twisted metal. The German planes are unconvincing special eﬀect animation and matte shots, and the Spitfires are newsreel footage, but the film does have real Hurricanes, courtesy of the Portuguese Air Force. The stop-start life of the pilots is well depicted, their quiet moments interrupted by the scramble to ‘action stations’. Planes return from sorties, shot up, low on juice, to patch up and refuel before returning to the fray. The film’s ending is particularly powerful: as Betty prepares for her first night out with ‘Septic’ in Maidstone, it becomes apparent that he won’t be making their date. No matter how depressing or downbeat the subject matter, most British RAF films deploy a chirpy score, in this case composed by John Wooldridge. For its simplicity and convincing performances, this remains one of the finest films to feature the Few, and aptly depicts that ‘waiting was the worst part of war’. The melodramatic Dangerous Moonlight (1941 – Suicide Squadron), another film that depicted the Few, is best remembered now for Richard Addinsell’s melodramatic piano composition ‘Warsaw Concerto’. Britain’s air war also features in Pearl Harbor (2001). Hotshot US pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Aﬄeck) is transferred to the RAF in 1941 before the US has entered the war and dogfights with the Luftwaﬀe, where he’s shot down over the English Channel and presumed lost.

Leslie Howard’s The First of the Few (1942 – Spitfire) recounted the career of R.J. Mitchell, the aeronautical engineer who designed the Supermarine Spitfire, the fastest and best fighter of the war. The film begins on ‘Zero Day, 15 September 1940’ as RAF pilot Geoﬀrey Crisp (David Niven) tells his fellow fliers the story of how the Spitfire was developed. This includes interesting archive footage of the Schneider Cup seaplane races in the 1920s, which were won by the Supermarine S-6. A chance pre-war meeting between Messerschmitt (Erik Freund) and Mitchell in Germany at the Richthofen Club convinces Mitchell to develop the Supermarine as a fighter plane (‘a spitfire bird’), with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines and Crisp – his race-winning pilot from Schneider Cup days – as his test pilot. Mitchell died from cancer in 1937 and never lived to see his creation’s success at war. Rosamund John played long-suﬀering Diana Mitchell and producer-director Leslie Howard played Mitchell himself. First of the Few turned out to be the last of the lot for Howard: he was shot down and killed by German fighters on his way back from Lisbon in 1943. Lewis Gilbert’s Reach for the Sky (1956), a Rank Organisation release, was the screen biography of Douglas Bader and was based on the book by Paul Brickhill. Bader lost both legs below the knee in a biplane accident in 1931 but through Herculean determination, courage and perseverance, he became an RAF pilot, serving with distinction in the Battle of Britain and rising to the rank of Wing Commander. His prescient tactics, involving five squadrons of fighters (the so-called Duxford Wing) helped to win the battle. Kenneth More’s moving, aﬀably real portrayal of the war hero was instrumental in making the film a box oﬃce hit in Britain. It was filmed at RAF Kenley, Surrey and at Pinewood\n\nKenneth More as Douglas Bader, the RAF ace, in a publicity portrait for Lewis Gilbert’s Reach for the Sky (1956).

Much of the film details Bader’s poignant relationship with his wife Thelma (Muriel Pavlow) and the tribulations of his rehabilitation. He was fitted with two artificial limbs (which earned him the nickname ‘Tinlegs’ Bader) and painstakingly learned to walk. This results in some rather odd dialogue – a flier colleague rouses Bader from his sleep to fly a sortie over the Dunkirk evacuation with, ‘Come on Douglas, get your legs on’. The film’s clichéd depiction of pipe-smoking chaps and their prim, wellmannered love interests has dated badly, but the true-life drama of the story wins through. Originally 136 minutes, it was abridged for US release to 123 minutes. The battle footage is a combination of re-enactments (featuring real Hawker Hurricanes), model work and excellent aerial newsreel footage. Bader was later shot down over Occupied France, losing one of his artificial legs in the process, and the Germans allowed him to have a replacement flown in. They soon wished they hadn’t, as Bader mounted three escape attempts from various prison camps. Eventually incarcerated in Colditz Castle, he was liberated by American forces in the spring of 1945. On 15 September 1945 – the five-year anniversary of the Battle of Britain – Bader led 12 survivors from the battle at the head of an immense fly-past over London. As the war progressed, the Allies engaged in a sustained campaign of Strategic Bombing of targets in Europe, as a way of depleting German resources and morale, and in retaliation for the Blitz. The US Army Air Force (USAAF) carried out daylight bombing raids in their Boeing B-17 and B-24 Liberator bombers, while RAF Bomber Command carried out night-time raids (after daylight attacks became too costly) in Avro Lancasters and Wellingtons. In February 1942, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris (known as ‘Butch’ by his men) ordered the bombing of German cities, a tactic that helped shorten the war, but was criticised on moral grounds in some quarters and earned him the nickname ‘Bomber Harris’. The first ‘thousand bomber’ raid was on Cologne in May 1942, but the most controversial raids were the night raid on Hamburg in July 1943 (where the planes also confused the German radar by dropping strips of tinfoil, called ‘Window’) and the infamous attack on Dresden. On the night of 13–14 February 1944, this raid killed thousands of civilians when the bombs and incendiaries created a huge inferno, a firestorm of such ferocity that it sucked the oxygen out of the air and suﬀocated victims in their shelters. Twelve O’Clock High (1949) starred Gregory Peck as Brigadier General Frank Savage, the commander of daylight saturation bombing raids from Archbury airfield into Europe in 1942–43. Savage replaces Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) who has begun to care too much for his men’s welfare and cracks under the strain. Savage’s rod of iron is intended to whip the 918th Bomb Group into shape – ‘Consider yourselves already dead’ he tells his pilots – but he too begins to push himself and his men to the limit, resulting in Savage’s mental and physical collapse. All the air raid footage, of the American bombers coming under attack by German fighters during their operations over Germany, is archive filmed by the USAAF and the Luftwaﬀe. The scene where a B-17 crash lands and skids on its belly was staged especially for the film, with pilot Paul Mantz earning $4,500 for the risky stunt. Peck took the lead role after it had been turned down by John\n\nHowardHughes_Book.indd 27\n\n12/20/2011 12:43:11 PM\n\n28\n\nWhen Eagles Dared\n\nWayne and his towering performance is one of Peck’s finest. He was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award, but the cast is uniformly good. Millard Mitchell played General Pritchard and Hugh Marlowe was shirker, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Dean Jagger, as WWI veteran Major Stovall, won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Henry King’s popular film was based on Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay Jr’s 1948 novel of the same title and deployed 12 real B-17 Flying Fortresses for the airfield scenes, which were shot at Ozark Airfield, Alabama and RAF Barford St John Air Base, England. In Powell and Pressburger’s One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1941), a bomber crew bail out over Holland after a raid on Stuttgart and the locals help the RAF men make their way back to Blighty. The film never quite matches the eeriness of its opening scene, as crewless Wellington bomber ‘B for Bertie’ returns across the North Sea and crashes into a pylon. Erich Von Stroheim Jr and Boris Sagal’s The Thousand Plane Raid (1969), starring Christopher George, Ben Murphy and Bo Hopkins, was based on the bombing of Cologne in 1942. Memphis Belle (1990), starring Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Billy Zane and Harry Connick Jr, re-enacted the famous 25th daylight bombing mission over Germany by the title B-17, which was named after pilot Robert Morgan’s girlfriend. David Niven played an RAF pilot in Powell and Pressburger’s best film, A Matter of Life and Death (1946), which was intended to encourage post-war transatlantic amity. Whilst returning from a one-thousand-plane bombing raid over Europe, Squadron Leader Peter D. Carter (Niven), a poet, bails out from his stricken Lancaster over a fog-shrouded Channel. Before he jumps, Peter has a long conversation with American radio operator June (Kim Hunter). Peter wakes up on a beach, meets June and they fall in love. But it appears that there has been a mistake in Heaven and Peter should have died. This leads to a Heavenly court case: Department of Records versus Squadron Leader Peter Carter. On Earth, Dr Frank Reeves , the physician who attempts to cure Peter of brain damage, headaches and hallucinations, is killed in a motorbike accident and becomes Peter’s defence council in Heaven, where his key piece of evidence is one of June’s tears on a pink rose. Roger Livesey played Dr Reeves, Richard Attenborough can be seen briefly as a deceased RAF pilot and Marius Goring played Heavenly messenger Conductor 71, who must convince Peter to return to Heaven. Raymond Massey was Abraham Farlan, the prosecuting council, who is eventually defeated as the power of love triumphs over all. The film’s celebrated scenes of an immense escalator leading up to Heaven inspired the film’s retitling in the USA, Stairway to Heaven. Filmed in monochrome (for the Heaven scenes) and Technicolor (for Earth) by Jack Cardiﬀ, the film is a fantasy, a love story, a courtroom trial and a medical drama, but only briefly a war film. Anthony Asquith’s The Way to the Stars (1945 – Johnny in the Clouds in the USA) is the most reflective, nostalgic film to depict the wartime RAF and also the most moving. It was written by Terence Rattigan and producer Anatole De Grunwald. Set at ‘Halfpenny Field’, an airstrip in Yorkshire (filmed at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire) it begins with RAF crews flying B"
