There are many many universes where the Crimson Axis won but most universes are where Azur Lane won\" Screen says\n\n\"That's.. quite shocking to learn. I thought it was almost impossible for the Axis to win...\" Akagi says\n\n\"I agree that it was shocking, but I think that it was possible if the leaders of the Axis nations made good decisions during the war.\" August Von Parseval says\n\n\"Are there a limited amount of universes?\" Vittorio Veneto asks\n\n\"No, there is no limit. There are an infinite amount of altered histories with an INFINITE amount of possibilities. For example, a universe where the nations were the exact opposite with the Axis powers fighting for rights and freedom, then Azur Lane fighting for a dream of tyranny. More examples of universes are where mythological creatures exist, and fantasy can become reality. Hell, there are even universes where future kansens travel or are teleported back to the past to change it\" Screen states\n\nThe shipgirls were very shocked to learn this information, they were too stunned to speak. Others were busy imagining what the other possibilities are and if they exist as a universe\n\n\"Surprising isn't it. Anyway, the only difficulty I had was to pick which alter-alternate universe you react. Thankfully that problem was solved, let's start now\"\n\nThe video starts as the preview shows\n\n\"WARNING:\n\nThis tape discusses topics that some might find unsettling. Viewer discretion is advised\"\n\nThe shipgirls prepare themselves, the guardians of the younglings prepare too just in case"
