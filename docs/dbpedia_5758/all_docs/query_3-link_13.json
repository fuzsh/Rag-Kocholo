        "text": "The Second World War broke out in 1939.\n\nOn 9 April, 1940, Germany invaded Norway. After two months, the Germans had conquered the country, and the King and the government fled to London in order to continue the fight from there.\n\nDuring the occupation, Norway was governed by the German Nazi Josef Terboven. All political parties were banned, except Nasjonal Samling, which was led by Vidkun Quisling.\n\nAs many as 44,000 Norwegians were held captive during the Second World War, 9,000 of which were sent to prisons and camps in Nazi-occupied areas, and 1,400 of whom perished.\n\nA total of 773 Jews in Norway were sent to concentration camps in Germany, of whom only 38 survived. Norway was occupied by the Germans until it was finally liberated in 1945."
