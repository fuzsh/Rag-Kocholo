They highlighted the need for changes in Skanska‚Äôs support organization to improve overall clarity of responsibilities, roles and coordination capabilities.\n\nThey signed the contract to scale AI Coaching to 10,000 people.\n\nFeedback from participants and L&D\n\n‚Äú\n\nThese sessions are very suitable for a time of reflection.
