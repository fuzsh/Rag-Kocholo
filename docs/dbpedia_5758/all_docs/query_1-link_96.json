        "text": "2. Story #3 Churchill Elected Prime Minister on 10th May 1940 28th May was a key date My Dad was conscripted Into the army that day\n\n3. WW2 Negotiation #1 28 May 1940 • Cabinet meeting to do a deal with Hitler • 5.00pm time out – resume at 7.00pm • Churchill spoke to each member of the cabinet separately • Agreement to continue the war 250,000 troops surrounded at Dunkirk\n\n4. 6P’s of Preparation Persuasion in big groups is difficult - beware of group think Take a time out / recess to reassess Pick people off one by one – “Coffee meetings” Learning Points\n\n5. WW2 Negotiation #2 • July 3rd 1940 – French fleet in Oran • Lunch time - “Sail to a US port or we will blow you up in six hours time” • French negotiators wouldn’t talk to British Negotiators. • French government promised to sail when the Germans were closer • Churchill ordered the sinking of the French fleet at 6.00pm\n\n6. 6P’s of Preparation – have a handle on everything Go and look for yourself Warn them – if the stakes are that high – take action Learning Points\n\n7. WW2 WW2 Negotiation #3 • December 7th 1941 – 7.55am Pearl Harbour bombed • Churchill immediately ordered the Navy to take him to USA (King George against it) • Told Clementine Churchill he was having Christmas in the White house • Rough 12 days across Atlantic • White House – asked to change bedrooms to be opposite Roosevelt. Eleanor not amused! • Addressed congress with an amazing speech\n\n8. DAD"
