        "text": "The recent experience with COVID-19, a pandemic that has further exposed the vulnerabilities of the poor in Philippine society, provides a socio-political and economic context for a reemphasis of the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines' (PCP II) Church of the Poor (COP). This paper argues that the crisis brought about by the pandemic affirms the importance of the COP but at the same time it provides a context to further deepen our understanding on what else can be done by a COP. To carry out the objective, Amartya Sen's definition of poverty that focuses on capabilities instead of income is used for synthetic analysis of poverty's face as it was experienced during the pandemic. This is used to further analyze how the Philippine Church can rekindle its commitment to be a Church of the Poor in the new normal.\n\nWho defines poverty? This short essay examines the variety of standards and measurement tools used by various governmental and non-governmental agencies in assessing poverty and its reduction. By examining various measurement tools through the lens of Catholic Social Teaching, one can better promote an assessment tool that recognizes aspects of full human life including social access, dignity of work, and agency while resisting a reduced assessment of simple possessive individualism and market markers. A paper written for an assignment at the Catholic Theological Union.\n\nThis essay brings Martha Nussbaum's politically liberal version of the Capabilities Approach (CA) to human development into critical dialogue with the Catholic Social Tradition (CST). Like CST, Nussbaum's focus on embodiment, dependence and dignity entails a social use of property which privileges marginalized people, and both theories explain the underdevelopment of central human capabilities in social rather than exclusively material terms. Whereas CST is metaphysically and theologically \" thick, \" however, CA is \" thin \" : its proponents positively eschew metaphysical commitments, believing a commitment to quasi-Rawlsian \" overlapping consensus \" is more consistent with political liberalism. This creates two tensions between CA and CST. The first is that CST understands the internal virtues of essentially social practices to be inseparable from their concrete instantiation in actual communities, while CA sometimes describes these virtues as political entitlements which can be supported independently of the comprehensive doctrines of particular communities. We argue, therefore, that CA's commitment to political liberalism tends to 'crowd out' particular conceptions of the good, such as those found in CST. Second, because CST recognizes a plurality of spiritual purposes of property that CA does not, including promotion of what Pope Benedict XVI calls the \" logic of gift, \" from the perspective of CST, CA will tend to be motivationally deficient in ways that negatively impact human development.\n\nThis article considers recent debates and conflicts between the Holy See and secular voices at the United Nations with regard to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and the language of gender. While recognising that Pope Francis has ushered in a more conciliatory and open approach to such issues, deep differences still remain over the nature and extent of rights in relation to issues of sexuality, procreation and gender. The author asks if the language of dignity rather than rights might afford a better perspective from which to approach these issues. Focusing in particular on the maternal capacity of the female body, the author explores the concept of dignity in Catholic social teaching, in engagement with Martha Nussbaum's feminist interpretation of Amartya Sen's capabilities approach. The author argues that the shared Aristotelian perspectives of Nussbaum and Catholic social teaching contribute to a rich dialogue between the two, but ultimately the Catholic understanding of dignity surpasses that of any secular theory of human rights or dignity, including that of Nussbaum, because it makes human dignity ontological and not dependent on either citizenship or rights.\n\nThe purpose of this conceptual paper is to expound on the concept of integrality or wholeness. It will provide a discussion of how integrality could be possessed and preserved and why it is important in an ever changing and demanding business and social environment. It will examine the phenomena of fragmentation, compartmentalization, and disintegration – the flipsides of integrality – and their consequences in business. This paper will also explain the need to re-visit the purpose of business and the distinction between its means and ends. Through an extensive review of literature, it will present the increasing need to promote the value of the human person and to put him at the center of organizational growth. It will also provide insights on how the call for greater humanism in business could be addressed. By looking at the case of the Institute for Integrality, Inc., it hopes to encourage more initiatives along the line of integral human development. By examining data that feature the responses and feedbacks of its clients, it aims to make an exposition of the prevailing degree of openness and receptivity of businesses and individuals to understand and practice integral human development."
