Drøbak Frogn Idrettslag participated in the Gothia Innebandy Cup in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Now it's almost time again. And they can barely wait.

If it was up to the players in Drøbak Frogn Idrettslag, they would have liked if the Gothia Innebandy Cup started already tomorrow. The tournament is a major highlight of the year for the Norwegians.

– It's like a World Championship for club teams, says the leader Glenn Christiansen.

He describes Drøbak Frogn Idrettslag as a small floorball club that has existed for just over 20 years.

– We are based in Drøbak, about 20 minutes outside Oslo and 45 minutes from Strömstad. Drøbak is a small town with about 13 000 people. The fact that we have played floorball for over 20 years is very good. Today we are around 80 players divided between four teams, says Glenn Christiansen.

Drøbak Frogn Idrettslag will participate with its B16 team in the Gothia Innebandy Cup in January. Most of the players in the team were born in either 2006 or 2007 but they also have one boy who was born in 2008 and one who was born as late as in 2009. They're currently 14 players in the team, which consists of two goalkeepers and 12 outfield players.

– We're a young team. Last year when we played in the B15 series, we also played our way up to the B16 division 1, which we won quite clearly. We took part in the Tigers Cup in Drammen, which we also won. We also played the final in a regional cup, says the leader.
