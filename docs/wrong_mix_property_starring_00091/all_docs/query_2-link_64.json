But things get out of hand when Benedict steals Danny’s magic ticket stub and transports himself into the real world, where crime can, and often does, pay.\n\nJack and Danny must leave fictional Los Angeles for real-life New York and battle the villains without the aid of movie magic or stuntmen…\n\nThe new 4K edition comes complete with the movie newly remastered in 4K resolution from the original camera negative, with HDR10 and all-new Dolby Atmos audio plus loads of bonus features including an audio commentary with John McTiernan and an alternate ending presented in 4K with HDR10.\n\nWant to be in with a chance of winning Last Action Hero on 4K?
