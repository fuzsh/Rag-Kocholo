        "text": "What a formula for success Last Action Hero was: the world’s biggest, most bankable film star. A mega budget. The director of Die Hard and Predator. And a genre-busting concept that was set to blast action cinema into the 21st Century.\n\nReleased on 18 June 1993, it was a box office disaster, pumped up on excess and self-perpetuating hype like one of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s giant biceps. But it could have been – and very nearly was – a work of postmodern genius.\n\nThe basic premise – a teenager is sucked into a movie and goes on an adventure with his favourite action star – was the idea of 22-year-old college graduates Zak Penn and Adam Leff, envisioned as a reverse of Woody Allen’s Purple Rose of Cairo, about a film character who steps through the fourth wall and into the real world. “The idea was that fully formed,” says Zak, who most recently wrote the screenplay for Spielberg’s similarly meta Ready Player One. “I was with Adam and some friends and just spat it out.”\n\nResearch for the film meant watching a truckload of action films and taking notes. To figure out the action genre rules – then break them like a nameless henchman’s neck – Zak and Adam made a checklist of conventions.\n\nThe script, originally titled “Extremely Violent”, riffed on the cop movie conventions of films like Lethal Weapon, and Arnie’s heavy artillery-toting characters from Commando, Predator, and Total Recall. The hero cop – named Arno Slater – was bluntly drawn as one-dimensional thicko who blows the place up first, asks questions later. He’s in a perpetual state of being kicked off the case for not going by the rulebook, while drug dealers repeatedly kidnap his poor wife. When 15-year-old Danny is sucked into the movie, his knowledge of the action genre makes him the brains of the outfit.\n\nIt’s impossible to read the Arno character in any voice except the real-life Schwarzenegger’s (“You forgot your validation,” he deadpans after blowing away some goon in a car park). When Columbia bought the script, Arnie was the only choice. As detailed in the book Hit & Run by Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters, Columbia chiefs were so keen to secure Schwarzenegger’s box office muscle they paid him $15 million, and gave him unprecedented stroke as an executive producer. Arnie approved his Predator director John McTiernan and wanted Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black to do a rewrite.\n\n“We weren’t sure if he was going to rewrite it or work with us,” says Zak. “We went to this one big meeting with Schwarzenegger and Shane and all these other people, which was this crazy, outsized Hollywood experience in Schwarzenegger’s office. That was surreal.”\n\nThe Hollywood experience didn’t last long. “They didn’t even pay us to do a rewrite,” says Zak. “They just fired us and Shane and David Arnott wrote it from there. Shane kept us up to date for a while to tell us what was going on. We realised, ‘I guess this is the way Hollywood works’ and moved onto to our next script.”\n\nProduction was a mess. Shane Black and David Arnott were also fired, and William Goldman paid a hefty $1 million for yet another rewrite; the budget rocketed from $60 million to a reported $87 million (plus $30 million on marketing); and a disastrous test screening led to emergency brainstorms into the early hours and hasty reshoots.\n\nTo make things worse, Universal had announced that Jurassic Park – a surefire box office smash that had been 65 million years in the making – would open on 11 June, just one week ahead of Last Action Hero. Columbia studio head Mark Canton (given the boot several years later after a string of flops) stuck stubbornly to the release date, giving John McTiernan just weeks to edit. Hype and ego took precedence; Columbia sank $500,000 into advertising the film on the side of a space shuttle – a literally out-of-this-world marketing stunt that was scrapped before release.\n\nZak and Adam Leff had no idea that things had become turbulent, though they badgered producers and turned up on set. “I would call the studio execs and tell them what I thought was wrong with the story,” says Zak. “I can’t believe they didn’t hang up on me. Why were they talking to the original writer? We would find out where the shooting was and go, and everyone would look at us awkwardly. Now if I got fired and they totally rewrote the movie, I’d never show up at the set! In retrospect that seems willfully naive.”\n\nAcross the various rewrites, from the first draft of Extremely Violent to the finished version (or as finished as it would ever be) of Last Action Hero, there were Austrian Oak-sized changes. Arno is renamed Jack. Danny (played by Austin O’Brien) spends the story trying to convince Jack he’s a movie character – even taking him to a video store, where they find a bizarre world Terminator 2 starring Sylvester Stallone – before they return to reality, where Jack comes face-to-face with the real Schwarzenegger at the premiere of his latest movie.\n\n“You have brought me nothing but pain,” quips Slater. There’s also a cartoon detective cat (“We didn’t see that cartoon cat on set,” laughs Zak); an out-of-place set piece about a dead body full of toxic gas, which is just an excuse for a protracted fart joke. It reeks of a confused creative process that’s been tossed between too many pairs of hands. Big mistake, as Jack Slater would say.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the name Extremely Violent that was scrubbed, but the actual violence; the face-melting, bone-snapping, and merciless gunning down of the first draft was ditched in favour of a more lucrative PG-13 rating. Arnie even shot down flame thrower and missile launcher accessories for his action figure line. “That was OK for the Arnold of the eighties,” he said, as reported in Hit & Run, “but not the Arnold of the nineties.”\n\nThe knives were out for Last Action Hero before release, with rumours of the disaster screening and troubled production hitting the trades. It opened to a crushing weekend box office of $15.3 million, while Jurassic Park was a monster hit: a $47 million opening weekend.\n\n“It's largely unedited and large portions of it still appear exactly as it was when it left the camera,” John McTiernan told Variety several years later. “There's a really neat movie in there. In order to get a sense of fun that was clear to the audience, it needed tightening, and it needed another month in editing to do that.”\n\nBut there are flashes of underappreciated brilliance: Charles Dance’s glass-eyed henchman, Mr Benedict; Arnie’s best comic performance by a mile, calling himself, “The famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger”; real-world Arnie being berated by his wife for shamelessly plugging Planet Hollywood on the red carpet; and Jack somberly deconstructing the life of an action hero: his imminent death (“Not until the grosses go down,” replies Danny) and how baddies hiding in his closet every single day, who he has to shoot routinely, is costing him a fortune in doors.\n\nFor Zak, the biggest problem was making Slater a rounded, three-dimensional character. “I’ll fall on my sword about the fact he should be kind of stupid and not self-aware,” he says. “That’s what makes it work. Our version was unthinkingly going around shooting people. He’s good at his job, but not a deep character. Shane writes deep characters, that’s what he does. They turned him – and I think this is what Arnold wanted, to be fair – into a Shane Black character. Slater has a kid who dies in the opening scene, he’s got an ex-wife, and he’s smarter than the people around him. Now he feels as real as characters in the real world.”\n\nBut with 25-plus years’ hindsight, Zak stresses he’s not bashing Shane Black (not anymore, at least). Zak knows a lot more now about screenwriting and how the industry works.\n\n“I was pissed at Shane,” admits Zak. “But the truth is I’m a great admirer of his work. I think he knows that – I’ve run into him a bunch of times since. I’m 50 now and I look back and realise he was around 29 at the time, so my feelings have softened. He was being rewritten too. Nobody wants to hear another writer’s complaints when you’ve been fired from a movie yourself. In retrospect, he was going through a hell of his own. And looking back, it’s true that our script needed a lot of work. It was out first script! It wasn’t perfect.”\n\nBut maybe the writer of Lethal Weapon wasn’t the right man for the job. “They hired the people who created the genre that we were mocking,” says Zak. “The director of Die Hard, the writer of Lethal Weapon, and Arnie himself. It was written as a love letter to those movies, but turned into something made by people who knew those movies too well. You can feel that. There’s a cynicism to the movie that seeps through – that’s not what we intended. But actually, that’s what makes it interesting. Now it seems bizarrely confrontational – like it’s daring the audience not to like it.”\n\nIt may have originally been Extremely Violent, but Last Action Hero was an apt title – as were Arnie’s comments about 1980s Arnold vs 1990s Arnold. His previous four films had made a staggering $1 billion; he was bulletproof. True to the word of his famous catchphrase, Arnie was back the year after Last Action Hero with James Cameron’s action mega-hit True Lies. But it was a momentary comeback.\n\nThey say every movie cycle ends with parody, and – intentionally or not – Last Action Hero marked a shift in the action genre. Speed raced along two years later (at 50mph-plus) and the genre replaced musclebound heroes with high concepts. The hyper-masculine icons of action’s pneumatic, oversized era became dinosaurs. Maybe it was Arnie’s run of throwaway actioners – End of Days, Collateral Damage, and Eraser. Or maybe it was playing a pregnant man in Junior. Big mistake."
