        "text": "Almost a month late saying this, but The Weekly Gravy is now three years old! I didn’t think to mark the occasion, but I’m pretty happy I’ve kept it up this long. Here’s to another year!\n\nLast Action Hero (1993) – ***\n\nI suspect I’d have a lot more affection for Last Action Hero if I’d seen it 20 years ago. Not only would its embryonic attempts at self-aware parody have seemed fresher, but I would’ve been the right age to overlook its weaknesses and embrace what it does best – or at least what it does most. While other films about the line between cinema and reality may come to mind – The Purple Rose of Cairo seems especially apt – I was more reminded of Black Dynamite, a film which may not spill the banks of reality, but which was designed, in its director’s words, to be “just a little too badass.”\n\nJack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a little too badass. He pulls off tremendous feats of badassery (often defying his superiors in the process), always has a snarky quip ready, prefers a comically huge handgun but carries a full arsenal on him at all times, and always comes out on top. That’s why Danny Madigan (Austin O’Brien) adores him, and would rather live in the fantasy of the Slater films than in the drudgery of early 90s New York, much to his mother’s (Mercedes Ruehl) chagrin.\n\nSo when Nick (Robert Prosky), the projectionist at Danny’s favorite theater – an old movie palace on the verge of being converted into a multiplex – offers him a sneak preview of Jack Slater IV, he leaps at the opportunity. He’s less impressed by the supposedly magic ticket Nick gives him (a gift from Harry Houdini), but during the movie, as Jack is in a car chase with Mafia goons, Danny finds himself in the backseat of Jack’s convertible, quite genuinely transported into its too-badass world.\n\nHe can’t convince the exasperated Jack that they’re in a movie, no matter how many unrealities he points out (my favorite being Whiskers, the cartoon cat cop voiced by Danny DeVito), but he is able to persuade him and his superior Lt. Dekker (Frank McRae) that he has information about mob boss Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) and his henchman Benedict (Charles Dance), who are responsible for killing Jack’s favorite second cousin (Art Carney).\n\nBenedict soon establishes himself as the primary threat – he has, in fact, grown quite weary of Vivaldi’s bumbling leadership – and when he gets hold of Danny’s ticket, he finds himself able to cross over into our reality, where the rules of action movies don’t apply, and where, as he’ll later declare, “the bad guys can win!” Danny and Jack are able to follow him, but between coming to grips with his own unreality and with the limitations of our world, Jack’s going to have a much harder time ensuring his customary victory.\n\nAs a deconstruction of the action film genre, Last Action Hero tends to feel like it’s trying to do something the filmmakers don’t quite have the toolkit for. Yes, Danny lampshades any number of tropes – the scene where he realizes he can’t pull off Jack’s daredevilry because he’s only the “comedy sidekick” is a key example – but the script, co-written by Shane Black (who’d helped codify the very genre the film is ribbing) doesn’t quite split the difference between lampshading a trope and truly subverting it.\n\nPart of the problem is Danny himself. He’s very much in the early 90s tradition of hip, wisecracking kids, and while O’Brien’s performance is solid enough, one gets rather tired of his smug jibes after a while. Another part is the ticket itself – it’s the kind of magical object that works exactly how the plot needs it to work, and in the third act its abilities border on the arbitrary. I don’t object to The Seventh Seal‘s Death (played by Ian McKellen, no less) stepping off the screen, but the way it’s handled, and the way he helps to resolve the story, feel like an ass-pull.\n\nThere’s certainly entertainment to be had here. Director John McTiernan pulls off some good action set pieces, especially the chase Danny finds himself drawn into and a showdown in Slater’s ex-wife’s house which allows his comparably savvy daughter Whitney (Bridgette Wilson) to kick some ass of her own. And it has some genuinely funny moments, thanks to McRae’s screaming bluster, Dance’s crisply enunciated comic villainy, and Schwarzenegger’s good-natured spoofing of his persona (the parody of Hamlet is a particular highlight).\n\nBut seeing it now, 30 years after it its troubled production and initial, disappointing run, and nearly as long since it was rehabilitated as a film ahead of its time, I see it as a noble effort that doesn’t cut deep enough to work as a satire, and is any case less fun and funny than a lot of ostensibly straightforward genre films – McTiernan’s own Die Hard, to name but one. It’s hard enough to spoof someone else’s genre – but how many filmmakers have managed to successfully spoof their own?\n\nScore: 67\n\nGran Turismo (2023) – **½\n\nAs critical as I can be, I really don’t ask that much of a movie. I only want to be able to care about what’s happening, whether it’s the characters, the story/themes, or the execution that’s meant to hold my interest the most. Obviously, it’s optimal if a film can compel the attention in all three departments, and Neill Blomkamp’s first film, District 9, did pretty well for itself. I cared about Wikus because he was a well-crafted character undergoing a harrowing ordeal, I cared about Wikus and the prawns being able to counter the oppression of the South African government, and I cared about how Blomkamp combined a grounded approach with incredible special effects (especially given the budget) to tell his story.\n\nDistrict 9 isn’t a perfect film, and some of its shortcomings (especially in terms of narrative logic) would spiral out of control in Blomkamp’s next two films; Elysium was fair at best and Chappie was ludicrous. (I haven’t seen Demonic; it’s apparently terrible.) Gran Turismo represents a major shift for Blomkamp, as it’s his first non-science fiction feature and the first he didn’t write or co-write. The general response has been, if not laudatory, far more favorable than his last two films received. But while I’ll allow that Gran Turismo is more competent than Chappie – while it’s better in terms of not actively sucking – it’s a less compelling film by every metric.\n\nIt’s the story of Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), who wants to race cars more than anything, but lacks the means to do so in reality. So he does the next best thing, according to PlayStation: he becomes a whiz at Gran Turismo, a series of racing games which we’re told are as realistic as creator Kazunori Yamauchi (Takehiro Hira) can make them. His father, retired footballer Steve (Djimon Hounsou), thinks he’s wasting his time gaming and dreaming of something he can’t achieve.\n\nBut Nissan executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) has an idea: select the best Gran Turismo players, put them through training, and then choose the best among them to join the Nissan racing team. While Nissan gives him the go-ahead, finding someone to train the players is rather more difficult. Danny approaches former driver Jack Salter (David Harbour), now working as a mechanic, and despite his skepticism Jack eventually agrees to lead the new GT Academy.\n\nJann is selected to compete in a qualifying race, and handily wins, but finds the reality of racing rather more challenging, as do his fellow students, thanks to Jack’s no-nonsense approach. But Jann perseveres, and despite Danny’s own concerns over Jann’s potential as a media figure, he comes out on top and now must prove himself against seasoned racers. Under Jack’s watchful eye, he does so.\n\nFor much of Gran Turismo, there’s a rather startling lack of tension, and almost every obstacle is overcome with undramatic ease. Danny pitches the GT Academy to an ominously small crowd but gets the green light in the next scene. Jann upsets his father by driving the family car without permission, but the fallout doesn’t prevent him from taking part in the qualifying race. Danny wants to give the Team Nissan slot to Jann’s more camera-friendly rival Matty Davis (Darren Barnet), who lost the final test race by a fraction of a second, but Jack insists otherwise (offscreen), and Jann’s media savvy is never an issue afterwards.\n\nWe also hardly get to know most of the characters. Jann himself is your standard determined dreamer, Steve your standard priggishly pragmatic father, Danny your standard slick executive (albeit less manipulative than initially suggested), and Jack your standard tough-love with mentor with a tragic past. Other characters, like Jann’s doting mother Lesley (Geri Halliwell) and his girlfriend Audrey (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) are barely developed – the Audrey subplot could easily have been eliminated – and most of Jann’s GT Academy classmates are glorified extras.\n\nAlong with the brisk editing that makes much of the film feel like a montage, it results in a shallow film that fails to deliver even the expected emotional impact. We don’t care enough about Jann to really care whether or not he makes it, and the film glosses over the process so much that there’s never any doubt that he will. The academy scenes don’t give us any real sense of budding friendships or rivalries and looking at the young actors chosen to play the gamers, I’m reminded of how, in Last Action Hero, Danny points out that only attractive women exist in Jack Slater’s world. (Jack Salter‘s lack of faith in them seems especially unwarranted.)\n\nNot until Jann crashes at the Nürburgring, accidentally killing a spectator, are there any meaningful stakes, and even those are too easily moved past; it doesn’t help that this heavily fictionalized film moves the accident from well into Jann’s career to his first season as a racer – a choice heavily criticized by critics and the press.\n\nBut the film really drops the ball when Jack convinces the guilt-stricken Jann to return to the track, sharing his own story of being involved in a fatal accident and leaving the game behind. Not because the scene itself is bad, but because, this being Jann’s story, it makes emotional sense to end with him moving past the accident and resuming his career. Instead, it goes on to show Team Nissan competing at Le Mans and coming in third, validating “sim racers” and vindicating Danny – it takes what was barely scraping by as an underdog story and makes it, essentially, the story of a marketing campaign.\n\nHarbour is actually quite good in an often-played role and the racing scenes are decently well done, with some dizzying camerawork and thunderous sound. But compared to films like Rush and Ford v. Ferrari, which gave us characters to care about in between the races (which were more impressively done in those films), it’s a thin, glossy, inescapably corporate film.\n\nScore: 58\n\nBlue Beetle (2023) – ***½\n\nOn the other hand, while Blue Beetle is far from a great film (it just barely makes it to ***½), it has what Gran Turismo so conspicuously lacks: characters we can feel some investment in and a story with compelling stakes. Sure, the characters are heavily archetypal, and the story is heavily reminiscent of other superhero narratives, but there’s enough life in the performances and enough care taken in the development of the story and the setting to keep us engaged. As I said, I don’t ask that much of movies, especially straightforward entertainments. This one delivers.\n\nJaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) has just graduated from college and returns to his hometown of Palmera City to a warm reception from his family, which is followed by the bad news: his father Alberto (Damián Alcázar) lost his auto shop, and they’re about to lose their home, thanks to the gentrification of the Edge Keys neighborhood by Kord Industries. Needing money, Jaime and his sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) get jobs at a country club patronized by Kord CEO Victoria (Susan Sarandon).\n\nVictoria, despite her philanthropic pretensions, is most interested in developing military technology, much to the disgust of her niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine). Jaime overhears them arguing and stands up for Jenny, costing him his job, but Jenny later tells him to visit her at Kord headquarters, where she might be able to offer him a job.\n\nJaime duly visits her the following day, right as she’s engaged in stealing the Scarab, a piece of alien technology Kord is hoping to use as the basis for a super-soldier body-enhancement device. She gives the Scarab (hidden in a fast-food box) to Jaime and tells him to guard it but not look at it. But his family insist upon taking a look, and the Scarab suddenly latches onto Jaime, fusing with his body and taking him on a super-powered ride around the city.\n\nThe Scarab, or Khaji-Da (voiced by Becky G) is a symbiotic device that aims to protect its host, and to do so gives Jaime the ability to fly, generate weapons, and wield them with super-strength. He’s going to need them, because Victoria, in league with her similarly-powered henchman Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), is determined to get the Scarab back, and is quite willing to go through the Reyes to get to Jaime; anything to serve “the greater good.”\n\nThat Victoria is defeated is no surprise, but exactly how the tables finally turn on her, and how much Jaime is aided by his family and Jenny (who’s clearly on her way to becoming one of them), give the film some of its distinction. The importance of unity to the Reyes clan is repeatedly emphasized, and it pays off; Carapax sneers that Jaime’s love for his family makes him weak, but at a key point, Jaime throws this back in his face; that love is precisely what makes him strong.\n\nAs with Gran Turismo, the characters are fairly archetypal. Jaime is the earnest young hero staggered by the powers he’s been given (he’s cut from the same cloth as Peter Parker), Victoria is the ruthless tycoon, Alberto the loving but tragic father, Milagro the snarky little sister, Jenny the plucky action-girl love interest, Nana Reyes (Adriana Barraza) the sweet abuelita with a core of steel, and uncle Rudy (George Lopez) the eccentric character who offers comic relief but has his soulful side. And the story itself fits well within the origin-story mold DC and Marvel have honed for the last 20 years.\n\nBut it works, because the script by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer gives the characters just enough room to breathe, and because the cast, under director Ángel Manuel Soto, are able to breathe that vital bit of life into them. As a piece of representation, Blue Beetle is significant; it’s the first major superhero film with a Latine protagonist, and the community is reflected extensively behind and in front of the camera, and in details like the appearance of El Chapulín Colorado, a comedic Mexican superhero celebrating his 50th anniversary this year.\n\nOf course, representation alone doesn’t make a good film, but it can enhance a solid one, and that’s the case here. The use of Spanglish in the dialogue, the nods to Catholic practice, the various vibes of Palmera City, the casual racism displayed by Victoria…these all help to give the film that extra measure of personality that makes it truly engaging.\n\nMaridueña’s good-natured performance gives Jaime room to grow in future installments while allowing us to care about him from the start; he’s trying to protect his family and deal with his new powers all at once, and effectively conveys the challenge. Sarandon doesn’t make Victoria an all-time villain by any means, but she relishes the character’s unalloyed amorality. Alcázar is as poignantly lovable as Lopez is boisterously lovable, and Barraza, at first a sweetly doddering presence, has fun with the revelation of Nana’s revolutionary bona fides (she wields that Rubiks-Cube gun well), even if the joke is milked too much. Escobedo is snarky fun (if a bit sidelined after the first act), and Trujillo brings some welcome subtleties to Carapax, who’s got a past of his own.\n\nAdd in a really fun synthy score by Bobby Krlic, solid effects, and a visual style that seems just a bit looser and more grounded than most (though my screening might not have been at full resolution – the image was a bit fuzzy and I’m not sure if that was intended), and you’ve got a solid late-summer entertainment that balances action, comedy, and drama with ease. What more need I say?\n\nScore: 77\n\nTheater Camp (2023) – ***½\n\nI never went to theater camp as such, but I did children’s theater, then school plays, then majored in theater in college, then went out last night with two friends who are professional thespians – so yes, I’m well acquainted with the world and the types lovingly spoofed in Theater Camp. To be sure, it focuses on the musical side of things – there’s a great moment when Glenn (Noah Galvin), talking to the decidedly un-savvy Troy (Jimmy Tatro), is forced to conclude that, if you have straight plays and musicals, that makes musicals gay plays – and I was never much for musicals as a performer; when it comes to musical theater, I prefer Gilbert & Sullivan to most of the Broadway-musical canon.\n\nAnd while it does mean that a lot of Theater Camp focuses on a side of the theater I’ve never felt as much a part of – give me a good monologue over a show tune any day – I found it amply relatable as it deals with the frustrations, the egos, the stresses, and the joys – the joy of making art and of building a community in the process – which beset the staff and campers at AdironACTS in upstate New York.\n\nOne of the biggest stresses comes from Troy, whose sainted mother Joan (Amy Sedaris) founded AdironACTS and kept it afloat for years – until a seizure brought on by strobe lights at a production of Bye Bye Birdie left her in a coma, leaving Troy, a cheerfully dense would-be influencer who knows little of the theater, in control. He fires a number of teachers and tries to replace them all with Janet (Ayo Edebiri) who knows barely more about the theater than he does, and the remaining staff and campers ignore or outright shun him.\n\nThey’ve got problems of their own. Amos (Ben Platt) and Rebecca-Diane (Molly Gordon) have been best friends since meeting at AdironACTS as children, and Rebecca-Diane clearly still has feelings for Amos, even after he came out to her years earlier. They’re supposed to write an original musical, as they’ve done for the last decade, but as the camp kicks off, they’ve only got an idea – a biography/hagiography of Joan – and Rebecca-Diane’s attention is increasingly diverted by impromptu seances and career opportunities, to Amos’ mounting frustration.\n\nThere’s also choreographer Clive (Nathan Lee Graham) and his tales of his raucous youth in the 80s, costume designer Gigi (Owen Thiele), Joan’s right-hand woman Rita (Caroline Aaron), and Glenn, the ever-busy, incredibly shy tech guru who’s clearly a talented performer, but has never had the chance to prove it. And there’s the management of neighboring Camp Lakeside, namely their cunning lawyer Caroline (Patti Harrison) who’s eager to buy out AdironACTS and sees an easy mark in Troy, who’s overwhelmed by the camp’s debts.\n\nAnd there’s the students, from the precociously savvy aspiring agent Alan (Alan Kim) to the deadpan techie Lainy (Vivienne Sachs) to the flamboyant Christopher (Luke Islam) to the future star Darla (Kyndra Sanchez) to the sweetly sensitive Mackenzie (Bailee Bonick) to the affably strait-laced Devon (Donovan Colan). They’ve got their own antics, from Christopher buying Throat Coat tea from a dealer (another great scene) to Mackenzie being shamed for using a tear stick.\n\nThat’s an awful lot of characters and story threads to cram into a 90-minute film (AdironACTS is actually putting on four shows, but we only focus on the Joan show), and if there’s a major shortcoming with Theater Camp, it’s the film doesn’t give most of them enough room to develop. Some plot points, like Darla’s eventually leaving the camp for a paid gig, or Rebecca-Diane’s personal restlessness, feel distinctly underexplored with everything else that’s going on – there’s really enough here for at least a limited series, which might have worked better than the film ultimately does.\n\nAnother issue is the mockumentary format, which allows for some amusing moments (the deadpan intertitles make a funny contrast with the characters’ zaniness) but makes the moments which feel like shtick – the “Fosse kids,” Alan’s schmoozing, Rebecca-Diane’s spiritualism, etc. – work less well than they might have in a straightforward dramatic context. It’s still a funny and likable film, but it’s not quite a bullseye.\n\nThe cast is ultimately the biggest asset. Tatro steals the film as Troy, who’s a dolt and a boor, but humanized enough that we can laugh at him the more and feel for him as he comes to value the camp. Gordon allows us to sympathize with Rebecca-Diane’s frustrations while finding the humor in her own self-absorption. Platt, infinitely better cast as the peevish Amos than he was as Evan Hansen, is able to convey the painful insecurity which informs his irritability, while Galvin is charming both as the mousy Glenn we meet and the star he blossoms into. But everyone does well, with Islam and Bonick especial standouts among the talented younger players.\n\nGordon’s direction (with co-writer Nick Lieberman) is fine, but it’s subordinate to the script, by Gordon, Lieberman, Platt and Galvin, based on a short which is not readily available. They’re clearly drawing on years of experience and friendship (clips of their actual childhood performances are used), and the more it shines through, the better the film is. They also, with composers James McAllister and Mark Sonnenblick, created some amusing songs for the show Amos and Rebecca-Diane write. Kudos also to Jon Philpot’s deft editing.\n\nTheater Camp isn’t quite sharp or incisive enough to be truly great, but for thespians it’ll provoke knowing laughter and, perhaps, bring back some fond memories. It’s a must for them, but it’s also worth a look if you’re wanting a light comedy with a bit of heart."
