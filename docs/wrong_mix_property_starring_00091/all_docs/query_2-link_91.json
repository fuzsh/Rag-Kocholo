        "text": "The year is 1993.\n\nMuscled Arnie is in full-swing, throwing down smackdowns, and witty one-liners and bad guys like there was no tomorrow and Family-friendly films were on the horizion.\n\nYip…\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the property, The Last Action Hero is a satire of the action genre and all of the many clichés associated with it.\n\nThe movie is packed with parodies and stars Schwarzenegger in the role of Jack Slater, a fictional Los Angeles detective within his eponymous film franchise.\n\nAustin O’Brien co-stars as Danny Madigan, a boy who gets magically transported into Slater’s cinematic universe and Charles Dance, meanwhile, plays a brutal assassin named Benedict who seeks to wreak the same havoc in the real world that he’s always caused onscreen. Of course, Schwarzenegger also served as the film’s executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.\n\nOf course, the project is only in the earliest stages of development, which means details are still pretty thin on the ground but that doesn’t mean it isn’t something to look forward to."
