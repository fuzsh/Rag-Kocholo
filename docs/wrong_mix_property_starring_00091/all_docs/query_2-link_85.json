        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger considered “Last Action Hero” the beginning of the end of his film career. After a string of blockbusters, Arnold had a flop on his hands.\n\n“Last Action Hero” — a self-referential parody of every action movie that made Arnold’s career — didn’t sit well with fans who didn’t know what to make of it. Oh, and it was competing with a little movie called “Jurassic Park.”\n\nBut there’s a lot to love about this cinematic oddity: intentionally painful puns, boundless cameos, purposefully ridiculous action sequences, and Arnold being Arnold.\n\nGene gets a little too cerebral. Kerri reveals her obsession with fart jokes and hatred for AC/DC, and Big D brings the best Schwarzenegger impressions in the business in this Big Gun of a Shat The Movies episode.\n\nVideo: Top 10 Darkest Movie Theories\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSIMa4XVgBM\n\nVideo: Why ‘Last Action Hero’ Is Secretly Creepy\n\nhttp://www.cracked.com/video_19246_why-last-action-hero-secretly-terrifying.html\n\nPlot Summary: “Last Action Hero” Following the death of his father, young Danny Madigan (Austin O’Brien) takes comfort in watching action movies featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). After being given a magic ticket by theater manager Nick (Robert Prosky), Danny is sucked into the screen and bonds with Slater. When evil fictional villain Benedict (Charles Dance) gets his hands on the ticket and enters the real world, Danny and Jack must follow and stop him.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nAndroid: https://www.shatpod.com/android\n\nApple/iTunes: https://www.shatpod.com/apple\n\nHelp Support the Podcast"
