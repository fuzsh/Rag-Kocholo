Join Gaius and special guest Dustin Rybka (@dustinrybka) of the \n@sexparty.fm podcast as they discuss all the reasons why the movie may have failed to connect when it was released in 1993 but all the reasons why it has achieved a cult following today. From the celebrity cameos, including appearances by some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, to the film’s multiverse inspired storyline that we’re currently seeing in some action films today. We’ll also explore the minds behind the film, such as director John McTiernan and writers Shane Black, Zak Penn, and Adam Leff. Despite being considered a cult classic, “Last Action Hero” is often underrated in Schwarzenegger’s filmography. So grab your popcorn and settle in as we break down all the reasons why this film deserves a spot on your must-watch list.\n.\n.\nAs always, click the link in my bio to listen, subscribe, rate, and review across our various podcast platforms!\n\n#lastactionhero #arnoldschwarzenegger #austinobrien #johnmctiernan #zakpenn #shaneblack #fmurrayabraham #artcarney #charlesdance #cinephiles #cinephilecommunity #cinephile #filmcommunity #popculture #movieaddict #movielover #movielife #filmbuff #moviebuff #podcast #moviepodcast #podcastclips #podcasts #podcastcommunity\".",
