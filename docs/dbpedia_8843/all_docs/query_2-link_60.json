        "text": "Importing soil into the United States from foreign sources is prohibited. Moving soil within the continental United States is restricted unless authorized by APHIS under specific conditions, safeguards, and controlled circumstances described in a permit and/or compliance agreement.\n\nUse PPQ Form 525-A, Application for Permit To Receive Soil or PPQ Form 526, Application for Permit To Move Live Plant Pests, Biological Control Agents, or Noxious Weeds.\n\nApply for a Permit\n\n(PDF, 50.67 KB)\n\nSoil from almost all foreign countries and many U.S, States can move only if conditions and safeguards are met. View circular for more information on how to import and move soil.\n\nAPHIS can issue a permit usually within 2 weeks if the applicant requests authorization for less than three pounds of soil (per shipment), and the soil can be heat sterilized by PPQ at ports with appropriate facilities.\n\nSoil that cannot be treated at the port of entry may be allowed to move to a facility approved in advance and authorized under a permit issued by PPQ. Specific safeguard provisions are described in the permit and compliance agreement with the facility."
