        "text": "Unlike the British or Americans though, German units could continue to function even when substantially reduced by casualties. Many had combat experience in the East. They were used to operating in improvised battlegroups, thrown together when occasion demanded. They excelled at local counterattacks, quickly recapturing villages and ground taken by the enemy. This meant that time and again, small groups of troops could effectively block much larger Allied formations. But all the while, as they successfully resisted repeated attacks, the Germans were losing precious men and tanks that could not be replaced.\n\nAs the German line stiffened, Montgomery was forced to use ever larger forces to try and break through. Operation ‘Epsom’, launched on 26 June, was an attempt to outflank Caen from the west. The offensive failed, but it took most of the six panzer divisions now around the city to hold the British advance, and their losses were heavy. By this time the II SS Panzerkorps, consisting of 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, had arrived from the East. The original intention had been to use these fresh formations to lead a decisive new counterattack. Instead, they had to be fed into the line to shore up the defences.\n\nAfter ‘Epsom’ the German commanders faced bleak reality. Von Schweppenburg was arguing for a withdrawal into the French interior to conduct a mobile defence. Rommel and von Rundstedt both tried to persuade OKW that the situation was impossible. Instead Von Schweppenburg was sacked on 1 July and von Rundstedt told to retire. It was not long before his replacement, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, was also advocating withdrawal. The Seventh Army commander, General Friedrich Dollman, shot himself.\n\nMontgomery launched another set piece attack to capture Caen – Operation ‘Charnwood’ – on 8 July. The 12th SS HitlerjugendDivision remained the backbone of the defence, but was decimated by the assault which included carpet bombing and a huge artillery bombardment. It was reduced to several hundred infantry and 40 tanks. The 16th Luftwaffe Field Division was virtually wiped out. Though they were still containing the British and Americans, the German Army in Normandy was being bled white in a relentless battle of attrition.\n\nAfter ‘Epsom’ and ‘Charnwood’ it was obvious to most that the battle was lost. Attempts to concentrate armoured units for a decisive counterattack were repeatedly stymied by Allied attacks and the need to support infantry formations. Allied firepower was overwhelming. Supplies of fuel and ammunition were held up by air attacks. There was only a trickle of reinforcements. Rommel himself was now out of the battle, seriously injured by an aircraft attack on 17 July. He would eventually be implicated in the plot to kill Hitler and forced to take poison. Günther von Kluge took over his duties as commander of Army Group B.\n\nOn 18 July the British launched a major armoured attack from the Orne bridgehead east of Caen – Operation ‘Goodwood’. Three armoured divisions advanced along a corridor blasted by heavy bombers, aiming to capture the Bourgébus ridge and continue towards Falaise. But the Germans had established a defence zone several miles deep, based around a number of fortified villages. The British attack faltered as German tanks and 88mm anti-tank guns exploited the open terrain. The long-range superiority of German guns and the weakness of British tank armour were decisive factors. ‘Goodwood’ saw the Germans stage their most effective defence of the campaign, but it was to little avail. Panzer Group West (now renamed Fifth Panzer Army) was still concentrated in the British sector, where the Allied commanders wanted it to be. The last available uncommitted armoured formation - 116th Panzer Division – was ordered to move from Fifteenth Army to the Caen front on the same day.\n\nThe Germans remained weakest in the west of the Allied lodgement area, where the decisive breakout was now set to occur. After clearing the Cotentin peninsula and capturing Cherbourg, which finally fell on 27 June, the US First Army had begun a push towards the vital road junction of St-Lô. The Germans had again exploited the difficult bocage terrain to exact a heavy toll of the advancing Americans. St-Lô fell on 19 July but bad weather postponed further US operations until 25 July when Operation ‘Cobra’ was finally launched. It was the main US offensive. The Germans could field only seven weakened infantry and parachute divisions, supported by 2nd SS Das Reich, Panzer Lehr (re-located from the Caen sector) and the remnants of 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division.\n\nThe Allied bombing attack that preceded Operation ‘Cobra’ effectively wiped out Panzer Lehr. The destruction was foreseen by some commanders but was unavoidable as there was not enough infantry to enable armoured units to be pulled back. Unlike in the Caen sector, the German defences in front of US First Army were neither deep nor continuous and could be outflanked. Once through the front line, the Americans were able to make good progress. The German High Command again demanded that each soldier fight and die where he stood. By 28 July the Americans had taken Coutances and the floodgates were opened. On 30 July the crucial road junction of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula was captured. General George Patton’s US Third Army was activated and began a headlong advance west into Brittany, south to the Loire and east towards the Seine.\n\nDuring this mobile phase of the campaign, German forces could no longer put up an organised resistance. The front was now shattered, with isolated German units fighting as best they could. As ever, troops caught in the open as they tried to escape or re-deploy were pounced on by Allied fighter-bombers. 2nd and 116th PanzerDivisions were belatedly moved from the British sector to try and stop the Americans, but could only hold a north-south defensive line on the River Vire.\n\nTo exploit the breakout, the British launched Operation ‘Bluecoat’ on 30 July from Caumont in the central part of the Normandy front. The objective was Mont Pinçon and the town of Vire. This forced von Kluge to pull more armoured units away from Caen. The British advance in the difficult terrain of the Suisse-Normande was slow. In contrast, Patton’s headlong advance eastwards reached Le Mans on 8 August, and was threatening Alençon. The entire German position in Normandy was being outflanked, and von Kluge pleaded for an immediate withdrawal. Instead, Hitler made matters even worse by ordering a counter-attack from Mortain towards Avranches to cut off the American breakthrough at its narrowest point. Operation ‘Lüttich’ began in the early hours of 7 August and involved five panzer divisions. Together they could only muster about 220 tanks and 70 assault guns. Over three days the German force advanced no further than 5 miles while American artillery, anti-tank gun screens and fighter-bombers inflicted heavy losses. At least 100 tanks were destroyed.\n\nHitler’s stubbornness stopped von Kluge from withdrawing his forces to the Seine, now the only rational course open, and played right into Allied hands. The Allies had originally planned a ‘long envelopment’ of the Germans, trapping them against the Seine, but the Mortain counterattack provided the opportunity for a more compact encirclement. The Americans would push north to Alençon and Argentan while the Canadian First Army struck south towards Falaise. The British Second Army would push east to complete the encirclement.\n\nThe Canadian advance south of Caen – Operation ‘Totalise’ – began on 7 August and made slow progress against the usual expert German defence. 12th SS Hitlerjugend still had 48 tanks available, with 19 Tigers of 101st Heavy SS Tank Battalion under command. The screens of 88mm guns were deadly as ever, knocking out scores of Shermans. The Canadian British Columbia Regiment lost 47 tanks – its entire strength – on 9 August. Hitler finally agreed to a general withdrawal on 16 August, and a full large scale retreat began. It was of course much too late, but many troops managed to extricate themselves from what became known as the Falaise Pocket, even if they had to abandon nearly all their vehicles and equipment. The Allies eventually linked up at Chambois on 19 August, but even then a desperate local defence kept the pocket open for two more days. Resistance finally ceased on 22 August. 20,000 German troops escaped, but Seventh Army and Fifth Panzer Army had effectively ceased to exist.\n\nTwenty-five out of 38 German divisions had been utterly destroyed. The rest had been reduced to shattered remnants. In total, the Germans suffered 290,000 casualties in Normandy, including 23,000 dead, 67,000 wounded and around 200,000 missing or captured. Some 2,000 tanks had been committed to the battle, but the panzer divisions were left with about 70 tanks between them.\n\nGiven the firepower, air superiority and resources available to the Allied nations, it is doubtful if any strategy or deployment on the part of the German armed forces could have changed the outcome. But German troops fought well on D-Day and then kept Allied forces bottled up in their lodgement area for seven weeks. They suffered from shortages of everything, received minimal reinforcements and were utterly exposed to the depredations of Allied air power. Despite all of this, and the dead hand of Hitler reaching from his headquarters on the other side of Europe, they conducted a masterly defence, inflicting heavy losses on their opponents. Much of this was down to the fact that they had chosen the ground, and could benefit from all the defensive advantages that such congested and enclosed terrain offered. Some of it was the result of hesitant or clumsy Allied tactics. The Germans also possessed tanks and weapons that in many ways were superior to those of the Allies. But there is also no doubt that the fighting quality of the German soldier himself, whether motivated by fanaticism, discipline or fear, was a significant factor. The campaign in Normandy was the greatest military defeat yet suffered by the German armed forces, but it was also an exposition of German fighting power."
