        "text": "The DOD SkillBridge program is for active-duty service members and select groups of the National Guard and the Reserves within 180-days of their separation date. Through this program, the DOD will continue to provide the service members with their salary, allowances, and benefits while they are in training with authorized DOD SkillBridge partner organizations.\n\nSome DOD SkillBridge partners may offer skills training and employment opportunities for military spouses and veterans as well as transitioning service members. The DOD encourages spouses and veterans to connect directly with the industry partner POC for more information regarding potential opportunities.\n\nMilitary spouses can explore the SkillBridge locations page and search for the keyword \"spouse\" to see SkillBridge partners that have indicated a desire to assist military spouses. For additional career assistance, spouses can also contact the SECO Spouse Career Center by calling Military OneSource at 800-342-9647 or by visiting https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/portal.\n\nVeterans no longer on active duty can find additional assistance by going to the U.S. Department of Labor VETS program office at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets. See the Post-Service Employment and Career Planning on the SkillBridge website.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that service members complete as much of their service's transition program as possible prior to starting a SkillBridge program to ensure that they are well informed of all their post-service options prior to entering this program. Services and/or commands may require that all mandatory components of TAP are complete before participating in SkillBridge. In addition, service members will need to make a plan for final out-processing, terminal leave, and permissive leave. Each service and/or command provides specific guidance. See the Resources page.\n\nMilitary service members considering SkillBridge opportunities should schedule the SHA as soon as possible. It can be scheduled up to one year in advance of an approved date of separation and then may have a final validation (administrative check) no more than 30-days prior to the actual separation date, which should not conflict with any participation in SkillBridge. Always communicate with the base transition assistance office, SkillBridge program manager, and authorizing commander to advise of any potential conflicts that may arise.\n\nAs a general rule, service members may not accept gifts from a SkillBridge industry partner. However, at their sole discretion, the SkillBridge provider may subsidize or reimburse any or all subsistence, lodging, and home-station to program location travel costs if said subsidy or reimbursement is offered to all similar training participants without regard to military affiliation and specifically and clearly identified by the SkillBridge provider in their SkillBridge application.\n\nExample 1:\n\nA military service member participating in a SkillBridge internship with Company X while in a permissive TDY status. In addition to service members, the internship includes members of the general public. If Company X offers to pay for the service member's airfare and lodging/meals while participating in the internship, the service member may accept the offer if it is also extended to the participating members of the general public.\n\nExample 2:\n\nNear the end of the SkillBridge internship, the participating service member is invited to interview with Company X at its headquarters in another state. Company X HQ offers to pay for your interview travel expenses. However, members of the general public who also participate in the internship are not provided travel expenses when invited to an interview. Because the interview travel expenses are not offered to all invitees, the service member may NOT accept the travel expenses from Company X to attend the interview at the HQ.\n\nService members and their Chain of Command should discuss the unique circumstances of any gift/benefits offer with their servicing Legal Office before accepting them. See SkillBridge Program Participant Ethics Brief in Resources.\n\nAll interested industry partners must first gain approval from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness, Force Education & Training Division through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU allows the industry partner to participate and engage with participating services and installations and details arrangements between the industry partner and the installation and other DOD parties. Written authorization documenting the service member's enrollment into an industry partner's program may be in the form of a Program Application, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Operational Order (OPORD), or formal letter, signed by all parties involved to include the member, the member's unit commander, and the installation program manager. All command-approved applicants will be issued orders listing specifics about the training facility as the service member's official place of duty for the duration of agreed upon training."
