        "text": "Back on Earth, as elevation increases, the number of molecules decreases and the density of air therefore is less, which means there is a decrease in air pressure. In fact, while the atmosphere extends hundreds of miles up, one half of the air molecules in the atmosphere are contained within the first 18,000 feet (5.6 km).\n\nThis decrease in pressure with height makes it very hard to compare the air pressure at ground level from one location to another, especially when the elevations of each site differ. Therefore, to give meaning to the pressure values observed at each station, we convert the station air pressures reading to a value with a common denominator.\n\nThe common denominator we use is the sea-level elevation. At observation stations around the world, the air pressure reading, regardless of the observation station elevation, is converted to a value that would be observed if that instrument were located at sea level.\n\nThe two most common units in the United States to measure the pressure are \"Inches of Mercury\" and \"Millibars\". Inches of mercury refers to the height of a column of mercury measured in hundredths of inches. This is what you will usually hear from the NOAA Weather Radio or from your favorite weather or news source. At sea level, standard air pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury.\n\nMillibars comes from the original term for pressure: \"bar\". Bar is from the Greek \"b√°ros\", meaning weight. A millibar is 1/1000th of a bar and is approximately equal to 1000 dynes (one dyne is the amount of force it takes to accelerate an object with a mass of one gram at the rate of one centimeter per second squared). Millibar values used in meteorology range from about 100 to 1050. At sea level, standard air pressure in millibars is 1013.2. Weather maps showing the pressure at the surface are drawn using millibars."
