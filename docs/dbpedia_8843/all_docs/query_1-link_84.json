        "text": "REFERRAL AND RELOCATION ASSISTANCE\n\nDeveloping a sense of community can start before you arrive at Incirlik. We recognize the efforts behind this transition and want to make sure you are satisfied with the details of your move. To obtain Referral and Relocation Assistance, we encourage you to reach out for personalized services provided by the MHO staff.\n\nIncirlik is a village located near the city of Adana. Adana is situated on the Seyhan River, 30 kilometers inland from the Mediterranean Sea, in south-central Anatolia. A population of 1.56 million makes Adana the fifth most populous city in Turkey. The warm, sunny climate is comparable to Texas, with little precipitation in the summer and a rainy season in the winter.\n\nPlanning Your Move\n\nMoving to an overseas location requires additional planning to make sure you and your family are prepared for the transition. There are many things you can do before you arrive to ensure the process to get settled in your new home and community is seamless.\n\nLodging\n\nWhen you arrive at Incirlik AB you will be staying in temporary accommodations until you move into permanent quarters.\n\nPrior to your arrival, work with your sponsor to secure temporary accommodations. Your sponsor will assist you with reservations in an on-base Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF).\n\nTo maintain temporary lodging, you must contact MHO to secure your Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). TLA is an entitlement to partially offset more-than-normal expenses incurred during occupancy of temporary lodging. TLA will be authorized until on-base government housing or off-base economy housing is available for occupancy, whichever is first.\n\nIf permanent housing is not secured, military members are required to report to MHO every 10 days for a recertification of TLA. For TLA entitlements to be extended for the next 10-day period, MHO requires a list of the housing units visited and the reason why they were not acceptable. Pet restrictions and preferred school districts do not qualify as reasons for non-acceptance of available housing.\n\nDrivers License\n\nMilitary members will receive a form from American Pass and Registration. All civilians and dependants must have an International License or pay to have a Turkish translation (around $70).\n\nPower Requirements\n\nThe electrical current in Incirlik housing is equipped with both 110 and 220 volts with 50 Hz cycles as opposed to 110 volts and 60 Hz cycles in the United States. Transformers for use with small electrical appliances are available through the government Furnishings Management Office (FMO) and 220 volt appliances may also be purchased in the local Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) stores.\n\nDeparting service members often sell their used 220 volt appliances for a reasonable price. For advertisements of products available, view the local base newspaper; ask the Family and Airmen Readiness Center and check out Incirlik Yard Sale Facebook page.\n\nFor more information on products for each location go to the AAFES website.\n\nAirman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC)\n\nThe local AFRC website is another great resource to obtain pertinent information about the area.\n\nRestrictions in Unaccompanied Housing at Incirlik AB\n\nSmoking: AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force, regulates smoking in dormitories. At Incirlik, smoking is not allowed in areas inside dormitories or Herky Housing. Smoking is allowed only in the designated smoking area at each dormitory and Herky Housing where signs are posted.\n\nVehicles: All vehicles must be registered on Incirlik AB. Parking is permitted only on paved surfaces specifically marked for parking. You may not park in the crosswalk, fire lane, or within 15 feet of a fire hydrant. Motorcycles must be parked in parking areas and not under gazebos, dormitory staircases, bicycle sheds, or on sidewalks. Recreational vehicles and utility trailers are not allowed in UH parking lots. Vehicle repair or washing is not allowed in UH or Herky Housing areas. Vehicle work is allowed at the Auto Hobby Shop or other appropriate facility designed for vehicle repairs or washing. Additionally, car parts/accessories may not be stored inside resident quarters. Inoperative, unregistered, improperly tagged, or unlicensed vehicles are not allowed in the dormitory or Herky Housing area parking lots and are subject to towing at the owner's expense.\n\nBicycles: Bicycles may be kept in dormitory rooms only if they are clean and do not pose a fire safety egress/ingress hazard. In most cases, they should be locked up at the bicycle racks provided at each dormitory. Bicycles stored outside at bike racks must be marked with the owner's name, unit, and DEROS. The UH Management Office Chief will coordinate with unit First Sergeants for removal of any unmarked or abandoned bikes. Register any bicycles with your ADL as soon as possible to avoid removal by UH Management Office personnel.\n\nPets: Fish are the only pets allowed in dormitories and Herky Housing. Aquariums are limited to one, 20-gallon aquarium (maximum) per room and must be kept clean and free of odor. Residents going on TDY or leave, must notify their First Sergeant regarding who will care for the fish in the resident's absence. Any violation of these guidelines will be referred to the Unit Commanders and/or First Sergeants for action. Damages to government property due to unauthorized pets in UH are charged to the resident via payroll deduction or cash collection voucher.\n\nUnauthorized Items:\n\n- Weapons, flares, fireworks, ammunition, or any type of explosive device are prohibited in UH, and possession is punishable under Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n- Local laws and military instructions govern registration, possession and storage of privately owned weapons.\n\n- No weapons of any type may be stored or displayed in the quarters. This includes bows and arrows, martial arts weapons and knives with blades longer than three inches.\n\n- All types of guns designed to propel a projectile (pellet, paint balls, bullet, etc.) whether by air, gas or other means are prohibited.\n\n- Items such as stun guns are also prohibited.\n\nFirst Sergeants have the right to determine weapons versus decorative items on a case-by-case basis. Any resident may submit a written request for waiver to First Sergeant and the UH Management chief for approval to store prohibited items. The Dormitory Manager will file the approved waiver and post a copy of the letter on the back of the resident's door.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nIf you have any questions or require additional support, please contact the MHO for more information about preparing for your move to this location.\n\nHOUSING ALLOWANCES\n\nMilitary members are entitled to various allowances to ensure the transition to a new location is as smooth and stress free as possible. If you have any questions about the allowances listed, contact the MHO.\n\nOverseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA)\n\nFor overseas areas only, individuals moving into community housing may be eligible for OHA and MIHA. Specific circumstances, conditions and requirements of OHA or MIHA are identified in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations.\n\nThese extra allowances are in place to off-set the higher costs of living in overseas communities. OHA is a reimbursement and based on actual expenses for rental and utility/recurring maintenance allowances. It is adjusted every pay period for changes in exchange rates.\n\nMembers are also authorized a one-time Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA). This allowance is provided for the purchase of supplemental items not normally available in foreign housing, but considered standard when renting in the community at U.S. locations such as window coverings, light fixtures, electricity connection, etc.\n\nMHO provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in the host country civilian community. Moving can be a daunting prospect and moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful. However, it can also be exciting and living off the installations provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. Our Housing Office will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.\n\nHousing Services\n\nFor your protection the housing office inspects all off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate. All inspected housing units are listed in the Housing On-line Military Enterprise System (HOMES.mil), a nationwide, joint service, DoD-sponsored website that offers a 24/7/365 single source of available housing to incoming military and their families.\n\nGo to HOMES.mil and create a personal account to view the available housing at your new location. This will enable you to get a feel for the size, style and type of housing at your new installation. If you find available units you are interested in, we do advise that you to wait until you arrive to secure housing so that you can tour the prospective units.\n\nThe housing referral staff will provide translation services to establish appointments to view available housing units, negotiate lease contracts, and assist in establishing utility services. MHO can also provide transportation for civilians eligible to live off-base, with a 2-working day advanced notice. After you move into your home in the community, MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.\n\nCommunity Housing Units\n\nThe Housing Office provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation. Off-base housing requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. For more information, contact the Housing Referral Office within 2 days of arriving. Whether you desire to live on or off-base, do not ship your large household appliances. Temporary loaner furniture is provided for up to 90 days. For more specific information about the Overseas Furnishings Program, see the Furnishings section of this site.\n\nHousing Allowances\n\nMilitary Members are entitled to various allowances to ensure the transition to a new location is as smooth and stress free as possible. If you have any questions about the allowances listed, please contact the Housing Office.\n\nBasic Allowance for Housing (BAH) / Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)\n\nMilitary Members who live in the local community while assigned to Incirlik AB receive Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and a monthly utility allowance (if utilities are separate from the rent) in addition to their Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). These extra allowances are in place to off-set the higher costs of living in overseas communities. OHA is a reimbursement and based on actual expenses. It is adjusted every pay period for changes in exchange rates.\n\nMove-In Housing Allowance (MIHA)\n\nMIHA does not apply at Incirlik Air Base due to AT/FP measures restricting off base living.\n\nFor more information about your Housing Allowances, go to the Defense Travel Management Office website.\n\nTemporary Lodging Allowance (TLA)\n\nWhen you arrive at Incirlik AB, you will be staying in temporary accommodations until you move into permanent quarters. TLA is an entitlement to partially offset the more-than-normal expenses incurred during occupancy of temporary lodging. Prior to your arrival, work with your sponsor to secure temporary accommodations. Your sponsor can assist you with reservations in an on-base Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF).\n\nIf permanent housing is not secured within 2 days, military members are required to report to the MHO every 10 days for a recertification of TLA. Pet restrictions and preferred school districts do not qualify as reasons for non-acceptance of available housing. For more information about TLA and TLFs at Incirlik, contact 676-9357.\n\nLiving Quarters Allowance (LQA)\n\nCivilian employees recruited from the U.S. are required to live on base due to AT/FP and will forfeit Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). LQA is in addition to other allowances and, in most instances, covers most of the costs of housing, heat, electricity, trash, water, and sewer service. The maximum allowable rates depend on the location of the duty assignment, the grade of the employee and how many dependents are living with the employee.\n\nIt is important for individuals to know that LQA is a reimbursement and based on actual expenses. It is adjusted every pay period for changes in monetary exchange rates. For more information on LQA visit the State Department website."
