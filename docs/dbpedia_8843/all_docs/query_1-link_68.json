        "text": "'Sexual predator' means any person who is convicted of a violation or attempted violation of the following sections of the Criminal Code of 1961, and the conviction occurred after July 1, 1999:\n\nKeeping a Place of Juvenile Prostitution;\n\nJuvenile Pimping;\n\nExploitation of a Child;\n\nChild Pornography;\n\nAggravated Child Pornography;\n\nCriminal Sexual Assault, if the victim is under age 12;\n\nCriminal Sexual Assault, regardless of the victim's age (if convicted on or after January 1,2006);\n\nAggravated Criminal Sexual Assault;\n\nPredatory Criminal Sexual Assault;\n\nAggravated Criminal Sexual Abuse;\n\nRitualized Abuse of a Child;\n\nSexual misconduct with a person with a disability (if convicted on or after January 1, 2011);\n\nKidnapping (if convicted on or after January 1, 2011);\n\nAggravated Kidnapping (if convicted on or after January 1, 2011);\n\nUnlawful Restraint (if convicted on or after January 1, 2011);\n\nAggravated Unlawful Restraint (if convicted on or after January 1, 2011);\n\nChild Abduction (if convicted on or after January 1, 2011);\n\nConviction of first degree murder, when the victim was a person under 18 years of age and the defendant was at least 17 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense and the offense was sexually motivated as defined in Section 10 of the Sex Offender Management Board Act;\n\nCertified as a Sexually Dangerous Person pursuant to the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act or any substantially similar federal, sister state, or foreign country law;\n\nFound to be Sexually Violent pursuant to the Sexually Violent Commitment Act or any substantially similar federal, sister state, or foreign country law;\n\nConvicted of a 2nd or subsequent offense, after July 1, 1999 which would require registration pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act; or\n\nA conviction for an offense of federal law, Uniform Code of Military Justice, law of another state or foreign country that is substantially equivalent to any of the these offenses listed above.\n\nSexual Predators are required to register annually for their natural life.\n\nPublic Act 97-0578 became effective January 1, 2012 which requires retroactive registration for sex offenders. A sex offender or sexual predator, who has never previously been required to register under the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act, has a duty to register if the person has been convicted of any felony offense after July 1, 2011. A person who previously was required to register under this Act for a period of 10 years and successfully completed that registration period has a duty to register if: (i) the person has been convicted of any felony offense after July 1, 2011, and (ii) the offense for which the 10 year registration was served currently requires a registration period of more than 10 years.\n\nPublic Act 97-0578 explains further retroactive registration requirements regarding sexual predator offenses, and all offenses which have an exact effective date.\n\nA sex offender must register in person annually for a period of 10 years. The 10-year registration period will start upon conviction for those offenders sentenced to probation. Those offenders sentenced to the Illinois Department of Corrections, another state's department of corrections, or federal corrections must register for 10 years from final parole, discharge, or release.\n\nAn offender must register in person once a year. The offender must re-register within 1 year of the date of their last registration and every year thereafter.\n\nAny changes in an offenderâ€™s registration must be made within three days with the law enforcement agency who has jurisdiction.\n\nAn offender who is convicted of a violation of the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act on or after July 1, 2005 is required to register every 90 days for the duration of their registration.\n\nThose offenders adjudicated as Sexually Dangerous or Sexually Violent, must register every 90 days for natural life.\n\nUpon completion of an offender's 10-year registration period, their information will no longer appear on the web site.\n\nOffenders classified as a sexual predator must register annually for his/her natural life.\n\nAll offenders convicted or adjudicated of first degree murder and registering under the Sex Offender Registration Act must register annually for his/her natural life.\n\nAn offender must register any and all places he or she resides for a period of 3 or more days in a calendar year. If an offender changes his or her address, he or she must inform the local law enforcement agency in which they reside of the move, and the law enforcement agency in which they are moving to within 3 days of that move.\n\nAccording to Public Act 97-0578 which became effective January 1, 2012, if a person moves to Illinois on or after the effective date of this public act, the person is considered a sexual predator with lifetime registration if the person is required to register in another state due to a conviction, adjudication or other action of any court triggering an obligation to register as a sex offender, sexual predator, or substantially similar status under the laws of that State. Registration is required within 3 days of arriving in Illinois.\n\nA person who moved to Illinois prior to January 1, 2012, is required to register in Illinois if the offense in his/her convicting state is substantially equivalent to an offense in Illinois requiring registration. Length of registration is determined by the substantially equivalent offense in Illinois (either 10 year registration or lifetime).\n\nThere are no Illinois laws which prohibit a child sex offender from being around children, unless it is at a park, school, or any location designed exclusively for people under the age of 18. If you would like a further investigation into the welfare of a child present in the same house as an offender, you should contact the Department of Children and Family Services. The Department of Children and Family Service Hotline is 800-25-ABUSE.\n\nWithin three days of beginning to reside in a household with a child under 18 years of age who is not his or her own child, the child sex offender must report this information to the registering law agency.\n\nIt is unlawful for a parent or guardian of a minor to knowingly leave that minor in the custody or control of a child sex offender, or allow the child sex offender unsupervised access to the minor. This does not apply to those child sex offenders who 1) is a parent of the minor, 2) convicted of Sexual Abuse (720 ILCS 5/12-15-c), or 3) is married to and living in the same household with the parent or guardian of the minor. A person who violates this provision is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nBy law, every time a sex offender registers, the local law enforcement agency must take a photo of the offender. The local law enforcement agency must forward a copy of the photo to the Illinois State Police to be added to the web site.\n\nSome offenders lack photos on file due to a photo not being taken at registration with the local law enforcement agency, or because the photo was never forwarded to the Illinois State Police. The Illinois State Police tries to ensure all sex offenders have a photo attached to their information. If you see an offender that lacks a photo on the web site, you should contact the local law enforcement agency to inquire about the lack of a photo.\n\nThe sex offender has vacated his last reported address and has not provided new information regarding his current whereabouts to law enforcement as required by law. Law enforcement officials have confirmed that the offender has vacated the last known address by conducting a physical address verification of the offenders last reported address. The offender's current whereabouts at this time are unknown. An offender listed with an address of location unknown also means the offender is missing. This individual would also be non-compliant in regards to the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are required by law to verify a sex offender's residence in person at least once per year."
