        "text": "In short: Iran’s foreign minister warned the Israeli government to stop airstrikes on the Gaza Strip or else “anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control.” In response, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced, in a statement, the deployment of more U.S. military to the region. In 2022, there were about 170,000 troops stationed outside of the U.S. and its territories – as of June 2023, there were over 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East alone.\n\nWhere are U.S. military stationed around the world?\n\nWhile the U.S. boosts its military presence in the Middle East, it maintains troops on every continent.\n\nAs of September 2022, there are 171,736 active-duty military troops across 178 countries, with the most in Japan (53,973), Germany (35,781), and South Korea (25,372). These three countries also have the most U.S. military bases – 120, 119, and 73, respectively.\n\nThere are around 750 U.S. military bases in at least 80 countries, though Al Jazeera says the number “may be even higher as not all data is published by the Pentagon.”\n\nMany U.S. military bases were built after World War II “when the U.S. took position as the global leader and peacekeeper in and around Japan and Germany,” which explains why those two countries have the most bases. Then the Cold War and the Korean War gave the U.S. another reason for global military expansion – to contain communism.\n\nThe U.S. has since expanded into the Middle East and surrounding area – Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia each have at least 10 bases.\n\nFrom October 2001 through September 2020, U.S. taxpayers paid $6.4 trillion to the federal government that went to wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan. In the post-9/11 years through 2022, the Department of Defense also received an $884 billion increase to its baseline budget.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. spent $877 billion on its military – the most of any country, and more than China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, the U.K., Germany, France, South Korea, Japan, and Ukraine combined. This figure includes $19.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine, according to the report.\n\nThe U.S. spends $2,169 on the military per person, according to NATO data. In total, the U.S. spends about 12% of all its spending on the military, compared to China’s 4.79%.\n\nHistorically, the U.S. has used promoting democracy as justification for its far-reaching military network, although U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East also has been “an underlying motive for direct military intervention or meddling in political development,” according to the Global Policy Forum.\n\nHow have U.S. military deployments and bases changed this year?\n\nAs tensions ramp up in the Middle East and the South China Sea, the U.S. has upped its military presence in these regions.\n\nSince Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that led to an Israeli siege on Gaza, the U.S. has sent military support to Israel and deployed more to the Middle East generally.\n\nOn Oct. 8, Austin announced that he ordered the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, the Navy’s “newest and most advanced aircraft carrier,” to move into the region and be ready to aid Israel.\n\nIn the wake of Hamas’ initial attack and the Israeli blockade on Gaza that lasted for over two weeks, Israel is preparing for a ground invasion. Iran has alluded to stepping in to support Hamas if the ground offensive starts.\n\nIn the South China Sea – the area between China and Taiwan – tensions have increased since the beginning of the year. China believes it has sovereignty over the island, which has been self-ruled for nearly 75 years, and may be ramping up its efforts following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to Taiwan Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng.\n\nIn April 2023, China performed “large-scale combat exercises around Taiwan” that included a simulated blockade.\n\nWhile the U.S. does not officially recognize Taiwan, a U.S. law requires it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nIn February the U.S. and the Philippines struck a deal that allows U.S. forces access to four additional military camps in the Philippines; two of these are near Taiwan, giving the U.S. access to a total of nine military camps. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told China that the military bases available to the U.S. military wouldn’t be used for any “offensive action,” only to aid the Philippines."
