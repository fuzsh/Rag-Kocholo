        "text": "***TRAINING CENTER CAPE MAY UPDATES***\n\nTraining Center Cape May Community and Families,\n\nThe base continues to evolve our training and operations based on the most recent CDC, Coast Guard, and New Jersey guidance.\n\nAs a result of our vaccine and mitigation efforts, recruits will be permitted to invite guests to attend their graduation ceremony. If a guest arrives and they are not on the recruit's list, they will not be allowed on base for graduation. Recruits will confirm their guests’ attendance on graduation week.\n\nOur main gate will open to authorized graduation guests at 8:05 a.m. Unvaccinated visitors and anyone unable to provide vaccination status are asked to wear a mask and maintain 6-foot social distancing at events.\n\nUpon arriving at the front gate, all guests must present a valid form of state or federal identification in order to gain access to the training center. All drivers must possess a valid driver’s license.\n\nFirearms, weapons, and illicit controlled substances, including marijuana, are not permitted on base. Do not have them in your vehicle when you approach the front gate to enter the base.\n\nGraduation is a formal military ceremony and will begin promptly at 11 a.m. in the gymnasium or on the parade field, as weather permits. The ceremony will last for about 45 minutes. After the ceremony is concluded, recruits are free to depart. If you are unable to attend the ceremony, your recruit will be provided travel arrangements to execute their orders for authorized leave and reporting to their first units.\n\nOur Exchange will be open to visitors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for authorized guests and graduates to purchase Coast Guard items or by visiting www.shopcgx.com.\n\nPlease continue to check this official FORCECOM webpage and our U.S. Coast Guard Training Center Cape May (Official) social media page for updated information, as they are the only official sources of information from the Training Center.\n\n---\n\nWe are constantly monitoring this very dynamic and fluid situation and will release information and updates as they become available. One of the best things we can all do is stay informed. There are many resources available to help families cope with the issues brought about by this virus. Some of those resources can be found at the links below:\n\nCoast Guard guidance and resources: www.uscg.mil/coronavirus\n\nCDC guidance: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus\n\nNew Jersey’s COVID-19 response: www.COVID19.NJ.GOV\n\nOur priority is to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that graduates present the lowest risk to our operational units when departing training and to protect the health and safety of our staff. All graduating recruits are provided with travel to their first unit. Based on the dynamic nature of domestic travel and Coast Guard operations, recruits may not have firm travel plans until just before graduation. In some cases, recruits may remain in Cape May for a short period after graduation before reporting to their first units.\n\nChanges to the base status are frequent, your recruit will be the best source of information during this time. Please know that they will make contact as appropriate and keep the families informed with timely and accurate information as necessary.\n\n***LIST OF BASE CHANGES***\n\nThe base is currently open to authorized personnel.\n\nVisitor Screening: Visitors will be screened prior to entry.
