Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\n\nAccording to our research of the best moving companies nationwide, the average cost to hire movers to move a three-bedroom home locally is around $2,200, and the average cost for a long-distance move for a home of that size is $4,400. Just how much your move will cost depends on the size of your home and where you’re moving, among other factors.\n\nWe get that planning a move can be stressful no matter how big or small the home and factoring in the cost of hiring movers is an additional task you might need to check off your moving to-do list. To help your move run smoothly, we’ve rounded up the average cost of hiring movers by assessing a variety of cost databases and providers to find accurate price ranges for a variety of move types.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

However, you can expect to pay between $300 and $6,900 for a short-distance move and between $3,200 and $17,000 for a long-distance move.\n\nIn our survey, nearly a third of respondents across the U.S. said they were planning a move within the same city or town, while about the same percentage (29%) of respondents reported planning same-state moves.\n\nWe recommend moving between October and April for the best pricing and availability. Depending on the company, specific move, and time of year, moving between these months can be up to 30% cheaper.\n\nWe found that hiring a moving company can cost between $40 and $80 per hour with two movers.\n\nHow Much Do Movers Cost?\n\nWhile we noticed that the average movers’ cost for a standard three-bedroom home is $2,200, every home is different, and prices can fall anywhere from $200 to $12,700. For example, if you’re into minimalism and just moving down the road, you could pay on the lower end of that range. But if you have a ton of stuff and need movers to handle your collectibles with care as you move across the country, you’ll pay toward the higher end.\n\n# of Miles 1 Bedroom 2 - 3 Bedrooms 4 - 5 Bedrooms\n\n250\n\n$1,050 – $2,400\n\n$1,800 – $4,000\n\n$3,000 – $5,200\n\n1,000+\n\n$1,700 – $3,700\n\n$2,800 – $5,800\n\n$5,300 – $8,900\n\n2,500+\n\n$2,200 – $4,700\n\n$4,000 – $7,900\n\n$8,200 – $12,700\n\nGet Your Free Moving Estimate\n\nReceive a custom quote that's designed to meet your needs and budget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

We recommend finding a local moving company that offers clear and transparent pricing so you know where you fall within this broad range.\n\nA long-distance move can cost between $1,050 and $12,700. Long-distance moves cost more than shorter distances under 250 miles because the moving company will need to factor in additional expenses, like extra fuel and time. Below is a breakdown of different prices for long-distance moves based on the number of bedrooms.\n\nType of Move Low Estimate High Estimate\n\nShort-distance\n\n$300\n\n$6,900\n\nLong-distance\n\n$3,200\n\n$17,000\n\nAverage Cost of Movers Per Hour\n\nThe average cost to hire a mover is between $40 and $80 per hour. Most moves need at least two movers to get the job done. However, you should expect to pay between $80 and $400 per hour depending on how many bedrooms you’re moving, if you have any specialty items, etc.\n\nHome Size # of Movers # of Hours Average Moving Cost\n\nStudio/one-bedroom\n\n2 4\n\n$320 – $640\n\nTwo-bedroom\n\n3 6\n\n$720 – $1,440\n\nThree-bedroom\n\n4 7\n\n$1,120 – $2,240\n\nFour-bedroom\n\n4 9\n\n$1,440 – $2,880\n\nFive-bedroom\n\n5 12\n\n$2,400 – $4,800\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

If you have a small studio apartment, you might only need two movers to haul all of your stuff out. On the other hand, if you have a large four-bedroom home, it can take significantly longer and require a larger team of movers.\n\nHome Items\n\nWhat you have in your home can also slow things down or speed things up. Your prized wine cellar or workout studio could require specialty packaging or additional movers to get the job done. Meanwhile, it likely won’t take as long if you don’t have as much to move.\n\nDistance\n\nIf you’re traveling a short distance, your costs will be a fraction of the cost of a cross-country move. A local move for a one-bedroom studio could cost you as little as $320, but a move of that size with a distance of 250 miles starts at $1,050. Meanwhile, a move across the country that is over 2,500 miles starts at $2,200.\n\nNumber of Movers\n\nHiring movers can rack up prices. With the average cost of hiring a mover falling between $40 and $100 per hour, needing more movers makes a big difference in the cost of your project.\n\nInsurance Coverage\n\nThe average cost of moving insurance is 1% to 5% of the total estimate of your property’s value. Though you might be tempted to skip out on moving insurance to save money, this insurance helps protect your belongings if they get damaged or lost in the move.\n\nAccessibility\n\nYou’ll also need to consider how accessible your home is for movers. If you have several flights of stairs or other obstacles that could slow down the process, then you may have to pay additional fees.\n\nAdditional Costs and Services Associated With Hiring Movers\n\nOn top of the main cost factors, some additional costs and services can sneak up on you when planning a moving budget.\n\nMovers and Packers Cost\n\nMoving companies offer a variety of add-on packing services beyond the standard service of loading and transporting packed boxes.\n\nYou can save a lot of time by paying for a full-service move in which the movers pack your items into boxes for you as well as unload the packed boxes at your destination. Full-service moves can also include disassembling and reassembling furniture.\n\nMoving companies may charge per hour or per box, but on average you can expect to pay about $700 for full-service packing and unpacking.\n\nMoving Add-Ons\n\nMany moving companies offer add-on services that can increase the total cost of your move by a few hundred dollars. A handful of examples of add-ons include:\n\nDisassembling furniture\n\nReassembling furniture\n\nFelt pads\n\nStretch wrap\n\nSpecialty items\n\nIt’s important to note that some of this equipment may be included or you may be able to purchase it ahead of time for less. Be sure to ask about any extras when you book a moving company.\n\nSpecialty Moving Services Cost\n\nSome items require special packaging equipment or special care. For example, moving a piano, hot tub or motorcycle could add between $300 and $2,000 to your move. Be sure to inform your movers of any specialty items before asking for a quote—especially if you’re getting a quote over the phone.\n\nAuto Moving and Shipping Cost\n\nIf you’re planning a long-distance move, you might also need to move your car. The average cost to ship a car is $1,150, but you could spend as little as $550 or as much as $2,450 if you need to rush the shipment.\n\nMoving Date\n\nSummer is the peak season for moving companies in most areas, and most are fully booked one to two months in advance between June and September. You can save by waiting until the off-season to move, but keep in mind that winter weather can end up causing delays and may add to costs as well.\n\nAnother way to save is to opt for a mid-month, mid-week move. Many moves happen on the first or last day of the month when most lease terms end. Many people also opt to move on weekends to avoid taking time off work. If you have the flexibility to move mid-week, doing so can help you avoid high-demand, high-cost weekends.\n\nStorage Rental\n\nSometimes, you need to move all of your stuff out of your old place, but you don’t have room to put it in the new place yet. In this case, you might want to put your items in a storage unit. Storage units cost between $75 and $300 a month. Larger storage units cost more to rent than smaller storage units and upgrades like temperature-controlled storage units can drive up your cost.\n\nTipping\n\nWhile you don’t have to tip, tipping is a great way to show appreciation for the hard work your movers put into safely moving your belongings. You can tip any amount, but the most common amounts fall between 10% to 20% of the service cost.\n\n“If you haven’t planned a large or long distance move before, you may not realize your packers and movers work in your home for multiple days, including meal times. Professional moving companies do not expect you to feed your crew (some prefer to leave the property for a break), but it’s common for customers to provide food and drinks in addition to tipping. The crews I’ve worked with appreciated inexpensive sandwich platters and salads from grocery or warehouse stores instead of the pizza most clients offer. I always have water or sports drinks available, too.”\n\n— Dawn M. Smith, Moving Expert\n\nLiability and Contents Coverage\n\nAll interstate moving companies are required by law to provide two standard options for liability protection:\n\nReleased Value Protection: Basic coverage that comes at no extra cost, but only covers items at up to $0.60 per pound\n\nFull-Value Protection: Costs extra, but requires your mover to replace lost or damaged items or reimburse you for their full cash value\n\nIf you’re moving heavy or high-value items, consider purchasing full-value protection. Costs vary by mover, so ask about a company’s insurance and liability policies before signing a contract. You may also wish to purchase separate moving insurance from a third-party provider.\n\nMoving Company Prices\n\nBelow are the average costs for local and long-distance moves. Remember, every move is unique and these costs are just a snapshot of two specific moves. Always reach out to companies for unique quotes.\n\nCompany Local Move Cost* Long-Distance Move Cost**\n\nInternational Van Lines\n\n$2,519.00\n\n$4,306.00\n\nUnited Van Lines\n\n$5,200.00\n\n$5,900.00\n\nAtlas Van Lines\n\n$1,040.00\n\n$6,120.78\n\nBekins Van Lines\n\n$2,432.50\n\n$6,425.20\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\n$3,951.50\n\n$9,440.59\n\nNorth American Van Lines\n\n$3,951.50\n\n$9,440.59\n\nMayflower Transit\n\n$5,800.00\n\n$6,500.00\n\nWays to Save Money on Moving\n\nMoving can be expensive, but there are a few ways to make your dollar stretch further Below are seven tips on how you can save money on moving.\n\nGet rid of what you don’t need before the move starts. The less you have to move, the more money you’ll save.\n\nConsider using your own truck and DIYing the move.\n\nDo the packing yourself.\n\nAsk for help from family and friends.\n\nMove during the week or during the off-peak season (usually winter).\n\nLook for free moving boxes and supplies through U-Haul’s Box Exchange program or through local social media groups.\n\nAsk for quotes from at least three different moving companies to find the best prices.\n\n“Hire a partial crew to move only heavy items like entertainment centers and bedroom furniture.”\n\n— Dawn M. Smith, Moving Expert\n\nDIY Moving vs. Hiring a Professional Mover\n\nMoving your home’s items yourself can potentially save you money, but it is unlikely to save you time and energy. Still, if you can find free boxes and only need to purchase tape, padding, mattress bags, bubble wrap and other packing materials, you could end up paying just for those materials—around $100 or more. If you need boxes for a bigger home, then you could pay around $300 for moving and packing materials.\n\nHere is a breakdown of those costs:\n\nBoxes: $2 each\n\nPacking tape: $5 each\n\nMoving blankets: $20 each\n\nFurniture pads: $10 per pack\n\nMattress bag: $10 each\n\nBubble wrap: $20 per roll\n\nIf you’re moving more than a neighborhood away, however, then you will probably also need to rent a moving truck to move all of your items. The cost to rent a moving truck falls between $20 and $100 a day. Gas, insurance and dollies can increase costs, as well. In total, expect to pay somewhere between $150 to $400 for a local move if you plan to do it yourself.\n\nHiring a professional mover can make moving less stressful, but with prices for an average three-bedroom home costing around $2,200, it does come at a cost. For small, local moves, you might be better off DIYing it, but for larger moves that involve many rooms and boxes and heavy items, then you might want to work with a moving company near you.\n\nRecent Moving Stats\n\nWe surveyed 2,000 Americans to find out the top trends and the biggest consumer motivators to move. Below, you will see some of the survey findings to get a more complete view of moving company trends and drivers.\n\nAlmost 40% of respondents reported planning a move for financial reasons or a better standard of living.\n\nNearly a quarter (23%) of respondents said their greatest fear related to moving was how much it would cost, closely followed by having a no-show mover or being ripped off at 19%.\n\nFeelings about the cost of movers were generally split, with 28% saying they spent somewhat more than they expected for movers, 24% saying they paid about what they expected and 11% saying they paid somewhat less than expected.\n\nWhen Do You Need a Moving Company?\n\nIt is no secret that moving can feel overwhelming and time-consuming, often requiring careful planning and physical work. In some situations, hiring a professional moving company may be considered absolutely necessary rather than just a convenience.\n\nWhether you’re faced with a limited timeframe, the need to move bulky items or want a smoother and more organized transition, opting to hire a moving company can substantially alleviate the stresses associated with moving.\n\nTime Constraints\n\nIn the whirlwind of a move, time constraints can be a major factor in determining whether a moving company’s assistance is essential, especially when it comes to job relocations and tight moving schedules. In the case of job relocations, moving professionals excel at quickly packing, loading and transporting your belongings, providing a seamless and efficient moving experience.\n\nFor those with tight schedules because of lease endings or closing dates, a moving company’s expertise ensures skillful organization and timely execution, making them more likely to meet tight deadlines and facilitating a smoother transition to your new home.\n\nMoving Bulk Items\n\nIf your current home is filled with large and heavy furniture, you may want to consider the assistance of a professional moving company. Not only do moving professionals have the specialized experience needed to handle items such as sofas, beds or pianos, but they also have the tools to minimize the risk of damage while transporting bulky furniture.\n\nMoreover, a professional mover’s meticulous care is even more crucial when dealing with delicate or specialized items like antiques, artwork or mirrors. Their extensive knowledge of handling such items ensures a strategic and careful approach, reducing the potential for damage and making the moving process smoother overall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Many rely on professional movers to help. Offering stress relief, security and organization, the advantages of hiring professional movers are increasingly apparent compared to the challenges of a DIY move. We’ve listed a few below:\n\nLess Stress\n\nHiring professional movers is a reliable way to reduce the stress typically linked with the moving process effectively. Professional movers’ extensive knowledge and experience allow them to skillfully handle every aspect of the move, including secure packing, navigating potential obstacles and guaranteeing the safe transportation of your belongings.\n\nPeace of Mind\n\nBy enlisting the help of professional movers, you not only safeguard the physical well-being of your belongings but also gain significant peace of mind. Reputable moving companies often provide insurance coverage as part of their services, acting as a vital safety net in case of any accidents or damages during the move. This additional layer of protection offers reassurance, knowing that your possessions are adequately protected. Additionally, a professional mover’s reliability in sticking to schedules and timelines instills confidence that your move will be efficiently completed according to plan.\n\nOrganization\n\nChoosing professional movers to handle your move guarantees a well-organized and smoothly coordinated process. Moving companies’ structured approach to planning and executing the move ensures a seamless transition, as they can provide a detailed plan that efficiently coordinates every step of the moving journey.\n\nAdditionally, movers are equipped with the right tools, packing materials and vehicles necessary to manage the moving process.

See our list of best moving companies first, so you can be sure that you will be paying for a reputable and trustworthy moving company.\n\nTips for Hiring Reputable Movers\n\nIt can be daunting to look at all the available moving companies in your area and try to find the best fit for you. To help, we compiled our best tips for finding a reputable team that you can trust to be safe and efficient with your belongings.\n\nUse your network for referrals. A personal recommendation from someone you trust is the gold standard for vetting a moving company.\n\nRead reviews: How customers review a company online and how that company responds can give you insight into how it operates and handles customer service issues.\n\nGather multiple quotes: Talk to several moving companies so you can compare prices and services side-by-side.\n\nAsk for proof of license and insurance: You can look up a company’s moving license number and request a copy of its insurance coverage to ensure that it’s operating legally.\n\nAsk about pricing and fees: While most moving companies will provide upfront quotes, know what additional fees and factors to expect to ensure you stay within your budget.\n\nBook in advance: Start searching for a mover at least two months before your move date. Movers book up well in advance, and the longer you wait, the fewer options you’ll have.\n\nTo arrive at the average costs in this article, we surveyed seven providers and eight local and national cost databases. All averaged figures were correct at the time of publication and may be subject to change.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nIs it worth it to hire movers?\n\nWhether it’s worth it or not to hire movers depends on how stressful packing and moving your home is and your budget. If you want to save money and don’t mind putting in some elbow grease, it might be worth it to do the move yourself. But if time is of the essence, and you’re already swamped with other commitments, it might be best to give yourself some peace of mind and let the professionals work their magic.\n\nWhat is the most affordable moving company?\n\nSome of the cheapest moving companies include Allied Van Lines, Atlas Van Lines, American Van Lines, North American Van Lines and International Van Lines.\n\nHow far in advance should you book a moving company?\n\nBooking a moving company as soon as you know when you’re ready to leave is usually the best time to do it. Generally, you don’t want to hold off until the last minute, as moving companies can get fully booked in advance. Try to book at least two weeks before the big day, or ideally two to three months beforehand to ensure the best price.\n\nCan you negotiate moving prices?\n\nYes, you can negotiate moving prices in some situations. Haggling can be more difficult when dealing with larger national or international service providers. However, many moving companies are small or medium-sized organizations that may be family-owned or headquartered in your local area. These providers offer more personalized service and are often open to negotiation to win your business."
