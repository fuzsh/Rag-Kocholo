        "text": "The Marine Corps IRR is a segment of the Marine Corps Ready Reserve, which includes Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) unit, Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA), Active Reserve (AR), and Initial Active Duty for Training (IADT) Marines.\n\nThe majority of Marines in the IRR are former active component Marines who have not completed their Military Service Obligation (MSO), yet have completed their initial contractual period of active duty. Typically, these Marines are in the enlisted grades of Lance Corporal to Corporal and officer grades of First Lieutenant to Captain. The remainder of the IRR consists of Marines who have completed their MSO, yet voluntarily agreed to remain associated with the Marine Corps, participating through various means as an IRR Marine or as a “temporary layover” until they can rejoin an SMCR unit or acquire an IMA billet.\n\nIRR Marines have some administrative obligations and one training requirement (which is to attend an IRR Administrative Muster for administrative screening, if ordered). There are also opportunities to continue serving while in the IRR. Lastly, there are various benefits, as members of the military, that IRR Marines have available to them, most of which are through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n\nThe Marine Corps Individual Reserve Support Activity (MCIRSA), is a special staff section of Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES) (based in New Orleans, LA) that has staff cognizance for the management and administration of IRR Marines. It is the successor entity to the Marine Corps Mobilization Command (MOBCOM) which was based in Kansas City, MO but deactivated on 17 June 2011. The MCIRSA is assisted in the management and administration of IRR Marines by members of the Readiness Support Program (RSP). RSP members are IMA Marines located in one of five geographic regions throughout the United States.\n\nWHAT IS THE IRR\n\nThe Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) is a category of the Ready Reserve of the Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States composed of former active duty or reserve military personnel, and is authorized under 10 U.S.Code Section 1005. The IRR is composed of enlisted personnel and officers, from all ranges of Military Occupational Specialties including combat arms, combat support, and combat service support.\n\nIndividuals assigned to the IRR receive no pay and are not obligated to drill, conduct annual training, or participate in any military activities (except for periodic Muster activities) until ordered by Presidential Authority. Individuals who are assigned to an \"Inactive Status\" are entitled to limited benefits. These benefits include: Entitlement to a Military ID Card, ID Cards for their dependents, PX (Exchange) benefits, Commissary benefits, and MWR (Morale Welfare and Recreation) Benefits. An individual assigned to the IRR may receive pay and full benefits (including medical care and dental care for member and dependents) for voluntarily performing specific types of active duty.\n\nBy law, IRR members are required to retain possession of their service uniforms, their military identification card, and notify their service branch if they move and change their address.\n\nUpon presidential recall, service members will usually be screened for their medical and personal status in order to qualify or disqualify them for activation. During the process, IRR members who seek to delay, defer, or exempt their activations have the opportunity to present their case to the mobilization authority for a decision.\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR IRR MARINES\n\nPer Title 10 U.S. Code and Marine Corps policy, IRR Marines are obligated to notify the Marine Corps of any change to their:\n\nContact Information: Address, at least one telephone number, and email address.\n\nCivilian Employment Information (CEI). This is actually, at minimum, an annual review and certification. If there are civilian employment changes that occur after an annual certification, the change(s) must be updated at that time. CEI is reported in Marine Online (MOL).\n\nMarital status.\n\nNumber of dependents.\n\nPhysical condition that would prevent him/her from meeting Marine Corps physical or mental standards.\n\nPer Marine Corps policy, IRR Marines are required to:\n\nMaintain their basic uniform regulations (i.e., no uniform can be worn during political rallies or protests, etc..)\n\nMaintain standards of conduct. (i.e., allegations or convictions of certain criminal offenses can lead to administrative separation, and if separated, some or all benefits earned as a Marine would be lost, depending on the category of discharge.)\n\nReport for involuntary recall to active duty, whether operational, administrative (i.e., Administrative Musters), or legal.\n\nMarines who wish to remain in the IRR:\n\nMaintain their basic uniform regulations (i.e., no uniform can be worn during political rallies or protests, etc..)\n\nMaintain standards of conduct. (i.e., allegations or convictions of certain criminal offenses can lead to administrative separation, and if separated, some or all benefits earned as a Marine would be lost, depending on the category of discharge.)\n\nReport for involuntary recall to active duty, whether operational, administrative (i.e., Administrative Musters), or legal.\n\nNOTICE: IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED ORDERS TO AN IRR ADMINISTRATIVE MUSTER, READ THE BELOW CAREFULLY\n\nUpon receipt of orders, contact MCIRSA at SMB_MCIRSAMUSTER1@usmc.mil in order to confirm your attendance or have questions answered. Please note the city of the IRR Muster in the subject line (i.e Dallas, San Francisco, etc.) so that your email can be properly routed.\n\nALTERNATE WAYS TO CONTACT MCIRSA"
