They are using various County equipment to collect garbage, recycling, and yard waste to help complete the missed service routes.\n\nSt. Johns County is deploying all resources, including legal measures, to ensure the contractor fulfills its contractual obligations and is accountable for performance issues. The County is actively engaging with FCC leadership for a swift resolution.\n\nFor questions or concerns, residents can contact the St. Johns County Solid Waste Division at 904-827-6980 or SolidWaste@sjcfl.us. Residents can also report issues, such as missed residential solid waste collection, through the Recycle Coach app or by submitting a service request through the SJC Connect app.\n\nBeginning Thursday, August 1, St. Johns County’s new residential curbside collection provider, FCC Environmental Services Florida, LLC, will begin servicing the county.\n\nAll current service levels will remain in place, including weekly curbside collection of household garbage, yard waste, recycling, and bulk waste as well as scheduled services like appliance pick-up requested by customers.\n\nResidents were sent a postcard in mid-July which provided information on their service days. 87% of residents’ service days will remain the same, but the time of service may change. Residents can also confirm their collection days on the Recycle Coach website and app. New Provider full news release"
