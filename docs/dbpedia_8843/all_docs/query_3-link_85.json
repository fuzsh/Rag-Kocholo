I can't find a specific rule, that disallows units from being moved at all after they came out of deepstrike, although i know that this rule exists somewhere. And yet some time ago i heard from someone playing GSC that if you use stratagem \"Drive-by demolitions\" you can move your Atalan Jackals even if they came out of deepstrike in the same turn. Could you please help me and point the exact ruling of this?\n\nPost by terminatoruk on\n\nSee the main rulebook - Pg 177 regarding Reserves.\n\n\"Many units have the ability to be set up on the battleifled mid-turn, sometimes by using teleports, grav chutes or other, more esoteric means. Typically, this happens at the end of the Movement phase, but it can also happen during other phases. Units that are setup up in this manner cannot move or Advance further during the turn they arrive - their entire Movement phase is used in deploying to the battlefield - but they can otherwise act normally (shoot, charge, etc.) for the rest of the their turn. Units that arrive as reinforcements count as having moved in their ovement phase for all rules purposes such as shooting Heavy weapons (pg 180). Any unit that has not arrived on the battlefield by the end of the battle counts as having been destoyed\"."
