        "text": "I was running late for my new aerobics class, I know great impression, but none the less I made it and soon as I walked into the room I was greeted by the wonderful musical sounds of the dance-punk band Moving Units. I knew from that moment I was going to love my new aerobics class, while dance-punk was not on the playlist every session; it sure was a welcome change when it was, especially when the music playing was from Moving Units.\n\nI have only seen Moving Units live once, but I welcome to chance to see them again! I saw them at a nice little venue where everyone was hanging out and talking to each other enjoying drinks and talking about what was to come. As soon as Moving Units walked on stage the crowd went wild, so much so my heart began to beat faster, the mood was electric and catching and I knew I was in for a great night.\n\nYou know you are experiencing something great when even the stone faced body guards canâ€™t help but move to the music, now and then. The night was great and did not disappoint, the band gave a great performance, interacting with the audience and each other, hyping everyone up and leaving everyone wanting more of Moving Units!\n\nFor those of you in the know, you know that Moving Units is not only a dance-punk band but they also have a smooth indie rock sound that I feel adds to the bands appeal making them the one of the best of the best.\n\nRead more"
