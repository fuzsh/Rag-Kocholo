Moving far from home marks the start of a new chapter in your life, and can be an overwhelming experience. Let us help you take the worry and stress out of such an important event with our full suite of moving and storage services specially designed for long-distance moves from UNITS.

With our nationwide network, we can transport your portable storage unit anywhere within our network. If you are moving out of the Bay Area to someplace out of state, then let us handle moving your items and belongings.

Our long-distance move process is similar to local portable storage.

Once you book with us, we’ll drop off a UNIT at your location. You take your time loading it up. When you are ready, just give us a call and we’ll come out to pick up your UNIT.

If you are ready to move into your new location we will transport your UNIT to your new address. If you aren’t yet ready to move in, we’ll then store your UNIT in our secure warehouse until you are ready.

Our portable storage containers are built with transportation in mind. We have a secure E-Track system inside each one of our UNITS.

This allows you to safely secure and tie-down anything you store inside. It is important to do so when packing for any distance move, but especially so for a long-distance move.

Our team has years of experience in how best to pack and fill in your UNIT. We’ll be happy to help explain and show how you can easily pack your boxes and items with worrying about them shifting in transit.

Please give us a call at 855-463-9770 to develop your out-of-state moving plan today.
