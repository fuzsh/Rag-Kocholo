        "text": "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Italian: Regno delle Due Sicilie) was a kingdom in Southern Italy from 1816 to 1861 under the control of a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons. The kingdom was the largest sovereign state by population and size in Italy before Italian unification, comprising Sicily and most of the area of today's Mezzogiorno in covering all of the Italian Peninsula south of the Papal States.\n\nThe kingdom was formed when the Kingdom of Sicily merged with the Kingdom of Naples, which was officially also known as the Kingdom of Sicily. Since both kingdoms were named Sicily, they were collectively known as the \"Two Sicilies\" (Utraque Sicilia, literally \"both Sicilies\"), and the unified kingdom adopted this name. The king of the Two Sicilies was overthrown by Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860, after which the people voted in a plebiscite to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. The annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies completed the first phase of Italian unification, and the new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1861.\n\nThe Two Sicilies were heavily agricultural, like the other Italian states.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies\n\nFerdinand I (12 January 1751 – 4 January 1825) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1816 until his death. Before that he had been, since 1759, King of Naples as Ferdinand IV and King of Sicily as Ferdinand III. He was deposed twice from the throne of Naples: once by the revolutionary Parthenopean Republic for six months in 1799, and again by a French invasion in 1806, before being restored in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nFerdinand was the third son of King Charles VII of Naples and III of Sicily by his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. On 10 August 1759, Charles succeeded his elder half-brother, Ferdinand VI, becoming King Charles III of Spain, but treaty provisions made him ineligible to hold all three crowns. On 6 October, he abdicated his Neapolitan and Sicilian titles in favour of his third son, because his eldest son Philip had been excluded from succession due to imbecility and his second son Charles was heir-apparent to the Spanish throne. Ferdinand was the founder of the cadet House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_the_Two_Sicilies\n\nKing of the Two Sicilies:\n\nReign: 12 December 1816 – 4 January 1825\n\nSuccessor: Francis I\n\nKing of Naples:\n\n3rd reign 22 May 1815 – 12 December 1816\n\n2nd reign 13 June 1799 – 30 March 1806\n\n1st reign 6 October 1759 – 23 January 1799\n\nPredecessor: Charles VII\n\nKing of Sicily:\n\nReign: 6 October 1759 – 12 December 1816\n\nPredecessor: Charles III\n\nBorn: 12 January 1751, Royal Palace, Naples\n\nDied: 4 January 1825 (aged 73), Naples, Two Sicilies\n\nBurial: Basilica of Santa Chiara, Naples\n\nSpouses:\n\nMaria Carolina of Austria ​(m. 1768; died 1814)​\n\nLucia Migliaccio ​(m. 1814)​\n\nChildrens:\n\nMaria Teresa, Holy Roman Empress\n\nLuisa Maria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nPrince Carlo, Duke of Calabria\n\nPrincess Maria Anna\n\nFrancis I, King of the Two Sicilies\n\nMaria Cristina, Queen of Sardinia\n\nPrince Gennaro\n\nPrince Giuseppe\n\nMaria Amalia, Queen of the French\n\nMaria Antonia, Princess of Asturias\n\nPrincess Maria Clotilde\n\nPrincess Maria Enrichetta\n\nLeopold, Prince of Salerno\n\nPrince Alberto\n\nPrincess Maria Isabella\n\nNames:\n\nFerdinando Antonio Pasquale Giovanni Nepomuceno Serafino Gennaro Benedetto di Borbone\n\nHouse: Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nFather: Charles III of Spain\n\nMother: Maria Amalia of Saxony\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nMaria Carolina (Maria Carolina Louise Josepha Johanna Antonia; 13 August 1752 – 8 September 1814) was Queen of Naples and Sicily as the wife of King Ferdinand IV and III, who later became King of the Two Sicilies. As de facto ruler of her husband's kingdoms, Maria Carolina oversaw the promulgation of many reforms, including the revocation of the ban on Freemasonry, the enlargement of the navy under her favorite, Sir John Acton and the expulsion of Spanish influence. She was a proponent of enlightened absolutism until the advent of the French Revolution, when, in order to prevent its ideas gaining currency, she made Naples a police state.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Carolina\n\nLucia Migliaccio, suo jure 12th Duchess of Floridia (19 July 1770 – 26 April 1826) was the second wife of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Their marriage was morganatic and Lucia was never a queen consort. She was the daughter of Don Vincenzo Migliaccio and Donna Dorotea Borgia dei Marchesi del Casale.\n\nOn 4 April 1791, Lucia married Don Benedetto Maria Grifeo, 8th Prince of Partanna. They had seven children together. However, Benedetto died in 1812. Two years later, on 27 November 1814, Lucia married the King of the Two Sicilies, Ferdinand I. The two had met frequently at the royal court. They had no children together, and Ferdinand died in 1825. Their marriage caused a scandal at court, and Ferdinand’s eldest son from his first marriage with Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, Francis, tried to persuade his father not to marry Lucia.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_Migliaccio\n\nFrancis I of the Two Sicilies (Italian: Francesco Gennaro Giuseppe Saverio Giovanni Battista; 19 August 1777 – 8 November 1830) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1825 to 1830 and regent of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1806 to 1814.\n\nKing of the Two Sicilies:\n\nReign: 4 January 1825 – 8 November 1830\n\nPredecessor: Ferdinand I\n\nSuccessor: Ferdinand II\n\nBorn: 19 August 1777, Royal Palace of Naples, Naples, Kingdom of Naples\n\nDied: 8 November 1830 (aged 53), Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n\nBurial: Basilica of Santa Chiara, Naples\n\nWifes:\n\nMaria Clementina of Austria ​(m. 1797; died 1801)​\n\nMaria Isabella of Spain (m. 1802)​\n\nChildrens:\n\nPrincess Maria Carolina, Duchess of Berry\n\nLuisa Carlotta, Infanta of Spain\n\nMaria Cristina, Queen of Spain\n\nFerdinand II of the Two Sicilies\n\nCarlo Ferdinando, Prince of Capua\n\nPrince Leopoldo, Count of Siracusa\n\nMaria Antonia, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nPrince Antonio, Count of Lecce\n\nMaria Amalia, Infanta of Portugal and Spain\n\nPrincess Maria Carolina, Countess of Montemolín\n\nTeresa Cristina, Empress of Brazil\n\nPrince Luigi, Count of Aquila\n\nPrince Francesco, Count of Trapani\n\nNames:\n\nItalian: Francesco Gennaro Giuseppe Saverio Giovanni Battista\n\nHouse: Bourbon\n\nFather: Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n\nMother: Maria Carolina of Austria\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\nMaria Clementina of Austria (24 April 1777 – 15 November 1801) was an Austrian archduchess and the tenth child and third daughter of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Luisa of Spain. In 1797 she married her double first cousin Prince Francis, Duke of Calabria, heir to the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily. She was modest, well educated and kind, becoming popular in her adoptive country. Afflicted with frail health, she died of tuberculosis, age twenty four. Her only surviving child was Princess Caroline, Duchess of Berry.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduchess_Maria_Clementina_of_Austria\n\nMaria Isabella of Spain (Spanish: María Isabel de Borbón y Borbón-Parma; 6 July 1789 – 13 September 1848) was Queen of the Two Sicilies from 4 January 1825 until 8 November 1830 as the wife of Francis I of the Two Sicilies.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. María Isabel's birth coincided with the rise to power in Spain of her mother's favorite, Manuel Godoy. Court rumour attributed María Isabel's paternity not to the king, but to the young Godoy, who became Spain's prime minister in 1792.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/María_Isabella_of_Spain\n\nFerdinand II (Italian: Ferdinando Carlo; Sicilian: Ferdinannu Carlu; Neapolitan: Ferdinando Carlo; 12 January 1810 – 22 May 1859) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1830 until his death in 1859.\n\nKing of the Two Sicilies:\n\nReign: 8 November 1830 – 22 May 1859\n\nPredecessor: Francis I\n\nSuccessor: Francis II\n\nBorn: 12 January 1810, Palazzo dei Normanni, Palermo, Kingdom of Sicily\n\nDied: 22 May 1859 (aged 49)\n\nCaserta Palace, Caserta, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n\nBurial: Basilica of Santa Chiara, Naples\n\nWifes:\n\nMaria Cristina of Savoy (m. 1832; d. 1836)\n\nMaria Theresa of Austria (m. 1837)\n\nChildrens:\n\nFrancis II of the Two Sicilies\n\nPrince Luigi, Count of Trani\n\nPrince Alberto, Count of Castrogiovanni\n\nPrince Alfonso, Count of Caserta\n\nMaria Annunziata, Archduchess of Austria\n\nMaria Immacolata, Archduchess of Austria\n\nPrince Gaetano, Count of Girgenti\n\nPrince Giuseppe, Count of Lucera\n\nMaria Pia, Duchess of Parma\n\nPrince Vincenzo, Count of Melazzo\n\nPrince Pasquale, Count of Bari\n\nPrincess Maria Luisa, Countess of Bardi\n\nPrince Gennaro, Count of Caltagirone\n\nNames:\n\nItalian: Ferdinando Carlo\n\nHouse: Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nFather: Francis I of the Two Sicilies\n\nMother: Maria Isabella of Spain\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nMaria Cristina of Savoy (Maria Cristina Carlotta Giuseppa Gaetana Efisia; 14 November 1812 – 21 January 1836) was the first Queen consort of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies.

She is venerated in the Catholic Church, having been beatified by Pope Francis.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cristina_of_Savoy\n\nMaria Theresa of Austria (31 July 1816 – 8 August 1867) was the second wife of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, making her Queen of the Two Sicilies.

He was the last King of the Two Sicilies, as successive invasions by Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia ultimately brought an end to his rule, as part of Italian unification. After he was deposed, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Kingdom of Sardinia were merged into the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II_of_the_Two_Sicilies\n\nKing of the Two Sicilies:\n\nReign: 22 May 1859 – 20 March 1861\n\nPredecessor: Ferdinand II\n\nSuccessor: Position abolished;\n\nLand seized by Kingdom of Sardinia under Victor Emmanuel II\n\nHead of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies:\n\nTenure: 20 March 1861 – 27 December 1894\n\nSuccessor: Prince Alfonso\n\nBorn: 16 January 1836\n\nRoyal Palace of Naples, Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (now Naples, Italy)\n\nDied: 27 December 1894 (aged 58), Arco, Austria-Hungary (now Arco, Italy)\n\nBurial: Basilica of Santa Chiara, Naples\n\nWife: Maria Sophie of Bavaria ​(m. 1859)​\n\nChildren: Princess Maria Cristina Pia\n\nNames:\n\nItalian: Francesco d'Assisi Maria Leopoldo\n\nHouse: House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nFather: Ferdinand II\n\nMother: Maria Christina of Savoy\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\nMaria Sophie Amalie, Duchess in Bavaria (4 October 1841, Possenhofen Castle – 19 January 1925, Munich) was the last Queen consort of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
