        "text": "Thank you, Amedea!\n\nI think Archduchess Maria Anna was quite attractive when she was younger. I've seen some earlier portraits and she looked quite good - perhaps not as pretty as the others but still. Of course, it can also be a matter of opinion. So she was a hunchback? Definitely a very hard sell in terms of marriage.\n\nAnyone knows anything on Maria Amalia and Maria Caroline?\n\nOn Marianne I can also think that some court painter preferred to portray her more beatiful than she was..\n\nMaria Amalia was the most problematic daughter; she wanted to marry Karl von Zweibrucken but MT thought he wasn't enough for her. MT inherited the duchy of Parma and Piacenza but lost it in her reign's first years wars: regaining an influence on that state was probably the reason she promised MA to the young duke; MA rebelled to her mother's choise by accepting the wedding but, once in Parma, behaving very badly: her husband wasn't interested in state affairs and she took the leadership of the duchy herself. But she did it openly and humiliating her husband. That was a scandal at Parma court and in all Europe courts. MT had very much to loose: if her daughters were all considered so arrogant, the unmarried ones couldn't marry other sovereigns..MT broke the correspondence with her and oredered all the family to do the same (she was obeyed). MA wanted to return in Vienna to make peace with the family, but her mother forbid it saying her place was in Parma and fearing she would not return.. I don't know well how the crysis ended..\n\nMaria Caroline had a strong relationship with Maria Antoinette (they were in the same bedroom). MA was the preferred sister of MC and MC the preferred one of MA. MC named one of her daughters MA and the third name of the first daughter of MA was Charlotte. the love of MC come out, for example, from her letters to their mother. MC, finally, was shocked from the death of MA: she started hating France and the french, she took in her bedroom a small guillotine, she was really hesitating in allowing her daughter M Amelia to marry the Duke of Orleans( his father voted the death of Louis XVI at the national assembly)..\n\nThank you very much, amedea! I've noticed that you're from Italy and it's good to have an 'Italian knowledge' on Maria Amalia and Maria Carolina. I think you are right --- the paintings of Marianne may be on the flattering side..... Marie Christine seemed to have recovered fast from her heartbreak --- she was 'involved' with Albert of Saxony soon after.\n\nAmalia was MT's 'wild child'. Amalia's enforced marriage to Ferdinand of Parma was indeed quite problematic, at least in the early years. It seems that it got better with time and they settled into compatibility later on. I think the court troubles in Parma were also entangled with Ferdinand's minister, Du Tillot. Despite popular belief and what most historians say, Ferdinand disliked his minister even before he married Amalia (a letter from grandfather Louis XV dated in May 1769 asked his grandson to remember the good service Du Tillot did to his parents and that there was no one to replace him at that point). Amalia's behavior then was indeed quite unconventional... but even after all those scandals and being called 'La Matta' and 'La Signora', I've read that she was popular in Parma (one of France's diplomats, exiled during the French revolution and who stayed in Parma for sometime, reported that she had an extraordinary reputation in the duchy).\n\nIndeed, Maria Theresa wanted to gain influence more influence in the Italian peninsula so Amalia's match with Ferdinand of Parma suited her. He was also the favorite grandson of Louis XV.\n\nI've read that MT and Amalia never fully reconciled... but most authors said that it was Amalia who didn't want to...... but I believe their relationship wasn't always totally rocky all those years....for instance, I've read MT gave advice to Amalia regarding her husband's infidelities (she complained about it to her mother-- a credible Austrian historian cited this in a book on the Habsburgs).... and it seems that they agreed on a compromise to meet in Gorizia (then part of the Habsburg lands), nearer to the Italian border, rather than in Vienna sometime in 1776 but it didn't push through due to MT's ill-health (Leopold and his family were also invited make the trip). I do know that MT sent the painter Johann Zoffany to paint a group portrait of Amalia's 4 eldest children in 1778 (the painting is called \"Four Grandchildren of Maria Theresa) and said painting showed a letter to the Empress from her grandchildren in the background so there seems to be some communication between Vienna and Parma. Some German and Hungarian sources say that MT allowed family visits and letters to Parma later on, as she realized what sort of man she forced her daughter to marry (a letter to Count Mercy as early as 1773 corrobated this as MT said she was 'sorry for her daughter with that fool of a husband').\n\nI've also read that Marie-Antoinette and Marie Caroline were very close and loved each other dearly. However, I've read that Marie-Therese-Charlotte, Madame Royale, was named after her godparents, MT and Charles III of Spain. It was Louis-Charles (Louis XVII) who was named after MC, and she was his godmother. When MC's granddaughter and great-niece Marie Louise married Napoleon I, MC exclaimed that she was 'grandmother to the devil!'.\n\nThere was indeed a whole lot of letters from MT to her children and vice versa. However, I am not that convinced that all the letters that were written by MT were loving, many of them were scolding/nagging...... and all of the children (except Mimi, the favorite) seemed to resent, in different degrees, their mother's controlling nature... even the ones left in Vienna. Perhaps MT meant her letters to be 'loving' but it certainly didn't come out that way to them most of the time.\n\nWell, portraits can be on the flattering side at times.... especially Elisabeth Vigee Le Brun. I seem to remember reading that King Gustavus III of Sweden said that MA was already too fat (sometime 1784-87) to be considered a beauty and Joseph told Mimi that their sister had the fine face of a fat German (or similar) so it seems clear that she wasn't able to maintain her earlier beauty. But I think she was still quite beautiful, at any rate.\n\nI think Josepha and Elisabeth resemble each other more and MA resembled Carolina and Amalia more. But most had similar features: big blue eyes, rosy white skin, aquiline nose, light hair, and the Habsburg lip, among others.\n\nWhat do you mean by 'Habsburg looking'? The Habsburgs, before Maria Theresa and her daughters, were not known for being good-looking. They had longish faces, the Habsburg jaw, the Habsburg lip, and their other features were not attractive either. So I do not think MA's sisters resembled their Habsburg ancestors or were too 'Habsburg'.\n\nMT's mother, the famously beautiful Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, brought in new blood to the family (she had a definite resemblance to Elisabeth and Amalia). The Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs were so inbred and mostly unattractive, even -- sorry --- horrible looking at times (Charles II of Spain for instance). When MT married Franz Stephen, their progeny became even more beautiful than MT and her siblings. After that generation though, the succeeding Habsburgs rather had the Habsburg look again -- it did not help that MT married off 5 of her children to that generation of Bourbons, a (mostly) unattractive bunch, and the succeeding generation(s) mostly married their cousins, too!"
