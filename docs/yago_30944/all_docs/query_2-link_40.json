        "text": "Spanish Monarchy 1475–1833\n\nThe Spanish monarchs were avid collectors of art, ranging from paintings and jewellery to tapestries. Much of it was used to decorate their palaces. However, each member of the Royal Family had their own interests and particular tastes. Monarchs including Philip II and Philip IV were passionate collectors of Italian art, and some of the wives of various kings also loved Italian art. As the Prado is now home to much of the art collected by the Royal Family, its collection reflects the tastes of the monarchs seen below. Click on images for details."
