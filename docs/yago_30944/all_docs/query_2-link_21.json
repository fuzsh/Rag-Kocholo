        "text": "Princess María de las Mercedes of Orléans (June 24, 1860 – June 26, 1878) was Queen of Spain as the first wife of King Alfonso XII of Spain. She was born in Madrid, the daughter of Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nHer father, Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, was her first cousin once removed, and the youngest son of King Louis-Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nHer mother, Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, was the younger daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain was the sister King Fernando VII of Spain, the father of Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nInfanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain elder sister was Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBorn at the Palacio Real in Madrid on June 24, 1860, Mercedes was the sixth of her parents’ nine children. Her mother’s elder sister, Queen Isabella II, and brother-in-law, King Francisco, served as Mercedes’ godparents at her christening, when she was given the names: María de las Mercedes Isabel Francisca de Asís Antonia Luisa Fernanda Felipa Amalia Cristina Francisca de Paula Ramona Rita Cayetana Manuela Juana Josefa Joaquina Ana Rafaela Filomena Teresa Santísima Trinidad Gaspara Melchora Baltasara et omni sancti.\n\nAlthough Mercedes was patrilineally a French Princess, she was also a Spanish infanta and spent the first eight years of her life in Spain. Her childhood was spent at the Palace of San Telmo in Andalusia, her father’s rumoured aspirations to obtain his sister-in-law’s crown periodically rendering him unwelcome at the royal court in Madrid.\n\nMarriage and reign\n\nWhen Queen Isabella II was deposed in 1868, Mercedes’ family left Spain for exile. It was reportedly during that banishment in 1872 that she met her first cousin Infante Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, also living in exile. Queen Isabella II opposed a marriage between the two due to the hostilities between Mercedes’ father and the former Queen.\n\nUpon restoration, King Alfonso XII of Spain married María de las Mercedes at the church of Atocha in Madrid on January 23, 1878, following a huge ball in December 1877. Allegedly, the King’s choice dashed the hopes of his still-exiled mother Queen Isabella for Alfonso’s marriage to Infanta Blanca de Bourbon, daughter of his Carlist rival Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid.\n\nInfanta Blanca of Spain (1868 – 1949) was the eldest child of Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain and his wife Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma. Blanca was a member of the House of Bourbon and – according to the Carlists – an Infanta of Spain by birth.\n\nIn 1889 she married Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria. The couple had ten children. The family left Austria after the end of the Monarchy and finally settled in Barcelona. When the male line of Blanca’s family died out at the death of her uncle, Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, some of the Carlists recognized her as the legitimate heiress to the Spanish throne.\n\nQueen Mercedes helped build a new temple after the Church of Santa María de la Almudena was demolished in 1868.\n\nDeath\n\nShortly after their honeymoon, it became evident that Queen Mercedes suffered from typhoid fever. The marriage would last only six months, during which she reportedly had a miscarriage. She died due to the fever on June 26, 1878, just two days after her 18th birthday.\n\nWhen the King’s minister Cánovas del Castillo suggested that he take a new wife, King Alfonso XII acquiesced, choosing Mercedes’ sister Infanta María Cristina. For a few months he courted Infanta María Cristina, who was willing to replace her late sister, but it soon became clear that she was suffering from tuberculosis. Maria Cristina died at the age of 26 on April 28, 1879 in her native Seville\n\nIn late 1879, the King married Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen; a daughter of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria (grandson of Emperor Leopold II) and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria, the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nPalatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria, was the ninth child and seventh son of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of parents, King Carlos III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nThe eldest child, of King Alfonso XII and Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen was Infanta María de las Mercedes (1880 – 1904) was named in honour of Queen Mercedes. She was Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life.\n\nHad her younger sibling, unborn at the death of King Alfonso XII, been a daughter, Mercedes would have been Queen of Spain. The sibling proved to be a boy, King Alfonso XIII, a King upon his birth in 1886, and Mercedes turned out not to be queen.\n\nShe resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death, and was succeeded in it by her own infant son Prince Alfonso of the Two Sicilies, King Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child.\n\nMercedes married in Madrid on February 14, 1901, to her second cousin, Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a nephew of the King of the then-defunct Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, who was elevated to the rank of Infante of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law’s ties with the Carlists. She died three years later from complication while giving birth to her third child.\n\nPrince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier (July 31, 1824 – February 4, 1890), was a member of the French royal family from the House of Orléans.\n\nHRH Prince Antoine Marie Philippe Louis d’Orléans was the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nPrince Antoine’s grandmother, Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, the thirteenth child of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in her own right.\n\nPrince Antoine was styled as HRH The Duke of Montpensier. He was born on July 31, 1824 at the château de Neuilly and died February 4, 1890 at Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain.\n\nOn October 10, 1846 at Madrid, Spain, he married Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, the daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his wife Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain had ten children (one stillborn in 1857):\n\n1. Maria Isabel (1848–1919), who married her first cousin Philippe, comte de Paris (1838–94), the French claimant, and became known as Marie Isabelle, comtesse de Paris. She had several children.\n\n2. Maria Amelia (1851–1870)\n\n3. Maria Cristina (1852–1879)\n\n4. Maria de la Regla (1856–1861)\n\n5. Fernando (1859–1873)\n\n6. Mercedes (1860–1878), otherwise Princess Marie des Graces d’Orleans-Montpensier, who married her first cousin Alfonso XII and is historically known as Mercedes of Orleans, Queen of Spain. No children.\n\n7. Felipe Raimundo Maria (1862–1864)\n\n8. Antonio (1866–1930), became Duke of Galliera in Italy. He married his first cousin Infanta Eulalia of Spain (1864–1958), daughter of Queen Isabella II, and had two sons.\n\n9. Luis Maria Felipe Antonio (1867–1874)\n\nCandidate for the Spanish throne\n\nPrince Antoine de Montpensier lived in Spain from 1848 when he and his family had to leave France after the Revolution of 1848. During the Spanish revolution of 1868, he supported the insurgents under Juan Prim against Queen Isabel II, his own sister-in-law.\n\nIn 1870 he fought a duel against Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, the brother of King Francisco of Spain, and killed him.\n\nInfante Enrique, Duke of Seville was the grandson of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife, Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies (1804–1844), who was the daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain.\n\nInfante Enrique of Spain became the first Duke of Seville in 1823. He was known for his progressive, even revolutionary, ideas during the reign of his double first cousin and sister-in-law, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1870, Enrique published several pamphlets and articles hostile to his cousin, Antoine, Duke of Montpensier for the duke’s alleged aspirations on the Spanish throne. Enrique challenged Montpensier to a duel, which took place near La Fortuna in Leganés, Madrid, on March 12, 1870. Enrique was shot and killed, removing him as a public critic of the Duke of Montpensier.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier was convicted and sentenced to one month in prison.\n\nEnrique’s eldest son, Enrique de Borbón y Castellví, 2nd Duke of Seville, refused to accept the 30,000 pesetas that the Duke of Montpensier offered as compensation.\n\nEnrique, who was no longer an Infante of Spain, could not be buried in El Escorial, but was buried in the Saint Isidore Cemetery, in Madrid.\n\nAfter the marriage of Queen Isabella II of Spain and his brother, Infante Francisco de Asís, Infante Enrique went into a self imposed exile into Belgium. While in France, Infante Enrique several times proclaimed himself a revolutionary, and was asked to join the International Workingmen’s Association.\n\nOn May 13, 1848 he was stripped of his Royal Rank and titles (his children, being born of a morganatic marriage to, Elena María de Castellví y Shelly, were untitled). In 1849 he asked the Queen’s forgiveness in order to return from exile. Enrique’s ducal title was restored, but not the title and style of HRH Infante of Spain.\n\nOn November 16, 1870 the Cortes voted for the next king and chose Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, with 191 votes.\n\nPrince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta was the third child and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, who would later become the first King of a unified Italy, and of Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Archduke Rainer of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Prince Amadeo was granted the hereditary title of Duke of Aosta from birth.\n\nPrince Antoine only received 27 votes, and left Spain, only to return in 1874. His ambitions were fulfilled by his daughter Princess Mercedes of Orléans, who became Queen of Spain after her marriage to King Alfonso XII, son of Queen Isabella II. However, she died at the age of 18 without issue.\n\nDespite never reaching the throne, however, through cognates, he is an ancestor of all Spanish monarchs since Juan Carlos I. His great granddaughter Mercedes, Countess of Barcelona, was the mother of King Juan Carlos of Spain who assumed the throne in 1975 and later abdicated in favor of his son, King Felipe VI of Spain in 2014.\n\nEarly collector of photography\n\nThe Duke of Montpensier was an early collector of photography. His collection consisted of dozens of albums and hundreds of early photographs, mainly of Spanish, French and British photographers. The collection was dispersed after his death.\n\nMaria Christina as Regent\n\nOn December 28, 1833, three short months after the death of Fernando VII, Maria Christina had secretly married an ex-sergeant from the royal guard, Agustín Fernando Muñoz (1808–1873). Maria Christina and Muñoz had several children together while trying to keep their marriage a secret. This fact certainly proves that Maria Christina was carrying on an affair with Muñoz during her marriage with the king.\n\nIf Maria Christina had officially made the marriage public, she would have forfeited the regency; but her relations with Muñoz were perfectly well known within the Spanish court. When on 13 August 1836 the soldiers on duty at the summer palace La Granja mutinied and forced the regent to grant a constitution, it was generally, though wrongly, believed that they overcame her reluctance by seizing Muñoz, whom they called her guapo, or fancy man, and threatening to shoot him.\n\nAgustín Fernando Muñoz\n\nEventually, news of Maria Christina’s marriage to this low-ranking soldier became public. That news made Maria Christina deeply unpopular. Her position was undermined by news of her remarriage and concerns that she was not actually supportive of her liberal ministers and their policies. Eventually, the army, which was the backbone of Isabella II’s support, and the liberal leadership in the Cortes combined to demand that Maria Christina stand aside from the regency. In 1840 Maria Christina found her position intolerable; she renounced the regency and left Spain with Muñoz. The army commander, General Baldomero Espartero, Count of Luchana, replaced her as regent.\n\nMaria Christina Later in life.\n\nIn 1842 Maria Christina purchased the Château de Malmaison as their residence. In 1843, on the overthrow of General Baldomero Espartero they returned to Spain. In 1844, Muñoz’s stepdaughter Queen Isabella II was declared to be of age. On 23 June 1844 Isabella gave to Muñoz the title duque de Riánsares, to which was attached a Grandeza de España; the title came from the river Riánsares, near Muñoz’s birthplace in Tarancón. On October 12, 1844 Isabella gave official consent to the marriage between her mother and Muñoz, and it was publicly performed.\n\nIn 1846 Isabella made Muñoz a Knight of the Golden Fleece. On May 30, 1846 she gave Muñoz a second title, marqués de San Agustín. Muñoz was made a Captain General, the highest rank in the Spanish Army. In 1847 Louis Philippe, King of the French, gave Muñoz the title duc de Montmorot; he also invested Muñoz with the Grand Cross of the Légion d’honneur. In 1854, Maria Christina left for France a second time. France remained her primary residence for the remainder of her life.\n\nIn 1846, by the express request of the former president Juan José Flores, the Queen participated in an attempt to restore the monarchy in Ecuador. This two-phase plan was first that her son Agustín Muñoz of Bourbon should become King of Ecuador, and later in restorer of the Spanish monarchy in Perú and Bolivia, converting the child in the monarch of the tentative United Kingdom of Ecuador, Perú and Bolivia, with herself and Flores as Regents. When everything was organized, the attempt was denounced by the press and Latin American diplomats, and plans collapsed.\n\nDeath and burial\n\nMaria Christina’s illness returned and she suffered from serious coughing, fainting and fever. She died in Le Havre, France on August 22, 1878, aged 72. As the mother of Isabella II, Maria Christina was buried in the royal crypt of El Escorial.\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies (April 27, 1806 – August 22, 1878) was queen consort of Spain from 1829 to 1833 and regent of the Kingdom from 1833 to 1840.\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies was born in Palermo, Sicily the daughter of King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and his second wife, Maria Isabella of Spain. King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies was the son of Ferdinand I of the Two Siclies (who was the third son of King Carlo VII-V of Naples and Sicily by his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony.) By the way, King Carlo VII-V of Naples and Sicily was also King Carlos III of Spain.\n\nCarlos IV of Spain\n\nMaría Isabella of Spain\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies’ mother, Maria Isabella of Spain, was the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. This means her parents were first cousins; her grand fathers (Carlos IV of Spain & King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies) were brothers.\n\nOn May 27, 1829, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, Queen Consort of Spain as the third wife of King Fernando VII of Spain, died. Fernando VII, old and ill, had gone his entire reign without producing a male heir, sparking a succession duel between the Infanta Maria Francisca and the Infante Carlos, and the Infanta Luisa Carlotta and the Infante Francisco de Paula. Fernando VII declared his intention to marry and assembled the Council of Castile, who tasked the King with remarriage.\n\nKing Fernando VII of Spain\n\nFollowing Luisa Carlotta’s suggestion, Fernando VII sent for Maria Christina of the Two Siclies, his niece, who had already given birth to a child and pleased the King’s eyes. The two were wed on December 12, 1829 at the Church of the Atocha.\n\nWith her betrothal and then marriage to Fernando VII, Maria Christina became embroiled in the conflict between the Spanish Liberals and the Carlists. The Liberal faction, and the Spanish people, greatly revered Maria Christina, and made her their champion; when she first arrived in Madrid in 1829, the blue of the cloak she wore became their official color. The Carlist’s were absolutists and highly conservative, and derived their name from the Infante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina who they favored for the throne. Using King Felipe V’s enactment of Salic law, which banned women from taking the throne.\n\nFernando VII and Maria Christina produced two daughters, Isabella in October 1830 and Luisa Fernanda the next year. However, in a secret session of the Cortes in 1789, King Carlos IV reversed the Salic Law of succession with the Pragmatic Sanction. Seeking to secure the succession of an heir of his siring, no matter their gender, Ferdinand VII announced the Pragmatic Sanction in March 1830. The Pragmatic Sanction removed the Salic system established by Felipe V of Spain and returned Spain to a a male preferred primogeniture, similar to the British style of mixed succession that gave succession rights to women. This type of system of succession predated the Bourbon monarchy in Spain.\n\nOn the trip to La Granja, Fernando VII was badly injured by a coach accident. He became ill and increasingly sick over the summer. At one point, Fernando VII was found unconscious at the palace chapel. Seeking council in the event of Fernando VII’s death, Maria Christina approached the Carlist Francisco Calomarde, who advised her that the Spanish people would rally behind Infante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina.\n\nInfante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina (March 29, 1788 – March 10, 1855) was an Infante of Spain and the second surviving son of King Carlos IV of Spain and of his wife, Maria Luisa of Parma and the younger brother of King Fernando VII.\n\nInfante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina\n\nFearing the actions of Infante Carlos de Borbón, and wanting to make him his ally, Maria Christina coerced Fernando VII into signing a decree making her regent if he died, with Infante Carlos de Borbón, as her chief adviser. Infante Carlos de Borbón refused, demanding total governance. Calomarde, with Maria Francisca and Maria Theresa, reissued his warning, coercing the King and Queen into repealing the Pragmatic Sanction.\n\nWhen Fernando VII appeared to have died, the repealing was announced publicly, and Maria Christina was deserted by her courtiers. Fernando VII was discovered to be alive, and news of this also spread. Altogether, Luisa Carlotta, at that time in Andalusia, soon arrived at La Granja and speedily re-enacted the Pragmatic Sanction and orchestrated Calomarde’s dismissal.\n\nWhen Fernando VII actually did die on September 29, 1833, Maria Christina became regent for their daughter, proclaimed Queen Isabella II of Spain. Isabella’s claim to the throne was disputed by Infante Carlos de Borbón who claimed that his brother Ferdinand had unlawfully changed the succession law to permit females to inherit the crown.\n\nInfante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina immediately claimed the throne of Spain after the death of his older brother King Fernando VII in 1833. Claiming the style and title, King Carlos V of Spain, first of the Carlist claimants to the throne of Spain, he was a reactionary who stridently opposed liberalism in Spain and the assaults on the Catholic Church. His claim was contested by liberal forces loyal to the dead king’s infant daughter, the new Queen Isabella II. The result was the bloody First Carlist War (1833–1840).\n\nIsabella II as a child. She is depicted wearing the sash of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa.\n\nSome supporters of infante Carlos went so far as to claim that Fernando had actually bequeathed the crown to his brother but that Maria Christina had suppressed that fact. It was further alleged that the Queen had signed her dead husband’s name to a decree recognizing Isabella as heir. Despite considerable support for Carlos from conservative elements in Spain, the Liberal faction supporting Queen María Christina as Regent, successfully retained the throne for her daughter.\n\nKing Alfonso XII of Spain\n\nIn examining the lineage of King Alfonso XII of Spain I mentioned that most of us commoners have eight unrelated great-grandparents. Alfonso XII only had four great-grandparents, and even then they were all from the House of Bourbon. These four individuals were his paternal great-grandparents as we have seen:\n\nCarlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain\n\nIn examining his maternal great-grandparents we find these same four individuals:\n\nCarlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain\n\nThe difference of course is in who their children were and whom they were married to. For example, paternally Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma had Infante Francisco de Paula, Duke of Cádiz who married his niece Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies daughter of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain.\n\nHowever, on Alfonso XII’s maternal side, Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma had King Fernando VII of Spain who married, as his fourth wife his, niece Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, (her mother wife, Maria Isabella of Spain’s older brother).\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies\n\nTherefore, maternally, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, parents were of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain.\n\nThis means that these two sisters of the House of Bourbon-Two Siclies (below) each married their uncles (who were brothers) of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon.\n\n* Luisa Carlotta (1804–1844), who married her mother’s younger brother Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain.\n\n* María Cristina (1806–1878), who married firstly her uncle Ferdinand VII of Spain (her mother’s older brother);\n\nThey were King Alfonso XII’s grand parents.\n\nHis paternal grand parents were Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies and they were the parents of King Alfonso XII’s father…Infante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz.\n\nFrancisco married Queen Isabella II of Spain, his double first cousin, on October 10, 1846. There is evidence that Isabella would rather have married his younger brother, Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, and complained bitterly about her husband’s effeminate habits after their first night together.\n\nInfante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz\n\nAlfonso XII’s maternal grandparents (his maternal side is where he derived his claim to the throne) were King Fernando VII of Spain Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies and they were the parents of his mother, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nIsabella II, was Queen of Spain from 1833 until 1868. She came to the throne as an infant, but her succession was disputed by the Carlists, whose refusal to recognize a female sovereign led to the Carlist Wars. After a troubled reign, she was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1868, and formally abdicated in 1870. Her son, Alfonso XII, became king in 1874.\n\nIsabella II, was Queen of Spain\n\nWith Alfonso XII being the result of multiple first cousin marriages and two uncle-niece unions, he should have been as inbred as his predecessor King Carlos II of Spain. The fact that Alfonso XII did not suffer from the curse of inbreeding like Carlos II has given rise to the speculation that Infante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz was not the real father of King Alfonso XII. That will be the topic of the next post on the lineage of King Alfonso XII."
