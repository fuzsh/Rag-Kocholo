        "text": "May 30 1845- the birth of Amadeo I of Spain.\n\nHe was born Prince Amadeo of Savoy in Turin. He was the son of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and his wife Adelaide. His mother was born Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, a daughter of Archduke Rainier of Austria. Her father was a son of Leopold II, Holy Roman emperor. His parents had 8 children together. He was their third child and second son. His father later had 2 children from a morganatic marriage.\n\nHis full siblings:\n\n-Marie Clotilde- married Prince Napoleon Bonaparte, a son of Joseph Bonapart. Was the mother of three children.\n\n-Umberto- became Umberto I of Italy. His wife Margherita was a daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa. Parents of Victor Emmanuel III.\n\n-Prince Oddone, Duke of Montferrat: died at the age of 19. He suffered major health issues during his short life.\n\n-Maria Pia: married Luis I of Portugal. Had two sons.\n\n-Carlo Alberto: died as a child\n\n-Vittorio Emmanuel: died the day he was born\n\n-a second Vittorio Emmanuel: died at nearly four months old\n\nHe was titled Duke of Aosta from birth. He fought during the third world of Italian Independence and made the rank of major general. After his marriage he was also made a vice-admiral in the royal navy. He gave up the position when he came to the Spanish throne.\n\nAfter Isabella II was deposed from the throne, Spain decided to install a new monarchy. Amadeo who was a descendent of Philip II through his daughter Infanta Catalina, was chosen to head the new dynasty. On November 16, 1870 he was elected king, and swore his oath January 2. Unfortunately the general who had been his biggest supporter at the time was assassinated which would lead to a rough reign for him.\n\nUprisings began in major cities, and in the Catalan and Basque regions. The artillery corps went on strike. the king was advised of the danger to his life but he ignored and an attempt was made on his life. His carriage that he and his wife were riding in was attacked and shot up. The horses and carriage were hit but none of the passengers were harmed.\n\nFeb 11, 1873 Amadeo abdicated the throne and Spain became a republic. He made an appearance in the courts declaring Spain ungovernable. He reign lasted just over 2 years. The republic would end in 1874 with the ascension of Alfonso XII, the son of Isabella II.\n\nDisgusted with Spain he returned home to Italy and resumed his role as Duke of Aosta. He spent the remainder of his life in Turin. He died January 18, 1890. Puccini's famous elegy Crisantemi was composed in his honor as they were friends.\n\nAmadeo was married twice.\n\nHis first wife and short lived queen consort was Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo. She was the daughter of Carlo Emmanuele dal Pozzo, 5th Prince of Cisterna. His father originally opposed the match wishing a German marriage instead. For all of her father's princely title the family wasn't royal, simply Piedmont nobility. But Maria Vittoria was the sole heir to her father's extensive fortune and the king was convinced to allow them to marry. They married May 30 1867. The wedding was marred by the death of the station master who fell under their honeymoon train. She would die in 1876.\n\nShe gave her husband three children:\n\n-Emanuele Filiberto- succeeded his father as 2nd Duke of Aosta. Married to Princess Helene of Orleans. They had 2 sons.\n\n-Prince Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Turin: he died unmarried\n\n-Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi: never married. Had a relationship with a Somali woman named Faduma Ali.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife Amadeo married his niece Maria Letizia Bonaparte. She was the daughter of his eldest sister Maria Clotilde and her husband Napoloeon Joseph Bonaparte. She bore him one son.\n\n-Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi: he died of the Spanish flu during WWI.\n\nTechnically could have been in the Italian thread as well, but since Amadeo served for a time as King of Spain I put him here.\n\nJune 2, 1418 death of Catherine of Lancaster, Queen of Castile (yes could have been British thread to but decided to go by her marriage and kids).\n\nCatherine was the daughter of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and his second wife Constance of Castile. Her paternal grandparents were Edward III and Philippa of Hainault. And her maternal grandparents were Peter I of Castile and his first wife María de Padilla. Peter had been assassinated by his half-brother who had seized the throne of Castile.\n\nCatherine was one of 2 children from her father's marriage. She had 10 half-siblings (4 of whom were born during her parents' marriage).\n\nHer siblings:\n\n-Philippa: married John of Portugal. Had eight children. Including the famous 'Henry the Navigator' (1st wife)\n\n-John: died at 3\n\n-Elizabeth: married 3 times including John Holland, Duke of Exeter. She had 8 children from her last 2 marriages (first was annulled)\n\n-Edward: died the year he was born\n\n-Henry: became Henry IV. Married Mary de Bohun and Joanna of Navarre. Had six kids with his first wife including Henry V.\n\n-Isabel: last child of the 1st wife. died in first year of life.\n\n-John: Catherine's only full sibling. died as an infant\n\n-John: Earl of Sommerset (1st child by third wife Katherine Swynford). Married Margaret Holland. Father of 6, great-grandfather of Henry VII.\n\n-Henry: bishop of Winchester\n\n-Thomas: Duke of Exeter, married Margaret Neville. no children\n\n-Joan: married twice. 2 children by Robert Ferrers, 5th Baron Boteler of Wem. And 14 by Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. Her daughter Cecily by her second husband was mother of Edward IV and Richard III.\n\nCatherine was born March 31, 1373 in Hertford castle which was her father's primary residence.\n\nIn 1385 John of Portugal defeated the Catilian army and cemented Portugal's independence. At the time John encouraged Catherine's father to come and assert his wife's claim to Castile. The current king of Castile John I was Constance's half-cousin. He was the son of Henry II, Constance's Uncle who had assassinated her father and took his throne. Constance's only brother had died, and she was the eldest living sister (her younger sister Isabella was married to the duke of York, her older sister had been a nun and had died by this time). Catherine accompanied her parents to Portugal. They cemented the alliance with Portugal against Castile with the marriage of her half sister Philippa to John of Portugal.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to take Leon, her father came to an agreement with John of Castile. In return for Constance giving up her claim to the Castile throne, her daughter Catherine would marry his son Henry. The marriage added legitimacy to John's line as well as ending the Spanish side of the hundred years war. Henry was his father's heir.\n\nSeptember 17, 1388 Catherine was married to the nine year old Henry. She was 15. They were married at Palencia cathedral. In 1390 her husband became Henry III when his father died, but he was not declared of age to rule until 1393. Catherine's only contribution to his reign was giving him three children. She was a great supporter though of the Dominican order and she was a staunch supporter of the anti Pope.\n\nHer husband died in 1406. She was named by her husband as co-regent to her son John II until he came of age. She shared the duty with her brother in law Ferdinand I of Aragon. Catherine was to have relinquished custody of her son to two nobles though. She prepared to defend herself in her castle Alcázar of Segovia, as she refused to give up her infant son. Ferdinand though stepped in and worked it out to allow her to retain custody.\n\nCatherine was given control of Castile and Leon. She was a strong leader who while their French alliances weakened, strengthened their bonds with Portugal and England. She worked closely with her brother Henry IV to strengthen trade between their two kingdoms.\n\nUnfortunately when Ferdinand died in 1416 she lost most of her power. She had been backed by his rivals and they no longer supported her. She died 2 years later leaving her 13 year old son to the hands of courtiers.\n\nShe is buried with her husband at the Cathedral of Toledo.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathe...ia/File:Sepulcro_de_Catalina_de_Lancáster.JPG\n\nCatherine of Aragon, her great-granddaughter, was named for her.\n\nCatherine bore her husband three children. She and her brother in law/co-regent Ferdinand arranged to marry all 3 of her children one of his children.\n\n-Maria: married Ferdinand's eldest son Alfonso V of Aragon. Their marriage was childless, and he was succeeded by his brother John II.\n\n-Catherine: married Ferdinand's fourth child and 3rd son Henry, Duke of Villena. She died after suffering a miscarriage with their first child. The Duke of Villena title had been given to Henry by Catherine's brother John. John reclaimed the title after his sister died.\n\n-John: became John II as an infant. He married Ferdinand's oldest daughter Maria. They had four children but only their son the future Henry IV made it to adulthood. He later married Isabella of Portugal. Isabella's father John of Portugal was the son of Philippa of Lancaster (Catherine's half sister) and John I of Portugal. He had 2 children from this marriage. By this second marriage he was father of Isabella I (Isabella and Ferdinand) and grandfather of Catherine of Aragon.\n\n-\n\nJune 21, 1528- Birth of Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress.\n\nMaria was born in Madrid. Her father was Charles V of Spain and her mother was Isabella of Portugal. Her father was the son of Juana and Mad and Philip the handsome of Castile. Her mother was the daughter of Manuel I of Portugal and Maria of Aragon. Her parents were first cousins, their mothers Juana and Maria were the children of Ferdinand and Isabella. Maria was the second of three children of the couple.\n\nPhilip: succeeded his father as Philip II. Was married four times. His first wife Maria Manuela of Portugal was his double first cousin (her father was his maternal Uncle John III of Portugal and her mother was his paternal Aunt Catherine of Austria). His second wife was Mary I of England was his first cousin once removed (Catherine of Aragon was an aunt to both his parents, sister to Maria and Juana). His third wife was Elizabeth of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France. And his fourth wife was his niece Anna of Austria. He had 11 children by 3 wives, only 4 of whom reached adulthood. His heir Philip III was a son by his last wife.\n\nJoanna: Had a short marriage to John Manuel of Portugal, the crown prince. She arrived in Portugal in November 1552 and he died in January 1554 from TB. She bore him a posthumous son Sebastian less then 3 weeks later. Her son would be Sebastian I of Portugal. She left her son in the care of his paternal grandmother Queen Catherine. Catherine was Joanna's Aunt, she was Charles V's sister. She returned home to Madrid to serve as her brother's regent. She never saw her son again.\n\nTheir mother died in 1539 Maria was 11 (Philip was 12 and Joanna was 4). The three siblings were extremely close growing up, building a bond and relying on each other when their father was often away. That closeness would remain through their lives.\n\nIn September 1548 she was married to her cousin Archduke Maximillian. Maximillian's father Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor was the younger brother of Charles V. His mother was of Anne of Bohemia.\n\nWhile her father was busy away in Germany, Maria served as regent with her husband from 1548 to 1551 because of the absence of her brother. In 1552 though the couple moved to Vienna and the court of her father in law.\n\nMaria returned home to Madrid in 1558 and served as regent this time for her brother Philip till 1561. Philip had succeeded their father in September of that year.\n\nShe returned to join her husband. Her father in law died in 1564 and her husband succeeded him as Emperor Maximillian II. As empress she was said to be uncomfortable in a country that was not completely catholic, and her husband was ambivalent to religion. She surrounded herself with strict catholic courtiers and among her favorites were those who had come from Spain with her including her ladies in waiting.\n\nHer husband died after 28 years of marriage in 1576. She remained at the imperial court for six years following his death. And held a great deal of influence over her sons during that time.\n\nShe returned home for good in 1582 with her daughter Margaret.Margaret was intended to marry Philip II who had been widowed a 4th time but she chose instead to take vows as a nun. Maria refused to return home to Germany, not wanting to spend the rest of her life in a land she felt was filled with heretics, and remained in Spain where she joined Convent of Las Descalzas Reales.

Her son Rudolf had six children with his long time mistress Catherine Strada.\n\nTheir son Julius suffered from schizophrenia. His father sent him to Český Krumlov castle which he gave to his son as his seat. Unfortunately his son fell for a woman named Marketa, who was the daughter of a local barber. He convinced her parents to allow her to live with him. He beat her so bad he thought she was dead and threw her out a window. Amazingly as she landed on a trash heap she survived though she was in horrid shape. When her father refused to return Marketa to Julius when Julius learned she was alive, he imprisoned her father. He later killed Marketa, chopping her body to pieces so she had to be placed in her coffin like that. His father had him imprisoned for the rest of his life.\n\nJuly 6, 1789 birth of Maria Isabella of Spain.\n\nMaria was the daughter of Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma. Her mother was the daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma (son of Philip V of Spain) and Louise Elisabeth of France (daughter of Louis XV). Her parents had fourteen children, 7 of whom reached adulthood.

Her only younger sibling to reach adulthood. married his niece Princess Luisa Carlotta of Naples and Sicily and had 11 children. He had a son from a second morganatic marriage.\n\nIsabella was suggested as a wife for Emperor Napoleon. Napoleon turned down such a suggestion. He thought the Bourbon family was too broken and didn't see any power into taking a bride from the house.\n\nInstead attention turned to her cousin Francis I of the Two Sicilies in 1801 when she was 12. Francis was married at the time though. His wife Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria had born him only one child who survived infancy, a daughter Maria-Caroline (who would become Duchess of Berry). She died from consumption in November 1801 though, a year after giving birth to a son who died in infancy. Their son died in July before his mother and their daughter was 3. Francis was 24.\n\nA double wedding had been proposed by the French ambassador to cement alliances. Isabella would marry Francis, and her brother Ferdinand would marry Francis' sister Maria Antonio. Francis' mother Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples was opposed to the marriages as she didn't like the Spanish bond with France.\n\nEven in those times her age was extremely young. She was married on her 13th birthday in Madrid, with her brother Ferdinand standing proxy for the groom. They were married in person October 4 when Francis and his sister arrived, and it was followed by 8 days of celebration. On October 12, now known by the Italian Marie Isabella, she left with her new husband for Naples.\n\nMaria Isabella was quite plain and round, and looked much younger then her thirteen years. Her and her husband's family were forced into exile in Sicily during the Napoleonic wars. In 1816 with the protection of Austria her father in law was able to return to Naples, and joined his kingdoms as the Two Sicilies. He named his son Duke of Calabria. Francis and Maria Isabella remained in Sicily, and very rarely made trips to Naples. She frequently visited her parents when they were in exile, and was with her mother when she died.\n\nHer father in law died in 1825 and she became Queen of the two Sicilies. Her husband was 47, and more interested in farming then politics. His short reign as king was mainly reactionary. He didn't show any of the former liberal leanings he had during his crown prince days. Maria was even plumper from years of pregnancy and had never been the most intelligent woman, but she was very good hearted. She loved balls and the arts, and had no interest in politics.\n\nIn 1829 they went to Spain to attend the wedding of their daughter. She had been absent from Spain for 27 years and had convinced Francis to come with her even though he was suffering from gout. His health continued to deteriorate and he died back home in Naples November 8, 1830 at 53.\n\nHer and her son Ferdinand II had a cold relationship likely as she favored her second son over him. But his wife Maria Christina who she befriended help to mend fences between the two.\n\nMaria Isabella was known for her numerous affairs during her widowhood. She even had her son exile one of her lovers when he tried to claim rights through her. She eventually was married at the age of 50 to Francesco, Count dal Balzo dei Duchi di Presenzano. He was 34, a lieutenant from an ancient but poor family. They left court and lived at Palace of Capodimonte.\n\nDue to her loving character and generosity to the poor she was loved by the people of her husband's kingdom until her death. She died September 13, 1848 at 59 years old.\n\nHer and Francis had a loving marriage, he treated her with kindness, and welcomed twelve children.\n\n-Princess Luisa Carlotta: married Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain (her maternal uncle).
