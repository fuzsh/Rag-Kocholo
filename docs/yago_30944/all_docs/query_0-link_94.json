        "text": "Alright this TL has an Austrian-Italian personal union as a result. The initial POD is that Emperor Franz I of Austria gets Parma rather than Marie-Louise. Lots of butterflies emanate from there on which will eventually allow for a personal union.\n\nThe Cross and the Eagle\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT]​\n\nChapter I: Birth of the Union, 1815-1850.\n\n​\n\nThe Congress of Vienna was called for at the end of the Napoleonic Wars and it was also the beginning of a period of Habsburg interference in Italian affairs as the Austrian Empire gained from the removal of French power. In the Congress of Vienna under the guidance of Austrian prime minister Klemens von Metternich the Duchy of Parma was given to the Habsburgs. It was not seen fit to return it to the House of Bourbon-Parma which had collaborated willingly with Napoleonic France. Initially it would be awarded to Austrian Archduchess and former Empress of the French Marie-Louise, but it occurred to a number of diplomats that upon her death her son Napoleon François, Duke of Reichstadt, would inherit it. They were wary of leaving any kind of Bonaparte powerbase which could either attempt to restore Napoleon somewhere or that his son would turn out to be a chip off the old block that would cause a crisis in the future. Marie Louise was instead given the new and relatively meaningless title of Princely Countess of Milan which didn’t entail any serious ruling prerogatives. Parma was instead given to Emperor Franz I instead and the tiny Duchy of Lucca was carved out and given to the Bourbons as a consolation prize.\n\nWith Parma and Lombardy-Venetia under the direct rule of the Emperor of Austria Franz I and both the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Modena under the control of cadet branches of the Habsburgs, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine had a significant powerbase in northern Italy. Fate would intervene by stacking a whole lot of misery on the shoulders of the heir apparent of Charles Felix, Charles Albert who was heir since his distant cousin Charles Felix had no children during his entire ten year reign from 1821 to 1831. Charles Albert’s son Victor Emmanuel contracted typhus and died in his infancy in 1822 while his second child who would have been named Ferdinand was stillborn which put a strain on his marriage Maria Theresa of Austria, his second cousin once removed and the youngest daughter of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Several years went by before both partners could bear to attempt having a child again which led to a birth of a healthy daughter in 1831 named Maria Christina. Unfortunately, the House of Savoy used Salic Law which meant that Maria Christina couldn’t succeed to the throne barring the near impossible situation that there were no more capable male heirs or if Salic Law was ever abolished. She did restore harmony to Charles Albert’s marriage since she grew up without any health problems and was reportedly a child with a cheerful, inquisitive and kind personality around everyone she met, making her quite popular at the royal court.\n\nCharles Albert succeeded to the throne the same year as his daughter’s birth as King of Piedmont-Sardinia. He was generally a standard conservative monarchy although he did have some sympathies toward liberalism which led him to concede a constitution (which did preserve a lot of royal power, making it a weak concession at best). Liberalist ideas from the urban and sometimes very progressive and anticlerical elites did induce him to take a less conservative stance toward succession laws and he fomented the desire to continue his line during the late 1830s and early 1840s. As things were at the time he’d be succeeded by some obscure, ridiculously distant cousin and so in a controversial decision he decided to abolish Salic Law so that his daughter could succeed him which aroused some unrest in Turin since his lawful successor showed up although he was bought off with money, titles and a few estates. Maria Christina was now his official heir apparent to the Sardinian throne and to Charles Albert’s relief she was healthy and happy. She started to receive the necessary preparation for her role as Queen of Piedmont-Sardinia and was notably influenced by liberal ideas that were brewing in 1840s Italy which led to conflict with her more conservative father. As she came of age she did gain in popularity massively among her people for her liberal ideas which included a constitution, a democratically elected parliament and Italian unification. Her father wanted to balance out her “radical” ideas by marrying her to a “suitable partner” (read: someone more conservative) and he believed that Archduke Franz Josef of Austria, the heir apparent to the Austrian throne (until the unlikely event that Ferdinand ever produced an heir which wouldn’t happen since he hadn’t consummated his marriage so far) would be a suitable match. It was partially inspired by fear of the liberal uprisings that had occurred in Spain and its Empire, Italy and Germany in the 1820s and 30s. This marriage also served a secondary purpose, namely Charles Albert’s hope that the marriage would allow for the Austrian Empire’s Italian lands to be transferred to Piedmont-Sardinia, making for a Sardinian Austrian-supported hegemony in northern Italy. Besides this, the soon to be queen needed a partner.\n\nThe two married in 1847 when she was 16 and he was 17 years of age, a very early marriage and the marriage immediately caught the attention of France with French King Louis Philippe I demanding that Franz Josef would renounce his right to the Austrian throne. With these recent geopolitical events the French government felt threatened since with a Habsburg on the Sardinian throne and the Habsburgs also in charge of the German Confederation, France could get surrounded by regions under Habsburg influence. Austria refused to force Franz Josef to renounce his claim to the throne and France declared war, thus igniting the short-lived War of the Sardinian Succession. A powerful French army with strength of 75.000 men invaded Piedmont in autumn 1847 and took Pinerolo which was a main crossroad in Italy and 20.000 men branched off and advanced to Aosta. The main force marched for and took Turin under the command of King Louis-Philippe himself and the Sardinian court including King Charles Albert, princess Maria Christina and her husband Franz Josef fled to the city of Alessandria near the border with Parma. Fortunately an army arrived under the command of field marshal Josef Radetzky. The Austro-Sardinian army supported by troops from Parma, Modena and Tuscany numbered 100.000 men. In the Battle of Carmagnola, a town south of Turin, Radetzky defeated the French army decisively; the French side had 15.000 men killed, wounded or missing while the Austrians had 7.000 killed, wounded or missing. Turin was retaken and in France pre-existing brewing unrest came to an eruption. In 1847, an economic crisis had erupted compounded by a potato blight in Belgium which led to a famine and massive epidemics of cholera and typhoid. This combined with frustrations from the bourgeoisie over lack of political power when compared to the aristocracy and frustrations from the peasantry and working classes over poverty, aristocratic control of the land and so on. In 1848, revolution commenced.\n\nUpon his return to France and his arrival in Marseilles with his ravaged army, King Louis-Philippe I was met with discontented mobs of peasants, workers and artisans and he fled back to Piedmont-Sardinia where he ironically requested political asylum. This was accepted and he moved with a small entourage to Florence in Tuscany where he would live out the remaining two years of his life. In the meantime, the revolutions spread across Europe with Britain being the only exception and they watched on as things developed. The Austrian Empire experienced an uprising in Hungary which threatened to tear the empire apart, especially after independence was declared and Hungarian army units declared their loyalty to the Hungarian Republic. In the Italian regions there were uprisings as well, which forced the conservative Charles Albert to abdicate among other things. In the midst of nationalist and liberal revolutionary unrest across northern Italian cities princess Maria Christina was crowned Queen of Piedmont-Sardinia and her husband, the young Austrian Archduke Franz Josef, was crowned prince consort. She immediately started to write down a liberal constitution and formed an elected parliament in Turin although only the upper and upper middle class tax brackets were allowed to vote since universal suffrage was still a little too far reaching at this point. The “Turin Parliament” became a rallying point for Italian nationalists while in the other Italian capitals massive Italian nationalist revolutions erupted which demanded Italian unification, particularly in northern Italy.\n\nDuring this chaotic episode, Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria was convinced by prince Felix zu Schwarzenberg, the aimed successor of the now disgraced former statesman Von Metternich, to abdicate in favour of heir presumptive Franz Josef. He was crowned Emperor of Austria in late 1848 and he agreed with his wife on the transfer of the lands of Lombardy-Venetia and Parma to Piedmont-Sardinia in order to obtain Italian assistance in squashing the Hungarians. Lombardy-Venetia (including South Tyrol) and Parma were ceded to Piedmont-Sardinia and the rulers of Modena and Tuscany agreed to form this new state while keeping their non-ruling privileges and titles. Franz Josef, however, despite his wife’s urging, didn’t want to take decisive action against the Pope and he wavered somewhat about what to do and in the end he did nothing. Pope Pius IX with support from the new French republican regime (which wanted a buffer to Habsburg power in Italy, even if it was the Pope) restored order in the Papal States. The northern Italian states – Piedmont-Sardinia, Parma, Modena, Tuscany, Lombardy-Venetia and Lucca which was pressured by its neighbours – unified into the Kingdom of Padania, a name which sprung from the Habsburg love for rarely used Latin names. Formally, the new state with Queen Maria Christina and prince consort Franz Josef as its monarchs was known as North Italy.\n\nIn return for Habsburg assent to Italian unifications, the new northern Italian kingdom sent an army of 30.000 men to assist the Austrians in squashing the Hungarian uprising. Martial law was declared across Hungary and dissidence was harshly suppressed by the Austrian army and mutinous Hungarian units were brought back in line with the execution of their superior officers. Maria Christina’s liberal ideas rubbed off on her husband thanks to her loveable character, fortunately, and Franz Josef decided to grant clemency to most revolutionary leaders and negotiate in order to prevent future uprisings. A devolved Hungarian parliament was formed in Budapest albeit with oversight powers from a newly formed Viennese parliament (which was more of a consultative body) and veto powers from the Emperor. In the meantime the revolution swept other countries in Europe too. The Netherlands saw a liberal constitution and Russia had to squash a Polish uprising. The Ottomans were faced with rebellions in the Balkans and in Germany pro-nationalist uprisings took place too although the “Frankfurt Parliament” partially inspired by the Turin Parliament was weak and divided between Catholics and Protestants, republicans and monarchists, and proponents of Kleindeutschland and Grossdeutschland. It was soon rendered powerless by Prussia although Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV was reluctant to accept any kind of imperial German crown, fearing the Austrian response. France heavily supported and lobbied for Friedrich Wilhelm to accept the German crown, as did the Pope and Russia who were wary of restored and growing Habsburg power and influence. Great Britain declared that the strong Austrian growth in power required a counterbalance to maintain the balance of power in Europe. With support from Russia, Great Britain and France the Kleindeutschland solution was accepted with Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV accepting the title Emperor of Germany, thus ending the turbulent 1848 revolutions. Austria in 1849 took the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies after the last Bourbon ruler, Ferdinand II, was overthrown by popular liberal and nationalist revolts and the name of the northern Italian kingdom was changed to Kingdom of Italy. Of the Italian states, only the Papal States were independent now, but this would change in the future.\n\nUpdate time .\n\nBtw, I have a request. I don't know if there are any artistically inclined members reading this, but I'd like to see a Coat of Arms for this new dynasty of 'Habsburg-Lorraine-Savoy'.\n\nChapter II: Peace and Prosperity, 1850-1890.\n\n​\n\nWith the inclusion of Italy into the Habsburg realm by means of a personal union, what was known as the Austro-Italian Empire had formed even if this empire was not a unitary state. Thanks to the liberal ideas of Maria Christina rubbing off on her young and still open to influence husband Franz Josef, the latter granted devolved parliaments to Bohemia, Illyria and Galicia-Lodomeria as well albeit with oversight powers from Vienna and veto powers for the Emperor, thus giving them some level of autonomy vis-à-vis Vienna just like the Hungarians already had. An Upper House consisting of the Empire’s aristocrats was also formed above the main parliament in Vienna. His mother Archduchess Sophie was opposed, but it was necessary and Franz Josef’s wife had instilled him with the spine to stand up to his mother because they both had grown to love each other even though it had been an arranged marriage. Still, the Empire remained somewhat authoritarian, especially when compared to the Italian half of the union which had its own liberal constitution and a more or less democratically elected unicameral parliament based in Turin. It was significantly more powerful than its counterpart in Vienna that was little more than a consultative/advisory organ which the Emperor could overrule if he so wished. Still it gave the discontented minorities a forum in which they could express their grievances in other ways than violent insurrection. The Emperor himself was better in touch with his people this way too. All in all, it made Austria a lot more cohesive.\n\nIn the meantime, an heir was born in 1849 that was named Franz Karl, known as Francesco Carlo in Italy, in honour of his father Franz Josef and his late grandfather Charles Albert of Sardinia. The young boy was educated in Vienna in the military academy from age six where he was taught to read, write, do arithmetic and learnt the basic skills needed to rule and wage war, but his mind and body were also toughened by the harsh regime. After this, he received higher education from private tutors and in the changing political climate of mid nineteenth century Vienna he was exposed to a wide variety of conservative, liberal and even some early socialist political ideas which would decisively mould his character, making him the good, reform-minded but also stern ruler that he would became known as. While his mother was often absent due to affairs in Italy, she did see to it that her son received the best education possible, learning much more than either of his parents. He was educated in mathematics, philology, philosophy, music (in which he wasn’t proficient and failed to get further than playing the flute) and political sciences which made him aware of the sensibilities of running a multiethnic empire and after his formal education was over he would take it upon himself to learn the main languages of the Empire so he could communicate with his subjects, and of course French, the language of diplomacy. He was already a fluent speaker of German and Italian because of his parents later also French due to his education. In his private time he studied Czech, Hungarian, Croatian and Polish. Besides being a fluent speaker of German, Italian and French, he also became fluent in Hungarian and Czech, but less so in Croatian and Polish which he would keep having trouble with despite his best efforts. The gesture, however, would be appreciated. Also, the birth of a son to Franz Josef and Maria Christina meant the foundation of the Habsburg-Lorraine-Savoy dynasty.\n\nFor now, the two halves were ruled separately which meant a lot of travelling back and forth between Vienna and Turin. This was rather complicated and time consuming, but Austrians and Italians alike didn’t feel much for being ruled by the other. Franz Josef’s successor to the throne would handle this differently. While Vienna and Turin (later Rome) remained the nominal capitals of Austria and Italy where all major official events and ceremonies took place, Franz Karl would settle in Florence in a newly built palace constructed during the 1850s. He and his entourage already moved there in the mid 1870s and he spent relatively little time in Vienna and Turin, instead building up an entourage of loyal followers in Florence. The parliaments remained in Turin (later Rome) and Vienna and he could very quickly communicate with either of them through telegraph. Florence was acceptable as a de facto capital to both Italian and Austrian ruling elites: the city lay in Italy, but the Tuscan Grand Duke, himself a Habsburg monarch from a cadet branch, still lived there. Through the region’s Italian landed magnates and through the Grand Duke of Tuscany, both the Austrian and Italian governments could exercise their influence over the Emperor and consult him fairly easily.\n\nFranz Karl, for now, remained a boy and much of this was still in the future during the 1850s which was an era in which the alliance blocks started to form. After Germany’s unification Emperor Friedrich Wilhelm IV died in 1857, he was succeeded by his brother Wilhelm I who was less positive toward the Habsburg Empire since he viewed Habsburg power as a threat. The new French Emperor Napoleon III was under the same opinion which was one of the reasons why a large garrison of French forces still guarded the Papal States. This was because Franz Josef’s opinion on the Pope wasn’t as high anymore because of the latter’s pro-French attitude. Emperor of the French Napoleon III and Emperor of Germany Wilhelm I met in the German border town of Offenburg where they held private talks for several days. Despite the differences between the more liberal French monarch and his more conservative German counterpart, Germany and France concluded a military alliance based on mutual assistance against aggression from a third party. France and Germany also agreed to form a customs union to block mainly Austria and Italy from their markets.\n\nFranz Josef and his wife Maria Christina witnessed how the Franco-German alliance attempted to surround them since they also made overtures toward the Ottoman Empire and included the Papal States into their alliance. Fortunately efforts toward the Ottoman Empire were hampered by the fact that France had its own designs on Ottoman territories. Austria and Italy attempted to find allies as well and sent envoys first to London, but the British for now decided to remain in “Splendid Isolation”, aloof from continental affairs, and therefore they politely declined an alliance. Because of this in the late 1850s Austria-Italy made a rapprochement to Russia which was not very difficult since it had recently been humiliated by France and Great Britain in the “Crimean War” in which Austria-Italy had maintained neutrality. Besides this, the formation of a Franco-German block in Western Europe was an economic threat since the two controlled major markets which Russia relied on. Franz Josef met with Tsar Alexander II, the successor to the late Tsar Nicholas I, in the Russian imperial capital of St. Petersburg where they discussed several important matters, most importantly a solution to the Balkan problem which was the biggest obstacle standing in the way of an alliance. The solution was a division into provisional preferential zones which would become spheres of influence after the Sublime Porte had been decisively vanquished. The decision was made that the Danube delta principalities would be in the Russian sphere of influence, but on the condition that Austrian commercial and military river traffic would have free passage without any imposed tolls or hindering checks by Russian officials. A state of “Greater Bulgaria” would befall Russia too as would a protectorate over the Bosporus, be it a Russian protectorate or one under the control of its Bulgarian puppets. Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and Albania would be divided between Austria and Italy. This concluded the major issues and an alliance was signed between Russia, Austria and Italy. They also formed a customs union with common marketsand common tariffs to external powers, and signed several commercial treaties.\n\nIn the meantime, economic and societal changes were taking place throughout the Empire as the industrial revolution caught on. It had first started in Britain due to improvements in food production and medicine which increased population growth and thus the labour pool. Besides this, there had been enormous advancements in technology which were now being implemented such as the steam engine and there was a good infrastructure and financial system. In Bohemia and Moravia there were significant deposits of coal which led to the emergence of industrial scale coal mining, heavy industry, armaments industry and steel industry of which the Skoda Works were a famous example with their steelworks, arms production, ships, machine tools and locomotives. Austria experienced an economic boom with a 1.76% GNP growth per capita in the latter part of the nineteenth century and both Vienna and Prague became centres of manufacturing and industrial development. This development wasn’t equally spread across the Empire with most of the Hungary and the other eastern lands of the empire remaining largely agricultural. A notable exception were Buda and Pest which grew to the metropolis of Budapest, a manufacturing centre in its own right. At the same time, the development of industry also brought an enormous expansion in the railroad network sponsored by the state. The railroad network also had military potential which officers realized and therefore it would grow to 22.000 kilometres between 1854 and 1880 and it highly sped up transport. A telegraph network also rapidly sped up communications while better healthcare, an embryonic welfare state, economic rights supported by labour unions, and better political rights embedded in a constitution improved living circumstances. This was the influence of Franz Josef’s liberalistic wife who was much loved by her husband. Liberal economic policies sped up economic development further. Austria actually saw a higher rise in GNP per capita than Germany, Britain and France. Still, socialism which advocated a proletarian revolution against the owning classes gained something of a following in Austria and Bohemia.\n\nItaly saw less in terms of industrialization, but Austria invested significantly. In Italy, minus the Papal States of course, the railroad network under royal control and with royal and Austrian sponsorship expanded from a mere few hundred kilometres across the peninsula to 7.000 kilometres in both halves of the Kingdom of Italy between 1848 and 1860. It, together with a better communications network through telegraphy, made for a much more effective central government in Italy which had previously been hampered by the Papal States in the middle which forced messages to be sent by ship. Southern Italy and Sicily remained behind in economic development, but in northern Italy ,influenced by industrial development in Austria, the Milan-Florence-Venice triangle emerged as a significant industrial area and a large number of migrants flowed in from southern Italy to the more wealthy and industrialized north in the 1860s and 70s. Textile industry emerged as the dominant sector of the economy and the region became a manufacturing centre. Shipbuilding, production of machinery and steel industry became secondary sectors in a number of northern cities. Ironically, the Papal States under the highly conservative Pope Pius IX remained the most underdeveloped part of Italy except for the region around Rome.\n\nIn the meantime, the American Civil War exploded over the issue of slavery with several southern states seceding from the Union. There was some threat of Anglo-French involvement for the Confederacy after a British mail packet had been seized and two Confederate diplomats had been taken prisoner, but the crisis winded down. Seeing the pro-Union stance of Russia, such a blunt intervention into the US’s internal affairs might have set off a conflict between the two European alliances, but this fortunately didn’t occur. The civil war did show the blueprint of future wars with new weapons used like rifles which were superior to their musket counterparts. In the civil war, both sides also employed ironclad warships for the first time an amazing novelty even if the primitive vessels used by both sides weren’t all that effective nor decisive in the war. Besides this, modern telegraph communications and railroads revolutionized command and waging war since it made for much more effective decision making and quicker troop transport from one theatre to the other.\n\nBoth alliances started to make their own war plans, incorporating these elements into their thinking. The alliance between Austria, Italy and Russia commonly known as the Triple Alliance or Eastern Powers formulated the following plan in the event of war with France and Germany: Russia would invade East Prussia with all her might and the Austrians would invade Silesia (a key industrial region with iron ore and coal, important for any German war effort) and march up to Posen where they would converge with Russian armies. From there they would march westward and take the German capital using their enormous numerical advantage over the Germans in a pincer movement after which they expected a German surrender. The pincer would consist of a Russian right wing, which was the dominant one due to Russian numbers, and a weaker Austrian left wing. There was a chance that the Austrian wing could be pushed back by the Germans, but this would only serve as Russia’s opportunity to outflank the Germans and crush the salient that would have formed from their advance against the Austrians. Austria would also launch secondary offensives into Bavaria and Saxony to spread the Germans out across their long eastern border. In the Italian theatre the plan was to seize the Papal States as quickly as possible and fight a defensive war against the French in the Alpine borderlands using fortresses and defensive lines which were under construction. After the anticipated defeat of Germany after a planned eight weeks of campaigning, Russian and Austrian reinforcements would be sent to Italy to repel the French. If necessary, follow-up offensives would be carried out into the Riviera and southern France although the Austrian and Russian general staffs expected that after Germany was defeated and the French army had received a bloody nose, France would accept a negotiated settlement. A plan was also made to significantly strengthen the Austrian and Italian navies with modern, steam-powered ironclad battleships to prevent a French naval blockade of the long Italian coastline and the Adriatic Sea. Russia could supply grain and saltpetre could be imported through Russia too, but the Russian colossus could only keep up supplying her allies for so long.\n\nThe Franco-German (or Entente) battle plan was quite different, but focused on a quick defeat as well, particularly to avoid the horrors seen in the recent American Civil War which had ended in 1865. The plan was that Germany would attack in the direction of Innsbruck (despite the suboptimal geographic conditions) while France would attack Italy which was seen as “the soft underbelly” of the Eastern Powers which would falter quickly. The only role of the Papal States was to hold out for as long as possible and form a distraction. France clearly underestimated the effects of Austrian sponsored industrialization and military reforms on Italian military prowess. After the projected collapse of Italian resistance, French forces would march into the Po Valley and up the Brenner Pass to converge with German forces. They would then march to Salzburg and capture the industrial regions of Vienna and Prague, thus ending the Austrian Empire’s ability to wage war. Russia was expected to seek a negotiated peace once its allies had been defeated. Russian strength would be the only threat, but the French figured the Germans had enough land to fall back while the plan was executed. The Russians would then be pushed back. Germany didn’t see it this way because they saw their borders as sacred and they weren’t prepared to give up land without a fight. This was the first serious miscommunication since France expected Germany to deploy the bulk of its forces against Austria and conduct a fighting retreat against Russia. Germany, however, anticipated using at a significant amount of troops against Russia.\n\nIn the meantime, the second industrial revolution started to take off. Grain prices dropped from the 1870s onward as America started to export a lot of it to Europe. The steep drop in bread prices meant that a large part of the budget of the average family was freed up, allowing for the purchase of consumer goods and so a more consumer based economy would emerge in the late nineteenth century. There were also a number of technological advances. Advances were made in metallurgy allowed for the production of high grade steel which was used to build the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Other major advances were the steam turbine which rapidly sped up sea travel, electricity which spread to most Western European major cities to light them by the end of the century, combustion engines which allowed for the first cars which would be the primary mode of transportation in the latter half of the next century, and primitive telephones. This went together with a strong economic growth.\n\nItaly was notably affected. While the first industrial revolution hadn’t affected Italy very much, the second one did and much more than the first one. Northern Italy became a manufacturing region of a wide variety of consumer goods and infrastructure was greatly enhanced although Southern Italy remained somewhat behind. In Russia there were some notable effects too after Tsar Alexander II had created a parliamentary body known as the Duma and had instated a constitution, a revolutionary event in Russia. Fortunately for the Tsar, Russia had little experience with democratic politics and so there was a smattering of parties which allowed the Tsar to play them off to a certain degree. Unlike in countries like Germany and France where there were a Christian-democrat, a socialist and a nationalist-conservative party, Russia’s versions of these ideologies were split into two or three and then there was a large number of single-issue parties. Still, a strongly liberal economic policy allowed for some measure of industrialization to take place in the Moscow-St. Petersburg, Donets Basin, Volga and Ural regions. Russia attempted to attract foreign investment from its allies and also from the rising economic power that was the United States and American entrepreneurs were interested in Russia’s untapped resources and ocean of unskilled labour. Alexander II announced the construction of a Trans-Siberian railroad in 1886 as well as a Trans-Caspian railroad. Construction would take the better part of two decades, but by the 1890s the railroad network already spanned 50.000 kilometres thanks to heavily increased state investment under the progressive Alexander II. This industrial growth somewhat worried Germany since Russia might eventually surpass the German economy (even if Russia’s economy now still significantly lagged behind on those of Britain, Germany, the United States, France and Austria in terms of GDP per capita and Russia was infrastructurally underdeveloped).\n\nAustria-Italy also participated to a certain degree in the game of imperialism and colonized some swaths of land in Africa. In 1880, Italian troops landed in Ottoman controlled Tunisia with the excuse that it was necessary “to protect the Italian migrant community from the oppressive regime” and declared a protectorate. In 1889, Italy with Austrian help and confidence in their military strength due to successful military reforms, invaded Abyssinia for a quick colonial war. While the Abyssinian army was relatively well-equipped compared to other African states, they were no match for Austrian and Italian forces who used the country as a testing ground for their armies, using machine guns, heavy artillery, modern communications and aerial reconnaissance in the shape of primitive airships. Abyssinia was defeated and Emperor Menelik II was forced to flee the country and go into exile in Britain. Abyssinia and Somalia were established as a large Italian colony on the Horn of Africa known as Italian East Africa. Italian colonial power boosted its prestige within the union of Austria-Italy.\n\nIn the meantime in 1870, Archduke and successor to the Austrian and Italian thrones Franz Karl married Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna to cement ties between Austria, Italy and Russia. They were 21 and 17 respectively at the time and they produced an heir, a son named Franz Josef after his grandfather, who was born in 1871. Storm clouds, however, loomed on the horizon as tensions brewing in Europe would soon receive a major release."
