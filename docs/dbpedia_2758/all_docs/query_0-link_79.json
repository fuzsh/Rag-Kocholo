        "text": "Clarence Leonard “Kelly” Johnson\n\nThe name Kelly Johnson is synonymous with advanced aircraft design from Lockheed Corporation where Johnson worked his entire career. His aircraft designs include many of America’s most iconic airplanes: the Orion and Constellation airliners; the C-130 Hercules transport; the F-80 Shooting Star and F-104 Starfighter jet fighters; the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter; the U-2 and SR-71 reconnaissance planes; and the JetStar business jet.\n\nLockheed P-38 Lightning\n\nThe Lightning, known as the Fork-tailed Devil by the Germans, saw service in every theater of WWII operations. On the occasion of the production of its 5,000th Lightning in May, 1944, Lockheed painted it bright red with the word “YIPPEE” on its underside. The aircraft was used by factory test pilots for flight demonstrations and company promotions. YIPPEE (USAAF Serial No. 44-23296) was eventually repainted and delivered to a combat unit in the South Pacific.\n\nGreen | Red | Blue | Brown | Gray"
