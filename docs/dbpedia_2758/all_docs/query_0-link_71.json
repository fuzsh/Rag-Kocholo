        "text": "Svensson\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nAug 9, 2021\n\n--\n\nMy manager recommended that I read the book Kelly: More Than My Share of It All — the autobiography of Kelly Johnson, an aerospace engineer at Lockheed Martin who was responsible for some of the most significant advancements in aircraft development during and after WW2. Today Kelly is mostly known for his involvement in developing the two famous U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, but maybe even more so the management technique and leadership style he invented that is still very much used today called “Skunk Works”.\n\nThe book is a great read for anyone interested in aerospace technology, how advancements in jet fighter development were driven by the second world war, and how significant these advancements were to its outcome. For an engineer like myself, there is also another aspect to the book that I find fascinating: Kelly’s ability to innovate and create highly advanced technologies in extremely short periods of time, under budget, using processes very similar to how lean manufacturing and agile development is done today.\n\nThis methodology is referred to as “Skunk Works” and has been written about as a management theory for decades. It has no exact definition but is often referred to as an effort consisting of a selected team that works in isolation on an advanced and secret project usually with a strict budget and timeline.\n\nMore specifically, Kelly had three simple management principles as the core of Skunk Works supporting his strong belief in “don’t build something you don’t believe in”.\n\nA lot can be said about these three principles and many parallels that can be drawn to agile: fast iterations, focus on execution, work closely with the customer/user, etc. But he later came to develop a set of 14 rules that he used for all his Skunk Works projects that go into more detail.\n\nWhile some are specifically tailed to aviation and/or military and government work, there are still lessons to be learned, and several of the principles are directly transferable to software development. Below are a selection of these rules and how I think they describe Agile principles well before Agile and other software methodologies were invented.\n\n“The Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects. He should report to a division president or higher.”\n\nThe Skunk Works manager is very much what a Product Owner in a scrum team is today. The product owner must be a single person, not a committee, and as a fundamental principle, the entire organization must respect their decision, much like the Skunk Works manager is in complete control of all aspects.\n\n“Strong but small project offices must be provided (both by the military and industry).”\n\nAgile does not discuss or bring up the need for physical workspace directly but talks about the importance of working face to face to achieve maximum effectiveness as one of its core 12 principles. Agile also relies on the importance of working as a closely-knit team and often reflects on its own performance and adjusting its behavior regularly.\n\nAs most companies are still working remotely (as of August 2021), this is an interesting topic from many perspectives, and it will be interesting to see the importance of working together in person. The coming years will tell us how remote teams are performing and if there will be clear performance gain or loss by going one or the other way.\n\n“A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.”\n\nThe importance of updating the blueprints for what the engineers are building is very much a core principle in Agile. In its manifesto, it says: “Respond to change over following a plan”. Agile welcomes late changes in requirements and because of the short iteration cycles, blueprints (roadmaps) are constantly changing and updating as user feedback is collected and processed.\n\n“There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.”\n\nAs stated in the Agile manifesto “Working software over comprehensive documentation”. This is a crystal-clear example of where Agile principles align with Skunk Works despite the differences in applications. Agile further emphasizes simplicity and minimizing the work not done as a core principle.\n\n“There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program.”\n\nAnother Agile core value, “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation” is very much exactly what Kelly refers to here, a project can’t be set in stone before it has been started. Deciding exactly what your final product will look like and how it will be built is basically going right back to a typical waterfall methodology, the one methodology Agile has moved us all away from.\n\n“The inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors. Don’t duplicate so much inspection.”\n\nWhile not mentioned directly in Agile, the importance of not duplicating work is a core principle in Lean, “Eliminate Waste” and a topic often discussed in both Scrum and Kanban. Going back to Agile and the emphasis on simple design and technical excellence lays the foundation for reuse and lack of duplicate testing."
