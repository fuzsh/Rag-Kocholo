        "text": "Kelley Johnson is an international award winning jazz vocalist who is known and respected as an arranger, poet and lyricist with a personal body of recordings. Kelley’s lithe velvety voice mixes with a dynamic delivery and tricky colorful arrangements to showcase her interpretive finesse and inspired soloists. An organic groovy singer with a direct approach, Kelley reaches her audience with storytelling, subtlety, soulfulness and swing.”Johnson has an uplifting brightness in her vocal delivery… Her lovely voice stands out for it’s emphatic clarity and for it’s direct approach. She pulls the blues out of thin air. It’s genuine. Johnson is a true communicator.”\n\n– Jim Santella, All About Jazz\n\n“Always technically accomplished, with a songbird’s lightness to her voice, Johnson took a big chance on her last release, Music is the Magic, improvising freely with both words and music. A singer of new spiritual depth emerged, adding Abbey Lincoln-like soul to her Ella Fitzgerald clarity.”\n\n— Paul de Barros, Seattle Times"
