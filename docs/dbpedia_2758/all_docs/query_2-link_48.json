With a professional background in real estate and a deep commitment to wildlife and landscape conservation, Kelly brings invaluable leadership to our board and insight to our land protection work. Kelly was raised in western Pennsylvania with a family keen on the outdoors, and she studied wildlife technology at Penn State University. Kelly lived for 12 years in New Zealand, where her two daughters were born. She then lived for 15 years in Park City, Utah, where she was active in the charitable community, principally on animal welfare and conservation. Kelly now resides in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., with her husband Keith and three rescued dogs."
