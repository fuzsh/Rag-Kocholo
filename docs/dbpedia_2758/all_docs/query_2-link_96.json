        "text": "Two years into retirement,after an 11-season MLB career,Kelly Johnson is excited to have his Atlanta Braves uniform on again.\n\nShuttling from his home in suburban Atlanta, Johnson finds himself in the Leatherstocking region of Upstate New York, on a weekend in late May. As part of the Hall of Fame Classic at Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, Johnson answered the call from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, and today is representing the Braves for the seven-inning exhibition game.\n\nJohnson,36, is one of the youngest former big leaguers taking grounders and hitting ropes into a player friendly outfield. As Johnson and 29 other MLBPAA members, each representing a different MLB club, hover around the batting cage, smiles are seen and stories exchanged. It's old home week for the guys, without the pressure of watching the standings. For Johnson, a Braves first-round draft pick in 2000 out of Westwood High School in Austin, Texas, he appears to be having the most fun of the group.\n\n11 big league seasons. Six seasons in Atlanta's minor league system. 1,399 MLB games. 155 home runs, 550 RBIs, and a .251 batting average. Johnson gave all he could to the game. There are regrets.\n\n“Zero withdrawal. None,” says Johnson,today slotted into Team Wizards line-up as the designated hitter. “I played as long as I could, and reached so many goals. Playing (in the MLB) was special, Just getting there to suit up was great. So many never got their chance.”\n\nFor this visit to baseball's ultimate museum,and being managed by hall of famer Ozzie Smith, with a coaching staff of two more Hall members – Goose Gossage and Eddie Murray, Johnson appears as excited as those calling his name in hopes of getting an autograph.\n\nJohnson, who played for eight different MLB clubs including both the New York Yankees and Mets, is a fan. He tells of following the career of his former teammate and soon to be inducted hall of famer Chipper Jones. Before joining the Braves in 2005 and beginning a big league career where he primarily played several field positions except for pitcher, catcher, and center field,Johnson was a Braves watcher.\n\n“I have so many,” said Johnson of his memories of Jones. ” Being a player, I was glued to him. I'd watch him take batting practice. He was awesome to all the young guys, and letting us know what the pitcher was going to throw.”\n\nWhen Johnson arrived with the Braves on May 29, 2005 for a game at Atlanta's Turner Field against the Philadelphia Phillies, he did so at the tail end of the organization's incredible run in winning divisional titles. The 2005 season was the 14th straight divisional title claimed by the Braves (1991-2005). Johnson's managers went from future hall of famer Bobby Cox to the Fredi Gonzalez/Brian Snitker era.\n\nAlong with Cox and Jones, pitcher John Smoltz, who would be inducted into the hall of fame, was another teammate of Johnson's during his parts of six seasons wearing a Braves uniform. Of the great Braves that anchored the organization as among the game's elite for more than a decade, there is another former teammate that Johnson hopes will be welcomed to Cooperstown.\n\n“Hopefully, Andruw (outfielder Andruw Jones) gets in. The organization (Braves) was winning, and without him, maybe we don't.”\n\nJohnson, who appeared in games for all five American League East teams, in 2006 underwent Tommy John surgery.\n\n“It (Tommy John surgery) changed my life and saved my career. I moved to second after that. Who knows what could have happened, if didn't turn out as it did,” tells Johnson, who today will be sharing Doubleday's third base dugout with Juan Pierre,Todd Zeile, and Jack Wilson as among his teammates.\n\nThe 2015 and 2016 seasons, for Johnson, were a bit odd.\n\nJohnson began each of the two seasons in Atlanta, and concluded them with the New York Mets. During his first welcome to Flushing, Johnson was part of a Mets pennant-winning club that went to the World Series challenging the Kansas City Royals.\n\n“That was amazing,” explains, Johnson,who during the 2010 season with the Arizona Diamondbacks hit for the cycle. “I'm a huge fan (baseball). I was a nut as a kid keeping score books, watching all-star games, reading the hall of fame plaques, dreaming of playing. I had to play. To be in (World Series) was amazing.”\n\nComing to New York, Johnson recalls, was a bit intimidating at first. Living in Atlanta, and not knowing his new teammates, as it turned out Johnson had a fun time, both tenures with the Mets.\n\n“We're brothers in this game. The next year (2016), it was the same deal. They (Braves) asked me about going to New York, and I said yes, thank you,” explains Johnson, a father of three, who played his last MLB game with the Mets on October 2,2016. Mets' fans will not have difficulty remembering Johnson's first game with the club.\n\nPlaying shortstop, Johnson collected a single, double, and a home run, in a 15-2 Mets win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nDuring Johnson's visit to the “Birthplace of Baseball”, all 5,000-plus fans at Doubleday Field had fun watching their heroes one more time run around the diamond and act like kids, including the guy representing the Atlanta Braves."
