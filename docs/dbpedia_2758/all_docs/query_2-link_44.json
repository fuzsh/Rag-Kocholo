Prior to her current secondary and postsecondary positions, she taught grades 1–6 and worked as a peer coach and a reading-intervention teacher. She is the recipient of the Constance McCullough Research Award by the California Reading Association for her study on assessment and diagnostic instruction. She also received the International Reading Association’s Celebrate Literacy Award, which honored her for her significant literacy contributions.\n\nDr. Johnson has published in The Reading Teacher, The California Reader, The Reading Professor, and Literacy, and has coauthored several books, including Accommodating Differences among English Language Learners: 75+ Literacy Lessons (2nd and 3rd Eds.), Designing Responsive Curriculum: Planning Lessons that Work, and Teaching Literacy in First Grade (Tools for Teaching Literacy).\n\nOften referred to by her colleagues as a teacher’s teacher, Dr. Johnson has appeared in many instructional videos on teacher modeling, assessment and instruction, effective grouping, and writing instruction.\n\nShe earned a bachelor’s degree in sociology from the University of California at San Diego, a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction—language arts from San Diego State University, and a PhD in literacy and language from San Diego State University/Claremont Graduate University."
