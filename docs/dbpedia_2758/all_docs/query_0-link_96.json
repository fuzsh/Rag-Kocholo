        "text": "Definition\n\nskunkworks project (Skunk Works)\n\nWhat is a skunkworks project (Skunk Works)?\n\nA skunkworks project, also known as Skunk Works, is an innovative undertaking, involving a small group of people, that is outside the normal research and development (R&D) channels within an organization.\n\nSkunk Works was the name given to a secret R&D team at Lockheed Aircraft Corp. tasked with quickly developing a jet fighter for the United States during World War II. The U.S. Army's Air Tactical Service Command approached Lockheed Aircraft in 1943 to discuss the military's need for jet fighters to counter Nazi Germany's airpower. Lockheed Aircraft assigned a team of engineers, led by Clarence L. \"Kelly\" Johnson to work on the project. Just a month later, the team delivered the XP-80 Shooting Star jet fighter proposal to military officials.\n\nMilitary officials quickly greenlit the project based on the proposal, sending a formal contract for the work four months later, according to Lockheed Martin Corp., as the global aerospace, defense and security company is now known. Johnson and his team delivered the first XP-80 in 143 days, seven days ahead of schedule, an astonishingly quick turnaround for a project of that scope.\n\nJohnson's pragmatic approach is credited with the speed and success of the project.\n\nOrigins of the Skunk Works term\n\nThe term Skunk Works arose during Johnson's leadership of the jet fighter project.\n\nBecause there was no space available at Lockheed Aircraft at the time, as its facilities were fully occupied with its existing commitments to the U.S. war effort, Johnson's team had to work in a rented circus tent next to a manufacturing plant that emitted strong odors. Team engineer Irv Culver jokingly compared the smelly digs to \"Skonk Works,\" depicted in the newspaper comic strip \"Li'l Abner\" as a remote locale where characters brewed a concoction of dead skunks and old shoes in a still.\n\nCulver's use of \"Skonk Works\" caught on with his colleagues on the team and eventually morphed into Skunk Works.\n\nIt is now a registered trademark of Lockheed Martin.\n\nTransition to business usage\n\nJohnson encapsulated the strategic management approach he used on the secret project in his 14 Rules (see sidebar below).\n\nFrom there, Johnson's management philosophy infiltrated other industries, and the Lockheed Martin term Skunk Works evolved to the more generic skunkworks, which today is applied to innovative projects that are done in secrecy, semisecrecy or, at least, outside the usual departments tasked with development within an organization.\n\nAs such, skunkworks projects focus on disruptive innovation versus incremental improvements to an organization's existing product line or processes.\n\nAnd staying true to their roots at Lockheed Aircraft, modern skunkworks projects are often undertaken without official contracts and with handpicked teams featuring top specialists within an organization.\n\nThey also often operate with limited resources and on shoestring budgets, similar in some ways to today's startup companies. Some famous recent examples of skunkworks projects include the semisecret X lab, founded in 2010 by the search giant Google and now owned by parent company Alphabet, and the lab Steve Jobs formed to develop the Macintosh computer. The latter was a group of about 50 people who worked behind The Good Earth Restaurant in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nThe 14 Rules of Skunk Works according to Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects. He should report to a division president or higher.\n\nStrong but small project offices must be provided both by the military and industry.\n\nThe number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10% to 25% compared to the so-called normal systems).\n\nA very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.\n\nThere must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.\n\nThere must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program.\n\nThe contractor must be delegated and must assume more than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for subcontract on the project. Commercial bid procedures are very often better than military ones.\n\nThe inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors. Don't duplicate so much inspection\n\nThe contractor must be delegated the authority to test his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the initial stages. If he doesn't, he rapidly loses his competency to design other vehicles.\n\nThe specifications applying to the hardware must be agreed to well in advance of contracting. The Skunk Works practice of having a specification section stating clearly which important military specification items will not knowingly be complied with and reasons therefore is highly recommended.\n\nFunding a program must be timely so that the contractor doesn't have to keep running to the bank to support government projects.\n\nThere must be mutual trust between the military project organization and the contractor with very close cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.\n\nAccess by outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures.\n\nBecause only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay not based on the number of personnel supervised.\n\nBenefits and drawbacks of skunkworks systems\n\nLockheed Martin's Skunk Works program, which also uses the more formal name Advanced Development Programs (ADP), isn't the only successful corporate innovation initiative of its kind.\n\nProponents of this approach to innovation say skunkworks projects enable teams to fully break from their usual routines, a separation of duties that enables them to deliver the kind of innovations that Johnson's team did during World War II.\n\nHowever, a new school of thought has emerged in the 21st century that believes companies shouldn't have innovation by exception but rather focus on continuous disruption and must build innovation into its core capacities, existing R&D efforts and its everyday work.\n\nContinue Reading About skunkworks project (Skunk Works)\n\nEarly-stage companies pursue the practical at CIO event\n\nExplore 7 future potential quantum computing uses\n\nThe future of generative AI: How will it impact the enterprise?\n\nMachine learning development for autonomous vehicles\n\nThe business case for customer success investment is built on 360° data\n\nRelated Terms\n\nWhat is an AWS landing zone?\n\nAn AWS landing zone is a scalable, secure Amazon Web Services environment that enables AWS users and organizations to launch and ...
