        "meta_description": "Brian Kelly Johnson October 14, 1954 – November 17, 2016     It is with sadness and heavy hearts that we announce the sudden passing of Brian.  Brian was predeceased by his beloved wife Wendy Anne Johnson.   He will be missed by his family; daughter Karla (Ryan) Jacobson; son Kelly (Karene) Johnson; his grandchildren Kienna, Kenzie, Kincade, Tristinn and Taylor. He also leaves to mourn his passing, his mother Sheila and a brother Glen.   The family extends its thanks to the emergency responders and staff at HSC.  Flowers are gratefully declined.

A Celebration of Brian’s life will be held at the Mosaic Reception Centre, 1839 Inkster Blvd. on Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:00 A.M.  For online condolences or to light a memorial candle please log on to www.mosaicfunerals.ca.‎   It means a lot to me, Kelly, and our families to have all your love and support at this time in our lives. Some of you are business acquaintances, some of you are family, some of you are kids he used to coach way back in the day, and some of you are long time friends we haven’t seen in a while. But seeing you all here today, means that my father had touched your lives in some way, shape, or form, and that you are here today to pay your respects to the remarkable man we all came to know and love. Thank you all for coming today to honour my father. Brian was born and raised in a very small town in Gainsborough, Sask. He was predeceased by his father Walter and was survived also by his mother Sheila and brother Glen who could not be here today. In the words for our Grandmother as she cried over the phone, she said “There was no kinder, softer, gentler man ever born. He was my baby, and I was so proud of him.” And she should be proud, for those of us who know Brian, we know she’s completely right.  Just like the man I came to marry, Dad loved his cars. From an old El Camino to the Boss 429 Mustang that brought him to Winnipeg “The big city!” on weekends to be young, free, and wild and to party. On one of his trips to Winnipeg, one night in a bar, as fate would have it he found my mother, Wendy. They both always said it was love at first sight. Although I do think she may have loved that car just a little bit more than dad (Jokingly). He moved to Winnipeg to start a new life with my mother. On March 22, 1976 Brian and Wendy were married. In the fall of 1977 they bought a house on 251 Lynbrook Drive in Charleswood from a man named Clarence Jacobson. As fate would have it, my husband and I found out years later that Clarence was actually my husband’s great uncle.  Brian started school at Red River College and was soon scouted for a job at Dominion Bridge where he could finish his training on the job. He worked there for almost 20 years. As another quirky twist of fate would have it my husband’s mother also worked there for short period of time, but they had unfortunately never met.  Ryan, you were here for the death of my mother and now the death of my father. I tell everyone this story because I take some comfort in feeling like fate was trying to bring us together so that you could guide and protect me through this time. My mother very much believed in guardian angels and I think after all we’ve been through the last 10 years and how you’ve picked me up after falling, twice now, that you might actually be mine. I thank god for you Ryan and I couldn’t survive this without you. I love you as my father loved my mother, and you have to know that dad loved you like a son. He practically begged you to ask me marry to marry you (laugh a little). Seen as I’ve mentioned fate know I’d like to take a moment and stray off course a bit here to also mention my sister in law Karene.  Karene, you have to know that mom predicted you. After a couple hard break ups (sorry kell... laugh a little) mom said to Kelly not to worry because he was going to get married to some beautiful Phillipino girl anyways. Why she said that I don’t know but it is in fact true. As soon as dad met you he knew you’d be the one. It was after you came into Kelly’s life that dad stopped worrying about Kelly anymore. He knew Kelly would be a successful business man, but when you came along he knew he’d never be alone and that he’d have all the love and support he’d ever need in life. Kelly had found in you what dad felt for mom all these years. Please know that dad loved and appreciated you. He cherished and respected you. And he believed in you. I truly believe that you too are a symbol of fate stepping in. You are my brother’s guardian angel, and you are the sister I’ve always wanted.  Ok where were we. Two years after they were married in September 1978 Kelly was born and in Sept of 1980, I followed. The party guy, turned business man, had now become a father. He was such an amazing father at that. I could not have ever dreamed or hoped for a better dad.  Dad was a family man. He was always planning a family trip to the states or camping, finding ways to have fun with the family. I remember when we got a flat on the way home one time and mom and Kelly and i had to wait on the side of the road while dad hitchhiked to go get a tire (we had no spare). It wasn’t until I was much older when dad confessed he didn’t have more than  to his name at the time. He’d spent it all for our trip trying to make it the best camping trip ever for his wife and kids. The man that had picked him up actually bought him the tire. He refused to give dad his address so that dad could pay it back when he had the money. The man simply wanted to help another man in need. Perhaps that moment it helped shape the character of my father. Do a good deed. Treat others with kindness. Help your fellow man. I only hope to become half the good natured person that my father was.  As a teenager my father and I didn’t really see eye to eye. I remember a male friend came to call on me one day (sorry honey) and this guy just walked in the house and said overconfidently “yeah is Karla home?”Dad grabbed him by his collar pushed him out the door and over the stair’s railings and calmly said NO. Well I was home and I was mortified. Knew he wouldn’t be calling again. (Laughs) I was so mad at dad but he said he was rude and calmly walked back to the couch to his snack and tv show. He told me once that as a baby I wouldn’t stop crying for hours and hours on end, nonstop. They tried everything but I just would NOT STOP. He got so upset when squeezing the air out of the milk bag underneath the bottle he squeezed so hard the nipple popped off and the milk went everywhere. Apparently I immediately started laughing. He told me when I was older he knew right then in that moment that I was going to be a pain in his ass my whole life and laughed. No matter what I did though, the horrible things I may ever had said to him, he knew I loved him and that I looked up on him Dad never gave up on me. Dad always left me to live my life as I felt necessary in the times. He would always love me enough to be there when I wanted or needed him. After I had moved out at a young rebellious age and made bad choices, my dad came to my rescue with no questions asked and welcomed me back home with open arms and zero judgments. Thank you dad- through your unconditional love and support you saved me from myself and made me the woman that I am today. You will always be my inspiration. As a father always trying to make things better for his family, Dad made personal sacrifices. After Kelly was born dad decided to sell mom’s mustang ....I mean dad’s mustang (laugh)... in exchange for more practical things. He took on designing and building an addition on the house to accommodate his growing family. He himself built the new addition which included a large living room with a porch off the patio door and a larger master bedroom.  His dedication to his family was unparrellel and his love for his life trickled into the community. When we were young, he was so involved in not just mine and Kelly’s lives, but the lives of the children and families in the community as well. He coached hockey and softball for years and was not only there to influence and support us, but also made an impact on the neighbourhood kids and parents, and everyone around us. From the kid who was inspired by his old hockey coach to the neighbour who wanted to hang out and talk when needing a friend. His good nature and kind spirit was inspiration to all of us. After a long hard day at work and running his kids around at night, he’d even go out late at night again to built a huge ice skating rink in the back lane and invited the whole neighbourhood to enjoy at their leisure. He was always so thoughtful of others. After Dominion Bridge closed, my father having gained experience and a reputation for doing good business, invested what he could in a partnership at Shopost Iron Works (1989) Ltd. He was an important part of the company and was involved in many large and sometimes difficult contracts. His company was part of the emergency repair of the flood gates in 1997, and the construction of the Moray and Provenche bridges. Even my brother had a part in welding some of the handrails as a young man working at his father’s company to eventually becoming a successfull engineer today. I will never cross another bridge, physically or metaphorically, without thinking of my father. Of course when owning a business there was stress, but my father was hoping and dreaming to provide retirement he and mom could truly enjoy as that stage in their lives was right around the corner. He had big dreams for their future after retirement. We were all getting a little older. Kelly had graduated and was just starting his EIT in Calgary and i was about to finish the last year of my bachelor degree when in the spring of 2006 all things changed in an instant. Our mother passed away suddenly. It was actually then on May 11, 2006, when my father truly died. He died of a broken heart. His dreams were shattered and he never recovered. Dad couldn’t visit the cabin anymore where he and mom spent their weekends.  He sold his shares in the company and retired. His heart was not into living life anymore and he shut himself away behind closed doors. The pain of losing mom was just too hard for him to bear. He would always say he was ok and things weren’t as bad as we thought but we knew they were and we just couldn’t pull him out of it. We’d invite him for Christmas and our children’s birthdays, and he’d say he looked forward to coming, but when the day came he just couldn’t bear being immersed around family without her there by his side. He wouldn’t answer the phone or the door. We’d forgive him everytime, but it hurt us. It’s been hard practically living without dad for the last 10 years and it was hard watching him fall. We’ve been missing him already for a long time. We’re hurt and maybe a little angry, but I hope you know dad that we understand and we forgive you. We love you so much.  I don’t want anyone here today to mourne the passing of my father. If you only knew the enourmous amounts of grief that he felt the last 10 years, then I ask that you understand how much he just wanted to with Wendy again. There’s nothing he wanted more. I’m happy that my father actually got to see his children grow and have families of their own. He was fortunate enough to be alive to see his kids get married and for the birth his grandchildren Tristinn,Taylor, Kienna,Kenzington, although he never met Kincade. The thing is he was seeing everything she was missing. Everything he felt in life after that awful day, watching his family was nothing more than a painful reminder that she was gone and didn’t live long enough to see their family’s milestones. I think that every time he saw us his heart would break over and over, again and again. Dad had become distant from everyone including me and Kelly. And I want you kids to know that although he wasn’t around, that your grandfather loved you immensely. I know in my heart that he wished he could be better for you, but he just couldn’t do it.  For everone else here today, please know that my dad loved you all in some way and wanted nothing more than the best for everyone, always! I ask you through my flooding of tears, please do not mourne my father on this day. Celebrate the man he was.  Celebrate his life. Know that he is now FINALLY EXACTLY where he wants to be. He is with her again. He is happy. May you rest in peace dad. Say hi to Mom",
