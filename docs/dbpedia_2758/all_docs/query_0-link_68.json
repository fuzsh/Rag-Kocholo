With complex projects, tight deadlines, and significant financial implications, the industry is in constant pursuit of methods to enhance efficiency, safety, and outcomes. One innovative approach gaining momentum is the application of Black Box Thinking to construction project management. What is Black Box Thinking? Originating from the aviation industry, Black Box Thinking is a philosophy centered on learning from failures and near-misses to prevent future mistakes. In aviation, black boxes record every detail of a flight, allowing for a thorough investigation in the event of an accident. This relentless pursuit of learning from errors has significantly enhanced aviation safety. Applying Black Box Thinking to Construction In construction, Black Box Thinking can be implemented by cultivating a culture that encourages reporting and analysing mistakes, near-misses, and successes. This involves several key steps: 1. Fostering a Culture of Transparency and Accountability: Creating an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their experiences, both positive and negative, is crucial. This means moving away from a blame culture and towards one that values learning and continuous improvement. 2. Implementing Robust Reporting Systems: Just like the black boxes in aircraft, construction projects need systems in place to capture data on every aspect of the project. This includes not only accidents and incidents but also near-misses and instances where something went unexpectedly well. Stay tuned for the next post, where we‚Äôll dive deeper into conducting thorough analyses and taking action based on the insights gained.\n\nProject Management- Lessons We Have Learned, Part Four We were brought into a project that was already through most of the pre-construction phase and the field work was about to begin. As we reviewed the scope with the team, we discovered that a very important trade had not been brought on board. This trade, not part of the elevator installer‚Äôs scope, was critical path and ideally would have mobilized very early in the installation process. Fortunately we had a number of contacts in the industry, and we helped engage an exceptional contractor who brought their work in on time and on budget, despite significant logistical challenges. The lesson is, make sure all elements of a project are accounted for, even if they are outside of your scope, because everything has to come together in a timely fashion for the project to succeed. A scope review with all the relevant stakeholders can help ensure all the necessary work has been captured, the contractors are engaged, and the schedule is coordinated and achieved.\n\nI don't think I've ever heard a company say \"our project manager is bad at their job\".... but we all know the ones that are terrible from the outside looking in. So at a super high level, a project manager is supposed to make a plan with a schedule for a project and follow the progress making adjustments to make sure things don't cause delays. Make them easy to talk to and I think this is the basic definition of \"good\". But if your PM we're any good, they'd see that train coming from a mile away and get everyone off the tracks. Meaning they'd look for the hazards and change the plan to avoid these issues in the first place. Yes, I said change the plan. Always adjusting things, like: - slow responses from clients/suppliers - indecisive players - underskilled team members - supply chain, like all of it - team member personal events - clients that don't share ALL details - labor force that doesn't want to work All of these things are very common and a good PM would be involved enough to know if they're going on or not and is pushing the schedule to account for them. EVEN IF the client says \"no, I want to go for more\", and there's no solution to the hurdles that slow down the work, the good PM will be able to say, \"it doesn't matter what you want, this is all you can do with the constraints you have\" Now of course, a PM can only achieve their goals if the team/client can rally behind the plans, which is a whole other issue. I have the absolute best PM there is, she does all of these things and more to keep projects rolling when things happen (she got a new contractor on site on a Friday afternoon with 3 hours notice to start on Saturday). She will remain nameless cause y'all aren't going to try to steal her. BUT you can experience her excellence when you decide to use us for your next engineering project. I will be very happy to show you what we can do and show you what an on time project looks like!\n\nCurrently all go here! Project Management scheme to start in the next week or so as well as 2 small S278 adoptions schemes. Please get in touch if you require anything that corresponds to the below description of works and I would be more than happy to discuss any needs or requirements. With over 20 years of experience in various senior management roles within the surfacing and groundworks sectors and adoption role positions for various housebuilders, SG17 offers a service to companies in specific areas where there is sometimes a shortfall within the construction industry and a need in certain sectors for these to be covered to ensure cost control, quality and streamlining. Specialists in all adoption works pertaining to Local Authorities, inclusive of S38, S278, S104 and many other types of Roads, Sewers and Site processes. These areas are of great importance to any house builder or relevant companies, which is where SG17 can help. A project monitoring service for all surfacing and groundworks is also offered in where works can be monitored to ensure: ‚Ä¢ Unnecessary costs are being minimised or eliminate. ‚Ä¢ All technical specifications are being met. ‚Ä¢ Necessary site processes are being adhered to The above items all avoid issues later in the building process where at the moment a lot of companies are spending excessive amounts and incurring un-foreseen problems that could have been avoided. Services provided are as below: ‚Ä¢ Involvement in all stages of the S38 process from beginning up to final adoption, also includes monitoring and management of aged/legacy sites with ongoing issues. ‚Ä¢ Engaging in the S278 processes for sites with local authorities and a full service in the process inclusive of organising works with sub-contractors as and where needed. ‚Ä¢ Monitoring of early site construction phases including laying of stage 1 tarmac elements (to minimise later issues primarily regulating costs and spec issues on all works to roads, driveways and footways). ‚Ä¢ Overseeing any early site groundworks to any S38/S278 relevant works to again ensure technical specifications are met and all works are compliant with agreed designs. ‚Ä¢ Final surfacing works supervision and co-ordination between client and local\n\nA Comparative Exploration of Time Impact Analysis and Window Analysis In the dynamic realm of construction project management, the choice of delay analysis methodologies plays a pivotal role in deciphering the complexities of project timelines. This essay undertakes a comparative examination of two widely employed techniques: Time Impact Analysis (TIA) and Window Analysis. Time Impact Analysis (TIA): TIA is a retrospective delay analysis method that evaluates the impact of delays on the project schedule by simulating the effects of individual delays on the critical path. It provides a detailed examination of each delay event's influence on subsequent activities, allowing stakeholders to understand the ripple effects throughout the project life cycle. TIA is particularly effective in situations where delays occur after the project has commenced. Window Analysis: On the other hand, Window Analysis is a prospective delay analysis method that assesses the potential impact of future delays on the project schedule. It involves creating time windows to evaluate the effects of possible delays, offering a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating risks before they manifest. Window Analysis is instrumental in scenario planning, allowing project teams to make informed decisions to prevent or minimize the impact of potential disruptions. Comparative Insights: 1. Timing of Application: - TIA is predominantly retrospective, focusing on analyzing delays after they have occurred. - Window Analysis is prospective, enabling stakeholders to anticipate and address potential delays before they materialize. 2. Precision and Detail: - TIA provides a granular understanding of the impact of specific delays on the critical path, offering detailed insights into the sequence of events. - Window Analysis, while forward-looking, may offer a broader view of potential delays within specified time frames, providing a more generalized perspective. 3. Use Cases: - TIA is well-suited for projects where delays have already transpired, offering a comprehensive retrospective analysis. - Window Analysis is beneficial in projects with inherent uncertainties, allowing teams to model and prepare for potential delays, fostering a proactive risk management approach. Ultimately, the choice between Time Impact Analysis and Window Analysis depends on the project's characteristics, stage, and the objectives of the delay analysis. Both methodologies bring unique strengths to the table, empowering construction professionals to navigate the intricate landscape of project timelines with strategic precision.\n\nPROJECT FAILURE FROM A PRACTICING PERSPECTIVE In my 22years in the field of engineering practice, i have learned that factors that contribute to project successes or failures fall within the context of project life cycle and external factors to the project life cycle. The Project Manager should be a good communicator, listeners, coordinator, good manager, an \"INVESTIGATOR\", know personnel around you and your subordinates well and above all must be disciplined and with high level of INTERGRITY to be able to manage a successful project. But is that possible in developed or developing countries?? May be. I don't know. But for sure, INTERGRITY Earns you RESPECT and EMPHATHY with good results from those you lead/manage/guide/mentor/coach....... Attached is an overview of a generic but streamlined failure factors that we need to be aware of. Some sensitive factor known to all practicing managers cannot be exhausted on this page. It is by inbox only üòé The hidden treasure of Project Management üçÆ 1. PMs should be aware of what all trades on a particular project is about 2. Know all your project leaders under you including site agents, site engineer, head of foremen, foremen, technicians and various gang leaders in the project. These are the infantry we know in military. Treat them well and all you need is reporting success to the project sponsors. Treat them like nobodies and prepare for untimely exit with worse performance thus project failure. 3. Be aware of all the kitchen on site and outside project areas (project parable). These are where all project ingredients are sourced/manufactured/tested/quality assured ready for use. 4. PM should be like Chefs and not Hotel Managers. This is the trickiest part of our industry, and little is known out there. Hotels with bad Chefs loose business sooner than later. The same is with Project Managers. The title is glittering/appetizing/political/business, but actual meaning is knowing the business well technically than any aspect all time and at all levels. 5. Project Managers should know that they are employed for a particular project/product delivery within stated time, quality and cost. Hence, they need to know the technical jargons more than any to be able to lead the team to deliver that project. 6. PM should draw a thick line between those he leads and those related to his or her bosses and should apply different technics in managing such circumstance. Otherwise, they can register project failures sooner than later. 7. Everything PMN does should be mindful of the triple project constraints (Cost, Time and Quality)."
