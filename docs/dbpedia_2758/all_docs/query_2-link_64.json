        "text": "I strive to develop therapeutic rapport with clients, promote insight, and work towards tangible change.\n\nApproach to Supervision\n\nI view supervision as a collaborative process and strive to balance task supervision (i.e, documentation, practice management, etc) with clinical supervision (integration of theory, skill building, self of therapist, etc). Partnering with a new-in-the-field clinician and working with them as they develop clinical discernment, confidence, and critical thinking skills really is a privilege. I hold a high standard from day one, but will always teach, mentor, coach and consult to help a provider be successful.\n\nTelehealth Services\n\nTo expand and improve our care options for clients, ACP offers Telehealth (phone or video) appointments. Telehealth uses phone or video conferencing to connect you with highly qualified and experienced providers in real-time from the comfort and convenience of your own home or office. Before your telehealth appointment, you will receive details for how you will connect with your provider. If you will be connecting via phone, the provider will plan to call you at your scheduled appointment time. Please be ready to take the call and also check that your phone allows calls from blocked numbers (accessible within your phone settings). If you will be connecting via video conference, your provider will email you an invite to join the appointment. Please call our office to learn more about ACPâ€™s telehealth services and to schedule an appointment."
