While we had some great aircraft in WW2, NONE of them claimed more kills, and NONE of them fought the whole war. The really great performers didn't show up 'till the latter half, and the P-38 had been out there since Day 1.\n\nHe developed many others... the first operational US jet fighter P-80 Shooting Star... the F104 \"Starfighter\", the U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" high-altitude, high-endurance reconnaisance plane, the A-12 (SR-71) \"Blackbird\" was also a reconnaisance plane, but unlike the U-2, was very comfortable performing it's work from an even higher altitude, and at excess of Mach 3.\n\nHe also developed the AQM-60 Kingfisher- an unmanned vehicle... basically, a missle, it was identified casually as a 'target drone', but with it's ability to break Mach 4, wasn't within sight of anybody, or anything, long enough to actually become a 'target'... it was there, and gone, before anything would ever find it... but if it was equipped with appropriate guidance, it was certainly capable of running down, and punching a hole through any hypersonic missle. Wouldn't that be a handy gadget to have nowdays??\n\nHis boss noted \"That damned swede can SEE AIR...\"\n\nHe was known for his straightforward approach to engineering AND leadership, minimalisim of formality, and focus on simple, rapid solutions to problems.\n\nJoe, you probably saw plenty of UFOs down there in your youth...

He told of the problems they had with the P38 and the Army thinking they knew how to correct the problems. The first was compressibility in a high speed dive.The Army added counter weights to the tail thinking extra weight would help the pilot control the aircraft. Kelly knew that was not the answer and wanted to put a P38 airframe in the Government run wind tunnel for testing. Turns out Kelly was right as the testing showed turbulence over the tail when the P38 approached the speed of sound in a dive freezing the controls and causing the aircraft to crash. Kelly designed a dive flap on the underside of the wing that could be deployed by the pilot entering a dive keeping him in control of the aircraft. The other problem was getting maximum performance from the Allison engines. The Army requested the wrong size turbocharger! After Kelly and the Lockheed test pilots did some tests they found the proper size turbos and along with 150 octane gas the P38 achieved phenomenal performance for a piston engined aircraft. Jets and the overall cost of a twin engined plane retired the P38.\n\nEdited by klinemar - 28 Feb 2020 at 11:10am\n\nHD6GTOM\n\nOrange Level\n\nJoined: 30 Nov 2009\n\nLocation: MADISON CO IA\n\nPoints: 6627 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 28 Feb 2020 at 11:20am\n\nRight after WW2 and the Korean War, we had a branch of the Airforce establish an air Base at the Desk Moines Airport.

You may see it referred to as the P-38, and as the P-38 \"Lightning\"... I don't believe it was a formality, but I suspect the non-supercharged version was referred to colloquially as the \"P-38\" while \"Lightning\" was probably reserved for the full-power version.\n\nAs one would expect, the lack of turbosuperchargers had a dramatic impact on the Allison's performance, not just at high altitude, but also at low altitude. Why? Because the engine was built with comparatively LOWER compression ratio, to allow the turbosupercharger to operate at low altitude and high altitude, with no great 'hiccup' in power.\n\nA TurboSupercharger is a combination device- it's a mechanically-driven compressor that at low speed, is spun by an overrunning clutch off the engine, and once there's sufficient exhaust pressure, it is increased in speed by an exhaust pressure turbine.\n\nIn locomotives, especially our big 2-stroke V's, the turbosuperchargers (usually two) are driven by a ball-type overrunning clutch, one on each end of the camshafts. In a 2-stroke, a supercharger is mandatory, otherwise, there would be no way for fresh air to enter the combustion chamber. In a locomotive, the supercharger has to effectively clear the cylinders after each stroke while CRANKING, which means it has to be basically a positive-displacement design. There's no exhaust pressure at starting, and very little while at idle, but once the throttle is moved up, exhaust flow through the turbine spins the blower faster, to create boost.\n\nIn the Allison aircraft, same concept applies, but it's a 4-stroke, so boost isn't necessary to run, but it's starting at (comparatively) low compression. Once it's at idle speed, the blower provides enough boost to make it snappy, and at working loads, exhaust pressure brings up boost substantially.\n\nBritain didn't want turbosuperchargers because they didn't want to be limited to lower fuel grades. Because of their island circumstance, they were extremely limited in resources, particularly when German U-boats were amidst their 'happy hunting' timeframe of unrestricted warfare.\n\nAnyway, the 'castrated' P38's performance was dismal at best.\n\nA similar platform was the DeHavilland Mosquito, although larger and not quite as maneuverable, and being made of plywood, was very cheap (1/1th the cost of a P-38) fast was put into service into much of the same tactically-flexible purposes that the P-38 served, INCLUDING (like the P38) the installation of a very, very, very powerful cannon out the nose, for punching holes through surfaced submarines. The Mosquito's greatest weakness in comparison to the P38 was protective armor... they were structurally limited by spar and fuselage loading, so having substantial armor over sensitive areas and crew was not possible. It wasn't until later in the war that P-38's were brought into the European theatre by US Army Air Force. With our logistical capacity unthrottled by submarine threats, bringing in the twin-engine beast made the turbosupercharger fuel concern a non-issue.\n\nThe biggest advantage of the turbosupercharger, was the side-effect of design- the presence of the exhaust system plumbing and turbine made the P-38 extremely quiet.\n\nThe P-38 Lighting ruled the South Pacific. While the Vouight Corsair and a myriad of other aircraft were exemplary, the P-38 was an all-purpose denizen of the Japanese Empire.\n\nTen Amendments, Ten Commandments, and one Golden Rule solve most every problem. Citrus hand-cleaner with Pumice does the rest.\n\nklinemar\n\nOrange Level\n\nJoined: 14 Sep 2009\n\nLocation: Michigan\n\nPoints: 7945 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 01 Mar 2020 at 8:15pm\n\nDave I read where the Army Air Corps had a ban on the export of Turbochargers.

The P49 and first P51's were Allison powered with Mechanical single stage supercharger and they lacked high altitude performance. Both planes design made Turbo supercharging very difficult for placing the duct work. Both the P47 and F4U Corsair were Turbo supercharged. Without a two stage mechanical supercharger it was possible to over pressure the engine and detonate it if a pilot was not watching his manifold pressure. The P38 had this problem with the wrong turbo and a lack of automatic control of the doors for air to the turbos. This was corrected with the J and L models. With the advent of 150 octane fuel the P38,P47,P51 and F4U were able to achieve air speeds at altitude approaching 450mph."
