        "text": "In selling a piece of property, Kelly worked hard to insure that we received an offer we were happy with. She was very hands on & provided timelines to keep us informed as to what we could expect throughout the process. I appreciated her professionalism, but sheâ€™s also very personable & likable. She insured a smooth transaction & made it enjoyable, which isnâ€™t always an easy task. I would recommend her expertise when buying or selling, time & time again!!!\n\nAs first-time homebuyers, we couldn't have asked for a better guide through the treacherous wilds of signing our lives away for some dirt and wood to call our own! Kelly and her assistant, Kelsey, are joyful masters of their craft. From sending us and updating a personalized stream of listings that somehow checked all of our boxes to quickly answering in detail our most mundane questions, Kelly's attentive care made us feel like we were her only clients. We're pretty sure everyone gets the VIP treatment, though! ðŸ˜‰ Kelly (and Kelsey) turned this huge life step into a game of hopscotch, and every interaction left us smiling. Our situation had some challenging quirks, but Kelly navigated the pitfalls with aplomb. Kelly far exceeded expectations, and we will always be grateful that she joined us on our journey!\n\nKelly did a great job finding us our forever home. Her knowledge of the area and recommendations of local contractors including the home inspector was a great help. She made the process very painless and smooth, we placed a bid in the afternoon and by morning we were new home owners. Thank You Kelly\n\nIn my past life, I was a real estate agent. Kelley was always ahead of the curve, anticipating every upcoming event within the sales channel. She handled everything like home inspections, pick up repairs resulting from that home inspection, and working with a local lender she recommended that resulted in a home loan that will ultimately save my wife and I tens of thousands of dollar in interest in the coming years, not to mention the savings in loan cost. Kelly always made sure we were kept abreast of all aspects of the sale's progress. We even asked for an early close and she made that happen! Then she went so far as to give us an unexpected home welcoming gift which was a nice finale touch to an extremely great experience. She is quite simply the best agent I have had the privilege of working with... Cary C.\n\nKelly and her assistant Kelsey were wonderful to work with! They were a great team to work with because they had more availability for quick showings. Kelly balanced sharing her ideas and insights without trying to sway us towards a particular decision. She has great knowledge of Port Angeles neighborhoods. She gracefully helped us navigate house-buying during the Covid pandemic too. It's clear she has a great reputation and network of professionals in the area- this helped us have a smooth buying process. Would recommend!\n\nKelly Johnson put my husband and me at ease from our very first meeting with her, which was to do a market analysis of my father's property after his death. From that time until we were ready to put the house on the market Kelly was always there to answer questions and to recommend cleaners, etc. She would keep in touch without pressure. Throughout the selling process, she kept things simple so I didn't get stressed out more than necessary. We appreciated her expertise and trusted her advice in working with our buyers, and we got a selling price that made everyone happy. Thanks, Kelly!\n\nKelly's experience and motivation made for a quick and easy sell of my home. Before the listing she had detailed and precise suggestions for the preparation of the home and property. Her foresight and market understanding proved to be exactly what I needed and what was needed to prep the sale. Her and her staff did a remarkable job in the marketing and listing of the home. The listing pictures and drone footage truly captured the essence and livability of the home. She was quick to reply with any questions I had. Best experience with a Realtor ever!\n\nKelly and her team greatly assisted us with the sale of our parents home in Port Angeles. We live in the Seattle area and Kelly and Kelsey exhibited great communications and networking abilities to assist us with preparing and selling of our folks home and acreage. Thank you for all of your assistance and high level of professionalism!\n\nKelly helped us sell our house in Port Angeles this last spring. It sold within three days of listing. She was our home selling \"doula\", taking us through the unfamiliar waters of first time home selling. She answered all our questions, and gave us helpful advice, and was cool when we hit our anxious times. Thank you Kelly, we will always appreciate how big of a help you were (and are).\n\nWe went with Kelly to sell our house and I'm so happy we did! She sold our house quickly, for the price we wanted, and she made the entire process so easy! She was on top of everything and constantly kept the process moving forward. She and her assistant patiently answered every question we had and it's mind boggling how quickly they get things done. We now recommend her to everyone and look forward to buying a house later this yea\n\nIt was truly a pleasure working with Kelly and her team at Windermere. Right from the start I felt I was in very competent hands. Her marketing plan was well thought through and executed. Selling a home can be a daunting task and Kelly was very responsive to any questions or concerns as they arose. I highly recommend her.\n\nI have worked with Kelly buying a house as well as selling a house and both experiences were great. Kelly and her staff help you through all the steps to get to \"close\" and inform you of the process and reasons along the way. I felt very confident that I was getting the best representation possible.\n\nKelly was quick at responding to our needs and wants. She was there when needed and did a great job of laying the playing field, being honest with some of our requirements and let us know when to push and when to let go. We bought our house in literally 20 minutes after seeing it and closed within a few weeks, I think. Kelly helped us get it all done without any glitches. Thank you and her Assistant Kelsey was great as well.\n\nKelly was amazing to work with! She made the process of buying our new home go smooth and easy! She kept us in the loop with all the steps to make sure everything was in place and completed on time. We closed a couple weeks early and we couldn't be happier! Anyone would be very lucky to get to work with Kelly!\n\nWe really enjoyed Kelly. She is a fun person to be around as well as very knowledgeable about her job. I got a lot of useful inside information about the area from Kelly like good restaurants etc. Kelly took us all around before we settled on the house we bought. All-in-all it was a great sale. I highly recommend Kelly!\n\nKelly Johnson helped us sell our home, and buy a new one- all within less than 60 days. Kelly very quickly arranged to have our home placed on the market, with professional photos and video for the listing. We received multiple offers and Kelly was a pro at handling all of the back and forth with great attention to detail. Kelly also assisted us with purchasing a new home, and made sure everything went smoothly. We would definitely recommend Kelly Johnson, she is a true professional, has great attention to detail and was very quick to respond whenever we contacted her throughout the selling and buying process."
