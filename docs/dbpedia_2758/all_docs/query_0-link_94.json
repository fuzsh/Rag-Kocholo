        "text": "A few weeks ago, I happened to watch two programs on television that sparked the topic of this post. One was on Planes That Changed the World and it focused on Clarence Leonard “Kelly” Johnson who, according to several web-based articles, was an American aeronautical engineer and designer who helped create many iconic aircraft such as the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird. Johnson was able to not only imagine the possibilities of aircraft but turn those possibilities into reality.\n\nThe second program was the movie Hidden Figures which is a 2016 American biographical drama film that focused on three brilliant African-American women working at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the early 1960s: Katherine G. Johnson, a mathematician who calculated flight trajectories for Project Mercury and other missions; Dorothy Vaughan, a NASA supervisor and mathematician; and, Mary Jackson, a NASA engineer. These three women all had incredible vision and like Kelly Johnson, turned possibilities into reality.\n\nBoth of these programs highlighted the importance and power of possibilities, of options to pursue, or of the potential of something. Possibilities lift us past our limits and create excitement of discovering something new or making something great happen. On our life journey, there are times (notably when we encounter unexpected or unwanted change) when having a heart and mind of possible, when seeing the possibilities in a situation, may help move us beyond a challenging moment and keep us moving forward on our life journey.\n\nI noticed as I watched the lead characters in each program that they each had a heart and a mind of possible. They all possessed several qualities that made them look at something and see the potential in it. Some of those qualities which opened them to the possible were:\n\nEliminating limiting beliefs.\n\nBeing more flexible in their views.\n\nMaintaining an open mind.\n\nAvoiding either/or thinking.\n\nBelieving in themselves and their capabilities.\n\nOvercoming limitations.\n\nDeveloping their strengths.\n\nMoving beyond what if…\n\nEngaging in new things and ideas.\n\nEmbracing change.\n\nTaking risks.\n\nAccepting what came their way.\n\nMaking smart choices.\n\nPowering up their positivity.\n\nChoosing to be great.\n\nWelcoming new beginnings with open arms.\n\nUnleashing their imaginations.\n\nThinking creatively and divergently.\n\nLooking for opportunities.\n\nSeeking ways around obstacles.\n\nLearning from their mistakes.\n\nBeing persistent.\n\nOn our life journey, we will be able to face anything that comes our way if we have a heart and mind of possible because when we do, we will be able to see opportunity. And, when we see opportunity, we become open to circumstances that then make it possible to do something. When we see opportunity, we will be able to focus our energy on building the new rather than on fighting the old (paraphrased from a Socrates quote). Taking advantage of opportunities that present themselves is a way to help us grow and move forward.\n\n“Life doesn’t provide warranties and guarantees. It only provides possibilities and opportunities for those who dare to make the best use of it.” (Anonymous) So true. So true. We need to make sure that we are ready to take advantage of the possibilities and opportunities that are present along the path of our life journey. One way to ensure we are ready is to have a heart and a mind of possible. Remember, possibilities are powerful. Possibilities can lift us past our limits. Possibilities create excitement. Possibilities have a way of making something great happen.\n\nThis article lists 22 qualities that help develop a heart and mind of possible. How many of them do you already possess? If even one, you are positioned to see possibilities and take advantage of opportunities. Avoid selling yourself short. Take stock and let your heart and mind of possible propel you past challenging times and moments into a new beginning filled with possibility!"
