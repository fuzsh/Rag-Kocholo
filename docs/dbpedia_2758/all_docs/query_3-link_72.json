In First Man, author James R. Hansen explores the life of Neil Armstrong. Based on over 50 hours of interviews with the intensely private Armstrong, who also gave Hansen exclusive access to private documents and family sources, this \"magnificent panorama of the second half of the American twentieth century\" (Publishers Weekly, starred review) is an unparalleled biography of an American icon.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nNot really 'unabridged'\n\nBy A Reader on 06-06-18\n\nThe Crash Detectives\n\nInvestigating the World's Most Mysterious Air Disasters\n\nBy: Christine Negroni\n\nNarrated by: Christine Negroni\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 21 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 280\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 253\n\nStory\n\n4 out of 5 stars 251\n\nIn The Crash Detectives, veteran aviation journalist and air safety investigator Christine Negroni takes us inside crash investigations from the early days of the jet age to the present, including the search for answers about what happened to the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. As Negroni dissects what happened and why, she explores their common themes and, most important, what has been learned from them to make planes safer.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nMISSLEADING TITLE.\n\nBy Daniel Schneider on 11-02-16\n\nSR-71, the Blackbird, Q&A\n\nBy: Terry Pappas\n\nNarrated by: Chris Abell\n\nLength: 4 hrs and 24 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 145\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 130\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 129\n\nHigher, farther, faster - what every real aviator aspires to. The SR-71 was the epitome of this dream for three decades. The only way to beat the SR-71 was to rocket into space, and every astronaut in the office with me in the 1960s would have loved to have flown the Blackbird. In many ways it placed greater demand on piloting proficiency than any spacecraft.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat in sight on life and times of Blackbird crew\n\nBy J Bo on 11-11-15\n\nPathfinder Pioneer\n\nThe Memoir of a Lead Bomber Pilot in World War II\n\nBy: Raymond E.

Pathfinder Pioneer gives us vivid insights into the genesis of the American air campaign, told with the humor, attention to detail, and humility that captures the heart and soul of our Greatest Generation.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nA Good Recounting of WW2 Bomber Missions\n\nBy Sean on 07-25-17\n\nChasing the Demon\n\nA Secret History of the Quest for the Sound Barrier, and the Band of American Aces Who Conquered It\n\nBy: Dan Hampton\n\nNarrated by: John Pruden\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 39 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 197\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 176\n\nStory\n\n4 out of 5 stars 175\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the United States accelerated the development of technologies that would give it an advantage over the Soviet Union.

Johnson was the innovative genius behind Lockheed's \"Skunk Works\", and played a leading role in the development of more than forty aircraft, including some of America's most sophisticated planes such as the Constellation, Shooting Star, F-104, U-2, and the SR-71 Blackbird.\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n\nHardly an audio book.

Desperate to beat the Russians into space, NASA put together a crew of the nation's most daring test pilots: the seven men who were to lead America to the moon. The first into space was Alan Shepard; the last was Deke Slayton, whose irregular heartbeat kept him grounded until 1975. They spent the 1960s at the forefront of NASA's effort to conquer space, and Moon Shot is their inside account of what many call the 20th century's greatest feat - landing humans on another world.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nA Definitive Summary of Our Manned Space Missions\n\nBy Robert on 08-15-19\n\nSR-71, the Blackbird, Q&A\n\nBy: Terry Pappas\n\nNarrated by: Chris Abell\n\nLength: 4 hrs and 24 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 145\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 130\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 129\n\nHigher, farther, faster - what every real aviator aspires to. The SR-71 was the epitome of this dream for three decades. The only way to beat the SR-71 was to rocket into space, and every astronaut in the office with me in the 1960s would have loved to have flown the Blackbird. In many ways it placed greater demand on piloting proficiency than any spacecraft.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat in sight on life and times of Blackbird crew\n\nBy J Bo on 11-11-15\n\nThe Astronaut Maker\n\nHow One Mysterious Engineer Ran Human Spaceflight for a Generation\n\nBy: Michael Cassutt\n\nNarrated by: Eric Martin\n\nLength: 15 hrs and 40 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 41\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 38\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 38\n\nOne of the most elusive and controversial figures in NASA's history, George W. S. Abbey was called \"the Dark Lord\", \"the Godfather\", and \"UNO\" (unidentified NASA official) by those within NASA. Yet Abbey had more influence on human spaceflight than almost anyone in history. From young pilot and wannabe astronaut to engineer, bureaucrat, and finally director of the Johnson Space Center, Abbey's story has never been fully told - until now. The Astronaut Maker takes listeners inside NASA to learn the real story of how Abbey rose to power and wielded it out of the spotlight.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nExcellent Book for Space Enthusiasts\n\nBy Amazon Customer on 06-30-24\n\nTo Engineer Is Human\n\nThe Role of Failure in Successful Design\n\nBy: Henry Petroski\n\nNarrated by: Matthew Boston\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 34 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 126\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 105\n\nStory\n\n4 out of 5 stars 103\n\nHow did a simple design error cause one of the great disasters of the 1980s - the collapse of the walkways at the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel?

These are some of the failures and successes that Henry Petroski, author of the acclaimed The Pencil, examines in this engaging, wonderfully literate book.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat For Understanding How Things Fail\n\nBy Anonymous User on 07-07-21\n\nNever Mind, We'll Do It Ourselves\n\nThe Inside Story of How a Team of Renegades Broke Rules, Shattered Barriers, and Launched a Drone Warfare Revolution\n\nBy: Alec Bierbauer, Col.

Having narrowly avoided the attack on Pearl Harbor the Seawolf set out for the seas of the Pacific to wreak havoc on Japanese shipping. Joseph Melvin Eckberg was on the Seawolf from her maiden voyage and remained with her until January 1943. As chief radioman he was instrumental in assisting Captain Frederick Warder to find and destroy enemy targets. From the claustrophobia of being trapped under water and the overwhelming fear of depth charges to the joys of aiding the war-effort and the camaraderie on the ship.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nUnfortunately not very good\n\nBy Jason on 03-29-18\n\nVictory at Sea\n\nNaval Power and the Transformation of the Global Order in World War II\n\nBy: Paul Kennedy, Ian Marshall - illustrator\n\nNarrated by: James Cameron Stewart\n\nLength: 20 hrs and 9 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 31\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 27\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 26\n\nIn this engaging narrative, historian Paul Kennedy grapples with the rise and fall of the Great Powers during World War II.
