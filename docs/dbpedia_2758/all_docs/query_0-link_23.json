        "text": "Clarence Leonard \"Kelly\" Johnson (February 27, 1910 â€“ December 21, 1990) was an American Engineer at Lockheed Martin. He helped make planes, for example the SR-71 Blackbird and the P-38. He worked at the skunkworks at Lockheed Martin. There, with Ben Rich, \"The Father of Stealth,\" they made the Blackbird. The SR-71 had a top speed of 2193 mph or mach 3+. It flew at 80,000 ft above the ground, the only plane to fly that high.\n\nJohnson died at the age of 80 at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after physical deterioration and the advancement of senility, caused by the hardening of his arteries connecting to his brain."
