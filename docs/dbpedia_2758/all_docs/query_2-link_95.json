As a member and first team leader of the Lockheed Skunk Works, Johnson worked for more than four decades and is said to have been an 'organizing genius.' He has played a leading role in the design of 40 world renowned aircraft. Of these more than half were of his original design. Among them the F-80, America's first production jet; the double-sonic F-104 Starfighter; the high altitude U-2 and the spectacular 2,000 MPH YF-12A and the SR-71.\n\nJohnson acquired a reputation as one of the most talented and prolific aircraft design engineers in the history of aviation. In 2003, as part of its commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight, Aviation Week & Space Technology ranked Johnson 8th on its list of the top 100 \"most important, most interesting, and most influential people\" in the first century of aerospace.\n\nJohnson also was a two time recipient of the Collier Trophy.\n\nwww.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/kelly1.htm\n\nwww.zillow.com/homedetails/16801-Oak-View-Dr-Encino-CA-...\n\nNearby cities:"
