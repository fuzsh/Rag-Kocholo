Selection of recipients for this distinguished award reflect a lifetime career of dedication to the progress of aerospace technology.\n\nThe innovative visionary draftsman/engineer is a respected pioneer in aviation history who saw things that might be possible, could be possible and eventually were possible. Jack Northrop excelled as a designer both of conventional aircraft and of strikingly unusual concepts. He is associated with many design breakthroughs, ranging from the famous Lockheed Vega of the 1920s to his pet flying-wing project, the visionary concept of which finally proved its value in our present stealth aircraft designs. The Jack Northrop Spirit of Innovation Award commemorates the vision, perseverance and engineering prowess reminiscent of Jack Northrop, whose achievements and techniques broke the barriers of traditional aircraft design.\n\nNomination and selection for this award is made by the Engineers’ Council Board of Directors.\n\nClarence L. ” Kelly” Johnson’s achievements over almost six decades captured every major aviation design award and made him an aerospace legend. These achievements go back to the 1930s, but he may be best known for organizing the Lockheed Skunk Works in 1943. It started as a small unit of engineering and production specialists to hurriedly create, build and fly the World War II XP-80 jet prototype for the U.S. Air Force. It was the first of many of the world’s most advanced aircraft to be produced by the Skunk Works under his leadership. Kelly played a leading role in the design of more than forty aircraft including the P-38 Lighting the Constellation transport, the P2V Neptune anti-submarine patrol plane, the record setting F-104 Starfighter, the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and the SR-71 Blackbird. He received more than forty aircraft design and achievement awards and honors (several twice). Included are two Collier trophies, two Theodore von Karman Awards, the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, two Sylvanus Albert Reed Awards and the Daniel Guggenheim Medal. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson presented him the nation’s highest civilian honor the Medal of Freedom. President Ronald Reagan honored Kelly Johnson with the National Security Medal in 1983 and the National Medal of technology in 1988. Kelly was enshrined in the Aviation Hall of Fame in 1974. The Kelly Johnson Skunk Works Award is established to honor and to perpetuate his qualities, accomplishments. and standards as a model of excellence to be aspired to by future generations of engineers pioneering progress of the future.\n\nNomination and selection for this award is made by the Engineers’ Council Board of Directors.\n\nDr. Robert H. Goddard was a physicist of great insight who envisioned the exploration of space and had a genius for invention. In childhood, Robert Goddard was intrigued by the chemical energy of pyrotechnic devices, and dreamed of harnessing their energy to produce propulsive power. In 1912, Dr. Goddard developed the mathematical theory of rocket propulsion as a research fellow at Princeton University, and at Clark University in 1915, proved experimentally that rockets could produce thrust in a vacuum in order to dispel the doubts of a less enlightened scientific community. A modest researcher who eschewed the public eye, he moved his research to Roswell, New Mexico, in 1930, where he built and tested liquid propulsion rockets which successfully achieved high altitude flights and demonstrated fin-stabilized flight control, and filed dozens of related patents, including gyroscopic guidance systems and multistage rockets. Dr. Goddard’s developments spawned the rocket industry that put the first Americans into space and the first humans on the Moon, and his legacy lives today in those who followed his pioneering work.\n\nNomination and selection for this award is made by the Engineers’ Council Board of Directors.\n\nAfter making significant contributions to the sciences of mechanics, structures, fluid dynamics, and aeronautics in his native Hungary and in Germany, Von Kármán immigrated to the United States in 1930 to lead the Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, which he had helped to design. Under his leadership, the laboratory was a vital resource to the emerging Southern California aerospace industry, thrusting Caltech to national pre-eminence. In 1933, Von Kármán founded the United States Institute of Aeronautical Sciences to continue his theoretical research on fluid mechanics and supersonic flight, and in 1944 he established the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech. The first person to receive the National Medal of Science, Von Kármán’s theoretical aerodynamics and work in rocket research has shaped both scientific and political history.\n\nNomination and selection for this award is made by the Engineers’ Council Board of Directors."
