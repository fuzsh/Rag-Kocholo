They had posted to the career positions and I saw it as a great opportunity to enrich my teaching experience.\n\nMy Passions as an Educator\n\nI am a compassionate and data driven Middle School teacher with over 15 years of experience incorporating technology into the classroom. I enjoy teaching mathematics and bringing real world connections to all content areas.\n\nMy Passions and Hobbies\n\nOutside of the classroom I enjoy coaching gymnastics, watching my children play sports, and spending time with family. In the summer I like to spend time relaxing by the water, while in the winter, most weekends are spent in gymnasiums watching gymnastics and wrestling."
