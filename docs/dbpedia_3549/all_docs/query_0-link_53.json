        "text": "Land and Climate\n\nMexico is in the southern part of North America. On the north, it shares a 1,900-mile- (3,100-kilometer-) long border with the United States. To the southeast are Guatemala and Belize. The Pacific Ocean lies to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea are to the east.\n\nGeologically, Mexico is located in one of Earth’s most dynamic areas. It is a part of the Ring of Fire, a region bordering the Pacific Ocean that is characterized by active volcanism and frequent earthquakes. Within the context of plate tectonics, a theory developed to explain the creation of major landform features around the world, Mexico is situated on the western, or leading, edge of the huge North American Plate. Its interaction with the Pacific, Cocos, and Caribbean plates has given rise over geologic time to the Earth-building processes that created most of Mexico. Towering peaks, such as Citlaltépetl (Orizaba) at more than 18,000 feet (5,500 meters), are extremely young in geologic terms (from the early Paleogene period, about 65 to 1.8 million years ago) and are examples of the volcanic forces that built much of central and southern Mexico.\n\nTopographic Regions\n\nMexico can be divided into nine major topographic regions: the Mexican Plateau, the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Cordillera Neo-Volcánica, the Gulf Coastal Plain, the Pacific Coastal Lowlands, Baja California, the Southern Highlands, and the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nThe largest and most densely populated region is the Mexican Plateau. Extending from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec northward to the United States border, the region consists of a central plateau and its dissected borders. The central plateau tilts gently upward from north to south. About 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) above sea level at its northern end, it rises to more than 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) south of Mexico City. Throughout the plateau, relatively flat basins are interrupted by mountainous outcrops.\n\nThe plateau is divided into two major sections. The Mesa del Norte begins near the United States border and ends around San Luis Potosí. This arid lower part of the plateau has few permanent streams. The Mesa Central stretches from San Luis Potosí to just south of Mexico City. Formed largely by volcanic action, the surface of the Mesa Central is higher, moister, and generally flatter than the Mesa del Norte. The Mesa Central is divided into a series of fairly flat valleys separated by eroded volcanic peaks. The valleys are generally fertile and have been the most densely populated portions of Mexico for several hundred years. The largest valleys—such as those in which Mexico City, Puebla, and Guadalajara are located—rarely exceed 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) in area. Many others are quite small. The traditional breadbasket of the country, the Guanajuato Basin, is located in the northern part of the Mesa Central. Many of the basins were sites of major lakes that were drained to facilitate European settlement. Around Mexico City the weak, structurally unstable soils that remain have caused numerous buildings to shift on their foundations and over many years to slowly sink into the ground.\n\nThe Mexican Plateau is flanked by mountains. The Sierra Madre Oriental, a range of folded mountains formed of shale and limestone, is on the eastern side of the plateau. It is often considered an extension of the Rocky Mountains. The average elevation is 8,000–9,000 feet (2,400–2,700 meters), but some peaks rise above 13,000 feet (4,000 meters).\n\nThe largely volcanic Sierra Madre Occidental forms the western border of the Mexican Plateau. It has average elevations similar to those of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Westward-flowing streams that cut through this range have eroded a series of deep barrancas, or canyons. The most spectacular of these is Copper Canyon (Barranca del Cobre), Mexico’s equivalent of the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe Cordillera Neo-Volcánica is a volcanic mountain range that links the Sierra Madre Occidental with the Sierra Madre Oriental at the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau. This range includes such spectacular snowcapped peaks as Citlaltépetl at 18,855 feet (5,747 meters), Popocatépetl at 17,887 feet (5,452 meters), and Iztaccíhuatl at 17,342 feet (5,286 meters). Immediately south of the Cordillera Neo-Volcánica is the Balsas Depression, which takes its name from the major river draining the region. This low-lying area is hot and dry with a distinctive landscape. It consists of a series of small, irregular basins interrupted by hills.\n\nOn the east and west sides of the mountains lie coastal lowlands. The Gulf Coastal Plain extends along the Gulf of Mexico from the Texas border to the Yucatán peninsula, a distance of some 900 miles (1,450 kilometers). Characterized by lagoons and low-lying swampy areas, the triangular northern portion is more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide near the border but tapers toward the south. Inland toward the Sierra Madre Oriental is a series of gently rolling plains dotted by hills and low mountains. Near Tampico, an extension of the Sierra Madre Oriental reaches the sea and interrupts the plain’s continuity. South of Tampico the plain is narrow and irregular, widening at the northern end of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.\n\nThe Pacific Coastal Lowlands are much narrower and less well defined than their east-coast counterpart. Extending from the Mexicali Valley in the north, they terminate near Tepic nearly 900 miles (1,450 kilometers) to the south. Bounded on the east by the steep-sided Sierra Madre Occidental, the lowlands are a series of coastal terraces, mesas, and small basins interspersed with river deltas and restricted coastal strips. Although the vast Sonoran Desert dominates their northern section, parts of the lowlands have been irrigated and transformed into highly productive farmland.\n\nWest of the Pacific Coastal Lowlands, across the Gulf of California, is the Baja (or Lower) California peninsula. This relatively isolated strip of land is nearly 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) long but seldom more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide. The central core is formed by a huge granitic fault block with peaks of more than 9,000 feet (2,700 meters) in the San Pedro Martir and Sierra de Juárez mountain ranges. The gently sloping western side of these ranges is in contrast to the steep eastern escarpment, which makes access from the gulf extremely difficult. Rugged surface features and extreme aridity have limited human settlement, though several stark coastal landscapes have become popular tourist sites.\n\nThe Southern Highlands are a series of highly dissected mountain ranges and plateaus. They include the Sierra Madre del Sur, the Mesa del Sur, and the Chiapas Highlands. The Sierra Madre del Sur is the collective name for a series of mountain ranges in the west that extend from approximately Puerto Vallarta to the Gulf of Tehuantepec. With heights of 7,000 to 8,000 feet (2,100 to 2,400 meters), these mountains often reach the sea and create a rugged coast, part of which is known as the Mexican Riviera. Such picturesque coastal sites as Manzanillo, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Acapulco, and Puerto Escondido have become favorite tourist destinations. However, the less hospitable inland basins provide a difficult environment for traditional peasant farmers. Northeast of the Sierra Madre del Sur is the Mesa del Sur, with numerous stream-eroded ridges and small isolated valleys some 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500 meters) above sea level. The largest and most densely settled valley of this area is the Oaxaca, with a predominantly Indian population. It is one of the poorest, if most picturesque, parts of Mexico.\n\nThe Southern Highlands are bisected by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. This low, narrow strip of land reaches a height of less than 900 feet (275 meters) and extends only slightly more than 125 miles (200 kilometers) from gulf to gulf. A hilly central area is bordered on each side by narrow coastal plains.\n\nThe Chiapas Highlands in southeastern Mexico, also called the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, are an extension of the mountain ranges of Central America. Within these highlands, the low Sierra de Soconusco range lies along the Pacific coast. To the northwest and paralleling the coast is the valley of the Río Grijalva. A group of highly dissected, folded, and faulted mountains is located between the valley and the Tabasco Plain, a southeastern extension of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Among the active volcanoes of the region is El Chichón, which destroyed several villages in 1982.\n\nThe Yucatán peninsula lies northeast of the Tabasco Plain and extends northward, dividing the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The peninsula’s limestone terrain is generally uneven but seldom exceeds 500 feet (150 meters) in elevation. The islands of Cozumel and Mujeres lie off the peninsula’s northeastern tip, near the resort town of Cancún.\n\nRivers and Lakes\n\nMexico has relatively few large rivers or natural lakes. The largest are found in the central part of the country. The Río Lerma has its headwaters in the Toluca Basin west of Mexico City and flows westward to form Lago de Chapala, Mexico’s largest natural lake. Water from the Lerma is tunneled eastward through the mountains to help meet Mexico City’s water needs. The Río Grande de Santiago flows out of Lago de Chapala to the northwest, dropping over the dissected border of the Mesa Central into the Pacific. The eastward-flowing Moctezuma-Pánuco river system drains much of the eastern portion of the Mesa Central. These rivers have carved gorges through the Sierra Madre Oriental to reach the Gulf of Mexico. Lago de Pátzcuaro and Lago de Cuitzeo, west of Mexico City, are remnants of vast lakes and marshes that were once found in the Mesa Central.\n\nThe Río Balsas and its tributaries drain the Balsas Depression as well as much of the southern portion of the Mesa Central. Dammed where it crosses the Sierra Madre del Sur, the Balsas is a major source of hydroelectric power. Farther southeast, the Grijalva-Usamacinta river system drains most of the Chiapas Highlands. Dammed in two places, the Grijalva has created a pair of huge artificial lakes. Together with the Río Papaloapan, which enters the Gulf of Mexico south of Veracruz, the Grijalva and Usamacinta account for about two-fifths of the total volume of Mexico’s rivers.\n\nThe dry north has few permanent rivers, and most of these drain into the interior rather than to the ocean. By far the major river in this part of the country is the Río Bravo del Norte (known as the Rio Grande in the United States), which forms a lengthy part of the international border. Because both the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental originate close to the coast, streams on the west and east coasts are short and steep. Along the Pacific Coastal Lowlands the Ríos Yaqui, Fuerte, and Hunaya have been dammed, and they support vast irrigated fields. Baja California and the Yucatán peninsula are essentially devoid of permanent streams.\n\nClimate\n\nBecause of its topographic diversity and large range in latitude, Mexico has a wide array of climatic conditions. More than half of Mexico lies south of the Tropic of Cancer. Within the tropics, temperature variations from season to season are small, often less than 10 °F (5 °C) between the warmest and coldest months of the year. In these areas winter is defined as the rainiest rather than coldest months.\n\nElevation is a major climatic influence in most parts of Mexico. There are several vertical climatic zones. From sea level to just above 3,000 feet (900 meters) is the tierra caliente (hot land), with uniformly high temperatures. Acapulco, for example, has an average daily temperature of approximately 80 °F (27 °C), with the warmest month (September) averaging 83 °F (28 °C) and the coldest (January) about 78 °F (26 °C). The tierra templada (temperate land) extends from 3,000 feet (900 meters) to about 6,000 feet (1,800 meters). At an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,400 meters), Jalapa has an average daily temperature of 64 °F (18 ° C) with a yearly range of 9 °F (5 °C). The tierra fría (cold land) is situated from about 6,000 to 11,000 feet (1,800 to 3,350 meters). Pachuca, at just under 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), has an average annual temperature of 58 °F (14 °C) and a yearly range of 10 °F (5 °C). Above the tierra fría are the páramos, or alpine pastures, and the tierra helada (frozen land), or permanent snow line, which is found at roughly 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) in central Mexico.\n\nNorth of the tropics, temperature ranges increase substantially and are greatest in north-central Mexico near Ciudad Juárez. The highest temperatures in the country, exceeding 110 °F (43 °C), occur in central Baja California and in the northern Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts in July and August. Outside mountainous areas, the lowest temperatures normally do not fall below 32 °F (0 °C).\n\nMost of Mexico lacks adequate precipitation at least during part of the year. With the exception of the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Sierra Madre Oriental, and the Gulf Coastal Plain, all of Mexico north of the tropics generally receives less than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of precipitation annually and can be classified as either tropical desert or tropical steppe. Nearly all of Baja California, much of Sonora state, and large parts of Chihuahua state receive less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain yearly. Much of central and southern Mexico receives less than 40 inches (102 centimeters) of precipitation yearly and can be classified as having tropical savanna or highland savanna climates. Only the Gulf Coastal Plain and the adjacent mountains, the Chiapas Highlands, and the southern part of the Yucatán peninsula receive abundant rain year-round. In combination with high temperatures, this creates a tropical rainforest climate in these areas.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nNatural vegetation in Mexico is primarily a response to climate. The tropical deserts of Baja California, Sonora, and north-central Mexico are characterized by sparse desert scrub vegetation. On the higher portions of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan steppes, as well as in much of Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, a distinctive ecosystem has evolved composed of grasses, shrubs, and a variety of cacti and other succulents.\n\nMost of the Sierra Madre Occidental and large parts of the Mesa Central were originally covered by forests of conifers (cone-bearing trees) and deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves seasonally). Similar forests extended southward into the Southern Highlands. Long periods of human occupation in these regions have caused most of the natural vegetation to disappear. The semiarid Balsas Depression has a tropical scrub vegetation of shrubs, low deciduous trees, and scattered cacti.\n\nThe high precipitation zones of the Gulf Coastal Plain, the adjacent east-facing mountain slopes, the Chiapas Highlands, and the southern part of the Yucatán peninsula are dominated by tropical rainforests. These dense stands of broad-leaved evergreen trees are among the most luxuriant and diversified in the world. However, Mexico’s rainforests, like those elsewhere in the tropics, continue to be degraded through farming, logging, ranching, and mining. Satellite images have indicated a particularly high loss of forest in Chiapas from the 1970s to the early 21st century. A large portion of the Pacific coastal area from Mazatlán to the Guatemalan border is covered by tropical deciduous and semi-deciduous forests, but they lack the variety and density of the tropical rainforests found in southeastern Mexico.\n\nThe natural wildlife of northern Mexico was severely affected by the introduction of cattle, sheep, and goats more than 400 years ago. While rabbits, snakes, and armadillos abound in the deserts and steppes, such larger animals as deer and mountain lions are found only in isolated or mountainous areas. A millennium of human habitation has brought about the virtual elimination of much of the natural fauna throughout the Mesa Central and parts of the Southern Highlands, especially the Oaxaca Valley. In contrast, the rainforests of the Gulf coast and Chiapas and the semideciduous forests of the Pacific coast still provide habitat for many animals, including monkeys, parrots, jaguars, and tapirs.\n\nMexico is central to the migratory patterns of many species. Massive flocks of ducks and geese migrate into the northern part of the Sierra Madre Occidental to winter. In addition, millions of endangered monarch butterflies migrate annually between regions of the United States and Mexico’s western Mesa Central to overwinter on about a dozen forested peaks, particularly in eastern Michoacán state. That state’s Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. However, smog from the Mexico City metropolitan area and extensive logging activities threaten the butterflies and their roosting trees.\n\nMexico has a bountiful supply of marine life. The Gulf of California is renowned for its game fishes. The Gulf of Mexico, especially the east side of the Yucatán peninsula, is a scuba diver’s paradise, as tropical fish teem in clean, clear waters.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nMexico’s population has grown remarkably since the mid–20th century. In 1910 Mexico had a population of about 15 million, and by 1940 the number had increased to only 20 million. After that, however, the rate of natural increase rose rapidly because of improvements in health care and food supplies. By 1960 Mexico had more than 34 million people, and by 1970 more than 58 million. The population surpassed 66 million in 1980, 81 million in 1990, and 97 million in 2000. It reached 100 million shortly after the turn of the 21st century.\n\nMore than half of the Mexican people live on the Mesa Central, which accounts for only 15 percent of the country’s territory. Parts of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Southern Highlands, especially the Oaxaca Valley, are relatively densely settled, but southern Baja California, much of the Yucatán peninsula, and large parts of the Chiapas Highlands are sparsely populated.\n\nThe movement of people within Mexico has significantly altered the population distribution. Massive migrations of peasants from rural areas and small towns to cities began in the 1950s. Many have moved because they lacked land, job opportunities, and social amenities. More than four-fifths of the Mexican people now live in cities, compared with about half of the population in 1960. In the 1980s Mexico had more than 100 urban centers with at least 50,000 people. By the early 21st century well over 100 cities had populations in excess of 100,000, including some two dozen with more than 500,000 people.\n\nIn addition to internal migration, the number of individuals who have emigrated from Mexico to the United States has grown sharply since the 1970s. Each year tens of thousands of Mexicans make illegal attempts to enter the United States, largely in search of jobs and better opportunities. Mexicans also have become the largest group of legal immigrants to the United States, with nearly 170,000 obtaining lawful permanent resident status in the year 2017 alone. Though a large proportion of the emigrants have low educational levels and limited technical skills, an increasing number of highly qualified technicians and professionals have found their way north, causing a “brain drain” for Mexico.\n\nEthnic Groups\n\nMexico’s population comprises a number of ethnic groups. American Indians, the indigenous people of Mexico, account for less than one-tenth of the total. People of mixed Indian and European descent, called mestizos, account for about three-fifths of the population, making them the largest ethnic group. Mexicans of European heritage are a significant component of the other ethnic groups who constitute the remainder of the population.\n\nWhen Europeans arrived in the early 1500s, the land that is now Mexico was inhabited by numerous American Indian peoples. They are thought to have migrated into the New World from Asia some 40,000 to 60,000 years ago by crossing a former land bridge in what is now the Bering Strait. Highly organized civilizations had occupied various regions of Mexico for at least 2,000 years before European contact.\n\nIn the early 1500s the great majority of the Indians lived in the Mesa Central. Most were under the general rule of the Aztec Empire. However, many separate cultural groups thrived in the region, among them speakers of Tarastec, Otomi, and Nahuatl. Outside the Mesa Central were numerous other cultural groups such as the Maya of the Yucatán and the Mixtec and Zapotec of Oaxaca. Spectacular Mayan ruins in the Yucatán are evidence of widespread urbanization and intensive agricultural productivity dating back to about ad 250. The Aztec cities of the Mesa Central were marvels of architectural design, irrigation technology, and social organization.\n\nThere are several areas where Indian peoples are still the dominant population group. Mayan peoples are the majority in the rural Yucatán and the Chiapas Highlands. In the Oaxaca Valley and in remoter parts of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Indian (primarily Zapotec) communities abound. Despite their decreasing numbers, enclaves of Indians also are still significant in isolated mountain areas on the eastern edge of the Mesa Central.\n\nAfter the arrival of Europeans, intermarriage resulted in the mestizo population. Over the centuries mestizos became the dominant ethnic group. Northern Mexico is overwhelmingly mestizo in both urban and rural areas. Mexicans of European descent are largely concentrated in urban areas, especially Mexico City, and in the west.\n\nLanguages\n\nSpanish is the official national language and the language of instruction in schools. Spanish speakers form the bulk of the population throughout most of the country. A relatively small percentage of Mexicans speak an Indian language, although more than 50 Indian languages are spoken in the country. They include Maya in the Yucatán and Huastec in northern Veracruz. Nahua, Tarastec, Totonac, Otomí, and Mazahua are spoken mainly on the Mesa Central. Zapotec, Mixtec, and Mazatec are spoken in Oaxaca and Tzeltal and Tzotzil in Chiapas.\n\nReligions\n\nThe dominant religion in Mexico is Christianity. More than four-fifths of the people identify themselves as Roman Catholics. The Basilica of Guadalupe, the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico’s patron saint, is located in Mexico City. Hundreds of thousands of people make pilgrimages to the site each year. Protestants account for a small but growing segment of the population. Many Indian peoples combine traditional religious beliefs and practices with Roman Catholicism. For example, they may honor ancestors, mountain spirits, and other spiritual forces alongside Catholic saints.\n\nThe Arts\n\nMexican writers and artists have received worldwide acclaim for their creativity and innovation. Both folk and classical traditions are strong in their work.\n\nMexico’s most renowned writers have gained their reputations by dealing with questions of universal significance. Octavio Paz is widely considered to be the foremost poet of Latin America. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990. The novelist and short-story writer Carlos Fuentes is honored throughout the world, and Juan José Arreola’s fantasies are widely admired. Among playwrights, Rodolfo Usigli, Luisa Josefina Hernández, and Emilio Carballido have made significant contributions to Mexican drama.\n\nPerhaps the most widely recognized Mexican art form is the mural. The murals created by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco, depicting aspects of the Mexican Revolution, the country’s modernization, and class struggle, are legend. Orozco is also perhaps the most popular of Mexico’s folk artists. His animated plaster-of-paris skeleton characters are both satirical and lifelike. Other notable artists include Rufino Tamayo, Juan Soriano, and Frida Kahlo.\n\nThe musical style known as mariachi is distinctively Mexican. Mariachi music emerged in west-central Mexico in the late 1700s or early 1800s. Since the early 20th century mariachi performers typically have worn traje de charro, the attire of the cowboys of Jalisco state—matching uniforms with ornamented trousers, boots, wide bow ties, sombreros, and short jackets. Mariachi music features guitars, violins, and brass instruments, but electronic synthesizers and heavy downbeats can be added to produce nortec music. Accordions often accompany norteño bands. In addition to their own musical creations, many Mexicans enjoy Latin imports such as cumbia and danzón and various styles of rock and pop music.\n\nA number of Mexican actors and filmmakers have gained international recognition. In 2014 Alfonso Cuarón became the first Mexican filmmaker to win an Academy Award for best director. He earned the honor for the science-fiction film Gravity (2013). He won the award again for the 2018 drama Roma. Alejandro González Iñárritu also twice received the award, for Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014) and The Revenant (2015). Salma Hayek was the first Mexican actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress, for her portrayal of Frida Kahlo in Frida (2002).\n\nTo encourage and help to disseminate Mexican art in all its forms, the federal government sponsors the National Institute of Fine Arts. Under its auspices are the programs of the National Symphony Orchestra, the Ballet Folklórico, and the Modern and Classical Ballet—all of which travel nationally and internationally to promote Mexican culture. Additionally, folk and popular culture receive support through government institutes, including the Native Institute, which seeks to preserve and encourage traditional craftsmanship.\n\nEducation and Social Welfare\n\nMexico has made great efforts to improve educational opportunities for its people. The federal government funds public schools that provide free primary and secondary education. As in most developing countries, the social infrastructure is much more established in cities than in the countryside, but the government has sought to provide primary schools to all rural areas. In addition, government programs have significantly improved adult literacy. In the early 21st century Mexico’s illiteracy rate was estimated to be about 5 percent, down from nearly 25 percent in 1970.\n\nAll children are required to attend school from ages 6 to 18. Since 2004 preschool has been mandatory as well. Although nearly three-quarters of all primary public schools are located in rural areas, such schools are the poorest in the country. Many internal migrants choose to move to cities because of the availability of better schools for their children. In general, private schools offer superior education compared to public schools. Therefore, families who can afford it send their children to private schools. This contributes to a socioeconomic imbalance that favors the middle and upper classes.\n\nMexico has more than 50 universities. They are concentrated in the largest cities, especially Mexico City. The most prestigious institutions of higher education include the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the College of Mexico, and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education.\n\nAlong with education, the federal government plays a major role in providing medical care. Several government institutions operate hospitals. Subsidized medical and hospital care is available to all citizens. But as with education, public medicine generally is considered inferior to private care. Those who can afford it avail themselves of private physicians and hospitals.\n\nClinics, sometimes attended only by a nurse, are found throughout the country. Anything more than the most basic medical needs, however, must be handled in the cities. The quality of medical care varies throughout the country. Mexico City is by far the most important center for specialized medical treatment. The overall quality of medical care in Mexico lags behind that available in the United States and in Europe. Many Mexicans travel outside the country for more sophisticated surgeries and treatments.\n\nStrong differences in health characteristics are found from region to region. In general, rural areas have much higher mortality and morbidity levels than do urban areas. Regions with high Indian populations—such as Chiapas, Oaxaca, and isolated portions of Guerrero and the mountainous eastern portions of the Mesa Central—have high death rates and generally low health standards. Significant differences also exist between social classes in the cities. For example, diseases associated with unsafe water supplies or air pollution disproportionately afflict the urban poor.\n\nAnother serious problem in Mexico is the lack of adequate housing. Within the cities the federal government has built multiunit housing projects. However, urban populations have increased more rapidly than new units can be constructed. Economic difficulties have also reduced the funds available for new construction. In virtually all urban areas, squatter settlements at the edges of cities are a major feature of the landscape. These informal settlements, or colonias, initially lack basic services such as running water and electricity, but most evolve over time into very modest but livable communities.\n\nMajor Cities\n\nMexico’s largest cities occupy a nearly continuous urban band that stretches diagonally across the center of the country, from Guadalajara in the west to Puebla in the east. In the middle of this band lies Mexico City, the country’s political, economic, social, and educational capital. In the early 21st century its metropolitan area was home to nearly one-fifth of Mexico’s population. Guadalajara, Mexico’s second largest urban area, is a chief market center and industrial producer. Puebla is a colonial city known for its distinctive regional cuisine and traditional forms of clothing, music, and dance. Monterrey, located in northeastern Mexico, is an important center of commerce and industry.\n\nCities near Mexico’s border with the United States have grown spectacularly since the 1970s, especially during the 1990s. Their growth was spurred largely by migrants looking for jobs in the nearby United States or in Mexican factories called maquiladoras. These factories import parts from the United States and Canada duty-free, assemble them, and export the finished products. Ciudad Juárez, facing El Paso, Texas, across the international boundary, and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California, have more than 1 million people each.\n\nEconomy\n\nMexico has a developing economy based mainly on manufacturing and services, especially tourism and trade with the United States. Agriculture still employs a significant portion of the workforce, but it accounts for only a small percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP). The economy is bolstered by billions of dollars sent home annually by Mexican workers abroad, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe Mexican economy made major gains in the 1970s, largely on the strength of revenues from the country’s extensive petroleum reserves. A sudden drop in petroleum prices on the world market in 1982 brought on an economic crisis unparalleled in the country’s history. High interest rates and inflation contributed to the crisis as well. The value of the Mexican peso declined sharply in the first six years of the 1980s, from less than 50 to more than 1,100 to the United States dollar.\n\nIn the late 1980s Mexico’s government loosened its grip on the economy, which led to an economic transformation. The government turned over many state-owned companies to the private sector and encouraged foreign investment and trade. In the mid-1990s the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) created a free-trade zone between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. NAFTA, along with similar trade agreements with the European Union and other countries, helped to shift Mexico’s economy away from its dependence on petroleum sales toward the export of manufactured goods.\n\nDespite a period of robust growth in the early 1990s, Mexico experienced another financial crisis after the government devalued the peso in late 1994. The devaluation triggered the deepest recession in Mexican history, with the country’s GDP falling nearly 7 percent in 1995. International loans and a government austerity plan combining spending cuts with tax increases helped pull the economy out of recession. Strong export revenues in the late 1990s also aided the economic recovery. A brief downturn in the early 21st century, caused by a recession in the United States, emphasized the extent to which the Mexican economy had become linked to that of its largest trading partner. In August 2018 Mexico and the United States announced that they had come to terms on a new trade agreement. The new accord preserved much of NAFTA but included a number of significant changes, including requirements for improved labor conditions and higher wages for many workers. Canada later agreed to join the new trade accord, which was branded the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). Mexico ratified the USMCA in 2019, but the accord still required approval from the other countries’ legislatures before it would go into effect.\n\nAgriculture, Fishing, and Forestry\n\nFarming and ranching were the traditional mainstays of Mexico’s economy. The Mesa Central, with the country’s most fertile soils and the largest tracts of agricultural land, has supported a dense farming population for at least 1,000 years. By the early 21st century agriculture, combined with fishing and forestry, produced less than 5 percent of the GDP. However, the sector still employed about one-eighth of the country’s workers. The agricultural sector is made up largely of subsistence farmers and laborers.\n\nCrops\n\nMexico has a limited amount of good agricultural land. Much of the country is too arid or too mountainous for crops. It is estimated that no more than one-fifth of the land is potentially arable. Normally only 10 to 15 percent of the country’s area is planted with crops annually. Because of weather conditions less than that is harvested. About a quarter of the cropland in production is irrigated. The chief crops include corn (maize), sugarcane, sorghum, wheat, cotton, tomatoes, bananas, chilies, and green peppers. Oranges, lemons and limes, mangoes, and other fruits are also grown, along with beans, barley, avocados, blue agave, and coffee.\n\nA significant proportion of Mexican agriculture still relies on traditional farming methods. This is especially true of the regions with predominantly Indian populations, such as the Southern Highlands. In these regions farmers practice subsistence agriculture based on corn, beans, and squash on small plots of land, which are often parts of communal village holdings. This system is highly labor intensive and has low per-capita productivity, limiting opportunities for economic advancement.\n\nWhile not its major objective, one of the legacies of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20) was land reform, which produced the ejido system of communal farm villages. At the time of the revolution, Mexico’s rural peasantry was virtually landless and worked under a system of debt peonage on the haciendas (large estates) that dominated the countryside. The constitution of 1917 limited the amount of land that an individual could own and legalized the federal government’s expropriation and redistribution of land to the landless. Initially, small parcels were granted to communal groups whose members worked holdings individually or in common. Later, land redistribution produced many small holdings of 10 to 20 acres (4 to 8 hectares) as well as cooperative ejidos, most of which have since been privatized.\n\nCommercial agricultural products come from three major regions—the tropical parts of the Gulf coast and Chiapas Highlands, the irrigated lands of the Mesa del Norte and the Pacific Coastal Lowlands, and the Bajío in the Mesa Central. Tropical crops have been grown on the Gulf Coastal Plain and the adjacent highlands since the early colonial period. Production now extends from north of Tampico to the Chiapas Highlands and inland to the east-facing slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Coffee and sugarcane are the major crops in value and acreage. Coffee is one of Mexico’s most valuable export crops. Sugarcane is produced mainly for the domestic market, as are bananas, pineapples, papayas, mangoes, cacao, and rice. Mexico is one of the world’s major exporters of vanilla, which is grown mainly in these areas. Along the coastal plain near the Guatemalan border, cotton has become a major crop.\n\nIrrigated agriculture has brought large-scale commercial production to the Mesa del Norte and the Pacific Coastal Lowlands. Cotton has become the dominant crop in many of the irrigation projects developed since the 1930s, though much wheat is grown in Chihuahua as well. Wheat is the major crop produced in the northwestern part of the Pacific Coastal Lowlands, which is now Mexico’s primary grain center. Cotton, vegetables, and oilseeds are also grown there. Melons and winter vegetables, especially tomatoes and lettuce, are produced mainly for markets in the United States. Cotton is the major crop in the Mexicali Valley.\n\nWithin the Mesa Central, the Bajío is a commercial agricultural region of long standing. Traditionally considered the breadbasket of Mexico, it produces wheat, corn, vegetables, peanuts (groundnuts), strawberries, and beans on small holdings. The Bajío has the advantage of being near major cities. Nevertheless, it has been surpassed in production by the northwest.\n\nMexico produces two specialized crops that are rarely grown outside the country. Henequen, a member of the agave family, is a plant whose fiber is used to make furniture and ropes. Introduced to the Yucatán peninsula in the 1880s, it remains a significant export crop for the region. Maguey, another member of agave family, is planted in many parts of the Mesa Central. It is used to make pulque, an inexpensive alcoholic beverage, as well as durable fibers for weaving and craft making.\n\nLivestock\n\nRanching has been centered in the Mesa del Norte since Mexico gained independence. Open-range cattle operations, frequently exceeding 250,000 acres (100,000 hectares) in size, were created in the late 1700s and 1800s. A number of very large holdings remain despite land reform. Because of dry conditions and limited natural vegetation, the land cannot support large herds of grazing animals. Many ranchers have adapted to the aridity by replacing open-range methods with rotational grazing systems. Some natural pastures have been improved through irrigation, top seeding, and fertilization. Supplemental feeding of stock has also become more common.\n\nCattle are also raised commercially in tropical areas, mainly on the Gulf Coastal Plain, the Southern Highlands, and the Sierra Madre del Sur. Abundant vegetation and moisture allow the land to support many more animals than in the north. Rainforests have been cleared and planted with imported African grasses to facilitate grazing. Besides cattle, the main livestock raised in Mexico are pigs, goats, and sheep.\n\nFishing\n\nThe waters off Mexico’s nearly 5,500 miles (8,900 kilometers) of coastline are richly endowed with marine resources. Along the Gulf coast, there are two valuable shrimping grounds—from Tampico to the United States border and from Veracruz to Campeche. These areas have been fished commercially since the 1940s. The Gulf of California shrimping grounds were not exploited on a large scale until the late 1950s, but they are now the most productive.\n\nDeepwater fish abound off the Pacific coast of Baja California. Since the creation of a commercial fishing fleet in the 1960s, this area has become the country’s major fishing ground. Sardines, anchovies, and tuna are the leading species taken. Near the Pacific shore of Baja California, lobster and abalone are caught in commercial quantities. The rest of the ocean catch comes from the Gulf of Mexico, especially off the Campeche Bank on the north coast of the Yucatán peninsula.\n\nForestry\n\nAbout one-third of Mexico’s territory is forested. It is estimated that nearly two-thirds of the country was covered by forests in the mid-1500s, but uncontrolled logging decimated the resource. Though conservation is now practiced in some of the pine forests in the north, logging continues to damage some areas. Along the Gulf coast, farmers still uproot rainforests to make room for crops and pasture.\n\nThe largest forests are in the tropical east and south. These forests yield a wide variety of valuable products, including such hardwoods as oak and mahogany and such fragrant woods as cedar and rosewood. The rainforests of the Chiapas Highlands and the southern Yucatán are also the source of chicle, the latex traditionally used in the manufacture of chewing gum.\n\nSoftwood forests are found in the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre Occidental above 6,000 feet (1,800 meters). Stands of ponderosa, lodgepole, and other pines are well developed in the Sierra Madre Occidental, especially in the states of Chihuahua and Durango. The bulk of the softwoods used for construction lumber and plywoods are felled and milled in this region.\n\nIndustry\n\nMexico is a leader among Latin American countries in industrialization. Its industrial base grew significantly in the 1990s with the introduction of NAFTA, which spurred the manufacture of goods for export. In the early 21st century industry, including manufacturing, construction, and mining, accounted for nearly a third of the GDP and about a quarter of the workforce.\n\nMining and Energy\n\nMinerals have always been a significant part of Mexico’s economy. Silver has long been the most valuable product mined. Mexico is still among the world’s leading silver producers. The major mining area during the colonial period was the Silver Belt, a region that extended from Zacatecas and Guanajuato in the northern part of the Mesa Central to Chihuahua in the Mesa del Norte. Eastern outposts included San Luis Potosí.\n\nThe Silver Belt is still Mexico’s primary source of nonfuel minerals, both precious and industrial. Silver is taken from the older centers of Guanajuato, Pachuca, and Zacatecas, but zinc, gold, lead, iron ore, cadmium, and such trace minerals as antimony and manganese are also important. Rich copper deposits were discovered in the late 1800s in Santa Rosalía in Baja California, but they have been largely exhausted. The country’s largest remaining copper deposits are mined at Cananea and La Caridad in northern Sonora state.\n\nMexico ranks among the world’s leading petroleum producers. Petroleum sales account for a significant portion of the country’s foreign-exchange earnings. The great majority of Mexico’s oil exports go to the United States.\n\nMexico’s first petroleum fields were discovered about 1900 off Tampico on the Gulf coast. Shortly thereafter additional fields were found farther south near the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Foreign companies invested in petroleum exploration until the government nationalized the industry in 1938. It created Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) as a semiautonomous government agency responsible for discovering, producing, and marketing petroleum. Pemex became one of the largest oil companies in the world.\n\nMexico has huge proven and potential reserves of petroleum and substantial reserves of natural gas. The main oilfields are in the Bay of Campeche (an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico) and along its coast. In the early 21st century the offshore Canterell field accounted for three-fifths of the country’s petroleum output, but it had begun a long-term decline. Major natural gas fields are located near Reynosa in northeastern Mexico, near Veracruz, and in the Chiapas-Tabasco region of the Gulf coast. A system of pipelines moves oil and natural gas to major cities in the Mesa Central and to the United States border, where it links with other pipelines.\n\nSulfur is found together with petroleum in many of the gulf fields and is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of products. There are petrochemical plants in Veracruz state at Coatzacoalcos, the major export center for sulfur products, and Ciudad Pemex in Tabasco. Both are located in formerly unpopulated rainforest regions. There are also several petrochemical sites near refineries in the Mesa Central.\n\nThermal power plants, fired mainly by oil and natural gas, generate about three-fourths of Mexico’s electricity. Both nuclear power and renewable resources (wind, solar, and biomass) combined account for about one-tenth of the country’s electric power. Hydroelectric power facilities provide about one-sixth of the country’s needs.\n\nManufacturing\n\nManufactured goods surpassed petroleum to become Mexico’s leading export during the 1980s. By the early 21st century manufacturing accounted for some 90 percent of the country’s exports. The most important manufactures include motor vehicles and parts, processed foods and beverages, iron and steel, chemicals, textiles and clothing, consumer products, and refined petroleum.\n\nHistorically, a disproportionate share of manufacturing has been concentrated in the Mexico City metropolitan area, largely because of its huge market and superior infrastructure. Its impressive array of manufactured products includes automobiles, electronics, iron and steel, foods, and consumer goods. Government efforts to spread industry to sites outside the capital have been most successful in the north, with the development of maquiladoras in such cities as Ciudad Juárez, Tijuana, and Mexicali. These factories produce such goods as motor vehicles and automobile parts, electronics, clothing, and furniture. Most of the maquiladoras are foreign-owned and located in Mexico to take advantage of low labor costs and less-strict environmental laws. Automobile assembly plants are located in Puebla and Toluca in the central region, Guadalajara in the west, and Hermosillo in the northwest. Textiles are produced in older centers in Puebla and Guadalajara as well as newer ones in Torreón and Ciudad Juárez.\n\nServices\n\nThe Mexican economy depends heavily on the service sector, which includes trade, tourism, finance, government, health care, transportation, and many other activities. Services account for about two-thirds of Mexico’s GDP and employ more than three-fifths of the workforce.\n\nForeign trade is a cornerstone of Mexico’s economy. The United States is Mexico’s most important trading partner by far, especially since NAFTA took effect in 1994. The United States is the destination for four-fifths of Mexico’s exports and the source of about half of its imports. Mexico’s other trading partners include Canada, China, and Japan. The country’s major exports include machinery and transport equipment, electronics, food products, petroleum and petroleum products, and silver. Among its major imports are machinery and transport equipment, electrical equipment, plastics, and consumer goods.\n\nTourism has been a growth industry in Mexico. The country annually attracts millions of tourists, especially from the United States, with its cultural diversity, tropical settings, and relatively low prices. Historically, tourists came mostly to visit Mexico City and surrounding colonial towns in the Mesa Central or to the Mayan ruins of the Yucatán. Tourists later discovered Mexico’s beaches, and the government invested heavily in this sector of the economy. The world-famous resorts of Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Cancún, Cozumel, and Cabo San Lucas were developed or significantly improved beginning in the 1960s through the construction of new airports, hotels, and other tourist facilities.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nBecause of its physical diversity and developing economy, Mexico has had difficulty creating an integrated transportation network. Some parts of Mexico lack good rail and road connections, especially from east to west across the northern part of the country.\n\nAlthough Mexico was one of the first countries in Latin America to develop railway lines, the railway system remains inefficient. Service began to improve, however, after the government privatized the system in the mid-1990s. Major rail routes extend outward from Mexico City along the west coast to Mexicali, northward to El Paso and Laredo, Texas, eastward via the Gulf Coastal Plain to the Yucatán peninsula, and southeastward to Oaxaca.\n\nHighways are the major mode of transporting passengers and goods in Mexico. Though Mexico’s roads have improved tremendously since the 1960s, many are still in poor condition. As with the railways, all major roads lead to Mexico City. Several link northern border cities to the capital, and others connect the Yucatán peninsula and the Guatemalan border with the Mesa Central. The Pan-American Highway runs from Ciudad Cuauhtémoc, on the border with Guatemala, to Nuevo Laredo, on the border with the United States, passing through Mexico City.\n\nDomestic and international airports have been built throughout Mexico, largely to serve the expanding tourist industry. Air service now reaches all tourist locations and most of the country’s small and medium-sized cities. In the 1990s the government began to privatize the airline industry. By the early 21st century the national airlines had been sold to private investors.\n\nPrivatization of Mexico’s ports also started in the 1990s. Important ports on the Pacific coast include Manzanillo, Lázaro Cárdenas, and Salina Cruz. Gulf coast ports include Tampico, Coatzacoalcos, Altamira, and Veracruz.\n\nCellular phone use has increased rapidly in the country. Cell phone subscriptions now greatly outnumber that of landline phones. Internet access has also continued to expand. The number of Internet users includes about three-fifths of the Mexican population. Hundreds of radio and television stations serve the country, most of which are privately operated. Mexico is a world leader in the production of Spanish-language television programming, videos, and other electronic media. Many television shows are syndicated internationally. Mexican telenovelas (evening soap operas) and variety shows are especially popular.\n\nHistory\n\nHumans may have lived in Mexico for more than 20,000 years. The earliest settlers were probably hunters of mammoth and other large herd animals. Archaeologists have found tools and mammoth bones in central Mexico dating from about 9000 bc.\n\nLater, after about 7500 bc, the Indians were forced to adopt new means of subsistence as the region became drier and the types of animals changed. They turned from big-game hunting to the hunting of small game and the collecting of wild food plants. Gradually they learned to grow their own plants, including corn, avocados, chili peppers, squashes, pumpkins, and beans. By 2000 bc some villages, mainly in the south, were sustained largely or wholly by farming.\n\nEarly Indian Civilizations\n\nThe Olmec created the first great pre-Columbian civilization in Middle America. They lived on the lowland coast of the Gulf of Mexico in what is now southern Mexico. Their oldest known building site, San Lorenzo, dates to about 1150 bc and is remarkable for its colossal stone sculptures of human heads. The cultural patterns of the Olmec spread north to central Mexico and south to Central America.\n\nAmong those influenced by the Olmec were the Zapotec, Maya, and Teotihuacán civilizations. The Zapotec controlled the Oaxaca Valley and parts of the Southern Highlands. Their capital, Monte Albán, was near the present-day city of Oaxaca. It reached its height between ad 300 and 900. At about the same time the Maya developed their civilization in what is now southern Mexico and Guatemala. The chief Mayan cities included Chichén Itzá, Uxmal, and Palenque. The largest (though not most populous) city of pre-Columbian central Mexico was Teotihuacán, near present-day Mexico City. It was at its most powerful in the first 700 years ad. It eventually covered about 8 square miles (21 square kilometers) and had some 150,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe next great power in central Mexico was the Toltec, who invaded from the north. Their capital was Tula, not far from Mexico City. Tula was a magnificent city with pyramids, temples, public buildings, statuary, private residences, and ball courts. The Toltec controlled the region from about 900 to 1200. Their decline followed an invasion of the nomadic Chichimec, who also came from the north.\n\nThe Aztec arrived in central Mexico in the 1200s. According to tradition, the god Huitzilopochtli told them to establish a city on a site where an eagle with a snake in its beak rested on a cactus. In the early 1300s they saw this sign on an island in Lake Texcoco and founded their capital, Tenochtitlán, there. The story of the city’s foundation is depicted on Mexico’s flag and official seal. The country’s name derives from an alternate name for the Aztec, the Mexica. When the Spanish arrived in Mexico, the Aztec controlled most of the Mesa Central through a tribute system that extracted taxes and political servility from conquered peoples. The Tlaxcalans to the east, the Tarascans on the west, and the Chichimec in the north were outside the Aztec domain and frequently warred with them.\n\nSpanish Conquest\n\nIn 1518 the Spanish governor of Cuba chose Hernán Cortés to lead an expedition to conquer Mexico. Cortés entered central Mexico in 1519 after marching overland from Veracruz, the town he had founded on the Gulf Coastal Plain. Though he came with only about 500 soldiers and 16 horses, Cortés assembled a large army from among the Aztec’s Indian enemies. After a brief initial success at Tenochtitlán, the Spanish were driven out in 1520, but they returned in 1521 to overwhelm the Aztec and destroy the city. This victory marked the fall of the Aztec Empire. Cortés’s success was the result of a combination of factors, including his abilities as a leader and the superiority of European arms (muskets, crossbows, steel swords, and body armor). Cortés was also greatly aided by his interpreter-mistress, an American Indian woman known as Marina (La Malinche). It was Marina’s skill as an interpreter that allowed the Spanish to communicate effectively with the various Indian tribes they encountered and to recruit them as allies against the Aztec. After defeating the Aztec, Cortés established Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlán. Within a short time the Spanish conquered the rest of central and southern Mexico and much of Central America from their base in Mexico City.\n\nThe Spanish needed a longer time to occupy northern Mexico. Spanish expansion in this area was motivated in large part by the hope of discovering precious metals. The effective occupation of northern Mexico occurred later in the 1500s and involved extensive fighting with nomadic Indians. Throughout much of the north, the first Spanish settlers were Franciscans and Jesuits who established missions. Meanwhile, to administer Mexico and its other conquered lands, Spain created the Viceroyalty of New Spain. It was governed by a viceroy chosen by the Spanish king.\n\nThe Spanish conquest was devastating to the indigenous population. During the early years after contact, millions of Indians died from European diseases such as measles and smallpox, for which they had no immunity. Central Mexico did not regain its pre-Columbian population numbers until perhaps 1900.\n\nIn addition, the Spanish usurped the Indian lands and redistributed them among themselves, first as encomiendas and later as haciendas. Under the encomienda system, the Spanish government granted a number of Indians living in a particular area to a soldier, official, or others. The receiver of the grant, the encomendero, could exact tribute from the Indians in gold or in labor and was required to protect them and instruct them in Christianity. Though the encomienda did not include a grant of land, in practice the encomenderos gained control of the Indians’ lands and failed to fulfill their obligations to the Indians. Later, on the large estates called haciendas, Indian laborers were bound to the land by debts to the landowners. By the 19th century probably up to half of the rural population of Mexico was entangled in this system of debt peonage.\n\nIndependence\n\nAlong with other Spanish colonies in the New World, Mexico fought for and gained its independence in the early 1800s. On September 16, 1810, in the town of Dolores (now Dolores Hidalgo), the priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang his church’s bells and exhorted the local Indians to “recover from the hated Spaniards the land stolen from your forefathers…” This is celebrated as Mexican Independence Day. Royalist forces captured Hidalgo in March 1811 and executed him in July. Though he accomplished little, Padre Hidalgo’s name became the symbol of the independence movement for most Mexicans.\n\nHidalgo was succeeded by José María Morelos y Pavón, another parish priest but a more able leader than his predecessor. Between 1812 and 1815 Morelos controlled most of Mexico southwest of Mexico City. In 1813 he called a national congress, which declared Mexico to be independent from Spain and drafted a constitution. Before the new government could take effect, however, royalist forces crushed the revolutionaries. Morelos was executed by a Spanish firing squad in 1815, but his army, led by Vicente Guerrero, continued fighting.\n\nBecause of weaknesses and political divisions in Spain, the revolutionary movement gained strength. In 1821 Agustín de Iturbide, a royalist officer, joined forces with Guerrero and drafted the Iguala Plan, which provided for national independence under a constitutional monarchy. The Mexican forces triumphed over the Spaniards and achieved independence for Mexico in August 1821. The country was renamed the Mexican Empire. Iturbide was crowned emperor in July 1822, but he proved unable to bring order and stability to the country. All parties soon turned against him. Opposition solidified behind Antonio López de Santa Anna, who called for Iturbide’s overthrow. Iturbide was exiled from the country but returned and was executed. A constitution adopted in 1824 eliminated the monarchy and made Mexico a republic.\n\nSanta Anna would be the dominant political force in Mexico for some 30 years. He was president of Mexico when Texas revolted and declared itself an independent republic in 1836. In 1845 the United States annexed Texas, which led to the Mexican-American War of 1846–48. At the end of the war, under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico gave up a vast territory in what is now the western and southwestern United States.\n\nJuárez Years\n\nAfter nearly a half century of independence, Mexico had made relatively little economic or political progress. The peasantry continued to suffer. A group of liberals emerged who believed that Mexico’s survival as an independent country depended on fundamental reform. The leader of the movement was Benito Juárez, a Zapotec from Oaxaca. In 1854 the liberals forced Santa Anna out of the presidency and began a revolution called La Reforma (The Reform). Determined to reduce the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, in 1856 the government issued a law called Ley Lerdo. It separated church and state, abolished monastic orders, and forced the church to sell its property. Juárez had anticipated that Indians and peasants would reacquire the 50 percent of the country’s land formerly held by the church, but the properties were quickly purchased by the elite.\n\nBecause of the many years of economic and political chaos that had elapsed, Mexico was financially insolvent. In 1861 Juárez announced a suspension of payment on foreign loans, and the British, Spanish, and French occupied Veracruz to collect the Mexican debts. The British and Spanish quickly withdrew, but the French marched toward Mexico City. Despite being severely outnumbered and underarmed, the Mexican army won a major battle on May 5, 1862. That victory is celebrated as Cinco de Mayo, a national holiday. Nevertheless, France went on to overthrow the Mexican government and declare Mexico an empire with Maximilian I of Austria as emperor. Because of its own Civil War, the United States was unable to enforce its Monroe Doctrine, which prohibited European involvement in the Americas. At the close of the Civil War, however, the United States threatened to send troops into Mexico, and the French army withdrew from the country. The Mexicans executed Maximilian in 1867. Juárez returned to office and served until his death in 1872.\n\nThe Díaz Era\n\nAfter leading a successful revolt against the government, Porfirio Díaz became president in 1877. Except for four years, he ruled as an absolute dictator until 1910. During his regime Díaz encouraged foreign investment and attempted to modernize the country. He helped to increase the GDP fivefold. He expanded both exports and imports and saw gold and silver production increase from 25 million to 160 million dollars a year. Díaz also built more than 15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers) of railway.\n\nDíaz’ accomplishments were praised, but his popularity began to decline before the turn of the 20th century. He had surrounded himself with friends and cronies who gained economic and political power, leaving little opportunity for outsiders in the process. Working conditions both in the cities and on Mexico’s large rural estates remained poor. Education was still limited almost exclusively to elites in the larger cities. In addition, Díaz gave away huge concessions of land to friends and foreign speculators. By 1910 more than 95 percent of rural families had become landless—debt peons because of government expropriation of communally held farm villages. The inequitable distribution of wealth, combined with the government’s increasingly repressive tactics, made Mexico ripe for revolution.\n\nMexican Revolution and Its Aftermath\n\nFrancisco Madero, born into a wealthy mining and ranching family of northern Mexico, is credited with instigating the Mexican Revolution. Believing that Mexico’s social problems were a result of the long dictatorship, Madero ran against Díaz for the presidency in 1910. During the campaign he was arrested and jailed. After the fraudulent election, Madero led a revolutionary movement that in 1911 captured the isolated border city of Ciudad Juárez. An old man in ill health, Díaz was forced to resign. Madero was elected president on a platform promising social reform.\n\nMadero was idealistic but politically inept. As a result his presidency was short-lived and chaotic. Félix Díaz, Porfirio’s nephew, and General Victoriano Huerta joined together in a rebellion that ousted Madero. He and his vice president, Piño Suárez, were executed by the military in February 1913.\n\nHuerta became president, but counterrevolutions broke out in the north. They were led by General Venustiano Carranza, a follower of Madero and governor of Coahuila, with Pancho Villa and General Álvaro Obregón. Peasants in the south, disillusioned with Madero’s ineffectiveness, rallied behind the charismatic Indian revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. While the northern revolutionaries were largely interested in access to power, Zapata and his followers, the Zapatistas, demanded land and liberty for the peasantry.\n\nDuring the next few years disorder and chaos reigned. In 1914 the combined revolutionary forces unseated Huerta, but they then split over who was to become president. Zapata and Villa joined to fight Carranza’s forces, led by General Obregón. Carranza secured his position as provisional president when his army defeated Villa in 1915. Zapata was killed shortly after Carranza came to power, but his ideal of agrarian reform became a cornerstone of the revolution. Villa returned to Chihuahua and raided border towns in the southwestern United States to show that Carranza did not control northern Mexico. An attack on Columbus, New Mexico, killed a number of Americans. United States President Woodrow Wilson sent General John J. Pershing into Mexico to capture Villa, but he was unsuccessful.\n\nThe major accomplishment of the Carranza period was the constitution of 1917, which sought to destroy the feudalism that had existed in Mexico for 400 years. It established basic reforms in landownership, control of natural resources, and labor and social legislation. Nevertheless, when Carranza failed to move toward immediate social reforms, General Obregón led an armed rebellion in 1920. After Carranza was assassinated, Obregón ascended to the presidency. A strong individual, he was both willing and able to push through social reforms. His successor in 1924 was General Plutarco Elías Calles, a longtime political ally. Calles was vigorously antichurch and was also unfriendly to foreign capital investment. Only through diplomatic intervention was Calles persuaded to reopen churches that had closed and to become less hostile to the foreign governments he had alienated.\n\nObregón was elected to a second term in 1928 but was assassinated that same year. Calles, who had founded the National Revolutionary Party, the predecessor of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), filled the office of interim president with three successive puppet presidents. The party would dominate Mexican politics until the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe social and economic aims of the Mexican Revolution were paramount during the presidency of General Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–40). Cárdenas expelled Calles and developed a vigorous plan to modernize the country. He redistributed more land than did all of his predecessors combined, built rural schools, nationalized the petroleum industry, and strengthened the unions.\n\nCivilian Rule\n\nAfter World War II the military’s influence on Mexican politics faded, and the country had an unbroken line of civilian presidents. Mexico also experienced major economic development as industry, initially spurred by the war, became a major component of the economy. Miguel Alemán, president from 1946 to 1952, greatly accelerated industrial development and massive public-works projects. These included irrigation schemes in the northwest and hydroelectric power in the south. President José López Portillo (1976–82) directed the frantic economic growth that followed the discovery of huge oil reserves in 1976. Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado (1982–88) inherited an economy that had been transformed by a rapid decrease in international oil prices as well as huge foreign debts. He established a program of economic austerity that gradually restored confidence in the Mexican economy. However, many Mexicans blamed his administration for the slow pace of reconstruction after a powerful earthquake hit Mexico City in 1985.\n\nIn 1988 Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the PRI was elected president in a vote marred by charges of widespread fraud. Salinas sold hundreds of state-owned corporations to private investors and introduced a land reform bill that sought to privatize the ejidos, or collective farms. He also took steps to open the Mexican economy to foreign investment. In 1992 Salinas signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which reduced trade barriers between Mexico, the United States, and Canada when it went into effect in 1994. It was the broadest trade agreement ever reached between the three countries.\n\nOn the day that NAFTA took effect, a group known as the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), or the Zapatistas, began a rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas. Named in honor of Emiliano Zapata, the Indian revolutionary of the early 20th century, the Zapatistas demanded greater autonomy and political power for Mexico’s impoverished Indians. They timed their uprising to coincide with NAFTA because they believed that the agreement, along with Salinas’ land reform bill, would make the Indians’ living conditions even worse. The initial fighting left more than 140 people dead. Over the following years the government tried to end the rebellion with a mixture of military offensives and negotiations. The Zapatistas shifted away from armed conflict toward peaceful political action, including massive protests in Mexico City.\n\nMultiparty Democracy\n\nDuring the decades of one-party rule by the PRI, opposition parties grew slowly. As late as the 1980s, only the conservative National Action Party (PAN) was any kind of a threat to the PRI. But by the 1990s PAN and the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) had become significant political forces. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León of the PRI, elected president in 1994, introduced a number of reforms designed to end political corruption and create freer elections. Many of Zedillo’s reforms loosened the PRI’s grip on power. In 1997 opposition parties won several seats in municipal, state, and national elections, including control of the Chamber of Deputies. Nowhere was the changing political atmosphere more evident than in Mexico City, where PRD leader Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Solórzano won a landslide victory in the mayoral race.\n\nThe PRI’s 71-year control of the presidency ended in 2000 with an election that was widely hailed as the fairest in Mexican history. Vicente Fox of the PAN easily defeated PRI candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa. As president, Fox focused on improving trade relations with the United States, calming civil unrest in Chiapas and other areas, and reducing corruption, crime, and drug trafficking. He made some progress toward cooperation with the United States on immigration reform, though the United States resisted his calls for an open border between the two countries. Fox also took steps to strengthen the rights of Mexico’s indigenous peoples, but Zapatista leaders criticized his measures as too limited.\n\nThe PAN held on to the presidency in the 2006 election, though the results were controversial. The conservative PAN candidate, Felipe Calderón, faced Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the candidate of a leftist coalition. Both López Obrador and Calderón initially claimed victory in the close race, but Calderón was declared the winner. López Obrador challenged the results, claiming voting irregularities and fraud, and massive protests ensued. Nonetheless, Calderón was inaugurated in December 2006 and took power.\n\nDuring his term as president, Calderón passed legislation to reform Mexico’s judicial system. He also worked to strengthen the energy sector, to increase the number of jobs, and to fight crime and drug gangs called cartels. Calderón launched a “Drug War” against the cartels, but the country’s drug-related violence escalated to unprecedented levels as the cartels fought each other and the government. Tens of thousands of Mexicans were killed in drug violence during Calderón’s term. In addition, the Great Recession of 2008–09 devastated the economy of Mexico’s biggest trading partner, the United States. The Mexican economy suffered as a result. By 2010 Mexico’s economy had begun to bounce back, but the gap between rich and poor continued to widen.\n\nThe Drug War and the economy were the main issues in the presidential election of 2012. The PRI candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto, received the most votes, followed by López Obrador. Peña Nieto’s apparent victory was clouded, however, by accusations of widespread voting fraud. López Obrador refused to concede the election, and the Federal Electoral Institute ordered a partial recount of the votes. The recount confirmed Peña Nieto as the winner of the election.\n\nShortly after his inauguration as president, Peña Nieto announced a “Pact for Mexico.” This agreement joined the PRI, the PAN, and the PRD in support of a 95-point agenda of policy reform. Most notably, Peña Nieto’s administration sought to attract investment from foreign oil companies to revitalize the country’s declining oil and gas industry. The president also promised to fight the drug cartels aggressively. In 2014 authorities captured Joaquín (“El Chapo”) Guzmán Loera, the head of Mexico’s largest drug cartel, who had escaped from prison in 2001. Guzmán escaped again in 2015, though he was recaptured in early 2016. Government officials cited statistics indicating that drug-related violence was declining. However, murders, forced disappearances, kidnappings for ransom, and extortion remained serious problems. Many Mexicans blamed Peña Nieto for the country’s ongoing violence. Moreover, there were widespread accusations of government corruption and suspicion that the government was colluding with drug dealers.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2018, the candidates of both the PRI and the PAN lost. For nearly 90 years, every president of Mexico had come from one or the other of those two parties. Instead, in his third run for the presidency, López Obrador won in 2018 as the candidate of a leftist coalition. The leading political party in the coalition was the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), which López Obrador had founded in 2014. Pledging to fight corruption, López Obrador was elected president by a landslide. He also promised to reduce violence and to introduce programs to help the country’s poor.\n\nDuring his time as president, López Obrador made changes to try to help Mexico’s poorer citizens. He wanted to make things fairer for them in a system that had long been tilted toward the rich and powerful. His government made direct payments to tens of millions of Mexicans living in poverty. It also raised the minimum wage and changed some labor laws. However, the country’s economy was struggling, and violence and crime remained major problems.\n\nIn the presidential elections of 2024, Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate of López Obrador’s party, won by a large margin. She would be Mexico’s first woman president and its first Jewish president."
