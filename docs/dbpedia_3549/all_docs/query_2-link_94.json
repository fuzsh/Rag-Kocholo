        "text": "Long-distance overland travel has been historically important across the globe where groups of people and caravans of travellers, traders and pilgrims passing through rural areas have been the norm. Travellers need safe and hospitable places to obtain supplies, rest and information while moving across less familiar places. From Eurasian contexts, for instance, travel stopovers, including small countryside caravanserai (‘caravan hall’), were founded in rural areas on roads or paths between towns (Franklin & Boak Reference Franklin, Boak, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Johansen Reference Johansen2016; Shokoohy Reference Shokoohy1983). These small stopovers in peripheral areas consisted of settlements, structures for storage and sleeping, public spaces and water sources (Yavuz Reference Yavuz1997). Rural stopovers, like the caravanserai, have also been important for trade and their religious shrines for collective ceremonies. Importantly, the small rural stopovers frequently have fortifications, resting areas, storage, plazas for exchange and interaction, and religious buildings, which were important for travellers (Shokoohy Reference Shokoohy1983; Thareani-Sussely Reference Thareani-Sussely2007). While many stopovers continuously functioned as barracks for safe lodging (Nielson Reference Nielsen, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Nossov Reference Nossov2013), some eventually became small settlements due to their importance for trade, ritual, safety and social interaction among various groups traveling long distances across the countryside (Núñez & Briones Reference Núñez, Briones, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Palka Reference Palkain press). These sites are not ports, entrepots or secondary trading centres since they are not primary settlement or market nodes in a regional economy, nor do they have the demographic size, developed market-places and political connections with the population centres of ports (Alexander Reference Alexander, Kepecs and Alexander2005; Andrews Reference Andrews and Liendo Stuardo2008; Chapman Reference Chapman, Polanyi, Arensberg and Pearson1957; Franklin & Boak Reference Franklin, Boak, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Polanyi Reference Polanyi1963). Stopovers are placed along interior trade routes in rural areas and do not have the large amounts of diverse exotic goods of the trading ports (Clark Reference Clark2016). Stopovers also differ from pilgrimage centres (Palka Reference Palka2014) since they have more permanent habitation, fewer religious buildings, more storage facilities and more defensive capabilities. Stopovers are also larger and have bigger buildings and more permanent residents when compared to travellers’ camps, resting places and depots (Nielsen Reference Nielsen, Clarkson and Santoro2021). Small rural stopovers are more like way stations, outposts or caravanserais that were loosely connected through subsidiary routes to ports of trade and demographic centres in regional trade networks (Berenguer Reference Berenguer, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Edwards Reference Edwards, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Mader et al. Reference Mader, Reindel, Isla, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Nielsen Reference Nielsen, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Siveroni Reference Siveroni, Clarkson and Santoro2021). In colonial period Mesoamerica, some of these small indigenous rural sites with habitational structures and shrines became Spanish parajes, paradas and estancias maintained by local communities for travellers visiting markets, political centres and pilgrimage centres. These sites were located either on main roads or informal routes and paths (caminos, corredores, vías, senderos) across the realm (Bonilla Palmeros Reference Bonilla Palmeros2020; Lee & Navarrete Reference Lee and Navarrete1978; Long Towell & Attolini Lecón Reference Long Towell and Attolini Lecón2010). One such rural stopover at Late Postclassic to early historic (c. ad 1350–1650) Maya sites at Mensabak in Chiapas, Mexico, is discussed below in comparative context (Fig. 1). I construct a model for specific human behaviours at rural stopover sites that have archaeological correlates and anthropological significance.\n\nImportantly, the locations and material culture of rural stopovers make them archaeologically visible. Small rural stopover places have not been studied as often historically and archaeologically as larger trading ports, rural centres and pilgrimage shrines, but they can be examined with surveys and excavations by archaeologists conducting complete ground truthing in the countryside (Berenguer Reference Berenguer, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Erickson-Gini & Israel Reference Erickson-Gini and Israel2013; Jiménez Gómez Reference Jiménez Gómez, Long Towell and Attolini Lecón2010; Nielsen Reference Nielsen, Clarkson and Santoro2021; Palka Reference Palka2014). Historical accounts provide information regarding the locations, nature, economic structure and social implications of these interesting sites (Jiménez Gómez Reference Jiménez Gómez, Long Towell and Attolini Lecón2010; Morante López Reference Morante López, Long Towell and Attolini Lecón2010). However, we often lack detailed historical descriptions of the stopovers and life within them because chroniclers usually do not describe small rural settlements. Historical information on Maya travel routes and rural sites have been used to reconstruct regional interaction and economies (Caso Barrera Reference Caso Barrera2002; Feldman Reference Feldman2000; Woodfill Reference Woodfill2019), but we know less about stopover sites in countryside and lifeways there. Archaeology and comparative analyses help fill this informational gap. In this article, I place rural stopovers in an anthropological context and discuss salient human behaviours at these kinds of sites with the archaeological case study of Mensabak, Chiapas, Mexico."
