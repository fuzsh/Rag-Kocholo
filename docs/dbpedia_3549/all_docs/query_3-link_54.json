        "text": "MEXICO’S two southernmost states are Oaxaca and Chiapas, both mountainous and culturally distinctive.\n\nThe uplands that make up most of each of these two states are divided from each other by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which runs like a valley between them for 192 km from Coatzacoalcos, on the Caribbean, to Juchitán de Zaragoza in eastern Oaxaca.\n\nThe Mexican Government plans to develop the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as an alternative to the Panamá Canal. While the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is too wide for a canal, and too high at its highest point of 224 m (735 feet) as well, loading and unloading containers onto a railway at either end would be quite practical these days.\n\nI planned to explore both of these states, of which Chiapas has the distinction of including the very southernmost point in Mexico, not far from the Guatemalan city Quetzaltenango, which I had visited nearly three weeks before."
