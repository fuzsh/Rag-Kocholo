In honor of Dan Healan, who devoted his life’s work to this theme, several notable scholars present novel research to reconstruct how households produced and exchanged goods; how they carried out private and public rituals; how they built their residences and neighborhoods; organized their towns and cities; earned a living; observed the stars; and even fomented resistance within the powerful Maya, Aztec, Tarascan, Toltec, and Zapotec states.\n\nXV+259 pages; 121 figures; 26 tables; index.\n\nISBN 978-0-9842028-2-9\n\nArchaeological Reconnaissance in Eastern Campeche, Mexico\n\nPublication 73, Archaeological Reconnaissance in Eastern Campeche, Mexico: Chactun, Tamchen, and Lagunita\n\nAuthor(s): Ivan Šprajc (editor)\n\nDate: 2021\n\nPurchase Here: MARI Store\n\nThis edited volume summarizes recent research and archaeological investigations at the Maya sites of Chactun, Tamchen, and Lagunita, Campeche, Mexico, located in an area previously little-known to researchers. Situated between the Chenes architectural region to the north, and the Río Bec region to the south, this intermediate zone shares many features of the surrounding areas, but there is also evidence that suggests affinities with more distant regions. Data from aerial photographs and lidar mapping reveal a densely occupied and highly modified landscape. The volume includes site descriptions, a discussion of the zoomorphic façade at Lagunita, an analysis of the sites’ ceramics, documentation of stelae and altars, and examination of a possible ceremonial offering. The book features extensive photos and illustrations, including 28 beautiful color plates.\n\nXVIII+146 pages; 5 maps; 169 figures; 1 table; appendices; index.\n\nISBN 978-0-9718878-0-0\n\nOccasional Papers\n\nPronominal Inflection in the Mayan Languages\n\nOccasional Paper 1, Pronominal Inflection in the Mayan Languages 1977\n\nAuthor(s): Victoria Reifler Bricker\n\nDate: 1977\n\nPurchase Here: MARI Store\n\n28 pp., 2 figs., 9 tables.\n\nISBN 0-939238-54-3\n\nLithic Artifacts from a Complex Society\n\nOccasional Paper 2, Lithic Artifacts from a Complex Society: The Chipped Stone Tools of Becan, Campeche, Mexico\n\nAuthor(s): James B.
