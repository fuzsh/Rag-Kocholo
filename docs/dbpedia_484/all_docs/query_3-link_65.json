        "text": "Don't miss the doubleheader this Saturday, April 12th, live on HBO. In the main event, a welterweight title will be at stake as rising star WBA welterweight champion Miguel Cotto takes on Alfonso Gomez in a scheduled 12-round contest. The opening bout should be just as explosive as IBF welterweight champ Kermit Cintron battles former champion Antonio Margarito in an intriguing rematch.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN...\n\nIn the case of the undercard, redemption for starters, and that applies to both guys. Margarito took Killer Kerm's \"0\" and Cintron wants payback. This was the fight Cintron wanted all along. He is confident and has the thought of avenging his lone loss on his mind. The first go around, he was beaten and left crying in the ring. A complete reversal of fortune is the only way to get that monkey off his back.\n\nRedemption is the key for Margarito as well because he's struggling to get past his hard fought loss to Paul Williams last July. The naysayers quieted down until Williams was upset by Carlos Quintana in February. Once again, that loss became a talking point for many fans. A repeat of the beatdown administered the first time around would likely silence the critics, at least for the time being, and net Margarito the IBF strap,.\n\nThere is something else at stake here, however, and that is a crack at WBA welterweight champion Miguel Cotto, assuming he does as expected and takes care of Alfonso Gomez in the main event of this card. A fight with Cotto would bring good money and great exposure, putting the winner here is in a great spot. The loser, on the other hand, could be in the worst spot of all with no path to speak of. The chances of getting future big fights would be slim.\n\nFor Cotto, this fight with Gomez is nothing more then a stay busy fight. It is an intended soft touch after a rigorous year that saw him assemble one heck of a resume at welterweight in a short period of time. The goal here is to stay sharp, avoid injury and set up a big July showdown with either the winner of the undercard fight or possibly Ricardo Mayorga. Gomez was chosen because he has name recognition and doesn't do anything Cotto hasn't seen before.\n\nThat said, this fight means the world to Alfonso Gomez. Being that he came from The Contender brand name, people tend to overlook his progress and underrate his abilities. He is fighting for credibility in the boxing world because he still doesn't have it. Even though he thrashed Arturo Gatti last July and fought through a hand injury to decision Ben Tackie, credibility has remained elusive.\n\nWHEN THE BELL RINGS...\n\nBoth Margarito and Cintron will win with their offense and won't spend a lot of time focusing on their defense. Margarito has heavy hands, a high workrate, terrific stamina and a rock-solid head. His plan is simple: pressure the opponent and beat them down in the process, regardless of what is coming back. Cintron has big one-punch power at welterweight. He works off of a range-finding jab and has solid stamina, but with that comes a breakable will and a decent, but not great chin. His plan revolves around keeping his opponents at the end of his jab so he can get full extension on his right hand.\n\nIt would seem that the only way to temper Margarito's workrate is to outwork him, ala Paul Williams. Conversely, Cintron has shown a tendency to languish on the inside if you put enough pressure on him. Jesse Feliciano was able to get Killer Kerm to fight his fight, as did David Estrada. Fortunately for Cintron, neither one of those guys punched particularly hard or had a whole lot to offer on offense.\n\nStylistically, this fight really comes down to how well Cintron can fight side-stepping and backing up at times, as well as how precise and consistent he can be with his jab. Margarito is going to walk him down from the opening bell until the fight ends. Languishing is not an option here and we know Manny Steward does not want a fire fight so focus, by Cintron, is the key. Margarito is going to be, wellÂ Margarito. No big mystery what his goal is. As long as his chin is still as sturdy as can be, he is coming to fight.\n\nIn the main event, things would appear to be extremely cut and dry, but I am not so sure they will be. Cotto has better power than Gomez, better technique, a better pedigree and a better resume. There is no disputing any of that and the disparity is significant. But I go back to the fact that Gomez tends to be a little underrated and this fight really means a lot to him. He has shown the ability to vary his gameplan, he has a ton of heart and he continues to improve. Add to that the fact that he has been in the ring and had success at middleweight with fighters who now fight at 168 pounds and I think we have a tougher opponent here than many may think.\n\nCotto has never shown a lack of interest in getting his hands dirty in there so that shouldn't be an issue, butÂ and this is a big but, many times when fighters get a soft touch that end up not being so soft, they struggle a bit because they never planned on getting their hands dirty in the first place. In other words, don't expect Gomez to get completely blown out here.\n\nTHE CALL...\n\nSo what's going to happen?\n\nWell, knowing what Cintron will need to do to win, I just stuggle to see how he will. The first time around, Cintron landed his money punch right on the button and Margarito smiled, nodded, and kept walking forward. For all intents and purposes, the fight was over right there. If focus is the \"key\" for Cintron, a pressure fighter like Margarito is the \"lock\" it won't open. Look for Killer Kerm to have some success early, but before long, he will grow a bit tentative and his inability to fight going backwards even a little will do him in. Expect Margarito to grind away and take Cintron out somewhere around the 9th round while ahead on all cards.\n\nIn the CottoÂGomez fight, look for Alfonso Gomez to make a good account of himself here, especially if any of the rumored trainer issues for Cotto are true. I expect Gomez to make Cotto work a lot harder than people expect and even anticipate that he will have occasional success in there. I just see his willingness to exchange being the difference between losing a decision and getting stopped late in the fight. Give me Cotto by stoppage in the 10th in a fight that surprises for it's entertainment value and elevates Alfonso Gomez in the process.\n\nBONUS PICKS...\n\nChad Dawson is coming of age and what better opponent to showcase that than Glen Johnson? I like Dawson by close decision in a tough fight. Johnson is going to make him work and I think Dawson will be good enough to answer any questions. I expect a close, but unanimous decision here.\n\nIn the main event, look for a slight upset. I expect Clinton Woods to outwork Antonio Tarver over 12 rounds. Tarver's legs are near gone and Woods is going to bring the fight to him all night. Woods isn't a big puncher, but he's a consistent puncher who likes to make you mix it up with him. Woods by majority decision is the call."
