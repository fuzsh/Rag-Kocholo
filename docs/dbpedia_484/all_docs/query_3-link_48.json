Start dropping them a bit more and defend with your face\"\n\nOnly joking\n\nGood luck to him\n\nA lot of cornermen are very charismatic so he should have that bit sorted already\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby horizontalhero Tue 08 Nov 2011, 12:49 am\n\nIt will be interesting to see. It quite often seems to be the way that the old adage that those that can't teach is true. If you are naturally very good at something, and it comes easy to you, it can be difficult and frustrating to try and teach it to someone that finds it more difficult. A guy like Roach was a fairly average boxer, but a great teacher, likewise the great Eddy Futch was a better coach than fighter.\n\nThat said I reckon that Ricky will make a good cornerman-he'll be a good motivator, and have the right level of compassion for his fighter- can't see him allowing someone to take a beating for the sake of it.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby captain carrantuohil Tue 08 Nov 2011, 8:04 am\n\nGood motivator, possibly. Good trainer - I'm not so sure. I don't know why, but this puts me in mind of that fateful decision of Kettering Town to hand the managerial reins to Paul Gascoigne for 39 days. I don't see how someone who was notorious for his indiscipline outside the field of combat can be expected to impose order on those under his tutelage. I'll be interested to see how Ricky handles it.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby AlexHuckerby Tue 08 Nov 2011, 8:06 am\n\nmaybe a tad harsh lets not forget when hatton was in a training camp he worked incredibly hard.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby captain carrantuohil Tue 08 Nov 2011, 8:08 am\n\nTraining is a full-time occupation, Alex. Hatton is going to be expected to say \"do as I say, not as I did.\" He can't just be one of the boys to succeed in this job, and I wonder whether he will be temperamentally suited to the role.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby bhb001 Tue 08 Nov 2011, 8:12 am\n\nI can't see this being a success with the Gascoigne example summing it up perfectly for me. He needs to stick to after dinner speaking, which I believe he is a natural at\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby AlexHuckerby Tue 08 Nov 2011, 8:45 am\n\nafter kebab speaking you mean?\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby superflyweight Tue 08 Nov 2011, 9:48 am\n\nThe captain makes a fair point, Hatton's going to find it tough to not be one of the boys and impose discipline.\n\nThat aside, hard to say whether or not he'll make a decent trainer or not as, like football managers, there doesn't seem to be an exact science in picking who is going to be good at it or not. However, I will be very surprised if he makes a success of it over a sustained period of time. I tihnk Ricky would be better suited putting his name to a gym and being the name that attracts sponsors and investors rather than being on the front line training fighters.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby AlexHuckerby Tue 08 Nov 2011, 9:58 am\n\nhe did talk about it being the happiest he had been since he quit fightingt also.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby The Galveston Giant Tue 08 Nov 2011, 10:06 am\n\nI can't see Ricky doing too great to be honest, never heard much about Billy Graham, wonder what he's up to these days.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby compelling and rich Tue 08 Nov 2011, 10:48 am\n\ncapatin make one points about why he might not make it, my other worry would be teaching other ways than he fought him self. ricky never had the ability to swap and change his tactics aswell as some and could see all his training being down the line of pressure fighting like himself whether your suited or not.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby The Galveston Giant Tue 08 Nov 2011, 11:43 am\n\nI don't think Hatton ever had enough technical skills to pass on, for instance what kind of tips advice can he give about jabbing, defense etc. It's alright if he has a brawler, but how does he train a technical boxer.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby Guest Tue 08 Nov 2011, 11:48 am\n\nPeople forget that Hatton could box when he chose to, it's just that as his career progressed and especially after he beat Kostya, he abandoned that aspect in favour of a more crowd pleasing style.\n\nHis best boxing performance would possibly be against Ben Tackie when he ws controlled and disciplined throughout.\n\nIt will be fun watching Ricky shadow boxing at ringside though.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby 88Chris05 Tue 08 Nov 2011, 12:15 pm\n\nPart of me has always suspected that Hatton's desire to train now that his career is over is simply a product of him not being able to sit still for more than ten minutes, personally. I'm not all that sure he'd take it seriously enough to be a real success in it, and as others have already said, can a man so famous for his lack of discipline between fights really drive it home in another fighter?\n\nStill, it will be interesting to say the least. My gut feeling is that promoting, rather than training, should be Hatton's primary focus from now on, but we shouldn't write him off just yet, I suppose.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby AlexHuckerby Tue 08 Nov 2011, 12:34 pm\n\nhe basically said that promoting wasnt fulfilling enough.\n\nto be fair just because didnt really adapt a lot of skill in his own boxing doesnt mean that he cant teach those skills.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby huw Tue 08 Nov 2011, 1:17 pm\n\nFor what it's worth, if dedicated I think he could be very good.\n\nHe wasn't the most skilled fighter and worked very hard to get in shape (due to the fact he had gotten so out of shape!).\n\nThink he could possibly get his fighters passionate, in good shape and with very good basics.\n\nThe biggest test to him becoming a great trainer is whether he can read an opposition fighter enough to come up with a game plan or chagne things when plan A isn't working.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby Josiah Maiestas Tue 08 Nov 2011, 1:24 pm\n\nto be fair just because didnt really adapt a lot of skill in his own boxing doesnt mean that he cant teach those skills.\n\nBut he was still a top fighter for his weight division. I honestly don't think he will be very successful as a trainer; his character will impose too much on young fighters and they will have little say on how to go about their tactics.\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby AlexHuckerby Tue 08 Nov 2011, 1:25 pm\n\nYeah and to his credit Huw whenever I've seen him on ringside etc. He seems to have a very good understanding of things and seems to have a good grasp. Let's not forget as to how long he was a boxer himself, you do pick up a few things in those times, and a 2 weight world champion to boot and fought the top 2 fighters of our era (Albeit ended very badly) so you know, I reckon all the technical knowledge should really be fine.\n\nThe only concerns that I have is if he doesn't know how to control his fighter and not be too pally with him, that being said, Adam Booth and David Haye - George Groves seem very pally, so maybe that method can work with the right fighters.\n\nA lot of it does depend on how dedicated the fighters themselves are, though the ones that are a bit more loose he might not be able to put the reigns on them, but all in all I think he will be ok, a lot of it depends on who walks through your door to be fair...\n\nRe: Ricky Hatton Becomes A Trainer\n\nby AlexHuckerby Tue 08 Nov 2011, 1:26 pm\n\nJosiah Maiestas wrote:\n\nto be fair just because didnt really adapt a lot of skill in his own boxing doesnt mean that he cant teach those skills.\n\nBut he was still a top fighter for his weight division.
