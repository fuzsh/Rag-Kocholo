        "text": "Introduction When seeking to position newly-independent Ghana as a non-aligned African nation-state in the midst of the Cold War, Kwame Nkrumah would frequently use the populist refrain, &quot;we face neither East nor West: We face forward&quot; at political rallies and in public speeches, such as that delivered at the Positive Action Conference for Peace and Security in Africa, held in Accra on 2 April 1960. (1) Ghana, however, like other newly independent nation states in Africa, and indeed other countries in the Third World with strong nationalist leaders, could not escape the political, cultural, military, and economic ramifications of the ideological battle between the United States and the Soviet Union in the post-World War II era. This article analyzes the complementary, yet competing demands of nationalism or nation-building, Pan-Africanism, and internationalism during Kwame Nkrumah&#39;s nine years in office as Prime Minister and later President of Ghana from March 1957 to ...\n\nThis book examines Ghana’s Pan-African foreign policy during Nkrumah’s rule, investigating how Ghanaians sought to influence the ideologies of African liberation movements through the Bureau of African Affairs, the African Affairs Centre and the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute. In a world of competing ideologies, when African nationalism was taking shape through trial and error, Nkrumah offered Nkrumaism as a truly African answer to colonialism, neo-colonialism and the rapacity of the Cold War powers. Although virtually no liberation movement followed the precepts of Nkrumaism to the letter, many adapted the principles and organizational methods learnt in Ghana to their own struggles. Drawing upon a significant set of primary sources and on oral testimonies from Ghanaian civil servants, politicians and diplomats as well as African freedom fighters, this book offers new angles for understanding the history of the Cold War, national liberation and nation-building in Africa.\n\nThe article describes the Bureau of African Affairs Collection. First it introduces the history of the archive by examining the crucial events that influenced its state and accessibility. Then, it describes the contents of the collection, underlying its importance for the study of Kwame Nkrumah’s domestic and foreign policies and African nationalism at a continental level. The documents included in the Bureau of African Affairs Collection provide unique insights into both Nkrumah’s foreign and domestic policies. In particular, they include invaluable information on his Pan-African policy. Moreover, the documents shed new light on the presence of African liberation movements in Ghana in the period 1957 to 1966. Thus, this Collection can attract scholars interested in both Ghanaian history as well as the history of Pan-Africanism and African nationalism at a continental level.\n\nKwame Nkrumah was one of the most important figures of the post WW II anti-colonial liberation movement that ended direct European rule in Africa and established independent republics in their place. Nkrumah led the Gold Coast to independence in 1957 through the vehicle of the Convention People's Party, a mass organization which he founded in 1949 and which under his leadership carried out a dramatic campaign of nonviolent \"positive action\" to pressure the British to grant independence. Nkrumah was not only an activist, but a writer and popularizer of anti-colonial ideas as well. He produced a torrent of books outlining his political perspectives that further cemented his legacy as an opponent of imperialism and colonialism. With titles such as Revolutionary Path, Neo-Colonialism, Dark Days in Ghana, Challenge of the Congo, Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare and Class Struggle in Africa, Nkrumah built an ideological legacy which occupies a prominent position in the pantheon of African anti-colonial revolutionaries. However, events in Ghana were not the anti-colonial success story that many have come to believe, nor as simple and clean cut as the official version, put forward by Nkrumah and his supporters, of a progressive anti-imperialist movement crushed by a CIA-sponsored coup. In its quest for power, Nkrumah's pre-independence government made a number of unprincipled and opportunistic arrangements with the British that had the effect of condemning Ghana to exactly the kind of neocolonial economic relations that Nkrumah constantly critiqued. Despite a tremendous radicalization and movement of the Ghanaian people showing their own ability to transform society, Nkrumah insisted upon following top down and parliamentarian methods of struggle that made any real social transformation or committed struggle against imperialism impossible. Nkrumah, despite all the Marxist verbiage he deployed in his writings, put very little of this rhetoric into practice after he had used it to build a powerful mass party and come to a position of strength to negotiate terms with the British.\n\nThis dissertation contributes to the study of Nkrumah’s Pan-African policy by examining the role played by three Ghanaian institutions specifically created to support African liberation and unity: the Bureau of African Affairs, the African Affairs Centre, and the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute of Winneba.Between 1957 and 1966, these institutions have worked for supporting African liberation movements both in Ghana and on the battlefields. Moreover, they contributed to spread Pan-Africanism and Nkrumahism in the whole continent.After the recovery of important new sources, the author has been able to adopt Accra’s own perspective on the question and to provide an insight into the daily activities of the three institutions examining the impact of their activity on African liberation movements and on the Ghanaian state."
