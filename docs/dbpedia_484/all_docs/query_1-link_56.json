        "text": "TSZYU FACT FILE\n\nBorn: 19/09/1969\n\nTurned pro: 1992\n\nDivision: Light welterweight\n\nRecord: 31(25)-2\n\nAlias: Thunder From Down Under\n\nHeight: 5ft 7in\n\nReach: 67in\n\nTrainer: Johnny Lewis\n\nPromoter: Matthew Watt\n\nMake no mistake, Kostya Tszyu's shock loss to Ricky Hatton does not crush his legacy.\n\nAs the old cliche goes, the 35-year-old Russian-born Australian \"grew old in the ring\" on Sunday, quitting on his stool after round 11.\n\nBut even if he never boxes again, Tszyu has had a distinguished career.\n\nHis destruction of Sharmba Mitchell like some bothersome fly was the most shocking sight in boxing last year.\n\nMitchell, a former world champion, was still considered a major player in the light welterweight ranks.\n\nAnd Tszyu, coming off a 22-month lay-off, floored Mitchell four times before the fight was stopped in the third round.\n\nThe \"Thunder from Down Under\" had proved he was still rumbling loud and still one of the finest pound-for-pound boxers in the game.\n\nThat is, until Hatton had his say.\n\nTszyu was born in the Russian industrial city of Serov but moved to Australia at the age of 20.\n\nHe turned professional in 1992 and claimed the IBF light welterweight belt in only his 14th fight courtesy of a sixth-round stoppage of tough Puerto Rican Jake Rodriguez.\n\nTszyu made his first defence against another former world champion, the gnarled Roger Mayweather, and made four more defences before being upset by Vince Phillips in Atlantic City in 1997.\n\nKEY FIGHTS\n\n28/01/95: v Jake Rodriguez\n\nTKO6, wins IBF title\n\n31/05/97: v Vince Phillips\n\nTKO7, loses IBF title\n\n21/08/99: v M.A Gonzalez\n\nTKO10, wins WBC title\n\n29/07/00: v J C Chavez\n\nTKO6, retains WBC title\n\n03/11/01: v Zab Judah\n\nTKO2, retains undisputed title\n\n06/11/04: v Sharmba Mitchell\n\nTKO3, retains IBF title\n\n05/06/05 v Hatton\n\nL TKO11, loses IBF title at Manchester's MEN Arena\n\nTszyu dusted himself down, clawed his way back into contention and in August 1999 battered Mexican great Miguel Angel Gonzalez into submission inside 10 rounds to claim the WBC crown.\n\nA year later, he stopped the legendary Julio Cesar Chavez in six rounds and had to escape from the ring and the attentions of 15,000 Mexican fans before the decision could be announced.\n\nIn 2001, Tszyu became undisputed light welterweight champion with a breathtaking two-round destruction of undefeated IBF champion Zab Judah.\n\nHe defended against tough Ghanaian Ben Tackie and Jesse James Leija before a shoulder injury put him out of commission for almost two years.\n\nAnd last November came his glorious return against Mitchell - and proof that the sickening right hand, not to mention all the other tools, was still in the box.\n\nTszyu was lured to Hatton's backyard by a Â£3m fee.\n\nThe cost of the subsequent loss to his career may be great, but his skills will long be remembered by boxing's cognoscenti."
