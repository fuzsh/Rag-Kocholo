        "text": "September 11 1997\n\nFight No1 of 42 v Colin McAuley\n\nAn 18-year-old Hatton wins by technical knockout in the first of four scheduled rounds on his professional debut at Kingsway Leisure Centre in Widnes. Demonstrates the punching power that would become his trademark by breaking McAuley's ribs and putting him out of the ring for two months. Confirms his potential by beating the New Yorker Robert Alvarez on his home turf of Madison Square Garden in his next bout.\n\nOctober 21 2000\n\nFight No22 v Jonathan Thaxton\n\nOutpoints Thaxton, then a dangerous puncher from Brendan Ingle's gym in Sheffield, at Wembley Conference Centre to win the British light welterweight title. Hatton comes into the fight undefeated in his first 21 contests and on the back of a fifth-round stoppage victory over the Italian Giuseppe Lauri but Thaxton proves a tough adversaries. Badly cut early in the contest, Hatton has to be thankful the bout was not stopped. His vision is impaired by the bleeding but he shows fighting spirit to win the fight but later needs plastic surgery.\n\nJune 1 2002\n\nFight No29 Eamonn Magee Outpoints Magee at the MEN Arena to retain his WBU title for a sixth time. The Irish southpaw Magee, a high-quality counter-puncher, floors Hatton for the first time in his career in the opening round to raise the possibility of an upset. But Hatton shows his increasing maturity by abandoning all-out aggression to box his way to a unanimous points verdict with Magee unable to repeat his early success.\n\nDecember 13 2003\n\nFight No34 v Ben Tackie\n\nSteps up in class to defend his WBU title for an 11th time against the highly rated Tackie of Ghana. Tackie, a feared puncher, is never able to find his range effectively at the MEN Arena in Manchester as Hatton produces an excellent boxing performance. Two judges give Hatton the verdict by an 11-point margin, with the third giving him an eight-point advantage. Hatton says afterwards it is his best win and he has arrived as a genuine world-class fighter.\n\nJune 4 2005\n\nFight No39 v Kostya Tszyu After 15 defences of his WBU crown Hatton defeats the Russian-born Australian Tszyu, who is retired by his corner after 11 rounds of an epic battle - again at the MEN Arena. The sell-out crowd of 22,000 roars on the home favourite in a fight staged at 3am to cater for US television. Hatton's superior fitness,right, gives him the advantage after halfway and he wins Tszyu's IBF title. It is the finest performance of Hatton's career.\n\nJanuary 20 2007"
