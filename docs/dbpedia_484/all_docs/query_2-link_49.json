        "text": "Britain's former two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton has announced his retirement from boxing in a media briefing today.\n\nThe 32-year-old had been linked with several big-name fighters since his last fight, a defeat to Manny Pacquaio, two years ago.\n\nA rematch with Pacquiao and a meeting with Floyd Mayweather Jr were mentioned but Hatton has decided to call time on a glittering 14-year professional career.\n\nThe Stockport-born fighter explained why decided to hang up his gloves after two years out of the sport in a media lunch in London this afternoon.\n\nHolding back the tears, Hatton said: \"I am very upset. It's a very sad day for me.\n\n\"I know it is the right decision though. I've known it was the right thing to do for 18 months to be honest.\n\n\"It's a bit of a relief to finally do it. It's been hovering over my head for such a long time.\n\n\"These last two years have been really frustrating. I hit rock bottom and it almost drove me insane.\n\n\"There's nothing more I love than training for a fight but I have no dreams left now.\"\n\nThe decision to retire signals the end of a dramatic and entertaining career that has seen Hatton achieve success at welterweight and light-welterweight level.\n\nHe beat Jon Thaxton to take the British light-welterweight title in 2000 and went on to dominate the division, with his most notable victory at that weight coming in 2005 against IBF champion Kostya Tszyu.\n\nHatton then beat Carlos Maussa before moving up to welterweight, where he defeated Luis Collazo to claim the WBA world title.\n\nRapidly earning a reputation as one of Britain's most popular sportsmen, he went on to challenge Mayweather in Las Vegas.\n\nBilled as the defining fight of his career, watched by millions around the world, Hatton failed to take the American's WBC welterweight title after being knocked out in the 10th round.\n\nUndeterred by his first loss in boxing, Hatton returned to winning ways with victories over Juan Lazcano and Paulie Malignaggi before calling out pound-for-pound champion Pacquiao.\n\nThe two met at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in May 2009, when Hatton was knocked out cold in the second round to leave the Mancunian with a 45-2, 32KOs record.\n\nSince his defeat against Pacquiao Hatton has fended off rumours of a rematch with Mayweather and Pacquiao whilst a clash with fellow Briton Amir Khan has also been mooted.\n\nHatton's career took a turn for the worse last September when he was stripped of his boxing licence after he was filmed allegedly snorting drugs.\n\nThe amiable fighter checked himself in to the Priory for treatment and has often talked about how he fears he may struggle to cope with life after boxing, but he is confident he will be able to channel his energies into his promotions company, which includes his brother Matthew among its fighters.\n\n\"It's not been easy for me but I'm confident I'll be able to stay on the straight and narrow,\" Hatton said.\n\n5 key fights\n\nv Jon Thaxton, October 21, 2000\n\nHatton showed commendable spirit against the big-punching Norwich man, battling his way to a points victory despite a serious early cut over his left eye which would later require 28 stitches.\n\nv Ben Tackie, December 13, 2003\n\nHatton summoned up a masterful boxing performance to secure a landslide points win over the rock-hard former world title contender, producing some of the finest footwork and variety of his career.\n\nv Kostya Tszyu, June 4, 2005\n\nHatton's defining night as he turned on the style in the early hours in Manchester to dethrone the legendary former champion, who was behind on the scorecards when he failed to answer the bell for the final round.\n\nv Carlos Maussa, November 26, 2005\n\nOne of Hatton's most under-rated performances as he survived an early cut against the unorthodox Colombian to unify the 140lb titles with a devastating left hook in the ninth round.\n\nv Jose Luis Castillo, June 23, 2007\n\nHatton's gateway fight to superstardom ended in dramatic fashion when he landed a savage fourth-round liver shot to dump the Mexican great on the canvas and underline his credentials for a shot at Floyd Mayweather."
