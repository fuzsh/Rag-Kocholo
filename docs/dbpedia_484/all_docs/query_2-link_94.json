Kerry Kayes, Ricky Hatton's dietician and nutritionist expert, commented on Hatton's website that: \"Ricky has on his back what's known in the body-building world as a 'Christmas Tree'. It's the definition of muscles off the spine of his back, it's the first time they have ever been noticeable and testament to the hard work he has put in.\"\n\nAs at that fight Hatton had a record of 39-0 in the light welterweight division. Billy Graham has said of Hatton: \"Ricky's always telling jokes, but in the ring he's cold, merciless and an awful man.\"\n\nRicky Hatton is known for his close-quarters style and fierce body punching.\n\nIn November 2005 Hatton unified the IBF title, which he already held, and the WBA light welterweight title with a ninth-round knockout of Carlos Maussa.
