He said apart from Guinness, the GFA is also holding similar talks with other companies to save the league from \"collapsing.\"\n\nMr Koufie said this when the company presented a cheque for 165 million cedis to the GFA towards this weekend's gala, which is to usher in the 2002 league season. \"If you open the door, it is only fair that you close it too\", Mr Koufie told the media, inferring that since Guinness would usher in the soccer season it would be proper if they sponsor the league as well.\n\nGhana Brewery Limited, withdrew its 800 million-cedis sponsorship from the GFA due to dwindling profit. Be Koufie said Guinness has been the oldest sponsor of the GFA and said it would be appropriate if they took over the league.\n\nGRi /\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nHearts moves camp to Ho\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 15 March 2002 - Champion Club Accra Hearts of Oak on Thursday, left Accra for Ho to continue their preparation towards the Second leg of their African Cup club Championship against Stade Malien in Mali.\n\nThe team left Accra around 5.00 pm after the afternoon's training session at the Accra Sports Stadium and would camp at Ho till they enplane to Mali next week. After the pulsating 1-1 draw with the Malian opponents at the Accra Sports Stadium last Sunday, training schedule was changed from between 4 pm - 6 pm to 1 pm  4 pm daily because of the hot climate in Mali.\n\nMr Herbert Addo the new Technical Director of the club told the GNA Sports that, the hot climate in Mali is similar to that of Ho and this would help them to acclimatise well for the second leg. He said the players are not having enough concentration when training in Accra, hence the decision to move the team to Ho to ensure that the players are put in the right frame of mind.\n\nMr Addo expressed confidence that the team is capable of causing surprise in Mali as they had intensified their preparation towards the second leg. The club, first shifted its training from their traditional training grounds to the Accra Sports Stadium just after their encounter with the Malians recently but had to change to Ho after training once at the Stadium.\n\nIn another development, Yaw Amankwah Mireku, one of the key defenders in the team has reported for training after his long absence from the team. Amankwah, who started training on Thursday afternoon told GNA Sports that he was convinced by the Management Board of the team to start training even though he has not settled his problem with the team.\n\nHe however expressed the hope that every problem would be solved in due course as they prepare to face Stade Malien in Mali next Sunday. Amankwah refused to attend training when he returned from the just ended African Cup of Nations in Mali where he featured for the Black Stars, due to contractual problems he had with the management.\n\nHe was a regular player in the team, which won the African Cup Champions League in the year 2000 for the first time for Hearts and remained one of the consistent players for the team for the past four years. Amankwah's call up to the team is part of the management's effort to beef up the team before they travel to Mali as he did not feature in the first leg.\n\nGRi /\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nDan Oppong recovers, likely to play in Mali\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 15 March 2002 - Dan Oppong, one of Hearts of Oak's strong rear guards who missed the first leg 1/16 stage match of the CAF Champions League between his club and Stade Malien due to an injury, is now likely to feature in the return leg in Mali next Sunday.\n\nOppong has recovered from the injury he sustained on March 6, in the final match of the GHALCA Top Four between Accra Hearts of Oak and Liberty Professionals at the Accra Sports Stadium. When the GNA Sports visited the Accra Sports Stadium on Thursday, the player who travelled to Sunyani for herbal treatment had joined his colleagues for a physical exercise.\n\nHe told the GNA that that he was fit and ready to play. \"I can now run and pray that I would recover fully for the next encounter in Mali.\" Oppong said he was disappointed with the one all score line in the first leg adding that Hearts was capable of surprising the Malians next Sunday.\n\nHe said, morale was high in camp and his colleagues were all gearing up for the next battle. The player urged all Hearts fans to rally behind the club and continue to pray for them because the task ahead will be tough. Dan Oppong joined Hearts from Brong Ahafo United last season and has become one of the regular defenders of the club.\n\nGRi /\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\n12th Annual Central athletic championship opens\n\nCape Coast (Central Region) 15 March 2002 - The Central Regional Minister, Mr Isaac Edumadze on Thursday asked students to work hard to reach the heights of great sportsmen in the country. He regretted that most of our young sportsmen and women do not take their basic or elementary training seriously and when the desired results are not attained they tend to apportion blame on others.\n\nThese were contained in an address read on his behalf at the opening of the 12th annual Central Regional athletic championship at the regional schools and colleges park at Adisadel, Cape Coast Fifty senior secondary schools are participating in the two-day athletics competition. He told the athletes that good performances and good character are bedfellows and are inseparable and urged them not to get involved in drugs and alcoholism since they are harmful to their health.\n\nMr Edumadze who was not happy with the progress of work on the construction of the regional schools and colleges park appealed to heads of schools to ensure that the park fees approved by the Ghana Education Service are paid to ensure early completion of work on the park. Mr Muniru Arafat Nuhu, Cape Coast municipal chief executive, who deputised for the regional minister later declared the competition opened.\n\nGRi /\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nGhana to host Queens jubilee baton relay on March 30\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 15 March 2002 - Ghana would host the sixth stage of the Queen Elizabeth Jubilee baton relay on Saturday, March 30. A release from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London made available to the GNA Sports said the jubilee baton relay is part of Her Majesty's attempt to foster \"a feeling of inclusion and unity in the commonwealth.\"\n\nThe baton, which left the Buckingham Palace on March 11 on its international route would take 50 days to pass through 22 Commonwealth countries before returning to the United Kingdom for the final leg. The relay would eventually end its exciting travels in the City of Manchester Stadium at the opening ceremony of the 17th Commonwealth Games on July 25, where Her Majesty would read a message to the watching Commonwealth.\n\nHer Majesty's message would be held in an aluminium capsule, inserted into the top of the baton, which would be released by pressing down and turning a cap. The relay's futuristic baton is made of \"machined aluminium\" and has a conductive handle, which has sensors to detect and monitor the pulse rate of those who are lucky to handle it. From Ghana the baton would go through six other African countries including Nigeria, South Africa and war ravaged Sierra Leone before ending its global leg in Malta on June 1.\n\nGRi /\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nWonder Tackie predicts 5th round knockout over Tszyu\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 15 March 2002 - Wonder Tackie, number one contender to the IBF, WBA and WBC unification bout has predicted a fifth round knockout over Kostya Tszyu, undisputed World Super Light Weight Champion from Australia in their title fight scheduled for Saturday, May 18, at Las Vegas, USA.\n\nIn an interview with the GNA Sports, Tackie who is currently the International Boxing Federation (IBF) Inter Continental Super Lightweight Champion said he has studied tapes of Tszyu and feels the Australian style of fighting suits him.

Tackie, 27, who is based in the USA and also holds the North America Boxing Federation (NABF) Super lightweight title has an enviable record of 26-24-2, 15 by way of knockout.

Speaking to GNA Sports, Moses Foh Amoaning, second vice chairman of the GBA said the project, which would be undertaken jointly with Accra Metropolitan Assembly is yet to take off due to financial constraints.\n\nHe said the GBA has already formed an eight-member committee headed by Mr Solomon Ofei Darko, Accra Metropolitan Assembly's (AMA) Chief Executive and would be soon inaugurated by the Minister of Youth and Sports for them to start work.\n\n\"At the moment the architectural drawings are ready and in conjunction with the AMA, we have been able to identify the site for the project. \"The project is within the range of three billion cedis and additional funding would be sought through cooperate syndication. The project when completed would be self financing since it would have stores that would be let out in addition to revenue that would accrue from user fees to be paid by boxers.\"\n\nMr Foh Amoaning said the project which is an essential part of the GBA long term plan to produce world beaters in many ranks would need to get off the blocks as early as possible.\n\nGRi /\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nEastern Regional Athletics Open Championship ends at Koforidua\n\nKoforidua (Eastern Region) 15 March 2002 - The first Eastern Regional Athletics Open Championship ended at Koforidua at the week-end with Alex Qyarmye winning the sprint double in the men's category.
