        "text": "Early life and education\n\nHon. Tackie-Komme was born a royal and he comes from the Ga dynasty. His father was a former King (paramount chief) of the Ga people in Accra. He attended the Accra Sempe School and later the Kinbu Senior Technical School (formerly Government Boys School)where he graduated with a Middle School Leaving certificate. He entered into public service right after. Between 1970 and 1974 he was a school tutor. He joined the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs as a public servant between 1974 and 1985 and quickly rose to the rank of Assistant Registrar. From 2003 to 2005, he was an Assembly Member at the Accra Metropolitan Assembly for the Kinka Electoral Area, and from 2005 to 2012, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for the Odododiodioo Constituency. Professionally, Hon Tackie-Komme is a member of the Institute of Directors-Ghana where he obtained a certificate and diploma in Corporate Governance.
