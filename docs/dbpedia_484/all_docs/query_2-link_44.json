        "text": "Ricky Hatton vs Kosta Tszyu\n\nHatton vs Kosta Tszyu was the biggest fight of the Englishman’s career when it took place at the MEN Arena in Manchester, England. The Australian fighter was a brilliant boxer and was known for how tough he was. Many tipped Tszyu to destroy Hatton. The Hitman started well in the early rounds, but the Australian fighter began to get on top during the middle rounds. Many felt at this point Hatton would be overawed, however, he dug deep and boxed brilliantly throughout and his bravery was unbelievable, and he ground his opponent down to the point where he failed to appear for the final round, awarding Hatton an historic victory.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Jose Luis Castillo\n\nHatton decided to take on one of the toughest tests of his career and fight Jose Luis Castillo. Hatton started brightly landing some eye-catching combinations against the Mexican warrior. The Hitman done his best work on the inside, and answered every shot Castillo landed with a harder more accurate punch. Hatton landed a trademark body shot in the fourth, which bought the Mexican to a knee, and he was unable to beat the count and Hatton was awarded an impressive victory.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Manny Pacquiao\n\nFollowing the defeat to Mayweather, Hatton collected wins over Juan Lazcano and Paulie Malignaggi, before the Englishman secured a fight against Manny Pacquiao. Pacman kept everything cordial with Hatton throughout the build-up, but sprang to life from the first bell, knocking the Englishman down twice in the first round. Hatton couldn’t see the punches coming from the Filipino superstar, as a thudding left hand ended the fight in round two, with Hatton lying helpless on the canvas.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Juan Urango\n\nAfter being stripped of his belts, Hatton squared off against Colombian fighter Juan Urango. He was the bigger boxer, but Hatton‘s work rate was exemplary, as he stayed busy and moved well, stopping Urango from landing any meaningful shots. The Stockport-born fighter was at his accurate best, picking off his opponent at will. Urango was undefeated before he faced Hatton, but the Englishman boxed brilliantly and won a comfortable unanimous points decision.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Tommy Peacock\n\nThis was the coming of age for a young Ricky Hatton. The Hitman was 10-0 coming into the fight and he went up against undefeated Tommy Peacock who was 9-0-1. This was Hattons biggest test thus far in his career, as both fighters were aiming to win the Central Area Light Welterweight title. Hatton again showed his brilliant work rate from the first bell, unsettling Peacock with accurate punches. The Hitman knocked Peacock down in the 2nd round with an accurate left hook, which landed right on Peacock’s chin. Hatton sensed blood and knocked down his opponent once more, signalling the end of the fight.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Ben Tackie\n\nBefore Hatton tackled Tszyu, he went up against Ghanaian Ben Tackie. Hatton‘s speed and power was too much for Tackie, who couldn’t live with The Hitman‘s eye-catching combinations. The Stockport-born fighter went on to win via unanimous decision.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Jon Thaxton\n\nRicky Hatton collected another unanimous points decision win over fellow Britain Jon Thaxton who inflicted a cut above Hatton’s left eyebrow just 15 seconds into the fight. It took Hatton a few rounds before he began getting the upper hand, as he began to land combinations as the contest reached the middle rounds. Both fighters bloodied each other during the fight however, Hatton’s work was more eye-catching and impactful, which saw him overcome Thaxtons bravery and collect the decision.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Floyd Mayweather Jr\n\nTwo undefeated titans faced off against each other in Las Vegas, between reigning WBC and The Ring Welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr and The Ring light welterweight champ Hatton. The Hitman’s popularity was at an all-time high and this fight grabbed the publics attention. Hatton‘s barmy army invaded Vegas in their thousands. The Englishman performed well in the opening rounds, landing a heavy jab on Mayweather, which the American felt. Mayweather started to find more success in the second half of the fight. Hatton was knocked down in round 10 by his American opponent and after some more punishment, referee Joe Cortez waved the fight off, awarding the victory to Mayweather Jr.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Paulie Malignaggi\n\nHatton announced himself back into world title contention following a victory over Juan Lazcano. Following the triumph over Lazcano, he went up against American Paulie Malignaggi. The gap in quality between the two was more like a chasm as Hatton’s speed and combinations were too much for his American opponent, who was second best throughout. The punishment ended in round eleven when Malignaggi’s corner threw in the towel.\n\nRicky Hatton vs Carlos Maussa\n\nIn November 2005, Hatton entered into a light welterweight unification fight against then-WBA champion Carlo Maussa. This was a far from straightforward night for Hatton as he suffered cuts over both eyes in the opening rounds of the fight. Despite the cuts, Hatton boxed brilliantly and at pace throughout, which stopped Maussa from getting close at any moment. Round nine saw The Hitman land a thudding left hook, which knocked out the Colombian."
