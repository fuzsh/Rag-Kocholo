        "text": "Peter Mensah was in the midst of a full-fledged career as an engineer working for British Gas when he made the move to become an actor. Born in Ghana in 1959 but raised in England, Mensah eventually moved to Canada to pursue his dream, where he made his screen debut in an episode of \"Nancy Drew\" (CBC, 1995-96). A handful of additional guest appearances throughout the late '90s would prepare him for his big break, which eventually came in the form of the drama \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003), which he quickly followed with a role alongside Viggo Mortensen in \"Hidalgo\" (2003) the same year. Within a few years, Mensah's face became indelible when he memorably appeared as the ill-fated Persian emissary in the smash hit \"300\" (2006) in 2006. Next came the role of General Joe Greller in \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008), followed by a prominent part as the leader of the Horse Clan in the blockbuster \"Avatar\" (2009). Mensah made the transition to TV in 2010 when he began portraying Oenomaus on \"Spartacus: War of the Damned\" (Starz, 2010-13). He would reprise the role for the mini-series \"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena\" (Starz, 2011). Though he would play the Persian messenger once again for the \"300\" prequel \"300: Rise of an Empire\" (2014), Mensah would find continual success in television, playing The Hidden One on \"Sleepy Hollow\" (Fox, 2013-17) and Lemuel Bridger on \"Midnight, Texas\" (NBC, 2017-).\n\nJohn Evans Fiifi Atta Mills (21 July 1944 â€“ 24 July 2012) was a Ghanaian politician and legal scholar who served as President of Ghana from 2009 to 2012. He was inaugurated on 7 January 2009, having defeated the ruling party candidate Nana Akufo-Addo in the 2008 election. Previously he was Vice-President from 1997 to 2001 under President Jerry Rawlings, and he stood unsuccessfully in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections as the candidate of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). He is the first Ghanaian head of state to die in office."
