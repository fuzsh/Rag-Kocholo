        "text": "The 27th win in a row of Ricky Hatton's professional career arrived in the manner of so many in the past. Justin Rowsell was not just beaten, he was annihilated, pounded by power punches before being stopped, defenceless on the ropes, 36 seconds into the second round as Hatton retained his World Boxing Union light-welterweight title at the Wembley conference centre.\n\nHatton's overwhelming superiority was obvious from the outset on Saturday night and the 23-year-old Mancunian would almost certainly have won in the first round had he not lost composure when he stunned his Australian challenger in the opening seconds. Instead of picking his punches he threw the kitchen sink in his desperation to deliver a knockout punch.\n\nRowsell, who offered nothing worthwhile, slumped through the ropes almost on to the television commentators but somehow survived to the bell. When the referee Mickey Vann ended the destruction in the second round Rowsell's trainer Jeff Fenech, a former world champion at three weights, had already sent a white towel of surrender fluttering into the ring.\n\nInevitable suggestions that Hatton should be moved up to a higher level before a much talked about challenge to the division's formidable world No1, the Russian-born Australian Kostya Tszyu, brought a frosty response from Hatton's promoter Frank Warren.\n\nHard men from the American circuits, such as the rugged Irish-American Mickey Ward (who ruthlessly exposed the Liverpudlian Shea Neary), Jesse James Leija and the Ghanaian Ben Tackie have all been proposed, but Warren insisted he would not rush the progress of his protege.\n\n\"Ricky will fight again in February but I will decide the opponent. Why should he be given a fight which could be a war when we are looking towards putting on a massive fight against Kostya Tszyu?\" Warren said.\n\n\"I personally believe that Ricky could beat Tszyu now, but he is still improving with every fight and it is important that he is brought along gradually until the time is right. Whatever any supposed experts tell me will make no difference.\"\n\nHatton is happy to bow to the advice of his mentor and said: \"It would be hopeless if I were deciding who I was going to fight. I think I can beat everybody, and I would be ready to take on anybody at any time. All I know is that once Frank Warren says it's time for me to fight Tszyu I will be bringing his belts back to Britain.\""
