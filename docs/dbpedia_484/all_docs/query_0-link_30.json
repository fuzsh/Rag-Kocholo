        "text": "KOSTYA TSZYU PROFILE\n\nBy Darren Galea darren@aic.net.au\n\nThe Kostya Tszyu Web Site\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/6990\n\nKostya Tszyu was born on September 19, 1969 in Serov, Russia. Once part of the former Soviet Union, the city of Serov is located east of Moscow, within the Ural Mountains. It is an icy and desolate place a centre for Russian industry. Within this impoverished setting, Kostya Tszyu learned his trade.\n\nThe first child of a factory worker Boris and home-maker Valentina, young Kostya started sparring at the local gym at age 9; by his teens, he was already a seasoned competitor.\n\nKostya amassed an amateur record of 270 wins, 12 losses. Many of his defeats came early in his career and he has reversed most of them. Kostya has not lost a bout since 1989. He was six times Russian amateur champion, three times European amateur champion and twice voted the most outstanding boxer at the European tournaments.\n\nKostya's first major international boxing appearance was in 1990 at the Goodwill Games in Seattle, Washington as part of the Russian National Team. Tszyu easily made it through to the finals and defeated Russian team mate Aleksander Banin to claim the gold medal in the 139 lbs division.\n\nWhen Tszyu arrived in Sydney in 1991 to compete in the World Amateur Championships big things were expected of him. Tszyu didn't fail to deliver by defeating crafty American Vernon Forrest in the gold medal match. His astonishing victory in Sydney was also the turning point in his career.\n\nOn witnessing Tszyu's victory over Forrest, three times world champion Jeff Fenech commented, \"As a fighter I have not seen any better.\" Equally impressed with Kostya's performance were master trainer Johnny Lewis (whom guided Australians Jeff Fenech and Jeff Harding to world titles) and boxing promoter Bill Mordey.\n\nFenech was there when, over dinner in Sydney with an interpreter present, Mordey and Lewis convinced Tszyu to return to Australia and turn professional after his 1991 World Amateur victory. \"His decision to come back to Australia and turn pro was the best thing he has ever done,\" says Fenech.\n\nTszyu's professional debut took place on the Azumah Nelson-Jeff Fenech II under-card in Melbourne in March of 1992. His opponent that day was Darrell Hiles who was the former Australian featherweight champ. Tszyu demolished him inside of two minutes with a barrage of punches. Ring-siders and millions viewing the bout all over the world were amazed at the strength and speed of this 140 pounder from Russia.\n\nThere is an interesting anecdote to Kostya's professional debut which shall be described briefly: Kostya arrived in Sydney, Australia with fiancee Natasha in January of 1992, at that stage he had very little grasp of the English language. In his corner prior to his pro debut against Hiles his trainer Johnny Lewis was wary of his opponent and stressed to Kostya to make a good start and \"win the first round\". At that instance Tszyu leaped from his stool and proceeded to destroy Hiles. After knocking his opponent out cold after two minutes, Lewis asked Tszyu \"Why the hurry?\" Tszyu replied bluntly \"Because you told me to win in the first round!\" Talk about a communication breakdown.\n\nIn the main event that day the Professor proved too strong a warrior and stopped a courageous Fenech in the 8th. But it was not the man from Accra that everyone was talking about during the post fight festivities -- it was the pig-tailed bomber from Siberia.\n\nWith the exception of former champions: Juan LaPorte (W-10) and Livingstone Bramble (W-10), Tszyu only needed a total of 15 rounds to demolish his next seven opponents. Stopping perennial contender Sammy Fuentes (KO-1), and making his professional debut in the USA by also halting Steven Larrimore (KO-2).\n\nIt was now time for the US television to take notice and in 1994 Kostya ventured to Tampa, Florida to be show-cased on USA's Tuesday Night Fights. His opponent was tough Mexican Hector Lopez. In only his eleventh professional outing many would ask why Tszyu would want to face such a renowned tough guy, Tszyu's cold reply was \"Because I'm a fighter, I fight\". It was certainly a tough test for Tszyu who won by a unanimous decision. Lopez had nothing but admiration for his conqueror, both are now close friends and since then Lopez has visited Sydney on several occasions to work with Tszyu.\n\nTszyu made light work of rangy Angel Hernadez (KO-7) and southpaw Pedro Sanchez (KO-4) in his next two fights to ensure a title shot against IBF Junior Welterweight Champ Jake Rodriguez, who had recently won the title from Charles Murray.\n\nRodriguez crashed to the canvas from a Tszyu right chop during the opening seconds of the bout, but got up to fight on. It took a further four knock-downs in round six before referee Richard Steele would stop the bout, declaring Kostya Tszyu the winner and new IBF Junior Welterweight Champion.\n\nIn his only other appearance in 1995 Kostya defeated former champion Roger Mayweather in what was a boring bout. Mayweather, in survival mode clinched Tszyu throughout the entire fight, Kostya winning every round and thus claiming a unanimous decision. Kostya's next defense was against unbeaten Columbian\n\nHugo Pineda, the IBF is number one contender.\n\nLate in 1995 controversy struck the Tszyu camp as promoter Bill Mordey was ousted and replaced by Vlad Warton. The new management team lost the purse bid to Pineda's manager William Chams for the defense. So the IBF scheduled the bout to take place on Pineda's home turf: Cartagena, Columbia. The city of\n\nCartagena was in a state of emergency and Kostya felt it unsafe to travel to Columbia. The IBF disagreed and declared that Tszyu would not come to any harm in Columbia and threatened to strip him of his title. IBF President Bobby Lee declared that Pineda and South African Jan Bergman would fight for the vacant title in Columbia on November of 1995.\n\nLuckily Tszyu's management filed a court injunction to prevent the strip and Tszyu was reinstated as champion, with his defense against Pineda rescheduled to take place in Sydney, Australia. The bout was certainly a tough one for Tszyu who suffered a flash knockdown in the opening round. Kostya said this \"woke him up\" and he went on to knock out the rangy Columbian in round eleven. Kostya's gritty performance against his Columbian foe lead trainer Johnny Lewis to believe that \"This was Kostya's best performance of his career.\"\n\nKostya's next outing in 1996 was a four-round demolition job of flashy American Corey Johnson, but his next bout, a mandatory defense against South African Jan Bergman, was seen as a much tougher test.\n\nBergman (32-0) recently annexed the South African junior welterweight title and was touted by the press to be the best fighter out of South Africa. He displayed excellent power and speed and had amassed 24 victories by KO. Certainly a tough foe for the Russian born Australian.\n\nThe challenger began well as he employed a hit-and-run style to eclipse Tszyu and win the first two rounds. Tszyu stalked his opponent and began to catch up to him and land some telling blows. By the fourth round Kostya was well on top and began to rattle his opponent with a series of solid rights and lefts.\n\nTszyu's eye was gashed early in the sixth round by an accidental head-butt. It seemed the bout would go to the cards, but ringside doctor Lou Lewis examined the wound and ordered Tszyu to continue.\n\nThis was the catalyst for Tszyu who unleashed several unanswered punches which nailed Bergman to the canvas in devastating fashion. After the bout Tszyu praised his beaten opponent and expressed an interest to challenge the divisions top fighters: Oscar de la Hoya, Frankie Randall and Julio Cesar Chavez. Bergman's trainer Kenny Adams and promoter Cedric Kushner responded by stating that Tszyu would knock out De La Hoya if the two ever meet. It was seen by many as Kostya's last fight in Australia and he went out in devastating form.\n\nLate in 1996 Tszyu signed to fight with Bob Arum and the Top-Rank organization. At this point in his career Tszyu needs exposure in the lucrative US market and his scheduled bout against the IBF's number nine contender Leonardo Mas on the de la Hoya/Gonzalez under-card hopes to ensure this.\n\nTszyu is already a household name within his adopted country of Australia and it only seems a matter of time that the name Kostya Tszyu will be on the lips of fight fans all over the world."
