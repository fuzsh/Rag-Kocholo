        "text": "\"Even if I don't have a fight, I can't stop training,\" Josh Feldman told SA Boxing Talk ahead of his March 8 bout against Sibusiso Muteleni at Box Camp Booysens in Johannesburg, South Africa. \"Right now, I feel I'm in the best shape.\"\n\nThe Cape Town native said he is all-in. \"I'm taking this so seriously. I just care about training, watching film, and sleeping. I believe I'm going to be the best in the country soon.\"\n\nBecause of his commitment to training, Feldman has had no problem making the junior middleweight limit. \"I don't have to cut a lot of weight. I feel strong. I definitely think I'll stay at this weight for maybe the next couple years.\" He told The Jewish Boxing Blog, \"When I'm not in camp, I walk around at about 76 kg [about 167 pounds].\" Two weeks from his third pro fight, he said he's now 162 lbs.\n\nFeldman began his camp at home in Cape Town where he trains at Blood, Sweat, and Tears Boxing Gym. \"My coaches in Cape Town at Blood, Sweat, and Tears worked me so hard,\" he told SA Boxing Talk's Hayden Jones. To The JBB, he added, \"In Cape Town, I got some good sparring with a fighter named Dylan Prosser.\" A 24 year old, Prosser is a 3-0 pro.\n\nFeldman's camp then shifted to Johannesburg where he trains at Colin Nathan's Hot Box Gym. \"In Johannesburg, I'm sparring with a variety of people.\" He named a tough, young road warrior named Simnikiwe Bongco (4-4) and undefeated four-year pro Cayden Truter (7-0) as fighters who have given him good work. His usual main sparring partner, Almighty Creed Moyo, is missing this camp due to an injury.\n\nThe 19-year old is ready for his next opponent, Sibusiso Muteleni. \"Actually, I saw a short video of his first fight,\" he told Jones. \"He looks pretty basic, but looks like he might have a bit of fundamentals. But nothing I can't deal with. So, I'm really excited. I hope he shows up with his 'A' game. I'm ready for a hard fight.\"\n\nFor this camp, Feldman has been working on fine-tuning his skills and sitting down on his punches to generate more power. \"I feel like I'm very fit, so I just want to properly hone my skills. I've learned to sit down on my punches more. It's really different than the amateurs.\"\n\nHis coaches helped him realize after his first fight last October that he need a change in style now that he's a prizefighter. \"You're not just trying to outpoint the guy and land more punches, but you're trying to do damage. So when I'm working the bag, hitting the pads, sparring, I'm trying to properly sit down and pick my shots rather than throw more shots and not do any damage.\"\n\nFeldman is anxious to stay active. \"I would fight every week if I could,\" he joked. \"I'd like to fight four or five times [this year] realistically.\" That activity will lead to longer fights, something Feldman craves.\n\n\"I feel like I'm starting to get very comfortable in the ring. I'm excited for the fights when they start getting six, eight rounds. I feel like I'm going to do better, because later into the fight I'm going to start adjusting, getting more comfortable, and that's when I fight the best,\" he said in the SA Boxing Talk interview.\n\n\"I'm a very skilled fighter, technical, so late into the fight, once I've found my range and I've gotten used to where punches are coming from from the opponent, I'm going to start then using my skills and picking him off, and eventually get a stoppage late.\"\n\nFeldman exudes a quiet confidence. When asked about stablemate Sive Nontshinga, who just regained the IBF light flyweight world title last Friday, Josh's eyes lit up. He said of Nontshinga's inspirational win, \"It's amazing to see, because he just trains so hard. You see how skillful he is in sparring and training. I knew he would do it, but it's great to see it actually happen.\"\n\nFeldman has the mindset to reach his goals one day. \"I'm not getting worn out by the sport. I'm just getting hungrier.\"\n\nWhen asked about opponents down the road, Feldman responded, \"Roark Knapp is the main guy. In the next couple years, I'd definitely love to fight him if he's still active. He's an inspiration to someone like me to see him climb the ladder.\"\n\nHe has a message, not just for Knapp, but for all potential opponents, \"Catch me now, because I'm just getting better.\"\n\nFlyweight Yonatan Landman is scheduled to face Simon Tackie on March 5 at the famed Bukom Boxing Arena in Accra, Ghana.\n\nLandman is a 19 year old from Kiryat, Israel. He won his pro debut on January 31 when he stopped Agayev Gasim in the first round in Baku, Azerbaijan. Fellow Israeli flyweight David Alaverdian has been training with Landman for some time and has noticed improvement. \"He gets better and stronger every year,\" David noted.\n\nFor Landman, this contest is about the experience of fighting in Ghana. His opponent, Simon Tackie (0-2), won't put up much resistance. In his 2021 debut against the wonderfully named Marvellous Dodoo, Tackie spent the first round covering up while standing in front of Dodoo, absorbing the winless fighter's random slapping swings. To Tackie's credit, he changed strategy in the second, holding on for dear life as if Dodoo was a mountainous cliff and the sport of boxing was a 1,000-foot drop. Tackie lost a point for holding in the third, spent twenty seconds on the canvas after a slip, and retired after the round.\n\nBoxRec claims Tackie then gained 30 pounds and fought six days later, losing to Gabriel Coffie. If it sounds unbelievable, it's because it is. Though Tackie was listed as the opponent, it was actually Emanuel Allotey who fought Coffie. Poor Simon, credited with a loss in a fight in which he didn't even participate.\n\nA year ago, Tackie fought Daniel Otoo, another winless foe. Simon was relatively better than in his debut, landing a jab and a left hook in the first round, but he kept his gloves around his forehead and held his elbows out wide. In the second, Otoo battered Tackie from corner to corner smashing a well-placed overhand right in between.\n\nAfter the round, Tackie's trainer spent a little over a minute trying to convince him to go get knocked out. Too often in boxing, fighters are labeled as quitters when they show good sense. Tackie won the argument, and the fight was stopped. What he lacks in heart, he more than makes up for in sanity. He'd likely make a better lawyer than fighter. Tackie's best quality as a boxer is the courage he shows to get in the ring.\n\nThis bout is scheduled for four rounds.\n\nSmash Hit: Race, Crime, and Culture in Boxing Films\n\nBy David Curcio\n\nArmin Lear Press, 2023\n\nIn Smash Hit, David Curcio expertly plays the roles of film critic, boxing historian, and cultural commentator. His immense knowledge of film, boxing, and American culture coupled with the way he weaves them all together in almost every one of the twenty chapters (each about one film) is an astonishing achievement. While this book would fit comfortably in a college or graduate level curriculum, it can be enjoyed by anyone interested in the history of cinema or boxing.\n\nOf the five movies discussed that I've seen (it should be noted I'm the antithesis of a cinephile), Curcio provides perfect analysis for four of them. Not only do I agree with his interpretations of those films, but they go beyond what I had considered. The other fifteen chapters are just as informative, and the writing is excellent.\n\nThe chapter on Rocky III is the only one in which I disagree with Curcio's view. He writes, \"Adrian is relegated to an ancillary character, once again struck dumb and keeping the film firmly rooted in the male realm.\" But this ignores the scene on the beach where Adrian delivers a fiery speech to reignite Rocky's passion for boxing after he has decided to quit the sport. It's the moment Adrian breaks out of her shell and forces Rocky to face the harsh truth of his fear. \"How did you get to be so strong?\" Rocky asks her when the shouting is done. \"I live with a fighter,\" Adrian's replies. Overly ambitious, the context provided in the Rocky III chapter doesn't flow as seamlessly as in all the others. Instead, it reads more like a series of tangential asides.\n\nThe only other section that isn't top notch is about Gentleman Jim and only because of a few minor factual errors, mostly involving dates, such as Jim Corbett's career being placed in the 1880s instead of the 1890s (dates for Ali-Frazier I & Lewis-Tyson also have typos). In that chapter, Curcio discusses a Corbett foe, Joe Choynski, one of many Jewish boxers, actors, and characters covered.\n\nTons of Jewish history is present here. Curcio delves into the story of actor John Garfield and other Jews who were blacklisted or targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Edward G, Robinson is just another of the many Jewish actors mentioned. There are great anecdotes such as when Mushy Callahan doubled for Errol Flynn during the boxing scenes in Gentleman Jim. Barney Ross is the subject of a couple of the movies covered. So is Max Baer. And who could forget Rocky's trainer Mickey Goldmill? Those are just some of the Jews featured in these pages.\n\nIn Smash Hit, Curcio shows he is a writer of the highest quality. There is no one better suited to cover the blend of boxing and film and, any disagreements aside, the book is executed brilliantly. Whether or not you've seen any of the movies featured in Smash Hit, it's definitely worth reading.\n\nJunior middleweight Joshua Feldman is scheduled to face Sibusiso Muteleni on March 8 at Box Camp Booysens in Johannesburg, South Africa. Boxing in the country, however, has grinded to a virtual standstill due to legal issues.\n\nZizi Kodwa, the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture in South Africa, completely replaced the board of Boxing South Africa (BSA) last November. BSA regulates the sport in the country. The new board took over on December 12. The day after, it repealed the suspension of Operations Director, Mandla Ntlanganiso.\n\nThe National Professional Boxing Promoters Association sued Minister Kodwa, arguing that the NPBPA hadn't been consulted before the board was replaced, which violated the law. As a result of the lawsuit, the new board has since ceased to function. The old board's term ran out on December 11, so there is currently no active commission in the country. South African boxers cannot fight abroad either since BSA is responsible for granting them approval to do so.\n\nBoxing5 Promotions head Larry Wainstein, who promotes Feldman, criticized the NPBPA. He said in an interview with SA Boxing Talk, \"They represent maybe twenty promoters in the country. They don't represent all the promoters. They don't represent the boxers. There are 705 registered licensed boxers. There must be countrywide- and I'm guessing because I've asked for the number and nobody can even tell me the number- fifty promoters.\" Wainstein then suggested the NPBPA was the tail wagging the dog.\n\nPromoter Rodney Berman postponed his March 9 show and expressed frustration with the impasse. \"This state of flux makes it impossible to go ahead as planned,\" he said.\n\nJackie Brice, another promoter, has canceled his proposed March 16. He fumed to Ink Sport, \"The National Professional Boxing Promoters Association is killing boxing in this country.\" Bruce recently resigned from the association.\n\nWainstein intends to go ahead with his March 8 card, or \"tournament\" as shows are called in South Africa. He has asked Minister Kodwa to appoint an interim board so that boxing can continue while the legal process runs its course.\n\nIt is in this context that Feldman (2-0), a 19 year old southpaw from Cape Town, prepares for his third professional fight. His opponent, Muteleni, is from Guateng. He lost his lone pro fight on May 28 last year to Douniama Gislain by first round KO. Muteleni threw a few jabs, but mostly walked in behind a high guard and paid the price. He was knocked down twice. After the second knockdown, he stayed on a knee for the count.\n\nHopefully, Feldman and his fellow South African boxers will be allowed to fight soon. \"They're complaining about the minister never followed procedure. Ok, he never followed procedure,\" Wainstein acknowledged before asking, \"Must all the other people be held to ransom because the [NPBPA] want to be seen as putting their people in place?\n\nFor the sake of South African boxing, let's hope not."
