To many viewers, this fight may have looked like a \"pay day\" in fact, as Clottey basically did defense for 12 full rounds, winning only a single round on two of the 3 judges score cards.\n\nFrom the beginning to end, it was Pacquiao as the busier, more active fighter, constantly throwing, landing and actually \"TRYING\" being the key word. Clottey appeared to be waiting for Pacquiao to tire before he turned it on, but he never did. He just waited and waited, and did very little if anything at all.\n\nIn between rounds 8 and 9, Clottey's trainer told him, \"You're losing every damn round.\". In between rounds 9 and 10, he added \"you still haven't won a round!\".\n\nClottey's best moments were rounds 3 and 11 where his uppercuts were landing with ease, snapping Pacquiao's head up, but were they enough to win rounds where Pacquiao fought hard from beginning to end.\n\nFinal scores were 120-108, 119-109, 119-109.\n\nClottey falls to 35-4 with 21 KO's.\n\nRay Flores @ Ringside\n\nPhotos: Chris Farina - Top Rank\n\nSoto Wins Unanimously Over Diaz\n\nHumberto Soto won a 12 rounds unanimous decision over David Diaz in a back and forth good action fight that saw Diaz hit the canvas in the first and last rounds. Final scores were115-111, 117-109, 117-109.\n\nGomez Beats Castillo To Submission In Stinker\n\nWelterweight Alfonso Gomez (22-4-2, 11 KO's) seemingly put an end to Jose Luis Castillo's (60-10-1, 52 KO's) career when after 5 rounds of somewhat lackluster boxing Castillo told his corner he had enough and called it a day. Gomez retains his WBC Continental Americas welterweight title while Castillo retains little if any of his dignity after this dismal showing.\n\nDuddy Gets By With A Splitty\n\nMiddleweight John Duddy got a bit of a scare with a split decision win over Michael Medina in a relatively dull fight that saw no knockdowns. Duddy moves to 29-1 with 18 KO's while Medina falls to 23-2-2 with 18 KO's.\n\nFull Reports To Come"
