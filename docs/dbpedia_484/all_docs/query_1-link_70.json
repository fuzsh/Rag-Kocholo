        "text": "A roundup of the past week's notable boxing results from around the world:\n\nSaturday at Manchester, England\n\nTerry Flanagan TKO2 Diego Magdaleno\n\nRetains a lightweight title\n\nRecords: Flanagan (29-0, 12 KOs); Magdaleno (28-2, 12 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: On July 11, Flanagan scored a second-round knockout of Jose Zepeda to win a vacant lightweight world title, the one Terence Crawford vacated to move up in weight. Flanagan did it in front of his Manchester hometown crowd, but, even though he won a 135-pound belt, it was a huge disappointment -- at least for most watching -- because of the abrupt and nondefinitive ending. Zepeda dislocated his shoulder throwing a punch in the second round, and the fight was stopped after the round. So Flanagan won a belt but it was as if nothing happened.\n\nThat is the exact opposite of what happened as Flanagan, 26, who goes by \"Turbo,\" made his first defense against fellow southpaw Magdaleno, 28, of Las Vegas. Flanagan authored a very impressive, three-knockdown, no-doubt-about-it stoppage of Magdaleno for the best win of his career. He made it look easy against Magdaleno, the mandatory challenger. Magdaleno was getting his second shot at a world title. After a very competitive split-decision loss to Roman \"Rocky\" Martinez for a junior lightweight world title in Macau in 2013, Magdaleno moved up in weight and won five fights in a row to land the shot with Flanagan.\n\nFlanagan won a somewhat spirited first round, then destroyed Magdaleno, who continually slipped to the canvas in the second round when he wasn't getting knocked down. Flanagan knocked him down three times in the round for the victory. The first one came a little less than a minute into the round on a clean right hand to the chin that put Magdaleno on his rear end.\n\nA left uppercut and a right hand powerfully rocked Magdaleno's head back and sent him into the ropes moments later, then down to the canvas again as Flanagan kept firing punches. Magdaleno beat the count but was in terrible trouble and went down again a few seconds later as Flanagan overwhelmed him with punches. Magdaleno tried to fight back, but his legs were gone and Flanagan teed off on him. When Flanagan crushed Magdaleno with a pair of left hands along the ropes, referee Terry O'Connor finally stepped in at 2 minutes, 38 seconds, and stopped the fight.\n\nIt was a sensational performance from Flanagan, who certainly answered any of the lingering questions remaining from the aborted fight with Zepeda.\n\n\"Now people will start standing up and taking notice of me and know that I'm the real thing,\" Flanagan said. \"Anyone who knows me knows that I'll fight anyone, anytime. I love boxing, and I'm in to prove that I'm the best in the world. I want to defend my title again and then look at unification fights to show just how good I can really be.\"\n\nLiam Smith KO7 John Thompson\n\nWins a vacant junior middleweight title\n\nRecords: Smith (21-0-1, 11 KOs); Thompson (17-2, 6 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Liam Smith, 27, of England, whose brothers Paul and Stephen are also notable fighters, scored a sensational knockout of Thompson, 26, of Newark, New Jersey, to win the belt that was stripped from inactive titleholder Demetrius Andrade.\n\nThe longer and taller Thompson, who won the 2015 ESPN Boxcino junior middleweight tournament in a big surprise, considering he was an alternate pressed into service the day before the opening round because Cleotis Pendarvis failed to make weight and was booted out of the field, boxed circles around Smith in the early rounds. But once Smith got into a groove in about the third round, he came alive. He began to land his jab and right hand and eventually took Thompson apart.\n\nSmith -- with the unusual nickname of \"Beefy\" -- badly hurt Thompson in a huge sixth round. He rocked Thompson's head back with a left hand a minute into the round and pressured him intensely for the rest of the round. Late in the round, he hurt Thompson again with a hard left hook and then a right hand. Thompson's legs looked very shaky, and he was lucky to make it out of the round. Smith walked right to Thompson in the seventh round looking to pick up where he left off and quickly had him in trouble. He nearly took his head off with a head-snapping right hand along the ropes, then chased him around the ring, all the while throwing power shots. He finally tracked him down and landed a brutal right hand that dropped Thompson face first. Thompson struggled mightily to beat the count, but he was gone and referee Marcus McDonnell counted him out at 1 minute, 44 seconds, sending Smith and his team into a wild celebration after he closed the show in ferocious style.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable feeling and it hasn't sunk in yet, but it means the world to me,\" Smith said. \"It's the only belt we're missing in the family, and I'm over the moon to be the first to bring it home and, hopefully, it will be the first of many world titles.\n\n\"It took me a couple of rounds to settle in. He started fast and flashy and was moving well, but I knew he couldn't keep that pace, and when my punches started to rock his head, and when I hurt his body, I knew it wasn't going long. I'm now in the elite of the 154-pound division, and the other Americans can start calling me out now. I'll fight anyone. The division is packed with names [twin brothers Jermall and Jermell] Charlo, [Erislandy] Lara, [Canelo] Alvarez. But I've arrived now and they can chase me.\"\n\nSaturday at Caracas, Venezuela\n\nJorge Linares KO4 Ivan Cano\n\nRetains a lightweight title\n\nRecords: Linares (40-3, 27 KOs); Cano (23-7-2, 15 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Linares, 30, of Venezuela, has been a pro since 2002 but, despite winning world titles as a featherweight, junior lightweight and lightweight, had boxed in his home country only three times. He had not fought there since 2010 and had never boxed at home in any of his title fights. Instead, Linares traveled the world, fighting primarily in Japan and the United States as well as in other countries. But that changed with this long-awaited homecoming title defense against Cano, 28, of Mexico.\n\nLinares, who was coming off a very hard, 10th-round knockout of mandatory challenger Kevin Mitchell in Mitchell's native England on May 30, had a much easier time with Cano, a tough journeyman, who also got knocked out in his only other notable bout, that coming by 11th-round stoppage to Montreal contender Dierry Jean in 2012.\n\nWith a raucous crowd cheering his every move, Linares dominated, which was no surprise. Linares was all over Cano in the third round. He landed some heavy-duty body shots and backed him before Cano took a knee under heavy pressure with about 45 seconds left in the round. In the fourth round, Linares pounded Cano with a perfect left hook to the body and he took a step back, dropped to a knee and failed to beat the count from referee Len Koivisto, who counted him out at 58 seconds just as he stood up.\n\nAlso on the card, which was streamed live in the United States on ESPN3, Venezuela's Alfonso Blanco (12-0, 5 KOs), 29, rolled to a one-sided decision win against Sergey Khomitsky (30-12-3, 13 KOs), 41, of Ukraine, to win a not-yet-vacant interim middleweight belt on scores of 119-109, 119-109 and 118-112. Try to follow along with this: Blanco won the WBA interim belt but won't be officially recognized as the interim titleholder until after current interim titlist Chris Eubank Jr. makes a defense against Tony Jeter on Oct. 24 in England, after which the winner will be stripped. Make sense? Didn't think so, but the bottom line is there are now four so-called WBA middleweight titleholders: \"super champion\" Gennady Golovkin, regular titlist Daniel Jacobs, interim titlist Eubank and interim titlist-in-waiting Blanco.\n\nSaturday at Lowell, Massachusetts\n\nGabriel \"Tito\" Bracero KO1 Danny O'Connor\n\nWelterweight\n\nRecords: Bracero (24-2, 5 KOs); O'Connor (26-3, 10 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Knockout of the year alert! Bracero has a reputation as a guy who can't break an egg, but do not tell that to O'Connor, who got brutally knocked out in just 41 seconds in an absolute shocker in the main event of a Premier Boxing Champions card on NBCSN.\n\nIn 2011, O'Connor, 30, of Framingham, Massachusetts, and Bracero, 34, of New York, met in a junior welterweight bout and Bracero won a near-shutout eight-round decision. Going into the rematch, on O'Connor's home turf, O'Connor was viewed as the favorite. O'Connor had won three fights in a row and the visiting Brooklynite was coming off a one-sided 10-round decision loss to 2008 Dominican Olympic gold medalist Felix Diaz.\n\nO'Connor said he had rejected overtures for a rematch with Bracero five times because he did not feel the time was right. He eventually changed his mind, and it is a decision that turned out to be a very bad one as a single right hand to the jaw over O'Connor's lazy left hand ended the fight, for which the beloved Micky Ward, of Lowell, was ringside. O'Connor was out before he hit the canvas, and, when he did, his head viciously hit the mat, prompting referee Arthur Mercante to stop the fight immediately without a count. It wouldn't have mattered. O'Connor was out cold and motionless for several minutes as he received medical attention. He was eventually able to get to his feet. Bracero was classy the whole time. There was no wild celebration, just what appeared to be genuine concern for O'Connor, a married father of two, including a baby born just a couple of weeks ago. O'Connor was taken by ambulance to Lowell General Hospital as a precaution and for a CT scan, which was negative, and he was released several hours later.\n\n\"I worked on that punch for six weeks,\" Bracero said after the fight. \"In my last fight, I fought a southpaw and made some mistakes. I specifically worked on that punch because Danny's a southpaw. I slipped to the side and threw the right. This was the first time I went away to camp, away from my family. I'm just so humbled and grateful. I knew coming in here that all the pressure was on him; the crowd would try to take the beast out of me and put me on the defense.\n\n\"God bless Danny O'Connor. He's a champion. Just because he lost here today, I still tip my hat off to him. It takes a real champion to come in here and do what he does. I wish him the best. My message to Danny was, after my last fight, after my last loss, I was down. I went through a depression. I told him not to let that happen to him. To pick himself back up, to be proud of himself. To go home to his beautiful wife and kids and enjoy life. I didn't want the same thing to happen to him that happened to me.\"\n\nSaturday at Mexico City\n\nRamon Alvarez (22-4-2, 14 KOs) TKO4 Ben Tackie (30-13-1, 18 KOs)\n\nJunior middleweight\n\nRecords: Ramon Alvarez (22-4-2, 14 KOs) TKO4 Ben Tackie (30-13-1, 18 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Alvarez, 29, of Mexico, is Canelo Alvarez's older brother and is unbeaten since 2012 (8-0 with a no contest because of an injury to his opponent) after this one-sided thrashing of ancient Tackie, 42, of Ghana, who took a beating of a lifetime.\n\nTackie was once a decent junior welterweight contender and got a shot at Hall of Famer Kostya Tszyu in 2002 and lost virtually every second of the fight. He also lost to notable opponents such as Ricky Hatton, Robert Garcia (yes, the trainer), Sharmba Mitchell, Alfonso Gomez, Kendall Holt, Juan Lazcano and Matthew Hatton. Tackie retired in 2010 after six losses in a row. He returned for a low-level win in Ghana in March 2014, then made the ill-advised decision to face Alvarez in a fight that should never have been sanctioned.\n\nTackie had absolutely nothing but his heart. He took a severe shellacking for the entire fight. From the outset, Alvarez hammered him with combinations to the head and body. Tackie, with less movement than a statue, sopped up all the punishment. One of his best attributes was always his chin. He had never been stopped before. Until this fight. Alvarez continued to pummel him round after round, rocking him several times. Eventually, all he could do was cover up and take blows. Finally, in the fourth round, Alvarez pinned him in a corner and unloaded a sustained flurry of unanswered punches until referee Jose Guadalupe Garcia intervened at 1 minute, 52 seconds. Hopefully, Tackie will return to retirement where he belongs and Alvarez will face a more legitimate opponent next time out.\n\nSaturday at Caseros, Argentina\n\nOmar Narvaez W10 Diego Liriano\n\nJunior bantamweight\n\nScores: 100-90 (twice), 99-91\n\nRecords: Narvaez (44-4-2, 23 KOs); Liriano (16-7-1, 3 KOs)"
