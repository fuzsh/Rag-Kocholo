        "text": "By Johnny Ortiz (photo by Paul Speak)\n\nIf any fight could rival the brutal confrontation of Castillo-Corrales, it could very well be this Saturday night’s fight between IBF Super Lightweight Champion Kostya “Thunder” Tszyu and England’s #1 IBF/WBO challenger Ricky “The Hitman” Hatton. Knowing Kostya as I do, I do not believe that as intelligent a fighter as he is, he would ever allow himself to engage in an all-out war such as Castillo-Corrales, especially when it doesn’t jive with his fighting style. Not many smart fighters would.\n\nPrior to his fight with Trinidad, Winky Wright, when asked if he expected to be in a fight comparable to the “C” boys, replied: “Are you crazy, I don’t get into fights like that.” “Famoso” Hernandez, who lost a split decision to Jesus Chavez this past Saturday, alluded to the same attitude when asked the same question. “Those kind of fights take too much out of you.” In the fight of the night, Famoso then went out and engaged in a great brawl, both Carlos and Jesus gave it their all. A fighter may have other ideas how a fight should be fought, but then when a fight breaks out…he’s right there in the middle of it.\n\nThis Saturday night’s fight could still match the “C” Boys in intensity. Both Kostya and Ricky have similar styles in that they both press forward, seldom taking a backward step. Old habits die hard, even though Ricky’s only 26, I look for Ricky to fight the only way he knows how, and that is to take it to Kostya Tszyu, throwing and giving everything he has. The only thing I find wrong with this particular game plan is that Kostya, with all of his experience with much better fighters, will be waiting for Ricky to make a mistake of leaving himself open where he can pick him off, hoping to land his bomb of a right hand.\n\nIn comparing the two fighters, I find one thing that really stands out on Ricky’s record of 38 wins and no losses, outside of four fighters; I have no idea who the other 34 are. Of the four I do know, one was in his last fight on December 11, 2004, where he won a unanimous twelve round decision over veteran Ray Olivera, the second one was on June 12, 2004, when he won a twelve round unanimous decision over Carlos Vilches. The third came on December 13, 2003, he won a unanimous twelve round decision over Ben Tackie, then on September 27, 2003, Ricky beat the fourth one, Vince Phillips, a 40 year old ex-champion who’s best days were far behind him. Like the other three, Phillips was able to take Ricky the entire twelve rounds. The point I am making is that if four of the aforementioned could all take Ricky Hatton the twelve round distance, what chance has he got of stopping Kostya Tszyu? Kostya has only lost one fight in 32 outings. True, his only loss was to the same Vince Phillips, but that was eight years ago, when Vince was still a hell of a fighter, not far removed from his championship days. Kostya hasn’t lost since, and may I add, against a much better lineup. I really believe if there is to be a knockout, it will be turned in by Kostya Tszyu.\n\nRicky is a tough, little guy; the fight could very well go the distance. He is in great shape, he knows what he’s up against, and he is as ready as he ever will be to challenge the great Australian Bomber. Kostya on the other hand, also knows what he will be going up against, he knows that Ricky is a very strong, young, durable guy who comes to fight. Kostya cannot take a chance on opening a door for the non-stop punching Hitman. Kostya said something interesting that might give Ricky food-for-thought. Speaking of himself, he told reporters: “Kostya Tszyu at 35 would beat Kostya Tszyu at 25…I’m fitter, stronger and better than 10 years ago…sometimes I amaze myself.\n\nI agree, with Kostya, now a svelte, thirty-five year old, I believe with his hard, training regimentation, and the superb way he takes care of his body, he is at the top of his game. He has indicated that he plans to fight for another three years.\n\nOf course, Ricky Hatton may have something to say about the outcome to their fight. Assessing the chinks in Kostya’s armor, the Hitman was reported to have said this: “He keeps his chin up, and he’s got a very, very wide stance, which means he probably can’t get out of the way as quick. I’ve got to be very careful because he’s such a massive puncher, but I know he won’t like my workrate. He doesn’t fight like me, he’s more patient, and obviously he has that haymaker, but my usual style will be the one that will beat him.”\n\nOffering his assessment of the fight, Kostya was quoted as saying: “This will be a hard fight because Ricky is brave and has heart. He may think he can get me with body shots, but I’ve done so much work on my stomach, if he wants to punch me there I’ll say, ‘Go ahead my friend, your welcome.’ And then he will be ready for this?” Ominously, Kostya waved his right fist in the air.\n\nRicky has an unreal record, of his 38 wins, 28 have come by way of knockout. As I pointed out, only four of his wins have come against known fighters. Of his 38 fights, only four have been fought outside of England. Kostya, in winning 31 of 32 fights, has by far, the more impressive record, seventeen of the fighters he’s fought were all huge names at the time he fought them. Twelve were world champions at one time or another. Zab Judah, who Kostya knocked silly in two rounds, is today…the undisputed IBF/WBC/WBA Welterweight Champion of the World. Kostya brutally stopped Judah in the 2nd round of their Super Lightweight Championship fight. Their fight is famous for the boxing cult dance that was created in their bout…”The Funky Judah.”\n\nFor those of you who are familiar with my radio show and my articles, you know how I form bonds with the fighters who have been regulars on my show, so much so, that I consider the majority of them personal friends…Kostya Tszyu is no different. He has been on my show from Australia on four different occasions. He has never turned me down when I came calling, regardless of the time difference. He always appreciated what I had to say about him, I have always been sincere whenever we have talked. I said it before and I will say it again…Kostya Tszyu is one of the great modern champions of all-time.\n\nWhen I co-owned the Main St. Gym, I made lasting friendships with a lot of champions and challengers whenever they trained at the hallowed shrine, which was quite often. I felt the same with quite a few of the fighters I came to know who came on my radio show whenever they had an upcoming fight. I have always felt proud of all the fighters I call friend, past, present and hopefully, future. They seem to trust me; I think that knowing I was once a fighter, they consider me one of them. Some fighters are sometimes hard to get next to; the ones who have been screwed can be very cynical. Can you blame them? It can sometimes be a dirty business; I’ve had a lot of front row seats.\n\nRecently, Bernard Hopkins appeared on the McDonnell-Douglas show, the Executioner humbled me with all the very nice things he had to say about me. Bernard has been on my radio show quite a few times in the past, even co-hosting my two hour show at the ESPN Center in Downtown Disney. This particular day, Bernard went on to tell Joe and Doug what good friends we have become, I felt very proud, he went on to say that I was the only one in LA to pick him to beat Trinidad…he never forgot. I simply knew of his greatness and did not hesitate to tell everyone that Bernard Hopkins was, is, and would one day be considered one of the greatest fighters of all time. Picking him to beat Tito was a no-brainer. How did I know? I followed his career from the very beginning; I recognize greatness when I see it. I now have that particular tape with all of the kind things Bernard had to say about me on Joe and Doug’s show. I will consider it as valuable to me as the large gold coins personally given to me by Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali, coins with their likeness engraved on them.\n\nI would always receive an abundance of calls from boxing fans whenever Kostya would come on my show; they always enjoyed my conversations with the Thunder from Down Under. I guess it was very apparent over the airways what an amazing young man he is. Kostya is very unassuming, polite, and respectful toward all of his opponents. Kostya Tszyu is…a class act!\n\nGetting back to the fight this Saturday night, where Kostya is going to be fighting Ricky in his backyard in front of what may turn out to be a hostile environment, I am of course, picking Kostya to win. It may or not be a walk in the park; Ricky is prepared to go out on his shield. He thinks the pace of the fight will have a lot to do with the outcome. Ricky believes that because Kostya has ended a lot of his fights inside four rounds and hasn’t engaged in that many bouts in the last four years, mostly due to injuries that caused long layoffs, it could come back to haunt Kostya. He was stripped of his WBC/WBA belts due to inactivity. Ricky is fully aware of Kostya’s thunderbolt right hand, but figures if he can hang with Kostya for at least four or five rounds, the pace of the fight will swing in his favor. I believe that Sharmba Mitchell thought along the same lines. Ricky may be forgetting that Kostya Tszyu is well known in boxing circles for his unbelievable training methods; he seems to get stronger as the fight goes on. That, and the fact that he is one of the most intelligent fighters in the ring today, Ricky had better not put to much stock in the fight swinging his way unless Kostya has a complete breakdown. The latter is not very likely to happen, if Ricky is to win, he will have to do it on his own merits. I cannot, and will not, pick against an all time great. If he were to lose, it would come as a shock, until that time…Kostya is my guy!\n\nWin, lose or draw, I came to the dance with Kostya Tszyu…I’ll be leaving with him.\n\nTHOMPSON BOXING PROMOTIONS: “PATH TO GLORY!”\n\nKenneth Thompson, former President of the World Boxing Hall of Fame is now a highly successful local boxing promoter. Kenneth started his promotional company back in May of 2000. He had a vision of elevating the quality of boxing, to provide exciting boxing entertainment with the sole purpose of showcasing young, talented boxers in their quest for glory.\n\nBorn in Lubbock, Texas, he was raised in Anaheim, California. After serving his country in the U.S. Army, he later started Thompson Building Materials in 1962. After his strong presidency of the Hall of Fame, Kenneth stepped down; he now serves the organization quite capably in an advisory capacity. His tenure as President of the WBHF is something he should be quite proud of. We made enormous strides under his commanding leadership. Lending credence to the fact that Kenneth Thompson is a true, born leader. The man with the “Midas Touch” has the ability to succeed in anything he undertakes.\n\nHis love of boxing led him into the professional ranks of promoting. His monthly boxing shows in the Inland Empire at Omega Products International in Corona, California and the Double Tree Hotel in Ontario are the talk of the boxing world throughout the Southland. If Kenneth Thompson should ever want to go against the high echelon of boxing promoters, be sure not to count him out, he has the proven ability to compete and go head to head with anyone in the high ranks of promoting…I mean anyone!\n\nThe last five shows I have attended have all played to ‘standing room only.’ It’s one thing to put bodies in all the seats, but to see the walls in the place lined up with boxing patrons is a sight not often seen in fight clubs. Kenneth does it by providing the very best fistic talent he can find. If he has to bring them in…he brings them in.\n\nHe is extremely proud of the fistic talent he has developed along the way, young kids such as: Carlos Bojorquez (world class contender), the extremely talented, high ranked Francisco “Panchito” Bojado, NABO champion Yoni Vargas, NABO #1 contender Dwain “Tyger” Williams, WBO Latino Champion Raul Franco, former WBC champion Enrique Sanchez, Librado Andrade, light heavyweight contender and young heavyweight Chris Arreola, these are just a few fighters who grace Ken Thompson’s monthly fight cards.\n\nThis Friday night, June 3rd, Promoter Thompson will proudly present Carlos “El Elegante” Bojorquez – the fighter who retired Pernell Whitaker – in the main event. Carlos will face a formidable foe in Jose Luis Cruz. Matchmaker Alex Camponovo has put together another stellar fight card. In the super lightweight semi main, Timothy Ray Bradley goes against Alfonso Garcia; lightweights Rueben Juarez and Freudis Rojas collide in a four rounder. Two well-matched bouts round out the remainder of bouts. I can assure you that like always; the participants on the card will be as competitive as fights can possibly be. Take my word for it…you will not be disappointed.\n\nThe event will be held at the popular Doubletree Hotel in Ontario, California. Keeping ahead of himself, Kenneth Thompson has already booked fight cards for every month of the remaining year.\n\nI’ll be there this Friday night, if I haven’t already met you, please feel free to introduce yourself, I really look forward to meeting anyone who loves boxing.\n\nOn February 11, 2005, Thompson Boxing Promotions surprised me by presenting me with a Boxing Lifetime Achievement Award. I felt flattered, humbled, and extremely proud.\n\nAll freeways lead to the Doubletree Hotel in Ontario. Tickets are available by calling (714) 935-0900. All major credit cards are accepted.\n\nDo your part, help the man keeping the local boxing torch lit by attending his great fight card. He needs you to keep his boxing dream alive.\n\nHe is a maker of dreams, his name…Kenneth Thompson!\n\nUNTIL THE NEXT ROUND…PEACE AND GOD BLESS!\n\nJohnny Ortiz is a member of the World Boxing Hall of Fame Board of Directors.
