        "text": "Jeff Fenech says unbeaten Briton Ricky Hatton will be knocked out by Kostya Tszyu unless he can produce a near-perfect performance.\n\nFormer world champion Fenech has followed Hatton's career closely and says he is a \"huge fan\". He got a close look at the Englishman when he was in the corner of Justin Rowsell, the only Australian professional to have fought the \"Hitman\".\n\nRowsell has not fought since Hatton stopped him in two rounds in December of 2001 in London. He also believes Tszyu will stop Hatton and that the challenger will struggle to survive the early rounds against the Russian-born powerhouse.\n\nFenech has continued to monitor Hatton's progress since that night and is an unabashed admirer of the Englishman's style.\n\n\"He's a pressure fighter, he's a proud fighter,\" Fenech said. \"I was quoted in a magazine that I'd rather watch Ricky Hatton fight a six-rounder than watch Lennox Lewis fight for the heavyweight title of the world.\n\n\"I'm a huge, huge Ricky Hatton fan, but I'm a bigger Kostya Tszyu fan. For Ricky to beat Kostya Tszyu, he has to fight the near-perfect fight. Kostya has got to have a little bit of an off day and Ricky has got to make him. Everybody lets Kostya do what he wants to do. You've got to make Kostya fight your fight or you can't beat him. I don't honestly believe that Ricky Hatton can do it. I think Tszyu will knock him out.\"\n\nRowsell is probably better qualified than anyone - apart from Vince Phillips and Ben Tackie, the only men to have fought both Tszyu and Hatton - to assess the merits of the pair who will meet on June 4 in England.\n\nHe believes he has sparred more rounds with Tszyu than any Australian, and has also fought Hatton, although Rowsell was then past the peak of a career that included a top-five lightweight world ranking and Commonwealth Games silver medal.\n\nRowsell, who suffered just one loss in 34 professional bouts before fighting Hatton, said the Englishman wasn't especially skilful.\n\n\"History shows he is a tough guy but I don't think he's fought anyone with the power Kostya has,\" Rowsell said. \"I remember the first couple of punches I threw landed quite easily and thinking, 'This bloke's not that good'.\n\n\"He was quite easy to hit and that's one thing that rings home to me. He's been knocked down a few times, so he's obviously vulnerable. Everyone knows Kostya's quite accurate and if he hits you, you stay hit, so I think it's probably going to be curtains quite early for Ricky Hatton.\"\n\nTszyu's former sparring partner Lovemore Ndou agrees, saying the Englishman has \"next to no chance\".\n\n\"Kostya will walk straight through Hatton,\" said Ndou, who accurately predicted a quick KO for the world champion in his most recent fight, against Sharmba Mitchell. \"Hatton was hurt in the last round by Ben Tackie, a fighter Kostya battered non-stop, and he was pushed all the way by Eamonn Magee, a fighter not in Kostya's class.\""
