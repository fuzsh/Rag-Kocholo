        "text": "By Eliot Worsell: Still 11 weeks from lift-off and the cycle of propaganda has already begun revolving ahead of Kostya Tszyu's IBF light-welterweight title defence against Manchester's Ricky Hatton on June 4. All tickets were reportedly snapped up by punters within hours of release, and with similar haste Hatton's waistline appears to be expanding, Tszyu's thirst for battle focussed in alternative directions, and concerns being raised about the scheduled 2am start time. We're only midway through March and yet Tszyu and Hatton are already proving to be the most eagerly anticipated and talked about fight pairing in Great Britain for many a year.\n\nAmid so much feverish delirium however - borne out of pent-up frustration towards a dwindling domestic fight scene - it's easy to look past the monumental task awaiting Britain's most touted young championship class contender. Savage, uncompromising and utterly dominant at his current pedestal, WBU champion Hatton (a title defended 15 times), has been rallying with the aged masters players on court 18 for much of his eight year pro career, and now faces the world number one seed on centre. The transition from cheery, back and forth activity in his own domain to sharing the spotlight with a gloved up destroyer used to the perils of top-flight performance could not be greater.\n\nTszyu, the 35 year old, 140 lb skull cracker, labelled \"the greatest junior welterweight of all time\" by long time trainer Johnny Lewis, is a seasoned veteran with a merciless seek and destroy mindset which belies his child-like grin and courteous demeanour. Away from the ring Tszyu could pass for comic Al Bundy, inside it, he's closer to serial killer Ted.\n\nA professional since March 1992, Tszyu has competed in 17 world championship fights and steamrolled no fewer than 13 respected world titleholders. Born in Serov, Russia, and now residing in Sydney, Australia, Tszyu portrays the archetypal pugilist professional. Meticulous in preparation and brutal in presentation, the self-styled \"Thunder From Down Under\" has been the antithesis to paracetamol for 13 years, and still continues to crack craniums today.\n\nSlick Washington born 140 lber Sharmba Mitchell was on the receiving end of Tszyu's thunder last November, when the Australian native doubled for a handless clock in turning back the years to bludgeon his fierce rival in three rounds. Tszyu was coming off a significant two-year layoff as a result of injury and Mitchell had given Kostya all he could handle in a scrappy, foul filled affair three years previous. Unlike the conclusion of their past battle however, there would be no throw downs, twisted knees, corner retirements and complaints. The finishing message was clear, concise and delivered via Tszyu's scorching right and left gloves. It remains Kostya's last ring showing, and arguably, his most decisive.\n\nIf Tszyu is enjoying his post-strenuous career, honeymoon period though; Manchester body destroyer Ricky Hatton has only just purchased the engagement ring. Unbeaten in 38 contests, and victorious against respected 10 stone fighters Ben Tackie, Vince Phillips, Ray Oliveira and Mike Stewart, WBU titlist Hatton can still even up the vast amount of fans that religiously attend his bouts with detractors who claim he's proven nil and is riding the wave of the Manchester City induced fandom he enjoys. It's proved to be a contentious argument, with many US scribes remaining unconvinced, and UK rivals being just as vocal in proclaiming him to be a future title claimant. One thing's certain. At his current level, Ricky Hatton can fight and can pass go to 100 and 0 at the current fringe world-class level he inhabits - not that that approach would prove a great deal.\n\nHatton adds substance to the adage applied to most prospects that it's not who you're beating but the way in which you are beating them. The Mancunian doesn't just take the scalps of seasoned pros like Tackie and Phillips he leaves them in the starting blocks. Not even close. So one sided it becomes unsporting. Only in the opening two rounds against domestic rival and stiff hitting Irishman Eamonn Magee has Hatton ever appeared in a spot of bother at WBU title level. Had it not been for a torrid cuts problem that has proved to be a predicament in numerous fights, you're looking at an unbeaten, unflappable, young 140 lber who has seamlessly hustled his way towards this looming tilt at the world light welterweight championship with relative ease.\n\nSo, aside from his utter dominance at WBU championship level, what else does Ricky Hatton possess that can be used in his quest to dethrone a pre-eminent great like Tszyu?\n\n\"Rib-curdling body shots.\"\n\nHatton possesses one of the most lethal and incessant body assaults in world boxing today. Since his professional debut against Kid McAuley in 1997 Hatton's body digs have been exerting more damage on human livers than cheap liquor. At domestic and the lower reaches of world class, Hatton's punch picking downstairs has been too much for often overmatched foes. It's only in recent years, as Hatton's level of opposition has marginally increased, that proven stayers have been staying under the heat of Hatton's body and head combinations. The likes of Tackie, Phillips, Magee, and Argentinean Carlos Vilches have all recently lasted the full course with Hatton despite facing the full brunt of his body work.\n\nUnable to shift fringe contenders like the aforementioned, one may question what effect Hatton's relentless attacks will have on a renowned strongman like Tszyu. Yet consider the amounts of punches Hatton received off those that saw the 12th round, and you'll realise that not only does Hatton blast away and batter lesser men with his body rampage, he quenches and neutralises dangerous opponents, thus reducing them to shivering wrecks intent on surviving. Many fighters can survive if that is their sole intention.\n\n\"Pulverising right hands.\"\n\nThat's not to say Kostya Tszyu will go the same way of course. Opposing Hatton's body attacks will be a concussive right hand that has helped put away 25 of 31 opponents and earned Tszyu the recognition of being named the 67th biggest puncher of all time according to 'Ring Magazine'. Only Roger Mayweather, the slippery Turk Oktay Urkal, and the near bullet proof Ben Tackie have lasted to the final bell since Tszyu's ascension to champion status. For as much as Hatton's relentlessness can quell opponents, Tszyu's right hand can put them to sleep.\n\nTszyu isn't just a mere puncher either. The phrase 'box-puncher' is a buzzword uttered by many prizefighters claiming to be as such, but very few actually live up to the label. Tszyu, however, is the quintessential box-puncher. Turning pro with an amateur slate of 269 wins and 12 losses, Tszyu served his ring apprenticeship with the Soviet Union amateur system and formed foundations that have more levels, twists and variations to them than an Alfred Hitchcock script.\n\nAgainst Mitchell, Zab Judah, Diosbelys Hurtado, and other slick types, Tszyu mercilessly cuts down the ring and engages his opponent in his fight, yet alternatively, against rugged types, such as Julio Cesar Chavez, Rafael Ruelas, Miguel Angel Gonzalez and most recently Ben Tackie, Tszyu can be seen on the back foot, spearing his bewildered opponent with spiteful counterpunches until they are mercilessly bloodied, battered and halted by one more compassionate. It's an uncanny ability to adapt that has left Tszyu conqueror of all styles, and on top of his 140 lb landscape for so long.\n\n\"All right hand and little else?\"\n\nSo, Hatton, who can be diced up with a spatula rather than a knife, seemingly has little chance with the diverse Tszyu, right? Well, as with all top-flight operators, Tszyu's deficiencies are implicit, yet still evident if you look close enough.\n\nFirstly, he's primarily a headhunter, who despite chucking powerfully to the gut (ask Hurtado) often neglects the mid section unless he hurts his opponent to the head first. Everything tends to be lined up to nurture his dynamite right hand. His left jab peppers and frustrates, his left hook dissects, and his right hand paralyses. When Tszyu chooses too, he's a masterful technician, with all the shots in the book and more, but principally, while possessing so much firepower, his style is geared towards delivery of the destructive right cross. This makes Tszyu, at times, appear easy to read and one-dimensional. He also makes himself unnecessarily simple to hit when in pursuit of the finisher. Cuban hitter Hurtado scored two flash knockdowns of Tszyu in the first round of their 1998 dustup having been floored first, Columbian Hugo Pineda floored Tszyu in the opener, and of course, Floridian Vince Phillips handed Kostya his sole defeat via some heavy handed, accurate power punching.\n\n\"TNT and titanium - a rare combination.\"\n\nCommon opponent Phillips, however, was the beneficiary of a lacklustre Tszyu turning up, as well as his own concussive, often overlooked TNT coated fists in May 97'. Tszyu, so often callously hard on himself in training, readily admits he under prepared for the Phillips bout and suffered - and has changed accordingly. In terms of performance however, Phillips punctured holes in Tszyu's style and took him apart stage by stage via some colossal right crosses over Tszyu's lackadaisical left hand.\n\nRicky Hatton take note - or should he? After all, Hatton is no Vince Phillips. Against Tszyu, Phillips took numerous hard cracks flush on the jaw in the early rounds without shifting, in an attempt to gain the Russian's respect. Only then did 'Cool' Vince start raining his own artillery down on the IBF champion - and it was heavy, real heavy. Tszyu was felled in the 10th round in 'Ring Magazine's 1997 'Upset Of The Year'.\n\nHatton can easily match the work rate Phillips regularly clocks in (which unsettled the usually composed Tszyu), but one has to question whether he carries the one punch blast to put a dent in Tszyu, as well as a sturdy enough jaw to withstand Tszyu's early assaults in the manner Phillips did. Dynamite fists and titanium chin are a rare combination in prizefighting, and the kind of concoction needed to dethrone a champion like Tszyu. Remember, Phillips was a boiled down welterweight when he tackled Kostya in the twilight of his career. He'd suffered defeats, stoppage losses, and knew how to survive under fire from big punching 147 lbers.\n\n\"On-top fighter.\"\n\nHatton, on the otherhand, is the affable, happy go lucky 'bully' of the British boxing playground. The kind who pesters a classmate each day for dinner money only to pay him back the following day out of shame. He hunts, and hunts, until he chalks up the win. Very rarely do we see Hatton facing quandary in the form of his opponent's fists. Eamonn Magee's right hook was a sporadic success against Ricky, as was Vince Phillips' big right, but aside from those, the bully's victims have just found it all too much and succumbed to his diligent work rate. Once Hatton hits his industrious rhythm, trying to stop him is as fruitful as telling Stevie Wonder to stop playing the keyboard via hands signals.\n\nIn the form of Kostya Tszyu though - a man who has thrown big 10 stone fighters Chavez, Gonzalez, Mitchell, Ruelas around like rag dolls - Hatton will be facing the proposition of a malevolent counter assault from his victim. Rather than grassing to the teacher, or a payback prank, Hatton's victim in this case will be opening fire on him in a way never experienced before - and perhaps ominously - you don't require varifocals to open pores in this bully's defence.\n\n\"Experience.\"\n\nAs we've never seen Hatton face such a predicament it's difficult to forecast his fate. There are effectively two lines of thought though. Hatton has either been so well protected that he's had an easy-ish road to the top, and has subsequently looked a million bucks in each showing against timid opposition, or he has made his level of competition appear timid as a result of his tireless punch output and indefatigable attitude. Only in a bout of this magnitude will Hatton discover whether it is his own ring tools that have made for previous easy pickings or the business dexterity of his promotional team. That is the great wonder that shrouds a fight like this and a fighter like Hatton.\n\nConsider this: in their fourth and tenth fights respectively, the down to earth Hatton was crushing the hapless Paul Salmon and Paul Denton in northern leisure centres, while Tszyu was cutting his teeth against ex champions Juan LaPorte and Livingston Bramble over 10 rounds. It's almost different worlds in terms of competition and, arguably, ambition.\n\nWise, foolish, or poorly timed, Hatton's long awaited leap up in class has everyone talking and wondering just whether, Hatton, in similar fashion to Barry McGuigan's title triumph at Loftus Road in 1985 over Eusebio Pedroza, can overcome a whirlwind force on home soil and keep the title on this side of the Atlantic. With four of his last 10 ring outings going 12 rounds, there's no doubt Hatton is physically prepared to go out and attempt to wrest the most prestigious 140 lb title from its most esteemed proprietor. There's also no doubt that, at 26 years of age, nine years Tszyu's junior, Hatton appears to have the vigour of youth on his side against a veteran titlist who willingly admits that occupying the squared circle will never compare to time spent away from it with his wife and kids.\n\nNevertheless, Tszyu has proven just so prolific over the years its unwise to question his methods and motivation. Muhammad Ali once famously said that if he were a golfer he'd be the greatest golfer of all time, despite never playing the sport before. Though contrasting characters, Tszyu gives off the same sense of formidability and unbreakable desire to reach his goals.\n\nHatton meanwhile, must first discover himself before anything else. The time for soul searching will arrive on June 4, and we'll know more about Ricky Hatton the boxer in one, two, possibly six or twelve rounds, than we've ascertained so far in his drawn-out 38 fight professional career. Discovering oneself at the pit of Kostya Tszyu's fuming fists is an unenviable position for most, if not all, boxers in the junior welterweight class however. Discovery can be a little too close to brutal reality for some.\n\nMarch 13, 2005-03-14"
