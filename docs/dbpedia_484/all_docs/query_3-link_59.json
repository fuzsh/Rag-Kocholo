        "text": "Ricky Hatton was stopped in the ninth round of his eagerly anticipated comeback fight with Vyacheslav Senchenko, as a left hook sank the Hitman to his knees and rendered him unable to beat the count.\n\nSomewhat ironically, it was a left to the body – a body shot akin to Hatton’s signature knockout punch in his prime – that brought an end not only to the contest but to Ricky Hatton’s career.\n\nImmediately after the fight, Hatton announced his retirement from the sport for a second time but added that this time he would be content with hanging up the gloves for good. (Let’s hope that he does, because the Hatton that made Kostya Tszyu quit seven years ago, or even the Hatton that valiantly lost his unbeaten record to Floyd Mayweather Jr, would have overwhelmed the limited Ukrainian that was in the opposite corner last night.)\n\nIt had started brightly, with Hatton drawing the energy from the 20,000 adoring spectators that had bounced throughout his entrance. He looked like he was going for the knockout – maybe the plan was always to get Senchenko out of there early – and drove the much taller man back against the ropes, landing with punches but also being effective with the swings that were missing, as he was forcing the pace of the fight.\n\nSenchenko was accused of being mentally fragile when Paulie Malignaggi stopped him earlier this year and looked like a rabbit in the headlights at stages of the opening rounds. Hatton hurt him a number of times – evidenced by the fact that Senchenko felt the need to beckon Hatton on and proclaim that he wasn’t hurt – but as the fight wore on Hatton was missing more, his timing was out and his opponent began to dictate the fight with his piston like jab.\n\nBy the sixth Senchenko was in control and was beginning to land more shots. Hatton’s tank was running low, gassed out already and no doubt appreciative that he had only scheduled a ten rounder. But he wouldn’t see out the ten rounds, as despite a late burst that may have nicked him the seventh and some good work on the inside early in the eighth, Senchenko brought about the finish in the ninth session with a powerful left hook to the ribs.\n\nHatton will understand what Jose Luis Castillo felt when he finished the Mexican with a similar shot in 2007. In the crowd that had been so buoyant earlier, suddenly you could hear a pin drop. It was a sad ending to the occasion, but maybe a blessing in disguise.\n\nPrior to the bout Hatton’s two defeats had come only at the absolute highest level against Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. On last night’s evidence he would not be able to venture anywhere near that level again. Better that he gave his best, exorcised his demons and if nothing else gave his adoring fans a farewell on home soil, than to face a repeat of the crushing Pacquiao loss.\n\nIn the build-up to the bout, the talk was of a big money rematch with Malignaggi should Hatton be victorious. Despite the protestations of Richard Schaefer, that fight will not happen now. It’s a little unfortunate, as both men are great characters and it would be a great event in the UK. A Malignaggi and Senchenko rematch warrants little interest.\n\nBut less of the sombre feeling, as Ricky Hatton has gone out on his shield. He might not be the best pound-for-the-pound fighter that Britain has even produced, but he’s the most loved. His fights were a fantastic attraction, he’s a two-weight world champion and there was a time in the mid-2000s when he was the best light welterweight in the world.\n\nThanks for the memories Ricky.\n\nMany boxers fight on well past their primes, plenty enter in-an-out of retirement, but few retire when they should and stay retired and even fewer retire at the top of the game. Sometimes when a fighter returns its to fill the void that’s left in their lives, unable to cope with the empty hours that were once spent in arduous preparation for a fight. Sometimes it’s the money if a fighter has not found something else to call a day job. And sometimes it’s the acclaim, the adoration of fans and the roar of a crowd on fight night, or even the buzz of being under the ring lights, in front of the cameras, with the whole world watching. Very rarely, it’s for the right reasons.\n\nIn recent weeks speculation has been brewing that one Richard John Hatton is set to make a return to the ring, having shed a considerable amount of weight and abstained from alcohol over the last three months. The former two-weight world champion known as ‘The Hitman’ last fought in May 2009 when at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas he was knocked out cold inside two rounds by a ferocious Manny Pacquiao. It was a devastating defeat, the manner of which was unexpected and triggered a number of personal battles for Hatton. He was involved in a News of the World cocaine scandal, had his professional boxing licence revoked without making the decision to retire himself and spent many sleepless nights replaying the Pacquiao fight in his head. He has talked on occasion of how he is not happy with the manner in which he left the sport. But taking everything into account, that isn’t a good enough reason to return. And certainly not now.\n\nStay retired Ricky.\n\nHatton risks tarnishing a legacy of a fantastic career, one of the best in British boxing history, with the only blemishes coming against the two best fighters of his generation. A prime Ricky Hatton was on display in his knockout victory over Jose Luis Castillo in 2007, the fight he ended with a crushing body shot in the fourth and earned him the shot at Floyd Mayweather Jr for a clash between two undefeated champions, in which Hatton put in a gutsy performance only to be worn down by the American in the later rounds. His career had really kicked on since 2005 after he retired odds-on favourite and recent Hall-of-Fame inductee Kostya Tszyu to become a world champion in one of British boxing’s greatest ever nights at the M.E.N Arena in Manchester. He then went on to have a number of big wins on American soil.\n\nOne of those was an eleventh round stoppage of Paulie Malignaggi at the MGM Grand and when rumours of a Hatton return first circulated it was ‘The Magic Man’ who was touted as a target opponent. The light punching Malignaggi is a great boxer and a tricky opponent for most but just didn’t have the firepower to hold off Hatton when they met, has a measly knockout percentage alongside his record and is maybe considered as an easy route back into boxing for Ricky, in that he is a big name but caused him few problems last time out. But Malignaggi would be more than a handful for Hatton now. The Hitman hasn’t fought for over three years and all his fighting attributes will have no doubt diminshed, not to mention that Malignaggi has reinvigorated his career since moving up to welterweight and now holds a version of the 147lb world title. A loss to Malignaggi would be incredibly damaging and even if Hatton did win – a big if -where exactly would he go from there? A fight with anyone near the level of Pacquiao again and he’ll be taken apart.\n\nHatton believes that there were a number of problems with his preparation in the build-up to the Pacquiao fight, and he’s right. His style was altered under the guidance of Floyd Mayweather Sr – who was late for a number of training sessions and with whom Hatton had a colossal personality clash – he over-trained, made the weight very early and on the night he got his tactics all wrong, rushing onto Pacquiao after being caught cold in the first round and paying for it brutally with the fight’s conclusion in the second. But what Hatton won’t admit is that there is another reason why he got his preparation wrong for Pacquiao and it was an issue that was far more long-term and stretched back throughout his career as a world level fighter. Blowing up in weight between fights.\n\nRicky took observations about his weight light-heartedly, the fun-loving character that he is. After being christened ‘Ricky Fatton’ by Floyd Mayweather in the build-up to their December 2007 bout Hatton regularly donned a fat-suit for his ring walks to fights and even had the customised theme song that included the lyrics: ‘He’s never seen a salad, he ate all the pies’. Ever the comedian, he also claimed that the reason he piled on the pounds was because he ‘had a lot on his plate’ and loved nothing more than to sink a few pints of Guinness whilst playing darts with the boys down the local. He would not be Ricky Hatton if you took that side away from him, but at the elite level in any sport to remain a champion you have to prepare like a champion.\n\nIt has long been known that big fluctuations in weight – particularly moving up in weight and coming back down again – negatively affect punch resistance. This is thought to be exacerbated by the rate at which a fighter’s weight fluctuates. Hatton was rumoured to be at around 180 pounds at the height of his indulgences between contests – roughly three stone above his prefered light welterweight limit – and then would boil down to the weight over the course of a 12-week training camp, meaning he would lose a stone a month taken as an average. When you lose weight you lose water and if your regular water resources are depleted, as they would be under drastic weight loss, your body goes into survival mode and draws water from other places such as the brain. The required level of water on the brain protects it from the skull in a head trauma, but when there is a less water around the brain a blow to the head is more likely to cause the brain to rattle against the skull, resulting in a knockout. The left hook that finished Hatton in the Pacquiao fight was well-timed, well executed and landed ‘bang on the chin’ as Jim Watt would say, but the Filipino has never knocked anyone clean out quite like that before or since and Hatton had survived shots by big punchers a number of times earlier on in his career. He withstood huge punches at the end of his fight with former Ring Magazine Knockout of the Year winner Ben Tackie, had come through a war with John Thaxton albeit at British level, shook off punches from Tszyu, Maussa, Urango, Castillo and even at welterweight with Collazo.\n\nAfter years of ballooning and having to come down in weight taking a toll on his punch resistance and having come through a number of tough fights, Ricky Hatton wasn’t physically prepared for the great Manny Pacquiao. Now, more than three years further down the line having not been living the lifestyle of a boxer the Hitman would not be physically prepared to make a comeback. It was sad to see Hatton flat on his back in the MGM Grand and it’s not the way anyone would have wanted him to bow out, but better he lost to a great fighter then to go on too far and lose to fighters well below his level. Boxing history is littered with ex-champions that couldn’t let go and who have forever tarnished their reputations, particularly recent history.\n\nJust last week, Evander Holyfield – the once great former four-time World Heavyweight Champion and arguably the greatest cruiserweight of all time – issued a challenge to either of the Kilitschko brothers, stating his intention to fight on despite being 49 years of age and having fought a long list of journeymen since a run of three consecutive defeats initially retired him in 2004. Incidentally, Holyfield recently paid a visit to Hatton’s new health & fitness centre whilst over for the Olympic Games and the Hitman talked of being in awe of the Heavyweight legend whilst showing him around and discussing his training and promotional work with Hatton Promotions. It’s one thing to look up to a man like Holyfield, a true legend who was great in his prime and an inspiration, but he’s also a somewhat delusional character whose recent career has been far from inspirational and whose slurred speech illustrates that fighting on too far can have drastic consequences to health as well as legacy.\n\nStick to your training and promotional work Ricky, which with your fan base the sky is the limit. You’ve already acquired legendary status as a fighter and have absolutely nothing to prove, you’re the most supported British boxer in history and you will be remembered for the great nights when you could take 16,000 Englishmen across the Atlantic and conquer Las Vegas, not to mention the career-defining destruction of the great Kostya Tszyu in front of your adoring Manchester.\n\nThere’s only one Ricky Hatton."
