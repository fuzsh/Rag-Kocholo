As her motorcade parked, President Akufo-Addo came to the entrance of the building and said hello to his staffers.\n\nThe VP's motorcade pulled up to a gate outside, where a red carpet stretched to the front door of the building. On either side of the red carpet stood what appeared to be an honor guard dressed in either red or blue formal uniforms, some playing drums and the US national anthem. Harris took time to shake the hands of members of the guard. Your pooler, in the press area just inside the entrance of the building, only had partial visibility of the ceremony outside.\n\nAs President Akufo-Addo waited for Harris, a reporter asked what his message would be to the VP.

She said President Akufo-Addo had been \"courageous about standing for democratic principles.\"\n\n\"I thank you for the friendship you have offered to the United States,\" she said.

He said certain people found refuge in Mali and are \"using Mali as a base for spreading poison across the west of west Africa.\"\n\nHe went on to say a portion of Burkina Faso is \"run by terrorists.\" It sounds like he said the north of the country but tough to hear the exact quote.\n\nBelow you will also find background information from the bilateral:\n\nBumping the bilateral meeting background with updates, including the names of today's program participants.\n\nBILATERAL MEETING WITH PRESIDENT AKUFO-ADDO OF GHANA\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will meet with President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana at Jubilee House and affirm the strength of our bilateral relationship, and the long-standing ties between the American and Ghanaian people.\n\nThe Vice President and President Akufo-Addo will discuss a range of global and regional issues including: democracy, good governance, and human rights; regional security; long-term economic growth and macroeconomic stability; and our work together on the UN Security Council.\n\nOn democracy, good governance, and human rights, they will discuss efforts to stand up for democratic principles on the continent and our shared opposition to recent democratic backsliding.\n\nOn regional security, they will discuss the Sahel and efforts to promote stability, including through new U.S. funding for stabilization efforts.\n\nOn debt, the Vice President will re-affirm the U.S. position that all bilateral creditors should provide meaningful debt reduction and express support for Ghana's engagement with the IMF.

White curtains draped the sides of the hall. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling. Guests in tuxedos, traditional attire and gowns sat on white chairs at long dining tables stretched across the room.\n\nA band played at the back of the room. At the front, a head table was behind a lectern. Officials in suits and traditional attire sat behind the candlelit table.\n\nAt 8 PM, many of the vice presidents staffers entered the hall, along with Black American civil rights leaders, activists and celebrities.\n\nAt 8:08 PM, the Vice President and President Akufo-Addo entered the state banquet. They were trailed by the Second Gentleman and First Lady of Ghana.\n\nThe leaders took their seats and were introduced by a moderator.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo was the first to speak. He stepped to the lectern and welcomed the VP and her staff.\n\n\"She was elected the vice president of the United States of America,\" he said. \"The first female and the first person of African and Asian descent to occupy that office.\" The crowd broke in applause.\n\n\"My hope is that our two nations and peoples will continue to deepen the bonds of friendship and collaboration between us,\" the president said, adding that both Ghana and the United States were committed to democratic values and human rights.\n\nHe then tacked through the history of U.S. politicians and civil rights leaders who visited Ghana, including Martin Luther King Jr. He talked about how President Clinton visited in 1998, President Bush visited in 2008 and President Obama. He also noted President Trump's \"failure\" to visit, prompting laughs from the crowd.\n\nHe said he hoped President Biden would resume the tradition.\n\n\"We're encouraged by the fact more United States companies are looking to invest in Ghana,\" he said.\n\nHe also said the VP's honorary Ghanaian name would be \"Abena,\" meaning one who is born on Tuesday. He spoke for roughly 20 minutes.\n\nThe VP then gave her toast. She began by commenting on the shooting in Tennessee.\n\n\"We don't have all the details yet,\" Harris said. \"We do know that because of this terrible act of violence, parents have lost children, families have lost loved ones and this community has been changed forever. To the people of Nashville, please know we are thinking of you. You are in our prayers.\"\n\nShen then moved on to her toast. She spoke for about 10 minutes.\n\n\"You take great joy in reminding us all that where we come from should always bid a glorious vision of where ultimately can be,\" Harris said.\n\nShe said members of the diaspora from all over the world have traveled to Ghana to learn about their history and the legacy of slavery.\n\n\"President Joe Biden and I are committed to celebrating and strengthening the longstanding ties that connect our people and our nation. These ties are a source of pride,\" she said.\n\nShe said it's been an honor to work with Afuko-Addo.\n\nWe were led out at roughly 8:45 PM."
