        "text": "OK we've done Oscar vs Crawford time for Tszyu vs him\n\nAmateur record\n\nTszyu 259-11 (I've also seen it listed as 260-10)\n\nCrawford's 70-12\n\nSo Crawford incurred more loses in 82 fights than Tszyu did in 270 even though he fought at a much lower level than Tszyu\n\nAnd obviously Tszyu's amateur accomplishments>>>Crawford's by a country mile\n\nTszyu's opponent's win/loss ratio\n\nTszyu 1064-130 loses\n\nCrawford 514-205\n\nNumber of world champions fought\n\nTszyu 15 (13-2)\n\nCrawford 4 (4-0)\n\nNumber of world title fights\n\nTszyu 18\n\nCrawford 10\n\nNumber of times fought on the road\n\nTszyu 15 including unifying twice in his opponent's country and winning his first world title in his opponent's country too. So he won all his world titles in his opponent's country and defended his titles many times on the road and in his opponent's country\n\nCrawford 1 for his first world title fight\n\nObviously winning on the road or in your opponent's home country is more difficult for a number of different reasons and more impressive than beating them in your backyard/country where often everything is stacked in your favour and against them. Beating Zab Judah or Sharmba Mitchell in their country>>>beating them in Australia or Russia. Winning away>>winning at home.\n\nCrawford has fought outside of his country once, whereas Tszyu did it 15 times, 15 fights on the road out of 33 fights.\n\nMiguel Angel Gonzalez 43-1-3\n\nZab Judah 27-0-0\n\nSharmba Mitchell 47-2-0 & (55-3-0 for the rematch)\n\nDiosbelys Hurtado 28-1\n\nJake Rodriguez 26-2-2\n\nRafael Ruelas 52-3\n\nOktay Urkal 28-0-0\n\nJulio Cesar Chavez 103-4-2\n\nHector Lopez 26-2-1\n\nHugo Pineda 27-0-1\n\nJan Bergman 32-0-0\n\nBen Tackie 24-2-0\n\nJesse James Leija 43-5-2\n\nAngel Hernandez 40-1-2\n\nRoger Mayweather 54-11-0\n\nPedro Sanchez 26-1-2\n\nCorey Johnson 20-1-1\n\nAnd in his 4th fight he fought Juan Laporte 37-11-1\n\nIn his 6th Sammy Fuentes. Fuentes went on to pick up the WBO JWW strap later on in his career\n\n10th Livingstone Bramble\n\nLaporte, Bramble and Mayweather were past their best but they were still solid opponents for world class fighters.\n\nBeating Laporte in your 4th pro fight>>>>tomato can Aaron Anderson 0-0-0 now 3-48-0.\n\nBeating Sammy Fuentes in your 6th fight>>>can Travis Hartmen 9-10-1\n\nBeating Livingstone Bramble in your 10th fight>>>can Cory Summerville 1-3-0\n\nBeating Hector Lopez in your 11th fight>>>can Marty Robbins 23-45-1\n\nTszyu was fighting some very solid guys from early on in his career, Crawford didn't even get in there with anyone with a pulse until he was 19-0\n\nCrawford\n\nPostol 28-0\n\nDiaz 19-1\n\nIndongo 22-0\n\nBeltran 29-6-1\n\nGamboa 23-0\n\nBurns 36-2-1\n\nDulorme 22-1\n\nMolina 29-6\n\nKlimov 16-0\n\nLundy 26-5-1\n\nJean 29-1\n\nPresscott 26-4\n\nSanabria 34-1-1\n\nShout out to @BoppaZoo as this post was inspired by an old one of his\n\nNo-one has addressed the elephant in the room - Tszyu's losses.\n\nBoth came when he was underdone in terms of fights leading into the fateful days (or nights as the case may have been).\n\nAs an obvious statement, both losses were extremely hard fought wars of attrition. Saying \"Tszyu quit\" in the Hatton fight ignores the fact his corner pulled him out after receiving a non-response to the question of was he okay to continue. He was obviously gone and should not have continued. It's debatable whether he even understood what he was being asked - but I digress.\n\nThere were a number of issues that contributed to the Vince Phillips loss, the two most important being:\n\n1. Phillips, a decent fighter with good punching power, fought a great fight, and\n\n2. Tszyu's lack of competitive action leading into the fight meant he was underdone going in and ultimately not capable of withstanding such an unexpectedly strong challenge.\n\nThe seeds for the Vince Phillips loss were sewn when Tszyu's management chose Leonardo Mas as an opponent in his previous fight instead of Charles Murray (a decent American who would have given Tszyu rounds). Mas was hopeless, couldn't stay upright and was stopped easily in the first. The ref ruled technical draw for a late punch which at the time, stained Tszyu's perfect record. Tszyu spent much of the lead-up to the Phillips fight upset about that as well as losing a court case to his former promoter. While they were distractions out of the ring I think the fact Tszyu didn't get any meaningful work against Mas (following on from a couple of one-sided fights in Australia the previous year) left him vulnerable in his next fight. Tszyu's management should have chosen Charles Murray who would not have taken a dive in the first round. They were offered both potential opponents & chose Mas presumably believing he was an easier fight for the same money. They were right about that but I reckon it cost them next fight.\n\nThere were lots of other reasons given for the Vince Phillips loss but I think it was as simple as Phillips being fight hardened coming in (he lost a tough 10-rounder not long before) & Kostya Tszyu being underdone (as a consequence of opponent choices made by his own management).\n\nThe moral of the story is it's a fine line in boxing & timing is everything.\n\nTszyu had long stretches of inactivity leading into the Hatton fight & was underdone for that one as well. Probably shouldn't have been fighting at that weight at that time either. He looked like a corpse at the weigh-in. In saying that, he looked terrific against Sharmba Mitchell in his previous fight (despite also looking like a corpse at the weigh-in) but that one didn't last very long either.\n\nWhen you find yourself in a tough war of attrition, you need some tough hard rounds behind you in order to prevail at the back end of the fight.\n\nTszyu didn't have them going into either the Vince Phillips or Ricky Hatton fights."
