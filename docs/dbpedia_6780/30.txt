The National Student/Parent Mock Election actively engages students in state and national campaigns to emphasize the importance of voting and the power of their ballots. On October 30th, students and parents across the country cast their votes for the candidate they believe should be the next President of the United States.

The Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is the Massachusetts state headquarters for the Mock Election, and provided curriculum materials and activities to assist teachers throughout the state in preparing their students to vote. Each participating school chose a coordinator to be responsible for distributing the mock election ballots and materials to all students, teachers, and interested parents in the school, and reporting the election results to election headquarters at the Kennedy President Library on October 30.

Representatives at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum warned that the results are not and cannot be considered a scientific sampling. Among the mock elections of the National Student/Parent Mock Election, there is no uniformity of participation, age levels, preparation of voters, or voting strategies, and therefore, the election results are not representative of any voting trend of the American public. The results should not and cannot be used as an accurate prediction, or as the basis for an accurate prediction, of real election results.

Some schools also participated in position questions. Votes were tabulated for those schools participating in this portion of the election, and those results are listed below:
