The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m., in room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Honorable Jerrold Nadler (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Nadler, Conyers, Watt, Jackson Lee, Sensenbrenner, King and Gohmert. Staff present: LaShawn Warren, Majority Counsel; Kanya Bennett, Majority Counsel; David Lachmann, Subcommittee Chief of Staff; and Paul Taylor, Minority Counsel. Mr. Nadler. This hearing of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties will now come to order. I will recognize myself for a 5-minute opening statement, which will not take 5 minutes. Today's hearing looks at the 2008 elections to see what lessons we can learn to improve election administration and the protection of voting rights in the future Although we were thankfully spared another national election in which the result was questioned by large numbers of Americans, there were still problems encountered by voters across the country. In too many instances, legally qualified voters were robbed of their right to vote either by poor administration, by excessively cumbersome procedures, or by efforts designed to disenfranchise them. In the world's leading democracy, that is simply intolerable. There is no more important right than the right to exercise the franchise freely, fairly, and without fear or intimidation. Our Nation's history is one of expanding inclusion. We have expanded the franchise to include all persons, regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude or gender or age. We have enacted the Voting Rights Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Motor Voter law. We recently renewed the Voting Rights Act with almost no dissent, thanks to the leadership of the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin sitting uncharacteristically to my left and the distinguished Chairman of the full Committee. But rights on paper are not the same as rights in fact. For that, we need vigorous enforcement. Efforts by both official and private parties to suppress the vote, especially of certain groups targeted by race or belief, are unacceptable. Even when the culprit is poor management, the result is the same and still unacceptable. I am eager to hear from our outstanding panels of witnesses today so we can take your guidance as to how best to improve the process for the future. I would yield back the rest of my time. The Chair will now recognize the distinguished Ranking Member for 5 minutes for an opening statement. Mr. Sensenbrenner. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The legitimacy of our elected leaders depends upon the legitimacy of our election process. During the last election, one organization became notorious for threatening that legitimacy through a massive campaign of improper election activity. That organization is called ACORN, and its actions cry out for investigation by this Committee. We will hear much more about ACORN from some of our witnesses today, but by way of general background, let me read sections of ACORN's extensive rap sheet which spans from coast to coast. In Seattle, local prosecutors indicted seven ACORN workers following a scheme the Washington secretary of state called the worst case of voter registration vote in the state's history. Of the 2,000 names submitted by ACORN, only nine were confirmed as valid. The rest--over 97 percent--were fake. In Missouri, officials found that over 1,000 voter addresses submitted by ACORN did not exist. Eight ACORN employees pled guilty to Federal election fraud there. In Ohio, an employee of one ACORN affiliate was given crack cocaine in exchange for fraudulent registrations that included underage voters and dead people. Last year, in Pennsylvania, a former ACORN worker was charged with 19 counts of perjury, making false statements, forgery, and identity theft. In my own State of Wisconsin, the special investigations unit of the Milwaukee Police Department issued a report that concluded eight people were sworn in as deputy registrars who are convicted felons under the supervision of the Division of Corrections. ACORN was their sponsoring organization. The 67-page Wisconsin report generally describes what it calls an illegal organized attempt to influence the outcome of the 2004 election in the State of Wisconsin. The report found that between 4,600 and 5,300 more votes were counted in Milwaukee than the number of voters recorded as having cast ballots. Mike Sandvick, the head of the special investigative unit, said the problems his unit found in 2004 were only the tip of the iceberg of what could happen today. Another former ACORN field director reported ACORN threw out Republican registrations and paid cash for Democrat registrations. In the end, during the 2008 election, ACORN's executive director had to admit that of the 1.3 million new voters ACORN claimed to have registered, only a third of those 450,000 were legitimate and that the organization was forced to fire 829 of the canvassers it hired for job-related problems, including falsifying registration forms. Astonishingly, in the face of all this, a lawyer for President Obama's election campaign wrote a letter to the Justice Department demanding that it investigate not ACORN, but the McCain campaign for daring to mention what the campaign lawyer referred to as unsupported spurious allegations of vote fraud. But the President should be particularly concerned with ACORN's behavior because, as it was reported last year, his presidential campaign paid more than $800,000 to an offshoot of ACORN for services it misrepresented in Federal reports. The Obama campaign initially reported the ACORN affiliate used the money for polling, advance work, and event staging, but really it used the money for the same projects that has mired ACORN in criminal investigations in at least 12 states. Beyond voting fraud, a recent article in The New York Times revealed just how shady ACORN's financial operations can be, stating, ``ACORN chose to treat the embezzlement of nearly $1 million as an internal matter and did not even notify its board or law enforcement.'' The New York Times also reported that, ``An internal investigation revealed the potentially improper use of charitable dollars for political purposes, illicit money transfers, and potential conflicts created by employees working for multiple affiliates.'' It is tragic enough when voluntary donations are used illegally, but when ACORN also receives millions of taxpayer dollars and it is eligible to receive millions more under the wasteful spending bill that Congress just passed--as it turned out, the 2008 presidential election was not close, and when elections are not close, vote fraud too often goes uninvestigated, but as elected representatives, we have a special responsibility to ensure that only legal voters are registered and that only legal votes are cast and counted. I thank the Chair. Mr. Nadler. The Chair now recognizes the distinguished Chairman of the full Committee for 5 minutes. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and friends. This may be the most important part of the Judiciary Committee's work, and yet out of 17 Members of the Committee, we have five here--Steve King is around in the back--no press, and I think that tells a story in itself. Now everything in a democratic system turns on the fairness of the voting process, to choose who governs, at every level, and this is not about just looking at the last election. It is about looking at the history of elections in this country. We have come through two presidential elections that were highly controversial. We have never had the Supreme Court decide a presidential election before. And what went wrong in Ohio is now a part of history. We have people in this country for whom it is made so inconvenient to vote, that they frequently do not get a chance to vote. Then you have another group of people who have given up on the voting process, that they just say, look, it is not going to change very much anyway. And to have the former Chairman of the Committee worry about ACORN as if that is a serious problem, why don't we, Steve, have a hearing on ACORN? Let's bring in everybody and go through it, but just venting about it like this is some sinister group I do not think reflects well on the seriousness of why we are, and there are a lot of attitudes about voting, this whole phenomena of voter ID that is sweeping the country, all of these allegations about fraud in voting. I think we found the Department of Justice had about 86 cases over a period of years. In Michigan, we used to have hordes of suits come into Detroit to challenge people voting--at their own physical risk, I might add--but the whole idea is that we are going to get rid of some of this fraudulent voting. We are going to challenge people. They really had a ball for a while. They were snatching papers away from election workers, and police were coming out to get them safely out of election places. So I am interested in how we can get a more positive attitude about voting in America, and it has to come from the Federal Government, and the celebration about the victory of the 44th President really signals how much people do not understand the depth of this problem. We have some very serious problems, and because of the state jurisdiction on much of this, it is not easy. It is not like the feds can come in on each and every election problem. With redistricting, the courts just did us a great for. Thanks a lot, Supreme Court, for the earlier decision this week that rather complicated the process. So I look forward to the witnesses. I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member for bringing us together today. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of seeing to our witnesses and mindful of our busy schedules, I ask that other Members submit their statements for the record. Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days to submit opening statements for inclusion in the record. Without objection, the Chair will be authorized to declare a recess of the hearing, if necessary to do so. We will now turn to our first panel of witnesses. As we ask questions of our witnesses, the Chair will recognize Members in the order of their seniority on the Subcommittee, alternating between majority and minority, provided that the Member is present when his or her turn arrives. Members who are not present when their turns begin will be recognized after the other Members have had the opportunity to ask their questions. Of course, that assumes that that is a relevant consideration today. The Chair reserves the right to accommodate a Member who is unavoidably late or only able to be with us for a short time. Our first panel consists of four witnesses. Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, is our first witness. In 2004, Ms. Arnwine was the leader of the non-partisan Election Protection Coalition which helped to organize 8,000 lawyers to accept calls from voters and serve as poll monitors in over 28 states. The Election Protection Voter Assistance Program continues to thrive today under her leadership. Ms. Arnwine is a graduate of Scripps College and Duke University School of Law. Matthew Segal is the founder and executive director of the Student Association for Voter Empowerment, SAVE, a Washington, DC-based, non-partisan, non-profit organization funded and run by students with a mission to increase youth voter turnout by removing barriers to participation and promoting stronger civic education. Mr. Segal was appointed a senior research fellow and national democracy coordinator for the Roosevelt Institution, a 7,000-member national student think tank. Additionally, he serves on Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner's Voting Rights Advisory Council, guides regular workshops and panels on youth voter mobilization and voter participation trends, and contributes a blog to The Huffington Post. Heather Heidelbaugh--and I hope I pronounced that correctly--is a shareholder in the litigation services group of Babst, Calland, Clements & Zomnir--I hope I pronounced that correctly, too--and vice president of the Republican National Lawyers Association. Ms. Heidelbaugh has substantial experience practicing election law and has frequently lectured on the topic. Previously, she served as the Bush-Cheney 2004 Pennsylvania election counsel. Ms. Heidelbaugh received a B.A. in economics and political science from the University of Missouri-Columbia, where she also earned her J.D. And, finally, Dr. James Thomas Tucker is a consulting attorney for the Native American Rights Fund. Currently, he is co-counsel in Nick v. Bethel, Alaska, the first language assistance and voter assistance case brought under the Voting Rights Act on behalf of Alaskan natives. Previously, he worked on behalf of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials to secure the 25-year re-authorization of the Voting Rights Act, and he has served as a senior trial attorney with the voting section of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. Dr. Tucker holds doctor of the science of laws and master of laws degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, a juris doctorate degree with high honors Order of the Coif from the University of Florida, and a master in public administration degree from the University of Oklahoma. He received undergraduate degrees in history from Barrett Honors College at Arizona State University. I am pleased to welcome all of you. Your written statements in their entirety will be made part of the record. I would ask each of you to summarize your testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light, I should say, at your table. When 1 minute remains, the light will switch from green to yellow, and then red when the 5 minutes are up. You may be seated. The first witness for 5 minutes is Ms. Arnwine. TESTIMONY OF BARBARA B. ARNWINE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW Ms. Arnwine. Okay. There we go. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to this hearing today. My name is Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The Lawyers' Committee leads Election Protection, the Nation's largest non- partisan voter protection and education effort. This historic coalition brought together hundreds of national, statewide, and local organizations, and law firms in common purpose to provide eligible voters with the tools they need to cast a ballot that counts. Through our state-of-the-art 866-OUR-VOTE hotline, interactive Web tools, and comprehensive field programs, we directly helped over a half a million voters in 2008's historic election. This election exemplified a stark dichotomy in which we saw a historic election of unexpected voter participation take place against a background of persistent barriers and chicanery. We have a duty to make our elections open to all eligible citizens, conduct them fairly, and make them transparent so all Americans have confidence in the electoral system today. Today, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your leadership in reintroducing the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2009, which helps thwart deliberate attempts by political operatives to confuse, deceive, and intimidate voters at the polls. In addition, this Committee has played a lead role in exposing the failures of the Justice Department in previous Administrations, particularly in the area of voting rights. These two issues-- the need for Federal legislation banning deceptive practices and Justice Department enforcement of Federal voting rights protections--are the focus of my testimony today. Our Election Protection experience in the last several cycles has confirmed an unfortunate reality: Deceptive practices--that is false information designed to mislead voters about the time, place, and manner of elections--has become an endemic problem. For example, in 2004, there were flyers from the fictitious Milwaukee Black Voters League telling voters that if they had voted in the primary or if anyone in their family had been guilty of any infraction, even a traffic ticket, they could not vote in the presidential election and would be imprisoned for 10 years if they voted. In 2008, Election Protection received almost daily reports, in the weeks leading up to the election, of deceptive practices. Flyers, robocalls, emails, text messages, and online social networking programs such as Facebook were all used to deliver false voter information. One egregious example occurred on the campus of George Mason University. An email circulated around the campus purportedly from Provost Peter Stearns informing students and staff that the election had been postponed until Wednesday, November 5. Later, Stearns sent a message revealing that someone had hacked into the system and that voting would indeed take place ``today, November 4.'' We believe Congress should prioritize the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Act for this year. An effort to make it ``unlawful for anyone before or during a Federal election to knowingly communicate, or attempt to communicate, false election-related information about the election with the intent to prevent another person from exercising the right to vote,'' is directly responsive to the type of problems that voters encounter. The Deceptive Practices Act and extended enforcement therein establishes a clear standard of law: If you intend to deceive voters, you will be punished. Mr. Chairman, you deserve our utmost appreciation for your continued attention to this matter. The Bush administration's underenforcement of section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 disenfranchised millions of poor Americans. Section 7 requires public assistance agencies to provide voter registration applications and offer assistance to individuals applying for benefits. Congress included section 7 to make sure that people who are poor and vulnerable would not be disadvantaged in voter registration because they did not have driver licenses and thus would not be registered under the motor voter provisions of the NVRA. The Lawyers' Committee has been working with Demos and Project Vote on a national effort to enforce section 7. In the last reporting period of the United States Election Assistance Commission, officials received only 500,000 applications from public assistance offices as compared to 16.5 million applications from motor vehicle offices. We estimate that more than half of the states are in violation of section 7. For most of the Bush Justice Department years, section 7 non-compliance was ignored. The department brought only one case under section 7 in Tennessee where it was part of a larger NVRA case. It was not until 2008 that the Bush Justice Department began taking its responsibilities seriously by reaching out-of-court settlements in Illinois and Arizona. Active section 7 enforcement can make a difference. Last year, the Lawyers' Committee filed suit against Missouri's Department of Social Services in ACORN v. Scott. In July, the district court granted our motion for preliminary injunction and ordered an interim remedial plan. In the first 6\\1/2\\ months under the remedial plan, the Department of Social Services registered nearly 80,000 people, a 2,000 percent increase as compared to the 2005-2006 reporting period. If there was full compliance with section 7, instead of a paltry 270,000 people being registered per year by social services agencies, 2 to 3 million poor people would be registered to vote. Mr. Chairman, thank you and the Committee for the opportunity to testify today, and I would be happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Arnwine follows:] Prepared Statement of Barbara R. Arnwine Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to this hearing today. My name is Barbara Arnwine, Executive Director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The Lawyers' Committee leads Election Protection, the nation's largest nonpartisan voter protection and education effort. This historic coalition brought together hundreds of national, statewide and local organizations in common purpose to provide eligible voters with the tools they need to cast a ballot that counts. Through our state of the art 866-OUR-VOTE hotline, interactive web tools and comprehensive field programs, we directly helped over half a million voters in 2008's historic election. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your leadership in combating deceptive voting practices. As you know, voters across the country still have to navigate through deliberate attempts by political operatives to confuse, deceive and intimidate them as they try to vote. In particular, I thank Chairman Conyers for reintroducing the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2009. This bill will not only prevent these practices under federal law, but will provide the necessary administrative remedies to ensure quick dissemination of correct information to the affected communities in ways they trust. In addition, this Committee has played a lead role in exposing the failures of the Justice Department in the previous Administration, particularly in the area of voting rights. These two issues--the need for federal legislation banning deceptive practices and Justice Department enforcement of federal voting rights protections--are the focus of my testimony today. The Lawyers' Committee, founded 46 years ago, by President Kennedy enlists the private bar in providing legal services to address racial discrimination. Since our inception, voting rights has been at the core of our work. Just yesterday, we filed our brief in the United States Supreme Court in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Austin, where we assert that Congress acted within its broad authority to enforce the guarantees against voting discrimination in the 14th and 15th Amendments when it reauthorized Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act three years ago. In the aftermath of the 2000 election debacle, we cofounded Election Protection to monitor and mitigate problems and to help ensure that all voters have an equal opportunity to participate in the political process. In 2005, we created an initiative within the Voting Rights Project of the Lawyers' Committee--the National Campaign for Fair Elections--to lead Election Protection and the Lawyers' Committee's efforts to reform the election process. The 2008 Election Protection program was our most ambitious voter education and protection effort in history. Election Protection built the largest voter protection and education effort yet, bringing together civil rights advocates, diverse community partners, media and concerned citizens to safeguard the votes of all Americans. We did a tremendous amount of public outreach with NBC, BET, and other media to educate voters on our efforts. With the support of over 150 coalition partners, we worked with election officials, conducted strategic legal voter protection field programs and answered over 240,000 calls to 1- 866-OUR-VOTE our one of a kind voter support hotline that, combined with our sister hotline 1-888-Ve-Y-Vota, is the only nationwide number to provide live, real-time assistance to voters to help them cast a ballot. Further, we took advantage of new technology, and initiated our online voter education program--www.866OURVOTE.org, which served as an interactive clearinghouse for state and national voting rules, regulations, news and information on hot election topics. From September 17th through Election Day, more than 283,000 people visited the website. Of course, Election Protection's primary purpose is to deliver a comprehensive support network to voters. That goal, however, is followed closely by our unique data collection effort. Combining the stories from callers into the hotline with those that come in from our interactive webchat and those developed in the field, our partner, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, created www.ourvotelive.org, a public website that collects the experiences of the hundreds of thousands of voters with whom Election Protection interacts. The result is the most complete picture of the obstacles Americans face as they head to the polls from the perspective of the voters. Mr. Chairman, I believe we have not only a legal obligation, but a moral one to uphold such fundamental rights of all eligible Americans. Since the ratification of the civil war amendments, through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (``NVRA'') and the Help America Vote Act of 2002, Congress has demonstrated its commitment to protecting this right. Now is the time to continue that tradition by focusing on election reform when we are not clouded by the partisanship of an election year. Instead, we should focus on election reform--both here in Congress, and in the administrative agencies responsible for protecting our rights--at a safe enough distance to develop and pass real, meaningful reforms. Now is the time to pass the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Act and now is the time to refocus the Department of Justice on its historic role as a protector of the right to vote. We have a duty to make our elections equally open to all eligible citizens, conduct them fairly and make them transparent so all Americans have confidence in the electoral system, today, Mr. Chairman, you are taking the critical first step on that noble path. The recent election season presented us with a stark dichotomy in which we saw a historic election take place amid a background of old concerns. We should ensure that such elections, although they may be historic, are substantiated by increased access and credibility. Attached to my testimony is our report,* Election Protection 2008: Helping Voters Today, Modernizing the System for Tomorrow, which details the Election Protection experience from 2008 and our recommendations as to how to improve our election system. My testimony focuses on two issues of particular concern to this Committee: the endemic problem of practices that disfranchise voters by intentionally deceiving them as to the time, place and manner of elections and the under-enforcement of federal voting protections by the United States Department of Justice. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *The report, ``Election Protection 2008: Helping Voters Today, Modernizing the System for Tomorrow,'' has been made a permanent part of this record and is available at the Committee on the Judiciary. This report may also be viewed on the Internet at: http:// www.866ourvote.org/tools/documents/files/0077.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- DECEPTIVE PRACTICES Our Election Protection efforts are very important to me; In fact, I personally help answer phones and participate in a variety of ways during the chaos and excitement of each election season, surrounded by hundreds of dedicated colleagues committed to providing voters with the information they need to go to the polls and have their vote counted. The phones will ring on the day after the election and sometimes it is an ultimately heartbroken voter who, because of a flier, email or call went to the poll on the wrong day. This should never happen. I hope you will stand with me in ensuring that it does not continue. Our Election Protection experience in the last several cycles has confirmed an unfortunate reality; deceptive practices--false information designed to mislead voters about the time, place, and manner of elections--has become an endemic problem. For example, in 2004, there were fliers from the non-existent Milwaukee Black Voters League telling voters that if they had voted in the primary or if anybody in their family had been guilty of any infraction, even a traffic ticket, they could not vote in the Presidential election and would be imprisoned for ten years if they voted. In Allegheny County, Pennsylvania there was a notice on official-looking letterhead informing Republicans to vote on Tuesday, November 2 and Democrats to vote on Wednesday, November 3. Indeed, the day after the election the 866-OUR-VOTE hotline received calls from voters asking us why the polls were not open. In 2006, we received reports from voters in several states saying that they had received calls stating their polling place had been moved when it had not and or stating that the their registrations had been cancelled. In 2008, Election Protection received almost daily reports in the weeks leading up to the election of voters targeted with misinformation and voter intimidation. These were intentional efforts to keep voters from casting ballots. Fliers, robocalls, e-mails, text messages and online social networking programs such as Facebook were all used to deliver deliberately false information about registration, polling locations, poll closing times and voter ID requirements. These are deceptive practices we have observed repeatedly since the start of our Election Protection efforts. In fact, this year, deception expanded, as new, high tech outlets made it easier than ever to disseminate false information quickly. One egregious example occurred on the campus of George Mason University--an e-mail circulated around the campus purportedly from Provost Peter Stearns, informed students and staff that the election had been postponed until Wednesday, November 5th. Later, Stearns sent a message revealing that someone had hacked into the system and that voting would indeed take place ``today, November 4th.'' Our efforts need to adapt accordingly to combat these practices and minimize the effect of partisan tricks. This is an opportunity for us to use new media to combat those very same tactics. We need to make sure correct information is clearly identified, consistent and widely accessible. More examples follow, which demonstrate the influences deceptive practices had on the most recent election: Pennsylvania--In a West Philadelphia neighborhood, fliers appeared stating that anyone who showed up at the polls with a criminal record of any kind--including something as minor as an unpaid traffic ticket--would be arrested on the spot by law enforcement officials stationed at every polling location. Election Protection conducted aggressive media outreach in the area to quickly debunk this myth. As a result of Election Protection's efforts, the false fliers were discussed and discredited in articles about election-related dirty tricks published by the Associated Press, Philadelphia Inquirer, McClatchy and ABC.com. Michigan--Misinformation about student voting rights surfaced in Michigan as in other states. Emily D. of Grand Rapids was working to get eligible voters--including students--registered in time to vote for November's general election. Like many students, Emily was given erroneous advice from election officials that registering students in a county other than where their parents lived could endanger their financial aid and health insurance. She called the 866-OUR-VOTE hotline to verify this information, and upon learning that students could register in Michigan without legal repercussions, Emily went on to register 200 new student voters Missouri--The Secretary of State's office in this state reportedly received complaints from people who had received text messages claiming that due to high turnout, Democrats would be voting on Wednesday, November 5. In one location, it was reported that there was a sign posted, informing voters that they were not allowed to vote a straight ticket, which prompted the voter who called Election Protection--and untold others--to vote against his preferred party once to ensure that his ballot would be counted. These were not cases of isolated incidents--quite the contrary-- they only begin to highlight occurrences of similar circumstances in many states throughout the country. As we have noted, voters in nearly a dozen states were the victims of misinformation in the weeks leading up to and including Election Day. By denying a voice to eligible voters, deceptive practices increase the poisonous cynicism voters have about the process. Again, we applaud the work done by this Committee in reintroducing the Deceptive Practices Act this year. We believe Congress should prioritize this bill, as such legislation can have a tremendous stake in the election process in light of the problems we still see, as outlined above. An effort to make it ``unlawful for anyone before or during a federal election to knowingly communicate, or attempt to communicate, false election-related information about that election, with the intent to prevent another person from exercising the right to vote'' is directly responsive to the type of problems we see. We believe this is a warranted and welcomed effort to remedying those persistent problems. Historically, voters who are deliberately provided misinformation about when, where or how to vote or about voter registration requirements do not have adequate legal recourse. The Deceptive Practices Act and extended enforcement therein, establishes a clear standard of federal law: if you intend to deceive voters, you will be punished. For that, Mr. Chairman, you deserve our utmost appreciation for your continued attention to this matter. While it will be an improvement to prohibit deceptive practices through federal law, in the heat of an election season, when most of this activity happens, voters should also be informed of correct information through sources they trust. Prosecutions are often not possible or the most effective way to overcome deceptive information as Election Day approaches--the most important goal near an election. This remedy should be collaboration between the relevant government actors at the general, state and local levels. The Justice Department should collect information and statistics about these practices to inform investigations and determine the extent and character of deceptive voting practices. We laud the fact that the Act ``requires the Attorney General, immediately after receiving such a report, to consider and review it and, if there is a reasonable basis to find that a violation has occurred, to: (1) undertake all effective measures necessary to provide correct information to voters affected by the false information; and (2) refer the matter to the appropriate federal and state authorities for criminal prosecution or civil action after the election.'' voting rights enforcement by the united states department of justice We are shoveling our way out of a hole dug by several years of insufficient attention to voting rights enforcement in the previous administration. This Committee's record in unearthing the previous administration's lack of enforcement is notable, but we are still digging. There is a need for the Department of Justice to continue to expand enforcement measures to help us dig out of the hole more expeditiously. One notable area where the Bush Administration's failure to enforce federal voting protections impacted millions of poor Americans was its under-enforcement of Section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (``NVRA''). Section 7 requires public assistance agencies to provide voter registration applications and offer assistance to individuals applying for benefits. Congress included Section 7 to make sure that people who are to poor and vulnerable would not be disadvantaged in voter registration because they did not have drivers' licenses and thus would not be registered through the ``motor voter'' provisions of the NVRA. There is large-scale noncompliance with Section 7 as the Lawyers' Committee has found while working with Demos and Project Vote on a national effort to enforce Section 7. The numbers tell much of the story. The United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC) reports to Congress on NVRA compliance after every federal general election. In the last reporting period, which covers the two year period preceding the November 2006 election, election officials received only 527,752 applications from public assistance offices as compared to 16,591,292 applications from motor vehicle offices. We estimate that more than half of the states are in violation of Section 7. For most of the Bush Justice Department, Section 7 noncompliance was ignored despite repeated efforts by the civil rights community to prod it into action. The Department brought only one case under Section 7--in Tennessee, where it was part of a larger NVRA case. Only last year did the Bush Justice Department begin taking its enforcement responsibility seriously by reaching out-of-court settlements in Illinois and Arizona. Active Section 7 enforcement can make an enormous difference. Last year, the Lawyers' Committee filed suit against Missouri's Department of Social Services in ACORN v. Scott. In July, the district court granted our motion for preliminary injunction and ordered an interim remedial plan into effect. In the first six-and-a-half months under the remedial plan, the Department of Social Services registered nearly 80,000 people--a 2000% increase as compared to the 2005-06 reporting period. Moreover, in Tennessee, the one place where the Bush Justice Department brought a case, the public assistance agencies generated more than 120,000 voter registration applications in the 2005-06 reporting period. This represented more than one in five registrations from public assistance agencies in the nation. If there was full compliance with Section 7, 2-3 million poor people would be registered to vote at public assistance agencies per year as opposed to less than 270,000 per year as indicated in the EAC's last biannual report to Congress. If approximately 15 attorneys and eight paralegals were added to the Department of Justice's Voting Section to focus on NVRA Section 7 work, we believe that full compliance could be achieved in a two to three year period. This would be a small price to pay for the results that would be achieved. CONCLUSION Mr. Chairman, thank you and the Committee for your continued commitment to our fundamental patriotic need to provide an equal opportunity for every eligible citizen to make her voice heard through the ballot box. For far too long, the cynicism of deception and intimidation has kept that goal just out of reach. To truly realize our constitutional democratic promise, we must eliminate these cynical practices and restore the role of the Department of Justice as a guardian of our most fundamental right, the right to vote. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and I would be happy to answer any questions. __________ Mr. Nadler. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Segal, you are recognized for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF MATTHEW SEGAL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, STUDENT ASSOCIATION FOR VOTER EMPOWERMENT (SAVE) Mr. Segal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member. My name is Matthew Segal, and I am the executive director of the Student Association for Voter Empowerment, otherwise known as SAVE. I speak here today representing a constituency of over 10,000 members and on more than 30 college campuses throughout the country. As several journalists coined 2008, it was the year of the youth vote. Young voter participation increased considerably, with over 23 million young Americans-- or 52 percent of all eligible young voters--casting ballots. Beyond just statistics, young people provided unprecedented energy, spirit, and volunteer service to political campaigns, which was instrumental in shattering the conventional wisdom that young people do not vote or do not want to vote. Yet notwithstanding these clear successes, a closer examination of the 2008 election demonstrates that young voters succeeded in spite of numerous barriers, not necessarily because the system worked efficiently. The problems of the 2008 begin with voter registration. First, there were several instances of misleading statements made by election officials regarding the potential consequences for out-of-town college students who wished to register and vote within their campus communities. At jurisdictions including Virginia Tech and Colorado College, for instance, county clerks issued statements indicating that if students chose to register at school and they wanted to participate where they attend college for 9 months of the year, that their parents could no longer claim them as tax dependents on their forms, and that they could potentially lose their scholarships, grant money, and health insurance. And since these false claims originated from election officials, disputing their accuracy was particularly difficult. Students attempting to register at Jackson State University, Furman, and both Radford and Mary Washington College were repeatedly denied registration status because they listed a dorm room as their residency. This dilemma was and is the result of vague definitions of domicile, which registrars may interpret subjectively to include or exclude college communities. While voter registration issues were indeed the dominate problem in 2008 for young people, we also faced additional barriers, including misinformation campaigns and deceptive practices, like Ms. Arnwine referred to, and I will just mention briefly that I would like to submit for the record some flyers that were posted around Drexel University as well as Penn, which warned if you have any unpaid parking tickets that you could potentially risk jail time for voting. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit this. [The information referred to follows:] __________ Mr. Segal. Thank you. Deceptive practices also occurred via text message, and because the Obama and McCain campaigns regularly sent text messages, this increased the believability of them for young people. Without sufficient time in my oral testimony to overview absentee ballot problems and a lack of polling locations, I feel compelled to briefly mention long lines. Temple University, University of Connecticut, and University of South Florida, students all waited in excess of 3 hours to vote, while the longest lines were at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, over 11 hours in line. These extremely long lines were caused by a lack of voting machines, five machines for 3,000 registered voters. Long lines are a particularly salient issue to me, given that my first voting experience attending college in Gambier, Ohio, back in 2004 had the longest line lines in the country at 12 hours in length. I, therefore, come to this Committee today with the exact same question I asked just 4 years ago when I testified here in saying: What safeguards or standards are currently in place to ensure that elected officials, whether intentionally or inadvertently, cannot allocate two voting machines to one district and 10 voting machines to another district, both of which are identical in scope and composition? While long lines or deceptive flyers create a clear graphic image of voting barriers, perhaps the most insidious obstacle for young people are stringent voter ID laws. Students at Butler University and Earlham in Indiana voted provisionally because they were unable to satisfy their state government- issued photo ID requirements and could not use college or university ID as a permissible alternative. According to a Rock the Vote poll, 19 percent of young adults report they do not possess a government-issued photo ID that reflects their current address. This is a consequence of the fact that young adults are a uniquely mobile demographic. In response to the issues I have raised in this testimony, we have several policy proposals, and I have little time to share them, so I will be brief. First, we support the Count Every Vote Act, which was a comprehensive election reform piece of legislation introduced by the late Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. We also support the Chairman of the full Committee's bill, The Voting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Rights Act. With these bills, which already have some of these things in their policies, we recommend same-day voter registration, standards for allocation of voting systems, less restrictive photo ID requirements, and a tracking system to follow the status of absentee ballots similar to what one can do for a UPS package. Finally, SAVE's top legislative priority is passing the Student Voter Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Jan Schakowsky, Steven LaTourette of Ohio, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, which would amend the National Voter Registration Act to require all colleges and universities that receive Federal money to act as voter registration agencies for their enrolling students. This bill would specifically target the 30 percent of young non-voters in this country who cite uncertainty and confusion with the registration process as their primary reason for not participating. I look forward to discussing potential solutions further in the Q and A, and I thank you for including young people in this critical discourse. [The prepared statement of Mr. Segal follows:] Prepared Statement of Matthew Segal __________ Mr. Nadler. Thank you. Ms. Heidelbaugh, you are recognized for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF HEATHER S. HEIDELBAUGH, SHAREHOLDER, BABST, CALLAND, CLEMENTS & ZOMNIR Ms. Heidelbaugh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Heather Heidelbaugh, and I am an attorney. On October 29, I represented a candidate, voters, and the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania in a lawsuit against ACORN, alleging violations of Pennsylvania Election law as well as fraud and misrepresentation. The injunctive request against ACORN requested that they stop contacting voter registration applicants who they knew to be fraudulent and encourage them to vote; in addition, to agree with the King County, Washington, consent decree where they agreed not to do a variety of things that were deemed illegal in Washington State and to provide my client with copies of the fraudulent voter registrations which they submitted. We became aware that there were four pending criminal investigations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the district attorneys as well as the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia. The district attorney in Pittsburgh, who happens to be a Democrat, was also investigating ACORN for fraudulent voter registration activities. Four days later after I filed my injunctive request, I was contacted by a woman who is seated here behind me, and her name is Anita Moncrief, and she is a former employee of Project Vote, and she is seated right there in the red. She testified at the trial, and the testimony that I provided to this Committee is literally quotes from her testimony. I have the testimony here, and the court reporter requires that in order for me to copy it, every copy must be paid for. So, if the Committee would like to obtain an official transcript, they can do that from the court reporter of the commonwealth. One of the first things that I learned about Ms. Moncrief was that she had been a confidential informant to The New York Times since August, and The New York Times' Stephanie Strom printed six articles based on the information that was given to her by Ms. Moncrief. In addition to Ms. Moncrief, she is accompanied here today by Marcel Reed. Marcel Reed is the current chair of DC ACORN and has been a volunteer for DC ACORN for a number of years and has issued a press release verifying Ms. Moncrief's testimony. When Ms. Moncrief indicated to The New York Times---- Mr. Nadler. Excuse me. Could you just clarify that? Was that injunction granted or you just applied for it? Ms. Heidelbaugh. The injunction was denied in part, and it was granted in part. The part that was denied, we have also filed against the secretary of the commonwealth, and they testified that they believe that despite the massive voter registrations that were submitted throughout the commonwealth by ACORN that they felt that they could conduct a fair election. That part of the injunction which was against ACORN was granted and that additional time to ask for discovery and to proceed against ACORN was allowed, based on the testimony of Ms. Moncrief, as well as the ACORN witnesses that were in court. Ms. Moncrief testified for approximately 2 hours, and the testimony that I provided to the Committee is actual quotes, and what she said was that she was a development associate for Project Vote, but that Project Vote and ACORN were virtually one entity. Further, part of her work was to investigate voter fraud allegations made by ACORN in the 2004 election cycle, and what she found out was that ACORN had a systemic and systematic corporate philosophy to deny voter registration fraud even when they knew that it had occurred. In large part, the problem with ACORN is the quality of people that they hire. They do not do background checks. They do not inquire whether the individuals can conduct regular office work. Furthermore, they have enormous problems with quality control. Even though they agreed in a consent decree with the State of Washington to enhance their quality control, they have not. In addition, there is training problems. They have manuals in which they indicate to law enforcement that they have trained individuals, but they really do not in practice, she testified. They know that they filed duplicate registrations. The reason why they file so many registrations is because they are paid $17 per registration. There is a quota system. Each ACORN worker has to turn in 20. Some of the ACORN workers are paid in cash, which is violative. They use the voter registration cards for other purposes. There is also a fraud in the absentee ballots. They know that there is going to be absentee ballots that are requested on these fraudulent registrations, and they have not done anything organizationally. They also have a program to deny voter registration fraud, and it is called informally Throw Them Under the Bus. What they do is, when an individual ACORN employee is caught violating, they say it is not a systemic organizational problem, even though national president Maude Hurd signed a document with King County that it is. They accuse the ACORN worker. In addition, they have a Money for the Muscle program in which she testified about a shakedown of corporations to increase donors. I see that my time has stopped. I would sincerely request that Congress investigate these allegations as I have out lined against ACORN. [The prepared statement of Ms. Heidelbaugh follows:] Prepared Statement of Heather S.

Thank you. The next witness I recognize is Dr. Tucker for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF JAMES THOMAS TUCKER, CONSULTING ATTORNEY, NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND Mr. Tucker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you very much for your invitation to testify today on the lessons learned from the 2008 presidential election. The Native American Rights Fund applauds the Committee for examining this important topic. Last November shows how far our native voters have come. Thanks to registration and get-out-the-vote efforts by groups, including the National Congress of American Indians, natives in many parts of the country experienced high turnout rates. At least 23 Native American candidates from 11 states and 17 tribes won their elections. Denise Juneau of the Three Affiliated Tribes became the first American Indian elected to statewide office in the State of Montana, following her election as state superintendent of public instruction. Today, thanks in large part to Federal laws, including the Voting Rights Act, there are 67 natives serving in the legislatures of 16 states. Congressman Tom Cole, an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation, was also reelected to office. But election 2008 also shows that our work remains unfinished. In Montana, American Indians in seven counties, including three with very large reservation populations, had to file a lawsuit to stop challenges to their voter registration. Obviously, given the fact we are talking about Native Americans, there can be no question that these are United States citizens. NCAI reported that its election protection efforts also identified, ``local tensions with state officials'' and ``confusion about IDs.'' In Arizona, Agnes Laughter, a 77-year-old grandmother who only speaks Navajo and has voted all of her adult life using her thumbprint as her identification, was forced to sue state election officials to restore her right to vote. Ms. Laughter was first turned away from the polls in 2006 when new voter identification laws went into effect in Arizona. She was unable to meet state requirements because she was born in a Hogan, has no electricity and, therefore, has no utility bills, has no birth certificate, does not have a tribal identification card, and does not drive. Alaska, which has the highest percentage of native voters of any state, continues to experience depressed native turnout. In the 2008 presidential election, the statewide turnout rate in Alaska was 66 percent. Unfortunately, turnout among Alaska natives was 47 percent, almost 20 percent lower, despite the fact that this was an historic election and one of the highest profile elections in American history. That is no coincidence. It is continuation of the pattern of neglect and discrimination by state election officials against geographically and linguistically isolated native voters, which includes lack of outreach to the native voters, English-only materials and assistance, the absence of publicity in native languages, such as Yup'ik, the most widely spoken Alaskan native language that is spoken by well over 15,000 Alaskan natives in Alaska, no information in native languages about voter purges, and insufficient trained and qualified translators, among other things. Last July, a Federal court issued an injunction to force Alaska officials to comply with the language assistance and voter assistance requirements in section 208 of the Voting Rights Act, and I have included a copy of that injunction as an attachment to my testimony which describes these and other problems in greater detail. The experience of Native Americans in the 2008 presidential election identified several areas where additional work is needed in Indian country. First and foremost, more enforcement of existing laws, greater use of Federal observers, and, in fact, as I noted in my written testimony, we have a pending request with Attorney General Holder to certify Alaska, in particular the Bethel census area, for Federal observers pursuant to his authority under section 3 of the Voting Rights Act. In addition, there need to be sufficient resources for the Justice Department to investigate and litigate enforcement actions, particularly as we head into the next round of redistricting. And there also should be consideration of legislation to expand early voting, same-day registration, and other measures that facilitate native voter turnout and participation. NARF looks forward to working with Members of the Subcommittee in identifying the cures to the remaining barriers to political participation for Native Americans. Thank you very much for your attention, and I would welcome the opportunity to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Tucker follows:] Prepared Statement of James Thomas Tucker ATTACHMENT __________ Mr. Nadler. Well, thank you very much. I will begin the questions by recognizing myself for 5 minutes. Mr. Tucker, in a number of states, if election officials cannot match a voter's registration information against information in other government databases, the voter will be purged. Although purging the rolls is necessary to keep the states' rolls up to date, it could be highly problematic due to the inherent unreliability of many of the computer-match processes the states use. It is estimated that between 15 to 30 percent of all match attempts fail because of typos, other administrative errors, and minor discrepancies between database records, such as conflicting use of maiden and married names or the use of hyphenated names. Strict matching policies often disenfranchise thousands of voters through no fault of their own. In your experience, is this a major concern? How regularly do legally qualified voters encounter the effects of these policies and, if you think it is a major concern, what do you think can be done to prevent erroneous purges? Mr. Tucker. Mr. Chairman, I agree with you. It is a major concern, and it is actually something that we encountered when we were visiting several native villages during the 2008 presidential election. We actually encountered one very elderly Alaska native, a Yup'ik speaker, in the native village of Kasigluk who had been disenfranchised over 20 years ago because of a voter purge, again very much using the sort of no-match, no-vote procedure, and then was never informed about it. The problem that we experience with the natives in particular is that oftentimes the National Voter Registration Act may be complied with in form, but it is not being complied with in its spirit because language assistance is not being provided, native voters receive cards in English that they cannot read, and they are purged, and then they simply cannot vote. So, fundamentally, I think one of the issues that this Subcommittee should look at is both in terms of enforcing laws, such as the National Voter Registration Act, and also to identity jurisdictions where no match procedures are being used to disenfranchise and target specific communities, such as Alaska natives and American Indians. Mr. Nadler. In most states, election officials do not have to give notice to voters when they are purged from the voter rolls. This often means that eligible voters who are wrongfully purged lack the ability to contest this decision. What can be done to prevent this disenfranchisement, in your opinion? Mr. Tucker. Well, you know, it is ironic because all of us thought when the National Voter Registration Act was enacted in 1993 that this problem was resolved because it sets up a very particular procedure that Ms. Arnwine has identified that has to be followed. There has to be a postcard sent out to confirm to the voter that ``We are putting you on notice that you have been identified for purge,'' and give you an opportunity to correct the problem. That is just simply not being done in many jurisdictions around the country, and, unfortunately, more often than not, it tends to impact the most susceptible and vulnerable populations, not just---- Mr. Nadler. Has any judicial action been taken to try to make the states obey that part of the law? Mr. Tucker. Well, you know, it is my understanding that the Justice Department has brought some enforcement actions, but that is one of the things that we are currently doing in the State of Alaska, and it has been a struggle because they just simply do not want to do it. Mr. Nadler. They do not want to do it? They do not want to send these notices to people? Mr. Tucker. Well, they want to send them out in English, but they do not want to provide the information in a language that the voters can actually understand. Mr. Nadler. Okay. And, Ms. Arnwine and Mr. Tucker, very briefly, because I have one more question I want to ask, what key lessons can we learn from the election to deal with potential voting issues that might arise in future elections? Very broad question, brief answer, please. Ms. Arnwine. Yes. Mr. Nadler. Ms. Arnwine? Ms. Arnwine. Yes. I think that, you know, as I testified, very key to future actions is passing that Deceptive Practices and Intimidation---- Mr. Nadler. The Deceptive Practices Act. What else? Ms. Arnwine. It is very key. The other one will be coming to the House at some point, will be working on voter modernization legislation. A lot of testimony today about problems with third-party registration groups really should not exist because, frankly, the states should have the responsibility for automatically registering all adult citizens, and that should not be the responsibility of third-party groups. Just like when you turn 18 and you get your Selective Services card, you should get your own voter card. And this whole issue about matches and everything that we have been talking about, the purging, that also would not exist because you would have better portability for voters within states because people move just two blocks away and do not want to.. Mr. Nadler. Why don't we do what some European countries do--in fact, most countries do--and say it is the responsibility of the state or the Federal Government, some government, to make sure that everybody is registered---- Ms. Arnwine. Exactly. Mr. Nadler [continuing]. And the default position is you are registered unless someone proves you should not be, and what I am told is, ``Well, you can do that in other countries because you have a national I.D. card. We do not have a national I.D. card. It would be very difficult to do it here.'' Would you comment on that? Ms. Arnwine. Yes. The whole issue about an ID card doesn't necessarily fly because everybody in the country has a Social Security card---- Mr. Nadler. Yes. Ms. Arnwine [continuing]. And a Social Security number, and that is, I think, adequate for the purposes of being able to do the---- Mr. Nadler. Okay. My time has expired. Could Mr. Tucker briefly answer the same question? Mr. Tucker. I think Ms. Arnwine has hit the nail on the head. I mean, what we are really talking about here is that many of the barriers that exist are things such as the National Voter Registration Act that were originally put in place to facilitate the administration of elections, but far too often, rather than facilitating voter participation, these are being set up and used as barriers to prevent people from voting, and I think fundamentally the one question that needs to be looked into is why aren't more people voting. We had record turnout in terms of numbers, but a third of all American voters still did not cast ballots. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. King. Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses for coming forward and testifying today. A series of questions arise in my mind as I listen to each of you, and I want to direct my first question to Ms. Heidelbaugh. Listening to Mr. Sensenbrenner's opening statement, I think he said 1.2 million voter registrations by ACORN, roughly. I saw a number that was 400,000 that were, I think, confessed by them to be fraudulent. That number alleged is significantly higher than that, I believe. Can you imagine that there would be that many fraudulent voter registrations in a country and not have fraudulent votes cast off of those registrations? Ms. Heidelbaugh. No, sir. I believe that the problem is the mechanism by which that particular group, ACORN, goes about doing voter registrations. The concern based on the testimony and my conversations with people inside ACORN is that they really do not as an organization want to register to people to vote. They want to obtain money per registration card. That is how they bill their customers, and so they have to tell their foundations that provide them with support that they have, in fact, obtained 1.3 million registration cards, and I thought the number was actually flipped, that it was only 400,000 that were allegedly valid and it was the remainder that were invalid. Mr. King. Let me accept that correction. I am going off of memory from months ago, as that number was accumulated rather than a current report that is brought up today. Then the foundations that fund ACORN--what would be their motivation for wanting more voter registrations or for wanting more people signed up as their customers? Ms. Heidelbaugh. Well, the thought is that there is a fraud going on here between ACORN here and the foundations because the foundations legitimately want people to be registered so that they can exercise their franchise, but what they do not even understand is that the money that they are giving to ACORN is not being spent properly. Mr. King. But, Ms. Heidelbaugh, I am still concerned. Are they foundations this altruistic that it is just their goal to get more people registered, or do they have a political agenda that is on the other side of that? Ms. Heidelbaugh. I cannot speak for the foundations. I do not know. I am taking them at their word, that these organizations would like more people to be registered to vote, and as an American, I think that is fantastic, that is great. The problem comes in when you have all these fraudulent registrations and you push them into the election divisions, the election workers cannot register people who are proper registrants which is a---- Mr. King. Let me submit that---- Ms. Heidelbaugh [continuing]. Which is a chilling of the franchise. Mr. King. I really do not want, of course, any fraudulent voter registrations for the obvious reasons, but I do not think I have heard it boiled down to what it really means here, and that is that the more fraudulent voter registrations you have, the more likely there will be fraudulent votes cast in greater and greater numbers, and I believe that number was 537,000 votes that made the difference in the leader in the free world in Florida in the year 2000. And so I hear an emphasis on concern about voter suppression. I certainly am opposed to willful voter suppression, but I think we could always define voter suppression as something else. Even a negative political campaign that attacks a candidate is voter suppression. That is exactly what it is. It is designed to keep their supporters home. But we will always be able to chew on the bone of voter suppression to the end of a--the constitutional republic that we are, but fraudulent votes are another matter. That is something we should tolerate none of, nor any kind of a system that facilitates it, and, you know, I understand Mr. Tucker's testimony about we need more interpreters, and that keeps people from the polls. But in the end, you know, this is the United States of America, and people have certain responsibilities, and there are many constitutional privileges or constitutional rights that we have. Voting is a conditional right, not specified in the Constitution, and so I will submit this, that I do not want to see 537 fraudulent votes. I do not want to see one because it disenfranchises legitimate voters, and voter suppression can generally, as sad as it is--and we have a history of it--as sad as it is, can be overcome by the will to vote. And I want to encourage the will to vote, but I do not want to cancel the legitimate votes that are there, and so I will add the case for a voter registration list that is free of duplicates, deceased and felons, and require a voter picture ID and that in, again, the states that outlaw felons from voting-- I have to condition that statement--and then when we have voters that are reported--I saw a number of 55,000 New Yorkers allegedly voted in Florida in the election. Right now, I can tell you that an individual could register to vote in all 99 counties in Iowa, vote absentee in all 99 counties in Iowa, and we do not have a provision to even stop that. We are a long, long ways from having legitimate votes, and I would like to see this Committee focus on the fraudulent votes that are there, and we can chew on the voter suppression bone in perpetuity. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. I thank the witnesses again. Mr. Nadler. I now recognize the Chairman of the full Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers. Mr. Conyers. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Well, since we are at a hearing on ACORN, is there anybody here from ACORN that can testify? Oh, well, may I ask respectfully that the Chairman consider such a hearing so we can get to the bottom of this. I mean---- Mr. Nadler. Well, let me just say that I will certainly consider a hearing on ACORN, if I ever hear any credible allegations. Mr. Conyers. Well, wait a minute. This is a member of the bar here that got a successful partial injunction against ACORN, and we have our distinguished colleague on the Committee where he has asserted that people could fraudulently vote in every county in the state. That is a pretty serious matter. And I would just like the Chairman, who is a fierce supporter of constitutional rights, civil rights, and human rights, to take this matter up. I think it would be something that would be worth our time. Mr. Nadler. The Chairman makes a good point, and we will certainly consider it. Mr. Conyers. Well, that is what all Chairmen say around here, so---- [Laughter.] That is pretty instructive and encouraging. So, you know, I am not too happy about the depth of our discussion here, to be honest with you. And maybe we will get it into the next panel or through further hearings even, but the voter rights section, the civil rights section of the Department of Justice has been clearly off track across the years, and I suppose there is more that we can do about that. One of our staffers praised Attorney Tucker for his knowledge of section 5 and the great work he has done. Of course, we know Attorney Arnwine and the work she has done. And we are glad to see young people coming in. And, of course, on campuses throughout the country, there was this great misunderstanding of who could vote and where. There were some campuses where students had to fly back to their home to cast their ballot because they were not going to be allowed to cast one at the university, and I think there is a lot we can do to clear that up as well. So we welcome the witnesses and invite you to stay with the Committee as we work on these various matters. Do any of the panelists wish to comment on anything they have heard today? All right. Ms. Arnwine. Yes, Congressman Conyers. Thank you so much for everything that you do in promoting open and free and fair elections. One of the most critical things coming up before the Congress is, of course, the budget for the Department of Justice, you know, the budget in general, and I think it is very critical that that budget have the correct funding for the civil rights division so that there will be adequate resources in the voting rights section to do the work that needs to be done, not only for compliance with the section 7 of the NVRA and compliance with section 5 and bringing cases under section 2, but also to make sure that there is adequate staff to deal with redistricting issues and census issues. I just think that that is one of the most important things coming before this House and before the Congress and that it is very, very important that there be a great increase in that budget at least a 25 percent increase. Mr. Segal. And, Mr. Chairman, if I may, Mr. King referenced the notion of will to vote being prevalent in allowing or mitigating this issue of voter suppression. But with regards to will to vote, it cannot necessarily be overcome when students or young people or anyone for that matter are standing in line for 9, 10, 11 hours to vote. I mean, that takes them away from their economic opportunities. That takes them away from their jobs, their families, their commitments, and it is tantamount to a poll tax if it is taking them away from earning a living for 10 hours. It is making them take an entire day off of work. The other thing is you mentioned the 99 counties of Iowa. Well, it is a felony to vote in every single county. So the felony is the real deterrent from the voter fraud, not necessarily making the laws more stringent and restrictive, which could theoretically disenfranchise eligible citizens. Mr. Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. I now recognize the distinguished gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not know how distinguished, but I am from Texas. But appreciate the testimony I have been hearing back in the back room. But really appreciate you all being here. Obviously, you are not here for the money you get for testifying. You all can find that amusing, but you do not get anything, right? So thank you. I know you come out of a sense of duty to this country and love for it. Ms. Heidelbaugh, let me ask you, though--the court had granted an injunction, and we had heard that--what was the legal threshold that you had to clear in order to get an injunction? What kind of legal proof was required? Ms. Heidelbaugh. We presented a day of testimony. Ms. Moncrief testified under oath under penalty of perjury. Her testimony is here. She subjected herself voluntarily and---- Mr. Gohmert. Yeah, but my question is what is the legal threshold procedurally that you have to cross in order to get an injunction? Ms. Heidelbaugh. There was a misstatement that the injunction was granted in part and denied in part, and the---- Mr. Gohmert. Okay. Ms. Heidelbaugh [continuing]. The part that was granted was the allowance of the petitioners, my clients, to proceed in further discovery and further injunctive proceedings against ACORN because the court found--and they are the trier of fact in that case---- Mr. Gohmert. Right. Ms. Heidelbaugh. They found that they had serious concern about the testimony that had been presented against ACORN. Mr. Gohmert. Okay. Is that a probable cause type level? Ms. Heidelbaugh. That would be a criminal---- Mr. Gohmert. Preponderance? Ms. Heidelbaugh. No, that would be---- Mr. Gohmert. A preponderance of the evidence? Ms. Heidelbaugh [continuing]. A preponderance of the evidence, yes. Mr. Gohmert. That you would be successful and that you should at least be entitled to proceed with discovery, correct? Ms. Heidelbaugh. The court granted the right to proceed to discovery and outlined--and I attached this in the documents which I have provided to Congress--the language that the court issued against ACORN. Mr. Gohmert. So that trier of fact that heard the case on the injunction found that there was evidence--some evidence--to justify going forward, correct? Ms. Heidelbaugh. Yes, sir. Mr. Gohmert. Okay. Ms. Heidelbaugh. I can---- Mr. Gohmert. So this---- Ms. Heidelbaugh. I can quote from---- Mr. Gohmert [continuing]. Body could recognize that an authorized trier of fact within this country has found evidence to justify discovery and going forward, in the event we wanted to determine whether there was voter fraud out there with an organization like ACORN and could be justified. Wouldn't you think so? Ms. Heidelbaugh. Yes, sir. And I could quote what the court said, ``Given the above timeframe and given evidence that in Pennsylvania practices of ACORN outreach workers can encourage duplicate voter registration, that in Pennsylvania quality control practices of ACORN may be inadequate to identify duplicate voter registration, that in Philadelphia a huge number of duplicate voter registrations were received, and that in Pennsylvania ACORN maintains computer records of problematic card cover sheets. The court will entertain a motion for expedited discovery should a hearing on permanent injunction be scheduled.'' Mr. Gohmert. Okay. Well, thank you. Now we have been hearing here this week that with regard to the U.S. census that is coming up the end of the decade, that the census may be entering a contract with ACORN to assist them in getting volunteers to help with the census, and so I would be curious to anyone's response, if you have any concerns on ACORN being hired to help do the census that will determine what representation any states have here in the Congress. Ms. Heidelbaugh. I would like to answer that, Congressman. Mr. Gohmert. Okay. Go ahead. Ms. Heidelbaugh. A couple of things. It is my understanding that, in fact, that ACORN now is a national partner with the U.S. Census Bureau and has signed a contract as of February of 2009. In regard to the testimony under oath regarding the actions of ACORN throughout the Nation, I believe that the following violations of law have occurred. There is violations of the Internal Revenue Code; 501(c)3 charitable organizations cannot engage in the activities in which they are engaged. The people here with me today filed a lawsuit against ACORN for embezzlement. It is my understanding that a 501(c)3 that has been charged with embezzlement must turn over that information, even if they have been charged---- Mr. Gohmert. And so embezzlement causes you concern? Ms. Heidelbaugh. It causes me deep concern. Mr. Gohmert. How about that? Ms. Heidelbaugh. In addition---- Mr. Gohmert. Here in Congress, we just give away lots of money and we do not hold any people accountable, but---- Ms. Heidelbaugh. In addition, I believe that there is---- Mr. Gohmert [continuing]. It is interesting you find it---- Ms. Heidelbaugh [continuing]. Gross violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. There was testimony under oath that the Obama campaign coordinated illegally with ACORN in Project Vote, which was part of The New York Times, and she testified to that in her story. In addition, voter registration fraud is illegal in all 50 states. In addition, she testified about the Muscle for Money program which would be potential criminal and civil RICO violations and illegal use of the Election Administration Commission grant. She testified under oath that that the parameters of the work that was actually done based on a grant from the EAC was not actually done. There is gross violations of law, and as an American, I was shocked and dismayed to believe that in this country that an organization representing poor people could shake down corporations for what she called protection money and that no one in this country would stand up and be incensed and, frankly, nauseated that this can go on in our country. These women here have come here today to try to be heard so that this Nation will hear them and so that something will be done to stop this, and they have both been personally and physically threatened because of their actions, and so we come here today as ordinary American citizens, and we ask for every American, poor, rich, White, or Black---- Mr. Nadler. The---- Ms. Heidelbaugh [continuing]. That they be heard. Mr. Nadler. The time of the gentleman has well expired. The gentleman from North Carolina is recognized. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you very much. Mr. Watt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to do several things here. First of all, I want to offer for the record Amendment 15 to the Constitution in connection with Mr. King's assertion that there is no right to vote in the Constitution. I will not read it, but I am sure Mr. King will. He is not interested in knowing the facts. I would invite now that Mr. King bring his attention to the 15th amendment to the Constitution in connection with the question of whether there is a right to vote. I would ask Ms. Heidelbaugh--I would say first to you that I am outraged that voter fraud takes place, but I would also ask you--you got into court under some kind of voter fraud statute, did you not? You have a record there. Most states have laws against voting fraud. Would you think it would be the responsibility of the United States Congress to spend a bunch of time on trying this case as opposed to having the courts try it where you are not constrained by a 5-minute testimony rule. Everybody is playing by the same rules. Everybody can come. I mean, I am always fascinated that everybody who comes here thinks we should be playing the role that the Judiciary is out there to play, and so I am outraged. I would even stipulate if I were in court that voter fraud does, in fact, take place. I might even stipulate that ACORN or some of its employees have participated in voter fraud, but I would hope that you would acknowledge that there is already a law that deals with that, and you would not be in court in the first place proceeding with your discovery but for that law. Now let me go on to bigger and broader issues because Mr. Segal has raised some interesting questions here that I would like Mr. Tucker and Ms. Arnwine, our legal experts, to opine about. He has raised questions about domicile for students and lines at polling places, and one of the constraints we have always had looking at the bigger picture here is article I section 4 of the Constitution which says that ``times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof, but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulation.'' I am the chair of the States Rights Caucus on this Committee. Would it give us the authority in Federal elections, in your opinion, Ms. Arnwine and Mr. Tucker, to address some of these issues, like domicile and long lines or misallocation of voting machines? Is that the basis that Mr. Nadler's piece of legislation is proceeding on? Mr. Tucker. Mr. Watt, I guess the first thing I would say is that, yes, absolutely, and, in fact, I would turn the Committee's attention to what the State of Pennsylvania actually does for its student voting. I would think that any Federal legislation that looks into this, dealing with student voting, should deal with two basic premises. Mr. Watt. But you start with the proposition that we have the right to do it in Federal elections? Mr. Tucker. Absolutely. Mr. Watt. Okay. Ms. Arnwine, my time is out. That is why I am rushing. Ms. Arnwine. Students have the right to vote where they reside in college, and it is very, very clear, yet we still have all these jurisdictions violating it. Absolutely this Congress has that right and should exercise its right. Mr. Conyers. Mr. Chairman, could the gentleman get a couple more minutes? Mr. Nadler. Without objection. Mr. Watt. All right. In that case, I will let Mr. Tucker go ahead and talk about the Pennsylvania law. I just wanted to establish the predicates here that we have the authority to do this, but even then we are not going to try the cases. Somebody else has to try these cases, and the judges out there have to determine whether somebody has violated them. You know, it is hard enough to do our part of this job in a tripartite government. We are just one branch here, and I am delighted that you are in court pursuing this case because there, unlike here, they can hear all the sides. You can do all the discovery. I am delighted that you have the right to do discovery. But contrary to what my Chair says, I am not coming to any hearing to have a trial on ACORN. That is not my job. So go ahead, Mr. Tucker. You got me on my soapbox today. Mr. Tucker. Thank you, Mr. Watt. There are two things the Pennsylvania law does. First of all, it says that it is the student's choice on where they can register to vote. And then the second thing is very simple. They say do not vote twice. If you are going to vote here, do not vote back in wherever home state you came from. Mr. Watt. Now back to my original point, even that would require somebody to enforce it, other than the state legislature of Pennsylvania, would it not? If it were violated, there would have to be a prosecution and a trial, two different sections of the state legislative and judicial and executive process. So understand that we can pass the laws. I am addressing my comments again to Ms. Heidelbaugh. I welcome you. I think it is wonderful to have you here, but we are all falling to chasing rabbits when we ought to be chasing big constitutional principles when we go spend too much time on ACORN, not that I am sanctioning anything improper that they did. I thank the Chairman and yield back. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I thank the gentleman. I now yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. Jackson Lee. Chairman, thank you very much for this timely hearing. And to each and every one of you, thank you for your presentation. I ask for your indulgence on your testimony. We were in a whip meeting talking about some other challenges about the budget, but I think that the vision that we saw or have now in place is a result of all of your organizations or at least the organizations that I know have focused on these issues of empowerment. It is the result of your work. And the sadness is, as we worked on the Voting Rights Act reauthorization and, if you will, certain sections, as we worked on the Help America Act, we still have a ways to go. There seems to be a dullness in the American psychie, meaning political and governmental psychie, that, in fact, there is the right, if you will, to task your decisions through this democratic process. Even though the voting rights issue is not constitutionally embedded per se, certainly, the equal protection under the law is constitutionally embedded and so is due process. So, Ms. Arnwine, let me thank you, and I know that you have been to Texas on many occasions, and I maybe under this new Administration have your partnership to be back again because even though we made great strides, for example, in a county like Harris County and, in fact, elected new representatives, happen to be in a different party, I think we have to question and look again at the whole effort that we made on provisional ballots. People do not understand it. The idea of provisional ballots is to make sure that there is empowerment. Our local elected officials and election officers are using it to deny the right. They intimidate. They make sure that you do not know about the provisional ballot, you certainly do not understand what a provisional ballot is, and they almost have a smirk, such as, ``Yeah, they will do the provisional ballot for the circular file.'' We were out on the early voting time in the State of Texas, that is creeping along a balanced voting process. When I say balance, it has been dominated by one party for so long, and I do not consider that the issue of empowerment. Everyone has a right to vote their choice, but it does speak to intimidation, and so I think it is extremely important that we have in front of us, again, though it has many jurisdictional aspects, Help America Vote, or the aspect that had the provisional ballot. Let me just give you an example: 6,880 provisional ballots cast in Harris County. These ballots were determinative in many races. We lost a district attorney election and judges who happen to be African-American, who happen to be a representative from the gay community, a person who had an ethnic name, if you will. That was the allegation of why everybody else won and they did not. I take issue with that and offense. You put yourself forward and you have the credentials, you should be considered. And so up to four district court judicial races which have a current margin of 200 to 5,000 votes--all of these had these kind of indicia to them, African-American and people from distinct groups. We had documentation from the Republican provisional vote counter that said a retired business executive will chair the ballot board of 35 people, said the counting process was delayed by faulty work by Bettencourt court staff. That is our tax assessor. That is his responsibility. The problems included hundreds of voter forms whose information the registrar's staff masked with white correction fluid and then altered with new information. Also, the board has accepted ballots cast by voters whose registrations were classified by Bettencourt staff as incomplete. My question to you is: What is the angle that we should take as we place laws in place and the utilization of them become moot beyond the beltway or at least beyond this body, this Congress? Ms. Arnwine. Thank you. Ms. Jackson Lee. Barbara? Ms. Arnwine. Thank you so much. You know, we have worked together with the Prairie View students---- Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes. Ms. Arnwine [continuing]. And, you know, fighting not only their right to vote, the illegal moving of polling places, all kinds of problems together in Harris County, so thank you so much for your great advocacy. In our report, which is appended to my testimony, the Election Protection Committee Coalition reports, you know, very strongly that one of the biggest problems out there is the barriers to voter registration, which is why most provisional ballots are cast. There is some problem with registration. Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes. Ms. Arnwine. And we believe very strongly, as I said before, that the ultimate answer to this is passing a new voter registration modernization act that will be important to making sure that the states automatically register citizens at the age of 18 so that they receive their voter card and that they are able to vote. I think that if we were able to do that, provisional ballots would, in fact, decrease in their use. Provisional ballots, you know, are misused in two ways. They either are denied to people who are entitled to them, or they are overused when people should be given regular ballots. So provisional ballots have not turned out to be the panacea that many people thought it would be under the Help America Vote Act, and I think that the ultimate answer here is, you know, voter registration modernization, VRM. Ms. Jackson Lee. If the Chairman would indulge me just very quickly, I just want to mention the voter ID, Mr. Chairman. Anyone who wants to take a stab at this, we are debating the voter ID in Texas. There is no doubt that the idea was to diminish the voting impact of the last election. Should that be made a national issue? Mr. Nadler. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes, the---- Mr. Nadler. The witness may answer the question briefly. Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Should the voter ID legislation that is going around the Nation be made a national issue, voter ID legislation? Ms. Arnwine. No. Voter ID legislation is very injurious to young voters. It is injurious to African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian American voters. It is injurious to elderly voters, all of the people who normally do not have driver's license. These are very bad laws. The evidence is very strong, looking at Indiana and other states, that when you pass these strict voter ID laws based on driver's licenses that it really just---- Mr. Nadler. I thank the---- Ms. Arnwine [continuing]. Is injurious to a lot of people. Mr. Nadler. I thank the witness. I thank the panel. This panel is dismissed with our thanks, and we would ask the second panel to come forward. Ms. Arnwine. Thank you. Mr. Nadler. And we will now proceed with our second panel. I would ask the witnesses to take their places, and while they are taking their places, I will do the introductions, especially since we have our votes proceeding on the floor, but I think we can start this before we have to recess. The first witness is Tova Andrea Wang, who is vice president of research at Common Cause, where she focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and media reform. Prior to joining Common Cause, she held positions with The Century Foundation as a democracy fellow and executive director of the foundation's post-2004 Election Reform Working Group. In 2001, she was staff person for the National Commission on Federal Election co-chaired by former Presidents Carter and Ford. She is the author of numerous election reform reports, the most recent of which was Voting in 2008: 10 Swing States. She is a 1996 graduate of NYU School of Law, which I have a particular affinity of because my son is now a student at NYU School of Law, and a magna cum laude graduate of Barnard College at Columbia University. James Terry is the chief public advocate for the Consumers Rights League. Mr. Terry has managed multiple grassroots voter registration drives, including one of the most successful programs ever developed in Southern California. He served as Congressman John Campbell's chief of staff and was legislative staff of Congressman Ed Royce. Previously, Mr. Terry served as chief executive officer of the Free Enterprise Fund and as executive director of STOMP, a grassroots mobilization program, and maybe he will inform us at some point what STOMP stands for. Hilary Shelton serves as director of the NAACP's Washington Bureau, which provides the Federal legislative and public policy support for the national organization. During his long career in Washington, Mr. Shelton has advocated for the passage of important legislation, such as the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Previously, Mr. Shelton was the Federal liaison/assistant director to the government affairs department of the College Fund/UNCF and was the Federal policy program director to the United Methodist Church's social justice advocacy agency, the General Board of Church and Society. Mr. Shelton holds degrees in political science, communications, and legal studies from Howard University in Washington, DC, t"
