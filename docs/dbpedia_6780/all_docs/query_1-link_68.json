        "text": "For Immediate Release: October 30, 2008\n\nFurther information: Brent R. Carney (617) 514-1662, Brent.Carney@JFKLFoundation.org\n\nBoston, MA – On Thursday, October 30, 2008, 88,111 students from 257 Massachusetts schools cast their votes in the 2008 National Student/Parent Mock Election and elected Barack Obama as the next President of the United States. Final election results have been tabulated as follows:\n\nPresident of the United States:\n\nBarack Obama (D): 57,920 (votes) 66.27%\n\nJohn McCain (R): 25,580 29.27%\n\nChuck Baldwin (Constitution Party): 307 .35%\n\nBob Barr (L): 362 .41%\n\nCynthia McKinney (G): 565 .64%\n\nRalph Nader (ind.): 1606 1.83%\n\nWrite ins: 1052 1.2%\n\nFor more information about the National Student/Parent Mock Election, including national results, please visit www.nationalmockelection.org.\n\nClick here (pdf) for a list of schools originally scheduled to participate.\n\nThe National Student/Parent Mock Election actively engages students in state and national campaigns to emphasize the importance of voting and the power of their ballots. On October 30th, students and parents across the country cast their votes for the candidate they believe should be the next President of the United States.\n\nThe Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is the Massachusetts state headquarters for the Mock Election, and provided curriculum materials and activities to assist teachers throughout the state in preparing their students to vote. Each participating school chose a coordinator to be responsible for distributing the mock election ballots and materials to all students, teachers, and interested parents in the school, and reporting the election results to election headquarters at the Kennedy President Library on October 30.\n\nRepresentatives at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum warned that the results are not and cannot be considered a scientific sampling. Among the mock elections of the National Student/Parent Mock Election, there is no uniformity of participation, age levels, preparation of voters, or voting strategies, and therefore, the election results are not representative of any voting trend of the American public. The results should not and cannot be used as an accurate prediction, or as the basis for an accurate prediction, of real election results.\n\nSome schools also participated in position questions. Votes were tabulated for those schools participating in this portion of the election, and those results are listed below:\n\nIf miracles could happen, which one of the following Presidents would you want to lead the nation?Below are the results from this question. 19,931 students voted on this question.\n\nGeorge Washington: 3782 (votes) 18.97%\n\nThomas Jefferson: 665 3.33%\n\nAbraham Lincoln: 5220 26.19%\n\nTeddy Roosevelt: 1251 6.27%\n\nFranklin Roosevelt: 1072 5.37%\n\nHarry S.
