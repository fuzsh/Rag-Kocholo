        "text": "Though the United States is thought to have a two-party system, in reality there are a number of third-party candidates on the presidential ballot that would like to make their case for your vote. Here is a rundown of the candidates, platforms and the issues for which they stand.\n\nGreen Party: Cynthia McKinney\n\nThe Green Party has nominated former six-term U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney of Georgia as its 2008 presidential nominee, with community organizer and journalist Rosa Clemente as her running mate.\n\nMcKinney’s platform hinges on the Green Party’s “Ten Key Values,” which comprises “grassroots democracy”, “social justice and equal opportunity,” “ecological wisdom,” non-violence, decentralization, “community-based economics and economic justice,” “feminism and gender equality,” “respect for diversity,” “personal and global responsibility,” and “future focus and sustainability.”\n\nThe Green Party is one of the most popular third parties in the United States, with candidate Ralph Nader gathering 2.5 percent of the national vote in the 2000 election. More information on the Green Party can be found at www.gp.org.\n\nConstitution Party: Chuck Baldwin\n\nThe Constitution Party has nominated Florida minister Chuck Baldwin for a run at the White House, naming Darrell Castle, U.S. Marine veteran and church deacon, as his vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThe Constitution Party is a conservative organization that believes, according to its Web site (www.constitutionparty.com), that the two mainstream parties have brought the federal government beyond the bounds of what is outlined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAccording to the party’s “seven principals,” the Constitution Party is pro-life, anti gay marriage, in favor of smaller government, privacy, and states' rights.\n\nIndependent: Ralph Nader\n\nRalph Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez are not a part of any political party, instead embracing a grassroots campaign to put their names on as many ballots in the United States.\n\nNader was the Green Party’s candidate in 1996 and 2000, then ran in 2004 and 2008 without any political affiliation. His history is one of activism, first against the auto industry in the 1960s and '70s but later against all corporate intervention in politics.\n\nSome believe Nader’s slice of the voters in 2008 caused Al Gore to lose the election. He responded to MSNBC’s Tim Russert about the possibility of preventing a Democrat victory in 2008 by saying, “Not a chance. If the Democrats can’t landslide the Republicans this year, they ought to just wrap up, close down, and emerge in a different form.”\n\nMore information about Nader, his politics and his history can be found at www.votenader.org.\n\nLouisiana Taxpayers Party: Ron Paul\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul was nominated by the Louisiana Taxpayers Party and has Barry Goldwater Jr., former seven-term Republican U.S. Congressman from California, as his vice-presidential running mate.\n\nThe Louisiana Taxpayers Party shares much in common with the Republican Party and the Constitution Party. In particular, their core platform on many issues is met with “less government.”\n\n“For every political issue on the national scene today, we believe the simple remedy of less government should be applied. We endorse the idea of voluntarism, self-responsibility, family, friends, and churches to solve problems, rather than saying that a monolithic government is going to,” reads the \"About Us\" page on its Web site, www.lataxpayers.com.\n\nRon Paul made news earlier in the year as a candidate for the Republican nomination for president, until he dropped out of the race June 12, putting the money he would have run his campaign with into a political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul’s Campaign for Liberty (www.campaignforliberty.com.)\n\nProhibition: Gene Amondson\n\nGene Amondson, a minister from Alaska, is the presidential candidate for the Prohibition Party, a party whose mission is to do away with the 21st Amendment, which was itself a repeal of the 18th Amendment, that of the prohibition against the sale, manufacture and transportation of alcohol.\n\nThe Prohibition party’s focus is on a variety of issues, dispute their singular name, and are conservative in temperament. Their platform is pro-life, anti-gambling, anti-gay (their Web site says they are against the “homosexual agenda”), anti-pornography, pro-school prayer, and “against the commercial sale of alcohol and other harmful drugs,” according to www.prohibition.org.\n\nAdmondson is a vocal activist against the use of alcohol, appearing at events, giving speeches and performing a dramatization of late 19th-century pastor and activist William Ashley “Billy” Sunday’s sermon on temperance.\n\nMore information about Gene Admondson at his personal site, www.geneamondson.com.\n\nSocialism and Liberation: Gloria La Riva\n\nGloria La Riva of California, a politician who has run for president first as a candidate for the Workers World Party (of which the Socialism and Liberation party is a break-off) as well as run for Governor of California in 1994 and 1998.\n\nThe Socialism and Liberation party is a “revolutionary party” that wishes to replace capitalism with socialism. Their charge is that capitalism is “the source of the main problems confronting humanity today: imperialist war, poverty, exploitation, layoffs, unemployment, racism, sexism, lesbian/gay/bi/trans oppression, environmental destruction, mass imprisonment, unionbusting, and more,” according to www.pslweb.org.\n\nSocialist Workers Party: James Harris\n\nJames Harris, an African American activist, and Maggie Trowe, his vice presidential candidate, are the Socialist Workers Party ticket for president on Louisiana's ballot, though according to their Web site, Roger Calero of New York is their national candidate.\n\nThe Socialist Workers Party is in support of the legalization for immigrant workers in the United States, along with a renewed intrest in getting unions more power, along with an unemployment plan to have the government put non-working people to work building schools, public transportation, hospitals and homes.\n\nThe Socialist Workers newsletter can be found at www.themilitant.com.\n\nAll information about the above parties was researched from their Web sites and other online sources and compiled by the Southwest Daily News."
