        "text": "Your leader on the US presidential election (October 27) referred to \"the two US presidential candidates\". There are, in fact, six candidates. The others, in addition to Obama and McCain, are: Ralph Nader, Independent; former congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Green party, who is black; former congressman Bob Barr, Libertarian party; and Baptist pastor and radio talkshow host Chuck Baldwin, Constitution party. They get little, if any, mention in your paper and clearly have no hope of getting to the White House. But it is to be hoped you will at least tell us this week how many votes they get.\n\nKenneth Brown\n\nBisley, Gloucestershire\n\nReggie Love (The man behind the man, October 29) is also the name of a character in John Grisham's The Client (played by Susan Sarandon in the film). She is someone who comes through to do good, despite corporate, political and illegal adversity. Hopefully, this bodes well for the Obama campaign.\n\nStewart Eaton\n\nCologne, Germany\n\nThe video report from Kansas City, Missouri, moved me to tears (Meet Joe 12 Pack - an Obama volunteer, October 29). As an American who has lived in Scotland for 17 years, I find the efforts of the Obama-Biden volunteers there utterly remarkable. To see young and old from every race and background working so tirelessly renders me speechless. Thanks so much for making it possible for those of us so far away to experience a bit of what is happening at home.\n\nSharon Roe\n\nSt Andrews, Fife\n\nThirty years ago, when Zimbabwe was coming to birth, several people, working independently (like Leibniz and Newton on calculus) discerned that Mugabe backwards spelt the Yorkshire exclamation \"E ba gum\". But no one has published the equally world-shattering news that Obama spelt backwards is the singular first-person future tense for \"I will love\" in Latin: \"amabo\".\n\nIain Innes Burgess\n\nHampton Wick, Middlesex"
