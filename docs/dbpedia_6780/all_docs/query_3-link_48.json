        "text": "By Brandon Moseley\n\nAlabama Political Reporter\n\nFriday, December 9, 2016, Constitution Party executive committee members from across the country met on the campus of the University of Alabama in Huntsville following the 2016 Presidential election. 2016 Constitution Party Presidential candidate Darrell Castle addressed the group about the election and US foreign policy.\n\nDarrell Castle told the group, I have been involved in seven different elections with the Constitution Party and I am very proud that this one (in 2016) and 2008 when I ran as Chuck Baldwin’s Vice Presidential candidate were the ones where the party did best. “I am very proud of that.”\n\nOn foreign policy, Castle said that the United States has had an invade all and invite all policy. We have invaded all of these countries and killed about four million people (that was not just us). In the Clinton Administration 500,000 Iraqis, mostly children, starved to death due to our sanctions and Secretary of State Madeline Albright said that it was worth it.\n\nCastle said, We have brought destruction to Damascus and Aleppo, Syria as well as Somalia, Libya and Algeria. War is still going on in Libya. These countries are about 98 percent Muslim. We kill all of these people. We destroy their homelands and then say why don’t you come to America, especially military age young men.\n\nCastle said that the student who perpetuated the attack on Ohio State University was from Somalia. It is a war torn country of about ten million people. Now 1.2 percent of the population live inside the United States. Illegal immigration is a problem but it is not the problem. Legal immigration is the problem. All these Somalis are here legally. He and his family spent seven years in a refugee camp in Pakistan. Then we asked him to come to the United States and study at Columbus State. He did and studied for two years. He talked about islamophobia all the time on the internet. Then he transferred to Ohio State, all of this at taxpayer expense. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. He went on the internet and said that he was upset with how Muslims were being treated in Myanmar. He drove his car over until he crashed it and started stabbing people with a machete or a butcher knife. Finally a police officer sent him to paradise with three gunshot wounds.\n\nCastle said that we invite all these people to America to do what they do at taxpayer expense. “Stop doing it. Stop invading and stop inviting that would be my advice. Muslims have been trying to fight and take over Europe for 1500 years; but the Christian faith stood up to them and said no. “Once Europe abandoned the faith all those barriers came down.” Europe and America have abandoned the faith. Return to the faith and we survive. Don’t and we don’t survive. It is that simple.”\n\nCastle said that he and his wife, Joan, had fun campaigning for President. “It was a labor of love. I won’t way that we enjoyed every minute of it but we enjoyed most of it.”\n\nConstitution Party Chairman Frank Fluckiger said that the party reached an all-time high in their vote totals. The Party’s goal was 200,000 votes and today we certified over 210,000. We can win with 70 million votes more. Our message got out thru the internet. The Libertarian and Green Parties had predicted our demise in this election and were shocked that we did so well."
