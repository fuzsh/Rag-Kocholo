AFAIK, if a third party candidate gets 5% or more of the popular vote (nationwide, regardless of their status on the ballot in every state), they (or their party) will be eligible for federal public funding in the next election. That would go a very long way towards breaking the current red/blue system if you're not happy with it.<BR><BR>I live in CA, and I'll vote for Obama, because he truly is a great candidate in my mind, and I do not have a problem with a strong two-party system. Outside of Obama, I'd vote for Nader or Ron Paul.<BR><BR>For reference, Nader received 2.75% of the vote in 2000, which was almost 3 million votes. To get 5% would require over 5 million, the exact number being subject to voter turnout. That's not actually that large of a number, and I suspect that if more people were aware that their third party candidates can receive some sort of victory even without actually winning the election, more people would cast their votes that way.\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div>\n\n<div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\">Originally posted by bcherry:<br>I don't know who you would vote for, but voting for a third-party or independent candidate is much more important than voting for a sure loser </div>\n\n</blockquote>Fair enough.

But if the politics doesn't matter to you, then that is fine as well. The right to not vote is just as important as the right to vote. I was merely providing some useful information for the massive number of people out there who choose not to vote.<br><br>I'm not checking these numbers, but as I recall, voter turnout is about 60% usually. with 300 million people in the US, there have to be at least 250 million eligible voters. that means there are somewhere more than 80 million people who don't vote. If even a small fraction of that (1 in 20) were to cast their vote for a single third party candidate, it could vastly change the politics of the United States.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\">Originally posted by bcherry:<BR>I'm not checking these numbers, but as I recall, voter turnout is about 60% usually. with 300 million people in the US, there have to be at least 250 million eligible voters. that means there are somewhere more than 80 million people who don't vote.

Of course, since they don't vote, it's hard to figure that out since they aren't at the exit polls or anything.<BR><BR>I see the following groups a non-voter could fall into:<BR><BR>1) Don't care/apathetic<BR>2) Don't know they can vote<BR>3) Don't feel informed enough to make a decision<BR>4) Feel vote is worthless (i.e. in MA or AL)<BR>5) Disgruntled with the system, no good major candidates (also could fall into (4))<BR>6) Forgot to vote, didn't know where to vote<BR>7) Didn't have time on election day<BR><BR>There might be more, but those seem to be the obvious ones. If even a small proportion of these 50 million+ non-voters were in category 5, (just 1 in 10), they could make a real difference if they understood the way things work.\n\ni'm one of those i guess 40% non voters.<br><br>for one i'm in KY, so it'll be mccain all the way except in the city i live in, but it won't make a difference.<br><br>i don't like the system, and well, don't care either. it's fun reading these threads and all, but at the end of the day, all of em are fuckers and i couldn't care less who the hell america votes in. as we've seen, the election seems to hinge more on cult of personality than anything solid, so meh.<br><br>but i do get election day off work. that's a plus in my book. -- View image here: http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee_common/emoticons/icon_smile.gif --"
