Other issues included health care, the Iraq War, the war on terrorism, and energy independence.\n\nThe president during the election, George W. Bush (who eventually supported John McCain), was very unpopular due to the 2007-09 \"great recession\", and because of that, the Obama campaign compared McCain to Bush several times.\n\nThere were four television debates during the campaign: three of them were between the two presidential candidates, and one of them was between the two vice-presidential candidates.\n\nResults\n\nCandidate Votes % States led National ECV Barack Obama (Democrat) 69,498,516 52.9% 28+DC+NE-02 365 John McCain (Republican) 59,948,323 45.7% 22 173 Ralph Nader (Independent) 739,034 0.56% 0 0 Bob Barr (Libertarian) 523,715 0.40% 0 0 Chuck Baldwin (Constitution) 199,750 0.15% 0 0 Cynthia McKinney (Green) 161,797 0.12% 0 0 Other 242,685 0.18% 0 0 Total 131,313,820 100.00% 50 + DC 538\n\nResults by state\n\nState Obama Popular Vote Obama % McCain Popular Vote McCain % Electoral Vote Alabama 813,479 38.74% 1,266,546 60.32% 9 Alaska 123,594 37.89% 193,841 59.42% 3 Arizona 1,034,707 45.12% 1,230,111 53.64% 10 Arkansas 422,310 38.86% 638,017 58.72% 6 California 8,274,473 41.01% 5,011,781 36.95% 55 Colorado 1,288,633 53.66% 1,073,629 44.71% 9 Connecticut 997,772 60.59% 629,428 38.22% 7 Delaware 255,429 61.94% 152,374 36.95% 3 District of Columbia 245,800 92.46% 17,367 6.53% 3 Florida 4,282,074 51.03% 4,045,624 48.22% 27 Georgia 1,844,123 46.99% 2,048,759 52.20% 15 Hawaii 325,871 71.85% 120,566 26.58% 4 Idaho 236,440 36.09% 403,012 61.52% 4 Illinois 3,419,308 61.92% 2,031,179 36.78% 21 Indiana 1,374,039 49.95% 1,345,648 48.91% 11 Iowa 828,940 53.93% 682,379 44.39% 7 Kansas 514,765 41.95% 699,655 56.61% 6 Kentucky 751,985 41.17% 1,048,462 57.40% 8 Louisiana 782,989 39.93% 1,148,275 58.56% 9 Maine 421,923 57.71% 295,273 40.38% 4 Maryland 1,629,467 61.92% 959,862 36.47% 10 Massachusetts 1,904,097 61.80% 1,108,854 35.99% 12 Michigan 2,872,579 57.43% 2,048,639 40.96% 17 Minnesota 1,573,354 54.06% 1,275,409 43.82% 10 Mississippi 554,662 43.00% 724,597 56.18% 6 Missouri 1,441,911 49.29% 1,445,814 49.43% 11 Montana 231,667 47.25% 242,763 49.51% 3 Nebraska 333,319 41.60% 452,479 56.53% 5 Nevada 533,736 55.15% 412,827 42.65% 5 New Hampshire 384,826 54.13% 316,534 44.52% 4 New Jersey 2,215,422 57.27% 1,613,207 41.70% 15 New Mexico 472,422 56.91% 346,832 41.78% 5 New York 4,804,945 62.88% 2,752,771 36.03% 31 North Carolina 2,142,651 49.70% 2,128,474 49.38% 15 North Dakota 141,278 44.62% 168,601 53.25% 3 Ohio 2,940,044 51.50% 2,677,820 46.91% 20 Oklahoma 502,496 34.35% 960,165 65.65% 7 Oregon 1,037,291 56.75% 738,475 40.40% 7 Pennsylvania 3,276,363 54.49% 2,655,885 44.17% 21 Rhode Island 296,571 62.86% 165.391 35.06% 4 South Carolina 862,449 44.90% 1,034,896 53.87% 8 South Dakota 170,924 44.75% 203,054 53.16% 3 Tennessee 1,087,437 41.83% 1,479,178 56.90% 11 Texas 3,528,633 43.68% 4,479,328 55.45% 34 Utah 327,670 34.41% 596,030 62.58% 5 Vermont 219,262 67.46% 98,974 30.45% 3 Virginia 1,959,532 52.63% 1,725,005 46.33% 13 Washington 1,750,848 57.65% 1,229,216 40.48% 11 West Virginia 303,857 42.59% 397,466 55.71% 5 Wisconsin 1,677,211 56.22% 1,262,393 42.31% 10 Wyoming 82,868 32.54% 164,958 64.78% 3\n\nImages for kids\n\nGeorge W.

Oklahoma had all counties go to McCain. Alaska does not display its boroughs on this map.\n\nPresidential popular votes by county as a scale from red/Republican to blue/Democratic.\n\nCartogram of popular vote with each county rescaled in proportion to its population. Deeper blue represents a Democratic majority, brighter red represents a Republican majority.\n\nVoting shifts per county from the 2004 to the 2008 election.
