This Baldwin guy just seems to be a puppet candidate with nothing to add to the debate except strange comments about how McCain was the mastermind behind September 11. Great choice, Dr Paul. Jeesh.\n\nHell no.\n\nThis is more dysfunctional than an episode of Dynasty.\n\nYes, I believe he did. The American people could then make a more informed decision. Voting for someone you truly believe in is more important than voting the lesser of two evils. I could not live with myself if I voted for either Dem's or Rep's in the Presidential election, when I do not believe that their change is the change that we desperately need. I watched both the Democrat and the Republican conventions. From what I saw Obama's change was going back to the old spend and expand the government. The Republican's are not much better since they have expanded government spending tremendously over the last 8 years. There are certain things that should be left to the states to manage. If education was left at the state level then we could save a lot of money by not having to fund the Dept of Education because the states would be funding there own local departments. Don't get me started on taxes. What is wrong with a straight 10% across the board tax as oppose to the messed up tax system we have today. People should not have to higher an accountant so they can get back as much as they can in their tax refund. I keep hearing how there was surplus in the late 90's. How could their be a surplus if we still had a hugh trillion dollar debt? Any way I suggest you check out one of the third party candidates for real change. It is better than voting for someone you do not believe would best represent your views. As for me I am voting for Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party. He best represents my views than anyone else I have found today.\n\n\"Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost.\" John Quincy Adams\n\n- Click to the http://constitutionparty.com - Forging a Rebirth of Freedom http://www.baldwin08.com - Chuck Baldwin for President\n\nhttp://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog/?p=582 Friends - please read this new and important piece by Dr. Paul.\n\nThere was a \"surplus\" in the 90's because the government was taking in more money than they spent, thus helping reduce the national debt --199.190.223.190\n\nFor the above question of how a surplus works with a trillion dollar debt, a federal government budget surplus would imply the debt is not getting larger, and there is money which could have been (theoretically) used to pay off the debt. I think that a big part of that surplus in the Clinton years, though, was due to fancy accounting, and not due to actually taking in more money than they were spending. The debt we owe to the Federal Reserve is bull, though (and that's something like 40% of the public debt). How does the government pay back the interest and principle on that? By \"borrowing\" money from the Fed (the Fed creates it out of thin air), at interest. 207.224.116.239\n\nOf course he did. Would he really support Barr? I don't think so. Too bad he didn't do it long ago though. Chuck is a far better choice.\n\nI am glad Ron Paul endorsed Chuck Baldwin. Dr. Baldwin is very close to Dr. Paul's views, ie pro life, pro constitution and anti Fed. I have placed a Chuck Baldwin sign in my yard and will walk my precinct for Chuck.\n\nRick Martin, Buhl, Idaho\n\nChuck Baldwin, although a church pastor with a strong pro-life stance, believes correctly that the Constitution does not authorize the federal government to rule on abortion, save for a constitutional amendment. Little by little, the Democratic and Republican parties are starting to realize that their two party dictatorship is starting to be seen by the American people for the sham it really is. I believe that Bob Barr forced Paul into making some kind of endorsement by not attending the press conference, making many Libertarian voters question their own plans to vote for Barr and wondering who else they should consider voting for. I don't believe that Paul made this endorsement out of spite. Barr shot himself in the foot by wrongly choosing to skip the press conference, big time. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.108.119.137 (talk)\n\nI am disappointed that Paul chose to endorse this candidate. There are several non-liberty stances taken by the Constitution Party. Anonymous101talk\n\nWhat other choices does he have? Fephisto (talk)\n\n3rd party candiates don't win. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.160.148.62 (talk)\n\nSo? The point of voting isn't to win. Fephisto (talk)\n\nThe views and goals of a religious fanatic are incompatable with libertarian views. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 204.68.32.6 (talk)\n\nIs there any cite for the claim that \"Snubgate\" has actually caused Barr to \"rapidly decrease in popularity\"? Sure, there are a lot of people complaining on-line about him, but by and large they're the same people that were complaining about him before. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.245.21.167 (talk)\n\nI actually began for a brief time to actually warm up to Ron Paul, who was giving a broad endorsement to alternative politics, but now he turns his back on that and gives a sole endorsement to fucking Chuck (wants to build a bible based government) Baldwin? Nothing even remotely constitutional about this guy, I'd rather vote for McCain and Obama while eating dogshit then vote for him.\n\nAbsolutely yes. Chuck is a man who can be trusted to do the right thing. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.192.145.146 (talk)\n\n\"Although he refers to himself as \"The Abraham Lincoln of this generation\", he has also spoken of Lincoln (along with Woodrow Wilson) as one of the two \"worst presidents\" in history. Baldwin is also a supporter of private schools and an opponent of the Department of Education.\"\n\n-Wikipedia Article on Chuck Baldwin\n\nThis shows that the man is clearly not educated. He practically called himself the worst choice for President and is still running. Instead of education reform he wants to get rid of the whole system so only the elite can be educated. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.7.229.31 (talk)\n\nBarr is not a libertarian by any means, McCain/Obama I believe have already been commented on, and Cynthia/Nader are socialists. Fephisto (talk)\n\nThird party politics should be about a professional bid for a more diverse political scene, not a popularity contest. Paul did the right thing to delegitimize Barr's grandstanding. —Shii (talk)"
