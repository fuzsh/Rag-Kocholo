The Srpska Open has gathered the best Serbian tennis players at the moment, together with Novak Djokovic at the helm and tennis returnee Nenad Zimonjic. A wild card for the tournament in Banjaluka was awarded to one of the best tennis players in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Damir Dzumhur, who participated at last year’s tournament in Belgrade as well.

Having them all together in one place, it is only logical that they will practice together. Thus, yesterday, under the watchful eye of Serbian Davis Cup team captain Viktor Troicki, Filip Krajinovic and Damir Dzumhur practiced together. The practice session was very demanding and both players seriously approached the task but their faces also revealed that they were both happy to participate at the Srpska Open tournament.

In the first round, Damir Dzumhur will meet a qualifier whereas Krajinovic will fight for his spot in the second round against Dušan Lajovic.
