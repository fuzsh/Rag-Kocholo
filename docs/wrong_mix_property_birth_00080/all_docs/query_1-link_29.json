        "text": "TEN is an architecture, design and research association working on the principle that value is an outcome of design effort. Its engagement on public themes of interest and open research on the built environment is shaped by its common statute.\n\nTEN is composed as a record label, providing new formats for interdependent work groups with emphasis on design by research. It aims to conceive, explore and produce ideas that both state and expand upon emerging practices in the built environment. Its focus lies on producing new realities by means of building prototypes, urban propositions, algorithmic design, and materials research with a range of collaborators, colleagues, institutional partners and private clients. TEN is currently focused on developing models for affordable living with particular focus on cohabitation, either through invited studies, prequalified competitions or in self-initiated collaborations.\n\nTEN is a Swiss Art Award laureate (Architecture 2018) and recently received the Foundation Award for Emerging Swiss Architects (2020). Its members are regularly invited and awarded for their contributions to Swiss and international design competitions. The work of its members has been published and presented across numerous digital and printed platforms, magazines and academic journals.\n\nTEN has most recently been nominated for the prestigious Mies van der Rohe Award 2022 for its prototype Avala House and the World Bank Resilient Housing Award for its construction model for the redevelopment of the Thame Valley, Nepal.\n\nAleksandra Bašić MArch\n\nCyrill Wechsler MSc ETH Arch\n\nDanijela Jovicic MSc ETH Arch\n\nDavid Stöger Dipl Ing Arch\n\nDunja Dedic MArch\n\nFabian Launer MSc ETH Arch\n\nFabiana Frisullo MSc ETH Arch\n\nJelena Perović Dipl Ing Arch\n\nJoel Zimmerli MSc ETH Arch\n\nLuka Piškorec MSc ETH Arch (PhD)\n\nLukas Burkhart MSc ETH Arch\n\nMariapaola Michelotto MArch\n\nNenad Pavlovic MArch\n\nNemanja Zimonjić MSc ETH Arch\n\nNicolas Rothenbühler MSc ETH Arch\n\nOgnjen Krašna MArch\n\nPeter Marcus Bach PhD Eng\n\nScott Lloyd MSc ETH Arch\n\nSofia Boarino Msc.
