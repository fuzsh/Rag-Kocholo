        "text": "The top doubles pairing of Mahesh Bhupathi and Fabrice Santoro were the first to move into the semis at the Dubai Duty Free Men's Open with a 6-1, 6-3 win against Nikolay Davydenko and Feliciano Lopez.\n\nBhupathi and Santoro, who have already won the doubles crown at the Auckland Open earlier this year, seem headed towards a final against second seeds Leander Paes and Jonas Bjorkman, who were playing against Paul Hanley and Nenad Zimonjic.\n\n\"We enjoy playing with each other,\" Bhupathi said of his win alongside Santoro.\n\n\"This win definitely feels nice as each match is a step closer to the title,\" Bhupathi added.\n\nThe top seeds never had any problems in their second round game against the Russian and Spanish combination as they came up with breaks in the second and sixth games to eventually win the set 6-1.\n\nThe second set was more closely contested, but the superior net play from the Indo-French pair saw them dominate and win a crucial break on Davydenko's serve to walk away with the set and match 6-4."
