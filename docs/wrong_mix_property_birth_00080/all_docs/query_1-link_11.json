Tests athletes at domestic and international competitions in the country, as well as when there is no competition, performs analyzes, determines the penalty after a possible violation of the rules, gives recommendations and advice to combat doping, etc. In November 2005, the Serbian Parliament adopted law on the prevention of doping in sports, which established the agency.In addition to athletes, ADAS also tests horses in equestrian sports. The agency punishes athletes who use funds from the illicit list, as well as coaches who give them to athletes. Penalties are most often in the form of a ban on competition for a certain period of time, sometimes for life, and there are also fines.\n\nSerbian fan groups have a long history. They follow their clubs at home matches, but also abroad. Many groups are extreme. Serbian fan groups are connected in fraternal relations with fans from Russia and Greece.\n\nBeli Orlovi\n\nCrveni Đavoli\n\nDelije\n\nFirma\n\nGrobari\n\nMarinci\n\nMeraklije\n\nPlava unija\n\nUnited Force\n\nInterrupted matches:\n\nPartizan - Zrinjski Mostar UEFA expelled Partizan from the 2007–08 UEFA Cup due to crowd trouble at their away tie in Mostar, which forced the match to be interrupted for 10 minutes. UEFA adjudged travelling Partizan fans to have been the culprits of the trouble, but Partizan were allowed to play the return leg while the appeal was being processed. However, Partizan's appeal was rejected so Zrinjski Mostar qualified.\n\nDinamo–Red Star riot It took the Zagreb police about 15 minutes to surround Zvezda's fans and calm them down, but it was not easy, because there was a big fight between the police and Zvezda's fans in which one police officer was seriously injured. Then, the Zagreb police managed to take Zvezda's fans, accompanied by them, to Maksimir Park, not far from the stadium, with the intention of keeping them there until the beginning of the game and escorting them to the stadium, but they did not succeed, because Zvezda the fans mostly pulled out of that hoop. In the very center of Zagreb, there were several fights, between Zvezda and Dinamo fans, in which two Dinamo fans were seriously injured.When the start of the match was approaching, the Zagreb police escorted Zvezda's fans (there were over 2,000 of them) to the south stand of the Maksimir Stadium. Even while the stands were filled with the audience, verbal skirmishes and standard name-calling of Zvezda and Dinamo fans started, followed by mutual insults, even on a national basis.As soon as a few minutes of the match were played, Dinamo fans of the \"Bad Blue Boys\" very easily broke down the protective fence on the north stand of the Maksimir Stadium.A physical confrontation between Dinamo and Zvezdaš followed, which lasted for almost an hour, and part of those riots were recorded by the cameras of TV Zagreb.Almost three hours after this unplayed match, Zvezda fans were detained at the demolished Maksimir Stadium. At that time, they were provided with buses that transported them to Dugo Selo, a suburb of Zagreb, and then they were taken by an emergency train to Belgrade, where they arrived in the morning hours of May 14, 1990.\n\nSerbia v Albania match was abandoned with the score at 0–0 shortly before halftime after \"various incidents\", which resulted in the Albania players refusing to return to the field. UEFA ruled that Albania had forfeited the match and awarded a 3–0 win to Serbia, but also deducted three points from Serbia for their involvement in the events. Serbia must also play their next two home qualifying games behind closed doors, and both the Serbian and Albanian FAs were fined €100,000. Both the Serbian and Albanian football associations were looking to have the decision revisited, but the decision was upheld by UEFA. Both associations then filed further appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and on 10 July 2015 the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected the appeal filed by the Serbian FA, and upheld in part the appeal filed by the Albanian FA, meaning the match is deemed to have been forfeited by Serbia with 0–3 and they are still deducted three points. Serbian FA announced appeal at the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland.\n\nItaly v Serbia match was abandoned after six minutes due to rioting by Serbian fans.The match was stopped after only six minutes due to riots caused by the visiting fans. The match was supposed to start at 20.50, but the start was postponed for more than half an hour because the visiting fans threw torches on the field, but also among the home spectators, and one fell very close to the home goalkeeper Viviani, so the referee decided to return the players to the locker rooms until the police bring order to the stadium.In the meantime, the police isolated Serbian fans in the stands and it seemed that the situation calmed down, so the match, after the appeal of the Serbian national team, started with a delay of 35 minutes. But after just a few minutes of play and new torches thrown into the pitch, Scottish referee Craig Thomson definitely stopped the match.On the eve of the match, a group of Serbian fans attacked goalkeeper Vladimir Stojković at the moment when the bus with Serbian players was heading towards the stadium. A more serious incident was prevented, but Stojković refused to defend, so Željko Brkić took his place in the first team. The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body awarded the match as a 3–0 forfeit win to Italy.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro v Bosnia and Herzegovina played a deciding match on the last matchday of 2006 World Cup qualifying, The circumstances and high stakes made this an extremely important clash for Serbia. Not to mention the fact that both nations were parts of SFR Yugoslavia, which further raised the tensions. Going into the last matchday, Serbia-Montenegro was top of the group - two points ahead of second placed Spain and three points in spare compared to the third placed Bosnia-Herzegovina. Spain, however, was to play the minnows of the group San Marino and was virtually assured a win. With such highly probable scenario in the Spanish game, Serbia-Bosnia clash in Belgrade gained extra significance. The points advantage on top seemingly gave Serbia an advantage, but they still almost certainly needed a win because the math was mind-boggling. If the Belgrade score was to be tied, Serbia and Spain would then be equal on points at the top of the group and their two previous matches would have to decide who gets the first spot and automatic qualification. However, both of those games ended in ties (0-0 in Belgrade, 1–1 in Madrid), and according to FIFA rules, unlike UEFA's, away goals count for nothing, so goal difference would be the next deciding factor. That meant that if Bosnia managed to get a tie in Belgrade and Spain beat San Marino by a 4-goal margin, the Spaniards would be on top and Serbia would go into the playoffs. Bosnia was also not without a chance - if it managed to beat Serbia by any score in Belgrade, it would've become tied on points with Serbia, but would overtake it because the first match in Sarajevo ended in a 0–0 tie. Right from the start the tensions were extremely high, the stadium was packed . Mateja Kežman put the Serbs up in 7th minute, and the lead was not relinquished until the end. Serbia-Montenegro qualified directly for Germany 2006, sparking jubilant scenes all over Serbia & Montenegro. A physical confrontation followed, which was started by the fans of the home team, and torches, stones, parts of broken chairs flew to the tribune of BiH fans ...UEFA then stood calmly and watched the clashes in the stands, the captain of Bosnia and Herzegovina. of the national team, Sergei Barbarez pointed out to the judges the war being waged in the stands, but no one reacted. BiH fans suffered serious injuries, and a fan comment that cheered on the visiting national team while showing a wound on their forehead spoke more than any other word that night.\n\nSerbia–Croatia semifinal (2012 European Men's Handball Championship) Events during the competition and later during the semifinal match: On 24 January 2012, after the match between Croatia and France, Serbian hooligans attacked Croatian fans in several locations in northern Serbia. In Novi Sad, Croatian supporters were heading home after the game, when they ran into a road block and some 50 masked men assaulted them with stones, bricks and axes, smashing windscreens. The attack left several supporters injured and one of them hospitalized. In Ruma, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) south from Novi Sad, a Croatian van was set on fire and one of the passengers stabbed with a knife.A day later the unrest continued and many cars were damaged, torched, or burnt out throughout Novi Sad. The Croatian Foreign Ministry officially complained to Serbian Ambassador Stanimir Vukicevic over the attacks; Vukicevic expressed regret and stated that the Serbian police was already taking the necessary steps. Thirteen people were arrested in connection with the incident, including Ivan Ključovski and Jovan Bajić, leaders of a fan group from Novi Sad, and a member of the Obraz right-wing organization. After questioning, all of them remained in custody for a month. Serbia and Croatia met in the semi-final of the tournament, which caused further concern on both sides. About 5,000 policemen were deployed to ensure the security of the fans, while in Croatia some tourist agencies cancelled trips for the match and the Croatian Handball Federation (Hrvatski rukometni savez, HRS) also recommended not to go to Serbia as the supporters' safety might not be guaranteed. Spokesman Zlatko Skrinjar also added that the HRS had planned to organize trips for the event, however, they changed their mind due to the incidents in the preceding days. On the Croatian-Serbian border, joint checkpoints were set up to prevent hooligans and other groups who have no ticket for the match to enter Serbia, and to escort the fans with tickets from the border to Belgrade. The police reported that there were no incidents during the match, which was eventually won by the Serbians 26–22, however, a bottle actually meant for Croatian playmaker Ivano Balić and coach Slavko Goluža hit Serbian back player Žarko Šešum, severely injuring his eye. Šešum's eye suffered significant bleeding. After the trauma he had only minimal vision on the affected eye, but the risk of permanent sight loss was reportedly averted. Morten Stig Christensen, Secretary of the Danish Handball Federation, Serbia's opponent in the final said that he was \"severely shocked\" by the incident and so were the people from the European Handball Federation with whom he spoke. Christensen also added that he was shocked that although there were more than five thousand security personnel at the stadium, the hooligans still managed to sneak in Roman candles and laser lights.\n\nSerbian fans hold the record for the largest visit to the EuroCup Basketball\n\nHighest attendance records:\n\n24,232 attendance for Red Star Belgrade in a 79–70 win over Budivelnyk Kyiv, at Kombank Arena, Belgrade, on 26 March 2014.\n\n22,736 attendance for Red Star Belgrade in a 63–52 win over UNICS Kazan, at Kombank Arena, Belgrade, on 2 April 2014.\n\nSerbian fans hold the record for the largest visit to the Euroleague\n\nRank Home team Score Away team Attendance Arena Date Ref 1 Partizan 63–56 Panathinaikos 22,567 Belgrade Arena 5 March 2009 [1] 2 Partizan 76–67 Maccabi Tel Aviv 21,367 Belgrade Arena 1 April 2010 [2] 3 Partizan 56–67 CSKA Moscow 21,352 Belgrade Arena 31 March 2009 [3] 4 Partizan 81–73 Maccabi Tel Aviv 20,783 Belgrade Arena 30 March 2010 [4]\n\nSeason averages Euroleague:\n\nSeason Total gate Games Average Change High avg.
