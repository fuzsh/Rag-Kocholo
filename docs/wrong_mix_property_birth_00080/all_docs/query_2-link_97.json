        "text": "Serbian tennis legend Novak Djokovic has been unable to find the perfect coach for himself ever since he parted ways with longtime coach Goran Ivanisevic. As the long partnership between the two individuals came to an end, there have been speculations about who would replace Ivanisevic as Djokovic’s head coach.\n\nDjokovic has said that he is mulling that option as well. The 36-year-old has said that while he had a good time with Nenad Zimonjic, he has not yet decided upon it. Djokovic said that he would come up with a decision in some time.\n\nI am considering that as well, whether I should or shouldn’t have the coach. I had a really good time with Nenad Zimonjić as my coach the last three weeks so we’re talking about continuing and seeing. Let’s see, I’m going to make the decision in the next period.\n\nNovak Djokovic has said about his coach (H/T: The Guardian)\n\nWhile a few names were doing the round, Djokovic has not made any official announcements about who would be joining him for the rest of the season. The Serbian has even hinted about him trusting himself for the coaching role.\n\nNovak Djokovic explains the rationale behind thinking about ‘no coach’ option\n\nNovak Djokovic further talked about his coaching team and what he is currently thinking. The 24-time Grand Slam champion highlighted the importance of having a coaching team. Djokovic said that having a great coaching team creates a formula for success.\n\nHowever, the Serbian does not want to rush things and relies on his 20 years of experience to get things done. Djokovic said that having no coach is also an opinion for him.\n\nI’m not rushing. I feel like playing tennis over 20 years and having a lot of different teams and coaches, it’s not like I think I don’t need a coach at all. I think there’s always value in having that quality team and fitness coach, physio, mental coach. It’s all important. It creates a formula for success...But I think I’m in the stage of my career where I can afford to maybe think having no coach is also an option. Let’s see. I’m going to make my decision soon.\n\nNovak Djokovic said.\n\nNotably, Djokovic announced his shock decision to part ways with Goran Ivanisevic soon after his third-round exit at Indian Wells. He competed at the Monte Carlo Masters without an official coach. It is to be seen how long before Djokovic decides to appoint someone as his head coach.\n\nThe Serbian ace has not won a title this season and the coaching fiasco is only acting as a distraction for Djokovic. The 24-time Grand Slam winner needs to come up with a solution at the earliest if he hopes to add a couple of more major titles.\n\nIn case you missed it:"
