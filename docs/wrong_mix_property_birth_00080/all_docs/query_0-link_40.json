        "text": "Belgrade will host this year’s Davis Cup final between Serbia and France, the International Tennis Federation announced this week.\n\nThe December 3-5 match-up pits first-time finalists Serbia against nine-time champions France, who last appeared at this stage of the competition back in 2002.\n\nSerbia reached the final for the first time in their 16-year history in the competition after coming from behind to defeat the Czech Republic 3-2 in their semi-final in Belgrade at the weekend.\n\nSerbia are bidding to become only the 13th Davis Cup champion nation after a spectacular run to the 2010 final. The country only made their World Group debut in 2008, winning their first World Group tie earlier this year.\n\nJanko Tipsarevic was the hero of his country’s victory over the Czechs, sending the 17,000 spectators into a frenzy with his 6-0, 7-6 (8/6), 6-4 victory over Radek Stepanek in the deciding rubber.\n\nWith Novak Djokovic sidelined on the first day, Victor Troicki lost to Stepanek 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 in the opening rubber, before Tipsarevic levelled the tie with a 7-5, 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory over Tomas Berdych.\n\nDjokovic and Nenad Zimonjic then suffered a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 defeat by Berdych and Stepanek, before the Serb No. 1 set up the decisive rubber with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 triumph over Berdych.\n\nAfterwards Tipsarevic paid tribute to the home supporters, saying: “Thank you, that’s what we needed, you raised us from the dead.”\n\nDjokovic added: “Whoever comes to Belgrade won’t be the favourite.”\n\nFrance cruised into the final with a 5-0 whitewash of Argentina in Lyon.\n\nLeading 4-0 after Gilles Simon’s 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (6/8), 6-3 defeat of Eduardo Schwank earlier in the day, France secured the rout when Arnaud Clement beat Horacio Zeballos 7-5, 6-1 in the final singles rubber on Sunday.\n\nIt was France’s second straight 5-0 win in the compe­tition, follo­wing a quarter-final demolition of defending cham­pions Spain.\n\nThey also defeated Germany 4-1 in the first round.\n\nSunday’s two singles matches were rendered dead rubbers by the straight sets victory of Clement and Michael Llodra against Schwank and Zeballos in Saturday’s doubles match, which gave France an unassailable 3-0 lead.\n\nFrance last won the title in 2001, overcoming Australia 3-2 in Melbourne."
