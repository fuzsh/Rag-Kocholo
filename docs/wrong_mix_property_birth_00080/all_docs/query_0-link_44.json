Even four players in the senior competition came to number 1 in the world (Novak Djokovic, Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic, Nenad Zimonjic), and the team Davis Cup team climbed to the 2010 win stand with a win against France in the final. Two years later, the women’s team arrived to the title of the vice-champion, thus rounding up a period that is rightly considered to be the biggest in the history of tennis in our area."
