        "meta_description": "Snowzilla is back and bigger than ever! The giant snowman erected in the Airport Heights neighborhood of Anchorage (1556 Columbine Street) is complete with a huge carrot nose, a big, beautiful custom-built top hat, and draws long lines of adoring fans giddy with anticipation of getting a picture with one of the unique wonders of Alaska to send to friends across the country and to get those bragging rights to say \"We were there!\" \nDave interviewed fans of the 20-foot-plus high snow creation as they laughed and had the people in the line behind them take the picture for them. From returning fans (around from previous versions of Snowzilla) to brand new fans and even twins! People from Arkansas, California, and Canada braved the single-digit — but sunny — conditions to gaze and gawk at the humongous handiwork of a handful of neighbors. Darrell Estes, one of those neighbors, says they started building and designing Snowzilla back in November and it was a \"group effort.\" \nThere was a bit of a traffic jam, but cars and people seemed to coalesce and be a bit symbiotic in the presence of something uniquely Alaskan. \nSnowzilla last made an appearance 10 years ago, but the Municipality of Anchorage said they didn’t have a permit and it was taken down.  \nQuestions or comments?
