Many people call the giant water bug a âtoe biterâ because it can attack the feet of unsuspecting swimmers. Find out what you need to know about water bug characteristics, habitats, and how to remove them.Â\n\nWhat Are Water Bugs? Â\n\nGiant water bugs are freshwater insects that belong to the family Belostomatidae. Over 60 species of water bugs exist worldwide, and 20 of these species live in North America.Â\n\nWhat do water bugs look like? The giant water bug looks like a hybrid cockroach and praying mantis. It has a brown, flat body with clear, lacy wings that harden at the base. The insectâs most distinctive features are two large front legs that resemble pincers. It uses these powerful limbs to grasp and subdue prey.Â\n\nAll Belostomatidae insects have cylindrical, needle-like beaks for biting and eating. The giant water bugâs bite injects poisonous digestive enzymes into prey. These compounds paralyze the victim and liquify muscles and tissues. The giant water bug sucks this fluid out.Â\n\nThis aquatic insect has breathing tubes near its abdomen that function as snorkels. These tubes reach up to the surface and capture oxygen, which the giant water bug stores in a bubble under its wings. The bubble passes air into the water bugâs body through abdomen holes called spiracles.\n\nThe giant water bugâs size varies by species. The Lethocerus americanus species is the biggest true bug in the United States and can reach 4 inches long. Other species average around 1 to 2Â½ inches long.Â\n\nCan water bugs fly? The giant water bug flies between habitats. You may also spot water bugs flying around porch lights, streetlights, and other lights at night.Â\n\nWhat do water bugs eat? The water bug is an ambush predator that lurks in plants near the surface of ponds and streams. It snatches passing prey with its strong pincers and immediately injects its poison. This mighty hunter can snare and feed on creatures up to 50 times larger than it.\n\nThe giant water bugâs diet includes crayfish, insects, fish, and frogs. It can even eat juvenile snakes and turtles.Â\n\nWhat is the water bug life cycle? Water bugs have elaborate mating rituals that involve underwater dances and sparring. Females in the Lethocerus genus lay their eggs on vegetation above the surface of the water. By contrast, females in the Abedus and Belostoma genera deposit eggs on the backs of male water bugs. The males protect the eggs from predators and carry them until they hatch.\n\nEggs hatch in one to two weeks, and juvenile water bugs mature in one to two months. The water bugâs lifespan averages around one year.\n\nSigns You Have Water Bugs\n\nGiant water bugs generally donât enter homes, but you may notice them in your pond or swimming pool. They often hide under vegetation below the surface of the water.Â\n\nMany people confuse giant water bugs with cockroaches. You can tell the difference between these two insects by looking for antennae. Cockroaches have long antennae, while giant water bugs have none.\n\nHealth Risks of Water Bugs\n\nGiant water bugs can harm humans and pets with their venomous bites.Â\n\nDo water bugs bite? A giant water bug can bite you if you pick it up or accidentally step on it. This bite can cause extreme pain, but experts typically donât consider this injury medically dangerous.\n\nSymptoms of a giant water bug bite include:Â\n\nIntense pain\n\nMild to severe swelling of the affected area\n\nTingling in the bitten limbÂ\n\nIn rare cases, a giant water bug bite could cause an allergic reaction leading to difficulty breathing, hives, and itching. Seek medical treatment if you experience these symptoms after a bite.\n\nHow to Get Rid of Water Bugs\n\nYou can get rid of giant water bugs by replacing blue outdoor lights with yellow lightbulbs, which are less likely to attract these insects.\n\nYou can prevent giant water bugs from entering your home by sealing off cracks and holes in siding and window screens. A pest control professional can also help you eliminate giant water bugs.\n\nWhile many consider the giant water bug a dangerous nuisance, this insect benefits humans by eating mosquito larvae. If you find giant water bugs living in ponds and other natural bodies of water, consider keeping your distance and leaving these fascinating predators alone."
