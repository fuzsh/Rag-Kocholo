        "text": "4. Maine Coon’s are record holders\n\nIn 2010, “Stewie” a male purebred Maine Coon cat was accepted into Guinness Book of Records as the longest domestic cat. He measured 123cm from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. Stewie sadly passed away in January 2013, aged 8.\n\nIn May 2018 a Maine Coon cat called “Barivel” was named the current living record holder, measuring 120cm in length.\n\n5. Maine Coon’s like to talk\n\nMaine Coon’s are vocal cats. They are not shy about getting your attention. If they want to go outside or be fed, they will be sure to tell you with their many adorable sounds. They are so vocal that often owners refer to their frequent noises as talking. Whilst Maine Coon’s are capable of meowing, they often prefer to make other sounds such as such as chirps, trills and yowling.\n\n6. A Maine Coon cat starred in Harry Potter\n\nMrs Norris is a beautiful Maine Coon cat that starred in the Harry Potter series of films. She belonged to Argus Filch, the Hogwarts caretaker. Mrs Norris was loyal to Mr Filch, often out of patrol at night, looking for misbehaving students. If she found any mischief, Mr Filch would be close behind to catch the students in the act.\n\nMany cats played the role including three rescue cats; Alanis, Cornilus and Maximus as well as a retired older cat called Pebbles. Alanis was great at keeping still, so was often the one being carried. Pebbles was very good at walking across the set and stopping at a specific point so was often the one pacing the corridors of Hogwarts. Maximus was trained to jump on Mr Filch’s shoulders and Cornilus was trained to sit still and look around on command.\n\n7. Maine Coon’s have many nicknames\n\nThe unique nature, appearance and shape of a Maine Coon cat has awarded them many nicknames. They are often referred to as “Gentle Giants” of the domestic cat world due to their large size and kind gentle nature.\n\nThey are also often called “Mini Lions” due to their solid, muscular body shape and distinctive thick fur around their necks like a lion’s mane.\n\nThe Maine Coon breed is also nicknamed the “Dog of the cat world” due to their playful nature and intelligence, with a similar temperament to dogs. Maine Coon’s are loyal to their owners and some have even been known to play fetch!"
