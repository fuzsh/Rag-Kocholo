        "text": "With the Christmas season fast approaching, it’s that time of the year again when every business and venue needs to find new ways to stand out from the sea of decorations. The good news for your venue is we have a unique idea that’s sure to draw a crowd — turning a Hypedome geodesic dome into a mesmerising real-life snow globe!\n\nWhether you’re running a shopping centre, hosting a holiday market, or organising a brand-new festive event, you’ll have a striking centrepiece people will be talking about. It will catch the eye, make a splash on social media and provide a great backdrop for any festive marketing material. Let’s take a look and see how you can do it…\n\nDecorate the inside with anything from fake snow to a full Santa’s grotto and then use more artificial snow and a fan unit to create a unique human-size snow globe. It’s such a striking festive addition that you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner. Plus you’ll have complete freedom over how you decorate the inside thanks to the fully transparent design.\n\nThe beauty of using Hypedomes to create real-life snow globes is that you have so many options at your disposal. We love the idea of positioning your new giant Christmas snow globe at the centre of your main display where it will see the highest level of footfall.\n\nTo bring the interior to life you could create a miniature snow globe village complete with snoozing Santa in his chair, a toy train going around the base of the Christmas tree, and a small army of elves doing the real work. And if you want it to be part of a larger holiday-themed display, try putting it at the focal point of your lighting display where its size and striking design will instantly stand out.\n\nTake a look at this Christmas igloo installation in a Danish Town if you want some real sparks of festive inspiration. Once you’ve had a moment to see what you think, why not brainstorm a few new ways you can make sure every visitor to your mall stops and takes a picture?\n\nYou could make the most of the increased foot traffic by adding a few members of staff to act as helpful (yet mischievous) elves. Get them handing out festive candy canes and other sweet treats to anyone who takes a photo of the giant outdoor snow globe and posts it on social media. It’s the closest thing you can get to viral festive marketing that will pay for itself long before the big day finally arrives.\n\nBy turning your mall or shopping centre into the go-to destination for anyone looking to get into the festive spirit, you can create a real buzz that’s sure to boost sales. Perfect for building a reputation as an attraction that simply cannot be missed with a little help from your very own walk-in snow globe.\n\nBuilding a transparent igloo dome that will welcome every visitor to your shopping mall during the festive season is a relatively simple job. The versatile anchoring system can be used both indoors and outdoors without any special measures being taken to prepare the ground. Plus, because Hypedome is durable and designed to be reused, you can disassemble and store it away ready for the year after — your snow globe will soon become an annual attraction.\n\nAnd for those who might be thinking seeing a giant snow globe for sale is great, but that you want something with a wider range of use, we need to tell you a little more about Hypedome…\n\nYour new dome truly does have the potential for year-round use, and can be used for everything from product launches, prize draws and even an attractive pop-up customer information service in the post-holiday season."
