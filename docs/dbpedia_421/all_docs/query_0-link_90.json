        "text": "Guests can visit 3-year-old female Marcy who is now regularly on exhibit inside of Big Cat Falls.\n\nPhiladelphia Zoo is celebrating the arrival of 3-year-old female snow leopard Marcy to its growing family. Marcy came to the Zoo on an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) breeding recommendation with the Zoo’s 8-year-old male, Yuki, to ensure the survival of this species and maintain a genetically diverse population. Snow leopards are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with only an estimated 7,000 remaining in the wild.\n\n“We are so excited to have Marcy at the Zoo as we continue our important work to protect and advocate for this vulnerable species,” says Curator of Carnivores and Ungulates Maggie Morse. “Our big cat team has successfully bred this species in the past and is working on an introduction plan between Marcy and our male, Yuki.”\n\nMarcy was born May 18, 2020, at Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York. At three weeks old, she was diagnosed with swimmer syndrome, a condition affecting her hind legs that would have prevented her from walking if not treated successfully. The team at Rosamond Gifford Zoo created a plan that included physical therapy sessions up to three hours a day in the zoo’s clinic. After nearly 10 weeks of therapy, Marcy was walking, running and climbing. The public selected Marcy’s name after New York State’s tallest mountain.\n\nSpecies Survival Plan\n\nPhiladelphia Zoo had two successful litters of snow leopard cubs in 2011 and 2013. Philadelphia Zoo works with the Species Survival Plan (SSP) breeding program of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The goal of this program is to manage populations of threatened, endangered and other species across AZA institutions to maintain long-term genetic and demographic viability to protect species from extinction.\n\nSnow leopard gestation lasts from 90 to 103 days. Litter size can range from one to five cubs, but usually litters are two to three. At birth, the cubs only weigh about a pound and are totally reliant on mom. Their eyes are closed for the first seven days of life. At about two months old, they begin to eat solid food. Cubs typically stay with mom for about two years until they reach sexual maturity.\n\nPhiladelphia Zoo is home to two snow leopards, male Yuki and female Marcy."
