Then we’ve got the books for you!\n\nWelcome to our beginner’s guide to science fiction. Here we’ll break down everything you need to know to get you started on your fantastic voyage into a genre that can be a bit intimidating for some.\n\nBut fear not!\n\nYou do not need to be a rocket scientist to understand how the USS Enterprise or the Tardis work. So long as you have an imagination and a willingness to explore new worlds, concepts, and ideas, then you too can enjoy the intriguing world of science fiction.\n\nWhat is science fiction?\n\nScience fiction is a subgenre of speculative fiction, which is an umbrella term for all works of fiction that defy the common laws of our reality such as fantasy, superhero stories, etc.. Works of science fiction use scientific fact and theory as the basis for their plots, world-building, etc., and this is what separates them from other genres.\n\nWhile some authors use proven scientific facts and theories, others use more nebulous science in their stories. In some cases, science fiction has been able to predict future advancements and technological marvels.The works of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and even Gene Roddenberry (the creator of Star Trek) discussed then-unfounded scientific principles and functions so believably that they inspired future inventors and creators.\n\nThe origins of science fiction are a hotly debated topic among scholars and literary critics, but most people can agree that science fiction as we currently know it was defined by the publication of Mary Shelley’s Frankensteinin 1818. Shelley’s novel has continuously thrilled, horrified, and mesmerized readers in the 200 years since its publication because of the uniqueness of its powerful narrative.\n\nAlthough Frankenstein is primarily a gothic horror novel, it differs from its predecessors by one crucial aspect: the monster was created through science, not magic. Up until this point, monsters or villains were usually presented as supernatural or magical creatures. Shelley never goes into detail as to how her monster was created, however, she very clearly states that the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, used scientific theory and experiments to bring the dead back to life. Her novel was one of the first to explore the relationship between mankind and scientific advancement. Even the 1931 Universal film adaptation of her work, Frankenstein, paved the way for science fiction films by introducing the idea of “the mad scientist,” which would become a staple of the genre.\n\nIn short, science fiction is fiction that either explores mankind’s relationship with technology/scientific advancements, such as Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot, or uses a science fiction framework to offer up social commentary, such as Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness.\n\nUsually works of science fiction explore alternative universes or histories where technology made an important impact, causing either utopias, post apocalyptic landscapes, or dystopias such as in The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood. Others offer up social commentary by exploring the consequences of humankind encountering new worlds or new civilizations such as Robert Wise’s 1951 film, The Day the Earth Stood Still.\n\nWhat’s the difference between science fiction and fantasy?\n\nScience fiction relies on scientific fact and theory to provide answers whereas fantasy does not. In a fantasy story such as Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio, a puppet boy is brought to life through the use of magic, without an explanation of what magic really is or how it works. In a science fiction story, such as Osamu Tezuka’s Astro Boy, a robot is brought to life and given human emotions by his scientist creator. Science fiction involves science. Fantasy involves magic. That is the difference.\n\nWhat else should I know?\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two categories of science fiction that a reader should be aware of: hard science fiction (hard SF) and soft science fiction (soft SF).\n\nNovels in the hard SF category will heavily focus on the relationship of the narrative to the technology or science of its setting. The author will strive to make the science as accurate as possible using theories of chemistry, physic, etc., and this knowledge will be important to the story. For instance, a novel that delivers an exhaustive, in-depth explanation of how its spaceship operates, or the geological compositon of its host planet will most likely fall under the hard SF category. In short, hard SF will heavily promote the science part of its fiction.\n\nSoft SF is the opposite. A soft SF novel may feature a spaceship, but it will not necessarily tell you what kind of fuel it uses or even how it runs because that sort of knowledge has little to no bearing on the narrative. Soft SF novels also tend to focus on more of the social sciences (sociology, psychology, etc) rather than the natural sciences (chemistry, physics, etc.). Both categories have developed their own sub-categories, and sub-sub-categories, but these are the two most important distinctions that beginners should be aware of.\n\nWhere should I start?\n\nHere we’ve gathered recommended titles based off of some famous science fiction subgenres. From Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea to Ridley Scott's Alien, the decades and centuries following the publication of Shelley’s Frankenstein would be full of other works of science fiction that cross genre divides in much the same way that Shelley did. This means there is something out there for everyone, so be prepared to boldly go where you haven’t gone before and dive into some science fiction today!\n\nAction/Adventure\n\nA Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\nFirst serialized in the pulp magazine All-Story Magazine between February and July of 1912, A Princess of Mars is the first novel in Edgar Rice Burroughs’s classic Barsoom series, set on the planet Mars. At the center of the series is the protagonist John Carter, a Confederate Captain of the American Civil War, who finds himself mysteriously transported to the planet Mars. Upon arrival John Carter discovers that the lower gravity of the planet has endowed him a super human strength and agility. This prowess helps him to win the allegiance of the Tharks, a nomadic war-like tribe of green six-limbed aliens.\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs’s Mars is a desert world, a dying planet which is caught in the conflict between the Green Martians, or the Tharks, and the Red Martians, a group of humanoids who inhabit a loose network of city-states and control the planet’s canals and agriculture. John Carter soon finds himself embroiled in the political conflict between the two Red Martian city states of Zodanga and Helium when he rescues and falls in love with the beautiful Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium. A Princess of Mars is both a romantic adventure and a science fiction tale of fantasy which has been an inspiration to countless science fiction writers ever since its first publication.\n\nAnime\n\nThe Martian: A Novel by Andy Weir\n\nSix days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive--and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.\n\nChances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?\n\nDimension Travel\n\nFrankenstein Dreams: A Connoisseur's Collection of Victorian Science Fiction edited by Michael Sims\n\nLong before 1984, Star Wars, or The Hunger Games, Victorian authors imagined a future where new science and technologies reshaped the world and universe they knew. The great themes of modern science fiction showed up surprisingly early: space and time travel, dystopian societies, even dangerously independent machines, all inspiring the speculative fiction of the Victorian era.\n\nIn Frankenstein Dreams, Michael Sims has gathered many of the very finest stories, some by classic writers such as Jules Verne, Mary Shelley, and H.G. Wells, but many that will surprise general readers. Dark visions of the human psyche emerge in Thomas Wentworth Higginson's \"The Monarch of Dreams,\" while Mary E. Wilkins Freeman provides a glimpse of “the fifth dimension” in her provocative tale \"The Hall Bedroom.'\n\nWith contributions by Edgar Allan Poe, Alice Fuller, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, Arthur Conan Doyle, and many others, each introduced by Michael Sims, whose elegant introduction provides valuable literary and historical context, Frankenstein Dreams is a treasure trove of stories known and rediscovered.\n\nI, Robot by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe three laws of Robotics: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nWith these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asmiov's trademark.\n\nThe Time Machine by H. G. Wells\n\nFirst published in 1895, the novel follows the adventures of a hypothetical Time Traveller who journeys into the future to find that humanity has evolved into two races: the peaceful Eloi—vegetarians who tire easily—and the carnivorous, predatory Morlocks.\n\nAfter narrowly escaping from the Morlocks, the Time Traveller undertakes another journey even further into the future where he finds the earth growing bitterly cold as the heat and energy of the sun wane. Horrified, he returns to the present, but soon departs again on his final journey.\n\nWhile the novel is underpinned with both Darwinian and Marxist theory and offers fascinating food for thought about the world of the future, it also succeeds as an exciting blend of adventure and pseudo-scientific romance. Sure to delight lovers of the fantastic and bizarre, The Time Machine is a book that belongs on the shelf of every science-fiction fan.\n\n--\n\nHave trouble reading standard print?
