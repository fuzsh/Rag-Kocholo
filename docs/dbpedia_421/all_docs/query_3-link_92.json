        "text": "Some of my most memorable days on a bass lake or stream have come while working a surface plug. While some of my largest largemouth bass have also been teased to the surface by my many hours of working surface plugs.\n\nMany years ago I was fortunate to learn some unique topwater fishing techniques from a seasoned topwater angler, Jeter Brock in Richmond, Virginia. Jeter had one bass lure, a black Musky Jitterbug. Jeter would cast a Jitterbug even on the hottest days and right during the middle of the day when most bass fishermen fished deep with a diving plug, jig, or weighted plastic worm.\n\nJeter concentrated his topwater fishing tactics on the Chickahominy River, which showcased lily pads, weed beds and cypress trees. His largest bass weighed just over 12 pounds.\n\nWhen moving to Florida during the early 1970s, I brought along my tackle box full of surface plugs. When targeting giant Florida largemouth bass, I always had one or more surface plugs tied on among my many bass rods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertainly, a prime time to cast a surface plug is during the early morning and late evening hours when there is less light and big bass are feeding in the shallows. Overcast periods of the day are also prime times for working surface plugs. Also include times of the day when there are a lot of shad or shiners schooling on the surface, or just under the surface.\n\nLogged into my fishing journals, I am constantly reminded of a past bass fishing trip on Dunn’s Creek, which joins the St. Johns River and Crescent Lake. I was fishing with PGA pro Roger Parker; we both were casting gold colored Bagley Bang-O-Lures close to cypress knees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a washtub boil, a very large bass sucked my plug into its mouth and soon became tangled in a submerged cypress knee. Roger instantly dove deep into the water and retrieved my 12-pound bass.\n\nCertainly, a tried-and-true bass plug is the floating #11 Rapala, in either the gold or silver color pattern. Like my Virginia bass fishing friend Jeter Brock casting a Jitterbug all day long, I know many Florida river bass fishermen who will cast a floating Rapala all day long! They know that sooner or later a big bass will attack their floating minnow imitation.\n\nThe floating plastic frog with a concave head is also a deadly surface plug with its weedless hooks. Retrieving a plastic frog on top of a thick grass bed or lily pads makes for exciting surface strikes that will take your breath away.\n\nChugger type plugs like Storm’s Chug Bug are a great choice when working open pockets of grass and lily pads, or simply casting close to cypress knees, dock pilings, bridge foundations, or where baitfish are schooling on or near the surface.\n\nCigar shaped surface plugs like the Devil’s Horse work well in similar conditions as chuggers. Keeping the rod tip just above the surface and applying a sharp, short, deliberate retrieve gives the plug a loud, splashing, injured minnow action.\n\nOne of my most memorable topwater fishing trips came while fishing with Roland and Judy Martin. Judy explained to Roland, “When a big bass takes your surface plug, give it a few seconds before setting the hook!”\n\nA few seconds later a big bass blew up on Judy’s surface plug. Judy jerked the twin prop plug right out of the bass’s mouth which came flying from the water hitting Roland on the side of the head.\n\nCigar-shaped plugs like the Zara Spook are a great option when bass are holding in open water. While keeping the rod tip low and giving the plug a side-to-side, lazy swimming action, “Spooks” will call up big bass from near and far.\n\nDark colored surface plugs work well when bass fishing in dark water, or during low light conditions. Brightly colored surface plugs are a better choice when the water is clear.\n\nSpinning tackle with 10-pound braided fishing line and a 18-inch length of 10- to 15-pound fluorocarbon shock leader works best while casting light surface plugs like the Rapala. Casting tackle with reels filled with 20-pound monofilament fishing line works best when casting heavier surface plugs.\n\nRemember: Slowly lower the rod tip, then set the hook.\n\nThis article was featured in the July issue of Florida Sportsman magazine.
