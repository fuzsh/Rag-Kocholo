        "text": "Massive, ancient giant sequoias live in three groves in Yosemite National Park. The most easily accessible of these (spring through fall) is the Mariposa Grove near the park's South Entrance, off of the Wawona Road (Highway 41). Two smaller—and less visited—groves are the Tuolumne and Merced Groves near Crane Flat.\n\nMariposa Grove\n\nLocated near the South Entrance of Yosemite, the Mariposa Grove is the largest grove in the park and is home to over 500 mature giant sequoias. During much of the year a free shuttle is required for use between the Mariposa Grove Welcome Plaza and the Mariposa Grove. There is a variety of trails from easy to strenuous within the grove, as well as some accessible trails. Restrooms are located at the Mariposa Grove Welcome Plaza and areas within the grove. Drinking water is available only at the welcome plaza (year-round) and arrival area (summer only) so plan accordingly. The drive takes approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes from Yosemite Valley.\n\nTuolumne Grove\n\nLocated on the Tioga Road just east of Crane Flat, the Tuolumne Grove has about two dozen mature giant sequoias. Sequoias are only visible after a one-mile hike with 500 feet of elevation loss. (The one-mile hike back to the parking lot gains 500 feet and is strenuous.) Water is not available; bring drinking water for everyone in your group who will be hiking this trail. The drive takes about 45 minutes from Yosemite Valley. Parking is limited.\n\nMerced Grove\n\nLocated on the Big Oak Flat Road east of Big Oak Flat Entrance and approximately 6 miles west of Crane Flat, the Merced Grove has about two dozen mature giant sequoias. Sequoias are only visible after a 1.5-mile hike with 500 feet of elevation loss. (The 1.5-mile hike back to the parking lot gains 500 feet and is strenuous.) Water is not available; bring drinking water for everyone in your group who will be hiking this trail. The drive takes about 45 minutes from Yosemite Valley. Parking is extremely limited.\n\nVideos"
