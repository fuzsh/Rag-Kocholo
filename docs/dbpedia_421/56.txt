The Sonoma Stompers, presented by Virginia Dare Winery, will welcome one of the most popular players in San Francisco Giants history on Wednesday, June 15 when six-time Gold Glove winner J.T. Snow will visit the Stompers home of People’s Home Equity Ballpark at Arnold Field.

Snow’s day will begin during the first session of the Stompers Baseball Clinic that afternoon, where he will visit with the campers and impart some of his baseball wisdom. Before Sonoma’s game with the San Rafael Pacifics that night at 6 p.m., Snow will meet with fans and sign autographs before throwing out the first pitch.

The slick-fielding southpaw becomes the second former Giant to visit with the Stompers, following a terrific appearance in 2014 by Snow’s former manager Dusty Baker, who is now having great success managing the Washington Nationals.

Snow spent 16 seasons at the Major League Level, retiring with the Giants in 2008. 10 of those seasons were spent in San Francisco from 1997-2006, where he helped the Giants to four playoff appearances, including the 2002 World Series.

A tremendous defender, Snow won six consecutive Gold Gloves from 1995 to 2000. He was originally drafted by the New York Yankees in the fifth round of the 1989 amateur draft before being traded to the California Angels ahead of the 1993 season.

Snow ended up with 189 home runs in his career, batting .268/.357/.427. He drove in 877 runs and scored 798 times.

The first Stompers Baseball Clinic session begins on Tuesday, June 14 and will take place at Arnold Field in downtown Sonoma. Registration is $165 per player for the three-day camp, which also comes with two complementary tickets for a future Stompers game. Sign-ups are online at the brand new stompersbaseball.com under the “Community” tab.
