Over the years the iconic Jolly Green Giant has made a number of image transformations and today, he is back and more lifelike than ever in a new set of ads created by Deutsch's New York office.

In two spots, "What Did He Learn" and "Snow Angel," the Giant returns from his journey away from the TV screen filled with all sorts of new wisdom after stomping across the world. He's added a plethora of new skills to his Giant resume, including how to make a killer snow angel and how to help families eat healthier with a new line of riced vegetables, including riced cauliflower, and a line of tater tots made from veggies like broccoli and cauliflower.
