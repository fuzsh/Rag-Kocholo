        "text": "Damien's closest companion who he met in the First Dungeon.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIn her beast form, she is a majestic pitch black wolf with fallen angel-like wings and a number of tails that correspond to her power level. After her transformation upon ascending to fourth class, her coat became longer and silkier, her eyes became amethyst, she gained a crescent-moon shaped marking on her forehead, and she grew two more tails, brining the total to 4. In her human form, Zara is a beautiful young woman with long black hair, amethyst eyes similar to Damien's and the crescent moon shaped marking on her forehead.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAbsolutely loyal to Damien, who she sees as something between her older brother and father figure.\n\nStory[]\n\nZara is the half-Nox daughter of Divine Emperor and a so far unnamed Infernal Wolf, conceived with the intention of having her be a weapon against the Nox, to give a denizen of the universe a chance to conquer the power that has oppressed them. She was born the Yin half of the Yin-Yang Heaven Seed along with her paternal half-sister Alea.\n\nHer Mother escaped into the First Dungeon and was later likely injured, dying during childbirth. Zara was then taken in and raised by a wolf pack that was subdued by her mother."
