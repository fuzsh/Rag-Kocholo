Miku's gramophone-inspired dress features translucent parts and delicate pearl and gold paintwork. In addition to her face with closed eyes, an interchangeable smiling face part is included.\n\nFrom her flowing hair to the tips of her fingers and toes, the figure is packed with charm. The base of the figure also features a small drawer for storage, allowing you to store the music box included with the figure inside. Be sure to preorder her for your collection!"
