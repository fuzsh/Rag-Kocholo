        "text": "Its true there are alot out there, and increasing all the time.\n\nI remember there suddenly being a big boom in the number of factions being created around abouts after CQ took over map, Ah people and their dreams of gloryb:cute\n\nAlso many new people who join, thier first thing on thier mind is to create a faction.\n\nSo yeah, theres alot of under poppulated/innsufficient activity, failling factions out there.\n\nBUT-There are some out there, and some will work.\n\nIve firsthand experience of this, i went in and out of several factions that had very few active people, untill i eventually settled in a \"fairly\" known faction, but in a way was struggleing at the time, an i was given marshal status fairly quickly.\n\nEventually due to our reasons, the current director and the marshals created a new faction from scratch with exception to a few people who came with us.\n\nI was a marshal there, an hey, we had a good run, we had fun, we recruited and many newbies and helped them grow stronger mostly from 3x-7x, we had an ok-ish active amount of members.\n\nIt worked well during our time running it, but then eventually we disbanded like many others to move onto bigger more well known factions.\n\nAs with faction like said for 3x-6x sorta thing, people will start to need help for things like TT and all, unless run well, if they cant get with thier current faction, they will move on.\n\nOverall, im sure there will be factions out there, it can just take a bit of looking."
