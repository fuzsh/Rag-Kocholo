        "text": "Chapter 1221 Death [3]\n\nThis chapter is updated by Novels.pl\n\nJust like every other true show of power, there was no magisterial effect accompanying the command.\n\nWith Damien's single word, the foreign material executed his command.\n\nAt that moment, if one could view Al'Katra's full form from the Abyss, they'd witness a horrifyingly beautiful sight.\n\nQuintillions of existences.\n\nThey formed a mosaic along the surface that even the dark clouds in the atmosphere couldn't hide.\n\nYet, at this moment, that mosaic merged into a sea of blackness.\n\nEvery Lesser Nox on the surface of the planet, a majority of the Nox's power, dropped to the ground without resistance.\n\nTheir bodies turned into ink that flowed and filled the desolate earth of Al'Katra with oceans of blood, and despite the merging ability that made the denizens of the universe infinitely wary, these Nox did not reform after dying.\n\nJust like that.\n\nIt happened fast, within a few seconds, and far before anyone could understand what was actually happening.\n\nIt was hard to picture how grand such a major event was when the time it took to occur was so short and the visual spectacle was practically nonexistent, however, it couldn't be helped.\n\nDamien realized instantly that he didn't have time to marvel at it.\n\n'I need to leave. Now. I can process the weight of my actions later.'\n\nThe Saint Emperor just left so he was definitely close enough to return to the Demon Abyss within the hour, while the rest of the Nox Emperors wouldn't be too far behind.\n\n'I have to get out of here before they return, or I'll really find myself facing the entire Nox Race alone.'\n\nHe looked at the foreign material with a strained expression for a moment, but understood what he had to do.\n\n'Disassemble.'\n\nHe gave the command, and without a consciousness of its own, the foreign material could only follow.\n\nFrom the inside out, it took itself apart and dissipated into the atmosphere, becoming one with the area that was disappearing now that it was gone.\n\nDamien rapidly exited the alternate reality using the same method he used to enter, and with his current understanding of the Nox, escaping the Demon Abyss wasn't nearly as stretched out of an ordeal as descending it.\n\nHe shot up like a fish swimming against the current. He couldn't see it, but starting at the very top, the Demon Abyss was disappearing.\n\nIt looked like a swimming pool being drained.\n\nA sinkhole formed in its center due to the extreme speed at which the currents of the abyss swirled and vanished, creating a long corridor that touched the very bottom of the space within the minute.\n\nDamien noticed it once it passed him. He didn't hesitate to change his path and fight the chaotic vortex to reach its eye, where he could directly fly through the environment.\n\nAl'Katra's laws were flooding the space now that the disruption was gone, and he could use these to propel himself far faster than he could through the Demon Abyss itself.\n\nAnd his mind was moving just as fast.\n\nHe needed to find an escape route.\n\n'It's open air outside, so theoretically, I should be able to make it out easily. I don't have to hide my identity anymore, so I can use the full power of my laws to get out of here.'\n\nIt was fine.\n\nHe trusted himself to make it out before anything bad happened.\n\nHe didn't realize how far he'd descended until he had to return to the surface.\n\nUsing his true power, he was teleporting millions of kilometers every second, but he'd already teleported hundreds of times and couldn't see the open air yet.\n\nThe Demon Abyss itself was a separate entity from Al'Katra.\n\nIts depths didn't reflect the size of Al'Katra, and despite the world itself being far larger than any other world in existence, the Demon Abyss was deeper than it could hold.\n\n'I was billions of kilometers deep at the very least. I'm afraid of how much time it took to descend that, but I didn't feel it at all. Even using extraordinary means to increase my fall speed, it'd take years for the abyss to take me the abyss.'\n\nDamien lost track of the significance of time when he came to the Abyss.\n\nIt had already been over a decade since he left the universe, but it felt shorter than the amount of time he spent in No Return Pass.\n\nIt was just too fast.\n\nToo much happened in too little time, and Damien learned so much that his brain was full of information that clouded his perception.\n\nHe hadn't even digested it all yet.\n\n'The information I learned from the foreign material, at least what I could understand immediately, expanded on things I already know. However, the stuff that's left will help me clear the doubts I formed while I was pondering earlier.'\n\nThe things he assumed about the Void's effects on the Nox naturally weren't presented in the foreign material because it had no relation to that, but the information it had would help him clear away incorrect assumptions to eventually triangulate the truth.\n\n'The most important thing now is to get back to Grand Heavens Boundary and spread what I know, as well as the current state of the Nox. We have more than just a chance now. We have the absolute ability to win!'\n\nThe threat of an infinite Nox wave no longer existed. Not only were their forces now finite since they lacked the ability to reproduce rapidly, they also lost a majority of their foot soldiers, so the war situation would balance out instantly.\n\nEverything was set up.\n\nThat single move, something that only needed a single thought from him to come to fruition, completely reversed the dire situation.\n\nEverything was in his palms now.\n\nHe grinned to himself.\n\nThe entrance to the Demon Abyss was now visible. He'd be there in a few seconds.\n\nHe pushed and pushed and pushed.\n\nHis thoughts were focused on the future.\n\n'Escape is easy. As soon as I get out of the Demon Abyss' distortion, I can enter the Sanctuary. With the connection the isolated universe had to my wives, I can go directly to them once I'm there.'\n\nHe didn't need to make a journey through the Abyss anymore.\n\nHe didn't need to worry about confronting the Nox Emperors.\n\nHe had an out.\n\nAn easy out that he created with his own hands.\n\nHis ego felt overly inflated. He deserved it, after all.\n\nHe'd just accomplished a miracle.\n\nHe knew he couldn't let it stay that way.\n\nHe hadn't changed from the man he once was just because he was able to accomplish something major.\n\nBecause, at the end of the day, his deed was done through external forces, not personal power.\n\nBut for now, it was okay.\n\nHe deserved a pat on the back.\n\nBut not yet.\n\nHe pushed and pushed and pushed.\n\nThe opening above him became bigger and bigger in his eyes, and with just a few more teleportations, he made it past the barrier.\n\n'Now!'\n\nHe didn't know what the Nox were up to and he didn't care to know.\n\nHis mana immediately went into his connection with the Sanctuary to pull him out of Al-\n\nSHIK!\n\nDamien's eyes widened.\n\nHe looked down.\n\nThere was an arm jutting out of his chest.\n\n\"What…\"\n\nHe felt a breath on his ear.\n\n\"Thank you, but this is the end.\"\n\nHe knew that voice.\n\nIt was the Saint Emperor.\n\nHe wasn't supposed to be here.\n\nDamien made sure the Saint Emperor left Al'Katra before he entered the Demon Abyss.\n\nAnd…\n\nHe was a Demigod.\n\nThis…was not supposed to happen.\n\n\"Are you curious?\"\n\nThe Saint Emperor asked casually, but his words flowed so fast they only took up a fraction of a spark of a millisecond to end.\n\n\"Look around you.\"\n\nDamien obeyed.\n\nHe wasn't in his right mind.\n\nThe second the Saint Emperor pierced his body, his connection with the Sanctuary was cut off.\n\nHe couldn't even teleport or access his mana.\n\nAs his eyes focused on the atmosphere, he realized.\n\nHe was surrounded by Demigods.\n\nThere were over 100 Nox Lords in the area around him, and there were 100 more maintaining a barrier of Divine Energy that disallowed the usage of any lesser mana.\n\n\"I prepared this for you.\"\n\nDivine Energy flowed into Damien's body.\n\nThis was the force.\n\nIt was because of this mana that everything he tried didn't work.\n\nEven the Void didn't answer his call.\n\n\"You have fulfilled your role,\" the Saint Emperor continued.\n\n\"You have no more use in the plot, so…\"\n\n\"I will be taking the Dark God's Seed. Thank you for growing it so well for me.\"\n\n\"Keuk…!\"\n\nDamien sprayed blood.\n\nDivine Energy filled his systems and turned him into a cripple instantly.\n\nThe pocket dimensions protecting his vital organs were shattered, and his systems fell victim to the Divine Energy's erosion.\n\nHis vision was blurring.\n\nHe never expected this.\n\nHe had no way of predicting it.\n\nThe restriction on Demigods was absolute. Even at this moment as time slowed almost to a stop, the Demigods in the surroundings, including the Saint Emperor, were slowly fading.\n\nTheir bodies were turning into blue light particles as they were transported to the Ancient Battlefield.\n\nBut it hadn't happened yet.\n\nDamien didn't understand.\n\nThe Nox would suffer more than anyone else if they lost their Demigods.\n\nTheir command structure was heavily reliant on Lords, and their armies would fall into chaos the second they were gone.\n\nThat was why the Nox made sure to stop the universe's Demigods from forcing them into the Ancient Battlefield.\n\nSo…\n\n\"…why…?\"\n\nDamien squeezed out a single word.\n\n\"Why?\" The Saint Emperor echoed with a smile.\n\n\"Because I wanted to see your expression. Why else?\"\n\nAn extremely Saint Emperor-like answer.\n\nHe did it because he wanted to.\n\nHe didn't care about the Nox.\n\nIt was an oversight on Damien's part.\n\nThis man was never someone who acted predictably. Damien never should've assumed he could understand how the Saint Emperor would move.\n\nBut that couldn't be it.\n\nHe couldn't accept it.\n\n\"Tell…me…\"\n\nHe couldn't see it.\n\nBut the Saint Emperor grinned widely.\n\n\"You are that curious?\" He said mockingly.\n\n\"Unfortunately, you will not get an answer.\"\n\nVOOM!\n\nThe Divine Energy rampaging through Damien's body increased to a new level.\n\nEverything was destroyed.\n\nHe couldn't fight Divine Energy.\n\nIt was several leagues above his existence.\n\nHe could barely perceive it. If it wasn't crushing him piece by piece, he wouldn't have perceived it at all.\n\nWithout the Void, he couldn't do anything about it.\n\nBut the Void was silent.\n\nHis brain was starting to melt.\n\n\"After all, you are already dead.\"\n\nDead?\n\nHim?\n\nDamien Void?\n\nDead?\n\nHe couldn't accept it.\n\nHe wasn't someone who could die.\n\nNot here.\n\nNot now.\n\nHe spent too much time and effort to get where he was. He sacrificed too much to become the man he was.\n\nThis wasn't his time.\n\nHe had too much he still wanted to do to die here.\n\n\"I…refuse…\"\n\nHis words were weak. They couldn't accurately represent the flame in his heart.\n\nNo matter what he wanted, no matter what his mind and heart said, he couldn't overcome Divine Energy.\n\nAnd the Void…\n\nThe Void was still silent.\n\nIt was his mistake.\n\nIt was all his fault.\n\nHe got too confident.\n\nHe let his ego tell him everything was okay.\n\nBut…\n\nWas there a way out?\n\nThere wasn't.\n\nHe didn't have the power to escape before the Saint Emperor got to him.\n\nEven with his inflated ego, he was acting with absolute speed.\n\nBut he dropped his wariness because of it.\n\nThat was his fault.\n\nHe didn't know if he could've escaped, but it was too late for him to think about it.\n\nBecause his brain was no more than a puddle of fluids leaking into his systems.\n\nHe was too late.\n\nHe had no chance.\n\nRose, Ruyue, Elena…\n\nHis mother, Xue'er, his father…\n\nIris…\n\nTian Yang, Elvira, Malcolm, Bai Yuxuan, Feng Yuxiang, Bianca Snow, Su Ren, Long Chen, Aishia, Director Alucard, Feng Qing'er, Lunaria Snow, Qing Tan, Hugo Fang, Atticus Flamesworth, Yong An, Luciel, Lucifer, Commander Huo, Lynn Carter, Xue Fang, Bai Xieren, Shangguan Yu, Tang Lingzi, Drunken Old Immortal, Jiao Mei, Sierra Lock, Leona, Pricilla Adelaire, Ria, Maximus, Elitra…\n\nThey all flashed through his mind.\n\nOne by one.\n\nThe connections he built through his life, the people he loved, and those who loved him.\n\nThe First Dungeon, Apeiron, the Cloud Plane, 3000 Beast Mountain Range, Primordial Undying Realm, Earth, the Unnamed World, Atlas World, Azure Rain Star, Death Emperor Star, Hidden Death Valley, Calypto, Luxurion, Holy Light Star, Beast Emperor Star, Eien, the Wild Continent, the Severed World, No Return Pass, the Abyss…\n\nThe places he'd been, the sights he'd seen, flowed like a stream after that.\n\nHis memories flashed one after another, showing him the Legend he'd built thus far, showing him the events that created him, showing him the struggles he went through, showing him what he wished to protect…\n\nAs the Demigods around him turned completely into blue particles and disappeared from the universe, a single sentence entered his ears.\n\n\"Rest well. I will take good care of your universe. That much, I can promise.\"\n\nAnd then…\n\nOne second finally elapsed.\n\nEveryone in the Demon Abyss disappeared from the lower universe.\n\nIn this place, far separated from everything he knew and loved, a place he came to protect those things…\n\nA life withered away.\n\nDamien Void had died."
