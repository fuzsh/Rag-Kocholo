        "text": "American-French visual artist\n\nAntoine Wagner ( VAHG-nər, French: [ɑ̃twan vaɡnɛʁ]; born Antoine Amadeus Wagner-Pasquier; 1982) is an American-French visual artist.[1] He works between Woodstock, NY and Paris, France.[2] Through a visual language drawn from nature his work refers to mythological narratives and the sublime.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nWagner was born in Evanston, Illinois. He is the son of German opera manager Eva Wagner-Pasquier and is the great-great-grandson of the composer Richard Wagner. He graduated from Northwestern University, Illinois, and Sciences Po, Paris, with a double bachelor's degree in Theatre and Political Science in 2005.[3]\n\nHe continued his education in film at the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 2007.[3]\n\nArtwork\n\n[edit]\n\nWagner's medium include video, sound, sculpture, performance and photography, which he exhibits through installations, site-specific projects, film, monumental photography and opera. Through the visual language of nature, his work references music, mythology and the romantic.[4]\n\nWagner's multifaceted practice has created an entire visual language to engage the audience in communicating with nature. Abstract unseen anthropomorphic shapes found in nature and minerals are the main actors of this world of mythologies and cyclical redundancies. Through different medium and projects, the artist examines the themes of identity, geography and spirituality and offers to the viewer an escape from traditional geographic and artistic boundaries.[5]\n\nThrough his exhibitions including Exil (Museum am Rothenbaum, 2013), Kundry (La Filature de Mulhouse 2015), Wagner applied his experience in the moving image to photography, exploring the possibilities of narrative in a silent and motionless environment through large-scale abstract photography.\n\nIn 2018, Wagner directed Act II of the Opera Die Walkure at Frank Gehry's New World Center in Miami.\n\nWagner's site-specific multimedia installation Sentimental Analysis (April 2019) is a response to the legend of Ara the Beautiful at The National Gallery of Armenia.\n\nEarly work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2006, Wagner assisted director Michael Haneke on Funny Games.\n\nAfter his first site specific installation Lisz[:T:]raumin in Raiding, Austria in 2007 he directed a series of videos and documentaries exploring visual inspiration in music. His film From a Mess to the Masses (2011) reveals the genesis of visual creation of the band Phoenix.[6]\n\nWagner: A genius in Exile (2013) is a documentary revealing the landscapes that influenced Richard Wagner during his Swiss exile.[7]\n\nIn 2013, VfmK Verlag für moderne Kunst published Wagner in der Schweiz, a photographic essay exploring Richard Wagner's inspiration during his forced journey from Germany to Switzerland after the 1848 revolution. It was awarded the 2013 Prix de l'Académie Lyrique Pierre Bergé in Paris.[8]\n\nExhibitions\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: The Open, Group Show, Deitch Projects, New York City.[9]\n\n2011: Landscapes Escaped: Henn Gallerie, Munich, Germany.[10]\n\n2013–2016: Exil, The Opera Bastille, Paris, 2013; The Bayreuth Festspielhaus, Germany, 2013; Palazzo Vendramin, Venice, Italy, 2013; Museum für Völkerkunde Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany, 2015;[11] Gertrude Salon, New York, 2016;[12] Stedelijk Museum Breda, Breda, Netherlands, 2016;[13]\n\n2015: Cadences: La Filature, Mulhouse, France.[14]\n\n2015: Wagner in der Schweiz (screening), Goethe-Institut, California, United States.[citation needed]\n\n2016: Un Musee Imaginaire, Group Show, Collection Lambert (Collection Lambert), Avignon, France.[15]\n\n2016: Common Denominator, Theater St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.[16]\n\n2016: Bredaphoto, Stedelijk Museum Breda, Breda, Netherlands.[17]\n\n2016: Interference, Galerie RM, Paris.[18]\n\n2017: Kundry, La Filature de Mulhouse, France.\n\n2017: Supersonic, Deck, Singapore.[19]\n\n2017: Echo, Julien David, Jinguamae, Tokyo.[20]\n\n2017: Silence, Atelier Hermes Pantin, France.[3]\n\n2017: Wagner in der Schweiz, Society of the Four Arts, Palm Beach, Florida.[citation needed]\n\n2017: Art Paris Art Fair, Grand Palais, Paris.[21]\n\n2017: Distortion, Youngfu, Shanghai, China[citation needed]\n\n2017: Antoine Wagner, Phillips, Paris[citation needed]\n\n2017: Julierpass, Tait memorial Fundwith Stuart Skelton, Saint Paul's Church, London[citation needed]\n\n2018: Liquid La patinoire, Royal Gallerie Valerie Bach, Bruxelles[citation needed]\n\n2018: Looking at sound: Symposium at the Goethe Institut, Tokyo[citation needed]\n\n2018: Studies Between Silence: Nancy Nasher, Soluna Music and Arts Festival, Dallas, Texas[citation needed]\n\n2018: ACT II - Die Walkure, New World Center, Miami[citation needed]\n\n2018: Orient Blue, In Cadaques Festival, Cadaques, Spain[citation needed]\n\n2018: Artist talk, Spring Place, New York[citation needed]\n\n2018 Morceau Choisi, (group show), Bubenberg Art Paris[citation needed]\n\n2019: Conscience of Angel's Landing, Art Paris, Grand Palais Paris,[citation needed]\n\n2019: Sentimental Analysis, site specific multimedia exhibition at the National Gallery of Armenia[citation needed]\n\nCollections\n\n[edit]\n\nWagner's work is held in the following permanent collections:\n\nYvon Lambert Gallery, Paris[22]\n\nMuseum of Ethnology, Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany[11]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nWagner assisted director Michael Haneke on his American remake of Funny Games in 2007.\n\nIn 2011, Wagner directed the film From a Mess to the Masses featuring the band Phoenix.[23][24] The film was commissioned by Arte and first broadcast in 2011.\n\nWagner has directed videos featuring Julien David,[25] Phoenix,[23] Vanessa Paradis,[26] Johnny Hallyday, Kate Moss,[27][28] Maria Korchetkova,[25] and Spank Rock.[29]\n\nWagner has also worked as a cinematographer.\n\nResidencies\n\n[edit]\n\nWagner has completed residencies at Robert Wilson's Byrd Hoffman Watermill Center, NY (2005),[6] and at The Villa Medici, Rome (2014).\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nWagner: A Genius in Exile (2013)\n\nAntoine Wagner: Wagner in der Schweiz (2014).
