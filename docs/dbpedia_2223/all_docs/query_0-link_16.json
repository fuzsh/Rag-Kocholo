You can also directly contact the detention facility where the prisoner is being housed. You may also call the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 if the prisoner is in suicidal crisis or emotional distress.\n\nIf you wish to communicate non-emergency prisoner medical and mental health matters, please contact the detention facility where the prisoner is being housed directly or the local USMS Federal District office. A list of the Federal District USMS offices can be found at: https://www.usmarshals.gov/local-districts.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service manages a wide array of assets, including real estate, commercial businesses, cash, financial instruments, vehicles, jewelry, art, antiques, collectibles, vessels and aircraft through dismantling illegal enterprises and depriving criminals of their ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service plays a critical role in identifying and evaluating assets that represent the proceeds of crime as well as efficiently managing and selling assets seized and forfeited by the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Marshals manage the distribution of proceeds and payments to victims of crime and other innocent third parties, all of which helps to mitigate the financial damage inflicted by criminal activity."
