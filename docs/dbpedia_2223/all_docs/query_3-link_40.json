        "text": "A Musical Feast Cooked Up by Sir Donald Runnicles\n\n9 August 2024\n\nSir Donald Runnicles is renowned for the way he designs his concerts, something he describes as like balancing a beautiful meal. Here he explores the musical feasts he has prepared for Sydney in September – one French, and one German…\n\nFarewell Diana Doherty\n\n24 July 2024\n\nAfter 27 years, Diana Doherty is stepping down as Principal Oboe of the Sydney Symphony, bringing to an end an incredible period in the Orchestra’s history. But as Diana explains, she’s not retiring – rather this is just another evolution in a career full of them.\n\nAugustin Hadelich Returns\n\n16 July 2024\n\nViolinist Augustin Hadelich took Sydney by storm when he debuted with the Orchestra in 2022, performing Brahms’ Violin Concerto. This August he is back by popular demand to perform another of the great concertos, as well as a rare and thrilling chamber orchestra concert that will showcase his dazzling virtuosity in a different light.\n\nTwo Cultures, One World: Deborah Cheetham Fraillon on Eumeralla\n\n4 July 2024\n\nDeborah Cheetham Fraillon AO is many things: Yorta Yorta/Yuin woman, trained soprano and award-winning composer. As she explains, she had to call on all those parts of her identity when writing Eumeralla: A War Requiem for Peace – an ambitious, large-scale choral work that receives its Sydney premiere in September.\n\nOlivier Latry: The King of the King of Instruments\n\n21 June 2024\n\nAs a Deutsche Grammophon recording artist, teacher at the Paris Conservatoire and one of the titled organists at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, Olivier Latry is one of the world’s most celebrated organists. Ahead of his return to Sydney, we discuss his place in the rich tradition of French organ music and the unique instrument at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nSomething in the Wata\n\n14 June 2024\n\nPaul Grabowsky has spent two decades exploring ways to combine ‘Western’ musical tradition with the traditions of the world’s oldest-continuing culture. With Wata, which receives its Sydney premiere this July, he has arrived somewhere new, old, familiar and unique all at the same time.\n\nA Magical Atmosphere: Xavier de Maistre on the Beauty of the Harp\n\n7 June 2024\n\nPeople thought Xavier de Maistre was mad to leave his job with the Vienna Philharmonic and strike out solo. But nearly 20 years later, having expanded the repertoire and redefined the possibilities for his instrument, he's never been happier with his choice.\n\nAlexander Melnikov: The Reluctant Virtuoso\n\n4 June 2024\n\nHe is one of the world’s most celebrated pianists, but ahead of his Sydney Symphony debut Alexander Melnikov explains that it is the music that keeps him motivated – composers like Shostakovich, Schubert, Debussy and Brahms – not any sense of his own importance."
