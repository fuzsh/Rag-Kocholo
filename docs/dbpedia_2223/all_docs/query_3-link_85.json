        "text": "German cinematographer\n\nFritz Arno Wagner (5 December 1889 – 18 August 1958) is considered one of the most acclaimed German cinematographers from the 1920s to the 1950s.[1] He played a key role in the Expressionist film movement[2] during the Weimar period and is perhaps best known for excelling \"in the portrayal of horror,\" according to noted film critic Lotte H. Eisner.[3]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig, Germany, Wagner received his training at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris.[3] In 1910, while still attending the University of Leipzig, he managed to secure a job as a clerk at the Pathé film company.[4] In 1912, he became both secretary and chef at the Pathé offices in Vienna and later in Berlin.[5]\n\nCareer as cinematographer\n\n[edit]\n\nInterested in cinematography, Wagner became a newsreel cameraman in 1913 and was stationed in New York for Pathé Weekly, where he reported on the Mexican Revolution. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he returned to Germany to enlist in his country's elite Hussar cavalry whilst still filming war reports.[6][7] However, after being wounded, he decided to take the job of stills photographer and then 2nd cameraman at Projektions-AG Union PAGU. In 1919, he went to work as a primary cameraman for Decla-Bioscop.\n\nAlong with Karl Freund, Wagner became Germany's leading cinematographer of the 1920s and 1930s, a master of the dark, moody lighting that characterized the expressionist movement.[8] He worked with some of Germany most prominent directors, including Ernst Lubitsch on Madame Du Barry (1919), F.W. Murnau on The Haunted Castle (1921), The Burning Soil (1922) and his classic Nosferatu (1922), and G.W. Pabst on four features, The Love of Jeanne Ney (1927), Westfront 1918 (1930), Comradeship (1931) and The Threepenny Opera (1931) based on the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill musical. He also collaborated with Fritz Lang on four films, Destiny (1921), Spies (1928), M (1931) and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1932).\n\nAfter the Nazis took over in 1933, causing many of the country's leading film directors to flee Germany for the U.S. (including his collaborator Lang) Wagner's career began to decline. To make ends meet he abandoned his unique style and turned to making glossy costume epics and musicals for The Ministry of Propaganda at Universum Film AG [Ufa] where he had once worked under Erich Pommer.[9] After WWII, he worked for a couple of years as a director of photography of documentaries and newsreels before returning to feature films for the DEFA production company at Studio Babelsberg.[10]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Wagner died in Göttingen in an automobile accident (as his colleague Murnau had 27 years earlier) whilst shooting the comedy Ohne Mutter geht es nicht (It Doesn't Work Without a Mother) for director Erik Ode.[4][5][11][unreliable source?] He is buried at the Waldfriedhof Dahlem am Hüttenweg cemetery in Berlin.\n\nPortrayals\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Shadow of the Vampire, a fictional film about the making of Nosferatu, Wagner is portrayed by Cary Elwes, who also played Lord Arthur Holmwood in the 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n\nPartial filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a cinematographer[12]\n\nThe Galley Slave (1919)\n\nThe Closed Chain (1920)\n\nIntrigue (1920)\n\nParisian Women (1921)\n\nPlaying with Fire (1921)\n\nDestiny (1921)\n\nThe Haunted Castle (1921)\n\nNosferatu (1922)\n\nBarmaid (1922)\n\nLust for Life (1922)\n\nThe Call of Destiny (1922)\n\nThe Earl of Essex (1922)\n\nThe Anthem of Love (1922)\n\nThe Burning Soil (1922)\n\nWarning Shadows (1922)[13]\n\nBetween Evening and Morning (1923)\n\nThe Great Industrialist (1923)\n\nThe Hungarian Princess (1923)\n\nLeap into Life (1924)\n\nChronicles of the Gray House (1925)\n\nPeter the Pirate (1925)\n\nThe Telephone Operator (1925)\n\nThree Cuckoo Clocks (1926)\n\nThe Pink Diamond (1926)\n\nA Modern Dubarry (1927)\n\nAt the Edge of the World (1927)\n\nThe Love of Jeanne Ney (1927)[14]\n\nSpies (1928)\n\nSpy of Madame Pompadour (1928)\n\nThe Last Fort (1928)\n\nWaterloo (1929)\n\nDiary of a Lost Girl (1929)\n\nNapoleon at Saint Helena (1929)\n\nChasing Fortune (1930)\n\nScandalous Eva (1930)\n\nFire in the Opera House (1930)\n\nDolly Gets Ahead (1930)\n\nWestfront 1918 (1930)[15]\n\nComradeship (1931)\n\nRonny (1931)\n\nM (1931)[16]\n\nThe Threepenny Opera (1931)\n\nTannenberg (1932)\n\nTell Me Tonight (1932)\n\nThe Song of Night (1932)\n\nThings Are Getting Better Already (1932)\n\nThe Beautiful Adventure (1932)\n\nThe Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933)\n\nThe Castle in the South (1933)\n\nDream Castle (1933)\n\nRefugees (1933)\n\nSpies at Work (1933)\n\nAt the End of the World (1934)\n\nLove, Death and the Devil (1934)\n\nPlaying with Fire (1934)\n\nVolga in Flames (1934)\n\nThe Devil in the Bottle (1935)\n\nBlack Roses (1935)\n\nSavoy Hotel 217 (1936)\n\nUnder Blazing Heavens (1936)\n\nThe Man Who Was Sherlock Holmes (1937)\n\nTango Notturno (1937)\n\nThe Broken Jug (1937)\n\nAdrienne Lecouvreur (1938)\n\nRobert Koch (1939)\n\nA Hopeless Case (1939)\n\nEnemies (1940)\n\nLaugh, Pagliacci (1943)\n\nLaugh Bajazzo (1943)\n\nThe Court Concert (1948)\n\nGirls Behind Bars (1949)\n\nDoctor Praetorius (1950)\n\nThe Girl from the South Seas (1950)\n\nTorreani (1951)\n\nA Very Big Child (1952)\n\nThe Prince of Pappenheim (1952)\n\nThe Cousin from Nowhere (1953)\n\nThe Rose of Stamboul (1953)\n\nThe Country Schoolmaster (1954)\n\nClivia (1954)\n\nThe Faithful Hussar (1954)\n\nThe Great Lola (1954)\n\nConsul Strotthoff (1954)\n\nThe Ambassador's Wife (1955)\n\nA Thousand Melodies (1956)\n\nMy Sixteen Sons (1956)\n\nThe Girl Without Pyjamas (1957)\n\nThe Csardas King (1958)\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
