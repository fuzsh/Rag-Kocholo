        "text": "The following is an archived discussion of the DYK nomination of the article below. Please do not modify this page. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as this nomination's talk page, the article's talk page or Wikipedia talk:Did you know), unless there is consensus to re-open the discussion at this page. No further edits should be made to this page.\n\nThe result was: promoted by Allen3 talk 10:14, 27 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nArthur Wagner\n\n[edit]\n\n... that the clergyman Arthur Wagner had such a large collection of valuable books and manuscripts that it took three days to sell them after his death?\n\nALT1:... that as well as paying for several churches in Brighton, the clergyman Arthur Wagner spent at least Â£40,000 on building hundreds of houses for poor people?\n\nALT2:... that in the public outrage over the clergyman Arthur Wagner's role in the Constance Kent affair, he was assaulted in the street and shot at?\n\nReviewed: Template:Did you know nominations/Guo Pei\n\nComment: A long-planned collaboration moved from Zigzig20s's sandbox on 6 August 2015 with this edit. Wagner led an interesting life, so other hooks are possible; happy to see suggestions.\n\nMoved to mainspace by Hassocks5489 (talk) and Zigzig20s (talk). Nominated by Hassocks5489 (talk) at 21:28, 12 August 2015 (UTC).\n\nThis article is new enough and long enough. I have struck ALT1 as it has no inline citations, but either of the other hooks could be used. The article is neutral but the sources are largely unavailable to me so I could not check for close paraphrasing. Cwmhiraeth (talk) 09:39, 25 August 2015 (UTC)"
