        "text": "American composer (1853–1937)\n\nFor the American civil engineer and entrepreneur, see Arthur De Wint Foote. For the American tennis player, see Arthur E. Foote. For other uses, see Arthur Foot (disambiguation).\n\nArthur William Foote (March 5, 1853 in Salem, Massachusetts – April 8, 1937 in Boston, Massachusetts)[1][2] was an American classical composer, and a member of the \"Boston Six.\" The other five were George Whitefield Chadwick, Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, John Knowles Paine, and Horatio Parker.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nFoote was appointed organist of the First Church in Boston (Unitarian) in 1878, remaining there 32 years. A founder of the American Guild of Organists, he was one of the examiners at the first Guild Fellowship examination. He helped organize the New England chapter of the AGO, and from 1909 to 1912 (when the office was discontinued) he served as National Honorary President of the AGO, succeeding Horatio Parker in that position.[3] He was one of the editors of Hymns of the Church Universal, a Unitarian hymnal published in 1890.[4]\n\nThe modern tendency is to view Foote's music as \"Romantic\" and \"European\" in the light of the later generation of American composers such as Aaron Copland, Roy Harris and William Schuman, all of whom helped to develop a recognizably American sound in classical music. A Harvard graduate and the first noted American classical composer to be trained entirely in the U.S.,[5] in some sense he is to music what American poets were to literature before Walt Whitman.\n\nFoote was an early advocate of Brahms and Wagner and promoted performances of their music. Foote was an active music teacher and wrote a number of pedagogical works, including Modern Harmony in Its Theory and Practice (1905), written with Walter R. Spalding. It was republished as Harmony (1969). He also wrote Some Practical Things in Piano-Playing (1909) and Modulation and Related Harmonic Questions (1919). He contributed many articles to music journals, including \"Then and Now, Thirty Years of Musical Advance in America\" in Etude (1913) and \"A Bostonian Remembers\" in Musical Quarterly (1937).\n\nA good part of Foote's compositions consists of chamber music and these works are generally among his best. The Chamber Music Journal (2002), discussing Foote's chamber music, has written, \"If his name is not entirely unknown, it is fair to say that his music is. This is a shame. Foote's chamber music is first rate, deserving of regular public performance.\" His Piano Quintet, Op.38 and Piano Quartet, Op.23, are singled out for special praise. With regard to the Piano Quintet, the author writes, \"Each of the movements is a gem. The Scherzo is particularly fine and the rousing finale beyond reproach. I believe that the only reason this work never received the audience it deserved and deserves is because it was written by an American who was 'out of the loop.'\" As for the Piano Quartet, the opinion is that \"it is as good as any late 19th century piano quartet.\"\n\nFoote lived in Dedham, Massachusetts and was a member of the Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves. His students included Isabel Stewart North.[8]\n\nSelected works\n\n[edit]\n\nThree Pieces for Cello & Piano, Op. 1 (1881)\n\nString Quartet No. 1 in G minor, Op. 4\n\nPiano Trio No. 1 in C minor, Op. 5 (1883)\n\nThree Pieces for Violin & Piano, Op. 9\n\nSonata for Violin & Piano, Op. 20\n\nScherzo for Cello & Piano, Op. 22\n\nPiano Quartet in C major, Op. 23 (1890)\n\nFrancesca da Rimini, Op. 24 (1890)\n\nSerenade for Strings in E major, Op. 25\n\nThree Pieces for Oboe (or Flute) & Piano, Op. 31 (Flute = Op. 31B)\n\nString Quartet No. 2 in E major, Op. 32 (Finale performed separately as Tema con Variazione) (1893)\n\nCello Concerto in G minor, Op. 33\n\nRomanza for Cello & Piano, Op. 33 (piano reduction of slow movement of Cello Concerto, Op. 33)\n\nPiano Quintet in A minor, Op. 38 (1897)\n\nMelody for Violin & Piano, Op. 44\n\nFour Character Pieces after the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, Op.48 (1900)\n\nSuite in E major for Strings, Op. 63 (premiered and first recorded by the Boston Symphony Orchestra) (1907)\n\nPiano Trio No. 2 in B flat major, Op. 65 (1907–1908)\n\nBallad for Violin & Piano, Op. 69\n\nString Quartet No. 3 in D major, Op. 70\n\nSeven Pieces for organ.
