        "text": "Arthur William \"Will\" Wagner is one of the main characters in Avalon High.\n\nWill (as most characters call him) is the son of Arthur Wagner and Jean Campbell Wagner. He has a Border Collie named Cavalier, who corresponds to King Arthur's dog Cavall. His sailboat, the Pride Winn, corresponds to Arthur's Prydwyn. He is the main deuteragonist. When he asked Ellie, or as she is called in the film, Allie, she replied \"I have a boyfriend.\"\n\nAppearance[]\n\nWill has wavy brown hair, which he wears cropped short he and brown eyes. He is around six feet tall and considered very handsome. In the books, Will is described by Ellie as \"not handsome, really. But attractive. And nice. And strong-looking.\"\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWill is a very relaxed and good-natured person who only very seldom loses his temper. A very easygoing young man. However even he could lose his temper and get angry. Such as when he became angry at his friends Lance and Jennifer when learned that they had been dating behind his back. However, this is not so in the books. When he finds out about Jen and Lance in the books, he is shocked and hurt, but he never lashes out. He instead responds coldly and detaches himself as they head back to shore and then heads to his car and leaves. He later on goes to visit Ellie and reacts very calm and maturely. He even tells Ellie he somehow already knew and that he felt relieved (and he is guilty about feeling this way).\n\nBiography[]\n\nWill is a senior at Avalon High at the start of the book. He tells Ellie that he used to move a lot until his father took a teaching post at the Academy. At the start of the novel, he lives with his parents and Marco. He is a football player, probably valedictorian and very popular around school. He loves sailing and his best friend, Lance went on a sailing trip the summer before their senior year.\n\nAvalon High (2010 film)[]\n\nPersonal relationships[]\n\nAllie and Will\n\nNotes[]"
