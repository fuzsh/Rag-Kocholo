Now A “Slow Living” Movement Is Arising.\n\n\"(There's currently) a wave of writers encouraging active resistance to the relentless 'goal-oriented' expectation that, 'in a world where our value is determined by our productivity', every hour and minute of our time should be put to good use.\" Note the spread of the word \"niksen,\" the Dutch term for doing nothing. - BBC\n\nCould Terraced Rice Paddies Hold The Secret To Mitigating Urban Flooding?\n\n\"(There's a) trend in Asia seeing architects seek inspiration from the region's rice terraces and other agricultural heritages to help urban communities reduce waterlogging and flooding.

The majority of any given rural community must demonstrate a willingness to work towards arts vibrancy.” - SMU DataArts\n\nSlovakia’s Culture Minister Is On A Firing Spree\n\nThis week, Martina Šimkovičová — who only just moved from across the border in Austria into Slovakia though she's been minister since last October — abruptly dismissed the directors of the Slovak National Theatre and Slovak National Gallery. She reportedly plans to sack others who protested these firings. - The Slovak Spectator\n\nTwo Cultural Institutions Were Set On Fire During Bangladesh Riots\n\n\"Several locations across the capital, (Dhaka,) including Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, were set on fire as part of a wider uprising against prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been forced to resign after 15 years in power and has fled to India.\" - Artnet\n\nArt For Change Partners With Michelle Obama To Increase Voter Participation\n\nArtists are “constantly engaging with these ideas around family, community and relationships, so I think that we look to artists, not necessarily on how to rebuild society, but to tell us what’s wrong with it. Where does it hurt?” - The Guardian (UK)\n\nChurchill Loved Monet’s Work, Which Kept His Spirits Up During A Post-War Political Slump\n\nChurchill was not one to enjoy being out of power, and perhaps abandoned the Conservative Party leadership behind the scenes.

In North Carolina, It Looks Like This\n\n\"With a mission of publishing 'deep reporting about power and place in North Carolina,' the publication (called The Assembly) has an ambitious vision of curiosity-driven reporting that holds power to account. … (It) takes inspiration from other statewide magazines like California Sunday and Texas Monthly.\" - Nieman Lab\n\nOklahoma Governor’s Push To Get Bibles In Every Classroom Goes Right Back To 19th-Century Publishers\n\nStarting in the 1830s, the American Bible Society began a campaign to get inexpensive Bibles into homes \"in every part of the land,\" while the American Sunday-School Union, which considered secular books \"sweet poison\" for young minds, worked to replace them in classrooms with Christian instructional books and evangelical tracts. - Slate (MSN)\n\nHow Far Will Readers Go To Hear Music Inspired By Their Favorite Books?\n\nEven if you don’t include the music inspired by Shakespeare’s plays, pretty darn far, like countries’ worth of travel. - The New York Times\n\nThese Are The Thirteen Books Totally Banned In Utah Classrooms\n\nGood luck keeping A Court of Thorns and Roses out of the hands of teenagers, but also, this is horrifying - and includes Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake, for instance, along with Judy Blume, Rupi Kaur, and (are we surprised?) other women authors. - Salt Lake Tribune\n\nThe Emmys Finally Nominate The Right Writers\n\n“The writers’ branch of the TV Academy isn’t the general public, and it’s reasonable to wish they’d be more discerning in their choices.
