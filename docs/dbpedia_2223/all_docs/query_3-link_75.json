        "text": "The following is an archived discussion of a featured article nomination. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the article's talk page or in Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates. No further edits should be made to this page.\n\nThe article was promoted by User:GrahamColm 18:19, 9 February 2013‎ [1].\n\nNominator(s): Smerus (talk)\n\nI am nominating this for featured article because...together with a number of other editors I have been working over recent weeks to raise the article to FA status; with a particular hope that the article can feature as FA on 22 May 2013, the bicentenary of Wagner's birth. The page is well-watched and many comments have been received during this process, as can be seen from the talk page; we have therefore not sent the article for a formal peer review for FA (although it had one for GA not too long ago).Smerus (talk)\n\nSource review - spotchecks not done\n\nEllipses generally don't need to be bracketed\n\n\"Wagner wanted the first complete cycle to be performed in a new, specially designed opera house\" - source?\n\nMagee 2000 or 2001? Ashman 1988 or 1982? Gutman or Guttman? Check correspondence between footnotes and references - this will be quite time-consuming\n\nFN175: missing italics\n\nFN195: page in Ross? Page for FN199? 212? 213? You've got a few footnotes without pages where they seem to be needed\n\nFN188: link returns error\n\nDonington: missing comma\n\nForeign-language sources should be notated as such\n\nPublisher for John?\n\nLaibach link is dead and link checker reports other problems\n\nNeed a thorough checking here. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nI'm not sure if I understand your 9th point, as I see a publisher in the article. Regarding your 5th point—all those references are Internet ones. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThanks for these copyediting points, I will deal with them in the next day or two if no one else does. Please note both foreign-language sources are now correctly notated as such.--Smerus (talk)\n\nI believe that Nikkimaria's points have now been addressed by other editors and myself. I point out the following:\n\n\"Wagner wanted the first complete cycle to be performed in a new, specially designed opera house\" - source? - This is in fact addressed and sourced earlier in the article when discussing A Communication to My Friends, but I have now rephrased the passage, re-cited the original source, and given an additional source.\n\nFN188: link returns error (Laibach) - relocated page and given access date. The new page seems permanent.\n\nAshman - this source seemed to me suspect (details about Tannhauser in a book about The Dutchman), so I have replaced it with another citation.\n\nMagee (2000) - another editor has used the US edition which is from 2001. I have the 2000 UK edition, and have substituted this and checked all the page references.\n\nRoss: I have removed this quote, and its supposed source, which are only visible by subscription and anyway do not make any significant contribution to the article. As regards other internet citations, see the comment of Toccata quarta above.\n\nPublisher for John? - corrected.\n\nBest, --Smerus (talk)\n\nComments by Johnbod:\n\n\"In 1833, Wagner's older brother Carl Albert...\" - not previously introduced. Were there other siblings? I'd work any into the childhood years section.\n\n\" as choir master in Würzburg\" - for what? A school, a church, the opera house?\n\n...ore later. Johnbod (talk)\n\nsorted both these, thanks. --Smerus (talk)\n\nI've added the 2nd link in \"the unsuccessful May Uprising broke out, in which Wagner played a minor supporting role\" - if that article is accurate, \"minor supporting role\" is defence counsel talk. An \"active part\" perhaps?\n\nDon't we have a more idiomatic translation of: \"I shall never write an Opera more.\" and \"At a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time,\"?\n\nI think something should be added about his growing reputation in the late 1860s & early 1870s, presumably on the back of Tannhauser, Meistersingers & Lohengrin (Dutchman?), which were I think widely performed by the end of the 1860s.\n\nIf we're talking about growing reputation in that epriod, I think it would be more about the first performances of Tristan, Mastersingers and the first two Ring operas. Tannhauser, Dutchman and Lohengrin had been around for a while and I believe that Rienzi was just about the most popular of the lot.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\n'reputation' is not so easy to establish - but I have added a note indicating the spread of performances during this period.--Smerus (talk)\n\n\"he nevertheless reworked both the Dutchman and Tannhäuser on several occasions\". You might add that different versions are still performed and recorded.\n\nI certainly don't think the images should all be on the right, as suggested below, but most of them are fixed too small, at 130/150px, especially later in the article. There is space, & the MOS discourages fixing at small sizes.\n\nI'm not sure Rossini can be said to have \"resisted his influence\" as he must have been in his seventies when he made his famous joke, & had hardly composed for decades.\n\nIs there a case for a few audio clips dotted around?\n\nThat's it. Generally a very good read & certainly FA quality. Johnbod (talk)\n\nMany thanks, Johnbod. I will try to fix most of these points on the lines you suggest. The translation is Ashton Eliis's which although highly Victorian is the standard one used - I know of no others. I will think about the images. Audio clips are difficult because of the scale of the works. Best, --Smerus (talk)\n\nSupport though further polishing points below may still improve it. Johnbod (talk)\n\nSmerus, rather overlinked. Please see my edit on that count.\n\n\"and the elaborate use of leitmotifs: musical themes associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements\"—you can use a dash, but not a colon or semicolon.\n\n\"Unlike most other opera composers,\"—you could lose the \"other\".\n\n\"Wagner's life was characterized, until his last decades, by political exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors.\"—a bit bumpy. Perhaps re-order? \"Until his last decades, W...\". And there's a \"decades\" again, two sentences later.\n\nPersonal opinion: wouldn't it be better visually to have the pics all right-sided?\n\nThe music-language section ... could include much more technical stuff, but it is a summary article, I suppose. Tony (talk)\n\nmany thanks for this. I have gone through the changes 2-4 you propose, but as for the pics it is better I think to have people 'facing in'. As this article is for Wagner himself, I think it would be wrong to overload it with 'technical stuff', which can be found in other articles in the Wagner category. Best, --Smerus (talk)\n\nIt's a fine nomination—certainly in terms of cr. 1a, and probably other criteria, this is worthy of FA status.\n\n\"In Biebrich Wagner began work on Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, the idea for which had originally occurred to him in 1845,[78] but which he had resolved to develop during a visit he had made to Venice with the Wesendoncks in 1860, where he was inspired by Titian's painting The Assumption of the Virgin.\"—Can this huge winding sentence be tamed? And \"for which the idea\" might be better word order.\n\nFollowed by a stub: \"This opera is Wagner's only mature comedy.\n\nThen: \"Between 1861 and 1864 he also tried to have Tristan und Isolde produced in Vienna. Despite numerous rehearsals, the opera remained unperformed, and gained a reputation as being \"impossible\", which further added to Wagner's financial woes.\"—This is not the best para ... Is \"also\" necessary? \"Impossible\" in what sense—to perform? to listen to? Maybe \"further\" is not redundant here; I haven't looked at the previous context.\n\n\"The indiscreet affair scandalized Munich and Wagner also fell into disfavour amongst members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the king.\" I'd be more comfortable with a comma before \"and\" ... but it's partly personal style. Is \"also\" needed? \"Among\" is usually preferred nowadays to \"amongst\". Was it all members of the court who disapproved? (The current comma indicates this meaning.) Tony (talk)\n\nThanks for these comments. I have copyedited, using many of your suggestions,and added a new reference , to clarify.--Smerus (talk)\n\nRegarding \"with leading members of the court\"—just some, or all? If the former, then something like \"many\", \"some\" or \"several\" might be useful. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nnow clarified.--Smerus (talk)\n\nSupport Leaning to support A most impressive expansion of a very important—perhaps the most important—opera-related article. Many thanks to the major players in this project.\n\nCaveat: I contributed some of the prose used in the Bayreuth section, though I do not consider myself in any way a major contributor. The article has 8000 words of which maybe 150 are mine.\n\nAt an early stage in the article's development I left talkpage notes for the benefit of the major editors. Most of these seem to have been acted on; one that hasn't, and which I think should be reconsidered, is the retention of the Mahler image. I felt then, and do now, that Mahler's association with Wagner's music (the pair newer met; W died when M was still, metaphorically, in short pants) is not considerable enough to warrant an image in an already profusely illustrated article. Though Mahler did indeed conduct Wagner's operas, he never did at Bayreuth; he conducted works by many composers, yet his image doesn't decorate their articles. Not a sticking point for me, but worth a reconsideration.\n\nAt least two uncited paragraphs: the second of the \"Film portrayals\" section and the intro. to the \"Controversies\" section.\n\nI'd find an alternative word to \"putative\". Hardly anyone knows precisely what it means.\n\nI've only a few minutes online time now - will revist tomorrow with any further comments. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nBrian, thanks for these comments. My responses so far -\n\nI have added citations as you suggest, except for the final sentences of the first paragraph on \"Controversies\" which are really a mini-lead for the following paragraphs - it would I think be otiose to add further citations when each point is dealt with specifically in the following paras.\n\nI can't find 'putative', but would point out that this is not (yet) Simple English Wikipedia. :-} !!Later - have now found it. In fact I have recast the section, as a consequence of which the superfluous passage containing the putatively egregious offending word has been expurgated.\n\nOn Mahler - he is there to illustrate W.'s influence on music and the para cites support for him as an example, specifically Taruskin's comments on the music Mahler composed. This seems to me to justify the pic, but I welcome any further opinions.\n\nBest, --Smerus (talk)\n\nFine. Mahler never was a sticking point. I have upgraded to full support. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nSupport and Comments\n\n\"In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, Beethoven's 9th Symphony (both in the Gewandhaus).\" could be reworded to prevent Beethoven being mentioned twice.\n\n\"together with the collapse of the theatre company employing him\" feels a bit clumsy. Can it be reworded?\n\nKitchen Roll (Exchange words)\n\nBoth points now dealt with - thanks, --Smerus (talk)\n\nNot yet ... multiple:\n\nImage caption: \"The Bayreuth Festspielhaus today\", pls review WP:MOSDATE#Precise language. There are four uses of \"today\" in the article.\n\nIs this correct MOS:LQ? \"Each stone is red with my blood and yours\". Unsure ... pls review throughout.\n\nI don't understand the \"now\" here ... \"The Festspielhaus finally opened on 13 August 1876 with Das Rheingold, now taking its place as the first evening of the premiere of the complete Ring cycle.\"\n\nSee here and here for discussions of the overuse of however; please review throughout. There are 14 instances of \"however\", and most of them don't seem necessary.\n\nSimilarly, please review \"now\" and \"therefore\". SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nSample: Wagner was determined to set it to music, and therefore persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.[10] What is the therefore adding? SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nMultiple citations are missing page numbers ... since the short notes don't link directly to the long footnote, I've not checked to see if all need page ranges, but suspect many do.\n\nProse ... While Bayreuth presented a useful front for Nazi culture, and Wagner's music was used at many Nazi events,[242] many in the Nazi hierarchy did not share Hitler's enthusiasm for Wagner's operas and resented attending his lengthy epics at Hitler's insistence. ... Many ... many ... repetitive and vague.\n\nNow contains \"as a whole\"-- we can do better. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\n\" ... the Nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share Hitler's enthusiasm for Wagner's operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at Hitler's insistence.\" SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nIt is possible that Wagner's music was used at the Dachau concentration camp ... it is possible according to whom or what? Weasly.\n\nJean-Jacques Nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques to Wagner's life and works.[235] ... and ?? This sentence doesn't tell me anything.\n\nBetter (still doesn't tell us much, but at least we have attribution). SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nI suggest further prose review and tightening ... these are samples only. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nThanks for these comments. I have rectified points 1,3 and 6. (The caption on the picture, which has been in the article for quite sometime, in fact turned out to be incorrect). As regards point 7, I suggest this is not weaselly at all - the source cited deals with the suggestion and the probability of its correctness in very great detail, which would be out of place in the article. Point 8; the sentence tells you that Mr N. has interpreted W's life according to psychoanalytic theories, and indicates, in the context of the paragraph, that this is just one way of approaching Wagner and his works. Again a detailed exposition of Nattiez would be WP:UNDUE but the cited source will give readers more information. I am pretty sure I can reduce the number of \"however\"s - I will review presently the other points you have made. Best, --Smerus (talk)\n\nPS Point 2: This is correct per MOS:LQ, and so are all the quotations I have cited in my contributions to the article. I do not believe that 100% adherence to MOS:LQ as to positions of full stops and commas is a precondition of FA, but correctme if I am wrong on this.--Smerus (talk)\n\nPPS point 4. reduced howevers to 3, one of which is in a citation.--Smerus (talk)\n\nRe point 5. I don't qute understand this. Where page citations are given, I have checked them of course, and they are correct. (For what it is worth, I have experience of this sort of thing from my academic publications). Where there is a single number this means that, despite SandyGeorgia's 'suspicions', there is no 'page range' involved. Where there is no page number these are references to web locations. If SandyGeorgia (or any reviewer) has particular citations in mind, please indicate which these are. Thanks, --Smerus (talk)\n\nRe point 8: For clarity, I have added Nattiez's book to the sources and cited it in a note to the text.--Smerus (talk)\n\nOn point 7, it needs attribution to avoid weasle. According to whom will solve the issue. We shouldn't expect our readers to track down a source to understand why the sentence is there. Point 8, the setence tells us nothing, and unless you tell us what source said what about the significance of this psychoanalytic work, I suspect original research. There is no discernible reason for that sentence in the text; if there is one, according to sources, please give it. On point 5, we are still missing page ranges. On point 2, logical quotation, yes, FAs should strive to get it right (although it's unlikely LQ alone would hold up promotion). I still don't understand: Wagner remarked to Cosima: \"Each stone is red with my blood and yours\".[112] looks like a complete thought, sentence, and that the period should be inside the quote. What was the full quote? SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nPoints 7,8 I have copyedited/rewritten. I don't think, by the way, it is a reviewer's role to 'suspect' - what about WP:AGF? - though of course the role is to query, where there may be grounds for doing so. Point 5, please indicate which notes you believe are lacking page ranges. Point 2. I am presently 2000 miles away from my library so can't check this, but I am pretty sure I am right. What is not to understand? Probably something along the lines of '....my blood and yours, but it was worth it all the same.' Best, --Smerus (talk)\n\nre point 2: I have now reviewed and made one or two corrections.--Smerus (talk)\n\nRevisit by SandyGeorgia:\n\nand where his most important stage works continue to be performed today ...\n\nContinue ... today ... \"today\" is redundant. Similar is found later:\n\ncontinue to be regularly performed today throughout the world\n\nWill review--Smerus (talk) 09:06, 25 January 2013 (UTC) I have reviewed and made excisions/alterations where appropriate--Smerus (talk)\n\nThere is a similar overuse of the word \"now\" in the article; please review all of them. And \"therefore\", sample: was therefore the premiere of the complete cycle ... and therefore persuaded his family to allow him music lessons ... therefore adds nothing.\n\nWill review--Smerus (talk) 09:06, 25 January 2013 (UTC) I have reviewed and made excisions/alterations where appropriate. 5 appearances of 'now' (one being the title 'Apocalypse Now') are now, oops I mean presently, three. Two appearances of 'therefore', neither inappropriate, are not excessive or in any way deletereous to the quality of the article.--Smerus (talk)\n\n\"Hugely impressed\"? A most unfortunate colloquialism. Kind of like \"major\" anything. Unless that is a direct quote from a source, please fix.\n\nThis is WP:OR nit-picking. Who says this an unfortunate colloquialisim'? It is standard English. The source makes it clear that the terminology is justified. Choice of word issues, unless the words are misleading, are scarcely a priority in an FA review context.--Smerus (talk)\n\nAre you saying the source uses that colloquialism? If so, it should be quoted. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nthe Nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share Hitler's enthusiasm for Wagner's operas\n\nI think we you can do better than \"as a whole\".\n\nCan 'we'? So make a proposal if it worries you so much! - I scarcely have the temerity to do so myself before so formidable a critic. It is a standard English usage and I see nothing objectionable in it.--Smerus (talk)\n\nSandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nSandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nI appreciate the effort!\n\nSee more resolved questions --Gerda Arendt (talk)\n\n\"Wagner's middle stage output began with The Flying Dutchman (Der fliegende Holländer, 1843)\" - this is wrong, was reverted to the wrong version twice. Wagner wrote in German and thought in German. There are several ways to repair it:\n\n\"Wagner's middle stage output began with Der fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman, 1843)\"\n\n\"Wagner's middle stage output began with Der fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman, 1843)\" (better when the page will be moved, not too likely now, perhaps in 2020)\n\n\"Wagner's middle stage output began with Der fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman, 1843)\" --Gerda Arendt (talk)\n\nYou may want to compare FA Cosima Wagner, --Gerda Arendt (talk)\n\nI agree with Gerda. Wagner wrote and thought in German. We should link \"Der fliegende Holländer\" and keep (The Flying Dutchman, 1843)\" as an unlinked parenthetical. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nImage check - all OK (PD age, 1923 or own work), sources and authors provided. Some minor points and comments:\n\nSome images are not suitable for Commons yet, but properly flagged and kept on Wiki under US copyright - OK (no action required).\n\nFile:Wagnerbruhl.jpg - OK, but could use image category on Commons (not relevant for FA, just as info).\n\nFile:Siegfried_leitmotif.jpg - needs a source for the leitmotif's notation for possible verification.\n\nFile:Hanslick.jpg - any chance to find author info? Or add \"unknown\" as author, if not possible (pd-70 looks OK from the given years, but author or lack of info should be clarified).\n\nTweaked some licenses myself to more specific tags and other minor improvements (no action required). GermanJoe (talk)\n\nMany thanks -I have now dealt with all three issues you raise.--Smerus (talk)\n\nUpdated status. A very nice article, good luck with the remaining FA. GermanJoe (talk)\n\nSupport I weighed in at the peer review but was still dubious as to whether it was FAC ready. However, I've been monitoring the considerable work that's gone on during the course of the FAC, and it seems to meet the criteria.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nNote that I take no position on the question of what language the title should be in. I really don't think that issue detracts from what is a very fine article indeed.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nSpot checks – the delegate has asked me to do some. I have reserved at the British Library: Deathridge's Wagner Beyond Good and Evil; Gregor-Dellin's Richard Wagner – in the UK edition, which I devoutly hope will follow the pagination of the American edition used by the WP authors; Millington's Wagner Compendium; and all four volumes of Newman. The 1990 American edition of Gutman's book is not held by the British Library, so I'll stick to the above-mentioned seven books, and hope to report back by Tuesday or Wednesday. Tim riley (talk)\n\nMany tks Tim. Cheers, Ian Rose (talk)\n\nEnjoy!--Smerus (talk)\n\nSpot checks\n\nNo trace of close paraphrase or unacknowledged quotation. Where I say, below, that I didn't find something I admit that it may in fact be there and I have looked straight through it; I am quite prepared to be corrected. The few quibbles I have are pretty minor in any case.\n\nMillington (2001)\n\n2 – fine\n\n26 – fine\n\n19 – fine\n\n21a – fine\n\n21b – Millington doesn't quite say what the article says: he says the work was based on Die Laune des Verliebten, but was itself untitled\n\n21c – fine\n\n23a and b – fine\n\n25a – Millington mentions the failure of the production, but doesn't, on the cited page, mention Wagner's own financial difficulties\n\n25b – fine\n\n33 – fine\n\n35 – fine\n\n40 – fine\n\n42 – fine\n\n43 – fine\n\n44 – no mention of Heller here, as far as I could see\n\n46 – fine\n\n49 – I couldn't find any mention here of the goings on with the Julies\n\n55 – fine\n\n58 – fine\n\n59 – fine\n\n68 – fine\n\n81a – the source doesn't quite say what the article says: Millington dates the first draft to 1845, which is not exactly the same as saying the idea first came to him then\n\n81b – fine\n\n81c – I think the article goes slightly further than the quoted source: Millington just says \"irreversibly affected … emancipation of harmony\" – which is not the same as \"laying the groundwork\" for 20th century music. Nor does Millington say, as the article does, that \"many\" hold this view.\n\n92 – fine\n\n98 – fine\n\n103 – fine\n\n104 – fine\n\n125 – fine\n\n128 – fine\n\n136 – fine\n\n137 – fine\n\n139 – fine\n\n142 – fine\n\n155 – fine\n\n157 – fine\n\n162 – fine\n\n163 – fine\n\n166 – Millington's words do not support the statement here that the Ring is the only work of such length to make it into the repertory (though of course I'm not suggesting there are others)\n\n167 – fine\n\n176 – fine\n\n180 – fine\n\n181 – fine\n\n182 – fine\n\n183 – fine\n\n184 – fine\n\n192 – fine\n\n206 – fine\n\n218 – sorry to be Beckmesserish, but the source cited doesn't actually mention Beckmesser in re Hanslick\n\n231 – fine\n\nGregor-Dellin\n\nAlas, the British edition in the British Library, though it seems to be the same text, has decidedly different page numberings from the American edition used for the WP article.

For those of us who work on articles about classical music and the lives and works of composers it is a reminder of the standards we need to maintain. It is all the more creditable because the name Wagner is synonymous with controversy – Quot homines, tot sententiae. Sincere congratulations! A few drafting points. Nothing to frighten the horses, and certainly nothing to affect my support:\n\nGeneral\n\n\"–ize\" or \"–ise\"? Except within quotations you should, I think, be consistent on one or the other form. At present you have \"organised\", \"synthesised\", \"characterisations\" but \"realized\", \"characterized\", \"scandalized\", \"criticizes\", \"anglicization\".\n\nDate format – English or American? You have, e.g., 10 June 1865 but January 25, 1866 in the Return and resurgence (1862–71) section\n\nGerman surnames – specifically that of Hans von Bülow: I have always understood it is not done to include the \"von\" when referring to a man by surname alone: thus one talks of \"Otto von Bismarck\" but \"Bismarck\" not \"von Bismarck\", or \"Herbert von Karajan\" but \"Karajan\", not \"von Karajan\" – and so \"Bülow\" not \"von Bülow\".

Congratulations on fine work. Tim riley (talk)\n\nTim, very many thanks for this. I will go through all your comments. Checking re the references I can't really do till I'm back in London in mid-February. Best, --Smerus (talk)\n\nAs far as I'm concerned the points I have raised in both my sets of comments above are of minor consequence at most, and for myself I'd be happy to see them addressed after the article is promoted (as I hope it will be). Tim riley (talk)\n\nI believe I have nowdealt appropriately with all the above, save for the citation queries.--Smerus (talk)\n\nA great deal of work by nominator and reviewers, thanks all. Given the time already invested in this review, I'm inclined to agree with Tim's last suggestion to leave minor referencing fixes till after promotion if the nominator can't get back to his sources for a couple of weeks (my own comments below re. additional citations may also fall into that category). Anyway, some things I noticed:\n\nMany duplicate links were revealed by Ucucha's checker; I removed a couple but would prefer the nominator to review the rest and remove as appropriate (some may be justified owing to the length of the article).\n\nI'd expect as a matter of course all paragraphs to end in citations, even if some of the facts are considered common knowledge or otherwise uncontroversial, i.e.\n\nIn exile: Switzerland (1849–58), fifth paragraph\n\nLast years (1876–83), second para\n\nProse writings, first para -- I guess can be taken as an intro to the cited material to follow, so not a big deal\n\nControversies, first para -- ditto\n\nOpponents and supporters, last section of final sentence (perhaps this simply requires moving the mid-sentence citation to the end)\n\nJust throwing in my 2 cents worth as far as content goes, there is a stronger Hitler quote than I think you have currently under Nazi appropriation, from Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, i.e. \"Whoever wants to understand National Socialist Germany must know Wagner\" -- FWIW.\n\nCheers, Ian Rose (talk)\n\nIan, thanks for this. I will try to go over as many of these points as I can (with Tim's) over the next few days. I love the Shirer quotation, which I know well - but there's a problem - I have never been able to track it down to precisely something that Hitler is documented as saying, although I have made much effort to do so. It's such a dandy that he ought to have said it - but I'm rather afraid we can't just take Shirer's word on this. If anyone can provide a stone-bonk certainty source, I will of course be delighted! (I mention by way of caution the story which 'everyone knows', and wich is constantly cited in Hitler biographies, that Hitler started on his political career after being inspired by a performance of Wagner's 'Rienzi'- a story which has recently been revealed as a complete fantasy). --Smerus (talk)\n\nI think I have now dealt with these issues, although a couple of ends of non-prefatory paras could perhaps still be improved with citations - I will deal with these when I deal with Tom Riley's citation queries.--Smerus (talk)\n\nWell I think the dup links need further review. As I've indicated, in a longish article some may be justified but Tannhäuser (just a random example) is linked three times in the main body, which is surely excessive. Cheers, Ian Rose (talk)\n\nThanks, I will certainly recheck the dup links. --Smerus (talk)\n\nI have now removed duplicate links, except for once each again for operas and other musical works in the 'Works' section - I think this may be justified in a lengthy article - also some readers may want to skip the 'Life' section and just see about the works.--Smerus (talk)\n\nGeneral\n\nPossible copyvio, non-free use image. - File:Photo of Gustav Mahler by Moritz Nähr 01.jpg appears to be PD in the US only and not in its country of origin. Also, the file is tagged as not appropriate for Wikicommons and it lacks a Wagner FUR.\n\nPer Wikipedia:Writing better articles: \"One-sentence paragraphs are unusually emphatic, and should be used sparingly.\" I count at least seven instances of one-sentence paragraphs. I think a few could easily be avoided. I will review\n\nPer WP:MOSIM: \"Avoid sandwiching text between two images that face each other, and between an image and an infobox or similar.\" Text is currently being sandwiched by images in the sections: \"Return and resurgence (1862–71)\", \"Music dramas\" (1851–82) and \"Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger\". I will review\n\nNietzsche-Wagner relationship. - Perhaps I am missing it in the article, but I don't see anything about Wagner-Nietzsche.\n\nTry the Bayreuth and, particularly, the Influence on literature, philosophy and the visual arts sections, Gabe. Cheers, Ian Rose (talk)\n\nIn Bayreuth: \"Friedrich Nietzsche, who, having published his eulogistic essay \"Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\" before the festival as part of his Untimely Meditations, was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as Wagner's pandering to increasingly exclusivist German nationalism; his breach with Wagner began at this time.[116]\"\n\nIn Influence on literature, philosophy and the visual arts: \"Nietzsche broke with Wagner following the first Bayreuth Festival, believing that Wagner's final phase represented a pandering to Christian pieties and a surrender to the new German Reich.\"\n\nThese two points are at least somewhat redundant, not? Also, I meant the Nietzsche-Wagner relationship, not just that they knew each other. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nInconsistencies (from \"Romantic operas (1843–51)\"). - \"Wagner's middle stage output began with The Flying Dutchman (Der fliegende Holländer, 1843), which is closely followed in the article text by: \"The first two components of the Ring cycle were Das Rheingold (The Rhinegold), which was completed in 1854, and Die Walküre (The Valkyrie)\". Why is The Flying Dutchman rendered in English and parenthetically translated to German when the rest of the article does the opposite? As with this passage, which appears twice in the paragraph: \"Dutchman and Tannhäuser\". So why the mix of English and German titles and why not \"Holländer and Tannhäuser\"?\n\nGlaring omissions\n\nNearly everywhere in the article where a German term is used it is followed by a parenthetical English translation, but this is not the case for \"Wahnfried\" (\"Peace from Illusion\"), in \"Bayreuth (1871–76)\".\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article: \"Wagner also began to dictate his autobiography, Mein Leben, at the King's request.[87]\" It should be noted that he dictated the bio to Cosima.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article: \"Wagner sought to have Tristan und Isolde produced in Vienna.[82] Despite numerous rehearsals, the opera remained unperformed, and gained a reputation as being \"impossible\" to sing, which added to Wagner's financial woes.[83]\" From Britannica online: \"He remained in Vienna for about a year, then travelled widely as a conductor and awaited a projected production of Tristan. When this work was not produced because the artists were bewildered by its revolutionary stylistic innovations\". I think the Wikipedia version of this datum needs improvement. 1) \"impossible\" to sing, and 2) \"Wagner's financial woes\", in particular.\n\nThe article quotes Wagner: \"I shall never write an Opera more. As I have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works, I will call them Dramas\", but it does not explicate the fact that he: \"prophesied the disappearance of opera as artificial entertainment for an elite and the emergence of a new kind of musical stage work for the people\". (Britannica online)\n\n\"In 1861 an amnesty allowed him to return to Germany; from there he went to Vienna, where he heard Lohengrin for the first time.\" Ibid. The article does not mention that he went to Vienna (for a year), where he heard Lohengrin for the first time.\n\nWagner was at least once imprisoned for debt (1840), but the article does not mention this.\n\nThe article establishes quite well that Wagner had ongoing financial difficulties, but it does not attempt to explain why he had problems with creditors. What did he spend his money on and why was he always in debt? I assume he lived beyond his means, but this is not explicated in the article.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia Britannica: \"several elder sisters became opera singers or actresses\" and this proved \"a main formative influence\" on Wagner, yet our Wikipedia article does not mention his sisters or their influence on his interest in opera, which is currently credited entirely to Geyer.\n\nSee note 1. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nNote 1 says something vague about \"careers connected with the stage\", but nothing about Wagner's sisters singing or acting or their influence on him in that regard. That is the glaring omission. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nFactual error? - Britannica says Wagner \"taught himself the piano\", the Wikipedia article says he \"received a little piano instruction from his Latin teacher\" and \"persuaded his family to allow him music lessons\".\n\nBritannica says \"On leaving the university that year, he spent the summer as operatic coach at Würzburg, where he composed his first opera, Die Feen (The Fairies), based on a fantastic tale by Carlo Gozzi.\" The article currently does not mention his work as an operatic coach or that The Fairies was based on a story by Carlo Gozzi. Which would seem an especially important point, that Wagner did not compose \"his first complete opera\" without inspiration from Gozzi. E.g., the article mentions that The Flying Dutchman was based on a sketch by Heinrich Heine.\n\nFact check. - Are \"musical director\" and \"conductor\" synonymous? Britannica says he was a conductor at Magdeburg, but perhaps the two terms are interchangeable.\n\nWhile in Paris, Wagner was for a time \"living with a colony of poor German artists\".Ibid. The Wikipedia article does not mention this.\n\n\"In 1831, Wagner enrolled at the University of Leipzig, where he became a member of the Saxon student fraternity.[17]\" Ignores the fact that he did so \"as an adjunct with inferior privileges, since he had not completed his preparatory schooling.\" Ibid.\n\n\"Rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on 20 October.[39]\" should be followed by a paraphrase of: \"The next year The Flying Dutchman ... was less successful, since the audience expected a work in the French-Italian tradition similar to Rienzi and was puzzled by the innovative way the new opera integrated the music with the dramatic content.\" Ibid. This second point (from Britannica) speaks both to the general lack of critical commentary in regard to Wagner's musical innovations and to a general sense that most of the less flattering datums have been intentionally avoided.\n\nMissing notable datum. - \"The refusal of the court opera authorities in Dresden to stage his next opera, Lohengrin, was not based on artistic reasons; rather, they were alienated by Wagner’s projected administrative and artistic reforms. His proposals would have taken control of the opera away from the court and created a national theatre whose productions would be chosen by a union of dramatists and composers.\" (Britannica online) This point illustrates well the resistance Wagner dealt with in regard to his musical innovations.\n\nInfluence of Liszt's innovative tone poems c. 1857. \"By 1857 his style had been enriched by the stimulus of Liszt’s tone poems and their new harmonic subtleties\". (Britannica online)\n\nNo mention of his \"long-cherished plan to win renown in Paris\".\n\nLack of critical commentary. - \"The musically cultured public of the earlier nineteenth century had a comfortable, established conception of what music was – and to them it was not what Wagner composed.\" —Ronald Taylor. Works of critical commentary regarding Wagner's music certainly do exist, the are just not currently represented in the article, which would seem to fail both 1b and 1d of the Wikipedia:Featured article criteria based on this glaring omision. From the Encyclopedia Britannica: \"Tannhäuser was coolly received but soon proved a steady attraction; after this, each new work achieved public popularity despite persistent hostility from many critics.\"\n\nRe: Parsifal: \"He has been much criticized for this strongly personal treatment of a religious subject, which mingles the concepts of sacred and profane love\". I see no mention of any criticism of Parsifal, as though the work was universally accepted with favour.\n\nFactual errors\n\n\"The political ban that had been placed on Wagner in Germany after he had fled Dresden was fully lifted in 1862. The composer settled in Biebrich in Prussia.[77]\" This is misleading/confusing, as his ban from Germany was (at least partially) lifted in 1861, the same year he returned there. As the article currently reads it sounds as if he did not return to Germany until 1862. Also, the article later goes on to say: \"Throughout this period (1861–64) Wagner sought to have Tristan und Isolde produced in Vienna.\" Which seems a bit awkward in a section titled: \"Return and resurgence (1862–71)\", which implies his \"return\" to Germany was in 1862.\n\nSourcing issues\n\nThree or four of the \"notes\" do not provide any sourcing whatsoever.\n\nInconsistencies. - In \"Other sources\", some of the works use isbn-13 while many others use isbn-10. According to Wikipedia:ISBN: \"Please use the 13-digit one if available\", as they almost always are.\n\nInconsistencies. - cite #134: \"^ The WWV is available online in German (accessed 30 October 2012)\", cite #143: \"^ Wagnerjahr 2013 website, accessed 14 November 2012\". Sometimes accessdates are enclosed in parentheses and other times they are not.\n\nInconsistencies. - Cite #111: \"^ Cited in Spotts (1994) 54\", cite #112: \"^ Spotts (1994) 11\".\n\nInconsistencies. - Cite #63: \"^ See Magee (2000) 251–3.\", cite #212: \"^ Magee (1988) 47\". Some cite include \"see\", most do not. The citiations should be internally consistent.\n\nCite #167: \"^ Cosima Wagner (1978) II, 647. Entry of 28 March 1881.\" Do you mean dated 28 March? Or is this yet another EngVar issue?\n\nCite #169: \"^ Newman (1976) IV, 578. Letter from Wagner to the King of 19 September 1881.\" Who was the King of 19 September 1881? Perhaps you mean: \"^ Newman (1976) IV, 578. Letter from Wagner to King Ludwig, dated 19 September 1881\", or similar.\n\nCiting Wikipedia. - Cite #214: \"^ Millington (2001) 26. See also New German School and War of the Romantics\". Avoid citing other Wikipedia pages since they are not considered WP:RSs.\n\nInconsistencies. Cite #47: \"Also see Millington (1992) 282, 285.\" Cite #245: \"See also Field (1981).\" Is it \"see also\" or \"also see\"? Or is there an EngVar issue that allows editors to use either interchangeably?\n\nMissing accessdate. - Cite #249: \"^ Fackler (2007). See also the Music and the Holocaust website.\"\n\nLead\n\nClarity. - The lead currently states: \"his Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music\", yet in the article body the point is stated slightly differently as: \"Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan\". \"Modern music\" and \"modern classical music\" imply quite different connotations.\n\nParenthetical \"scare quote\". - \"(or, as Wagner himself called some of his later works, 'music dramas')\". Per WP:LEADCITE: \"direct quotations ... must be provided with an inline citation every time it is mentioned\". I will review\n\nExcess detail. - \"leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements.\" Is the lead really the most appropriate place to explain to the reader what leitmotifs are? The term is already linked. Yes, as this is an impotant element of Wagner's style and influence\n\nAwkward. - \"His advances in musical language,\" I don't think he added anything to the language of music per se. I think what you are trying to say that his use of \"extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres\" was musically innovative, but surely these were not musical expressions invented by Wagner, as the prose currently implies. I am indeed saying that Wganer introduced these feaures as central elements in his style.\n\nModifier choice. - \"greatly influenced the development of classical music\". I would swap-out \"greatly\" for \"significantly\". Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse. - \"Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works.\" Is \"Unlike most opera composers\" necessary? It seems too vague for the lead. Yes important, and I don't see what's vague - it's true.\n\nAwkward. - \"as a composer of works broadly in the romantic vein\" The use of \"broadly\" seems awkward to me and I think it could be removed. I will review\n\nConfusing prose. - \"Wagner transformed operatic thought through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total work of art\").\" What does \"transformed operatic thought\" mean? Was opera pre-Wagner an \"incomplete work of art\"? I will review; but there is an element of deliberate miscomprehension in your second comment\n\nPlease see WP:AGF. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nProse. - \"It sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts\". \"It\" here is referring back to \"his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk\", but how can a concept seek to take direct action? I think you mean to say that he \"sought to synthesise ...\". I will review\n\nConfusing. - \"with music subsidiary to drama\". There are no spoken words in an opera, so how could the music be \"subsidiary to drama\" when the drama originates from the music? See comment by Toccata quarte below\n\nProse. - \"Wagner realized these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen\" \"Most fully\" is awkward and were these ideas not realised in the second half of the work? I disagree about awkwardness and your interpretation is correct - see in artcle.\n\nExcess detail. - \"which contained many novel design features\" This seems like excess detail for the lead. Did Wagner design the building himself? not excess; he was colsely inolved in designing.\n\nProse. - \"received their premieres\", try \"premiered\". Your taste vs. mine\n\nNo that is WP:ENGVAR Johnbod (talk)\n\nBut later in the article the prose is worded as I suggested above. How can an inanimate object (an opera) receive a premiere?GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nSee [2]. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nProse. - \"an annual festival run by his descendants\", try: \"an annual festival organized by his descendants\". Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse. - \"His thoughts on the relative importance of music and drama\", do you mean to say \"His thoughts on the relative balance (or emphasis) of music and drama\"? I will review\n\nProse. - \"were to change again\" try \"changed again\". Your taste vs. mine\n\nVague modifiers. - \"he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works\", try: \"he reintroduced traditional forms into his final stage works\" No, he only reintroduced some.\n\nRedundant prose. - \"Until his last years\" follows too closely behind \"his last few stage works\", which would be fixed by my suggestion directly above. I will review\n\nUnencyclopedic prose. - \"turbulent love affairs\" seems less then encyclopedic to me. Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse. - \"repeated flight from his creditors\", could Wagner fly? I think you mean to say that he \"repeatedly fleed from his creditors\", or similar. Don't be silly\n\n\"fleed\" ????!!!! Johnbod (talk)\n\nSorry, I made a typo and obviously meant \"fled\". But wow, I've never seen a reviewer get double-teamed by a delegate and a contributor. Way to encourage FAC reviews guys! GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nYou should read more reviews. Johnbod (talk)\n\nActually, if this is how they tend to go, then I will read fewer (not more) and contribute to them even less. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nProse. - \"The effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the 20th century\" \"traced\"? How about: \"The effect of his innovations can be identified in art throughout the 20th century\". Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse. - \"especially where they have antisemitic content\" try: \"especially where they contain antisemitic sentiments\", or similar. Your taste vs. mine\n\nI disagree and I think you have used the \"Your taste vs. mine\" non-resolution excessively. Writing cannot have antisemitic content, works may contain or include antisemitic content, or Wagner may have at times espoused antisemitism, but his writings do not have antisemitic content, some of them contain or include such sentiments. To clarify further: \"have\" is a possessive verb, but an inanimate object (e.g. a book, poem or libretto) cannot possess anything. So using \"have\" in this context improperly personifies Wagner's writings and is poor quality English at best; and its in the lead no less. This example is representative of the awkward prose found throughout the article that the nom refuses to improve. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nEarly years\n\nRepetition. - \"Richard was sent to the Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother.[8] \"\n\nAbbreviations. - \"Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig, at No. 3\", shouldn't this be \"Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig, at number 3\"? Why?\n\nSo as to avoid the unnecessary mid-sentence terminal punctuation point following \"No.\". I've been told this numerous times over the years at FAC; we don't write \"No. 3\" when \"number 3\" or \"number three\" will convey the same information. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nExcess parenthetical? - \"the Brühl (The House of the Red and White Lions),\" I assume The House of the Red and White Lions moniker is exlicated at the topical article Brühl (Leipzig).\n\nConfusing/awkward prose. - \"Wagner's father died of typhus six months after Richard's birth, after which Wagner's mother began living with the actor and playwright Ludwig Geyer, a friend of Richard's father.[3]\" I think we could use given names here for clarity such as: \"Carl died of typhus six months after Richard's birth, after which Johanna began living with a friend of Carl's, the actor and playwright Ludwig Geyer.[3]\" I will review\n\nProse. - \"although no documentation of this is found in the Leipzig church registers.[4]\" Try: \"although no documentation of this has been found in the Leipzig church registers.[4]\" I will review\n\nOveruse of the passive voice. - \"Until he was fourteen, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer.\" Try: \"Until age fourteen, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer.\" Your taste vs. mine\n\nAgain, ENGVAR - \"age fourteen\" is incorrect in British English. Johnbod (talk)\n\nThen perhaps \"aged fourteen\", but why would editors of an article about a German subject be required to use British English over American English anyway? GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nSee WP:ENGVAR; once one form is picked it should be used consistently. Johnbod (talk)\n\nPicked by whom? Sounds like WP:OWN to me. GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nProse. \"He almost certainly[vague] thought that Geyer was his natural father.[5]\" Swap \"natural\" with \"biological\" for clarity. I will review\n\nWordy. - \"Geyer's love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances.\" Try: \"Geyer's love of the theatre came to be shared by Wagner, who took part in his performances.\" Your taste vs. mine\n\nExcess detail. - \"In his autobiography, Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel.[6]\" This detail seems better as a note. Your taste vs. mine\n\nExcess detail. - \"at Possendorf, near Dresden\", is \"near Dresden\" needed here? It seems like an excess geographical datum.No WP entry for Possendorf, so better thus.\n\nProse. - \"where he received some piano instruction from his Latin teacher.\" Omit \"some\" as excess. Also, is this the very first musical instruction Wagner received? If so, perhaps that point should be briefly explicated here. I will review\n\n\"piano lessons\" ? Johnbod (talk)\n\nAwkward, excess prose. - \"He could not manage a proper scale at the keyboard, and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear\", try: \"He struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard, and preferred playing by ear\". I will review\n\nVerbose. - \"Following Geyer's death in 1821, when Richard was eight, he was sent to the Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother.[8]\" Try: \"Following Geyer's death in 1821, Richard was sent to the Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother.[8]\" I will review\n\nProse. - \"At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the Gothic elements of Weber's opera Der Freischütz, which he saw conducted by the composer.[9]\" 1) \"hugely impressed\" is not encyclopedic, 2) \"which he saw conducted by the composer\" is awkward. Try: \"which Wagner saw Weber conduct\", 3) I think we need to use Weber's full name on his first mention in the article. I will review\n\nThe name maybe, the rest is fine. Johnbod (talk)\n\nConfusing prose. - \"At this stage Wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright.\" Its confusing to use the term \"stage\" as in \"period\" in a sentence about the theatre. I will review\n\nVerbose. - \"His first creative effort (which, in the standard listing of Wagner's works, the Wagner-Werke-Verzeichnis, stands as WWV 1) was a tragedy called Leubald, begun at school in 1826, which was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe.\" Try: \"His first creative effort, listed in the Wagner-Werke-Verzeichnis as WWV 1, was a tragedy called Leubald. Begun at school in 1826, is was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe.\"\n\nPassive voice. - \"Wagner was determined to set it to music, and therefore persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.[10][n 2]\", try: \"Wagner, determined to set it to music, persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.[10[n 2]\" Your taste vs. mine\n\nComma use. - I count three commas in an 11-word sentence. \"By 1827, the family had returned, now with Geyer, to Leipzig.\" Try: \"By 1827 the family had returned with Geyer, to Leipzig.\" Actually this is a complete error -Geyer died in 1821 - I will correct..\n\nProse. - \"Wagner's first lessons in harmony were taken in 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller.[11]\" I think \"taken in 1828–31\" should read \"taken during 1828–31\", as I'm not sure you can do something in a three year span and it avoids the redundancy of \"in\" twice within five words. I will review\n\nProse, punctuation. - \"In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both in the Gewandhaus).\" Try: \"In January 1828, he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both in the Gewandhaus).\" Also, is the parenthetical needed here? Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse. - \"Beethoven became his inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony.[12]\" Wagner was inpsired by more than just Beethoven. Try: \"Inspired by Beethoven, Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony.[12]\" I will review\n\nProse. - \"He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart's Requiem.[13]\" \"Greatly impressed\" strikes me as unencyclopedic. Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse. - \"In 1829 he saw the dramatic soprano Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient on stage\". 1) use commas after introductory phrases, 2) re: \"dramatic soprano\", I think dramatic is an excess modifier, 3) Try: \"In 1829, he saw soprano Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient perform on stage\". Leaving it as \"he saw the dramatic soprano Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient on stage\" is a bit confusing, was she performing? I will review. Dramatic soprano is an operatic term, I will link\n\nAwkward prose. - \"and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera\" Try: \"her fusion of drama and music in opera inpired him.\" Your taste vs. mine\n\nLinking. - \"In his autobiography (liked), Wagner wrote\", but above in the same section: \"In his autobiography(no link), Wagner recalled\". Link on first mention in lead and then the first mention in the article body.I will review\n\nProse. - Though I realise that an \"almost demonic fire\" preceeds the text string, \"kindled in him\" seems unencyclopedic.Your taste vs. mine\n\nProse, passive voice. - \"Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons.\" \"so impressed\" is also unencyclopedic IMO. Try: \"Impressed with Wagner's musical ability, Weinlig refused any payment for his lessons.\" Your taste vs. mine\n\nOveruse of the passive voice, clarity. - \"(which was consequently dedicated to him)\", try: \"(consequently dedicated to Weinlig)\".Your taste vs. mine\n\nLacking some detail, prose. - \"In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel's school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received a little piano instruction from his Latin teacher.[7] He struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard, and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear.\" 1) \"a little piano instruction\" needs a recast as it sounds like he learned on a miniature piano. Try: \"where he received basic piano instruction from his Latin teacher.[7]\" 2) The second sentence does not explicate that his teachers felt that he did not show aptitude in music and, in fact, his teacher said he would \"torture the piano in a most abominable fashion.\"\n\nProse. - \"hugely impressed\" and \"greatly impressed\" appear in two consecutive paragraphs. Both are colloquialisms that should be avoided in academic writing.\n\nEarly career (1833–42)\n\nRepetition. - \"arrived in Paris in\" Consider: \"arrived in Paris during\".\n\nLinking. - \"which imitated the style of Carl Maria von Weber\" Weber's full name is linked here, but her last name is linked four paragraphs previous.\n\nWordy. - \"Wagner's brother Albert managed to obtain for him\", try: \"Wagner's brother Albert secured for him\", or similar.\n\nProse. - \"Wagner held a brief appointment as musical director\", try: \"Wagner briefly served as musical director\", or similar.\n\nUnencyclopedic parenthetical. - \"(not for the last time)\". If the article properly establishes Wagner's pattern of debt (see the next paragraph in the article), then this foreshadow seems excessive and unencyclopedic.\n\nUnencyclopedia prose. \"with serious money problems\", try: \"with severe financial problems\"\n\nExcess detail, prose. - \"Wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at Magdeburg, the actress Christine Wilhelmine \"Minna\" Planer.[26]\" 1) Is it especially notable that she was a leading lady? 2) Leading lady is not encyclopedic, it sounds quite Hollywood-esque to me. In opera, a leading lady is called a prima donna, Italian for first lady.\n\nInconsistent punctuation. I noticed an apparent inconsistency with the article's use of comma, sometimes afte rintroductory phrase sometimes not. E.g. \"In 1831, Wagner enrolled at the University of Leipzig\" then two parapgraphs later: \"In May 1837 Minna left Wagner for another man\" and then the next paragraph: \"In June 1837, Wagner moved to Riga\"\n\nUnencyclopedic prose. - \"this was but the first débâcle of a troubled marriage\".\n\nConfusing and awkward prose. - \"having in this capacity engaged Minna's sister Amalie (also a singer) for the theatre, he presently resumed relations with Minna during 1838.[31]\"\n\nProse. - \"they fled Riga to escape from creditors\", were the creditors hunting them down as law enforecement would, or did they just skip out on the bill? Sounds like they were being pursued, not sure that's what you mean.\n\nProse. - \"During their flight, they took a stormy sea passage to London\" Are they on a plane or a ship? I'm kidding of course, but I would like to see a word other then \"flight\" used here so as to avoid the jarring connotation.\n\nProse. - \"In June 1837, Wagner moved to Riga (then in the Russian Empire),\" I think \"(then part of the Russian Empire)\" would be better English prose.\n\nMissing detail about Wagner's imprisonment for debt. - The article says he fled from creditors but does not mention that he was actually imprisoned in 1840.\n\nDresden (1842–49)\n\nChronological breaks. - Why does a section titled 1842–49 begin with information dealing with the earlier period? E.g. \"Wagner completed Rienzi in 1840.\" Which is also redundant with the previous sentence: \"He also completed during this stay his third and fourth operas Rienzi and Der fliegende Holländer.[36]\" I suggest that the Rienzi material be merged into the previous section for flow.\n\nUnencyclopedic. - \"Wagner also mixed with artistic circles in Dresden\", \"mixed\" sounds like slangy journalese here as does \"artistic circles\".\n\n\"moved in\" possibly. Johnbod (talk)\n\nThat's still slang John. Consider: \"Wagner socialised with artists while in Dresden\", or is this yet another EngVar issue? GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nNo, that's just being pompous. Nothing slangy about \"moved in\". Johnbod (talk)\n\nReally? You find the word \"socialised\" pompous? So you think: \"Wagner also moved in artistic circles in Dresden\" is better prose than: \"Wagner socialised with artists while in Dresden\"? How can one \"move in an artistic circle\", sounds to me like Wagner is dancing? GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nAwkward prose. - \"The Wagners' stay at Dresden was brought to an end by Richard's involvement in leftist politics.\" Try: \"Richard's involvement in leftist politics hastened the end of the Wagners' stay at Dresden.\"\n\nColloquialism. - \"Widespread discontent in Dresden came to a head in 1849\". \"Came to a head\" is unencyclopedic.\n\nColloquialism. - \"when the unsuccessful May Uprising broke out\" Instead of \"broke out\" try \"began\".\n\nProse. - \"Warrants were issued for the arrest of the revolutionaries; Wagner had to flee, first visiting Paris and then settling in Zurich\". Try: \"After warrants were issued for the arrest of the revolutionaries, Wagner fled first to Paris before settling in Zurich.\"\n\nNotable detail missing. - The article should mention that in 1844 Wagner was awarded the Prussian order of the Red Eagle.\n\nIn exile Switzerland (1849–58)\n\nExcessive use of the passive voice. - \"Wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from Germany.\" Try: \"Wagner spent the next twelve years in exile from Germany.\"\n\nProse. - \"Nevertheless, Wagner found himself in grim personal straits\", 1) \"Nevertheless\" is unencyclopedic excess, same with: \"grim personal straits\".\n\nProse. - \"isolated from the German musical world\", consider: \"isolated from the German musical establishment\".\n\nProse. - \"but this plan was aborted\", swap \"aborted\" with \"abandoned\".\n\nPossible typo? - \"when Wagner began an affair with Mme. Laussot.\"\n\nUnrelated parenthetical. \"Meanwhile, Wagner's wife Minna, who had disliked the operas he had written after Rienzi, was falling into a deepening depression.\" Did her dislike of Wagner's post Rienzi contribute to her depression? I don't see how these two datums are related.\n\nProse. - \"Wagner himself fell victim to ill-health\", try: \"Wagner also fell victim to ill-health\".\n\nAwkward prose. Missing word? - \"Wagner himself fell victim to ill-health, according to Ernest Newman \"largely a matter of overwrought nerves\", which made it difficult for him to continue writing.\" It seems to me that this text string is missing a clause along the lines of \"caused by\" or \"exacerbated by\" or similar.\n\nConfusing modifier. - \"Wagner's primary published output during his first years in Zurich was a set of essays.\" Was there a sub-primary published output? Is there a need to identify the set of essays as his primary published work during this period. Did he publish other works during this period that are not detailed in the article?\n\nProse. - \"in which the various arts such as music, song, dance, poetry, visual arts and stagecraft were unified.\" \"Such as\" implies that this is nto a complete list, though I get the felling that it is complete. Consider: \"in which he would unify music, song, dance, poetry, visual arts and stagecraft.\" or similar.\n\nProse. - \"frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse\". Recast as confusing/awkward prose. How could Wagner use traditional antisemitic abuse in writing? I think you mean that he \"exploited traditional antisemitic stereotypes\", or similar.\n\nConstruction. - \"the first of Wagner's writings to feature antisemitic views.[52] In this polemic Wagner argued\" I suggest that the chronology not be broken up with asides about antisemitism, which already has a sub-section. \"'Judaism in Music' (1850)[51] was the first of Wagner's writings to feature antisemitic views.[52]\" This thought should end there, and the following excess detail be moved to the anti-semitism section.\n\nRedundant/awkward construction. - \"In \"Opera and Drama\" (1851), Wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the Ring operas. Before leaving Dresden, Wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.\" Seems like these two sentences either need to be swapped or merged into one, as the first mentions the Ring operas and the second \"the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.\"\n\nProse. - \"revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept\" \"to agree with\" is awkward. Consider: \"for continuity with\" or similar.\n\nRedundant, jarring prose. - \"The concept of opera expressed in \"Opera and Drama\" and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written, up to and including Lohengrin.\" \"Opera/s\" is used three times within 17 words.\n\nEllipses. - \"Prelude (Vorspiel). ...

Perhaps Wagner was preoccupied with antisemitism, and correct me if I'm wrong about this, but TMK Wagner never actively engaged in antisemitic activities, so it would seem a recast along the lines of: \"reiterated Wagner's antisemitic views\" would improve the prose. Disagree.\n\nProse. - \"Wagner completed Parsifal in January 1882, and a second Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera\". Omit :new\", he had worked on the piece for years, or recast as \"newly completed\". or similar. Disagree.\n\nUnencyclopedic prose. - \"After the festival, the Wagner family journeyed to Venice for the winter\". 1) \"journeyed\" in not as encyclopedic in tone as \"traveled\" or similar, 2) \"journeyed to Venice for the winter\" is poor grammar. Consider: \"After the festival, Wagner traveled with his family to Venice, where he intended to remain during the winter\", or similar. Disagree.\n\nMissing article. - \"The legend that the attack was prompted by argument with Cosima\". Do you mean \"by argument\" or \"by an argument\"? Disagree.\n\nAsserting a negative. - \"The legend that the attack was prompted by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence.[131\" Is this necessary? Yes.\n\nParenthetical or note? - \"Franz Liszt's two piano pieces titled La lugubre gondola evoke the passing of a black-shrouded funerary gondola bearing Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal.[132]\" This is quite jarring and trivial in nature in its current placement within the text. This aside, which is really about List more than Wagner, should be moved to notes, or to a section detailing notable homage to Wagner. Disagree.\n\nOperas\n\nAwkward prose. - \"Wagner's operatic works are his primary artistic legacy\", consider: \"Wagner's primary artistic legacy are his operatic works.\"\n\nExcess, redundant parenthetical. - \"writing the libretto (the text and lyrics) to others\". Since libretto is linked here, there is no need for a parenthetical describing what a libretto is.\n\nScare quotes. - \"Wagner wrote his own libretti, which he referred to as 'poems'.[135]\" There is no need to enclose \"poems\" inside quotes here, unless of course, Wagner invented poetry, which of course he didn't.\n\nAwkward, excess prose. - \"From 1849 onwards\". Omit \"onwards\" as excessive and awkward.\n\nAwkward and confusing prose. \"he urged a new concept of opera\". This needs a recast. How did he urge a new concept? How could one even urge a concept? Perhaps he urged other composers to adopt his concept, but you cannot urge a concept. Consider: \"he advanced a new concept of opera\" or \"he promoted a new concept of opera\", or similar.\n\nVague, scare quote. - \"often referred to as 'music drama'\" 1) by whom, 2) more unnecessary scare quotes.\n\nProse. - \"Wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers.\" Consider: \"Wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestral music is equal to that of the vocal parts\", or similar.\n\nClarity. - \"The orchestra's dramatic role in the later operas\". I assume you mean to say: \"The orchestra's dramatic role in Wagner's later operas\", or similar.\n\nRedundancy. - \"often referred to as 'music drama' (although he later rejected this term)\" is closely followed by \"These operas are still, despite Wagner's reservations, referred to by many writers[139] as 'music dramas'.[140]\" just three sentences later.\n\nEarly works (to 1842)\n\nProse. - \"Wagner's earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted\". 1) \"attempts at opera\" is poor grammar. I think you mean to say: \"attempts at writing operas\", or similar. 2) \"were often\" is vague. Consider: \"Wagner's abandoned some of his earliest attempts at writing an opera, such as: ...\", or similar.\n\nMerge. - \"Abandoned works include ...\" merge this with the above topic sentence for improved flow.\n\nProse. - \"was unperformed in the composer's lifetime\" consider \"was never performed in the composer's lifetime\"\n\nAwkward prose. - \"Rienzi (1842) was Wagner's first opera to be successfully staged.[141]\" Consider: \"Wagner's first successfully staged opera was Rienzi (1842).[141]\" Though it seems to me that this is redundant with earlier text regarding Rienzi, or that on the first mention of the work it the article should have explicated this datum.\n\nLinking, jargon, clarity. - \"the clear influence of Meyerbeerean\". Will the casual reader understand what Meyerbeerean means?\n\nUnencyclopedic, fancrufty prose. - \"did not exhibit the innovations that would mark Wagner's place in musical history\". Consider: \"did not include the musical innovations later associated with Wagner\", or similar.\n\nExcess. \"Later in life, Wagner said\". Is \"Later in life\" necessary? Would \"later\" accomplish the same thing, because I think it goes without saying that Wagner's opinions originate from the period during which he was living.\n\nWordy, awkward prose. - \"they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years\". Wouldn't \"rarely performed during the last hundred years\" suffice?\n\nExcess vague parenthetical, awkward prose. - \"(although the overture to Rienzi is an occasional concert piece).\" Recast \"is an occasional concert piece\" as: \"is occasionally performed in concert\", or similar.\n\n\"Romantic operas\" (1843–51)\n\nClarity. - \"Wagner's middle stage output began with\". Throughout the article there are references to Wagner's \"stages\", but I don't see exactly were this is explicated. Did he only have a \"middle stage\", or was there an early and late stage as well? If so, where is the article is this made clear?\n\nVague scare quote. - Yet another, \"are sometimes referred to as Wagner's \"romantic operas\".[144]\"[according to whom?]\n\nWordy, vague prose. - \"They reinforced the reputation, amongst the public in Germany and beyond, that Wagner had begun to establish with Rienzi.\" 1) \"amongst the public in Germany and beyond\" is unencyclopedic and vague. What does \"beyond\" mean? Consider: \"They reinforced the reputation that Wagner had begun to establish with Rienzi.\"\n\nProse. - \"the mature operas that Cosima staged at the Bayreuth Festival\". As opposed to the immature operas Wagner presumably wrote for children? \"Mature operas\" is nebulous, please clarify its meaning.\n\nMisplaced modifier. - \"and have been frequently recorded\", recast as \"and have been recorded frequently\"\n\nUnencyclopedic, awkward prose. - \"They were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetime.\" Did the inanimate operas spread his \"fame\", which is not an encyclopedic term in this context.\n\nStarting the Ring\n\nProse. - \"Wagner's late dramas are considered his masterpieces.\"[according to whom?] Late dramas implies that there were early and middle dramas. Were there?\n\nProse. - \"commonly referred to as the Ring or \"Ring cycle\". Is there a missing article here? Would someone say: \"I went to see \"Ring Cycle\" tonight, it was fantastic\"? Consider: \"commonly referred to as the Ring or the 'Ring cycle'.\" Also, why is the Ring not in italics in the same sentence as \"Ring Cycle\"?\n\nMisplaced descriptor. - \"is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements\", consider: \"is a set of four operas loosely based on figures and elements ...\"\n\nExcess detail. - \"particularly from the later Norse mythology\". Is it necessary to denote \"later Norse mythology\" when \"Norse mythology\" will suffice. This excess detail is more suited to the topical articel dedicated to the work.\n\nExcess. \"Wagner specifically developed the libretti\". Omit \"specifically\" as excess.\n\nProse. - \"They were also influenced by Wagner's concepts of ancient Greek drama, in which tetralogies were a component of Athenian festivals, and which he had amply discussed in his essay \"Oper und Drama\".[151]\" 1) \"Wagner's concepts\" is not the best word choice. Consider: \"Wagner's interpretation\" or \"Wagner's understanding\" or \"Wagner's appreciation\", or similar. 2) \"amply discussed\" is awkward and unencyclopedic.\n\nIn-line attribution needed. - \"In Das Rheingold, with its 'relentlessly talky 'realism' [and] the absence of lyrical 'numbers'\",[152]\" This quote needs in-line attribution.\n\nUnencyclopedic adjective. - \"Wagner came very close\", avoid using the modifier, \"very\", in academic writing.\n\nUnencyclopedic prose. - \"with Siegmund's almost full-blown aria\". \"Almost full-blown\" is unencyclopedic prose.\n\nRedundant prose. \"appearance of the Valkyries themselves\". As with Graham Colm, I suggest you avoid \"themselves\" here for similar reasons given to avoid the unnecessary use of \"himself\" throughout the article.\n\nScare quotes. \"shows more 'operatic' traits\". These quotes are unnecessary.\n\nPunctuation. - \"and the quasi-choral appearance of the Valkyries themselves, shows more \"operatic\" traits\". Omit the comma after \"themselves\" as it is separating the subject from the predicate.\n\nContradiction. - According to Millington (quoted in the section): \"A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression.\"[153] This would seem to condradict the \"music as subsidiary to drama\" approach that the article implies Wagner preferred and sought to achieve.\n\nWordy sentence. - \"Die Walküre, with Siegmund's almost full-blown aria (Winterstürme) in the first act, and the quasi-choral appearance of the Valkyries themselves, shows more \"operatic\" traits, but has been assessed by Barry Millington as \"the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of 'Oper und Drama'... A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression.\"[153]\"\n\nTristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger\n\nUnnecessary modifier. - \"conceived by Wagner in 1845 as a sort of comic pendant to Tannhäuser\". Omit \"a sort of\".\n\nArchaic, misused term. - \"musico-dramatical\". \"musico-dramatic\" is a proper term, but dramatical an archaic word.\n\nConfusing. - \"his only mature comedy\", does the article properly and previously explicate the meaning of the term: \"mature comedy\"?\n\nConfusing, prose, jargon. - \"two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon.[154]\" As opposed to the irregular canon. What does this mean? Does \"regular operatic canon\" refer to Wagner, or to operas in general?\n\nProse. - \"Tristan is often granted a special place in musical history\". 1) \"a special place\" is not encyclopedic prose, 2) \"in musical history\". I think you mean to say: \"in music history\", otherwise it sounds like you are talking about the history of musicals.\n\nAwkward prose. - \"many see it as the beginning of the move away\"\n\nProse. - \"and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century\". \"consider that it lays\" needs a recast.\n\nAttribution. - \"with its use of 'the art of transition' between\". You are quoting someone here but it is not at all clear who.\n\nVerbose. - \"Completed in 1859, the work was given its first performance in Munich\". Consider: \"Completed in 1859, the work was first performed in Munich\", or similar. How can one give a \"work\" a performance?\n\nCompletely normal phrasing. Johnbod (talk)\n\nSee [4]. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nOr more precisely [5]. Johnbod (talk)\n\nConfusing. - What's a \"comic pendant\"?\n\nUnencyclopedic prose. - \"under the baton of Bülow\". Consider: \"conducted by Bülow\" so as to avoid the journalese-esque: \"under the baton\" text string.\n\nProse. - \"it is also held up by some\". Avoid \"held up by some\" as unencyclopedic. Consider: \"regarded by some\", or similar.\n\nCompleting the Ring\n\nWordy sentence. - \"When Wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of Siegfried and for Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods), as the final part of the Ring was eventually called, his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as \"operatic\" than the aural world of Rheingold and Walküre, though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs.[161]\"\n\nScare quotes, prose. - \"more recognisable as 'operatic' than the aural world of Rheingold and Walküre\". 1) Why is \"operatic\" in quotes? 2) what is an \"aural world\".\n\nConfusing. - Waht does \"the book for Götterdämmerung\" mean?\n\nScare quotes. - \"conceived more 'traditionally' than\". Why is \"traditionally\" in quotes?\n\nProse. - \"the self-imposed strictures of the Gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed\". I assume you mean to say that Wagner relaxed the strictures, which is better than impling that they had become relaxed by some unknown force.\n\nAwkward prose. - \"The differences also result\". Perhaps \"resulted\" would be better here.\n\nVerbose. - \"The differences also result from Wagner's development as a composer during the period in which he wrote Tristan, Meistersinger and the Paris version of Tannhäuser.[163]\" Consider: \"The differences also resulted from Wagner's development as a composer while writing Tristan, Meistersinger and the Paris version of Tannhäuser.[163]\" Also, is there a \"Paris version\" of Tannhäuser, or was Tannhäuser rewritten in Paris. Are there two extant versions?\n\nConsistency. - \"From act 3 of Siegfried onwards\" is closely preceeded by: \"the third part of the Ring cycle\". There seems to be numerous inconsistencies regarding the rendering of numerals, sometimes as digits and sometimes as prose.\n\nVerbose prose. - \"Wagner took 26 years from writing the first draft of a libretto in 1848 until he completed Götterdämmerung in 1874.\" Consider: \"From 1848, Wagner spent 26 years writing Götterdämmerung, which he completed in 1874.\"\n\nThat would be misleading, as he did not work continuously on it. Johnbod (talk)\n\nTrue, but then how about: \"From 1848, Wagner sporadically worked on Götterdämmerung, which he completed in 1874\"? GabeMc (talk|contribs)\n\nThis: \"Following the first Bayreuth Festival, Wagner began work on Parsifal, his final opera. The composition took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons[121]\" (from \"Last years (1876–83)\"), sounds to me like he worked on Parsifal contin"
