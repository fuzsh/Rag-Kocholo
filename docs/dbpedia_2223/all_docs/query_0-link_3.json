        "text": "Wikimedia subject-area collaboration\n\nThis is a project to better organize information in the articles related to the composer Richard Wagner, his life and his operas. The project is intended to complete or add new articles within its 'scope' described below. It is hoped that this project, and the discussions here, will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians. For future reference, you can easily reach this page via the shortcut WP:Wagner.\n\nTo find out more about what we have been doing, see Scope and Articles below. If you would like to help, consider looking at the To do lists below, including clean-up tasks and new article opportunities below. You could also adopt an article. Feel free to add additional tasks or articles to these lists.\n\nIf you would like to join us, please add your name to the list of participants.\n\nThe scope of this project is:\n\nRichard Wagner and members of the Wagner Family\n\nThe fourteen Wagner operas, or Music Dramas, recordings of them and discographies\n\nEssays and other literary works of Wagner\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival\n\nPeople who worked with or were influenced by Richard Wagner\n\nSources of Wagner information or scholarship\n\nThis project was started by Dogbertd in May 2007.\n\nTo increase the accuracy, clarity, coverage and overall quality of articles related to Richard Wagner, his works, his life, his colleagues and his influence.\n\nWikiProject Opera (parent project)\n\nWikiProject Composers\n\nChrisdevelop (talk · contribs)\n\nSjones23 (talk · contribs)\n\nIf you are inactive for a period of more than two months, your name may be transferred to the list below.

See WP:WPO#Templates for examples of article structure and WP:WPO#Guidelines for guidance on article style.\n\nLohengrin lacks sections on premiere and critical reception. Some of this information is available on the DE wiki page.\n\nFeel free to add an article on any relevant topic, as long as it is encyclopedic, adopts a neutral point of view, and is verifiable. Normally the best way to ensure verifiability and neutrality is to cite sources, rather than relying on what you merely believe to be true. Some participants also believe that articles should be \"notable\". See WP:MUS WP:BIO and WP:ORG. Below are suggestions for new articles that are needed to round out the Wagner coverage on Wikipedia.\n\nThere are major singers who lack articles. A subpage provides a full List of Wagner singers, with and without published articles.\n\nWould you like to adopt an article? This would involve doing the research, writing, and finding public domain images to create or improve an article. Just pick an article from one of the \"To do\" lists above and start editing (see \"clean-up tasks\" and \"new article opportunities\" above). Of course, anyone can edit any article, even if someone had \"adopted\" it. But the idea of adopting an article is to focus for a while on a particular article until you feel it is as completely researched and referenced, and as well-written as you can make it, with a view of building up the number of high quality articles relating to this project. When you are finished working on an adopted article, leave a message on the talk page to let the other members of the project know you are finished, and they can look it over.\n\nIn general, this project follows the Opera Project category system as explained on their project page.\n\nThere are however six specific Wagner categories: Category:Richard Wagner • Category:Wagner studies • Category:Wagner family • Category:Operas by Richard Wagner • Category:Compositions by Richard Wagner •Category:Essays by Richard Wagner\n\nWe have an official project talk page banner indicating the involvement of the project. The coding is {{WikiProject Richard Wagner}}. This is displayed on all articles (28 in July 2007) in the Wagner categories (see above). The banner is set up to include assessment ratings.\n\nThere is a template for Richard Wagner at Template:Richard_Wagner. This can be added to project pages using the code {{Richard Wagner}}.--Dogbertd (talk)\n\nWikiproject Watchlist - WikiProject Richard Wagner"
