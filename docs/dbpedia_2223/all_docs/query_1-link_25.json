        "text": "Post by Bronze Age Brian on\n\n“Grendel’s existence is lamentable. He burned with a potency that rarely emerges in society… He is the demon of society’s mediocrity.” - Matt Wagner\n\nThis is a series of reviews that will focus solely on the Hunter Rose version of the character known as Grendel.\n\nGrendel/Hunter Rose FAQ\n\nWho is Hunter Rose?\n\nA famous author and expert fencer who moonlighted as the ruthless assassin Grendel for fun and excitement.\n\nWhich Grendel comics will this be covering?\n\nHunter Rose appears in the following:\n\nComico Primer #2 (1983)\n\nGrendel (Mini-series) #1-3 (1983)\n\nMage: The Hero Discovered #6-15 (1985) aka Devil By The Deed\n\nGrendel: Devil's Vagary (1987)\n\nBatman Grendel I (1993)\n\nGrendel: Black, White & Red #1-4 (1998)\n\nGrendel: Red, White & Black #1-4 (2002)\n\nGrendel: Behold The Devil #0-9 (2007)\n\nCBLDF Presents Liberty Annual 2011 #1 - Sympathy From The Devil\n\nGrendel vs. The Shadow #1-3 (2014)\n\nWeren't there other Grendels? Why just Hunter Rose?\n\nYes there are several other Grendels. After Rose's death, many others would become new incarnations of Grendel, but I don't plan to review them at this time. Hunter Rose is the original Grendel and my favorite iteration of the character.\n\nWho are the other Grendels, and where do they appear?\n\nStacy Palumbo: Devil Child #1-2\n\nChristine Spar, daughter of Stacy Palumbo (and Rose's adopted daughter): Grendel (1st series) #1-12 - aka Devil's Legacy\n\nBrian Li Sung: Grendel (1st series) #13-15 aka The Devil Inside\n\nEppy Thatcher: Grendel (1st series) #24-33 aka God and the Devil\n\nOrion Assante: Grendel (1st series) #34-40 aka Devil's Reign\n\nGrendel Prime: Grendel War Child #1-10, Devil Quest, Batman Grendel II, Grendel Past Prime\n\nPetrus Christus: Grendel Tales - The Devil's Hammer #1-3\n\nJonah: Grendel Tales - The Devil In Our Midst #1-5\n\nDrago: Grendel Tales - Devils and Deaths #1-2\n\nGoran: Grendel Tales - Devil's Choices #1-4\n\nThe Grendel Gang - Grendel Tales - The Devil May Care #1-5\n\nAaron Crow: Grendel Tales - The Devil's Apprentice #1-3\n\nOther:\n\nCaptain Wiggins tells tales about Hunter Rose's Grendel: Grendel (1st series) #16-19\n\nThe Incubation Years: Grendel (1st series) #20-23\n\nThe Skull of Hunter Rose/Grendel Clans/Four Grendels: Grendel Tales - Four Devils, One Hell #1-6\n\nConfused yet? That is one heck of a lot of Grendels coming at you. I may have missed one or two, but there you have it. Now on to the Hunter Rose era reviews!\n\nWarning: Grendel comics are violent in nature and while these reviews won't be too image heavy, they will reveal some mature content and therefore caution is required.\n\nAny questions or comments are appreciated. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nPost by Bronze Age Brian on\n\nComico Primer #2 (Jan, 1983)\n\nSynopsis: The story begins in a 10-page feature in the second issue of Comico Primer. Hunter Rose calls up his arch-nemesis Argent and tells him that he intends to kill City Council Chairman Everett Christie that evening at a Gala event. Argent vows to stop Grendel as he hangs up the phone. Sure enough, later that evening Grendel appears, and corners Christie in his study. With Grendel's deadly, two-pronged electric fork pointed precariously at Christie's throat, he reveals that Christie is in fact the head of the largest prostitution ring in the city, one that has been using underage girls. Christie promises to stop with the young girls but that is not enough for Grendel as he thrusts his fork straight into Christie's throat.\n\nGrendel takes Christie's files, and as he leaves the scene of the crime with his associates, the werewolf Argent appears. Argent uses his brute strength to dispatch Grendel's associates, and the two endure a brief skirmish. Argent takes some shots at Grendel, but Grendel's agility proves to be highly skilled as he is able to stab the fork into Argent's back and escapes.\n\nComments: Hunter Rose is swimming in his own ego, so overconfident in his plight that he brazenly calls up his arch-nemesis to inform him of a crime he intends to commit, and then simply commits it. We get the first look at Grendel's iconic mask. When he kills Christie, he is only wearing the mask along with a suit and tie, which exudes assertiveness (with a dash of laziness) in that he won't need his full costume because his target will simply be dead. This is the first of many times we'll see Grendel this way. We are also introduced to Grendel's weapon the electric fork, which protrudes out of Rose's walking stick with the push of a button. This is a unique weapon that Grendel uses with deadly precision.\n\nAlthough Argent shows up late to the party, he seems fulfilled by the end of his encounter with Grendel. The fact that he was able to take out a few of Grendel's thugs pleases him. Argent is indeed a werewolf, an unusual choice for a hero in this story. There's an interesting duality happening in the relationship between these two, one that will be revealed later on. A lot of questions are yet to be answered.\n\nI enjoyed Matt Wagner's early manga-styled artwork, and although quite amateur at this point, he is able to make the story intriguing with satisfying action sequences. His writing still needed some work, and there were a few misspelled words, etc. But this is where it all began. More to come in Grendel #1 soon."
