        "text": "Dear Readers, please click here to go to the more recent update of this story, based on the 2015 Forbes 400. Thanks.\n\n***\n\nCongratulations Texas -- this year the Lone Star State can boast 41 slots on the Forbes 400. That's more than any other state except California and New York. These rich listers are concentrated in our two biggest metro areas, with 22 in Dallas/Fort Worth versus just 12 here in Houston.\n\nMissing from the list this year are such veteran Forbes 400 members as Red McCombs ($1.25 billion) and T. Boone Pickens ($950 million). Also gone is natural gas pioneer George Mitchell, who passed away this year.\n\nUpon learning that he'd missed the Forbes 400 cut (mostly due to soured investments in wind farms), T. Boone took it well. He tweeted: \"Don't worry. At $950 million, I'm doing fine. Funny, my $1 billion charitable giving exceeds my net worth.\"\n\nAs if we needed any confirmation that Texas is far more than just an oil and gas state, only half of these richest Texans owe their fortunes to Texas Tea.\n\nMy Forbes colleagues and I are always on the hunt for new billionaires to celebrate, in Texas and all over. If you have some suspects we should look into drop me a line at chelman@forbes.com. (Come on Houston, let's beat Dallas next year.)\n\n1. Alice Walton\n\n$33.5 billion\n\nFort Worth\n\nWal-Mart heiress Alice Walton's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art -- which she founded in 2011 -- has eclipsed 1 million visitors in under two years of operation. Not bad for the small-town Bentonville, Ark., museum, which includes works spanning five centuries from icons like Andy Warhol, Norman Rockwell and Georgia O'Keeffe. Some pieces she donated from her personal collection (which is valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars). As the biggest philanthropist of the Walton family, Alice gave more than $2 million in 2012 to support charter school initiatives. She and her siblings have also donated about $2 billion to the Walton Family Foundation over the last five years. Daughter of retail visionary Sam (d. 1992), Alice graduated from Trinity College in San Antonio, Tex., and now spends most of her time on the Rocking W Ranch in Milsap, outside of Fort Worth. Since last year, she received more than $350 million in Wal-Mart dividends after taxes. (Forbes reporter Clare O'Connor just got an exclusive look inside her world.)\n\n2. Michael Dell\n\n$15.9 billion\n\nAustin\n\nAfter months locked in battle with activist investor Carl Icahn, PC entrepreneur Michael Dell won shareholder approval of his final $24.9 billion offer to take his eponymous company private in what will be the biggest leveraged buy-out in recent years. The Texan, who started the PC maker in his dorm room 29 years ago and remains Chairman and CEO, believes pulling out of the public markets will help Dell shift from a struggling personal computer business into a business software giant. Today the bulk of Dell's own fortune is tied up in his investment firm MSD Capital; its $12 billion portfolio includes banking, property, dental practices and landscaping companies. On the charitable front, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation has committed more than $900 million to eradicating urban poverty and improving child health. In January 2013, the foundation said it will donate $50 million to the University of Texas to build its new medical school, which will be named after Dell.\n\n3. Richard Kinder\n\n$10.2 billion\n\nHouston\n\nKinder Morgan Energy Partners is thriving and expanding amid the rising demand for natural gas - and throwing off fat payouts. The company, co-founded and run by Kinder, owns 82,000 miles of pipelines and 180 storage terminals. In 2012 it acquired El Paso Corp. for some $38 billion and in May 2013 purchased Copano Energy for $5 billion. His net worth is up $800 million from a year ago due to an uptick in Kinder Morgan's share price (he owns a 23% stake) and combined quarterly payouts worth more than $200 million. After quitting as Enron president in 1996, the Texan founded what is now the largest U.S. pipeline company with friend William Morgan a year later. A former Army captain, Kinder earned both bachelor and law degrees from the University of Missouri. His Kinder Foundation has $75 million in assets and funds education and quality of life in Houston. Kinder chairs the board of Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. (Last year we did this big story on Kinder's grand plan to capitalize on the American Oil & Gas Boom.)\n\n4. Harold Simmons\n\n$10 billion\n\nDallas\n\nBuyout investor Simmons sold his Titanium Metals in January, pocketing more than $1 billion. More recently his Contran took fabricated wire product maker Keystone Consolidated Industries private. Most of his money is held in publicly traded conglomerate Valhi. A big backer of conservative causes, Simmons gave more than $25 million to Republican super PACs during the 2012 presidential election. He started as a bank examiner and bought drugstore with $5,000 cash and $95,000 loan. A decade later, he sold his business to Eckerd Corporation for $50 million in 1973. The University of Texas graduate has given $177 million to date to UT Southwestern and established the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. A certified pilot, Simmons enjoys watching the NFL's Dallas Cowboys with team owner and fellow Dallas resident Jerry Jones.\n\n5. Andrew Beal\n\n$9.8 billion\n\nDallas\n\nBanker Andrew Beal built a fortune buying distressed assets. In the 2009 financial crisis he bought bonds backed by commercial planes, IOUs to power plants. His net worth has climbed over past year as profits at Beal Bank in Texas doubled, and he's been on a crusade this year to get big banks to buy back billions in bad loans they sold during the housing boom. College dropout opened first branch of Beal Bank in Texas in 1988 and added Nevada-based bank years later. A numbers wizard, Beal is a legendary poker player who once walked into a Las Vegas casino and challenged some of the best poker players in the world to some of the highest-stakes games ever played. He has offered $1 million to solve complex math equation, the Beal Conjecture number theory problem, which has stumped mathematicians for decades.\n\n6. Charles Butt & Family\n\n$8.5 billion\n\nSan Antonio\n\nCharles Butt is the chairman and CEO of H.E. Butt Grocery of Texas, founded by his grandmother in 1905. Started as a bag boy at age 8. Revenues estimated at $18.7 billion in 2012, up 8%. The company ranked 12th on FORBES' 2012 list of America's Largest Private Companies. It has 311 stores in Texas, where its Central Market stores compete with Whole Foods, and 47 stores in Mexico. Butt is majority shareholder; 2 siblings and 2 nephews own stakes in company as well.\n\n7. Elaine Marshall & Family\n\n$8.3 billion\n\nDallas\n\nElaine Marshall, 71, holds an estimated 15% of conglomerate Koch Industries (controlled by Charles and David Koch, the world's richest brothers) in trusts for her, 2 sons (Preston and Everett) and other relatives. She inherited it from her husband E. Pierce Marshall (d. 2006), son of J. Howard Marshall II, who got the Koch stake by investing in a refinery business that was acquired by Koch Industries. Marshall family is battling IRS over some $75 million in taxes dating from J. Howard's financial maneuvers before his death in 1995. In May a federal judge said he'll order the family to pay up to $49 million to Dannielynn Smith, the daughter of Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith (d. 2007) and J. Howard. The judge was not impressed with tactics used by E. Pierce in an attempt to cut Smith out of his father's estate.\n\n8. Ray Lee Hunt\n\n$5.6 billion\n\nDallas\n\nTerrorist attacks have impaired the value of Hunt Oil's stake in a liquefied natural gas project in Yemen, but Hunt's similar LNG project in Peru is going well. You need a big balance sheet to invest in LNG. That's something Ray Lee Hunt, son of legendary wildcatter H.L. Hunt, has been building for 40 years. Hunt Consolidated owns hotels and real estate around Dallas (including the iconic Reunion Tower), 400,000 acres of ranches across the West, and oil and gas fields worldwide (including a big find in Iraqi Kurdistan). In 2011 he sold a one-third stake in Hunt Oil's Eagle Ford shale fields to Japan's Marubeni for $1.3 billion. Hunt also raised $600 million from banks that year to build a high-voltage power line in Texas. Torch passing is underway: son Hunter Hunt, the second of his five children, is now chief executive of Hunt Consolidated Energy; Ray, 70, remains chairman and CEO of Hunt Consolidated.\n\n9. Dannine Avara\n\n$5.5 billion\n\nHouston\n\nDannine Avara, 49, daughter of the late Dan Duncan, saw her fortune grow $800 million since our last Forbes 400 issue thanks to generous payouts and jump in value of Enterprise Product's shares. In 1968, her father founded the pipeline empire that now owns nearly 51,000 miles of natural gas, oil and petrochemical pipelines as well as 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. Duncan, formerly the richest man in Houston, died in 2010 at 77. Avara's sister Randa Duncan Williams was recently elected as non-executive Chairman of the Board. Two other siblings, Scott Duncan and Milane Frantz, are also members of the Forbes 400.\n\n10. Scott Duncan\n\n$5.5 billion\n\nHouston\n\nScott Duncan is one of four siblings who are heirs to the energy-pipeline fortune built by their late father Dan Duncan. The private 30-year-old is reportedly single and is $800 million richer than a year ago thanks to a rise in the stock price of Enterprise Products Partners and a generous dividend plan. His father, Dan Duncan, formerly the richest man in Houston, died in 2010 at age 77. Dan grew up poor and formed Enterprise Products with two trucks in 1968, selling door to door. Scott's sister Randa Duncan Williams is the non-executive Chairman of the Board.\n\n11. Milane Frantz\n\n$5.5 billion\n\nHouston\n\nMilane Frantz, 44, is one of four siblings who are heirs to their late father Dan Duncan's energy pipeline empire. Frantz sits on the board of the Hermann Park Conservancy in Houston and the Baylor College of Medicine Board of Trustees\n\n12. Randa Williams\n\n$5.5 billion\n\nHouston\n\nRanda Duncan Williams, 52, is the eldest of four children of the late pipeline entrepreneur Dan Duncan. She was elected in February as non-executive Chairman of the Board of energy pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners, founded by her father. Williams is the most publicly active of her siblings. Williams is involved in a number of Houston-based charities including the Ballet Foundation, Manned Spaceflight Education Foundation, the Museum of Natural Science and the Girl Scouts.\n\n13. Jeffery Hildebrand\n\n$5.5 billion\n\nHouston\n\nAfter 10 years of building Hilcorp into one of the world's biggest privately owned oil companies, Jeff Hildebrand dared to branch out this year -- by opening a donut shop near his home in Houston's tony River Oaks. The 54-year-old founder of Hilcorp Energy reportedly refused to open the shop until he was convinced they had the best donuts in town (they are pretty good). Back in the oilfields, Hilcorp is busy investing hundreds of millions a year in Alaska's Cook Inlet. He's also big in the Utica shale of Ohio and the Gulf Coast region. In 2012 Hilcorp sold its Gulf of Mexico fields for $550 million. Hildebrand's biggest payday came in 2011, when he turned a $100 million investment in the Eagle Ford shale into $1.4 billion with a sale to Marathon Oil. Hildebrand left a petroleum engineering job at ExxonMobil in 1989 and joined with partners to start buying up proven oilfields that were too small for the supermajors -- then applying new technology to squeeze out profits. He bought out partner Thomas Hook for $500 million in 2003. In 2010, as a reward for doubling the size of the company, every Hilcorp employee got $50,000 to buy a new car. For the next doubling, expected in 2015, the bonus will be $100,000. A horse-lover, Hildebrand has built a polo field on his ranch in Aspen. Gov. Rick Perry appointed Hildebrand a regent of the University of Texas earlier this year; he serves on the boards of the Greater Houston Community Foundation, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.\n\n14. Robert Rowling\n\n$4.9 billion\n\nDallas\n\nFather Reese made a fortune in oil and gas with Tana Petroleum. Robert teamed with Dad to form TRT Holdings when they sold most of their assets to Texaco (now Chevron) for $500 million in 1989. Robert, 59, has diversified mightily. He owns Omni Hotels, growing fast with nearly 20,000 rooms at 60 locations. Completed renovations at Amelia Island resort in Florida this year, building another in Nashville, and bought five more resorts for $1.1 billion. Omni is the largest hotel chain not to offer in-room adult movies. Rowling also owns the Golds Gym chain. Big donor to Karl Rove's American Crossroads SuperPAC.\n\n15. Trevor Rees-Jones\n\n$4.4 billion\n\nDallas\n\nA year ago the Mississippi Limestone play of Kansas and Oklahoma looked like the big new thing. Trevor Rees-Jones and partners had leased 800,000 acres there. But the so-called \"Miss Lime\" didn't pan out as hoped. There's oil there, but the geology is too tricky to justify going after it -- contributing to Rees-Jones' slightly lower net worth this year. Not to worry. The one-time bankruptcy attorney turned shale-gas legend is now staffing up in the Marcellus shale gas for the third time. His Chief Oil & Gas was an early investor and early seller (2008) in the Barnett shale gas play in Texas, netting more than $1.5 billion. He plowed cash into the Marcellus and made $2 billion selling acreage there to the likes of Chevron and Enerplus, and another $1 billion dealing his Marcellus pipeline network to Penn-Virginia in 2012. Through Providence Minerals, acquired in 2006, he controls millions of oil-and-gas acres across the country including many with new shale discoveries. In 2010 he donated $25 million to the Boy Scouts of America and in 2011 gave another $25 million to the new Perot Museum of Nature & Science in Dallas. Big backer of Karl Rove's American Crossroads SuperPAC.\n\n16. John Paul DeJoria\n\n$4 billion\n\nAustin\n\nShampoo and tequila entrepreneur John Paul DeJoria is going prime-time. This fall he'll appear as a judge on ABC's entrepreneur pitch show \"Shark Tank.\" Don't expect to see the laid-back billionaire take a bite out of contestants: \"They're calling me the dolphin,\" DeJoria says. Raised in rough East Los Angeles, DeJoria, 69, joined the Navy before starting hair-care outfit John Paul Mitchell Systems with Paul Mitchell in 1980 with $700. At first DeJoria lived in his car and hawked products door-to-door in Los Angeles; annual sales now near $1 billion. In 1989 he created tequila distiller Patron Spirits as a hobby with Martin Crowley (d. 2003). Hollywood friends helped make $50 bottles of tequila a must at hot restaurants and nightclubs. Today the company sells more than 2 million cases a year. DeJoria's philanthropy includes teaching people how to farm their own food through his charity, GrowAppalachia. Other causes: Food4Africa, Mineseekers, Blazer House.\n\n17. H. Ross Perot\n\n$3.5 billion\n\nDallas\n\nMost know Ross Perot as a two-time candidate for president, but that adventure was at the end of a long and colorful career. This son of a cotton broker from Texarkana met an IBM tech while in the Navy, became a salesman at Big Blue, then quit when they wouldn't give him more computers to sell after he hit his annual quota by March. In 1962 he founded Electronic Data Systems and ushered in the computer age building government and corporate I.T. systems. Perot made $1.5 billion selling EDS to G.M., then turned around and created Perot Systems. Dell bought that company for $3.9 billion in 2009. All the while Perot was dedicated to the plight of POW/MIAs, repeatedly traveling to Vietnam during the war. In 1978 he recruited military vets on a mission to rescue two EDS employees imprisoned in Iran -- a saga recounted in Ken Follett's \"On Wings of Eagles.\" A few years ago a U.S. special forces team presented Perot with a walking stick. Recovered from Tora Bora, Afghanistan in the days following 9-11, it is said to have belonged to Osama Bin Laden. Perot still comes to the office everyday in suit and tie, often helping Dell's sales team close a deal. \"The world wants things done, not excuses,\" he tells Forbes. \"One thing done well is worth a million good excuses.\" (Check out my recent cover story on the Perots' expanding empire.)\n\n18. Kelcy Warren\n\n$3.4 billion\n\nDallas\n\nKelcy Warren, 58, cofounded natural-gas pipeline firm Energy Transfer Partners with Ray C. Davis in 1995; bought struggling gas assets and linked them into efficient system. Today its parent, Energy Transfer Equity, owns more than 71,000 miles of natural gas and crude oil pipelines. ETE bought Southern Union pipeline company for more than $5 billion, and bought Sunoco and its gas stations for $5.3 billion, both in 2012. Warren, a music fan, produces albums for singer-songwriters at his Austin-based studio, Music Road Records.\n\n19. Jerry Jones\n\n$3 billion\n\nDallas\n\nIn July 2013, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones struck an estimated $500 million, 25-year naming rights deal with AT&T for his massive 100,000-seat stadium. The move was just the latest Jones, 71, has masterminded to turn America's most valuable sports franchise ($2.3 billion) into a cash machine. The Cowboys produced league-high figures in both revenue ($539 million) and operating income ($251 million) last season, despite recent lackluster performance on the field. Jones has funneled his Cowboys dough into retail and residential real estate developments around Dallas, generating further return on his investments. He also owns oil and gas wells, which is where he made his first fortune in the 1970s, before buying the Cowboys for $150 million in 1989. A big Salvation Army supporter, he has used the Cowboys' well-known Thanksgiving halftime show to raise $1.6 billion for the charity over the past 15 years.\n\n20. W. Herbert Hunt\n\n$3 billion\n\nDallas\n\nIn the 1970s William Herbert Hunt and his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt acquired 195 million ounces of silver, worth nearly $10 billion at the peak. When the price of silver collapsed 80% in 1980 the Hunts were shunted off the Forbes 400 and into bankruptcy. But the 84-year-old son of famed wildcatter H.L. Hunt, inspiration of J.R. Ewing and half-brother of fellow list member Ray Lee Hunt, has stuck it out in the oil business. Last October his Petro-Hunt sold a big chunk of its acreage in the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota to Halcon Resources for $1.5 billion in cash and stock. The company, overseen by sons Bruce and Doug, maintains oil and gas holdings across the country as well as a refinery in Baton Rouge.\n\n21. John Arnold\n\n$2.8 billion\n\nHouston\n\nJohn Arnold shocked the hedge fund world in May of 2012 when he announced that he was calling it a career at age 38. \"After seventeen years as an energy trader, I feel that it's time to pursue other interests,\" wrote the former Enron star, who is said to have made $750 million for the defunct energy giant in 2001 alone. Arnold and his wife Laura, who are signatories of the Giving Pledge, have since devoted most of their time to philanthropy, specifically their $1.4 billion Laura and John Arnold Foundation. In August of 2012, the couple, who have already given away more than $1.2 billion, launched the Giving Library, a collection of videos featuring 250 charities, to help philanthropists learn about the nonprofits.\n\n22. Robert Bass\n\n$2.8 billion\n\nFort Worth (and New York)\n\nRobert and his brothers inherited a fortune from their oil tycoon uncle Sid Richardson four decades ago and have been building on it ever since, working with investing talent from the likes of Richard Rainwater and David Bonderman. Robert is thought to be the most successful of the brothers; in the early 1990s he founded investment company Oak Hill, which has since grown into four separate operations with total assets under management in excess of $35 billion. Robert, 65, is also chairman of private jet start-up Aerion, which seeks to build the first supersonic business jet. In 2012 he acquired a massive pad in Manhattan's 834 Fifth Avenue for a reported $42 million. This year, with wife Anne, he donated $50 million to Duke University to support interdisciplinary studies aimed at tackling complex societal problems.\n\n23. David Bonderman\n\n$2.6 billion\n\nFort Worth\n\nDavid Bonderman's TPG Capital, which has $55 billion assets under management, is exiting department store chain Neiman Marcus. Alongside other investors, they're selling Neimans for $6 billion, $900 million more than what they paid in 2005. The dealmaker (now 71) attended U. of Washington, then Harvard Law and became a civil rights attorney for Department of Justice. He later studied Islamic law in Cairo. \"Bondo\" met James Coulter (see) while working for Robert Bass (see). The pair left to found TPG and pursue their first deal together: they invested $66 million in faltering Continental Airlines; ultimately made $640 million profit. Other profitable exits include Burger King and J. Crew. Together the two, who met working for Robert Bass (see), own at least half of TPG, which sold 4.5% stake in itself in deal that valued firm at $5 billion 2 years ago.\n\n24. Richard Rainwater\n\n$2.6 billion\n\nFort Worth\n\nRichard Rainwater has been battling a rare neurodegenerative disease since 2009. The legendary Fort Worth dealmaker has been a friend and mentor to tycoons like Eddie Lampert, David Bonderman, Ken Hersh and the Bass brothers, but his struggle with progressive supranuclear palsy has limited his investment capacity. Often mistaken for Parkinson's disease, Rainwater's ailment strikes just 6 people in 100,000. Seeking a cure, Rainwater's family, through the Rainwater Charitable Foundation, has organized and funded a genius-filled group of researchers dubbed the Tau Consortium. Any advance is unlikely to help Rainwater, 69, but could lead to future breakthroughs in treating dementia. In happier news, Rainwater's wife, Darla Moore, a legendary investment banker in her own right, was one of the first two women admitted last summer as members at Augusta National Golf Club. (Condoleezza Rice was the other.) A new business school in her name is under construction and set to open at the University of South Carolina in 2014.\n\n25. Mark Cuban\n\n$2.5 billion\n\nDallas\n\nSerial entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has been known in recent years for his vocal criticisms of NBA refs, the U.S. Patent system, and Donald Trump, but he's remained active in his business ventures as well. In August 2013 NGL Energy Partners purchased the water disposal and hauling business of Oilfield Water Lines LP, in which Cuban was a majority stakeholder, for about $240 million. In December 2012, he donated $250,000 to the Electronic Frontier Foundation to, as he said, \"eliminate stupid patents\" and assist with their legal efforts to reform the patent system. His net worth increased $200 million over the past year mostly as a result of the new NBA collective bargaining agreement, which boosted the net value of his 90% stake in the Mavericks by $170 million, to nearly $440 million. Cuban, now 55, originally struck dot-com gold with business partner Todd Wagner in 1999, when they sold audio and video portal Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion. In subsequent years, he and Wagner have joined forces on ventures including AXS TV (formerly HDNet), Landmark Theaters, and movie maker Magnolia Pictures.\n\n26. Timothy Headington\n\n$2.5 billion\n\nDallas\n\nHe made his fortune in the oil business, but Tim Headington's real love is moviemaking. After fully bankrolling the expensive but Academy Award-winning \"Hugo\" and \"Rango,\" Headington, 63, found big success last year with smaller stakes in Best Picture \"Argo\" and Brad Pitt's \"World War Z.\" Though referred to in the society columns as Dallas' \"invisible billionaire,\" Headington is completing a lavish expansion of his boutique hotel the Joule. He also sold a condo in Miami for $25 million and one in Dallas for $10 million. Inspired by his geologist father, Tim Headington founded Headington Oil in 1978. He stayed under the radar until 2008 when he sold acreage in North Dakota's Bakken oil play to XTO Energy for $1.85 billion. Nowadays Headington Oil is investing big in south Texas -- but in conventional oilfields, not shale plays. After Oklahoma University, Headington earned graduate degrees in theology and psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary. His nascent Headington Institute aims to give psychological training to humanitarian relief workers worldwide. (Check out my Q&A with Headington.)\n\n27. Dan Friedkin\n\n$2.5 billion\n\nHouston\n\nDan Friedkin is owner and chairman of Gulf States Toyota, joining the 400 list for the first time after completing transfer of assets from father, Thomas Friedkin. He has been intimately involved for the past two decades in growing their company, an auto distributorship that has the exclusive rights to import and distribute Toyota vehicles in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma. It's the largest private business in Houston. He and his father, founder and chairman emeritus of the company, have had a hand in the processing and distribution of every Toyota sold in these states since 1968, profiting through the sale of cars as well as car parts. The unique and highly lucrative business -- $7 billion in revenues in 2012 -- is one of only two remaining independent Toyota distributors in the U.S. Friedkin also owns and oversees a host of automotive investments, including two Lexus dealerships in Houston. Dan, 48, recently assumed the ownership mantle from his father. Business acumen isn't the only thing Dan inherited. Both Friedkins share a passion for restoring and flying vintage military war plans and own together one of the largest such fleets in the country, frequently flying in commemorative events to honor those in the armed services. Tom was a former Hollywood stunt pilot and actor, with credits in 11 movies. Through family-owned luxury travel and safari operators and the Friedkin Conservation Fund -- a charitable organization established by the family to conserve the habitat and wildlife in over seven million acres of Tanzania -- the Friedkins have also contributed over $100 million to support wildlife conservation and anti-poaching efforts in East Africa. Dan is also actively engaged in environmental stewardship in his home state of Texas, where he serves as chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission.\n\n28. Tillman Fertitta\n\n$2.4 billion\n\nHouston\n\nThe entrepreneur of \"eatertainment.\" Tilman Fertitta, 56, was a partner in the first Landry's restaurant in 1980 and bought controlling interest in the company 1986. In 2010 he took Landry's private in deal worth $1.4 billion. In June Landry's purchased the 11-unit steak and seafood chain Mastro's Restaurants of California for an undisclosed price. In February, he offered $22 a share to acquire Ark Restaurants, only to have his proposal rejected by Ark's board of directors. In addition to restaurants, Landry's owns the Golden Nugget casinos, Houston's Kemah Boardwalk, Tower of the Americas in San Antonio and San Luis Resort in Galveston, Tex. Altogether Landry's has 63 brands--including Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., Morton's Steakhouse and Rainforest Cafe--with total 500 locations. A college dropout, he serves on the board of regents for the University of Houston system.\n\n29. Rodney Lewis\n\n$2.4 billion\n\nSan Antonio\n\nThe San Antonio natural gas tycoon's fortune comes from his wells on 500,000 acres of south Texas, much of it smack dab in the heart of the Eagle Ford shale. But his passion has always been airplanes. The son of an Air Force pilot, he bought his first in 1981 (an Aeronca Chief) because he was tired of driving Texas' wide-open spaces to check gauges on oil and gas wells. After a bout with esophageal cancer in 2004, he began buying up other planes in earnest. Lewis, 59, now owns two dozen Warbirds -- World War II-era planes -- including a P-51 Mustang and one of only two surviving T-6G trainer planes used by the Tuskegee airmen. His famed racer Rare Bear holds the speed record for piston-driven aircraft. He also has a B-25 bomber that he flew at an event honoring the 70th anniversary of Doolittle's raid. \"But I'm just flying around,\" he says. \"They were actually fighting and trying to save their ass and fighting for our country.\" The jewel of the collection is Glacier Girl, a P-38 Lightning dug out of the Greenland ice and restored to mint condition. Also drills for oil in Colombia. (I profiled Rod and his Warbird collection here.)\n\n30. Edward Bass\n\n$2.1 billion\n\nFort Worth\n\nLong considered the Renaissance man among the four Bass brothers. Once called \"a Texas-bred cross between Prince Charles and Lorenzo de Medici,\" Ed Bass, 68, has long been considered the Renaissance man among the four Bass brothers. He shares investments in oil and gas with them but also loves architecture and urban planning. In the early 1990s he spent $200 million backing Biosphere 2, a self-contained living experiment in Arizona that he later donated to Columbia University. He owns ranches in Texas and Flint Hills of Kansas; and is devoted to seeding with native grasses. He has spent the past 20 years spearheading the redevelopment of downtown Fort Worth and its central Sundance Square, which is home to the $65 million Bass Performance Hall, which opened in 1998 and boasts some of the best acoustics in the world. Enjoys waxing philosophical; at press conference for Sundance Square in 2012 he said, \"Wealth is not, you know, a matter of money. It is a matter of being able to forwardly organize our lives in a positive way.\" He learned by example: his parents Nancy Lee Bass (who died in March) and husband Perry Bass (d. 2006) celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary by donating $1 million each to 50 charities.\n\n31. Lee Bass\n\n$2.1 billion\n\nFort Worth\n\nLee Bass is the youngest of the four Bass brothers, who inherited a fortune from their oil tycoon uncle Sid Richardson four decades ago and have been building on it ever since, working with investing talent from the likes of Richard Rainwater and David Bonderman. A devoted outdoorsman, Lee, 57, has been instrumental in protecting rhinoceroses worldwide, and is responsible for bringing critically endangered black rhinos and white rhinos to the Fort Worth Zoo. Lee spent 12 years as commissioner of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. His El Coyote ranch in south Texas is home to an elite herd of Texas Longhorn cattle. In 1991 Lee donated $20 million to alma mater Yale University for a new program in Western Civilization. After outcry against Lee's insistence that he get to approve the program's professors, Yale canceled the program and returned the donation. His mother Nancy Lee Bass died in March at age 95; his father passed away 7 years ago.\n\n32. Robert McNair\n\n$2 billion\n\nHouston\n\nOwner of Houston Texans, Robert McNair, 76, has reasons to smile. His team made a second trip to the playoffs in 2013 before losing in the division round. Houston also won the competition to host the Super Bowl in 2017. Will the Texans be ready to win the big game by then? \"Absent any bad luck we ought to be,\" says McNair. \"We have one of the best teams in the NFL now, and I'm proud of that. My goal is to bring a championship team to Houston and to keep making more money so I can give it away.\" The Texans have enjoyed a nail-biting start to the new football season, winning their first two games on the final play. He and his partners paid $700 million for the expansion team a decade ago. Forbes values McNair's 79% stake in the team at $880 million; he says he could sell it for multiples of that, but he never will. Character matters to McNair: \"We won't hire anyone with a history of violence, especially if they have been abusive towards women,\" says McNair. \"The people who perform best are disciplined people. And people who are disciplined are usually of good character.\" He made his fortune selling power plant operator Cogen Technologies to Enron in 1999, and he still owns stakes in a couple of power plants. The Robert and Janice McNair Foundation funds college scholarships for kids in his home state of North Carolina. He's given $25 million to the Univ. of South Carolina; in 2007 he pledged $100 million to Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to attract top-notch doctors.\n\n33. Fayez Sarofim\n\n$2 billion\n\nHouston\n\nThe Egyptian born investment billionaire nicknamed \"The Sphinx,\" returns to the Forbes 400 List for the first time since 2007 carrying a large and growing cache of stock in Kinder Morgan, the energy transportation company. He is one of the firm's early shareholders, serving as a director from 2007 until its February 2011 IPO. He still maintains his post as a director, and is apparently bullish about the company's future -- upping his stake by one million shares in the past year. He directly owns 2% Kinder, which is up 17% since it went public. The son of a wealthy Egyptian cotton farmer, Sarofim received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School before starting his own investment firm, Fayez Sarofim & Co., in 1958. Sarofim made his fortune as a buy-and-hold specialist with long-term investments in Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble. In 1997, he was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame. Fayez Sarofim & Co. currently has $27 billion in assets under management. Sarofim, 85, remains active in Houston, donating to numerous causes including hospitals, schools, and the arts. He currently sits on the board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center as well as the Texas Heart Institute.\n\n34. Gerald Ford\n\n$1.9 billion\n\nDallas\n\nTexas farmer's son Gerald J. Ford bought his first bank for $1.2 million in 1975 and later sold it for $80 million. With fellow billionaire Ron Perelman, he sold California's Golden State Bancorp to Citigroup in 2002 for $6 billion in stock. He survived the 2008 financial meltdown by hedging his Citi shares with options. Now Ford, 69, owns stakes in a mix of public and private companies. Recently he sold his private equity fund's 76% stake in Pacific Capital Bancorp to Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest bank by assets, for $1.15 billion--$650 million more than what it paid in 2010.\n\n35. Ray Davis\n\n$1.9 billion\n\nDallas\n\nThe low-profile pipeline mogul became co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team when he and former XTO Energy founder Bob Simpson teamed with Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan to buy the team for $593 million in 2010. Davis and fellow Forbes 400 member Kelcy Warren acquired the gas pipeline company Cornerstone in 1993. They bought small pipelines and consolidated the holdings into an efficient network. They flipped the pipelines to El Paso in 1999, using the proceeds to create a natural gas retailer, distributor and pipeline company Energy Transfer Equity. Davis, now 72, stepped down as co-chief executive in 2007 and resigned from the board in February 2013, but has held on to 6% of the company.\n\n36. Drayton McLane\n\n$1.9 billion\n\nTemple, Tex.\n\nDrayton McLane Jr., 77, began his career in 1959 as a truck loader working night shifts in his family's grocery distribution center. Over the next three decades he expanded the McLane Company into an international company with 18 divisions, including food service, software, and novelty gifts. He sold the company to friend and tennis partner Sam Walton in 1991 for 10.4 million shares of Wal-Mart stock and $50 million. Wal-Mart sold the company to Berkshire Hathaway in 2003 for $1.45 billion. McLane is a graduate of Baylor University, where he previously served as a trustee, and regent and holds lifetime Regent Emeritus status. In August 2013, the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor in Belton, Texas announced it would honor Drayton McLane, Jr. and his wife, Elizabeth, by renaming the university's business school the McLane College of Business, in appreciation of over 40 years of support. In 2012 the couple made an estimated $200 million donation to Baylor University in Waco, Texas to bankroll a new football stadium. In 2011, McLane sold the Houston Astros baseball team to Houston investment manager James Crane for $610 million. He had purchased the team in 1992 for $103 million.\n\n37. H. Ross Perot, Jr.\n\n$1.8 billion\n\nDallas\n\nGrowing up, Ross Perot Jr. watched his famous father build Electronic Data Services into an I.T. juggernaut. \"I got to see the American dream unfold in my living room.\" And it inspired him. After the Air Force (and completing the first ever circumnavigation of the world by helicopter), Perot Jr. started acquiring land north of Fort Worth, Tex. Eventually he cobbled together 18,000 acres there and built AllianceTexas, a pioneering \"inland port\" featuring an industrial airport, a giant railyard, access to the Interstate and 30 million square feet of warehouses. To Perot's good fortune, drillers soon discovered the giant Barnett Shale natural gas field under his land. In recent years he's sold off most of the natural gas reserves for $700 million and many of the Alliance buildings for more than $800 million. He plans to build 30 million square feet in Fort Worth and millions more at projects in California, Florida and Pennsylvania. A newer adventure: his oil company HKN Energy is developing a giant oilfield in the Kurdish region of Iraq. With his four sisters, Perot, now 55, donated $50 million towards the construction of Dallas' new Perot Museum of Nature & Science.\n\n38. Sid Bass\n\n$1.8 billion\n\nFort Worth\n\nSid and his three brothers, all members of the Forbes 400, inherited a fortune from their oil tycoon uncle Sid Richardson four decades ago and have been building on it ever since, running oil company Bass Operating and leveraging investing talent from the likes of Richard Rainwater and David Bonderman. Sid, 70, has been laying low since his late 2011 divorce from ultra-socialite second wife Mercedes. Details of their settlement are unknown -- assumed to be in the range of $300 million. Rumor is that Sid was more interested in pursuing his painting hobby in Fort Worth than going to the opera in New York, and never wanted to wear a tux again. His mother Nancy Lee Bass died in March, aged 95 -- just one day after the passing of her best friend and neighbor, the pianist Van Cliburn. In 1991, she and husband Perry Bass (d. 2006) celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary by donating $1 million each to 50 charities.\n\n39. Joe Jamail\n\n$1.6 billion\n\nHouston\n\nJoe Jamail Jr. made history in 1987 after representing Pennzoil against Texaco in a landmark case that rewarded Pennzoil with $10.5 billion dollars and Jamail with $345 million in contingency fees. The wealthiest practicing attorney built his practice on personal injury cases. This year, the Tarlton Law Library at the University of Texas acquired the case's transcripts for students to study it. Jamail, 88, who jokes about spending his time eating shrimp and eating beer, says he turns down hundreds of cases a year. With his late wife Lee, he established the Lee and Joseph D. Jamail Foundation in 1986, through which he has given millions to education, medical research and the performance arts. The Baylor College of Medicine announced last year that its outpatient clinic on the McNair Campus would be named the Lee and Joe Jamail Specialty Care Center to honor them.\n\n40. Dan Wilks\n\n$1.5 billion\n\n41.\n\nFarris Wilks\n\n$1.5 billion\n\nCisco, Tex.\n\nBit by the land bug in a big way, in the past two years Dan (57) and his brother Farris (61) have been buying ranches across the west. They picked up billionaire Tom Siebel's 62,000-acre N Bar Ranch in Montana for $45 million in 2011. More recently, they snapped up nearly 300,000 acres in Montana and 36,000 acres in Idaho. They have plenty of cash to spend: the brothers sold their nearly 70% combined interested in hydraulic fracturing and oil field services outfit Frac Tech to a partnership led by Singapore's Temasek Holdings for $3.5 billion in May 2011. But before fracking came bricks. Father Voy Wilks took up bricklaying so he could move his family out of a goat shed and into a proper house. He then asked his employer at a Cisco, TX factory for a small raise. When his employer refused, Voy quit and switched his career to masonry. Following in their father's footsteps the brothers became masons themselves, founding Wilks Masonry together in 1995. Seven years later, the brothers founded Frac Tech. Farris might be the only Forbes 400 member who is also a preacher, presiding over the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day church founded by his father in Rising Star, Tex."
