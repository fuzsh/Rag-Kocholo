        "text": "Luke Bryan’s wife, Caroline, posted a fun video clip to her Instagram. It was a milestone for her and Luke’s oldest son Bo, who is fifteen and just got his driver’s permit.\n\nCaroline said in the video clip, “Bo just passed his driver’s permit test.” His younger brother Tate shouted “Yeah” in the backseat of the SUV. Caroline then asks Bo, “Are you excited?” Bo says, “Yep, just don’t be screaming when I drive, please?” Caroline responds, “I make no promises.”\n\nBryan’s fans were thrilled with the family news, with one fan commenting, “I remember those days with my kids and grandchildren!! I scream… lmao.” Another fan wrote, “Wow, he looks like his dad! I got mine in Feb, lol. My parents are comfortable now, but at first, they felt the same way.” One more fan said, “Never drive faster than your guardian angel can fly!! Safe travels.”\n\nSee that post here.\n\nRELATED: Luke Bryan Learned To Have Fun Early In Life\n\nBryan recently announced that he would headline his fourteenth “Farm Tour” this September during a break from his “Country On Tour” launching June 15. The Georgia native will set up stages in the fields of local farms from September 14-23, 2023. Special guests will be announced at a later time.\n\nLuke said in a statement, “One of the reasons we created these Farm Tour shows – to bring the big-city tour to the people. These nights are one-of-a-kind, and we really enjoy getting to know the farmers and their families, love the whole atmosphere of playing on these incredible farms, and watching entire communities come together and get excited about these shows.”\n\nBryan recently talked about how his Farm Tour has grown. He said, “The Farm Tour has grown throughout the years, and the fact that we can set a stage up in a hayfield or some kind of field and people flock to it is what I envisioned when I created Farm Tour, and to obviously help some kids with scholarships and stuff like that. But the Farm Tour has grown every year, and it’s always something we look forward to. It’s really an exciting time to be able to just be out on a farm on a Fall night.”\n\nGALLERY: Luke Bryan and His Wife Caroline Are Always Smiling\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
