        "text": "Luke Bryan and his wife, Caroline, celebrate 17 years of marriage on Dec. 8, 2023. Many know that they met in college, but now the couple have shared details about their first impressions of one another.\n\n\"It took me a couple of days to realize that this was a real character,\" Caroline reveals in a video interview for Jockey. \"This wasn't just some drunk college guy, this is how he acts.\"\n\nIt was Luke who made the first move at a bar called Dingus McGee's, and Caroline admits that her first thought was that he had a \"big personality with this loud mouth.\"\n\nEventually she would warm up to the future country superstar, and ultimately fall in love with that same big personality. For Luke, however, it didn't take long for him to fall for his future bride after that initial night.\n\n\"The next morning, I woke up and was like, 'Oh my God, that's who I'm going after, right there,'\" he says with a grin in the video below:\n\nThe Bryans are ambassadors for the Jockey brand and have shared some personal details about their lives in a video series called \"Intimate Moments.\"\n\nIn another clip, Caroline reveals that she was the one to say \"I love you\" first. She remembers the moment and her future husband's emphatic, yet relieved response.\n\nCaroline turned to social media on Dec. 8 to share a sweet and goofy anniversary post for her husband:"
