And no trip to the Jersey Shore is complete without some beach eats.\n\nA major reason New Jersey beaches are so terrific isn’t just the sand, the surf and the sun — it’s all the incredible cuisine you can find down the Shore. From boardwalk slices of pizza and ice cream cones to fine dining in the region’s myriad hamlets, the Jersey Shore food scene is versatile, vast and delicious."
