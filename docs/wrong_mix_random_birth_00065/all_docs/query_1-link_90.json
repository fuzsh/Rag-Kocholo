This is the case in this instance as well.\n\nStop & Shop president, Gordon Reid, says, \"Stop & Shop is proud of the deep roots and community ties we have developed as a neighborhood grocer of more than 100 years, and we remain committed to nourishing our associates, customers and communities.\"\n\nAs with most of these closures, the company promises to provide options for the impacted employees of the downsizing.\n\nHowever, that would require some employees to travel even further for work, or perhaps, even relocate, which isn't in the cards for everyone."
