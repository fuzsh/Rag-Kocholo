        "text": "The Soprano Crew, also known as the Gualtieri Crew, is a crew in the Soprano crime family, being led, as of the start of the show, by Tony Soprano. It used to be led, and was founded by Tony's father, Johnny before him, and Tony became captain of the crew upon his father's death from emphysema in 1986. In 1999, Paulie “Walnuts” Gualtieri was promoted to capo of the crew. In 2007 after Carlo Gervasi flipped to the FBI, the Aprile/Gervasi crew was merged with the Gualtieri crew.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nPre-The Many Saints of Newark[]\n\nThe Soprano Crew was presumably started around the same time that the DiMeo crime family was formed. The crew was run by Johnny Soprano, one of the top men of the family. Johnny's brother Corrado, better known as \"Junior\", was a member of this crew, and frequently assisted his younger brother in criminal activities, before he was promoted to capo of his own crew sometime in the 70s. Johnny had a number of criminal charges, including extortion, gambling and loansharking. The Soprano brothers operated in the Ironbound or \"Down Neck\" neighborhood of Newark. One day, Johnny and Junior beat up an associate of theirs named Rocco Alatorre.[1]\n\nJohnny and his men would frequently bring their daughters to the Rideland amusement park. Their intentions in doing so, however, was not to have fun, but rather to conduct business. As it would look sweet and innocent.[1]\n\nOnce incident happened when Johnny and Junior went to Satriale's one day to reclaim money from Mr. Satriale. The two brothers escorted Mr. Satriale to the kitchen and was angry when he didn't have Johnny’s money. After an exchange, Johnny got fed up and asked Junior to hold him down, and as he did, Johnny grabbed a kitchen knife and cut off Mr. Satriale's pinky, all as johnny’s son Tony watched.[2] After the incident, Johnny eventually bought out the store from Mr. Satriale, and he, depressed, wound up shooting himself. Johnny then started the yearly tradition of celebrating Christmas in the store to alleviate the tragedy, complete with a Santa costume meant to be worn by a member of the family.[3]\n\nThe Many Saints of Newark[]\n\nDuring the Newark riots of 1967, Johnny and Junior were both arrested during an illegal card game at Rideland. While Junior bails out, Johnny is put on trial and imprisoned, and he spends the next four years in jail, during which time, Junior serves as acting capo of his crew. When he is released in 1972, he reprimands Junior for not stopping black people from moving into the neighborhood, specifically telling him that Dickie Moltisanti, a capo in the family, has been much more efficient than him, creating a lasting and quiet friction between him and Junior. Meanwhile Dickie is busy fighting a gang war with one of his former earners and friend, Harold McBrayer, who has sought to create his own criminal operation.[4]\n\nAs Dickie, Johnny and soldier Buddha Bonpensiero are coming out of a nightclub in Newark, Harold ambushes them and kills Buddha, escaping before Dickie can kill him. At Buddha's funeral, Junior slips down a set of stairs and harms his back, which makes Dickie burst out laughing. Junior fears that this act will endanger his reputation within the family, and having had enough of Dickie's prestige over his, hires a gunman to murder Dickie as he is coming back home. No one finds out about this, and Dickie’s death is pinned on a corrupt cop.[4]\n\nPre-The Sopranos[]\n\nJohnny’s son Tony eventually joins a gang composed of himself, DiMeo soldier Silvio Dante and childhood friends Ralph Cifaretto and Jackie Aprile. They ran drugs and partook in other mindless criminal activities, until one night, Jackie planned to rob DiMeo capo Feech La Manna's card game as a way to step up.[5] Tony and Jackie, along with Silvio's help, robbed it, getting away with close to $20,000, and thanks to Johnny's connections,[6] they got away scot-free after negotiating on a deal.[5] Tony and Jackie rose through the ranks quickly as a result of this, with Tony \"making his bones\" by killing bookmaker Willie Overall in 1982 with the supervision of Paulie Gualtieri, and being made.[7] One major blow to the crew was when Aprile crew soldier Febby Petrulio turned state's evidence around 1986, with his testimony putting many people behind bars.[8] That same year, Johnny became ill with emphysema, and his condition worsened until he died as a result of the sickness, leaving his crew without a capo.[9] With the support of his friends Paulie, Pussy and Silvio, Tony was made captain of his father's crew at a young age, and he was a charismatic and respected leader.\n\nAround ten years later, the longtime boss of the family, Ercole \"Eckley\" DiMeo was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to life in prison in Springfield Federal Penitentiary, with Tony's friend and fellow captain Jackie Aprile taking over his role as acting boss.[10] Not long after this, around Christmas of that same year, Jackie and Junior had a conflict over the contents of one of Jackie's trucks which Junior's men stole. Pussy Bonpensiero was supposed to serve as a mediator and brokered a sitdown between the two shortly after his return from vacationing in Boca Raton, Florida, but the day of the meeting, he was nowhere to be found. He later showed up at Satriale's with the excuse of having to attend to her goomah after her mother suffered a stroke. Unbeknownst to them at the time, however, was that Pussy had actually been arrested by the FBI on accounts of his heroin trafficking, and given the opportunity of cooperating with them over spending up to 25 years in prison, he chose to become an informant. Pussy even wore a wire to that year's Christmas celebration at the pork store, when he was dressed up in a Santa costume. They noticed he was acting more irritated than usual, but didn't suspect anything about it.[3] In 1998, Jackie was diagnosed with stomach cancer, and was frequently in and out of the hospital until he died that year.[11][10]\n\nThe Sopranos[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nWhen Christopher drives him to work one day, Tony spots Alex Mahaffey, an accountant he is involved with in a Medicare defrauding scam who owes him money and has also been talking bad about him behind his back. He orders Christopher to pull over and he gets out of his car to wrestle him, but Mahaffey manages to escape by kicking him in the groin. Tony then chases him in the car until hitting him , breaking his knee, all in public and in front of a big crowd of people. As Mahaffey wreathes in pain, Tony exits the car and gives him a beating, demanding he give him his money and reprimanding him for badmouthing him. Christopher also beats him, and Mahaffey swears he'll give Tony his money. The crew is also having problems because their main front, Barone Sanitation, is having to compete with a rival, equally shady company called Kolar Bros. Sanitation, who are looking to obtain Barone's Triborough Towers garbage route. On top of that, Tony also learns through Silvio that Junior wants to kill a family member, Little Pussy Malanga, in Tony's childhood friend, Artie Bucco's restaurant, Vesuvio.[12]\n\nThe Triborough Towers situation is settled when Christopher lures the Kolars' relative, Emil Kolar, to a supposed meeting in Satriale's, where after conversing with him for a while, he shoots him dead while Emil was snorting a line of cocaine. Pussy helps him bury the body under a bridge in the Meadowlands. Having dissapeared, his family backs away from the bidding war with Barone Sanitation. The problem with Junior proves to be more complicated; after he refuses to have the hit happen anywhere else, Tony offers Artie tickets to a sea cruise so he would be out of town for the murder, but Artie's wife Charmaine impedes him from going on the trip, knowing the tickets have likely been obtained through dirty money. Tony's friend and advisor Hesh recommends he arson the restaurant, saying Artie could rebuild it with the insurance money. Tony sends Silvio there, and with the help of Corky Ianucci,[13] he blows up the restaurant, the official cause being that an oven had been left turned on.[12]\n\nTony's son A.J.'s science teacher's car later goes missing and Tony sends Pussy and Paulie to go and find it. They identify the stealers as working at a coffee shop in Montclair, and through that they find their adress and track them both down to their apartment where they force them to go find a car of the same brand after the first one was chopped. At school, the teacher is somewhat surprised when his car is returned with the same plates, but different keys and a different color.[11] Later Silvio informs Tony of a business arrangement he needs to tend to concerning a Jewish businesssman named Shlomo Teittleman who is the co-owner of the Flyaway Motel. Shlomo is being shaken down for 50% of his motel by his son-in-law, Ariel, who will not divorce Shlomo's daughter. Tony asks for 25% of the Flyaway Motel if he can get the son-in-law to agree to a divorce. Paulie and Silvio go to the motel and beat Ariel ferociously after he refuses to accept Shlomo's demands, locking him up in the trunk of their car and taking him to Satriale's to beat him some more. They eventually call Tony after he continues to resist. After seeking advice in Hesh, Tony threatens with castrating him, and he finally agrees. Ultimately, however, Shlomo refuses to hold up his end of the bargain.[14]\n\nThen, Christopher and his friend Brendan Filone hijack a truckload of Italian suits which, unbeknownst to them, belongs to Comley Trucking, a company that pays Junior protection money. After a sitdown with Tony and Jackie (who is currently back on the streets), Junior agrees to the pair showing him restitution in the form of $15,000. Christopher and Brendan both consider the price exaggerated, all while Chris is still on the fence about not being made yet, and Brendan even goes so far as to make an insentitive joke about Jackie's chemotherapy treatment, for which Tony tossles him across a room. Tony reasons with Christopher that he should give him the full sum, and that he'll talk to Junior personally to see if he can minimize the price. Brendan is relentless, however, and he tells Christopher that they should hijack another truck, to which he initially agrees but later backs down from after analyzing the situation. Brendan goes ahead with it anyway, and with the help of two street thugs he hijacks the truck, but in a twist of turns, one of the thugs' guns misfires and the truck driver gets killed.[11]\n\nChristopher and Brendan later meet up with Tony and the gang where he reprimands them for acting impulsively. They decide to keep the suits, though, and simply tell the two to return the truck.[11] Junior is furious about all of this, and seeks council in Tony's mother Livia over what the repercussions should be. Livia is fond of Christopher, but mentions how he could \"use a little talking to\". In regards to Brendan, she just gives an indifferent opinion. Acting on this, Junior hires Russian mobsters to give Christopher a mock execution. He gets dragged into the Meadowlands and roughed up, and he defecates in his pants in fear, after which the Russians kick him to the floor and leave him there. Meanwhile, Junior's bodyguard Mikey shoots Brendan through the eye as he was relaxing in his bathtub.[14][10]\n\nSoon after this, Tony fears his reputation is at stake when he goes to his weekly therapy session and is forced to hide after he spots Silvio coming out of a clinic right next to the therapy room. Weary at the prospect of his friends discovering he is talking to a psychiatrist and could thus be revealing family secrets, he hires corrupt Newark Police detective Vin Makazian to spy on his therapist, Jennifer Melfi, and make sure she maintains the confidentiality of their sessions. Makazian proves to be highly unstable, however, when he drunkenly stops Melfi and her boyfriend Randall while he was following them in his car. He claims they were driving past the speed limit, even though they weren't, and ferociously beats up and turns in Randall after making him get out of the car. Melfi protests the injustice of the situation and threatens with calling her lawyer, but Makazian simply tells her that she's got \"prime rib at home\", and instead goes out with \"hamburgers\", referring to her relationship with Tony. He later reprimands Makazian for his behavior, but continues to employ him as a link between him and law enforcement authorities.[10]\n\nWhen Christopher gets out of the hospital following the altercation and discovers Brendan's body at his house, he is furious and tries to go kill Mikey, but Tony reminds him that he's a made man, and prevents him from doing it. Instead, Tony bumps into Mikey and beats him relentlessly using a stapler. Afterwards, he goes to Junior at the restaurant that he frequents. He reprimands him for his actions, telling him they were \"extreme\", saying that he runs his crew his way, and that he shouldn't meddle with it. Junior counters that he just disciplined the pair and that the two were warned, and still, they acted in a disrespective manner. He goes on to ask Tony if Christopher is a good earner, and after he affirms it, Junior declares he'll be working for him now. After Tony indignantly declines, Junior tells him to go, stating the next time he comes around, he \"come heavy or not at all bring a gun\".[10]\n\nTony later meets with the other capos to discuss the current situation of the family. Now that Jackie is at death's door since his condition deteriorated, the prospect of choosing a new boss comes up. Tony has the backing of the other captains, but doesn't feel like taking control, arguing that Junior has New York's backing behind him and fearing, like them, that a war is heating up. They tell him that their stance can change and that if Tony gains the position, he'll get their approval. Further complications arise when one of Christopher earners in the street, Yo-Yo Mendez, tells him Junior's men took the money and left with it, claiming the neighborhood was theirs now, after which Christopher beats him for not paying him. As Tony is at the Bing later, he sees through the television news broadcast that Jackie has died, raising a toast in his memory with Pussy, Paulie and Silvio. Christopher then enters the club to tell him about the tension with Junior, saying they should go to war, and saying that he will question his leadership if he doesn't act on the situation, for which Tony very nearly hits him.[10]\n\nFinding himself between a rock and a hard place, Tony finally solves the issue with his uncle after a decisive therapy session with Dr. Melfi. She recommends him a book which centers around dealing with the elderly, mentioning that sometimes, it's important to \"let them have the illusion of control\". Going off that, Tony goes back to Junior's restaurant, armed with a weapon (to satisfy his desire that he \"come heavy\"), but hoping not to use it. He sits down with Junior, and tells him that he has decided, with the support of the captains, to make Junior the boss, in exchange for some of Junior's unions and businesses. At Jackie's funeral later, Tony explains to the others that he put Junior in the top spot to satisfy his desires so he would stop interfering with everybody's business, which also marks him as the main target for the FBI, being an elderly man without a family, and protecting Tony and the others if things go south. All the while, every actual decision is made by Tony.[10]\n\nSometime later, Tony is taking Meadow on a trip to Maine to try out new colleges, when he spots Febby Petrulio, the informant who turned state's evidence in 1986, at a gas station they stopped at. Tony initially tries driving him off the road, but stops after Meadow complains. Instead, as they continue their trip, he calls Christopher and has him write down his license plate and give him his address, saying the car is registered as property of \"Frederick Peters\", which Tony assumes is his fake identity. Meanwhile, Febby also notices Tony is following him, and asks around for him at the town. That night, Tony tracks down Febby's store and identifies him after seeing a carved wooden bust of Ronald Reagan with unmatching lips, a mistake he would often make when he designed them as a hobby. Febby also discovers Tony is indeed following him after discovering his and Meadow's names in the reservation list of the restaurant they were staying at. As Tony and Meadow are heading back to the motel that night, Febby gets a clear shot to shoot Tony with his gun, but has to stop after an elderly couple pass by. The following morning, Tony drops Meadow off at the college to go kill Febby. He, on the other hand, had tried to get two of his drug customers to murder him, but they had declined, and after stepping outside his store, Tony sneaks up behind him and garrotes him to death despite his pleading.[8]\n\nThe new leadership within the family is a ruthless one that doesn't adhere to \"old arrangements\", as Junior proves when he has Mikey (who is now his consigliere) bust a card game led by Sammy Grigio, one of Jimmy Altieri's associates, with the excuse of it not benefiting anyone, for which Sammy gets beat up. Junior also gets word that his tailor's 14 year-old grandson commited suicide after being subjected to psychedelic drugs administered to him by Rusty Irish, one of Larry's earners. He then has him killed by throwing him off a bridge. Tony is tasked by the other captains with solving these problems as well as having to deal with Junior beginning to tax Hesh at Livia's subtle recommendation (she has been manipulating Junior behind the shadows). Tony solves Hesh's issue when he gets Johnny Sack to come from New York and act as though Tony's reasoning was entirely his, with Junior being receptive to a third party's opinion. Tony then has a conversation with Junior in which he tells him he needs to take things easy and stop bothering everyone. Junior agrees, and a dinner is hosted in his honor and in celebration of his leadership. However, an FBI undercover agent takes photos of all family members present at the dinner, which kicks off the FBI's investigation against the DiMeo family.[15]\n\nNot long after this, the family is informed, through Larry Barese's connections, of impending federal indictments from the FBI. Junior initially believes it to be a mere rumour, but is forced to accept the truth after confiding with all the captains. They all decide to hide their incriminating objects, and Tony quickly rushes to his house and picks out all his guns and stolen goods. He decides to conceal them all at his mother's room in her retirement home. Pussy, meanwhile, gets rid of his by burning them all in his barbecue. Christopher is feeling extremely undermined around this time for not being able to climb up the rankings of the mob, as well as feeling like his life has no direction, while he's also struggling to write his movie script and is being haunted by memories of Emil Kolar, who he killed months ago. This leads him to take impulsive decisions, such as when he's called to get pastries for the guys. He gets angry with the Counter Boy at the bakery for not serving him in time, and after threatening him with his gun, shoots him in the foot before taking the pastries. After having nightmares about Emil, he requests the help of Georgie the Bartender to dig up his body. For this Tony hits him and reprimands him, telling him he should act more carefully now that they're being indicted. Tony's mother Livia has heard from her grandson that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist, and, resentful at Tony since he put her at the retirement home, passes this information on to Junior, who now fears that Tony could be passing on family secrets.[16]\n\nTony and his friends regularly attend their daughters' soccer games, and they develop a friendship with the coach, Don Hauser, inviting him into their stripclub and hanging with him. Makazian also informs Tony that Mikey has hired a Manhattan private investigator, believing Tony to be an informant. The other captains in the family, and even Johnny Sack, have learned from Tony's strategy and begun to move in their mothers to the Green Grove Retirement Home, so as to avoid any pressure from the government. The guys also learn that Coach Hauser is leaving the college to go teach soccer at a more well-paying school in Rhode Island. Wanting him to keep coaching their daughters, the crew tries bribing the coach to convince him to stay. Tony sends Paulie to his house with a free Plasma TV, but Coach Hauser insists he will not be bribed. Christopher eventually even goes there and threatens with taking away the coach's dog. All ends, however, when Meadow reveals Coach Hauser had sexual relationships with one of her peers, Ally Vandermeed. The crew then contemplates killing the coach as a personal revenge, and Tony already has Silvio drive over to his house, but after a fateful discussion with Artie, Tony calls off the murder, and authorities end up taking away the coach to prison.[17]\n\nMeanwhile, word has been getting out that Junior provides oral sex to his goomah, Bobbi Sanfillipo, a much maligned subject in the Mafia. Carmela passes this information to Tony, who finds it hilarious. When he and Silvio go out golfing with Mikey and Junior, Tony starts making suggestive comments while on the golf course, saying things like; \"Uncle June's in the muff\" and \"I thought you were a baccala man, Uncle June, what are you doing eating sushi?\" He even hums a song dubbed \"South of the border, where the tunafish play\", an allusion to oral sex. While Tony doesn't intend to offend Junior, these comments enrage his uncle, who suspiciously tells him that at least \"[he] can deal with [his] own problems, unlike some [he] know[s].\" Later, in their locker room, Junior confesses to Mikey that Tony has been talking to a psychiatrist, and flies around the idea of killing him.[17]\n\nHowever, later that year, an assassination attempt was made on Tony, though it fail, leaving Tony only with a small ear injury. When Tony found out who had hired hit men to assassinate him, he was shocked and angry - Junior and his Consigliere, Michael 'Mikey Grab Bag' Palmice (a mobster Tony thoroughly hated), had created a conspiracy against Tony, after it was revealed to Junior that Tony was seeing a therapist. Junior therefore believed Tony was working for the FBI, which was not true. Tony took violent action, demanding the death of everyone in the conspiracy. By the end of the week, all but one of the six members of the conspiracy had been killed or arrested: Junior had been arrested and was awaiting a re-trial; Joe 'Beppy' Sasso, the family's Underboss, had been given a life sentence; Mikey was murdered; Charles 'Chucky' Signore, a Soldier in the Junior crew was murdered; Donnie Paduana, an Associate in the Junior crew was murdered. Philip 'Philly Spoons' Parisi, the Capo of the Junior crew, was only man remaining. Tony spared him since his twin brother, Pasquale 'Patsy' Parisi, was loyal to him, and he didn't want to create any social conflicts. Due to Beppy Sasso's imprisonment for life, Tony promoted himself to Underboss, his second-in-command Sil to Consigliere, and Paulie Walnuts to Capo. In 2000, Paulie and Tony had Spoons murdered by Gigi Cestone, another Soldier, for spreading nasty rumours about Tony in an attempt to start a mutiny.\n\nAfter Tony's promotion to Acting Boss and Sil's promotion to Consigliere (due to Mikey's assassination), Paulie Walnuts was promoted to Capo of the crew as well as underboss. Paulie was a reasonable earner, and an overall good Capo, though sometimes certain Soldiers and Associates thought he took too much pleasure when pulling rank. An example of this was in 2001 when Chrissy had just been promoted to the rank of Soldier. While most of the family applauded his achievement, Paulie simply told Chrissy to take off his clothes, in order to do a full scale inspection of Chrissy, to check he wasn't wearing a wire (a recorder that is placed by the FBI when working for them). Paulie also enjoyed giving particularly hard tasks to Chrissy. It seems Paulie felt that Chrissie had risen too fast in the Family and hadn't necessarily \"earned\" his promotion, instead believing that he had gotten it mostly due to his family connection to Tony and Tony's personal loyalty to Chrissie's father. In Paulie's mind - and this was based on his own personal experience - rising to the top levels of the Family required many years of toil, steadfast loyalty, and a willingness and ability to successfully and without question complete all manner of \"dirty work\" for the organization. For this reason, Paulie determined that HE would make Chrissie earn his promotion and understand that the perks he was receiving as a Soldier do not usually come so easy. Paulie also had an obsession with being the highest-earning Capo, which he rarely ever was - the Aprile crew was always the high earning crew no matter who was running it, and the Barese, Junior and Curto crews all brought in a hefty amount of cash. This made Paulie angry and jealous, continuously arguing with the other Capos and claiming that he always had a share of their profits (which wasn't always true). Paulie's loyalties was another downfall of his - at one point in 2003, due to his hate for Capo Ralph Cifaretto, he talked to Lupertazzi Family underboss Johnny Sacrimoni about jokes Ralph made about John's wife. As for murders, Paulie was always ready for anything, though sometimes going too far (notably killing a waiter for insulting him and Chrissy when they left a small tip). Christopher was made Capo of a crew consisting of younger members of Paulie's crew. In 2007, he stepped down from the underboss position when it was revealed he had prostate cancer, which he beat. During the War of 2007, however, Paulie was loyal to his family, deciding not to join the Lupertazzi side, but to stay with the DiMeo mobsters instead. With Underboss Robert 'Bobby Bacala' Baccalieri Jr. dead and Sil in a coma, Paulie returned to the position of underboss.\n\nAfter the death of Christopher Moltisanti, his small crew was merged back into Paulie's crew. After Capo Carlo Gervasi turned informant, Paulie was given control of his crew, which also consisted of the remnants of Vito Spatafore's crew. As the season ended, Paulie was in control of a very large chunk of the Soprano family. Also running their business interests in Construction and the New Jersey Ports, setting him up as the top earner for the family.\n\nList of members of the Soprano crew[]\n\n(NB: a large chunk of members were transferred from the Altieri, Spatafore, and Moltisanti crews during 2006 and 2007, and 3 of them are Hitmen from the Naples family that are occasionally used by the Soprano’s).\n\nCurrent Members (55)[]\n\nPeter 'Paulie Walnuts' Gualtieri - Soldier (~1960s-1999), Capo (1999-present)\n\nPasquale 'Patsy' Parisi - Soldier (1970s-)\n\nWalden Belfiore - Soldier (2007-).\n\nBenny Fazio - Associate (2000-2007), Soldier (2007-).\n\nFrankie Cortese - Soldier (2004-).\n\nPeter 'Little Paulie' Germani - Associate (1990s-2005), Soldier (2005-).\n\nPeter LaRosa - Associate (2000-2004), Soldier (2004-)\n\nDante “Buddha” Greco - Soldier (2004-).\n\nCary DiBartolo - Associate (1980s-1993), Soldier (1993-) .\n\nTerry Doria - Soldier (2004-).\n\nVincent “Vinny Pitts” Pisaturo - Soldier (2004-).\n\nBig Frank Cippolina - Soldier (1999-).\n\nJoey Sammarco - Soldier (1999-).\n\nDave Salerno - Soldier (1998-).\n\nDonny “Donny K” Kafranza - Soldier (Pre-1999-).\n\nJason Molinaro - Associate (pre-2004-2006), Soldier (2006-).\n\nKevin \"Dogsy” Interdonato - Soldier (2003-).\n\nItalo, Roberto, and Salvatore - Soldiers (2006-) hitmen for the Naples family.\n\nFive Unnamed Men - Soldiers (1999-).\n\nThree Unnamed Men - Soldiers (1998-).\n\nTwo Unnamed Men - Soldiers (1998-).\n\nHerman \"Hesh\" Rabkin - Associate (1970s-).\n\nAngie Bonpensiero - Associate (2004-).\n\nWarren Dupree - Associate (1999-).\n\nPerry 'Muscles Marinara' Annunziata - Associate (2006-).\n\nCorky Caporale - Associate (2004-).\n\nJames 'Murmur' Zancone - Associate (2005-).\n\nThomas Maccarato - Associate (2000-).\n\nSammy Grigio - Associate (1998-).\n\nCorky DiGioia - Associate (2005-).\n\nGeorgie Santorelli - Associate (1998-).\n\nBryan Spatafore - Associate (1999-).\n\nAlfie Goduti - Associate (2003-).\n\nEli Kaplan - Associate (2006-).\n\nJoe DaRuffa - Associate (2000-).\n\nJoey Flies - Associate (2000-).\n\nChip La Monica - Associate (2000-).\n\nFritzie - Associate (2006-).\n\nMaldonaldo Brothers - Associates (1998-).\n\nSpatafore Renovators - Associates (1999-).\n\nFormer Members[]\n\nGiovanni 'Johnny Boy' Soprano - Capo (circa.1950s-1986), died of emphysema.\n\nCorrado \"Junior” Soprano - Soldier (1950s-198?), Acting Capo (1967-1972), Capo (mid to late 1970s-1998), gave control back to Johnny after his release from prison.
