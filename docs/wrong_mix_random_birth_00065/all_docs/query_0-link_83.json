        "text": "STEPHEN PECK\n\nCEO\n\nStephen J. Peck, who served as a Marine officer in Vietnam, leads U.S.VETS, the nation’s largest nonprofit provider of housing and other essential services for at-risk and homeless veterans and their families. Peck, who recently celebrated his 25th anniversary with U.S.VETS, advocates at state and national levels to bring attention to potential solutions for homeless veterans.\n\n“Our job at U.S.VETS is to engage the enemy at home — the enemy of homelessness, disillusionment and disappointment — to let these men and women know there is a path forward,” says Peck. “U.S.VETS strives to empower each veteran to take responsibility for his or her success, guiding them toward independence in the community, developing their workforce skills and supporting recovery.”\n\nPeck graduated from Northwestern University in 1968 and entered the Marine Corps that same year. In Vietnam, he was a first lieutenant in the 1st Marine Division, serving as a forward observer outside of Danang in 1969, and received the Navy Commendation Medal.\n\nAfter his service, Peck became a documentary filmmaker. A series of films on homelessness and veterans’ issues compelled him to change careers. He went on to help the Veterans Administration place homeless veterans into housing, and in 1996 joined the organization that became U.S.VETS. Initially serving as the organization’s director of community development, Peck was also the inaugural director of U.S.VETS’ largest site in Long Beach before being appointed president and CEO in 2010.\n\nPeck earned his master’s degree in social work from USC in 1997 and later became the president of the California Association of Veteran Service Agencies (CAVSA), a consortium of seven nonprofit veteran service providers working in partnership to address the needs of California’s veterans.\n\nHe has been honored by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, Northwestern University, American Legion Auxiliary, City of Long Beach and Los Angeles Business Journal, in addition to receiving a doctorate of humane letters, honoris causa, by the Chicago School of Professional Psychology.\n\nPeck and his wife Kristine Kidd, a food writer, culinary consultant and the former food editor of Bon Appetit magazine, live with their Labrador retriever Atticus in the Los Angeles community of Topanga Canyon.

For his efforts, he was recognized among the Honolulu Star-Bulletin’s “10 Who Made a Difference in Hawaii” and received the “Unsung Hero” award from the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans for his advocacy on behalf of Hawaii’s veterans and their families. He has also been honored by Helping Hands Hawaii for two decades in the social service field and received the Harry & Jeanette Weinberg Foundation AIM for Excellence Award.\n\nBut he doesn’t stop there. Vincent wants to ensure U.S.VETS is always offering the best care possible and seeing to the needs of our nation’s heroes. His attention to quality and measurable outcomes led U.S.VETS to achieve accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), which recognizes an organization has met the highest standards of care and is a leader in service delivery to homeless veterans.\n\nOthers are taking note, too. Vincent and the team at U.S.VETS also recently accepted the Congressional Medal of Honor Society’s 2023 Community Service Award for demonstrating the values of courage, citizenship, commitment and patriotism and for going above and beyond as civilians to perform extraordinary acts of service.\n\nVincent has received numerous other honors, including his selection to Variety’s Annual Salute to Service Impact List. He has been featured in local and national media, such as Hawaii Magazine, Honolulu Star Advertiser, ABC, CBS and Fox News, and has provided testimony at state and federal levels of government, community coalitions and Veterans Administration leadership, advocating for the needs of America’s veterans.\n\nIn addition to his professional community involvement, Vincent is a Weinberg Fellow and proud member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He earned a bachelor’s degree in human services and a master’s degree in social work from the University of New England and is a certified substance abuse counselor.\n\nVincent is the proud father of two sons, the eldest of whom graduated from West Point in 2020 and is currently attending U.S. Army Flight School at Fort Rucker in Alabama.\n\nDAN WARZENSKI\n\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\nDan Warzenski joined U.S.VETS in October 2015 after more than three decades in retail, bringing with him a wealth of big company experience.
