        "text": "Jon Bon Jovi is mourning the loss of his mother, Carol A. Bongiovi, who died on July 9 at age 83.\n\nThe singer confirmed his mother’s death in a statement to People, saying on behalf of his family, “Our mother was a force to be reckoned with, her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family. She will be greatly missed.”\n\nPeople noted that Carol died at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J. just three days shy of her 84th birthday. A cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nCarol met her husband, John Bongiovi Sr., while enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. She notably was also a Playboy bunny and founded the Bon Jovi fan club. She is survived by her husband of 63 years, their three sons and daughters-in-law and eight grandchildren.\n\nJon Bon Jovi on His Son Marrying Millie Bobby Brown\n\nIn May, Jon Bon Jovi confirmed his son, Jake Bongiovi, and actress Millie Bobby Brown are officially married.\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame singer told BBC's The One Show, “They’re great. They’re absolutely fantastic. It was a very small family wedding, and the bride looked gorgeous, and Jake is happy as can be.”\n\nReports surfaced during the Memorial Day holiday weekend that the young couple tied the knot in a secret ceremony. However, there wasn’t an official confirmation.\n\nDays after they said “I do,” People spotted the couple in the Hamptons on May 26, and both were wearing wedding bands on their ring fingers.\n\nJake, 22, and Millie, 20, announced their engagement in April 2023. Brown took to Instagram and shared a black-and-white photo of her being hugged by Bongiovi. In the photo, she’s wearing a sizable diamond ring on her left ring finger. She captioned the photo with a lyric from the Taylor Swift song “Lover”: “I’ve loved you three summers now, honey, I want ’em all.” Meanwhile, Bongiovi shared a photo to Instagram with Brown and captioned it simply, “Forever.”\n\nThe young couple were first rumored to be dating in Spring 2021.\n\nJon Bon Jovi and his wife, Dorothea Hurley, eloped in Las Vegas in 1989. However, the two were famously high school sweethearts. Even though they married when they were older, JBJ can definitely relate to Jake and Millie’s “young love.”\n\nBon Jovi said of his son’s engagement to Good Morning America, “It is an accelerated version of what I went through 40 years ago … I’ve gotten to know [Millie] in the last year, she works really hard, and she and Jake will grow together in their own way.”\n\nThree of Jon and Dorothea’s four children are in very serious relationship. People notes that oldest child/daughter, Stephanie, 30, is also engaged. The outlet also confirmed that second-born/son, Jesse, 29, and his longtime girlfriend, Jesse Light, actually eloped in Vegas on May 7 at the same chapel where Jon and Dorothea eloped.\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
