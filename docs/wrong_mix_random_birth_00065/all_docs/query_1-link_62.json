We want our wines to be approachable in their youth, yet to age beneficially for ten to fifteen years. How best to achieve these goals is something we continue to experiment with in small lot trials.",

A wonderful and dedicated group of men led by Ranch Foreman, Jose Castro, their efforts correlate directly to the quality of the wine we produce and the beauty of the property.\n\nPaul Skinner has been our viticultural consultant since 1990. Paul has made many improvements to our viticultural practice over these past 30 years and continues to provide his technical insight as we move forward. Steve, Paul, Matt and Jose are in daily communication about new and ongoing strategies for ensuring that each of our 50 vineyard blocks is producing the best possible wine.\n\nThis diverse group does it all, from representing us in the national sales market, to answering your phone calls and emails with a smile, to keeping the property looking its best. Some of them you may meet when you visit, some of them you may not, but they are all important members of our team and we couldn't do it without them!"
