Kline is a solid, seasoned performer with over 40 years of steady playing under his belt. Starting with local New Jersey bands whose members would go on to play with Bruce Springsteen and Patti LaBelle, Jeff moved to N.Y.C. and performed with such noted acts as the Drifters, Chuck Berry, Solomon Burke, the Crystals, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, the Marvellettes, George Thorogood, and even the Beach Boys!

King.\n\nJ.B. Kline has focused in on his roots, which are R&B, and blues based music. His CDs, \"Music Mountain\" and \"Belvidere Line\", all feature music, mostly self-penned, all in that vein. His 3rd CD, \"All Of Your Love\" is a passionate and emotional journey unto J.B.'s musical world. His long awaited 4th and 5th CD, \"Makin' The Deal Go Down\" and\n\n\"Acoustic Sensibility\" are here!\n\nJ.B. worked hard and long to try and produce sounds to equal his heralded early efforts, and we think he has done it!!\n\n​J.B. Kline has been known to say, \"I'd rather squeeze a pound of soul into 1 note, than to play 250 notes! You’ve gotta feel it or it don’t mean nothin’ at all.” As anyone who’s been to one of his performances can tell you, J.B. Kline definitely “feels it” when he is singing and playing his guitar -- and you can feel it too! His stark emotional style of music takes him, and you, to exciting, almost orgasmic places. J.B. Kline is worth seeing, hearing and feeling!\n\nView Event →\n\nCharlie Don't Surf\n\nCharlie Don’t Surf was created by Jeff and Pete, long time partners in Mobius Strip. Wanting to create funky, earthy jam music they searched for a drummer and the right one found them. Or more appropriately, they found each other.\n\nAndrew, delivering a keg to their studio, admired the vintage “half stacks” and conversation led to a jam, the musical connection immediate. Looking for the right bass player to bring it home found Christian, a jazzy, funky player, the unit complete.\n\nCharlie Don’t Surf covers funky songs and if a choice is not funky the band funks it up. Charlie “does the song” but “does it our way.” Jamming, flipping the beat around, “pushing the one” is what the band is about.\n\nAll write songs but Charlie Don’t Surf is an “original cover band” that covers the song but makes it their own, creatively satisfying for them and their audience.\n\nView Event →\n\nJoe Cirotti Trio\n\nJoe Cirotti Trio, a well-oiled string band from the shadows of Northwest Jersey’s Appalachian ridge, fuses their multi-instrumentalist upbringings with a passion for the roots of American folk, jazz, country, and bluegrass. Their bond is rooted in proximity, strengthened by a blue-collar passion for picking, and buoyed by their shared propensity for roots music and whiskey.\n\nFormed in 2015, the current line-up of Joe Cirotti: guitar, Pete Lister: upright bass, and Timmy Coyle: mandolin and guitar, continues to craft a sound steeped in tradition yet infused with modern twists.\n\nThe group also occasionally plays as a 4/5-piece ensemble, adding banjo, fiddle, dobro, percussion, or even more mandolin, often joined by founding member Mike Alexander.\n\nJoe Cirotti Trio has become a fixture at premier area venues across the NWNJ area, and is booking into the summer and fall across a wider area. Their debut release, “Joe Cirotti Trio”, launched on CD and Vinyl in December 2023, and streaming on all major platforms.\n\nThey find common musical ground in influences like Doc Watson, Tony Rice, and Garcia/Grisman, but also as diverse as Django Reinhardt, Pink Floyd, and Van Halen. This stirs up a one-of-a-kind blend of Americana, bluegrass, alt-country, and gypsy jazz, and acoustic pop.\n\nView Event →\n\nBryan Hansen band\n\nBRYAN HANSEN BAND\n\nMeet Bryan Hansen Band, hailing from Central New Jersey (it does exist). Their music, as defined by Lenny Green of WBLS, is a soulful concoction dubbed \"Blue Eyed Soul,\" blending funky rhythms with bluesy vibes and soulful melodies.\n\nFrom the Jersey Shore to iconic venues like Bowery Electric NYC and the House of Blues Anaheim, these guys have been Making America Funk Again. They've even graced the legendary Troubadour in West Hollywood and been featured at Winter NAMM 2020 & 2024 and SoFar Sounds D.C. & NYC.\n\nFrom their debut EP in 2009 Ebb & Flow EP 2009, the band has released 4 LP's including Brothers Among Wolves 2013, When You Stop Pulling Back 2016, Gas Money 2019 and most recently, Jammin with Dr. Fong LP 2024.\n\nDrawing inspiration from legends like Stevie Wonder, Dave Matthews Band, and Victor Wooten, Bryan Hansen Band infuses their music with soulful influences that resonate with audiences.\n\nBryan Hansen Band is proudly endorsed by Godin Guitars and BG France.\n\nCheck out their latest album, 'Jammin with Dr. Fong' available on all streaming platforms.\n\nView Event →\n\nCold In Hand\n\nCold In Hand\n\nVeterans of the Tri-state Blues scene, Bob Lanza and Al Gold join forces in a new group they call, “Cold In Hand”.

In his most prolific period to date Glabicki is focusing his energy on his new band, The UPROOTED Band, to carry on the legacy of Rusted Root’s energetic music while recording new music for their debut album due out next Spring.\n\n“Uprooted has masterfully expanded the landscape of the older Rusted Root songs and created a new intuitive and magnetic vision of the material” says Glabicki, “These inspired performances not only energize and expand the hearts of the crowds but also show us how to take the new music to the next level”.\n\nRusted Root, lead by Michael, built their career around dramatic performances; their polyrhythmic, multicultural rock-and-soul picked up fans like a junkyard magnet as they swept across the nation on tour. Glabicki continues to keep this tradition alive through his new project, The Uprooted Band.\n\nThe Uprooted Band Featuring Michael Glabicki of Rusted Root\n\nWith Dirk Miller on guitar and vocals, Ricky Petraglia on drums, Keaton Thandi on percussion, Erik Kramer on bass and Daisie Ghost Flower and Emily Victoria on background vocals, The Uprooted Band is a liberating project for Glabicki. He says \"I looked to the past and imagined where I wanted to go and realized this band is the perfect vehicle to take me there.” This tour will focus on the energy and excitement Rusted Root brought to all of their fans, and keep the spirit of the music moving forward.\n\nMichael Glabicki of Rusted Root with Dirk Miller Duo Show\n\nIn addition to the full band, Glabicki strips down to the bare essentials on a duo tour where he and long-time bandmate Dirk Miller take the old Rusted Root favorites along with new material and perform re-envisioned versions of them in an up close and intimate setting.\n\n“We go into the crevices of the songs and expand them out and open up the music to whatever happens in the moment,” Glabicki says of his shows with Miller. “It’s completely improvisational, to the point where we surprise ourselves a lot. Things just happen, and I start laughing. It’s like we’ve never heard it sound like that before. We have a great time with it and the audience seems to enjoy the musical exploration too.”\n\nA multifaceted musician, producer and songwriter, Glabicki’s talents are unique and extremely uplifting. His new projects and music are extensions of his creative talent, and will inspire all those who participate. Tour dates and additional information can be found on Glabicki’s website and social platforms.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Toll Collectors\n\nChristina Alessi and the Toll Collectors are a quintet led by a seasoned storyteller who sings from the heart. We counted off our first song in late 2014 in a former industrial building on the Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel. They say that friends are the family you choose, and our music is an extension of our bond.\n\nAnd how do we sound? (Ah, every band’s favorite question.) Like rain on the windshield during a late-night drive. Or a jukebox sing-along in a neighborhood dive. A bit of country, rock, and soul. But something else, too. Heartbroken, yet defiant. Down, but never out. Resolute.\n\nIt might help to mention that there’s violin and mandolin, a lead vocalist who thrives on connecting with audiences large and small, and four more singers who pile on the harmonies. I guess you could call it Americana music. But why not just listen?\n\nView Event →\n\nSheire Project\n\nWhat if John Mayer and Stevie Ray Vaughn had a child?

Their bond is rooted in proximity, strengthened by a blue-collar passion for picking, and buoyed by their shared propensity for roots music and whiskey.\n\nFormed in 2015, the current line-up of Joe Cirotti: guitar, Pete Lister: upright bass, and Timmy Coyle: mandolin and guitar, continues to craft a sound steeped in tradition yet infused with modern twists.\n\nThe group also occasionally plays as a 4/5-piece ensemble, adding banjo, fiddle, dobro, percussion, or even more mandolin, often joined by founding member Mike Alexander.\n\nJoe Cirotti Trio has become a fixture at premier area venues across the NWNJ area, and is booking into the summer and fall across a wider area. Their debut release, “Joe Cirotti Trio”, launched on CD and Vinyl in December 2023, and streaming on all major platforms.\n\nThey find common musical ground in influences like Doc Watson, Tony Rice, and Garcia/Grisman, but also as diverse as Django Reinhardt, Pink Floyd, and Van Halen. This stirs up a one-of-a-kind blend of Americana, bluegrass, alt-country, and gypsy jazz, and acoustic pop.\n\nView Event →\n\nJimmy Leahey & Gray Man Group\n\nJimmy Leahy started playing guitar at age 7, learning from his dad, Harry... a well-known jazz player and a prolific teacher in New Jersey.

What is a Hellbender? Simply put, it is a type of salamander found in the eastern United States. But the reason for this name is not just our love of regional amphibians, but rather that word just sounds like pure Rock & Roll, with an easygoing vibe that suits our persona. We describe our style as “good time folk-a-billy jam pop dance party rock”, with unconventional instrumentation that weaves together the acoustic and electric, old timey and modern, with a pulsating undercurrent of tasty banjo ever-present. And it suggests a certain bendy looseness of musical interpretation inherent in our exploration of favorite tunes from across pretty much any genre, with a particular soft\n\nspot for ‘80s rock & pop, ballads, B-side classic rock, Grateful Dead, and Kenny Loggins. Mostly from the fair borough of Califon (Jason Beard, Brian Goad, and Dan Hemberger), with imported bass and vocal skills via Pat Walsh from Lawrenceville. We play what we like, which given our collective 200 years’+ of living experience, can cover a lot of ground. The Hellbenders try to give people a reason to get their bodies moving, but are also known to explore the soft underbelly of music across these genres. You’ve heard a lot of these tunes, and we’re guessing there are some you have not. Even if you have, you may not recognize them at first. Have fun with it! All we promise is a really good time.\n\nView Event →\n\nCC Coletti\n\nCC, a New Jersey native, started singing and creating music at a young age.
