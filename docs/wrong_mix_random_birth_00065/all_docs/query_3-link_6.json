        "text": "Mike Bryan took \"ATP World Uncovered\" host Justin Gimelstob through his California digs in a progressive piece that proved quite revealing. This just in: The Bryan brothers have divorced(!)\n\nBob lives in Miami with his wife, and Mike and his girlfriend abide in the house that the Bryans purchased after their 2003 French Open doubles championship. What's more, most everything in Mike's refrigerator is gluten free. That's right, he is gluten free, tooâand has been for seven years, well before the dieting crazy that Novak Djokovic allegedly started and Andy Murray then copied. \"I was actually the first one to do it, and everyone thought I was a freak,\" Bryan said, to which Gimelstob quipped, \"Now it's a fad.\"\n\nCatch the clip here, including some trophy porn of the Bryans' Grand Slam hardware, Olympic gold medal, and Davis Cup:\n\nElsewhere...\n\nSTATS of the DAY: See Rafael Nadal's 20 Masters final victory scorelines here. He hasn't been pushed beyond straight sets since 2009 in a Masters final that he has won, and beyond straight sets in just eight of those 20 tournament victories, including the first six. He's also served up six \"bagels\" and \"breadsticks\" (6-0 and 6-1 set scores) in these final victories since 2005, suffering a bagel himself but once. In these finals he has beaten Roger Federer six times and Djokovic four times.\n\nQUOTE of the DAY: The \"money\" line (ho, ho) is embedded late in this ESPN write-up on Wimbledon loot, but it's worth getting to, for sure: \"But if the moneyâs got to go anywhere, at least the All England Club is spreading the wealth among its own, and not hiring Nickelback. Game, set, match.\"\n\nThat's right: Forget you, hockey. And are you listening, Victoria Azarenka?\n\nâJonathan Scott (Find me on Twitter @jonscott9.)"
