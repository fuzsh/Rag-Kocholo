        "text": "Alex joined the Luke’s Lobster team in July of 2022. She is from the southern coast of Massachusetts, so quality seafood is something she grew up appreciating. She remembers spending summers digging for clams with her brothers and bringing them home for her parents to cook, which has become an unofficial tradition for her family. Alex takes pride in working hard, remembering faces, and connecting with guests. When she’s not working she’s writing songs at home with her cats or playing her music on a stage for anyone who will listen. Alex also loves watching bad scary movies and eating excessive amounts of peanut butter. She is grateful to be a part of the Luke’s team and family.\n\nTracy has been with Luke's since she was scouted by our Plaza GM Gonca in 2016, and then quickly became an integral part of our Brooklyn Bridge Park shack. As a shift leader in BBP, Tracy was there when we took over the whole smokestack building and is excited to move to the Upper West Side to bring her talents to a new neighborhood. When she's not giving our guests the Luke's experience that we're known for, Tracy is spoiling her granddaughter Brianna.\n\nA born Bostonian, Mickelia started her career at Sweetgreen before joining the Luke's Lobster team in 2021. She was one of the first teammates hired when Imer, the current General Manager at our Boston shack, began managing the shacks in Boston. She's been an incredible asset to our crew, holding down the fort at our Boston shacks.\n\nMickelia loves traveling, spending time with family, listening to music, and dancing. When she isn't at Luke's working hard and pushing her infectiously positive attitude, you can find her in Jamaica :)\n\nFreddy has been in the hospitality industry for 28 years. He comes from brands such as Applebees, Havana Central, and Hale and Hearty. He spent over six years as a General Manager at Don Coqui in White Plains and has also had experience opening a restaurant/club from scratch as a partner.\n\nFreddy is the father to a beautiful 25-year-old daughter, who is following in his footsteps at Don Coqui, and a 20-year-old son. Freddy is also a former standout high school baseball player and played baseball at SUNY New Paltz. He is a big Mets fan, his favorite superhero is Superman, and in his free time, Freddy clears his mind by going to the gym.\n\nRachel is a West Coast native who grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada. Coming from leadership roles in fast-casual concepts, Rachel started with Luke’s in 2023 to immerse Vegas in our values and quality seafood. She started with the team to open and lead the second shack in Las Vegas at MGM’s New York, New York. She studied at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, earning her degree in Education which has allowed her to collide the best of both worlds: the restaurant industry and team development.\n\nIn her free time, Rachel enjoys exploring new places while hiking with her cocker spaniel, Hank, and listening to podcasts and good music. At home, Rachel likes reading a good book or watching documentaries. She spends a lot of time in the kitchen trying new recipes with her family as her taste-testers. Rachel makes a killer chicken marsala.\n\nKevin Bowen is the General Manager of our Portland Pier location. Kevin joined Luke’s in May 2021. He was born in Camden, Maine but grew up within a military family that moved all over the country (Illinois, California, South Carolina, a stop in England, Arkansas, and New York). Kevin returned to Maine for college and never left. Proud father of two amazing daughters that are his entire world. Before Luke’s, Kevin spent 15 years with Ninety Nine Restaurants as a General Managing Partner. When away from work, Kevin likes to hike, golf (terribly), and might be known for taking a vacation or two.\n\nMeet the incredible Johnnie Brown, a man born to add a splash of excitement to every chapter of his life! Born in Oakland, CA and surrounded by a squad of siblings, cousins, aunties, uncles, and grandparents - talk about a family fiesta! Growing up, Jonnie was the life of the party in groups like the Boy Scouts, the debate team, and the track squad, all while playing drums in the church and various music groups.\n\nEmbarking on his career at Sears, Johnnie ascended in the Shipping and Receiving Dept to the illustrious title of Receiving Manager. And guess what? Sears also played matchmaker, introducing him to his wife and the source of his fatherly pride, Juan.\n\nThe journey didn't stop there. From the Alameda County Registrar of Voters to a stint as a Data Analyst in Social Services, he rode the waves until 2009's layoff prompted a detour. Seizing the opportunity, he earned a Medical Assisting certificate, becoming a health superhero at various fairs and clinics. Enter Panera - a bagel run with his wife turned career jackpot! Johnnie skyrocketed from Associate to Assistant General Manager, working at nine Panera locations and opening two in the Bay Area like a culinary maestro. While at Panera, Johnnie multitasked as a minister at Beth Eden Baptist Church, where he welcomed his son Joseph into the world.\n\nIn 2023, life threw a curveball- Johnnie's wife faced surgery, prompting a tough choice to bid adieu to Panera. Destiny had other plans, leading him to Luke's, where he discovered a calling in the food industry. Not once, but twice, Johnnie stumbled into careers he didn't seek, guided by fate and a love for the work and the people he surrounds himself with.\n\nMike Bruna grew up in Northern Virginia and has been working in foodservice management for over 13 years. As a child, he spent his summers fishing and crabbing with his grandparents in Virginia Beach. He made the move to Brooklyn in 2016 with his partner of 15 years, where he enjoys playing piano, wrestling with his cat, and riding his bike around the city. Bringing his passion for both nature and food, Mike found a home that aligns with his personal values at Luke's Lobster. He looks forward to serving you the best Maine-style Lobster Roll you'll ever eat at our Garment District location on Broadway, just south of Time's Square in the heart of New York City.\n\nKristin joined the Luke's team back in the summer of 2015 after years slinging pizzas with California Pizza Kitchen. She started off as the Catering Coordinator in the City of Brotherly Love - where she was born and raised. In 2016 she took on the role of General Manager, and now spends lots of time on Amtrak traveling along the East Coast as our Director of Operations.

Low lobster prices and no market for crab in the 1970s created an opportunity to open a retail fish market where Jeff could sell his lobsters and cook and pick crab. After five years of lobstering, Jeff sold his boat and became a full-time crab processor and soon became the first commercial processor of Jonah Crab in New England. Jeff also held the first two lobster processing licenses in Maine. From 1980 to 2010, Jeff processed over 8 million pounds of seafood annually and had customers in over 20 different countries.

He craved a real Maine-style roll and simply couldn’t find one.\n\nLuke saw an opportunity to bring a casual seafood spot, like the homegrown lobster shacks of his childhood, to New York’s culinary landscape. In 2009, Luke decided to harness his passion for excellent seafood and his family’s 40-plus years in the Maine lobster industry to open the first Luke’s Lobster in the East Village with his dad Jeff, a lobster processor, and Ben Conniff.

Her father is a 3rd generation fisherman. She grew up knowing how to drive a skiff (small boat), haul traps with friends, and be on boats in general. She even had her own student lobster license when she was younger. She always knew she wanted to be part of the lobster industry, so when Rosie heard that Lukes was opening a restaurant in Portland, she applied for a job. She started as a host, took a brief hiatus when Lukes shut down during COVID-19, and once she returned, she worked her way into serving. Rosie finished college while working at the restaurant and became an FOH Manager in December 2023. Rosie was a runner in college, so she now participates in many road races. She even has encouraged Luke's members to join her in forming a team to raise money for Maine Coastal Fishermen and Tri For a Cure.\n\nNoelia was born and raised on the beautiful island of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean. After graduating college, she moved to New York City in 2011 on impulse with $300 to her name. While working for a big retail company, Noelia soon realized that a full-time job wasn’t enough to survive in NYC and she needed a second job, and that’s how her journey at Luke’s Lobster began back in 2015. Noelia started as a delivery driver and teammate and worked her way to becoming a shift leader.\n\nAfter 7 years in NYC, and the last 3 years of those at Luke’s, she made the decision to move to Chicago to be closer to my best friend and transferred to the Luke’s City Hall shack.\n\nWhen not at Luke's, she’s probably at a concert (been to over 70+ concerts and counting), on an adventure with her dog Riley Earp, or yelling at the tv on game days as a die-hard Lakers fan."
