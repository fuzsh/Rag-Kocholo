        "text": "Japanese singer Angela Aki has been enshrined in videogame immortality thanks to her appearance on the Final Fantasy XII soundtrack.\n\nFew things in the world can elevate a musician to the level of super fan adoration as being part of the Final Fantasy legacy, and Ms. Aki has managed to solidify her place in FF history via her captivating performance of the theme song \"\"Kiss Me Good-Bye.\"\n\nWe caught up with Angela for a two-part interview.\n\nIGN Music: How did you get involved with the theme song for FFXII?\n\nI was approached by Mr.Uematsu and Square Enix team about 3 years ago. It's even before my debut had been scheduled. Then they asked me if I would be interested in singing the theme for FINAL FANTASY XII and I said, of course. It's FINAL FANTASY and I'd love to be part of it. When I heard the song that Mr.Uematsu wrote, I was deeply moved. It was such a beautiful melody. He wanted me to write lyrics to it and first thing in my mind was a scene of a new journey after good-bye. That's exactly what I felt after I heard his melody and I structured the words based on it.\n\nIGN Music: How was it to work with the legendary Mr. Uematsu?\n\nIt was very inspiring. He is an amazing person as well as an amazing musician and composer. Anybody who ever met him would say the same thing. He is a bundle of joy. He also has such high spirit and working with him was musically inspiring; He inspired me not to be afraid of being adventurous. When you have a record contract with a major record label, you are expected to write certain types of songs. But Mr. Uematsu said, he'd always done what he wanted to do, not what other people wanted him to do. I was very inspired by his independency.\n\nIGN Music: Would you be willing to sing on another FF soundtrack?\n\nOf course. It's FINAL FANTASY.\n\nIGN Music: What music inspires you?\n\nI don't have to stick to certain genres. I love R&B, I love pop, I love jazz, I love classical. When I listen to a song that my radar catches, I definitely find out who the artist is. But it's not just music that inspires me. I think inspiration also comes from a conversation you have with your friends, the fight you have with your sister, a break up, a new love, etc. It comes from everywhere. You decide to see it or not, feel it or not. I think inspiration is all around you.\n\nIGN Music: Do you tap into different emotions when you sing songs in English as opposed to Japanese?\n\nThe way I write my songs in Japanese is different than the way I write in English. English uses cynical words that are very smart and very sarcastic and the basic foundation is the rhyming structure, whereas Japanese, I think, is more basic and pure. It's like Haiku (Japanese poem). When I write in Japanese, I have a pencil in my heart and I let the heart write a song. But in English, whatever I feel in my heart, I let my heart process it and give it to the head. And I put the pencil in my head and rhyming in the head. It's more formatted because I look for words that rhyme to build songs.\n\nTune in on Monday for the conclusion of our interview with Angela Aki."
