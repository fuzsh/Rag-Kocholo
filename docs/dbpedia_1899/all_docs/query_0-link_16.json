        "text": "Angela Aki's most recent album, Songbook was released on January 11th.\n\nThe biggest difference between this album and all of her previous albums is that this one consists of nothing but cover songs. Many of the songs also appear in previous albums and have been re-recorded. All songs on the album only feature a piano for instrumental.\n\nTrack list:\n\n1. Honesty (originally by Billy Joel)\n\nHonesty first appears in Angela Aki's WHITE album, released this past year. Comparing the two versions, they are both very similar in sound. It's pretty obvious that the song is a cover for those who are familiar with Billy Joel.\n\n2. Will You Dance? (originally by Boz Scaggs)\n\nWill You Dance? is one of Angela Aki's first cover songs. It was first released in her debut single HOME in 2005. For Songbook, the song was re-recorded with obvious differences in the composition.Overall, I think the song sounds better now that it's been reworked.\n\n3. We're All Alone (originally by Boz Scaggs)\n\nWe're All Alone was originally released in the mini-album ONE, then re-released in the album ANSWER. It makes another appearance in Songbook. Unlike the first two tracks, there are no compositional differences between the version. A bit disappointing.\n\n4. Material Girl (originally by Madonna)\n\nThe first brand new cover in the whole album. Between the original and this version, I definitely prefer this version. Although I couldn't even tell what the song was until the chorus.\n\n5. True Colors (originally by Cydi Lauper)\n\nThe second new cover. I'm not especially familiar with Cyndi Lauper, but Angela Aki does an excellent job adapting the song to her own voice and piano.\n\n6. Without You (originally by Badfinger)\n\nOriginally released in the single Kagayaku Hito. I don't even know who Badfinger is, so I will refrain from commenting on the differences. The lyrics are a bit on the cheesy love song side, but that can't really be helped.\n\n7. Today (originally by Smashing Pumpkins)\n\nFirst released in the single Kokoro no Senshi, then again in the album TODAY. The fact that anyone can me a Smashing Pumpkins song sound pretty is incredible. This song is easily one of my favorite Angela Aki songs.\n\n8. Kiss From a Rose (originally by Seal)\n\nFirst released in the single This Love. The go-to of all cover songs. Just about everyone has covered this song. But Angela Aki still makes it her own. There's no difference between the Songbook release and the first one.\n\n9. A Song for You (originally by Leon Russell)\n\nOriginally released in the mini-album ONE. Besides the really nice sliding scale at the beginning of the song, not much to say. It was re-recorded, but the composition wasn't changed. A bit underwhelming.\n\n10. Creep (originally by Radiohead)\n\nA brand new release for Songbook. I've heard better covers of this song, unfortunately. The song wasn't really meant to be played with anything but an electric guitar.\n\n11. Still Fighting It (originally by Ben Folds)\n\nThe fourth new song for the album. There's actually little difference between the original and the cover. Just a little meh for me.\n\n12. It's So Hard Saying Good-Bye to Yesterday (originally by G.C. Cameron)\n\nOriginally released in the single Ai no Kisetsu. I honestly think this song works better as pop than R&B. But that's all I really have to say about it.\n\nOverall:\n\nI was surprised to see a few covers missing, notably, Eyes on Me, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, and Aoi Kage. In fact, I wish Knockin' on Heaven's Door would have been better than A Song for You in this particular album.\n\nI'd only give this particular album 6/10."
