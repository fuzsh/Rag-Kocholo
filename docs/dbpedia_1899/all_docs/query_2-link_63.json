        "text": "Half Japanese and half Italian American, Angela Aki (Kiyomi Aki) is another prominent mixed race celeb in Japan.\n\nEvery year in Japan they have the Kouhaku Utagassen (Red White Song Battle). Its a show that to most Japanese signifies the end of the year, and it reviews all the top songs and oldies, and most of the nation is watching. This past year I listened to Angela Aki's new song : Letter To Your 15 Year Old Self\n\nThe lyrics are particularly meaningful as she sings about a letter she is writing to her 15 year old self, encouraging her past self to stay positive.\n\nTranslation after the jump:\n\nHere is the English Translation:\n\nDear you,\n\nWho's reading this letter\n\nWhere are you and what are you doing now?\n\nFor me who's 15 years old\n\nThere are seeds of worries I can't tell anyone\n\nIf it's a letter addressed to my future self,\n\nSurely I can confide truly to myself\n\nNow, it seems that I'm about to be defeated and cry\n\nFor someone who's seemingly about to disappear\n\nWhose words should I believe in?\n\nThis one-and-only heart has been broken so many times\n\nIn the midst of this pain, I live the present\n\nDear you,\n\nThank you\n\nI have something to tell the 15-year-old you\n\nIf you continue asking what and where you should be going\n\nYou'll be able to see the answer\n\nThe rough seas of youth may be tough\n\nBut row your boat of dreams on\n\nTowards the shores of tomorrow\n\nNow, please don't be defeated and please don't shed a tear\n\nDuring these times when you're seemingly about to disappear\n\nJust believe in your own voice\n\nFor me as an adult, there are sleepless nights when I'm hurt\n\nBut I'm living the bittersweet present\n\nThere's meaning to everything in life\n\nSo build your dreams without fear\n\nKeep on believing\n\nSeems like I'm about to be defeated and cry\n\nFor someone who's seemingly about to disappear\n\nWhose words should I believe in?\n\nPlease don't be defeated and please don't shed a tear\n\nDuring these times when you're seemingly about to disappear\n\nJust believe in your own voice\n\nNo matter era we're in\n\nThere's no running away from sorrow\n\nSo show your smile, and go on living the present\n\nGo on living the present"
