        "text": "Happy birthday to the wonderful Jpop artist Angela Aki!!!\n\nShe turns 30 yesterday. =D\n\nAngela Aki was born in Japan to an Italian-American mother on September 15, 1977, but has a Japanese father. She is bilingual in both Japanese and English since she moved to Hawaii when she was 16. She released an Indies album in the US in 2000 and in 2006 released another album, titled One, in Japan. She was recognized by Nobuo Uematsu, the very much acclaimed Japanese composer for the music of Final Fantasy, and was signed to Sony Records. She also had the privilege of sing the theme song to Final Fantasy XII. She has also signed with Tofu Records in order to release music in the US. Since her debut she has released four albums and seven singles, and still continues to produce music.\n\nI positively ADORE Angela Aki. She has a beautiful voice and makes wonderful songs. Many of her songs have piano acoompaniments, and I’m a sucker for piano songs. She has great range and power and can really deliver a beautiful performance. She is one of my utmost favorite artists. Her only drawback is that her videos are pretty bland. ._.;\n\n1. Kiss Me Goodbye This is a really great song. Angela’s vocals are beautiful and the melody is great. It just stays in your mind for a long time. It’s a beautiful song.\n\nLyrics + Translation\n\n2. Home\n\nThis is a great song. As always Angela’s voice is wonderful. This song is so heart-warming and lovely that you just can’t help but love it. I have the Piano version, so I’m sharing that with you. =D\n\nLyrics and Translation\n\n3. Warning\n\nLOVE THIS SONG! It’s in English, and it has a wonderful melody. And I love the Piano. =D I highly recommend this song! The video is live, and it’s great to see that seh sings just as good live as she does recorded.\n\nLyrics\n\nDownload\n\nAngela Aki - Kiss Me Goodbye (English)\n\nAngela Aki - Home -Piano Version-\n\nAngela Aki - Warning\n\nTags:angela aki, jpop\n\nHow do I feel?:amused\n\nWhat I'm listening to::Sowelu - I Will"
