        "text": "Angela Aki's song 'Without You' delves into the profound emotional turmoil that accompanies the end of a relationship. The lyrics poignantly capture the sense of something missing, as the singer reflects on the distance that has grown between her and her partner. The phrase 'Nanika ga tarinai kyori wo okitai' translates to 'I want to fill the distance where something is missing,' indicating a longing to bridge the emotional gap that has formed. This sets the stage for the inevitable countdown to their separation, a period marked by silence and unspoken feelings.\n\nAs the song progresses, the singer's inner strength is tested by the passage of time, which only deepens the silence and emotional void. Despite the physical separation, she believes that their hearts remain connected, a sentiment that underscores the enduring nature of their bond. The repeated refrain 'I can't live, if living is without you' emphasizes the depth of her despair and inability to imagine life without her partner. This line, borrowed from the classic song by Badfinger and popularized by Harry Nilsson and Mariah Carey, adds a layer of universality to the song's theme of heartache and loss.\n\nThe imagery of 'kawaita tsuchi' or 'dry soil' symbolizes the barren state of their relationship, which has struggled to thrive despite their efforts. The singer had hoped that their love would grow into a 'takumashii ki' or 'strong tree,' but it has remained stunted. The final lines, 'No I can't forget this evening / Or your face as you were leaving,' poignantly capture the lasting impact of the moment of separation, highlighting the enduring pain and the way such memories linger. Angela Aki's heartfelt delivery and the evocative lyrics make 'Without You' a powerful exploration of love, loss, and the difficulty of moving on."
