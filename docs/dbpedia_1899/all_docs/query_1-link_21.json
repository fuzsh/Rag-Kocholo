        "text": "Friday, August 28 is a big day for country music artist Eric Ethridge. It’s the day that his brand new single (from his upcoming album) “Kiss Me Goodbye” is available everywhere via Anthem Records/Anthem Entertainment.\n\nThis Ontario native, not only is releasing what is sure to be another smash hit, but he is also leaving his mark within the Canadian country music scene, Ethridge is up for multiple 2020 CMAOntario awards including Single of the Year, Male Artist of the Year and Music Video of the Year (which will take place in October).\n\n“Kiss Me Goodbye” was written by Ethridge, Lindsay Rimes (Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, Lindsay Ell) and Matthew Joseph Rogers (Brett Eldredge, Randy Houser, Dallas Smith) and is the “punchy, love-struck” follow-up to his previous hit single, “Dream Girl.” On a side note, “Dream Girl” has been streamed over 2.5 million times globally since its release earlier this year.\n\nSays Ethridge of “Kiss Me Goodbye,”\n\n“From the moment we finished writing this song I knew we had something special. It was one of those days in the writing room where everything just flowed, and I haven’t been able to stop listening to it since! I wanted to create something that would lift a person’s mood and make then want to dance, especially during these wild times we’re currently living in!”\n\nAlong with his loyal fan base, anyone who listens to “Kiss Me Goodbye” will also be dancing to and singing right along. Get ready to have some fun!\n\nAlso, congratulations on Ethridge and his wife Kalsey Kulyk on their new family home … a travelling van with a rooftop stage so they can perform anywhere their fans request a show."
