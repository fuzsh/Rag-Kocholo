It will feature a translation workshop of Western hit songs, and will also give viewers the chance to enjoy music.\n\nAngela Aki is Italian-American-Japanese singer who started out her career in the United States before moving back to Japan, making history as the first artist to ever perform in the famous Nippon Budukon Hall, solo (with just her piano, sans backup singers, band or opening act.)"
