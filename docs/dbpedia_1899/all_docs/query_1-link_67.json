        "text": "In 1976, Elton John teamed up with British singer Kiki Dee to record the enduring and infectious pop duet “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.” Released as a standalone single in June 1976, the Motown-inspired tune rocketed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on August 7 of that year.\n\nThe track became John’s sixth single to top the Hot 100. “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” knocked The Manhattans’ soulful breakup ballad “Kiss and Say Goodbye” from the No. 1 spot, then spent four weeks at the pinnacle of the chart. It was replaced at No. 1 by The Bee Gees’ disco classic “You Should Be Dancing.”\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n[RELATED: Behind the Album: Too Low for Zero, Elton John’s Stirring 1980s Comeback LP]\n\n“Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” also was Elton’s first-ever No. 1 hit in his U.K. homeland. It also topped the singles charts in many other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\nThe song was co-written by John and his longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms Ann Orson and Carte Blanche. The track was recorded during the sessions for John’s 11th studio album, Blue Moves, but was included on that record. The B-side was another non-album track, “Snow Queen,” which also featured Dee.\n\nElton and Kiki filmed a popular music video featuring them performing the song in a recording studio. At one point in the goofy clip, John tries to show Dee how to do the hand jive.\n\nMore About Kiki Dee\n\nPrior to “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” with John, Dee had enjoyed some success as a solo artist. Her biggest hit in the U.S. was “I’ve Got the Music in Me,” which reached No. 12 on the Hot 100 in 1974.\n\nDee, who signed to Elton’s Rocket label in the early 1970s, also contributed backing vocals to several of his songs. These include “All the Young Girls Love Alice,” from John’s 1973 album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and most of the tracks from his 1975 record Rock of the Westies.\n\nDee later sang backing vocals on John’s 1992 album The One, and then collaborated with him on a version Cole Porter’s “True Love” for Elton’s 1993 Duets record.\n\nDee also sang “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” with John at the final U.S. show of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour. The event took place in November 2022 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nMore About “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart”\n\nIn 1977, “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group category. It also won the Best Pop Song honor at the U.K.’s prestigious Ivor Novello Awards.\n\nOn a 1978 episode of The Muppet Show, John teamed up with Miss Piggy for a hilarious performance of the tune. In the middle of their rendition, Miss Piggy turns to the camera and yells, “Eat your heart out, Kiki!”\n\nAn updated version of “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” featuring John singing with famed drag queen RuPaul, appeared on Elton’s aforementioned Duets album. Produced by Giorgio Moroder, the track reached No. 3 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, and No. 7 on the U.K. singles tally."
