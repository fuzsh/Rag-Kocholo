        "text": "What is your name?\n\nMy name is Violeta Skya.\n\nWhat is your genre of music?\n\nI’d like to think of my music as ‘pop’ because each song’s a new story and I guess you can fit all those sounds in that genre. This is my debut single and I tried to experiment a little bit with different sounds but I think it’s still very pop.\n\nGive us a little bio about you.\n\nI have been trained as a classical pianist when I was very young but then I got into singing a couple of years later. I’ve been writing and playing music for a long time in function and cover bands as well as successfully performing in many different international singing contests. I only just recently started recording and performing my original songs in London.\n\nTell us more about your music.\n\nI really enjoy making music so i just follow my instincts when writing. There’s a different story behind every song and for me the mood and the message of the song is very important. Also, I prefer not to be too direct with my lyrics so people can interpret them in their own way.\n\nYour brand new DEBUT single ‘Kiss Me’ is set to release on 30th August 17, tell us the meaning behind the track.\n\nThe idea was to make a dark dance track. I wanted to express one of the wild sides of my personality which I am sure everyone can identify with.\n\nWhat was the writing process like?\n\nThis song was written with my producer and dear friend José Cubides. When I arrived at the studio I had a beat and the idea in my head, he added a catchy bass line and we took it from there. The melody and lyrics were written really fast and organically and when I showed my idea to José he loved it.\n\nWhat was the recording process like?\n\nIt was a really enjoyable process. Everything came very naturally as the atmosphere in the studio is always very friendly and relaxed. I want all my songs to be very honest and personal and I felt that I was able to express myself in the way I wanted.\n\nYou will also be dropping the video, what was filming like?\n\nWe only took one day to shoot the video in a small studio in London. We were a great team so that made the shooting very fun. We were dancing to the song all of the time, free styling, letting ourselves go with the flow so we ended up contributing loads of new ideas. I’d also like to thank my friend Polina as she was very helpful throughout the whole video shoot.\n\nAny memorable moments during filming?\n\nIt was really good fun so I think all of it was very memorable, really enjoyed working with that team so I hopefully we will work together again.\n\nHow was the planning of the video shoot?\n\nThe whole concept was created together with my videographer and friend Jay Kristoffer Magleo. Basically, I wanted the video to be shot in a studio with black background. I imagined it to be subtle, misty but sexy at the same. The idea of making it black and white made it even classier I think.\n\nThe second step was to find a male model so when I announced the casting I got numerous replies but to be honest once I saw Janis Zeilins I knew he is the one we were looking for.\n\nWill we see a EP or Album this year?\n\nI would like to go to step by step for the moment, I want to release this single and then make the next decision from there. However, I have been recording plenty of new material I want to release soon.\n\nIf so what can we expect from it?\n\nI’m finally finding my own signature sound so I think there is a lot of room for expressing myself now. I could say that I’m very excited about releasing the new material as it is very authentic and personal but edgy at the same time.\n\nDo you have any gigs or a tour coming up?\n\nYes, I’m planning on playing gigs more regularly in the near future. The plan is to start doing it from October this year. I’ve started adapting the song to be performed live with my band so we’re really looking forward to performing soon.\n\nIf so where will you be heading?\n\nI’m still planning it but I’d say we’ll be performing in London mainly.\n\nWhat else can we expect from you?\n\nThere’s loads of exciting things coming up with my music so you just need to keep an eye on my new announcements on my social media pages. I believe the best is yet to come.\n\nAre you a signed?\n\nI’m considering some offers but at the moment I’m a fully DIY artist.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nIt’s hard to mention only a few as I’m always getting information from everything I listen to. I’d say that maybe pop and R’nB music artists such as Beyonce, Rihanna and Alicia Keys even though our styles are not similar.\n\nWhere do you see yourself now in 5 Years?\n\nObviously, I am going to fully dedicate myself to making music and go as far as possible in my music career. I just finished my second music degree at BIMM London and decided to stay in London, as it is the centre for me, of music in Europe. Also, in September I am going to the US for a while so I will meet new people there and see what life will bring.\n\nWhen you’re not doing music, what do you do?\n\nI love doing artistic and creative things that let me express myself. I really like fashion, and modelling for photoshoots. Also, I have other interests like living a healthy lifestyle and psychology.\n\nWhere would your dream venue to play in your hometown?\n\nIt would be special to play in any place in my hometown because it is my home and I will always have a special connection with it. I hope it happens soon.\n\nWould you be up for collaborating with an unsigned artist or band? If so how can they contact you?\n\nYes, of course. I am always up for new creative things, as you never know how cool the outcome can be.\n\nI am also currently remixing one of my other songs and would love to have a rapper in it. It’s easy to contact me on any of my social media pages.\n\nWhat was the song you listened to most that influenced you to go more in to the music scene?\n\nThere wasn’t just the one song but I remember when I was two or three years old I was very impressed by everything that Madonna did. She was so striking, free and different. Then I decided that I would love to be able to express myself through music as well.\n\nWhere is your dream festival to perform?\n\nIt’s a tricky question but I think big so maybe Glastonbury and Coachella.\n\nWhat made you go in to music?\n\nI can’t really remember one particular thing exactly because it was the path I wanted to follow since my early childhood. It was more a matter of time and coincidence that led me to where I am now.\n\nWhat’s the best advice you have ever been given?\n\nSet your priorities and do one step at the time. Do one thing at the time. But do it well.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring musicians not just about the industry also just as an artist/band?\n\nI think one of the most important things is to be honest and real with your music and songwriting. Being sincere is essential as people can sense that and gravitate towards the ‘read deal’.\n\nWhat quote or saying do you always stick by?\n\n“Nobody is you and that is your power” by Dave Grohl"
