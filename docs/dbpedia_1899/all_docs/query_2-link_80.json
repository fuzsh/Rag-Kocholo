        "text": "I grew up listening to the wonderful vocalist which is Angela Aki. Born to an Italian mother and a Japanese father, Aki is considered one of the most popular mixed race singers of the 2000s in Japan along with the likes of Crystal Kay and Anna Tsuchiya. She final released a new single after years of living in America, to study music. A full surprise album was released a few weeks after.\n\nThis album sounds like a Classical music theory class. Angela is still in her element of piano playing pop songs however, this time around a mature tone has taken place of the pop we would usually hear in her earlier works. Everything sounds slick and tied together in production while Aki's piano playing is the center of it all. I can hear the musical director in her new music when it comes to the vocal layerings in her own vocals as well as the featured vocalists that sing on this album. The Orchestra sounds bolder than any of her other songs but there isn't a real uptempo song on Sings. We get maybe one track thats a little groovy. I'm pointing this out but it really doesn't matter because the album is a solid listen. Angela's music dedication is unmatched in vocals and musicality.\n\nI still stick by what I have been saying for years: Angela Aki is one of the best Japanese vocalists of all time. Aki popped back to the industry when she was needed the most. She might not even realize that she was needed but, I really missed her music. Home is still my favorite song by her."
