        "text": "The Casinos Vinyl Record Memories.\n\n\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\"\n\n\"Sweeten my coffee with a morning Kiss...\n\nSoften my dreams with your sighs.\"\n\nWhew!\n\nTime has made this song even better. A Classic vinyl record.\n\nThe interpretation of this song could be seen as a lover coming to terms with what may be an imminent breakup, but not before they have one more night together. The lyrics seem to express the singer's deep love and attachment, requesting for one more chance to show his feelings to hold, kiss, and be with his beloved before they part ways. The one asking for parting, referred to as \"you\" in the song, can tell the singer \"goodbye\" only after all of these requests have been fulfilled.\n\nThe song beautifully encapsulates the emotions of possibly losing love with lyrics such as \"If you must go, I won't grieve/If you wait a lifetime before you leave.‚Äù It emphasizes the singer's love and willingness to wait their whole life for their partner, ready to accept their decision, even if it means a goodbye. The song sings of acceptance, deep love, and a glimpse of hope.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that music, and its interpretation, can be subjective, and others might view this song differently based on their personal experiences and emotions.\n\nThe original group was from Cincinnati, Ohio, led by Gene Hughes. After leaving the group, Gene Hughes became a country music promoter.\n\nHe died in 2008 at age 67 following complications from an automobile accident.\n\nThe Casinos Vinyl Record Memories.\n\nIs this the best cover?\n\nIt's my pick, however, it should also be noted that the Eddy Arnold version was a number 1 country hit a year later in 1968 and was a Top 5 country nearly 30 years later in 1996 by Neal McCoy.\n\nThe song has been covered and released on albums by many artists including, Johnny Tillotson's version in 1964 on his album The Tillotson Touch. Andy Williams released a version in 1967 on his album, Born Free, The 5th Dimension recorded the song in 1973, but it was not released until 2004 as a bonus track on their The Ultimate 5th Dimension album.\n\nFreddy Fender recorded the song in 1974 on his album, Before the Next Teardrop Falls, Perry Como recorded a version on his 1975 album, Just Out of Reach, and Glen Campbell recorded the song as a medley with Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds' Don't Pull Your Love. This song was a number 27 pop hit and went to number 1 on the Easy Listening chart in 1976. The medley also peaked at number 4 on the country chart.\n\nFrankie Valli recorded a cover version of this song for his 2007 solo album of covers, Romancing The 60's, and Rosanne Cash recorded a live version at the Franklin Theater, Franklin, TN on March 24, 2016. This version appears on the Vector Recordings album \"A Tribute to John D. Loudermilk\".\n\nFor a live performance, this is as close to the original vinyl record as you will find. Even the organ player does just a fantastic job on this performance.\n\nEnjoy the Casinos vinyl record memories with the lyrics provided...\n\n\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\"\n\n1967 #6 song for The Casinos\n\nWritten by John D. Loudermilk\n\nKiss me each morning for a million years\n\nHold me each evening by your side\n\nTell me you'll love me for a million years\n\nThen if it don't work out...Then if it don't work out\n\nThen you can tell me goodbye\n\nSweeten my coffee with a morning kiss\n\nSoften my dreams with your sighs\n\nTell me you'll love me for a million years\n\nThen if it don't work out...Then if it don't work out\n\nThen you can tell me goodbye\n\nOrgan solo...\n\nIf you must go, oh no, I won't grieve\n\nIf you wait a lifetime before you leave\n\nThen if you must go...Mmm, I won't tell you no\n\nJust so that we can say we tried\n\nTell me you'll love me for a million years\n\nThen if it don't work out...Then if it don't work out\n\nThen you can tell me goodbye\n\nEver thought of having your own website?
