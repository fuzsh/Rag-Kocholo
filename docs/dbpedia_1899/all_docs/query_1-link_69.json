        "text": "Elyse Saunders isn’t afraid to get her hands dirty. The Canadian country firecracker is kicking up a storm with her latest single “Dirt,” a gritty anthem that’s as infectious as it is irreverent. Fresh off her Female Artist of the Year win at the 2024 CMAOntario Awards, Saunders is digging deep into the fertile soil of country music, unearthing a sound that’s equal parts ’90s nostalgia and modern swagger. With her boots firmly planted in the rich loam of the genre, she’s cultivating a reputation as an artist who’s not afraid to sling a little mud – musically speaking, of course.\n\nWhen asked about the inspiration behind “Dirt,” Saunders reveals, “I was going through something and wanted to turn the experience into something a little more light-hearted. We had a lot of fun playing around with the idea of dirt, like the dirt we walk on, and the dirt that we’re working through in our personal lives. We had some good laughs coming up with some pretty fun stories that we thought would capture the comical side of what rumors can turn into. At the core of the message, it feels empowering to know that we’re all working through our own problems and shouldn’t worry too much about what other people might think, as they’re all going through it too!”\n\nSaunders’ musical style is a unique blend of influences, rooted in ’90s country but infused with elements from various genres. She explains, “I was definitely influenced by ’90s country and would also listen to a lot of other genres growing up. So now, whatever chapter I’m in, I love to bring a little bit of that outside influence to each of my songs, while holding onto the ’90s country roots and values. Some of the icons I looked up to who were really good at that as well were Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, Carrie Underwood, Maren Morris and Miranda Lambert.”\n\nThe lyrics in “Dirt” tackle the often-thorny topic of gossip with a relatable and somewhat comical approach. Saunders elaborates on the message she wanted to convey through this song: “I wanted to paint the picture of how funny rumors can really be and believe that we’re all dealing with our own fair share of life’s dirt. It’s important to embrace it and not worry about what others think as we’re all going through it. At the end of the day, the only one that can judge your dirt is yourself, and God!”\n\n“Dirt” has already garnered significant industry recognition, being selected as a top 10 Country finalist for Nashville’s NSAI competition. When asked about this prestigious acknowledgment of her songwriting, Saunders beams, “It’s awesome to know that my music is making an impact. To know that people are relating to my music and it makes them feel something, is the biggest compliment to an artist and songwriter. My mission is to try and make this place a bit better by sharing music that not only means something to me, but I believe can help people in some way.”\n\nThe success of “Dirt” follows on the heels of her breakout early 2024 release “Never Have I Ever,” which not only charted at Canadian radio but also reached an impressive #6 on the Australian national radio airplay charts. Reflecting on this international success, Saunders shares, “It was an amazing experience to see that happen. It was my first time releasing music to Australian radio and to know that they loved the song so much meant a lot. I knew that it was a special song the day that we wrote it and I had a feeling that it would do great things, but you never truly know what that looks like until it happens!”\n\nSaunders’ recent win as Female Artist of the Year at the 2024 CMAOntario Awards marks a significant milestone in her career. Describing the experience, she says, “It was an incredible night and a full circle moment for me. Female Artist of the Year is truly one of the highest honors and to know that my industry and music peers voted for me, really means a lot to me. As an independent artist, it’s been a pile of work to get to this point in my journey and it gives me a boost to keep going and climbing towards more of the goals I want to reach.”\n\nThe award-winning streak doesn’t stop there for Saunders. Last year, she clinched a CMAOntario Award and three Mississauga Music Awards. Reflecting on the impact of these accolades, she notes, “Video of the Year was my very first CMAOntario award, and to have the support of the Mississauga Music Awards these past several years means a lot to me. I grew up in the Mississauga music scene and have had a village of people rooting for me along the way, so to have them bring highlight to my work before the rest of the industry did was pretty special.”\n\nIn a significant career move, Saunders recently signed her first publishing deal with Arts & Crafts Music Publishing. Discussing this new partnership, she enthuses, “I was so excited to partner with this group as they are really passionate about the artists that they get behind! It should help me to continue collaborating with other artists and writers that I haven’t had the opportunity to work with before, as well as put my music forward to sync in the TV and film world. Not only am I an artist but I’m also a songwriter, so this team will help to bring more attention to my catalog as a writer first as well as a recording artist.”\n\nSaunders’ journey to success has been a decade-long labor of love. When asked about what kept her motivated during challenging times, she reflects, “Faith, the love for what I do and refusal to take no for an answer. It’s been incredibly challenging at times but I always knew that if I worked hard enough, the perseverance would pay off and I’m now getting the chance to experience the fruit. What I’ve come to know about this career path is that it not only shapes your work as a creator but as a person and I wouldn’t be the same person I am today without music.”\n\nThe visual aspect of Saunders’ artistry has also been gaining traction, with her music videos receiving regular rotation on CMT Australia and features on CMT Nashville. Expressing her excitement about this exposure, she says, “So cool! One of my favorite things was to watch music videos growing up and one of my favorite channels to do that was CMT. Music videos are a fun way to bring a song to life and there’s so many ways you can do it. I loved it so much that I would create my own home-made music videos as a kid! Now getting to make professional music videos with other collaborators, I truly have a blast and I’m totally in my element!”\n\nLooking ahead, Saunders is set to perform at the Boots & Hearts Country Music Festival, kicking off the Front Porch Stage performances on Saturday, August 10th. The festival, running from August 8-11, will see her sharing the bill with big names like Thomas Rhett and Matchbox Twenty. Anticipating the event, she shares, “Oh my gosh! I’m so excited for it. This year has been full of bucket list moments and this is another one of those. Just to be there playing their stage is super exciting to me and then to know that I’m helping to warm up the stage for Thomas Rhett and Matchbox Twenty is a pretty cool moment. The band and I have a fun show in the works and I’m looking forward to being there, seeing the Boots & Hearts fam, and taking in other shows.”\n\nWith over four million streams to date, Saunders is clearly striking a chord with fans. Reflecting on what makes her music resonate with people, she muses, “I hope that people like the messages and sounds of my music. I try to keep it fresh and write about all kinds of things that I’ve experienced and I’m sure the biggest reason why they resonate with it is because it connects to who they are and their story in some way.”\n\nSaunders’ live shows have gained a reputation for being memorable and high-energy affairs. Describing what fans can expect from her concerts, she explains, “They can expect to hear a mixture of my hits, new songs that I’m sharing for the first time, as well as some cover songs that we like to put a spin on. I also love to create moments that include the audience and to make them feel like they’re part of the show and just give people a good time. It’s important to me that I give my audience that experience and that they get to know who I am a bit better too.”\n\nBeyond her own recordings, Saunders has proven herself as a versatile songwriter with 16 outside cuts by other artists in multiple genres. Discussing how her songwriting process differs when writing for herself versus others, she reveals, “A big part of writing for others is when I get to know the artist. I usually like to look over their socials to get an overall sense of who they are and what makes them special and then I like to take some time at the beginning of the session to know what their life is like and what they are currently up to. Once I know that then I try to write from a place that I think resonates with them and their unique presence and story.”\n\nSaunders splits her songwriting time between Nashville and Canada, drawing inspiration from both music scenes. Comparing the two, she observes, “I’ve been going back and forth to Nashville and Canada since the beginning of my career and it’s definitely had an influence on my craft and set the bar for what I wanted to strive to be. As Nashville is the country music hub, I think it’s important to be immersed in the scene and understand the culture. Because it’s a city that never sleeps and breathes country music, I believe that there’s a different quality of creativity and collaboration that exists and you can’t help but be influenced by its electric energy.”\n\nAs an independent artist who has found success, Saunders offers advice to other indie musicians working to make it in the industry: “I think it’s so important to continue to develop your craft as a creator and embrace the business side of your work as they don’t work without each other. Your why and purpose will be the reason that no’s will never stop you and persistence does pay off. Just keep believing in you, keep learning and keep going! You’ll get there!” Looking to the future, Saunders teases, “I have more new music coming and more shows in the works. If you haven’t yet, follow me on your socials and keep in touch. I want to hear from you! That’s the best way to see where I’ll be and what I’ll be up to next.”"
