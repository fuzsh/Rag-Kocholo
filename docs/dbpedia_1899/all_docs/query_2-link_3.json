        "text": "coa mix\n\nIn a corner of this world\n\nSHARE:\n\nIn 2014, approximately 10 years after her hiatus in Japan, Angela Aki announced that she would be resuming her activities in Japan at the same time as participating in the music production for the Toho musical \"In This Corner of the World.\" On February 7, 2024 (Wednesday), the musical song “Everywhere in this World” will be released.\n\nThey made their major debut with the single \"HOME\" in 2005, and since the Beatles' first performance in Japan in December of the following year, they have been a hot topic since their debut, including their first-ever piano solo live performance at Nippon Budokan. Singer-songwriter Angela Aki ( angela-aki.online ).\n\nIn 2008, she released the single ``Letter ~Dear 15 Kimi e~'' NHK Minna no Uta (August-September 2008 song) ~ 75th (2008) NHK National School Music Contest ``Junior High School Division'' theme song ~ received a platinum disc. Even now, 15 years after its release, it continues to be sung throughout Japan as a national chorus and graduation song. In 2013, they announced that they would cease their activities in Japan. In 2014, he moved to the United States to study composition from scratch in order to pursue his long-held goal of becoming a musical musician. In 2016, he took part in Walt Disney's short musical productions as a lyricist, taking a step forward as a musical music writer, and began working on Broadway production projects. He has also been active as a lyricist and composer, including providing songs to Japanese artists.\n\nIn 2024, he will resume his activities in Japan by participating in the production of the Toho musical \"In This Corner of the World\", and will release the musical song \"Everywhere in this World\" on February 7th (Wednesday). This work is based on the Toho musical “In This Corner of the World” which will be performed across Japan from May 2024.https://www.tohostage.com/konosekai/) A song written for. This is a rearranged version of a song created for the main performance of the musical and sung by himself. In other words, this is a work in which \"singer-songwriter\" Angela Aki sings the songs she created as a \"musical music writer.\"\n\nIt has been about 10 years since the best album “TAPESTRY OF SONGS-THE BEST OF ANGELA AKI-” was released in Japan in March 2014, and the first new song was the single “Yume Endu Ai no Hajime” released in July 2013. Please look forward to this work, which will be the first time in a while.\n\nRegarding the restart in Japan for the first time in 10 years, Angela Aki herself said, ``I have decided to participate in the musical ``In This Corner of the World'' as the music director.\n\nI wanted to become a music writer for musicals, so I entered a music college in the United States 10 years ago to re-learn composition. After that learning experience, I am truly honored to have come across this wonderful work.\n\nWith the announcement of this work, we will resume our activities in Japan.\n\nWriting songs as a singer-songwriter and writing songs as a musical composer. The biggest difference is perspective. When I write a song as a singer-songwriter, I write it from my personal perspective, but when it comes to musicals, it's from the character's perspective. Try to think about what the character is feeling in which scene, from that point of view, and think about it using sounds rather than words. I try to find out what kind of sound is being made at that time. Although it was difficult, I felt that it was extremely rewarding.\n\nMusical is a comprehensive art. Everyone involved searches for answers and creates the work together, rewriting and rewriting it over and over again. This joy, this experience, is not something that you can do once and end with, ``That was fun.'' I want to continue making musical music for the rest of my life while sticking to Japanese. That's what I think. ” commented.\n\nAngela Aki has added new skills as a singer-songwriter and musical music writer, and is resuming her activities in Japan for the first time in 10 years. It is truly a \"restart.\" With this restart, we also launched SNS such as official Instagram and X. The official homepage and YouTube will be renewed, and more information will be disseminated to the world than ever before. Angela Aki has faced music from various angles during her 10 years of living in the United States and has grown stronger, so please keep an eye on her future activities.\n\nAngela Aki Angela Aki\n\nBicultural (Japanese and American) unique singer-songwriter/musical music writer\n\nBorn to a Japanese father and an Italian-American mother.\n\nThey made their major debut in 2005 with the single \"HOME\". Their debut album “Home” was released in 2006 and became a long-seller, selling over 600,000 copies. ``Final Fantasy XII,'' whose insert song was ``Kiss Me Good-Bye'' co-written with Nobuo Uematsu, a composer who worked on the popular game series ``Final Fantasy,'' became a worldwide hit. In December of the same year, since the Beatles' first performance in Japan, he held his first ever solo piano performance live at the traditional Nippon Budokan, which has a half-century history as a concert hall, and was a great success. He has established himself as a highly accomplished and unique live artist. Their second album ``TODAY'' released in 2007 reached number 1 on the Oricon chart for the first time. In 2008, the single ``Letters ~Haikei Jugo no Kimi e~'', which was written as a theme song for the ``NHK National School Music Contest Junior High School Division'', received a platinum disc. It became a big hit and a long-seller that transcended generations. Their third album ``ANSWER'', released the following year in 2009, reached number 1 on the Oricon charts for the second time in a row. Since then, they have continued to energetically release their 5th album ``WHITE'', 6th album ``SONGBOOK'', and 7th album ``BLUE''.\n\nIn 2013, they announced to their fans that they would be suspending their activities in Japan indefinitely starting the following fall. In 2014, she released her first best album ``TAPESTRY OF SONGS-THE BEST OF ANGELA AKI'', which is the culmination of 10 years of activities in Japan. After performing at the Nippon Budokan on August 4th, he went on an indefinite hiatus as a singer-songwriter, and then moved to the United States. I started learning music from scratch in order to create a musical piece, which had been my goal for some time.\n\nIn 2016, he participated in the production of Walt Disney's short musical \"Out of Shadowland\" as a lyricist along with composer Jeanine Tesori, who has won a Tony Award for numerous Broadway productions. It was shown on the Hangar Stage at Tokyo Disney Sea, and he took his first step as a musical composer. After that, he began to be involved in Broadway production projects.
