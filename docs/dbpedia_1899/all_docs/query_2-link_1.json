        "text": "Angela Aki (アンジェラ・アキ) is a female singer-songwriter from Tokushima. She is half Italian-American on her mother's side, and her father is Aki Kiyoshi, owner and founder of the Aeon English teaching school. She lived in Hawaii as a teenager and Washington, D.C. starting in college. She returned to Japan to become a singer at age 26 in 2003 and made her major debut in 2005 with the single \"HOME\".\n\nIn 2006, she gave the first ever solo piano live performance at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, and in 2008, her song \"Tegami ~Haikei 15 no Kimi e~\", which she wrote for the junior high school division of the NHK National School Music Contest, became a hit and was awarded a Platinum Disc.\n\nHowever, in the midst of such success, Angela announced in 2013 that she would be taking a break from her activities in Japan. In 2014, she moved to the United States to relearn composition from the ground up to become a musical musician, which had always been her goal. Then, in 2016, she took her first steps as a musical music writer when she joined Walt Disney's short musical production as a lyricist and began working on Broadway projects. She has since been active in providing songs to Japanese artists.\n\nShe will resume her activities in Japan by producing music for the musical In This Corner of the World, which will be performed nationwide starting in May 2024.[1] Upon announcing the resumption of her activities in Japan, she commented, \"I would like to continue making musical music for the rest of my life, while sticking to the Japanese language\". Angela will also release her new song \"Kono Sekai no Achikochi ni\" (この世界のあちこちに; Here and There in This World) for digital distribution on February 7, 2024. It is a song written for In This Corner of the World. Angela has rearranged the song used in the musical, and will release the version she sings herself. This will be the first time in about 10 years that Angela has released a new song.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAlbums[]\n\n[2006.06.14] Home\n\n[2007.09.19] TODAY\n\n[2009.02.25] ANSWER\n\n[2010.09.08] LIFE\n\n[2011.09.28] WHITE\n\n[2012.07.18] BLUE\n\n[2024.04.24] Angela Aki sings \"Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni\" (アンジェラ・アキ sings 『この世界の片隅に』)\n\nBest Albums[]\n\n[2012.01.11] SONGBOOK\n\n[2014.03.05] TAPESTRY OF SONGS - THE BEST OF ANGELA AKI\n\nMini Albums[]\n\n[2005.03.09] ONE\n\nSingles[]\n\n[2000.01.04] These Words\n\n[2005.09.14] HOME\n\n[2006.01.18] Kokoro no Senshi (心の戦士)\n\n[2006.03.15] Kiss Me Good-Bye\n\n[2006.05.31] This Love\n\n[2007.03.07] Sakurairo (サクラ色)\n\n[2007.05.23] Kodoku no Kakera (孤独のカケラ)\n\n[2007.07.11] Tashikani (たしかに)\n\n[2008.09.17] Tegami ~Haikei Juugo no Kimi e~ (手紙 ～拝啓 十五の君へ～)\n\n[2009.09.16] Ai no Kisetsu (愛の季節)\n\n[2010.04.14] Kagayaku Hito (輝く人)\n\n[2011.06.08] Hajimari no Ballad / I Have a Dream (始まりのバラード/I Have a Dream)\n\n[2012.07.11] Kokuhaku (告白)\n\n[2013.07.03] Yume no Owari Ai no Hajimari (夢の終わり 愛の始まり)\n\nDigital Singles[]\n\n[2024.02.07] Kono Sekai no Achikochi ni (この世界のあちこちに; Here and There in This World)\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
