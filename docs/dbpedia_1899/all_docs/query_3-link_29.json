In 2005 she was announced as the singer of Final Fantasy XII theme song, Kiss Me Good-Bye. Angela Aki is completely bilingual in English and Japanese, as she was raised in Japan and moved to Hawaii at the age of sixteen. She originally released an Indies album in the USA in 2000, called These Words, which gained a lot of critical acclaim. Five years later in Japan, she released an Indies mini-album under Virgo Music entitled ONE, which is what alerted Nobuo Uematsu to her music. Angela Aki is now signed under Sony Japan."
