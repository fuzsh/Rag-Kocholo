If anyone out there has a copy they are willing to part with or knows where I can get a copy it would be much appreciated!! Thanks!\n\nMar 26, 2007 at 4:02 AM Post #3 of 24\n\nJoined\n\nMar 1, 2007\n\nPosts\n\n64\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nI love Angela Aki, but haven't managed to get any of her albums. Hopefully this summer while I'm in Japan I can pick up some. Her voice is gorgeous and refreshing, very rich. Sorry I can't help you out with album-finding.\n\nMar 27, 2007 at 12:30 AM Post #4 of 24\n\njohnsonad\n\n500+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nDec 27, 2006\n\nPosts\n\n895\n\nLikes\n\n10\n\nMy wife lives in Japan and this is the only CD she can't get. It was her first and only released in the US. You can find any of her other CD on my of the sites to include amazon....\n\nApr 8, 2007 at 1:14 PM Post #7 of 24\n\naaron-xp\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nMay 4, 2006\n\nPosts\n\n404\n\nLikes\n\n10\n\nI am personally looking for this too, but still can't find it. Tried CDjapan, but it's not available there either.\n\nhttp://www.cdjapan.co.jp/list_from_c...tml?key=364306\n\nShe should be releasing an English album rather soon (probably within a year or two). I read that she has some recording contract with some company. I doubt one can find a copy of \"these words\" unless you look really, really, really hard.\n\nJun 13, 2007 at 1:20 PM Post #11 of 24\n\nfatcat28037\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nJan 6, 2007\n\nPosts\n\n5,690\n\nLikes\n\n126\n\nLocation\n\nDenver, NC, 20mi.
