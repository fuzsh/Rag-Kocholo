        "text": "Born to a Japanese father and an Italian-American mother, Angela Aki made her name among the list of popular J-pop singers with her debut Home, which sold over 500,000 within its first year of release in 2006.\n\nNow with her second album, Today, Aki shows she still has what it takes to produce another success.\n\nToday features 13 piano pop tracks written by Aki.\n\nIt starts with Sakurairo (Sakura Colour) - it's slow at first but has a bouncy chorus.\n\nTitle track Today is insanely catchy, with upbeat guitar riffs.\n\nThere's no doubt the seventh track, Moral no Soushiki (The Funeral of Morals), is new ground for Aki. It starts and ends with electronic drum beats and sombre piano, passing through an array of different tempos and singing styles.\n\nThe last song is the only English track, Surrender, a simply arranged piano ballad highlighting Aki's gentle voice.\n\nThe album is easy to like: there's a good mix of haunting and uplifting songs, and all the tracks in Today flow on silky piano chords.\n\nBut the album is not flawless. The most obvious defect is that Aki's voice weakens when she sings fast-paced, high-pitched tunes such as Again."
