        "text": "Given name: 聖世美\n\nFamily name: 安芸\n\nAlternate names: Kiyomi Angela Aki\n\nBirthday: Sep 15, 1977\n\nWebsite: http://www.angela-aki.c...\n\nMember Favorites: 71\n\nMore:\n\nA singer-songwriter who was born to a Japanese father and Italian-American mother, Angela Aki took up the piano at the age of 3. After spending her childhood in Tokushima and Okayama, Angela moved from Japan to Hawaii at age 15, continuing on to study Political Science at George Washington University in Washington D.C.\n\nAngela's music started to materialize as a career while she was still in university. In 2003, Angela Aki returned to Japan, and the 2005 release of her single \"HOME\" marked her major label debut. Her first album \"HOME\" has become a classic since its release in 2006, with cumulative sales counting over 600,000 units. Angela and Nobuo Uematsu, the composer renowned for the music in the Final Fantasy game series, co-wrote the single \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" for the international megahit game Final Fantasy XII on PlayStation 2.\n\nWithin the year of her debut album, Angela successfully made her dream of playing at The Budokan a reality in December 2006. Not only that, she became the very first singer at the grand Budokan, celebrating a half-century as a concert venue starting with its performance of The Beatles, to play a full solo concert with just a piano.\n\nAngela currently resides in the United States with her family and is studying for a university degree in music, in her efforts to continuously evolve and strive towards new dreams. She has also started working on a Broadway musical project.\n\n(Official Site)\n\nVoice Acting Roles\n\nNo voice acting roles have been added to this person.
