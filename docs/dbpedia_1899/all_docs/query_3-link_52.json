        "text": "“Foolish Love Cry In My Blood You and I”\n\nArtists: Angela Aki\n\nAge: September 15, 1977 (age 34)\n\nGenre: JPop, Ballad, Piano\n\nReleased: 18th July 2012\n\nI can’t remember the last time I listened to music, fell in love with a song and wanted to promote it to everyone. It’s been a slump for Jpop for the last two years, as far as I’m concerned. Just as I’m dying of music withdrawal, I come across an entire album…\n\nAngela Aki, the singer who did the theme Kiss Me Goodbye for Final Fantasy XII, is back with a breathtakingly beautiful album.\n\nFilled with her sweet, melodious voice in the same style as her third album TODAY, BLUE is presented with more skill in every way. Her voice creates mournful sounds in Aiueo, whereas Koi no Kihiki is whimsical, and Cry has ripping notes. Some songs have a jazz flair, while the titular BLUE is a strange assortment of steel pans.\n\nPersonally, I’m a fan of her ethereal ballads, but her voice is amazing in any song. Even after having her first child, she’s come back with a quality production.\n\nSee the album listing below:\n\n.\n\n."
