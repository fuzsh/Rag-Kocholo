        "text": "TOKYO — Singer- songwriter Angela Aki decided to make her next career step a big one: She will suspend her musical activities in Japan to study music in the United States starting in the fall.\n\nAki recently released a collection of her greatest hits — Tapestry of Songs: The Best of Angela Aki — and is touring the country to put a capstone on almost 10 years in the Japanese music business before she sets off.\n\nShe decided to put her career on hiatus about a year ago. One factor behind the shift was a friend who asked her to serve as music director for a musical that the friend intended to take to Broadway. Before she could accept the offer, Aki thought she had to develop a broad range of musical knowledge, including orchestration.\n\nThe decision also reflected her feeling that she had reached the limit of her skill as a singer-songwriter. Although she began piano lessons as a child, she hasn’t studied music at a specialist school or university.\n\n“I was composing music with my feelings and instincts, but I wanted my music to have a backbone in music theory,” she said in a recent interview.\n\nShe will start her course of studies at age 37, aiming to absorb everything by 40 and then work toward her ultimate goal — a Grammy.\n\nShe creates pop music centered on her singing and piano playing.\n\n“It feels as if I have put the piano amid the audience,” she said, “and I am looking at them in the eyes as I sing.”\n\nShe expects to “be exposed to new stimuli” in the United States."
