        "text": "GEORGE ANN (GRAHAM) LEONARD Beloved daughter, sister, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother Died peacefully at home on June 16, 2010 surrounded by her family. She was 85 years old. She will be remembered as a strong-willed lady who loved the arts, estate sales, reading, and loved her family above all else. Born on July 15, 1924, in (Monmouth, IL), to George Patterson Graham and Josephine Watt Graham, she graduated from Monmouth Public High School in 1942 and served as a nurse’s aide from 1944 through 1945 before moving to Riverside in 1946 to start her family. She worked at the Press-Enterprise from 1961 until her retirement as the newspaper’s Art Director in 1990. George Ann was preceded in death by her parents, her sister, Gretchen Graham of LaCanada-Flintridge, CA, and her brother, William Robert (Casey) Graham, of Davenport, IA. She is survived by her children, William Mark Leonard, his wife Natalie, and Laura Jo Densmore and her husband, Bill, both of Riverside, her grand children, Ryan Mark Leonard (wife, Shirley), John Wesley Pearson (wife, Lynn Marie), Steven Slade Pearson and Matthew Thomas Leonard, all of Riverside. She is also survived by her great-grandchildren, Jessica Ryan Leonard, Marissa Lynn Pearson and Joshua Wesley Pearson, as well as her sister-in law, Rosemary C. Graham of Davenport, IA, and her nephews, John P. Graham of Orlando, FL, and William R. Graham of Council Bluffs, IA. On Sunday June 20 there will be a memorial service for family and friends at George Ann’s long-time Riverside residence from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In lieu of flowers the family requests that donations be made to Victoria Avenue Forever or the Riverside Art Museum."
