W.\n\nPage 5\n\nOFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE\n\n120th INFANTRY\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nOn August 5, 1917, the 3rd North Carolina Regiment, of the North Carolina National Guard, was drafted into the Federal Service. That day marks the real entrance of the Regiment into the European War, in which it was to play a glorious part, reflecting credit on the Army, the State, and the Nation.\n\nThe Regiment was commanded by Colonel Sidney W. Minor, of Durham, with Lieutenant-Colonel Claude L. McGhee, of Franklinton, second in command. The three battalions were commanded, respectively, by Major Don E. Scott, Major William A. Graham, and Major Wade H. Phillips. The companies were organized at and commanded as follows:\n\n\"A\" Company, Lexington--Captain James A. Leonard:\n\n\"B\" Company, Raleigh--Captain Walter Clark, Jr.;\n\n\"C\" Company, Henderson--Captain James W. Jenkins;\n\n\"D\" Company, Louisburg--Captain Samuel P. Boddie;\n\n\"E\" Company, Oxford--Captain Elbert E. Fuller;\n\n\"F\" Company, Franklinton--Captain James E. Whitfield;\n\n\"G\" Company, Reidsville--Captain James H. Mobley;\n\n\"H\" Company, Warrenton--Captain Edward C. Price;\n\n\"I\" Company, Burlington--Captain James C. Freeman;\n\n\"K\" Company, Ashboro--Captain Ben F. Dixon;\n\n\"L\" Company, Thomasville--Captain Carleton H. Newby;\n\n\"M\" Company, Durham--Captain Walter E. Page;\n\nHeadquarters Company, chiefly from Tennessee--organization begun by Major Don E. Scott and completed by Captain Thomas Fauntleroy, of Memphis;\n\nMachine Gun Company, North Carolina--Captain Charles F. Lumsden, Raleigh;\n\nSupply Company, North Carolina--Captain Stephen E. Winston; and\n\nSanitary Detachment, North Carolina--Major Abram R. Winston.\n\nIt is interesting to note that none of these units, with the exception of Headquarters Company, returned from overseas in command of the original commanding officer.\n\nPage 6\n\nComing from the Central and Piedmont Sections of North Carolina, and being filled up later on by men from Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana, it was a thoroughly American organization. It inherited the best traditions of a fighting stock, who had proven their worth in the War of the Revolution and the War Between the States. The most cherished records of accomplishments had been left untarnished to the younger generation, and their sires and grandsires felt, if the opportunity was given, their sons and grandsons would add new luster and new traditions to the old.\n\nThe Regiment, with the 1st and 2nd North Carolina Infantry Regiments, composed the North Carolina Infantry Brigade, and as such had served on the Mexican Border, near El Paso. The Border service having been satisfactory it was confidently expected the Brigade would be maintained intact, but changes in sizes of units, as a result of this war, upset all expectations. When mobilized at Camp Sevier, Greenville, South Carolina, as part of the 30th Division, the 1st North Carolina was broken up, part of the personnel being assigned to this Regiment, and the 2nd and 3rd North Carolina disappeared, except in the memory of those who loved them, becoming, respectively, the 119th and 120th Infantry Regiments, composing the 60th (Tar-Heel) Brigade. The 60th Brigade was commanded by Brigadier-General Sampson L. Faison, a Regular Army officer, a North Carolinian, and the maker of the 30th Division.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nCamp Sevier, Greenville, South Carolina, named after Colonel John Sevier, North Carolina Militiaman and Brigadier-General, U. S. A., afterwards becoming Governor of Tennessee, was a tented camp. The location was ideal, and there would have been no complaints provided South Carolina had lived up to its reputation of \"Sunny South.\" This it sadly failed to do.\n\nThe first units of the Regiment to arrive, the latter part of August, were put to work converting cleared land and cultivated fields into drill-grounds. So real training was not under way until the middle of September, and even then it was constantly interrupted by moving, due to the increased size of units under everchanging tables of organizations.\n\nThe authorized officer-strength of the Regiment was provided for by the promotion of enlisted men and by a shipment of newly graduated Reserve Officers, \"Sears-Roebuck Lieutenants\" they were called. These Reserve Officers expected a hostile reception, and were gratified to find that their home in the Regiment depended solely upon their individual ability to make good. They expected to find themselves in a National Guard organization, with all of the widely advertised faults of the National Guard, and they found a regiment to which these stories did not apply. They quickly\n\nPage 7\n\nabsorbed the traditions of the Regiment, and found that the regimental idea was--for officers to be obeyed and followed: first, because they had gained the respect, confidence, and love of their men; and, secondly, because of the authority vested in them by virtue of their commission. This idea has been the constant aim of the officers of the Regiment during its entire life.\n\nWith the arrival of French and British instructors, schools were started in bayonet, bombs, scouting, etc. All ranks were pushed to their capacity. While the hours were long, the time was short, and those who were not able to stand the grind, or failed to realize the importance of their task, soon fell by the wayside.\n\nTraining was largely centered around trench-warfare, but fortunately open-fighting was not overlooked, and this forethought on the part of those in command proved of value later on and doubtless saved many lives in active operations. Much of the trench-warfare training proved of little value in active service, as conditions existing to-day are out of date to-morrow, but it all served to develop both officer and man. This was notably the case in bayonet-training, and, while there was but slight chance of bayonet combat, it developed a fighting spirit and a feeling of confidence as nothing else could have done.\n\nTraining was seriously interrupted about the middle of December by an unprecedented winter--a winter unlooked for in the South. As a result, the camp was not prepared for such a condition. Sleet and snow covered the ground--men had to spend their entire time cutting and carrying wood for heating and cooking, and the little opportunity for indoor instruction was of doubtful, if of any, value. As soon as the weather permitted, training was renewed with redoubled energy.\n\nThe first of January, Colonel Minor and Lieutenant-Colonel McGhee were sent to a Field Officers' School, in Texas, and Colonel Cochran was assigned to the Regiment, remaining in command until Colonel Minor returned in April. Colonel Cochran was a Regular Army officer, and a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute. He was an officer and a gentleman, and soon gained the admiration and confidence of all ranks. It was a pleasure to have served under him.\n\nWhen the Regiment was first drafted into service its strength was slightly over 1,500 men, and this number was reduced by frequent calls for specialists of all kinds. It was, therefore, necessary to fill the Regiment up to strength before it would be fit for overseas service. The men first received were a splendid lot from the old 2nd Tennessee, which had been broken up. Most of these men went to Headquarters Company, and this company from that time on was largely a Tennessee Company both in officers and men. The Regiment was also fortunate in securing the Tennessee Band, as a unit. This band was composed of trained musicians, chiefly from Memphis, and, under the able leadership of Chief Musician Harry\n\nPage 8\n\nBlix, developed into one of the best bands in the A. E. F. The second lot came from Camp Jackson. The officers in charge candidly stated that they had picked the poorest men in the Division, but with the exception of those who were crippled and should never have been inducted into service, they proved by their loyalty and fighting qualities that some one at Camp Jackson was an extremely poor judge of men--at least of men who could fight. Practically all of these men were from North Carolina. The third and last lot of men the Regiment received came from Camp Taylor, chiefly Kentuckians and Indianaians. They were a splendid lot physically and mentally, and, as fighters, they had no superiors. All of these men soon took their place in the Regiment and found they stood an equal chance with the old men of the organization.\n\nThe first of May, 1918, found the Regiment ready to go. The companies were in excellent shape; the spirit of the men was high: and all were on edge, as each man knew the time was near at hand.\n\nThe special units of Headquarters Company, the 37-mms., Lieutenant Gilliland; the Trench Mortars, Lieutenant Dayton; the Pioneers, Lientenant Bunch; and the Signals, Lieutenant Ailor, were all in splendid condition, and their state of training reflected credit on their officers and on the Regiment.\n\nThe Intelligence Service, composed of specially selected men, had been organized.\n\nQuite a few changes had been made in the Regiment. Two of the more important were: Captain Whitfield, of \"F\" Company, had resigned, and Lieutenant Beck was in command; and Captain Freeman, of \"I\" Company, had resigned, and Captain Robert C. Young was promoted to fill the vacancy.\n\nAn Advance Party, consisting of Majors Scott and Graham, Captain Boddie, Lieutenants Taylor, Williams, Richards, Dayton, Dixon, Mason, Green, and Ailor, and a number of enlisted men, were sent ahead. And on the 7th day of May, 1918, after a final clean-up of all men physically unfit, the Regiment began to move.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMovements of troops are supposed to have been shrouded with secrecy, but the thousands of visitors who had come to bid their sons a last farewell preceded the troop trains, and the news of the coming spread like wildfire. As a result, the passage through North and South Carolina was a continuous ovation. Each village, town, and city turned out to cheer the men as they passed. Half of the Regiment went north via Greenwood-Raleigh-Richmond, and the other half via Charlotte-Greensboro-Lynchburg. The Red Cross handled the feeding of the troops, at points en route, in a most satisfactory manner. The movement continued for two days, the troops detraining at Camp Merritt, a few miles north of New York City.\n\nPage 9\n\nIt was thought that the Regiment was equipped for overseas service, but such did not prove to be the case. Practically everything the men had, in the way of clothing, was taken from them and new issued. This meant work without rest for the 1st and 2nd Battalions and Supply Company, who arrived one day and were promptly told they would leave on the next. The remaining units were kept at Camp Merritt for nearly a week, and, as there was no room for drilling, practically every man was given an opportunity to see a little of New York City. This was a great experience for most of the men.\n\nThe entire Regiment embarked for overseas at Boston--the first units leaving on H. M. T. Bohemia, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel McGhee, and the remainder of the Regiment one week later on H. M. T. Miltiades, under command of Brigadier-General S. L. Faison. The men were badly crowded on both boats, and the food by no means good. The latter was due, in part, to the men of the Regiment not being accustomed to eating the kind of food preferred by Australians, and, as both boats had been used in the Australian transport service, they had been provisioned to suit those troops. The voyage over for both boats was perfect, in so far as the weather was concerned, and uneventful save for the usual attacks by submarines. These attacks were unsuccessful in all cases and served to enliven what would have been a monotonous voyage. It is believed some of these submarines were accounted for. The troops on the Bohemia were disembarked at Liverpool, going by rail to Folkestone, and from there to Calais by boat. Those on the Miltiades were disembarked near London, going by rail to Dover, and from there to Calais by boat. The entire movement of the Regiment to France was completed on the 5th of June, 1918. On landing in England all ranks were given a facsimile of an autograph letter of welcome from His Majesty, George V.\n\nAt Calais, the troops were marched to a British Rest Camp just outside the city. Here everything, except the clothing on the men's backs, was turned in for salvage. All was piled in warehouses to be sorted out by Chinese laborers. Some of these laborers having been killed by American sentinels, at an earlier date, resulted in an order being issued requesting American soldiers to refrain from killing Chinamen. In this land of killing it seemed a little out of place, but it must be remembered a Chinaman had a greater value in shillings and pounds than an ordinary soldier.\n\nThe Regiment, having been reëquipped with British equipment throughout--helmets, gas masks, and rifles--marched to the station and entrained as part of the British Army. All ranks were much dissatisfied, at first, over the assignment to the British Army, and for a long time the constant query was \"When do we go South?\" but in course of time it was changed to \"We don't want to go South.\" At Calias the distant thunder of guns could be heard, and\n\nPage 10\n\nthe nightly air raids with the accompaniment of bombs, taking their nightly toll of women and children, gave the first touch of war, and opened the eyes of many to the kind of enemy they were to fight.\n\nOn entraining at Calais the Regiment had its first experience with the famous French troop trains of \"40 Homme or 8 Chevaux.\" Fortunately the introduction was brief--the troops detraining two hours later at Audriucq in the Eperlecques Training Area. Regimental Headquarters was located at Chateau Cocove, Headquarters Company at Grasse Payelle, 1st Battalion at Zutkerque, 2nd Battalion at La Montaire, 3rd Battalion at Nielles, Machine Gun Company at Nortleulingham, and the Supply Company at Lostrat. Once more the entire Regiment was together and training was begun again.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIn the Eperlecques Training Area, British officers and N. C. O.'s, from the 4th Bedfordshire Battalion, were assigned to the Regiment, and, under the personal direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Edwards, British Army, supervised the instruction within the Regiment, seeing that only the most recent developments were followed. The services of these officers and men were of special value in preventing the wasting of effort on nonessentials.\n\nAt this time the enemy was believed to be preparing a drive in the vicinity of Hazebrouck. Another effort to secure the Channel Ports. This Regiment, in case the attack came, was to move by force marches and occupy part of the \"Terdeghem Switch Line.\" This line was to be \"held at all cost.\" Plans were made, orders issued, and officers were sent forward to make the necessary reconnaissance, so as to be able to occupy their proper position in the line promptly and without confusion. Fortunately the attack failed to materialize and training continued.\n\nAn important part of the training in this area consisted in sending details of officers and men up for periods of a week to two weeks with the 33rd and 49th British Divisions. These Divisions were holding the Ypres Salient. The details were carried up in old London busses which had been in use since the first days of the war, and were still giving excellent service.\n\nEach man returned with a clearer perception of the work he had to do, and a fund of stories for his less fortunate comrades. Some of the best stories of the Regiment were collected in and around Ypres. Fortunately only a few casualties resulted from these trips, as the British troops had been ordered to restrain the natural inquisitiveness of the Americans.\n\nIn this area the Regiment received British transportation, and the Regimental Supply Service was reorganized to conform with that of the British Army. This was a most important change, and, when put into practice later on, worked without a hitch.\n\nPage 11\n\n[Map]\n\nTo create a feeling of confidence in the artillery is particularly desired in infantry troops, as nothing is harder on their morale than to have a feeling of uncertainty as to whether their own artillery can be depended upon to shoot where they aim. In order that all ranks might see the actual handling of a barrage a practical illustration was given, and it certainly had the desired effect on both officers and men.\n\nSir Douglas Haig and General Pershing both inspected part of the troops while in this area. As a result of this inspection, and the reports of his officers, the former requested this Division to be one of the two remaining with the British Army. While here a great many new officers joined the Regiment. They were part of \"Pershing's Traveling Circus,\" and proved to be some of the most efficient officers the Regiment had.\n\nBefore the completion of training, the Regiment was transferred as part of the Division to the II British Corps, Second Army, commanded, respectively, by Major-General Jacobs and General Plumer, moving up in close support to the 33rd and 49th British Divisions in the Ypres Salient, where an attack was expected.\n\nOn the 2nd of July, 1918, the Regiment marched from the billets to the eastern edge of the Foret D'Eperlecque, where it bivouacked for the night. On the morning of the 3rd the movement was resumed, and the night of the 3rd was spent at Rubrouck. On the morning of the 4th of July part of the Division crossed into Belgium--the first American troops in the little kingdom. This Regiment marched to Herzeele where it remained for five days in training. When the Regiment entered this village Belgian and French flags were flying from the houses in honor of the American holiday. At Herzeele the officers and men, sent from the States as an Advance Party, rejoined their organizations. Prior to this the 1st Battalion had been commanded by Captain Leonard and the 2nd Battalion by Captain Fuller.\n\nOn leaving Herzeele the Regiment marched to \"Road and Ball Camps.\" These two camps were two and three miles north of Watou. They would accommodate about 4,000 men in huts, each hut holding about 30 men. The huts were constructed from sheet iron and known as \"Nisson huts.\" After the camps had been thoroughly cleaned they made very comfortable quarters. Every precaution had to be taken in this area with lights, as enemy bombing planes were over every favorable night, and, while the entire country was believed to be infested with spies, these camps were, for some reason, never bombed, though offering an excellent target.\n\nWhat was known as phase \"B\" of training was begun immediately upon arrival in this area. This training was arranged so as to give the Regiment the maximum amount of actual front line experience, and at the same time holding out a sufficient number of troops to complete and occupy the East Poperinghe Line, which line\n\nPage 12\n\nwas to be held by Americans should the enemy attack about the middle of July as was expected. For the purpose of carrying on this training the 60th Brigade was attached to the 33rd British Division, commanded by General Penny, and this Regiment feels deeply indebted to the officers and men of this British Division for their never-failing willingness to render every possible assistance to this Regiment.\n\nIt was necessary, shortly after the Regiment arrived at \"Road Camp,\" to send the 1st and 3rd Battalions, under command of Major Phillips, back to Recques to complete their firing. The battalions moved by train from Proven to Audriucq, returning the same way, on the 19th of July.\n\nUnder phase \"B\" of training each battalion would spend eight days in \"Road Camp,\" eight days in the \"Blue\" or East Poperinghe Line, and eight days in the front system. During the period of eight days in the front system, for two days and nights the men were distributed among the British troops, two days and nights platoons were distributed among the British, two days and nights companies were distributed the same way, and the last two days and nights the sector was taken over by the battalion. The reserve and support battalions were used to complete the East and West Poperinghe Systems. The entire plan was carried out successfully. The 2nd, 1st, and 3rd Battalions, in order named, were sent through the course, beginning the nights of the 16th and 17th of July. While holding the \"Blue Line,\" momentarily expecting an attack, one of the battalions was aroused in the early hours by the bursting of grenades. Every one was \"turned out\" quickly, expecting to find the enemy coming through the wire, only to learn one Private Ball, having become weary on a lonely post, had gathered together a quantity of grenades, and for his own amusement was putting down, as he termed it, a \"hand gunnade barrage.\"\n\nTroops were moved into the forward area by marching, guides being furnished by the British Units; when the tour was completed, the battalion was entrained on a light railway near Ypres, detraining at Remy Siding, two miles south of Poperinghe and marching to \"Road Camp.\" During this phase of training the Machine Gun Company was under the direction of the Division Machine Gun Officer, and was attached for training to the British Machine Gun Battalion. The Trench Mortar Battery was attached, one team at a time, to the 19th and 98th T. M. B.'s. The 37-mm. Platoon, there is no similar unit in the British Army, was attached, from August 7th to 11th, to the 33rd British Machine Gun Corps. The Pioneers was attached, for nearly a month, to the 18th Middlesex Pioneer Regiment, and took part with this Regiment in the consolidation of Scottish Woods, which had been taken by the British. The Signal Platoon, which had been reinforced by a platoon from the 105th Field Signal Battalion, under command of Lieutenant\n\nPage 13\n\nWorkman, was divided between the battalions and trained with the battalion. The Sanitary Detachments were with their respective battalions. The Band was not permitted to go forward, musicians are too hard to replace, and of too great value in maintaining the morale of the men. The Supply Detachments of each battalion went as far forward as possible each night with food and water, and at designated points they were met by carrying parties from each platoon or company. During this phase of training units in the line were not permitted to participate in trench raids, but were permitted and encouraged to actively patrol No Man's Land at all times. Several successful skirmishes were had with the enemy, who tried on several occasions to rush the outpost line, but no prisoners were lost and none were taken.\n\nAn interesting event to American troops, while at \"Road Camp,\" was an inspection by King George. His coming was a profound secret, known only to a few, but the \"underground route\" soon spread the news. Everything was \"shined up.\" The men who were not to be inspected lined the road so as to have a glimpse of His Majesty. The troops were formed without arms, such being the custom, but the men believed the British were afraid some of them would take a \"pot shot\" at their ruler. At the time appointed a long line of motors drove up, and from one flying a miniature \"Royal Standard\" the King descended. Accompanied by a galaxy of British officers, the Division and Brigade commanders of the 30th Division, and the regimental commanders, who joined the party as it passed in front of the officers of the Division, the King quickly inspected the front rank of the troops in formation. It was all over in a few minutes--he came, he saw, and he departed amid the cheers of the troops.\n\nAnother memorable incident was a visit by Elsie Janis, who \"put on\" her \"show\" at Watou. Unfortunately two battalions were in the line--so only a small part of the Regiment were fortunate enough to see this \"regular fellow,\" who was the only entertainer not overlooking the existence of this Regiment from June to November. Those who witnessed the performance will long remember it as the only bit of cheer brought to the Regiment when it was most needed.\n\nDuring this period Major-General E. M. Lewis, who had commanded the Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Division, assumed command of the Division. General Faison returned to the Brigade and Colonel Minor to the Regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel McGhee was transferred to the port of Calais. Major Phillips went to the Claims Department, Captains Mobley and Fuller to the Service of Supply, Captain Walter Clark, Jr., to the Line School, and afterwards to the Staff College. Captain Newby, Lieutenants Stegall, Gray, and McRae were returned in a higher grade to the States to assist in\n\nPage 14\n\ntraining a new Division. Captain S. P. Boddie was put in command of 3rd Battalion, and the other vacancies were filled by the senior officer with the Company.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe training of the Division was finished. It was now ready to fight alone--so arrangements were made to take over the \"Canal Sector\" of the Ypres Salient, or simply \"The Salient,\" as it is commonly called, from the 33rd British Division. This sector extended from Zillebeke Lake, which had at one time been the chief water supply for the ancient City of Ypres, but was now empty of water, and located just a little northeast of Lille Gate; hence southeast for 2,400 meters to the vicinity of the City of Voormezeele. The ground was very low, easily flooded, and the water so near the surface that each shell hole became a little pool. All of the high ground, Observatory Ridge, Passchendaele Ridge, and the famous Mont Kimmel, was held by the enemy. These points of observation enabled the enemy to detect any movement within the sector, and, as a result, daylight movement was of necessity reduced to a minimum, for even small parties would provoke instant and heavy shelling. The Salient was so deep and so narrow it was subjected to shell-fire from front, flanks, and rear. Oftentimes the men in the forward systems believed they were being shelled by their own artillery, when as a matter of fact the shells were from enemy guns on our right and rear.\n\nThe entire sector is a ghastly monument to the tenacity and courage of the British soldiers. For four long years they held it against bitter attacks by a determined enemy; to-day it is consecrated ground made sacred by the bodies of hundreds of thousands of Britain's finest sons; and the few Americans who lie \"where poppies bloom\" died not for humanity alone, for in dying they brought closer the bonds of blood which unite the two great nations. Knowing its history it seemed a grave responsibility for new and untried troops, though it was an honor to be considered worthy of the trust.\n\nThe relief was to be made on the night of the 17-18 of August. The 60th Brigade relieving the 33rd British Division, the 59th Brigade being in reserve. This Regiment took over from the 16th King's Royal Rifle Corps the 2nd Worcestershires, the 9th Highland Light Infantry, the Yorshire Dragoons, and the 100th Trench Mortar Battery, all of the 100th Brigade British, commanded by Brigadier-General Baird, and, on the left of the sector, the 119th Infantry taking over the right of the sector. On the afternoon of the 16th the Regiment marched from \"Road and Ball Camps,\" the 1st and 2nd Battalions occupying what is known as the \"Yellow Line,\" and the 3rd Battalion occupying the \"Blue\n\nPage 15\n\nLine.\" Both of these lines were reserve lines. Advance parties had been sent forward to familiarize themselves with the sector, and to make any detailed arrangements necessary for the relief. On the evening of the 17th the 1st and 2nd Battalions moved forward from the \"Yellow Line\"--the 3rd Battalion occupying the vacated position. British guides met the relieving troops at Vlamertinghe Mill at 7:15 P. M.; at 9:00 P. M. Regimental Headquarters closed at Chateau Elizabeth, near Poperinghe, and reopened a short while after at \"Pulse Farm.\" The night was frightfully dark, and it would have been no surprise if the relief had not been completed that night, but, thanks to careful arrangements, 1:00 A. M. saw the last of the British depart. The \"Bloody Salient,\" so long British, was now American in part.\n\nThe 1st Battalion was on the right--headquarters at Belgian Battery Corner; 2nd Battalion on the left--headquarters near Kruistraat; both battalions with one company in front and outpost line--one company in support and two companies in reserve. This disposition was later changed to the one shown on map. The 3rd Battalion, as part of the Brigade Reserve, in \"Yellow Line,\" with headquarters at Erie Farm. The Trench Mortars and observers took over the positions held by the British. The Pioneers and Signals were apportioned between the battalions. The Machine Gun Company relieved the British Machine Gun Company under the direction of the Divisional Machine Gun Officer.\n\nThe policy of the Regiment was to be one of aggression. Supremacy in No Man's Land was to be secured and held. To this end the entire front was covered with strong patrols each night. No prisoners had been taken for quite a number of weeks, in spite of every effort, and as a result no one knew exactly the condition in front of the Regiment. The enemy system of defense was one of machine gun outpost, which were shifted every night, and a few fixed positions fortified and strongly held. The defense of the sector was based on two contingencies: First, in case an attack was expected; second, in case of a surprise attack. Should an attack be expected all of the troops were to be withdrawn from the front system to the support lines, with the exception of certain strong points or centers of resistance such as \"Bedford House\" and \"Swan Chateau.\" These centers were to hold on until counter attacks could be organized and launched from the support line. Should the attack be in the nature of surprise each line was to be held until every man was killed. The British Artillery, covering the front, was active at all times, shelling the enemy back-areas and engaged in counter battery work both day and night.\n\nBeyond skirmishes between patrols and outpost everything in the sector was normal. On the 20th the troops were withdrawn from the outpost system to enable the heavy artillery to put down a destructive fire on certain strong positions of the enemy which\n\nPage 16\n\nwere uncomfortably near the line. Airplane photos, taken after the shelling, revealed considerable damage. The lines were reoccupied without opposition. On the night of August 22-23 the 3rd Battalion relieved the 1st Battalion--the latter going to the \"Yellow Line.\"\n\nShortly after the 3rd Battalion took over they sent in the first prisoner captured by the Division--a Chinaman, and from the excitement produced at Army Headquarters one would have thought the Chinese Army had been identified on the Western Front. No information could be obtained, as his English vocabulary was limited to \"Yes\" and \"Calais,\" so he was sent to the rear accompanied by the following note from the Battalion Commander: \"Here is a Chinaman, captured near Post No. 5. He is either on leave or A. W. O. L. In either case he picked a damn bad place to spend it. BODDIE.\"\n\nOn the night of August 28-29 the 1st Battalion relieved the 2nd Battalion--the latter moving to the position vacated by the 1st Battalion.\n\nOn the night of August 26th a cloud gas attack was made on the front of this Regiment. The attack was handled by the 105th Engineer Regiment. This Regiment furnished 400 men to assist. 2,520 cylinders of gas, phosgene, and chlorine on nine trains of seven three-ton truck each were conveyed by Light Railway to Trois Rois Spur. From here the cars were pushed by hand to positions just behind the outpost line. All troops were withdrawn from the outpost line. At 3:00 A. M., with the wind blowing about four miles per hour directly towards the enemy lines, the gas was released simultaneously from all cylinders. The enemy immediately sent up hundreds of lights of every description and opened fire with machine guns over the entire front. These latter gradually died out as the gas cloud rolled over them. It was a beautiful sight and a successful attack, but prisoners taken later on stated there were no casualties beyond a few horses. The outpost line was reoccupied the following night.\n\nAll arrangements had been completed for the relief of this Regiment by the 117th Infantry on the night of September 1-2, but, on account of increased activity on this front, the relief was cancelled. On August 31st the enemy was reported as withdrawing on the front of the II British Corps. All troops forming a part of this corps were directed to establish touch with the enemy at once and ascertain if this report was true. Two strong combat patrols were sent over about the middle of the day from each battalion. They were ordered to proceed as far as Middlesex Road, and if the enemy was not in strength to establish a new outpost line along that road; but, most important of all, prisoners for identification and information were desired. The enemy was developed in strength along the entire front so the patrols returned with few casualties to\n\nPage 17\n\nthe original lines. One of the patrols from the 1st Battalion, under command of Lieutenant Boyd, secured 14 prisoners--the first taken by the Regiment. These prisoners furnished a great deal of valuable information and identified the unit on the front.\n\nOn the morning of September 1st an attack was made by the Second British Army. The 1st and 3rd Battalions, this Regiment, was ordered to push forward 100 to 1,000 yards, establishing a new line from Lock No. 8 on Canal, running north of Lankhof Farm to Zillebeke Lake. The principal objective was Lankhof Farm, a strongly fortified position surrounded by a moat. The fighting was very bitter, but, with the coöperation of the artillery, who maintained close liaison with the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, the new line was taken and consolidated, for the consolidation troops were sent up from the 2nd Battalion and from the engineers. The 119th Infantry made a successful advance on the right, taking Voormezeele.\n\nOn the night of September 4-5 the Regiment was relieved by the 105th and part of the 104th British Brigades. On the completion of the relief the Regiment proceeded by marching to Dirty Bucket Camp.\n\nWhile in the line the trench mortars fired from 100 to 200 projectiles daily on known and suspected enemy positions, provoking prompt and heavy retaliation, much to the disgust of the infantry, who have no love for trench mortars.\n\nIn advance of September 1-2 emplacements were established well forward and covered the consolidation of the new line. The 37-mms. were kept in reserve, but on the day of the advance two guns were sent forward in command of Lieutenant Lowry, but did not become engaged. The Pioneers were divided between the battalions and aided in the consolidation. Prior to that time they were engaged in the construction of dugouts and shelters. The Signals in this and future operations maintained excellent communications at all times. The Regimental Machine Gun Company covered the front of the Regiment for the first eight days--harrassing the enemy lines at night. The day of the advance two guns were ordered forward from the rear to cover consolidation. The Intelligence Service, both battalion and regimental, functioned well at all times.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSeptember 5th and 6th were devoted to cleaning up. The entire Regiment was deloused and bathed at \"Kill Bug Station and Hop Factory,\" each man receiving a clean suit of underwear. After a period in the line the little bugs were plentiful.\n\nOn September 3rd, prior to the relief, orders had been issued for the transfer of this Regiment as part of the Division to the 3rd British Army. This Army was holding the sector in the vicinity of Arras and was commanded by General Byng.\n\nPage 18\n\nThe movement began on the evening of September the 6th, continued all night, and was completed on the morning of the 7th. Troops and transports marched from Dirty Bucket Camp to Proven where they entrained. It was a distinction to have been part of the first American Division in Belgium; it was a privilege to have held and fought in the Ypres Salient, which with Verdun is the most famous spot in the World-War, but it was with a decided feeling of relief the salient was turned back to the British and there were no regrets, save the 1st Battalion who have failed to find \"The Lady of Ypres,\" when Flanders' mud was left behind. The journey by train lasted twelve hours--troops detraining at Wavrans west of St. Pol, and marching to a billeting area east of St. Pol; Regimental Headquarters, Headquarters and Machine Gun Companies to Herlincourt, 1st Battalion to Petit Houvin, 2nd Battalion to Framecourt, and 3rd Battalion to Croisette. On detraining at Wavrans the 1st Battalion established a record by unloading all troops and transportation in nineteen minutes.\n\nThis was by far the most beautiful and comfortable area in which the Regiment was ever billeted. Here an opportunity was given to apply in training what had been learned by experience. Fortunately there was a tank school in this area, so all ranks had an opportunity of seeing how troops should work in connection with heavy tanks--Companies \"A,\" \"E,\" and \"K\" giving a practical demonstration. Such an opportunity as this was rarely had by American troops, and the knowledge gained here was doubtless of great value in future operations when tanks were used.\n\nOn the 17th and 18th of September the Division was moved to the Puchevillers Area, near Albert. This Regiment entrained on the 17th at Petit Houvin--the transport going by road, and staging for the night of the 17th at Bouque-Maison, and detrained about six hours later near Acheux, Regimental Headquarters--Headquarters and Machine Gun Companies and 1st Battalion going to Acheux, 2nd and 3rd Battalions to Forceville, and the Supply Company to Rosel.\n\nThis area, until a few weeks before the arrival of the Regiment, had been under shell fire. A few of the inhabitants were just beginning to return. The entire country was filled with wire entanglements, trenches, and unsalvaged ammunitions of every description. A perfect training ground; no crops, no houses, no hedges to bother about, trenches dug, wire up, and ammunition to be had on every hand. All worked hard to profit by this wonderful opportunity, and the training was concluded in this area by a regimental problem on the 23rd of September, which, strange to say, fitted nearly exactly the big attack the Regiment was to take part in on the 29th of September.\n\nWhile in these two areas the following changes were made in the officer personnel: Captains Fuller, Price, and Page were transferred\n\nPage 19\n\n[Map]\n\nto the Service of Supply, Captain Byrd was assigned to \"G\" Company, Captain St. John was assigned to \"M\" Company, Captain Mays was assigned to \"D\" Company, Captain Chapman, the Regiment's only Regular Army officer, reported and was assigned to \"F\" Company. Those who knew Captain Chapman while at Camp Sevier felt the Regiment was to be congratulated on his assignment, and it was the source of genuine regret when he was killed in the first action with the Regiment. Major Scott was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, but requested permission to remain in command of his battalion until after the approaching operation.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOn the night of September 23, 1918, the Division was transferred to the 4th British Army, commanded by General Rawlinson. No one knew what was to take place, but each man in the Regiment felt the time had come for the Regiment to prove its worth. The Regiment was formed in columns of two's on the road between Acheux and Forceville. Lorry after lorry rolled into place, and at 8:00 P. M. all troops were embussed and ready to move into the night. All night long the movement continued through Albert, Peronne, Doingt, and along the marshy Somme. With the sky growing lighter in the east the Regiment debussed at Cartigny and marched to Tincourt. Once more the flash of guns and the burst of \"Very lights\" could be seen. The same day the Regiment was joined by a detail of Australian officers and men, who were to give whatever assistance the Regiment might need; and from these Australians more was learned in the short period they were with the Regiment, particularly as regards the rationing of troops in the line, than in the entire period of training. In the afternoon the Regiment marched to Hervilly. Regimental Headquarters was in the side of a sunken road. The troops were scattered wherever room could be found, the mass of artillery, infantry, and cavalry filling the entire country.\n\nThe Regiment learned that in front of it lay the hitherto impregnable positions of the Hindenburg Line, against which many fruitless attacks had been made; that the British Army had been given the task of fighting the only decisive battle in the World-War; that the place of honor in this attack between Cambria and St. Quentin had been given the 4th British Army; that the 30th Division, as part of the 4th British Army, would attack in the center with the 46th British on the right and the 27th American on the left; that the 119th and 120th Infantry Regiments had been selected to do the job, with the 117th Infantry to follow and attack to the right after crossing the Canal, and 118th Infantry as Divisional Reserve.\n\nPage 20\n\nThis Regiment's sector of the Hindenburg System consisted: First, of three rows of heavy barbed wire, woven so thick as to resemble a mass of vines and briars intermingled--each row was from thirty to forty feet in depth, and to which the artillery fire did but little damage; second, three rows of the Hindenburg trenches, on which four years of work had been spent; third, the backbone of the entire system, Bellicourt, the St. Quentin Canal Tunnel. This Canal passed for a distance of 6,000 yards underground from Le Catlet on the north to Recquval on the south. It had been built by the Great Napoleon, and in some places was 193 feet underground. The Germans filled the Canal with barges, lighted it with electric lights, and fitted it with dressing stations. On the barges accommodations were provided for a division of troops, where they could rest secure from any shell-fire. The end of the tunnel had been closed with ferro-concrete walls with openings left for machine gun. To the trench system and to the town of Bellicourt, overhead, ran concrete tunnels through which troops could move to reinforce the front line or to occupy the prepared positions in Bellicourt; third, the Catlet-Nauroy Line, a supporting system; and, fourth, the village of Nauroy, which had been prepared for defense. Over the entire area were machine guns without number, not only the probable approaches, but every inch of front was covered by one or more guns. The Germans believed the position could not be taken, and even when lost prisoners would not believe it to be possible, and laughed at those who would tell them.\n\nAs fast as information was secured it was passed on to unit commanders in conference. Later on this same information was published in memorandums and distributed down to and including platoon commanders. Some of the most interesting of these memorandums, together with the attack order, are given in the sequence issued.\n\nLIQA\n\n(Code name of Regiment)\n\nSeptember 26, 1918.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n1. \"Mopping up\" parties, as soon as designated, will submit a plan for mopping up areas allotted to them. They will provide themselves with a plentiful supply of phosphorus bombs in addition to hand grenades.\n\n2. Battalion Commanders will provide themselves with signal rockets, size No. 32, white over white over white. These will be fired when objective is reached.\n\n3. Message carrying rockets will be drawn.\n\n4. Metal disk will be fastened on the inside of gas mask, on flap, to be shown on call from aircraft. Only men in the front line should show same. All ranks will be provided with this signal.\n\n[Map]\n\nPage 21\n\n5. Red flares will be drawn for attacking troops which will be lit to indicate the new line. Four or five should be lighted in a group, not more than 30 yards apart, and only on signal.\n\n6. Men will be cautioned to keep as close to the barrage as possible--possibly within 25 yards of tanks--as only by keeping close to barrage can casualties be avoided.\n\n7. See that signal lamps are ready, and that message maps are on hand before going over.\n\n8. Tanks: Helmet stuck on bayonet attracts attention of tank, and it should be pointed in direction of machine gun or nest. Tank will stop to let you know he has seen signal. Green and white flag from tank shows that enemy has been cleaned up and advance may continue. Yellow and red flag indicates that tank is in trouble--advance will continue without tank. Tanks coming out of action fly red, white and blue flag. Five (5) men will be selected from each battalion to go with tanks. Good men will be selected, and they will report the day before attack. Some Infantry may be required to proceed tanks to look out for mines--select men in case they should be called for. Regimental and Company stretcher bearers will take care of tank wounded. Send message by D. R. to Tank Commander about same. All men will be cautioned to look out for tanks so as to avoid being run over. Infantry will assist tanks by rushing strong points.\n\n9. Caution men again about Boche traps, and, if necessary, use Boche to open doors of dugouts and to go in first.\n\n10. Prisoners will be sent to Battalion Headquarters. Officers and N. C. O.'s will be promptly searched and separated from other ranks. A very few men can handle a large number of Boche prisoners.\n\n11. Two or three men will be designated on the flanks of each battalion who will be responsible for direction. These men will carry prismatic compasses.\n\n12. Packs will probably be put in dumps. Each man going over only carries rations and slicker. These packs should be properly made and tagged.\n\n13. Each unit commander will keep in touch with his next higher commander.\n\n14. Impress upon all men that speed is essential to success. Clean up as the advance is made, and leave an open road for the Australian coming behind.\n\nJOHN O. WALKER,\n\nCapt., Operating Officer, for\n\nCommanding Officer.\n\nPage 22\n\nLIQA\n\nSeptember 27, 1918.\n\nSECRET:\n\nFIELD ORDER NO. 30.\n\nMAPS 62-B N. W., 1/20,000,\n\n62-C N.

Time of event should be in body of message.\n\n(d) All men will be given all information in regard to the attack at once.\n\nJOHN O. WALKER,\n\nCapt., Operation Officer, for\n\nCommanding Officer.\n\nPage 26\n\nLIQA\n\nSeptember 28, 1918.\n\nMEMORANDUM: To Battalion and Separate Unit Commanders.\n\n1. Zero hour will be ----. When your units are lined up and in place one hour before zero hour, notify these Headquarters by code word \"Pork.\"\n\n2. The 27th Division failed in its mission yesterday, and will fight its way to its jumping off place to-morrow morning.\n\n3. The barrage will fall at the designated place at zero hour.\n\n4. Time table is changed as follows, and will remain on the original barrage line 4 minutes instead of 3:\n\nEach successive leap will be 4 minutes. It will halt for 15 minutes on line previously designated.\n\nChange your time tables accordingly.\n\n5. The commanding officer of 3rd Battalion will notify attached units as to location of clearing stations.\n\nBy order of Colonel Minor.\n\nJOHN O. WALKER,\n\nCapt., Operation Officer.\n\nThe change in the rate of advance by the barrage, one minute slower in each 100 yards up to the Canal, required 4 hours instead of 3 hours and 34 minutes for it to cross final objective.\n\nPrior to the attack the gallant Captain Dixon, who was instantly killed while leading his men after having been previously wounded three times, called the men of his company together, and they solemnly pledged themselves to carry through to the objective, though only one man be left. Captain Leonard counted his eggs and entrusted them to \"Peter,\" who so far forgot the war as to chase crippled quail in the midst of the enemy counter barrage. Major Graham, who in this and future actions called loudly and successfully for hot coffee at each halt, saw to his coffee and his coffee-pot. Mr. Ritter, the \"Y\" man, collected thousands of francs from the men, either to keep until they came out of the line or to send to some one at home. Each officer and man was intent on making the job a success, but each one could not help but wonder if the morrow spelt \"safety,\" \"blighty,\" or \"gone west\" for him.\n\nThe attack was to be launched at 5:50 A. M. on the morning of the 29th, so on the night of the 27-28 this Regiment relieved the 118th Infantry in the right of the Divisional Sector. For 48 hours prior to the attack the enemy defenses were under a continuous bombardment. Prisoners taken later stated the shell-fire was so terrible it was impossible to bring up food and supplies. Prisoners\n\nPage 27\n\nalso stated that the attack was expected, as a British plane with a barrage map had been shot down, but the zero hour was not known.\n\nAt 4:30 A. M. all troops were reported on the tape--the 3rd Battalion on the right, the 2nd Battalion on the left, and the 1st Battalion in support. All troops were moved away from the trenches, as the enemy counter barrage was expected to come down promptly on the trench system, the tanks lumbered into position--everything was ready. Promptly at 5:50 A. M. the barrage from fourteen brigades of artillery, in addition to the heavies, came down. To this was added the machine gun barrage of all guns of the three battalions of machine guns. The machine gun barrage started a second ahead of the artillery. The troops who had closed up as close as safety permitted to the barrage shook themselves out as they moved away. All was going well when there settled over the entire area a fog so dense, which, combined with the smoke in the barrage, made it impossible to see more than six yards away. Officers lost all control over their troops. The success of the attack now depended upon the individual, and the advantage of giving each man as much information as possible was clearly seen, for without hesitation the men moved on and on. At 7:25 A. M. the main Hindenburg System had been crossed, and the mopping up battalion was maintaining a constant flow of prisoners to the rear. At 11:30 A. M. Nauroy was occupied, the Regiment was on the objective, and the Australians had passed through. At 11:45 A. M. the cleaning up of Bellicourt was completed. A part of the 117th Infantry crossed the Canal, and attacked to the right and along the east side of the Canal.\n\nThis Brigade was the first unit on the entire British front to break through the Hindenburg Line; this Regiment was the only unit taking all of its objectives in this great attack on time. German officers captured, when convinced the line was broken, said in despair, \"All is lost--there is nothing between you and the Rhine.\" The piles of empty shells at each machine gun emplacement, and the casualty list, testified to the bitterness of the fighting. The Regiment had proven its fighting worth, and had earned the confidence of its allied comrades. The spoils captured were enormous, but were left for salvage, uncounted.\n\nAfter the fight was over the units were assembled in a support position, and all expected the Regiment would pass through the Australians for another attack, but instead of attacking the Division was withdrawn from the line for a few days.\n\nPage 28\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOn October the 1st, when the Division was withdrawn from the line, this Regiment moved by marching to the Tincourt Area. On October the 2nd the movement continued, the Regiment marching to Belloy, west of Peronne. This area had been fought over for four years, changing hands time and again; as a result, it was a perfect example of destruction--of many villages nothing remained, no one would have known a house had ever existed but for the signboard marking the site. It was hard to realize that this, the Somme Country, had at one time been the most productive part of France. On October the 5th the Regiment returned to the Tincourt Area, and on October the 6th the movement continued to Villeret.\n\nOn the night of the 4-5 of October the Division, with the 59th Brigade in line, relieved the 2nd Australian Division. The 59th Brigade, which had an easy time on the 29th, was to attack on the morning of the 8th from the vicinity of Montbrehain. The 27th American Division composed the reserve for the 2nd American Corps. On the afternoon of the 8th of October this Regiment, less the 1st and 2nd Battalions, moved to Joncourt.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Battalions were sent forward on the 8th as reserve battalions for the 59th Brigade. Two companies, \"A\" and \"B,\" were used in the front line near Premont, and \"D\" Company was used in the taking and mopping up of Brancourt.\n\nOn the night of October 8-9 orders were received at 2:00 A. M. for this Regiment to follow the 118th Infantry of the 59th Brigade, holding the general line Premont-Brancourt in an attack to be launched at 5:30 A. M. Three hours and a half is an exceedingly short time in which to prepare orders and distribute them to the troops under the best of conditions. The orders were quickly prepared and distributed to the 3rd Battalion, Machine Gun Company, and Headquarters Company, who were well in hand. Officers, who fortunately had the use of the Brigade Commander's car, left to get in touch with the 1st and 2nd Battalions. At the 59th Brigade Headquarters they were told that they, the 59th Brigade, had not notified the battalions of this Regiment that the command had returned to the 60th Brigade, and, furthermore, they only had time to notify their own units. In spite of the lack of assistance given by this Brigade the battalions were located, and the battalion commanders by almost superhuman effort collected their companies and followed the 118th Infantry--the 2nd Battalion on the right, the 1st Battalion on the left, and the 3rd Battalion in support. In this and in future engagements the 3rd Battalion, in support, was engaged shortly after the attacking battalions went into action. This Regiment was to pass through the 118th Infantry, when it reached its objective, and should have done so about 10:00 A. M.\n\nPage 29\n\nThe 118th was held up, however, by machine gun fire from the right, and this Regiment did not pass through and take its objective until 4:00 P. M. The villages of Becquigny and La Haie Meneresse and the Bois De Busigny were taken, and a platoon from the 3rd Battalion was diverted to assist in taking the town of Bohain, where the unit on the right was held up.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of \"G\" Company, as usual, went in with sword in one hand and spade in the other--close on his heels came his orderly, Turner, with an S. O. S. rocket, which neither one knew how to use.\n\nOn the morning of the 10th the advance continued, and after severe fighting the town of Vaux Andigny was taken. This position was enfiladed from the Bellvue Farm on the right, and, as the right of the Regiment was nearly 3,000 yards in the air, the troops were withdrawn a few hundred yards to the western edge of Vaux Andigny. On the morning of the 11th the 118th Infantry, who had come up too late to take care of the right of this Regiment, attacked through this Regiment, but was unable to advance more than 200 yards. On the evening of the 11th the line was established east of Vaux Andigny, and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, this Regiment, established touch with the 6th British Division on the right. On the night of the 11th this Regiment was relieved by a regiment from the 27th Division and proceeded by marching to Brancourt. On the morning of the 10th Major Boddie was wounded, and Captain Stone took command of the 3rd Battalion.\n\nIn this and future engagements the Machine Gun Company and the special units were divided between the three battalions, and advanced with them.\n\nThe country fought over was hilly, with many woods and plenty of hedges, making an ideal country for the effective use of machine guns. The enemy gave up no ground without a fight, and was apparently making a desperate effort to hold the line of the La Selle River.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAt Brancourt the men were given as much rest as possible, about the only detail work done was to bury dead horses and Boches. Improvised bathing facilities were made and every one had a bath of a kind.\n\nOn the night of October 15-16 orders were received for an attack by the Division on the morning of the 17th. The 59th Brigade took over the line in the same place it had been turned over to the 27th Division, and the entire divisional front was the front of this Regiment in the last operation.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 16th the Regiment moved from Brancourt to a wooded area on west of railroad and west of Becquigny; during the night the woods were shelled by the enemy, and\n\nPage 30\n\nsome casualties were inflicted. On the morning of the 17th the Regiment was formed up with the 2nd Battalion on the right, the 1st Battalion on the left, and the 3rd Battalion in support. The 59th Brigade attacked at zero hour behind a creeping barrage, and supported by tanks storming the heights of the La Selle River. This Regiment, following the 118th at 2,000 yards, was to pass through and carry on when they reached their objective, but as the 118th Infantry did not reach their objective this Regiment did not pass through. On the night of the 17th the line held by the 118th Infantry was taken over by this Regiment; the 119th taken over from the 117th Infantry on the right, the 27th Division (American) being on the left of this Regiment. At 5:30 A. M. on the mornings of the 18th and 19th the Regiment attacked successfully, taking the town of Mazinghein, and advancing to heights west of Caillon and overlooking the Sambre Canal. The country fought over was very similar to that in the vicinity of Vaux Andigny, and the desperate resistance of the enemy resulted in but few prisoners being taken--practically all of the enemy having to be killed.\n\nOne battalion of the 118th Infantry was furnished this Regiment as a reserve, but it never became necessary to use it, so during the entire fighting it followed this Regiment at about 1,000 yards.\n\nThe Division had now become so depleted in strength it was withdrawn to be refilled and refitted, the line being taken over by the 1st British Division on the night of October 19-29; this Regiment on relief going to St. Souplet; on the 20th the movement continued to Busigny; on the 21st to Nauroy; on the 22nd to Tincourt; and on the 23rd the Regiment entrained at Tincourt, detraining at Heilly and marching to a billeting area about 10 miles north of Amiens. Headquarters 1st and 2nd Battalions going to Montigny, 3rd Battalion and Headquarters and Machine Gun Companies to Brancourt Sur L'Hallue, and Supply Company to Lahoussoye.\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nShortly after reaching the Montigny area the Regiment received about 300 replacements, these were the first replacements received by the Regiment, also a good many men who had been wounded at Ypres were returned to their organizations.\n\nWhile at Montigny the first and only Regimental Party was held. It was given to the officers of the Regiment by those officers who had been promoted while in France, a great many escaped by being wounded. The only outside officers were the Colonel of the 119th Infantry, the Chief of Staff, and G 1. The Brigade Commander was greatly opposed to the party, expressing the belief it would be nothing but a \"caribou wallow.\" While it was not known exactly\n\nPage 31\n\nwhat he meant, it was gathered that a \"caribou wallow\" was quite a function in the Old Regular Army. The party was a great success, only one casualty, and two missing. It was hoped to have had another, but an opportunity never offered itself, much to the regret of all.\n\nTraining was started as soon as the men were given a very brief rest, every effort being made to correct errors developed in actual combat. While every man felt the end was not far distant, the Regiment fully expected to jump off at least once more before the collapse came--so the morning of the 11th of November found the Regiment engaged in a problem preparing for an attack the latter part of the week. Just as the problem was about to begin, at 10:00 A. M., a message was received announcing the signing of the Armistice. The troops were told the good news, the problem called off, and a holiday declared.\n\nAfter the Armistice, until the Regiment embarked for home, work was carried on, but now the incentive was lacking, and it became more and more difficult to maintain interest or enthusiasm in doing \"impossible problems on impassable roads.\"\n\nA week after the Armistice the Division was transferred from the British to the American Army in the Le Mans Embarkation Area. This Regiment marched to Corbie where it entrained, detraining at Beaumont and marching to billets; Regimental Headquarters, Headquarters and Supply Companies to Segrie; 3rd Battalion to Vernie, 2nd Battalion to Meseziers, and Machine Gun Company to Asse Le Riboul. The villages of St. Christopher, St. Sabine, and Sille were also used later on. This area was in every respect the most unsatisfactory in which the Regiment was ever billeted.\n\nThe Division was reviewed and inspected by General Pershing, Commander-in-Chief, on January 21, 1919. A few days later it moved by marching to the Forwarding Camp at Le Mans, stopping for one night en route in the Montbizot area.\n\nWhile in the Montigny area Major Graham was sent home to command new troops as a Lieutenant-Colonel, but his promotion was stopped by the Armistice. Major Comstock was assigned to the Regiment and placed in command of the 2nd Battalion. Captain Leonard, who had been in command of the 1st Battaliion, and Captain Jenkins were promoted to Majors, the latter going to the 3rd Battalion. A new lot of most excellent Lieutenants were also assigned to the Regiment. At Segrie and Forwarding Camp a great many changes were made, many officers going to the Army of Occupation and were replaced by officers from the 3rd Division, most of whom were later sent home with casual troops from Bordeaux. Several officers left to take advantage of the courses offered at British and French Universities. Lieutenant-Colonel Scott, now Colonel Scott, took command of the Regiment--Colonel\n\nPage 32\n\nMinor assuming command of the Brigade. Major McClintock was given the 3rd Battalion and Major Walker the 2nd Battalion.\n\nEarly in March the Regiment was moved by rail from the Forwarding Camp to the Embarkation Camp at St. Nazaire. This camp was the best in every respect in which this Regiment had been located and was a credit to those in charge. The final decision to land the Division in Charleston instead of New York delayed the sailing, and it was not until the 1st of April that the last of this Regiment cleared for home. The Regiment had been broken into detachments after having been filled to strength, and now every state in the Union was represented, except three, so each one felt when half of the Regiment with the Regimental Commander sailed on U. S. Transport Powhatan that he was bidding his friends a last farewell. Fortunately two days later the remainder of the Regiment embarked on U. S. Transport Martha Washington, and the Regiment was together again at Camp Jackson before being mustered out.\n\nThe voyage over was uneventful. The naval officers and men endeavored to make the return home as pleasant as possible; the troops were landed at Charleston, where they were well taken care of by the Red Cross. An hour after landing the first train pulled out for Camp Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nOn the 16th of April the Regiment paraded in Charlotte, North Carolina. The people of this Carolina city gave the Regiment a royal welcome, and their unstinted hospitality will always be a cherished memory to all ranks.\n\nOn the 17th practically every man had received his little red chevron and his Honorable Discharge--men who had lived, suffered, and fought together were going home. There was many a tear in many an eye as hands were clasped for the last time. They had written the history of their Regiment, a record of their successes--a record that needs no explanation or apology.\n\nFor our British comrades in arms the Regiment has the highest regard. We often disagreed, but they accepted us and treated us as one of their own. They gave us their splendid Australian Artillery, they fed us, they equipped us, they clothed us, they protected us in the air, and we profited by their four years of experience in warfare. We feel honored in having been selected to serve with them; we feel their Generals are our Generals, their armies our armies, and their successes our successes.\n\nTo our French interpreters--the \"Duke,\" the \"Count,\" and M. Jacques Rouilly, who was killed in action--we express our thanks. Their services were honest, faithful, and efficient. The interest of the Regiment was safe in their hands.\n\nPage 33\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe only places in France which hold the affections and loving memory of this Regiment are those little bits of hallowed ground in Flanders' Fields, and the desolate country of the Somme, where those of this Regiment who gave their lives heroically for humanity sleep side by side with the brave men of many lands--in the most glorious death that comes to man.\n\n\"Sleep, Soldiers!

E. F.\n\nMY DEAR GENERAL LEWIS:\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to extend to you and the officers and men of the 30th Division my sincere compliments upon their appearance at the review and inspection on the 21st of January, southwest of Teille, which was excellent, and is just what would be expected in a command with such a splendid fighting record.\n\nAfter its preliminary training the Division entered the line on July 16th, where it remained almost continuously until the end of October. In that time it was in the actual battle from 30th of August, and took part in the Ypres-Lys and Somme offensives. On September 29th, the Division broke through both the Hindenburg and the Le Catelet-Nauroy lines, capturing Bellicourt and Nauroy, an operation on which all subsequent action of the 4th British Army depended. From October 7th to October 20th, the Division advanced 23 kilometers in a continued series of attacks, capturing 2,352 of the enemy. Brancourt, Premont, Busigny, St. Bernin, St. Souplet and Escaufort, La Haie Mineresse, and Vaux Andigny are names which will live in the memories of those who fought in the 30th Division. But its especial glory will always be the honor you won by breaking the Hindenburg Line on September 29th. Such a record is one of which we are all proud.\n\nIt is gratifying to see your troops in such good physical shape, but still more so to know that this almost ideal condition will continue to the end of their service and beyond, as an exemplification of their high character and soldierly qualities.\n\nI inspected the artillery brigade of the Division later, and found the same high standard of personnel that marks the rest of the Division.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJOHN J. PERSHING.\"\n\nNo. 9. The Regimental Commander's farewell message, March 9, 1919:\n\n\"To the Officers and Men of the 120th Infantry:\n\n1. A few more days and we shall embark for home. No one knows how the detachments will be handled, but the chances are many of us will never meet again.\n\n2. This Regiment came into the service as a National Guard unit from North Carolina, augmented later by national guardsmen from South Carolina and Tennessee, and still later by selective draft men from several camps, the principal units now being as follows: North Carolina, 1,558;\n\nPage 39\n\nTennessee, 406; Indiana, 281; Kentucky, 259; and many other detachments, until to-day every state in the Union is represented except four. North Carolina will claim us as her own, and we are justly proud of the record her sons have made, but we owe a debt of gratitude to the other loyal sons from many states, who helped to make our glorious record, that we can never repay, and which can never be forgotten.\n\n3. To-day this Regiment and its record belongs to the individual men who compose it, as a priceless heritage, wherever you may go. Its achievements must ever remain a brilliant chapter in American Military History, and particularly so in the 30th Division, in which splendid Division you have played the leading part.\n\n4. How you were moulded into an efficient fighting unit, that knew no North, South, East or West; how you bore the first shock of battle, and then with thinner ranks pressed on and on, laughing at dangers, with never a murmur and never a complaint, is a story too long to be told here.\n\n5. In parting with you it is my one desire to let you know how your efforts are appreciated and admired, and I hope that your pleasant associations with the 120th Infantry may linger in your memories long after your hardships have been forgotten. That you may return to your homes stronger men, more loyal citizens, and more devoted husbands, sons, and brothers is the earnest prayer of one who counts it the glory and privilege of a lifetime to have commanded such men.\n\nS.

F.\n\nTo: The Commanding Officer, 120th Infantry.\n\nSubject: Service of the 120th Infantry.\n\nI have already endeavored to express verbally to your officers my high appreciation, as Division Commander, of the loyalty and support uniformly given by them. As you are now about to return to the United States, it\n\nPage 40\n\nis desired to bear further testimony to the excellent service rendered by the Regiment as a whole throughout all of the experiences in Europe of the Division.\n\nDuring the preparatory period it set itself seriously and industriously to the task of training, and when called upon for offensive action, both in Belgium and France, acquitted itself admirably, and won the full approbation of its superiors. It can lay down its arms with just pride in its achievements, and a feeling of satisfaction that its merit has been fully recognized and appreciated.\n\nMay you as individuals realize your reasonable expectations of a tremendous welcome and every evidence of a peoples' gratitude.\n\nE. M. LEWIS,\n\nMajor-General, U. S. A.\"\n\nNo. 12. General Sir John Monash's speech, July 4, 1918, London, extract:\n\nGeneral Monash had under his command in the closing days of the war the whole Second American Army Corps, more than 60,000 men of the 27th and 30th American Divisions. This army, he said, overthrew the Hindenburg defense system at its \"most strongly defended point.\"\n\nThe share of the American Divisions in these operations was characterized by General Monash as \"probably the greatest single American feat of arms achieved in the whole war.\" The operations were completed on October 5th, he said, and it was on that night that \"the Germans threw up the sponge and declared their willingness to make peace on our own terms.\"\n\nAPPENDIX \"C\"\n\nDecorations awarded men of this Regiment for acts of gallantry, both British and American, up to time of going to press. There are a considerable number not yet reported on and these will doubtless be heard from at a later date.\n\nBRITISH DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER\n\nMAJOR ABRAM R.

He continued this work until he was blinded by the effects of the gas.\"\n\nBEN F. DIXON, Captain, Infantry.\n\n\"For extraordinary heroism in action near Bellicourt, France, September 29, 1918. He was severely wounded during the early part of the operations against the Hindenburg Line; his company having only one officer, he remained on duty. Shortly afterwards he received a second wound, and again refused to leave his men. When he saw that the front waves of his company were getting into a barrage he at once went forward to stop them, and while doing so he was killed.\"\n\nROBERT MARSHALL TEACHEY, Private, Company \"B.\"\n\n\"For extraordinary heroism in action near Ypres, Belgium, August 2, 1918.

As observer in a De Haviland 4-plane, he flew an infantry contact mission over the line of the 7th Division. Because of exceedingly adverse weather conditions, he disregarded the danger of fire from the ground and crossed the lines at 1,000 feet altitude. While thus flying he was wounded in the shoulder by an explosive bullet fired from the ground. Disregarding his wound, he came down to an altitude as low as 500 feet. After securing the desired information, he wrote out his message with great effort and dropped it to the Division.\"\n\nPage 42\n\nJAMES W.

With five other soldiers Private Cox succeeded in breaking up three machine-gun nests and capturing eight prisoners under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire.
