        "text": "July 29, 2024\n\nCHARLOTTE - Betty Lou Barbee Graham, 85, passed away Monday, July 29, 2024, at her home. Betty bravely fought a courageous battle against cancer with optimism and determination.\n\nBetty was born and raised in Midland, NC, the daughter of the late George Leonard Barbee and Helen Beatty Barbee. She moved to Charlotte after graduating from Pfeiffer College and received her master’s degree from UNCC. She dedicated her life to public education, beginning as a passionate educator and later serving as a respected principal. Throughout her career, she impacted countless lives, inspiring students and colleagues alike with her commitment to learning and leadership.\n\nShe loved her time at the beach, decorating her home for the holidays and serving on the “Room in the Inn” team at her church. All who knew her would agree that you rarely had to guess her opinions. She had a passion for being with others and her presence in a room brought laughter and love during special moments with friends and family, especially when it was “wine time.”\n\nBetty is survived by her four children; Jennifer McGinnis (Stephen) of Ft. Mill, SC; Kevin Graham (Nicole Salimbene) of Bronxville, NY; David Hollifield (Jayne) of Pineville, NC; Anna Hollifield (Charlie Cover) of Charlotte, NC; her sister, Olivia Barbee Sasser, and her four grandchildren; Kyle Baxter, Clay Baxter, Ben Hollifield, Will Graham.\n\nIn addition to her parents, Betty was preceded in death by her husband, Charles William Graham.\n\nA service to celebrate Betty’s life will be held at 2:00 PM on Wednesday, August 7, 2024, in the sanctuary of Myers Park Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Myers Park Presbyterian Church; 2501 Oxford Place, Charlotte, NC 28207.\n\nArrangements are in the care of Kenneth W. Poe Funeral & Cremation Service, 1321 Berkeley Ave., Charlotte, NC 28204; (704) 641-7606. Online condolences may be shared at www.kennethpoeservices.com."
