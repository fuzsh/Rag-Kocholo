        "text": "Leonard Henry Knauf, 92, of Crystal Lake, IL, passed away peacefully at home on Friday, September 10, 2021, surrounded by his loving family. Len was born March 11, 1929 to Charles and Lillian Knauf in Alexandria, MN, and graduated from Crystal Lake Central High School in 1948.\n\nLen was a proud, Korean War, US Army veteran. He also served his community, as well as his country, by volunteering for many activities and clubs including Jaycees, Christ the King and St. Thomas Churches, Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. Len was well known for his community involvement, and as a businessman as the long-time owner of the “Old Mill Inn” in Wonder Lake, with his wife, Betty, of 65 years, who preceded him in death 3 years ago. Len always made the guests feel welcome with his cheerful personality and the many stories and jokes he shared with everyone he met.\n\nLen’s biggest joy was raising his 5 children. He loved being involved in their lives along with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren's lives. There is nothing he wouldn't do for them and gave selflessly to help them achieve their life goals. His love for cooking and entertaining shined through as there is nothing he enjoyed more than to sit with friends and family with a glass of wine and tell endless stories. He also loved everything about the outdoors including camping, boating, and fishing.\n\nLen is survived by his sons, Mike (Laura), Jim (Colleen) and Bob (Carol); daughters, Mary and Judy (Jesse) Garcia; grandchildren, Nicole Graff, Daniel (Lindsay) Graff, Elyse (Joe) Montesano, Anna Keck, Karina Garcia, Katie (Luke) Engstrom, Jesse (Brooke) Garcia, Kelly Knauf, Emma Knauf; Kathryn Knauf and Matthew Knauf; great-grandchildren, Adalyn, Colton, Carter and Ransom as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; his beloved wife Betty, his sisters, Marcella, Marion, Barbara and Gertrude; and his granddaughter, Haley Johnson.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The American Heart Association, www.heart.org/donate."
