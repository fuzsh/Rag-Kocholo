        "text": "It’s with sadness that that we announce the passing of Leonard Warren Bearresto, father, grandfather and great grandfather on September 20, 2019. Dad lost his battle with Alzheimer’s disease surrounded by his family. Len was born in Charlo, NB on October 5, 1933. He is survived by his children Karen (John) and Wanda (Kevin); his grandchildren Adam, Katheryn, Ashley, Danielle and Jan; his great grandchildren, Kaylen, Chase, Keegan, Graham and Dominic. He is also survived by his sister Gwen (Pat); his brothers, Roland (Anna Lee), Warren (Karen), Lloyd (Lynn) and sister in law Jeannie. He is also survived by several nieces and nephews and by the mother of his children, Pamela Bearresto. He was preceded by his parents Garnet and Henrietta; his siblings Jean, Linda, Ronnie and Wendell. Dad was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces for a number of years then, upon retiring, opened his own garage - Len’s Esso in Jemseg, NB. He then worked at Tractors and Equipment before fully enjoying his retirement. Alzheimer’s disease creates such a bizarre and unfair grieving process for families. We feel like we lost our dad, grandfather, and great grandfather a long time ago, but there was no funeral, no obituary, no headstone, no closure. We are now comforted knowing that dad knows who dad is again. A special thank you Dr. Haines and to all the staff at Mill Cove Nursing Home for the wonderful care and for making dad’s last years comfortable. At dad’s request there will be no visitation. There will be a private family service. Memorial contributions can be made to the Shriners Hospital, Alzheimer Society or donors choice."
