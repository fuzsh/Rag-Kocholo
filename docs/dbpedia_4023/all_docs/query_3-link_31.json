The recipients of the Chair are experienced members of the School faculty who demonstrate a love of the discipline of English, exemplary teaching skills, and a deep concern for students as individuals. The Chair is awarded annually by the Head of School after consultation with the School’s academic Division Heads.\n\nThis is a Faculty Chair established in 2011 by Louise Y. Meledin, 1970, in loving memory of her parents, to honor the Roland Park Country School faculty who served under Anne Healy, Headmistress from 1950 to 1975. The recipients of the Chair are members of the School faculty whose enthusiasm for their discipline is infectious and whose joy in learning is matched by a commitment to sharing that spirit with their students. Faculty members who receive this honor are selected, annually, by the Head of School in consultation with the School’s academic Division Heads.\n\nThese prizes were established and endowed by the descendants of IDA Kemp Cockey Passano, 1921 and the family of E. Magruder Passano, Jr., as encouragement to the faculty to look for and elicit the best from within themselves and each other. The Passano Chairs and Sans Tache Prizes are awarded annually to Senior and Junior faculty members who display inventiveness and imagination in the use of verbal, visual, and/or written communication. The recipients personify the high standards of excellence and personal integrity that are the hallmarks of RPCS, demonstrate a commitment to discovering the unique talents of each child, and promote student self-awareness, self-worth and school spirit through the process of recognizing and nurturing each child’s inherent goodness, intelligence, kindness, and creative abilities.\n\nThis fund was endowed in 2016 through a generous gift from Mr. Milot in honor of his wife Martha Orrick Milot, 1951 and in memory of her mother Mattie Riggs Orrick for whom education was the most valuable gift.
