We invite everyone in the community to grow kind, grow local with us.

We place an emphasis on growing kind. This means that we practice and teach growing practices that are kind to our environment and our water streams. We teach unconventional methods that will continue to be sustainable through the years.

Born and raised in Duluth, MN, we have a connection to community and an understanding the importance of local. We offer local and organic products and work with area farms to bring you new (and trusted) organic plants and seeds. We also carry American-made goods whenever possible.

From tomatoes to peppers, house plants to cannabis, we have been growing inside and out in this climate for 25 years. We provide expert advice and consultation, adapting to your needs and specific growing questions and concerns.

We offer classes and guest speaker lectures on all topics agriculture related. From transplanting, soil building, beekeeping, genetics, cannabis growing, and macrame, to working with regional plants and foliage, and much more.
