        "text": "Abraham Lincoln was born in Hardin County, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1809.\n\nHis family moved to Indiana in 1816, and Lincoln lived there the rest of his youth.\n\nHis mother died from a milk sickness when he was 9.\n\nHis father remarried, and Lincoln was quite close to his stepmother, who urged him to read.\n\nHis party was Republican.\n\nLincoln lost the first time he ran for public office: a seat in the Illinois House in 1832. He finished eighth of thirteen candidates.\n\nHis wife was Mary Todd Lincoln, who was brought up in a wealthy family; her parents disagreed about her marriage to Lincoln because of his poor background.\n\nLincoln had four children: Robert Todd Lincoln, Edward Lincoln, Willie Lincoln and Tad Lincoln; only Robert Todd Lincoln survived into adulthood.\n\nRobert Todd Lincoln, who served as Secretary of War under Presidents Garfield and Arthur, was present when three presidents died. He was at his father's deathbed. He was an eyewitness to President Garfield's assassination in 1881. And he was present, though not an eyewitness, when President McKinley was shot in 1901.\n\nLincoln was to participate in a duel on Sept. 22, 1842. It was called off at the last minute by friends from both sides.\n\nLincoln was a lawyer, and his largest collected legal fee was $5,000, the sum he received for successfully defending the Illinois Central Railroad. When the railroad refused to pay, Lincoln sued to collect.\n\nLincoln received the nickname \"Rail Splitter\" at the Illinois Republican Convention in Decatur on May 9-10, 1860.\n\nLincoln served as president March 4, 1861, to March 3, 1865; he was assassinated soon after beginning his second term.\n\nHis vice presidents where Hannibal Hamlin and Andrew Johnson.\n\nLincoln is the only president to hold a patent. His application for a \"new and improved manner of combining adjustable buoyant chambers with steam boats or other vessels\" was granted on May 22, 1849.\n\nLincoln established the U.S. Department of Agriculture on May 15, 1862.\n\nLincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday; the first Thanksgiving was celebrated Nov. 26, 1863.\n\nLincoln created a national banking system with the National Banking Act of 1863; it resulted in a standardized currency.\n\nWest Virginia and Nevada became states while Lincoln was president.\n\nLincoln suffered from depression yet was well-known for telling stories and jokes to friends and family.\n\nLincoln was the tallest U.S president at 6-foot-4.\n\nLincoln was the first president to have a beard.\n\nA week before his death, Lincoln dreamed of someone crying in the White House. He searched, found a man in a room near a coffin and asked who passed away. \"The president,\" said the man. When Lincoln looked in the coffin he saw his own face.\n\nLincoln was the first president to be assassinated. He was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth in Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.\n\nBooth's brother, fellow actor Edwin Booth, once saved the life of Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln. Or Edwin Booth at least saved Robert Todd Lincoln from serious injury when he grabbed Robert Todd Lincoln's collar and pulled him to safety after Robert Todd Lincoln lost his balance on a train platform in 1864 or 1865 in Jersey City, N.J.\n\nRobert Lincoln had two daughters and one son. The son died as a teenager. Abraham Lincoln's great-grandchildren lived long lives but had no descendants. The last of Lincoln's direct descendants died in 1985.
