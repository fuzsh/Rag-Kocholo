        "text": "Shirley Ann Koslakiewicz, 83, of Duluth, died Monday, Aug. 28th at Elysian Assisted Living, with her family by her side. Shirley was born Feb. 13, 1940, in Duluth to John and Mary Kujawa and she attended Duluth Cathedral. She met Duane Koslakiewicz, and they were married on June 21, 1958. She was a member of St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Duluth Heights and the BPO Elks. Shirley enjoyed playing golf in the Auto Club Women’s League, playing slots, bingo, but most of all, spending time with her family, especially her grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her parents: John and Mary and her siblings: Marge (Reg) MacMillan, Dick Kujawa, and Jack Kujawa.\n\nShirley is survived by her husband of 65 years: Duane; daughters: Kim Koslakiewicz, Tammy (Gary) Lincoln, and Sherri Donaldson; grandchildren: Kelly (Randy) Tietz, Sarah (Jon) Rau, Brett Lincoln, and Katie (Michael) Skaw; 7 great grandchildren: Jacob, Makayla, Calvin, Edison, Autumn, Evelyn, and Tyler; sister-in-law: Ronnie Kujawa and her faithful dog: Carly Jo. She will be greatly missed."
