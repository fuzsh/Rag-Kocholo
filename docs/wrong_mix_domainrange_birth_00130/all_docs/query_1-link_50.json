        "text": "The moment of Birth; one body emerges from another, eyes wide and searching, seeking a familiar voice and a heartbeat that calms. First breath. First cry. First touch.\n\nOur first memory of new life is one that should be safe, supported, and full of love.\n\nFirst Memory Midwifery provides evidence-based care that combines the physiology of birth with the wisdom of mind, body & spirit.\n\nAre you ready to create a loving and powerful birth story that will last a lifetime?\n\nI’m Chandra, a traditional midwife. Daughter, Sister. Mother. Wife.\n\nI was born at home during a Minnesota blizzard and in our home, birth was talked about, simply, joyously, as a part of life. You can feel this way about birth, too.\n\nYou have the power and right to make choices in your pregnancy and birth your baby in a way that serves you. While working with me you’ll feel supported, heard, respected, loved, grounded and seen. You are strong and fiercely capable of birthing and parenting in your own way.\n\nI am passionate about perinatal autonomy, informed choice and both evidence-informed care and traditional, experiential midwifery. Birth is science and spirit, evidence and connection interwoven with a bit of transformative magic.\n\nI’d be honored to hold space during your sacred experience of growing and birthing a human being and creating a family.\n\nKIND WORDS\n\n“Chandra was the best investment we made for our prenatal, birth, and postpartum care. She offered evidence-based information, a compassionate listening ear, and reassurance that as soon-to-be parents we could make decisions for ourselves. Chandra's knowledge, expertise, and support helped us navigate pregnancy, birth, and postpartum with so much more confidence. Especially in my labor when decisions had to be made that we weren't anticipating. She was steadfast, respectful, and patient during our deliberation process. We loved our homebirth experience with Chandra and would work with her again in a heartbeat!\"\n\n—PHYLLIS"
