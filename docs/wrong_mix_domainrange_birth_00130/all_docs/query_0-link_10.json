        "text": "Duluth is a rippling stretch of rocky, wooded, steep hills, trickling with bubbling creek after creek, all which flow into the great Lake Superior. This is lovely unto itself, but there’s more to celebrate.\n\nEach of those hills is home to a neighborhood–from Fond du Lac to Smithville to Piedmont to Observation Hill to Woodland to Lakeside–thousands of people living amongst each other on these little mountains, some fancy, some not. Yet, no matter the neighborhood, in each corner of this city are wild and magnificent pockets of beauty for all to enjoy : trails of all kind and for all uses, creeks, beaches, ski hills, picnic spots, breathtaking views. I am amazed over and over again how this city has equal opportunity beauty for all and for free.\n\nI had two hopes in making this print. One, to shine a light on as many of these places as I could (there were some I didn’t know about–have you ever hiked Knowlton Creek? It was a new beauty for me!). And, two, to encourage a sort of cross-pollination exploration of our city. Folks who live in the Chester Park neighborhood likely know the creek and trails well (and therefore know the people and culture in that little nook), but what if you could also get to know the stunning cascades and bridges of Miller Creek and see faces and learn names of the good folks in Lincoln Park? Or in Norton Park along Kingsbury Creek? Imagine not only exploring the geography for a new bike ride or hike would be good, but getting to know and enjoy people all over our city would have its own goodness.\n\nTo help in these two goals I have included an 8x10 coordinating map / key / guide / exploration checklist. It highlights 30 outdoor recreational areas on a map and then lists the main activities you can do there. There’s even a little bubble to check it off, if you’re inspired to explore it all. I also encourage some Googling of the spot to find more details and interesting history.\n\nI am passionate about loving the place you live. This print is a wide open celebration of the city we live in, Duluth, Minnesota and an invitation for all of us to explore and enjoy its beauty. May we be filled with gratitude as we see how much we are given here and the beautiful people who live on each hill. It is my hope that born-and-raised Duluthians, new-comers, long-distant fans, transplants and college students of Duluth will enjoy this print.\n\nThis print is 8x29, printed on the exceptionally lovely 50/50 Rag Breathing Color 600 MT paper, titled and signed."
