        "text": "Duluth is known for being both a tourist city and a port city, but the Zenith city also had a hand on bringing 10 amazing things to America.\n\nFrom Pizza Rolls to \"in a world\", I'll be breaking down things you might not know that Duluth has brought to this world.\n\nPizza Rolls\n\nJeno Palucci has done a lot for this city, but he also helped bring pizza rolls into this world. An easy made frozen bite sized snack that has all your favorite pizza ingredients. Pizza rolls are a pretty big deal and was even featured in a pretty funny SNL skit a few years ago.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nDefinitely can't leave Grammy and Academy Award winning artist Bob Dylan off this list. Sure he's not a huge fan of Duluth, but Duluthians will be forever be grateful for his music and legacy. He's even won a Golden Globe and a Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nPie รก la Mode\n\nThis delicious dessert consists of a slice of pie topped with a scoop of ice cream. It was created in 1885 by Duluthian John Gieriet.\n\nDon LaFontaine\n\nVoice-over actor Don LaFontaine was born in Duluth and most known for voicing movie trailers and popularizing the phrase \"in a world\". Don graduated from Central High School in 1958. Following complications from a collapsed lung, he passed away in 2008 but his legacy lives on.\n\nParachute Recovery System\n\nThanks to Duluth-based Cirrus Aircraft and Ballistic Recovery Systems, the very first whole-plane emergency parachute recovery system was made. It was designed to save the pilot and passengers in case of an emergency.\n\nC.J. Ham\n\nBorn in Duluth and graduated from Denfeld High School, C.J. is currently the starting Fullback on the Minnesota Vikings. Can't wait to see what Ham and the Vikes do this year. SKOL Vikes!\n\nFirst Mall In The U.S.\n\nThe Lake View Store was the very first modern indoor mall in the United States. It was built in 1916 in the Morgan Park neighborhood. The mall was two stories with a pharmacy, department store with groceries, a butcher shop, clothing store and more on the first floor. On the second floor you could find a bank, dentist office, barber shop, billiard room, auditorium and a few other stores. The basement even had a shoe store and ice making plant. The mall was later remolded for each store to be accessible from the outside and is still in use today.\n\n'Iron Will'\n\nDisney's 1994 adventure film 'Iron Will' was primarily filmed in Duluth and along the shores of Lake Superior. The film was about a boy named Will who registers for a marathon dog sled race in hopes to help his mom from struggling financially and tries to keep his dad's legacy alive.\n\nElectric Elevator\n\nIn 1887, Duluthian inventor Alexander Miles patented the electric elevator. He didn't invent the elevator, but he did improve the opening and closing of the doors, as well as improving the elevator shaft. At the time, everything was done manually.\n\nTrampled By Turtles\n\nHow can I not mention the folk-rock band from Duluth, Trampled By Turtles? The band has performed at festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and more. They even made their live television performance on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" back in 2012. Three of their albums reached number 1 on the billboard charts and they will always be a local favorite.\n\nVerne Lundquist\n\nVerne was born in Duluth in 1940 and became the voice of the Dallas Cowboys in 1967. Verne is a legendary sportscaster and even commentated in the 1996 hit film 'Happy Gilmore'. I'll leave you with one of my favorite Lundquist quotes when commentating the 1994 Winter Olympics:\n\nWell, this bizarre real life movie continues."
