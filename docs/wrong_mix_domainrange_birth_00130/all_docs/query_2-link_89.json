        "text": "Located in central Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park was established on July 17, 1916 as the countryâ€™s first memorial to the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the park has two separate sites where Abraham Lincoln was born and lived early in his childhood. The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace Unit features a Visitors Center, the Memorial Building with a symbolic cabin, Sinking Spring that was a water source for the Lincoln Family, and the site of Boundary Oak Tree that was used for a survey marker, two hiking trails, and a picnic area. The Abraham Lincoln Boyhood Home Unit is home to the Ranger Station (open in summer only), Knob Creek that was a water source for the Lincoln family, a hiking trail and picnic area. Visits are self-guided from Labor Day to Memorial Day, with ranger led tours available from Memorial Day until Labor Day."
