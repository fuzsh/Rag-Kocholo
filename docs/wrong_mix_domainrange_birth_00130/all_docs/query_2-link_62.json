        "text": "Visitors in wheelchairs or who have trouble walking up steps can take the Pathway of a President Trail that leads from the Visitor Center to the rear of the Memorial Building, which is where the entrance is located. The start of the trail is on the right side of the building. It is a .2-mile boardwalk that is wheelchair accessible, but be aware that there are some mild slopes to deal with. It is not completely flat.\n\nI suppose that if the log cabin inside the memorial was actually Lincoln’s birth home, seeing it might be a worthwhile endeavor. However, it’s just a log cabin, and one that you can’t go inside to boot, so there’s not much of a thrill in seeing it. Standing on the location where Lincoln was most likely born is what a visit to the Memorial Building is all about.\n\nThe actual Sinking Spring that gives the farm its name is located at the base of the Memorial Building staircase. Stairs lead into a small sinkhole and down to the water source. The spring is not handicap accessible.\n\nOff to the left of the Memorial Building is a large cabin and four smaller cabins, none of which are part of the national park. Back when the Lincoln Farm Association bought the property and made plans for the memorial, businessman and long-time LaRue County resident James Howell had wanted to capitalize on the tourism by purchasing the adjacent land and opening some sort of attraction, but the land did not come up for sale until 1928. At that time he made the purchase and opened the Nancy Lincoln Inn where tourists could purchase a meal or spend the night in one of the cabins. Though not authentic, the inn and cabins have since become historical in their own right and were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\n\nHowell operated the overnight accommodations through the mid-1940s. By then, his main source of revenue had become Lincoln souvenirs, and in building up that part of the business he also managed to put together an impressive Lincoln memorabilia collection that he put on display inside the inn. Howell was a Lincoln enthusiast from the start, which is part of the reason he purchased the adjacent property to begin with.\n\nAfter Howell’s death, his son Carl, and then Carl’s daughter Pamela, continued to operate the inn until 2016, at which time it was closed for good. To me it’s a missed opportunity. With 250,000 visitors a year to Abraham Lincoln National Historical Park, I don’t see how somebody couldn’t make money by operating a restaurant. There’s nowhere to eat in the immediate area, and even in downtown Hodgenville there’s not many restaurants to choose from. You have a captive audience right next door.\n\nPlan to spend about a half hour for the walk to and from the memorial, plus a brief stop inside to see the cabin. There are also a number of wayside exhibits you can read as you stroll through the grounds. For those who want a little exercise, the short Boundary Oak Trail begins just to the left of the Memorial Building and ends at the back entrance.\n\nBack to the Top"
