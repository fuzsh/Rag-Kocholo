        "text": "WillhiteWeb.com\n\nTo learn about the humble beginnings of the 16th president Abraham Lincoln, a visit to rural central Kentucky is required. His early life on Kentucky's frontier shaped his character and prepared him to lead the nation through Civil War. The country's first memorial to Lincoln built between 1909 to 1911, eleven years before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. It was built with donations and enshrines the symbolic birthplace cabin. This first Lincoln Memorial was built by the Lincoln Farm Association on the traditional site of the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln. He was born in a single room log cabin here on his father's Sinking Spring Farm on Sunday, February 12, 1809. His legacy of liberty and equality remains relevant today and has impacted people around the world.\n\nThe Sinking Spring, located just below the hill on which Abraham Lincoln was born, was clearly identified in early land records. This water source was variably known as Sinking Spring, Rock Spring, and Cave Spring. However, early records generally refer to the landmark as Sinking Spring because the water dropped into a pit and disappeared into the earth. Thus, originated the name of the farm. As a perennial source of water, the spring was probably a deciding factor in Thomas Lincoln's selection for the location of the Lincoln cabin site. The Lincolns depended on this spring for their daily water supply and travelers often paused during their journey to partake of the refreshingly cool water. Abraham Lincoln probably tasted his first drink of water from this spring. The appearance of the spring has changed considerably since the Lincoln era. The area of the spring was modified during the early years of park development. However, the natural rock formations along the back wall have been changed only by nature and continue to instill impressions of a homesteader's life.\n\nNancy Lincoln Inn Sign\n\nNancy Lincoln Inn\n\nBuilt in 1928 and named in honor of Abraham Lincolns mother, the inn is now a museum and souvenir shop, enter and learn important facts about young abe's birthplace and his knob creek boyhood home.
