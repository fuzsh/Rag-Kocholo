        "text": "Richard joined the DBS family in 2023 as a field supervisor in our Basement Finishing services. He came to DBS with many different career backgrounds including being a foreman, press operator for the Duluth News Tribune for 21 years, and a railroad conductor for 5 years. A unique quality that Richard brings to his role is fairness and diversity. What excites him about working for DBS is that he will always be meeting new people.\n\nIn Richard's free time, he enjoys canoeing, hunting, fishing, and traveling. If he could have dinner with any historical figure, he would choose Abraham Lincoln because he is his role model."
