        "text": "Elizabeth Joan “Betty Jo” Little (Dunsmoor) passed away peacefully in her Kenwood home, Saturday, January 13, 2024.\n\nBetty Jo was born May 22, 1935 in Duluth, Minnesota to Gertrude and Sylvester Dunsmoor. The youngest of five children, she grew up in Jay Cooke State Park in a 3-house neighborhood owned by Minnesota Power. Throughout her childhood she enjoyed walleye fishing in the St. Louis River, riding the gas railcar down to Fond du Lac, playing school in her attic, and dancing with her siblings and their friends to their mother’s fantastic piano playing.\n\nAfter graduating from Morgan Park High School in 1953, Betty Jo studied teaching and graduated from the Wisconsin State College in Superior with honors and memories of her many lifelong friends she made there, and spoke fondly of the “girls from the dorm” over the years. Her career as a kindergarten teacher covered many schools from St. Louis Park, and White Bear Lake, to Lincoln Elementary in Duluth as well as the surrounding areas of Homecroft, Munger, and Cloquet.\n\nChildren and Christian life-related activities and events were essential to Betty Jo throughout her entire life, from bible camp and youth group in Fond du Lac, to teaching vacation bible school in Kelsey, MN - where she met student pastor, Tom Little, the future love of her life. Tom moved east to teach at Stony Brook in New York, while Betty Jo pursued her kindergarten teaching career. The Lord eventually brought them together again over Christmas break in 1960, when they became engaged after a few dates, and their long-distance engagement and wedding plans continued by love-letters until they were united in marriage on a sunny day in June 1961.\n\nBetty Jo quickly became the quintessential pastor's wife, a role she graciously filled and eagerly anticipated. From that day, she was ever-supportive of her husband Tom’s endeavors. Betty Jo and Tom also made time to help found the Montessori program in Duluth. Tom was both pastor of many area churches over the years as well as a schoolteacher, and throughout their married life Betty Jo was honored to stand by his side.\n\nBetty Jo and Tom added two boys, Tom Jr. and Tim to the family. Her “three boys” kept her busy and happily making memories along the way, including a year-long coast-to-coast motorhome roadtrip.\n\nIn 1978, Betty Jo fulfilled one of her own endeavors of owning and operating her own gift store, which was located in the wharf shops on Barkers Island in Superior. She named it The Vanishing Leprechaun. Her creative talents and classy taste for products and merchandising made the shop a destination spot for tourists and locals every season. She enjoyed chatting with customers, and spending time with the shop’s “employee of the year for 24 years,” her husband, Tom.\n\nAfter Tom’s passing in 2002, Betty Jo filled her time with the things she loved - family, friends, church and serving. She joined a weekly swimming group at Miller Dwan where she met a new circle of friends, attended Christian retreats at Trout Lake near Brainerd, chauffeured many friends to their appointments, served on both the Duluth Women's Club and Aftenro executive boards, and managed the Aftenro gift shop. She enjoyed taking classes in grant-writing, and loved spending time with her three grandchildren, hosting sleepovers at Nana’s in “the cozy corner”, playing board games and serving “eggs on toast” for breakfast.\n\nAnother goal Betty Jo fulfilled was a two year-journey writing a biography about the life of her husband Tom Little. They said if they ever wrote that book, it would be titled, Little by Little. In 2020 she completed the book about her loving husband Tom without his input, but we know he approves!"
