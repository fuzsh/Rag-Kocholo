        "text": "Captain Amy Bauernschmidt, who assumed command of the USS Abraham Lincoln last year and made history on January 3, 2022, when the USS Abraham Lincoln became the, “first-ever U.S. aircraft carrier skippered by a woman. The ship departed with its strike group for a regularly scheduled deployment in support of global maritime security operations.” Capt. Bauernschmidt, who is originally from Milwaukee, had another first aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. In 2016, she made history as, “the first female executive officer aboard a carrier.” The Foundation has ties to the USS Abraham Lincoln. In 2017, nearly 100 items from the Foundation’s collection were generously underwritten by Colonel J.N. Pritzker and ​donated for display aboard the carrier as the COL (IL) Jennifer N. Pritzker, IL ARNG (Retired) collection.\n\nIn recognition of National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we’re sharing the story of John Boston. Boston had been enslaved in Owensville, Maryland but succeeded in escaping to Union lines and to his freedom in January 1862. He wrote to his wife Elizabeth to share that he was free and safe with the “14th Regiment of Brooklyn.” In his letter, he expresses his fervent hope of a reunion with her saying, “My Dear I Cant express my grate desire that i Have to See you i trust the time Will Come When We Shal meet again And if We dont met on earth We Will Meet in heven Whare Jesas ranes.” He begs her to write to him soon, explaining how to get a letter to him. He closes by asking her to “Kiss Daniel For me.” and “Give my love to Father and Mother.” Lamentably, according to the National Archives and Records Administration, there is no evidence Mr. Boston’s letter made it to his dear wife. Instead, the letter eventually made its way to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.\n\nMatthew Brady, the “Father of Photojournalism” in recognition of World Photography Day on August 19th. Brady’s portrait photography—which included former President’s Taylor and Fillmore, in addition to Abraham Lincoln—and his studio’s battlefield photography have had a tremendous impact on how the war is viewed. The way Brady’s New York photography exhibit, “The Dead of Antietam” brought the horrors of war into sharp focus for the American public was unprecedented. https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/mathew-brady\n\nVictor David Brenner, in recognition of Jewish-American Heritage Month in May. Brenner is best known as the Lithuanian Jewish-American artist who designed the Lincoln one cent. Having first circulated in 1909, the Lincoln image on the observe is reportedly the “longest-running design in United States Mint history, and perhaps the most reproduced piece of art in world history.” In addition to potentially being the most reproduced piece of art in the world, it may well be the furthest traveled, too. A 1909 Lincoln penny was used by Nasa on Mars as a calibration target. For more about the history of the Lincoln penny’s design: https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/pages/lincoln-cent.aspx\n\nOn Christmas Day in 1861, President Abraham Lincoln was still dealing with the Trent Affair, an international incident that unfolded during the American Civil War. His Cabinet met that morning behind closed doors to consider the release of James Mason and John Slidell, two Confederate diplomats traveling to Europe to garner support for the Confederacy. They were on board the British RMS Trent when they were intercepted by the USS San Jacinto, on November 8, 1861.\n\nLater that day, the Lincolns hosted many guests at a Christmas dinner. After dinner, the President told Senator Orville H. Browning of Illinois that the Trent Affair had been resolved amicably.\n\nRobert Burns, in recognition of “Burns Night,” which takes places on January 25th, the famed Scottish poet’s birthday. The first “Burns Supper” as it is also sometimes known, was held in 1801, five years after the poet died. “Auld Lang Syne” is amongst the poet’s most famous and enduring works. Abraham Lincoln attended a Burns Night celebration in Springfield, IL in 1859, 100 years after Robert Burns was born. At the time it was reported that the, \"supper was splendid and abundant, and was well attended. The toasts offered on this occasion were most appropriate, and were responded to by some of the most talented men of the state, among whom were, Abraham Lincoln….” In January 1865, Lincoln wrote a message for the 106th celebration of the birth of Robert Burns. His note stated, \"I can not frame a toast to Burns. I can say nothing worthy of his generous heart, and transcendent genius.”\n\nSarah Bush Johnston Lincoln, in recognition of International Literacy Day (September 8) and National Step Family Day (September 16). According to the National Park Service, after Sarah married Thomas Lincoln and moved her children to his home in Indiana, she, “soon discovered that her new stepson was very intelligent and had a passion for knowledge; he was especially fond of reading. Consequently, her gift to him of three books left an indelible impression on him. Not only was it a priceless treasure to a boy who loved to read on a frontier where books were scarce, but it was an indication to him that Sarah would pick up where his mother had left off in terms of encouraging his quest for knowledge. The two quickly developed a close, intimate, mother-son relationship that would continue for the rest of Abraham's life.”\n\nGrandison Daniels and James Tate, in honor of Historically Black Colleges and Universities week in September. Tate and Daniels founded the school that would later evolve into Atlanta University, the first HBCU in the southern states. Although the seeds of Atlanta University preceded the Civil War, Atlanta University, today known as Clark Atlanta University, was not officially chartered until 1867, with the help of Oliver Otis Howard (namesake of Howard University) of the Freedmen’s Bureau.\n\nIn honor of the new exhibit “Lincoln’s Springfield” now open to the public in the historic Corneau House at Lincoln Home National Historic Site, our next six spotlights will cover the individuals whose stories are featured in the new exhibit, starting with Charlotte (Rodruiguis) De Souza.\n\nAccording to the Lincoln Home NHS, Charlotte was a young child in 1849 when she arrived in Springfield, IL, with her father Joseph and over 100 other refugees who had fled from religious persecution in Madeira, Portugal. A little over a decade later, she reportedly worked as a seamstress for Mary Lincoln, laboring from 7 am to 6 pm to make dresses for Mary to wear for receptions during the presidential campaigns of 1860 and the period in which Abraham Lincoln was president-elect. Charlotte married Manuel De Souza in 1860. Her passing at age 92 led to local newspapers reporting on the death of “Mrs. Lincoln’s Dressmaker.” Charlotte’s story is one of many real-world experiences that Abraham Lincoln may have encountered that demonstrated the value of America’s founding ideals.\n\nThis is the second spotlight in a series of six focused on the people featured in the new “Lincoln’s Springfield” exhibit. Last month’s spotlight focused on Charlotte Rodriguis De Souza. This month, we’re shining a spotlight on William Donnegan.\n\nWilliam Donnegan was born in Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln's home state. He moved to Springfield, Illinois, in 1845, setting up shop as a cobbler. He reportedly made a pair of boots for Abraham Lincoln. In addition to his successful shoemaking and repair business, he earned income as a real estate investor. For years, he also assisted people seeking freedom on the Underground Railroad. Decades later, during the 1908 Springfield Race Riot, a violent white mob lynched Donnegan and another Black businessman, Scott Burton. Neither of the men had any connection to the events that ignited the mob in the first place. Historians believe that Donnegan’s success in business and marriage to a white woman are two potential reasons the mob targeted him.\n\nSarah Josepha Hale, a poet and editor best known for penning “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and serving as editor for the popular Godey’s Lady’s Book for 40 years (1837-1877), is credited with influencing President Lincoln to declare an annual National Day of Thanksgiving. According to the National Women’s History Museum, starting in 1846 she focused her efforts on “the president and other leading politicians to push for the national celebration of Thanksgiving, which was then only celebrated in the Northeast. Her requests for recognition were largely ignored by politicians until 1863. While the nation was in the middle of the Civil War, President Lincoln signed into action ‘A National Day of Thanksgiving and Praise.’ Hale’s letter to Lincoln is often cited as the main factor in his decision.”\n\nCaptain James Handley, founder of National Apple Day, in honor of National Apple Month in October. Abraham Lincoln was reportedly a fan of apples and said people should eat foods that agreed with them and that apples agreed with him, so we think he would approve. James Handley was born in Rhode Island and spent much of his early years around apple orchards. He later studied botany but became involved in the press and publicity side of the fruit trade. In later years he settled in Quincy, Illinois where he helped organize the Mississippi Valley Apple Growers Association. The association was created “for the purpose of observing more closely the causes of failures in the production of fruit” and providing education and awareness on the subject.\n\nFrances Ellen Watkins Harper, for her antislavery poetry in honor of both National Poetry Month in April and the anniversary of the DC Emancipation Act on April 13th. Harper, born to free parents in Baltimore, Maryland had a successful career in literature, education, and public speaking. She fought for abolition and voting rights, effectively using her talents to emphasize the many horrors of slavery and inequality and refute those who defended the same. At the age of 20, she published her first collection of poems, Forest Leaves, which includes “Bible Defence of Slavery,” an anti-slavery poem and response to a pro-slavery piece of the same name by Josiah Priest.\n\nThis is the sixth and final spotlight in a series of six focused on the people featured in the new “Lincoln’s Springfield” exhibit. Previous spotlights featured Charlotte Rodriguis De Souza, William Donnegan, Mariah Vance, Henry Carrigan, and Francis Springer. This month, we are shining a spotlight on Jameson Jenkins.\n\nJameson Jenkins was born in North Carolina around 1810. In the mid-1830s, he left North Carolina for points west, eventually settling in Illinois with his wife Elizabeth. It is likely that his motivation to leave was due in part to North Carolina passing increasingly restrictive laws on both enslaved and free Black Americans. For example, in 1830, North Carolina made it a crime to teach an enslaved person to read or write. In 1835, the state passed a law preventing free Black people from voting, attending school, or public preaching. Though a “free state,” Illinois also had Black Codes restricting the rights of African Americans. For example, Jenkins would have been required to provide proof he was a free man. According to the National Park Service, Jameson Jenkins lived down the street from the Lincoln family and worked as a drayman, transporting cargo by wagon. Jenkins not only carried cargo, but he risked his own personal safety to help freedom seekers escaping slavery on their journey north on the Underground Railroad.\n\n*\n\nIn recognition of the upcoming Juneteenth holiday and National African-American Music Appreciation Month, we’re shining a spotlight on John “J.” Rosamond Johnson. Johnson is perhaps best known for composing the music for hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Johnson’s older brother, James Weldon Johnson, noted poet, activist and NAACP leader, wrote the lyrics to the iconic song. The older Johnson explained in 1935, that “A group of young men in Jacksonville, Florida, arranged to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday in 1900. My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us, and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children.” The children attended a segregated school in their hometown. They left Jacksonville shortly thereafter for New York. For over 100 years, the hymn has been referred to as a national anthem for Black Americans.\n\nAn early 1920s copy of the sheet music to “Lift Every Voice and Sing” may be viewed on the Library of Congress website: https://www.loc.gov/item/89751755/\n\n*\n\nNoble Johnson, in celebration of the 2021 No Malice Film Contest winners. Johnson was a successful actor, film producer, and president of The Lincoln Motion Picture Company, “considered the first all-black movie production unit in the country.” His company produced “race films,” a genre of films in the United States “consisting of films produced for black audiences, featuring black casts.” The genre itself and Johnson’s career both spanned from 1915 to the early 1950s. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425903/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\n\nThomas “Tad” Lincoln, Abraham and Mary Lincoln’s youngest son, in honor of Worldwide Bereaved Siblings Month in November. In February 1862, both Willie and Tad Lincoln fell gravely ill with typhoid fever. Tad eventually recovered from the illness, but it claimed the life of his closest brother, Willie. Unfortunately, in addition to grieving the loss of his brother, Tad had to cope without his regular playmates, the Taft children. Mary Lincoln said the Taft boys were too painful a reminder of Willie. Tad’s oldest brother, Robert, was away at Harvard. Tad reportedly began to spend even more time with his father, when he was not traveling with his mother.\n\nPaul James Lindberg, in honor of national Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month in June. Lindberg was a member of the 61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. While Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was not a medically-recognized condition or diagnosis until the 20th century, Lindberg is but one example of a Civil War veteran who wrote about a combination of symptoms that today are recognized as potential symptoms of PTSD, including intrusive memories, negative changes in thinking or mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions following trauma. As Dr. Brian Jordan chronicled in his book Marching Home: Union Veterans and Their Unending Civil War, “On several occasions, Lindberg came perilously close to suicide. He sought a final discharge from that ‘dread sound of cannon’ and those ‘agonizing groans of the dying’ ringing in his ears, but ultimately realized that he could not take his own life.” If you or someone you know is a Veteran in crisis, resources are available at: https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/.\n\nFrançois-Dominique Toussaint Louverture, the “Father of Haiti,” in recognition of the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition on August 23rd. While the date is meant to acknowledge the global history of human enslavement and efforts to resist it across time and place, August 23rd is connected specifically to the first major uprising against the slave trade in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic), where General Louverture had been born into slavery and later fought for independence from France. Louverture was jailed by the French and died, imprisoned in France, in 1803, prior to Haiti’s establishment as a sovereign state in 1804. Six decades later, Haiti’s Île à Vache was the site of a disastrous, failed attempt under the Lincoln administration to resettle freedmen outside the United States."
