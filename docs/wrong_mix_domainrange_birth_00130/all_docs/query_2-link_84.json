        "text": "BOSTIC\n\nAmong Rutherford County residents, it has been called \"one of the most hidden stories of history.\"\n\nIt is not a story found in the history books, but, for generations, families have told the tale to their children and grandchildren.\n\nThere are embellishments here and there, discrepancies, but the basic story stays the same: Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States, was not born, as commonly believed, in a small Kentucky log cabin, but in a log plantation home at a place called Puzzle Creek in Rutherford County.\n\nThere was enough oral history that books discussing the possibility began to be published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and, in 2008, with the help of local supporters, the Bostic Lincoln Center opened in a quaint 1928 train depot in downtown Bostic. Its mission, the museum states, is to \"preserve the generational lore of the area.\"\n\nLess than two miles away, where a bridge crosses Puzzle Creek and the road takes a bend, is Lincoln Hill. A stone foundation and cellar are still there, up the hill from where a stone marker at the edge of the woods proclaims 1806, not 1809, as the date of Lincoln's birth and this area, not backwoods Kentucky, as the birthplace.\n\nOn Saturday, at the museum and on adjacent grounds, a festival will be held marking the museum's first five years of operation. Festivities include a drama, \"Nancy Hanks, Bondwoman,\" from the 1939 edition of American Folk Plays, edited by Frederick Henry Koch, founder of UNC Chapel Hill's Carolina Playmakers, and performed by the Rutherford Community Theatre.\n\nNancy Hanks mystery\n\nNancy Hanks was Lincoln's mother, and historians know little about her early life. Lincoln himself, according to biographies, said that she was born out of wedlock to Lucy Hanks. Lucy, it was said by North Carolinians, was an itinerant spinner from Virginia who lived in Gaston County for a time, then wandered with her two daughters around Rutherford County looking for work. When Nancy was about 10 years old, she was bound out as a servant to the Abraham Enloe family, and her sister, Amanda, to another family.\n\nNancy spent years with the Enloes where, some believe, she was taught to read, although some biographies call her illiterate. When grown to a young woman, Nancy was found one day to be pregnant. The Enloes had, by this time, moved to the Oconaluftee area near Cherokee.\n\nWhen Mrs. Enloe objected to Nancy's being in the family home in her condition, and possibly suspecting her husband as the father, arrangements were made, the story goes, to take the young woman back to the family's home at Puzzle Creek. It was here, some believe, that she gave birth around 1806 to a son she named Abraham.\n\nWhen Tom Lincoln passed through the area, locals said, he was given money, a wagon and horses to take responsibility for Nancy and the baby. Area residents later spoke of holding Nancy's baby before seeing her off as she and Lincoln headed west. Other biographies and historical accounts mention a claim by the Methodist deacon who married the two in Kentucky on June 12, 1806, that a child was with them at the ceremony.\n\nSeveral books have been written of this unofficial account of Lincoln's birth. The first, \"The Genesis of Lincoln,\" by James H. Cathey was published in 1899. James C. Coggins published two books: \"Abraham Lincoln: A North Carolinian With Proof\" in 1926; and \"The Eugenics of President Abraham Lincoln\" in 1940. At least three books published in the past 20 years also explore the theory.\n\nAt the Bostic Lincoln Center, volunteers show short documentaries highlighting interviews with many locals, old and young alike, who have heard the story all their lives.\n\nOne such local resident was Tom Melton, who was instrumental in getting the center opened, said Lydia Clontz, museum director and board president. \"He was the storykeeper for over 50 years,\" she added.\n\nA retired engineer and school principal from nearby Sunshine, Melton had always heard the local stories and became more interested when he read Cathey's book. He would take curious people through the woods to Lincoln Hill to show them the old Enloe home site. Melton died at age 88 in 2008, the year the museum opened.\n\nMuseum artifacts\n\nDisplays at the museum include artifacts of the time period, including a donated quilt from the 1800s, and sets of miniature Revolutionary War and Civil War soldiers, many of them made and hand-painted by the donor. The museum also contains a reference library of some of the 15,000 or so books that have been written about Lincoln. Large storyboards give the accounts that have been handed from generation to generation.\n\nBooks that have been written about Lincoln's possible N.C. origin are for sale in the lobby of the museum, including the most recent, \"Searching for Lincoln,\" by Jerry Goodnight, published in 2008. A synopsis of this book asks the pertinent question, \"When will DNA testing be used to prove who he really was?\"\n\nAt the Bostic Lincoln Center, a petition asking that DNA testing be conducted is available for signing. Among those the center lists as possible fathers are Tom Lincoln; Abraham Enloe; Richard Martin, another area man with whom Nancy Hanks has been linked; and John C. Calhoun, a South Carolinian who held various political offices including vice president to John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson, and who was a proponent of slavery.\n\nSome residents of Abbeville, S.C., where Calhoun was born and spent much time — including visits to a tavern where, supposedly, young Nancy Hanks might have once worked — also want a DNA test to settle Lincoln's paternity.\n\nIn all, at least 17 possible fathers to Abraham Lincoln have been named throughout the years.\n\nNo birth certificate exists for Lincoln, one reason for the ideas put forth as to his origins. Add to that the facts that there is little resemblance between Abraham and Tom Lincoln, and that Abraham was supposedly reticent about his early years and about his mother's life, and it all adds up to a history mystery for some.\n\nHistorians discount tale\n\nTwo of the most famous of the many biographies about Lincoln were written by Carl Sandburg. \"Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years\" and \"The War Years\" were published in 1926 and 1939, respectively. \"The War Years\" won a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nSandburg, who was living in Flat Rock at the time he was writing an abridged version of the biography in the 1950s, knew of the Rutherford County claims to Lincoln.\n\nMelton was interviewed for a 1999 Associated Press article, printed in the Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle. In it, he tells of meeting Sandburg and asking him what he thought of the theory. \"Nothing to it. Trash,\" was Sandburg's answer, according to Melton.\n\nEdward Steers Jr. is one of the Lincoln historians and biographers who rejects the Rutherford County claim based on his own research.\n\nAccording to Steers, this questioning of Lincoln's paternity began as early as 1860. Among the reasons, he believes, for people's willingness to believe accounts other than the accepted one is the lack of written documentation on Nancy Hanks. There were, in fact, multiple women named Nancy Hanks in Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina, he said, adding to the confusion.\n\nHe also cites the existence of Lincoln's older sister, Sarah, born in 1807. Lincoln's age would have had to be misrepresented by years in order to account for his being called younger, and Steers believes this unlikely. Further, he adds, there is much written documentation linking Tom Lincoln to Kentucky and no evidence that he was ever in North Carolina.\n\n\"The N.C. tradition has no documentation (primary records) of any sort to lend credibility to it,\" Steers wrote in a 2009 essay for Abraham Lincoln Online, \"and fails when challenged by all the existing documentation that does exist. It is based exclusively on one man's (Cathey's) writings decades after Lincoln's death.\"\n\nMeanwhile, The Bostic Lincoln Center continues to grow in both acquisitions and recognition.\n\nIn August it will be added to the 80 Western N.C. sites that are part of the state's Blue Ridge National Heritage program with a sign placed at the museum. And many of the more than 3,000 visitors the museum has had since it opened evidently find the story an intriguing one worth pondering.\n\nFor more information about museum hours or the festival, call the Bostic Lincoln Center at 828-245-9800 or visit www. bosticlincolncenter.com."
