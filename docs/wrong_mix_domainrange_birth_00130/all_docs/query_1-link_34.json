        "text": "Romesh Lakhan was born and raised in Duluth MN. He graduated from the College of St. Scholastica and the University of MN School of Medicine and has been teaching high school and college science classes for over 18 years.\n\nDuring this time he caught the travel bug from his parents, Jill and Koresh Lakhan, and has had to opportunity to chaperone a group of students to our sister city of Ohara-Isumi. He has served on boards of several organizations in the community and various committees at UMD.\n\nRomesh is married with three children who generally consider him a bad influence because they too love to travel more than is fiscally prudent. In his spare time he enjoys reading, mountain biking, hiking, cooking, and ahem…traveling to new places and meeting new people.\n\nJohn Schmidt is a retired Duluth Public School teacher and social worker. His commitment to service continues after retirement, through volunteer work in the community.\n\nHe followed the work of Duluth Sister Cities during his professional life and invited visiting delegations into his classroom and attended many Sister Cities events. The members of Duluth Sister Cities were people in the community he admired and respected. He saw the work of the organization making significant contributions to the health of his community and John believed in the mission that involved promoting peace and understanding through person to person relationships.\n\nJohn and his wife, Chelly are committed to promoting peace and sustainability in their community and the world. They know that relationship building with people is the best way to promote peace and sustainability.\n\nSeveral years ago, John and Chelly, joined a delegation on a trip to Växjö where they gathered information on sustainability through carbon neutral initiatives, city planning, human service work and art. They also returned home with many new friends and a significant present day Swedish culture understanding. Recently, delegations of Växjö and Isumi City residents visited Duluth. They shopped, they ate out, they toured, they visited many sites but most importantly, they formed new friendships.\n\nJohn strongly believes in the mission of DSCI and is interested in discovering avenues that make Duluth Sister Cities experiences more accessible to all members of our community. He is proud of all the impacts Duluth Sister Cities has had on Duluth. He values the access we have to our global community through computer assisted communication, but he knows the impact of “real life” people to people encounters are far more powerful.\n\nTim moved to Duluth in 1976 from his childhood home in Minnetonka. He attended UMD and graduated with a BS degree in Biology and BS minor in Chemistry along with a teaching science license. Most of Tim’s adult life has been teaching in Duluth Public Schools including coaching the Duluth East Daredevils Robotics Team for 12 years.\n\nTim has a long history of working with Duluth Sister Cities. In the early 90’s Tim participated in a Russian/American bike exchange and has participated in numerous events with the Duluth East Robotics Team at Enger Park and the DECC. In 2017 the Duluth East Robotics Team helped start a team in our sister city Växjö, Sweden. The team competed in Duluth for three seasons before Covid hit the planet. Tim is now chairperson of the Växjö committee planning events between the two cities.\n\nIn a world where two or more people can video talk (Jetson style) in real time, makes the world so much smaller and more connected. Knowing each other and understanding one another is of paramount importance. Tim is committed to participating in a world of connectedness.\n\nSome of Tim’s favorite activities are Traveling, camping, eclipse hunting, biking and pickleball.\n\nThe majority of Kremena’s professional experience has been in the educational world and mostly in higher education. She holds an administrative position at the University of Minnesota Duluth, and in addition to that, Kremena teaches a couple of classes in order to stay connected to students and expand her perspective when working with instructors on her team.\n\nThroughout her career, she has traveled extensively around the world to support cooperative internationalization efforts. Last year, she served as the President on the Duluth Sister Cities International Board whose mission of building bridges to global understanding strongly aligns with her vision. Kremena grew up in Bulgaria, so she speaks Bulgarian, Russian, and Serbian.\n\nHer family regularly hosts international college age students and sees great benefits in these cultural and social exchanges. One of her inspirations is to create gourmet dishes with ingredients from locally sourced farms, so you can regularly find her at the Farmers' Market.\n\nIn her spare time, she enjoys reading, biking, walking on the beach, working in her art studio, and other creative activities that involve her family.\n\nMelissa Hepokoski is a long-time resident of Duluth, Minnesota. While in high school, Melissa was active in Family Career and Community Leaders of America. In the summer of 1989, Melissa was awarded a scholarship to spend eight weeks in Japan through FCCLA and Youth for Understanding. During that summer in Tokyo, Melissa lived with a gracious host family who provided her with abundant opportunities to learn about Japanese culture. This enriching experience was a pivot-point in Melissa’s life, igniting her passion for learning about people all over the globe.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Melissa attended the University of Minnesota, Duluth (UMD). While attending UMD, Melissa participated in a nine-month study abroad program in Birmingham, England. In Europe, Melissa was able to participate in additional first-hand experiences that enhanced her studies in history, culture, and language. In 1995, Melissa graduated from UMD with a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations.\n\nLater, Melissa decided to pursue a career in Education. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Superior in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education and in 2016 she completed a Master of Education degree through St. Mary’s University of Minnesota.\n\nTom Zelman is a Professor of English at the College of St. Scholastica, where he has worked since 1988. As an undergraduate, he spent a year studying in France, a very powerful experience that has led him to seek opportunities to get to know people from other countries, in the US and abroad. In his work, he has helped to lead college study programs to Russia (Petrozavodsk), Ireland, and China. He has also directed the China Summer Programs at St. Scholastica. His family has hosted visitors from Russia, Uruguay, and Spain.\n\nAt St. Scholastica, Tom teaches several courses in the novel and a variety of writing courses.

His entire career has been with the Duluth schools, and he has called the city home since he was 13.\n\nBorn in Paris and educated for a time in French boarding schools, Crawford’s family moved to Duluth when his father was transferred here by the U.S. Air Force. Ed graduated from Duluth Central in 1974 and went on to earn degrees from the College of St. Scholastica, the University of Wisconsin-Superior and St. Cloud State University.\n\nHis early life, he said, “certainly solidified who I am as a person and how I deal with people. Kids who struggle in school — those are kids I have who I admire”. Ed has worked hard to develop programs to help kids stay in school. New programs include those for language immersion and for online study through the district, in line with his vision for helping at-risk students and helping them make better decisions.\n\nEd is currently employed by the University of Minnesota, Duluth as an adjunct professor in the Department of Education. He serves on the St. Scholastica Board of Trustees and is a member of the Duluth Area Family YMCA Heritage Foundation Board of Trustees.\n\nBeth has always been interested in learning about other countries and exchanges. In 1998 her husband came home from his side-job as a soccer coach and asked if we could host a player from Norway that was looking for a home. Spending a year hosting a student was a powerful experience and demonstrated the benefits of student exchanges first-hand. That student is now grown with his own family and career and Beth has now benefited from getting advice from him on how to improve systems here.\n\nThe soccer connection from Beth’s husband also led to participation with the Duluth Växjö Soccer Exchange with trips to Växjö and hosting players here in Duluth. After participating in a trip to Sweden in 2019, Beth took over as the president with the program being halted in 2020 due to the pandemic. Beth has been working with folks in Växjö to develop an exchange with teens that can get the program restarted.\n\nBeth participated in a Duluth/Växjö city exchange in the summer of 2023 and found there were many opportunities for Duluth to learn from Växjö. Beth’s background is in healthcare, teaching, and public health. This fall she was able to set up an exchange where the health director from Kronoberg County where Växjö is located partnered with Beth to give a presentation to the St. Louis County health department about the pandemic response.\n\nShar Valentine MD has been a Duluth resident for 21 years. She’s a pediatrician at Essentia Health. Upon finishing residency training in Madison Wisconsin and moving to Duluth, her mentor’s sendoff included a six pack of beer and a book on ice fishing. While she hasn’t cracked that book, she appreciates the beauty of Lake Superior, the area’s mountain bike trails and the BWCA and loves to share it with visitors.\n\nAn avid traveler in her medical and military career, she and her partner, Pete, look forward to being delegates to our sister cities and opening up their home to visiting delegations. She looks forward to promoting the Sister Cities mission of peace by sparking local interest in our DSCI’s initiatives, especially with youth and families.\n\nChristy Rounds is a 4th generation native of Two Harbors, MN, who just returned to northern Minnesota after spending most of her adult life in Michigan, Colorado, California and western New York.\n\nAfter graduating from Gustavus Adolphus College with a degree in International Relations with an Eastern European focus, Christy worked for an international cultural exchange organization called Friendship Ambassadors.

Before landing in Duluth in 1998, Mary worked as a case manager for Hmong hearing impaired in California and science and art teacher in Salt Lake City.\n\nDave and Mary came to Duluth with their two daughters and three sons. This began the adventure with DSCI when their son Lee went on a student delegation. In 2004, the family toured several Asian countries with homestays in Japan (with the family that hosted Lee), South Korea, Hong Kong, and China.\n\nFrom 2007-2017 Mary was involved in “Rural School Initiative” which meant travel to a boarding school for 8-10 weeks each fall to work with Chinese teachers who taught English. Mary has also chaperoned Girl Scouts on trips to Ecuador, London, Mexico, France, and Switzerland and traveled to India to present workshops in the arts to young adults.\n\nDave and Mary have hosted many students from overseas.
