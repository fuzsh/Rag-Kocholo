This movie page looks at The Top Grossing Movies of 1953. Currently when you type in the search words….”Top Grossing Movies of 1953″ you do not get much information. Wikipedia provides 10 movies. The Numbers.com provides 10 movies. Stats-a-mania offers up 7 movies. You have to go to the 26th search result to find the next place that lists box office results….UMR’s (that’s us) Marilyn Monroe page which offers up her movies. So in an effort to get more information out there…we have decided to unlock our 1953 movie database vault and share the information we have collected over the years.

To make this list a movie had to be made in 1953 (as listed on IMDB.com). Obviously many movies made in 1952 earned box office dollars in 1953. On the other side many movies made in 1953 made money in 1954 and later (it Tokyo Story almost 20 years to reach North America). This page will looks at 173 Top Grossing Movies of 1953. The movies are listed in a massive table that shows who starred in the movie, had much the movie grossed when it was released and how that gross means in today’s money.

Obviously this is not all of the 1953 movies…..but since our website is dynamic, ever time we add a 1953 movie….it will automatically be added to this page.
