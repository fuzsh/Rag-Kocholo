        "text": "Gunfighters versus Homesteaders\n\nShane, 1953, masterfully directed by George Stevens (b.1904-d.1975), stands out with several powerful scenes that symbolize and shine with the spirit and soul of the Western genre. Alan Ladd (b.1913-d.1964) had been well known in film noirs (This Gun For Hire, 1942; The Blue Dahlia, 1946), often wearing a trench coat. Playing roles in which he embodies both toughness and intellect, here he seems preternaturally able to show his toughness when needed—more dynamic and his performance showing more range—also displaying a quiet sensitivity. Within the confines of Shane, a classic, mythical Western, he seems uncannily at home.\n\nChosen from two recurring elements of the Western genre, the gun fight and the bar fight, I decided to analyze the spectacular barroom brawl that takes place at Grafton’s supply store. True, the film has an explosive gunfight near the end of the film that pits Alan Ladd’s Shane with one of cinema’s all-time greats, Jack Palance (b.1919-d.2006), playing Jack Wilson, a gunfighter and hired killer from the north, his face pockmarked with the lesions of a hard life and an aptitude for killing. Though the gunfight is the final expression of two skilled gunfighters finally meeting, it is all too quick and too light to analyze in depth. The scene I prefer to discuss is the fight scene between Shane and Rufus Ryker, played by Emile Meyer (b.1910-d.1987) and his gang of henchmen attempting to kick the Starrett family off their land. It’s one I remember with a vivid imagination and interest as I recall my dad watching it, commenting on it, being in awe of the quality and coolness of the aggression. The fist fight—more prolonged than the gun fight, with a complexity that takes multiple viewings to appreciate—has more meat on it, with the viewer sympathizing with Shane, subjectively becoming him and rooting for him through every blow, every dodge, every broken chair over the head.\n\nThe barroom brawl, together with the gun, symbolizes the violence the ranchers are unaccustomed to waging. They need a hero. A man of violence. A protector. In Shane, this is reminiscent of the movie The Magnificent Seven (1960, dir. John Sturges), where Yul Brunner’s gunfighter must assemble a group of gunfighting champions to help defend a peaceful Mexican village from ruthless outlaws. Like Shane, The Magnificent Seven thematically speaks to two separate—but opposite—ideals of masculinity: the gunfighter versus the homesteader. Other films that explore the push and pull between gunfighter and homesteader can be found in The Gunfighter (1950, dir. Henry King), where Gregory Peck plays Johnny Ringo, a gunfighter wishing to change his ways, and The Unforgiven (1992, dir. Clint Eastwood), where Clint Eastwood plays Bill Munny, a retired, aging gunfighter). Shane, Johnny Ringo et al represent a common theme in Westerns: These fighters exist outside of the realm of homesteader to help defend them. At first, the ranchers refuse to even help Shane, leaving him out to dry. Joe Starrett, played by Van Heflin (b.1908-d.1971), a man of character and integrity, forms a bond of friendship, along with his wife Marian, played by Jean Arthur, (b.1900-d.1991) and son Joey, played by Brandon De Wilde (b.1942-d.1972), putting his own life on the line to help Shane.\n\nShane—iconic both in its pastoral beauty and its violence—molds legend into reality to create pseudo-myths that are largely American in nature. Practically nowhere else do we see the love of the gun, idealized as it is and protected by the Constitution. That guns (in the wrong hands) kill is obvious; but, perhaps, less so to some, is the possibility that the gun, manufactured with pride, craftsmanship and skill, can be seen as a thing of beauty in its own right.\n\nClip: A Gun is a Tool\n\nShane, the man, is a complex mixture of emotions and characteristics, some more traditionally male, some more traditionally female. At times, quietly dangerous, with the hidden potential for violence; at other times, soft, sincere, and able to relate well with children, notably Joey. Occasionally overtly masculine (moving the massive tree stump); conversely, he has an androgynous, smooth femininity to his muscular physique. He comes across as a hybrid, like a James Stewart-type that can also kill with supreme accuracy. Shane, as a whole, is summed up by various characteristics on a continuum, personifying both masculine and feminine qualities to form his complete character. For example, a typical masculine trait can be his ability to kill or commit violence; a typical feminine trait, though not exclusively, would be his ability for compassion, empathy, and solace. Being a protector-type of person isn’t the exclusive domain of men but also of women. Only the form in which the protection takes place changes.\n\nThough capable of tranquil warmth and friendliness for his fellow man, Shane is also a form of heightened virility (similar to his nemesis, Jack Wilson, though Jack Wilson is certainly more one-dimensional, without any discernible female traits whatsoever), like a human weapon, a gun made of flesh, bone and muscles, combining truth and reality with the many half-truths and exaggerations of men in their push to tame the West. Shane’s masculinity is depicted in his skills with a gun but also within his physical self: Shirt off, physically fit, sweating, tackling the massive tree stump with his strong hands outside the Starrett’s ranch, he is every inch the man represented by the physically larger Joe Starrett. From the outset of the film, when we see Shane riding in from the far horizon, we are drawn into the fairy tale we are about to witness, observing the American mythology of the Western genre. As an audience we can see it in the natural beauty of the West, but also feel it as a living entity. Brave acts become legendary, mixed along with the often mundane acts of common reality in Western cinema like the need to retrieve supplies at the local store. Doing so creates a deeper mythological construct of the West all its own. It’s wholly American: untamed and brutal; gorgeous to behold yet harsh; at times bewildering in its scope of human behavior. Looking closely, there’s depth in the Western genre. Iconic imagery blends with time, heightening nostalgia for a time and place when things, at least on the surface, seemed clearer and less muddy. Good guys. Bad guys. Farmers and ranchers. Gunslingers. Women, like matriarchal pillars to the men who settled the untamed, raw land, stood as a hard-working foundation beneath everything the men did. Yes ambiguity still existed but it lived within agreed upon ideas that all people living within those codified laws believed in.\n\n***\n\nIt’s interesting to think of the modern gun debate in the microcosm of the film as Shane and Marian Starrett talk about guns in the valley. Marian symbolizes the left-wing agenda that seeks to outlaw all the guns in the valley; Shane, however, while shunning gun violence for most of the film, still sees it as a tool, an inert thing, as good or as evil as the man who possesses it.\n\n***\n\nThe Shane fight scene should be compared to its contemporaries, not modern movies that fall into other genres, from Hong Kong action movies to The Matrix. Computerized help or CGI should be completely off-limits. In Shane, the fight scene—stylish, visceral and engaging—is still something that could actually happen in reality. It lends itself to a view of masculinity that is down to earth, passed on between generations, or between father and son. We see this in the film. But instead of Joey’s father, it’s Shane, representing a father-figure—one image of fatherhood that is more masculine, rough, and ultimately relying on violence—as a means of sharing and passing down wisdom. Alan Ladd’s Shane is a red-blooded, manly hero that is somewhat at the end of something in his life, a man capable of unleashing hellish violence into the world, but is being pushed out by another view of what it means to be a man. That view is exemplified in Joe Starrett and the other farmers, or ‘sodbusters’. So, when little Joey wants to learn how to use a gun, he doesn’t seek out his rancher-father but Shane, the handsome, mysterious gunslinger, on the peripheries of farmer society, to learn how to hold, aim and fire a gun.\n\nThe Raucous Bar Fight\n\nThe fight scene is better defined as a sequence, with a distinct beginning, middle and end. The beginning, or the pre-scene, would be the farmers entering Grafton’s store, looking for supplies. The fight scene comes next and overall, runs about nine minutes. The ending of the sequence or the post-scene is short, with Ryker mysteriously upping the tension and the stakes when he says, “I’m through foolin’…from now on when we fight with them, the air is gonna be filled with gun smoke.”\n\nFrom first punch (37:02) to last punch (43:46), the fight scene lasts 6 minutes and 44 seconds. During that time, I counted the edits. I counted twice, without sound, and came to 178 cuts the first time and 177 cuts the second time, some of them coming so fast that I could barely catch my breath. The fight—complex with the amount of cuts and the variation of the type of shots—is divided into two with a pause starting at 39:33 and that extends to the first punch of part two of the fight at 40:88. During the pause, Rufus Ryker, seeing Shane’s fighting ability, attempts to turn Shane to one of his dark minions under his payroll. This exemplifies Rufus Ryker’s fundamental miscalculation of understanding Shane a person. Loyal and brave, Shane would never turn against his own freedom or the homesteaders he feels a loyalty to protect. His character won’t allow him to betray others or himself, giving his word to Joe Starrett and ultimately bound by it.\n\nBefore the pause, Shane fights alone; after the pause, Joe Starrett, though burly and strong, is not a natural fighter. For him, the encounter stands as an unusual event, harder for him than Shane, acquitting himself well, fighting alongside Shane.\n\nThe middle portion of the sequence, the fight itself, is a classic beat down between Shane and Chris Calloway, played by Ben Johnson (b.1918-d.1996), one of Rufus Ryker’s toughest henchmen. It begins in an archetypal, humiliating fashion when Shane, holding two whiskeys, throws one on Calloway’s chest and another on his face, swiftly and savagely followed by one of Shane’s hardest punches to the face—reeling Calloway backwards, through one room, crashing through swinging doors and into another room where he crumples to the ground.\n\nClip: Let Me Buy You a Drink\n\nAt the start of the fight (37: 02), George Stevens intercuts several rapid shots: a medium shot of shot of Joey pushing the swinging doors ajar; a close-up of Calloway getting his reaction of the drink in the face; Calloway flying through the swinging doors; a reaction shot of the group of farmers; a woman fainting, slumping to the floor; and back to a close-up shot of Calloway wiping his face, smearing blood across his cheek. At this point, Calloway, seemingly outmatched, is still filled with the necessary energy to continue. Later, as we’ll see, the match ends with Calloway utterly vanquished.\n\nOstensibly a simply shot fight, George Stevens adds nuance and intricacy to the scene by varying different elements to how a scene can be shot, including composition of the shot, overall framing, angle, movement, intercutting, and other techniques. Sound, too, is also vital.\n\nGeorge Stevens uses pacing to good effect throughout the fight. The fight is extended—adding tension by intentionally slowing down the action—by essentially starting and stopping the violence in fits. Like stop and go traffic in cinematic terms, it creates more pressure to the moments where there is kinetic ferocity. For example, right at the fight’s inception, Shane’s punch is so brutal, that it stops the fight as we wait for it to resume again. Indeed, George Stevens has Calloway being held back by two of his friends at 37:18, extending and slowing down the scene yet adding tension, instead of Calloway charging back through the swinging doors and hurriedly re-engaging Shane. This ‘start-stop’ element is done a few times: at 38:55, a man enters the bar from outside; and at 39:34, Shane delivers his left hook to stop the first part of the fight, creating the halfway pause.\n\nThe battle resumes once Calloway’s friends release him at 37:27.\n\nA subjective POV shot, one of many peppered through the scene, is shown at 37:58 where Calloway pulls his head back to avoid a Shane punch. There are also several mistakes where we can clearly see the stuntmen instead of the main actors; I won’t get into all of them but they are plentiful and fun to find them all. Still, the mistakes never lessened my enjoyment of the dramatic onscreen action.\n\nDirty shots—when something in the environment remains in the way of the primary action—is another element that George Stevens uses to increase the complexity and dynamism of the scene.\n\nExamples of dirty shots include the following:\n\nAt 37:34, a low-angle shot of Calloway versus Shane with a chair in the foreground\n\nAt 38:05, a medium shot of the staircase and steps in the entire frame of the shot\n\nBetween 38:07 and 38:55, we see a combination of shots: a moving shot, a POV shot, a dirty shot of a bar patron walking across the fight, briefly obscuring the action; close-ups are effectively mixed with medium shots; intercuts are used; sound remains vital as we hear the shuffling of feet, heavy breathing, the sound of broken glass, and the voices of men encouraging Calloway to pummel Shane\n\nPart two dirty shots include: at 42:55, Joe Starrett, completely covered by a wooden beam, punching a guy; 43:10, a low angle shot through the swinging doors a turned over table and other debris on the floor and the ensuing fight in the mid-ground; at 43:36, a wide shot behind the bar (which breaks the 180-degree rule)\n\nI won’t go further with the dirty shots. Again, now that you know what they are you can find them easily, as they are abundant, adding tension, grit and realism to the scene.\n\nSound is another element that adds authenticity to the scene. Sound used in the bar fight is mostly diagetic (sound taking place strictly within the world of the film itself).\n\n***\n\nAt 39:33, when Shane gives Chris Calloway a stunning left-hook punch in the chin that sends him down, Joey crunches hard on a candy cane, showing how much the boy admires Shane. At this point, Joey is living vicariously through him and might one day fully emulate and grow into a gunslinger himself.\n\nDuring the pause, when Shane refuses Rufus Ryker’s plea to join the gang, Joey and Shane talk. We see yet again the bond between them and the icon of masculinity that Shane represents to the little boy. Joey wants Shane to back out of the fight but Shane asks the boy, “You wouldn’t want me to run away, would ya?” The boy answers, “There’s too many, Shane.” The bond is fatherly and Shane even tells Little Joey to leave, calling him “son.” George Stevens uses the pause to add deeper meaning to an essentially violence-laden episode. The fighting alone would have been impressive given the complexity of shots, but Stevens uses the break in the action to create emotional meaning behind the fight, helping the audience to direct a ton of empathy towards Shane and the boy. From the start of the film, when Ryker’s men confront Joe Starrett, with Shane silently watching, the idea of what it means to display masculine qualities and the idea of manliness versus cowardice is present throughout.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that when Joey leaves the room, Chris Calloway (41:20), in a wide shot, gingerly rises from the floor, bloodied and bereft of the vigor to continue, looking at Shane, wholly uninterested in fighting. He’s defeated. Aggressive and masculine at the beginning of the fight; now he is weak and frail. Beaten.\n\n***\n\nPart two of the fight begins at 41:36 with Shane punching Morgan Ryker, played by John Dierkes (b.1905-d.1975), who also appeared in several Western-themed television shows, Rawhide and Gunsmoke.\n\nPart two has a huge amount of cuts, most of them quick, making the pace speed up noticeably. Ryker’s gang begins to overwhelm Shane, a man of courage and character and obvious fighting talent. George Stevens sticks to the engaging formula, using intercuts, dirty shots, brief camera movements, POV shots and a mixture of close-ups, medium shots and wider shots.\n\nAt 42:30, Joe Starrett, holding a wooden club, charges through the swinging doors to help Shane in battle. Messy yet rousing, the scene is scintillatingly fun and appealing in its raucous abandon. Watching, we see how Shane and Joe Starrett—men with dissimilar characteristics, backgrounds and goals—completely complement each other. Violent yes, the moment is enjoyable and exciting, a release of endorphins for the audience that previously saw nothing but a beating coming to the outnumbered Joe and Shane. Music (43:21), prominently missing from much of the fight, rises to an inspiring crescendo (finally, non-diagetic sound) as Shane and Joe Starrett have plainly won the day.\n\nClip: You’ve Won\n\nNo Guns in the Valley\n\nThough the fight scene might be considered out of date against modern filmmaking techniques, the fight is a masterpiece. The number of edits, the complexity of the shots (the placement of the camera, going from a high shot to a low shot, to the camera being placed behind objects of parts of the bar, making it seem subjective for the viewer, as if we are cowering behind something to gaze in awe at the show), the choreography of the fight, and the lack of music make it thrilling and one of a kind. Raw. Vicious. Spellbinding.\n\nThe fact that it’s so engaging, without music and computer enhancement, makes it an epic fight that stays with you long after it’s over.\n\nThe bar fight and the gun fight represent one form of masculinity. Violence becomes a means to an end, glorified by some and feared by all. Conversely, the other form of masculinity growing from the very soil on which the farmers will build—that of the homesteader—makes the gunfighter more and more obsolete in the modern world. Shane understands that the gunfighter’s time is coming to a close; Ryker’s men do not. As with any subculture that fears its own demise, it lashes out, trying to provoke a response to justify itself. They understand the rules in which the games are played and that gives them a certain advantage when violence and murder is the currency. If the currency with the most value was how to plow a field, grow corn, slaughter chickens, and raise a happy and healthy family, then the advantage would go to the sodbusters represented by Joe Starrett and his ranchers.\n\nBut even for those that wield guns, the thoughtful can see change on the dusty horizon.\n\nShane, a person who has moved to a center position, sees the virtue and warmth of being a homesteader and raising a family. Equally, he hasn’t completely lost sight of the usefulness of guns. Violence, to murder in cold blood, is a choice men make. One wonders about his chaotic past but since it has brought him to a point of wanting to give up the gunfighter life, he should know its drawbacks. He sees the future and wants to change along with it. Crossing the river at the beginning of the film could be seen as a type of cleansing or baptism into a new self. The fact that Shane wants to settle down—adopting more of Joe Starrett’s traits and less of Jack Wilson’s, perhaps representing Shane’s inner selves and the struggle between them—encapsulates the predicament of the modern gunfighter.\n\nShane admires Joe Starrett’s way of life, even to the point of growing a bond to his son and a platonic affectation for Marian.\n\nFor the Starrett family, the fable ends, with according to Shane, “no more guns in the valley,” bringing about Marian’s wish for the future. For Shane, that future is more ambiguous, as he leaves the homesteader lifestyle behind. Knowing the character through the film, it’s hard to believe that Shane would fully abdicate gun violence, if needed, or, surrender the wish of his inner self to change and become a landowner somewhere down the line.\n\nIn my mind, I believe Shane is eventually successful, but only after repeated attempts, like ditching a debauched drug habit that corrupts the soul. Within its thrall, you don’t feel the pain, but outside of its seductive embrace, you see and feel the damage done and lives lost.\n\n***\n\nA meaningful thanks to my dad, Kamil Kafieh (b.1936-d.2016), who taught me to have a profound appreciation of the greatest films in the history of cinema. At times, we didn’t see eye-to-eye about practically anything, arguing about many things, most of them trivial in nature. Still, in hindsight, turbulence can be a wise teacher and rough waters can send a ship into new and unexpected territory. I saw things both strange and wondrous. I searched. I seeked. With my intellectual curiosity ramped up, I’ve always tried to learn new things, but also with a dose of healthy skepticism. Any humble enlightenment that I have achieved so far has been born from your time-honored traditions, as well as my own sense of rebellious questioning of the world around me.\n\nFarewell…\n\n***\n\nInformation on the Blu-Ray: Shane, 1953, Alan Ladd, Jean Arthur, Van Heflin.
