        "text": "Patti Yasutake, an actress best known for her role in “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” died after a long battle with cancer on Monday, Aug. 5 Deadline reported. She was 70.\n\n“Patti was not only a client but a ‘chosen family member,’” Yasutake’s longtime manager Kyle Fritz said in a statement sent to MassLive. “She was the very first actress I ever signed and a friendship of over 30 years ensued. It was an honor to know her, work with her and love her.”\n\nBorn on Sept. 6, 1953 in Los Angeles, California, Yasutake played Nurse Alyssa Ogawa on the popular sci-fi “Star Trek: The Next Generation.”\n\nShe later reprised the role in the show’s film series as well as the 1994 film “Star Trek Generations.” One of Yasutake’s last TV roles was on Netflix’s acclaimed limited series “Beef,” playing George’s mother Fumi Nakai.\n\nYasutake made her major feature debut in the 1986 comedy “Gung Go” as Umeki, a relocated Japanese wife earnestly trying to Americanize. She reprised her character in the follow-up ABC comedy series spawned by the movie.\n\nYasutake also appeared in the 1992 comedy “Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot” and the 1999 drama “Drop Dead Gorgeous.”"
