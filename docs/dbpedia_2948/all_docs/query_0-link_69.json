It all began when Boo and I found a great deal on the 50th Anniversary DVD set with all of the Bond movies. We both only had casual knowledge of the series, so we thought it would be fun to work our way through them chronologically. And I thought it would be fun to review each of them as we watch, with some running commentary on a few of the different categories for each movie. Bond Girls, villains, henchmen, gadgets, theme songs, and more. I also rank the best and worst of the series and read all the original Ian Fleming books for your review. What can I say?
