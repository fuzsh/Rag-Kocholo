        "text": "by Mark Murton\n\nAlso Known As: Three Stops to Murder\n\nDirected by: Terence Fisher\n\nCat Out of the Bag Alert! This review contains a spoiler for this film!\n\nSynopsis: Discharged by his employer, a private eye, Tom Conway (Tom Conway) stays on the case of a jewel theft at a London fashion house after a model with information for him is murdered.\n\nCat Burglar (Scene Stealer): Lady Marchant (Margaret Halstan), one of the people Conway wants to speak to, is seen in her apartment talking to her orange and white cat (and parrot!) when the doorbell rings.\n\nShe answers the door to find herself facing a man with a gun. He ushers her inside as the cat watches apprehensively.\n\nThe camera remains on the cat as a shot rings out causing the cat to leap away. Conway arrives soon after to find Lady Marchant dead.\n\nFinal Mewsings: Cats have more dramatic screen reactions to murder than parrots.\n\nRelevant Links:"
