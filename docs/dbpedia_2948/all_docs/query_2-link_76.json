        "text": "This film noir is distinguished by being not only post-World War II, but post-atomic. And that‚Äôs not its only distinction.\n\nAmong other things, this movie marked the directorial debut of Dick Powell. RKO Pictures had turned Powell‚Äôs acting career in a new direction when he was cast as Philip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet, and when Powell‚Äôs interests drew him toward directing, he felt at home handling a film noir project with RKO.\n\nUnlike other postnuclear films noir, this movie is a thriller, not a detective story like Kiss Me Deadly or a Red Scare flick like Pickup on South Street. The story is about two escaped convicts, Sam Hurley (played by Stephen McNally) and his gut-shot pal Bart Moore (played by Paul Kelly), who make tracks in a car they eventually must ditch. I should mention here that they‚Äôre being chauffeured by a mute named ‚ÄúDummy‚Äù (played by Frank de Kova) (and I swear I‚Äôm not making that up). In a nutshell, this merry threesome end up holding several people hostage while awaiting a doctor‚Äôs arrival (to treat the gunshot gunsel) at a ghost town which will be blown away by an above-ground atom bomb test scheduled for the following morning.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that happens when you break out of a Carson City, Nevada prison during the Cold War. You can run, but maybe not far or fast enough.\n\nThe hostages are an eclectic bunch. The first to get waylaid are Kay Garven (Alexis Smith) and her lover Arthur Ashton (Robert Paige). The convicts force them at gunpoint to drive away from the gas station where they stopped to refuel. And they don‚Äôt even let them get gas, like the dumbest criminals ever.\n\nSo when they run out of gas (which you know will happen, so that‚Äôs not exactly a big plot twist), a newspaperman Larry Fleming (Keith Andes) who was supposed to cover the A-bomb test, but got reassigned, and the tough blonde he picked up, Dottie Vale (Jan Sterling) pull over to help. But no good deed goes unpunished, right?\n\nSo that‚Äôs our merry crew of potential victims. Except, I forgot to mention that the group is joined by an old prospector and resident ghost (so to speak) Asa Tremaine (played by Arthur Hunnicutt), who talks about World War I like it was yesterday, even though he doesn‚Äôt look a day over his early 40s (which, by the way, he wasn‚Äôt).\n\nThat, folks, comprises a full complement of convicts and hostages. Whew!\n\nOh, wait! The doctor. You see, Sam the Stupid and Bart the Gun-shot Bonehead Pal find a letter in Kay‚Äôs car. They deduce from it that she‚Äôs a doctor‚Äôs wife, and the two of them live in Pasadena, California. So Sam calls the Doc and threatens to harm his wife if he doesn‚Äôt hustle his ass onto the next plane to Reno or Vegas or somewhere in Nevada so he can fix his gun-shot pally up. But, when Kay finds out what he did, she just laughs out loud, because she‚Äôs in Nevada to ‚Ä¶ wait for it ‚Ä¶ get a divorce. Duh!\n\nOkay, with apologies to everyone involved with this film, I‚Äôm making it sound much worse than it was. What makes this thriller/noir work so well is the way it studies the psychology of each character (even the bad ones) and reveals their individual cores of integrity (or lack thereof). These revelations explore the gray areas between good and bad, and how even a good person can have a bad moral center and vice versa.\n\nThe tension builds throughout the plot as we wait for the doctor (will he come or not?), wait to see who will challenge Sam (who has nasty violent tendencies that can kill a person) and what he‚Äôll do in response, wait for morning when ‚Ä¶ uh uh. Not saying. Because it‚Äôs in the morning that the big twist arrives.\n\nIt all leads up to a nail-biter of an ending. And is it really a spoiler to call it explosive? üôÇ\n\nFilm noir fans will get a thrill out of this one!"
