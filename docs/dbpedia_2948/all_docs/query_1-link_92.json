        "text": "“Top Gun 3” is reportedly taking flight.\n\nA third film in the Tom Cruise-led franchise is in development, according to Puck News.\n\nThe new installment would see the “Mission Impossible” star, 61, return to his role of naval aviator Lieutenant Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, as well as his “Top Gun: Maverick” co-stars Miles Teller and Glen Powell.\n\nThe first “Top Gun” movie premiered in 1986, with the second becoming a major box office success and raking in more than $1.5 billion in 2022.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” co-writer Ehren Kruger and director Joe Kosinski are allegedly returning for the third script.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Paramount for comment.\n\nCruise recently signed a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, stating that he will star and produce movies for the studio.\n\nHowever, the contract is nonexclusive, and therefore the megawatt star is able to appear in other projects.\n\nThe “Jerry Maguire” actor is currently in production for “Mission: Impossible 8” — set for release in 2025 — so “Top Gun 3” might take some time to get made.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” was released more than three decades after the parent film, and saw the return of Cruise’s character as he meets the next generation of navy pilots.\n\nPowell, 35, played LT Jake “Hangman” Seresin, while Teller, 35, portrayed Lieutenant Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw.\n\nLast year, the “Scream Queens” alum revealed how he bonded with Cruise on set in an interview with Men’s Health.\n\n“We would watch movies and talk about certain actors that he was kind of like, what the body posture was,” Powell recalled at the time.\n\n“He was like, ‘You as a person are very apologetic. You don’t want to hurt people, you want to treat people well, you apologize even when you don’t need to. You can’t have any of that in your eyes.’”\n\nThe OG “Top Gun” film also starred Val Kilmer, who even made a small appearance in “Maverick” amid his throat cancer diagnosis.\n\nKilmer, 64, who reprised his role as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky for a short scene, has been battling the disease since 2015.\n\nCruise gushed how happy he was to reunite with Kilmer during an interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n\n“I’ve known Val for decades, and for him to come back and play that character — he’s such a powerful actor that he instantly became that character again. You’re looking at Iceman,” the “Vanilla Sky” star said in February 2023.\n\n“I was crying. I got emotional,” Cruise went on. “He’s such a brilliant actor, and I love his work.”"
