        "text": "This is the standard western formula I associate with Shane (which isn't my favorite iteration of it, just how it was taught to me). A mysterious gunslinger drifts into town, and the peaceful townsfolk hire him to drive out all Undesirables, from the local bandits and their threatening violence to the local dance hall girls and their threatening sexuality. This is the foundational irony buried deep in the heart of American ideology, the rumblings of which we can feel today in the police violence across the country: the only way we've ever known to \"keep the peace\" is through violence, through our reliance on the Man with the Gun.\n\nSheridan City hires Clint Tollinger to \"drive the riffraff out of…\n\nThere were always actors that carried themselves with a certain degree of menace, like they weren't just tough onscreen, but tough offscreen too. Some would call them hell-raisers, guys who liked a drink, weren't afraid to throw a punch or two, and took that tough guy demeanour home with them. Everyone knows about Flynn with the women, O'Toole and Oliver Reed with booze, and Robert Mitchum had that same antihero appeal that Steve McQueen would master in the 1960's. Stories about Mitchum's reputation as a tough guy, getting into bar brawls, made him an excellent chat-show guest in later years, but he was so laidback about it, you'd have thought it happened every week.\n\nMan with The Gun is a…\n\nClint Tollinger, a notorious town-tamer, arrives at a town that's suffering under the constant harassment of a wealthy landowner and his thugs. The locals sense an opportunity and hire him to solve their problems, but they soon discover that his methods are both unscrupulous and controversial.\n\nRun-of-the-mill western whose only distinguishing feature, and reason to see, is the dominating presence of Robert Mitchum and the sight of his hard-boiled character doing his job and taming the town that hired him, using both his gun and the law as he sees fit. Besides that, there is little to differentiate this flick from dozens of other oaters of the same era with second string stars like Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea.\n\nThe…\n\nThere isn't really a scorching analysis of gender roles beneath the surface of Man with the Gun, but there could have been considering Jan Sterling plays a matron to a group of saloon girls while Karen Sharpe's role has her engaged to upstanding wannabe rancher played by John Lupton who's fighting for his stake on land coveted by the area's biggest landowner who has his army of men scaring everyone into submission until towntamer Robert Mitchum arrives, who's apparently separated from Jan Sterling, like a man and a woman in a Hollywood western with obscurred themes that are kind of unwholesome unitl it redeems itself. Not a bad flick, either. Mitchum carries his revolver in his holster but stuffs another…"
