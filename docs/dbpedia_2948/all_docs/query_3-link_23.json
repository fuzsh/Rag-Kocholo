        "text": "The leadership of the National Rifle Association was back in a Manhattan courtroom last month for the second phase of a high-stakes trial. In the first phase, in January, Wayne LaPierre, the longtime face of the gun rights movement who had stepped down just before the proceeding began, was found liable for spending $5.4 million of the group’s money.\n\nIn the second phase, the stakes are higher. I asked Danny Hakim, who has covered the trial, to explain where things stand.\n\nYou called the case so far a split decision. Why?\n\nEach side can claim some wins.\n\nLetitia James, the New York attorney general, had originally sought to dissolve the N.R.A., an idea that was rejected by Justice Joel Cohen of State Supreme Court in Manhattan long before the trial even started. She had also sought to impose an outside monitor to oversee the group’s finances and governance for three years. Justice Cohen also rejected that idea last week.\n\nBut James accomplished a great deal. Even some of the N.R.A.’s former insiders thought she was surfacing legitimate corruption problems that needed to be addressed, and she succeeded in winning the ouster of Wayne LaPierre, who had led the N.R.A. for more than three decades. He resigned on the eve of the trial and was then found liable by the trial jury for misspending $5.4 million. The former chief financial officer, Wilson Phillips, was found liable for $2 million.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
