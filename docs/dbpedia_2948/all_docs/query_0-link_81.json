        "text": "A year ago, I decided I was going to try to watch every movie about the Alamo ever made. Not quite there yet, but almost!\n\nAs someone currently producing a podcast on Davy Crockett, I take a particular interest in the Texas Revolution narrative and the battles that took place at the Alamo.\n\nWatching a variety of movies that explored the Battle of the Alamo from different angles, I’ve had some time to think about what makes this particular series of dramatic events so special and memorable.\n\nIt comes down to this. There are very few American wars of epic proportion that seem to do well in the war epic genre.\n\nThe Revolutionary War is too tied up with the founding fathers and political ideology. The war of 1812 lacks a central conflict. The Mexican-American war just makes Americans look like the villains (We try to avoid that one). And from the Civil War onwards, the events that transpired are all two personal to be transformed into a war epic, as a genre of mythology.\n\nLike Homer’s the Iliad, the Texas Revolution has the three key features a writer needs to construct a dramatic narrative : An aesthetically interesting setting, a dramatic conflict, and a unique resolution.\n\nAll great epics have all three.\n\nThe Iliad :\n\n-Aesthetically interesting setting : Troy, an advanced civilization far away from home and protected by gods, goddesses, and allies from all over the mediterranean sea.\n\n-Dramatic Conflict : War was started by an abduction of the most beautiful woman in the world. The war will be lost if the best warrior, Achilles, does settle his dispute with the most influential king on the side of the Greeks.\n\n-Unique Resolution : We know that the Greeks will win through tricking the Trojans with the famous Trojan horse, but the narrative is resolved when the greatest warrior tragically loses his best friend and decides to rejoin the Greeks to avenge him.\n\nThe Alamo :\n\n-Aesthetically interesting setting : An abandoned church/makeshift fort that looks ancient in American standards and a ragtag band of soldiers representing different walks of life in American society.\n\n-Dramatic Conflict : Mexico, previously a republican government, is suddenly transformed into a dictatorship by a corrupt general and self proclaimed “Napoleon of the West.”\n\n-Unique Resolution : The Texas Revolution will be won at a later time, but it will take the sacrifice of less than two hundred heroes to buy the main army more time and inspire the region to declare its independence.\n\nRead : “Ok Google, who is Achilles? I listened to the Iliad with AI – it was way better than reading the book”\n\nThe Iliad, The Alamo, and other epics become immortal stories because they have these three important things going for them.\n\nHowever, what I have come to realize after watching eight Alamo movies is that how settings, conflicts, and resolutions are exemplified makes or breaks the audience’s experience.\n\nHere is my list of the eight that I saw. From an Alamo enthusiast’s perspective I enjoyed all of them. But I am approaching this review as a regular audience member which is why I was able to narrow my recommendations down to three. I am basing the “quality” of these movies based on how well they treated the three elements I outlined : setting, conflict, and resolution.\n\n(Please also note that I made absolutely no considerations for historical accuracy.)\n\nUltimately this list will be useful if you are interested in the Alamo and want to kill two birds with one stone by watching a fun movie. Enjoy!\n\n8 movies about the Alamo (and the 3 I recommend watching)\n\n1.) Martyrs of the Alamo (1915)\n\nOldest surviving Alamo movie\n\nImpressive battle sequences that were groundbreaking during the silent film era\n\nProduced by DW Griffith, the director of Birth of a Nation\n\nSetting\n\nDW Griffith released two epic films in 1915. Birth of a Nation, which he directed, was both one of the most lucrative movies of all time and possibly the most controversial for its racial stereotypes. Martyrs of the Alamo, which he produced, is also unfortunately infused with racial ideology. The distinction between the good guys and the bad guys are established along racial lines. Later Alamo movies would included Tejanos among the defenders of the Alamo. But Martyrs of the Alamo depicts the Alamo as a struggle between “hardy American pioneers” and “petty Mexican officers.”\n\nConflict\n\nThe movie establishes the central conflict with the following title card :\n\nThe immediate cause of the Texas Revolution. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, elected president of Mexico in 1833, was shortly declared dictator by his army, ignoring the constitution of Mexico of 1824, which provided for a republican form of government.\n\nIt is pretty clear what is at stake. We know there is going to be a war against a tyrannical government. So to drive home this point, Martyrs of the Alamo opens with a village full of Mexican soldiers. As “Liberty-loving Americans who had built up the Texas colony” try to go about their everyday lives, Santa Anna’s soldiers, who occupy the land, show off their authority by harassing civilians.\n\nParticular emphasis is put on Mexican soldiers making sexual advances toward the settler women. The men want to defend their wives’ dignity, but are afraid of the violent retribution from the unscrupulous government. The Texans have no choice, but to go underground and organize a secret militia.\n\nThere are many ways a director can depict why you wouldn’t want to live in a tyrannical government. Martyrs of the Alamo chooses this theme that can also be found in Braveheart (1995), the war epic about Scotland’s fight for independence. If you watch that Academy Award winning blockbuster, you will find that the settings are almost identical. A standing army disrupts the lives of liberty-loving civilians. The victims are willing to tolerate the tyranny for awhile, but the breaking point is when the women are treated as sexual objects. William Wallace played by Mel Gibson doesn’t fight back until his wife is harassed by an English soldier.\n\nResolution\n\nSanta Anna tries to seize the Americans’ weapons, but they are able to deceive him by hiding their guns under floor boards. Martyrs of the Alamo makes it look like San Antonio, the town of liberty loving Americans, is some sort of home base. Thinking he has the town under control, he leaves and puts his number two in charge. This is a big mistake. The Texans who were plotting an attack the whole time invade the town with outside support. Soon after, the Americans have complete control of the Alamo and the town around it, Santa Anna finds out and sends all of his forces to overtake the Americans.\n\nThe Alamo is surrounded by an overwhelming force. Heroes like Davy Crockett, William Barret Travis, and James Bowie hold off the Mexican forces just long enough for Sam Houston to sign the declaration of Texas Independence.\n\nThe Alamo is invaded and all of its defenders are killed, but not before a made up character named “Silent” Smith escapes through a secret passageway. He hires himself to the Mexican army as a game hunter and pretends to be deaf. Through his guise, he is able to gather intelligence about Santa Anna’s plans. He informs Sam Houston and the movie concludes with the Texans’ victory at San Jacinto, the capture of Santa Anna, and his signing of the document which officially acknowledges Texas as free and independent.\n\nThe movie ends with “Silent” Smith and his love interest mourning the loss of the sole surviving widow of the Alamo.\n\nSetting\n\nHeroes of the Alamo establishes three distinct settings : The homestead of Al Dickinson, the political endeavors of Stephen F. Austin, and the Tyrannical life style of Santa Anna.\n\nCutting between the various stories, we are introduced to the different world views that will play a role in the conflict.\n\nAl Dickinson, an experienced soldier, just wants to settle down with his wife to raise a family.\n\nStephen F. Austin works hard as governor of the region of Texas to promote the general welfare of the Texans. He tries to alleviate the tensions that the immigrants have with their adopted government.\n\nOn the other hand, Santa Anna far away in Mexico City represses any opposition against his will, executing political opponents and refusing to sympathize with the needs of the Texan settlers.\n\nConflict\n\nRight from the outset of Heroes of the Alamo, settlers who risked everything to immigrate to Mexico are being turned away and told that the border is now closed to future Americans.\n\nThis situation infuriates the settlers and many of them push for independence, but Stephen F. Austin pleas for moderation. He asks his fellow Texans to consider Statehood. And he would be overruled if it isn’t for Al Dickinson who wants to try every option available before turning to violence.\n\nHowever, when Stephen F. Austin meets with Santa Anna to discuss statehood his suggestion just makes the dictator suspicious of his intentions. Santa Anna has Stephen F. Austin arrested and he continues his xenophobic policies.\n\nResolution\n\nThroughout Heroes of the Alamo, it is striking how little action scenes there are, but this just makes the siege of the Alamo all the more exciting. During the battle, Al Dickinson has a chance to say a final farewell to his wife. Susanna, his wife, had refused to leave him behind at the Alamo even at the risk of her own death. The battle scene culminates with the dramatic demise of Al Dickinson. Surprisingly, the movie depicts Davy Crockett trying to escape, an alternative image that would cause controversy many years later.\n\nAt the end of the battle, Santa Anna chooses to spare the life of Susanna Dickinson so that she can warn her fellow Texans that there is no hope. In the final scene of Heroes of the Alamo, in one single long take and in a dramatic monologue, Susanna, contrary to the wishes of Santa Anna, urges the Texans to fight on so that her husband’s sacrifice will have not been done in vain.\n\nSetting\n\nJames Bowie, a loyal Mexican citizen, rides into town one day and finds that it is eerily quiet. Upon entering a tavern, he learns that a lawyer, William Barret Travis, was arrested by the local governor. The Texans are divided on how to deal with Mexico’s heavy handed government. Bowie, who is related to Santa Anna by marriage, urges the dictator to return to the 1824 constitution guaranteeing civil rights to all Mexican citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeb, a young optimistic independence advocate, falls in love with the niece of an important Mexican leader who sympathizes with the Texans. She resists Jeb’s advances and becomes infatuated with James Bowie. This side story makes room for a potential romance, when we find that Bowie’s wife and children have fallen ill and died. Despite the love triangle, James Bowie is Jeb’s role model and mentor throughout the movie.\n\nConflict\n\nJames Bowie is able to persuade Santa Anna to release Stephen F. Austin from prison, but he is unable to stop him from trying to repress dissension through violent means.\n\nWhen Santa Anna tries to confiscate the Texans’ weapons and learns that the Texas Legislature will be closed, he decides he has no choice, but to join the side of the rebels.\n\nAs the Alamo defenders prepare for battle, James Bowie must temper William Barret Travis’s rash leadership style. He also becomes ill and must delegate tasks to the less competent leaders.\n\nResolution\n\nEven during the siege of the Alamo, James Bowie tries to persuade Santa Anna to end his tyrannical rule and make peace with the Texans. Santa Anna, while respecting James Bowie, calls for the final assault of the Alamo anyway.\n\nBefore the last day of the siege, James Bowie, asks Jeb to deliver a letter to General Houston. Jeb wants to stay behind with the other defenders, but the older mentor persuades him to sneak outside the walls.\n\nDuring the Siege of the Alamo, the defenders fight to the very last man. James Bowie, who was restricted to his bedroom, is perhaps the last man to die fighting.\n\nAfter the siege, Santa Anna rides through the camp in triumph. But yet, his countenance is somewhat melancholy making us think that he is mourning the loss of his friend, James Bowie.\n\nSam Houston receives the letter from Jeb and informs his men of the loss at the Alamo. Just as he finishes his speech, a carriage carrying the female survivors of the Alamo arrives at the camp. Jeb finds his love interest, the niece of the Mexican citizen turned separatist, and then they embrace each other.\n\nLike Davy Crockett : King of the Wild Frontier, the bravery and values of one man is emphasized over the historical consequences of his actions. Jeb and his love interest have both been inspired by a great man.\n\nSetting\n\nMexican soldiers, led by a quirky general, cross over the Mexico-American border under the guise that they are going to be participating in a parade for George Washington’s birthday.\n\nTaking place in the 1960s, the Mexican army returns to Texas one hundred and thirty years after the Texas Revolution and discovers a thriving yet ignorant community.\n\nThe small band of Mexican soldiers are horrified to find out the the General is in fact planning on re-capturing the Alamo.\n\nConflict\n\nHaving prepared for a parade, the mexican soldiers did not bring bullets for their guns. After the re-capturing of the Alamo, the prideful Texans try to keep the farce under wraps. They call up the national guard to entice the Mexican soldiers to evacuate the Alamo. They are also told to engage without ammunition.\n\nWe find out the real reason the general re-captured the Alamo. His pride was hurt after his girlfriend scoffs at his leadership abilities. “A friend of mine, a woman, she told me the men do not respect me. She said they would not follow me even into a whorehouse!”\n\nWithin the walls of the Alamo, the national guard and the Mexican troops face off, both without bullets in their guns. The national guard, fearing for their lives, surrender after the General’s lieutenant fires a gun into the air. The general is overwhelmed with joy after his “military victory.” But later on, when he finds that the only reason his men did not abandon him was out of fear of the lieutenant, he decides it is impossible to earn the respect of his soldiers. He decides to raise the white flag over the wall of the Alamo.\n\nResolution\n\nThe Mexican soldiers cautiously emerge from the alamo, but this time they are met by the state militia. Another standoff ensues. This time blood is shed when the commander of the militia fires his gun and hits the general on the shoulder. The wounded general feeling a sense of indignation that he would be fired upon while raising the white flag, scolds the leader of the militia. The Mexican soldiers also advance from behind and the militiamen retreat. This time General Max’s soldier stand behind him bravely without threat of violence.\n\nThe conflict between an army general, the national guard, the state militia, and San Antonio’s police department allows the General and his soldiers to march back toward the Mexican border without any repercussions. Ultimately the general acquires the respect from his soldiers that he was seeking.\n\nRead : Viva Max : The comedy that should have won an Oscar”\n\nAs promised here are the three Alamo movies that I would recommend watching and the ones that fell short of a good viewing experience :\n\nRecommended Alamo Movies\n\n2.) Heroes of the Alamo (1937)\n\nThe pacing of the movie might be a little slow and sometimes the acting is a bit corny, but the most important standard in this review is if the director told an interesting story. The Heroes of the Alamo breaks from tradition by using characters that are almost always in the background of the story as the main focus. The big stumbling block of most historical dramas as they get tied up trying to do certain iconic figures justice. Instead Heroes of the Alamo uses the survivor, Susanna Dickinson, as the character that provides not only the narrative spine of the movie, but the emotional stimulus as well. Susanna Dickinson in all other Alamo movies is used merely as a symbol of Texan defiance. Heroes of the Alamo doesn’t shed that theme, but also humanizes Susanna.\n\nIn addition, something that almost every Alamo movie seems to lack — the audience gets a sense of what is at stake if the Texans fail. Other directors just assume we should know and that makes for bad story development.\n\n(Martyrs of the Alamo might establish what is at stake, but the movie does so in a very short sighted way.)\n\nIn Heroes of the Alamo, the motivations of the characters are clear. And unlike other Alamo movies, when those motivations change we get the sense that they are changing into new people.\n\nIn a way the movie is a “coming of age” story for both Susanna Dickinson and for Texas. The ending demonstrates this growth with an eloquent long take that is more mature than the other alamo movies.\n\n6.) Viva Max (1969)\n\nSpeaking of maturity, Viva Max is the complete opposite. And that is okay.\n\nThis movie is full of interesting characters that offer social commentary on traditional interpretations of history.\n\nGiven that the movie is a sort of alternative history flick, it has the advantage of concealing its resolution. As an audience we have absolutely no idea how this one is going to end.\n\nViva Max unravels its plot in a humorous and thought provoking way which is why I highly recommend it.\n\n8.) The Alamo (2004)\n\nThis movie is well thought out in that they tell us the ending right from the beginning. We know that the Alamo will fall, so there is no need to feel suspense as to whether the defenders will succeed or not. This buys more time for character development.\n\nWhile the movie utilizes a pretty typical interpretation of the events that took place at the Alamo, the interesting characters make it worth watching. We care about the lives of Davy Crockett, William Barret Travis, and James Bowie so that our heart throbs for them the whole time.\n\nFinally the movie doesn’t seem to glorify violence in the way that the other Alamo movies do. That means less cheesy action sequences and more time to reflect on the existential theme of being trapped in a place for a time and knowing you will never escape.\n\nAlamo Movie Fails\n\n1.) Martyrs of the Alamo (1915)\n\nWhile Martyrs of the Alamo might be significant to film history, the spectacle of the action scenes does little for modern audiences. Its one-dimensional characters just made me annoyed. It is also hard to get around the director’s tendency to depict the Mexican soldiers as sex crazed criminals. This theme doesn’t just come up once and it makes me think that its constance occurrence must be based on some weird complex.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a student of film history, knock yourself out.\n\n3.) Davy Crockett : King of the Wild Frontier (1955)\n\nDavy Crockett : King of the Wild Frontier was made for kids. We can’t expect a very nuanced story given the target. Nevertheless, this movie assumes too much even for a very young audience. There are good and bad guys, but we don’t really know why they are fighting. The goal is “liberty and independence” forever. I suppose that is referring to the present state of America at the time. For this movie to endure for future generations, it would have made sense for the director to express more clearly why Davy Crockett was the first one to cross over the line.\n\n4.) The Last Command (1955)\n\nIn the The Last Command, James Bowie is depicted as the squarest hero who ever lived. Like Dickinson in Heroes of the Alamo he does everything he possibly can do to avoid bloodshed. Both protagonists are frankly one dimensional, but while Dickinson in Heroes of the Alamo has a bunch of other archetypes to balance out the story, The Last Command exhausts us with Dad lectures on how to be a good person.\n\nJames Bowie always does the right thing and he is never tempted to do otherwise. He is depicted as the savior of the Alamo which overshadows every other character in the movie.\n\nPoor character development plus bad cinematography and horrible music makes for a bad movie experience.\n\n5.) The Alamo (1960)\n\nI feel sort of bad putting this in the “Alamo fail” pile. The Alamo was indeed John Wayne’s masterpiece as a director. But John Wayne is a famous actor, not a famous director, for a reason.\n\nWhile the Alamo has a lot of social currency, it has that flaw present in almost all Alamo movies. It assumes too much. We are expected to see the Alamo has a crucial symbolic location, but the director doesn’t really do the work to make us think this way. In other words, if we are invested in the story before we watch the movie this won’t be a problem; however, if we are a typical audience member we have to just assume that if the Texans lose a lot of bad stuff will go down.\n\nWhat is at stake? John Wayne does a horrible job of explaining. It is like he is making a movie for someone who holds all of the same values. He is literally making a movie for himself. If he wanted to make it a movie about the importance of liberty, he should have done that with powerful imagery. He wasn’t able to do so. And this is the difference between a pro and amateur director.\n\nNevertheless, the imagery is iconic and it is a fun experience if you are interested in John Wayne or the Alamo.\n\nSorry if this review is offensive. But I was basing this all on setting, conflict, and resolution. Unfortunately John Wayne fell short in at least two of these categories.\n\n7.) The Alamo : Thirteen Days to Glory (1987)\n\nI don’t have much to say about this movie. Frankly speaking it was REALLY hard to get through. I wanted to buy it on iTunes. I’m lucky I just rented it.\n\nThis movies makes all of the fatal mistakes for Alamo movies and historical dramas in general.\n\nThe story tells history instead of showing it.\n\nThe director just assumes we should care about the conflict.\n\nThe characters aren’t characters — just vehicles to deliver lines about the narrative.\n\nThe movie doesn’t bring any new angle to the Alamo drama. It uses all of the typical plot points.\n\nIt was boring to watch.\n\nAnd Alec Baldwin was William Barret Travis ;)"
