4 Key Design Elements Nature

“Nature is my manifestation of God. I go to nature every day for inspiration in the day's work. I follow in building the principles which nature has used in its domain.” Geometry – Froebel Blocks

5 Froebel Blocks "That early kindergarten experience with the straight line; the flat plane; the square; the triangle; the circle! If I wanted more, the square modified by the triangle gave the hexagon, the circle modified by the straight line would give the octagon. Adding thickness, getting 'sculpture' thereby, the square became the cube, the triangle the tetrahedron, the circle the sphere."

6 More Designs with Froebel Blocks

7 Wright’s architecture is found all across the United States, as well as in Canada, England, and Japan. Wright designed many buildings in Japan, Iraq, and Egypt, some of which were destroyed and others that were never built.
