Promo expires on June 30th.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright Home History\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright’s Oak Park Home and Studio date to 1889, when Wright, armed with a loan of $5,000 from his boss (the acclaimed architect, Louis Sullivan), first bought the land and then completed his initial work on the Home. The Home and Studio have undergone several significant changes in the intervening years. Originally, the Home was a very modest, relatively simple two-story structure constructed to house Wright, his wife Catherine, and their small children. In time, though, Wright would modify and alter the structure significantly to suit his professional needs, as well as his growing family.\n\nIn 1895 Wright doubled the size of the house, designing and constructing a brand-new dining room and play area for his children. He then converted the former dining room into a home studio where he could conduct his drafting exercises. By 1898, Wright had started his own practice; as a result, he designed and built a whole new structure on the property to house his work—what we know today as the Studio. Wright kept his primary work studio at this site until 1910, while Catherine and the children lived there until 1918. Throughout the middle of the 20th Century the property changed hands several times, and eventually fell into disrepair. The Home and Studio were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1976, at which point an extensive renovation was undertaken.\n\nWhat’s at the Frank Lloyd Wright Home\n\nIt is said that Wright’s Oak Park Home and Studio were the very first architectural designs over which he (who was only 22 years old when the Home was first built) had complete artistic control. Accordingly, a tour of these remarkable structures offers fascinating insights into the early stages of what would eventually become Wright’s iconic sense of design and layout.\n\nAll the hallmarks of Wright’s mature style are present in the Home. The ground floor of the Home consists of a series of rooms that all seem to open up and flow into one another. A central hearth anchors one wall, and the décor here is dominated by warm-wood colors and sculptures and prints unique to the site.\n\nA playroom Wright designed for his children—arguably the highlight of the property—is found on the second floor of the Home. This beautiful space features a vaulted ceiling, a Roman-brick fireplace, an elaborate mural depicting a story from Arabian Nights, and bay windows complete with built-in window seats.\n\nWright’s Studio is connected to the Home via a small corridor, and consists primarily of a waiting room for clients, a small office, a library, and the drafting room itself. There Wright and his staff would have worked on their plans on drafting tables and chairs designed by Wright himself. Experts believe that Wright and his team created nearly 150 different projects here in the 15 or so years they worked in this beautiful space.\n\nTips for Visiting theFrank Lloyd Wright Home"
