        "text": "Meet us where the neighborhood is designed by a legend\n\nJust nine miles from downtown Chicago, a tree-lined neighborhood in Oak Park is defined by the legendary architect who called it home. It seems that the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District boasts a Wright-designed structure at every turn!\n\nNearly 30 homes and buildings here were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, including his own home and studio where he designed so many of the houses that you will see when you stroll through the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District.\n\nTo see the home and studio, Cheney Mansion, Unity Temple, and so much more, you can wander the area on a self-guided tour, or opt for a guided tour on foot, bike, or rickshaw!\n\nThe Frank Lloyd Wright Trust offers outdoor, guided walking tours like Wright in the Neighborhood and Wright Around Oak Park. If you’d rather ride your bike, the Trust also offers Pedal Oak Park, a guided bicycle tour. Bring your own bike or borrow one from your guides.\n\nWhile you’re visiting the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District, make sure to stop by the International Mansion, which houses Oak Park’s Language and Music School. Inside this castle-like structure, you can learn to play an instrument or speak a language."
