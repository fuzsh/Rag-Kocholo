The house features several signature Frank Lloyd Wright touches, such as a compressed entryway leading to a larger living space oriented around a hearth and an exquisitely Sullivanesque barrel-vaulted children&rsquo;s playroom. A narrow corridor connects the residence to the studio, which was added later. Inside the studio, rotated octagonal forms create unique meeting and work spaces, including an innovative light-filled drafting room with a balcony that is suspended from the ceiling. The building was once subdivided into apartments, but it has since been restored to its 1909 state&mdash;the last year Wright was in residence.",
