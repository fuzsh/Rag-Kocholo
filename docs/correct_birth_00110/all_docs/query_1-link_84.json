        "text": "Frank Lloyd\n\nWright\n\nThe modern architectural style of Frank Lloyd Wright is an intrinsically American style sometimes referred to as “organic architecture” which expresses a deep understanding of the landscapes surrounding his built works. Early in his career, he worked with architect Louis Sullivan whose simpler design aesthetics strongly influenced Wright.\n\nWright went out on his own in 1893, designing homes and public buildings in what became known as the Prairie Style of architecture. The residential built designs were often single-story structures with low, pitched roofs, and long rows of casement windows. His designs incorporated limestone walls and hearths trimmed with white oak and tidewater red cypress and attracted attention across the United States and abroad. Many would be designated as National Historic Landmarks.\n\nBeginning in late 1909, Wright devoted himself to writing and teaching, publishing significant architectural tomes, and founding the Taliesin Fellowship near Spring Green, WI. Soon he and his apprentices set up Taliesin West, a home and studio in Arizona where they worked in the winter months.\n\nWright’s later career included a design for the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, the residence named Fallingwater in southwestern Pennsylvania, his Usonian Houses, and several public buildings still in use, including the Guggenheim Museum in New York City.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in Richland Center, WI, in 1867. His father was a preacher and musician, and his mother was a teacher who came from a large Welsh family that settled in the area surrounding the Wisconsin River valley near Spring Green known as the Driftless Region. As a teen, Wright spent his summers working on his uncle’s farm and learned to appreciate the valley’s landscape and nature’s rhythms.\n\nWright studied at the University of Wisconsin, then left Madison for Chicago to work as an architect. During his time in Chicago, he worked for three different firms, and spent six years working directly under Louis Sullivan. Eventually, Wright formed his own architectural firm designing both private and public commissions."
