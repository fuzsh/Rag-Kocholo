Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was greatly known and respected for being an architect. He was also an interior designer, writer, and educator. Over his creative career that lasted 70 years, Wright designed more than 1,000 structures: 532 of which were completed. He developed a type of architecture, specifically, a philosophy — a practice according to a belief — called organic architecture.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Frank Lloyd Wright or alternatively, you can download our 22-page Frank Lloyd Wright worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born on June 8, 1867.\n\nHe was born in Richland, Wisconsin.\n\nWright’s mother was Anna Lloyd Jones, a teacher from a large Welsh family that probably migrated and settled in Spring Green, Wisconsin.\n\nTaliesin, Wright’s famous home, was built in Spring Green, Wisconsin.\n\nWright’s father, William Carey Wright, was a preacher and a musician.\n\nWright’s family moved to different places during his childhood.\n\nBefore settling in Madison, Wisconsin, his family lived in Rhode Island, Massachusetts.\n\nWright was 12 years old when they settled in Wisconsin.\n\nDuring the summer, Wright would spend time with his mother’s family in Spring Green.\n\nAt an early age, he developed an interest in the Wisconsin landscape.\n\nThe year 1885 was a significant year for Wright: not only was it the year when he graduated from high school in Madison, but it was also the year when his parents divorced.\n\nWright’s father became distant from the family.\n\nIt was also the year when Wright entered the University of Wisconsin to study civil engineering.\n\nWright carried the duty of supporting his family which led him to work for the college dean.\n\nHe also assisted the acclaimed architect Joseph Silsbee with the construction of the Unity Chapel.\n\nAfter assisting Silsbee, Wright decided that it was better for him to become an architect too.\n\nThat is why in 1887, Wright dropped out of school and worked for Silsbee in Chicago.\n\nARCHITECT WRIGHT\n\nThe following year, 1888, was the year when Wright became an apprentice at architectural firm Adler and Sullivan.\n\nHe worked directly for Louis Sullivan, another great American architect known as “the father of Skyscrapers.”\n\nHis work for Sullivan ended in 1893.\n\nIn 1889, Wright was 22 years old when he married the 19-year-old Catherine Tobin.\n\nThey had six kids.\n\nThey lived in the Oak Park Suburb of Chicago, now known as the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio.\n\nHis home in Chicago was considered as his first architectural masterpiece.\n\nWright founded and pioneered a movement in architecture called the Prairie School of Architecture.\n\nOrganic architecture was greatly applied in Prairie School.\n\nExamples of such architecture were homes with low-pitched roofs and long rows of casement windows, using only available materials and wood that was unstained and unpainted.\n\nThis style was used to emphasize its natural beauty.\n\nWright’s most popular and celebrated works that fall under the style of Prairie School architecture were the Robie House in Chicago and the Unity Oak Temple in Oak Park.\n\nWright’s Prairie School was popular in Europe, but he remained unknown outside the circle of the United States.\n\nFELLOWSHIP IN TALIESIN\n\nWright and Catherine were married for 20 years when he left her.\n\nHe moved to Germany with a woman named Mamah Borthwick Cheney, a wife of his client.\n\nThere, he worked with Ernst Wasmuth, an acclaimed publisher.\n\nWright published two portfolios of his work while in Germany. This helped him become more popular internationally.\n\nWright and Cheney returned to the US in 1913.\n\nIn Spring Green, Wisconsin, Wright designed a home named “Taliesin”, in Welsh, it means “shining brow.” This was one of his most popular works.\n\nHowever, in 1914, a deranged servant set fire to it. A fire that killed Cheney and six other people.\n\nAfter the tragic incident, Wright immediately rebuilt Taliesin. In order to, according to him, “wipe the scar from the hill.”\n\nIn 1915, Wright was commissioned by the Japanese Emperor to design the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo which he spent 7 years finishing.\n\nThe Imperial Hotel is a building that, as claimed by Wright, was earthquake-proof.\n\nIt was tested in 1923 when a great earthquake struck the city.\n\nThe Imperial Hotel was the only structure to survive the disaster.\n\nWright married sculptor Miriam Noel and divorced her four years later in 1927.\n\nTaliesin was set fire again due to an electrical problem.\n\nIt was destroyed and rebuilt.\n\nWright married his third wife in 1928, named Olga Ivanovna Lazovich.\n\nDEATH AND LEGACY\n\nHe was 91 years old when he died, on April 9, 1959.\n\nWright was known to be the greatest architect of the 20th century.\n\nHe is regarded as the greatest American architect of all time.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about Frank Lloyd Wright across 22 in-depth pages.
