        "text": "On June 8, 1869, Anna Wright of Spring Green, Wisconsin gave birth to Frank Lloyd Wright. Anna was a loving mother who decided her son would become an architect before he was even born. When Frank was young, she encouraged him to build things with colorful strips of paper and maple blocks. Her husband, William Wright, was a controlling parent and a strong disciplinarian. Wanting his son to excel at the organ and piano, William would rap Frank’s knuckles whenever Frank hit incorrect notes.\n\nAfter 18 years, Anna and William’s marriage went from bad to worse. In 1884, Anna told her husband that she would never again share his bed—and to her surprise, he divorced her and left the home. Wright attended the University of Wisconsin, stayed for a few semesters and left school against his mother’s wishes. He pawned his absent father’s clothes and moved to Chicago. There he got a job with the best architect in the city, Louis Sullivan. At the age of 21, Wright met the beautiful Catherine “Kitty” Tobin, a 17-year-old from a wealthy Chicago family.\n\nSoon he married Kitty, moved to the quiet, church-filled suburb Oak Park, borrowed money from his mentor, Louis Sullivan, and built their home. Less than a year later, Kitty gave birth to their first of six children, Frank Lloyd Wright, Junior.\n\nAnna [Wright’s mother] was a very complicated and mercurial, difficult woman. But...she had the most wonderful quality, the kind of quality that the ideal mother has. She was all for you. You were the apple of her eye, you were the god who had arrived into her life. You were the one...there was no limit to the kind of things you could do, the kind of dream mother we all wish we had. —Meryle Secrest, Biographer\n\nAnna [Wright’s mother] was unendurable and the father put up with her for years and years and years and then finally walked away. And then the mother went back to her family bearing a lifelong grudge and determined against the father and determined that her boy ...be everything that she wanted a man to be. Which is to be subservient, to knuckle under\n\nto her to be to be very proper, prim and socially correct person. And that was why she took him to Oak Park of all places, the primmest, properest,...most respectable and hypocritical community in America and brought him...up there. And then of course he consented to that for a long time. And married and had profligate number of children in this proper community. —Brendan Gill, Writer\n\nMost of his character came from his father who was a wonderful man, built like Frank Lloyd Wright, looking like Frank Lloyd Wright who was the scion of 300 years of American culture and a long line of Congregational ministers...the father could do anything: he was a wonderful writer, he was a wonderful orator, ...he composed music...he had all the gifts that Frank had...but Frank abandoned the father altogether when the father finally walked away from the mother whom he couldn’t stand. She was an intolerable human being....The father dropped out of the picture when Frank was 18 and Frank... chose to go with the mother and never have anything to do with the father again and never even attended the father’s funeral. Never did anything about the father. But [the father] was the great character who really helped so much to create the true Frank Lloyd Wright. —Brendan Gill, Writer"
