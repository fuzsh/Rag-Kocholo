        "text": "Wright’s first independently-built project was his own house, which he began in 1889 while he was working for his mentor, Louis Sullivan. The house was completed within a year, but Wright continued to expand and rework the house over the next eight years. At first the changes were necessitated by Wright’s growing family, but by 1893 he had opened his own office and needed space in which to work.\n\nWright combined his home and studio—one of his many departures from contemporary architectural practice, which usually took place in a separate, professional office. Later in life, he often insisted that his clients visit him at Taliesin (East) because he felt his own home would give them the best idea of what he would build for them.\n\nThe Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio is open to the public.\n\nThe three phases of construction show the evolution of Wright’s sensibilities in this early period. The first phase of the house included the bold gable roof and wood shingles of the Queen Anne (or Shingle) style. In contrast the office spaces, begun six years later, have flat or low roofs and long clerestory windows. The drafting room and library also employ octagonal geometry, which was traditionally used for church baptistries and shrines, and was associated with spiritual experiences. This relation between architecture and spiritual transformation would be an enduring one in Wright’s career.\n\nWright lived in Oak Park until 1909. As he would later at Taliesin and Taliesin West, he continued to work on his home throughout his residency. This spirit of experimentation appeared in major additions and smaller projects, each of which served as a test case for later designs.\n\nSome elements of Wright’s radical new style were borrowed from builders overseas—the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, the secessionist school in Vienna, and the architecture of Japan. However, no one had ever drawn upon all of them as he did. Wright’s houses were horizontal, rather than vertical, to fit into the flat Midwestern landscape and featured sheltering overhangs, low terraces, and sequestered private gardens. They would be set back from the street to insure greater privacy. They would also be stripped of the decorative detail Wright considered superfluous, because the outside of the house, he said, “was... there, chiefly because of what happened inside.”\n\nIn Wright’s houses, rooms were no longer to be “boxes beside boxes.” Instead, “the whole lower floor was to be one room” its many different uses suggested by screens rather than closed off with walls. Everything was to be a unified whole, Wright liked to say—order out of chaos.\n\nShingle Style\n\nAt the turn of the century architects like Frank Lloyd Wright were beginning to change America’s attitudes towards architectural revival styles. However, there were still popular revival movements that existed simultaneously with early modernism. The American Renaissance movement crystallized at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair Columbian Exhibition which put forth a vision of the modern American city designed in the language of classicism, which expressed ideals of grandeur , harmony and stability.\n\nThese artists and architects believed that the classical tradition could serve as a model for a new American civilization. They were well-versed in history and comfortable with the architectural vocabularies of Greece and Rome. Architectural firms like McKim, Mead, and White were proud practitioners in the American Renaissance style. Their success was partially attributed to the influence of the Columbian Exhibition on the stylistic choices of the American public.\n\nIn the case of Harold and Edith Rockefeller, the decision of what style to use for their residence brought them to opposite sides of the debate between modernism and classicism. Initially this couple commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for them in Lake Forest, Illinois. After Wright had completed a design for them, they changed their minds and decided that they wanted a more traditional-style home. They then asked Charles Platt; known for his revival style homes, to design an Italianate villa for them. The Villa Turicum, with its austere facade and entrance flanked by two classical columns, is a good example of the goals of the American Renaissance movement.\n\nBack to Works"
