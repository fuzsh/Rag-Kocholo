The survival of quality and individual feeling in an age which inevitably thinks in terms of quantity production and rule-of-thumb solutions is a matter that exercises the minds of all who worry about the way architecture is going. Frank Lloyd Wright, who has always championed the individual against the steamroller, and J. M. Richards contribute below their thoughts on this subject, with Wright leading and Richards commenting. Architecture is the mother--art. Its national value lies in its natural value. No architectonic construction can exist outside the realm of significance whether so intended or not. Significance may be haphazard or conceived with vision but whatever it implies is always there to be read by human intelligence. The significance of certain buildings would, therefore, be either communist, fascist, or democratic...\" Original cover price 5 shillings.

The erection of a novel building will soon be begun by the congregation of All Souls Unitarian Church, whose pastor is the Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones. All precedents have been ignored, and a building has been designed to meet in the simplest, quietest, and most natural way the peculiar conditions imposed upon the architects. These required, besides a large auditorium with the usual accessories, a gymnasium, baths, etc., a store, and a free reading room on the ground floor in front of the auditorium, a suite of rooms for the Unity Club, a suite of living apartments for Mr. Jones, and four floors of offices and chambers, with a Masonic hall and its accessories covering the entire eighth floor. The exterior walls, which are isolated from other buildings on all sides, will be of solid brick construction, and the general scheme is dignified and plain, almost to severity, depending chiefly for its effectivness upon largeness and coherence of composition and refinement of the very sparing detail. The auditorium will be barrel vaulted and richly treated in brick, mosaic, and plaster in Mr. Wright's original way, which is a restrained and agreeably geometrified phase of \" Sullivanesque.\" Frank Lloyd Wright and Dwight Heald Perkins are the associated architects.

V. While there is probably little romance about a bank, - less poetry in the bray of Sancho Panza's substantial, positive gray donkey than in the sound of Rosinante's spirited neighing, - yet the community likes to feel that this same bank is there to stay. It is, in fact, the town strong box. and it is a temple to the God of Money, as modern temples go. In its temples, though they perform the function of modern mercantile machines, the community would find the lack of some attempt at ideal enrichment intolerably offensive. Just what this ingrained human love of ornament is, is not clear \" not yet.

Jr.\n\nDescription: \"Brick Architecture in and about Chicago.\" An article that includes the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. It includes extensive descriptions, and images of the The Winslow Stable (1894 - S.025); Francis Apartments (1895 - S.032); Heller (2) (1896 - S.038); Husser (1899 - S.046); Charnley (1891 - S.009); Francisco Terrace (1895 - S.030); Winslow (1894 - S.024); Moore I (1895 - S.034). Very helpful in dating photographs of Wright's early. Excerpts:\n\nThe house at No. 99 Astor Street (Charnley) is one of the few which came from the office of Adler & Sullivan. Severe in its general aspect, its richness of detail is massed at and above the entrance and in the cornice. In these parts wood and copper have been employed, contrasting darkly with the buff Roman brickwork. Unfortunately the effect of this little building is now seriously marred by the huge walls of a newly built apartment house near by.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright's houses are all original and interesting. The house at River Forest (Winslow) is the architect's work best known and, on the whole, the most successful. The richly ornamented frieze and simple, widespreading roof are in perfect harmony with the site, the chief feature of which is a grand twin elm. In coloring, the house is very rich, the bricks are Roman of an almost orange tan in the mass, and are full of variety in shading and texture. The roof is of shingle tile especially burned to a rare, dull salmon pink.\n\nThe little stable and workshop (Winslow) is classic in composition and terminates the vista through the porte-cochere.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting houses on Woodlawn Avenue (Heller). The clere-storied one at 5132, designed by Mr. Wright, has been given a very pleasing, delicate texture by laying up the warm light gray Roman bricks in white mortar, suppressing the vertical joints with mortar colored to match the bricks. A formal planted approach of unique design, a loggia with octagonal columns of bricks laid with rustic angles, a rich frieze of \"staff\" modeled by Richard Bock, the sculptor, are interesting features, handled with characteristic cleverness and originality.\n\nThe Winslow Stable.\n\nFrancis Apartments. The half-timbered house (Moore) in Oak Park is noteworthy for its quiet simplicity and the richness of the timber treatment in the overhanging north gable. The lower walls are of deep warm buff Roman bricks, the balustrade of the yard wall and the corbel course under the second story are of richly modeled terra-cotta. A tool house is connected to the main building in picturesque fashion.\n\nThe house in Buena Park (Husser) is more striking than any of the preceding ones, but is hardly so successful. The projection of the eaves overpowers the staircase bay and the general effect of the building is not quiet enough. A charming feature of the exterior, however, is the little roofed colonnade or ambulatory, which forms an extended entrance porch, the reception hall, offices, etc., being on the ground floor. The principal rooms on this and the main floor are wainscoted with buff brick to the tops of the openings, the brick wainscot being enriched with inlaid bands of tile mosaic of gold and color.\n\nThe \"Francis\" apartment house on Forestville Avenue is bold and dignified in scheme yet refined in detail. Here Mr. Wright has used, in the lower story, a rich wall treatment of thin, flat band courses of Bedford stone with broad bands of flat terra-cotta ornament between them. The two entrance porches are ingeniously and delicately treated, but being in the angles of the porch, are not visible in the accompanying illustrations.\n\nThe \"Francisco\" apartments out on the west side, widely known as \" Honeymoon Terrace,\" is another building designed on novel lines for collective housing by the same architect. One view shows an angle of the great courtyard which is treated as a small public garden and on which the majority of the apartment entrances face. The other gives a glimpse of the court through the main portal on Francisco Street. A staircase at each angle gives access to a gallery extending all around the porch from which the tenants enter their respective suites of three and four rooms. The premises, particularly the gardens, are kept with scrupulous care and the apartments are very popular with young married people of modest means who have no small incumbrances. (Digital edition.)

The fountain was built to serve not only people but horses and dogs as well. The fountain's design is generally believed to be a product of sculptor Richard Bock but the actual attribution is a bit fuzzy. Donald P. Hallmark, a Bock historian, stated the fountain was designed by Bock between 1907 and 1908 but with the help of famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Bock did much of Wright's architectural sculpture and worked, for a time, in Wright's studio in Oak Park as well. It was Bock himself who suggested that it was Wright who pushed for the central opening in the fountain, and thus he \"began to lay claim to the whole project.\" The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation claims the work as a Wright design from 1903.

D. Brigham's Residence, Glencoe, Ill.\n\nThis house is owned by Mr. Edmund D. Brigham. Regarding his home, he says:\n\n\"The reinforced concrete house built by me during the past year, constructed principally during the winter of 1908-9, is located in Glencoe, on Sheridan Road, north of Central Avenue.\n\n\"The house has proven to be cool in summer and should be warm in winter, equipped as it is with hot water heat, and, excepting the unusually large amount of window space, is well protected from heat and cold, being solid in its construction.\n\n\"From a practical and artistic standpoint, I am more than pleased with the style of building and consider the cost about equal to that of brick or stone.\"\n\nThe type of construction is practically the same as that used in Mr. Frank Darling's residence, a detailed account of which is given in the description of his house. Four-way conduit tile, in combination with a monolithic outer wall, are used as foundation, the upper wall having a one-way tile backing.\n\nThe interior plastering is applied directly to the tile. The under structure of the roof, the interior partitions, floor, stair-ways and outside trim are of wood, the roof covering being red tile. The exterior trim was creosoted, hence no painting and little future repairing will be necessary. The exterior surface of the concrete, until recently, was in the same condition as it was when the forms came off; but a short time ago, Mr. Brigham had the surface painted with a thin cement grout, and the appearance of the house is much improved. Universal Portland Cement was used throughout. The total cost of this residence was $18,000.\n\nNote: One photograph of the exterior of the house, was most likely taken in the fall of 1909, or possibly the spring of 1910 after the snow melted. It is interesting to note that he has only lived in it during the summer - \"should be warm in winter\" which indicates he lived in the house during the summer of 1909, and wrote this during the fall of 1909. It is also interesting that Frank Lloyd Wright is not listed as the architect for this house, even though he was. He is listed as architect in the other three houses in this booklet that he did design, Evans, Gilmore and Stockman. Text lower left corner: \"85421.\" (Includes one photograph of the Bringham Residence.)\n\nPage 72:\n\nSection Four: Houses of Cement Plaster on Wooden Frame.\n\nMr. R. W. Evans' Bungalow, Chicago.\n\nAn interesting example of Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright's originality of design is located at 9914 Longwood Blvd., Chicago. It is owned by Mr. R. W. Evans, and was built by Mr. John Wilkinson, 1757 West 102nd St., Chicago.\n\nOne seldom encounters as beautiful a picture as this bungalow makes with its surroundings, when the foliage is at its best. Placed high on a ridge and well back among the trees, with a wide sloping lawn in the foreground, and a dark green background of shrubbery, it indeed presents a charming picture, impressing one with the idea of a cozy, comfortable home.\n\nThe long rakish bungalow effect obtained by the use of Japanese roofs, makes this a unique and artistic residence. The total cost was $12,000. The house is of frame construction with dark trim on the outside and light trim on the inside, and the exterior coat is white plaster, sand finished. The arrangement of the house makes it ideal for its purpose. The main part of the lower floor is a large living room, the upper floor being reserved for bedrooms and the like. One of the wings at the side is used as a dining room with a porte-cochere at the extreme end; the other wing is an open-air porch which is used as a dining-room in summer.\n\nThe house extends across the lot, but with the open porch at one end and the drive at the other, one goes through the house instead of around it. This is an admirable example of adaptability, illustrating that the residence can be, and should be, constructed to suit the grounds. Includes one photographs of the Evans Residence.

Gilmore's Residence, Madison, Wis.\n\nAnother of Architect Frank Lloyd Wright's designs is the unique and attractive house of Prof. E. A. Gilmore, of the University of Wisconsin.\n\nThe long, rakish Japanese roofs and balconies are in evidence, while the broad panels of smooth, white cement plaster, accentuated by rough dark trim, give the residence a marked individuality.\n\nMr. George Bischoff, a contractor, did the construction work, and the total cost of the place was $10,000. Prof. Gilmore is very well pleased with his house, and regards the investment as entirely satisfactory. (Includes one photographs of the Gilmore Residence.)\n\nPage 81:\n\nDr. Stockman's Residence, Mason City, Iowa.\n\nA striking example of unique style of architecture, combining the attractive with the comfortable, is exemplified by the residence of Dr. G. C. Stockton, of Mason City, Iowa.\n\nIt is a wooden frame house with an exterior coat of rough-cast white plaster. The foundation and basement floor are of solid concrete. The basement also contains a large cistern, made of concrete reinforced with wire.\n\nThe contractor for the work was Mr. Christ Rye, of Mason City, and it was executed under the personal supervision of the architect, Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright. The cost of the house complete was $7,000.\n\nDr. Stockton says that his home is thoroughly satisfactory, both as a home and as an investment, also that it is warm in winter, cool in summer, moisture-proof, and will need no painting or repairing.

The house of E. D. Brigham is shown in the illustration below, the accompanying drawings being reproductions of the floor plans of this house. Its unique arrangement and the methods of construction employed make it an especially interesting residence. The walls are constructed of monolithic concrete, air spaces being provided by a backing of conduit tile. The foundation is built of four-way conduit tile, laid in a trench fifteen inches wide with a concrete wall six inches thick outside the tile. Three feet above the ground single tile was substituted for the four-way kind and the forms were altered to provide a four-inch concrete wall in place of the thicker foundation wall.\n\nThe electric wiring was all carefully planned before construction and the wires were run through the conduits in the walls, thus insuring perfect insulation, the wiring for each floor being done before the concrete was poured. Vertical runs of tile were provided where necessary for vertical wiring. All the interior partition walls were built of single conduit tile, plastered on both sides without lathing...
