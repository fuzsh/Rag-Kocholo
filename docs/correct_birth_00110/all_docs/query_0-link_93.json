        "text": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nTheodore Farrington took this photograph of a young Frank Wright in Macgregor, Iowa. The Wrights lived there from 1871 until 1873.\n\nAs June 8 approaches, it’s time for\n\nthe annual performance of:\n\n“When and Where was Frank Lloyd Wright born”\n\nSo, I’ve got you covered on “when”. I wrote about that several years ago in this very little electronic space: “Keiran: Don’t Try to Correct the Internet“\n\nThe short story is that he was born in 1867\n\nor to make the SEO happy (with active verbs), I’ll write, “Anna Lloyd Wright gave birth to her son Frank in…”\n\nAnd you can read the post to learn more.\n\nBut the other question is:\n\nWhere was he born?\n\nWell, we definitely know it was in Wisconsin.\n\nThe location of the piece of ground on which he was born though? That’s where things get tricky.\n\nFirst of all, there’s no birth certificate\n\n(so I can’t even tell you if he was born Frank Lloyd Wright; or Frank Lincoln Wright, which biographer Brendan Gill put forth in his Wright biography1 and while it’s logical, there’s no written proof; thanks, Gill)\n\nYou see, when Frank Lloyd Wright was born on June 8, his father, William C. Wright, was working as a minister in Richland Center, 20 miles (32 km) from Spring Green. And the Wrights lived on Church Street in RC, which makes some conclude that Wright was born in the house on that street.\n\nThat would seem logical except:\n\nTwylah Kepler, Richland Center historian, told the Chicago Tribune in the year 2000 that shortly after Wright’s birth, Wm. Wright performed a funeral service in Bear Valley, 14 miles (22.5 km) from Richland Center, for someone in his congregation. Since Anna was heavily pregnant at that time, it seems likely she stayed near her husband.\n\nAnd fortunately for the Wrights, Wm. Wright’s former in-laws, the Holcombs, already lived in Bear Valley. In addition, historian Jack Holzhueter explained to me that it makes sense that Anna would have been ensconced in the house of the in-laws. Since Wm. Wright had the three children from his first (deceased) wife, Permelia, the in-laws could have taken care of the children, and Anna, during her “lying-in” (after all, it was her first child, and they were family).\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nThe late Wright historian William Marlin wrote that he discovered Wright was born on Church Street. This is part of the article in the Chicago Tribune in 2000:\n\nMarlin wrote a long letter about this birthplace research to Margaret Scott, the resident Richland Center historian at the time. Both have since died.\n\nMarlin told Scott his research led him to believe the home on Church Street is the most likely birthplace, and outlined why in several pages. He… said only new evidence would answer the question for sure.\n\nJack Holzhueter,… said Marlin’s letter prompted more research into the Church Street house. Instead of bolstering the possibility the town finally had its birthplace, that research cast new doubt on the site.\n\n“I don’t know that we will ever find a Rosetta Stone,” Holzhueter said.2\n\nMarlin died in 1994. His work on Wright’s biography was one of those things I came across that taught me a lot.\n\nI didn’t learn from what Marlin wrote; I’ve never seen that. But I’ve seen the photographs he collected.\n\nSee\n\nMarlin had been writing a highly anticipated biography on Wright. So he gathered hundreds of photos. And for reasons I don’t know, his photos came through the Preservation Office at Taliesin about 30 years ago.\n\nI also don’t know how long Marlin had been working on his book, but he had collected copies of dozens of photographs from:\n\n• the Pedro E. Guerrero Archives,\n\n• Wisconsin Historical Society,\n\n• Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives,\n\n• the Capital Times,\n\n• and others I’ve never figured out.\n\nEventually I grew to hate Marlin while working on figuring out the photographs. While they showed only things at Taliesin, they came with no organization, and I had no idea what time frame or even space that I was looking at.\n\nWhat happened, I think, is that the origin of the images (which I’m sure he kept somewhere) was separated from the key to them.\n\nAlthough, the information on where he got the images might have just been kept in his head.\n\nIn that case, yeah I do blame him.\n\nAt least he wasn’t that guy with hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin that he can’t get to because he lost the password\n\nSo the photos from Marlin were good because they made me look at the details to figure out things on my own.\n\nLike I wrote in “My Dam History” where a winter of staring at bad xeroxes of Taliesin taught me to closely look at photos.\n\nFor information\n\non the puzzle about Wright’s birthplace, read “Frank Lloyd Wright Was Born Here” from the Chicago Tribune published on May 25 2000.\n\nPosted: June 1, 2024\n\nThe Wisconsin Historical Society has the photograph at the top of this page, here.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Brendan Gill. Many Masks: A Life of Frank Lloyd Wright (G P Putnam’s Sons, New York, 1987), 25.\n\n2. as an aside, Jack apparently likes referring to the Rosetta Stone when discussing Wrightiana. He said the same thing when The Album of early Taliesin photographs was auctioned in 2005.\n\nReading Time: 5 minutes\n\nLooking (true) west toward the Taliesin estate from the edge of the parking area of the Frank Lloyd Wright Visitor Center.\n\nI’m working on my next post. So, I figured I would throw out easy dates and pieces of information about Wright and Hillside to give you a little amusement.\n\nWright’s height:\n\n5 feet, 8-and-a-half inches tall (1.74 m).\n\nThat’s what they tell you when you go to the Oak Park Home and Studio. His passport in 1905 has that height, and it makes sense to me.\n\nIn addition,\n\nHis height in the photograph below might help to prove it. It was published in 2014 in the Frank Lloyd Wright Quarterly (the publication from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation):\n\nHe’s standing standing against the big stone pier in Taliesin’s Breezeway with the Taliesin Drafting Studio to his right.\n\nWhen I saw that photo, I grabbed a tape measure and drove up to Taliesin. I realized the pier could be used as a way to figure out the man’s height. When I got there, I measured the height from where he was standing to the bottom of the stone that you see above his head that sticks out a little bit from the pier.\n\nThe height to the bottom of that stone was—I SH*T YOU NOT—5 feet 8 inches tall.\n\nNow, he was leaning a little, and the angle is different and other things have changed, but that was the height.\n\nI remember it because you remember something 5’8″ tall when it comes to Wright.\n\nI can’t tell you his shoe size, though.\n\nOk, onward:\n\nWhat day was Wright born?\n\nJune 8, 1867 (I wrote about it on this page).\n\nWhat color was his hair?\n\nBrown, before it went white.\n\nHis eye color? His son, John Lloyd Wright, when describing his father, wrote:\n\n“Brown eyes full of love and mischief, a thick pompadour of dark wavy hair – that is my father when I think of him as he was when I was very young.”\n\nJohn Lloyd Wright’s book, My Father, Frank Lloyd Wright (Dover Publications, 1992; first published as My Father Who Is On Earth, in 1946), 25.\n\nHowever,\n\nin this 1959 photo taken at Taliesin West, Wright has distinctly non-brown eyes:\n\nAnd then there was this color photo on the cover of the Frank Lloyd Wright Quarterly. His eyes look light brown. What the hell:\n\nIt appears the two photographs were taken on the same day.\n\nRegardless, perhaps John remembered his father’s eyes being brown, but apparently your eye color can change, which makes my musing moot.\n\nDid Wright ever talk to his dad after his parents split up?\n\n(they divorced in 1885)\n\nApparently not, according to biographer Meryle Secrest.\n\nAnd apparently, he didn’t go to his father’s funeral. Wright’s dad, William Wright, died on June 6, 1904 while living with one of his other sons in Pittsburgh. Architectural historian Robert Twombly noted that in his biography on Wright.\n\nHis father isn’t buried in Pennsylvania: his remains are in the Brown Church cemetery in Bear Valley, Wisconsin, about 20 miles from Taliesin. Of course, in 1904, Wright lived in Oak Park, IL.\n\nYet,\n\nWright didn’t go to his mother’s funeral, either. She died on February 9, 1923 and is buried at the Unity Chapel cemetery within sight of Taliesin. There’s no evidence that Wright was at her funeral. It’s hard to believe it since the chapel is down the road from his home, so it makes me think he was in California working.\n\nNow let’s look at Hillside\n\nThe building on the Taliesin estate that Wright originally designed for his aunts in 1901.\n\nDid Wright design furniture for it?\n\nApparently not. It doesn’t show up in photos or the few drawings that still exist for the building.\n\nPlus,\n\nI searched for them, just in case there were drawings that hadn’t been recognized in his archives. I did that in 2009 while Anne Biebel (principal, Cornerstone Preservation) and I were working on the Hillside Chronology.\n\nThat’s how I ended up finding the drawing of Taliesin 1 for the first time.\n\nI wrote about the second time I found a Taliesin drawing, here.1\n\nDid Wright ever design stained glass for it?\n\nNo.\n\nEven though he was doing lots of stained glass designs at that time, Hillside just had diamond-pane glass.\n\nIt’s economic, and Hillside was (is) in the countryside. Here’s a photo showing a boy outside of the building. You can see the the glass on the right hand side of the photo:\n\nYou can see the photo in my post, “Another Find at Hillside“, which explains the building on the left hand side of the photo.\n\nWill the diamond-pane glass at Hillside ever come back?2\n\nNo.\n\nWright began looking for replacement glass at Hillside while prepping for the Taliesin Fellowship in the summer of 1932. So he definitely did not want the diamond-pane glass there.\n\nOn July 20 of that year\n\nhis first letter (ID: M031B09), to Mautz Paint and Glass Co. in Madison, Wisconsin (now owned by Sherwin Williams) apparently went unanswered.\n\nNeither did\n\nthe letter (ID# P015A05) written on August 23 to the Patek Brothers in Milwaukee.\n\nHowever,\n\nthey had luck with the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, which sent glass to Wright and Hillside on December 20 (as seen in ID #P018B05).\n\nI do not know how Wright paid for it, but the shipped glass might have been in the condition that Wright first asked for from the Mautz Paint and Glass Co. The letter to that company asked for glass that was once known as “cull-plate,” or any “second hand plate in any proportion.”\n\nSounds like he was trying to get rejects, or returned glass. That way he could have done it by just paying for the shipping.\n\nWright could have changed the glass later when he had money, but he didn’t. So, again: the diamond-plane glass isn’t coming back.\n\nFirst published December 18, 2023.\n\nI took the photograph at the top of this post in March 2004.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Someone should pay me to do this stuff since I’m so good at it.\n\n2. The guides asked that a couple of times while I worked at Taliesin and did the\n\nquestion and answer feature.\n\nReading Time: 4 minutes\n\nThat’s what a former boyfriend once told me. I believe that came after I’d spent feverish, anxious hours trying to change every incorrect utterance online to Frank Lloyd Wright’s birth date: June 8, 1867. What was wrong? People wrote (and still sometimes write) incorrectly that he was born on June 8, 1869.\n\nWhat can I say? It was the 1990s and the World Wide Web was this new, awesome wonder. I thought I could send out the correct information, leading to an avalanche of facts, truth, and scintillating, heartfelt dialog.\n\nOr something like that.\n\nRegardless—what’s this deal about 1869?\n\nWhile Frank Lloyd Wright is responsible for a number of things in the world—\n\nlike, did you know he invented the wall-hung toilet? Ok, that knowledge isn’t up there in trivia contests like, “Who was the father of the man who invented Lincoln Logs?”, but knowledge about who invented the wall-hung-toilet might be good for something one day.\n\n—he’s also responsible for people believing he was two years younger than he actually was. He wrote about it and mentioned it in interviews so that, by the time he died in 1959, everyone thought he’d been born in 1869. Wright’s obituary from The New York Times (linked to in the last sentence), stated the architect died on April 10, 1959 at age 89; in reality, he was 91. That’s some deep stuff when the Paper of Record has it wrong.\n\nThis got in the paper even though his sister, Jane Porter (he designed her and her husband’s home), was born—when?—1869. She was born in late April. Catholic twins aren’t even born that closely together.1\n\nWright’s lie/falsehood/untruth was not dispensed with until 1967, 8 years after his death.\n\nThat’s why his birth year is incorrect if you see his original grave site at Unity Chapel in Wisconsin. The marker was made before they figured out the truth.\n\nOne scholar and finding the truth:\n\nIn honor of Wright’s birthday, I’ll relate the info from an article by scholar Thomas Hines, who uncovered the truth. Hines wrote the article on his findings in the Wisconsin Magazine of History, in Volume 50, number 2, Winter 1967, 109-119.\n\nThe article is “Frank Lloyd Wright—The Madison Years: Records versus Recollections”. In it, Hines detailed how we all got things wrong about Wright’s education, age, and his parents’ divorce. And that’s because,\n\n“[t]he chief source of such misinformation has been Frank Lloyd Wright, himself.“\n\nThomas Hines. “Frank Lloyd Wright—The Madison Years: Records versus Recollections,” 109.\n\nHines gave three pieces of evidence for Wright’s birth year being 1867:\n\n1. The 1880 United States Census, which,\n\nlists the names and ages of the family of William C. Wright and his wife Anna, giving the age of a son, Frank, as being thirteen. If Frank was thirteen in 1880, he would, therefore, have been born in 1867, not 1869.\n\nHines, 110.\n\n2. One of the schools that Wright attended (the “old” Madison High School, now Central High School):\n\nWright’s name appears… once in the surviving records of his high school. In the oldest volume… in the school’s collection… Wright’s name appears near the end of the book, with his father’s name, his address, 804 E. Gorham and his birth date, ‘June 8, 1867.’\n\nHines, 110.\n\n3. His parents divorce records. The records state that:\n\nthe parties hereto have three children… whose names and ages are as followed: Frank L. Wright, 17 years old, June 8, 1884; Mary Jane Wright [Jane Porter], 15 years old, April 26, 1884; Margaret Ellen Wright [Maginel Wright Enright Barney], 7 years old, June 19, 1884.” Listed by his father, under oath, as being seventeen on June 8, 1884, Frank Lloyd Wright would, therefore, have been born on June 8, 1867.\n\nHines, 111.\n\nWhy did the architect lie?\n\nWe don’t know.\n\nBiographer Meryle Secrest posited that,\n\nthe new birth year of 1869 did not come into use until November 1925.2 Conceivably, the immanent arrival of his seventh child3 and the fact that Olgivanna was so much younger were the precipitating factors. However, a year later, when the idea of incorporating himself came to him, it would have occurred to the prudent side of his nature that it was far easier to sell shares on the future of a man still in his fifties than on one who is almost sixty.\n\nMeryl Secrest. Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography (1992; HarperPerennial, HarperCollins, New York City, 1993), 334.\n\nHines on Wright’s “embellishments”:\n\nThe piece by Hines addresses not just Wright’s lie about his age, but also the architect’s lies about his education, and his parents’ divorce. In sum: Wright’s recollections did not match the factual records.\n\nIn the end, Hines speculated on why Wright altered the facts:\n\n[S]lowly over the years, Wright’s unique creative nature demanded and conceived for himself a persona, a mythic personality surrounded by a partially mythic world; that indeed he had no conception of objective “truth” as most people define it, but that he determined the truth of all things by the degree to which such things supported or contradicted the “truths” of his own world. A family situation and an education as he described them seemed, therefore, more appropriate and acceptable as an introduction to his life than the real situations had been.\n\nHines, 119.\n\nSo, 8 years after his death, people began to realize what Wright meant when saying, “The truth is more important than the facts.”\n\nAddendum: Update on the date:\n\nAfter publishing this blog, one of my subscribers, who is the Administrator for Historic Studies at the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, gave me information on their understanding of Wright’s change of his birth year. Indira wrote that:\n\nMrs. Wright told people that Mr. Wright had always given that date as the date HIS mother gave him, and she took it as truth.\n\nOn June 21,1967 Mrs. Wright responded to a letter from Catherine Baxter4 who was annoyed by the false birth day given for Mr. Wright:\n\n“Dear Catherine, I fulfilled my promise to you and spoke of your father’s mixed dates as you will find in these articles…”\n\nOriginally published on June 1, 2021.\n\nUpdated June 4, 2021.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 I knew two brothers in my class in grade school who were born 10 months apart. Until I heard about their birthdays, I’d assumed they were fraternal twins. I hadn’t learned the term “Catholic twins” until much later, but it was Catholic school. Hence, I also had two classmates with at least 7 siblings a piece.\n\n2 In an article in the Madison newspaper, The Capital Times, on November 17, 1925.\n\n3 Iovanna Lloyd Wright, December 2, 1925-September 7, 2015.\n\n4 Catherine Baxter (1894-1979) was third child and first girl born in the marriage of Frank and Catherine Lloyd Wright (Wright’s first wife)."
