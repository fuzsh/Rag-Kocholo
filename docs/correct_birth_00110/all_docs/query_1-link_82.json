The cost is nominal.... read more The neighborhood of prairie style homes is wonderful.\n\nThe museum is very well executed and the staff friendly.\n\nNext time in the area we will check out the Park Inn and Bank commissioned and built by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThis is a surprisingly great small city in the middle of Iowa Corn!\n\nInteresting to see one of Frank Lloyd Wright's \"budget\" designs.

Property looked like it was made for it and the surrounding neighborhood is filled with homes designed by Wright's associates in the \"Wright\" style. I wish other homes in the neighborhood would be open for tours. Looks like an amazing neighborhood to live in.\n\nI wish they accepted advance reservations. We arrived early as we were concerned about tours filling up, but they stated they don't get many visitors which is quite surprising."
