        "text": "From the gothic spires of the Tribune Tower to the limestone parapets of the Chicago Water Tower, The Magnificent Mile is home to some of the world's most dazzling architecture. But that's just a sample of the beautiful architecture to be found in Chicago, where many of the innovations in American architecture began to take hold in the early 20th century. Many famous architects began their careers hereâ€”including perhaps the most legendary American architect of all, Frank Lloyd Wright, whose unique style can be found in works throughout Chicago and all over Illinois.\n\nFrom the north end of Michigan Avenue, it's an easy walk to the Charnley-Persky House Museum, one of Wright's earliest collaborations with Chicago architecture titan Louis Sullivan. Built in 1892, the one-time residence is considered by some to be the first truly modern American home.\n\nDown in the Loop, the building known as The Rookery also shines a light on Wright's early career. Architects Daniel Burnham and John Root first built the iron skyscraper in 1888, but Wright remodeled the lobby in 1905, installing a magnificent glass interior through which sunlight casts dazzling shadows on the marble floor.\n\nThose are just two of Wright's works to be found along Illinois' Frank Lloyd Wright Trail, a self-guided architectural tour of 9 Illinois communities featuring 13 Wright-designed buildings that are open to the public for tours.\n\nLearn more about the Trail >>"
