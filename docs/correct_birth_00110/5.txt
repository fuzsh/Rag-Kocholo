Where exactly in Wisconsin was Frank Lloyd Wright born? Linda talks with Todd Allbaugh, director of the Richland County Chamber of Commerce and Richland County native. The celebration of Frank Lloyd Wright's June 8 birthday has been held there for about 5 years. The event draws mostly tourists, but since no one knows just where the architect was born, the tourists have no place to photograph. Many bios of Wright put his birthplace somewhere in the town of Richland Center. But one local historian says Frank Lloyd Wright may have been born in a different town in the same county. Allbaugh says people should stop debating, and just pick a place IN Richland Center as the likely birthplace.
