        "text": "Visual best practices are key to developing informative visualizations that drive your audience to act. A dashboard is successful when people can easily use it to derive answers. Even a beautiful dashboard with an interesting data source could be rendered useless if your audience canât use it to discover insights.\n\nThink not just as an analyst but also as a designer and consumer. Dashboards should have interactive elements that are discoverable and predictable, follow a sensible, logical layout, and have a simplified design that makes complex decisions easier. It is important not to assume that people automatically know what it takes to clearly and effectively communicate with data. Here are a few whitepaper links to share on your enablement intranet:\n\nVisual analysis guidebook\n\nWhich chart or graph is right for you?\n\nGood enough to greatÂ\n\nDesigning efficient workbooks\n\nYou can find a list of books by renowned data visualization experts in the appendix. Adding these whitepapers and books to the resources of your analytics community can lead to a deeper understanding and internalization of visual best practices.\n\nAudience\n\nThe best visualizations have a clear purpose and work for their intended audience. Itâs important to know what you are trying to say and who you are saying it to. Does your audience know this subject matter extremely well or will it be new to them? What kind of cues will they need? Thinking about these questions before you begin designing will help you create a successful dashboard. For example, you would present aggregated, summary-level data and KPIs to an executive audience rather than row-level transactions.\n\nContext\n\nMake sure your views include context. Titles, captions, units, and commentary all help your audience to better understand your data view. Always strive to tell stories with your data and your visuals. Understand that good stories involve more than just data, and consider the following:\n\nMind your aesthetics and know that what is effective is often affective. In other words, an effective view can create an emotional response and a genuine communication to your audience.\n\nStyle is also important. Make sure that your views are consistent and pleasing to the eye. Your views are representative of who you are and what you care about.\n\nDashboards that people can interact with are very engaging. Interactive elements allow your audience to manipulate the data, ask and answer questions, and arrive at findings on their own. This helps to foster trust in your data.\n\nMake your views vivid and memorable. Pay attention to structure and context.\n\nChart Choice\n\nChart choice should depend on the question you are trying to answer or a specific insight you are trying to communicate. There is almost always a trade-off involved, with different chart types each having their own advantages and downsides. You should always ask yourself if your chosen chart type best conveys the message you are trying to share and if it can be easily understood by your audience. The table below explains the chart types in Tableauâs Show Me panel and when to use each. This should be published to your enablement intranet to educate new users.\n\nÂ\n\nChart\n\nDescription\n\nÂ\n\nLayout\n\nHow your audience âreadsâ your dashboard is not a trivial consideration. Your dashboardâs purpose is to help guide the readerâs eye through multiple views in coordination and tell the story of each insight. Your dashboard needs a sensible âflowâ and a logical layout of different pieces of information. The more you employ better dashboard design, your users will discover whatâs happening, why, and whatâs most important. Consider how youâre guiding their eyes across the dashboard. Are you showing the user where to look next?\n\nDesign theory gives us plenty of advice on how best to succeed. Layout is a key component of any successful dashboard design, here are a few concepts you want to think about when building visualizations:\n\nNewspaper or Z-layout â The most important content is put either at the top or the left of a visualization, as users move right and down for more specific content.\n\nWhite space â Using negative space (blank spots) and padding to delineate sections of your visualization â donât use thick âgrid linesâ as you would see in a table.\n\nSize â More important pieces of content (KPIs, summary visualizations, etc.) should be larger than other items.\n\nDevice type â With device-specific dashboards you can create the optimum viewing experience on desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone.\n\nÂ\n\nColor\n\nColor is one of the most powerful aesthetic features because itâs an attention-grabber. Itâs the first thing we notice, and it can immediately highlight specific insights or identify outliers, but it is not an unlimited design resource.\n\nUsing color effectively is critical for producing quality data visualizations â color types (alerting vs highlighting), creating custom color palettes, and consistencyâare key aspects to build into your standards.\n\nThe correct use of color is critical for producing coherent and impactful data stories. The key factors that should be taken in to consideration for any successful dashboard are:\n\nManaging color choices â The primary color(s) that make up most of your design should be a neutral color. Using techniques like grayscale, you maximize the possibility for contrast and visibility of your data driven points. Your extended colorsâaccents, emphasis, and alertsâshould reflect the brand. Any extended color should be used sparingly to draw attention to key messages within the data.\n\nColor types â Understand when to use sequential, diverging, categorical, highlighting, or alerting color motifs.\n\nCustom color palettes â Build your own company palettes to bring a sense of uniformity and provide guiderails for new users.\n\nConsistency â Double-check your visualizations to make sure a color (e.g. red) does not mean three different things. Similar and repeated colors can imply a relation where one doesnât exist.\n\nAccessibility â Remember to account for color blindness in the design process.\n\nTitles & Subtitles\n\nTitles are an easy way to make your dashboard more digestible for your audience. You add more context with subtitles that describe how to interact with the worksheet or dashboard. This is a powerful and simple way to make dashboards easier to navigate. In the example below, the question pulls the audience in and then tells the audience how to answer the question using the dashboard.\n\nEffective Title and Subtitle\n\nÂ\n\nSimilarly, by changing your filter title to something more intuitive, you guide viewers through how to interact with a dashboard.\n\nÂ\n\nExample of a Filter\n\nTooltips\n\nTooltips guide the audience by highlighting important information. In the example below, the County and State are highlighted through a bold effect and color change, and we donât have to partition our scatter plot further. We add important and related dimensions and measures in the tooltip. This helps save space and declutter the dashboard so our viewers can focus on gleaning insights instead of interpreting the visualization.\n\nEffective Tooltip\n\nÂ\n\nIf the viewer notices something interesting in the tooltip, they can interact directly with the tooltip and watch the rest of the visualization come to life, highlighting related marks and outliers.\n\nFormatting a Tooltip\n\nFonts\n\nTypography is important. It can be tempting to use many font types and sizes in a dashboard. Donât do that; instead, define a clear hierarchy for your typography. In the example below, there is a top, mid, and low-level font. The mid-level is blue to focus viewer attention. Color draws the eye to the most important level (which neednât necessarily be the top-level font).\n\nTop, Mid, and Low-Level Fonts (Courtesy of The Big Book of Dashboards)\n\nÂ\n\nMake sure that font selection is done to reinforce a visual hierarchy within your visualization through size, boldness, color and type.\n\nSize â Larger elements convey importance as they catch the eye.Â Save your largest fonts for KPIs, titles, etc.\n\nBoldness â Bolder elements convey importance as they catch the eye. You can vary boldness throughout your visualization in conjunction with size. For example, your title and KPIs could both be 24pt font, but making your KPIs bold will âpopâ them, allowing your audience to focus there first.\n\nColor â Generally itâs good to stick with gray and black hues in your titles, text, and KPIs. You can âpopâ your KPIs by giving them a color treatment, but you have to balance this with the other colors used in your visualization. Darker colors will draw the eye, so itâs wise to lighten your titles so they donât compete for visual attention.\n\nDashboard Size\n\nBy default, Tableau dashboards are set to use a fixed size. If you keep this setting, be sure to construct your visualization at the size which it will be viewed. You can also set Size to Automatic, so Tableau automatically adapts the overall dimensions of a visualization based on screen size. This means that if you design a dashboard at 1300 x 700 pixels, Tableau will resize it for smaller displaysâand sometimes this results in scrunched views or scrollbars. The Range sizing feature is helpful for avoiding this.\n\nDashboard Size Range\n\nIf you're using Tableau Desktop to create dashboards, you can also design for specific device layouts, so that on tablets, for example, your dashboard contains one set of views and objects, and on phones it displays another. See Create Dashboard Layouts for Different Device Types for steps.\n\nDashboard Interactivity\n\nWhen designing a dashboard, you need to consider your audience, and how you can communicate to them that they can interact with the dashboard. Skilled users know to click and experiment, but new users may not have the knowledge or confidence. Your job is to help them make these decisions consciously, not by accident.\n\nItâs important to make any interactivity obvious to your audienceâeven by creating subtitles to instruct them to click or hover for more information. Add interactivity to your data using filters, tooltips, and actions. Filters are the most obvious way to interact with a dashboard. Users can also interact with your visualizations by selecting marks and hovering to see tooltips. The actions you set up can respond with navigation and changes in the view. The table below enumerates the ways to create interactivity in your dashboards.\n\nType\n\nDescription\n\nHighlighting & Highlight Actions\n\nEasily find data of interest while remaining within context.\n\nSee other marks with shared attributes.\n\nFind related data across sheets.\n\nFiltering & Filter Actions\n\nFocus on data you want to analyze.\n\nControl context of data.\n\nShow relevant data and remove unnecessary data.\n\nParameters\n\nExplore what-if scenarios.\n\nCustomize your views.\n\nEnhance dashboard flexibility.\n\nSets & Set Actions\n\nDynamically update the members of a set.\n\nCompare parts to whole.\n\nSeamlessly drill down through hierarchies.\n\nUpdate a calculation by interacting with data.\n\nTooltips\n\nProvide details on demand.\n\nKeep your dashboard minimalistic.\n\nInsert a viz in a tooltip.\n\nURL Actions\n\nIncorporate external content in a dashboard.\n\nProvide more in-depth information on demand.\n\nLink users to websites.\n\nDashboard Navigation\n\nGuide users through your workbook.\n\nDirect users to additional content.\n\nÂ\n\nWhen designing dashboards, consider how and why you incorporate interactivity into the dashboard. The following questions are helpful:\n\nWhy does a viewer need to interact with the dashboard?\n\nWhat extras insight will be gained through the interactivity?\n\nDesigning for Performance\n\nWhen we talk about performance, we mean the speed with which you can work in Tableau. That might mean the speed of data analysisâfor example, if you work in Tableau Desktop on a large corporate database that takes forever in real time when you access it remotely.Â Or it might mean simply the speed of loading views or dashboards that you access on your desktop or from Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud.\n\nPerformance and efficiency should be treated as part of the design processânot as an afterthought. Responsiveness is an important success factor for end users when viewing reports and dashboards, so making your workbooks run as quickly as possible makes for happier users.\n\nThere are several factors that make a workbook âefficientâ. Some of these factors are technical and some more user-focused but in general an efficient workbook is:\n\nSimple â Is it easy to create the workbook and will it be easy to maintain in the future? Does it take advantage of the principles of visual analysis to clearly communicate the message of the author and the data?\n\nFlexible â Can the workbook answer multiple questions the users want to ask, or just one? Does it engage the user in an interactive experience or is it simply a static report?\n\nFast â Does the workbook respond quickly enough for the users? This may mean time to open, time to refresh, or time to respond to interaction. This is a subjective measure, but in general we want workbooks to provide an initial display of information and to respond to user interactions within seconds.\n\nThe performance of a dashboard is impacted by the following:\n\nThe visual design at both the dashboard and worksheet levels, e.g. how many elements, how many data points, use of filters and actions, etc.\n\nThe calculations, e.g. what kind of calculation, where the calculation is performed, etc.\n\nThe queries, e.g. how much data is returned, impact of custom SQL, etc.\n\nThe data connections and underlying data sources.\n\nSome differences between Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud.\n\nOther environmental factors, such as hardware configuration and capacity for Tableau Server.\n\nFor more information, see Designing Efficient Workbooks.\n\nAccessibility"
