EXHIBIT A ADDITIONAL TERMS - ROBOFORM/GOODSYNC DISTRIBUTION 1. Licensed Use and Distribution. Affiliate shall provide the possibility to install the Products from Affiliate Site(s) to end-users of Affiliate's Site(s) only and not to subdistributors or any other third parties. 2. Payout Rates.

Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Code of Conduct shall have the same meaning as ascribed to them in the Affiliate Agreement. Definition of 'bundled.' For purposes of this Code of Conduct, a \"bundled\" product or application includes all other products or applications that may be downloaded to, and installed on, the User's computer at the same time as the Product, or at a later time by an application or product initially delivered at the same time as or otherwise connected to the Product, excluding new version updates and upgrades to the initially delivered application or product. See also \"Notice Required\" section, below. Affiliate Site. Affiliate Site must be (i) content-based, i.e., not simply a list of links or advertisements, nor a site which is centered around making money off of Company advertisers, as may be determined by Company in its sole and unfettered discretion; (ii) written solely in English (exceptions require Company's specific, prior written approval); (iii) a top-level domain, as that term is defined by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers; and (iv) fully functional at all levels, i.e., no \"under construction\" sites or sections. Affiliate Site must not contain incentives to Users to click on ads such as cash awards, points, prizes, contest entries, etc. Affiliate Site shall not primarily target Users younger than 18 years of age. Affiliate Account. Only one Account is allowed per company or organization unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Company. Affiliate may use this Account for multiple Affiliate Sites, provided that Affiliate register each and every Affiliate Site in their Account where Company software will be distributed. Notice Required. Affiliate agrees to accurately provide easy-to-read and easy-to-understand notice and information to all Users of Products and all other applications that are bundled with Products (if any, and which requires Company's specific written consent), before initiating a download to and installing the Products or applications on a User's computer and to give such User an easy and appropriate method to agree or not to agree to such installation. Affiliate shall under no circumstances attempt to launch a Product executable without first displaying the above-described messaging and receiving explicit User consent for the installation. Company reserves the right to approve final wording of this messaging and to require periodic changes as necessitated by changes to Products or for other business reasons. Affiliate shall not alter code to automatically initiate the license prompt, nor shall Affiliate drive traffic to web pages where content is set to autoplay. Content may only be set to autoplay on pages displayed following explicit User action (such as a mouse click). Ability to Easily Uninstall Required; TRUSTe Compliance. Affiliate will ensure that the User may easily remove and/or uninstall not just the Products, but each and every other application bundled with Products by using the Microsoft Windows \"Add or Remove Programs\" menu. Affiliate will also ensure that all applications bundled with Products adhere to terms no less restrictive than those contained in this Code of Conduct. Other products or applications that act as program \"Trojans\" (installing additional applications without full product descriptions and EULA acceptance) shall not be bundled with any Product. In addition, Affiliate will ensure that any applications it bundles with Products adhere to the requirements of the TRUSTe Trusted Download Certification Program guidelines (for details on the Program, visit http://www.truste.org/pdf/program_requirements.pdf), including, without limitation, that such applications do not contain code that reinstalls the Products automatically if removed by means other than the Add or Remove Programs feature. Such reinstall may only occur after the User has affirmatively opted-in to the reinstall. Audit Rights. At any time, Company will be allowed to test all other products with which a Product (or, without limitation, any portion or derivation thereof) is bundled to ensure Affiliate's compliance with the guidelines and terms herein. Neither the conducting of such testing, nor the failure to do so, will act as any certification or other affirmation that Affiliate is in compliance with the terms and conditions herein nor relieve Affiliate from any liability hereunder. Upon request, Affiliate is required to provide live links to all locations where Company's products are available. Upon request, Affiliate is also required to provide additional proof of identification in a form acceptable to Company in its sole discretion. Keyword Marketing. Affiliates are required to generate installs from a website or websites that they directly own or manage. Company does not allow Affiliates to generate traffic by inserting paid ad placements in pay-per-click search engines including but not limited to Google AdWords, Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Microsoft AdCenter, and directly sending traffic to Siber Systems websites. Affiliates are also prohibited from using registered Siber Systems domain names or close variants in the display URLs for paid ad placements pay-per-click search engines including but not limited to Google AdWords, Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Microsoft AdCenter. No Spam. Company does not accept any form of spam and detects/discards all traffic from unsolicited email, newsgroups, instant messages, chat forums, unauthorized adjustment of default home page or search features within standard browser settings and all other methods other than that generated from an active human. Spamming by any of these methods will cause the responsible Affiliate Account to be terminated. No Objectionable, Inappropriate, or Unlawful URLs. The action of sending any hits from any URLs or any materials protected by DRM technology that contain and/or promote the following content is not permitted: warez, cracks, serials, keygens, ROMs, EMUs, newsgroup postings, spam emails, illegal MP3s or any other site that contains content or promotes activities that are illegal in the United States of America. No Fraudulent Installs. Affiliate shall not generate or facilitate fraudulent or artificially created installs, including, without limitation, installs generated through (i) forced, automated, mechanical or electronic means (including hitbots, multiple clicking scripts, hidden links, incentivizing surfers or any other similar activity), (ii) altering the User's security settings, or (iii) unsolicited emails, electronic data mining, harvesting or other similar means of generating artificial activity (e.g., transfers generated by a bot, macro program, internet agent or other similar device). Affiliate may not send traffic to Company or to Affiliate Site by any type of automatic installs, browser exploits, viruses, bots, rootkits, or by any other means, even if otherwise legitimate. Affiliate shall not use false advertising or other deceptive or inappropriate means to generate installs. Compliance. Affiliate will perform its obligations pursuant to this Code of Conduct in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Affiliate will: (a) not engage in any unfair or deceptive trade practice involving the promotion or distribution of the Products; (b) not include on any Affiliate Site any content or material that in Company's sole discretion (i) is defamatory, libelous, slanderous or offensive, or that abuses or threatens physical harm to others, (ii) is offensive, insensitive or disparaging regarding racial, ethnic, or political matters or is otherwise objectionable, or (iii) infringes the rights of any party or any law, regulation or legal authority including, without limitation, rights of publicity or privacy; (c) not make any false, misleading or disparaging representations or statements with regard to the Products or Company or Company's employees; (d) post and comply with a privacy policy clearly setting forth its practices regarding the collection, use and dissemination of User personally identifiable information; and (e) not infringe, misappropriate or violate any Proprietary Rights of Company or any third party. Affiliate Responsibility. Affiliate is solely responsible for any Affiliate Site(s) and all content that appears on and any collection of information by Affiliate on Affiliate Site(s). Affiliate may use or display Company materials only in the size, place and manner Company may indicate within Affiliate Site(s) and only in a manner that complies in all respects with Company's guidelines, as the same may be modified from time to time by Company in its sole discretion. In addition, Affiliate will ensure that appropriate messaging and EULA acceptance precedes every installation of a Product and every other product that is bundled with a Product. Violations of Code of Conduct - Disgorgement of Profits and Liquidated Damages. If Company determines that Affiliate is in violation of any of the terms and conditions of this Code of Conduct, in Company's sole discretion, then Company shall notify Affiliate and Affiliate agrees that it will immediately and permanently end the activity that violates the Code of Conduct. Company will withhold payment for the improper installations and Affiliate shall be subject to liquidated damages as set forth in the immediately following paragraph. If Company has already paid for improper installations, Affiliate agrees to refund all such amounts to Company within three (3) business days after the Company sends notice to Affiliate of the improper installations and Affiliate shall still remain subject to the liquidated damages set forth in the immediately following paragraph. The foregoing shall in no way limit the legal or equitable rights or remedies available to Company in connection with a violation of the above requirements, or otherwise. The parties agree that strict compliance with the terms and conditions of this Code of Conduct is at the essence of the relationship between Affiliate and Company. The parties further agree that damages from breach of this Code of Conduct may be difficult to calculate. Accordingly, the parties agree, in addition to any indemnification or refund obligations herein (and without limitation to any other legal or equitable rights or remedies) to liquidated damages calculated as follows: two times (2x) the amount equal to what Company did pay or would have paid Affiliate if the installs had been proper. Indemnification for Violations of the Code of Conduct. If any claim is made, or any action or proceeding is instituted, against Company that alleges or is based upon or arises out of Affiliate's breach of any representation, warranty or obligation arising under this Code of Conduct, Affiliate shall indemnify and hold Company harmless from all damages, awards, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) associated therewith. Such indemnity is in addition to any other indemnity (either in the Affiliate Agreement or otherwise) made by Affiliate. Changes. Company reserves the right to change the terms of this Code of Conduct at any time without notice to Affiliate and, by continuing to participate as a Company partner, Affiliate agrees to be bound by such revised terms. Company will post those changes on the Code of Conduct page of the applicable website. Affiliate's continued participation as a Company partner following the posting of such changes to the Code of Conduct will constitute Affiliate's acceptance of any such changes."
