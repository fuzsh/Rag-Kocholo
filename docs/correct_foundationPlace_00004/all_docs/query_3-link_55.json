Add this to your analysis to start with summaries and drill down into the metrics, all within the same dashboard sheet.\n\nAfter you set this up, when you click a data point (for example, a point in a line chart), you instantly filter using all mapped fields on all the other visuals on that sheet. If you have multiple datasets, all target fields must be mapped for this to work. Also, you can only have one action that works by clicking a data point; all other actions work from the context menu.\n\nUse the following procedure to create a one-click filter in an analysis."
