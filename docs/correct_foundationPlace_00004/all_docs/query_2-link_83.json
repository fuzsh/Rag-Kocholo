        "text": "TXF is a market leader in the trade, commodity and export finance industries. Collectively these industries contribute to the $5 trillion+ global trade finance ecosystem. They do this through the provision of tools that mitigate the risks involved in importing and exporting goods and services globally. In so doing, they are instrumental in oiling the chains of global trade, contributing to the real economy, and creating jobs across the supply chain.\n\nAs well as the exporting and importing companies, trade finance is tied together by banks who provide the critical access to finance, supported in that mission by guarantees from trade credit insurers and governmental export credit agencies.\n\nVisit TXF\n\nProximo specialises in project finance, a type of financing most commonly used for energy and infrastructure assets. These infrastructure assets - which include rail, roads, hospitals, schools, manufacturing plants, water treatment facilities, satellites and more - are fundamental to the functioning of all countries and communities. Similarly the energy assets range from traditional energy sources such as oil and gas to future-focused sources such as biofuels and solar power - but in both cases they are geared towards the critical goal of meeting the world’s energy needs with Net Zero transition at the forefront.\n\nProject finance brings together a considerable number of parties ranging from SPV borrowers and sponsors to investors, banks, multilateral institutions, operators, insurers and lawyers, to deliver these large scale infrastructure projects and financings, reflecting the importance of Proximo’s role in connecting communities.\n\nVisit Proximo\n\nUxolo is dedicated to growing development finance and impact investing. These areas facilitate finance into projects that support ESG standards and promote the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore they contribute to the mitigation of climate change and the betterment of humanity and the natural world, as well as provide an economic net benefit in the countries in which they are located.\n\nThe industry’s role has become more urgent in the wake of the pandemic, given it can revitalise economies through local projects, and is essential to critical rebuilding projects in countries that have fallen victim to war, natural disasters and other cases of force majeure.\n\nDevelopment banks and multilateral finance institutions are at the heart of this mission, while other key participants include institutional investors, commercial banks, high net worth individuals and charitable foundations.\n\nVisit Uxolo\n\nKujenga is a heavily personalisable virtual events platform that was born out of necessity during the pandemic but now thrives as a membership hub during the recovery. The platform encompasses all the key elements of a successful conference: great content delivery, easy and accessible networking, and a smart, interactive offering for sponsors that tracks and delivers on their KPIs.\n\nOne of Kujenga’s key strengths lies in its customer service. We understand that the needs of clients and their audience are entirely unique and that the events world in particular is constantly changing. Moreover, event providers have varying levels of in-house tech expertise. Accordingly, our offering is adapted to their needs, with dedicated account managers working in partnership with our clients, rather than leaving them to fend for themselves with faceless training videos and FAQ sheets.\n\nBut perhaps Kujenga’s most unique feature is its one-click ability to turn a live virtual event into a permanent content hub. In this way, it turns event attendees into content subscribers and has the power to radically transform conference providers’ business models.\n\nVisit Kujenga"
