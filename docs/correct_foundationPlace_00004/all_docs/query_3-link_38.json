Many users navigate back to home using the browser back button â€“ even though clicking on the logo is a commonly accepted norm, and the vast majority of websites use this convention\n\nThat said, the use of the logo as a home link is not uncommon and I was wondering there was a minimum size which the logo must be to ensure that it can be easily clickable without requiring a precise mouse positioning.\n\nMy question was also fueled after finding the small facebook icon used in the the new facebook layout super hard to click unless I was using a mouse"
