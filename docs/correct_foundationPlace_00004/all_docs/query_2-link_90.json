        "text": "This article was born out of an active discussion that sparked during one of our retrospective meetings. Our team was discussing the issues that our clients often bring up during calls: what is the most important type of testing today? Which testing activities require particular attention from human testers: functionality, security, or perhaps UI testing? In other words — which tests cannot be skipped and must be done by an attentive testing specialist?\n\nMany experts focus on more or less similar tests, only adapting the definitions in accordance with the respective target audience. In this article, we won’t name all the testing types once again, but we’ll talk about the most important one — UI/UX testing.\n\nWhy does UX UI testing occupy an increasingly important place in the modern software development and testing landscape? How to make sure the product meets the needs of the users with UI/UX testing? And how to choose the right approach for comprehensive testing of usability and user interface? Find out all about it from our guide.\n\nWhat Are the Main Requirements for a Good UI and UX?\n\nThere is a standard list of requirements that fit most of the apps and if they are met, chances are high that your app or website will have a good usability score. These requirements, in one way or another, are used by all professionals and vendors that provide usability testing services.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe product should be accessible to the largest number of its potential users. People with disabilities should be able to use it via assistive services just as easily as an average target user. People with different backgrounds and native languages shouldn’t have issues using your app either.\n\nPerceivability\n\nAll parts of the interface should be easy to perceive and have alternatives. For example, if an image is unavailable, it should have alternative text or a caption so users can understand what it represents. Another example is providing captions in video material and a transcript for audio.\n\nOperability\n\nThis usability requirement concerns user activity and means that everything that is conceived should be possible to use, for example:\n\nAll the features should be available and working.\n\nUser needs to have enough time to read the interface and its content.\n\nThe content should be physically safe (e.g. it should not cause seizures in predisposed users).\n\nEase of Navigation\n\nOn the same note, what makes an interface operable is good navigation, in any type of website or software, from the simplest to the more complicated ones.\n\nNavigation should be made as simple, easy, and seamless as possible so that users don’t think about doing something and just do it.\n\nHigh Performance\n\nTo gauge the performance of your site or app, you need to be aware of the speed at which it loads pages and content, especially high-quality images. Text loads faster than images and illustrations, so the aim here is to make sure your product is in no way sluggish and loads within a matter of seconds.\n\nAnd in terms of design, you should think about what’s happening while the content is loading. For example, the spinning wheel was introduced to interfaces so users know that something is happening and the app didn’t just freeze.\n\nUnderstandable Interface\n\nIn an understandable interface, the content is readable – there’s no fine print or clash of colors. It also operates in predictable ways so users can avoid making mistakes.\n\nFor example, if a user is filling out a form and missing a required field, a window will pop up alerting them to the problem.\n\nResponsiveness\n\nSince handheld devices are used more than computers and laptops these days, it’s important to keep up with the times and adapt content and web design for phone use as well. This poses a web design challenge because most sites are designed with computers in mind.\n\nResponsiveness is all about your site working smoothly and cleanly regardless of the device it’s opened on. You can even do this adaptation on WordPress, but it still needs to be tweaked to look as presentable as it would on a large screen.\n\nLearnability\n\nLearnability is the ease and pace at which a user picks up the ways to use a product. It used to be very common for user interfaces to require training to operate them but the current trend is toward creating UI that is usable for every kind of user right away. This is why learnability is such an essential requirement; it makes sure that different kinds of users, including complete amateurs, can get on board easily.\n\nCredibility\n\nCredibility means that your product should inspire justified trust in users. This means people are trusting that:\n\nThe product will do what it is intended (or expected) to do;\n\nIt will do it in a safe and harmless way;\n\nIt will be of the expected quality and do it in the expected time.\n\nIt’s simply impossible to ship out your product with a faulty UI and bad UX and expect customers to still be willing to adopt it. Users will just go elsewhere and find what they are looking for.\n\nUser-Friendliness\n\nThis just means that the UI should be a pleasure to use. This could mean aesthetically pleasing designs, quick navigation and loading times, and any other features that users love to see on their interfaces. This is such a big requirement because many users base their opinions about products and interfaces on how user-friendly they are.\n\nAbsence of Errors\n\nThis means that it should be virtually impossible to give wrong results when information is fed into the app or website. It should be bulletproof against the entrance of invalid data or unexpected user scenarios. The harder you make it to make an error in the first place, the better the error tolerance of your product will be.\n\nSmooth Flow\n\nA good flow is a combination of actions that follow seamlessly, exactly as a user intuitively expects it to be. Some examples of bad flow are:\n\nUnreasonably long processes with many steps and screens to pass;\n\nUnnecessary or irrelevant pop-ups between commands;\n\nRepeated steps or expected steps missed.\n\nIn terms of website usability, flow also means that one relevant page is followed by another relevant page without any additional information being thrown at the user.\n\nCustomization\n\nIt deeply depends on each app or website; however, nowadays, we’re used to customized experiences and we expect a certain minimal level almost everywhere. This basic level includes the ability to manage such things as user names and avatars, color schemes, and timezones — it’s what we do in many apps, from email accounts to games. In more complicated apps, the expected level of customization may go deeper and include many more features corresponding to the product.\n\nUser Engagement\n\nVisually stimulating content that is fun and interesting to look at guarantees user engagement. Certain apps boast much higher user engagement levels than others, and one huge reason for this is that they promote the kind of content that they know will garner the most user attention and engagement. This means that the majority of users should rate your app’s tools as fun to use.\n\nWhat Is UI Testing?\n\nUser interface testing is a type of testing in which testers need to make sure that all buttons, fields, labels, and other items on the screen work as specified. UI testing involves checking screens with controls, such as toolbars, colors, fonts, sizes, buttons, icons, etc., and how they respond to the user input. Simply put, with the help of UI testing software, we see how an application, website, or software will interact with the end-user.\n\nBenefits of UI and UX Testing\n\nUser Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) testing definitely require a lot of time and effort to be done properly. However, even when you are looking to optimize your QA process, UI/UX testing should never be omitted because it brings many sizable benefits to the stakeholders. Here are some of them.\n\nHigher Quality of Software\n\nIt’s that simple — a software product with a properly tested user interface and optimized user experience is miles ahead in terms of quality over its competitors without the same amount of testing. And the higher quality of software leads to a string of other positive outcomes for a new or established software product.\n\nBetter User Engagement\n\nInvestigating the way users interact with a software product and finding out whether they are happy with the product in the first place builds a solid foundation for higher user satisfaction. The more users like the product and the more frequently they engage with it, the more likely they are to turn into loyal customers.\n\nFewer Opportunities Lost\n\nIf you have ever struggled with placing an order in an online store and then quit anyway because the site was riddled with bugs, then you understand how much of a negative impact the lack of UI/UX testing can have on a product. In other words, thorough testing helps you make sure that users don’t abandon your product and that you don’t miss out on revenue.\n\nStrong Competitive Advantage\n\nIn a time when there are lots of players even in the smallest niches and industries, a business should use every advantage it can get. In many cases, a good, well-tested UI and UX can become that one competitive advantage you are looking for, especially when your closest competitors don’t seem to bother with this type of testing. As ubiquitous as UX testing may seem, only 55% of companies do it, which means you can get ahead of the game.\n\nOptimized Development Cycle\n\nTimely UI/UX testing helps you optimize your development process and release products faster. For example, when UX testing in the early stages of product development shows that users don’t particularly enjoy a feature you’re planning to add, scraping those plans saves your development team some valuable time and allows you to release the product sooner.\n\nUI Testing vs. UX Testing: What’s the Difference?\n\nUX and UI testing are two terms that are so often used together that some people also begin to use them interchangeably. And while both of these testing types revolve around the human experience with the product, and a faulty UI will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the UX, there is a clear distinction between the two and they should not be confused.\n\nUI refers to the things we see, while UX is all about the way we experience the product. A good example of that is web design that is rich in animated and interactive elements. Their presence adds value to the website’s UI and makes it more eye-catching than its competitors. However, the way real users feel about those elements may tell a different story, as animations can be distracting, overly flashy, or obscuring other website elements from view. And you can only find out about that by conducting extensive usability testing. Here are a few more crucial differences between the two types of testing:\n\nUI testing focuses on the correct layout and placement of design elements, while UX testing focuses on the connection between the design element and its impact on the user experience.\n\nUI testing can be performed as soon as the element has been designed and coded, while it’s only possible to do UX testing after the element has been linked to the specific functionality.\n\nUI testing can be successfully automated, and is generally pretty easy to automate, while UX testing heavily relies on the human eye and human interaction with software, which makes it challenging to automate.\n\nHow to Perform UI/UX Testing\n\nThe process of UI/UX testing encompasses a wide range of activities and requires a well-thought-out approach with a lot of planning. However, the whole process can be broken down into just three steps. Here is how to do UI/UX testing.\n\n1. Identify the Areas You Want to Focus on\n\nBoth UI and UX design testing don’t always require the team to test the software product as a whole. A round of UI/UX testing can include just one or several elements that are crucial to the product’s success. The team needs to have a clear understanding of what they are about to test.\n\n2. Plan and Conduct the Tests\n\nUsing checklists or other techniques to plan the testing process, the QA team needs to take their time to prepare for the actual testing. Then, when everything is ready, the team will run the tests, working according to plan and documenting the results.\n\n3. Analyze the Findings and Make the Changes\n\nThe final stage of testing UX and UI in a software product is collecting the discoveries, evaluating their effect on the solution overall, and working together with the development team and other project stakeholders to eliminate the issues and further increase the quality and user appeal of the product.\n\nChallenges of UI/UX Testing\n\nAs much as testing a website or app for usability is one of the crucial activities that define the audience reception and the subsequent success of a software product, this process is not without its challenges. While trying to eliminate UI and usability challenges, the testing team can encounter certain complications, and here are the most common ones.\n\nSelecting the Areas for Testing\n\nA modern software solution is a highly complex system with rich functionality, countless design elements, and endless ways for users to interact with it. This creates an additional challenge for the testing team, as it is hardly feasible to test every single possible interaction. The team’s job is to prioritize the test cases, finding the perfect balance between testing as many areas as possible while keeping the use of the resources reasonable.\n\nDiversity of the User Base\n\nProducts created for the general audience, as opposed to software built for highly specific industry use, need to account for all the variabilities that come with a diverse user base. This includes different levels of technical proficiency, different devices used to access the software, different accessibility needs, and different habits when it comes to interacting with software. It means that the QA team must go beyond the standard UI/UX testing methods like basic accessibility testing and test from the user’s perspective, truly embodying various user personas and types.\n\nEnsuring Management Buy-In\n\nWhile most modern business owners won’t argue too hard with the necessity of software testing, they often want to do the bare acceptable minimum like functional testing and security testing, while UX and UI testing get put on the backburner. This is why the QA team must work closely with the project stakeholders and decision-makers to ensure a complete buy-in from the very beginning, keeping them informed all throughout the project and after its completion, so that they see what kind of an impact their efforts make on the usability of the product.\n\nRacing Against the Clock\n\nIt’s safe to say that the market for any type of software is getting more competitive by the minute. Users don’t have to stick with a product riddled with usability issues, as new, alternative software is released regularly and quickly. This means that teams need to get equally quick with their testing efforts. It’s important to find a solution that allows you to test as many scenarios and cases as possible in as little time as possible. Automated testing is one of the most effective ways to speed up the testing process and catch up with the growing competition.\n\nAutomating UX and UI Testing\n\nWhile automation testing seems like the perfect answer to all UI and UX testing-related challenges, the reality is that it can create some challenges of its own. Most importantly, usability testing is one of the most difficult types of testing to automate, as it heavily relies on the ways real humans interact with the software — something that even the most advanced testing tools are not yet ready to replicate completely. Plus, automation requires a significant investment of time and money to get the project going, so all stakeholders need to get a realistic idea of the automation ROI and manage their expectations accordingly.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBoth UI and UX testing are relatively new but rapidly developing types of testing. In fact, to be able to perform these tests, extensive experience won’t cut it. You must also keep a close eye on design trends, learn how to use automation tools, and be able to carry out a detailed analysis of information constantly. UI and UX testing is not the cheapest service provided by the testing firm, and it is obvious that each business will choose services depending on its goals, capacities, and needs.\n\nBut it should be kept in mind that no matter what your project is or what features it includes, the main criterion for its evaluation (aka — success) is an attractive and convenient UI that ensures a truly great experience for your users. As one study points out, every $1 invested in a good UX has a return of $100, so it’s definitely worth your time and effort."
