The Menu widget is automatically populated with the pages, links, and folders as they appear in the Page panel. Names of pages, folders, and links appear in the menu in the order you arrange them unless you click Hide from menu in the Page panel. When you nest pages and links in a page or folder, they appear in the Menu widget as a drop-down menu. A folder provides a drop-down menu that allows the top level to be clicked without changing the page. Users interact with the menu by hovering over or clicking the link, which provides navigation back to the pages in your experience."
