        "text": "What skills should you look for when hiring great talent? The answer also applies to any individual looking to advance his/her career, and it applies to the types of founders we love working with.\n\nThe Five-Tool Superstar, a concept we first introduced in 2013, has a unique skill-set spanning technology vision, product sensibility, business acumen, resourcefulness, and leadership. The first three pillars represent a progression, starting with a fundamental and differentiated technology vision. Once in place, itâ€™s important to have product sensibility - about the design of the product, the value propositions, and target audiences. Great product on its own is insufficient to scale -- strong business acumen leads to meaningful, outsized value over time. The final two skills of leadership and resourcefulness are foundational and can make or break any technology, product, or business. In a way, they underpin and amplify everything.\n\nWhile individuals truly adept at all five skills are rare, the best teams recognize what capabilities they have and which they lack, and subsequently complement one another such that in the aggregate, they have the ability to draw upon all five tools.\n\nThe true five-tool superstar is a rare find -- so much so that most successful teams don't have any single such star. What the best teams have are individuals who recognize what capabilities they have and which they lack, and subsequently complement one another such that in the aggregate, they have the ability to draw upon all five tools.\n\nRather than simultaneously strive to achieve excellence in all five areas, start by selecting one where you not only have the aptitude, but also possess the passion to continuously improve and master that ability over time. Being superlative at any one of the five tools will make you valuable to any team; two or more will make you a star. All five and one day you just may find yourself mentioned with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Jeff Bezos among the pantheon of modern day business greats."
