One of our clients has over 30,000 buildings nationwide. Given this volume and diversity of locations, facilities management represents a significant portion of our client’s operating budgets. However, it is noteworthy that many recent developments, including rising wages, technology disruption, and now a pandemic, have made cost savings a very high priority. MBA CSi provides facilities management experts that are skilled in Building Inspection/Condition assessment, Lease Management & Negotiations, Facilities Call Center, Building Management & Maintenance, Energy Management, Facilities Planning, Real Estate Project Management: O&M and Onsite Construction, Space Management, Asset and Capital Management, Computer-aided facility management (CAFM), Data Management, Configuration Management, and more.\n\nTo provide world-class services, MBA CSi recruits industry experts, and our staff develops innovative facilities solutions that integrate people, places, and technology. We work to streamline facilities management and administer essential services for unique and specific building specifications. Our team prioritizes the improvement of workplace designs and flexibility, including the use of Human Factors Engineering and User-Centered Design. For example, when designing facility products, systems, or processes, we always consider the interaction between each facility element and the employees. This is part of our approach to Occupational Health Service (OHS). One of our clients uses many technology devices, including tens of thousands of sorting and scanning machines for mission-essential services. We strategically generate proper ergonomic design specifications to prevent repetitive strain injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders. This is an essential service that improves employee engagement and results in higher employee productivity.\n\nToday, MBA CSi supports a government agency’s real estate portfolio of over 30,000 buildings, which has nearly 300 million of interior square feet. We continuously make sure that this facility’s portfolio is managed with a reliable governance structure. Also, we help to administer services that are provided by trusted suppliers at a reasonable cost. We must continually innovate and adapt to current trends of brick and mortar vs. eCommerce solutions. Providing the appropriate facilities solution helps ensure the proper stewardship and real estate portfolio and resources management.\n\nDue to recent COVID events, MBA CSi expects facilities management and building maintenance to continue to evolve at an accelerated pace. We are helping clients redesign workspaces, as many employees are working remotely. Technology and demographics will continue to drive innovation and transformation. MBA CSi is ready to meet the growing expectations of our clients and deliver solutions that improve functionality, comfort, health, safety, and efficiency of work environments.\n\nAuthor: Sean Delaney, MBA CSi’s SVP of Strategy\n\nMBA CSi\n\n14900 Conference Center Drive\n\nSuite 525\n\nChantilly, VA 20151\n\n(703) 344-9000\n\nhttps://www.mbacsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FacilitiesManagementLogo.png 426 994 Sean Delaney https://www.mbacsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo_cleaned_color.png Sean Delaney2020-07-27 14:40:202020-07-27 14:40:20Facilities Management\n\nMBA CSi Named Winner of USPS 2019 Supplier Sustainability Excellence Award\n\n/\n\nMBA CSi recognized for excellent performance on the national recycling program.\n\nChantilly, VA., June 28, 2020 – MBA Consulting Services, Inc.

However, organizational change management means different things to different stakeholders. IT project managers see change management as the defined process controls in place to gain approval to change a project’s scope, schedule, and budget. On the other hand, executive leadership and the collective user community view change management as a change to behaviors, and the new and improved ways of conducting business. Everyone shares a common goal to realize value and achieve desired results. Many federal agencies face complex challenges with organizational change management (OCM) obstacles. Government stakeholders must see these obstacles as opportunities, not obligations. The agencies that implement and dedicate time and effort to enterprise OCM—the human side of change—realize superior benefits.\n\nOCM thought leadership is critical for agencies looking to transform and modernize. The key is collaboration and iterative progress to gain buy-in. Just as agile processes are followed where projects are developed in sprints (lasting just days or a few weeks), a project can also undergo iterative or Agile OCM plan. A skilled thought OCM leader will have extensive communication expertise in Agile OCM and know how to create a strategic change plan that accelerates change adoption. MBA CSi’s OCM framework was designed for Agile transformation and accounts for the impact of new business processes, changes in organizational structure, and cultural changes within the enterprise.\n\nOCM is valuable when change requires people to learn new behaviors. An Agile OCM plan itself is not enough. Instead, the value of an Agile OCM plan is realized incrementally through the improvements in human behavior and sustained advancements of work results. By setting expectations early, using tools to improve communication, and proactively identifying ways to reduce misinformation, agencies are more likely to adapt to change. To accelerate change adoption, we embed Agile coaches within Agile teams. Our coaches ensure teams understand the change impacts, assess training needs, and reduce productivity dips. Furthermore, Agile coaches customize the process for faster adoption without negatively impacting schedules. The right player-coach solution provides users with the confidence that their voice is heard, that their day-to-day work activities are understood, and their feedback is both welcome and implemented.\n\nAnother vital aspect of Agile OCM success is User Journeys. User Journeys inform all users, participants, and stakeholders of leadership priorities. After all, it is the leadership that must embrace new behaviors first to motivate the rest of the user community. This allows the agency to demonstrate vision, help understand user behavior (possible resistance), identify potential issues, and implement a realistic approach based on organizational readiness and capacity to change. The result is always an experienced partner who understands the agency’s business, enterprise environments, and provides the necessary level of support to execute its journey successfully.\n\nTransforming culture can be challenging – especially when communicating at the speed of Agile. Our Agile OCM approach accelerates positive human behavioral change times. Experience is key, and our past performance highlights valuable lessons learned. Best practices and perspectives gained across high-visibility and complex programs allow us to identify and resolve challenges quickly. We also break down silos, improve leadership, and user adoption by demonstrating a shared understanding of strategic direction. This allows the agency to map organizational priorities and goals with mission requirements. Our Agile OCM approach scales to any customer and any mission.\n\nAuthor: Sean Delaney, MBA CSi’s SVP of Strategy\n\nMBA CSi\n\n14900 Conference Center Drive\n\nSuite 525\n\nChantilly, VA 20151\n\n(703) 344-9000\n\nhttps://www.mbacsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ChangeManagement.jpg 253 380 Sean Delaney https://www.mbacsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo_cleaned_color.png Sean Delaney2020-06-02 15:38:052020-07-06 17:39:42Agile Organizational Change Management— Why It’s Still Necessary\n\nCustomer Retrospective—Infinite Business Value\n\n/\n\nIt has been more than 20 years since the first introduction of Agile principles, and today Agile practices are widely accepted. Among the many benefits of Agile, one of the most overlooked and distinguishing ones is a customer retrospective. The Manifesto for Agile Development defines a retrospective as, “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” Simply put, retrospectives, or retros, highlight what is working well and what is not working well. The idea is to reflect on experiences with the motivation to improve continually.\n\nMBA CSi embraces customer retrospectives. Our approach is to conduct customer retrospectives at least quarterly. The more frequent the retrospective, the better the team can better identify and track risks. Each key customer or stakeholder is invited to speak candidly to ensure all team members hear valuable first-hand feedback. Customers and teams collaborate in a formal, retro meeting, usually with a dedicated and independent facilitator. We find that an independent facilitator encourages everyone to share opinions and experiences so that a team can learn, collaborate, and improve. It is essential to recognize there are always ways to innovate and grow. Retros offer the opportunity to celebrate milestone successes, and also to identify blockers—issues or anything that slows down a schedule.\n\nThe goal of the retro discussion is to identify actions that are documented on posters or whiteboards. Usually, there are dozens of yellow stickies of action items and observations posted around the meeting room. Sticky notes are merely a placeholder for face-to-face collaboration and discussions. The facilitator gathers unique action items and ensures each one is assigned to an individual or owner.\n\nMBA CSi and its GovCon clients find infinite value with retrospectives. These sessions always encourage thought leadership and innovations. Our experience ensures a smooth partnership with our customers and, more importantly, a better way of doing business.\n\nAuthor: Mark Colturi, MBA CSi’s COO\n\nMBA CSi\n\n14900 Conference Center Drive\n\nSuite 525\n\nChantilly, VA 20151\n\n(703) 344-9000\n\nhttps://www.mbacsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hp_solution_professional-e1587563780813.jpg 474 650 Sean Delaney https://www.mbacsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo_cleaned_color.png Sean Delaney2020-05-31 18:48:152020-05-28 19:05:41Customer Retrospective—Infinite Business Value\n\nProject Management – A Paradigm Shift\n\n/\n\nIs traditional project management obsolete? Many traditional project management plans are based on a Waterfall or a Critical Path plan-driven approach. Under the right conditions, a conventional method can be successful. Today, the Agile methodology is most prevalent. However, that does not mean we should shoehorn a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nMost everyone agrees that the best practice approach is to embrace new tools, processes, and technologies. Successful management and technology consultants adapt to a customer’s technology maturity and establish an every day/practical project management foundation. MBA CSi’s non-traditional approach is called Transformational Agile Management Approach (TAMA). TAMA provides insight and oversite. It combines the very best practices of Agile and traditional management approaches. Our TAMA approach encourages innovation and resists the notion of “that’s the way we do things here.” Our project managers and technology leaders can quickly and continuously validate project milestones against business objectives. It also allows both the project manager and customer to implement changes rapidly at a decreased cost with lower risk.\n\nUsing TAMA, we have experienced increased collaboration and project control through adaptable project plans. Essential activities are readily managed to schedule, programmatic insights are encouraged throughout day-to-day activities, and real-time documentation is available for stakeholder transparency. TAMA provides immediate and continuous feedback without impacting cost, schedule, or performance. It offers dependable performance synchronization with natural alignment to any client’s mission.\n\nStrategically combining the best practices of each approach—and tailoring our approach to a customer’s technology maturity level—inspires creativity and innovation while providing planning and control to achieve predictability.\n\nAuthor: Sean P.

One of our key clients uses many technology devices, including tens of thousands of mobility tools for mission-essential services. MBA CSi uses Human Factors Engineering (HF&E) to meet occupational health and safety and productivity goals. Generating proper ergonomic design specifications is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders. Unfortunately, if appropriate ergonomic design specifications are faulty or non-existent, over time, it can lead to long-term disability.\n\nMBA CSi uses HF&E for mobile device selection. HF&E allows a laser-focused approach to ergonomics. We use a dedicated lab to ensure both hardware and software are optimized. Our team operate repetitive tasks, diagnose and resolve issues, and train users to maximize productivity and efficiency. This helps minimize the potential for upper extremity injuries that could be associated with repetitive motions. Our approach to HF&E stresses the importance of user-centered or person-centered design. It ensures people, tasks, and environments are safe, effective, and efficient.\n\nAuthor: Sean P.
