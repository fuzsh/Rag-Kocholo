You can choose from English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.\n\nSelect a category\n\nNext, choose the category that best describes your video content. This will also help the YouTube description generator come up with suggestions that are more relevant to your particular type of content.\n\nAdd a call to action\n\nChoose what action you want your viewers to take after watching the video. This could be to like, comment, subscribe, or something else related to your channel.\n\nAdd a topic and add some context\n\nFrom here, add a topic that most closely relates to the video. This could be a broad topic like “technology” or “entertainment”, or something more specific like “a description of how to use AI-powered social media tools.”\n\nEnter your keywords\n\nNext, enter a few keywords related to your video. If you don't know what keywords to use, use an SEO keyword research tool. Or, enter relevant keywords into YouTube's search bar and see what related words it suggests. Check out our blog on YouTube SEO to learn more.\n\nAdd a benefit to the viewer\n\nAs you may know, solid YouTube video descriptions should entice users to click by telling them what they’ll get from watching your video (more on this below).\n\nIn this field, you’ll want to identify the benefit to the viewer. What will they learn? Will they laugh or be entertained? Will your content help them make money or get healthy? Add it here.\n\nGenerate\n\nFinally, tap Generate and watch the YouTube description generator work its magic. Feel free to customize any outputs as you see fit.\n\nTips for writing a great YouTube video description\n\nNow that you know how to use the YouTube description generator, here are a few tips to help you write great descriptions for your videos.\n\nAdd timestamps\n\nTimestamps are a great way to break up your video into sections and help viewers quickly find the information they’re looking for without having to watch the entire video. Include a mention of timestamps at the beginning of your description, so it’s clear to viewers that you've provided a way for them to easily skip around.\n\nKeep it interesting\n\nThe first 200 words of your YouTube description show up in search results, so make sure those words are captivating and draw viewers in. Keep it interesting by using creative language and phrases that will engage the viewer, such as questions, puns, or pop culture references.\n\nTell users what they’ll get from watching your video\n\nIn some ways, your video description and title are a bit like your YouTube sales pitch. They should highlight what a viewer would get out of watching your video. Will they learn something? Get a free download or template? Finally answer a burning question in their mind? Don’t give it all away, though! A short preview is enough to entice interest.\n\nTest your description on mobile\n\nFinally, make sure to preview your description on mobile. According to our research, mobile users watch twice as many videos on YouTube as desktop users. So, be sure to test your description on different devices to make sure it looks great and is easy to read.\n\nInclude relevant keywords\n\nKeywords should be sprinkled throughout your description to help viewers find your content more easily in search. Be sure to repeat any keywords used in your YouTube video title or in the video itself.\n\nLink out to other content\n\nYour YouTube video description is the perfect place to include links to other content, such as your website or social media pages. You can also include any relevant external links that are connected to the video, such as blog posts or product pages."
