        "text": "There is widespread acknowledgment that a high percentage of persons experiencing homelessness have substance use disorders. The purpose of this section is to present additional information that may be useful in evaluating this phenomenon and analyzing potential paths forward. This portion of the FAQs has four sections that provide a high level overview of several of the components of the current situation:\n\nDescription of the two most prevalent/dangerous drugs found on the streets ofHollywoodâfentanyl and methamphetamine\n\nData with respect to the extent to which substance use disorders precede homelessness\n\nDescription of the current state of law enforcement in Hollywood with respect to illicit drug use or sale\n\nDescription of the availability of public programs available to persons with substance use disorders\n\nWe should note that, while substance use disorders involving alcohol play a prominent role among persons experiencing homelessness in Hollywood, this section will not describe that issue since todayâs problems with alcohol abuseâunlike issues raised by fentanyl and methamphetamineâappear very similar to the issues historically raised by this substance use disorder.\n\nâ\n\nFENTANYL AND METH\n\nThe two hard drugs that appear to be the most consumed by persons experiencing homelessness in Hollywood are fentanyl and methamphetamine.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFentanyl\n\nTwo articles provide a good overview of the scope of the fentanyl problem. The first describes the difficulties in interdicting fentanyl because it is made from chemical precursors that are readily available. These efficiencies have radically driven down the price of fentanyl, the article quoting estimates of $5 to $10 a pill. Drug overdoses (primarily from fentanyl) are now the leading cause of death for persons under 50, accounting for roughly 110,000deaths in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. A significant reason for\n\nthe overdose problem is the small amount of fentanyl that can constitute a lethal dose, approximately 2 milligrams. One ounce of fentanyl contains about 28,000 lethal doses. This makes fentanyl 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin.\n\nâ\n\nThe second article is from a series that ran in the Los Angeles Daily News, detailing the extent of the fentanyl epidemic in nearby MacArthur Park. The articleâs statement that a fentanyl habit costs about $50 a day and requires four to five daily hits is broadly consistent with the cost estimate in the first article. The article vividly describes how the need to find money to support the habit can become an all consuming activity. As described in the article, a substance use disorder involving fentanyl appears inconsistent with any form of sustained employment.\n\nâ\n\nOne important distinction between fentanyl and methamphetamine is that there are medications for fentanyl that can replace the craving for fentanyl. Suboxone is perhaps the best known replacement medication. Consisting of a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, it is one of the main medications used to treat opioid addiction. Suboxone works by tightly binding to the same receptors in the brain as other opiates, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone. By doing so, it blunts intoxication with these other drugs, it prevents cravings, and it allows many people to transition back from a life of addiction to a life of normalcy and safety. Please read this Harvard magazine article for more information.\n\nMethamphetamine\n\nâ\n\nAs explained in this Atlantic article, there is a new form of methamphetamine (âmethâ) that is replacing the methamphetamine that existed a decade ago. The new method of making meth is called the P2P method and has reduced the price of meth by 90% and allowed it to be produced in previously unimaginable quantities. Even worse, the new meth appears to be producing much swifter and longer lasting symptoms of mental illness than the previous version. Typical symptoms are violent paranoia, hallucinations, conspiracy theories, isolation, massive memory loss, and jumbled speech. The article contains numerous interviews indicating that the amount of time required to return to normal mental activity after discontinuing meth use can range up to 18 months.\n\nâ\n\nSUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS PRIOR TO HOMELESSNESS\n\nâ\n\nIt has been correctly pointed out that knowing the incidence of substance use disorders among persons experiencing homelessness does not indicate the extent to which substance use disorders led to homelessness, since homelessness itself can be a significant factor leading to substance use disorders. Important data regarding this issue is provided in a recent study of homelessness by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California San Francisco, which has been described as the largest comprehensive study of homelessness in the UnitedStates since the mid-1990s.\n\nâ\n\nThe study concluded that âsubstance use disorders can increase vulnerability to homelessness.â13% of participants indicated their substance use was a reason for leaving their last housing. In the six months before homelessness, 29% used amphetamines, cocaine, or non-prescribed opioids regularly (at least three times per week). 24% reported heavy regular drinking. The report further found that 65% of the survey participants reported a period in their life when they regularly used non-prescribed amphetamines, cocaine, and non-prescribed opioids regularly and, of this group,64% reported having begun regular use prior to their first period of homelessness.\n\nâ\n\nCURRENT ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS AGAINST ILLICIT DRUG USE AND SALE IN HOLLYWOOD\n\nâ\n\nWhatever oneâs views with regard to the benefits of enforcing the laws regarding consumption and sale of illicit drugs, it appears important to understand the current state of law enforcement in Hollywood. This discussion only covers enforcement below the federal level since whatever efforts are occurring at the federal level are not occurring at the street level in Hollywood, but much higher up in the distribution chain.\n\nâ\n\nWith respect to possession and use, the Los Angeles Police Department is generally arresting no one for possession and use in Hollywood. It may certainly be argued that arresting someone is a very bad allocation of limited police resources. To begin with, it can be very time consuming. For example, at least at some point in 2023, the arresting protocol provided that, if the arrested person indicates that he or she has used drugs in the last 48 hours, the person must be taken to an emergency room at a hospital to determine whether he or she may be in the process of having an adverse drug reaction, which may add two or more hours to the arresting process.\n\nâ\n\nOnce the person is returned to the jail division, he or she is booked for a misdemeanor. There is a zero bail policy, so the person is immediately released. Finally, if the person does not show up for a hearing on the misdemeanor, no warrant is issued for his or her arrest.\n\nâ\n\nDrug sales are generally prosecuted by the Los Angeles District Attorney, not the LA City Attorney.At the present time our understanding is that the District Attorney has a general policy, at least inHollywood, of not prosecuting people arrested for selling street level quantities of drugs or holding them for sale, with the tragic exception of situations involving drug fatalities from overdoses. So, a police officer may use his or her discretion and conclude there is no point in arresting someone for selling drugs since they will not be prosecuted.\n\nâ\n\n(At a town hall meeting on 1/24/24 District Attorney Gascon indicated that felony prosecutions are being brought in Hollywood, and that he would send supporting data. As of 3/4/24, no new information had been received.)\n\nâ\n\nCURRENT AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT FOR PERSONS SEEKING TREATMENT IN HOLLYWOOD\n\nâ\n\nPerhaps the first thing to note is that there are many types of treatment for substance use disorders.While the most common image may be temporarily living in a facility as part of the treatment process, this is only one of many treatment options. Treatment for substance use disorders is provided by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, acting through its SubstanceAbuse Prevention and Control (SAPC) unit. SAPC publishes the Substance Use Disorder TreatmentServices Patient Handbook.\n\nâ\n\nIt divides available services in Los Angeles County into Outpatient Treatment Services, Intensive Outpatient Treatment Services, Residential/Inpatient Treatment Services, Withdrawal ManagementServices, Narcotic Treatment Program, Medications for Addiction Treatment, Peer Support Services,Care Coordination, and Contingency Management. The Patient Handbook provides additional information regarding these services.\n\nâ\n\nResidential Treatment is described in the Patient Handbook\n\nResidential Treatment is a non-institutional, 24-hour non-medical, short-term residential program that provides rehabilitation services to beneficiaries with a substance use disorder diagnosis when determined as medically necessary. The beneficiary shall live on the premises and shall be supported in their efforts to restore, maintain, apply interpersonal and independent living skills, and access community support systems.\n\nâ\n\nInpatient Treatment Services are described as:\n\nâ\n\nInpatient services are provided in a 24-hour setting that provides professionally directed evaluation, observation, medical monitoring, and addiction treatment in an inpatient setting.Most services are provided in person; however, tele-health and telephone may also be used\n\nto provide services while a person is in inpatient treatment. Inpatient services are highly structured, and a physician is likely available on-site 24 hours daily, along with RegisteredNurses, addiction counselors, and other clinical staff. Inpatient Services include assessment, care coordination, counseling, family therapy, medication services, Medications for AddictionTreatment for opioid use disorder, Medications for Addiction Treatment for Alcohol use disorder and other non-opioid substance use disorders, patient education, recovery services, and substance use disorder crisis intervention services.\n\nâ\n\nAs of November 2023, SAPC has indicated that, assuming a person experiencing homelessness wants residential treatment and is âready for treatment,â a facility can be found in Los AngelesCounty within a few days. âReadiness for treatmentâ is a key consideration. WithdrawalManagement services may be needed first. Medical conditions other than the substance use disorder may need to be addressed first. In particular, substance use disorders often co-occur with a serious mental illness, such as the psychoses that can often accompany methamphetamine addiction. In many cases the person experiencing homelessness will not be ready for treatment in one of these residential facilities until some improvement has occurred with respect to the serious mental illness. Finally, in some cases a lack of necessary documentation (such as proof of Medi-Cal eligibility) may be a barrier.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nEven if adequate facilities currently exist, this adequacy needs to be viewed in the light of the fact that most persons experiencing a substance use disorder are not seeking the treatment that would help them. SAPC estimates that 95% of the persons with a substance use disorder do not seek treatment.\n\nThis section lists the housing paths that may be taken by a person experiencing homelessness\n\nexiting Interim Housing. Interim Housing is not intended as a permanent solution. At some point in\n\ntime a person experiencing homelessness is expected to exit Interim Housing although, depending\n\non the other available options, a person experiencing homelessness may be allowed to stay\n\nindefinitely in Interim Housing. The available paths may be grouped as follows:\n\nâ\n\n1) RETURNING TO LIVING WITH RELATIVES/FRIENDS, ETC., LIVING ON THE STREETS, OR SAFE CAMPING OR SAFE PARKING\n\nâ\n\nWhile the paths listed in the heading of this subsection are undesirable (depending on its\n\npermanency, living with friends or relatives may be ok), the reality is that a very significant\n\npercentage of persons experiencing homelessness in Interim Housing end up in one of\n\nthese situations.\n\nâ\n\n2) TIME LIMITED SUBSIDIES\n\nâ\n\nThe mechanics of Time Limited Subsidies have already been described.\n\nâ\n\n3) REENTERING THE HOUSING MARKET WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SOME TYPE OF SUBSIDY\n\nâ\n\nWhile this is obviously a desirable outcome, only a limited number of persons experiencing\n\nhomelessness move directly from Interim Housing to permanent housing without some\n\nform of subsidy. The situations where this might occur could involve (1) financial assistance\n\nfrom friends or relatives that allows transition to normal housing or (2) situations where the\n\nhomelessness was occasioned by a mental health, physical health, or substance use disorder\n\nissue that the person experiencing homelessness has been able to overcome.\n\nâ\n\n4) PERMANENT BELOW-MARKET HOUSING FOR PERSONS NOT SUBJECT TO DISABILITY\n\nâ\n\nAs will be seen in in the next section (5), Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) is only\n\navailable to persons with a permanent or long-lasting disability. There is an extremely\n\nlimited supply of below-market housing available in Los Angeles for a person experiencing\n\nhomelessness who is not disabled but earns significantly below the median level of income.\n\nSo, while this option should be listed as a possible outcome, it is usually not available for persons experiencing homelessness who donât have a disability. There are various types of\n\nbelow-market housing available in Los Angeles:\n\nâ\n\nFederal Section 8 housing vouchers. There is a long waiting list to get these vouchers, which are used to pay a portion of the market rate rent otherwise due at an apartment.\n\nPublic Housing. As the name applies, in this case the apartment units are owned by a nonprofit or public entity that rents them out to low-income occupants at below-market rental levels. Some public housing is limited to specific types of renters, for example, HUD provides section 202 housing for persons over age 62.\n\nAffordable apartments units in apartment buildings that otherwise have market rate rentals. Los Angeles developers can sometimes save money by building taller and denser buildings under the cityâs two inclusionary housing programs â âTransit Oriented Communitiesâ and âdensity bonusâ â if they agree to reserve some of their units for people who earn below a certain level of income.\n\nPersons experiencing homelessness do not have any priority with respect to below-market\n\nhousing in these situations.\n\nâ\n\n5) PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING\n\nâ\n\nReferences to PSH sometimes suggest that permanent supportive housing is the long-term\n\nsolution to homelessness. While it is a critical component of any solution, it can be only\n\na partial solution since it is only available to persons experiencing homelessness with a\n\ndisability. Nevertheless, since it is believed that a significant percentage of the persons\n\nexperiencing homelessness in Hollywood would qualify for permanent supportive housing, it\n\nplays an important role. There is a lengthy waiting list for any future units that may become\n\navailable and persons with a higher degree of vulnerability are supposed to get higher\n\npreference on the list. (Although living in Hollywood does not necessarily mean that the\n\nhousing placement will be in Hollywood). The General Rules apply.\n\nâ\n\nFederal rules define a âhomeless individual with a disabilityâ to include persons experiencing\n\nhomelessness with a disability that is:\n\nâ\n\nExpected to be long-continuing or of indefinite duration,\n\nSubstantially impedes the individualâs ability to live independently,\n\nCould be improved by the provision of more suitable housing provisions,\n\nA physical, mental, or emotional impairment, including an impairment caused by alcohol or drug abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, or brain injury.\n\nâ\n\nIn addition, âdisabilityâ includes âdevelopmental disabilitiesâ and AIDS and certain\n\nrelated conditions.\n\nâ\n\nAs may be seen from the definition, the disability in question must be both (1) long\n\ncontinuing or of indefinite duration and (2) substantially impede the individualâs ability to live\n\nindependently. Obviously, lack of financial resources would not qualify. Nor is it expected that\n\nall substance use disorders would qualify, since at least some persons are expected to be\n\nable to overcome this issue. It is our understanding that the most common form of disability\n\nis some form of serious mental illness, though the definition obviously would include\n\ndisabling physical handicaps, such as forms of advanced diabetes, end stage renal disease,\n\netc. It will not include disabling conditions that require nursing assistance and similar types\n\nof intervention.\n\nâ\n\nPermanent supportive housing can either consist of dedicated housing or the placement\n\nof the disabled person in an apartment unit that is more generally available. In either case,\n\nthe apartment units are generally constructed the same as typical apartment units, with\n\nexceptions in the case of apartment units intended for persons with a particular physical\n\ndisability (for example, hearing or vision disabilities). While permanent supportive housing is\n\nsubsidized, it is generally expected that recipients pay some portion of their income toward\n\nrent, even if that income is only LA County general relief funds (around $221 a month in 2023).\n\nâ\n\nConsistent with the need for supportive services, the person experiencing homelessness has\n\na continuing case manager to assist him or her going forward. Case management services\n\nare typically available on site in the case of dedicated facilities. The case manager plays an\n\nimportant role in enabling the person experiencing homelessness to function successfully.\n\nHe or she is more of a navigator than the provider of specific mental health/substance abuse\n\nor other services. Some of the services provided by the case manager might include:\n\nâ\n\nHelping the person experiencing homelessness fulfill rent obligations by reminding them to pay, helping them apply to continue subsidies, etc.\n\nArranging transportation for the person experiencing homelessness for medical and other appointments\n\nHelping the person experiencing homelessness maintain the housing in an acceptable condition (persons experiencing homelessness may have come recently from the streets, so the case manager can be very important in enabling them to comply with the cleanliness rules of the project)\n\nHelping the person experiencing homelessness with dietary needs, such as choosing appropriate meals\n\nHelping the person experiencing homelessness schedule meaningful social and related activities.\n\nâ\n\nA typical case manager load might be around 20 clients.\n\nâ\n\nIt should be noted that, even in the case of dedicated housing, not all units are limited\n\nto persons experiencing homelessness with a disability. The diversity of populations is\n\nindicated by the different descriptions found with respect to three permanent supportive\n\nhousing facilities:\n\nâ\n\nOne site says 38 units are set aside for persons experiencing homelessness and/or are living with a qualifying disability. Ten units are set aside for individuals who earn 60% or below average median income.\n\nAnother site says its units are for individuals who are persons experiencing homelessness or at-risk of homelessness, and to homeless individuals and families in which at least one adult has a disability.\n\nA third site says it provides affordable and permanent supportive apartments.\n\nâ\n\n6) BOARD AND CARE HOMES\n\nBoard and care homes are another form of housing available for people who are challenged with a serious mental illness or another disability, who might find it difficult to live in the quasi-independence associated with permanent supportive housing. Technically, two types of facilities licensed by California are encompassed within the general term âboard and care homeâââadult residential facilitiesâ (ARFs) and âresidential care facilities for the elderlyâ(RCFEs).e.\n\nThe board and care home is generally a privately-operated residential facility ranging from five or six beds to a larger building with > 100 beds. People generally live two to a room and share a bathroom and common areas.\n\nâ\n\nThe definitions of the two types of facilities are similar with the critical difference that RCFEs are limited to persons 60 and older. The CA Care Association describes the two types of facilities as follows:\n\nâ\n\nâAn [ARF] is a facility that offers 24-hour care to adults who do not need medical attention. ARFs typically offer a home-like environment in which residents can live while receiving personal care services such as assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, and medication administration.\n\nIn addition, they may provide housekeeping, laundry, transportation, and recreational activities. ARFs are intended to serve adults ages 18-59 with a wide range of needs, including those with developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, or mental health conditions. ARFs are state-licensed facilities staffed by trained caregivers who can provide basic medical care.\n\nâ[An RCFE] is a non-medical facility that provides services for elderly individuals who do not require medical attention, but are unable to live independently. People aged 60 and up are served by [RCFEs]. They provide room and board, as well as housekeeping, supervision, and personal care assistance with activities such as personal hygiene, dressing, eating, and walking. Medication is typically stored and distributed centrally for residents to self-administer. They also provide social activities where seniors can enjoy the company of each other. RCFEs are intended to promote independence and self-direction as much as possible in a residential setting. They provide many planned social and recreational activities for the elderly to enjoy.â\n\nâ\n\nBoard and care homes provide a critical source of housing for people leaving psychiatric hospitals or locked facilities, placed under conservatorship, or re-entering the community after incarcerations. Rarely does someone enter the board and care environment directly from the street, though it is believed that many people living in ARFs have experienced homelessness in their past.\n\nThe state, county and city have become quite aware of the growing shortage of board and care beds in the community, owing to the funding model that is tied to residents paying rent from their social security benefits income. The city of Los Angeles released a report in February 2022 indicating that the city has a total of 180 facilities providing 6,717 beds. Between January 2020 and February 2021, the city lost 369 board and care beds. The situation throughout the county is even more significant. Some would suggest that the continuing loss of these types of beds for people with a serious mental illness is contributing to the increase in persons experiencing homelessness struggling even more with their mental illness.\n\nThe Future Organization recently issued a comprehensive report on Los Angeles County ARFs and RCFEs. It has numerous significant findings: of the 3065 licensed board and cares in Los Angeles County, 750 facilities (representing 25,000 beds) are currently serving or willing to serve people reliant on public benefits for their room, board, and care, people living with mental illness, and people with evidence of homelessness (one reason for the apparent discrepancy between this data and the City of Los Angeles data is that this study counted facilities that said they were available for this population, even if they are not currently serving them); 26% of the resident bed capacity was vacant or underutilized with the majority being located in RCFEs; and there is a need for a single government agency to provide consistent information about service capabilities and utilization rate for the available board and cares.\n\n7) PROJECT HOMEKEY\n\nâ\n\nThe Homekey Initiative (âHomekeyâ) has an important role to play in providing PSH shelter, which warrants description under this heading. Homekey takes funds provided by the State ofCalifornia to purchase hotels and apartment buildings, which are then used for both interim and permanent supportive housing for persons experiencing homelessness.\n\nHomekey is a major source of funds for persons experiencing homelessness housing. For example, in January 2022 the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles voted to spend around $500 million of state and local funds under Homekey to buy 16 different properties totaling 1,276 residential units, including one site in the Hollywood area.\n\nHomekey continues to be a robust funding source. In November 2023 California announced $154 million in new funding under Homekey, which includes several projects in the City of LosAngeles, including one on Hollywood Blvd.\n\nCHILDREN/TRANSITION AGE YOUTH (TAY) FROM 18-24/LGBTQIA+\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAssistance League Los Angeles: https://www.assistanceleaguela.org\n\nFrom preschool to providing school clothes and supplies, to resources for newborns and\n\nfoster children and their families, Assistance League of Los Angelesâ members dedicate\n\nthemselves to working to make sure that every child has a chance no matter\n\ntheir circumstances.\n\nâ\n\nAviva Family and Childrenâs Services: aviva.org\n\nâ\n\nAviva nurtures and supports at-risk families and children.
