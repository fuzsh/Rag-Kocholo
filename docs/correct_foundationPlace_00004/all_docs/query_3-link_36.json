Increase Revenue. • John Girard CEO, Clickability • Tom Cignarella VP, Technical Operations, Clickability Answers transcribed directly from December 16, 2008 webinar.\n\n2. Q: Can a SaaS-based approach to managing web content increase a company’s efficiency and save money? Answer by John Girard: • Clickability’s unique combination of Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides customers with unparalleled opportunities for consolidation, efficiency, and cost savings • Clickability allows you to get out of the hardware and software business • You pay only for what you use and can easily scale your service up or down depending on demand • Our platform allows you to significantly minimize your brick and mortar expenses, consolidate your business processes, and redeploy headcount to increase efficiency • Our customers are able to dramatically lower their total cost of ownership by: • Shifting Web budget from capital to operating expense (no front-loaded expenditure, dollar for dollar deduction in fiscal year rather than depreciation over time) • Better anticipating costs • Consolidate vendors • Decrease IT dependency and IT spend • Eliminate upgrade expense and pain • Enjoy industry-leading SLAs • The results of making this switch can be enormous: • Clickability adopters anticipate minimum WCM cost reduction between 35% and 50% • Long term customers have routinely increased publishing volumes and site traffic by a minimum of 75% within the first year CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n3. Q: SaaS can save money, but can it also increase revenue? Answer by John Girard: • A SaaS based model frees up your IT staff to focus on supporting the core publishing/broadcasting activities that drive value for your company, not just maintaining the website • We allow you to dedicate staff to developing strategic innovations that set your company apart from competitors • We provide you with easy to use tools and real time analytics you need to make rapid adjustments to the site that can increase traffic, page views, time spent on site, etc. • We give you granular control over the number of impressions per ad as well as the ability to rotate multiple ads through one spot, keyed to daily traffic patterns • We also help you speed time to market with new content, products, and services • Deployment of a new site takes weeks, not years • 12-16 weeks to implement • Again, the results speak for themselves: • Clickability customers have experienced 10% year over year increase in revenues, Q3 this year alone • You can also see Web traffic increases up to 2000% in the first year • 2theadvocate.com reported a 325% increase in site traffic, 250% increase in page views per visit, and 150% increase in ad space – all within the first 18 months on the platform • 2theadvocate.com also reported 120% year over year increase in ad revenues and a 100% growth in ad revenues for traditional “neglected” sections like entertainment and features CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n4. Q: Does that mean you have to give up a lot of control with a hosted solution? Will a SaaS approach inhibit a company’s ability to innovate? Answer by John Girard: • No, Clickability is not just an application, it’s a platform for innovation • We deploy Agile programming techniques to drive rapid innovation on the site • New features and functionality every 7 weeks lets customers evolve at Web speed • Our Agile development model produced one new item per day in 2008 • Compare this to the 3+ year development cycle of many on premise WCM solutions • We also give you the tools and the community you need to create new features and applications on your own – rapidly and cost effectively • Velocity training, shared code and our active community help customers innovate on top of platform • Clickability provides a superior platform for innovation than home grown or open source solutions • With open source, unless you have a commercial license, your innovations can become part of the public domain, limiting your ability to compete • Open source can be fast and cheap for small simple implementations, but it can be slow and costly for larger implementations – documentation is spotty, UIs are often poor • With Open source, code branching can leave a quasi-proprietary application stranded in a backwater, isolated from the community and ineligible for support • Clickability uses open source resources as building blocks, not the core application • Having control is great provided you use that control wisely. Content management is not a core business for most organizations and having full access to the source code may encourage companies to dedicate too much time to excessive customization and ongoing maintenance and too little time on using the tools they already have to grow revenue, increase efficiencies and explore new business opportunities. CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n5. Q: We’ve all been hearing a lot about “cloud computing” recently. Is SaaS the same as cloud computing and what is the difference between a hosted SaaS solution and an ASP approach? Answer by John Girard: • Cloud Computing, which includes SaaS as well as utility computing, grid computing, and other Internet-based approaches, is generating interest among IT professionals • Almost 1/3 of participants in a recent CIO magazine survey are already implementing some sort of Cloud Computing into their IT strategy, while an additional 1/3 are considering implementing a Cloud initiative within the next 3 years • 84% are using Cloud Computing to run applications using the SaaS model • Many companies claiming to provide a SaaS based approach are really just the same old traditional software providers masquerading as cloud computing innovators • The Application Service Provider (ASP) model is based on an outdated approach to hosted solutions • Essentially, ASPs simply transfer a customer's existing application sets into separate mini-data centers, each with its own infrastructure, upgrade path, and support requirements • Very often the ASP company must outsource the hosting to another vendor, which complicates deployment and adds cost • SaaS provider offers applications specifically designed to be hosted and delivered over the Internet to many customers • Because true SaaS platforms are multi-tenant, there are enormous cost savings and the pace of innovation is increased - When new features are introduced they are immediately available to everyone simultaneously CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n6. Q: Why should a company make the switch now? Why not just keep with the status quo until the financial crisis is over? Answer by John Girard: • Every day you are not on a SaaS based model for WCM you are losing money • Affordable proof-of-concept and low up-front costs means that you can easily and cost-effectively get on to the Platform • Costs are more predictable and transparent • You can reduce your risks significantly – Clickability provides Industry-standard security, excellent customer support and 99.9+% uptime • Gain access to a hosting infrastructure that only the biggest companies can afford to build and maintain on their own • 2 geo-dispersed data centers • Daily data backup • Seamless failover • Now is not the time to hide your head in the sand. You must rethink your assumptions and restructure for success. The media and corporate landscape is changing rapidly. Sticking to the status quo is not the answer. CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n7. What is the importance of fully redundant CMS platform? Answer by Tom Cignarella: • When a company is serious about its web presence they are going to expect that site to be up and performing all of the time. One of the reasons people choose Clickability is the fact that we have a fully redundant infrastructure. We have redundancy built into every layer of our platform up to and including running two data centers. • We are in the final stages of deploying our 2nd data center and some production services are already live there. The data center will be running our entire platform by mid-January. • Once this data center is fully running we will balance all of our customer traffic across both of them at the same time, and each data center is capable of handling 100% of our traffic requirements. This means we could have an entire data center fail and Clickability platform customers would be unaffected. • What has been interesting to see over the past few months is how many companies cannot achieve this on their own. We’ve talked to several Fortune 1000 companies that are running their web presence out of a single data center. If they attempt to have the level of redundancy that we can offer, the price to build out a second data center can be tremendous. CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n8. Q: Any feedback that you can share from customers and prospects about the recent infrastructure improvements? Answer by Tom Cignarella: • Absolutely, in some cases this is a deal maker for companies evaluating us. BMC, a Fortune 1000 technology company which is now in the process of moving to our platform would not have selected us had we not had this capability. Their company revenue depends on their site being available all of the time. CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n9. Q: Tell us a little about Security and Web CMS deployments Answer by Tom Cignarella: • In addition to being reliable we are also always asked about security. We take the security imperative just as seriously as availability. So let me try to answer some of the more common questions we hear on this topic: • How does Clickability secure customers’ data in a multi-tenant environment? • The Clickability platform was designed 8 years ago with the multi-tenant model in mind, it was never an afterthought or add-on. Due to the early commitment to this model the entire platform is designed to ensure data segregation. This is done via several methods: • At the data and object layer • At the user action layer • At the API layer • Throughout all application internals • How secure is the Clickability Platform? • Security requires constant vigilance, I like a quote I heard a long time ago that said “If you want something to be fully secure, then unplug it from the network”. • In today’s web world that is obviously not an option, so we make sure that we do all that we can to stay secure and we do this several ways following a security in depth motto: • All systems are built in a hardened fashion before they go live • There are firewalls at every layer of our network • Production access is strictly limited • Logging of all activity • Continuous security scanning of our hardware from inside and from outside of our network CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n10. Security and Web deployments, cont’d. • To further show our commitment to security we are now working on becoming SysTrust certified. • For those that have not heard of SysTrust before it is defined as • “The SysTrust service is an assurance service that was jointly developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). It is designed to increase the comfort of management, customers, and business partners with systems that support a business or particular activity” • Our focus is on the following 3 criteria: • Security • Availability • Confidentiality CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n11. Q: Industry analyst Gartner named cloud computing the number one technology trend for 2009. Many trade publications have expanded on this, pointing out the economic as well as the technological value of the cloud. What’s your take? Answer by Tom Cignarella: • Clickability as a technology company is as excited about the emergence of Cloud Computing as anyone else is. We strongly believe that it is changing the fundamental landscape of how IT will operate in the future. That said, like any IT solution it is not right for everyone in the same way but we are evaluating it in a few ways: • Today we host an application for our customers called FeedLoader and basically it is a standalone application that customers can use to feed data into our CMS via our API from another publishing system. For security reasons we do not host this in our own data centers. • We are now working to move instances of that application from a dedicated hosting provider to the suite of Amazon services • We are also looking at Cloud Storage options in our environment for certain types of data like logs • In the future we will also look at presenting our customers with options. An example would be when a user is uploading a piece of content like an image, they would be presented with the option of storing this content in different types of locations one of those being a Cloud Storage provider. CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY\n\n12. Q: As a veteran IT executive, what are the technology imperatives and pitfalls you see for the next 12 to 18 months? Answer by Tom Cignarella: • With today’s economic challenges for IT it’s like “what’s old is new again”. IT teams are going to come under increasing pressure to lower their costs and ensure their resources are focused on activities that are beneficial to the company. The answer to how to do that is never the same for any two companies and each has to evaluate where they can save the most so they can do more with less. • Clearly I think SaaS is a big part of that, Clickability as a company is not only a SaaS advocate because that is how we run our platform but we are also a SaaS consumer. ALL of the applications required to run our company (email, CRM, ticketing, finance, HR) are hosted with SaaS providers. In fact there is not a single IT application that we run in house.
