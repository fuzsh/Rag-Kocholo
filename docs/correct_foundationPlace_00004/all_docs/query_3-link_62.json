        "text": "Corza21 Said:\n\n\"I can’t click on certain parts of my screen on my MacBook Air.: There is a certain part of my screen that I just cannot click, it runs almost from the left to the right of the screen for a few centimetres right below where the search bar is on most browsers. I have tried using my Bluetooth mouse and a built in trackpad but the same issue occurs no matter what. It’s getting really annoying, I don’t know what to do.\"\n\n-------\n\nTroubleshooting Cursor and Screen Unresponsiveness:\n\nPerform the Following...\n\nA. Try Safe Mode:\n\nBoot in Safe Mode, and then see if you get the same error. In Safe Mode, Login Items do not run, and corrupt system files(i.e. caches) are intentionally reset as a way to fix issues.\n\nBoot: in to Safe Mode: [Hold Down: shift key upon boot].\n\nLog in: as same user\n\nWait: 30 seconds\n\nTry the cursor click.\n\nB. Remove Login Items:\n\nWhile in Safe Mode, remove all of your Login Items, and then restart the Mac. Go Here: Change Users & Groups Login Items Preferences on Mac - Apple Support\n\nC. Single-Out this User:\n\nFor troubleshooting purposes, create a new Administrator user. Log into it, and then see if you get this error. If not, then it is an error with the current user. If so, then it is an error with the entire macOS. Trash this user once this has been tried.\n\nD. Single-Out this User:\n\nFor troubleshooting purposes, create a new Administrator user. Log into it, and then see if you get this error. If not, then it is an error with the current user. If so, then it is an error with the entire macOS. Trash this user once this has been tried.\n\nIf nothing above works...\n\nE. Reinstall the macOS:\n\nNothing would be lost. It's just that misplaced items would be placed back to where they should be and corrupt system files would be replaced by clean files. Go Here: Reinstall macOS - Apple Support. Use the third bulleted method: [command + r]. To prevent data loss, be sure to back up your Mac with Time Machine, prior to the reinstall.\n\nI thought it was just me. It was driving crazy this weekend. I'll shut down chrome restart, and after awhile it would happen again. I even uninstalled chrome because I thought it was a bug. I downloaded brave and thought I was out of the woods until a few minutes ago. WTF! Like someone else here mentioned, if I take it out of full screen it works, even if I stretch the browser window to cover the screen. Yeah, this suuuper frustating. Has anyone gotten a response from apple? It's got to be happening everywhere. The funny thing is, I read somewhere that the update a little glitchy, but I figured hey, its apple they'll get it right before they release it. Boy, was I wrong!\n\nEDIT: Corza21 I just read that Leafy_205 suggested going to chrome://flags/#enable-gpu-rasterization and changing the dropdown for \"GPU Rasterization\" from \"Default\" to \"Enabled\". I have no idea what any of that means, but I changed the setting and restarted Chrome. The below problem is now fixed. Hope this helps!\n\nORIGINAL ISSUE: I have a Macbook Pro mid-2012 with the same issues, so it must not be related to the recent OS updates as mine can't update anymore. The issue clicking on the right side of the screen happens to me in Chrome while in full screen. But my keyboard can select those right-hand buttons using tab>enter. When I go out of full-screen mode, the right-hand side of my browser screen becomes responsive as normal again.\n\nI'm not aware of having recently updated Chrome, but maybe it did so automatically.\n\nIs this a Mac software/hardware issue, a Chrome software issue, or some weird combo?\n\nAnyone? Bueller?"
