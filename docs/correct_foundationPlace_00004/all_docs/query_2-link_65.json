        "text": "Chattanooga Water Heater Co. joined Plumbing Webmasters when their company was less than a year old.\n\nDespite that youth, the specialized plumbing company was equipped with an outstanding brand name.\n\nHowever, when Travis Mullis, owner of Chattanooga Water Heater Co (CWH), approached our plumbing SEO company several years ago, he had several challenges standing in his way to the top.\n\nFirst, Chattanooga Water Heater Co. was a brand new entry to the industry.\n\nNew businesses are always fun to work with because their owners don’t come with preconceptions about how marketing works.\n\nThey’re eager and willing to work hard. Travis certainly brought enthusiasm to the table.\n\nConversely, new companies start with zero brand recognition and search clout. Our team was building from scratch.\n\nCWH’s case was even more challenging.\n\nWater heater services are a specialized, highly competitive subindustry to enter.\n\nOur Plumber Marketing Challenges\n\nWe needed to employ extraordinary SEO tactics if Chattanooga Water Heater Co. was to challenge the existing power structure.\n\nGiven the small size of the business, we also started off with a tighter budget than many of our other clients.\n\nOur team needed to generate some results fairly quickly to maintain the client.\n\nIf you’ve read our SEO for Plumbers guide, you’ll know that search engine optimization is anything but fast.\n\nTo summarize our challenges:\n\nWe had a limited budget to work with.\n\nOur team needed to produce at least some results quickly.\n\nThe client brand had no existing recognition.\n\nWith our strategy and service, Chattanooga Water Heater Co. quickly ranked for local search results for some of the most powerful plumbing industry keywords.\n\nInitial Brand Development\n\nGMB Optimization\n\nFirst, we completed and optimized CWH’s Google My Business profile.\n\nThis free listing is a key ingredient for plumbers who desire more qualified clients within their service area, but few businesses optimize it to the fullest extent.\n\nThat’s a real shame, especially since so much of what we perceive as generalized search is becoming increasingly localized.\n\nWithout an activated, verified, and optimized GMB account, plumbers rarely get the prestigious map pack placements (which we eagerly wanted for Travis and his company).\n\nWe also got to work securing listings on other citation sources.\n\nOrganizations like Facebook Business and the Better Business Bureau don’t just provide supplementary reviews.\n\nThey also serve as signals to Google about the trustworthiness of your company.\n\nWebsite Construction\n\nAs we always say at the Webmasters, your plumbing company website is the foundation of digital marketing strategy.\n\nAlmost every other lead-generating channel springs from your website and/or feeds into it.\n\nWith Chattanooga Water Heater Co., our seasoned web designers focused on creating a healthy balance of user-friendliness and alluring visual style.\n\nThe end result was a refreshingly practical and easy-to-navigate website (seen below).\n\nThis Snapshot Conveys the Simple, Functional Design We Strove For For CWH.\n\nNotice the spacious design that draws the eye to the “free quote” call to action.\n\nThe simplistic menu also makes it easy to find the company’s dedicated service pages, which we’ll explore further.\n\nEach major service received its own category blocks with additional information (and clickability), making it even easier for consumers to locate their desired solutions.\n\nWe also included valuable information about brand product warranties and financing so consumers feel more comfortable making impulse calls from the home page.\n\nKeyword Rich Service Pages\n\nWhile some plumbing pros think the homepage does all the heavy lifting for local search, that’s actually not the case.\n\nService pages generate many of the high-quality leads coming into the website, which is why our team took such care crafting the content for CWH’s site.\n\nOur content writer on the account utilized a healthy, diversified serving of local primaries and secondary keywords.\n\nJust a quick reminder:\n\nPrimary keywords are typically shorter, general terms with high search volume and competition.\n\nSecondaries are longer, more specific terms with lower volume but higher search intent.\n\nBy utilizing both on the CWH site, we ensured a steady stream of leads through the secondary keywords while the primaries (which take longer to rank for) slowly matured.\n\nUnlike many other marketing agencies, however, we generate hundreds of keyword listings for even greater returns in local search.\n\nHowever, even our expectations were blown out of the water when Chattanooga Water Heater Co. started appearing in local map packs in less than two months.\n\nImagine Little Pins of Your Service Activities All Over Google Maps\n\nGeotagging for A+ Local SEO\n\nBy far, the most impactful element of our SEO work came from our DataPins software, which was conveniently built into CWH’s new website.\n\nThe software allows plumbers (and other contracting professionals) to pin job sites and generate automated review requests.\n\nDataPins generates a map pin on the website’s corresponding service page when a client checks in after a repair or installation.\n\nAnother pin appears every time a client submits a review through the application.\n\nThat may sound fancy, but what did this tool actually do for CWH?\n\nWith the Local Search Update, map results suddenly became much more fluid.\n\nNew businesses could suddenly bust into the premium map pack positions with the right optimization and local activity.\n\nThese map pins, tagged with our geotagging software, provide undeniable evidence that Chattanooga Water Heater Co. provides services throughout the city.\n\nEach pin contained information about the job performed, the general area services provided, and the date.\n\nAll this information is priceless to Google.\n\nIt proves CWH’s ongoing activity, meaning the company is a dependable choice to recommend to local consumers.\n\nGMB, Pins, and Reviews Heavily Influence Local Search Results.\n\nFast Forward\n\nTravis Mullis’ company jumped to the top of local search results less than two months after his site launched.\n\nBefore the Local Search Update, that rarely happened.\n\nSeveral years after their site launch, CWH continues to dominate map packs in his community, generating some enviable levels of monthly leads.\n\nYou can find his company in search through queries like:\n\n“water heater in Chattanooga”\n\n“water heater repair in Chattanooga”\n\n“water heater installation in Chattanooga”\n\n“tankless water heater Chattanooga”\n\nand many more high-dollar keywords!\n\nChattanooga Water Heater Co., a brand-new company, managed to snatch these rankings from established businesses with years of tenure in the local market.\n\nThanks to quality web design, extensive keyword research, professional content writing, and technical support from the development team, this fledgling business launched with very satisfying success.\n\nHowever, Travis Mullis’ dedication to completing check-ins and asking for reviews earned him the outrageous results we see today.\n\nWe look forward to seeing what other plumbing professionals can achieve with the DataPins system."
