We continuously strive to improve our features so that content can be accessed regardless of ability.\n\nText Size\n\nYou can adjust text size by utilizing the browser’s zoom feature.

Links that open in a new window will be indicated with a NE arrow ( ) to inform the user.\n\nWe also feature large touch targets on buttons and links for easier clickability.\n\nDownloads\n\nWe use PDF files to preserve the look of original documents. To open and view PDF files, download the latest free version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. Acrobat also publishes information on accessing PDF documents using screen readers. To open and view ZIP files, download the latest extraction software from Corel. The software allows ZIP files to be uncompressed so that contents can be viewed.\n\nJavaScript\n\nOur website is optimized for use with JavaScript enabled.
