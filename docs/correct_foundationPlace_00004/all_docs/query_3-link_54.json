So, define a data frame while creating selected_county_data() object and keep only the state(s) available in the df object. Also, in output$map keep in temp only the states in df. Then, use updatePickerInput to display the counties clicked on the map.\n\nLastly, if Rate is 0, it is hard to see where the selected county is since you are using fillColor = ~pal(Rate). So, I have defined it as 33 (arbitrary number). You can define it as you wish.\n\nTry this."
