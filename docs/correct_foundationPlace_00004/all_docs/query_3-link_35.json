        "text": "Put your clickable text on a button. Make it look 3D with some simple highlights and shadows, like Windows 3.x or 9x. If there's one thing Microsoft did well in 1990s versions of Windows, it was making things look like they could be clicked.\n\nJust look at how those buttons on Windows 3.11 scream \"Click me!\" Also note the disabled button in the File Manager window. Its lack of highlights and being greyed out makes it clear that it can't be clicked right now.\n\nYou'll probably need to go a bit thicker than the one or two-pixel-wide highlights and shadows used in those old versions of Windows, given modern display resolutions, but the principle will still work just fine. You can even make the button look like it's been pressed in while the button is held down by just swapping the colours of the highlight and shadow.\n\nFor a suggestion that you'll get a new screen when you click the button, you could put \">>\" at the end of the text. It, or something similar, is pretty common in installer programs, after all.\n\nThese are some good experiments, but none of them read quite as expected.\n\nHave you tried turning these into cards, rather than text links? This would improve their prominence on the screen, and more clearly delineate from the non-clickable text.\n\nAnother option is classic underline or \"hyperlink blue\" font-color, which are easily understood. With these, you could keep your \"locked\" styling, and simply add an underline to the clickable text or change the color.\n\nLinks inherently imply a new flow, or at least a branching spot - either of these options should get you what you're looking for, and can be verified further via user testing.\n\nHere's some additional options you may not have explored yet: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/clickable-elements/"
