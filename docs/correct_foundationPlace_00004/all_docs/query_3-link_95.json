She is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\n\nOverview\n\nD.Va’s mech is nimble and powerful — its twin Fusion Cannons blast away with autofire at short range, and she can use its Boosters to barrel over enemies and obstacles, or absorb attacks with her projectile-destroying Defense Matrix.\n\nAbilities\n\nHero-specific options\n\nSetting name Options Description Toggle Defense Matrix Off (default) Defense Matrix deactivates when player stops holding the button.

With very high health and Boosters, she can close a gap to the enemy with ease. She has high damage output at close-range, making her a strong fighter in a 1-on-1 match. Her Defense Matrix is useful against all incoming projectiles regardless of DPS, protecting her teammates from enemy fire. The Micro Missiles deal high amount of damage when used in close range. She is a dangerous flanker in the Tank class, dealing consistent damage to the enemy. Self-Destruct will wipe all opponents within the blast area. However, she doesn't have an extended barrier to properly protect her team like Reinhardt. She is also slow while firing, allowing the enemy to outrun her to disengage or move around her to distract her aiming. Both Fusion Cannons and Micro Missiles are ineffective against anything further than medium-range, meaning she can be outranged by the enemy before she even has a chance to close a gap with Boosters.\n\nWeapons & Abilities\n\nFusion Cannons: D.Va's main weapons on the mech. Her mech can fire consistent shotgun-like bullets onto the targeted point. She can rapidly fire her bullets without needing to reload, but suffers from slow movement while firing.\n\nWhile firing her Fusion Cannons, D.Va's movement speed is reduced by 40%, down to 3.3 m/s.\n\nFusion Cannons have 11 bullets per shot and large spreading; position yourself to the closest of the targets so that they won't be able to escape from you while firing.\n\nAiming for the upper-body is recommended due to the nature of spread in combination with infinite ammo.\n\nSpraying the bullets at mid-to-long range has little to no effect, but it can pressure the enemy and sometimes interrupt some certain abilities when hit, like supports' self-healing passive and Sombra's Stealth.\n\nThe Light Gun does not have damage falloff, and is actually more effective than the Fusion Cannons at long range.\n\nDefense Matrix: D.Va's primary defensive ability. When activated, the targeting-array will pop up from the front of her mech, reaching up to 10 meters away. All incoming projectiles will be shot down mid-air when they come into range of this ability. D.Va cannot attack with her Fusion Cannons while using it.\n\nWhile Defense Matrix has infinite \"health\" and can block any number of projectiles, it only lasts for 3 seconds when used continuously, and requires 1 second before beginning a recharge, which takes 6 seconds until it is fully recharged. Try to use it as a quick-burst protection instead of as a main blocking tool like the barriers of Reinhardt or Sigma.\n\nIf some hero rushes into a group of enemies, use Defense Matrix to cover your allies when needed. For example, cover Winston when he jumps in or cover Pharah when she is using her ultimate. You can protect your teammates with Defense Matrix without needing to be right next to them thanks to its long range. Keep its short duration in mind; try not to spend all of its charge and leaving yourself as the enemy's main target.\n\nDefense Matrix only blocks fire from the front, and cannot negate incoming projectiles from other directions, making it ineffective against flankers and less viable when used as a barrier to protect her team or herself.\n\nKeep playing a mind game; try to lure some heroes like Zarya or Mei into thinking that you have run out of Defense Matrix so that you can use it to block their Ultimate. D.Va's Defense Matrix is very useful to erase a powerful ultimate if timed properly.\n\nWhen retreating from a group of enemies, activating Defense Matrix while moving backward will greatly help D.Va to survive a strong attack.\n\nBoosters: When activated, D.Va's mech will launch into the air. She will move forward with faster movement speed and be able to adjust her momentum for 2 seconds. Deals damage and knockback to enemies when collided with. Fusion Cannons are available to use during Boosters.\n\nThe cooldown triggers after the Boosters ability ends.\n\nDespite its small damage, it can still be used with a melee combo to guarantee a strong knockback and decent damage dealt.\n\nUsing Boosters in combination with Fusion Cannons can guarantee a kill on injured enemies who are trying to retreat.\n\nD.Va can activate Defense Matrix during the flight to protect herself from enemy fire.\n\nBoosters can be stopped mid-use by a melee attack or Boosters' key again.\n\nMicro Missiles: When activated, D.Va's mech will launch a volley of missiles after a short cast time. The missiles will travel in a straight line and hit the first solid target. The ability can be activated in all actions and can't be stopped until D.Va is stunned or the mech is destroyed. The missiles can damage the D.Va who fired them.\n\nCombining the ability with primary fire can ensure a kill on an isolated enemy. It is less effective when used on a group of enemies, but still provides a strong pressure and enough damage to gain a great amount of ultimate charge.\n\nSince it can be activated at any time, consider using it when Defense Matrix is activated. This will render the enemy's attack useless and hurt them with a bunch of missiles.\n\nTry not to waste the ability on a hero with a stun attack, since a stun effect can interrupt the missiles immediately.\n\nIt's better not to use missiles apart from close range. The missiles travel at a slow speed and only deal small damage upon impact. Additionally, the enemy team can easily see it coming from afar and walk a step back to dodge it.\n\nSelf-Destruct: (Ultimate): The ultimate of D.Va's mech. D.Va will eject from her mech, which will detonate after 3 seconds. It deals massive damage upon explosion in a very large area around it.\n\nThe mech will receive any momentum from Boosters if they were used prior to activating Self-Destruct. Use this to launch it in the right direction, and even to stall its travel around corners and catch enemies by surprise.\n\nThe blast creates a strong knockback effect on any opponents that survive, sometimes launching them into a pit or off a cliff.\n\nAny cover will block the damage from Self-Destruct entirely; even a light post that is large enough to cover the hero's size will allow them to survive the blast.\n\nSucceeding in using Self-Destruct's explosion will fully charge D.Va's Call Mech ability. However, if your mech is blown off a cliff while the countdown is still going, you will not gain any ultimate charge.\n\nAfter her mech takes critical damage, there is a brief window between the damage being taken and her ejecting from the cockpit where an ultimate can be used to cause the mech to detonate rather than simply being destroyed. This will also give her a full Call Mech ultimate charge.\n\nLight Gun: D.Va's main weapon after her mech is destroyed. The Light Gun deals considerable damage with fast (but not hitscan) projectile bullets.\n\nThe weapon is very accurate at most ranges. D.Va can use while kiteing enemies and charge her ultimate meter to call a new mech.\n\nWith her small hitbox, D.Va can dance around and kite the enemy, using the weapon's projectile nature to cut off the enemy's escape routes. Keep in mind that you have low survivability and lack movement options in pilot form, though.\n\nThe Light Gun does not have damage falloff, and is actually more effective than the Fusion Cannons at long range.\n\nCall Mech: (Ultimate): D.Va can call a new mech after her previous one is destroyed.\n\nThe mech will deal considerable damage around it upon impact, killing any low health character. However, you must make sure that you can safely return to the mech.\n\nThe ability creates a strong knockback upon cast. It can launch the enemy to an environmental kill.\n\nBoth D.Va and her mech can be damaged or killed while she is entering the mech.\n\nWhen not fully operating the mech, any damage being dealt to you will not transfer to ultimate charge for your enemies.\n\nGeneral Strategies\n\nWhile D.Va is considered a Tank, a lot of successful D.Va players use her like Reaper. Flanking and harassing are some of D.Va's strong suits. Her high damage output at close range coupled with her Boosters movement ability makes it easy for her to get \"shotgun-like\" damage in and escape with ease.\n\nDefense Matrix is especially strong against most damage dealers. It can even negate a dangerous bullet from Cassidy's Deadeye or even Pharah's Barrage.\n\nYou can close the gap on most heroes with Boosters, but you will be susceptible to enemy fire while airborne. Defense Matrix can be used during Boosters, so activate it while flying towards a target that's shooting at you.\n\nYou need to prioritize protecting the team from flankers and snipers, potentially by rushing them down at close range. Snipers are your first target since they are vulnerable at close range followed by other damage dealers depending on the situation and their position.\n\nStrategize where and when to place a Self-Destructing mech. The 3 seconds countdown of Self-Destruct is long enough for your enemies to find cover or get behind a friendly Barrier. One effective tool is to use Boosters before Self-Destruct to send the Ultimate out from a blind spot towards a place where there is less cover.\n\nD.Va's high damage in her mech is useful against Tanks. Due to their large size and slow speed, the burst damage of Micro Missiles and Fusion Cannons can chew through a lot of health.\n\nEven though Defense Matrix will destroy all projectiles, it will not absorb beams such as Zarya's Particle Cannon, Mei's Endothermic Blaster, Moira's Biotic Grasp, or Symmetra's Photon Projector.\n\nD.Va has a large critbox in front of her mech (the cockpit). You will receive critical damage easier than most heroes, so avoid turning your mech to face oncoming fire without Defense Matrix active.\n\nRamming an enemy with Boosters deals damage in addition to mild knockback, which may be enough to finish off a low-health opponent.\n\nIf you melee attack an enemy player while D.Va's Boosters are active, you will deal greatly increased damage and knockback to the target, allowing easy environmental kills.\n\nWhen out of the suit, D.Va's primary goal is to score as many headshots as possible, as fast as possible, to call her next mech. You may want to target a distant, large enemy such as Roadhog or an enemy D.Va to regain your ultimate charge.\n\nMatch-Ups and Team Synergy\n\nTank\n\nHero Match-Up Team Synergy\n\nD.Va D.Va mirror matches are extremely bizarre. Both of you are going to try to act smart and fight around each others' Defense Matrix. Don't use too much of your Defense Matrix at any point, so that you are always able to counter the opponent's Micro Missiles and Fusion Cannons should they use them, and simultaneously try not to fire your Micro Missiles until you're sure your opponent has crossed this threshold. If your opponent is blocking your attacks, do not stop firing. Your ammo is infinite; her Defense Matrix is not. Eventually her Defense Matrix will drop, and she will be completely out of luck, especially if your teammates show up to join the fight. While they block your shots with Defense Matrix, get in close and use melee attacks to put in damage. Generally speaking, though, it's a bad idea to fight with another D.Va unless you're certain she has low health. She might not kill you, but she'll waste a lot of your time that should be spent helping your team, so it's better to retreat and have her either disengage or chase you back to meet your team and a gruesome end. If the other D.Va loses her mech, just activate Defense Matrix while she fires her gun, because now she has to reload while you don't. As soon as she starts reloading, start shooting. A few unblocked shots will make you lose your Mech if you're not careful - a Pilot D.Va can take you out with 25 headshots, or in 5.02 seconds, but play it right and you can take her out. If you lose your mech first, try to disengage. Backpedal and continue firing, trying to regroup with your team. If she activates Defense Matrix, stop firing and reload; this will make her drop her Defense Matrix, but by then you'll have reloaded and you can fire again. D.Va has no notable team synergy with another D.Va.\n\nDoomfist Defense Matrix can only negate Doomfist's primary fire, and his consistent stunning moves can make escaping him excessively difficult. Choosing to fight him head-on alone will also end badly, as his ability to generate overhealth means he'll usually be able to outlast you until your Mech is destroyed, at which point you're as good as gone. Keep your distance, and only engage when you have teammates to help you or if he's already nearly dead. Be careful with using Defense Matrix when a friendly Doomfist is using Power Block, as he may be looking to absorb damage to empower his Rocket Punch.\n\nJunker Queen With no barriers to block your attacks, fighting Junker Queen is a breath of fresh air compared to other Tanks. That being said, Defense Matrix can only block Junker Queen's Scattergun and a thrown Jagged Blade, whereas you and your team are still vulnerable to Carnage. With smart usage of Boosters, though, you should typically be able to avoid Carnage thanks to its long wind-up time. One minor issue when fighting Junker Queen is Commanding Shout being able to save herself or her nearby teammates when they're near death. When hit by Rampage, it's best to retreat, since Adrenaline Rush combined with Rampage's wound damage will mean that you're more likely to lose your Mech before you can finish Junker Queen off. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Junker Queen.\n\nOrisa Orisa can use Javelin Spin to block your Micro Missiles, and thanks to Fortify, quickly gunning Orisa down can prove to be difficult. However, your Defense Matrix can absorb her primary fire, making most fights with her come down to a standstill. While Defense Matrix can also block Orisa's Energy Javelin, it can be hard to predict. If fighting in an area with pits, don't use your Boosters too frequently, as Orisa can push you in with Energy Javelin and Javelin Spin, and you'll want to be able to quickly fly out. Thanks to the low cooldown of Javelin Spin, Orisa will often be shoving you around to places you don't want to be and denying you your Boosters, so try to keep your distance from her to avoid this. When Orisa uses her ultimate, Terra Surge, try to quickly get out using Boosters. Orisa cannot block Self-Destruct for her team, but she can survive it with Fortify, so try to time it accordingly if possible. A sturdy Orisa as your teammate frees you up to play as a more aggressive Tank. With that in mind, don't leave her to fend for herself; once you've picked off any flankers or lone enemies, try to stay by your Orisa to make sure she isn't ambushed, since she's not as handy as you are in a close range fight.\n\nRamattra Ramattra is one of the more difficult Tanks for D.Va to deal with. When in Omnic Form, he can spam his Void Accelerator at you from a distance, and while you can easily block it with Defense Matrix, Defense Matrix's maximum duration is only so long, whereas Void Accelerator's lack of damage falloff and large ammo capacity means that blocking it is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. If you close the distance on him, Ramattra can activate Nemesis Form, which is even worse; his Pummel strikes can't be blocked by Defense Matrix, and with each punch dealing 60 damage, it won't be long before you lose your Mech. Void Barrier can stop you from landing good hits on him and his team, and even if you maneuver around it, you'll just end up in the close range of his Nemesis Form. All in all, there's very little you can do against an enemy Ramattra beyond play with the hand you've been dealt; block Void Accelerator when possible, but more often it's better to use terrain as cover. Pelt him from medium range with your Fusion Cannons, and when he enters Nemesis Form, either retreat or try to focus on weak teammates that he is no longer able to protect without his Void Barrier. During Annihilation, unless Ramattra is already near-death, it's best to run rather than fight, as the combination of his Ultimate and his Pummel strikes will not only cause you to quickly lose your Mech, but will only cause Annihilation to last even longer to rip through the rest of your team. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Ramattra.\n\nReinhardt Your quick mobility, ramming potential, and burst-fire capabilities allow you to chase down a lone Reinhardt and quickly finish him off. Conversely, if Reinhardt is chasing after you, fly away and he will be incapable of catching up. Using Boosters to fly into Reinhardt can also distract him just enough for your team to advance and attack his teammates, whom he is no longer protecting. However, be wary that Reinhardt can block your Self-Destruct with his barrier. It is therefore best to save Self-Destruct until the opposing Reinhardt is dead, his barrier is shattered, or an ally is able to disrupt him and force him to drop his barrier. As D.Va lacks any capability to produce shields, a friendly Reinhardt can cover your role as a primary Tank while you block large-impact attacks and chase after enemies Reinhardt is incapable of pursuing. The stun of Earthshatter is an excellent setup to safely perform a team-wipe with Self-Destruct.\n\nRoadhog Roadhog fights are extremely unfortunate, because your Defense Matrix does not stop his Chain Hook. If you get hooked, do not start fighting back. Instead, immediately hit your Boosters, turn around, and fly back to your team. Chances are you'll survive the encounter, but if you play by his game and fight him after being hooked, he can potentially destroy your mech in two shots if he gets a headshot. Even if he misses the hook and you're in a 1 on 1 situation, his self-heal from Take a Breather will allow him to outlast you, and eventually you'll lose your mech, at which point you're easy pickings. While you aren't much help against Roadhog in a 1 on 1 fight, you're much more helpful in a group fight. When your allies are hooked by Roadhog, quickly boosting in and activating Defense Matrix can save them from a grizzly end. This will require quick reaction time, so when the opponent has a Roadhog and you're entering a group-fight, you should always have Boosters and Defense Matrix at the ready. When out of your mech, only fight Roadhog at extremely safe range while using cover. If you get in his hook's range, he will grab you and end you, but if you keep your distance, he can't do anything but soak up damage while you quickly build back up your Call Mech Ultimate. Teaming up a D.Va and Roadhog will result in your team lacking heavily in protection. However, among the Tanks, D.Va and Roadhog are also arguably the most offensively powerful. With the right team comp that focuses more on barreling through an enemy line rather than slowly pushing and protecting your team, you can pick off key targets while your Damage allies finish off any stragglers.\n\nSigma Sigma's Kinetic Grasp is very similar to your own Defense Matrix; the main differences between the two is that Kinetic Grasp has a lengthy cooldown compared to your rechargeable meter and that projectiles absorbed by Kinetic Grasp are converted to overhealth for the enemy Sigma. When Sigma has Kinetic Grasp active, be careful not to use your Micro Missiles or fire at him; instead, charge him with your Boosters or stick with your team and prepare to attack once the ability concludes. While it's best to try to fight around Sigma's Experimental Barrier, if the barrier is active but his team isn't nearby, you can take a second to attack and shatter the barrier while it's out in the open. If you do this and run into Sigma shortly after, he'll be down a barrier and therefore be less capable of protecting his team and himself. When Sigma activates Gravitic Flux, it may be wise to fly up and away from your team, rather than backpedaling together with them and making yourselves easy targets; the high speed of your Boosters may also help you escape the rim of the ability just before it attempts to lift you. As Gravitic Flux alone is not enough to kill full health heroes, use your Defense Matrix to block fire from Sigma and his team, so that your allies don't take enough damage to die from Gravitic Flux's slam. With a friendly Sigma on your team, you'll have an incredibly easy time negating incoming projectiles and covering each other's bases. That being said, you'll have a much greater difficulty against beam weapons such as those of Zarya and Symmetra. Try to do your fair share of absorbing projectiles and don't put the burden of protection on your friendly Sigma; if his Experimental Barrier goes down, both he and your team will be far more fragile.\n\nWrecking Ball If you and Wrecking Ball both stay put and fire away at one another, you're almost certain to come out on top. Unfortunately, due to his high mobility, this will rarely be the case. While it's unlikely that Wrecking Ball will ever land a kill on you unless he's supported by his allies, his primary asset against you is being a nuisance who will refuse to die. Ramming him with your Boosters can temporarily disrupt him if he's swinging around, but even then he can simply roll away from a fight he doesn't wish to continue. As much as he may try to attract your attention, try to focus on killing Wrecking Ball's teammates in a group fight before turning your focus to him. If your team decides to run both D.Va and Wrecking Ball as your tanks, you're offering your team extremely minimal protection. That being said, if your team is filled with heroes who prefer to stay mobile and fend for themselves, such as Genji, Tracer and Lucio, this may be an acceptable, aggressive team composition.\n\nWinston Out of your mech, Winston is a nightmare, because he'll just Jump Pack towards you and taser you before you can whittle through his massive health. In your mech, though, his gun will only deal insignificant damage to your larger health pool while you quickly gun him down due to his large hitbox. A well-aimed [[File:Lua error in Module:Show at line 41: cargoQuery first result is nil; ability = Booster; property = ability_image.|middle|link=Lua error in Module:Show at line 41: cargoQuery first result is nil; ability = Booster; property = _pageName.#Booster|22x22px]] [[Lua error in Module:Show at line 41: cargoQuery first result is nil; ability = Booster; property = _pageName.#Booster|Booster]] ram can knock him out of his Barrier Projector's protection, making him easier to kill. If he jumps away, chase him down with your Boosters and finish him off. The classic \"dive comp\" combo, D.Va and Winston both have the ability to quickly move towards, or \"dive\", an enemy. This is especially helpful to ambush foes that wish to remain on the backline, such as Widowmaker or Support heroes. Try to coordinate with a friendly Winston so you both ambush the same target simultaneously.\n\nZarya Zarya is among D.Va's greatest enemies, as she can build lots of charge from the fire of D.Va's Fusion Cannons and Micro Missiles, and her beam is not blocked by Defense Matrix. She also has more than enough health to go up against D.Va's damage output, unlike other characters with beam weapons such as Symmetra and Mei. If an enemy Zarya's Particle Cannon is supercharged, she will mow you down without mercy. Just always keep calm and think things through. If her Particle Barrier's up, try not to fight her. Either pause and wait until the bubble drops or flee if you feel you must. When the barrier's down and you think you stand a chance, close the gap as much as you can (you can Boost up/around her while the barrier's up) and try to fight at point blank range. If you get her near-death and she activates her barrier, it's sometimes a better move to force your way through the barrier; she'll be empowered, but you'll be taking the gamble that you can finish her off before she can kill you. She can easily overpower you at mid range, but you might be able to quickly take her out if you nail her face quick enough. Overall, always remember to take extreme caution with her, and if her laser is supercharged, get out before she kills you. While having a Zarya as a second tank will cost your team traditional barriers, you each have unique ways to negate incoming fire. As long as you keep constant awareness of your teammates, you can both keep them safe from enemy fire. Zarya's Ultimate, Graviton Surge, can combo well with Self-Destruct; just make sure that if an enemy with a barrier (such as Reinhardt) is caught in the mix, you either kill him or take out his barrier, because otherwise the combo will be for naught.\n\nDamage\n\nHero Match-Up Team Synergy\n\nAshe You excel at taking down snipers, and Ashe is no exception. Defense Matrix can negate most of Ashe's abilities; if you fly towards Ashe point blank while she's isolated, you can take her out and retreat before her teammates show up to avenge her. When a friendly Ashe deploys B.O.B.\n\nBastion You can negate an enemy Bastion's Configuration: Assault gunfire with your Defense Matrix, but that's only useful if your teammates are there to help fight him as well. At both close and long range, he has you beat damage-wise. Unless you're protecting your team, try to avoid him if you can, or in the very least try to catch him from behind by surprise. If you're desperate, you can fly around him at point-blank range and confuse him, potentially killing him before he can run you down, and when in Pilot Form you can use your small hitbox to wildly jump and duck to avoid his attacks. If Bastion is in Recon configuration instead of Sentry, he's going to be much easier to finish off. If you catch a Bastion running around, try to eliminate him before he can transform or reach his team. If he does transform, consider his health, and decide whether you think you can kill him quickly enough or if you need to flee. When Bastion uses his ultimate, Configuration: Artillery, use Defense Matrix over the center of the target areas. This allows you to absorb the shots on the way down, because they actually travel as projectiles before hitting the ground and exploding. While D.Va isn't as well-suited to protect a friendly Bastion as Reinhardt or Orisa, her Defense Matrix can save him from a sudden large-impact attack, such as Pharah's Barrage. If Bastion has no one nearby to protect him, it can be helpful to stay by his side to protect him from these attacks.\n\nCassidy Defense Matrix can absorb Cassidy's gunfire as well as his Flashbang, which is the most important projectile to absorb in this matchup; time Defense Matrix well, and you can easily take Cassidy out of the picture. Defense Matrix can also completely negate Cassidy's Ultimate, Deadeye, however as its duration is far longer than your Defense Matrix's, you will have to predict when he is about to shoot or coordinate with your team to take him down while its active. If need be, you can even use your Boosters to fly closer to ensure that your Defense Matrix completely blocks his shots, or, as a last resort, bodyblock his shots at the cost of your mech. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Cassidy.\n\nEcho Defense Matrix can negate Echo's Tri-Shot and Sticky Bombs, and you can use your Boosters to pursue her in the air. Without Defense Matrix, Echo can freely land shots on you to charge up her ultimate. The one thing you should worry about is Echo's Focusing Beam. As a beam, your Defense Matrix does not block it and, if you're weak, it means you'll lose your mech in 2 seconds or less (since the damage multiplies against half-health targets). Without your mech, you don't stand a chance against her. In short, avoid fighting Echo if you're weak. Echo can use Duplicate on you, copying your abilities and can charge up Self-Destruct quicker than you can. D.Va is a very complimentary tank for Echo. You're both capable of large amounts of burst damage, so you should have no trouble securing a kill or two when you dive. Follow her calls and keep close to her, so she can shield you with Defense Matrix.\n\nGenji Due to Genji's constant mobility, he can be extremely difficult to pin down as D.Va, and his Swift Strike ignores your Defense Matrix. You'll need to rely on teammates such as Winston or Cassidy to get Genji off your back. At higher skill levels, the classic \"dive\" composition almost always includes both D.Va and Genji, along with Winston and Tracer.\n\nHanzo Your Defense Matrix will let you block the burst damage of Hanzo's Storm Arrows, while your Boosters can help you chase down and finish Hanzo if he tries to flee. Do keep an eye on your cooldowns; because he is a sniper, one or two arrows from a skilled Hanzo can take you out of your mech, at which point the match will drastically turn in his team's favor. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Hanzo.\n\nJunkrat Defense Matrix can negate Junkrat's primary fire and Concussion Mine, but not his Steel Trap. If you get trapped, just face Junkrat and activate Defense Matrix to protect yourself, then either engage if you're healthy enough or fly out if you're not. If you hear Junkrat's RIP-Tire nearby, it should be easy for you to fly up to his defenseless body and gun him down while he's unaware. Conversely, you can try to quickly gun the RIP-Tire down with a burst of Micro Missiles. D.Va is able to combo her Defense Matrix well with Junkrat's Ultimate ability: In a combo known as \"Walk The Dog\", D.Va can guard an allied Junkrat's RIP-Tire on its path to the enemy by flying behind it using Boosters while absorbing damage directed at the RIP-Tire with Defense Matrix as well as by bodyblocking.\n\nMei As Mei's primary fire is a beam attack, it cannot be absorbed with Defense Matrix At long range, Mei's icicles will out-damage D.Va's Fusion Cannons. While Defense Matrix can block these, D.Va can do very little more than play defensive when fighting Mei at a distance. Overall, D.Va has very few options when fighting Mei other than ganging up on her with teammates, finishing her off at low health, or fleeing. D.Va sometimes has an easier time fighting Mei outside of her mech; your pistol has respectable damage at a distance, but even in this case, Mei can kill you with an Endothermic Blaster Icicle headshot or two. Also, if Mei wants to keep distance between you, she can use her Ice Wall to briefly allow her to escape harm. Those abilities can also be used to help Mei and her team survive a Self-Destruct, so you have to be careful when activating it or risk having it be completely negated. Mei's Blizzard Ultimate is an excellent setup to perform a massive Self-Destruct on your immobile enemies. Her ability to freeze quick-moving flankers can also help fend off enemies such as Genji and Tracer who would normally give you trouble.\n\nPharah Your Boosters and Defense Matrix make you one of the hardest counters to Pharah. A melee strike can disrupt Pharah's hovering, sending her plummeting to the ground where your teammates can finish her off. Your ability to block all of her attacks, especially her Barrage, is invaluable. Be careful with your ability use if you think Pharah has her ultimate, wasting all of your Defense Matrix charge or launching your Self-Destruct thoughtlessly may allow her to turn tables quickly. You and Pharah tend to be the most airborne heroes. You can take advantage of this by both taking control of the skies, especially if you have a friendly Mercy on your team. Pharah's primary counters are hitscan and sniper heroes, which happen to be some of your easiest targets; you can cover her counters, while her powerful rockets can help keep flankers off your back.\n\nReaper Both you and Reaper need close range to effectively deal damage, and at close range Reaper will rip through you in seconds. While negating his Death Blossom Ultimate is very helpful for your team, in most other situations your only real options when fighting Reaper are to negate his attacks or flee, but even then Shadow Step and Wraith Form can help him chase you down and finish you off. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Reaper.\n\nSoldier: 76 Defense Matrix negate Soldier: 76's Ultimate, Tactical Visor, long enough that your team gets to cover or kills him. Remember that Defense Matrix blocks any shots that go through it, and not just ones aimed at you, so projecting the matrix at Soldier: 76 or the line of fire will prevent the shots. Other than countering his ultimate, you'll generally want to close the distance on him. Thanks to Biotic Field and Sprint, he has options to both outlast you in a fight and to flee if he feels the need to, and if your Boosters are in cooldown it will be difficult to keep up with him. Your best bet is to catch him by surprise with a burst of Micro Missiles; he'll most likely use Biotic Field to recover, but if you keep accurately firing at him, you may be able to finish him off before he can heal. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Soldier: 76.\n\nSombra With a well-timed Hack or EMP, Sombra can temporarily shut down your ultimate and abilities, forcing you to stay grounded and making you an easy target with a large hitbox, no defensive tools and no mobility. Worse, once you've lost your mech, Sombra's great mobility and ability to see wounded enemies through walls can let her hunt down and kill you while you're attempting to flee. She can even stop you from regaining your mech with a well-timed Hack. This is especially painful after activating Self-Destruct, as you'll be forced to remain in Pilot Form and potentially be killed. On the positive side, you can usually outdamage the Sombra in a one-on-one fight, even if you're hacked, or at least keep her at bay long enough for your abilities to return so you can flee. Just remember that if Sombra tries to run, you can pursue. Keep an eye on her teleport location (a beam of light will shoot in the direction she's going), and try to hunt her down and finish her off if she's wounded. A well-timed EMP can shatter the barriers of a clustered enemy team, which can pave the way for a massive Self-Destruct. When planning this combo, it is best for the D.Va to initiate her ultimate first. When doing this, the enemy team may instinctively gather behind a friendly player, at which point the EMP will leave them vulnerable, whereas leading with EMP may cause the enemy team to split apart and flee, making it more difficult to hit everyone with Self-Destruct.\n\nSojourn Like most Hitscan Damage heroes, Sojourn is usually easy pickings for D.Va. D.Va can use Defense Matrix to block Sojourn's Railgun and Disruptor Shot, and although Sojourn has high mobility with Power Slide, D.Va can easily chase after her with her Boosters. Even Overclock can be blocked with well-timed usage of Defense Matrix. The only thing D.Va needs to worry about is when you neglect to block Sojourn's Disruptor Shot, and an area becomes affected by it. Try not to engage in combat in that area, as the damage over time might cause you to lose your Mech. Sojourn's high mobility with Power Slide can help her dive onto weak and fleeing targets alongside an allied D.Va. Railgun's Alt-Fire and Disruptor Shot can both often leave enemies near-death, at which point you can quickly fly in to finish them off.\n\nSymmetra Because you can't block Symmetra's primary fire with Defense Matrix, it can be easy for an enemy Symmetra to quickly ramp her gun up to maximum charge, at which point she can plow through your impressive amount of health with ease. Symmetras often tend to linger in areas where they have Turrets set up, meaning diving her can be a risky prospect. Even if you get her to low Health, Symmetra cna often just deploy a Teleporter to make a quick getaway. Turrets themselves aren't a significant threat; while they slow you down, it's simple for D.Va to use her Fusion Cannons to quickly destroy them. Think carefully before fighting a Symmetra; try to take advantage of her vulnerability when she has no teammates nearby to protect her, since in a 1-on-1 situation with no Turrets or Teleporter, you should be able to outgun her. Always have a plan to escape with Boosters, since if you wait until the last second, she or her Turrets will probably finish you off as you try to flee. In short, avoid Symmetra when possible, and try not to start a fight with her unless it's one you're sure you can win. Symmetra can create a teleporter through which D.Va can send her mech during Self-Destruct. When done right, this can catch an enemy team completely off guard and potentially wipe them out.\n\nTorbjörn In addition to blocking an enemy Torbjörn's turret's incoming fire with Defense Matrix and help your team take it out with your Micro Missiles, you can also rush towards a turret and quickly take it out at close range, robbing Torbjörn of a large amount of his power. If timed right, you can even block Torbjörn's Ultimate ability, Molten Core, with Defense Matrix. D.Va's Defense Matrix can help protect Torbjörn's turret from oncoming fire by the likes of Widowmaker, Pharah or Soldier: 76.\n\nTracer Like Reaper, you and Tracer both excel when fighting at close range, and also like Reaper, Tracer will outdamage you in most circumstances. While Reaper has The Reaping to help him outlast your damage, Tracer's Blink and Recall will make it extremely difficult to finish her off before she strips you of your mech, at which point you're easy pickings for her. Fleeing Tracer is difficult due to her ability to catch up with you with Blink, but if you escape to a higher altitude, it will be harder for her to catch up. Tracer excels at flanking and can help you take out targets when you are diving the enemy backline.\n\nWidowmaker With her high mobility and ability to negate incoming fire, D.Va is an incredibly strong counter for Widowmaker. A common Widowmaker tactic is for her to fall to a lower altitude, wait for you to chase her, then use Grappling Hook to ascend again. Don't fall for this bait unless you have your Boosters ready to go; maintain the high ground for as long as you can, and eventually she'll be forced to ascend back to you or be gunned down by your teammates when she's out in the open. D.Va is able to distract potential targets, leaving them open to easier shots from an allied Widowmaker.\n\nSupport\n\nHero Match-Up Team Synergy\n\nAna Ana is both a Support hero and a sniper, making her one of your highest-priority targets. With Defense Matrix, you can negate her Biotic Grenade, Sleep Dart and Biotic Rifle shots. Once her abilities are on cooldown, the fight is yours. Just keep in mind that if Ana aims her grenade at the ground and not you, you'll take damage from the grenade's splash. Also be careful not to be caught off guard, as her Sleep Dart is capable of hitting D.Va's sizeable hitbox, taking her out of the fight for a potentially significant amount of time. You may be a large target for your friendly Ana to heal, but you're also a mobile one. Make sure you're always in your Ana's line of sight to stay at full health. While a Nano Boosted D.Va isn't as threatening as the likes of a boosted Reinhardt or Genji, with correct maneuvering and close-range hits you can take down a decent chunk of the enemy team during your powered-up state. Do not use Self-Destruct, as you'll immediately lose your Nano Boost in the process.\n\nBaptiste Fighting a Baptiste one-on-one isn't too difficult for D.Va. However, his Immortality Field can buy him enough time to survive your attacks, especially if his teammates are in it as well. In addition, Immortality Field can completely negate Self-Destruct's massive burst damage. As such, it's critical to take out either Baptiste or his Immortality Field before initiating Self-Destruct. When Baptiste activates Amplification Matrix, your Fusion Cannons won't be too handy due to damage falloff. However, if you happen to be in Pilot Form, your Light Gun can deal tremendous damage at range when shot through the Amplification Matrix. If done from a safe location, this can be in easy way to get some long-range kills while also building your ultimate meter up to perform Call Mech.\n\nBrigitte Due to her Barrier Shield and Inspire self-heal, it can be incredibly difficult to kill a Brigitte, and it can be very difficult to kill teammates who are being healed by her passive Inspire ability. While you are unlikely to be killed by a Brigitte in a 1 on 1 fight, the time it will take you to kill her is so long that it isn't worth the effort, especially if you're deep in enemy territory where her teammates might arrive to provide her backup. Keep your distance from Brigitte where she can't hit you with her Rocket Flail and focus on breaking her shield with long-range gunfire. If caught by surprise by Brigitte and you have no teammates nearby, better to use your Boosters to flee and regroup than attempt to take her down after she's already wounded you. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Brigitte.\n\nKiriko Despite normally excelling at taking out Support Heroes, dealing with Kiriko can prove to be a massive headache for D.Va. So long as a single teammate is anywhere nearby, Kiriko can use Swift Step to easily escape a fight that's going poorly for her. Even if you chase her down, she'll now have a teammate to back her up, making the job much more difficult. With her Protection Suzu, Kiriko can not only save herself or her teammates from being finished off by your Fusion Cannons, but they can even completely negate the explosion of Self-Destruct, making it imperative to always keep track of its cooldown to ensure she doesn't easliy deny your Ultimate. Kiriko may use Wall Climb to evade you, but so long as you keep track of her movements or use Boosters to follow her, it will be a minor inconvenience more than anything. Her Kunai deal very little damage to you, but don't underestimate their critical hit potential. If Kiriko decides to try to fight you one-on-one, focus on offensive pressure while keeping track of your health, and only use Defense Matrix to block or flee with Boosters when necessary, as Kiriko will typically only be fighting you when escape isn't an option, and you want to take advantage of that brief window of opportunity. When a friendly Kiriko uses Kitsune Rush, try to stay in its range, as it will allow you to quickly spam Micro Missiles while also letting you recharge Defense Matrix faster.\n\nLúcio Due to Lúcio's high mobility and self-heal, it can be very difficult to definitively finish him off, even with your Micro Missiles. If you are being harassed by a Lúcio, it's often best to regroup with your team so one of your allies can deal with him. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Lúcio.\n\nLifeweaver Lifeweaver's lack of self-preservation tools compared to other Support Heroes make him easier to deal with than others. Even if he tries to flee with Rejuvenating Dash or Petal Platform, you can easily chase him down with your Boosters and finish him off. While his Thorn Volley is powerful, smart use of Defense Matrix can render it a non-issue. You can also use Defense Matrix to block Healing Blossom, denying his teammates the health they need as your own teammates finish them off. It is especially prudent to prioritize Lifeweaver over his teammates due to his Life Grip, which can deny you an important kill at the worst possible time. When Lifeweaver deploys Tree of Life, consider whether it's more practical to quickly mow down the Tree and then move on to Lifeweaver and his team, or to instead flee and regroup with your own team. Be careful when using Self-Destruct, as Lifeweaver can use Life Grip to render one of his teammates immortal or pull them from the blast radius, or he can use Tree of Life to completely block its explosion. When a friendly Lifeweaver uses Tree of Life, use it as cover so you can recharge your Defense Matrix. Fighting near it can also allow you to last longer in long close-range fights, which are your specialty.\n\nMercy When an enemy Mercy is in sight, you need to be decisive on whether or not you're going to focus on her. If you damage her somewhat but let her fly away, she'll simply heal back to full health due to her self-healing abilities. In particular, while Pharah is one of your greatest targets, she becomes far more difficult to deal with if she has a Mercy attached at the hip. If she's well-protected in the rear of the enemy team, don't barrel in after her unless you have other teammates who are coming with you, otherwise she'll fly from teammate to teammate to avoid your attacks while her teammates promptly rip you to shreds. That being said, if you do have the likes of a Winston or Doomfist on your side, you can safely dive in and focus her down. If you catch Mercy alone, her lack of mobility and puny firepower makes her an easy target; just kill her quickly, because if one teammate shows up, she can fly to them and use them as a shield. Like Pharah, D.Va's flight provides a massive boon to a friendly Mercy's aerial mobility. If a friendly Mercy is willing to pocket you, you can withstand most fights thanks to your impressive health and close-range damage output. If the situation is dire, though, be willing to flee from the fight; you might survive a group fight, but if your Mercy is killed because you weren't protecting her, she'll be much less inclined to pocket you in the future. By flying away from a fight, you're giving your friendly Mercy the out she needs.\n\nMoira Moira's only real tool to escape D.Va is Fade, but if you keep a good eye out for where she travels, you can use your Boosters to chase after her. Her Biotic Orb could pose a threat to you or sustain her in a prolonged fight, but Defense Matrix can negate both healing and damage orbs in a flash, leaving Biotic Grasp as Moira's only offensive option of attack, which is not very effective against your large health pool. So long as you can keep aim on her if she's jumping around to avoid your fire, you should easily be able to finish her off before you run out of health. That being said, do not attempt to engage with a Moira when you are out of your mech, as her Biotic Orb and Biotic Grasp will eliminate you in seconds. Be wary of Moira's ultimate, though, as it pierces Defense Matrix, and you have no way of interrupting it. D.Va has no notable team synergy with Moira.\n\nZenyatta Zenyatta can shut you down in a number of ways. His Orb of Discord can help dissolve your massive health in no time, and you are a such a large target that he can usually hit you with every shot of his Orb of Destruction orb volley for massive damage. However, most of these tactics rely on you not seeing Zenyatta until it's too late and that he has some sort of escape plan. If you catch Zenyatta alone and by surprise, your high burst damage should annihilate him before he can return the attack. Zenyatta's lack of mobility makes him an easy target if left alone by his team, so always try to jump on the opportunity to ambush him if he's on his own, even if this requires taking alternate routes to get behind him and sneak up on him. Because she has high damage output at close range (as well as medium to long range with her Light Gun), D.Va should always attempt to focus on enemies affected by a friendly Zenyatta's Orb of Discord. If played right, you and your Zenyatta can take down one enemy after another. Just remember that Zenyatta has very low mobility, so don't leave him alone or you'll be begging for an enemy to ambush him.\n\nStory\n\nWith nimble reflexes and quick thinking,[2] D.Va is a former professional gamer who now uses her skills to pilot a state-of-the-art mech in defense of her homeland.[3] She is a very competitive individual,[4] and coupled with her pro-gamer skills, this makes her an extremely effective mech pilot. Never backing down, D.Va always plays to win.[5] While she projects a carefree, irreverant attitude, D.Va is burdened by the emotional cost of defending her homeland, and the facade the South Korean media projects on her.[6]\n\nIn addition to skills as a mech pilot, D.Va is also a competent mechanic.[6] She loves engineering, and is constantly improving Tokki.[7]\n\nEarly Life\n\n“ It's like how we used to stay up late, and work on your hoverbike.\n\nYou mean the one you wrecked?\n\nReally? You're still mad about that? We won the race!\n\nYeah! And you almost killed yourself! „ ~ Dae-hyun and Hana\n\nHana Song grew up playing classic games with her father, himself a former professional gamer during his younger years.[8] He was the one that introduced her to StarCraft, and her undeniable skill helped lay the foundation for her eventual e-sports victories in other games.[9]\n\nSong has been friends with Dae-hyun since childhood. They would stay up late working on his hoverbike. Hana took part in a race with it and won, albeit at the cost of the bike and nearly her own life, due to its reactor overloading.[6]\n\nLike her father before her, Song became a pro-gamer.[10] She became a Mecha Guardian V player in high school, quickly ascending to the #1 rank, winning the world championship[6], surpassing her teammate Yuna Lee [8][11] and rival Kyung-soo Hann.[8] A fierce competitor, Song played to win at any cost, and gained a well-earned reputation for showing no mercy to her opponents.[3]\n\nMEKA\n\nAt home, however, not all was well, as MEKA struggled to maintain its defense against the Gwishin omnics that repeatedly attacked the nation. As the omnics continued to adapt, they eventually disrupted MEKA's drone-control networks, forcing the military to place pilots in the mechs. Scrambling to find suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's professional gamers, who possessed the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs' advanced weapons systems,[3] in addition to standouts from other fields that required similar talents. Top stars were drafted, including the 19-year-old Song,[4] along with Lee and Kyung-soo.[11][8] She saw the new mission as a game,[3] and an evolution of her own career. Without fear or hesitation, she abandoned the limelight of her pro-gamer career, and got an armored mech operator's licence. As a member of the MEKA Squad under the command of Captain Myung,[12] she could put her reflexes to the ultimate test on a real battlefield, instead of a digital one.[4] Her skills and intense competitive spirit made her an extremely effective pilot.[5] Myung instructed Song to consider all threats, not just the ones right in front of her.[12]\n\nSong now fearlessly charges into battle alongside the rest of her MEKA unit, ready to spring to her nation's defense at a moment's notice. Not long before the Second Omnic Crisis, she began to stream combat operations to her adoring fans, and her growing following turned her into a global icon.[3] Sponsorship deals and her fanbase provided her with the means to customize her mech,[13] such as Nano Cola.[6]\n\nAt some point she also played one of the leading roles in the movie Hero of My Storm.[14][15]\n\nAs an active member of the military, Song was no longer able to freely travel as she could've as a civilian. She became an avid reader of Mei's Adventures, the publicly-posted travel journal of climatologist Mei-Ling Zhou, fascinated with all the different places Mei has seen.[16]\n\nShooting Star\n\n“ Oh man. This time off is great, isn't it?\n\nWhat's not to like? There's delicious food, and drinks...\n\nYeah...\n\nAnd good friends. The kind that are always there for you-- when you need them most. „\n\nAs time went on, the cost of defending South Korea from the Gwishin began to take its toll on Song. In one battle in Busan during a thunder storm, the squad barely managed to defeat the omnics, but the other mechs were put out of commision due to serious damage and their pilots sustained some injuries; only Song came out of it relatively unscathed. While the rest of the squad went on leave and the media reporting that Song was celebrating the victory by schmoozing with celebrities, Song had actually chosen to remain on active duty and spent time over the next week fixing and fine-tuning her mech alongside Dae-hyun, who had also joined MEKA as her assigned mechanic. As she stated that the squad and the rest of Busan were counting on her to keep the city safe, and any mistakes on her part could cost them everything, Dae-hyun recognized the emotional weight Song was carrying. He tried to convince her that she needed a break and that it was okay to ask for help, not needing to bear it alone, but she assured him that she had things under control.\n\nThat didn't last long however, as five Gwishin omnics returned to attack Busan—while previous attacks were spaced between months, this one was just one week, which left the pair the only ones present to defend against the omnics. Song launched her mech to engage them. She took out two of the Gwishin, but the remaining three outmaneuvered her, damaging her mech and destroying one of the fusion cannons. Dae-hyun told her to get to cover and wait for reinforcements, but Song stated that they wouldn't get there in time. Performing a 180 on the pursuing omnics, she managed to destroy two of them, while the last Gwishin broke off and headed for Busan. Song pursued it, but it avoided her weapons fire and micro missile barrage before turning around and entangled her mech, tearing off the other cannon when she tried to fire on it. Left without any weapons, all her status readouts in the redline, and the city still in danger, she realized she could do nothing else and asked for her friend's help.\n\nWith Dae-hyun going over the mech's status, on the mention of the reactor becoming unstable Song remembered their earlier conversation of the destruction of his hovercycle, and suggested purposely overloading the mech's reactor. After some protest, Dae-hyun obliged, and as Song distracted the omnic to buy him some time he successfully triggered an overload that would destroy the reactor in sixty seconds. The omnic would reach Busan before that however, so Song ejected from the mech and used her light gun to shoot the exposed reactor from afar, destroying both the mech and the omnic. She fell into the sea, where she was recovered by a search-and-rescue team and taken for medical treatment, Dae-hyun accompanying her.\n\nSouth Korean media later made an update on the attack, reporting that authorities had stated that she had emerged without a scratch. In reality, she came out of the ordeal with a broken leg and arm, along with other more minor injuries. That didn't stop her from using her time off by assisting Dae-hyun with assembling her new mech. She thanked him for being there for her when she'd needed him.[6]\n\nNew Blood\n\n“ I'm making the call to dispatch you to Overwatch. We can't afford to be caught unawares like this again. MEKA Squad will remain here, but D.Va, you have a new assignment. Assess the Null Sector threat to Korea and update our tactical response. You may travel as you see fit to accomplish this task. If Overwatch is gathering the intel we need, I want you right there with them.\n\nThank you, ma'am. Dan gyeuol! „ ~ Myung assigns D.Va to Overwatch\n\nSong and the rest of her squad watched a news report on Null Sector's attack on Paris, and how it had been repulsed by a newly-reformed Overwatch. Song asked Captain Myung if MEKA was going to contact Overwatch, as MEKA Squad's experience in fighting omnics could prove invaluable. Myung refused—contact with Overwatch had been forbidden by HQ, and MEKA was needed at Korea to defend the nation from the Gwishin. In light of the Gwishin's earlier attack (the one Song had single-handedly repelled), the squad was ordered to remain on high alert in the event of another Gwishin attack. The squad agreed, but Song talked to Myung in private, pressing the case to ally with Overwatch. She pointed out that the world's initial disunity during the first Omnic Crisis had cost millions of lives. If Myung contacted HQ, pressing the case to join with Overwatch, Song was certain they'd listen to her.\n\nBehind closed doors, Myung could admit to admiring what Overwatch had stood for, but South Korea was still bound to respect the Petras Act, and MEKA couldn't defy direct orders. Before the debate could progress, an alarm sounded—Null Sector was attacking Busan, with thousands of omnics being deployed by drop pods from a command ship. MEKA Squad was deployed to repel them. Song requested permission to attack the ship directly, but Myung refused, instead ordering the squad to clear the enemy from Busan's evacuation routes. However, it became clear that they were caught between the need to defend the city, and the fact that the ship could deploy apparently limitless reinforcements.\n\nMyung ordered a change in strategy—Song and King were ordered to attack the ship, while the rest of the squad played defense. However, the squad was overwhelmed, leaving Song with the sole operating mech. Myung gave the order to withdraw, but Song refused, insisting that they had to save Busan. The tide turned with the arrival of Overwatch members in a dropship. While Overwatch operated on the ground, Myung ordered MEKA Squad to take out the ship. All five mechs opened fire, causing the ship to retreat. All that was left was to mop up the remaining Null Sector forces, after which they escorted the dropship back to MEKA Base.\n\nInside, Song met with Cole Cassidy and the rest of the Overwatch members. He revealed that they'd come to Busan to see if MEKA was interested in working with Overwatch. Myung gave Song the go-ahead. She'd sort things out with HQ, while Song was assigned to work with Overwatch, assess the Null Sector threat, and report back to them, so they could update their tactical response. Song joyfully accepted the new assignment. The following day, she and the rest of the Overwatch members flew to Watchpoint: Gibraltar.[12]\n\nToronto\n\nD.Va and other Overwatch members arrived in Toronto when the city was invaded by Null Sector.[17]\n\nAchievements\n\nTrivia\n\nSelf-Destruct: In line with D.Va's ultimate voice line, \"Nerf this!\", which can be interpreted as a challenge to the developers to nerf her ultimate, as of March 8, 2024, Self-Destruct has never been nerfed.\n\nIn the Shooting Star cinematic, reveals how Self-Destruct works compared to in-game: By ejecting then fires the light pistol on the exposed reactor with one overloading it.\n\nD.Va's suit has sponsors all over it, which is a reference to the same advertising style of sponsors in Korean esports.\n\nD.Va's mech is named Tokki (토끼), which means rabbit.[18]\n\nHana is a fan of Lúcio's music, and has apparently bought his album. He in turn also knows enough of the pro-gaming scene to be a fan of hers.\n\nD.Va is the youngest launch hero, and was the youngest hero overall until Orisa was introduced. D.Va is sometimes teased by others because of her age, such as when Widowmaker mockingly says, \"This is no place for children.\"\n\nD.Va is the fifth playable Overwatch character in Heroes of the Storm,[19] and is a purchasable announcer, along with Genji.\n\nDefense Matrix has D.Va manually shoot down incoming projectiles, counting towards her APM. In-game, D.Va is able to reach an APM of 84,480 in a best-case scenario by blocking the combined 1,408 pellets per second of 11 simultaneous Whole Hogs.\n\nD.Va is the first hero to use randomized \"Quick Melee\" attacks with both arms (in mech mode). Outside of her mech, she uses her right hand for \"Quick Melee\" attacks.\n\nCultural Impact\n\nD.Va is used as the symbol for the National D.Va Association, now called FAMERz, a progressive feminist movement composed of Overwatch fans. The group achieved international notability after a photograph of their flag—featuring D.Va's bunny-ears logo—was photographed in a news report for an international Women's March event in Seoul on January 21st, 2017. Based in South Korea, the group chose D.Va as its symbol owing to an earlier incident where professional teenage Overwatch player Geguri was accused of cheating owing to an eighty percent win rate; which some believed was \"impossible\" for girls to achieve. The group distributes stickers of D.Va's bunny logo, among other paraphernalia. It plans on finding new ways to use Overwatch as a tool for spreading its message.[20]\n\nCharlet Chung, who is D.Va's English voice actor, has commented positively on her character, commenting \"in terms of representation of Asian-American characters in video games, particularly women, they might be over-sexualized - and I don't know if I'm being too candid here - I feel like D.Va is more of a real person. She happens to have some sex appeal, but that's not why she's in the game. She's not there to be an exotic lotus.\"[21]\n\nD.Va's Police Officer skin was released in 2017, leading a number of players to vow to never play D.Va, linking the skin with police brutality.[22]\n\nEtymology\n\nD.Va's name is a play on the word \"Diva\", meaning a female celebrity.\n\nThe stylization of her name is reminiscent of Korean pop idols, who often adopt pseudonyms to stand out. In the Korean version of the game, D.Va's name is the only name not in Hangul, reflective of the romanization of these idols' names. This makes sense considering D.Va is a Korean idol through her fame as a pro-gamer.\n\nThe way her name has a prefix \"D.\" is reminiscent of the way esports players have an abbreviated team tag before their names. This is supported by how she and D.Mon played on the same team.\n\nD.Va's given name Hana (하나) is the same as the Korean number 1. This parallels her personality, as she is a world champion and self-proclaimed \"Number One.\"\n\nD.Va's jersey number when she was a pro player was also the number 1.[23]\n\nDevelopment\n\nD.Va was first announced through the official PlayOverwatch Twitter account, which linked to a mock-up page on the official StarCraft II World Championship site.[24][25] She had previously been depicted in posters in the attacking team's starting area in Hanamura. Her StarCraft page was later taken down and the link instead redirects to the StarCraft II home page.\n\nThe StarCraft WCS web page first introduced D.Va as a former professional StarCraft player. Michael Chu later clarified on February 1, 2018 that this was not intended to be canon and was just a fun way to tease the character. He also explained that the unnamed game that she was best known for in her career was one that best matched the skills needed to pilot her mech.[26]\n\nD.Va's design and kit seems to take inspiration from Brit, one of the hero concepts created for the Overwatch pitch meeting.\n\nMerchandise\n\nA StarCraft II portrait and announcer for D.Va was available for those who attended BlizzCon 2016 or bought a Virtual Ticket for the event.[27] The announcer has since been made available for regular purchase.\n\nA D.Va statue is available.[28]\n\nA Funko Pop D.Va statue is available for purchase from the Blizzard Store.[29]\n\nA D.Va-themed hoodie is available from JINX.[30]\n\nA Figma D.Va statue is available.[31]\n\nD.Va will appear in LEGO Overwatch, as part of a set shared with Genji.[32]\n\nMedia\n\nImages\n\nAbilities\n\nD.Va posing with mech\n\nPilot D.Va with her pistol\n\nD.Va getting in her MEKA (Tokki)\n\nConcept Art\n\nOverwatch 2 skin Weapon concept art\n\nAcademy skin Mech concept art\n\nAcademy skin pilot and pistol concept art\n\nPorsche skin concept art\n\nPorsche skin early concept art\n\nVideos\n\nBalance Change Log\n\nFor more information, see Patch Notes.\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial Site - D.Va\n\nD.Va Guide on Icy Veins"
