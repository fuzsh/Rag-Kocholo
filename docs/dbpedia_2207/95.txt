Created by author Earl Derr Biggers, Charlie Chan is a Chinese-American detective from Honolulu who solves crimes using his intellect and wisdom. He made his first appearance in the 1925 novel “The House Without a Key” and became immensely popular in subsequent novels and adaptations.

The film adaptations, particularly those produced by Fox Film Corporation and later 20th Century Fox, were particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s.

Notably, the character of Charlie Chan has been portrayed by actors of various ethnic backgrounds (like Swedish actor Warner Oland or American actor Sidney Toler), sparking debates about racial stereotypes and representation in media.
